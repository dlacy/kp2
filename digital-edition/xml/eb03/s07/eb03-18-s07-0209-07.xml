one of the moſt northerly kingdoms of Europe, lying between Lat. 55. 20. and 69. 30. north, and between 12⁰ and 32⁰ eaſt from London. On the ſouth it is bounded by the Baltic, on the north by Danish Lapland, on the eaſt by Muſcovy, and on the weſt by the mountains of of Norway, being 800 miles in length and 350 in breadth.</p><p>The early hiſtory of Sweden is no leſs involved in lables than that of moſt other nations. Some hiſtorians have pretended to give regular catalogues of the princes who reigned in Sweden in very early times ; but they differ ſo much among themſelves, that no credit can be given to them. However, all agree that ancient Scandinavia was first governed by judges elected for a certain time by the voice of the people. Among theſe temporary princes the country was divided, until, in the year of the world 2054, according to ſome, or 1951, according to others, Eric, or, if we believe Puffendorf, Suenon was raiſed to the ſupreme power, with the prerogatives of all the temporary magiſtrates united in his perſon for life, or until his conduct ſhould merit depoſition.</p><p>From this very early period till the year 1366 of the Chriſtian era, the hiſtories of Sweden preſent us with nothing but what is common to all nations in their early periods, viz. the endleſs combats and massacres of barbarians, tending to no other purpoſe than the effuſion of blood. At the time juſt mentioned, however, Albert of Mecklenburg, having concluded a peace between Sweden and Denmark, which two kingdoms had been at violent war for ſome time before, was proclaimed king of Sweden. The peace was of ſhort duration, being broken in 1368; on which Albert entered into an offenſive and defenſive league with the earl of Holſtein, the Jutland nobility, the dukes of Selfwick, Mecklenburg, and the Hanſe-towns, againſt the kings of Denmark and Norway. Albert proved very ſucceſsful againſt Waldemar king of Denmark at that time, driving him entirely out of his dominions ; but he himſelf was defeated by the king of Norway, who laid ſiege to his capital. Soon after this, a new treaty of peace was concluded, by which Albert was allowed to enjoy the crown of Sweden in peace. However, having formed a deſign of rendering himſelf abſolute, he fell under the diſpleaſure of his ſubjects, and Margaret of Norway was proclaimed queen of Sweden by the malecontents. A war immediately enſued, in which Albert was defeated and taken priſoner ; but as the princes of Mecklenburg, the earls of Holſtein, and the Hanse towns, entered into a league in his favour, the war was ſo far from being extinguiſhed by this event, that it raged with more fury than ever.</p><p>At length, in 1394, the contending parties came to an accommodation. Albert was ſet at liberty, on condition that he ſhould in three years ſurrender to Margaret all pretenſions to the city of Stockholm; and the Hanſe-towns engaged to pay the ſum of 60,000 marks of ſilver in caſe of Albert’s breach of faith. Not long after this, Eric the ſon of Albert died ; and he, having no other child, did not think it worth his while to contend for the kingdom of Sweden : he therefore acquieſced in the pretenſions of Margaret, and passed the remainder of his days at Mecklenburg.</p><p>Margaret died in 1415, and was ſucceeded by Eric of Pomerania. This prince’s reign was cruel and oppreſſive to the laſt degree. The people were ruined by taxes ; and the Danes being every where preferred to the offices of power, committed the greateſt cruelties. The conſequence of this was a revolt ; and Charles Canutſon, grand mareſchal of Sweden and governor of Finland, having joined the malecontents, was declared commander in chief of their army. Eric was now formally depoſed, and commenced pirate : Canutſon was choſen regent : but beginning to oppreſs the people, and aſpiring openly at the crown, the Swedes and Danes revolted ; in conſequence of which a revolution took place, and Chriſtopher duke of Bavaria, nephew to Eric, was choſen king of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, in 1442.</p><p>On the accession of the new prince, complaints againſt Canutſon were brought from all quarters; but, through the intereſt of his ſriends, he eſcaped the puniſhment due to him ; and in 1448, Chriſtopher having died after a tyrannical reign or ſomewhat more than five years, he was raised to the throne at which he had ſo long aſpired. However, the kingdoms of Denmark and Norway refuſed to own allegiance to him ; upon which a war immediately commenced.<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0216.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0210"/>
In 1454 peace was concluded, and Denmark for the preſent freed from the Swediſh yoke. Neither did Canutſon long enjoy even the crown of Sweden itſelf. Having quarrelled with the archbiſhop of Upſal, the latter formed luch a ſtrong party that the king could not refill him. Chriſtian king of Denmark was called to the throne of Sweden ; and in 1459 once more united the three kingdoms. He enjoyed his dignity but a ſhort time; for having begun to oppreſs his ſubjects in an arbitrary manner, he was obliged to retire to Denmark in 1463. Katil biſhop of Lincoping, who had driven out the king, took upon himſelf the office of regent. Next year Chriſtian returned with a powerful army ; but was defeated. The people then thought proper to recal Canutſon : but he, on his firſt acceſſion, having offended the warlike Biſhop Katil, was by him defeated, and obliged to renounce his right to the crown. After this the kingdom was rent into factions ; between whom the moſt cruel civil wars took place, until the year 1467, when Canutſon was again recalled, and enjoyed the kingdom, though not without difficulty and opposition, till his death, which happened in 1470.</p><p>The confuſion in which the Swediſh affairs had been ſo long involved did not ceaſe on the death of Canutſon. Christian again invaded Sweden ; but was defeated by Steen Sture, nephew to the late king. After this the kingdom ſeems to have remained in peace till the year 1487, when the Russians invaded Carelia, committing everywhere the greatest ravages. Theſe were ſoon driven out : but in 1497, a rupture happening betwixt Sture and the ſenate, an offer was made of the Swediſh crown to John king of Denmark. This prince readily accepted the offer, and was crowned accordingly ; but no ſooner was be ſeated on the throne than he became odious to the Swedes, from his partiality to the Hanes. In a ſhort time he ſet out for Denmark, leaving his queen, with a ſtrong garriſon, in the citadel of Stockholm. He was no ſooner gone than the capital was inveſted : and though the queen made a noble defence, ſhe was at laſt obliged to capitulate, on condition of being allowed to paſs into Denmark. All the garriſon were made priſoners of war, and the queen herſelf was confined in a monaſtery till the following year.</p><p>The Swediſh affairs continued to be involved in the same dreadful confuſion as we have already related, until the year 1520, when a great revolution was effected by Guſtavus Ericſon, a nobleman of the firſt rank, who reſtored the kingdom to its liberty, and laid the foundation of its future grandeur. The occaſion of this great revolution was as follows : In 1518, Chriſtian king of Denmark invaded Sweden, with a deſign to ſubdue the whole country ; but being defeated with great loſs by young Steen Sture, the regent at that time, he ſet sail for Denmark. But meeting with contrary winds, he made ſeveral deſcents on the Swediſh coaſt, which he ravaged with all the fury of an incenſed barbarian. The inhabitants, however, bravely deſended themselves, and Chriſtian was reduced to the utmoſt distreſs ; one half of his forces having periſhed with hunger, and the other being in the most imminent danger by the approach of a rigorous winter. He then thought of a ſtratagem, which had almoſt proved fatal to the regent ; for having invited him to a conference, at which he designed either to aſſaſſinate or take him priſoner, Sture was about to comply, bad not the ſenate, who ſuſpected the plot, interpoſed and prevented him. Chriſtian then offered to go in person to Stockholm in order to confer with Sture, upon condition that six hoſtages ſhould be sent in his room. This was accordingly done ; but the wind happening then to prove favourable, he ſet sail for Denmark with the hoſtages, of whom Guſtavus Ericſon was one. Next year he returned ; and having drawn Sture into an ambuſh, the regent received a wound of which he died ſome time after. The kingdom being thus left without a head, matters ſoon came to the moſt desperate criſis. The army diſbanded itſelf; and the ſenate, inſtead of taking proper meaſures to oppoſe the enemy, ſpent their time in idle debates. Chriſtian in the mean time advanced into the heart of the kingdom, deſtroying every thing with fire and sword,∙ but on his arrival at Stragnez, he granted a ſuſpenſion of arms, to give the people time to deliberate on their ſituation, and to reflect that they might eaſily get rid of their troubles by electing him king. This they accordingly did; and Chriſtian proved one of the moſt bloody tyrants that ever ſat on the throne of any kingdom. Immediately after his coronation, he gave grand entertainments for three days; during which time he projected the diabolical deſign of extirpating at once all the Swediſh nobility, and thus for ever preventing the people from revolting, by depriving them of their proper leaders. As the tyrant had ſigned articles, by which he promiſed indemnity to all who had borne arms againſt him, it became neceſsary to invent ſome cause of offence againſt thoſe whom he intended to deſtroy. To accompliſh his purpoſe, Guſtavus Trolle, formerly archbiſhop of Upſal, but who had been degraded from that dignity, in an oration before his majeſty lamented the demolition of Stecka, his place of reſidence, and the loſſes ſuſtained by the ſee of Upſal, amounting to near a million of money. He then proceeded in a bitter accuſation againſt the widow and the ſon-in-law of Sture the late-regent, comprehending in the ſame accuſation about 15 of the principal nobility, the whole ſenate, and the burghers of Stockholm The conſequence of this was, that above 60 of the principal nobility and people of firſt rank in Sweden were hanged up as traitors. Innumerable other cruelties were committed ; part of which are owned by the Daniſh hiſtorians, and minutely related by thoſe of Sweden. At laſt he departed for Denmark, ordering gibbets to be erected, and cauſing the peasants to be hanged on them for the ſlighteſt offences, all the way as he paſſed along; and it is related of him, that at Jencoping he cauſed two boys, one of ſeven and the other of nine years of age, to be whipped to death.</p><p>This monſtrous cruelty, inſtead of ſecuring him on the throne, exaſperated the whole nation againſt him. It has already been mentioned, that Guſtavus Ericſon, or, as he is commonly called, <hi rend="italic">Gustavus Vaſa,</hi> was among the number of the hoſtages whom Chriſtian had perfidiouſly carried to Denmark in 1519. Large promiſes had been made in order to reconcile him to Chriſtian, and threats had been uſed for the ſame purpoſe, but all in vain. Secret orders were given to ſtrangle him in priſon ; but the officer to whom the aſſaſſination was committed remonſtrated to the king about the conſequences of it, and prevailed on him to change the ſentence of death into cloſe confinement in the caſtle of Copenhagen. Some of the hoſtages periſhed in conſequence of the rigorous treatment they met with; but Guſtavus withſtood all hardſhips. At laſt one Banner, a Daniſh nobleman, prevailed on the king to put him into his hands, in order to try whether or not he could prevail upon him to change his ſentiments. The king, however, told Banner, that he muſt pay 6000 crowns in caſe the priſoner ſhould make his eſcape. Banner generouſly assented ; and having brought the noble priſoner to his fortreſs of Calo in Jutland, ſoon allowed him all the liberty he could deſire, and otherwiſe heaped favours upon him. All this, however, could not extinguiſh his remembrance of the cruelties of Chriſtian, and the deſire he had of being ſerviceable to his country. He therefore determined to make his eſcape ; and the liberty he enjoyed ſoon put him in a capacity of<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0217.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0211"/>
effecting it. Having one day mounted his horſe, under pretence of hunting as uſual in the foreſt, when he got at a proper diſtance, he changed his dreſs to the habit of a peasant ; and quitting his horſe, he travelled for two days on foot through by-paths, and over mountains almoſt impaſſable, arriving on the third at Flenſburgh. Here no one was admitted without a paſſport ; and Guſtavus dreaded preſenting himſelf to the governor or the officer upon guard, for fear of being diſcovered. Happily for him, it chanced to be on that ſeaſon of the year when the merchants of Lower Saxony drove a conſiderable trade in cattle, which they purchaſe in Jutland. Guſtavus hired himſelf to one of theſe merchants ; and under favour of his diſguiſe eſcaped out of the Daniſh territories, and arrived at Lubec.</p><p>Banner was no ſooner acquainted with his eſcape, than he ſet out after him with the utmoſt diligence, found him at Lubec, and reproached him with great warmth as ungrateful and treacherous ; but he was ſoon appeaſed by the arguments urged by Guſtavus, and eſpecially by the promiſe he made of indemnifying him in the loſs of his ranſom. Upon this Banner returned, giving out that he could not find his priſoner. Chriſtian was enraged at his eſcape, apprehending that he might reverſe all his deſigns in Sweden ; and gave orders to Otho his general to make the stricteſt ſearch, and leave no means untried to arreſt him. Guſtavus applied to the regency for a ſhip to convey him to Sweden, where he hoped he ſhould be able to form a party againſt the Danes. He likewiſe endeavoured to draw the regency of Lubec into his meaſures ; and reaſoned with ſo much zeal and ability, that Nicholas Gemins, firſt conſul, was entirely gained ; but the regency could never be prevailed on to declare for a party without friends, arms, money, or credit. However, before his departure, the conſul gave him aſſurances, that if he could raiſe a force sufficient to make head againſt the enemy in the field, he might depend on the ſervices of the republic, and that the regency would immediately declare for him. Guſtavus deſired to be landed at Stockholm ; but the captain of the ſhip, either having ſecret orders to the contrary, or buſineſs elſewhere, ſteered a different courſe, and put him on ſhore near Calmar ; a city hitherto garriſoned by the troops of Chriſtina widow of the regent. In truth, the governor held this place for his own purpoſes, and only waited to make the beſt terms he could with the Danes. When Guſtavus arrived, he made himſelf known to him and the principal officers of the garriſon, who were moſtly Germans, and his fellow-soldiers in the late adminiſtrator's army. He flattered himſelf that his birth, his merit, and connections, would immediately procure him the command. But the mercenary band, ſeeing him without troops and without attendants, regarded him as a deſperate perſon devoted to deſtruction, refuſed to embrace his propoſals, and even threatened to kill or betray him, if he did not inſtantly quit the city.</p><p>Diſappointed in his expectations, Guſtavus departed with great expedition ; and his arrival being now publicly known, he was again forced to have recourſe to his peaſant’s diſguiſe to conceal him from the Daniſh emiſſaries diſperſed over the country to ſearch for him. In a waggon loaded with hay he paſſed through every quarter of the Daniſh army, and at laſt repaired to an old family caſtle in Sudermania. From hence he wrote to his friends, notifying his return to Sweden, and beſeeching them to aſſemble all their forces in order to break through the enemy’s army into Stockholm, at that time beſieged ; but they, too, refuſed to embark in ſo hazardous and deſperate an attempt.</p><p>Guſtavus next applied himſelf to the peaſants ; but they anſwered, that they enjoyed ſalt and herrings under the government of the king of Denmark ; and that any attempts to bring about a revolution would be attended with certain ruin, without the proſpect of bettering their condition ; for peaſants they were, and peaſants they ſhould remain, whoever was king. At length, after ſeveral vain attempts to throw himſelf into Stockholm, after that city was ſurrendered to the king, after the horrid maſſacre of the senates, and after running a thouſand dangers, and undergoing hardships and fatigues hardly to be ſupported by human nature, he formed the reſolution of trying the courage and affection of the Dalecarlians. While he was in the deepeſt obſcurity, and plunged in almoſt unſurmountable adverſity, he never relinquiſhed his deſigns nor his hopes. The news of the maſſacre had, however, very near sunk him into deſpondency, as thereby he lost all his friends, relations, and connections, and indeed almoſt every proſpect of ſafety to himſelf or deliverance to his country. It was this that inſpired the thought of going to Dalecarlia, where he might live with more ſecurity in the high mountains and thick woods of that country, if he ſhould fail in the attempt of exciting the inhabitants to revolt.</p><p>Attended by a peaſant, to whom he was known, he travelled in diſguiſe through Sudermania, Nericia, and Weſtermania, and, after a laborious and painful journey, arrived in the mountains of Dalecarlia. Scarce had he finished his journey, when he found himſelf deſerted by his companion and guide, who carried off with him all the money he provided for his ſubſiſtence. Thus forlorn, deſtitute, half ſtarved, he entered among the miners, and wrought like a ſlave under ground, without relinquiſhing his hopes of one day aſcending the throne of Sweden. His whole proſpect for the preſent was to live concealed, and gain a maintenance, until fortune ſhould effect ſomething in his favour : nor was it long before this happened. A woman in the mines perceived, under the habit of a peaſant, that the collar of his ſhirt was embroidered. This circumſtance excited curioſity ; and the graces of his perſon and converſation, which had ſomething in them to attract the notice of the meaneſt of the vulgar , afforded room for ſuſpicion that he was ſome perſon of quality in diſguiſe, forced by the tyranny of the government to ſeek ſhelter in theſe remote parts. The ſtory came to the ears of a neighbouring gentleman, who immediately went to the mines to offer his protection to the unfortunate ſtranger ; and was aſtoniſhed on recognizing the features of Guſtavus, whoſe acquaintance he had been at the university of Upſal. Touched with compassion at the deplorable ſituation of ſo diſtinguiſhed a nobleman, he could ſcarce refrain from tears; but however had preſence of mind enough not to make the diſcovery. At night he ſent for Guſtavus, made him an offer of his houſe, and gave him the ſtrongeſt aſſurances of his friendſhip and protection. He told him, he would meet with better accommodations, and as much ſecurity as in the mines; and that, ſhould he chance to be diſcovered, he would, with all his friends and vaſſals, take arms in his defence.</p><p>This offer was embraced by Guſtavus with joy, and he remained for ſome time at his friend’s house ; but finding it impoſſible to induce him to take part in his deſigns, he quitted him, and fled to one Peterſon, a gentleman whom he had formerly known in the ſervice. By him he was received with all the appearance of kindneſs ; and, on the very first propoſal made by Guſtavus, offered to raiſe his vaſſals. He even named the lords and peaſants whom he pretended to have engaged in his ſervice ; but in a very few days after, he went ſecretly to a Daniſh officer, and gave him information of what had paſſed. The officer immedi-<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0218.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0212"/>
ately cauſed the houſe to be ſurrounded with ſoldiers, in ſuch a manner that it ſeemed impoſſible for Guſtavus to make his eſcape. In the interval, however, he eſcaped, being warned by Peterſon’s wife of the treachery of her husband, and by her direction fled to the houſe of a clergyman, her friend. By him Guſtavus was received with all the reſpect due to his own birth and merit ; and left the domeſtic who conducted him ſhould follow the treacherous example of his master, he removed him to the church, and conducted him to a ſmall cloſet, of which he kept the key. Having lived for ſome time in this manner, Guſtavus began to consult with his friend concerning the moſt proper method of putting their ſchemes in execution. The prieſt advised him to apply directly to the peaſants themſelves ; told him that it would be proper to spread a report, that the Danes were to enter Dalecarlia in order to eſtabliſh new taxes by force of arms ; and as the annual feaſt of all the neighbouring villages was in a few days to be held, he could not have a more favourable opportunity : at the ſame time he promised to engage the principal perſons of the dioceſe in his intereſt.</p><p>Agreeable to this advice Guſtavus ſet out for Mora, where the feaſt was to be held. He found the peaſants already informed of his designs, and impatient to see him. Being already prepossessed in his favour, they were ſoon excited to an enthuſiaſm in his cauſe, and inſtantly reſolved to throw off the Daniſh yoke. In this deſign they were more confirmed by their ſuperſtition ; ſome of their old men having obſerved that the wind had blown from the north while Guſtavus was ſpeaking, which among them was reckoned an infallible omen of ſucceſs. Guſtavus did not give their ardour time to cool, but inſtantly led them againſt the governor’s caſtle ; which he took by aſſault, and put the garriſon to the ſword. This inconsiderable enterpriſe was attended with the moſt happy conſequences. Great numbers of the peaſants flocked to his ſtandard ; ſome of the gentry openly eſpouſed his cauſe, and others ſupplied him with money. Chriſtian was ſoon acquainted with what had paſſed ; but deſpising ſuch an inconſiderable enemy, he ſent only a ſlender detachment under the command of one Soren Norby, to aſſiſt his adherents in Dalecarlia. Guſtavus advanced with 5000 men, and defeated a body of Danes commanded by one Meleen ; but he was ſtrenuouſly oppoſed by the archbishop of Upſal, who raiſed numerous forces for king Chriſtian. The fortune of Guſtavus, however, ſtill prevailed, and the archbiſhop was defeated with great loſs. Guſtavus then laid siege to Stockholm ; but his force being too inconſiderable for ſuch an undertaking, he was forced to abandon it with loſs.</p><p>This check did not prove in any conſiderable degree detrimental to the affairs of Guſtavus; the peaſants from all parts of the kingdom flocked to his camp, and he was joined by a reinforcement from Lubec. Chriſtian, unable to ſuppreſs the revolt, wreaked his vengeance on the mother and sisters of Gustavus, whom he put to death with the moſt excruciating torments. Several other Swediſh ladies he cauſed to be thrown into the ſea, after having impoſed on them the inhuman taſk of making the ſacks into which they were to be incloſed. His barbarities ſerved only to make his enemies more reſolute. Guſtavus having aſſembled the ſtates at Wadſtena, he was unanimouſly choſen regent, the diet taking an oath of fidelity to him, and promising to aſſiſt him to the utmoſt. Having thus obtained the ſanction of legal authority, he purſued his advantages againſt the Danes. A body of troops appointed to throw ſuccours into Stockholm were totally cut in pieces ; and the regent sending ſome troops into Finland, ſtruck the Danes there with ſuch terror, that the archbiſhop of Upſal, together with Slahog and Baldenacker the Daniſh governors, fled to Denmark. Chriſtian received them but very coldly, apprehending that their flight might be prejudicial to his affairs ; and in a ſhort time the two governors were put to death, that the king might have an opportunity oſ charging them with being guilty oſ the cruelties which they had committed by his order. He then ſent expreſs orders to all his governors and officers in Finland and Sweden to massacre the Swediſh gentry without distinction. The Swedes made repriſals by massacring all the Danes they could find ; ſo that the whole country was filled with bloodſhed and ſlaughter.</p><p>In the mean time Guſtavus had laid ſiege to the towns of Calmar, Abo, and Stockholm; but Norby found means to oblige him to raiſe all of them with great loſs. Guſtavus, in revenge, laid ſiege to the capital a third time, and petitioned the regency of Lubec for a ſquadron of ſhips and other ſuccours for carrying on the ſiege. This was complied with, but on very hard conditions, viz, that Guſtavus ſhould oblige himſelf, in the name of the ſtates, to pay 60,000 merks of ſilver as the expence of the armament ; that, until the kingdom ſhould be in a condition to pay that ſum, the Lubec merchants trading to Sweden ſhould be exempted from all duties on imports or exports ; that all other nations ſhould be prohibited from trading with Sweden, and that ſuch traffic ſhould be deemed illicit ; that Guſtavus ſhould neither conclude a peace, nor even agree to a truce, with Denmark, without the concurrence of the regency of Lubec ; and that in caſe the republic ſhould be attacked by Chriſtian, he ſhould enter Denmark at the head of 20,000 men. Upon theſe hard terms did Guſtavus obtain aſſiſtance from the regency of Lubec ; nor did his dear-bought allies prove very faithful. They did not indeed go over to the enemy ; but in a ſea-fight, where the Danes were entirely in the power of their enemies, they ſuffered them to eſcape, when their whole force might have been entirely deſtroyed. This treachery had well nigh ruined the affairs of Guſtavus ; for Norby was now making preparations effectually to relieve Stockholm ; in which he would probably have succeeded : but at this critical period news arrived that the Danes had unanimouſty revolted, and driven Chriſtian from the throne ; and that the king had retired into Germany, in hopes of being reſtored by the arms of his brother-in law the emperor. On hearing this news, Norby retired with his whole fleet to the iſland of Gothland, leaving but a ſlender garriſon in Calmar. Guſtavus did not fail to improve this opportunity to his own advantage, and quickly made himſelf maſter of Calmar. Mean time Stockholm continued cloſely inveſted ; but Guſtavus thought proper to protract the ſiege until he ſhould get himſelf elected king. Having for this purpoſe called a general diet, the firſt ſtep was to fill up the vacany in the ſenate occaſioned by the maſſacres of Chriſtian. Gustavus had the addreſs to get ſuch nominated as were in his intereſt ; and of conſequence the assembly was no ſooner met, than a ſpeech was made, containing the higheſt encomiums on Guſtavus, ſetting forth in the ſtrongeſt light the many eminent ſervices he had done for his country, and concluding that the ſtates would ſhow themſelves equally ungrateful and blind to their own intereſt if they did not immediately elect him king. This propoſal was acceded to by ſuch tumultuous acclamations that it was impoſſible to collect the votes ; ſo that Guſtavus himſelf acknowledged, that their affection exceeded his merit, and was more agreeable to him than the effects of their gratitude. He was urged to have the ceremony of his coronation immediately performed : but the king having ſome deſigns on the clergy, did not think proper to comply with their requeſt, as he would have been obliged to take an oath to preſerve them<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0219.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0213"/>
in their rights and privileges.—Indeed he had not been long ſeated on the throne before he incurred the displeaſure of that body ; for having large arrears due to the army, with ſeveral other incumbrances, Guſtavus found it neceſſary to raiſe large contributions on the clergy. On this he was accuſed of avarice and hereſy before the pope’s nuncio. Guſtavus took the proper methods for defending himſelf againſt theſe accuſations; and in a ſhort time after ſhowed a great partiality for the doctrines of Luther, which by this time had been preached and received by many people in Sweden. This embroiled him more than ever with the eccleſiaſtics ; and it ſoon appeared, that either Guſtavus muſt reſign his throne, or the clergy ſome part of the power they had aſſumed. Matters were driven to extremities by the king’s allowing the ſcriptures to be translated into the Swediſh language. In 1526, the king, finding them entering into a combination againſt the reformiſts, went to Upſal, and publicly declared his reſolution of reducing the number of oppreſſive and idle monks and prieſts, who, under pretence of religion, fattened on the ſpoils of the induſtrious people. At laſt, taking advantage of the war between the pope and Charles V. of Spain, he declared himſelf to be of the reformed religion, and eſtabliſhed it throughout his dominions ; and at the ſame time, to humble the arrogance of the eccleſiaſtics, he gave the ſenators die precedency of them, and in many other reſpects degraded them from the dignities they formerly enjoyed. For ſome time the ſtates heſitated at ſupporting the king in his work of reformation ; inſomuch, that at laſt he threatened to reſign the kingdom, which, he ſaid, was doomed to perpetual ſlavery either to its temporal or ſpiritual tyrants. On this the ſtates came into his measures, and retrenched the privileges of the eccleſiaſtics in the manner he propoſed. Several diſturbances, however, enſued. An impoſtor, who pretended to be of the family of Sture the former regent, having claimed the throne, the Dalecarlians revolted in his favour ; but on the approach of a powerful army ſent by Guſtavus, they ſubmitted to his terms. Soon after, Lutheran profeſſors were eſtabliſhed in every dioceſe ; upon which a new rebellion enſued. At the head of this was Thure Johanſon, who had married the king’s ſiſter. Several of the nobility joined him ; and the king of Denmark alſo acceded to their cauſe, thinking, by means of theſe diſturbances, to reunite the three kingdoms of Sweden, Denmark, and Norway, as they had formerly been. But Gustavus prevailed, and the rebels were obliged to take refuge in Denmark. A freſh accident, however, had like to have embroiled matters worſe than before. The ſubſidy granted to the regency of Lubec was ſtill due ; and for the payment of <hi rend="italic">it</hi> the ſtates granted to the king all the uſeleſs bells of the churches and monaſteries. The people were ſhocked at the ſacrilege ; and the Dalecarlians again betook themſelves to arms. Intimidated, however, by the courage and vigorous conduct of the king, they again ſubmitted, and were taken into favour. But tranquillity was not yet reſtored. Chriſtian having eſtabliſhed a powerful intereſt in Norway, once more made an attempt to recover his kingdoms, and was joined by the Dalecarlians ; but being defeated; by the Swediſh forces, he was forced to return to Norway, where, being obliged to capitulate with the Daniſh generals, he was kept priſoner all his life.</p><p>In 1542, Guſtavus having happily extricated himſelf out of all his troubles, prevailed on the ſtates to make the crown hereditary in his family ; after which he applied himſelf to the encouragement of learning and commerce. A treaty was ſet on foot for a marriage between his eldeſt son Eric and Elizabeth queen of England. The prince’s brother, duke John, went over to England, and resided for ſome</p><p>time at the court of London with great ſplendour. He returned, full of expectations of ſucceſs ; but bringing with him no sort of proofs in writing, his father ſoon perceived that he had been the dupe of Elizabeth’s ſuperior policy. However, at laſt he allowed Prince Eric to go in perſon to England; but before he could embark, the death of Guſtavus made him lay aside all thoughts of the voyage and marriage.</p><p>Guſtavus Vaſa died in 1560, and was ſucceeded by his ſon Eric XIV. The new king was a man poſſessed of all the exterior ornaments which give an air of dignity to the perſon; but he had neither the prudence nor the penetration of his father. He created the firſt nobility that were ever known in Sweden ; which he had no ſooner done than he quarrelled with them, by paſſing ſome acts which they thought derogatory to their honour and dignity. The whole courſe of his reign was diſturbed by wars with Denmark, and diſputes with his own ſubjects. In the former he was unfortunate, and towards the latter he behaved with the greateſt cruelty. At laſt, by the torments of his own conſcience, it is ſaid, he run mad. He afterwards recovered his ſenſes, but was thereupon dethroned by his brothers ; of whom Duke John, who had been hitherto kept priſoner by Eric, ſucceeded him in the kingdom.</p><p>This revolution took place in the year 1568, but with no great advantage to Sweden. Diſputes about religion between the king and his brothers, and wars with Muſcovy, threw matters into the utmoſt confusion. At laſt prince Sigiſmund, the king’s ſon, was choſen king of Poland, which proved the ſource of much trouble to the kingdom. He was elected on the following conditions, viz. That there ſhould be a perpetual peace between the ſtates of Poland and Sweden ; that, on the death of his father, prince Sigiſmund ſhould ſucceed to the throne of Sweden ; that, on urgent occaſions, he might, with the conſent of the ſtates, return to Sweden; that he ſhould maintain, at his own expence, a fleet for the ſervice of Poland ; that he ſhould cancel a debt which had been long due from the crown of Poland to Sweden ; that, with the conſent of the ſtates, he ſhould build five fortresses on the frontiers of Poland ; that he ſhould have liberty to introduce foreign ſoldiers into the kingdom, provided he maintained them at his own expence ; that he ſhould not make uſe of Swediſh counſellors in Poland ; that he ſhould have his body-guard entirely of Poles and Lithuanians ; and that he ſhould annex to Poland that part of Livonia now ſubject to Sweden. In 1590 king John died ; and as Sigiſmund was at a diſtance, every thing fell into the utmoſt confuſion : the treaſury was plundered, and the wardrobe quite ſpoiled, before even duke Charles could come to Stockholm to take the adminiſtration into his hands until king Siſgiſmund ſhould return. This, however, was far from being the greateſt diſaſter which befel the nation at this time. It was known that the king had embraced the Popish religion, and it was with good reaſon ſuſpected that he would attempt to reſtore it upon his arrival in Sweden. Sigiſmund alſo was obliged, on leaving Poland, to promiſe that he would stay no longer in Sweden than was neceſſary to regulate his affairs. Theſe circumſtances ſerved to alienate the minds of the Swedes from their ſovereign even before they ſaw him ; and the univerſal diſſatisfaction was increaſed, by seeing him attended, on his arrival in Sweden in 1593, by Malaſpina the pope’s nuncio, to whom he made a present of 30,000 ducats to defray the expences of his journey to Sweden.</p><p>What the people had foreſeen was too well verified : the king refuſed to confirm the Proteſtants in their religious privileges, and ſhowed such partiality on all occaſions to the Papiſts, that a party was formed againſt him ; at the head<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0220.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0214"/>
of which was duke Charles his uncle. Remonſtrances, accompanied with threats, took place on both ſides ; and at an interview between the king and Charles, the diſpute would have ended in blows, had they not been parted by ſome of the nobility. This, however, made ſuch an impression upon Sigiſmund, that he was apparently reconciled to his brother, and promiſed to comply with the inclinations of the people in every reſpect, though without any inclination to perform what he had promiſed. The agreement, indeed, was ſcarce made, before Sigiſmund conceived the horrid deſign of murdering his uncle at the Italian comedy acted the night after his coronation. The duke, however, having notice of the plot, found means to avoid it. This enraged the king ſo much, that he reſolved to accompliſh his designs by force ; and therefore commanded a Poliſh army to march towards the frontiers of Sweden, where they committed all the ravages that could be expected from an enraged and cruel enemy. Complaints were made by the Proteſtant clergy to the ſenate : but no other reply was made them, than that they ſhould abſtain from theſe bitter invectives and reproaches, which had provoked the Catholics, until the king’s departure ; at which time they would be at more liberty.</p><p>In 1595 Sigiſmund ſet ſail for Dantzic, leaving the adminiſtration in the hands of duke Charles. The conſequence of this was, that the diſſenſions which had already taken place being continually increaſed by the obſtinacy of the king, duke Charles aſſumed the ſovereign power ; and in 1604 Sigiſmund was formally depoſed, and his uncle Charles IX. raised to the throne. He proved a wife and brave prince, reſtoring the tranquillity of the kingdom, and carrying on a war with vigour againſt Poland and Denmark. He died in 16l1, leaving the kingdom to his ſon, the celebrated Guſtavus Adolphus.</p><p>Though Charles IX. by his wife and vigorous conduct had in a great meaſure retrieved the affairs of Sweden, they were ſtill in a very diſagreeable ſituation. The finances of the kingdom were entirely drained by a series of wars and revolutions ; powerful armies were preparing in Denmark, Poland, and Ruſſia, while the Swediſh troops were not only inferior in number to their enemies, but the government was deſtitute of reſources for their payment.</p><p>Though the Swediſh law required that the prince ſhould have attained his 18th year before he was of age, yet ſuch ſtriking marks of the great qualities of Guſtavus appeared, that he was allowed by the ſtates to take upon him the adminiſtration even before this early period. His firſt act was to reſume all the crown-grants, that he might be the better able to carry on the wars in which he was unavoidably engaged ; and to fill all places, both civil and military, with perſons of merit. At the head of domeſtic and foreign affairs was placed chancellor Oxenſtiern, a person every way equal to the important truſt, and the chooſing of whom impresſed mankind with the higheſt opinion of the young monarch’s penetration and capacity.</p><p>Soon after his acceſſion, Guſtavus received an embaſſy from James I. of Britain, exhorting him to make peace with his neighbours. This was ſeconded by another from Holland. But as the king perceived that the Daniſh monarch intended to take every opportunity of cruſhing him, he reſolved to act with ſuch vigour, as might convince him that he was not eaſily to be overcome. Accordingly he broke into Denmark with three different armies at once ; and though the enemy’s ſuperiority at ſea gave them great advantages, and the number of the king’s enemies distracted his attention, he carried on the war with ſuch ſpirit, that in 1613 a peace was concluded upon good terms. This war</p><p>being finiſhed, the king applied himſelf to civil polity, and made ſome reformations in the laws of Sweden. In 1615, hoſtilities were commenced againſt Ruſſia, on account of the refuſal of that court to reſtore ſome money which had been formerly lent them. The king entered Ingria, took Kexholm by ſtorm, and was laying ſiege to Pleſcow, when, by the mediation of James I. peace was concluded, on condition of the Russians repaying the money, and yielding to Sweden ſome part of their territory. In this and the former war, notwithſtanding the ſhortneſs of their duration, Guſtavus learned the rudiments of the military art for which he ſoon became ſo famous. He is said, indeed, to have catched every opportunity of improvement with a quickneſs of underſtanding ſeemingly more than human. In one campaign, he not only learned, but improved, all the military maxims of La Gardie, a celebrated general, brought the Swediſh army in general to a more ſteady and regular diſcipline than had formerly been exerciſed, and formed and ſeaſoned an invincible body of Finlanders, who had afterwards a very conſiderable ſhare in the victories of the Swedes.</p><p>Peace was no ſooner concluded with Ruſſia, than Guſtavus was crowned with great ſolemnity at Upsal. Soon after this, Guſtavus ordered his general La Gardie to acquaint the Poliſh commander Codekowitz, that as the truce between the two kingdoms, which had been concluded for two years, was now expired, he deſired to be certainly informed whether he was to expect peace or war from his maſter. In the mean time, having borrowed money of the Dutch for the redemption of a town from Denmark, he had an interview on the frontiers with Chriſtian the king of that country. At this interview, the two monarchs conceived the utmost eſteem and friendſhip for each other ; and Guſtavus obtained a promiſe, that Chriſtian would not aſſiſt Sigiſmund in any deſigns he might have againſt Sweden. In the mean time, receiving no ſatisfactory answer from Poland, Guſtavus began to prepare for war. Sigiſmund entered into a negotiation, and made ſome pretended conceſſions, with a view to ſeize Guſtavus by treachery ; but the latter having intimation of his deſign, the whole negotiation was changed into reproaches and threats on the part of Guſtavus.</p><p>Immediately after this, Guſtavus made a tour in diſguiſe through Germany, and married Eleonora the daughter of the elector of Brandenburg. He then reſolved to enter heartily into a war with Poland ; and with this view ſet ſail for Riga with a great fleet, which carried 20,000 men. The place was well fortified, and defended by a body of veterans enthuſiaſtically attached to Sigiſmund. A dreadful bombardment enſued ; the ſtreets were raked by the cannon, and the houſes laid in aſhes by the bombs ; the moat was filled up, one of the half-moons taken by ſtorm, and the ſtrong fortreſs of Dunamund was reduced. The cannon having now effected a breach in another part of the walls, Guſtavus reſolved to make a general aſſault. For this purpoſe a flying bridge over the moat was contrived by his majeſty ; for though the ditch was filled with faſcines and rubbiſh, it ſtill contained too much water to admit the pasſage of a large body of men. The ſoldiers, however, crowded on to the attack with ſo much impetuoſity, that the bridge gave way, and the attempt proved unſucceſsful. Next day the Swedes were repulſed in attempting to ſtorm another half-moon ; and the king was obliged to proceed more ſlowly. By the middle of September, at which time the town had been inveſted for six weeks, two bridges were thrown over the river together with a ſtrong boom, while the Swedes had formed their mines under the ditch. The garriſon being now reduced to extremity, were obliged to<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0221.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0215"/>
capitulate ; and Guſtavus treated the inhabitants with great clemency.</p><p>After the reduction of Riga, the Swediſh monarch entered Courland, where he reduced Mittau ; but ceded it again on the concluſion of a truce for one year. Sigiſmund, however, no sooner had time to recover himſelf, than he be ran to form new enterpriſes againſt the Swedes in Prusſia ; but Guſtavus ſetting ſail with his whole fleet for Dantzic, where the king of Poland then reſided, ſo broke his meaſures, that he was obliged to prolong the truce for another year. Sigiſmund, however, was not yet appriſed of the danger he was in, and refuſed to liſten to any terms of accommodation : upon which Guſtavus entering Livonia, defeated the Poliſh general, and took Derpt, Hockenhauſen, and ſeveral other places of leſs importance ; after which, entering Lithuania, he took the city of Birſen.</p><p>Notwithſtanding this ſucceſs, Guſtavus propoſed peace on the ſame equitable terms as before ; but Sigiſmund was ſtill infatuated with the hopes that, by means of the emperor of Germany, he ſhould be able to conquer Sweden. Guſtavus finding him inflexible, reſolved to puſh his good fortune. His generals Horn and Thurn defeated the Poles in Semigallia. Guſtavus himſelf with 150 ſhips let ſail for Pruſſia, where he landed at Pillaw. This place was immediately delivered up to him ; as were alſo Braunſherck, Frawenberg, Elbing, Marienberg, Mew, Dirſchau, Stum, Chriſtburg, &amp;c. Sigiſmund, alarmed at the great ſucceſſes of Guſtavus, ſent a body of forces to oppoſe him, and to prevent Dantzic from falling into his hands. In this he was attended with as bad ſucceſs as before. His troops were defeated before Marienberg, Mew, and Dirſchau; and in May 1627, Guſtavus arrived with freſh forces before Dantzic, which he would probably have carried, had he not been wounded in the belly by a cannon-ſhot. The Poles in the mean time recovered Mew ; and the States of Holland ſent ambaſſadors to mediate a peace between the two crowns. Sigiſmund, however, depending upon the assiſtance of the emperor of Germany and king of Spain, determined to hearken to no terms, and reſolved to make a winter campaign ; but Guſtavus was ſo well intrenched, and all his forts were ſo ſtrongly garriſoned, that the utmoſt efforts of the Poles were to no purpoſe<note anchored="true" n="1" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="smallcaps">(a)</hi> In this campaign the practice of duelling became ſo prevalent in the Swediſh army, as to engage the king’s attention, and to oblige him to ſuppreſs it by very rigorous edicts. Soon after theſe were paſſed, a quarrel arose between two general officers, who aſked his majeſty’s permiſſion to decide their difference by the laws of honour. The king conſented, but wiſhed to be a ſpectator of their courage. He went to the place appointed, attended by a body of guards :and having ordered the executioner to be called, “ Now gentlemen, ſaid he to the officers, fight until one dies ;” adding to the excutioner, “ Do you immediately cut off the head of the other.” On this the quarrel was dropped, and no more challenges were heard of in the camp.</p></note> (<hi rend="smallcaps">a).</hi> The city of Dantzic in the mean time made ſuch a deſperate reſiſtance as greatly irritated Guſtavus. In a ſea-engagement the Swediſh fleet defeated that of the enemy ; after which Guſtavus, having blocked up the harbour with his fleet, puſhed his advances on the land-ſide with incredible vigour. He made a ſurpriſing march over a moraſs 15 miles broad, aſſiſted by bridges of a peculiar conſtruction, over which he carried a ſpecies of light cannon invented by himſelf. By this unexpected manœuvre he got the command of the city in ſuch a manner, that the garriſon were on the point of ſurrendering, when, by a sudden ſwell of the Viſtula, the Swediſh works were ruined, and the king was obliged to raiſe the siege. In other reſpects, however, the affairs of Guſtavus went on with their uſual good fortune. His general Wrangel defeated the Poles before Brodnitz, of whom 3000 were killed, and 1000 taken priſoners, with five pieces of cannon and 2000 waggons loaden with provisions. At Stum the king gained another and more considerable victory in perſon. The emperor had ſent 5000 foot and 2000 horſe under Arnheim, who joined the main army commanded by the Poliſh general Coniecſpolſki, in order to attack the Swediſh army encamped at Quidzin. The enemy were ſo much ſuperior in number, that the friends of Guſtavus represented to him the imminent danger of attacking them. But the king being determined, the engagement began. The Swediſh cavalry charged with ſuch impetuoſity, contrary to their ſovereign’s expreſs order, that they were almoſt surrounded by the enemy ; but Guſtavus, coming up to their aſſiſtance, puſhed the enemy’s infantry with so much vigour, that they gave way, and retreated to a bridge they had thrown over the Werder. But here they were diſappointed ; for the Swedes had already taken poſſeſſion of the bridge. On this a new action enſued more bloody than the former, in which the king was expoſed to great danger, and thrice narrowly eſcaped being taken priſoner ; but at laſt the Poles were totally defeated, with the loſs of a great many men, 22 pair of colours, five ſtands, and ſeveral other military trophies. The ſlaughter of the German auxiliaries was ſo great, that Arnheim ſcarce carried off one half of the troops he brought into the field. This defeat did not hinder the Poliſh general from attempting the siege of Stum ; but here again he was attended by his uſual bad fortune. The garriſon ſallied out, and he was defeated with the loſs of 4000 men. The blame of this misfortune was laid upon Arnheim ; who was recalled, and ſucceeded by Henry of Saxe Lawenburg and Philip count Mansfeldt. The change of general officers, however, produced no good conſequences to the Poles ; a famine and plague raged in their camp, ſo that they were at laſt obliged to conſent to a truce for six years, to expire in the month of June 1635. The conditions were, that Guſtavus ſhould reſtore to Sigiſmund the towns of Brodnitz, Stum, and Dirſchau ; that Marienberg ſhould remain ſequeſtrated in the hands of the elector of Brandenburg, to be reſtored again to Sweden in case a peace was not concluded at the end of the six years. Guſtavus, on his side, kept the port and citadel of Memel, the harbour of Pillau, the town of Elbing, Brunſberg, and all that he had conquered in Livonia.</p><p>Guſtavus having thus brought the war with Poland to an honourable concluſion, began to think of relenting the conduct of the emperor in aſſiſting his enemies and oppreſſing the Proteſtant ſtates. Before embarking in ſuch an important undertaking, it was neceſſary that he ſhould conſult the diet. In this the propriety of engaging in a war with Germany was warmly debated ; but, after much altercation, Guſtavus in a very noble ſpeech determined the matter, and ſet forth in ſuch ſtrong terms the virtuous motives by which he was actuated, that the whole assembly wept, and every thing was granted which he could require.</p><p>It was not difficult for Guſtavus to begin his expedition. His troops amounted to 60,000 men, hardened by a ſucceſſion of ſevere campaigns in Ruſſia, Finland, Livonia, and Pruſſia. His fleet exceeded 70 ſail, carrying from 20 to 40 guns, and manned with 6000 mariners. Embarking<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0222.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0216"/>
his troops, he landed at Uſedom on the 24th of June 1630, the Imperialiſts having evacuated all the fortreſſes they posſed there ; and the iſle of Rugen had been before reduced by general Leſly, in order to ſecure a retreat if fortune ſhould prove unfavourable. Paſſing the frith, Guſtavus ſtormed Wolgaſt and another ſtrong fortreſs in the neighbourhood, leaving general Bannier with a garriſon for the defence of theſe conqueſts. He then proceeded to Stetin ; which was no ſooner inveſted than it conſented to receive a Swediſh garriſon, and the king perſuaded the duke of Pomerania to enter into an alliance with him. In conſequence of this the Swediſh troops were received into ſeveral towns of Pomerania ; and the moſt bitter enmity took place between the Imperialiſts and Pomeranians, each refusing the other quarter.</p><p>Theſe ſucceſſes of Guſtavus ſtruck the empire with consternation ; for being already overwhelmed with civil diſſenſions, they were in no condition to reſiſt ſo impetuous an enemy. At this time alſo the Imperialiſts were without a general, the command of the army being diſpnted by a number of candidates of very unequal merit ; but at laſt count Tilly was fixed upon as the moſt proper perſon, and inveſted with the dignity of Veldt Mariſchal. In the mean time the king being reinforced by a conſiderable body of troops in Finland and Livonia under the conduct of Guſtavus Horn, defeated the Imperialiſts before Griffenhagen; taking the place ſoon after by aſſault. By this and ſome other conqueſts he opened a paſſage into Luſatia and Sileſia ; but in the mean time count Tilly cut off 2000 Swedes at New Brandenburg, owing to the obſtinacy of their commander Kniphausen, who had orders to evacuate the place and join the main army. This advantage, however, was ſoon overbalanced by the conqueſt of Franckfort on the Oder, which Guſtavus took by aſſault, making the whole garriſon priſoners. Thus he commanded the rivers Elbe and Oder on both ſides, and had a fair paſſage not only to the countries already mentioned, but alſo to Saxony and the hereditary dominions of the houſe of Auſtria. Soon after this, Guſtavus laid ſiege to Landſberg, which he took by aſſault ; though the number of ſoldiers he had with him was ſo inconſiderable, that he had thoughts of ſending to the main army for a reinforcement before the priſoners ſhould march out, being apprehenſive that they might give him battle in the open field, though they could not defend themſelves behind walls.</p><p>About this time the Proteſtant princes held a diet at Leipſic ; to which Guſtavus ſent deputies, and conducted his negotiations with ſuch addreſs, as tended greatly to promote his intereſts. Immediately after this he reduced Gripſwald, and with it all Pomerania. Then marching to Guſtrow, he reſtored the dukes of Mecklenburg to their dominions. Here the Imperialiſts had tyrannized in ſuch a manner that Guſtavus was received as the deliverer of the people ; and the ceremony of the duke’s inauguration was in a ſhort time performed with great solemnity.</p><p>All this time count Tilly was employed in the siege of Magdeburg ; but now, being alarmed at the repeated ſucceſſes of the Swedes, he left Pappenſheim with part of the army before that city, while he marched with the rest into Thuringia, to attack the landgrave of Hesse-Cassel and the elector of Saxony. After a moſt obſtinate defence, Magdeburg fell into the hands of Pappenheim, where he committed all imaginable cruelties. Guſtavus formed a plan of recovering the city ; but was obliged to abandon it, by Pappenheim’s throwing himſelf into the place with his whole army, and by the progreſs which Tilly was making in Thuringia. Relinquiſhing this enterpriſe, therefore, he ordered Bannier to attack Havelsburg ; which was done with ſuch reſolution, that the place was forced in a few hours, and all the garriſon made priſoners. Werben was next obliged to ſubmit after an obſtinate conflict, in which many fell on both ſides.—Theſe ſucceſſes obliged count Tilly to attempt in perſon to check the progreſs of the Swedes. He detached the vanguard oſ his army, compoſed of the flower of the Imperial cavalry, within a few miles of the Swediſh camp. An action enſued, in which Bernſtein the Imperial general was defeated and killed, with 1000 of his men. Guſtavus, after this advantage, placed himſelf in a ſituation ſo much ſuperior to his enemies, that count Tilly was fired with indignation, and marched up to the Swediſh lines to give him battle. Guſtavus kept within his works, and Tilly attacked his camp, though almoſt impregnably fortified, keeping up a moſt terrible fire from a battery of 32 pieces of cannon ; which, however, produced no other effect, than obliging the Swediſh monarch to draw up his army behind the walls of Werben. Tilly had placed his chief hopes in being able to nail up the enemy’s cannon, or ſet fire to their camp in divers quarters ; after which he <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> propoſed making his grand attack. With this view he bribed ſome priſoners ; but they betrayed him, and told his deſign to Guſtavus. The king ordered fives to be lighted in different parts of his camp, and his ſoldiers to imitate the noiſe of a tumultuous diſorderly rabble. This had the deſired effect. The count led his army to the breach made by the cannon ; where he was received with ſuch a volley of grape ſhot as cut off the firſt line, and put the whole body in diſorder, ſo that they could never be brought back to the charge. In this confuſion the Imperial army was attacked by Bauditzen, and, after an obſtinate conflict, obliged to quit the field.</p><p>Soon after this action the queen arrived at the camp with a reinforcement of 8000 men ; at the ſame time a treaty was concluded with Charles I. of England, by which that monarch allowed the marquis of Hamilton to raiſe 6000 men <hi rend="italic">for</hi> the ſervice of Guſtavus. Theſe auxiliaries were to be conducted to the main army by a body of 4000 Swedes; and were in every thing to obey the king while he was personally preſent, but in his abſence were to be ſubject to the orders of the marquis. With theſe troops the king had reſolved to make a diverſion in Bremen : but the marquis finding it impoſſible for him to effect a junction with the Swediſh army, reſolved, without debarking his troops, to steer his courſe for the Oder, and land at Uſedom. Guſtavus was very much diſpleaſed at finding his project thus diſconcerted ; however, making the beſt of the preſent circumſtances, he commanded the Britiſh troops to act on the Oder inſtead of the Weſer. The number oſ this little army was magnified exceedingly by report, inſomuch that count Tilly had some thoughts of marching againſt them with his whole force; but on the departure of the marquis for Sileſia, he reinforced the army in that country with a large detachment, which was thought to contribute not a little to the defeat he ſoon after received.</p><p>Ever ſince the late action Guſtavus had kept within his intrenchments, where his army was well provided with every thing. Tilly made ſeveral attempts to ſurpriſe or draw him to an engagement ; but finding all his endeavours fruitleſs, he marched into Saxony, and laid ſiege to Leipſic. This precipitate meaſure proved highly advantageous to the Swediſh monarch ; as thus the elector, who had been wavering in his resolutions, was now obliged to have recourſe to the Swedes, in order to preſerve himſelf from utter deſtruction. A treaty offenſive and defensive was immediately concluded with Guſtavus: and the elector willingly promised everything that was required of him; and among tire rest, that not only the prince his ſon, but he himſelf,<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0223.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0217"/>
ſhould reſide in the Swediſh camp, and engage his life and fortune in the common cauſe. Tilly, in the mean time, carried fire and ſword into the unhappy electorate. At the head of an army of 44,000 veterans, he ſummoned the city of Leipſic to ſurrender ; denouncing the same vengeance againſt it as had been executed on Magdeburg, in case of a refuſal. By this the governor was ſo much intimidated, that he inſtantly ſubmitted ; and alſo ſurrendered the caſtle of Passenberg, which was in a condition to have stood out till the arrival of the Swediſh army. The elector, enraged at the loss of theſe valuable places, ordered his army to join the Swedes with all expedition, and preſſed the king ſo warmly to engage, that at laſt he yielded to his desire. On the 7th of September 1631, Guſtavus led out his army in the moſt beautiful order, the Swedes forming one column on the right, and the Saxons another on the left ; each amounting to 15,000 men. Tilly drew up his men in one vaſt column, poſſibly with a view of ſurrounding the flanks of the king’s army ; but every officer of experience in his army, from the excellency of the Swediſh diſpoſition, prognoſticated the event of the engagement. Guſtavus led on the troops againſt that wing of the Imperialiſts commanded by Pappenheim, whom be drove back to ſuch a diſtance, that he gained a point of the wind ; by which the ſmoke fell upon their enemies and conſiderably embarraſſed them, at the ſame time that the Swedes were got without the reach of a battery which played furiouſly on their flank. General Bannier in the mean time cut in pieces the troops of Holſtein, and mortally wounded the duke who commanded them. Pappenheim led on his troops ſeven times to the charge, in hopes of regaining his former ſituation ; but was as often repulſed by the Swedes. Tilly all this while engaged with the Saxons ; but having at laſt driven them off the field, the whole ſtrength of the Imperial army was turned upon the Swediſh left wing commanded by General Horn. The Swedes ſuſtained the attack with the greateſt firmneſs, until the king detached general Teuffel with the centre to assiſt them. The Imperialiſts then were no longer able to ſtand their ground ; but gave way everywhere except in the centre, which was compoſed of 18 regiments of veterans accuſtomed to victory, and deemed invincible. They made incredible efforts to maintain the reputation they had acquired ; and, though ſwept off in great numbers by the Swediſh artillery, never ſhrunk or fell into confuſion. Four regiments, after their officers had been killed, formed themſelves, and retired to the ſkirt of a wood; where they were all to a man cut in pieces, without demanding quarter. Tilly retired at the head of 600 men, and eſcaped by the coming on of the night. Seven thouſand Imperialiſts lay dead on the field of battle ; 4000 were taken priſoners ; a fine train of artillery was lost, with upwards of 100 ſtandards, enſigns, and other military trophies.—On this occasion it was that the Scots regiment in the Swediſh ſervſee firſt practiſed the method of firing in platoons ; to which ſome aſcribe the aſtoniſhment and confuſion that appeared in the Imperial army. It is thought, however, that the Swediſh monarch diſplayed greater abilities in gaining this victory than improving it afterwards ; for had he marched immediately to Vienna, before his enemies had time to recover their conſternation, it is ſuppoſed that the emperor would have been obliged to abandon his capital, and leave his hereditary dominions to the mercy of the conqueror. But Guſtavus apprehended that Tilly might fall upon the Saxons while he was ravaging the Auſtrian hereditary dominions; which would have deprived him not only of an ally, but of the free quarters which the elector had promiſed to his troops in case of a retreat. For this and ſome other reaſons he determined to penetrate into Franconia, where he reduced ſeveral places, particularly the fortreſs of Workburg. Tilly having collected his ſcattered troops, which formed an army ſtill ſuperior in number to that of Guſtavus, marched to the relief of this place ; but came too late. He then directed his march towards Rottenberg, where four regiments were cut in pieces by a Swediſh detachment. After this the king reduced Hanau, Franckfort on the Maine, and Mentz ; deſtroying a body of Spaniards, who had thrown themſelves in his way to obſtruct his paſſage.</p><p>The court of Vienna was now thrown into the utmoſt confuſion ; and sent everywhere begging aſſiſtance, and soliciting the Catholic princes to arm in defence of their religion. The emperor was moſt embarraſſed in finding out a general capable of oppoſing Guſtavus in the field ; for the late misfortunes of count Tilly had entirely ſunk his reputation. Walleſtein, an old experienced officer, was made choice of ; but as he had formerly been disgraced, it was apprehended that he would not accept of the command of which he had once been deprived. This objection, however, was got over ; and Walleſtein not only accepted of the command, but, at his own expence, augmented the army to 40,000 men.</p><p>During the whole winter the Swediſh army kept the field ; and before the approach of ſummer had reduced Crantznach, Bobenhauſen, Kirchberg, Magdeburg, Cozlar, Northeim, Gottingen, and Dunderſtadt ; while the landgrave William made great progreſs in Weſtphalia. Guſtavus Horn was repulſed before Bamberg ; but ſoon had his revenge, by entirely deſtroying two regiments of Imperialiſts. To prevent the troops from being affected by the loss before Bamberg, the king reſolved to give battle to Tilly, who was marching into Bavaria to prevent the Swedes from gaining a footing in that electorate. He pursued the Imperial general through a vaſt tract of country, defeated his rear-guard, and, having reduced a variety of towns and fortreſſes on the Danube, penetrated as far as Ulm. Advancing to the river Leck, count Tilly poſted himſelf in a wood on the oppoſite side, to diſpute his passage. Guſtavus endeavoured to diſlodge him by a regular fire from 70 pieces of cannon. The ſlaughter was dreadful ; and Tilly himſelf, being wounded by a cannon-ball in the knee, died a few days before he was to have been ſuperſeded by Walleſtein. The following night the Imperial army evacuated the poſt; part retiring to Ingoldſtadt, and others to Newburg. Guſtavus immediately croſſed the river, and ſeized the towns of Rain and Newburg, which the enemy had abandoned. Augſiburg next ſubmitted ; and from the inhabitants oſ this place Guſtavus exacted an oath of fidelity, not only to himſelf but to the crown of Sweden. This meaſure gave the greateſt offence to many of the Germanic body, and made them imagine that the king of Sweden had other views than the defence of the Proteſtant cauſe.</p><p>From Augſburg the Swedes advanced towards Ratiſbon ; but were diſappointed in their deſign of getting poſſeſſion of that city, by reaſon of the Bavarians having thrown a very numerous garriſon into the place.—In the mean time, ambaſſadors arrived from Denmark, offering the mediation of that crown for obtaining a laſting peace between the contending parties. Guſtavus, however, replied, that no ſuch peace could take place till the Catholic princes thought proper to grant the Proteſtants full and ample ſecurity for their enjoyment of future tranquillity. But the ambaſſadors had no inſtructions to propoſe any thing farther, and thus the negotiation vaniſhed. Guſtavus now, reſolving to retort upon themſelves the cruelties which the Bavarians had inflicted on the Proteſtants, laid the towns of Morzbourg, Frieſengen, and Lardſhut, in aſhes. The inhabitants of Munich ſaved themſelves by ſubmiſſion; but as the peaſants in that<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0224.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0218"/>
neighbourhood had collected themſelves into bodies in order to murder the ſtragglers from the Swediſh army, Guſtavus burnt their houſes, and defeated the forces of the elector, who had been joined by a conſiderable body of militia.</p><p>While Guſtavus was thus employed, Walleſtein had aſsembled a vaſt army. He was ſtrongly ſolicited by the elector of Bavaria to come to his aſſiſtance ; but, in revenge of the elector’s having formerly obtained the command for count Tilly in preference to himſelf, he drew off towards Bohemia to encounter the Saxons. Arnheim, who commanded the Saxon forces in that place, was the enemy of Guſtavus, who had formerly rallied him for his cowardice. He therefore permitted Walleſtein to gain an eaſy victory, in hopes that his maſter, the elector of Saxony, a prince entirely devoted to his pleaſures, might be induced to relinquiſh the friendſhip of ſuch a reſtleſs and warlike ally as Guſtavus ; and indeed he uſed all the eloquence of which he was maſter to detach him from the Swediſh cauſe. Several advantages, in the mean time, were gained by the Imperialiſts. Pappenheim defeated the archbiſhop of Bremen’s cavalry at Werden ; and three Swediſh regiments were cut off near Kadingen. Pappenheim, however, was forced to retire, and withdraw his forces from Stade ; of which the Swedes took poſſeſſion. Walleſtein and the elector of Bavaria, who had now joined their forces, threatened Guſtavus with greatly ſuperior numbers. At laſt, however, the king, being reinforced with 15,030 men, no longer declined the engagement ; but Walleſtein was too wise to truſt the fate of the empire to a ſingle engagement againſt ſuch an enemy as the king of Sweden. Guſtavus attacked his camp, but was repulſed with the loss of 2000 men ; which caused a general murmuring and diſcontent againſt his raſhness. Several other misfortunes happened to the Swedes ; and at laſt, after various manœuvres, Walleſtein bent his course towards Misnia, in order to oblige the elector of Saxony to declare againſt the Swedes, and to draw them out of Bavaria, Guſtavus, notwithſtanding the inconſtancy of Auguſtus, immediately ſet out to aſſiſt him. With incredible diligence he marched to Miſnia, where the Imperialiſts were aſſembling their whole ſtrength. Hearing that the enemy were encamped at Wesenfells, and that Pappenheim had been detached with a ſtrong corps, Guſtavus reſolved to engage them before they could effect a junction. With this view he marched to Lutzen, where he attacked Walleſtein with incredible fury. The Swediſh infantry broke the Imperialiſts in ſpite of their utmoſt efforts, and took all their artillery. The cavalry not being able to paſs the river ſo expeditiouſly as the king thought necessary, he led the way, attended only by the regiment of Srnaaland and the duke of Saxe-Lauwenburg. Here, after charging impetuouſly, he was killed, as Puffendorff alleges, by the treachery of the duke ; who, being corrupted by the emperor, ſhot him in the back during the heat of the action. The news of his death was in an inſtant ſpread over both armies. The courage of the Imperialiſts revived, and they now made themſelves ſure of victory. But the Swedes, eager to revenge the death of their beloved monarch, charged with ſuch fury that nothing could reſiſt them. The Imperialiſts were defeated a ſecond time, juſt as Pappenheim, with his freſh corps, came up to their aſſiſtance. On this the battle was renewed, but the Swedes were ſtill irreſiſtible. Pappenheim was mortally wounded, and his army finally routed, with the loſs of 9000 killed in the field and in the pursuit.</p><p>The victory of Lutzen proved more unfortunate to Sweden than the greateſt defeat. The crown devolved upon Chriſtina, an infant of six years old ; the nation was involved in an expenſive foreign war, without any perſon equal to the arduous taſk of commanding the armies, or regulating domeſtic affairs, as Guſtavus had done. However, Chriſtina the daughter of Guſtavus was immediately proclaimed queen. The regency devolved on the grand bailiff, the mariſchal, the high-admiral, the chancellor, and the treaſurer of the crown. Oxenſtiern was inveſted with the chief management of affairs, and conducted himſelf with the greateſt prudence. He was greatly embarraſſed indeed by the diviſions among the Proteſtant princes, which became more violent after the death of Guſtavus ; but, in ſpite of all difficulties, he went on purſuing the intereſt of his country, and planning the means of retaining the Swediſh conqueſts. Matters went on pretty ſucceſsfully till the year 1634, when, through the raſhneſs of the Swediſh ſoldiers, they were defeated at Nordlingen, with the lois of 6000 men killed on the ſpot, a number of priſoners, and 1 30 ſtandards, with other military trophies, taken by the enemy. Oxenſtiern’s conſtancy was ſhaken by this dreadful blow ; but he applied himſelf diligently to repair the loſs, by recruiting the army, and rendering the allies faithful. The latter proved the moſt difficult taſk. The death of Guſtavus, and the defeat at Nordlingen, had thrown them into deſpair ; and every one was desirous of making the beſt terms he could with the emperor. The Saxons not only renounced their alliance with Sweden, but openly commenced war againſt it ; and though the regency would gladly have conſented to an honourable peace, the enemy were now too much flushed with ſucceſs to grant it. Oxenſtiern had no other reſource than an alliance with France, and the bravery of his generals. In 1635, he went in perſon to the court of Louis, and concluded a treaty ; which, however, anſwered no purpoſe, as it was never obſerved. The enemy, in the mean time, pushed their good fortune. They ſurpriſed Philipſburg, where the French had laid up vaſt magazines; and reduced Spires, Augſhurg, Treves, Wurtſburg, Cobourg, and ſome other places. To complete the misfortunes of Sweden, it was expected that the Poles would immediately invade Pruſſia. To prevent this, La Gardie was diſpatched thither with a powerful army ; but as it was impoſſible to reſiſt ſo many enemies at once, the chancellor purchaſed the friendſhip of Poland for 26 years by ceding that duchy to the republic. Thus he got rid of a powerful enemy ; and the Swediſh affairs began to revive by a victory which general Bannier gained over the Saxons, in conſequence of which they were driven beyond the Elbe.</p><p>Early in the ſpring of 1636, the Saxons made ſome motions as if they intended to cut off Bannier’s communication with Pomerania. This he prevented by a ſtratagem ; defeated a body of the enemy ; and obliged the Saxons to retire. Soon after this he drove them out of their winter-quarters with conſiderable loſs ; at which time alſo a conſiderable body of Imperialiſts who came to their aſſiſtance were diſperſed. In Weſtphalia general Kniphauſen beat the Imperialiſts with the loſs of 1500 men, but he himſelf was killed in the purſuit, and his army obliged to repaſs the Weser. Some advantages were alſo gained in the neighbourhood of Minden by General Leſly, who had assembled a conſiderable army. In Alface, Bernard duke of Saxe-Weymar defeated count Gallas the Imperial general, and diſperſed his army. Eut vzhen every thing ſeemed thus ſucceſsful for the Swedes, the city of Magdeburg, contrary to the expectation of every body, ſurrendered for want of powder, which the garrison had wantonly conſumed. The Saxons alſo made ſome conqueſts on the Elbe, which obliged Bannier to recal general Lesly from Weſtphalia to marcl againſt them. The Saxons fixed on a moſt convenient ſituation, whence they hoped to deſtroy the Swediſh army with out coming to a battle. But Bannier, reſolving to hazard<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0225.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0219"/>
everything rather than ſuffer his army to be waſted by famine, advanced towards Perleberg, a place cloſely blocked up by the enemy. Here he drove from an advantageous poſt four regiments oſ Saxon cuiraſſiers, having killed or taken priſoners 400 men ; after which he ſoon forced them to a general engagement. The numbers were very unequal, Bannier’s army amounting to 9000 horſe and 7000 foot, and the Saxons to 15,000 horſe and 13 battalions of foot. The battle began with great fury ; the right wing of the Swedes was almost oppreſſed by numbers before the left could come to their assiſtance. They were ten times driven back, and as often returned to the charge. At last they made ſuch a deſperate effort, that the enemy were entirely broken and defeated. Five thouſand were killed on the ſpot, 3000 wounded, and as many taken priſoners, together with 150 colours and ſtandards, and ſeveral pieces of cannon.</p><p>Thus ended the campaign of 1636, in a manner highly honourable to the Swedes. Some fruitleſs negotiations were ſet on foot during the winter ; but theſe coming to nothing, Bannier quitted his winter-quarters very early in the ſeaſon ; and falling upon eight regiments of Saxons cantoned at Eulenburg, purified them to Torgau, where he obliged them to ſurrender at diſcretion. Another party of Saxons was defeated in the neighbourhood of Leipſic ; after which he propoſed inverting that city. But in this project he was diſappointed by the Imperralists penetrating into Thuringia. He then called in all his detachments, with a view to prevent them from croſſing a river named <hi rend="italic">Sala ;</hi> but in this alſo he was diſappointed. However, he had the good fortune to defeat 2000 Imperialists near Pegau, and to deſtroy ſeveral detachments that attempted to obstruct his march. Yet, notwithſtanding all theſe ſucceſſes, Bannier found his ſituation every day more straitened, from the continual increaſe of the enemy’s forces ; which obliged him at last to retreat into Pomerania, out of which he ſoon drove count Gallas.</p><p>The affairs of the Swedes were now once more reduced to the brink of ruin, through the unguarded conduct of general Wrangel, who had alſo an army in Pomerania. After Bannier had driven count Gallas out of the province as above mentioned, Wrangel, imagining himſelf perfectly ſecure, cantoned his troops, and extended his quarters, the better to accommodate his army. But Gallas, being informed of this proceeding, ſuddenly returned, ravaged all Upper Pomerania, and reduced the towns of Uſedom, Demmin, and Wollin ; after which, leaving garriſons in the fortreſſes, he returned to his winter-quarters in Saxony.</p><p>This unfortunate campaign counterbalanced all the advantages of the former. Wrangel was ſo struck with the ſuddenneſs of the blow, that he could take no meaſures for oppoſition. Some of the Swediſh allies again fell off, and took up arms against them. In 1638, the Swediſh affairs again began to revive in this quarter, through the excellent conduct of Bannier, who defeated count Gallas with the loſs of 3000 men killed and taken priſoners. Pursuing his good fortune, he ſo harassed the count, that he obliged him in great haste to repaſs the Elbe, and take ſhelter in the hereditary dominions of Austria. Great as Bannier’s exploits had been, however, they were eclipſed by thoſe of duke Bernard. That general had ſo increaſed his army in the Proteſtant cantons of Switzerland, and in Franche Comte, that he found himſelf in a condition to act without the aſſistance of the French, who indeed were but treacherous allies. Advancing to the Rhine, he ſeized on Seckingen and Lassuburg, and laid ſiege to Rheinfield. The Imperialists, in conjunction with the troops of Bavaria, advanced to the relief of the place. An engagement enſued, in which the victory was diſputed : the enemy threw ſuccours into the city, and the duke withdrew his army. Within a month he gave them battle a ſecond time; and ſo completely defeated them, that only one Imperial officer above the rank of a captain eſcaped being killed or taken priſoner. He then renewed the ſiege of Rheinfield ; which he reduced, as well as ſeveral other important places. Advancing to Briſac, he blocked it up with a deſign of forcing the garrison to ſurrender by famine. General Gotz, with 12,000 men, attempted to throw in 1000 waggons of proviſions; but he was defeated, with the loſs of all his men except 2500. Duke Charles of Lorrain, with 4000 men, joined the remains of Gotz’s army, in order to relieve the town ; but being ſurpriſed by Bernard, his whole army was cut in pieces. A third attempt was made by Gotz, but it proved as unſucceſsful as the former ; and the place being reduced to great ſtraits, was obliged to capitulate.</p><p>In January 1639, the two victorious generals Bernard and Bannier prepared to attack the enemy on their own ground. Bannier made an irruption into the territories or Anhalt and Halberstadt. Leaving his infantry behind, he puſhed on with his cavalry, and ſurpriſed Salis, grand-maſter of the Imperial artillery. After a bloody conflict, the Swedes gained a complete victory, ſeven regiments of the enemy being cut in pieces. Next entering Saxony, he defeated four regiments of the enemy, obliging a much larger body to take ſhelter under the cannon of Dreſden. Hearing that the Saxons were encamped near Chemnitz, where they waited to be joined by the Imperialists, he reſolved to attack them before this junction could be effected. The ſame good fortune still attended his arms, and the Saxons were almost all killed or taken. Bannier next entering into Bohemia, laid the country under contribution ; after which, returning croſs the Elbe, he fell on general Hofskirk, who was encamped near Brandeiz with 10 regiments of horſe and ſeveral battalions of foot. Him he defeated with the loſs of 2000 men. The remains of the Imperial forces were purſued to the walls of Prague, and the generals Hofskirk and Montecuculi were taken priſoners. Yet, notwithstanding theſe constant ſucceſſes, the enemies of Bannier multiplied daily. He had expected an inſurrection in his favour in Sileſia or Bohemia ; but no ſuch event took place. The Protestant princes, overawed by the enemy, did not ſend him the neceſſary aſſistance. Undiſmayed, however, by difficulties or danger, Bannier performed wonders. He defeated a body of Imperialists at Glatz ; three times he drove the Saxons from their camp at Firn ; and yet was forced to evacuate the place, becauſe he could not ſpare a garriſon. His army being deftitute of the means of recruiting, was conſiderably diminiſhed in number ; yet with it he reduced a number of towns, and obtained a variety of other important advantages, when on a ſudden all his hopes were blasted by the death of the duke of Saxe-Weymar ; poiſoned, as was ſuppoſed, by the French, who were deſirous of getting the town of Briſac into their hands, from which the duke prevented them.</p><p>The difficulties to which Bannier was now reduced proved extreme. The French monarch took upon him to diſpoſe of the army and conqueſts of Bernard as he thought proper. Briſac, and other places of importance, be kept to himſelf ; after getting poſſession of which, the French endeavoured, as much as poſſible, to ruin the army. In the mean time, the Imperial army under Piccolomini, in the Netherlands, was prodigiouſly augmented ; and the archduke Leopold-William, in quality of generaliſſimo, was assembling his whole strength to cruſh the Swedes at once. Bannier, however, did not deſpair. George duke of Lunenburg having conceived ſome diſgust at the emperor, Bannier hoped<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0226.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0220"/>
to gain him over: he therefore approached nearer to his country ; by which alſo he drew towards the armies of Weymar and Hesse. In his way he cut in pieces a body of 3000 Croats. General Konigſmark routed the Imperialiſts at Gera ; a second time at Scholen ; and a third time entirely defeated them near Leipſic. Bannier was very preſſing on the allies to join him ; and at laſt, in 1640, he was joined by the Weymar army under the dukes of Longueville and Gubrien, a body of Russians led by general Melander, and the troops of Lunenburgh commanded by general Klitzing. The army now amounted to 22 battalions of infantry and 22,000 horſe ; ſo that they were much more than a match for their enemies, had they been under the ſole direction of Bannier. But unanimity was wanting ; every one would be ſupreme in the command ; and Bannier, the beſt general of them all, had the leaſt influence. Inſtead of thoſe maſterly and deciſive ſtrokes by which the Swedes had hitherto diſtinguiſhed themſelves, the armies continued looking at one another, each ſuffering the rigours of famine. At laſt Bannier, reſolving to expoſe his troops no longer, ſet out for Thuringia, through Franconia, to ſeize an advantageous poſt on the Maine ; but as he advanced to the Sala, he found the Imperialiſts entrenched on the other side. Finding it impoſſible to force a passage, he took the road through Hesse, where his troops ſuffered greatly by famine. Here he propoſed to fight the enemy ; but the Landgrave and duke of Lunenburg refuſed their conſent. Upon this he threatened to leave them to the mercy of the confederates, and thus obliged them to be ſomewhat more pliant. None of thoſe brilliant ſuccesses, however, now attended the operations of the Proteſtant allies : the campaigns of 1640 and 1641 were ſpent in uſeleſs marches and countermarches ; ſerving only to bring the army into the greateſt dangers, from which they were as conſtantly relieved by the active and intrepid Bannier. At laſt this brave general, worn out with perpetual fatigues, died of a fever in the year 1641, leaving the Swediſh army in a worſe ſituation than ever.</p><p>The Imperialiſts were too well acquainted with the abilities of Bannier, not to take advantage of the opportunity offered by his death. A Swediſh detachment was cut in pieces at Quidlenberg. The Swediſh army, accuſtomed only to be obedient to Bannier, became mutinous, and Piccolomini reſolved to fall upon them with his whole force. But the four generals, Wrangel, Konigſmark, Wittemberg, and Pful, having convinced the ſoldiers of the neceſſity of defending themſelves, made ſuch excellent diſpositions, that the Imperialiſts durst not attack them. Piccolomini then detached part of his army to attack the Heſſians in their quarters ; but Wrangel and Konigſmark threw themſelves in their way, and defeated them with the loſs of 2000 mem This victory, however, did not retrieve the Swediſh affairs. Dissenſions and mutiny began again to take place in the army to ſuch a degree as threatened its diſſolution. In 1642 general Torenſton was ſent from Sweden, with a large ſum of money and a ſtrong reinforcement, to take upon him the ſupreme command. This general was inferior in abilities to none of his predecessors, and deſigned without loſs of time to come to an engagement ; but the Weymar army ſeparating from him, put an end to that deſign, and obliged him to remain for a considerable time inactive. He was also confined to his chamber for ſome time by a dangerous gout ; and thus a report of his death being ſpread, the Imperialiſts were encouraged to begin a long march through roads ſcarce passable, in hopes of ſurpriſing the Swediſh army without a general. Torſtenſon having intelligence of this, ſeized an advantageous poſt, which could not be forced; and thus obliged the enemy to retreat, after having ſuffered as much by their fatiguing march as if they had fought a bloody battle. Then joining general Stalhanch, who had been driven by the Imperialiſts out of Sileſia, he reduced the town of Great Glogau, with a number of other important places ; after which he laid siege to Schweidnitz. The duke of Saxe-Lawenburgh, at the head of all his cavalry, endeavoured to throw in ſuccours ; but was defeated with the loss of 3000 men. He himſelf was taken priſoner, and died of chagrin a few days after. In conſequence of this defeat Schweidnitz ſurrendered at diſcretion ; and Torſtenſon having ſent a detachment to inveſt the city of Neisse, proceeded with the reſt to drive the enemy entirely out of Sileſia. This he effectually performed ; obliging them to retire over barren mountains, almoſt famished for want of proviſions, and haraſſed by his light troops ; ſo that this lately formidable army was almoſt entirely ruined. With his victorious troops the Swediſh general then poured into Moravia ; where, in five days, he reduced the ſtrong town of Olmutz (which not long ago ſuſtained a ſiege of as many weeks by the late king of Pruſſia). Litta and Newſtadt ſhared the ſame fate ; after which, the Swedes, returning ſuddenly to Sileſia, made themſelves matters of Oppelein and Brieg, and laid ſiege to Breslau. Here the garriſon made ſuch an obſtinate defence, that the Imperialiſts had time to assemble under the conduct of the archduke Leopold, and come to their relief. As Torſtenſon was greatly inferior in number, he raised the ſiege ; but appeared ſo formidable in his retreat, that the enemy durſt neither attack him, nor attempt to prevent his encamping in a very advantageous ſituation. The Imperialiſts took this opportunity of laying ſiege to Glogau ; but after having loſt a great number of men, they were forced to abandon the enterpriſe on the junction of Wrangel with Torſtenſon ; by which means the Swedes were once more in a condition to face their enemies in the field.</p><p>Torſtenſon now projected an irruption into Bohemia, and putting his army into winter-quarters in that country ; but in this he was prevented by the vigilance of the enemy : however, he reduced the city of Zittau, where, for the firſt time, a cartel for priſoners was eſtabliſhed ; by which means the Swediſh army was conſiderably augmented. Thus diſappointed in his deſigns on Bohemia, Torſtenſon directed his courſe to Leipſic, which he intended to inveſt. The Imperial generals aſſembled their whole force, and ſet out to relieve that important place. The two armies ſoon came in sight of each other ; and a furious cannonading was the prelude to a general engagement. A ſingle bullet had almoſt proved fatal to the Swediſh cauſe. It carried away the furniture of Torſtenſon’s horſe, killed the count Palatine’s horſe, pierced general Rabenau through the body, took off the head of a celebrated counſellor named <hi rend="italic">Crabbe,</hi> and carried away the leg of a private ſoldier. The Swedes, as ſoon as the armies came up, behaved with their wonted reſolution, and after an obſtinate conflict obtained a complete victory ; 5000 of the enemy being killed on the fpot, 3000 wounded, and as many taken priſoners. This victory was followed by the immediate ſurrender of Leipſic ; and in all probability the Swedes would have finally triumphed over all their enemies, had not a rupture with Denmark enſued. Torſtenſon and Horn behaved with their uſual valour in Holſtein and Schonen, while general Konigſmark diſtinguiſhed himſelf in Germany ; but the ruin of the Weymar army, which was totally defeated with the loſs of one half its number at Dettingen by the Bavarians, proved a dreadful blow, from which the Swedes could ſcarce recover themſelves. Indeed, notwithſtanding the valour and ſucceſs of the Swedes, their affairs in Germany muſt have gone to wreck in the campaigns of 1643, had not the<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0227.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0221"/>
French under Condé and Turenne made a moſt powerful diverſion, and performed ſuch exploits as immortalized the names of theſe two generals.</p><p>In 1645, the war againſt Denmark was puſhed with ſuch vigour, that a peace, very honourable and advantageous for Sweden, was concluded ; and thus Torſtenſon was again at liberty to act againſt the Imperialiſts. He now took meaſures for carrying the war into the heart of the Auſtrian dominions. Hatfield assembled a conſiderable army to oppoſe the Swedes ; and the emperor came in perſon to Prague to animate his troops. The two armies came in sight at Jancowitz, and both prepared for an engagement. The valour of the Swedes once more prevailed; and they totally defeated their enemies. Four thouſand of the Imperialiſts were killed on the ſpot, among whom were general Hatfield and a great number of officers ; and near 5000 were taken prisoners. No great advantages, however, were derived from this victory. Some towns indeed were reduced ; but at laſt Torſtenson was obliged to retire into Moravia, where he put his army into winter-quarters ; and in the beginning of the year 1646 reſigned the command to Wrangel.</p><p>The new general conducted the Swediſh affairs with great ability and ſucceſs ; till at laſt the Imperialiſts, finding themſelves finally unable to drive the Swedes out of Germany, concluded a peace with them in 1648. This was the memorable treaty of Weſtphalia, by which the Germanic conſtitution was settled upon its ancient principles, and thoſe implacable diſputes which had ſo long torn the empire were ended ; the duchies of Bremen and Verden, all the Upper and part of Lower Pomerania, the city of Wiſmar and the iſle of Rugen, were aſſigned to Sweden, and a gratification of five millions of crowns was given to the army.</p><p>Sweden now enjoyed ſome years oſ repoſe. Charles Guſtavus, count Palatine, having gained the favour of Chriſtina, was appointed generaliſſimo of the forces, and heir-apparent to the crown. A marriage was propoſed between them ; but the queen would never liſten to this or any other propoſal of the kind. In 1650, the ceremony of the queen’s coronation was performed ; but in four years thereafter, ſhe reſigned the crown in favour of Guſtavus. (See the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Christina).</hi></p><p>The new king found himſelf involved in conſiderable difficulties on his acceſſion to the throne. The treaſury was quite exhauſted ; great part of the revenue was appointed for the ſupport of Chriſtina’s houſehold ; the people were oppressed with taxes ; and the nation having been diſarmed for ſeveral years, began to loſe its reputation among foreigners. To remedy theſe evils, Charles propoſed to reſume all the crown lands which had been alienated by grants to favourites during the late reign ; to repeal a duty which had been laid upon salt ; to put the kingdom in a poſture oſ defence ; and to enter upon a war with ſome neighbouring ſtate. Under a pretence, therefore, that Caſimir king of Poland had queſtioned his title to the throne, he began to make preparations for invading that kingdom. Several embaſſies were ſent from Poland to Stockholm ; but ſome point of ceremony always diſappointed them of an audience of the king ; ſo that they were obliged to return without their errand. As ſoon as matters were in readinels, General Wittemberg made an irruption into Poland from the side of Pomerania. The Poles oppoſed him with an army of 15,000 men ; but inſtead of fighting, they began to negotiate, and in a ſhort time entirely diſperſed themſelves. Charles himſelf ſoon followed with a powerful army, and purſued his march without obſtruction, all the cities throwing open their gates to him as he approached, and offering to ſupply him with necessaries. As he advanced to Cracow, Caſſimir reſolved to make one effort to save his capital. His army amounted only to 10,000 men ; and theſe were unfortunately ſuch as had never stood fire. After a feeble reſiſtance, they fled with precipitation, having loſt 1000 men killed and taken priſoners. A few days after this Charles deſeated the Poles a ſecond time, about eight leagues from Cracow ; upon which Caſimir fled with his family to Oppelen in Sileſia. The capital was then inverted ; and though defended with the utmoſt valour by Stephen Czarneſki, was in a ſhort time obliged to capitulate. Thus in leſs than three months Charles apparently became maſter of Poland ; but it ſoon became evident that the Poles had no intention of abandoning their former ſovereign.</p><p>In 1656 a war took place with the elector of Brandenburg. While Charles was employed in the conqueſt of Poland, that prince had invaded the Royal and Ducal Prusſia, and reduced the moſt conſiderable towns with little oppoſition. The king of Sweden took umbrage at his progreſs ; and having marched againſt him, deſeated his forces in ſeveral slight encounters, and obliged him to own that he was a vasſal of Sweden. Theſe rapid conqueſts alarmed all Europe ; and the different powers ſought for means of driving the Swedes out of Poland, which they had ſo unexpectedly and unjuſtly ſeized. The Poles were no ſooner aſſured that they ſhould be aſſiſted, than they everywhere revolted and massacred the Swedes. Caſimir returned from Sileſia ; and thoſe very troops and generals who had before ſubmitted to Charles without oppoſition, now ranged themſelves under the banners of his antagoniſt. Charles immediately marched from Pruſſia to chaſtiſe the inſolence of the Poles, and totally defeated a body of 12,000 men under the command of Czarneſki. This did not hinder all the Poles incorporated with his troops to deſert ; which conſiderably reduced his army ; and the campaign being performed in the depth of winter, he was at laſt obliged to retreat to Pruſſia. In his march he was haraſſed by the Poles ; and a body of 4000 Swedes was ſurpriſed and defeated by them at Warka. This loſs, however, was ſoon after recompenſed by a complete victory gained by Adolphus the king’s brother and General Wrangel over Czarneſki. In the mean time the king was taking meaſures for laying ſiege to Dantzic ; but was prevented by the Dutch, who threatened to oppoſe him, unleſs a proper regard was paid to their intereſt. Charles accordingly granted them advantageous terms ; and afterwards gained over the elector of Brandenburg, by ceding to him the ſovereignty of Pruſſia, that he might be at liberty to turn his whole ſtrength againſt Poland.</p><p>By the treaty just concluded with the elector, the latter was to aſſiſt Charles in his war with Poland ; but the elector had ſo procraſtinated matters, that the Poles, having obtained aſſiſtance from the Tartars, had reduced the city of Warſaw. The two princes, however, now marched in concert againſt their enemies, who were encamped in a ſtrong ſituation in the neighbourhood of the city above-mentioned, their camp being fronted by the Viſtula. The Poles were driven from their entrenchments with prodigious slaughter, and a vaſt number taken priſoners. The Poles and Tartars then laboured to break the alliance ; with which view they entered Ducal Pruſſia, and defeated the electoral army, taking prince Radzivil and other perſons of diſtinction priſoners. The Swedes ſoon had their revenge. General Steinbock attacked the ſame Poliſh army at Philippowa, and overthrew it with ſuch ſlaughter as obliged the Poles for that ſeaſon to quit the field. A more formidable enemy than the Poles now began to make them appearance. The Russians invaded the provinces oſ Carelia, Ingermania, and<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0228.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0222"/>
Livonia ; while the elector of Brandenburg began to waver in his fidelity. To preſerve this only ally at ſuch a critical juncture, Charles was obliged to give him more advantageous terms than thoſe already mentioned ; while the Russians were repulſed in the provinces of Carelia and Ingermania. But in Lavonia they had better ſucceſs, two important fortreſſes falling into their hands ; after which they laid ſiege to Riga. For ſeven months they battered the walls of this city, without once venturing to paſs the ditch or ſtorm the practicable breaches. The beſieged, under the command of Magnus de la Gardie and Simon Helmfield, defended themſelves with the greateſt intrepidity ; cutting off many thouſands of the enemy in the ſallies they made. At laſt they attacked the Russian camp, drove them out of it with great ſlaughter, and obliged them to raiſe the ſiege with precipitation.</p><p>Charles, notwithſtanding the number of his enemies, was now become ſo formidable by the valour and diſcipline of his troops, that whole armies often fled on the very news of his approach. At laſt, in 1657, the Poles, finding they could not reſiſt him in the field, contented themſelves with harassing the Swedes on their march, and cutting off the foragers and convoys. This proved much more deſtructive to the Swedes than their former method ; ſo that Charles was obliged to enter into an alliance with Ragotſki prince of Tranſylvania, by aſſigning him certain provinces in his neighbourhood, in order to furniſh himſelf with irregular troops, who might fight the Poles in their own way. This, however, proved of no real advantage ; for the confederates, after ſpending a whole campaign in Lithuania, were obliged to return without accompliſhing more than the reduction of a single fortreſs ; upon which Charles returned with the Swediſh army to Pruſſia.</p><p>Leopold, the young king of Hungary, having beheld for a long time the Swedes with a jealous eye, now reſolved to declare for Poland. The more effectually to curb the ambition of the Swediſh monarch, he ſolicited the king of Denmark to come to a rupture with him. This was inſtantly complied with, and the Danes invaded Bremen- Charles haſtened to oppoſe this new enemy ; which gave ſuch offence to Ragotſki, that he neglected to take the proper meaſures for his own defence in the abſence of the Swedes, and ſuffered his army to be deſtroyed by the Poles and Tartars. At the ſame time the Turks invaded Tranſylvania, under pretence that Ragotſki, being a vassal of the Grand Signior, had no right to invade Poland without his leave. Ragotſki oppoſed them in the field ; where he was defeated and killed, leaving Charles deſtitute of the only ally on whom he could have depended.</p><p>The king, however, not diſmayed by this misfortune, traverſed Pomerania and the duchy of Mecklenburg ; after which he fell upon Holſtein, while general Wrangel with another corps entered the duchy of Bremen. The latter executed his meaſures with the utmoſt vigour and intrepidity. In 15 days he retook all the towns which the enemy had reduced ; defeated and drove the Danish army out of the country, killing 3000 of their best ſoldiers. In Holſtein the king reduced ſeveral fortreſſes, laid Itzehoe in aſhes, defeated a body of Danes, and laid ſiege to Frederic-Udda, into which the Danes had thrown a ſtrong garriſon. The conduct of this ſiege he left to Wrangel, he himſelf retiring to Wiſmar in order to obſerve the ſituation of affairs in Poland ; but no ſooner was he gone than Wrangel attacked the place with ſuch fury, that he became maſter of it in two hours. In the province of Halland the Swedes were defeated ; but the enemy derived no advantage from their victory : at ſea the fleets met, and maintained a hot engagement for two days, without any conſiderable advantage on either side. In Poland matters went on much worse. The houſe of Auſtria had now declared for Casimir ; a German army entered Poland, and reduced Cracow, though not without great loss to themſelves. Czarneſki entered Pomerania, where he butchered the unhappy peaſants without mercy ; but on the approach of Charles he fled as uſual, having gained nothing by his expedition but the character of a cruel barbarian.</p><p>The king of Sweden was now ſurrounded by enemies, The elector of Brandenburg had declared againſt him ; and he had beſides to engage the armies of Auſtria, Poland, Russia, and Denmark, in the field. In this dangerous ſituation he reſolved to attack Denmark, in ſuch a manner as ſhould oblige that power to come to a ſpeedy accommodation. His deſigns were forwarded by a very early froſt, which enabled him to tranſport his troops without the expence and trouble of ſhipping. Having passed over on the ice to the iſland of Funen, he cut in pieces a body of 4000 Daniſh ſoldiers and 500 peaſants. The whole iſland was reduced in a few days ; after which he passed to Langland, then to Laaland, after that to Falſtre, and laſtly to Zealand. The Danes were terrified at this unexpected invaſion, and were giving themſelves up to deſpair, when Charles offered to conclude a peace upon equitable terms. The king of Denmark very gladly conſented ; but with a deſign to renew the war as ſoon as he thought it could be done with safety. By this treaty, called the <hi rend="italic">treaty of Roschild,</hi> concluded on the 12th of March 1658, the provinces of Schonen, Halland, and Bleking, Lyſter, and Huwen, the iſle of Borkholm, the bailliages of Bahus and Drontheim in Norway, were yielded to Sweden, and a free passage thro’ the Sound was granted to the Swediſh ſhips.</p><p>No ſooner was Charles retired, than the king of Denmark began to act againſt him in an underhand manner ; on which, reſolving to anticipate him in his deſigns, he appeared unexpectedly with a fleet before Copenhagen. Had he given the aſſault immediately, before the inhabitants had time to recover from their ſurpriſe, it would probably have ſurrendered at once ; but, by landing at the diſtance of 17 miles, he gave them time to prepare for their defence : the ſiege proved extremely tedious, and at laſt the place was relieved by a Dutch fleet. On this Charles converted ths ſiege into a blockade, which continued till the end of the war. Wrangel reduced the ſtrong fortreſs of Cronenburg ; and the Swediſh forces were ſo judiciouſly poſted, that all Denmark was in a manner blocked up ; when, in 1660, king Charles died of an epidemical fever : and thus an end was put, for that time, to all the ambitious deſigns of Sweden.</p><p>The new king Charles XI. was a minor at the time of his father’s death ; and as the kingdom was involved in a dangerous war with ſo many enemies, the regency determined to conclude a peace, if it could be obtained on reaſonable terms. A treaty was accordingly concluded at Oliva ; by which Caſimir renounced his pretenſions to the crown of Poland, and that republic gave up all pretenſions to Livonia. Bornholm and Drontheim were ceded to Denmark ; and an equivalent in Schonen remained with Sweden. During the minority of the king, nothing remarkable occurs in the hiſtory of Sweden. In 1672 he entered into alliance with Louis XIV. which two years after involved him in a war with the elector of Brandenburg. At first the Swedes carried all before them; and general Wrangel having fallen ſick, they continued their conqueſts under another named <hi rend="italic">Mardenfeldt.</hi> Almoſt all the towns in Brandenburg were reduced, when the elector arrived with an army to the relief of his diſtressed ſubjects. He retook ſeveral towns, defeated Mardenſeldt in a general engagement, and ſoon after forced them to abandon all their conqueſts. In conjunction<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0229.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0223"/>
with the panes, he then invaded the Swediſh dominions : many places of importance were reduced ; and, in 1676, Sweden received a moſt destructive blow by the defeat of her fleet in an engagement with the combined fleets of Denmark and Holland. Soon after this the king took the government into his own hands, and in ſome degree reſtored the fortune of Sweden ; but though matters went on in a more proſperous way where the king commanded in perſon, the ſame losses and disgrace attended the Swediſh arms in every other quarter. In Pomerania, count Konigſmark loſt every place of importance excepting Stralſund, Stetin, and Gripswald. In 1678, the Swediſh fleet was defeated in two engagements. At Landſcroon a moſt obſtinate battle was fought from ten in the morning till six at night ; when both parties were obliged, by their fatigue, to retire to their reſpective camps. At Oldeval in Norway, the Swedes were defeated ; and the Danes laid deſolate the islands of Oeland, Smaaland, Unno, and Kuno ; while the electoral troops and Imperialiſts reduced count Konigſmark to the utmoſt diſtreſs in the neighbourhood of Stralſund.</p><p>In this deplorable ſituation of affairs count Konigſmark found an opportunity of attacking his enemies to ſuch advantage, that he obtained a complete victory ; aſter which he ravaged the duchy of Mecklenburg. Yet notwithſtanding this ſucceſs, he could not prevent the elector from reducing Stralſund ; aſter whieh he was obliged to evacuate Pomerania ; and, to complete his diſtreſs, the fleet which tranſported the Swediſh army from Pomerania was wrecked on the coaſt of Bornholm ; by which accident 2000 perſons were drowned, and the remainder plundered and taken priſoners by the Danes, though they had been furniſhed with paſſports from king Frederic.</p><p>In this unproſperous ſituation of affairs a peace was concluded at St Germain’s between France and her enemies, by which the Swedes and Danes were left to decide their quarrel by themſelves. Denmark was by no means a match for Sweden, even in the diſtressed ſituation to which ſhe was reduced : for which reaſon a treaty was inſtantly concluded, on terms much more favourable to Sweden than could have been expected ; and the peace was confirmed by a marriage between Charles and Ulrica Eleonora, daughter to the king of Denmark. From this time the Swediſh monarch applied himſelf to the reformation of the ſtate ; and by artfully managing the diſputes between the nobility and peaſants, he obtained a decree of the ſtates empowering him to alter the conſtitution as he pleaſed. Being thus inveſted with abſolute power, he proceeded to take ſome very extraordinary meaſures. In 1685 it was projected to liquidate the public debts by raiſing the nominal value of money, without adding any thing to its intrinſic value. This was put in execution the following year, by which the creditors of the government loſt upwards of nine millions of crowns. This, with ſome other arbitrary ſteps taken about the ſame time, diſ guſted all the nobility, merchants, and crown-creditors. In Livonia they were highly relented ; and remonſtrances were repeatedly ſent by the hands of deputies, who had orders to insist upon their privileges confirmed by many acts of the king’s predecessors. The deputies could obtain nothing, ſo that the diet was assembled. On their report the body of nobility resolved to draw up a ſtronger remonſtrance than any of the former, to be preſented to the king by captain Patkul one of the deputies, who had already diſtinguiſhed himſelf by his boldneſs and attachment to liberty. His public ſpirit, however, produced no other effect than to procure his own deſtruction. An accuſation was drawn up againſt all the remonſtrants, but eſpecially Patkul. He was sentenced to loſe his right hand, then to be deprived of his life, honours, and eſtates ; to have the latter confiſcated to the crown, and his papers burnt by the hands of the common executioner. The accuſation was declared unjuſt by the univerſity at Leipſic ; but notwithſtanding this, Patkul was obliged to fly his country, to avoid the execution of his rigorous ſentence ; which, however, fell upon him with redoubled fury in the ſubſequent reign, of which an account is given under the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Patkul.</hi></p><p>On the 15th of April 1697, died Charles XI. leaving his crown to his ſon, the celebrated Charles XII. at that time a minor. On his acceſſion he found himſelf under the tuition of his grandmother Eleonora, who had governed the kingdom during the minority of the late king. Though Charles was at that time only 15 years of age, he inſtantly ſhowed a deſire of taking the government into his own hands. His counſellors, count Piper and Axel Sparre, ſignified his deſire to the queen-regent. They were by her referred to the ſtates ; and there all were unanimous : ſo that the queen, finding that oppoſition would be vain, reſigned her power with a good grace ; and Charles was inveſted with abſolute authority in three days after he had expressed his deſire of reigning alone. He was ſcarce ſeated on the throne when a powerful combination was formed againſt him. King Auguſtus of Poland formed deſigns on Livonia ; the king of Denmark revived the diſputes he had with the duke of Holſtein, as a prelude to a war with Sweden ; and Peter the Great of Muſcovy began to form deſigns upon Ingria, formerly a province of Ruſſia. In 1699 the king of Denmark marched an army into Holſtein. Charles ſent a conſiderable body of troops to the duke’s aſſiſtance ; but before their arrival the Danes had ravaged the country, taken the caſtle of Gottorp, and laid cloſe ſiege to Tonningen. Here the king of Denmark commanded in perſon ; and was aſſiſted by the troops of Saxony, Brandenburg, Wolfenbuttle, and Heſſe-Cassel. England and Holland, as guarantees of the laſt treaty with Denmark, in concert with Sweden, joined Charles againſt this confederacy, and ſent fleets to the Baltic. They propoſed a termination of the war upon equitable terms ; but theſe were haughtily refilled by the Daniſh monarch, who despised the youth and inexperience of Charles, and relied too much upon the alliance he had formed with Saxony, Brandenburg, Poland, and Ruſſia. The town of Tonningen, however, reſiſted all his efforts ; and when he ordered the place to be ſtormed, he had the mortification to see his troops driven headlong from the walls by a handful of Swedes under <hi rend="italic">general</hi> Bannier.</p><p>In the year 1700, Charles, having entruſted the affairs of the nation with a council choſen out of the ſenate, ſet out on the 8th May from his capital, to which he never afterwards returned. He embarked at Carlscroon, and defeated the fleet of the allies. Having made a deſcent on the island of Zealand, be defeated a body of cavalry that oppoſed his march, and then proceeded to inveſt Copenhagen by ſea and land. The king of Denmark then ſaw the neceſſity there was either of having his capital deſtroyed, or oſ doing juſtice to the duke of Holſtein. He choſe the latter ; and a treaty was concluded in eleven days, upon much the ſame terms as formerly. Charles, being thus at liberty to turn his arms againſt the other princes who had conſpired his deſtruction, reſolved to lead his army againſt Auguſtus king of Poland ; but on his way he received intelligence that the czar of Muſcovy had laid ſiege to Narva with 100,000 men. On this he immediately embarked at Carlſcroon, though it was then the depth of winter, and the Baltic ſcarce: navigable ; and ſoon landed at Pernaw in Livonia with part of his forces, the rest being ordered to Reval. His army did not exceed 20,000 men ; but they were the beſt ſoldiers in Europe, while the Russians were ∙ only an undiſciplined<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0230.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0224"/>
multitude. The czar, however, had thrown every poſſible obſtruction in the way of his antagoniſt. Thirty thousand men were poſted in a defile on the road, to oppoſe his paſſage ; and this corps was ſuſtained by a body of 20,000 others, poſted ſome leagues nearer Narva. The czar himſelf had ſet out to hasten the march of a reinforcement of 40,000 men, with whom he intended to attack the Swedes in flank and rear. But the celerity and valour of the Swedes baffled every endeavour. With 4000 foot and an equal number of horſe the king ſet out, leaving the reſt of the army to follow him at their leiſure. With theſe he attacked and defeated the Russian armies one after another, puſhing his way to the czar’s camp, which he gave immediate orders for attacking. This camp was fortified by lines of circumvallation and contravallation, by redoubts, by 150 pieces of braſs cannon placed in front ; and was defended by an army of 80,000 men : yet ſo violent was the attack of the Swedes, that in three hours the entrenchments were carried ; the king with 4000 men that compoſed the wing he commanded in perſon, purſued a flying army of 50,000 to the river Narva. The bridge broke down by the weight of the fugitives, and the river was inſtantly covered with their bodies. Great numbers returned in deſpair to their camp, where they defended themſelves for a while ; but at laſt the generals Gallowin and Frederowitz, who commanded them, ſurrendered. Thirty thouſand were killed in the intrenchments and in the purſuit, or drowned in the river ; 20,000 ſurrendered at diſcretion, and were diſmissed unarmed ; while the reſt were totally diſperſed. An hundred and fifty pieces of fine cannon, 28 mortars, 151 pair of colours, 20 ſtandards, and all the baggage of the enemy, were taken. Among the priſoners were the duke de Croy, the prince of Georgia, and ſeven other generals. Charles behaved with the greateſt generoſity to the conquered. Being informed that the tradeſmen of Narva had refuſed credit to the officers whom he detained priſoners, he ſent 1000 ducats to the duke of Croy, and to every other officer a proportionable ſum.</p><p>Peter was advancing with 40,000 men to ſurround the Swedes, when he received intelligence of the dreadful defeat at Narva. He was greatly chagrined ; but, comforting himſelf with the hopes that the Swedes would in time teach the Russians to beat them, he returned to his own dominions, where he applied himſelf with the utmoſt diligence to the raising of another army. He evacuated all the provinces which he had invaded, and for a time abandoned all his great projects, thus leaving Charles at liberty to proſecute the war againſt Poland.</p><p>As Auguſtus had expected an attack, he endeavoured to draw the czar into a cloſer alliance with him. The two monarchs had an interview at Birſen, where it was agreed that Auguſtus ſhould lend the czar 50,000 German ſoldiers, to be paid by Muſcovy ; that the czar ſhould ſend an equal number of his troops to be trained up to the art of war in Poland ; and that he ſhould pay the king three millions of rix-dollars in the ſpace of two years. Of this treaty Charles had notice, and by means of his miniſter count Piper entirely fruſtrated the ſcheme.</p><p>In 1701, as early as the ſeaſon permitted, Charles, having received a reinforcement from Sweden, took the field, and appeared ſuddenly on the banks of the Duna, along which the Saxon army was poſted to receive him. The king of Poland at that time being ſick, the army was commanded by Ferdinand duke of Courland, mariſchal Stenau, and general Paykel, all officers of valour and experience. They had fortified certain iſlands in the mouth of the river, and taken every other precaution againſt an attack ; the ſoldiers were hardy, well diſciplined, and nearly equal to the Swedes in number ; yet Charles, having passed the river in boats with high sides, to ſcreen the men from the fire of the enemy, attacked them with ſuch fury, that they were entirely defeated, with the loſs of 2500 killed on the ſpot, and 1500 taken priſoners. All the Saxon baggage, 56 pieces of cannon, five pair of colours, and six ſtandards, fell into the hands of the Swedes.</p><p>This victory was followed by the ſurrrender of all the towns and fortresses in the duchy of Courland. The king then passed into Lithuania, where every town opened its gates to him. At Birſen, an army of 20,000 Russians retired with the utmoſt precipitation on the news of his approach. Here Charles, perceiving that the kingdom of Poland was greatly diſaffected to Auguſtus, began to project the ſcheme of dethroning him by means of his own ſubjects. This ſcheme he executed with more policy than he ever ſhowed on any other occaſion. The manner of putting it in execution was concerted between Radziewischi, cardinal primate of Poland, and count Piper. Intrigues and cabals were held at the houſe of the treacherous eccleſiaſtic, while he was publiſhing circular letters to keep the people in their duty to the king. The diet being filled with Swediſh partions, became tumultuous, and broke up in confusion. The affairs of the kingdom then fell into the hands of the ſenate; but here the Swediſh party was as ſtrong as in the diet. It was agreed that they ſhould ſend an embassy to Charles ; that the poſpolite ſhould mount, and be ready againſt all events ; but the chief regulations reſpected the king’s authority, which it was determined at any rate to retrench. Auguſtus, reſolving rather to receive laws from the victorious Charles than from his own ſubjects, ſent an embassy to him, committing the management of the whole to the counteſs of Konigsrnark, a native of Sweden, and a lady famous for her wit and beauty. But the king refuſed to ſee her; on which ſhe returned, chagrined and diſappointed, to Warſaw. The ambassadors of the ſenate inſtantly obtained an audience ; and were assured by Charles, that he took arms againſt the Saxons in defence of the liberties of the Poles, whom he ſhould always regard as his beſt friends. Conferences were appointed to be held at Kinſchin ; but Charles ſoon after altered his mind, and told the ambaſſadors he would hold them at Warſaw.</p><p>Auguſtus, in the mean time, finding his ſcheme of peace fruſtrated, had recourſe to the ſenate ; but met with ſuch a rough anſwer from them, that he determined once more to apply to Charles. To him therefore he ſent his chamberlain ; but a passport being forgot, the ambaffador was arreſted. Charles continued his march to Warſaw, which ſurrendered on the firſt ſummons ; but the citadel held out for ſome days. Auguſtus, finding at laſt that no dependence was to be had on the Poles, determined to truſt his fortune wholly to the Saxon army and the nobility of the palatinate of Cracow, who offered to ſupport him to the utmoſt of their power. The Saxon army was now advanced to the frontiers, and Auguſtus immediately put himſelf at the head of it. Being joined by the nobility of Cracow, he found his forces to amount to 30,000 men, all brave and well- diſciplined. With theſe he marched in queſt of his enemy; who did not decline the combat, though he had with him only 12,000 men. Though the Saxons were ſtrongly poſted, having their front covered by a morals, besides being fortified with palliſadoes and chevaux de frise, they were attacked with irreſiſtible impetuosity, and entirely defeated, with the loſs of 4000 killed, 2000 made priſoners, and all their baggage and cannon. This victory was followed by the loſs of Cracow : after which Charles ſet out in purſuit of the flying army, with a deſign of preventing them from re- assembling ; but his horſe falling under him, he had the miſ-<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0231.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0225"/>
fortune to break his thigh, by which he was confined six weeks ; and thus Auguſtus obtained ſome reſpite. The interval he made the beſt uſe of. Having convoked a diet firſt at Marienburg, and then at Lublin, from them he obtained the following resolutions ; that an army of 50,000 men ſhould be raised by the republic for the ſervice of the prince ; that six weeks ſhould be allowed the Swedes to determine whether they were for war or peace ; and that the ſame time ſhould be granted to the turbulent and discontented nobles of Poland to make their conceſſions. To counteract; the effects of theſe reſolutions, Charles assembled another diet at Warſaw ; and while the two assemblies disputed concerning their rights and privileges, he recovered of his wound, received a ſtrong reinforcement from Pomerania, and utterly defeated and disperſed the remains of the Saxon army.</p><p>The ill fortune of Auguſtus continued ſtill to perſecute him. In 1704 he was formally depoſed by the diet, and the crown conferred by Charles on Staniſlaus Lecsinſky palatine of Poſnania. Auguſtus, however, did not yet tamely give up his kingdom. His adherents daily skirmiſhed with the Swedes; and Auguſtus himſelf, being reinforced by 9000 Russians, retook Warsaw, and was very near ſurprising the new king, who lived in perfect ſecurity in the city while Charles fought in his cauſe. Count Horn, with 1500 Swedes, vigorously defended the citadel ; but at laſt, finding it no longer tenable, he was obliged to surrender at diſcretion. The reduction of Warſaw was among the laſt advantages gained by Auguſtus in the course of this war. His troops were now compoſed of Saxon recruits and undiſciplined Poles, who had no attachment to his person, and were ready on all occaſions to forſake him. Charles and Staniſlaus advanced with the victorious army; the Saxons fled before them, and the towns for ſeveral miles round lent their ſubmissions. The Poles and Saxons were under the command of Schullemberg, a moſt ſagacious and experienced general, who uſed every expedient to check the progreſs of the Swedes, by seizing on the advantageous ports, ſacrificing ſmall parties to the ſafety of the whole, and to miſlead the enemy, &amp;c. However, with all his conduct and caution, he found himſelf outwitted, and Charles in the neighbourhood of his camp ready to fall upon him, while he thought him at 50 leagues diſtance. The Swediſh monarch attacked him with a ſuperior army, but entirely compoſed of horſe. Schullemberg had polled his men in ſuch a manner as rendered it impoſſible to ſurround them. His firſt rank being armed with pikes and fuſees, preſented a kind of rampart of bayonets ; the ſecond line ſtooping over the firſt who kneeled, fired over their heads, wſhile the third rank, who stood upon their feet, kept up an inceſſant fire, by which the Swediſh horſe were exceedingly galled and put in diſorder. Charles loſt the opportunity of cutting off the whole Saxon army, by omitting to order his men to diſmount. This was almoſt the firſt time that infantry had been regularly oppoſed to cavalry, and the ſuperiority of the former was evident. After the engagement had continued about three hours, the Saxons retreated in good order ; which no enemy had ever done before in any engagement with Charles. The Swedes purſued their enemies towards the Oder, and forced them to retreat through thick woods, almoſt impervious even to infantry. The Swediſh horſe, however, puſhed their way, and at laſt incloſed Schullemberg between a wood and the river, where Charles had no doubt of obliging him to surrender at diſcretion, or die ſword in-hand, as having neither boats nor bridges; but the genius of Schullemberg ſupplied every defect. In the night he ordered planks and floats of trees to be faſtened together; upon which he carried over his troops, while the Swedes were employed in dislodging 300 men, which he had placed in a wind mill, for the purpoſe of defending his flank and keeping the enemy in play. Charles ſpoke of this retreat with admiration, and laid he had been conquered by Schullemberg.</p><p>No material advantage, however, reſulted from this to Auguſtus; who was again obliged to leave Poland, and fortify the capital of his hereditary dominions, which he expected every moment to see inverted. In the mean time, however, the Russians having recovered their ſpirits, fell upon the Swedes in Livonia with the utmoſt fury. Narva, Dorpt, and ſeveral other towns, were taken, and the inhabitants and garriſons treated with great barbarity. Soon after, an army of 100,000 Russians entered Poland. Sixty thouſand Cossacks under Mazeppa entered the country at the ſame time, and ravaged every thing with the fury of barbarians. Schullemberg, too, perhaps more formidable than either, advanced with 14,000 Saxons and 7000 Ruffians, diſciplined in Germany, and reputed excellent soldiers. Could numbers have determined the event of war, the Swedes muſt certainly have been at this time overpowered. Inſtead of this, however, Charles ſeemed to triumph over his enemies with more eaſe the more numerous they were. The Russians were defeated ſo fast, that they were all disperſed before one party had notice of the misfortunes of another. The defeating an army of 40,000 men ſcarcely obſtructed the march of the Swedes, while their astoniſhed enemies looked upon theſe actions as the effects of witchcraft, and imagined that the king of Sweden had dealings with infernal spirits. With theſe apprehenſions they fled beyond the Boriſthenes, leaving the unhappy Auguſtus to his ill fate. Schullemberg, with all his ſkill and experience, ſucceeded no better. The Swediſh general Renſchild engaged and defeated him in half an hour, though the Swedes were vaſtly inferior in number, and their enemies posted in a most advantageous ſituation. Nothing could be more complete than this victory. Whole regiments of Saxons threw down their aims, and begged their lives in the moſt ſuppliant poſture. Six thouſand were ſlain in the field, and 7000 taken priſoners. Thirty-six pieces of cannon, 11,000 muſkets, 40 pair of colours and ſtandards, with all the Saxon baggage, fell into the hands of the Swedes : and the conſequences were still more important ; for now a partage was opened into Saxony, and Auguſtus ſeemed to be in as great danger of loſing his hereditary dominions as he had been of loſing Poland. This extraordinary victory, indeed, is ſaid to have been owing to a panic which ſeized the troops of Schullemberg : however, it was looked upon with admiration, and thought to make the renown of Renſchild equal to that of his ſovereign. Charles himſelf was jealous, and could not help exclaiming, “ Surely Renſchild will not compare himſelf with me !” But the cruelty of this general ſullied his reputation ; for six hours after the engagement, he cauſed 1000 Russians to be maſſacred in cold blood, to revenge, as he ſaid, the cruelties they had committed in Poland.</p><p>Soon after this victory, which was gained on the 12th of February 1706, Charles entered Saxony at the head of 24,000 men. The diet at Ratiſbon declared him an enemy to the empire if he croſſed the Oder. But to this declaration no regard was paid. Charles purſued his march; while Auguſtus was reduced to the condition of a vagrant in Poland, where he poſſeſſed not a single town beſides Cracow. Into this city he threw himſelf with a few Saxon, Poliſh, and Russian regiments, and began to erect some fortifications for its defence ; but the approach of the Swediſh general Meyerſeldt, and the news of the invaſion of Saxony, diſconcerted all his meaſures, and threw him into deſpair.

ed them almoſt as much as the Swedes : ſo that he was reduced to the neceſſity of writing a letter to Charles with his own hand, begging for peace on whatever terms he thought proper to grant. However, as he was then at the mercy of the Russians, this tranſaction was concealed with the greateſt care. His emissaries were introduced to the Swedish court in the night-time ; and being preſented to Charles, received the following anſwer : That king Auguſtus ſhould for ever renounce the crown of Poland, acknowledge Stanislaus, and promiſe never to reaſcend the throne, ſhould an opportunity offer ; that he ſhould release the princes Sobieſki, and all the Swediſh priſoners made in the courſe of the war; surrender Patkul, at that time reſident at his court as ambassador for the Czar of Muſcovy, and ſtop proceedings againſt all who had paſſed from his into the Swediſh ſervice. Theſe articles Charles wrote with his own hand, end delivered to count Piper, ordering him to finiſh them with the Saxon ambassadors.</p><p>Auguſtus all this time was obliged to continue a ſhow of war, though he had neither ability nor inclination to carry it on. He was joined by prince Menzikoff with 30,000 Russians; which obliged him, contrary to his inclination, to come to an engagement with Meyerfeldt, who commanded 10,000 men, one half of whom were Swedes. As at this time no disparity of numbers whatever was reckoned an equivalent to the valour of the Swedes; Meyerfeldt did not decline the combat, though the army of the enemy was four times as numerous as his own. With his countrymen he defeated the enemy’s firſt line, and was on the point of defeating the ſecond, when Staniſlaus, with the Poles and Lithuanians, gave way. Meyerfeldt then perceived that the battle was lost ; but he fought deſperately, on purpoſe to avoid the diſgrace oſ a defeat. At laſt, however, he was oppressed by numbers, and forced to ſurrender ; ſuffering the Swedes, for the firſt time, to be conquered by their enemies. The whole army were taken priſoners excepting major-general Krassau; who having repeatedly rallied a body of horſe formed into a brigade, at laſt broke through the enemy, and eſcaped to Poſnania.— Augustus had ſcarce ſung <hi rend="italic">Te Deum</hi> for this victory, when his plenipotentiary returned from Saxony with the articles of the treaty above-mentioned. The king heſitated and ſcrupled, but at laſt ſigned them ; after which he ſet out for Saxony, glad at any rate to be freed from ſuch an enemy as the king of Sweden, and from ſuch allies as the Russians.</p><p>The Czar Peter was no sooner informed of this extraordinary treaty, and the cruel execution of his plenipotentiary Patkul<note anchored="true" n="2" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>* See the article Patkul.</p></note> *, than he ſent letters to every court in Chriſtendom, complaining of this groſs violation of the law of nations. He intreated the emperor, the queen of Britain, and the States-General, to revenge this inſult on humanity. He ſtigmatized the compliance of Auguſtus with the opprobrious name of <hi rend="italic">pusillanimity ;</hi> exhorted them not to guarantee a treaty ſo unjuſt, but to deſpiſe the menaces of the Swediſh bully. So well, however, was the proweſs of the king of Sweden known, that none of the allies thought proper to irritate him, by refusing to guarantee any treaty he thought proper. At firſt, Peter thought of revenging Patkul’s death by massacring the Swediſh priſoners at Moſeow ; but from this he was ſoon deterred, by remembering that Charles had many more Russian prisoners than he had of Swedes. Giving over thoughts of revenging himſelf in this way, therefore, in the year 1707 he entered Poland, at the head of 60,000 men. Advancing to Leopold, he made himſelf master of that city, where he assembled a diet and ſolemnly depoſed Staniſlaus with the ſame ceremonies which had been uſed with regard to Auguſtus. The country was now reduced to the moſt miſerable ſituation ; one party, through fear, adhered to the Swedes ; another was gained over, or forced by Peter to take part with him : a violent civil war took place between the two, and great numbers of people were butchered, while cities, towns, and villages, were laid in aſhes by the frantic multitude. The appearance of a Swediſh army under king Staniſlaus and general Lewenhaupt put a ſtop to theſe diſorders, Peter himſelf not caring to ſtand before ſuch enemies. He retired, therefore, into Lithuania, giving as the cauſe of his retreat, that the country could not ſupply him with proviſions and forage neceſsary for so great an army.</p><p>In the mean time Charles had taken up his reſidence in Saxony, where he gave law to the court of Vienna, and in a manner intimidated all Europe. He declared himſelf the protector of the Proteſtant intereſt in Germany, particularly of the emperor’s Proteſtant ſubjects in Sileſia. He deſired, or rather <hi rend="italic">commanded,</hi> the emperor to renew and confirm to them all the liberties granted by the treaties of Weſtphalia, but ſince that time reclaimed or eluded at the treaty of Ryſwick. The emperor durſt not refuſe; and upwards of 100 churches were given to the Proteſtants. On this occaſion the emperor is reported to have ſaid, that “ had Charles deſired him to become a Lutheran, he did not know whether he could have refuſed.” One would indeed have imagined that Charles had ſome thoughts of converting, or at leaſt dethroning, the Pope himſelf; for being incenſed at the constant oppoſition of the court of Rome, whole weakneſs and intrigues he deſpiſed, he one day told the emperor’s miniſter, that “ the Swedes had conquered Rome before now, and he might one day demand an inventory of the effects left there by queen Chriſtina.” At last, ſatiated with the glory of having dethroned one king, ſet up another, and ſtruck all Europe with terror and admiration, Charles began to evacuate Saxony, in purſuit of his great plan, the dethroning Czar Peter, and conquering the vast empire of Ruſſia. While the army was on full march in the neighbourhood of Dreſden, he took the extraordinary reſolution of viſiting king Auguſtus with no more than five attendants. Though he had no reason to imagine that Auguſtus either did or could entertain any friendſhip for him, he was not uneaſy at the consequences of thus putting himſelf entirely in his power. He got to the palace door of Auguſtus before it was known that he had entered the city. General Fleming having ſeen him at a diſtance, had only time to run and inform his maſter. What might be done in the preſent caſe immediately occurred to the miniſter ; but Charles entered the elector’s chamber in his boots before the latter had time to recover from his ſurpriſe. He breakfaſted with him in a friendly manner, and then expressed a deſire of viewing the fortifications. While he was walking round them, a Livonian, who had formerly been condemned in Sweden, and served in the troops of Saxony, thought he could never have a more favourable opportunity of obtaining pardon. He therefore begged of king Auguſtus to intercede for him, being fully aſſured that his majeſty could not refuſe ſo slight a requeſt to a prince in whoſe power he then was. Auguſtus accordingly made the requeſt ; but Charles refuſed it in ſuch a manner, that he did not think proper to aſk it a ſecond time. Having paſſed ſome hours in this extraordinary viſit, he returned to his army, after having embraced and taken leave of the king he had dethroned.</p><p>The armies of Sweden, in Saxony, Poland, and Finland, now exceeded 70,000 men ; a force more than sufficient to have conquered all the power of Muſcovy, had they met them on equal terms. Peter, who had his army diſperſed in ſmall parties, inſtantly aſſembled it on receiving notice of the king oſ Sweden’s march, was making all poſſible prepara-<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0233.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0227"/>
tions for a vigorous reſiſtance, and was on the point of attacking Staniſlaus, when the approach of Charles ſtruck his whole army with terror. In the month of January 1708 he paſſed the Niemen, and entered the ſouth gate of Grodno just as Peter was quitting the place by the north gate. Charles at this time had advanced to ſome diſtance before the army at the head of 600 horſe. The Czar having intelligence of his ſituation, ſent back a detachment of 2000 men to attack him : but they were utterly defeated ; and this disappointment was followed by the total evacuation of Lithuania. The king purſued his flying enemies in the midſt of ſnow and ice, over mountains, rivers, moraſſes, and through almoſt every obſtacle that could be ſurmounted by human power. He had foreſeen all difficulties, and determined to ſurmount them all. As he knew that the country could not furnish proviſions ſufficient for the ſubſiſtence of his army, he had provided a great quantity of biſcuit, on which his men chiefly ſubſiſted till they came to the banks of the Berezine, in view of Boriſlow. Here the Czar was posted, and Charles deſigned to bring him to a battle ; after which he could penetrate with the greater ease into Ruſſia. Peter, however, did not think proper to come to an action ; but retreated towards the Boristhenes, whither he was purſued by Charles as ſoon as he had refreshed his army The Russians had deſtroyed the roads and deſolated the country ; nevertheless the Swediſh army advanced with great celerity, and in their way defeated 20,000 of the enemy, though entrenched to the teeth. This victory, conſidering the circumſtances in which it was gained, was one of the moſt glorious the Swedes ever obtained. The memory of it is preserved by a medal ſtruck in Sweden, with this inſcription, <hi rend="italic">Sylvee, Poludes, Aggeres, Hostes, victi.</hi></p><p>When the Russians had repassed the Boriſthenes, which ſeparates Poland from Muscovy, the Czar, finding himſelf cloſely purſued by an enemy with whom he was not able to cope, determined at laſt to propose peace. Propoſals were accordingly made ; but Charles returned no other answer than that he would treat at Moſcow; which being reported to Peter, he coolly replied, “My brother Charles affects to play Alexander, but he will not find in me a Darius.” However, he did not think proper to venture an engagement, but continued his retreat ; and Charles purſued io cloſe, that he was daily ſkirmiſhing with the rear of the enemy. In theſe actions the Swedes had generally the advantage, though in the main theſe victories proved detrimental, by weakening the army in a country where it was impoſſible to recruit. Near Smolenſko, the king, with only six regiments, defeated a body of 10,000 horſe and 6000 Calmucks. In this engagement he was expoſed to the utmoſt danger, the enemy having ſeparated him from his troops. With one regiment only, he fought with ſuch fury as dispersed the enemy, and drove them before him, at the time they thought themſelves ſure of taking him prisoner. Two aids-de-camp that fought near him were killed ; his horſe was killed, as was alſo an equerry while he preſented another. The enemy had broke through the regiment, and got quite up to the king; who is said to have on this occaſion killed 12 men with his own hand without receiving a wound.</p><p>By the 3d of October 1708 Charles was within 100 leagues of Moſcow ; but the Czar had made the roads impassable, either by laying them under water, digging deep ditches, or covering them with the wood of whole foreſts. He had alſo deſtroyed the villages on every side, and taken away every possibility of ſubſiſting an army The ſeaſon was alſo far advanced ; the intenſe ſevere weather was approaching ; ſo that the Swedes were threatened with all the miſeries of cold and famine, at the same time that they were exposed to the attacks of an enemy greatly ſuperior in number, who, from their knowledge of the country, had almoſt constant opportunities of harassing and attacking them by ſurprise. For theſe reasons the king reſolved to paſs thro’ the Ukrain, where Mazeppa, a Poliſh gentleman, was general and chief of the nation, Mazeppa having been affronted by the Czar, readily entered into a treaty with Charles, whom he promiſed to aſſiſt with 30,000 men, great quantities of proviſions and ammunition, and with all his treaſures, which were immenſe. The Swediſh army advanced towards the river Diſna, where they had to encounter the greatest difficulties; a foreſt above 40 leagues in extent, filled with rocks, mountains, and marſhes. To complete their misfortunes, they were led 30 leagues out of the right way ; all the artillery was sunk in bogs and marſhes ; the proviſion of the ſoldiers, which conſiſted of biſcuit, was exhausted ; and the whole army spent and emaciated when they arrived at the Diſna. Here they expected to have met Mazeppa with his reinforcement ; but inſtead of that, they perceived the oppoſite banks of the river covered with a hoſtile army, and the paſſage itſelf almoſt impracticable. Charles, however, was ſtill undaunted; he let his soldiers by ropes down the ſteep banks ; they crossed the river either by ſwimming or on rafters hastily put together; drove the Russians from their post, and continued their march. Mazeppa soon after appeared, having with him about 6000 broken remains of the army he had promiſed. The Russians had got intelligence of his designs, defeated and diſperſed his adherents, laid his towns in allies, and taken all the proviſions collected for the Swediſh army However, he ſtill hoped to be uſeful by his intelligence in an unknown country ; and the Cossacks, out of revenge, crowded daily to the camp with proviſions.</p><p>Greater misfortunes ſtill awaited the Swedes. When Charles entered the Ukrain, he had ſent orders to general Lewenhaupt to meet him with 15,000 men, 6000 of whom were Swedes, and a large convoy of proviſions. Againſt this detachment Peter now bent his whole force, and marched againſt him with an army of 65,000 men. Lewenhaupt had received intelligence that the Russian army conſiſted only of 24,000; a force to which he thought 6000 Swedes ſuperior, and therefore diſdained to entrench himſelf. A furious conteſt enſued; in which the Russians were defeated with the loss of 15,000 men. The Swedes continued their march ; but, by the treachery of their guide, were led into a marſhy country, where the roads were made impassable by deep ditches and trees laid across. Here he was again attacked by the Czar with his whole army. Lewenhaupt had ſent a detachment of two battalions to diſpute the paſſage of the enemy over a morals ; but finding they were likely to be overpowered, he marched at the head of the whole infantry to their relief. Another deſperate battle ensued ; when at last the Russians were put in diſorder) and on the point of being totally defeated, when the Czar gave orders to the Cossacks and Calmucks to fire upon all the Russians who fled. “ Even kill me (said he) if I ſhould be ſo cowardly as to turn my back.” On this the battle was renewed with great vigour ; but notwithſtanding theſe positive orders, and the example of the Czar himſelf, the Russians were a third time put in diſorder, after loſing 6000 men, when general Baver arrived with a ſtrong reinforcement of freſh Russian troops. The engagement was again renewed, and continued without intermiſſion till night. The Swedes took poſſeſſion of an advantageous poſt ; but were next morning attacked by the Russians. Lewenhaupt had formed a kind of rampart of his waggons, but was obliged to set fire to them, in order to prevent their falling into the hands of the enemy, and at the same time to cover his retreat by the ſmoke. The Russians, however, came ſoon<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0234.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0228"/>
enough tn ſave 5000 waggons of thoſe provisions designed for the diſtressed Swedes. A ſtrong detachment was ſent to purſue Lewenhaupt ; but ſo terrible did he appear, that the Russian general offered him an honourable capitulation. This was refuſed with diſdain; and the battle renewed with the ſame vigour as before. The Swedes, though reduced to 4000, again defeated their enemies, and killed 5000 on the ſpot. After this, Lewenhaupt was suffered to purſue his march without moleſtation, but alſo without cannon or provisions. Prince Menzſkoff, indeed, was detached to haraſs him ; but such was the formidable appearance of the Swedes even in their diſtreſs, that he was afraid to attack them : ſo that at laſt the 4000 arrived ſafe in the camp of Charles, after having killed upwards of 30,000 of the enemy on their march.</p><p>This, we may say, was the laſt effort of Swediſh valour. The difficulties they had now to undergo exceeded what human nature could bear ; yet still they hoped, by conſtancy and courage, to overcome every obſtacle. In the ſevereſt winter known for a long time even in Russia, they made long marches, clothed like ſavages in the ſkins of wild beaſts ; all the draught-horses periſhed ; thousands of ſoldiers dropped dead with cold and hunger : ſo that by the month of February 1709, the whole army was reduced to 18,000 Swedes. Amidſt numberleſs difficulties theſe penetrated at laſt to Pultowa, a town on the eaſtern frontier of the Ukrain, where the Czar had laid up magazines; and of theſe Charles reſolved to get posseſſion. Mazeppa adviſed the king to inveſt the place, in conſequence of his having correſpondence with ſome of the inhabitants, by whoſe means he hoped it would be ſurrendered. However, he was deceived ; the beſieged made an obſtinate defence, the Swedes were repulsed in every assault, and 8000 of them were defeated, and almoſt entirely cut off, in an engagement with a party of Russians. To complete his misfortunes, Charles received a ſhot from a carabine in his heel, which ſhattered the bone. For six hours after he continued calmly on horſeback, giving orders, till he fainted with the loſs of blood ; after which he was carried into his tent. It was imagined that amputation would be neceſſary, as the wound had already begun to mortify ; but one Newman undertook to ſave the limb. It was told the king that deep inciſions would be neceſſary. “ Fall to work then (said he), cut boldly, and fear nothing.” He held out his leg while the operation was performing ; never changed countenance; and while the dressing was laid on, ordered an aſſault for the next morning.</p><p>For ſome days the Czar, with an army of 70 <hi rend="italic">,000</hi> men, had lain at a ſmall diſtance, haraſſing the Swediſh camp, and cutting off the convoys of proviſion ; but now intelligence was received, that he was advancing as if with a deſign of attacking the lines. In this ſituation, Charles, wounded, diſtreſſed, and almoſt ſurrounded by enemies; is ſaid to have, for the first time, aſſembled a grand council of war ; the reſult of which was, that it was expedient to march out and attack the Russians. Voltaire, however, totally denies that the king relaxed one jot of his wonted obſtinacy and arbitrary temper : but that, on the 7th of July, he ſent for general Renſchild, and told him, without any emotion, to prepare for attacking the enemy next morning.</p><p>The 8th of July 1709 is remarkable for the battle which decided the fate of Sweden. Charles having left 8000 men in the camp to defend the works and repel the sallies of the beſieged, began to march againſt his enemies by break of day with the rest of the army, conſiſting of 26,000 men, of whom 18,000 were Coſſacks. The Russians were drawn up in two lines behind their intrenchments, the horſe in front, and the foot in the rear, with chasms to ſuffer the horſe to fall back in caſe of neceſſity. General Slippenbach was diſpatched to attack the cavalry; which he did with ſuch impetuoſity, that they were broken in an inſtant. However, they rallied behind the infantry, and returned to the charge with ſuch vigour, that they disordered the Swedes in their turn, and took Slippenbach priſoner. Charles was now carried in his litter to this scene of confuſion. The troops were animated by his preſence, and returned to the charge ; the battle became doubtful, when general Creuk was diſpatched by Charles to attack the enemy in flank. Creuk miſtook his way, or, according to others, who had the beſt opportunities of information, was bribed by Russian gold, which occaſioned the loſs of the battle, Peter now diſpatched prince Menzikoff with a ſtrong detachment, to post himſelf between the Swedes and Pultowa, to cut off their communication with their camp, and to fall upon their rear. He executed his orders with great ſuccess ; cut off a corps de reserve of 3000 men; and thus decided the fortune of the day. The king, however, had ranged his remaining troops in two lines ; the foot in the centre, and the horſe in the two wings. They had already been twice rallied, and were now attacked with fury on all ſides. Charles, in his litter, with his ſword drawn in one hand, and a piſtol in the other, ſeemed to be everywhere preſent. New misfortunes, however, awaited him. A cannon ball killed both horses in the litter ; and ſcarce were others put in their place, when a ſecond broke the litter itſelf in pieces, and overturned the king. The ſoldiers now believing him killed, fell back in conſternation. The first line was broke, and the ſecond fled. Charles did every thing in his power to reſtore order; but the Russians preſſed ſo hard, that rallying was impoſſible, eſpecially as powder was alſo wanting. Renſchild and ſeveral other general officers were taken priſoners ; and the king himſelf muſt have fallen into the hands of the enemy, had not count Poniatowſky drawn up 500 horſe, ſurrounded the royal perſon, and with deſperate fury broke through ten regiments of the enemy. With theſe the king arrived on the banks of the Boriſthenes. The Russians forced the Swediſh camp, where they found six millions in ſpecie ; but could not hinder Lewenhaupt, with 4000 foot and all the remaining cavalry, from retreating to the banks of the Boriſthenes. This, however, availed them but little ; for being purſued by prince Menzikoff, they were obliged, for want of boats or bridges, to ſurrender at diſcretion. Charles fled in a mean calaſh, attended by a little troop inviolably attached to his person, ſome on foot, and ſome on horſeback. They were obliged to cross a ſandy deſert, where neither herb nor tree was to be ſeen, and where the burning heat and want of water were more intolerable than the extremities of cold they had formerly ſuffered. The whole had almoſt periſhed for want of water, when a ſpring was fortunately diſcovered ; after which they reached Oczakow, a town in the Turkiſh dominions, the bashaw of which supplied the king with every neceſſary. It was some time, however, before boats could be got ready for tranſporting the whole of the king’s attendants ; by which accident 500 Swedes and Coſſacks fell into the hands of the enemy. This loſs affected him more than all his other misfortunes. He ſhed tears at ſeeing across the river Bog the greater part of his few remaining friends carried into captivity, without having it in his power to aſſiſt them. The baſhaw waited upon him to apologize for the delay, and was ſeverely reprimanded by Charles, as if he had been his own subject.</p><p>The king remained but a few days at Oczakow, when the ſeraſquier of Bender ſent an aga to compliment him on his arrival in the Turkiſh dominions, and to invite him to that<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0235.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0229"/>
city. Here he was treated with the utmoſt hospitality : the Turks practiſed to its utmoſt extent their generous maxim of regarding as ſacred the perſons oſ unfortunate princes who had taken ſhelter in their dominions ; and perhaps regarded him, notwithſtanding his misfortunes, as an ally that might be uſeful to themſelves againſt the Russians. Every one, indeed, regarded him in his diſtreſs. The French king offered him a ſafe paſſage from the Levant to Marseilles, from whence he might eaſily return to his own dominions. But Charles was too obſtinate to receive advice. Puffed up with the notion of imitating Alexander the Great, he diſdained to return except at the head of a numerous army ; and he yet expected, by means of the Turks, to dethrone his adverſary the Czar. Negotiations for this purpoſe, indeed, were carried on in the Turkiſh divan ; and it was propoſed to escort Charles with a numerous army to the frontiers of Poland : but the revolution which took place there quickly put an end to all ſuch projects. Auguſtus thought himſelf no longer bound to obſerve the treaty which he had made, than Charles was at hand to force him to it. After the battle of Pultowa, therefore, he entered Poland, and took every meaſure, in concert with the Czar, for the recovery of his kingdom. Staniſlaus was not able to ſtand before ſuch enemies, but was obliged to leave his dominions and fly to Bender, in the diſguiſe of a Swediſh officer, in order to ſhare the fortune of Charles.—It was not in Poland alone that the Swediſh affairs began to suffer in conſequence of the defeat at Pultowa The Danes quickly invaded the province of Schonen with an army of 13,000 foot and 2500 horſe. Only 13,000 Swediſh forces remained to defend all the territories poſſessed by Charles in Germany ; and of theſe only a small part were allotted for the defence of Schonen. The regency of Sweden, however, exerted themſelves to the utmoſt to repel this ungenerous invaſion ; and having collected an army of 1 2,000 militia and 8000 regulars, diſpatched them under general Steenboek into Schonen. Some Saxon troops were incorporated in this army ; and among theſe a prodigious deſertion took place, which the general found it impoſſible to prevent ; and thus the Danes gained ſeveral advantages, and at laſt took Chriſtianſtadt. Their insolence on this ſucceſs was ſo great, that the Swedes demanded to be inſtantly led againſt them. Here the good fortune of Sweden ſeemed once more to revive. The Danes were driven from a very ſtrong ſituation, with the loſs of 8000 killed and taken priſoners, besides a vaſt number wounded. The king received the intelligence of this victory with the greateſt exultation ; and could not help exclaiming, “ My brave Swedes, ſhould it pleaſe God that I once more join you, we ſhall conquer them all !”</p><p>In the mean time, Charles, by means of his agents the count Poniatowſki and the Sieur Neugebar, uſed his utmoſt efforts to procure a rupture between the Porte and Russia. For a long time the money bellowed by Peter on the vizirs and janiſaries prevailed ; but at laſt, in 1711, the grand ſignior, influenced by his mother, who was ſtrongly in the intereſt of Charles, and had been wont to call him <hi rend="italic">her lion,</hi> determined to avenge his quarrel with Peter. He therefore gave orders to the vizir to fall upon the Ruſſians with an army of 200,000 men. The vizir promiled obedience ; but at the ſame time professed his ignorance in the art of war, and diſlike to the preſent expedition. The khan of Crim Tartary, who had been gained over by the reputation and presents of the king of Sweden, had orders to take the field with 40,000 of his men, and had the liberty of assembling his army at Bender, that Charles might see that the war was undertaken upon his account. The Czar, on theſe news, left the siege of Riga, where he had continued for some months; and with 24,000 men entered Moldavia, where he was joined by Cantemir a vaſſal of the Porte. The vizir marched against him with a prodigious army, and, through the negligence of the Czar, cooped him up in ſuch a manner that he could neither advance nor retreat. In this deſperate ſituation, he perceived that he was now in as bad a ſituation as Charles at Pultowa ; and gave orders for breaking through the enemy with fixed bayonets. The deſponding spiritless ſoldiers, however, were little dispoſed to execute theſe orders ; when Catharine, wise to the czar , without his knowledge, ſet on foot a treaty with the vizir; and having ſoon obtained his conſent, had the peace ſigned in six hours ; by which means, in all probability, the whole Russian army was saved.</p><p>The new treaty was moſt violently oppoſed by count Poniatowſki and the khan of Tartary. The former had made the king acquainted with the ſituation of both armies ; on which he inſtantly ſet out from Bender, filled with the hopes of fighting the Russians, and taking ample vengeance. Having ridden 50 leagues poſt, he arrived at the camp juſt as the czar was drawing off his half-famiſhed troops. He alighted at Poniatowſki’s tent ; and being informed of particulars, inſtantly flew in a rage to the vizir, whom he loaded with reproaches, and accuſed of treachery. Recollecting himſelf, however, he propoſed a method by which the fault might be remedied ; but finding his propoſal rejected, he posted back to Bender, after having by the groſseſt insults ſhowed his contempt of the vizir,</p><p>The violent behaviour of Charles did not promote his intereſt. The vizir perceived that his ſtay in Turkey might prove fatal to himſelf ; and therefore determined to get him out of the country as soon as poſſible, either by fair means or foul. Succeeding vizirs adopted the ſame plan ; and at laſt the grand ſignior himſelf wrote a letter to the king, in which he deſired him to depart by next winter, promiſing to ſupply him with a sufficient guard, with money, and every thing else necessary for his journey. Charles gave an evasive answer, and determined to procraſtinate his journey, as well to gratify his own ſtubborn temper, as becauſe he diſcovered a correspondence between Auguſtus and the khan of Tartary, the object of which, he had reason to believe, was to betray him to the Saxons. When he was therefore again pressed to fix the day of his departure, he replied, that he could not think of going before his debts were paid. Being aſked how much was necessary for this purpoſe, he replied, 1000 purſes<note anchored="true" n="3" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>(a) Each purse contained 30 sequins.</p></note> <hi rend="smallcaps">(a).</hi> Twelve hundred purſes were inſtantly sent to the ſeraſquſer at Bender, with orders to deliver them to the king of Sweden, but not before he ſhould have begun his journey. By fair promises, however, Charles perſuaded him to part with the money ; after which, inſtead of letting out, he ſquandered away his treaſure in preſents and gratifications, and then demanded 1000 purſes more before he would ſet out. The ſerasquier was aſtoniſhed at this behaviour. He ſhed tears ; and, turning to the king, told him, that his head would be the forfeit of having obliged him with the money. The grand ſignior, on being acquainted with this ſhameful behaviour of Charles, flew into a rage, and called an extraordinary divan, where he himſelf spoke, a thing very unuſual for the Turkiſh monarchs. It was unanimously agreed that ſuch a trouble-<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0236.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0230"/>
ſome guest ought to be removed by force ſhould other means fail. Orders were therefore poſitively lent to Charles to depart ; and, in cafe of refuſal, to attack him in his quarters. Nothing could equal his obſtinacy on this occasion : in ſpite of the menaces of his enemies, in ſpite of the intrea ties of his friends, he perſiſted in his reſolution ; and at laſt determined to reſiſt, with 300 Swedes, being all the attendants he had, an army of 20,000 janiſaries well armed and furniſhed with cannon. At length he was attacked in good earneſt ; though it muſt be owned, that even in this ex tremity, the Turks showed their regard to him, and were tender of hrs life, which the king did not return at all in a ſimilar manner. Moſt of the Swedes ſurrendered at once, perhaps as thinking it the only method of saving the king's life. This miſconduct, however, had a quite contrary effect. Charles became the more obſtinate, the more deſperate his affairs teemed to be. With 40 menial servants only, and the generals Hord and Dardorff, he determined to defend himſelf to the laſt extremity. Seeing his ſoldiers lay down their arms', he told the generals, “ We muſt now defend the houle. Come, (adds he with a ſmile), let us fight <hi rend="italic">pro aris et focis.”</hi> The houſe had been already forced by the Tartars, all but a hall which was near the door, and where his domeſtics had aſſembled themſelves. Charles forced his way through the janiſaries, attended by the generals Hord and Dardoff, joined his people, and then barricaded the door. The moment he entered, the enemy, who were in the houſe, threw down their booty, and endeavoured to eſcape at the windows. Charles purſued them from room to room with much bloodſhed, and cleared the houſe in a few minutes. He then fired furiously from the windows, killed 200 of the Turks in a quarter of an hour, ſo that the baſhaw who commanded them was at length forced to ſet the houſe on fire. This was done by arrows with lighted matches ſhot into the roof ; but Charles, instead of quitting it gave orders for extinguiſhing the fire, in which he himſelf aſſiſted with great diligence. All efforts, however, were vain : the roof fell in ; and Charles, with his few faithful companions, was ready to be buried in the ruins. In this extremity one called out, that there was a neceſſity for iurren- dering. “ What a ſtrange fellow ! (cries the king) who would rather be a prisoner with the Turks than mix his aſhes with thoſe of his ſovereign.” Another had the preſence of mind to cry out, that the chancery was but 50 paces off, had a ſtone roof, and was proof againſt fire. Pleaſed with the thoughts of again coming to blows, the king exclaimed, “ A true Swede ! Let us take all the powder and ball we can carry.” He then put himſelf at the head of his troops, and ſallied out with ſuch fury that the Turks retreated 50 paces ; but faffing down in the hurry, they ruſhed in upon him, and carried him by the legs and arms to the baſhaw’s tent.</p><p>This extraordinary adventure, which favours not a little of inſanity, happened on the 12th of February 1713. He was now kept priſoner, with all his retinue ; and in this ſituation he was viſited by the unfortunate Staniſlaus. The latter, as we have already obſerved, came in the diſgniſe of a Swediſh officer, and had indeed ſerved in the Swediſh army in Pomerania, for which reaſon he was arreſted in the Turkiſh dominions ; but being known at Bender, notice was font to the baſhaw who was conducting the king of Sweden to Adrianople. The baſhaw communicated the news to Baron Fabricios, a favourite of Charles, who immediately imparted it to the king. “ Dear Fabricius, (ſays this inflexible monarch), run and tell him never to make peace with Auguſtus ; we ſhall ſoon have a change in our affairs.”</p><p>buch were the conſiderations that ſtill occurred to the mind of Charles ; however, at laſt he ſeemed inclined to ſubmit to his fate, and began ſeriouſly to think of returning to his kingdom, now reduced to the moſt deplorable ſituation. Hrs habitation was now fixed at Demotica, a ſmall town about six leagues from Adrianople. Here he was al lowed provisions for his own table and thoſe of his retinue ; but only 25 crowns a-day in money, inſtead oſ 500 which he had received at Bender. During his reſidence here he received a deputation from Heffe-Caſſel, ſoliciting his confient to the marriage of the landgrave with Eleonora princess royal of Sweden; to which he readily agreed; a deputation was alſo sent him by the regency of Sweden, requelling that he would prepare for returning to his own dominions, which were ready to fink under a ruinous war in his abſence. What determined him, however, more than any thing to haften his return, was the following accident. The new grand vizir Ibrahim Molla, having for private reaſons determined to come to a rupture with the czar, invited Charles to a conference, in the ſtyle and with the familiarity of an equal. Charles was ſo much chagrined at this indignity, that he ſent his chancellor Mullem to meet the vizir, with a pretence that he was sick. To avoid giving offence to this miniſter Charles was obliged to keep his bed during his reſidence at Demotica, which was for 10 months after. At laſt, this vizir being ſtrangled, and the Swediſh intereſt at the Porte thereby entirely ruined, he determined to quit Turkey at all events. His departure was to be negotiated by his favourite Grothuſen, whom he veſted with the character of ambassador extraordinary ; ſending him to Adrianople with a train of <hi rend="italic">14.</hi> perſons richly dreſſed. To equip this retinue the king was reduced to the moſt mortifying ſhifts, and to the neceſſity of borrowing money from uſurers at 50 <hi rend="italic">per cent.</hi> ſt he great object was, to obtain from the vizir money and a paſſport. Grothuſen was received with all the respect due to his rank ; but the vizir ſtarted difficulties. With regard to the paſſport, he laid, it could be of no uſe until the consent of the court of Vienna was firſt obtained ; and as to money, he ſaid, “ his maſter knew how to give when he thought proper, but it was beneath his dignity to <hi rend="italic">lend;</hi> that the king ſhould have every necessary provided for his journey, and poſſibly the Porte might make ſome pecuniary preſent, but he would not have it expected.” The imperial miniſter, however, removed every difficulty with regard to the passport, by granting it in the moſt lull and ample manner, in the name of the emperor, the princes and states of Germany. He lent alſo a preſent to the king, conſiſting of a tent of ſcarlet richly embroidered with gold ; a ſabre, the handle of which was ſtudded with jewels ; anti eight fine horses richly capariſoned. Money, the article moſt wanted, was entirely forgotten ; however, the day was fixed for Charles’s departure, and the vizir appointed 60 carriages loaded with all kinds of proviſions, and several companies or janiſaries and other troops to attend him to the frontiers oſ Transylvania.</p><p>On the 14th of October 1714 ,Charles quitted his bed at Demotica, and ſet out for Sweden. All the princes through whoſe territories he was to paſs, had given orders tor his entertainment in the moſt magnificent manner ; but the king, perceiving that theſe compliments only rendered his impriſonment and other misfortunes more conſpicuous, ſuddenly dilmiffed his Turkiſh attendants, and aſſembling his own people, bid them take no care about him, but make the beſt of their way to Stralsund. After this he ſet out poſt, in the habit of a German officer, attended only by Colonel During. Keeping the by-roads through Hungary, Moravia, Auſtria, Bavaria, Wirtemberg, the Palatinate, Westphalia, and Mecklenburg, he arrived on the 21st of November at midnight before the gates of Stralſund. Being unknown, he was admitted with difficulty ; but being ſoon recognized<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0237.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0231"/>
by the governor, the greateſt tokens of joy were ſhown all over the town. In the midſt of the tumult Charles went to bed. He had been booted for 16 days, and now his legs were swelled to ſuch a degree that it was necessary to cut his boots off. Having slept for ſome hours, he aroſe, reviewed his troops, and gave orders !or renewing the war with redoubled vigour.</p><p>Sweden was now in the greateſt diſtreſs. We have already mentioned, that on the news oſ the defeat at Pultowa, the Danes had invaded Schonen, but were defeated by General Steenboek. This victory, however, did not put an end to the war. On the contrary, the kings of Denmark and Poland, with the czar of Muſcovy, entered into ſtricter bonds of amity than ever. They dreaded the return of Charles to his own dominions, and apprehended that numberless victories would ſoon efface the remembrance oſ Pultowa. They determined, therefore, to make the beſt uſe of their time ; and perhaps Charles never took a more imprudent reſolution than obſtinately to remain ſo long in the Turkiſh dominions. The kings of Denmark and Poland invaded Pomerania ; but after laying ſiege in vain to Stralſund, Wismar, and other places, they were obliged to retire with disgrace into winter-quarters. In 1712, the king of Denmark invaded and reduced Bremen and Verden ; but the ſame year met with a terrible defeat from Steenboek,∙ with the loss of a vast number killed and wounded, and almoſt all them artillery taken. The following year, however, this general being purſued, and ſurrounded by the united forces of the Russians, Danes, and Saxons, was obliged to throw himſelf into the neutral town of Tommingen ; where he was beſieged, and obliged to surrender at diſcretion, with his whole army. The conſequence of this diſaſter was an invaſion of Finland by the czar; which province he totally reduced, after defeating the Swedes in ſeveral engagements. Indeed, the Swediſh forces were now ſo much reduced, that they were unable to cope with almoſt any enemy. The return of Charles, however, ſeemed to give new life to the whole nation. Though the number of inhabitants was viſibly diminished, the levies he had ordered were completed in a few weeks : but the bands left to cultivate the earth consiſted oſ the infirm, aged, and decrepid ; so that a famine was threatened in conſequence of the military rage which had ſeized all the youth of the kingdom.</p><p>The presence of Charles did not now produce thoſe conſequences which the allies had feared. The kingdom was too much reduced to be able to furniſh the necessary ſupplies of men and money; and though the king’s courage and military ſkill were not in the leaſt diminished, the efforts he made, inſtead of restoring Sweden to its ſplendour, lerved entirely to ruin it. In 1715, Pruſſia declared againſt him, on account of his demanding back the town of Stetin, which that monarch had ſeized. To complete his embarrassment, the elector of Hanover, George I. of Britain, al- ſo became his enemy. The forces of Denmark, Pruſſia, Saxony, and Hanover, joined to inveſt Wiſmar, while a body of 36,000 men formed the ſiege of Stralsund ; at the ſame time that the czar, with a fleet of 20 large ſhips of war, and 150 tranſports, carrying 30,000 men, threw every part of the Swediſh coaſt into the greateſt conſternation. The heroiſm of Charles could not prevail againſt io many enemies ; yet he was ſtill ſo dreadful, that the prince of Anhalt, with 12,000 brave troops, did not think himſelf a match for this furious enemy when at the head of only 2000, till he had entrenched his army behind a ditch, defended by chevaux de frize. It appeared, indeed, that his precaution was not unnecessary ; for in the night Charles with his men clambered up the ditch, and attacked the enemy in his usual manner. Numbers, however, at laſt prevailed ; and Charles was obliged to retire, after having ſeen his favourite Grothuſen, General Dardorff and During, the companions of his exile, killed by his ſide, he himſelf being wounded in the breaſt.</p><p>This raſh attempt was made in order to save Rugen, from whence the town of Stralſund was ſupplied with pro- visions. The place was well fortified, and garrisoned with 9000 men, with Charles himſelf at their head ; but nothing could reſiſt the efforts of the enemy. The houſes were laid in aſhes by the bombs ; the walls miserably ſhattered, and large breaches made in them by the cannon ; ſo that by the 1 7th of December it was propoſed to give the assault. The attack on the horn-work was deſperate : the enemy was twice reptulſed ; but at laſt, by dint of numbers, effected a lodgment. The next day Charles headed a ſally, in which he dealt terrible deſtruction among the beiiegers, but was at length overpowered and obliged to retreat into the town. At laſt his officers, apprehending that he muſt either fall into the hands of the enemy, or be buried in the ruins of the place, intreated him to retire. A retreat, however, was now almoſt as dangerous as to remain in the town, on account of the fleets of the enemy with which the ſea was covered ; and it is thought this very circumſtance induced the king to conſent to it. Setting out, therefore, in a ſmall boat with fails and oars, he palled all the enemy’s ſhips and batteries, and arrived ſafe at Yſtedt in Schonen.</p><p>To revenge himſelf for theſe losses, Charles invaded Norway with an army of 25,000 men. The Danes were every where defeated and purſued with that vigour for which the king of Sweden was so remarkable ; but ſtrong reinforcements arriving from Denmark, and proviſions failing, he was at laſt obliged to retire, and evacuate the country. Soon alter this the Swedes loſt Wiſmar ; but when every thing ſeemed to go to wreck, Baron Goertz the chief miniſter and favourite of Charles found means to ſet on foot a treaty with the czar of Moſcovy, by which the moſt formidable of all Charles’s enemies was taken off. The miniſter found means to work upon the inflexible and ſtubborn temper of Charles, by repreſenting to him that the cession of certain provinces to Peter would induce him to assiſt him in his projects of again dethroning Auguſtus, and of replacing James on the throne of Britain ; which laſt ſcheme he had projected out of revenge for the elector of Hanover having seized on the duchies of Bremen and Verden. In conſequence of the conferences between the czar and Goertz, the former engaged to lend into Poland an army of 80,000 men, in order to dethrone that prince whom he had so long defended. He engaged alio to furniſh ſhips for tranſporting 30,000 Swedes to Germany and 10,000 into Denmark. This treaty, however, was not fully ratified ; and the king’s death, which happened in 1718, put a final ſtop to all the great proſpects of Sweden.</p><p>The king had reſolved on the conqueſt of Norway before he dethroned Auguſtus ; and as no difficulties ever deterred him, he marched his army into that cold and barren country in the month of October, when the ground wascover- ed with froſt and snow. With 18,000 men he formed the ſiege of Frederickſhall, though the ſeverity of the froſt rendered it almoſt impoſſible to break ground. Charles, however, reſolved to form trenches ; and his ſoldiers cheerfully obeyed, digging into the ground with the ſame labour as if they had been piercing a rock. On the 11th of December the king visited the trenches in the midſt of a terrible fire from the enemy, imagining that his men might be animated by his presence. He took his poſt in the moſt dangerous ſtation he could chooſe, ſtanding upon a gabion and leaning with his arm over the parapet, while the enemy were firing chain ſhot at the very ſpot where he ſtood. He was in<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0238.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0232"/>
treated to change his Ration ; but he remained obſtinate, as if he had been proof againſt cannon-bullets. At laſt he was ſeen to fall on the parapet with a deep groan. A ſmall cannon-ball had ſtruck him on the temple, beat in the left eye, and forced the right eye quite out of its ſocket ; his right hand in the mean time graſped the hilt of his ſword, as if he had meant to revenge the blow<note anchored="true" n="4" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>(c) Such is the account given by Voltaire of the untimely death of this northern hero. Many perſons, however, who had the beſt opportunities of procuring authentic information at the time, have declared that they believed he was aſſaſſinated by a Frenchman who was among his attendants. The famous earl of Peterborough, who, in his rapid marches and fearleſs intrepidity, bore no small reſemblance to Charles XII. aſſured Biſhop Berkeley, that he had no doubt of the Swediſh monarch’s having been aſſaſſinated ; and Mr Wraxall, in the account of his Travels through Sweden, gives ſuch arguments for the truth of that opinion as leave very little doubt in our minds. It muſt be confeſſed, however, that Mr Coxe reaſons plausibly in ſupport of the other opinion ; and perhaps at this diſtance of time nothing can be ſaid with certainty on this queſtion, but what has been ſaid by Johnſon :</p><p>His fall was deſtined to a barren ſtrand,</p><p>A petty fortreſs, and a <hi rend="italic">dubious hand.</hi></p><p>He left the name, at which the world grew pale,</p><p>To paint a moral, or adorn a tale.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Vanity of Human Wishes.</hi></p></note> (c).</p><p>Charles XII. was ſucceeded by his ſiſter the princess Ulrica Eleonora, wife to the hereditary prince of Hesse. On this occasion the states took care to make a previous ſtipulation for the recovery of their liberties, and obliged the princeſs to ſign a paper to this purpoſe before entering on the government. Their firſt care was to make a peace with Great Britain, which the late king intended to have invaded. The Swedes then, to prevent their farther losses by the progreſs of the Russian, the Daniſh, the Saxon, and other arms, made many great ſacrifices to obtain peace from thoſe powers. The French, however, about the year 1738, formed a dangerous party in the kingdom, under the name of the <hi rend="italic">Hats ;</hi> which not only broke the internal quiet of the kingdom, but led it into a ruinous war with Ruſſia, by which the province of Finland was left. Their Swediſh majeſties having no children, it was necessary to settle the ſucceſſion ; eſpecially as the duke of Holſtein was deſcended from the queen’s eldeſt ſiſter, and was, at the ſame time, the preſumptive heir to the empire of Ruſſia. Four competitors appeared ; the duke of Holſtein Gottorp, prince Frederic of Heſſe-Caſſel nephew to the king, the prince of Denmark, and the duke of Deux Fonts. The duke of Holſtein would have carried the election, had he not embraced the Greek religion, that he might mount the throne of Ruſſia. The czarina interpoſed, and offered to reſtore all the conqueſts ſhe had made from Sweden, excepting a ſmall diſtrict in Finland, if the Swedes would receive the duke of Holſtein’s uncle, Adolphus Frederic biſhop of Lubec, as their hereditary prince and ſucceſſor to their crown. This was agreed to ; and a peace was concluded at Abo, under the mediation of his Britannic majeſty. This peace was ſo firmly adhered to by the czarina, that his Daniſh majeſty thought proper to drop all reſentment for the indignity done his son. The prince-ſuccessor married the princeſs Ulrica, third ſiſter to the king of Pruſſia ; and in 1751 entered into the poſſeſſion of his new dignity, which proved to him a crown of thorns. Through a ſtrange medley of affairs and views of intereſt, the French had acquired vaſt influence in all the deliberations of the Swediſh ſenate, who of late have been little better than penſioners to that crown. The intrigues of the ſenators forced Adolphus to take part in the late war againſt Pruſſia : but as that war was diſagreeable not only to the people, but alſo to the king of Sweden, the nation never made ſo mean an appearance ; and upon Russia’s making peace with the king of Pruſſia, the Swedes likewiſe made their peace, upon the terms of leaving things as they stood at the beginning of the war, Adolphus died diſpirited in 1771, after a turbulent reign of twenty years ; and was ſucceeded by his son Guſtavus. The moſt remarkable tranſaction of this reign is the revolution which took place in the government in the year 1772, by which the king, from being the moſt limited became one of the moſt despotic monarchs in Europe. Ever ſince the death of Charles XII. the whole power of the kingdom had been lodged in the ſtates ; and this power they had on all occaſions moſt grievouſly abuſed. Gustavus therefore determined either to ſeize on that power of which they made ſuch a bad uſe, or periſh in the attempt. The revolution was effected in the following manner. On the morning of the 19th of Auguſt 1772, a considerable number of officers, as well as other perſons known to be attached to the royal cauſe, had been ſummoned to attend his majeſty. Before ten he was on horseback, and visited the regiment of artillery. As he paſſed through the ſtreets he was more than usually courteous to all he met, bowing familiarly to the loweſt of the people. On the king’s return to his palace, the detachment which was to mount guard that day being drawn up together with that which was to be relieved, his majeſty retired with the officers into the guard-room. He then addreſſed them with all that eloquence of which he is ſaid to have been a perfect maſter ; and after inſinuating to them that his life was in danger, he expoſed to them in the ſtrongeſt colours the wretched ſtate of the kingdom, the shackles in which it was held by means of foreign gold, and the diſſenſions and troubles ariſing from the ſame cauſe which had distracted the diet during the courſe of fourteen months. He assured them that his only deſign was to put an end to theſe disorders ; to baniſh corruption, reſtore true liberty, and revive the ancient luſtre of the Swediſh name, which had been long tarnished by a venality as notorious as it was disgraceful. Then aſſuring them in the ſtrongeſt terms that he disclaimed for ever all abſolute power, or what the Swedes call <hi rend="italic">ſovereignty,</hi> he concluded with theſe words : “ I am obliged to defend my own liberty and that of the kingdom, againſt the ariſtocracy which reigns. Will you be faithful to me, as your forefathers were to Guſtavus Vaſa and Guſtavus Adolphus ? I will then risk my life for your welfare and that of my country.”</p><p>The officers, moſt of them young men, of whoſe attachment the king had been long ſecure, who did not thoroughly perhaps see into the nature of the requeſt his majeſty made them, and were allowed no time to reflect upon it, immediately conſented to every thing, and took an oath of fidelity to him.</p><p>Three only refuſed. One of theſe, Frederic Cederſtrom, captain of a company of the guards, alleged he had already and very lately taken an oath to be faithful to the ſtates, and conſequently could not take that which his majeſty then<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0239.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0233"/>
exacted of him. The king, looking at him ſternly, anſwered, " Think of what you are doing.” “ I do, replied Cederſtrom ; and what I think to day, I ſhall think tomorrow : and were I capable of breaking the oath by which I am already bound to the ſtates, I ſhould be likewise capable of breaking that your majeſty now requeſts me to take.”</p><p>The king then ordered Cederſtrom to deliver up his sword, and put him in arreſt.</p><p>His majeſty, however, apprehenſive of the impreſſion which the proper and reſolute conduct of Cederſtrom might make upon the minds oſ the other officers, shortly afterwards softened his tone of voice ; and again addreſſing himſelf to Cederſtrom, told him, that as a proof of the opinion he entertained of him, and the confidence he placed in him, he would return him his ſword without insisting upon his taking the oath, and would only deſire his attendance that day. Cederſtrom continued firm ; he anſwered, that his majeſty could place no confidence in him that day, and that he begged to be excuſed from the ſervice.</p><p>While the king was ſhut up with the officers, Senator Ralling, to whom the command of the troops in the town had been given two days before, came to the door of the guard room, and was told that he could not be admitted. The ſenator inſiſted upon being preſent at the diſtribution of the orders, and ſent to the king to deſire it ; but was anſwered, he muſt go to the ſenate, where his majeſty would ſpeak to him.</p><p>The officers then received their orders from the king ; the firſt of which was, that the two regiments of guards and of artillery ſhould be immediately assembled, and that a detachment of 36 grenadiers ſhould be posted at the door of the council-chamber to prevent any of the ſenators from coming out.</p><p>But before the orders could be carried into execution, it was necessary that the king ſhould addreſs himſelf to the ſoldiers ; men wholly unacquainted with his deſigns, and accuſtomed to pay obedience only to the orders of the ſenate, whom they had been taught to hold in the higheſt reverence.</p><p>As his majeſty, followed by the officers, was advancing from the guard room to the parade for this purpoſe, ſome of them more cautious, or perhaps more timid than the reſt, became, on a ſhort reflection, apprehenſive of the conſequences of the meaſure in which they were engaged : they began to expreſs their fears to the king, that unleſs ſome perſons of greater weight and influence than themſelves were to take a part in the ſame cauſe, he could hardly hope to ſucceed in his enterpriſe. The king stopped a while, and appeared to heſitate. A ſerjeant of the guards overheard their diſcourſe, and cried aloud,—“ It ſhall ſucceed—Long live Guſtavus !” His majeſty immediately ſaid, " Then I will venture ;”—and ſtepping forward to the ſoldiers, he addressed them in terms nearly ſimilar to thoſe he had made uſe of to the officers, and with the same ſucceſs. They anſwered him with loud acclamations : one voice only ſaid, No ; but it was not attended to.</p><p>In the mean time ſome of the king’s emissaries had ſpread a report about the town that the king was arreſted. This drew the populace to the palace in great numbers, where they arrived as his majeſty had concluded his harangue to the guards. They teſtified by reiterated ſhouts their joy at ſeeing him ſafe ; a joy which promiſed the happieſt concluſion to the buſineſs of the day.</p><p>The ſenators were now immediately ſecured. They had from the window of the council-chamber beheld what was going forward on the parade before the palace ; and, at a loſs to know the meaning of the ſhouts they heard, were coming down to inquire into the cauſe of them, when 30 grenadiers, with their bayonets fixed, informed them it was his majeſty’s pleaſure they ſhould continue where they were. They began to talk in a high tone, but were anſwered only by having the door ſhut and locked upon them.</p><p>The moment the ſecret committee heard that the ſenate was arreſted, they ſeparated of themſelves, each individual providing for his own ſafety. The king then mounting his horſe, followed by his officers with their ſwords drawn, a large body of ſoldiers, and numbers of the populace, went to the other quarters of the town where the ſoldiers he had ordered to be assembled were poſted. He found them all equally willing to ſupport his cause, and to take an oath of fidelity to him. As he paſſed through the ſtreets, he declared to the people, that he only meant to defend them, and ſave his country ; and that if they would not confide in him, he would lay down his ſceptre, and ſurrender up his kingdom. So much was the king beloved, that the people (ſome of whom even fell down upon their knees) with tears in their eyes implored his majeſty not to abandon them.</p><p>The king proceeded in his courſe, and in leſs than an hour made himſelf maſter of all the military force in Stockholm. In the mean time the heralds, by proclamation in the ſeveral quarters of the city, summoned an aſſembly of the States for the enſuing morning, and declared all members traitors to their country who ſhould not appear. Thither his majeſty repaired in all the pomp of royalty, ſurrounded by his guards, and holding in his hand the ſilver ſceptre of Guſtavus Adolphus. In a very forcible ſpeech, he lamented the unhappy ſtate to which the country was reduced by the conduct of a party ready to ſacrifice every thing to its ambition, and reproached the ſtates with adapting their actions to the views of foreign courts, from which they received the wages of persidy. “ If any one dare contradict this, let him rise and ſpeak.”—Conviction, or fear, kept the assembly silent, and the ſecretary read the new form of government, which the king ſubmitted to the approbation of the ſtates. It consisted of fiſty-ſeven articles ; of which the following five were the chief.</p><p>1. The king has the entire power of convoking and diſſolving the aſſembly of the ſtates as often as he thinks proper. 2. His majeſty alone has the command of the army, fleet, and finances, and the diſpoſal of all offices civil and military. 3. In caſe of an invaſion, or of any pressing neceſſity, the king may impoſe taxes, without waiting for the aſſembly of the ſtates. 4. The diet can deliberate upon no other ſubjects than thoſe propoſed by the king. 5. The king ſhall not carry on an offenſive war without the conſent of the ſtates. When all the articles were gone through, the king demanded if the ſtates approved of them, and was anſwered by a general acclamation. He then diſmiſſed all the ſenators from their employments, adding, that in a few days he would appoint others ; and concluded this extraordinary ſcene by drawing out of his pocket a ſmall book of pſalms, from which, after taking off the crown, he gave out Te Deum. All the members very devoutly added their voices to his, and the hall reſounded with thankſgivings, which it is to be feared never roſe to heaven, if ſincerity was neceſſary to their paſſport.</p><p>The power thus obtained the king employed for the good of his ſubjects. He took care that the law ſhould be adminiſtered with impartiality to the richeſt noble and the pooreſt peaſant, making a ſevere example of ſuch judges as were proved to have made juſtice venal. He gave particular attention and encouragement to commerce, was a<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0240.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0234"/>
liberal and enlightened patron of learning and ſcience, and laboured ſtrenuouſly to introduce into his kingdom the moſt valuable improvements in agriculture that had been made in foreign countries.</p><p>But while thus active in promoting the arts of peace, he was not inattentive to thoſe of war. The fleet, which he found decayed and feeble, he in a few years reſtored to a reſpectable footing, and, beſides changing the regulations of the navy, he raiſed a new corps of ſailors, and formed them to the ſervice by continual exerciſe. The army, which, as well as the navy, had been neglected during the ariſtocracy, was next to be reformed. The king began by giving cloaks, tents, and new arms to all the regiments. Afterwards, under the direction of Field Marſhal Count de Heſſenſtein, a new exerciſe was introduced, and ſeveral camps were formed, in which the ſoldiery were manoeuvred by the king himſelf. The ſale of military offices, which had been permitted for many years, was entirely ſuppreſſed ; and the king provided not only for the re-eſtabliſhment of discipline and good order in the army, but for the future welfare of the individuals which compoſed it. Theſe warlike preparations were neceſſary to a plan which he had formed for entirely aboliſhing the power of the ariſtocracy, and freeing Sweden from the factions which had long been formed in it by the court of St Peterſburgh. The change which he had introduced into the conſtitution was very inimical to the intrigues of that court ; and the Russian ambassador exerted himſelf openly to bring about a rupture between the king and the diſcontented nobles. Guſtavus ordered him to quit the kingdom in eight days, and immediately prepared for war with Ruſſia. To this apparently raſh enterpriſe he was incited by the Ottoman Porte, at that time unable to oppoſe the armies of the two empires ; and his own ambition, together with the internal ſtate of his kingdom, powerfully concurred to make him lend every aſſiſtance to his ancient ally. It is needleſs for us to enter into a detail of the particulars oſ that war, which, as well as the aſtoniſhing activity and military ſkill displayed by the Swediſh monarch, are freſh in the memory of all our readers. Suffice it to ſay, that neither Guſtavus Adolphus nor Charles XII. gave greater proofs of undaunted courage and military conduct in their long and bloody wars than were given by Guſtavus the III. from the end oſ the year 1787 to 1790, when peace was reſtored between the courts of St Peterſburgh and Stockholm. Had his army remained faithful, it ſeems in a high degree probable that he would have penetrated to the metropolis of the Russian empire in the firſt campaign ; and when he was deſerted by that army, and his councils distracted by new hoſtilities commenced againſt him by the Danes, the vigour and reſources of his mind never forſook him. When the court of Copenhagen was compelled, by the means of England and Pruſſia, to withdraw its troops from the territories of Sweden, the king attacked Ruſſia with ſuch vigour both by ſea and land, diſplayed ſuch addreſs in retrieving his affairs when apparently reduced to the laſt extremity, and renewed his attacks with ſuch pertinacious courage, that the empreſs lowered the haughtiness of her tone, and was glad to treat with Guſtavus as an equal and independent ſovereign.</p><p>The king of Sweden was now at liberty to cheriſh again the arts of peace, and to humble the haughty ſpirit of the nobles. For his attempting to deprive thole men of that power which they had for many years employed againſt their country, he has been held up to the world as a deſpot who trampled on the liberties of his ſubjects ; as a man without ſincerity or patriotiſm ; and, in one word, as a perjured tyrant, who overthrew the conſtitution which he had ſworn to maintain. That he was not troubled with a ſcrupulous</p><p>conſcience, when ſo artfully conducting the revolution of 1772, muſt be acknowleged ; nor can it be denied, that in his treaties with other powers he ſometimes endeavoured to overreach them : but if the neceſſities of ſtate could in any caſe be an apology for falſehood, they would ſufficiently apologize for the duplicity of Guſtavus. He was engaged in the arduous enterpriſe of freeing his ſubjects from an ariſtocratic tyranny ſupported by a foreign power the moſt formidable in the north ; he had been forced into a war with that power, and, as there is reaſon to believe, promiſed aſſiſtance which he never received ; and it cannot excite wonder nor great indignation, that, as ſoon as he could make an honourable peace, he embraced the opportunity without paying much regard to the intereſts of an alliance, which tamely looked on while he was ſtruggling with difficulties apparently unſurmountable. That the revolution which he effected in his own country was calculated to promote the general good of the people, is unqueſtionable ; and to gain ſuch an object he might ſurely reſtore the crown to its ancient ſplendor, without bringing upon his government the odious epithet of <hi rend="italic">deſpotiſm.</hi></p><p>The nobles, however, continued diſcontented, and a conſpiracy was planned againſt Guſtavus under his own roof. He had entered into the alliance that was formed againſt the revolutionary government of France ; and to raiſe an army which he was to lead in perſon to cooperate with the emperor and the king of Pruſſia, he was obliged to negotiate large loans, and to impoſe upon his ſubjects heavy taxes. The nobles took advantage of that circumstance to prejudice the minds of many of the people againſt the ſovereign who had laboured ſo long for their real good. On the 16th of March 1792, he received an anonymous letter, warning him of his immediate danger from a plot that was laid to take away his life, requeſting him to remain at home, and avoid balls for a year ; and assuring him that, if he ſhould go to the maſquerade for which he was preparing, he would be aſsaſſinated that very night. The king read the note with contempt, and at a late hour entered the ball room. Alter ſome time he ſat down in a box with the compte D’Eſſen, and observed that he was not deceived in his contempt for the letter, ſince had there been any deſign againſt his life, no time could be more favourable than that moment. He then mingled, without apprehenſion, among the crowd ; and juſt as he was preparing to retire in company with the Pruſſian ambaſſador, he was ſurrounded by ſeveral perſons in maſks, one of whom tired a piſtol at the back of the king, and lodged the contents in his body. A ſcene of dreadful confuſion immediately enſued. The conſpirators, amidſt the general tumult and alarm, had time to retire to other parts of the room ; but one of them had previouſly dropped his piſtols and a dagger cloſe by the wounded king. A general order was given to all the company to unmaſk, and the doors were immediately cloſed ; but no perſon appeared with any particular diſtinguiſhing marks of guilt. The king was immediately conveyed to his apartment ; and the surgeon, after extracting a ball and dome ſlugs, gave favourable hopes of his majeſty’s recovery.</p><p>Suſpicions immediately fell upon such of the nobles as had been notorious for their oppoſition to the meaſures of the court. The anonymous letter was traced up to colonel Liljehorn, major in the king’s guards, and he was immediately apprehended. But the moſt ſucceſsful clue that ſeemed to offer was in conſequence of the weapons which had fallen from the aſſaſſin. An order was iſſued, directing all the armourers, guriſmiths, and cutlets in Stockholm, to give every information in their power to the officers of juſtice concerning the weapons. A gunſmith who had repaired the piſtols readily recognized them to be the same which<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0241.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0235"/>
he had repaired ſome time ſince for a nobleman of the name of Ankarſtrom, a captain in the army ; and the cutler who had made the dagger referred at once to the ſame perſon.</p><p>The king languiſhed from the 17th to the 29th of March. At firſt the reports of his medical attendants were favourable ; but on the 28th a mortification was found to have taken place, which terminated his exiſtence in a few hours. On opening his body, a ſquare piece of lead and two ruſty nails were found unextracted within the ribs.</p><p>During his illneſs, and particularly after he was made acquainted with the certainty of his approaching disſolution, Guſtavus continued to diſplay that unſhaken courage which he had manifeſted on every occaſion during his life. A few hours before his deceaſe he made ſome alterations in the arrangement of public affairs. He had before, by his will, appointed a council of regency ; but convinced, by recent experience, how little he could depend on the attachment of his nobles, and being alſo aware of the neceſſity of a ſtrong government in difficult times, he appointed his brother, the duke of Sudermania, ſole regent, till his ſon, who was then about fourteen, ſhall have attained the age of eighteen years. His laſt words were a declaration of pardon to the conspirators againſt his life. The actual murderer alone was excepted ; and he was excepted only at the ſtrong inſtance of the regent, and thoſe who ſurrounded his majeſty in his dying moments. Immediately on the death of the king, the young prince was proclaimed by the title of Guſtavus IV.</p><p>Ankarſtrom was no ſooner apprehended, than he confessed with an air of triumph, that he was the perſon “ who had endeavoured to liberate his country from a monſter and a tyrant ” Suſpicions at the ſame time fell on the counts Horn and Ribbing, baron Pechlin, baron Ehrenſvard, baron Hartſmandorf, Von Engerſtrom the royal ſecretary, and others ; and theſe ſuſpicions were confirmed by the confeſſion of Ankarſtrom. After a very fair and ample trial, this man was condemned to be publicly and ſeverely whipped on three ſucceſſive days, his right hand and his head to be cut off, and his body impaled ; which ſentence he suffered not till the 17th of May, long after the death of the king. —His property was given to his children, who, however, were compelled to change their name.</p><p>The counts Horn and Ribbing were condemned to loſe their right hands, and to be decapitated. Col. Liljehorn and lieutenant Ehrenjwerd were alſo to be beheaded.— All theſe conſpirators were degraded from the rank of nobles, and their property declared to be confiscated. Major Hartmanſdorf was to forfeit his rank in the army, and to be imprisoned for one year. Engerſtrom was to ſuffer perpetual impriſonment, and baron Pechlin and ſecretary Lilleſtrahle to be impriſoned during pleaſure. Four others, accuſed of being concerned in the conſpiracy, were pardoned, and ſome were acquitted.</p><p>The kingdom of Sweden, in its preſent ſtate, is divided into the following provinces: 1. Sweden Proper. <hi rend="italic">2.</hi> Gothland. 3. Finland. 4. Swediſh Lapland. And, 5. The Swediſh iſlands. Great abatements muſt be made for the lakes and unimproved parts of Sweden, which are ſo extenſive that the habitable part is confined to narrow bounds.</p><p>The face of Sweden is pretty ſimilar to thoſe of its neighbouring countries ; only it has the advantage of navigable rivers.</p><p>The ſame may be ſaid with regard to its climate, ſoil, &amp;c. Summer burſts from winter ; and vegetation is more ſpeedy than in ſouthern climates. Stoves and warm furs mitigate the cold of winter, which is ſo intenſe, that the noſes and extremities of the inhabitants are ſometimes mortified. The Swedes, ſince the days of Charles XII. have been at incredible pains to correct the native barrenneſs of their country, by erecting colleges of agriculture, and in ſome places with great ſucceſs. The ſoil is much the ſame with that of Denmark and ſome parts of Norway, generally very bad, but in ſome valleys ſurprisingly fertile. The Swedes, till of late years, had not induſtry ſufficient to remedy the one, nor improve the other. The peaſants now follow the agriculture of France and England ; and ſome late accounts ſay, that they rear almoſt as much grain as maintains the natives. Gothland produces wheat, rye, barley, oats, pease, and beans ; and in caſe of deficiency, the people are ſupplied from Livonia and the Baltic provinces. In ſummer, the fields are verdant, and covered with flowers ; and produce ſtrawberries, raſpberries, currants, and other ſmall fruits, The common people know, as yet, little of the cultivation of apricots, peaches, nectarines, pine-apples, and the like high-flavoured fruits ; but melons are brought to great perfection in dry seasons.</p><p>Sweden produces cryſtals, amethyſts, topazes, porphyry, lapis lazuli, agate, cornelian, marble, and other fossils. The chief wealth of the country, however, arises from her mines of ſilver, copper, lead, and iron. The laſt-mentioned metal employs no fewer than 450 forges, hammeringmills, and ſmehing-houſes. A kind of a gold mine has likewiſe been diſcovered in Sweden ; but ſo inconſiderable, that from the year 1741 to 1747, it produced only 2398 gold ducats, each valued at 9s. 4d. ſterling. The firſt gallery of one ſilver mine is 100 fathoms below the ſurface of the earth ; the roof is ſupported by prodigious oaken beams, and from thence the miners deſcend about 40 fathoms to the loweſt vein. This mine is ſaid to produce 20,000 crowns a-year. The product of the copper mines is uncertain ; but the whole is loaded with vaſt taxes and reductions to the government, which has no other reſources for the exigences of ſtate. Thoſe ſubterraneous manſions are aſtoniſhingly ſpacious, and at the ſame time commodious for their inhabitants, ſo that they ſeem to form a hidden world. The water-falls in Sweden afford excellent conveniency for turning mills for forges ; and for ſome years the exports of iron from Sweden brought in 300,000 l. ſterling. Dr Buſching thinks that they conſtituted two-thirds of the national revenue. It muſt, however, be obſerved, that the extortions of the Swediſh government, and the importation of American bar-iron into Europe, and ſome other cauſes, have greatly diminiſhed this manufacture in Sweden ; ſo that the Swedes very soon muſt apply themſelves to other branches of trade and improvements, eſpecially in agriculture.</p><p>The animals differ little from thoſe of Norway and Denmark, only the Swediſh horſe are known to be more ſerviceable in war than the German. The fiſhes found in the rivers and lakes oſ Sweden are the ſame with thoſe in other northern countries, and taken in such quantities, that their pikes (particularly) are ſalted and pickled for exportation. The train-oil of the ſeals, taken in the gulph of Finland, is a conſiderable article of exportation.</p><p>There is a great diverſity of characters among the people of Sweden ; and what is peculiarly remarkable among them, they have been known to have different characters in different ages. At preſent, their peaſants ſeem to be a heavy plodding race of men, ſtrong and hardy ; but without any other ambition than that of ſubſiſting themſelves and their families as well as they can : they are honeſt, ſimple, and hoſpitable ; and the mercantile claſſes are much of the ſame caſt ; but great application and perseverance is diſcovered among them all. One could form no idea that the modern Swedes are the deſcendants of those who, under Guſtavus Adolphus and Charles XII. carried terror in their<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0242.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0236"/>
names through the moſt diſtant countries, and ſhook the foundations of the greateſt empires. The principal nobility and gentry of Sweden are naturally brave, polite, and hoſpitable ; they have high and warm notions of honour, and are jealous of their national intereſts. The dreſs of the common people is almoſt the ſame with that of Denmark : the better sort are infatuated with French modes and faſhion. The common diverſions of the Swedes are, ſkating, running races in sledges, and ſailing in yachts upon the ice. They are not fond of marrying their daughters when young, as they have little to ſpare in their own life-time. The women go to plough, threſh out the corn, row upon the water, ſerve the brick layers, carry burdens, and do all the common drudgeries in huſbandry.</p><p>Chriſtianity was introduced here in the 9th century. Their religion is Lutheran, which was propagated among them by Gustavus Vaſa, about the year 1523, as we have already related. The Swedes are ſurpriſingly uniform and unremitting in religions matters ; and have ſuch an aversion to Popery, that caſtration is the fate of every Roman Catholic prieſt diſcovered in their country. The archbiſhop of Upsal has a revenue of about 400 l. a-year ; and has under him thirteen ſuffragans, besides superintendants, with moderate ſtipends. No clergyman has the leaſt direction in the affairs of ſtate ; but their morals, and the ſanctity of their lives, endear them ſo much to the people, that the government would repent making them its enemies. Their churches are neat, and often ornamented. A body of eccleſiaſtſeal laws and canons direct their religious economy. A converſion to Popery, or a long continuance under excommunication, which cannot pass without the king’s permiſſion, is punished by impriſonment and exile.</p><p>The Swediſh language is a dialect oſ the Teutonic, and reſembles that of Denmark. The Swediſh nobility and gentry are, in general, more converſant in polite literature than thoſe of many other more flouriſhing states. They have of late exhibited ſome noble ſpecimens of their munificence for the improvement of literature and ſcience, particularly natural hiſtory.</p><p>The Swediſh commonalty ſubſiſts by agriculture, mining, grazing, hunting, and fiſhing. Their materials for traffic are the bulky and uſeful commodities of maſts, beams, and other sorts of timber for ſhipping ; tar, pitch, bark of trees, potaſh, wooden utenſils, hides, flax, hemp, peltry, furs, copper, lead, iron, cordage, and fiſh.</p><p>Even the manufacturing of iron was introduced into Sweden ſo late as the 16th century ; for till that time they sold their own crude ore to the Hanſe-towns, and bought it back again manufactured into utenſils. About the middle of the 17th century, by the aſſiſtance of the Dutch and Flemings, they let up ſome manulactures of glaſs, ſtarch, tin, woollen, ſilk, ſoap, leather-dreſſing, and saw-mills. Bookſelling was at that time a trade unknown in Sweden. They have ſince had ſugar-baking, tobacco-plantations, and manufactures of ſail-cloth, cotton, fuſtian, and other stuffs ; alſo of linen, alum, brimstone, paper-mills, and gunpowdermills. Vaſt quantities of copper, braſs, ſteel, and iron, are now wrought in Sweden, dug from mines, ſome of them more than 1100 feet deep. The iron mine of Dannemora, which is much the moſt profitable of any of thoſe with which every part of Sweden abounds, is ſaid to yield 60lb. of metal in a 100lb. of ore, and the others about 30lb. The iron extracted from this is known in Europe under the name oſ <hi rend="italic">Oregrund ;</hi> which name is derived from a ſea-port on the Baltic. A large portion of it is employed by different nations for making the beſt ſteel. The mine was diſcovered in 1470. The unwrought ore was firſt ſold to the merchants of Lubeck. It was not until the reign of Guſtavus Vaſa that the Swedes worked it themſelves. It is asserted, that the mine of Dannemora yields about 49,000 ſtones of bar-iron <hi rend="italic">per</hi> year, which is ſuppoſed to be one tenth part of the quantity which all the iron-mines of Sweden produce. Of this product, amounting to 400,000 ſtones, 300,000 are annually exported ; the remainder is manufactured at home. It is calculated that no leſs than 25,600 men are employed in mining, and the branches immediately connected with it, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> 4000 for breaking the rocks, either by exploſion or manual labour; 10,800 to hew timber and burn it into charcoal ; 2000 are employed in smelting ; 1800 in tranſporting the metal from the furnaces to the forges ; 6co in tranſporting sand, fuel, &amp;c. 4000 for tranſporting the charcoal, and 2400 at the forges. They have alſo founderies for cannon, forgeries for fire-arms and anchors, armories, wire and flatting-mills, mills alſo for fulling, and for boring and ſtamping : and of late they have built many ſhips for ſale.</p><p>There are likewiſe in Sweden ſome ſilver mines, of which that of <hi rend="italic">Salha,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Salhberg,</hi> is the richeſt as well as the moſt ancient. It existed ſo early as 1188, and, during the whole of the 14th century, it yielded 24,000 marks of ſilver <hi rend="italic">per annum.</hi> In the 15th century the quantity was diminiſhed to 20,000. In the reign of Charles X. it give only 2000, and it furniſhes at preſent ſtill leſs, the ore yielding only one ounce of pure metal <hi rend="italic">per</hi> quintal. The chief gallery where the pureſt ſilver was obtained having fallen in, is not yet cleared, notwithstanding their inceſſant labour. They are alſo digging pits in a perpendicular direction, in order to arrive at the principal vein, which extends itſelf from the north to the ſouth-eaſt. Formerly lead employed in ſeparating the metal was imported from England ; but the mine furniſhes at preſent a sufficient quantity for the purpoſe.</p><p>Certain towns in Sweden, being 24 in number, are called <hi rend="italic">Staple-towns,</hi> where the merchants are allowed to import and export commodities in their own ſhips. Thoſe towns which have no foreign commerce, though lying near the ſea, are called <hi rend="italic">land-towns.</hi> A third kind are termed m <hi rend="italic">ine-towns,</hi> as belonging to mine-districts. The Swedes, about the year 1752, had greatly increaſed their exports, and diminiſhed their imports, moſt part of which arrive or are ſent off in Swediſh ſhips; the Swedes having now a kind of navigation act like that of the Engliſh. Those promiſing appearances were, however, blaſted by the madneſs and jealousies of the Swediſh government ; and the people ſo oppreſſed with taxes, that ſome important revolution was daily expected in that kingdom.</p><p>The revenue of Sweden, ſince the unfortunate wars of Charles XII. has been greatly reduced. Her gold and ſilver ſpecies, in the reign of Ad. Frederic, aroſe chiefly from the king’s German dominions. Formerly, the crown-lands, pollmoney, tithes, mines, and other articles, are ſaid to have produced a million ſterling. The payments that are made in copper, which is here the chief medium of commerce, is extremely inconvenient ; ſome of thoſe pieces being as large as tiles ; and a cart or wheelbarrow is often required to carry home a moderate ſum. The Swedes, however, have gold ducats, and eight-mark pieces of ſilver, valued each at 5s. 2d. and the ſubſidies paid them by France help to increaſe their currency.</p><p>No country in the world has produced greater heroes or braver troops than the Swedes ; and yet they cannot be ſaid to maintain a Handing army, as their forces conſiſt of a regulated militia. The cavalry is clothed, armed, and maintained, by a rate raised upon the nobility and gentry, according to their estates ; and the infantry by the peaſants. Each province is obliged to find its proportion of ſoldiers,<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0243.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0237"/>
according to the number of farms it contains; every farm of 60 l. or 70 l. <hi rend="italic">per annum</hi> is charged with a foot-ſoldier, furniſhing him with diet, lodging, and ordinary clothes, and about 20s. a-year in money ; or else a little wooden houſe is built him by the farmer, who allows him hay and paſturage for a cow, and ploughs and ſows land enough to ſupply him with bread. When embodied, they are ſubject to military law, but otherwiſe to the civil law of the country. It may therefore literally be laid, that every Swediſh soldier has a property in the country he defends. This national army is thought to amount to above 50,000 men. Sweden formerly could have fitted out 40 ſhips of the line.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
