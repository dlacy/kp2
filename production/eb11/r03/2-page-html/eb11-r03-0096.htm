<p><span class="font0">sufficiently by the scour produced between the training walls, without placing these walls so close together and raising them so&nbsp;high as to check the tidal influx and produce accretion behind them,&nbsp;thereby materially reducing the volume of tidal water entering&nbsp;and flowing out of the estuaiy at each tide. The high training&nbsp;works in the Dce estuary, carried out in the iSth century with the&nbsp;object of land reclamation, unduly narrowed the channel, and led it&nbsp;towards one side of the estuary; and though they effectually fixed&nbsp;the navigation channel, they produced very little increase in its&nbsp;depth, but caused a very large amount of sand to accumulate in&nbsp;the estuary beyond, owing to the great reduction in tidal volume&nbsp;by the reclamations, and diminished considerably the channel&nbsp;through the lower estuaiy in width and depth without checking its&nbsp;wanderings.@@<sup>1</sup> The training of the channel of the Ribble through&nbsp;its estuary below Preston, for improving its depth and rendering&nbsp;it stable, was begun in 1839, and has been gradually extended at&nbsp;intervals; but the works have not yet been carried out to deep&nbsp;water, and a shifting, shallow channel still exists through the&nbsp;sand banks, between the end of the training walls and the open&nbsp;sea. The high training walls adopted along the upper part of the&nbsp;channel enabled the upper end of the estuary on both sides to be</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">reclaimed for a length of 4 m.; whilst the half-tide training walls below, placed unduly close together, have led to considerable&nbsp;accretion at the sides of the estuary and some extension of the&nbsp;sand banks seawards. Moreover, by fixing the channel near the&nbsp;northern shore they have enabled the landowners to carry out large&nbsp;reclamations on tne southern foreshore. These works, however,&nbsp;besides fixing the navigable channel, have increased its depth,&nbsp;especially in the upper part, and augmented the tidal scour along it&nbsp;by lowering the low-water line; and the trained channel is further&nbsp;deepened by dredging. The training works in the Weser estuary&nbsp;have been confined to constructing a single low training wall at the&nbsp;upper end, which forms a trumpet-shaped outlet for the river below&nbsp;Bremerhaven, and to guiding the navigable channel by occasional&nbsp;low dikes at the side and closing minor channels, Soastoconcentrate&nbsp;the tidal scour and fresh-water discharge in it, whilst additional&nbsp;depth is obtained by dredging (fig. 21). A remarkable improvement has been effected in the navigable condition of the upper&nbsp;portion of the Seine estuary by training works, begun in 1848; for&nbsp;in place of a shallow, intricate channel through shifting sand banks,&nbsp;whose dangers were at times intensified by a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">bore,</span><span class="font0"> a stable deep&nbsp;channel has been provided down to about half-way between Berville&nbsp;and St Sauveur, rendering access easy to the river above at high</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">tide (figs. 25 and 26). The channel, however, was made too narrow between Aizier and Berville and was subsequently enlarged, and&nbsp;large tracts of land were reclaimed in the upper estuary. The&nbsp;reduction in tidal capacity by the reclamations, together with the&nbsp;fixing and undue restriction in width of the channel, occasioned&nbsp;very large accretions at the back of the lower portions of the training&nbsp;walls and at the sides of the estuary beyond them, and an extension&nbsp;of the sand banks seawards. Moreover, the channel has always&nbsp;remained shallow and unstable beyond the ends of the training&nbsp;walls down to deep water near the mouth of the estuary.@@<sup>2</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Conclusions about Training Works in Estuaries.—</span><span class="font0">Experience has proved that training works through sandy estuaries, by&nbsp;stopping the wanderings of the navigable channel, produce an&nbsp;increase in its depth, and, consequently, in the tidal scour for maintaining it. This scour, however, being concentrated in the trained&nbsp;channel, is withdrawn lrom the sides of the estuary, which in its&nbsp;natural condition is stirred up periodically by the wandering&nbsp;channel ; and, therefore, accretion takes place in the parts of the&nbsp;estuary from which the tidal scour and fresh-water discharge have&nbsp;been permanently diverted, especially where an abundance of sand&nbsp;from outside, put in suspension by the action of the prevalent</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">winds blowing into the estuary, is brought in by the flood-tide, as in the cases of the estuaries of the Dee, the Ribble and the Seine.&nbsp;This accretion reduces the tidal capacity of the estuary, and, producing a diminution in the tidal volume passing through the outlet,&nbsp;promotes the extension of the sand banks seawards, as indicated&nbsp;by the difference in the outer portions of the longitudinal sections&nbsp;of different dates of the Weser and Seine estuaries (figs. 22 and 26).&nbsp;To prevent as far as possible the reduction in tidal capacity, the&nbsp;training walls should not be raised more above low-water level than&nbsp;absolutely necessary to fix the channel; and the rate of enlargement of their width apart should not be less than 1 in 80 at the&nbsp;upper end, and should increase considerably towards the mouth&nbsp;of the estuary so as to form a trumpet-shaped outlet. The loss of&nbsp;scour in the channel resulting from this enlargement must be compensated for by dredging to attain the requisite depth. Training&nbsp;works partially carried out through an estuary have the advantage&nbsp;of reducing the length of shallow channel to be traversed between&nbsp;deep water and the entrance to the deepened river; but as these&nbsp;works produce no influence on the channel for any distance beyond&nbsp;their termination, a shallow, shifting channel is always found between the end of the trained channel and deep water. Accordingly,&nbsp;when training works are started at the head of a sandy estuary,&nbsp;provision should always be made in their design for their eventual</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
