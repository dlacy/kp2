<p><span class="font0">or complications which are apt to attend its progress. Among these may be mentioned excessive fever (hyperpyrexia), which is sometimes developed in a sudden and&nbsp;alarming manner, the temperature rising quickly to&nbsp;108<sup>o</sup>-110<sup>o</sup> or more, and thus endangering life. Indeed&nbsp;in most of such instances death speedily follows unless&nbsp;prompt treatment be resorted to. Another danger is&nbsp;the occurrence of serious head symptoms in the form of&nbsp;delirium or excitement, which may exist in conjunction&nbsp;with hyperpyrexia or independently. Chorea or St Vitus’s&nbsp;dance is also an occasional accompaniment of acute&nbsp;rheumatism. Besides these, other complications pertaining&nbsp;to the respiratory organs, such as pleurisy, pneumonia,&nbsp;bronchitis, &amp;c., sometimes arise in the course of the disease,&nbsp;as well as certain disorders of the skin. But the most&nbsp;frequent and important of all are those affecting the heart.&nbsp;These cardiac affections are regarded by some as an integral&nbsp;part of the rheumatic disease rather than as results of it,&nbsp;especially as it would seem that occasionally they are the&nbsp;Only local manifestation of the attack.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Pericarditis (inflammation of the investing membrane of the heart) and endocarditis (inflammation of the lining&nbsp;membrane of the heart) are the two most common forms&nbsp;which these heart complications assume, and it is the&nbsp;latter which is specially important as tending to lay the&nbsp;foundation for valvular heart disease (see Heart). It is&nbsp;the liability to these inflammatory heart affections that&nbsp;causes special anxiety during the earlier stages of an&nbsp;attack of acute rheumatism, when it would appear they&nbsp;are more apt to occur. The risk of cardiac complications&nbsp;seems to be greater the younger the patient, and doubtless the foundation of organic heart disease is often laid in&nbsp;early childhood, when, as is now well known, rheumatism&nbsp;is by no means uncommon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The name </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">subacute rheumatism</span><span class="font0"> is sometimes applied to attacks of the disease of less severe type than that now&nbsp;described, but where yet the symptoms exist in a well-marked degree. Cases of this kind may be of even longer&nbsp;duration and more intractable than the more acute variety,&nbsp;although probably the danger to the heart is less.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Chronic Rheumatism appears occasionally to be developed as the result of the acute form, but is more frequently an independent constitutional affection, and is usually a&nbsp;complaint of later life. The causes associated with its&nbsp;occurrence are habitual exposure to cold and damp; hence&nbsp;its frequency among outdoor workers. It is also apt to&nbsp;arise in persons debilitated by overwork or privation.&nbsp;Certain poisons introduced into the system are often&nbsp;attended with symptoms of chronic rheumatism, e.&lt;∕., lead,&nbsp;syphilis, &amp;c. This disease is often hereditary. It differs&nbsp;from acute rheumatism in being less frequently attended&nbsp;with fever and constitutional disturbance and less liable to&nbsp;dangerous complications, but on the other hand it is much&nbsp;more apt to produce permanent alterations in the joints&nbsp;and parts affected. The joints tend to become swollen&nbsp;both from effusion of fluid and from chronic inflammatory&nbsp;thickening of the textures, and the result is stiffness and&nbsp;sometimes complete immobility. But in addition the&nbsp;sheaths of muscles and of nerves are apt to be affected by&nbsp;chronic rheumatism, causing much suffering. This form&nbsp;of rheumatism is less migratory in its progress than the&nbsp;acute, and tends to remain fixed in a few joints, often in&nbsp;those which are specially exposed to atmospheric influences&nbsp;or to overwork. The chief symptoms are pain and stiffness&nbsp;in movement, more particularly when the efforts begin to&nbsp;be made, becoming less after the limbs and body have&nbsp;been in exercise. Creaking or crackling noises accompany&nbsp;the movements. The pain is apt to be increased during&nbsp;the night, and is besides markedly influenced by the state</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">of the atmosphere, cold and damp aggravating it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This form of rheumatism, although not directly dangerous to life, tends to lower the health and render the patient more vulnerable to other morbid influences. Besides this,&nbsp;by long continuance it may lead to great deformity and&nbsp;disablement of the frame, in some instances resulting in a&nbsp;condition of utter helplessness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Treatment.—</span><span class="font0">Few diseases have had so many remedies recommended for their alleviation, and vaunted as specifics,&nbsp;as rheumatism ; and, when it is remembered how many are&nbsp;the theories of the nature of the malady, it is obvious that&nbsp;even as regards principles the methods proposed must be&nbsp;numerous and diverse. Nevertheless, there are certain&nbsp;well-recognized systems of treatment which in most&nbsp;instances will be found to be of benefit. The treatment&nbsp;differs in the two forms of the disease. As regards acute&nbsp;rheumatism the general management of the case from the&nbsp;outset requires attention. The patient should be placed&nbsp;in bed between blankets, and should wear a flannel shirt,&nbsp;the front and arms of which should be opened to admit of&nbsp;the examination of the heart and of the joints. Movements of all kinds should be as far as possible avoided.&nbsp;The affected joints should be enveloped in cotton wool,&nbsp;kept in position by a light bandage. Sometimes the&nbsp;bathing of these parts with warm water containing opium&nbsp;or other sedative affords relief. The local application of&nbsp;blisters in the neighbourhood of the painful joints, as proposed by Dr Herbert Davies, is in some instances followed&nbsp;with benefit, but is obviously applicable only where the&nbsp;rheumatism is limited in its extent. The same may be&nbsp;said of the local application of electricity to the joints.&nbsp;Constitutional remedies are of undoubted value in this&nbsp;disease, and the number of available agents for this&nbsp;purpose is so large that mention can only be briefly made&nbsp;of some of the more approved. For long the alkalis,&nbsp;especially the salts of potassium, were the chief remedies&nbsp;resorted to, and for them it was claimed that they&nbsp;shortened the attack, relieved pain, and prevented heart&nbsp;complications. They are certainly very valuable in many&nbsp;instances. Of late a new series of substances has been&nbsp;tried with great success, namely salicin (first suggested for&nbsp;acute rheumatism by Dr T. J. Maclagan), salicylic acid,&nbsp;and salicylate of soda. These remedies, which are known&nbsp;to have a powerful effect in reducing febrile temperatures,&nbsp;appear to exercise a special influence in acute rheumatism,&nbsp;not merely by lowering the fever, but by relieving pain and&nbsp;cutting short the attack, thereby lessening the risk of&nbsp;complications. From 20 to 30 grains of these drugs&nbsp;every two hours require to be given for about twenty-four&nbsp;hours in order to produce the desired effect, and the&nbsp;quantity is reduced as the acute symptoms subside.&nbsp;Although they do not succeed in all cases, and sometimes&nbsp;give rise to symptoms (delirium, sickness, &lt;fcc.) which&nbsp;necessitate their suspension, it will be admitted by most&nbsp;physicians that cases which appeared likely to be of a&nbsp;severe character have under this treatment been cut short&nbsp;in a few days, and that even where this result was not&nbsp;attained the pain and other distressing symptoms were&nbsp;materially alleviated. Tonics, such as iron and quinine,&nbsp;have also been employed in acute rheumatism, but their&nbsp;advantage is more apparent in the convalescence, when&nbsp;there are anæmia and debility, rather than in the height&nbsp;of the disease. The pain and sleeplessness may render&nbsp;necessary the administration of opiates, but in many&nbsp;instances both are completely overcome by the remedies&nbsp;previously mentioned. In the dangerous complication of&nbsp;hyperpyrexia the cold bath (in which the water is quickly&nbsp;cooled down from 94° to 68°) has frequently been successful in speedily lowering the temperature and saving&nbsp;life. Persons who have suffered from acute rheumatism&nbsp;should ever afterwards be careful to avoid exposure to</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
