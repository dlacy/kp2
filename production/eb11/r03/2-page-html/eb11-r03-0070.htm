<p><span class="font1">distinct river systems in Rio Grande do Sul—that of the eastern slope draining to the tide-water lakes, and that of&nbsp;the La Plata basin draining westward to the Uruguay. Fully&nbsp;one-third of the state belongs to the La Plata drainage basin.&nbsp;The larger rivers of the eastern group are the Jacuhy, Sinos,&nbsp;Cahy, Gravatahy and Camaquam, which flow into the Lagoa&nbsp;dos Patos, and the Jaguarao which flows into the Lagôa Mirim.&nbsp;All of the first named, except the Camaquam, discharge into&nbsp;one of the two arms or estuaries opening into the northern&nbsp;end </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font1">Lagôa dos Patos, which is called the Rio Guahyba,&nbsp;though in reality it is not a river. It is broad, comparatively&nbsp;deep and about 35 m. long, and with the rivers discharging&nbsp;into it affords upwards of 200 m. of fluvial navigation. The&nbsp;Jacuhy is one of the most important rivers of the state, rising&nbsp;intherangesof the Coxilha (Cuchilla) Grande of the North&nbsp;and flowing S. and S.E. to the Guahyba estuary, with a course&nbsp;of nearly 300 m. It has two large tributaries—the Vaccacahy&nbsp;from the S. and the Taquary from the N.—besides many&nbsp;small streams. The Jaguarao, which forms part of the boundary&nbsp;line with Uruguay, is navigable 26 m., up to and beyond the&nbsp;town of Jaguarao. Of the many streams flowing northward&nbsp;and westward to the Uruguay, the largest are the Ijuhy-guassfi, of the plateau region, the Ibicuhy, which has its source&nbsp;in the central part of the state, near Santa Maria, and flows&nbsp;westward to the Uruguay a short distance above Uruguayana&nbsp;and the Quarahim, or Quarahy, which forms part of the&nbsp;boundary line with Uruguay. The Uruguay river itself is&nbsp;formed by the confluence of the Rio das Canôas and Rio Pelotas&nbsp;in about long. 51° 30' W. With its southern confluent, the&nbsp;Rio Pelotas, which has its source in the Serra do Mar, on the&nbsp;Atlantic coast, it forms the northern and western boundary&nbsp;line of the state down to the mouth of the Quarahim, on the&nbsp;Uruguayan frontier. In addition to the Lagôa dos Patos and&nbsp;Lagôa Mirim there are a number of small lakes on the sandy,&nbsp;swampy peninsulas that lie between the coast and these two,&nbsp;and there are others of a similar character along the northern&nbsp;coast. The largest lake is the Lagôa dos Patos (Lake of the&nbsp;Patos—an Indian tribe inhabiting its shores at the time of&nbsp;the discovery), which lies parallel with the coast-line, N.E.&nbsp;and S.W., and is about 133 m. long exclusive of the two arms&nbsp;at its northern end, 25 and 35 m. long respectively, and of its&nbsp;outlet, the Rio Grande, about 24 m. long. Its width varies&nbsp;from 22 to 36 m. The lake is comparatively shallow and filled&nbsp;with sand banks, making its navigable channels tortuous and&nbsp;difficult. The Lagôa Mirim occupies a similar position farther&nbsp;S., on the Uruguayan frontier, and is about 108 m. long by&nbsp;6 to 22 m. wide. It is more irregular in outline and discharges&nbsp;into Lagôa dos Patos through a navigable channel known as&nbsp;the Rio Sâo Gonçalo. A part of the lake lies in Uruguayan&nbsp;territory, but its navigation, as determined by treaty, belongs&nbsp;exclusively to Brazil. Both of these lakes are evidently the&nbsp;remains of an ancient depression in the coast-line shut in by&nbsp;sand beaches built up by the combined action of wind and&nbsp;current. They are of the same level as the ocean, but their&nbsp;waters are affected by the tides and are brackish only a short&nbsp;distance above the Rio Grande outlet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rio Grande lies within the South Temperate zone and has a mild, temperate climate, except in the coastal zone where it is semi-tropical.&nbsp;There are only two well-marked seasons, though the transition periods&nbsp;between them (about two months each) are sometimes described&nbsp;as spring and autumn. The winter months, June to September,&nbsp;are characterized by heavy rains and by cold westerly winds, called&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">minuanos,</span><span class="font1"> which sometimes lower the temperature to the freezing&nbsp;point, especially in the mountainous districts. Snow is unknown,&nbsp;but ice frequently forms on inland waters during cold winter nights,&nbsp;only to disappear with the first rays of the sun. In summer, which&nbsp;is nominally a dry season, light rains are common, northerly and&nbsp;easterly winds prevail, and the temperature rises to 95° in the&nbsp;shade. Cases of insolation are not rare. Malaria is unusual and&nbsp;the state has a high reputation for healthiness, though insanitary&nbsp;conditions are responsible for various diseases in large communities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The principal industry of the state is stock-raising, especially on the southern plains, where large </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">estancias</span><span class="font1"> (ranches) are to be found.&nbsp;This industry originated with the Jesuit missions on the Uruguay&nbsp;early in the 17th century, and its development here has been much&nbsp;the same as in Argentina and Uruguay. No general effort was&nbsp;made before the 20th century to improve the herds by the importation of better breeds, and the industry was practically in a state&nbsp;of decay until higher tariff rates were imposed on imported </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">carne&nbsp;secca</span><span class="font1"> (jerked beef) toward the end of the 19th century. The export&nbsp;of live-stock is insignificant, the practice being to sell the cattle to&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">xarqueadas</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">saladeros.</span><span class="font1"> where they are slaughtered for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">xarque,&nbsp;charqui</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">came Secca<sub>f</sub></span><span class="font1"> which is usually prepared by salting and&nbsp;drying in the sun. The jerked beef is largely exported to other&nbsp;Brazilian states for consumption, while the hides and other byproducts are exported to Europe and the United States. The&nbsp;importance of the industry is shown in the exports of 1905, in&nbsp;kilogrammes, viz.: jerked beef, 37.555»95! Ϊ dry hides, 4,735&gt;9<sup>8</sup>7Î&nbsp;salted hides, 12,141,779; beef extract, 16,712; ox-tongues, 498,577;&nbsp;tallow, 6,174,189; and large quantities of leather, horns, hoofs,&nbsp;bonc-ash and preserved meats. Horses, mules, sheep, goats and&nbsp;swine are also raised; the raising of sheep being fostered by the&nbsp;building of woollen factories, and that of swine by the higher duties&nbsp;on imported pork and lard. In some parts of the state agriculture&nbsp;claims much attention, especially in the forested districts of the&nbsp;north where colonies of foreign immigrants have been established.&nbsp;The principal products are wheat, Indian corn, rice, beans, pease,&nbsp;onions, garlic,</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">farinha demandioca</span><span class="font1"> (cassava flour), potatoes, tomatoes,&nbsp;cabbage, fruit, tobacco and peanuts—all of which find a ready&nbsp;market on the coast. Grapes are grown in several localities (Sâo&nbsp;Leopoldo, AJegrete, Bagé, &amp;c.) for wine-making, and the industry&nbsp;has become important—the export in 1905 being 2,092,417 litres.&nbsp;The forest products include </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">herva matte</span><span class="font1"> .or Paraguay tea </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Ilex&nbsp;paraguayensis),</span><span class="font1"> timbers and lumber, and vegetable fibre </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(crina&nbsp;vegetal).</span><span class="font1"> Coal of an inferior quality is mined at Sao Jeronymo, on&nbsp;a small tributary (Arroio dos Ratos) of the Jacuhy river, and has&nbsp;been discovered in other localities. Lime is burned at Caçapava,&nbsp;and at some other places. Gold, copper and iron are said to exist,&nbsp;but arc not mined. Considerable progress has been made in manufacturing industries, among whose products are: woollen, cotton&nbsp;and jute textiles, leather, wheat, flour, boots, shoes and sandals&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(tamnacos),</span><span class="font1"> wines and liquors, beer, macaroni, biscuits and other&nbsp;prepared foods, cigars and cigarettes, hats, matches, soap, candles&nbsp;and wrapping paper. Much of this diversity in production is due&nbsp;to the foreign element in the population.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The railway lines in the state are: the Porto Alegre to Novo Hamburgo (27 m.), with an extension to Taquary (28 m.); Porto&nbsp;Alegre to Uruguayana, completed from MargemdoTaquaryiBank&nbsp;of the Taquary) to Cacequy (232 m.); Santa Maria to Passo Fundo&nbsp;(221 m.); Rio Grande to Bagé (175 m.), with 14 m. in branches at&nbsp;Rio Grande; an extension from Cacequy to Bagé (129 m.); and&nbsp;the Quarahim to Itaquy (109 m.). Allthese except the last have&nbsp;been, taken over by the national government and leased to the&nbsp;Belgian “ Compagnie auxiliare de Chemin de Fer au Brésil,” which&nbsp;has undertaken to complete the line from Cacequy to Uruguayana&nbsp;(161 m.), from Margcm do Taquary to Neustadt, on the </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Novo&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">Hamburgo line (60 m.), and some other branches. The Quarahim&nbsp;to Itaquy line belongs to an English company and runs from the&nbsp;Uruguayan frontier, where it connects with the North-Western of&nbsp;Uruguay, northward to Uruguayana and the naval station of Itaquy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The population in 1900 was 1,149,070. There is a large foreign element; in 1905 the total number of foreigners residing&nbsp;in the state was estimated at 400,000 (not including children&nbsp;born in the country), and of Germans at 250,000. The first&nbsp;German colony was founded in 1824 and settled in 1825 in the&nbsp;rich forested country N. of Porto Alegre, and many large and&nbsp;prosperous communities have been established since then in&nbsp;spite of the wars and political agitations in the state. Several&nbsp;of these colonies, such as Sao Leopoldo, Novo Hamburgo&nbsp;and Conde d’Eu (now Garibaldi), have become important towns&nbsp;and are no longer under colonial administration. Italian&nbsp;colonies were subsequently established, also with good results,&nbsp;but an Irish colony founded at Monte Bonito, near Pelotas,&nbsp;about 1851, failed completely. The capital of Rio Grande do&nbsp;Sul is Porto Alegre at the northern extremity of Lagôa dos&nbsp;Patos, and its two next most important cities are Rio Grande&nbsp;and Pelotas, both at the southern extremity of the same lake.&nbsp;Among other important cities and towns, with population&nbsp;returns for 1900, are Alegrete (11,438), prettily situated in the&nbsp;W. part of the state on the Porto Alegre to Uruguayana railway;&nbsp;Bage (13,463), about 173 m. by rail N.W. of Rio Grande in&nbsp;a picturesque mountainous region, 702 ft. above sea-level;&nbsp;Jaguarao (9000), on a river of the same name and opposite the&nbsp;Uruguayan town of Artigas, with steamboat communication&nbsp;with Rio Grande; Caçapava (8781 in 1890) in a fine grazing&nbsp;district in the central part of the state, 1732 ft. above sea-level;&nbsp;Quarahim, or Quarahy (about 6500), a town of much commercial</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
