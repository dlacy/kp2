<p><span class="font0">frequent in proportion to the diminution which takes place in the quantity of blood transmitted to the lungs, compared&nbsp;with that which passes directly from the heart ; and as it&nbsp;is respiration which warms the blood, and produces in the&nbsp;fibres their susceptibility of nervous irritation, it follows, as&nbsp;observed by Cuvier, that the blood of reptiles is cold, and&nbsp;their muscular strength much less than that of birds and&nbsp;quadrupeds. The scat of their sensations is also much less&nbsp;centralised than in the last-named classes, and hence many&nbsp;of them exhibit life and motion long after their heads have&nbsp;been severed from their bodies. @@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A truly amphibious animal, according to the proper meaning of the term (which is derived from </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">àfafn, on both sides, </span><span class="font0">and ∕3&lt;c{, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">life),</span><span class="font0"> ought to possess the power of breathing under water like a fish, and of respiring atmospheric air like&nbsp;a land animal. According to this interpretation, neither&nbsp;seals, nor beavers, nor even whales, are truly amphibious,&nbsp;for they cannot sustain their existence under water except&nbsp;by the use of a certain portion of air which they have previously inspired at the surface. In like manner, neither&nbsp;the frog nor the tadpole is amphibious (unless it may be&nbsp;for a short intermediate period, or state of transition) ; for&nbsp;the former seeks the water merely as a place of temporary&nbsp;resort, in which it cannot breathe, and the latter is entirely aquatic, being unprovided with lungs, and consequently&nbsp;unable to respire, except through the medium of water.&nbsp;A frog, therefore, can only be said to be amphibious in as&nbsp;far as it possesses, at two different periods of its life, the&nbsp;faculty of living first in the water and then on the land.&nbsp;Born with gills, and destitute of external members, its&nbsp;form and functions are originally rather those of a fish than&nbsp;of a reptile ; but as it advances in growth, the four limbs&nbsp;become developed, the tail decreases and disappears, the&nbsp;jaws are formed, and the gills absorbed, and their functions&nbsp;supplied by lungs. But the peculiar structure of the heart,&nbsp;already mentioned, enables these and other species to remain submerged for a great length of time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Among the many wonderful anomalies, however, with which the kingdom of nature presents us, there exist two&nbsp;truly amphibious animals, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">proteus</span><span class="font0"> and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">siren,</span><span class="font0"> both&nbsp;of which are provided at one and the same time with the&nbsp;gills of a fish and the lungs of a terrestrial creature. But&nbsp;their propensities are decidedly aquatic. The former inhabits certain subterranean waters in Carniola, the latter rejoices in the muddy marshes of South Carolina.@@<sup>2</sup> Both will&nbsp;be hereafter noticed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The amount of respiration is by no means so fixed or determinate among reptiles as it may be said to be in quadrupeds and birds, but varies with the proportion which the diameter of the pulmonary artery bears to that of the aorta.&nbsp;Thus, turtles and lizards respire much more than frogs and&nbsp;others of the class ; and from this results a much greater&nbsp;difference in energy and sensibility between different tribes&nbsp;of Reptilia, than exists among the members of the class of&nbsp;quadrupeds or birds. Reptiles also may be said to exhibit&nbsp;a much greater variety of form, aspect, and condition, than&nbsp;either of the classes just named ; and it is in their production that nature (as we are wont to term the powers of the&nbsp;Omnipotent Creator), has invented the most extraordinary&nbsp;forms and modifications which exist among the vertebrated&nbsp;division of the animal kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">No reptile is known to hatch its eggs, and in the Batra-chian order (frogs, toads, &amp;c.) fecundation does not take place till after the female has excluded the so-called ova,&nbsp;which in such cases are covered merely by a slight and&nbsp;simple membrane, bearing no resemblance to a shell. The&nbsp;young of this Batrachian order, on leaving the egg, bear&nbsp;the general form of fishes, and are, moreover, furnished with&nbsp;gills, which a few of them retain even after acquiring lungs,&nbsp;and assuming the other attributes of maturity. Among several of the egg-laying species, the included young are not&nbsp;only formed, but far advanced at the period of laying ; while&nbsp;a few, such as vipers and certain lizards, are actually born&nbsp;alive, being hatched within the body of the mother. Hence&nbsp;the expression by which these are designated, of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ovo-viυi-parous.</span><span class="font0"> Some even of those which usually lay eggs may&nbsp;be rendered viviparous by a short retardation of the process of laying, as effected by M. Geoffroy in the case of&nbsp;certain snakes by merely depriving them of water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Although many reptiles are active leapers, and even run with rapidity for a short distance, the coldness of their&nbsp;blood, and proportional want of muscular power, induce on&nbsp;the whole an indolent habit. They are probably, of all vertebrated animals, the least perfectly endowed with the power&nbsp;of migratory movement. The brain is proportionally very&nbsp;small, a sea-tortoise, for example, weighing twenty-nine&nbsp;pounds, having been found to possess brains to the weight&nbsp;only of two drams, that is, equal to not more than an eighteen&nbsp;hundred and fifty-sixth part of the entire animal. Now,&nbsp;we know, that in several small birds and quadrupeds, the&nbsp;brain exceeds a thirtieth part of the remainder of the body.&nbsp;In reptiles, indeed, the brain seems less necessary than&nbsp;among other vertebrated beings, to the exercise of the animal and vital functions, and their sensations are less referable to a common centre. Connection with the nervous&nbsp;system is also much less necessary to the contraction of their&nbsp;fibres, and a portion of their flesh possesses its irritability&nbsp;long after separation from the rest of the body. The heart&nbsp;beats for several hours after being extracted, and the said&nbsp;extraction docs not prevent the body itself from moving&nbsp;about for a considerable time. The cerebellum in several&nbsp;species is extremely small, a fact regarded as being in exact accordance with their indolence of movement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The small size of the pulmonary vessels admits of reptiles suspending their respiration without arresting the course of the blood, and they can accordingly dive more&nbsp;easily, and continue submerged for a longer time, than either&nbsp;mammiferous quadrupeds or birds. The cellules of the&nbsp;lungs being less numerous, as having fewer vessels to lodge&nbsp;upon their parietes, are much wider, and these organs have&nbsp;sometimes indeed the form of simple sacs scarcely cellular.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">They are all provided with a trachea and larynx, although many are entirely mute. Their blood being naturally cold, they have no need of such integuments as fur or feathers to retain the heat, and are covered either by scales&nbsp;or a naked skin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Although no portion of the organ of hearing is external in reptiles, yet among crocodiles there is an appearance of&nbsp;an outer </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">meatus auditorius,</span><span class="font0"> owing to the skin forming a&nbsp;thick cover over the tympanum. This peculiar formation&nbsp;is sufficient to explain a passage in Herodotus, who states,&nbsp;that the Egyptians were in the habit of suspending jewels&nbsp;from the ears of the crocodile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The digestion in reptiles is extremely slow, and all their sensations are obtuse. In cold, and even in temperate climates, they fall into a state of torpor during the prevalence</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">@@@ <sup>1</sup> “ Les muscles des reptiles conservent plus long temps encore leur irritabilité que ceux des poissons. Nous avons vu des era. pauds, des salamandres, des tortues, des serpens, privés de la tête et dépouillés de leur peau depuis plusieurs jours, et maintenus&nbsp;humides, produire encore des mouvemens pendant des semaines entières ; un tortue terrestre, du poids des près de 40 kilogrammes,&nbsp;morte depuis plusieurs jours, dont le cou était tombé dans cette sorte de flaccidité, suite de la raideur qui survient après la mort, dont&nbsp;les yeux en particulier avaient la cornée dessechée, manifester des mouvemens par la Contractions et la retraction des membres, toutes&nbsp;les fuis qu'on stimulait, en les piquant, les muscles des membres postérieurs.” (Dumeril et Bibron, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Erfatologie,</span><span class="font1"> i. 41.)</span></p>
