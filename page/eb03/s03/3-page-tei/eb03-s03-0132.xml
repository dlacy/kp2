The cockles, muſcles, oyſters, and the other common bivalves of our own ſeas, are very abundant : but we have also an amazing number of the nautilus kind, particularly of the nautilus græcorum, which though a ſhell not found living in our own or any neighbouring ſeas, yet is found buried in all our clay-pits about London and elſewhcre ; and the moſt frequent of all foſſil ſhells in ſome of our counties are the conchæ anomiæ, which yet we know not of in any part of the world in their recent ſtate.

But in ſmall elevations this does not always happen, nor indeed is it neceſſary ; for, let the ſhell fall as it will, the fuſe ſets fire to the powder within, which burſts the ſhell, and cauſes great devaſtation.

He learned to read of an old dame, whom his poem of the “ School miſtreſs” has delivered to posterity ; and ſoon received ſuch delight from books, that he was always calling for new entertainment, and expected that, when any of the family went to market, a new book ſhould be brought him, which, when it came, was in fondneſs carried to bed, and laid by him. It is laid, that when his requeſt had been neglected, his mother wrapped up a piece of wood of the  same form, and pacified him for the night. As he grew older, he went for a while to the grammar-ſchool in Hales-Owen, and was placed afterwards with Mr- Crumpton, an eminent ſchool matter at Solihul, where he diſtinguiſhed himſelf by the quickneſs of his progreſs. When he was young (June 1774), he was deprived of his father ; and ſoon after (August 1726) of his grandfather ; and was, with his brother, who died afterwards unmarried, left to the care of his grandmother, who managed the eſtate. From ſchool he was ſent, in 1732, to Pembroke college in Oxford, a ſociety which for half a century has been eminent for Engliſh poetry and elegant literature. Here it appears that he found delight and advantage ; for he continued his name there ten years, though he took no degree. After the firſt four years he put on the civilian’s gown, but without Awing any intention to engage in the profeſſion. About the time when he went to Oxford, the death of his grandmother devolved his affairs to the care of the reverend Mr Dolman, of Brome, in Staffordſhire, whoſe attention he always mentioned with gratitude. — At Oxford he applied to Engliſh poetry ; and, in 1737, publiſhed a ſmall Miſcellany, without his name. He then for a time wandered about, to acquaint himſelf with life, and was ſometimes at London, ſometimes at Bath, or any place of public reſort ; but he did not forget his poetry. He publiſhed, in 1740, his “ Judgment of Hercules,” addreſſed to Mr Lyttleton, whoſe intereſt he ſupported with great warmth at an election ; this was two years afterwards followed by the “ School-miſtreſs.” Mr Dolman, to whoſe care he was indebted for his eaſe and leiſure, died in 1745, and the care of his fortune now fell upon himſelf. He tried to eſcape it a while, and lived at his houſe with his tenants, who were diſtantly related ; but, finding that imperfect posseſſion inconvenient, he took the whole eſtate into his own hands, an event which rather improved its beauty than increaſed its produce. Now began his delight in rural pleaſures, and his paſſion of rural elegance ; but in time his expences</p></body></text></TEI>
