<p><span class="font2">RUDOLPH I. (1218-1291), German king, eldest son of Albert IV., count of Hapsburg, was born on the 1st May&nbsp;1218. By marriage and in other ways he greatly extended his hereditary dominions, so that when he became&nbsp;king he was lord not only of Hapsburg but of the counties&nbsp;of Kyburg and Lenzburg and of the Iandgraviate of Alsace.&nbsp;At different times he carried on war with the bishop of&nbsp;Strasburg, the abbot of St Gall, and the city of Basel.&nbsp;He was engaged in his second struggle with Basel in 1273&nbsp;when Frederick, burgrave of Nuremberg, brought the intelligence that he had been elected to the German crown.&nbsp;Basel at once submitted, and Rudolph went to Aix-Ia-Chapelle, where he was crowned on the 28th October 1273.&nbsp;The princes had become so independent during the Great&nbsp;Interregnum that they would have preferred to have no&nbsp;supreme ruler ; but Pope Gregory X. had threatened that&nbsp;if they did not elect a king he would himself appoint one.&nbsp;The pope now cordially supported Rudolph, who proved&nbsp;to be much more energetic than the electors had anticipated. Having secured the friendship of the palsgrave&nbsp;Louis and Duke Albert of Saxony by allowing them to&nbsp;marry his daughters, he advanced against Ottocar, king&nbsp;of Bohemia, and Henry, duke of Bavaria, both of whom&nbsp;had refused to do him homage. Henry was soon won&nbsp;over to the new king’s side, and then Ottccar had to sue&nbsp;for peace. His request was granted only on condition&nbsp;that he should cede Austria, Styria, Carinthia, and&nbsp;Carniola. By and by Ottocar again rebelled, and was&nbsp;slain in 1278 in a battle fought on the Marchfield.&nbsp;Rudolph gave Bohemia and Moravia to Wenceslaus,&nbsp;OttocaFs son ; but Austria, Styria, and Carniola he&nbsp;granted to his own sons, Albert and Rudolph. Carinthia&nbsp;was given to Meinhard, count of Tyrol, who agreed that&nbsp;if his descendants in the male line died out the land should&nbsp;pass to Rudolph’s family. Rudolph compelled Otho,&nbsp;count of Upper Burgundy, and other nobles, who tried&nbsp;to make themselves independent of the German crown, to&nbsp;acknowledge his supremacy ; and he recovered certain fiefs&nbsp;in what is now Switzerland, which had been seized by the&nbsp;count of Savoy. He also restored peace in Bohemia, and&nbsp;gave his daughter in marriage to the young king, Wences-laus. He often visited troubled parts of the kingdom,&nbsp;settling local disputes, and destroying the towers of robber&nbsp;barons. On the whole, his rule was a beneficent one,&nbsp;but he did not succeed in re-establishing the authority of&nbsp;the Crown, nor did he see how great an element of strength&nbsp;he might have found in an alliance with the cities. The&nbsp;electors he was forced to confirm in the possession of&nbsp;important rights, which were maintained under his successors. His reign is memorable chiefly because he was&nbsp;the founder of the greatness of the house of Hapsburg.&nbsp;In 1281 his first wife died, and in 1284 he married&nbsp;Elizabeth, daughter of Hugo IV., duke of Burgundy.&nbsp;He died at Germersheim on the l5th July 1291.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">RUDOLPH II. (1552-1612), Holy Roman emperor, was the son of the emperor Maximilian II., and was born&nbsp;on the 18th July 1552. In 1572 he obtained the crown&nbsp;of Hungary, in 1575 that of Bohemia, with the title “King&nbsp;of the Romans ”; and in 1576, after his father’s death,&nbsp;he became emperor. He was of an indolent and melancholy disposition, and preferred the study of astrology&nbsp;and alchemy to the responsibilities of government. He&nbsp;surrendered himself absolutely to the control of the Jesuits,&nbsp;under whose influence he had been brought up at the&nbsp;gloomy court of Spain ; and in his hereditary lands they&nbsp;laboured assiduously to destroy Protestantism. The&nbsp;Protestants were deprived of the right of public worship&nbsp;in Vienna and other towns ; their schools were closed,&nbsp;and many of their preachers banished. Almost all public&nbsp;offices, too, were placed in the hands of Roman Catholics.&nbsp;In the lands which Rudolph ruled, not by hereditary&nbsp;right, but as emperor, his advisers could exercise less&nbsp;authority ; but there also they did what they could to&nbsp;foster the Catholic reaction. In 1607 Maximilian, duke&nbsp;of Bavaria, was allowed to seize the imperial city Donauwörth, the Protestant inhabitants of which had quarrelled&nbsp;with the abbot. This and other high-handed proceedings&nbsp;alarmed the Protestants of Germany, and in 1608, under&nbsp;the leadership of Frederick IV., elector of the Palatinate,&nbsp;they formed a confederation called the Union for the protection of their interests. The Catholic princes, guided&nbsp;by Duke Maximilian of Bavaria, responded by forming&nbsp;the League. Civil war seemed inevitable, but it was&nbsp;postponed by the murder of Henry IV. of France, who&nbsp;had promised to support the Union, and by the death of&nbsp;the elector Frederick IV. Meanwhile, the greatest confusion prevailed in Hungary, due in part to religious&nbsp;oppression, in part to a war with the Turks. In 1601&nbsp;the Hungarians rebelled, and peace was not restored&nbsp;until 1606, when Matthias, the emperor’s brother, with&nbsp;the sanction of his younger brothers, who acknowledged&nbsp;him as head of the family, came to terms both with the&nbsp;Hungarians and with the sultan. Matthias allied himself with the Protestants, and compelled Rudolph to give&nbsp;up to him Hungary, Moravia, and the greater part of&nbsp;Austria. The emperor then tried to strengthen his&nbsp;position by granting to the nobles, knights, and towns of&nbsp;Bohemia perfect religious freedom, with the right to build&nbsp;Protestant churches and schools on their own and on the&nbsp;royal lands. Even after they had obtained the letter of&nbsp;majesty in which these *concessions were embodied, the&nbsp;Bohemians did not trust Rudolph ; and, when at his&nbsp;request the archduke Leopold appeared in their country&nbsp;with an army, they invited Matthias to come to their aid.&nbsp;Matthias went, and the emperor had no alternative but to&nbsp;resign tö him in 1611 the remainder of his hereditary&nbsp;territories. Rudolph died on the 20th January 1612.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">RUDOLSTADT, capital of the German principality of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt, and chief residence of the prince,&nbsp;is situated on the left bank of the Saale, 18 miles due&nbsp;south of Weimar, in one of the most beautiful districts&nbsp;of Thuringia. The picturesque little town is a favourite&nbsp;summer watering-place, with pine baths, as well as a frequented tourist resort. Besides containing the Government buildings of the little principality, Rudolstadt is&nbsp;fairly well provided with schools and other institutions,&nbsp;including a library of 60,000 volumes. The residence&nbsp;of the prince is in the Heidecksburg, a palace on an&nbsp;eminence 200 feet above the Saale, rebuilt after a fire in&nbsp;1735, and containing various show apartments. The&nbsp;Ludwigsburg, another palace within the town built in&nbsp;1742, accommodates the natural history collections belonging to the prince. The principal church dates from&nbsp;the end of the 15th century. In the Anger, a tree-shaded&nbsp;public park between the town and the river, is the theatre.&nbsp;Various memorials in and near the town commemorate the&nbsp;visits of Schiller to the neighbourhood in 1787 and 1788.&nbsp;The industries of the district include the manufacture of&nbsp;porcelain and of dyestuffs, wool-spinning, and bell-founding. The population (4100 in 1817) was 8747 in 1880.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
