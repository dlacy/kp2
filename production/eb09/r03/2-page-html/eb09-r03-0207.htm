W. and S. lay the&nbsp;vilayets of Salonika and Adrianople, the borderlands forming part of the Rhodope or Despoto mountaiu system.&nbsp;The direct distance between the northmost and southmost&nbsp;point on the Black Sea is only 40 miles, but the actual&nbsp;coast-line is lengthened by the ramifications of the Bay of&nbsp;Burgas, which is the only part of the Black Sea affording&nbsp;several good anchorages. The great bulk of the country&nbsp;belongs to the basin of the Maritza and its tributary the&nbsp;Tunja (confluence at Adrianople, to the south of Roumelia),&nbsp;though a certain part drains north-eastwards by several&nbsp;small streams. The whole area is estimated at 14,858&nbsp;square miles, and the population in 1880 was 815,513, of&nbsp;whom 573,231 were Bulgarians, 176,759 Turks, 42,526&nbsp;Greeks, 19,524 Gipsies, 4177 Jews, and 1306 Armenians.&nbsp;T</span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">his</span><span class="font1"> preponderance of Bulgarians led in September 1885 to&nbsp;the Philippopolis revolution, which resulted in the principality of Bulgaria declaring East Roumelia part and parcel&nbsp;of United Bulgaria; and the United Bulgarians have since&nbsp;been successful in a war with the Servians, who invaded&nbsp;their territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROUND TOWERS. A peculiar class of round tower exists scattered throughout Ireland; about one hundred&nbsp;and twenty examples still remain, mostly in a ruined&nbsp;state, but eighteen or twenty are almost perfect. These&nbsp;towers were built either near or adjoining a church ; they&nbsp;are of various dates from perhaps the 8th to the 13th&nbsp;century ; though varying in size and detail, they have&nbsp;many characteristics which are common to all. They are&nbsp;built with walls slightly battering inwards, so that the&nbsp;tower tapers towards the top. The lower part is formed&nbsp;of solid masonry, the one doorway being raised from 6 to&nbsp;20 feet above the ground, and so only accessible by means&nbsp;of a ladder. The towers within are divided into several&nbsp;stories by two or more floors, usually of wood, but in&nbsp;some cases, as at Keneith, of stone slightly arched. The&nbsp;access from floor to floor λvas by ladders, no stone staircase&nbsp;being provided. The windows, which are always high up,&nbsp;are single lights, mostly arched or with a flat stone lintel.&nbsp;In some of the oldest towers they have triangular tops,&nbsp;formed by two stones leaning together, like the windows&nbsp;at Deerhurst and other pre-Norman buildings in England.&nbsp;One peculiarity of the door and window openings in the&nbsp;Irish round towers is that the jambs are frequently set&nbsp;sloping, so that the opening grows narrower towards the&nbsp;top, as in the temples of ancient Egypt. The later&nbsp;examples of these towers, dating from the 12th and 13th&nbsp;centuries are often decorated with chevron, billet, and other&nbsp;Norman enrichments round the jambs and arches. The&nbsp;roof is of stone, usually conical in shape, and some of the&nbsp;later towers are crowned by a circle of battlements. The&nbsp;height of the round towers varies from about 60 feet to&nbsp;132; that at Kilcullen is the highest. The masonry&nbsp;differs according to its date,—the oldest examples being&nbsp;built of almost uncut rubble work, and the later ones of&nbsp;neatly-jointed ashlar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Much has been written as to the use of these towers, and the most conflicting theories as to their origin have&nbsp;been propounded. It is, however, fairly certain that they&nbsp;were constructed by Christian builders, both from the fact&nbsp;that they always are or once were near to a church, and&nbsp;also because crosses and other Christian emblems frequently&nbsp;occur among the sculptured decorations of their doors and&nbsp;windows. The original purpose of these towers was probably for places of refuge, for which the solid base and the&nbsp;door high above the ground seem specially adapted. They&nbsp;may also have been watch-towers, and in later times often&nbsp;contained bells. Their circular form was probably for the&nbsp;sake of strength, angles which could be attacked by a&nbsp;battering ram being thus avoided, and also because no&nbsp;quoins or dressed stones were needed, except for the openings—an important point at a time when tools for working&nbsp;stone were scarce and imperfect Both these reasons may&nbsp;also account for the Norman round towers which are so&nbsp;common at the west end of churches in Norfolk, »Suffolk,&nbsp;and Essex, though these have little resemblance to those of&nbsp;Ireland except in the use of a circular plan. One example&nbsp;exactly Eke those of Ireland still exists in the Isle of Man,&nbsp;within the precincts of Peel Castle adjacent to the cathedral&nbsp;of St German ; it was probably the work of Irish builders.&nbsp;There are also three in Scotland, viz. at Egilshay in Orkney, and at Abernethy and Brechin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Round towers wider and low<sup>,</sup>er in proportion than those of Ireland appear to have been built by many prehistoric&nbsp;races at different parts of Europe. Many examples exist&nbsp;in Scotland, and in the islands of Corsica and Sardinia.&nbsp;The towers of this class in Scotland are called “ brochs ” ;&nbsp;they average about 50 feet high and 30 feet in internal&nbsp;diameter. Their walls, which are usually about 15 feet&nbsp;thick at the bottom, are built hoUow, of rubble masonry,&nbsp;with series of passages one over the other running all&nbsp;round the tower. As in the Irish towers, the entrance is&nbsp;placed at some distance from the ground ; and the whole&nbsp;structure is designed as a stronghold. The brochs appear&nbsp;to have been the work of a pre-Christian Celtic race.&nbsp;Many objects in bronze and iron and fragments of handmade pottery have been found in and near these towers,&nbsp;all bearing witness of a very early date. See Anderson,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Scotland in Pagan Times,</span><span class="font1"> 1883, and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Scotland in Early&nbsp;Christian Times,</span><span class="font1"> 1881. During the 6th century church&nbsp;towers at and near Ravenna were usually built round in&nbsp;plan, and not unhke those of Ireland in their proportions.&nbsp;The finest existing example is that which stands by the&nbsp;church of S. Apollinare in Classe, the old port of the city&nbsp;of Ravenna (see </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Basilica,</span><span class="font1"> vol. iii. p. 415, fig. 5). It is of&nbsp;brick, divided into nine stories, with single-light windows&nbsp;below, three-light windows in the upper stories, and two-lights in the intermediate ones. The most magnificent&nbsp;example of a round tower is the well-known leaning tower&nbsp;of Pisa, begun in the year 1174. It is richly decorated&nbsp;with tiers of open marble arcades, supported on free&nbsp;columns. The circular plan was much used by Moslem&nbsp;races for their minarets. The finest of these is the 13th-century minar of Kootub at Old Delhi, built of Emestone&nbsp;with bands of marble. It is richly fluted on plan, and&nbsp;when complete was at least 250 feet high.</span></p>
