            <p>tain mark. The neck above this mark had a ſcale of equal parts pasted on it. It was
                filled to the mark with water. Twenty-four penny weights of ſalt were thrown into it
                as ſpeedily as poſſible, and the bulk of the ſalt was meaſured by the elevation of
                the water. Every thing was attended to which could retard the immediate ſolution,
                that the error ariſing from the ſolution of the firſt particles, before the reſt
                could be put in, might be as ſmall as poſſible ; and in order that both the abſolute
                bulk and its variations might be obtained by ſome known ſcale, 24 pennyweights of
                water were put in. This raiſed the ſurface 58 parts of the ſcale. Now we know
                exactly the bulk of 24 pennyweights of pure water. lt is 2,275 cubic inches ; and
                thus we obtain every thing in abſolute meaſures : And by comparing the bulk of each
                ſalt, both at its firſt immerſion and after its complete ſolution, we obtain its
                ſpecific gravity, and the change made on it in paſſing from a ſolid to a fluid form.
                The following table is an abſtract of theſe experiments. The firſt column of numbers
                is the elevation of the ſurface immediately after immerſion ; the ſecond gives the
                elevation when the ſalt is completely diſſolved ; and the third and fourth columns
                are the ſpecific gravities of the ſalts in theſe two ſtates.</p>

            <p>The inspection of this liſt naturally ſuggeſts two ſtates of the caſe as particularly
                intereſting to the philoſopher studying the theory of ſolution. The firſt ſtate is
                when the lixivium approaches to ſaturation. In the very point of saturation any
                addition of ſalt retains its bulk unchanged. In diluted brines, we ſhall ſee that
                the denſity of the fluid ſalt is greater, and gradually diminiſhes as we add more
                ſalt. It is an important queſtion, Whether this diminution goes on continually, till
                the fluid denſity of the ſalt is the ſame with its ſolid denſity ? or, Whether there
                is an abrupt paſſage from ſome</p>
            <p>degree of the one to the fixed degree of the other, as we obſerve in the freezing of
                iron, the ſetting of ſtucco, and ſome other inſtances ?</p>
            <p>The other intereſting ſtate is that of extreme dilution, when the differences between
                the ſucceſſive densities bear a great proportion to the denſities themſelves, and
                thus enable the mathematician to aſcertain with ſome preciſion the variations of
                corpuſcular force, in conſequence of a variation of diſtance between the particles.
                The ſketch of an inveſtigation of this important queſtion given by Boſcovich, in his
                Theory of Natural Philoſophy, is very promiſing, and ſhould incite the philoſophical
                chemiſt to the ſtudy. The firſt thing to be done is to compare the law of ſpecific
                gravity ; that is, the relation between the ſpecific gravity and quantity of ſalt
                held in ſolution.</p>
            <p>Wiſhing to make this work as uſeful as poſſible, we have ſearched for experiments,
                and trains of experiments, on the denſity of the many brines which make important
                articles of commerce ; but we were mortified by the ſcantineſs of the information,
                and diſappointed in our hopes of being able to combine the detached obſervations,
                ſuited to the immediate views of their authors, in ſuch a manner as to deduce from
                them ſcales (as they may be called) of their ſtrength. We rarely found theſe
                detached obſervations attended with circumſtances which would connect them with
                others ; and there was frequently ſuch a diſcrepancy, nay oppoſition, in ſerieſes of
                experiments made for aſcertaining the relation between the denſity and the ſtrength,
                that we could not obtain general principles which enable us to conſtruct tables of
                ſtrength <hi rend="italic">à priori.</hi></p>
            <p>Mr Lambert, one of the firſt mathematicians and philoſophers of Europe, in a
                diſſertation in the Berlin Memoirs (1762), gives a narration of experiments on the
                brines of common ſalt, from which he deduces a very great condensation, which he
                attributes to an abſorption in the weak brines of the salt, or a lodgement of its
                particles in the interſtſees of the particles oſ water. Mr Achard of the ſame
                academy, in 1785, gives a very great liſt of experiments on the bulks of various
                brines, made in a different way, which ſhow no ſuch introſusception ; and Dr Watson,
                formerly regius profeſſor of chemiſtry at Cambridge, and now biſhop of Landaff,
                thinks this confirmed by experiments which he narrates in his Chemical Eſſays. We
                ſee great reaſon for heſitating our aſſent to either side, and do not think the
                experiments deciſive. We incline to Mr Lambert’s opinion ; for this reaſon, that in
                the ſucceſſive dilutions of oil of vitriol and aquafortis there is a moſt evident
                and remarkable condenſation. Now what are these but brines, of which we have not
                been able to get the ſaline ingredient in a ſeparate form ? The experiments of Mr
                Achard and Dr Watſon were made in ſuch a way that a ſingle grain in the meaſurement
                bore too great a proportion to the whole change of specific gravity. At the ſame
                time, ſome of Dr Watſon’s are ſo ſimple in their nature that it is very difficult to
                with hold the aſſent.</p>
            <p>In this ſtate of uncertainty, in a ſubject which ſeems to us to be of public
                importance, we thought it our duty to undertake a train of experiments to which
                recourſe may always be had. Works like this are ſeldom conſidered as ſources of
                original information ; and it is thought sufficient when the know</p>
