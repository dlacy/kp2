<p><span class="font0">teeth are enlarged and furnished with a deep groove for the reception of poison. In the Solcnoglypha or'Viperidae the&nbsp;enlarged teeth of the Opisthoglypha&nbsp;have moved to the front, owing to reduction of the anterior portion of the&nbsp;maxilla. The latter, much shortened,&nbsp;moves with the firmly anchylosed poison&nbsp;fang upon the prefrontal as its pivot,&nbsp;being pushed forward, or “ erected,” by&nbsp;the ectopterygoid bone, which connects it with the pterygoid, and this&nbsp;in turn can be moved forwards and&nbsp;backwards, together with the quadrate. (See fig. 24, skull of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Vipera&nbsp;Hasicornis</span><span class="font0"> and the diagram of the&nbsp;mechanism in article Snakes.) In&nbsp;the still unfinished fang the furrow&nbsp;is open, later the edges close together&nbsp;and the end of the duct of the gland&nbsp;itself is surrounded by the substance&nbsp;of the growing basal portion of the tooth,&nbsp;so that the furrow is converted into&nbsp;a canal continuous with that of the gland. The poison is&nbsp;now sure to be projected into the very deepest part of the&nbsp;wound with the precision of a surgical instrument. The Pro-teroglypha, with their long, non-erectile maxillae, bite, or, like</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Elaps,</span><span class="font0"> deliberately chew their victim; the Viperidae rather strike with the mouth widely open. The teeth of snakes and&nbsp;lizards are often of irregular size; but it is rare that a kind of&nbsp;differentiation into incisors, canines and molars occurs. In&nbsp;many lizards, especially in Iguanidae, some teeth are multicuspid, trilobed, or somewhat serrated; in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Tiliqua,</span><span class="font0"> universally&nbsp;known as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Cyclodus,</span><span class="font0"> most of the hinder teeth are roundish&nbsp;crushers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Lizards and snakes are born with an “ egg-tooth ” which is lost a day or two after hatching. Its function is the filing&nbsp;through of the eggshell. This tooth, always unpaired, is in&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Tropidonotus natrix</span><span class="font0"> one millimetre long and half a millimetre&nbsp;broad at its base, which rests upon a middle depression of the&nbsp;premaxillary bone; it stands forward above the mouth and&nbsp;is curved upwards. In crocodiles and tortoises the same effect&nbsp;is produced by another organ, which, as in birds, lies well outside the mouth on the top of the end of the snout and consists&nbsp;of a little cone of calcified epidermis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Tongue.</span><span class="font0">—The tongue of the crocodiles is very broad and flat, and with nearly its w hole broad base attached to the floor of the&nbsp;mouth; however, in its whole circumference its edge is well&nbsp;marked, and it arises on its hinder border as a transverse fold&nbsp;which meets a similar fold descending from the palate in front&nbsp;of the posterior nares. By these folds the mouth can be completely shut off from the nasal passages into the trachea. The&nbsp;upper surface of the tongue contains several dozen large flat&nbsp;papillae, each with a central pit-like opening; it is not known&nbsp;whether they are gustatory organs. Besides scarce mucous&nbsp;glands on the tongue, there is an absence of salivary glands&nbsp;in the mouth. The tongue of tortoises is likewise short, broad,&nbsp;and not protractile, and there appears to be only a sublingual&nbsp;gland; the surface of the tongue is‘covered with velvety papillae&nbsp;in the terrestrial, with larger folds in the marine Chelonians.&nbsp;In the Lacertilia the tongue presents a number of variations&nbsp;which have been referred to as diagnostic characters of the&nbsp;various families of Lizards </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.).</span><span class="font0"> The chief modifications&nbsp;are the following: Either flat and broad, not protractile, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">Agamidae; or the body of the tongue is somewhat cylindrical,&nbsp;elongated, and the whole organ can be protruded; lastly, the&nbsp;anterior half of the tongue, which can be protruded, is retractile&nbsp;or telescoped into the posterior portion, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font0"> Anguidae. Jn&nbsp;nearly all cases the posterior dorsal end of the body of the&nbsp;tongue is well marked off by a margin raised above the root,&nbsp;a character which does not occur in any snake. The upper&nbsp;surface is either smooth or curved with velvety, flat, or scaly,&nbsp;always soft, papillae. In the majority the tip of the tongue&nbsp;is bifid, either slightly niched or deeply bifid. The tips contain tactile corpuscles, although sometimes covered with a&nbsp;horny epithelium. The most specialized is the tongue of&nbsp;the chameleon. -Thc body of this tongue is very thick, club-shaped, fleshy and full of large mucous glands which cover it&nbsp;with a sticky secretion. The base or root is very narrow,&nbsp;composed of extremely elastic fibres and supported by a much&nbsp;elongated copular piece of the ' hyoid. This elastic part is,&nbsp;so to speak, telescoped over the style-shaped copula, and the&nbsp;whole apparatus is kept in a contracted state like a spring in&nbsp;a tube. A pair of wide blood vessels and elastic bands extend&nbsp;from the base into the thick end, which in an ordinary chameleon can be shot out to a distance of about 8 in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The tongue of the snakes is invariably slender, smooth and almost entirely retractile into its posterior sheath-like portion.&nbsp;It is always bifid and contains many tactile and other&nbsp;sensory corpuscles by which these creatures seem to investigate. The tongue is always protruded during excitement.&nbsp;How this is done is not very obvious, since the hyoid apparatus&nbsp;itself is much reduced. There is a niche in the middle of the&nbsp;rostral shield to permit protrusion of the tongue whilst the mouth&nbsp;is shut, and probably herewith is correlated the almost universal absence of teeth in the premaxilla. The tongue and&nbsp;the larynx are placed very far forwards in the mouth and,&nbsp;during the a,ct of swallowing, the larynx approaches the chin,&nbsp;or it may even protrude out of the mouth to secure breathing&nbsp;during the often painfully protracted act.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Glands,</span><span class="font0"> sublingual glands are of general occurrence in reptiles; they open near the root or in the sheath of the tongue.&nbsp;Labial glands seem to be absent in crocodiles and tortoises,&nbsp;but upper and low'er labial glands exist in lizards and snakes,&nbsp;generally in considerable numbers. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Heloderma</span><span class="font0"> is the only&nbsp;lizard in which some of these glands—those along the lower&nbsp;jaw—produce a poisonous secretion, each small gland conducting&nbsp;its secretion towards the base of one of the somewhat furrowed&nbsp;teeth. In the snakes, upper and lower labial glands are well&nbsp;developed for salivation. It is the upper series which attracts&nbsp;our interest by its eventual modification into the deadly poison&nbsp;glands. Probably the saliva of most snakes, like their serum,&nbsp;possesses toxic properties. In most of the harmless Colubrine&nbsp;snakes the glands extend in a continuous series from behind&nbsp;the premaxilla along the whole of the upper jaw, with numerous openings. In the Opisthogl^pha a gradual differentiation&nbsp;takes place into an anterior, middle and posterior portion;&nbsp;the middle, extending from below and behind the eye backwards, is the thickest and yellowish in colour; behind it follows&nbsp;a small portion, reddish grey like the anterior portion, with&nbsp;which it is more or less continuous below the middle complex.&nbsp;Thus, still rather indifferent, is </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dryophis.</span><span class="font0"> In </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dipsas, e.g.&nbsp;D. fusca,</span><span class="font0"> the middle portion has become predominant; some&nbsp;of its enlarged ducts lead to the pair of posterior, enlarged and&nbsp;well-grooved, maxillary teeth. It is this middIe portion which&nbsp;becomes the characteristic poison gland with one long duct.&nbsp;The gland itself retains its position; all the other upper labials,&nbsp;except the anterior series, abort. In the Viperidae the poison&nbsp;duct opens near the base of the perforated fangs, which, owing&nbsp;to the shortening of the anterior portion of the maxilla with&nbsp;its teeth, have come to be the only teeth in the upper jaw. In&nbsp;the Elapine, still more in the Hydrophine snakes, the position&nbsp;of the gland and its duct is the same, but the duct has been&nbsp;carried past the smaller harmless teeth which stand in the&nbsp;maxilla and open at the base of the anterior maxillary teeth.&nbsp;The effect is the same, although the poison fangs are not&nbsp;homologous, in the one case the most posterior, in the other&nbsp;the most anterior, of the maxillary series. In </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Doliophis,</span><span class="font0"> one of&nbsp;the Malay genera of Elapine snakes, each poison gland sends&nbsp;an enormously elongated recess far into the body-cavity. (For&nbsp;some other details see Snakes; Viper; and Rattlesnake.&nbsp;The best account of the buccal glands and teeth of poisonous&nbsp;snakes is that by G. S. West, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">P.Z.S.,</span><span class="font0"> 1895, pp. 812-826.)</span></p>
