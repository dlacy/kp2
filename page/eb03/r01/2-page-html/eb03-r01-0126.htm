<p><span class="font1">circle, whoſe plane is perpendicular to th¢ ftτeam. If BC (fig. </span><span class="font0">I.) </span><span class="font1">be a plane ſurface expofed to the action&nbsp;of a ſtream of ſtuid, moving in thc direction DC, then&nbsp;BR, or SE, perpendicular to DC, is its baſe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Direct impulſe</span><span class="font1"> ſhall expreſs the energy or action of the particle or filament, or ſtream of fluid, when meeting&nbsp;the ſurface perpendicularly, or when tlie furface is perpendicular to the direction of the ſtream.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Abſolute impu/ſe</span><span class="font1"> means the actual preffure on the impelled ſurface, arifing from the action of the fluid, whether ſtriking the ſurface perpendicularly or obliquely ; or it is the force impreffed on the ſurface, or tendency&nbsp;to motion which it acquires, and which muſt be oppoled&nbsp;by an equal force in the oppoſite direction, in order that&nbsp;the ſurface may be maintained in its place. It is of importance to keep in mind, that this preffure is always&nbsp;perpendicular to the ſurfacc. It is a propoſttion found-ed on univerſal and uncontradicted experience, that the&nbsp;mutual actions of bodies on each other are always exerted in a direction perpendicular to the touching fur-faces. Thus, it is obferved, that when a billiard ball&nbsp;A is ſtruck by another B, moving in any direction what-ever, the ball A always moves off in the direction perpendicular to the plane which touches the two balls in the&nbsp;point of mutual contact, or point of impulſe. This&nbsp;inductive propoſition is fupported by every argument&nbsp;which can be drawn from what we know concerning the&nbsp;forces which connect the particles of matter together,&nbsp;and are the immediate cauſes of the communication of&nbsp;motion. It would employ much time and room to&nbsp;ſtate them here ; and we apprehend that it is unneceffary : for no reaſon can be aſſigned why the preffure&nbsp;ſhould be in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">any particular</span><span class="font1"> oblique direction. If any&nbsp;one ſhould ſay that the impulſe will be in the direction&nbsp;of the ſtream, we have only to deſire him to take notice of the effect of the rudder of a ſhip. This ſhows&nbsp;that the impulſe </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">is not in the direction of the fir earn,</span><span class="font1"> and&nbsp;is therefore in ſome direction tranſverſe to the ftream.—&nbsp;He will alſo find, that when a plane ſurface is impelled&nbsp;obliquely by a fluid, there is no direction in which it&nbsp;can be ſupported but the direction perpendicular to it-ſelf. It is quite ſafe, in the mean time, to take it as&nbsp;an experimental truth, we may, perhaps, in ſome&nbsp;other part of this work, give what will be received as&nbsp;a rigorous demonſtration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Relative or effective impulſe</span><span class="font1"> means the preffure on the ſurface eſtimated in ſome particular direction. Thus&nbsp;BC (fig. i.) may repreſent the ſail of a ſhip, impelled&nbsp;by the wind blowing in the direction DC. G Ο may&nbsp;be the direction of the ſhip’s keel, or the line of her&nbsp;courſe. The wind ſtrikes the ſail in the direction GH&nbsp;parallel to DC ; the ſail is urged or preffed in the di-rection GI, perpendicular to BC. But we are intereſted to know what tendency this will give the ſhip to&nbsp;move in the direction GO. This is the effective or relative impulſe. Ογ BC may be the tranſverfe ſection of&nbsp;the ſail of a common wind-mill. This, by the conſtruction of the machine, can move only in the direction&nbsp;GP, perpendicular to the direction of the wind ; and it&nbsp;is only in this direction that the impulſe produces the&nbsp;deſired effect. Ογ BC may be half of the prow of a&nbsp;punt or lighter, riding at anchor by means of the cable&nbsp;' DC, attached to the prow C. In this caſe, GfiL. pa-rallel to DC, is that part of the abſolute impulfe which&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">is</span><span class="font0"> employed in ſtraining the cable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">angle of incidence</span><span class="font0"> is the angle </span><span class="font1">F G C contained between the direction of the ſtream FG and the&nbsp;plane BC.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">angle oſ obliquity</span><span class="font1"> is the angle OGC contained between the plane and the direction GO, in which we&nbsp;wiſh to eſtimate the impulſe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Prop. II. The direct impulfe of a fluid on a plane ſurface, is to its abſolute oblique impulſe on the ſame furface, as the ſquare of the radius to the ſquare of the fine of the angle of incidence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Let a ſtream of fluid, moving in the direction DC,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(fig. ι.), act on the plane BC. with the radius CB deſcribe the quadrant ABE ; draw CA perpendicular&nbsp;to CE, and draw MN BS parallel to CE. Let t,he particle E, moving in the direction FG, meet the plane in&nbsp;G, and in F G produced take GH to reprefent the&nbsp;magnitude of the direct impulſe, or the impulſe which&nbsp;the particle would exert on the plane AC, by meeting&nbsp;it in </span><span class="font0">V. </span><span class="font1">Draw GI and HR perpendicular to BC, and&nbsp;HI perpendicular to G I. Alſo draw BR perpendicular to DC.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The force GH is equivalent to the two forces GI and GK ; and GK being in the direction of the plane&nbsp;has no ſhare in the impnlſe. The abſolute impulſe,&nbsp;therefore, is reprefeπted by GI ; the angle GHI is&nbsp;equal to FGC, the angle of incidence; and there·»&nbsp;fore GH is to GI as radius - to the fine of the&nbsp;angle of incidence : Therefore the direct impulſe&nbsp;of each particle or filament is to its abſolute ob-lique impulſe as radius to the fine of the angle of inci-dence. But further, the number of particles or filaments which ſtrike the ſurface AC, is to the number of&nbsp;thoſe which ſtrike the ſurſhce B C as A C to NC : for&nbsp;all the filaments between LA and MB go paſt the ob-lique furface BC without ſtriking it. But BC : NC≈&nbsp;rad. : fin. NBC, = rad. : fin. FGC, = rad. : fin. incidence. Now the whole impulſe is as the impulſe of&nbsp;each filament, and as the number of filaments exerting&nbsp;equal impulſes jointly ; therefore the whole direct im-pulſe on AC is to the whole abſolute impulſe on BC,&nbsp;as the ſquare of radius to the ſquare of the fine of the&nbsp;angle of incidence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Let S expreſs the extent of the ſurface, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i</span><span class="font1"> the angle of incidence, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">o</span><span class="font1"> the angle of obliquity, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">v</span><span class="font1"> the velocity&nbsp;of the fluid, and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">d</span><span class="font1"> its denfity. Let F repreſent the&nbsp;direct impulſe, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">f</span><span class="font1"> the abſolute oblique impulſe, and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">φ&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">the relative or effective impulſe : And let the tabular&nbsp;fines and coſines be coniidered as decimal fractions of&nbsp;the radius unity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This propofition gives us F : ∕ = R<sup>z</sup> : Sin.’ </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i, =</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> ι : </span><span class="font1">Sin.’ </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i,</span><span class="font1"> and therefore </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">f</span><span class="font1"> = F × Sin.’ z. Alſo, becauſe&nbsp;impulſes are in the proportion of the extent of ſurface&nbsp;fimilarly impelled, we have, in general, ∕= F S X&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">Sind, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The firſt who publiſhed this theorem was Pardies, in his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Oeuvres de Mathématique,</span><span class="font1"> in 1673. we., know that&nbsp;Newton had inveſtigated the chief propoſitions of the&nbsp;Principia before 1670.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Prop. III. The direct impulſe on any ſurſace is to the effective oblique impulſe on the ſame ſurface, as the&nbsp;cube of radius to the ſolid, which has for its baſe the&nbsp;ſquare of the fine of incidence, and the fine of obliquity for its height.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
