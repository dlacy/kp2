He did not purſue the method of the Fle-milh painters of ſiniſhing his pieces. He fometimes gave his light ſuch thick touches, that it ſeemed more like modelling than painting. A head of his has been ſhown, the noſe of which was fo thick of paint, as that which he copied from nature. He was told one day, that by his peculiar method of employing colours, his pieces appeared rugged and uneven—he replied, he was a painter, and not a dyer. He took a pleaſure in dreſſing his figures in an extraordinary manner : with this view he had collected a great number of eaſtern caps, ancient armour, and drapery long ſince out of faſhion. when he was adviſed to conſult antiquity to attain a better taſte in drawing, as his was uſually heavy and uneven, he took his counſellor to the cloſet where theie old veſtments were depoſited, -faying, by way of deri-ſion, thoſe were his antiques.</p><p>Rembrandt, like moſt men of genius, had many caprices. Being one day at work, painting a whole family in a ſingle picture, word being brought him that his monkey was dead, he was ſo affected at the loſs of this animal, that, without paying any attention to the perſons who were fitting for their pictures, he painted the monkey upon the ſame canvas. This whim could not ſail of diſpleafing thoſe the piece was deſigned for; but he would not efface it, chooſing rather to loſe the dale of his picture.</p><p>This freak will appear ſtill more extraordinary in Rembrandt, when it is conſidered that hc was extremely avaricious ; which vice daily grew upon him. He practiſed various ſtratagems to Fell his prints at a high price. The public were very deſirous of purchafing them, and not without reaſon. In his prints the ſame taſte prevails as in his pictures ; they are rough and irregular, but pictureſque. In order to heighten the value of his prints, and increaſe their price, he made his ſon fell them as if he had purloined them from his father ; others he expofed at public ſales, and went thither himſelf in diſguſſe to bid ſor them ; ſometimes fie gave out that he was going to leave Holland, and iettle in another conntry. Theſe ſtratagems were ſuc-eeſsful, and he got his own price for his prints. At other times he would print his plates half finiſhed, and expoſe them to ſale ; he afterwards finiſhed them, and they became ſrtſh plates, when they wanted retouch-ing, he made ſome alterations in them, which promoted the ſale of his prints a third time, though they differed but little ſrom the firſt impreſſions.</p><p>His pupils, who were not ignorant of his avarice, one day painted ſome pieces of money upon cards ; and Rembrandt no ſooner ſaw them, than he was going to take them up. Hc was not angry at the pleaſantry, but his avarice ſtill prevailed. He died in 1674.</p><p>REMEMBRANCE, is when the idea of ſomething formerly known recurs again to the mind without the operation of a like object on the external ſen-fo^ry.

He likewiſe iſſues proceffes againſt the collectors of the cuſtoms,exciſe, and others, for their accounts; and informations upon penal ſtatutes are entered and ſued in his office, where all proceedings in matters upon Engliſh bills in the ex-¢hequer-chamber remain. His duty further is to make out the bills of compoſitions upon penal laws, to take the ſtatement of debts ; and into his office are delivered all kinds of indentures and other evidences which concern the affuring any lands to the crown.

He takes the account of ſheriffs; and alſo keeps a record, by which it appears whether the ſheriffs or other accountants pay their proffers due at Eaſter and Michaelmas ; and at the ſame time he makes a record, whereby the ſheriffs or other accountants keep their prefixed days : there are likewiſe brought into his office all the accounts of cuſtomers, comptrollers, and accountants, in order to make entry thereof on record ; alſo all eſtreats and amercements are certified here, &amp;c.</p><p>The remembrancer of the firſhfruits takes all com-pofitions and bonds for the payment oſ firſt-fruits and tenths ; and makes out proceſs againſt iuch as do not pay the ſame.</p><p>REMINISCENCE, that power of the human mind, whereby it recollects itſelf, or calls again into its remembrance ſuch ideas or notions as it had really forgot : in which it differs from memory, which is a treaſuring up of things in the mind, and keeping them there, without forgetting them.</p><p>REMISSION, in phyſtcs, the abatement of the power or efficacy of any quality ; in oppoſttion to the <hi rend="italic">increaſe</hi>  of the ſame, which is called <hi rend="italic">intenjion.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Remission, in law, &amp;c. denotes the pardon of a crime, or the giving up the puniſhment due thereto.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Remission, in medicine, is when a diſtemper abates for a time, but does not go quite off.</hi></p><p>REMI ΓTANCE, in commerce, the traffick or return oſ money from one place to another, by bills of exchange, orders, or the like.</p><p>REMONSTRANCE, an expoſtulation or humble ſupplication, addreffed to a king, or other ſuperior, be-ſeeching him to reflect on the inconveniences or ill conſequences of fome order, edict, or the like.
