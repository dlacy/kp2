Plantations of gambier, pepper, and spices, have been already begun ; cultivation has also extended to the neighbouring islands, which formerly afforded a harbour for pirates. The water that is found in the island is excellent ; the soil is rich and fruitful ; the temperature is comparatively cool, the thermometer ranging between 71 and 89 ; and the climate, on the whole, is salubrious. On the south side of the island, an inlet penetrates into the in- terior, which is about 300 feet wide towards its mouth, has regular tides, and is capable of admitting lighters for about a quarter of a mile from the sea. On this inlet the town is built. Between this and a parallel inlet, at the distance of a quarter of a mile, is a square plain, faced with a high sandy beach free from surf, and terminated on the inner side by a steep hill, of a sufficient elevation to possess a beautiful and commanding view of the surrounding coun- try and the straits. On the frontier side of the inlet, is, on one hand, a regularly built Chinese town ; and, on the other, beyond the rivulet, an extensive plain, in front of which the sandy beach stretches into an inner bay, and whence another inlet encompasses it behind. Singapore harbour, or rather roadstead, situated four miles to the N.N.E. of St. John’s island in Singapore straits, affords a safe anchorage to ships in all seasons ; and, being clear of sudden danger, the approach to it is rendered easy by day or by night. Its position is also favourable for connec- ting the navigation of the straits, the track which the ships pursue being distant about five miles. The ships are well sheltered at the anchorage from E.N.E. round to north and west, as far as S. by W.</p><p>The population of Singapore consists of Chinese, Malays, Buggis. The principal merchants are Englishmen, of whom there are also a few shopkeepers, auctioneers, &amp;c. Some of the respectable merchants are Chinese, as are also the cultivators and other labourers. The Malays are chiefly employed as fishermen, in cutting timber, and in bringing supplies into the town from the surrounding neighbourhood ; and the boatmen are chiefly natives of the Coromandel coast.</p><p>Singapore trades to a great extent with all the countries and islands in the Eastern seas. One of the most valuable branches of trade is with Siam, which is carried on in the Siamese junks, which frequent the port of Singapore to the number of eighteen or twenty, and which are from 100 to 350 tons burden, the greater number being from 150 to 200. They import chiefly sugar, rice, cocoa nut oil, saffron wood, garro root, dried fish, and a small quantity of gamboge, sticklac, elephants’ teeth, raw silk, and onions ; and are said to be of the value of from 3000 to 15,000 Spanish dollars each. Many of these vessels belong entirely to their commanders, and the others to parties residing in Siam. Sugar is the most valuable part of their cargoes, which is nearly all taken by the European merchants, and is shipped for Europe, whither, also, are sent the ele- phants’ teeth and gamboge. Of the numerous tribes who visit this settlement, the Siamese carry off the greatest quantity of manufactured goods. Their return cargoes consist of Bengal muslins, sannahs, and gurrahs, (pieces of dress,) chintzes, European long clothe, cambrics, long ells, camblets, woollens, bees’ wax, camphor, gold dust, and a few rattans ; cotton twist is now also sought after. This trade is entirely confined to the Chinese, who are chiefly natives of the country, descendants of Chinese settlers. The trade with Cochin-China is not nearly so extensive or valuable as that with Siam. It is also carried on by means of junks, verging from 100 to 200 tons burden, which come to the number annually of between thirty and forty, from various ports along the whole coast of that immense country, and the gulf of Tonquin. The imports consist chiefly of rice and salt ; but they bring also in small quan- tities sticklac, gamboge, saffron wood, tortoise shell, coarse sugar, cocoa nut oil, cocoa nuts, pigs and goats, salted</p><p>vegetables, and other provisions. The return cargoes consist chiefly of opium, also of European long cloths, long ells, cambrics, Madras cloths, Indian piece goods, woollens, camlets, and a small quantity of gambier and rattans. A considerable trade is carried on with Campar, an ancient Malayan state on the east coast of Sumatra. This trade is entirely in the hands of the Malays, there being no Chinese settlers in that country, and is carried on in small proas, which visit Singapore monthly, in small fleets of ten or twelve, well armed, to guard them against the attacks of pirates, who infest the numerous straits that are formed amongst the Asiatic islands. They carry from fifteen to thirty men, and are armed with two long brass guns, spears, swords, &amp;c. Their cargoes consist principally of coffee ; but they also bring gambier, bees’ wax, twine, and cassia of an inferior quality, elephants’ teeth, rhinoceros’ horns, and a few rattans. These articles they readily dispose of on their arrival, to Chinese merchants, and receive in return white and unbleached Madras cloths, raw silk and cotton, European shirtings, cambrics, and chintzes, hand- kerchiefs, camblets, lead, iron, steel, gold thread, Java to- bacco, sticklac, &amp;c. Singapore also trades with the west coast of the island of Borneo, situated between Tanjong Dattoo and the northern extremity of the island, and with the Dutch settlements of Sambos, Mampawa and Pontianak. The whole of this trade is conducted by the Malays and Buggis, in proas belonging to the different ports whence they come. The proas from Borneo Proper are chiefly of the burden of from 800 to 1200 piculs, carrying from forty to sixty men each, and, like most native vessels, are well armed with long brass guns, as well as with spears, swords, and small arms. About fifteen or twenty of these vessels trade with Singapore ; and they make generally two voya- ges in the course of a year. Their imports principally consist of pepper, camphor, bees’ wax, birds’ nests, tortoise shell, mother-of-pearl shells, and pearls ; the cargoes being valued at from 2000 to 8000 Spanish dollars each. They are very readily disposed of to the richest Chinese merchants, in barter for blue and white Madras cloths, Bengal chintzes and white goods, European chintzes and long cloths, iron, steel, cotton twist in blue, red, and white, blue and yellow nankeens, Chinese gold thread, and various other minor articles. The annual value of this trade is estimated at from 60,000 to 70,000 Spanish dollars. With the Dutch settlements the trade is still more considerable. From Sambas about fifteen to twenty proas arrive at Singapore every six months, each bringing cargoes of gold dust, ac- cording to the means of the trader, and scarcely any other commodity, on account of the heavy duties imposed on exports to a British port. From Mampawa and Pontianak about thirty or forty proas come twice a-year with gold dust, diamonds, tin, and rattans. The different cargoes are said to vary from 2000 to 20,000 dollars ; the value of the whole trade is estimated at 250,000 Spanish dollars. In return they take chiefly Bengal and Madras piece goods and iron. They take no British manufactured goods, in consequence of the heavy protecting duties imposed on them by the Dutch, for the encouragement of the trade of the mother country ; and no opium, because it is monopolized by the government, of which, however, only a few chests are disposed of ; the chief supply being brought by the con- traband traders. About ten or twelve Chinese junks commonly arrive from Amoy and Canton. Their imports are earthenware, tiles, granite, slates, paper umbrellas, vermi- celli, dried fruits, sticks, paper, tobacco, and a few nankeens, raw silk, &amp;c. The cargoes from Canton are said generally to consist of the same articles, with the addition of silk, camlets, satins, camphor, sugar candy, and tea, and a much greater proportion of nankeens and raw silk. Those cargoes, of which the value of each is from 30,000 to 60,000 dollars, generally belong to the owners of the junks, who remain in China. These junks are generally of about from</p></body></text></TEI>
