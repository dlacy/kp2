<p><span class="font0">of falſchood. They are led to conceive it their wtſeſt policy to ſhut their eyes upon realities; happy if by any&nbsp;perverſion of intellect they can perſuade themſelves that&nbsp;they were right in their firſt crude opinion of their companion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ So long as two human beings are forbidden by poſitive inſtitution to follow the dictates of their own&nbsp;mind, prejudice is alive and vigorous. So long as I&nbsp;ſeek to engroſs one woman to myſelf, and to prohibit&nbsp;my neighbour ſrom proving his ſuperior deſert and reaping the fruits of it, I am guilty of the moſt odious of&nbsp;all monopolies. Over this imaginary prize men watch&nbsp;with perpetual jealouſy ; and one man will find his de-ſires and his capacity to circumvent as much excited, as&nbsp;the other is excited to traverſe his projects and fruſtrate&nbsp;his hopes. As long as this ſtate of ſociety continues,&nbsp;philanthropy will be crcſſed and checked in a thouſand&nbsp;ways, and the ſtill augmenting ſtream of abuſe will continue to flow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ The abolition of marriage will be attended with no evils. The intercourſe of the ſexcs will fall under&nbsp;the ſame ſyſtem as any other ſpecies of friendſhip. Excluſively of all groundleſs and obſtinate attachments, it&nbsp;will be impoſſible for me to live in the world without&nbsp;finding one man of a worth ſuperior to that of any&nbsp;other whom I have an opportunity of obſerving. To&nbsp;this man I ſhall feel a kindneſs in exact proportion to&nbsp;my apprehenſion of his worth. The caſe will be pre-ciſely the ſame with reſpect to the ſemale ſex ; I ſhall&nbsp;aſſiduouſly cultivate the intercourse of that woman whoſe&nbsp;accompliſhments ſhall ſtrike me in the moſt poweiſſul&nbsp;manner. ‘ But it may happen that other men will feel&nbsp;for her the ſame preference that I do.’ This will&nbsp;create no difficulty. We may all enjoy her converſa-tion ; and we ſhall all be wile enough to conſider the&nbsp;ſtnſual intercourse as a very trivial object. This, like&nbsp;every other affair in which two perſons are concerned,&nbsp;muſt be regulated in each ſucceſſive inſtance by the unforced coulent of either party. It is a mark of the extreme depravity of our preſent habits, that we are inclined to ſuppoſe the ſenſual intercourſe anywiſe material to the advantages ariſing from the pureſt affec&nbsp;tion. Reaſonable men now eat and drink, not from&nbsp;the love of pleaſure, but becauſe eating and drinking&nbsp;are effential to our healthful exiſtence. Reaſonable&nbsp;men then will propagate their ſpecies, not becauſe a&nbsp;certain ſenſible pleaſure is annexed to this action, but&nbsp;becauſe it is right the ſpecies ſhould be propagated ;&nbsp;and the manner in wdrch they exerciſe this function&nbsp;will be regulated by the dictates of reaſon and duty.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is right then, according to this political innovator, that the ſpecies ſhould be propagated, and reaſonable&nbsp;men in his Utopian commonwealth would be inci∣cd by&nbsp;reaſon and duty to propagate them : but the way to&nbsp;fulbl this duty, experience, which is ſeldom at one with&nbsp;ſpeculative reformation, has already demonſtrated, not&nbsp;to conſiſt in the promiſcuous intercourſe of ſeveral men&nbsp;with one woman, but in the fidelity of individuals of&nbsp;the t∖*.o ſexes to each other. Common prtfſtitutes&nbsp;among us ſeldom prove with child ; and the ſociety of&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Arreoys</span><span class="font0"> in Otaheitee, who have completely diveſted&nbsp;themſelves of what our author calls </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">prejudice,</span><span class="font0"> and are by&nbsp;no means guilty of his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">maſt odious cſ all monopolies,</span><span class="font0"> are&nbsp;for the moſt part childleſs (ſee Otaheitee). He&nbsp;ſeems to think that a ſtate of equal property would ne-</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">ceſſitrily deſtroy our reliſh for luxury, dtcreaſe our inordinate appetites of every kind, and lead us univerſally to prefer the pleaſures of intellect to the pleaſures of&nbsp;ſenſe. But here again experience is againft him. The&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Arreοys,</span><span class="font0"> who have a property in their women perfectly&nbsp;equal, are the moſt luxurious and ſenſual wretches on&nbsp;the face of the earth ; ſenſual indeed to a degree of&nbsp;which the moſt libidinous European can hardly form a&nbsp;conception.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">By admitting it to be a duty to propagate the ſpecies, our author muſt neceſſarily grant that every thing is right which is requilite to the fulfilling of that duty,&nbsp;and the contrary wrong. If ſo, promiſcuous concubinage is wrong, ſince we have ſeen, that by a law of nature it is incompatible with the duty ; whence it follows&nbsp;on his own principles, that the ſexual union by pairs '&nbsp;muſt be right. The only queſtion therefore to be decided between him and his opponents is, “ Whether&nbsp;ſhould that union be temporary or permanent ?” And&nbsp;we think the following obſervations by Mr Paley ſufficient to decide it to the conviction of every perſon not&nbsp;blinded by the rage of innovation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ A lawgiver, whoſe counrſels were directed by views of general utility, and obſtructed by no local impediments, would make the marriage-contract indiſſoluble&nbsp;during the joint lives of the parties, for the fake of the&nbsp;following advantages: Such a union tends to preſerve&nbsp;peace and concord between married perſons, by perpetuating their common intereſt, and by inducing a ne-ceſſity of mutual compliance. An earlier termination&nbsp;of it would produce a ſeparate intereſt. The wife&nbsp;would naturally look forward to the diſſolution of the&nbsp;partnerſhip, and endeavour to draw to herſelf a fund again!! the time when ſhe was no longer to have acceſs&nbsp;to the ſame reſources. This would beget peculation on&nbsp;one ſide, and miſtruſt on the other ; evils which at preſent very little diſturb the confidence of married life.&nbsp;The ſecond effect of making the union determinable&nbsp;only by death, is not leſs beneficial. It neceſſarily happens, that adverſe tempers, habits, and taſtes, oftentimes&nbsp;meet in marriage. In which caſe, each party muſt take&nbsp;pains to give up what offends, and practice what may&nbsp;gratiſy, the other. A man and woman in love with&nbsp;each other do this inſenſibly : but love is neither general nor durable ; and where that is wanting, no leffons&nbsp;of duty, no delicacy of ſentiment, will go half ſo far&nbsp;with the generality of mankind and womankind as this&nbsp;one intelligible reflection, that they muſt each make the&nbsp;beſt of their bargain ; and that ſeeing they muſt either&nbsp;both be miſerable or both ſhare in the ſame happineſs,&nbsp;neither can find their own comfort but in promoting&nbsp;the pleaſure of the other. Theſe compliances, though&nbsp;at firſt extorted by neceſſity, become in time eaſy and&nbsp;mutual; and though leſs endearing than aſſiduities which&nbsp;take their riſe from affection, generally procure to&nbsp;the married pair a repoſe and ſatisfaction ſufficient for&nbsp;their happinels.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">So differently from our author does this judicious writer reaſon concerning the effects of-a permanent&nbsp;union on the tempers of the married pair. Inſtead of&nbsp;ſubjecting them to ſome inevitable portion of thwarting, bickering, and unhappineſs, it lays them, in his&nbsp;opinion, under the neceſſity of curbing their unruly&nbsp;paſſions, and acquiring habits of gen tleneſs, forbearance,&nbsp;and peace. To this we may add, that both believing</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
