<p><span class="font0">length of the stirrups will depend a good deal upon the shape and action of the horse, but the nature of the animal and the&nbsp;peculiarities of the country ridden over will also have something to&nbsp;do with their adjustment. A puller will compel the rider to shorten&nbsp;his leathers one or perhaps two holes—a course that may also be&nbsp;rendered necessary in a hilly country, for, in going down hill, the&nbsp;stirrups, if kept at the ordinary length, will generally feel a great&nbsp;deal too long. The rider’s body must be always close to the saddle&nbsp;in leaping, for if he were jerked up, the weight of say only a 10-stone man coming down on the horse a couple of seconds after he&nbsp;has negotiated a large fence is sufficient to throw the animal down.&nbsp;Nothing but actual practice with hounds can teach a man how to&nbsp;ride where all kinds of going and obstacles of various sorts, natural&nbsp;and artificial, have to be encountered in a day’s hunting. For&nbsp;example, the country gone over is seldom level springy turf; it is&nbsp;up hill and down dale, across ridge and furrow, over ground studded&nbsp;with ant-hills (which, unlike mole-hills, are often very hard), over&nbsp;ploughed or boggy land. Each of these varieties requires a different&nbsp;method of riding over, and nearly every horse will require different&nbsp;handling under similar circumstances. It will therefore be seen&nbsp;that much depends on the rider having good hands. This qualification, though generally understood, is difficult to define. A rider&nbsp;with good hands never depends upon his reins for Tetaininghisseat ;&nbsp;nor does he pull at the horse’s mouth so as to make him afraid to&nbsp;go up to his bit; nor again does he ever use more force than is&nbsp;necessary for the accomplishment of what he desires to perform.&nbsp;But besides all this, there is an unaccountable Syaapathetic something about the man with good hands that cannot be described.&nbsp;Pullers appear to renounce pulling, refusers take to jumping and&nbsp;clumsy horses become nearly as handy as a trick horse in a circus.&nbsp;Though hands can to a great extent be acquired by care and&nbsp;practice, yet in the highest form this is a gift and cannot be learned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There are different kinds of ” fences,” as all obstacles are generic-ally called. First, there is timber, such as gates, stiles and rails; the first two are, nine times out of ten, awkward jumps, as the take&nbsp;off is either poached by cattle, or else is on the ascent or descent.&nbsp;Hedges vary according to the custom of the country in which they&nbsp;are found: they either grow in the soil of the field, and are protected&nbsp;by a ditch on one side, or are planted on a bank with a ditch on&nbsp;one side or sometimes on both. Then again there are such large&nbsp;banks as are found in Wales, Devon and Cornwall. Lastly come&nbsp;water jumps, which are met with in two forms: the water is either&nbsp;within an inch or two of the top of the bank, so as to be about on&nbsp;a level with the field through which it flows, or there may be a space&nbsp;of some 6 or 7 ft. from the bank to the water. For the successful&nbsp;negotiation of brooks a bold horse is required, ridden by a bold man.&nbsp;No fence that is ever encountered stops such a large proportion of&nbsp;the field as water; even a clear 6 ft. of it will prove a hindrance to&nbsp;some, while anything over 10 or 12 ft. will in general be crossed only&nbsp;by a very few. Some horses, good performers over any description&nbsp;of fence, will not jump water under any circumstances; while the&nbsp;chance of a ducking deters many from riding at it; and, however&nbsp;bold the horse may be, he will soon refuse water if his rider be&nbsp;perpetually in two minds when approaching it. </span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The pace at which a hunter should be ridden at his fences depends upon the nature of the fence, and the peculiarities of each individual&nbsp;horse. With some very good jumpers— they can hardly be called&nbsp;good hunters—to steady them is to bid for a fall, while with some&nbsp;very clever hunters to hurry them is to bring them to grief. With&nbsp;ordinary’ horses, however, it is a good general rule to ride at fences&nbsp;of all Ciescriptions as slowly as the nature of the obstacle admits.&nbsp;In grass countries, where “ flying fences ” are found, the rate of&nbsp;speed must of necessity be quicker than when about to take a&nbsp;Devonshire bank of some 7 ft. high, but even at a flying fence the&nbsp;rider should steady his horse so as to contract the length of his&nbsp;stride, in order that he may measure the distance for taking off&nbsp;with greater accuracy. Flying fences consist of a hedge with or&nbsp;without a post and rail, and with or without a ditch on one or both&nbsp;sides; consequently a horse has to jump both high and wide to&nbsp;clear them. But in jumping a gate, or a flight of rails, as ordinarily&nbsp;situated, there is no width to be covered, and to make a horse go&nbsp;through the exertion of jumping both high and wide when he need&nbsp;only do one is to waste his power, added to which to ride fast at&nbsp;timber, unless very low with a ditch on the landing side, is highly&nbsp;dangerous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">All hedges on banks, banks and doubles must be ridden at slowly; they are usually of such a size as. to make flying them&nbsp;impossible, or at least undesirable. Horses jump them on and off,&nbsp;and in taking them at a moderate pace there is a chance of stopping&nbsp;on the top and choosing a better place to jump from, or, if needs be,&nbsp;of returning and taking the fence at another place. Cramped&nbsp;places will have to be jumped from a walk or even at a stand; for&nbsp;instance, a tree may be in a line with and close to the only practicable place in a fence; it then becomes necessary to go round&nbsp;the tree before a run at the place can be managed. So, too, with&nbsp;places that have to be crawled over between trees, or with dykes&nbsp;to be crawled down.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In jumping an ordinary hedge or ditch at moderate speed, there is of course a moment of time during which the horse is on his&nbsp;hind legs, and in theory the rider should then lean forward, but,&nbsp;in practice, this position is so momentary, and the lash out of the&nbsp;hind legs in the spring is so powerful, that it is best not to lean&nbsp;forward at all, because of the difficulty, if not impossibility, of getting&nbsp;back in time for the reverse movement, when the rider should be&nbsp;preparing to render the horse some assistance with the bridle as&nbsp;his feet touch the ground.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When a line of willows indicates the whereabouts of a brook, the horse should be well collected, a clear place selected, so far as&nbsp;circumstances allow, and the pace increased, though in short strides,&nbsp;up to the very brink. If the hounds jump at the brook, even though&nbsp;they fail to clear it, the rider may take it for granted that at that&nbsp;place the leap is within the capacity of any ordinary hunter in his&nbsp;stride; hence if, when going at three parts speed, a horse's feet&nbsp;come just right to take off, the mere momentum of his body would&nbsp;take him over a place 15 ft. wide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The experience of a single day’s hunting will teach the novice that gates are far offener opened than jumped; it is therefore&nbsp;necessary that a hunter should be handy at opening them. Many&nbsp;accidents have arisen from horses rushing through a gateway&nbsp;directly the latch is released, or from their jumping a gate at&nbsp;which they have been pulled up to enable the rider to open it. The&nbsp;horse should be taught to obey the leg as well as the hand, and, by a&nbsp;slight pressure of the leg, should throw his haunches round to the&nbsp;left or right as occasion may require.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Racing</span><span class="font0"> (see also </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Horse-Racing).</span><span class="font0">—The qualities possessed by a good jockey, either on the flat or across country, show the value of&nbsp;early instruction in riding. After having been some time in a training stable, a lad is put on a quiet horse at exercise; his stirrups&nbsp;arc adjusted, and the reins knotted for him at a proper length. He&nbsp;subsequently rides other horses, each with some peculiarity perhaps,&nbsp;and, to keep his place in the string, a sluggard must be kept going,&nbsp;and an impetuous one restrained; they cannot both be ridden&nbsp;alike, but they must both be ridden as a jockey should ride them.&nbsp;In this way the lad learns the principle of holding a puller, getting&nbsp;pace out of a lazy one, and leaving well alone with a nice free but&nbsp;temperate mover; he learns to do everything in a horsemanlike&nbsp;manner, and when he has raised himself to the pitch of a “ fashionable ” jockey, he will frequently be called upon to ride several&nbsp;horses a day at race meetings. A jockey must therefore, more than&nbsp;any other civilian rider, have a hand for all sorts of horses, and in&nbsp;the case of two and three year olds a very good hand it must be.&nbsp;The same ability to adapt himself to circumstances must be possessed&nbsp;by the steeple-chase jockey, who should possess fine hands to enable&nbsp;him to handle his horse while going at his fences at three-quarter&nbsp;speed. In most details the nearer a hunting man approaches to&nbsp;a steeple-chase jockey the better; but in the matter of the seat it&nbsp;must be remembered that a jockey’s exertions last but a few minutes,&nbsp;while none can tell when the hunting man may finish his day's&nbsp;work; the jockey can therefore ride with more absolute grip during&nbsp;his race than the rider to hounds.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RIDlNGS are the three districts into which from ancient times Yorkshire has been divided for administrative purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">FormerIy there were similar districts in Lindsey in Lincolnshire. The word riding was originally Written as</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;"> thrithing</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">thriding,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">but the initial </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">th</span><span class="font0"> has been absorbed in the final </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">th</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">t</span><span class="font0"> of the&nbsp;words north, south, east and west, by which it was normally&nbsp;preceded. Ridings are Scandinavian institutions. In Iceland&nbsp;the third part of a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">thing</span><span class="font0"> which corresponds roughly to an&nbsp;English county was called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">thrithjungr,</span><span class="font0"> in Norway, however,&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">thrithjungr</span><span class="font0"> seems to have been an ecclesiastical division.&nbsp;According to the 12th-century compilation known as the “ laws&nbsp;of Edward the Confessor,” the riding was the third part of a&nbsp;county </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(provincial,</span><span class="font0"> to it causes were brought which could not&nbsp;be determined in the wapentake, and a matter which could&nbsp;not be determined in the riding was brought into the court&nbsp;of the shire. There is abundant evidence that riding courts&nbsp;were held after the Norman Conquest. A charter which&nbsp;Henry I. granted to the Church of St Peter’s at York mentions&nbsp;wapentacmot, tridingmot and shircsmot, and exemptions from&nbsp;suit to the thriding or riding may be noticed frequently in the&nbsp;charters of the Norman kings. As yet, however, the jurisdiction&nbsp;and functions of these courts have not been ascertained. It&nbsp;seems probable from the silence of the records that they had&nbsp;already fallen into disuse early in the 13th century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Each of the ridings of Yorkshire has its own lord lieutenant and commission of the peace, and under the Local Government&nbsp;Act of 1888 forms a separate administrative county.
