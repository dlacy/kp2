<p><span class="font2">pores and cavities. This happy invention secured the success of the casting of a solid 3-foot speculum in 1840, and encouraged&nbsp;Lord Rosse to make a speculum of 6 feet diameter, which he also&nbsp;succeeded in doing in 1842. In the beginning of 1845 this great&nbsp;reflector (which up to the present time has remained without a&nbsp;rival) was mounted and ready for work. The instrument has a&nbsp;focal length of 54 feet and the tube is about 7 feet in diameter ;&nbsp;owing to these large dimensions it cannot be pointed to every part&nbsp;of the heavens, but can only be moved a short distance from the&nbsp;meridian and very little to the north of the zenith ; these restrictions have, however, hardly been felt, as there is almost at any&nbsp;moment a sufficient number of objects within its reach. From&nbsp;1848 to 1878 it was with but few interruptions employed for&nbsp;observations of nebulæ ; and many previously unknown features in&nbsp;these objects were revealed by it, especially the remarkable spiral&nbsp;configuration prevailing in many of the brighter nebulæ. A special&nbsp;study was made of the nebula of Orion, and the resulting large&nbsp;drawing gives an extremely good representation of this complicated&nbsp;object. Since 1845 others have followed in Lord Rosse’s footsteps&nbsp;and several 3- and 4-foot mirrors have been made, while the development of refracting telescopes has been so rapid that, whereas twenty-five years ago there were no object glasses larger than 15 inches in&nbsp;existence, a 30-inch glass has now actually been completed. But,&nbsp;though the refractors surpass the large reflectors in general convenience of use and are very much better adapted to work of precision (micrometer measures), Lord Rosse’s great reflector is still&nbsp;unapproached in light-grasping power, and remains a noble&nbsp;monument of'its maker, who (as beautifully expressed on a&nbsp;memorial tablet in the parish church of Birr) “revealed to mankind&nbsp;by the unrivalled creation of his genius a wider vision of the glory&nbsp;of God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Lord Rosse gave a detailed account of the experiments which step by step had led to the construction of the 3-foot speculum in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Philosophical Transactions&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">for 1840. In the same publication for 1844 and 1850 he communicated short&nbsp;descriptions and drawings of some of the more interesting nebulæ, and in the&nbsp;volume for 18G1 he published a paper </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">On the Construction of Specula of 6 feet&nbsp;aperture, and a Selection from the Observations of Nebulæ made with them,</span><span class="font1"> with&nbsp;numerous engravings. The accounts of the observations given in these papers&nbsp;were, however, of a very fragmentary character; but in 1879-80 a complete&nbsp;account of them was published by the present earl (“Observations of nebulæ and&nbsp;clusters </span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font1">stars made with the 6-footand 3-foot reflectors at BirrCastlefrom 1848&nbsp;to 1878”) in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Scient. Trans. R. Dublin Soc.,</span><span class="font1"> vol. H. The drawing of the nebula&nbsp;of Orion was published in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Phil.

<p><span class="font3">ROSSELLI, Cosrao (l439-c. 1507), a Florentine painter, was born in 1439. At the age of fourteen he became a&nbsp;pupil of Neri di Bicci, and in 1460 he worked as assistant&nbsp;to his cousin Bernardo di Stefano Rosselli. The first work&nbsp;of Cosimo mentioned by Vasari still exists in S. Ambrogio,&nbsp;in Florence, over the third altar on the left. It is an&nbsp;Assumption of the Virgin, a youthful and feeble work of&nbsp;but little merit. In the same church, on the wall of one&nbsp;of the chapels, is a fresco by Cosimo which Vasari praises&nbsp;highly, especially for a portrait of the young scholar Pico&nbsp;of Mirandola. The scene, a procession bearing a miracle-working chalice, is painted with much vigour and less&nbsp;mannerism than most of this artist’s work. A picture&nbsp;painted by Rosselli for the church of the Annunziata,&nbsp;with figures of SS. Barbara, Matthew, and the Baptist,&nbsp;is now in the Academy of Florence. Rosselli also spent&nbsp;some time in Lucca, where he painted several altar-pieces for various churches, none of any great importance.&nbsp;A picture attributed to him, taken from the church of&nbsp;S. Girolamo at Fiesole, is now in the National Gallery&nbsp;of London. It is a large retable, with, in the centre, St&nbsp;Jerome in the wilderness kneeling before a crucifix, and at&nbsp;the sides standing figures of St Damasus and St Eusebius,&nbsp;St Paolo and St Eustachia ; below is a predella with&nbsp;small subjects. Though dry and hard in treatment, the&nbsp;figures are designed with much dignity. The Berlin&nbsp;Gallery possesses three pictures by Rosselli, the Virgin in&nbsp;Glory, the Entombment of Christ, and the Massacre of the&nbsp;Innocents. In 1480 Rosselli, together with the chief&nbsp;painters of Florence, was invited by Sixtus IV. to Rome&nbsp;to assist in the painting of the frescos in the Sistine&nbsp;Chapel. Three of these were executed by him—the&nbsp;Destruction of Pharaoh’s Army in the Red Sea, Christ&nbsp;Preaching by the Lake of Tiberias, and the Last Supper.&nbsp;The last of these is still well preserved, but is a very&nbsp;mediocre work. Vasari’s story about the pope admiring&nbsp;his paintings more than those of his abler brother painters&nbsp;has probably but little foundation. Rosselli’s Sistiue&nbsp;frescos were partly painted by his assistant Piero di&nbsp;Cosimo, who was so called after Cosimo Rosselli. His&nbsp;chief pupil was Fra Bartolommeo. According to Vasari,&nbsp;Rosselli died in 1484, but this is evidently a mistake, as&nbsp;his will still exists dated November 25, 1506 (see Gaye,&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Gar. ined.,</span><span class="font3"> ii. 457, note).</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">ROSSELLINO, </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Antonio (1427-c.</span><span class="font3"> 1479), one of the most skilful of Florentine sculptors, was the son of Matteo&nbsp;di Domenico Gamberelli, and had four brothers, who all&nbsp;practised some branch of the fine arts. Almost nothing is&nbsp;known about the life of Antonio, but many of his works</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">still exist, and are of the highest beauty, full of strong religious sentiment, and executed with the utmost delicacy'&nbsp;of touch and technical skill. The style of Antonio&nbsp;and his brother (see below) is a development of that of&nbsp;Donatello and Ghiberti ; it possesses all the refinement and&nbsp;soft sweetness of the earlier masters, but is not equal to&nbsp;them either in vigour or originality. Antonio’s chief work,&nbsp;still in perfect preservation, is the very lovely tomb of a&nbsp;young cardinal prince of Portugal, who died in 1459,&nbsp;aged only twenty-six. It occupies one side of a small&nbsp;chapel on the north of the nave of San Miniato.@@<sup>1</sup> The&nbsp;recumbent effigy of the cardinal is very remarkable for the&nbsp;grace of its pose and the beauty of the portrait face. It&nbsp;rests on a handsome sarcophagus, and over it, under the&nbsp;arch which frames the whole, is a beautiful relief of the&nbsp;Madonna between two flying angels. The tomb was&nbsp;begun in 1461 and finished in 1466 ; Antonio received&nbsp;four hundred and twenty-five gold florins for it. A reproduction of this tomb with slight alterations, and of course&nbsp;a different effigy, was made by Antonio for the wife of&nbsp;Antonio Piccolomini, duke of Amalfi, in the church of S.&nbsp;Maria del Monte at Naples, where it still exists. For the&nbsp;same church he also executed some delicate reliefs, which&nbsp;perhaps err in being too pictorial in style, especially in the&nbsp;treatment of the backgrounds. A fine medallion relief&nbsp;by him is preserved in the Bargello at Florence (see fig.),&nbsp;and the original terra cotta model for this is in the possession of Mr Drury Fortnum ; in some small matters of</span></p>
