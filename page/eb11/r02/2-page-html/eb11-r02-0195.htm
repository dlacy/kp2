<p><span class="font3">as a pupil of Professor E. Leonhard for piano, Professor Herzog for organ and J. J. Maier for counterpoint. After leaving the&nbsp;school he had private lessons from Franz Lachner, and was&nbsp;appointed a professor in the conservator!urn in succession to&nbsp;Leonhard in 1859. In i860 he became professor of composition,&nbsp;and was appointed organist of the Michelskirche, a post he held&nbsp;till 1866. In 1877 he succeeded WUllner as Hofkapellmeister,&nbsp;and from that time his attention was largely devoted to sacred&nbsp;music. His compositions include works of importance in every&nbsp;form, from the operas </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Die sieben Raben</span><span class="font3"> (Munich, 1869) and&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Türmers Tochterlein</span><span class="font3"> (Munich, 1873) and oratorio </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Christo-fonis,</span><span class="font3"> op. 120, to the well-known quartet for piano and strings&nbsp;in E flat, op. 38, the nonet for wind and strings, op. 139, and&nbsp;the seventeen organ sonatas, which form notable additions&nbsp;to the literature of the instrument. He died in November&nbsp;1901.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">RHEINE, a town of Germany, in the Prussian province of Westphalia, situated on the Ems, at the point where it becomes&nbsp;navigable, 29 m. W. by rail of Osnabrück, and at the junction&nbsp;of main lines to Münster, Rotterdam and Emden. Pop. (1905)&nbsp;12,801. It is an old-fashioned town with a pronounced Dutch&nbsp;aspect, and has pretty gardens and promenades. Rheine is the&nbsp;seat of cotton industries, has manufactures of jute, machinery,&nbsp;tobacco and flour, and a considerable river trade in agricultural&nbsp;produce. It received municipal rights in 1327. About a mile&nbsp;north of Rheine is the castle of Bentlage, the family seat of the&nbsp;princes of Rheina-Wolbeck.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">RHENANUS, BEATUS (1485-1547), German humanist, was born in 1485 at Schlettstadt in Alsace, where his father, named&nbsp;Bild, a native of Rheinau (hence the surname </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Rhenanus),</span><span class="font3"> was a&nbsp;prosperous butcher. He received his early education at the&nbsp;famous Latin school of Schlettstadt, and afterwards (1503) went&nbsp;to Paris, where he came under the influence of Jacobus Faber&nbsp;Stapulensis, an eminent Aristotelian. In 1511 he removed to&nbsp;Basel, where he became intimate with Desiderius Erasmus, and&nbsp;took an active share in the publishing enterprises of Joannes&nbsp;Froben </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.).</span><span class="font3"> In 1526 he returned to Schlettstadt, and devoted&nbsp;himself to a life of learned leisure, enlivened with epistolary&nbsp;and personal intercourse with Erasmus (the printing of whose&nbsp;more important works he personally superintended) and many&nbsp;other scholars of his time. He died at Strassburg on the 20th of&nbsp;July IS47·</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">RHETICUS, or </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rhaeticus</span><span class="font3"> (1514-1576), a surname given to </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">George Joachim,</span><span class="font3"> German astronomer and mathematician,&nbsp;from his birth at Feldkirch in that part of Tirol which was&nbsp;anciently the territory of the Rhaeti. Born on the 15th of&nbsp;February 1514, he studied at Tiguri with Oswald Mycone, and&nbsp;afterwards went to Wittenberg where he was appointed professor of mathematics in 1537. Being greatly attracted by the&nbsp;new Copernican theory, he resigned the professorship in 1539,&nbsp;and went to Frauenberg to associate himself with Copernicus&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.),</span><span class="font3"> and superintended the printing of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">De Orbium Revolu-tione</span><span class="font3"> which he had persuaded Copernicus to complete. Rheticus&nbsp;now began his great treatise, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Opus Palatinum de Triangulis,&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">and continued to work at it while he occupied his old chair at&nbsp;Wittenberg, and indeed up to his death at Cassovia in Hungary,&nbsp;on the 4th of December 1576. The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Opus Palatinum of</span><span class="font3"> Rheticus&nbsp;was published by Valentine Otho, mathematician to the electoral&nbsp;prince palatine, in 1596. It gives tables of sines and cosines,&nbsp;tangents, &amp;c., for every 10 seconds, calculated to ten places.&nbsp;He had projected a table of the same kind to fifteen places, but&nbsp;did not live to complete it. The sine table, however, was&nbsp;afterwards published on this scale under the name of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Thesaurus</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Mathematicus</span><span class="font3"> (Frankfort, 1613) by B. Pitiscus (1561-1613), who himself carried the calculation of a few of the earlier sines&nbsp;to twenty-two places. He also published </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Narraiio de Libris&nbsp;Revolutionum Copernici</span><span class="font3"> (Gedenum, 1540), which was subsequently added to editions of Copernicus’s works; and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Ephemer·&nbsp;ides</span><span class="font3"> until 1551, which were founded on the Copemican doctrines.&nbsp;He projected numerous other works, as is shown by a letter to&nbsp;Peter Ramus in 1568, which Adrian Romanus inserted in the&nbsp;preface to his </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Idea of Mathematics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">RHETORIC (Gr. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ρητορίκή τέχνη,</span><span class="font3"> the art of the orator), the art of using language in such a way as to produce a desired&nbsp;impression upon the hearer or reader. The object is strictly&nbsp;persuasion rather than intellectual approval or conviction;&nbsp;hence the term, with its adjective “ rhetorical,” is commonly&nbsp;used for a'speech or writing in which matter is subservient&nbsp;to form or display. So in grammar, a “ rhetorical question ” is&nbsp;one which is asked not for the purpose of obtaining an, answer,&nbsp;but simply for dramatic effect. The power of eloquent speech&nbsp;is recognized in the earliest extant writings. Homer describes&nbsp;Achilles as a “ speaker of words, as well as a doer of deeds&nbsp;Nestor, Menelaus and Odysseus are all orators as well as statesmen and soldiers. Again the brilliant eloquence of Periclcs is&nbsp;the theme of Aristophanes and Eupolis. Naturally the influence wielded by the great orators led to an investigation of&nbsp;the characteristics of successful rhetoric, and especially from the&nbsp;time of Aristotle the technique of the art ranked among the&nbsp;recognized branches of learning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A lost work of Aristotle is quoted by Diogenes Laertius (viii. 57) as saying that Empedocles “ invented ” (eupetp)&nbsp;rhetoric; Zeno, dialectic (f.e. logic, the art of making a logical&nbsp;argument, apart from the style). This is certainly not to be&nbsp;understood as meaning that Empedocles composed the first&nbsp;“ art ” of rhetoric. It is rather to be explained by Aristotle’s&nbsp;own remark, cited by Laertius from another lost treatise, that&nbsp;Empedocles was “ a master of expression and skilled in the use&nbsp;of metaphor ”—qualities which may have found scope in his&nbsp;political oratory, when, after the fall of Thrasydaeus in 472 </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">B.c.,&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">he opposed the restoration of a tyranny at Agrigentum. The&nbsp;founder of rhetoric as an art was Corax of Syracuse&nbsp;(c. 466 B.c.). In 466 a democracy was established&nbsp;in Syracuse. One of the immediate consequences&nbsp;was a mass of litigation on claims to property, urged&nbsp;by democratic exiles who had been dispossessed by&nbsp;Thrasybulus, Hiero or Gelo. Such claims, going many years&nbsp;back, would often require that a complicated series of details&nbsp;should be stated and arranged. It would also, in many instances,&nbsp;lack documentary support, and rely chiefly on inferential&nbsp;reasoning. Hence the need of professional advice. The facts&nbsp;known as to the “ art ” of Corax perfectly agree with these&nbsp;conditions. He gave rules for arrangement, dividing the&nbsp;speech into five parts—proem, narrative, arguments (άγώρ€$),&nbsp;subsidiary remarks (παρέκβασχ?) and peroration. Next he&nbsp;illustrated the topic of general probability (ekôs),&nbsp;showing its two-edged use: e.g., if a puny man is&nbsp;accused of assaulting a stronger, he can say, “ Is it&nbsp;likely that I should have attacked him?” If vice versa,&nbsp;the strong man can argue, “ Is it likely that I should have&nbsp;committed an assault where the presumption was sure to be&nbsp;against me ?” This topic of ekôs, in its manifold forms, was in&nbsp;fact the great weapon of the earliest Greek rhetoric. It was&nbsp;further developed by Tisias, the pupil of Corax, as we&nbsp;see from Plato’s </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Phaedrus,</span><span class="font3"> in an “ art ” of rhetoric&nbsp;which antiquity possessed, but of which we know little else.&nbsp;Aristotle gives the ctxôs a place among the topics of the fallacious&nbsp;enthymeme which he enumerates in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">RheL</span><span class="font3"> ii. 24, remarking&nbsp;that it was the very essence of the treatise of Corax; he points&nbsp;out the fallacy of omitting to distinguish between abstract and&nbsp;particular probability, quoting the verses of Agatho,—“ Perhaps&nbsp;one might call this very thing a probability, that many improbable things will happen to men.” Gorgias (ç.r.)&nbsp;of Leontini captivated the Athenians in 427 </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.</span><span class="font3"> by <sup>rgias</sup>^&nbsp;his oratory (Diod. xii. 53), which, so far as we can judge, was</span></p>
