Many of these felsites have fluxion banding, SpheruHtes and even perHtic cracks, which are strong evidence that they were originally glassy. In other cases a hyaloHparite, obsidian, or pitchstone becomes felsitic along its borders and joint planes, or even along perlitic cracks, and we may assume that the once fibrous rock has changed into felsite under the action of percolating moisture or even by atmospheric decomposition. In many rhyolites the felsite is original and represents an incipieitt crystallization of the vitreous material which took place before the rock was yet cold. The felsite in turn is Hable to change; it becomes a fine mosaic of quartz and alkaH felspar; and in this way a matrix of the third type, the microcrystalHne, may develop. This is proved by the occurrence of the remains of Spherulitic and perHtic structures in rocks which are no longer felsitic or glassy. Many microcrystalHne rhyoHtes have a ground-mass in which much felsitic matter occurs; but as this tends to recrystallize in course of time, the older rocks of this group show least of it. Whilst no quartz-bearing rhyoHtes are known to have been erupted in recent years, Lacroix proved that portions of the “ dome ” which rose as a great tower or column out of the crater of Mont Pelée after the eruption in 1906 contained small crystals of quartz in the ground-mass. The rock was an acid andesite, and it was ascribed by Lacroix to the action of steam retained in the rock under considerable pressure. The microcrystalHne ground-mass of rhyoHtes is never micrographie as in the porphyries (granophyres); on the other hand it is often micropoikilitic, consisting of small felspars, often sub-rectangular, embedded in Httle rounded or irregular plates of quartz.</p><p>The ground-mass of rhyoHtes is Hable to other changes, of which the most important are silicification, kaoHnization and Sericitization. Among the older rocks of this group it is the exception to find that secondary quartz has not been deposited in some parts of them. Often indeed the matrix is completely replaced by silica in the form of finely crystaHine quartz or chalcedony; and these rocks on analysis prove to contain over 90% of silica. In the recent rhyoHtes of Hungary, New Zealand, &amp;c., the deposit of coarse opal in portions of the rock is a very common phenomenon.</p><p>KaoHnization may be due to weathering, and the stony dulI appearance of the matrix of many microcrystalHne rhyoHtes is a consequence of the decomposed state of the felspar grains in them; it is even more typically developed by fumarole action, which replaces the felspars with soft, cloudy white products which belong to a mineral of the kaoHn group. Seri-citization, or the development of fine white mica after felspar, is usuaUy associated with shearing, and is commonest in the older rhyoHtes.</p><p>Vesicular structure is very common in rhyoHtes; in fact the pumiceous obsidians have this character in greater perfection than any other rocks (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Pumice);</hi>  but even the felso-rhyoHtes are very often vesicular. The cavities are usuaUy lined with opal and tridymite; in the older rocks they may be fiUed with agate and chalcedony. The “ mill-stone porphyries,” extensiveIy used in Germany for grinding corn, are porous rhyoHtes; the abundance of quartz makes them hard, and their rough surfaces render them pecuHarly suitable for this purpose. In some of them the cavities are partly secondary. These rocks are obtained in the Odenwald, Thur-ingerwald and Fichtelgebirge.</p><p>In. Britain a pale grey Tertiary rhyolite occurs at Tardree, Antrim (the only British rock containing tridymite), and in Skye. Felsitic'rhyolites occur among the Old Red rocks of Scotland (Pent-land Hills, Lome, &amp;c.), in Devonshire, and in large numbers in North Walcs<hi rend="sub">l</hi> The Carnarvonshire rhyoHtes are often much altered and silicified; many of them have a nodular structure which is very conspicuous on weathered surfaces. The spheroids may be two or three inches in diameter; some of them are built up of concentric shells. Rhyolites are also known from Fishguard, Malvern, Westmorland and Co. Waterford. One of the oldest volcanic rocks of Britain (pre-Cambrian, Uriconian) is the Spherulitic rhyolite of the Lea Rock near Wellington in Shropshire. It shows bright red spheralites in great numbers and is probably an obsidian completely aevitrified. Perlitic structure is also visible in it.</p><p>In other parts of Europe rhyolites have a fairly wide distribution though they are not very numerous. In Hungary (Hlinik, &amp;c.) there are many well-known examples of this class. They extend along the margin of the Carpathians and are found also in Siebenbürgen. In Italy they occur in the Eugancan Hills and in the Lipari Islands; the latter being the principal source of pumice at the present day. Rhyolites of Recent age occur in Iceland (Myvatn, &amp;c.), where they are characterized by the frequent absence of quartz, and the presence of much plagioclase and pyroxene. Some of these rocks have been called trachyte-obsidians, but they seem to be rhyolites which contain an exceptionally large amount of soda. The older rhyolites, which are generally called quartz-porphyries in Germany, are mostly of Permian or Carboniferous age and are numerous in the Vosges, Odenwald, Thuringerwald, &amp;c. They are often accompanied by basic rocks (melaphyres). Permian rhyolites occur also at Lugano in Italy. RhyoHtes are known also in Asia Minor and the Caucasus, in New Zealand, Colorado, Nevada and other parts of western North America. In the Yellowstone National Park there is a well-known cliff of obsidian which shows remarkably perfect columnar jointing. Some of the rhyolites of Nevada are exceedingly rich in porphyritic minerals, so that they appear at first sight to be. holocry Stalline rocks, since the ground-mass is scanty and inconspicuous. To this type the name nevadite has been given, but it is rare and local in its distribution.</p><p>in the island of Pantellaria, which lies to the south-west of Sicily, there are rocks of rhyolitic affinities which present so many unusual features that they have been designated pantellarites. They contain less silica and alumina and more alkalis and iron than do ordinary rhyolites. Their felspars are of the anorthoclase group, being rich in soda together with potash, and are very variable in crystalline development. Aeginne-augite and forms of soda-amphibole are also characteristic of these rocks: dark brown aenigmatite or cossyrite often occur in them. Quartz is not very plentiful ; other ingredients are olivine, arfvedsonite and tridymite. The ground-mass varies much, being sometimes quite vitreous, at other times a glass filled with swarms of microliths, while in certain pantellarites it is a microcrystalHne aggregate of quartz and alkali felspar. The absence of plagioclase and biotite are marked distinctions between these rocks and the rhyolites, together with the scarcity of quartz and the prevalence of soda-bearing pyroxenes and amphiboles.</p><p>Among the Palaeozoic volcanic rocks of Germany there is a group of lavas, the quartz-keratophyres, which are of acid composition and rich in alkali felspar. Their dominant alkali is soda: hence their felspars are albite and Cryptoperthite, not sanidine as in rhyolites. Quartz occurs sometimes as corroded phenocrysts, but is.often scarce even in the ground-mass. Porphyritic biotite or augite are very rare, but occur in the matrix along with felspars and quartz. Micropegmatite is not infrequent in these rocks, and they may be. silicified like the rhyolites. As quartz-keratophyres mostly occur in districts where there has been a good deal of folding, they are often crushed and more or less sericitized. They are best known from the Devonian rocks of Westphalia and the Harz, but are also found in. Queensland, and similar rocks have been described (as soda-f el sites) from Ireland. The rocks which they accompany are usually diabases and spilites.</p><p>The other group of rhyolitic rocks rich in alkali felspars and soda pyroxenes and amphiboles are the comendites. They are often porphyritic, with crystals of quartz, sanidine, microperthite or albite: the ground-mass is microcrystalHne or rarely micrographie, and often filled with spongy growths of aegirine and riebeckite. They are known from the recent eruptive districts of East Africa, from Sardinia and Texas, and very similar rocks occur as intrusive masses which may be grouped with the porphyries.</p><p>The following analyses show the composition of some of the principal types of rhyblites:—</p><table><row><cell cols="1" rows="2"><p>I.</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>S1O2</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>AhO<hi rend="sub">1</hi></p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>Fe<hi rend="sub">1</hi>O<hi rend="sub">1</hi></p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>FeO</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>CaO</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>MgO</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>K<hi rend="sub">1</hi>O</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>Na<hi rend="sub">1</hi>O</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>H<hi rend="sub">1</hi>O</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>76-34</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>13-22</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>1-93</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"/><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p><hi rend="smallcaps">i-8<hi rend="sub">5</hi></hi></p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>0-21</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>3*67</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>2-84</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>o-6i</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>IL</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>72-15</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>13-50</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>3-12</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="2"><p>n.f.</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>0*93</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>o-i6</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>4-54</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>4-20</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>0-85</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>III.</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>77-59</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>12-75</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>0-67</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>0-04</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>o-i6</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>3-99</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>2-56</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>1-54</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>IV.</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>67-48</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>9-70</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>7-42</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>2-21</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>1-45</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>0-77</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>2-94</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>7-21</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>0-96</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>V.</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>70-97</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>13-84</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>3-21</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>0-78</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>1-26</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>0-20</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>1-57-</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>6-27</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>0-74</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>VI.</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>74-76</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>ii-6o</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>3-50</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>0-19</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>0-07</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>o-i8</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>4*92</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>4-35</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>0-64</p></cell></row></table><lb/></body></text></TEI>
