It is a populous place, well built, and distinguished by the beauty of its streets. The district includes a considerable number of forts destined to defend the great northern barrier of the empire. It is seventeen miles north-west of Pekin.</p><p>SUETONIUS TRANQUILLUS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Caws,</hi> a Latin historian, was the son of Suetonius Lenis, who became a military tribune in the reign of the emperor Otho. The son is supposed to have been born about the beginning of the reign of Vespasian. Having betaken himself to the practice of the law, he appears to have acquired reputation as a pleader. He lived on terms of intimacy with the younger Pliny, who recommended him to Trajan as a very learned and upright man, and obtained for him the “jus trium liberorum.” Although he had a wife, he was without children ; and a participation of this privilege was of some importance to him in the exercise of his profession. After the death of this emperor, he was appointed secretary to Hadrian ; but he was dismissed from his office in consequence of his having manifested a want of due respect for the empress Sabina. After his retirement from public life, he had more leisure to devote himself to literary pursuits. Of that period of Roman history, his principal work, “ Vitæ duddecim Cæsarum,” contains the most curious and characteristic record which has been transmitted to our times. The picture which he exhibits is certainly a very foul one, but on that account is more likely to be true. His lives are not digested according to any order strictly chronological, but it is rather his plan to combine curious, interesting, and characteristic particulars, which serve to mark the progress of the different emperors, most of whom were a disgrace to human nature. Other two works of a slighter texture, “De illustribus Grammaticis liber,” and “ De claris Rhetoribus liber,” bear the name of Suetonius. To him are likewise ascribed very brief lives of Terence, Horace, Lucan, Persius, Juvenal, and the elder Pliny.</p><p>Suetonius was twice printed at Rome during the same year, 1470, and several other editions appeared at an early period. We pass over these, and hasten to mention the valuable editions of Casaubon, printed at Geneva in quarto in the years 1595 and 1615. His commentary abounds with recondite learning. Another elaborate edition was published by Grævins, Hag. Com. 1672, 4to. It was reprinted at the same place in 1691, and at Utrecht in 1703. This learned editor was soon succeeded by Pitiscus, Traj. ad Ren. 1690, 2 tom. 8vo. Leovard. 1714, 2 tom. 4to. But an edition still more elaborate was produced by the indefatigable Burman, Amst. 1736, 2 tom. 4to. And after no long interval, he was followed by Oudendorp, Lugd. Bat. 1751, 2 tom. 8vo.</p><p>SUEVI, a common name of the people situated between the Elbe and the Vistula, distinguished otherwise by particular names.</p><p>SUEVUS, in <hi rend="italic">Ancient Geography,</hi> a river of Germany, thought to be the same with the Viadrus or Oder, emptying itself at three mouths into the Baltic, the middlemost of which is called <hi rend="italic">Swine</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Swene,</hi> which last comes near the name <hi rend="italic">Suevus.</hi></p><p><hi style="color:red; font-size: 14pt; font-weight:bold;" rend="ERROR">�</hi><note place="margin" type="conversion" resp="#teitodocx"><hi rend="docxError">unable to handle picture here, no embed or link</hi></note>the neighbouring Arabs, and the shipping in the harbour. Suez is one of the few harbours in the Red Sea where ships can be repaired. Although the port is now little frequented, the trade in coffee and India goods still passes this way to Cairo.The isthmus of Suez is a low-lying land, composed of shell limestone rock, mixed with strata of siliceous limestone, and partly covered with sands or with saline marshes. In several places the solid strata are with difficulty perceived by their slight undulations ; in the northern part in particular there is a vast plain, varied only by sand-hills. To the east, the south-east, and the south-west, the mountain-chains of Arabia Petræa and of Egypt skirt at a distance the table-land of the isthmus, which is terminated at the Red Sea. The lake Birket-el-Ballah adjoining Lake Men- zaleh, Temsah or Crocodile Lake, and the almost dry basin of the Bitter Lakes, form from north to south a series of depressions, interrupted only by stripes of low land. The breadth of the isthmus, in a straight line from the mouth of Tineh on the Mediterranean to the northern point of the Gulf of Suez, is 878,844 feet, or nearly seventy-two miles.The question whether or not the Isthmus of Suez has always existed, has given rise to much discussion among the learned ; some maintaining that this neck of land was formerly covered by the sea, and that Africa was an island ; others that it must formerly have been much narrower than it is now ; and others that it has undergone little or no change. This latter hypothesis is defended by D'Anville, in opposition to the opinions of Gossellin and Rosière, whose arguments are in favour of the contraction of the gulf.The surface of the isthmus generally declines from the shores of the Red Sea towards those of the Mediterranean ; and the level of the latter is thirty feet lower than that of the Gulf of Suez. There is a similar descent towards the Delta and the bed of the river Nile ; the level of the water of the Nile at Cairo, w hen at its lowest, being about nine feet lower than the surface of the gulf at low water. But the Nile rising sixteen cubits by the Nilometer, is nine feet higher than the Red Sea at high water, and fourteen higher than the same sea at low water. Besides these leading inclinations of the surface, there is a particular one in the middle of the isthmus. The deep basin called the Bitter Lakes is more than fifty-four feet lower than the level of the Red Sea, the waters of which would enter and fill it if they were not prevented by a little sandy isthmus about three feet above the level of the sea.From this it follows that the Red Sea never could have occupied the basin of the Bitter Lakes in a constant manner, because its waters, if raised sufficiently high to form such a communication, would have found no barrier to the north of that basin : they would have flowed all the way to the Nile by the Ras-el-Ooadi, and to the Mediterranean by the Ras-el-Mayah. The two seas thus brought into contact would have reached a common level, and the strait would have become permanent.But if a natural communication between the two seas has never existed within the periods of human record, the traces and remains of a canal have been ascertained with satisfactory precision. From Balbeis, on the old Pelusiac branch of the Nile, now the Canal of Menedji, this canal reaches to Ablaseh, the ancient Thou. There it enters the narrow valley of Arabes-Tommylat, the level of which is thirty-three feet lower than that of the Red Sea. It passes on to Abookes- heyd, which is supposed to be the old Heroopolis. The basin of the Bitter Lakes might have been filled at pleasure from the waters of the Nile.Beyond this basin the traces of the canal re-appear in the isthmus which separates the lakes from the Red Sea, and show that the canal was continued the whole way. According to Strabo, this canal was constructed by the Ptolemies ; and the Arabian writers assert that it was openedSUEZ, a seaport situated at the northern extremity of the gulf of the same name. It is so incommodious that small boats can with difficulty land at the quay even at high water The town is in a ruinous state, walled on the west and southwest ; but the wall is rapidly falling to decay. The population only consists of about a dozen agents, who receive goods from the ports of the Red Sea, and forward them to their correspondents at Cairo, together with some shopkeepers, who deal chiefly in provisions. Neither merchants nor artisans live in it. The pacha keeps a garrison here of about fifty horsemen, with an officer, who commands the town,</p></body></text></TEI>
