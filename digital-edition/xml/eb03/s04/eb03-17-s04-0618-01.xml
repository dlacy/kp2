                <p><label>SPA</label>, a town of Germany, in the circle of Weſtphaha and biſhopric
                    of Liege, famous for its mineral waters, lies in E. Long. 5. 50. N. Lat. 50. 30.
                    about 21 miles ſouth-eaſt from Liege, and 7 ſouth-weſt from Lomburg. It is
                    ſituated at one end of a deep valley oh the banks of a ſmall rivulet, and is
                    ſurrounded on all ſides by high mountains. The ſides of theſe mountains next to
                    Spa are rude and uncultivated, preſenting a rugged appearance as if ſhattered by
                    the convulſions of earthquakes ; but as they are ſtrewed with tall oaks and
                    abundance of ſhrubs, the country around forms a wild, romantic, and beautiful
                    landſcape. The acceſs to the town is very beautiful. The road winds over the
                    mountains till it deſcends to their bottom, when it runs along a ſmooth valley
                    for a mile or a mile and a hall.</p>
                <p>The town conſiſts of four ſtreets in form of a croſs, and contains about 400
                    inhabitants. Spa has no wealth to boaſt of. If can ſcarcely furniſh the
                    neceſſaries of life to its own inhabitants during the winter, and almoſt all the
                    luxuries which are requiſite for the great concourſe of affluent viſitors during
                    the ſummer are carried from Liege by women. Its only ſource of wealth is its
                    mineral waters. No ſooner does the warm ſeaſon commence, than crowds of
                    valetudinarians arrive, as well as many other perſons who are attracted ſolely
                    by the love of amuſement, and ſome from leſs honourable motives. The
                    inhabitants, who ſpend ſeven or eight months of the year without seeing the face
                    of a ſtranger, wait for the return of this period with impatience. The welcome
                    sound of the carriages brings multitudes from the town, either to gratify their
                    curioſity, or to offer their ſervices in the hopes of ſecuring your employment
                    while you remain at Spa. Immediately after your arrival your name and
                    deſignation is added to the printed list of the annual viſitors ; for which you
                    pay a ſtated ſum to the bookſeller, who has a patent for this purpoſe from the
                    prince biſhop of Liege. This list not only enables one to know at a glance
                    whether any friends or acquaintance are reſiding there, but alſo to diſtinguiſh
                    perſons of rank and faſhion from adventurers, who ſeldom have the effrontery to
                    inſert their names.</p>
                <p>There are two different ways of accommodating the viſitors at Spa with lodging
                    and neceſſaries. People may either lodge at an hotel, where every thing is
                    furniſhed them in a ſplendid and expenſive ſtyle ; or they</p>
                <p>may take up their reſidence in private lodgings, from which they may ſend for
                    proviſions to a cook’s shop.</p>
                <p>Among the people who viſit Spa, there are many perſons of the firſt rank and
                    faſhion in Europe. Perhaps indeed there is no place in Europe to which so many
                    kings and princes resort ; but it is alſo viſited by many ſelf-created nobility,
                    who, under the titles of counts, barons, marquiſes, and knights, contrive by
                    their addreſs and artifices, to prey upon the rich and unexperienced.</p>
                <p>T'he manners eſtabliſhed at Spa are conducive both to health and amuſement. Every
                    body riſes early in the morning, at six o’clock or before it, when a great many
                    horſes ſtand ready ſaddled for thoſe who chooſe to drink the Sauveniere or
                    Geronſtere waters at a little diſtance from Spa. After this healthy exerciſe a
                    part of the company generally breakfaſt together at Vaux- hall, a magnificent
                    and ſpacious building. At this place a number of card-tables are opened every
                    forenoon, round which many persons assemble and play for stakes to a very
                    conſiderable amount. A ball too is generally held once a week at Vauxhall,
                    beſides two balls at the aſſembly rooms near the Pouhon in the middle of the
                    town.</p>
                <p>The moſt remarkable waters at Spa are, 1. The Pou- hon, ſituated in the middle of
                    the town ; 2. The Sauveniere, a mile and a half eaſt from it ; 3. Groiſheck,
                    near to the Sauveniere; 4. Tonnelet, ſituated a little to the left of the road
                    which leads to the Sauveniere ; 5. Geronſtere, two miles ſouth from Spa; 6. War-
                    troz, near to the Tonnelet; 7. Sarts or Niveſet, in the diſtrict of Sarts ; 8.
                    Chevron or Bru, in the principality of Slavelot ; 9. Couve; 10. Beverſe; 11.
                    Sige; 12. Geremont. Theſe four laſt are near Malmedy.</p>
                <p>Dr Brownrigg was the firſt perſon who diſcovered that fixed air, or, as it is now
                    generally called, <hi rend="italic">carbonic acid gas,</hi> forms a principal
                    ingredient in the compoſition of the Spa waters, and actually ſeparated a
                    quantity of this elaſtic fluid, by expoſing it to different degrees of heat from
                    110⁰ to 170⁰ of Fahrenheit. From 20 ounces 7 drams and 14 grains apothecaries
                    weight of the Pouhon water, he obtained 8 ounces 2 drams and 50 grains. Since
                    June 1765, when Dr Brownrigg read a paper on this ſubject before thc Royal
                    Society of London, the waters of Spa have been often analyſed, but perhaps by
                    none with more accuracy than by Dr Aſh, who publiſhed a book on the chemical and
                    medicinal properties of theſe waters in 1788. We ſhall preſent his analyſis of
                    the five principal ſprings in the following tables</p>

                <p>The Pouhon ſpring riſes from the hill to the north oſ Spa, which conſiſts of
                    argillaceous ſchiſtus and serrugineous ſlate. The other fountains riſe from the
                    ſurrounding hills to the ſouth-eaſt, ſouth, west, and north-west of the town;
                    and this ridge of mountains is formed of calcareous earths mixed with ſiliceous
                    ſubſtances. The ſurface of the mountains is covered with woods, interſperſed
                    with large boggy ſwamps filled with mud and water. The Pouhon is conſidered as
                    the principal ſpring at Spa, being impregnated with a greater quantity of iron
                    than any of the reſt, and containing more fixed air than any except the
                    Tonnelet. It is from this ſpring that the Spa water for exportation is bottled ;
                    for which the demand is ſo great, that, according to the beſt information which
                    Mr Thickneſſe could obtain, the quantity exported amounts to 200,000 or 250,000
                    bottles annually.<note anchored="true" n="1" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                            ><p>[mu] Thicknesses Journey through the Pais Bas.</p></note> This
                    exported water is inferior in its virtue to that which is drunk on the ſpot ;
                    for the veſſels into which it is collected are injudiciouſly expoſed to the ſun,
                    rain, wind, and duſt, for ſeveral hours before they are corked, by which means a
                    considerable part of its volatile ingredients muſt be evaporated ; for it has
                    been found by experiment, that by expoſing it to a gentle heat, air-bubbles
                    aſcend in great numbers. It is in its greateſt perfection when collected in cold
                    dry weather ; it is then pellucid, colourleſs, and without ſmell, and almoſt as
                    light as diſtilled water. It varies in its heat from 52⁰ or 53⁰ to 67⁰ of
                    Fahrenheit’s thermometer.</p>
                <p>The Geronſtere is a much weaker chalybeate water than the Pouhon ; and as it is
                    exceedingly nauſeous, and taſtes and ſmells like rotten eggs, it certainly
                    contains ſome hepatic gas. This is a circumſtance which Dr Aſh ſeems not to have
                    attended to ſufficiently. The Sauveniere water alſo, when newly taken from the
                    well, ſmells a little of ſulphur. The Groiſheck contains more alkali, and almoſt
                    as much gas as the Pouhon, and has been celebrated for its good effects in the
                    caſe of calculous concretions. The Tonnelet contains more gas than any of the
                    reſt. So ſmall is the quantity of any fossil body held in ſuſpenſion by the
                    aerial acid in it, and ſo volatile is the gas, that it begins to paſs off very
                    rapidly the moment it is taken out of the well, and in a ſhort time is entirely
                    gone. Dr Aſh informs us, that in the neighbourhood of this well, the cellars, on
                    any approaching change of weather, are found to contain much fixed air ; and the
                    beſt prognoſtic which they have of rain is the aversion which cats ſhow to be
                    carried into theſe cellars.</p>
                <p>The Spa waters are diuretic, and ſometimes purgative. They exhilarate the ſpirits
                    with an influence much more benign than wine or ſpirituous liquors, and they are
                    more cooling, and allay thirſt more effectually than common water. They are
                    found beneficial in caſes of weakneſs and relaxation, either partial or
                    univerſal ; in nervous diſorders ; in obſtructions of the liver and ſpleen ; in
                    caſes where the blood is too thin and putreſcent ; in caſes of exceſſive
                    diſcharges proceeding from weakneſs ; in the gravel and ſtone ; and in moſt
                    caſes where a ſtrengthening remedy is wanted. But they are hurtful in confirmed
                    obſtructions attended with fever, where there is no free outlet to the matter,
                    as in ulcerations of the lungs. They are alſo injurious to bilious and plethoric
                    conſtitutions, when uſed before the body is cooled by proper evacuations.</p>
