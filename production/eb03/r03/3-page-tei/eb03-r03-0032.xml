The Scots, under their generals Cummin and Fraſer, had reſolved to furpriſe Segrave ; with which view they began their march on the night of Saturday preceding the firſt Sunday of Lent, and reached the Engliſh army by break of day. Segrave, however, had time to have fallen back upon the other d!vifion which lay behind him ; but, either deſpiſing his enemies too much, or thinking that he would be diſho· noured by a retreat, he encountered the Scots ; the conſequence of which was, that he himſelf was made priſoner, and all his men either killed or taken, except i nch as fled to the other diviſion. As in this routed diviſion there had been no fewer than 300 knights, each of whom brought at leaſt five horſemen into the field, great part of the Scots inſantiy quickly furniſhed themſelves with their horſes ; but, as they were dividing the ſpoils, another diviſion oſ the Engliſh appeared, and the Scots were obliged to fight them alſo. The Engliſh, after a bloody engagement, were defeated a ſecond time; which was no ſooner done, than the third and moſt powerful diviſion made its appearance. The Scots were now quite exhauſted ; and, pleading the exceſſive labours they had already undergone, earneſtly requeſted their geperals to allow them to retreat while it was yet ip their power. Their two generals, who perhaps knew that to be impracticable, reminded them of the cauſe for which they were fighting, the tyranny of the Engliſh, &amp;c. and by theſe arguments prevailed upon them to fight a third time ; though, previous to the engagement, they were reduced to the cruel neceſſitv of putting all the common ſoldiers whom they had made pri-ſoners to the ſword. The victory of the Scots at this time was leſs complete than the other two had been ; ſince they could not prevent the retreat of the Engliſh to Edinburgh, nor Segrave from being reſcued from bis captivity.</p><p>ROSMARINUS, rosemary, in botany: A genus of the monogynia order, belonging to the diandria claſs of plants, and in the natural method ranking under the 42d order, <hi rend="italic">Pertiιillatee.</hi>  The corolla is unequal, with its upper lip bipartite ; the filaments are long, curved, and ſimple, each having a ſmall dent. There are two ſpecies, the anguſtifolia anti latifolia, or narrow and broad leaved roſemary ; of which the ſecond has larger flowers and a ſtronger ſcent than the other. There are two varieties ; one oſ the ſirſt fort with ſtriped leaves, called the <hi rend="italic">ſilver roſemary ;</hi>  and the other with yellow, whence it is called the <hi rend="italic">goldſlriped roſematy.</hi>  Theſe plants grow naturally in the ſouthern parts of France, Spain, and Italy ; where, upon dry rocky ſoils near the ſea, they thrive prodigiouſly, and perfume the air in ſuch a manner as to be ſmelt at a great diſtance from the land.— However, they are hardy enough to bear the cold of our ordinary winters, provided they be planted upon a poor, dry, gravelly ſoil, on which they will endure the cold much better than in a richer ground, where, growing more vigorouſly in ſummer, they are more apt to be injured by froſt in winter ; nor wfill they have ſuch a ſtrong aromatic ſcent as thoſe on a dry and barren ſoil. They are to be propagated either by flips or cuttings.</p><p>Roſemary has a fragrant ſmell, and a warm pungent bitteriſh taſte, approaching to thoſe of lavender : the leaves and tender tops are ſtrongeſt ; next to thoſe, the cup of the flower ; the flowers themſelves are conhder-ably the weakeſt, but moſt pleaſant. Aqueous liquors extract great ſliare of the virtues-of roſemary leaves by infuſion, and elevate them in eiiſtillation ; along with· the water ariſes a conſiderable quantity of eſſential oil, of an agreeable ſtrong penetrating ſmell. Pure ſpirit extracts in great perfection the whole aromatic flavour of the roſemary, and elevates very little of it in diſtillation ; hence the reſinous maſs, left upon extracting the ſpirit, proves an elegant aromatic, very rich in the peculiar qualities of the plant. The flowers of roſemary' give over great part of their flavour in diſtillation with pure ſpirit ; by watery liquors, their fragrance is much injured ; by beating, deſtroyed.</p><p>ROSS, in Herefordſhire, in England, 119 miles; from London, is a fine old town, with a good trade, on the river Wye. It was made a free borough by’ Henry III. It is a populous place, famous ior cyder,, anti was noted in Camden’s time for a manufacture of iron-wares. There are in it two charity-ſchools, which lately have been enriched by a legacy of 200 1. <hi rend="italic">per annum.</hi>  from Mr Scott, in Dec. 1786, a ſecond <hi rend="italic">Man oſ Ro∕s.</hi>  And its market and fairs are well ſtored with cattle and other provifions. At the well end of it there is a fine broad cauſeway, conſtructed by Mr John Kyrle, the celebrated <hi rend="italic">Man of R∩fs,</hi>  who allô raiſed the ſpire upward of 100 feet, and incloſed a piece of ground with a ſtone wall, and funk a reſervoir in its centre, for-the uſe of the inhabitants of the town. He died in x714, aged 90, with the bleſſing of all who knew him, both rich and poor. There cannot be a pleaſanter country than the banks of the Wye, between this town and Monmouth. W. Long. 2. 25, N.

Cromarty lies on the other fide of the Murray-Frith, to the northward of In-» verneſs, extending but 12 miles in length, bounded on the ſouth and eaſt by part of Roſs and the Frith of Murray, and by the Frith of Cromarty on the north&gt; 'Γhe flιire of Roſs takes up the whole breadth of the iſland ; and being much indented with bays and inlets from both ſeas, appears of a very irregular form.— Theſe bays afford ſafe harbours for ſhipping, eſpecially that of Cromarty, which is capacious enough to contain all the fleets of Europe, being land-locked on every fide, and is in all reſpects one of the beſt harbours in the known world. The Frith of Tayne, on the eaſt fide of the ſhire, runs up 25 miles ſrom the ſea, as far as the Cape Tarbat, dividing Roſs from Sutherland : it is about ſeven miles broad at the mouth, but, on account of quick∙fands, unſafe for navigation. The country of Roſs is encumbered with huge mountains,, on which the ſnow lies for the greateſt part of the year; theſe, however, yield good pafture ; but on the eaſtern fide, next the German ocean, the country admits of agriculture, and produces good crops of corn. The valleys are fertilized by ſeveral rivers, among which we reckon the Okcl, the Charron, and the Braan ; be. ſides a number of freſh-water lakes, which indeed ar⅛⅜</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
