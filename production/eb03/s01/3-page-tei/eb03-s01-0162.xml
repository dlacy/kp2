The biſhop of Norwich ſuggeſted this ſalvo: and this was the reaſon why Alexander would not perform the homage in perſon, but left it to be performed by Robert Bruce earl of Carric; Alexander ſtanding by, and expreſsly declaring, that it was only paid for the lands he held in England. —No acts of hoſtility, however, took place during the lifetime of Alexander, who was killed on the 19th of March 1285, in the 45th year of his age, by his horſe ruſhing down the black rock near Kinghorn as he was hunting.</p><p>Both before and after the death of Alexander, the great ſubjects of Scotland ſeemed to have been ſenſible of Edward’s ambitious deſigns. On the marriage of Margaret with Eric prince of Norway, the ſtates of Scotland paſſed an act obliging themſelves to receive her and her heirs as queen and ſovereigns of Scotland. Edward at that time was in no condition to oppoſe this meaſure, in which the Scots were unanimous; and therefore contented himſelf with forming factions among the leading men of the country. Under pretence of reſuming the croſs, he renewed his intrigues at the court of Rome, and demanded leave from the pope to collect the tenths in Scotland; but his holineſs replied, that he could make no ſuch grant without the conſent of the government of Scotland. On the death of Margaret queen of Norway, her daughter, in conſequence of the act above-mentioned, was recognized by the ſtates as queen of Scotland. As ſhe was then but two years old, they came to a reſolution of excluding from all ſhare in the government, not only Edward I. but their queen’s father; and they accordingly eſtabliſhed a regency from among their own number, conſiſting of the ſix following noblemen; viz. Robert Wiſhart biſhop of Glaſgow, Sir James Cummin of Badenoch, ſenior, James lord high ſteward of Scotland, who were to have the ſuperintendency of all that part of Scotland which lay to the ſouth of the Forth; William Fraſer biſhop of St. Andrews, Duncan M'Duff earl of Fife, and Alexander Cummin earl of Buchan, who were to have the direction of all affairs to the north of the fame river. With theſe arrangements Eric was exceedingly diſpleaſed, as conſidering himſelf as the only rightful guardian of his own child. He therefore cultivated a good correſpondence with Edward, from whom he had received conſiderable pecuniary favours; and perceiving that the ſtates of Scotland were unanimous in excluding all foreigners from the management of their concerns, he fell in with the views of the king of England, and named commiſſioners to treat with thoſe of Edward upon the Scots affairs. Theſe negociations terminated in a treaty of marriage between the queen of Scotland and Edward prince of Wales, young as they both were. This alarmed the ſtates of Scotland, who reſolved not to ſuffer their queen to be diſpoſed of without their conſent. It was therefore agreed by the commiſſioners on both ſides, to acquaint them with the reſult of their conferences, and to demand that a deputation ſhould be ſent up for fettling the regency of Scotland, or, in other words, for putting the ſovereign power into the hands of the two kings. As the two parties, however, were within the prohibited degrees of conſanguinity, being firſt couſins, a diſpenſation was applied for to Pope Boniface, who granted it on condition that the peers of Scotland conſented to the match.</p><p>Though the Scots nobility were very much againſt this match, they could not refuſe their conſent to it when propoſed by the father and grand-uncle of their young queen. They therefore appointed the biſhops of St Andrew’s and Glaſgow, with Robert Bruce lord of Annandale, and John Cummin, to attend as their deputies, but with a ſalvo to all the liberties and honours of the realm of Scotland; to which Edward agreed. Theſe: deputies met at Saliſhury with thoſe of England and Norway; and it was at laſt agreed, 1. That the young queen ſhould be ſent from Norway (free of all marriage-engagements) into England or Scotland. 2. That if the queen came to England, ſhe ſhould be at liberty to repair to Scotland as ſoon as the diſtractions of that kingdom ſhould be ſettled; that ſhe ſhould, on her arrival in her own dominions, be free of all matrimonial contracts but that the Scots ſhould engage not to diſpoſe of her in marriage without her father or Edward’s conſent. 3. The Scots deputies promiſed to give ſuch ſecurity as the Norwegian commiſſioners ſhould require, that the tranquillity of the nation ſhould be ſettled before her arrival. 4. That the commiſſioners of Scotland and Norway, joined with  commiſſioners from England, ſhould remove ſuch regents and officers of ſtate in Scotland as ſhould be ſuſpected of diſaffection, and place others in their ſtead. If the Scots and Norwegian commiſſioners ſhould diſagree on that or any other head relating to the government of Scotland, the deciſion was to be left to the arbitration of Engliſh commiſſioners.</p><p>The party of Edward was now ſo ſtrong in Scotland, that no oppoſition was made to the late agreement, in a parliament held at Brechin to deliberate upon the ſettlement of the kingdom. It is uncertain whether he communicated in form to the Scottiſh parliament the pope’s diſpenſation for the marriage: but moſt probably he did not; as, in a letter written to him by the ſtates of Scotland, they mention this as a matter they heard by report. On the whole, however, they highly approved of the marriage, upon certain conditions to which Edward was previouſly to agree; but the latter, without waiting to perform any conditions, immediately ſent for the young queen from Norway. This exceedingly diſpleaſed Eric, who was by no means inclined to put his daughter into the hands of a prince whoſe ſincerity he ſuſpected, and therefore ſhifted off the departure of the princeſs till he ſhould hear farther from Scotland. Edward, alarmed at this, had again recourſe to negociation; and ten articles were at laſt drawn up, in which the Scots took all imaginable precautions for the ſafety and independency of their country. Theſe articles were ratified by Edward on the 28th of Auguſt 1289; yet, even after the affair of the marriage was fully fettled, he loſt no time in procuring as ſtrong a party as he could. At the head of theſe were the biſhop of St Andrew’s and John Baliol. That prelate, while he was in England, was highly careſſed by Edward, from whom he had great expectations of preferment; and Baliol, having great eſtates in England, conſidered the latter as his ſovereign.
