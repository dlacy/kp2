<p><span class="font1">(Louvre), must for ever remain amongst the masterpieces of French art. Rigaud, although the great successes to&nbsp;which he owed his fame were won without exception in&nbsp;portrait painting, persisted in pressing the Academy to&nbsp;admit him as an historical painter. This delayed his&nbsp;reception, and it was not until January 2, 1700, that he&nbsp;succeeded in obtaining his desire. He presented as his&nbsp;diploma works a St Andrew (Louvre) and the portrait of&nbsp;Desjardins already mentioned, exhibited at the salon of&nbsp;1704, and fdled in turn all the various posts of academical&nbsp;distinction. Having attained a professional position of&nbsp;unsurpassed eminence, Rigaud died at the age of eighty-four on 27th December 1743, having never recovered from&nbsp;the shock of losing his wife in the year previous. He had&nbsp;many pupils, and his numerous works had the good fortune&nbsp;to be reproduced by the greatest of French engravers —&nbsp;Edelinck, Drevet, Wille, Audran, and others.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RIGHTS, Bill of. On the 13th February 1688-89 the Declaration of Right was delivered by the Lords and&nbsp;Commons to the prince and princess of Orange. In&nbsp;October 1689 the rights claimed by the declaration were&nbsp;enacted with some alterations by the Bill of Rights, 1 Will,&nbsp;and M., sess. 2, c. 2, next to Magna Charta the greatest&nbsp;landmark in the constitutional history of England and the&nbsp;nearest approach to the written constitutions of other&nbsp;countries. The Act (the full name of which is “ An Act&nbsp;declaring the Rights and Liberties of the Subject, and&nbsp;settling the Succession of the Crown ”), after reciting the&nbsp;unconstitutional proceedings of James II., the abdication&nbsp;of that king, the consequent vacancy of the crown, and&nbsp;the summons of the convention parliament, declared, on&nbsp;the part of the Lords and Commons, “ for the vindicating&nbsp;and asserting their ancient rights and liberties—</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ 1. That the pretended power of suspending of laws or the execution of laws by regal authority without consent of parliament is illegal. 2. That the pretended power of dispensing with laws or the execution of laws by regal authority, as it hath been assumed and exercised of late, is illegal. 3. That the commission for erecting the&nbsp;late court of commissioners for ecclesiastical causes, and all other&nbsp;commissions and courts of like nature, are illegal and pernicious.&nbsp;4. That levying money for or to the use of the crown, by pretence&nbsp;of prerogative, without grant of parliament, for longer time or in&nbsp;other manner than the same is or shall be granted, is illegal. 5.&nbsp;That it is the right of the subjects to petition the king, and all&nbsp;commitments and prosecutions for such petitioning are illegal. 6.&nbsp;That the raising or keeping a standing army within the kingdom in&nbsp;time of peace, unless it be with consent of parliament, is against&nbsp;law. 7. That the subjects which are Protestants may have arms&nbsp;for their defence suitable to their conditions, and as allowed by law.&nbsp;8. That elections of members of parliament ought to be free. 9.&nbsp;That the freedom of speech, and debates or proceedings in parliament, ought not to be impeached or questioned in any court or&nbsp;place out of parliament. 10. That excessive bail ought not to be&nbsp;required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted. 11. That jurors ought to be duly impanelled and&nbsp;returned, and j urors which pass upon men in trials for high treason&nbsp;ought to be freeholders. 12. That all grants and promises of fines&nbsp;and forfeitures of particular persons before conviction are illegal&nbsp;and void. 13. And that for redress of all grievances, and for the&nbsp;amending, strengthening, and preserving of the laws, parliament&nbsp;ought to be held frequently. And they do claim, demand, and&nbsp;insist upon all and singular the premises, as their undoubted rights&nbsp;and liberties. ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The further provisions of the Act were concerned with the settlement of the crown upon the prince and princess&nbsp;of Orange, with the exception of § 12, which negatived the&nbsp;right of dispensation by </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">non obstante</span><span class="font1"> to or of any statute&nbsp;or any part thereof, unless a dispensation be allowed in the&nbsp;statute itself or by bill or bills to be passed during the then&nbsp;session of parliament. An example of an Act giving a&nbsp;dispensing power is 7 &amp; 8 Will. III., c. 37, by which the&nbsp;crown is empowered to grant licences to hold in mortmain&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">non obstante</span><span class="font1"> the Mortmain Acts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is to be noticed that the Declaration of Right and the Bill of Rights introduced no new principle into the English&nbsp;constitution. In the words of Lord Macaulay, “ the&nbsp;Declaration of Right, though it made nothing law which&nbsp;had not been law before, contained the germ of every good&nbsp;law which has been passed during more than a century and&nbsp;a half, of every good law which may hereafter in the course&nbsp;of ages be found necessary to promote the public weal, and&nbsp;to satisfy the demands of public opinion” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(History of&nbsp;England,</span><span class="font1"> vol. ii. p. 396). In the United States, the main&nbsp;provisions of the Bill of Rights, so far as they are applicable,&nbsp;have been adopted both in the constitution of the United&nbsp;States and in the State constitutions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RIMINI. The city of Rimini is bounded on three sides by water. It faces the Adriatic to the north, has&nbsp;the torrent Aprusa, now called Ausa, on the east, and&nbsp;has the river Marecchia, the Arimnum of the ancients&nbsp;and later known as the Ariminum, on the west. It stands&nbsp;in a fertile plain, which on the southern side soon swells&nbsp;into pleasant slopes backed by the jagged peaks of the&nbsp;Umbrian Apennines. The foremost foothill of the range is&nbsp;the steep crag of Mons Titanus crowned by the towers of&nbsp;San Marino. This oldest and smallest of republics commands a prospect of almost unrivalled beauty over hill and&nbsp;plain—to Ravenna on one side, Pesaro on the other, the&nbsp;mountains of Montefeltro, Rimini and its rivers, and across&nbsp;the Adriatic to the Dalmatian coast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Of the foundation of Rimini nothing certain is known. It was first inhabited by the Umbrians, then by the&nbsp;Etruscans for many centuries. In the 4th century B.c. it&nbsp;was invaded by the Senones, who advanced as far as&nbsp;Sinigaglia. Brenn us established himself in Rimini, and&nbsp;marched thence upon Rome, which he destroyed by fire&nbsp;in 390 B.c. After more than a century of dominion the&nbsp;Senones were expelled by the Romans, who founded a&nbsp;military colony in Rimini and made it the seat of the&nbsp;prætor governing the province designated as Ariminumιor&nbsp;Gallia Togata. Owing to its position, Rimini rose to&nbsp;increased importance under its new masters. The Romans&nbsp;reopened the mint formerly established by the Gauls,&nbsp;which had issued the “ æs grave,” the heaviest Italic coin&nbsp;that has been preserved. Rimini was the starting point&nbsp;of the Flaminian Way leading to Rome, and of the Emilian&nbsp;Way to Piacenza. Later, 134 b.c., the Popilian Way leading as far as Venice was made. In 82 b.c. Rimini was&nbsp;withdrawn from the province of Gaul and included in&nbsp;Italy, of which the frontier was now extended from the&nbsp;Esino to the Rubicon, about ten miles from Rimini near&nbsp;Cesena. This added to the city’s importance. We find&nbsp;continual mention of it in the wars of Marius and Sulla,&nbsp;and by the latter it was afterwards sacked. In 49 b.c.&nbsp;Julius Cæsar crossed the Rubicon with the 13th legion,&nbsp;entered Rimini, and harangued his troops in the great&nbsp;square that still bears his name. A pillar marks the&nbsp;spot on which, according to tradition, he delivered his&nbsp;address.</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> From Rimini, after having assembled the tribunes of the people and summoned the other legions, he&nbsp;went forth on the great expedition that was to lead to the&nbsp;battle of Pharsalia and ultimately to the foundation of the&nbsp;empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rimini was highly favoured under Augustus. That emperor restored the Flaminian Way, and the senate&nbsp;decreed the erection in his honour of the famous arch that&nbsp;is still one of the grandest of ancient monuments. It&nbsp;seems that this arch was originally crowned by a statue&nbsp;of Augustus mounted on a triumphal car </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(quadriga).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">@@@<sup>1</sup> A stone originally stood there, mentioned by 15th-century writers as <sup>t</sup> ‘ the big stone </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">{petτoηe),</span><span class="font0"> on which he (Cæsar) stood to make his&nbsp;speech.” But this stone, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">vetustate cοllapsum</span><span class="font0"> was replaced in 1555&nbsp;by the existing column.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
