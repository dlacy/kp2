The adults with a single large compressed incisor above on each side, and occasionally a small lateral one ; below, a very small median, and a very large, procumbent, pointed lateral incisor. Nasal bones pointed in front. A single nasal horn. Skin very thick, and raised into strong, definitely arranged ridges or folds.</p><p>There are two well-marked species of one-horned rhinoceroses. (1) The Indian Rhinoceros, <hi rend="italic">R. uηicomis</hi>  of Lin-næus,@@<hi rend="sup">1</hi>  the largest and best known, from being the most frequently exhibited alive in England, is at present only</p><lb/><p>met with in a wild state in the terai region of Nepal and Bhutan, and in the upper valley of the Brahmaputra or province of Assam, though it formerly had a wider range.</p><lb/><p>Roman shows, was of this species. It was sent from India to Emmanuel, king of Portugal, in 1513 ; and from a sketch of it, taken in Lisbon, Albert Dürer composed his celebrated but rather fanciful engraving, which was reproduced in so many old books on natural history. (2) The Javan Rhinoceros, <hi rend="italic">R. sondaicus,</hi>  Cuvier, is distinguished by smaller size, special characters of the teeth and skull, and different arrangement of the plications of the skin (as seen in the figures) ; the horn in the female appears to be very little developed, if not altogether absent. This has a more extensive geographical range, being found in the Bengal Sunderbans near Calcutta, Burmah, the Malay Peninsula, Java, Sumatra, and probably Borneo.</p><p>II.    <hi rend="italic">Ceratorhiηus.</hi>  The adults with a moderate-sized compressed incisor above, and a laterally placed, pointed, procumbent incisor below, which is sometimes lost in old animals. Nasal bones narrow and pointed anteriorly. A well-developed nasal, and a small frontal horn separated by an interval. The skin thrown into folds, but these not so strongly marked as in the former section. The smallest living member of the family, the Sumatran Rhiroceros, <hi rend="italic">R. sumatreηsis,</hi>  Cuv., belongs to this group. Its geographical range is nearly the same as that of the Javan species, though not extending into Bengal ; but it has been found in Assam, Chittagong, Burmah, the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, and Borneo. It is possible that more than one species have been confounded under this designation, as two animals now living in the London Zoological Gardens present considerable differences of form and colour. One of them, from Chittagong, has been named by Sclater <hi rend="italic">R. lasiotis,</hi>  the Hairy-Eared Rhinoceros, but until an opportunity is afforded for anatomical examination, it is difficult to pronounce upon the value of the distinction.</p><p>III.    <hi rend="italic">Atelodus.</hi>  In the adults, the incisors are quite rudimentary or entirely wanting. Nasal bones thick, rounded and truncated in front. Well-developed anterior and posterior horns in close contact. Skin without any definite permanent folds.</p><p>The two well-marked existing species are peculiar to the African continent.</p><p>1. The common Two-Horned Rhinoceros, <hi rend="italic">R. bicomis, </hi>Linn., is the smaller of the two, with a pointed prehensile upper lip, and a narrow compressed deep symphysis of the</p><p>lower jaw. It ranges through the wooded and watered districts of Africa, from Abyssinia in the north to the Cape Colony, but its numbers are yearly diminishing, owing to</p><lb/><p>@@@<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Many authors use Cuvier’s name,<hi rend="italic">R. indicus,</hi>  in preference to this, on the ground that there are more than one species with one horn, forgetting that the name substituted is equally inconvenient, as more than one species live in India. The fact of a specific name being applicable to several members of a genus is no objection to its restriction to the first to which it was applied ; otherwise changes in old and well-received names would constantly have to be made in consequence of new discoveries.</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
