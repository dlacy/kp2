To deceive him ſtill farther, he wrote in the ſame ſtyle to the ſenate, gave him the title of <hi rend="italic">Caſar.,</hi>  and ordered money to be coined with his image. Theſe artifices ſerving to lull Albimιs into falſe ſecurity, Severus marched againſt Niger with all his forces. After ſome undeciſive conflicts, the laſt great battle that was fought between theſe extraordinary men was upon the plains of Iſſus, on the very ſpot where Alexander had formerly conquered Darius. Beſides the two great armies drawn up on the plain, the neighbouring mountains were covered with infinite numbers of people, who were merely led by curioſity to become ſpectators of an engagement that was to determine the empire of the world. Severus was conqueror ; and Niger’s head being ſtruck off by ſome ſoldiers of the conquering army, was inſultingly carried through the camp on the point of a lance.</p><p>This victory ſecured Severus in the poſſeſſion of the throne. However, the Parthians, Perſians, and ſome other neighbouring nations, took up arms, under a pretence of vindicating Niger’s cauſe. The emperor marched againſt them in perſon, had many engagements with them, and obtained ſuch ſignal victories over them, as enlarged the empire, and eſtabliſhed peace in the eaſt.</p><p>Niger being no more, Severus now turned his views againſt Albinus, whom he reſolved by every means to deſtroy. For this purpoſe he ſent aſſaſſins into Britain, under a pretence of bringing him letters, but in reality to diſpatch him. Albinus being appriſed of their deſigns, prevented their attempt by recurring to open force and proclaiming himſelf emperor. Nor was he without a powerful army to ſupport his pretenſions ; of which Severus being ſenſible, bent his whole force to oppoſe him. From the eaſt he continued his courſe acroſs the ſtraits of Byzantium, into the moſt weſtern parts of Europe, without intermiſſion. Albinus being informed of his approach, went over to meet him with his forces into Gaul ; ſo that the campaign on both ſides was carried on with great vigour. Fortune ſeemed for a while variable ; but at laſt a deciſive engagement came on, which was one of the moſt deſperate recorded in the Roman hiſtory. It laſted front morning till night, without any ſeeming advantage on either ſide ; at length the troops of Severus began to fly, and he himſelf happening to fall from his horſe, the army of Albinus cried out, Victory. But the engagement was ſoon renewed with vigour by Lætus, one of Seve-rus’s commanders, who came up with a body of reſerve, deſigning to deſtroy both parties and make himſelf emperor. This attempt, though deſigned againſt both, turned out entirely to the advantage of Severus. He therefore again charged with fιich fury and exactneſs, that he ſoon plucked the victory from thoſe who but a ſhort time before ſeemed conquerors ; and purſuing them into the city of Lyons, took Albinus priſoner, and cut off his head ; treating his dead body with inſults that could only flow from a mean and revengeſul temper. All the ſenators who were ſlain in battle he ordered to be quartered, and ſuch as were taken alive were immediately executed.</p><p>Having thus ſecured himſelf in poſſeſſion of the empire, upon his return to Rome he loaded his ſoldiers with rewards and honours ; giving them ſuch privileges as ſtrengthened his own power, while they deſtroyed that of the ſtate. For the ſoldiers, who had hitherto ſhowed the ſtrongeſt inclination to an abuſe of power, were now made arbiters of the ſate of emperors ; and we ſhall henceforward behold them ſetting them up, and dethroning them, at pleaſure.</p><p>Being thus ſecure of his army, he reſolved to give way to his natural turn for conqueſt, and to oppoſe his arms againſt the Parthians, who were then invading the frontiers of the empire. Having therefore previouſly given the government of domeſtic policy to one Plautianus, a particular favourite of his, to whoſe daughter he married his ſon Caracalla, he ſet out for the eaſt, and proſecuted the war with his uſual expedition and ſucceſs. He forced ſubmiſſion ſrom the king of Armenia, deſtroyed ſeveral cities in Arabia Felix, landed on the Parthian coaſts, took and plundered the famous city Cteſiphon, marched back through Paleſtine and Egypt, and at length returned to Rome in triumph.</p><p>During this interval, Plautianus, who was leſt to direct the affairs of Rome, began to think of aſpiring to the empire himſelf. Upon the emperor’s return, he employed a tribune of the prætorian cohorts, of which he was the commander, to aſſaſſinate him, as likewiſe his ſon Caracalla. The tribune ſeemed cheerfully to undertake this dangerous office ; but inſtead <hi rend="italic">of</hi>  going through with it, informed Severus of his favourite’s treachery. He at firſt received it as an improbable ſtory, and as the artifice of ſome one who envied his favourite’s fortune. However, he was at laſt perſuaded to permit the tribune to conduct Plautianus to the emperor’s apartments. With this intent, the tribune went and amuſed him with a pretended account of his killing the emperor and his ſon, deſiring him, if he thought it lit to ſee them dead, to come with him to the palace. As Plautianus ardently deſired their deaths, he readily gave credit to this relation ; and following the tribune, he was conducted at midnight into the innermoſt receſſes of the palace. But what miiſt have been his diſappointment, when, inſtead of finding the emperor lying dead, as he expected, he beheld the room lighted up with torches, and Severus, ſurrounded by his friends, prepared in array to receive him. Being aſhed by the emperor, with a ſtern countenance, what had brought him there at that unſeaſonable time ? he was at firſt utterly confounded ; wherefore, not knowing what excuſe to make, he ingenuouſly conſeſſed the whole, intreating forgiveneſs for what he had intended. The emperor ſeemed in the beginning inclined to pardon ; but Caracalla his ſon, who from the earlieſt age ſhowed a diſpoſition to cruelty, ſpurned him away in the midſt of his ſupplications, and with his ſword ran him through the body.</p><p>Severus having eſcaped this danger, ſpent a conſiderable time in viliting ſome cities in Italy, permitting none of his officers to ſell places of truſt or dignity, and diſtributing juſtice with the ſtricteſt impartiality. He took ſuch an exact order in managing his exchequer, that, notwithſtanding his great expences, he left more money behind him than any of his predeceſſors. His armies alſo were kept upon the moſt reſpectable footing ; ſo that he feared no invaſion. Being equally attentive to the preſervation of all parts of the empire, he reſolved to make his laſt expedition into Britain,</p></body></text></TEI>
