<p><span class="font1">upwards about an axis passing through their sternal and vertebral extremities, it is evident that the lateral diameter&nbsp;of the thorax must be&nbsp;increased, (c) When the&nbsp;muscular portion of the&nbsp;diaphragm contracts, the&nbsp;curves of its dome-like&nbsp;shape are straightened,&nbsp;the whole diaphragm&nbsp;comes to look more conical&nbsp;on section, and the apposition of its lateral parts&nbsp;to the inner surface of the&nbsp;thorax is destroyed; the&nbsp;two apposed surfaces are&nbsp;drawn apart much as the&nbsp;leaves of a book might be,&nbsp;and a space is formed&nbsp;between them, into which&nbsp;some portion of the lung&nbsp;slips, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(d)</span><span class="font1"> When the diaphragm descends it draws&nbsp;with it the whole contents of the thorax; inasmuch as the contents as&nbsp;a whole are conical in&nbsp;shape with the apex upward and are fitted into&nbsp;the conical space of the&nbsp;thoracic cavity, it is clear that the descent of the contents&nbsp;will tend to create a space between them and the thoracic&nbsp;walls; for each stratum of lung, &amp;c., which is adapted to&nbsp;fit a certain level of thorax, will thereby be brought into a&nbsp;lower and (as the thorax is conical) a more spacious level.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Hence the descent of the diaphragm causes a much greater enlargement of the thorax than is measured by the mere&nbsp;elongation of the vertical diameter. In this manner the thorax&nbsp;is distended and air is drawn into the lungs. The contraction&nbsp;of the thorax in expiration is brought about </span><span class="font0">by </span><span class="font1">the return&nbsp;of the ribs and diaphragm to their original position of rest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">How the Inspiratory Movements are Produced.—The Rib Movements.—</span><span class="font1">These are caused by the contraction of muscles which are fixed either to the central axis of the body (including&nbsp;under that term the head and vertebral column) or to some&nbsp;point rendered sufficiently stable for the purpose by the action&nbsp;of other adjuvant muscles. Thus the M. levatores costarum&nbsp;arise from the transverse processes of the 7th cervical and eleven&nbsp;upper dorsal vertebrae, and are attached to the ribs below in&nbsp;series; the M. scaleni spring from the cervical vertebrae, and&nbsp;are attached to the anterior parts of the first and second ribs;&nbsp;the M. stemocleido-mastoidei arise from the side and back of the&nbsp;skull, and are inserted into the upper part of the sternum and the&nbsp;clavicle; the M. pectoralis minor arises from the coracoid&nbsp;process of the scapula, and is inserted into the anterior ends of&nbsp;some of the ribs; the M. serratus posticus superior arises from&nbsp;certain of the cervical and dorsal vertebrae, and is inserted into&nbsp;the posterior part of certain of the ribs; the M. cervicalis&nbsp;ascendens (part of the M. erector spinae) arises from certain&nbsp;of the cervical vertebrae, and is inserted into the posterior part&nbsp;of certain ribs. The M. serratus magnus and the M. pectoralis&nbsp;major, which are affixed on the one hand to the upper arm and&nbsp;to the scapula respectively, and on the other to the ribs and to&nbsp;the sternum respectively, may in certain elevated positions of&nbsp;the arm and shoulder act as inspiratory muscles. When all&nbsp;these muscles contract, the ribs are raised in the twofold way&nbsp;already described, some pulling up the anterior ends of the&nbsp;ribs, and others causing the arched ribs to rotate about an axis&nbsp;passing through their vertebral and sternal joints.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In addition to the muscles just enumerated, the M. intercostales extemi are undoubtedly inspiratory muscles. Every external intercostal muscular fibre between a pair of ribs must,&nbsp;when it contracts, of necessity raise </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">both</span><span class="font1"> ribs, as is clearly shown&nbsp;by the accompanying diagram (fig. 10). Here </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pb'</span><span class="font1"> must be&nbsp;shorter than </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ab,</span><span class="font1"> for if angle BAa = X, then</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">alp=</span><span class="font1">ΑΒ<sup>ΐ</sup>+(Βά-Αα)<sup>ΐ</sup>+2ΑΒ(Βά-Aa)cos x; hence </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ab</span><span class="font1"> will be larger the smaller the angle x, for the cosine&nbsp;increases as the angle diminishes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">By a similar geometrical treatment of the question it may be shown that the internal intercostal muscles when they contract&nbsp;must of necessity depress both the ribs to which they are&nbsp;attached. If the angle BAc' = x(fig. n), then</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">c<sup>/</sup>d'<sup>î</sup>=AB<sup>t</sup>+(Ac<sup>/</sup>—Bd<sup>/</sup>)<sup>t</sup>—2AB(Ac<sup>z</sup>-Bd<sup>z</sup>) cos x; hence </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">C<sup>f</sup>P</span><span class="font1"> will be larger the larger the angle x.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The case, however, is not so clear with reference to the anterior portions of the internal intercostals which be between the&nbsp;cartilages; for it is evident that these fibres have the same&nbsp;direction with regard to the sternum as an axis as the external&nbsp;intercostals have with regard to the vertebral column as an&nbsp;axis; that is to say, the geometrical diagram in fig. 10 applies&nbsp;to the inter-cartilaginous internal intercostals as perfectly as it&nbsp;does to the inter-osseous parts of the external intercostals, the&nbsp;inference being that the inter-cartilaginous internal intercostals&nbsp;tend to elevate the pair of ribs between which they stretch.&nbsp;The geometrical argument is, however, overborne by physiological experiment: Martin and Hartwell have observed in the&nbsp;dog and the cat that the internal intercostals throughout their&nbsp;whole extent contract (not synchronously) but alternately with&nbsp;the diaphragm; hence we must conclude that their function&nbsp;throughout is not inspiratory like that of the diaphragm, but&nbsp;expiratory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Movements of lhe Diaphragm.</span><span class="font1">—The muscular fibres of the diaphragm are arranged in a radial manner, or, more strictly&nbsp;speaking, in a manner like the fines of longitude on a terrestrial&nbsp;globe. The central tendon of the diaphragm corresponds to&nbsp;the pole of such a globe. The contraction of the fibres is expended on straightening the longitudinal curves rather than on&nbsp;pulling down the central tendon to a lower level; in fact, the&nbsp;central tendon moves very little in ordinary respiration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">How the Expiratory Movements are Produced.—</span><span class="font1">The action of inspiration disturbs many organs from the position of rest&nbsp;into which gravity and their own physical properties have&nbsp;thrown them. The ribs and sternum are raised from the position&nbsp;of lowest level; the elastic costal cartilages are twisted; the&nbsp;elastic lungs are put upon the stretch; the abdominal organs,&nbsp;themselves elastic, are compressed and thrust against the&nbsp;elastic walls of the belly, causing these to bulge outwards. In&nbsp;short the very act of inspiration stores up, as it were, in sundry&nbsp;ways the forces which make for expiration. As soon as the&nbsp;inspiratory muscles cease to act these Jorces come into play, and&nbsp;the position of rest or equilibrium is regained. It is very doubtful&nbsp;whether any special expiratory muscles are called into action&nbsp;during ordinary respiration. The internal intercostals may in&nbsp;man be exercised in ordinary expiration (although they are&nbsp;certainly not so exercised in the dog and the cat); but in&nbsp;laboured expiration many muscles assist in the expulsive effort.&nbsp;The muscles forming the belly-walls contract and force the&nbsp;abdominal contents against the relaxed diaphragm in such a&nbsp;manner as to drive it farther and farther into the thorax. At&nbsp;the same time by their attachment to the lower edge of the</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
