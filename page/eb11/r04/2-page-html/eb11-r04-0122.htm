<p><span class="font1">But, though the agrarian reform failed, the political conflict it had provoked continued, and the lines on which it was waged&nbsp;were in the main those laid down by Gaius Gracchus. The&nbsp;sovereignty of the assembly continued to be the watchword&nbsp;of the popular party, and a free use of the tribunician powers&nbsp;of interference and of legislation remained the most effective&nbsp;means of accomplishing their aims.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Ten years after the death of Gaius the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">popular es</span><span class="font1"> once more summoned up courage to challenge the supremacy- of the&nbsp;senate; but it was on a question of foreign administration that the conflict was renewed. The course of&nbsp;affairs in the client state of Numidia since Micipsa’s&nbsp;death in 118 had been such as to discredit a stronger&nbsp;government than that of the senate.@@<sup>2</sup> In defiance of Roman&nbsp;authority, and relying on the influence of his own well-spent&nbsp;gold, Jugurtha had murdered both his legitimate rivals, Hiemp-sal and Adherbal, and made himself master of Numidia. The&nbsp;declaration of war wrung from the senate (112) by&nbsp;popular indignation had been followed by the corruption of a consul@@<sup>3</sup> (hi) and the crushing defeat of&nbsp;the proconsul Albinus.@@<sup>4</sup> On the news of this crowning disgrace the storm burst, and on the proposal of the tribunes a&nbsp;commission of inquiry was appointed into the conduct of the&nbsp;war@@<sup>5</sup> But the popular leaders did not stop here. Q. Caecilius&nbsp;MeteUus, who as consul (109) had succeeded to the command in^iumidia, was an able soldier but a rigid&nbsp;aristocrat; and they now resolved to improve their success by&nbsp;entrusting the command instead to a genuine son of the people.&nbsp;Their choice fell on Gaius Marius (sec Marius), an experienced&nbsp;officer and administrator, but a man of humble birth, wholly&nbsp;illiterate, and one who, though no politician, was by temperament and training a hater of the polished and effeminate nobles&nbsp;who filled the senate.@@<sup>6</sup> He was triumphantly elected, and, in&nbsp;spite of a decree of the senate continuing Metellus as proconsul,&nbsp;he was entrusted by a vote of the assembly with the charge of</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">the war against Jugurtha </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.).@@<sup>7</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Jugurtha was vanquished; and Marius, who had been a second time elected consul in his absence, arrived at Rome in&nbsp;January 104, bringing the captive prince with him in&nbsp;chains.@@<sup>8</sup> But further triumphs awaited the popular&nbsp;hero. The Cimbri and Teutones were at the gates of Italy;&nbsp;they had four times defeated the senatorial generals, and Marius&nbsp;was called upon to save Rome from a second invasion of the&nbsp;barbarians.@@<sup>9</sup> After two years of suspense the victory at Aquae&nbsp;Sextiae (102), followed by that on the Raudine plain&nbsp;(101), put an end to the danger by the annihilation of&nbsp;the invading hordes; and Marius, now consul for the&nbsp;fifth time, returned to Rome in triumph. There the popular&nbsp;party welcomed him as a leader with all the prestige of a successful general. Once more, however, they were destined to a brief&nbsp;success followed by disastrous defeat. Marius became for the&nbsp;sixth time consul;@@<sup>10</sup> of the two popular leaders Glaucia became&nbsp;praetor and Saturninus tribune. But Marius and his&nbsp;allies were not statesmen of the stamp of the Gracchi;&nbsp;and the laws proposed by Saturninus had evidently&nbsp;no serious aim in view other than that of harassing&nbsp;the senate. His com law merely reduced the price&nbsp;fixed in 123 for the monthly dole of com, and the&nbsp;main point of his agrarian law lay in the clause appended&nbsp;to it requiring all senators to swear to observe its pro</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">visions.@@<sup>11</sup> The laws were carried, but the triumph of the popular leaders was short-lived. Their recklessness and violence had&nbsp;alienated all classes in Rome; and their period of office was&nbsp;drawing to a close. At the elections fresh rioting took place,&nbsp;and Marius as consul was called upon by the senate to protect&nbsp;the state against his own partisans. Saturninus and Glaucia&nbsp;surrendered, but while the senate was discussing their fate they&nbsp;were surrounded and murdered by their opponents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The popular party had been worsted once more in their struggle with the senate, but none the less their alliance with&nbsp;Marius, and the position in which their votes placed him, marked&nbsp;an epoch in* the history of the revolution. The transference&nbsp;of the political leadership to a consul who was nothing if&nbsp;not a soldier was at once a confession of the insufficiency of&nbsp;the purely civil authority of the tribunate and a dangerous encouragement of military interference in political controversies.&nbsp;The consequences were already foreshadowed by the special&nbsp;provisions made by Saturninus for Marius’s veterans, and in&nbsp;the active part taken by them in the passing of his laws.&nbsp;Indirectly, too, Marius, though no politician, played an&nbsp;important part in this new departure. His military&nbsp;reforms@@<sup>12</sup> at once democratized the army and attached&nbsp;it more closely to its leader for the time being. He&nbsp;swept away the last traces of civil distinctions of rank&nbsp;or wealth within the legion, admitted to its ranks all classes, and&nbsp;substituted voluntary enlistment under a popular general for the&nbsp;old-fashioned compulsory levy. The efficiency of the legion was&nbsp;increased at the cost of a complete severance of the ties which&nbsp;bound it to the civil community and to the civil authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The next important crisis was due partly to the rivalry which had been growing more bitter each year between the senate and&nbsp;the commercial class, and partly to the long-impending question&nbsp;of the enfranchisement of the Italian allies. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">publicani,&nbsp;negotiator es</span><span class="font1"> and others, who constituted what was now becoming&nbsp;known as the equestrian order (see Equites), had made unscrupulous use of their control of the courts and especially of&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">quaestio de repetundis</span><span class="font1"> against their natural rivals, the&nbsp;official class in the provinces. The threat of prosecution before&nbsp;a hostile jury was held over the head of every governor, legate&nbsp;and quaestor who ventured to interfere with their operations in&nbsp;the provinces. The average official preferred to connive at&nbsp;their exactions; the bolder ones paid with fines and even exile&nbsp;for their courage. In 92 the necessity for a reform was&nbsp;proved beyond a doubt by the scandalous condemnation&nbsp;of P.Rutilius Rufus,@@<sup>13</sup> ostensibly on a charge of extortion,&nbsp;in reality as the reward of his efforts to check the&nbsp;extortions of the Roman equites in Asia. The difficulties of the Italian question were more serious. That&nbsp;the Italian allies were discontented was notorious. After&nbsp;nearly two centuries of close alliance, of common dangers and&nbsp;victories, they now eagerly coveted as a boon that complete&nbsp;amalgamation w'ith Rome which they had at first resented as&nbsp;a dishonour. But, unfortunately, Rome had grown more exclusive in proportion as the value set upon Roman citizenship&nbsp;increased. During the last forty years feelings of hope and&nbsp;disappointment had rapidly succeeded each other; Marcus&nbsp;Fulvius Flaccus, Gaius Gracchus, Saturninus, had all held out&nbsp;promises of relief—and nothing had yet been done. On each&nbsp;occasion they had crowded to Rome, full of eager expectation,&nbsp;only to be harshly ejected from the city by the consul’s orders.@@<sup>14&nbsp;</sup>The justice of their claims could hardly be denied, the danger of&nbsp;continuing to ignore them was obvious—yet the difficulties in&nbsp;the way of granting them were formidable in the extreme, and&nbsp;from a higher than a merely selfish point of view there was much</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
