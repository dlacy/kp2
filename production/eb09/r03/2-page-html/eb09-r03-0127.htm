        <p><span class="font2">agger, is in parts about 33 feet from the front one, but it varies in
                this respect ; in other parts the agger appears to have been more</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">than 50 feet thick. Between the railway station and the Dogana a fine
                lofty piece of the front wall remains, with traces of the Porta&nbsp;Viminalis and
                of the lower back wall. Unfortunately the whole of&nbsp;the bank or agger proper has
                been removed, and the rough back of&nbsp;the great retaining wall exposed. Both tufa
                and peperino are&nbsp;used; the blocks vary in length, but average in depth the
                usual&nbsp;2 Roman feet. The railway cutting which has destroyed a great&nbsp;part
                of the agger showed clearly the section of the whole work : the&nbsp;strata of
                different kinds of soil which appeared on the sides of the&nbsp;foss appeared again
                in the agger, but reversed as they naturally&nbsp;would be in the process of digging
                out and heaping up. Dionysius&nbsp;(ix. 68) states the length of the agger to have
                been 7 stadia—that&nbsp;is, about 1400 yards—which agrees (roughly speaking) with
                the&nbsp;actual discoveries. Originally one road ran along the bottom of&nbsp;the
                foss and another along its edge ; the latter existed in imperial&nbsp;times. But the
                whole foss appears to have been filled up, probably&nbsp;in the time of Augustus,
                and afterwards built upon ; houses of&nbsp;mixed brick and opus reticulatum still
                exist against the outside&nbsp;of the great wall, which was itself used as the back
                wall of these&nbsp;houses, so that we now see painted stucco of the time of
                Hadrian&nbsp;covering parts of the wall of the kings. Another row of
                houses&nbsp;seems to have faced the road mentioned above as running along&nbsp;the
                upper edge of the foss, thus forming a long street. As early as&nbsp;the time of
                Augustus a very large part of the wall of the kings&nbsp;had been pulled down and
                built over, so that even then its circuit&nbsp;was difficult to trace (Dionys., iv.
                13). A very curious series of&nbsp;masons’ marks</span></p>

                enough (he says) for a loaded hay-cart to pass&nbsp;along. The mouths of two other
                similar but smaller eloaeæ are&nbsp;still visible in the great quay wall near the
                Cloaca Maxima, and a&nbsp;whole network of sewers exists under a great part of the
                Servian&nbsp;city. Some of these are not built with arched vaults, but
                have&nbsp;triangular tops formed of courses of stone on level beds, each projecting
                over the one below,—a very primitive method of construction, employed in the
                Tullianum (see fig. 11). The great quay&nbsp;wall of tufa and peperino which lined

                the river. In later times this massive wall was extended, as the city grew, all
                along the bank of the Campus Martius<sub>1&nbsp;</sub>and, having lost its
                importance as a line of defence, had frequent&nbsp;flights of stairs built against
                it, descending to the river. Some of&nbsp;these are shown in one of the fragments of
