<p><span class="font1">ed of some of all the adjoining states, although the Oscans and Pelasgians were the most numerous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">With regard to the Etruscans, we are of opinion that for a very peculiar reason, they could not have formed any considerable proportion of the inhabitants of Rome. We are&nbsp;inclined to hazard the conjecture, that the name Etruscan, as&nbsp;commonly used, is extremely deceptive, and leads almost&nbsp;invariably to error. The true name of the peculiar people&nbsp;generally called Etrusci, was, according to themselves, Rasena. It is constantly asserted that their language is totally unknown ; and yet they are said to have occupied a very&nbsp;large portion of Italy, and to have been in constant and intimate intercourse with the nations inhabiting its other divisions. It is scarcely credible that not one word of confessedly a highly civilized people should have entered into&nbsp;the language of those nations with whom they held intercourse. But, if the body of the people called Etrusci were&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">of </span><span class="font1">Oscan, Umbrian, or even of Celtic origin, while the Ra-sena were merely a race of skilful and intelligent foreigners,&nbsp;who had, by force or policy, acquired the station of a ruling&nbsp;and a sacerdotal caste, their peculiar language might never&nbsp;be communicated to the body of the people whom they ruled, and so might perish when their power was broken and&nbsp;their caste destroyed.@@<sup>1</sup> The possibility that the Rasena were&nbsp;indeed a sacerdotal caste, similar to those of Egypt, India,&nbsp;and other oriental nations, perhaps also of the Celtic race,&nbsp;will scarcely be questioned by those who are acquainted with&nbsp;the history of the Brahmins and the Druids.@@<sup>2</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Reverting to what has already been stated respecting the patriarchal form of rule common to the Oscan and Pelasgian races, we are furnished with an explanation of the central principle of all the Roman institutions. The form of&nbsp;government resulting from such a principle was necessarily&nbsp;monarchical, but could not be despotic. For, while the king&nbsp;ruled supremely over the nation at large, every head of a&nbsp;family ruled over his own household with uncontrolled sway,&nbsp;at once as its king and its priest.@@<sup>3</sup> But, in order to obtain&nbsp;the advantages of union, the families, houses, or gentes, formed themselves into bodies of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ten</span><span class="font1"> each, called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">curiœ.</span><span class="font1"> Over&nbsp;each curia, one head of a House, or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gens,</span><span class="font1"> held a sort of presidency, and received the name of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">curio.</span><span class="font1"> The union often&nbsp;curiæ formed a tribe. The union of the three tribes, the&nbsp;Ramnenses, or Romans strictly speaking and with reference&nbsp;to the inhabitants of the Palatine hill, the Titienses, or subjects of Titius, who were Sabines, and inhabited the Quirinal and Capitoline hills, and the Luceres, who were probably the original followers of the Etruscan Lucumo who aided Romulus, and settled at first on the Caelian hill, augmented by adventurers from neighbouring states, formed&nbsp;the Populus Romanus in the strict sense of that term. Thus&nbsp;the patriarchal principle pervaded the entire body politic,&nbsp;and gave to it all that was peculiar in its aspect and institutions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We must not, however, omit to mention, that within tllis external and public form of the body politic there was included another of a more private and personal character.&nbsp;As a state, tribes, curiæ, and houses were alone visible; but&nbsp;in each house there were necessarily members and dependents. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">members</span><span class="font1"> connected by blood with the head ofthe&nbsp;house, or gens, were </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Gentiles,</span><span class="font1"> or as we might term them,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">kinsmen,</span><span class="font1"> and formed the free citizens of Rome : the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">dependants,</span><span class="font1"> who were not all, nor necessarily, blood relations,&nbsp;were called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">clientes,</span><span class="font1"> and might, with some modifications,&nbsp;be designated </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">clansmen,</span><span class="font1"> belonging to the clan, but beneath&nbsp;the rank of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">duinne-wassal,</span><span class="font1"> or gentlemen directly related to the chief. From this arose that more private οι domestic division of the people into </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">patrοni</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">clientes.</span><span class="font1"> The&nbsp;patrons alone were recognised as citizens by the state, in&nbsp;their various aspects, as heads of houses, members of the&nbsp;curiæ, and of the tribes ; and by them, and for them, were&nbsp;all laws made, with all which the clients had no connexion.&nbsp;The relationship in which the clients could alone be viewed was entirely of a private nature, subsisting exclusively&nbsp;between them and their patrons. The power of the patrons&nbsp;over the clients, on the other hand, would have been altogether despotic, but for the patriarchal element from which&nbsp;it sprung, and by which it was tempered. The client was&nbsp;regarded by the patron as to a certain extent a member of&nbsp;his family, owing to him indeed the most implicit obedience,&nbsp;but having the strongest claims upon him for protection,&nbsp;and even for some measure of paternal regard. The patron&nbsp;was bound to relieve the distress of his clients, to appear&nbsp;for them in court, to expound to them the law, civil and&nbsp;pontifical, and to allot them portions of land to cultivate and&nbsp;build upon, which, however, they held only as tenants at&nbsp;will. The clients on their part were bound to be obedient&nbsp;to their patron, to promote his honour, to pay whatsoever&nbsp;public fines might be imposed on him, to aid him jointly&nbsp;with the real members of his house, in bearing the public&nbsp;burdens of taxes, to contribute to the portioning of his&nbsp;daughters, and to ransom him or any member of his family who might fall into the hands of an enemy. If the&nbsp;client died without heirs, the patron succeeded to his property ; and if the patron failed in discharging his duty to&nbsp;his clients, he was accounted infamous and accursed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But the union of the three Tribes belongs to a subsequent period of the history. Although it seems sufficiently probable that tlle rudiments of the tribe called the Luceres, existed in the time of the founder of Rome, yet&nbsp;tllat tribe was not raised to a full equality with the other&nbsp;two till a later period. During the reigns of the first&nbsp;two kings of Rome, the nation presents a strictly twofold&nbsp;aspect, consisting of the two chief tribes, the Ramnenses&nbsp;and the Titienses. In each tribe the arrangements were&nbsp;precisely similar, ten houses constituting a curia, and ten&nbsp;curiæ a tribe, of which the heads of houses formed the senate, and the heads of the curiæ formed the chief senators.&nbsp;The great national council consisted thus of 200 senators,&nbsp;half Romans and half Sabines, or, laying aside the national&nbsp;designations, and retaining those of the tribes alone, half&nbsp;Ramnenses and half Titienses. The senate thus being&nbsp;wholly composed ofheadsofhouses, its members were rightly&nbsp;named patres, and their order the patrician ; but this patrician order comprehended at first the entire people, in consequence of the family-relationship, which, in fact or semblance, pervaded the whole community. Every head of a&nbsp;house was the judge and ruler of his house, both members&nbsp;and clients ; the curia of ten houses governed the affairs of&nbsp;their collective body ; and the senate of ten curiæ deliberated upon the affairs of the nation. In those early days,&nbsp;the assemblies of the people were merely assemblies of the&nbsp;patrician houses, who alone possessed the rights of full citizenship ; and these assemblies were held in the valley between the Palatine and Capitoline bills, termed the Forum</span></p><div>

<p><span class="font1">@@@<sup>2</sup> If this view could be substantiated, it would explain many of the most difficult questions that arise respecting the Etruscans. It would at once account for the want of a community of interest between the Etruscan chiefs and the body of the people, which prevented the&nbsp;growth of any regularly consolidated power among them, caused those sudden transitions from strength to weakness, and led ultimately to&nbsp;tbe disappearing of the ruling caste, and the complete blending of the real people with tbe other Italian nations. For when the Rasena&nbsp;ceased to rule, having little, if any thing, in common with the body of their subjects, not even their language, they speedily ceased to have&nbsp;a separate existence ; and the people, who were correctly designated Tyrrbeni, or Tursceni, and were of Pelasgic origin, very soon blended&nbsp;with their more kindred races, as, indeed, the Luceres had done with the primitive Romans at an earlier period.</span></p>
