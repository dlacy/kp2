<p><span class="font0">deposits are recent. Between Bingen and Bonn the Rhine forces its way through a hilly and rocky district belonging to the&nbsp;Devonian formation. The contorted strata of slate and greywacke&nbsp;rock must have been formed at a period vastly anterior to that in&nbsp;which the lake of the upper valley managed to force an outlet&nbsp;through the enclosing barriers. Probably this section may be&nbsp;looked upon as the oldest portion of the river course proper, connecting the upper Rhenish lake with the primeval ocean at Bonn.&nbsp;In this district too, as has already been remarked, is the finest&nbsp;scenery of the Rhine, a fact due in great part to the grotesque&nbsp;shapes of the quartzose rocks, left denuded of the less durable slate&nbsp;and sandstone. All the strata intersected by the Rhine between&nbsp;Bingen and Bonn contain fossils of the same classes. The deposits&nbsp;of the actual valley here, belonging to the Miocene group of the&nbsp;Tertiary system, are older than the deposits either farther up or&nbsp;farther down the river ; but they are contemporaneous with the&nbsp;basalts of the Rhine, which at Coblentz and in the peaks of the&nbsp;Seven Mountains also contribute to the scenic charm of the river.&nbsp;The very extensive pumice deposits at Neuwied and the lava and&nbsp;other volcanic rocks belong to a more recent epoch. Below Bingen&nbsp;the formations belong almost entirely to the Post-Tertiary period.&nbsp;Numerous extinct volcanoes rise near Neuwied. In the flatter&nbsp;parts of the valley occur large beds of loam and rubble, sometimes&nbsp;in terraces parallel with, but several hundred feet above, the&nbsp;river,—proving by their disposition and appearance that the valley&nbsp;has been formed by the action of water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Rhine has been one of the chief waterways of Europe from the earliest times ; and, as its channel is not exposed to the danger&nbsp;of silting up like those of the Elbe and the Oder, it has always been&nbsp;comparatively easy to keep it open. The Romans exerted themselves to improve the lower navigation of the river, and appointed&nbsp;prefects of the Rhine to superintend the shipping and to exact the&nbsp;moderate dues imposed to keep the channel in repair. The Franks&nbsp;continued the same policy and retained a system of river-dues.&nbsp;Afterwards as the banks became parcelled out among a host of petty&nbsp;princelings, each of whom arrogated the right of laying a tax on&nbsp;passing vessels, the imposts became so prejudicial as seriously to&nbsp;hamper the development of the shipping. Many of the riparian&nbsp;potentates derived the bulk of their revenue from this source, and&nbsp;it is calculated that in the.l8th century the Rhine yielded a total&nbsp;revenue of £200,000, in spite of the comparatively insignificant&nbsp;amount of the shipping. The first proposal for a free Rhine was&nbsp;mooted by the French at the congress of Rastatt (1797-1799), but&nbsp;Holland, commanding the mouth of the river, placed every obstacle&nbsp;in the way of the suggestion. In 1831, on the separation of&nbsp;Holland and Belgium, the former had become more amenable to&nbsp;reason ; and a system was agreed upon which practically gave free&nbsp;navigation to the vessels of the riverine states, while imposing a&nbsp;moderate tariff upon foreign ships. It was not, however, till&nbsp;1869 that the last vestige of a toll disappeared and the river was&nbsp;thrown open without any restriction. The management of the&nbsp;channel and navigation is now vested in a Central Commission,&nbsp;meeting at Mannheim. The channel has been greatly improved,&nbsp;and in many places made more direct since the beginning of the&nbsp;present century,—large sums being annually spent in keeping it&nbsp;in order. Capacious river harbours have been formed at various&nbsp;points, about twenty-five of these being in Germany and eight or&nbsp;ten more in Holland. The total weight of the goods forwarded&nbsp;each year on the Rhine has of late amounted to nearly 1,000,000&nbsp;tons, the chief articles being timber, coal, iron, agricultural&nbsp;produce, and manufactured goods of various kinds. The position&nbsp;of the liver is highly favourable for the development of its trade.&nbsp;It flows through the most populous regions of the continent of&nbsp;Europe, to discharge into one of the most frequented seas opposite&nbsp;Great Britain, and, besides serving as a natural outlet for Germany, Belgium, and Holland, is connected with a great part of&nbsp;central and southern France by the Rhine-Rhone and the Rhine-Marne Canals, and with the basin of the Danube by the Ludwigs-Canal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The introduction of steam has greatly increased the shipping on the Rhine ; and small steamers ply also on the Main, the Neckar,&nbsp;the Maas, and the Moselle. The first Rhine steamer was launched&nbsp;in 1817 ; and now the river is regularly traversed by upwards of a&nbsp;hundred, from the small tug up to the passenger saloon-steamer.&nbsp;The steamboat traffic has especially encouraged the influx of&nbsp;tourists, and the number of passing travellers may now be reckoned&nbsp;as between one and two millions annually. The river is navigable&nbsp;without in,teιτuρtion from Basel to its mouth, a distance of 550&nbsp;miles, of which 450 lie within Germany. Above Spires, however, the river craft are comparatively small, but lower down&nbsp;vessels of 500 and 600 tons burden find no difficulty in plying.&nbsp;Between Basel and Strasburg the depth of water is sometimes not&nbsp;more than 3 feet ; between Strasburg and Mainz it varies from&nbsp;5 to 25 feet ; while below Mainz it is never less than 9 or 10 feet.&nbsp;The deepest point is opposite the Luιiei Rock near St Goar, where&nbsp;it is 75 feet in depth ; at Düsseldorf the depth is about 50 feet.&nbsp;Oue of the most interesting features of the Rhine navigation is&nbsp;afforded by the huge rafts of timber that are floated down the river.&nbsp;Single tree trunks sent down to the Rhine by the various tributaries&nbsp;are united into small rafts as they reach the main stream ; and&nbsp;these again are fastened together to form one large raft about&nbsp;Andernach. Though not so large as formerly, these timber-rafts&nbsp;are still sometimes 400 or 500 feet in length, and are navigated by&nbsp;200 to 400 men, who live in little huts on the raft, forming actual&nbsp;floating villages. On reaching Dort the rafts are broken up and&nbsp;sold, a single raft sometimes producing as much as £30,000. The&nbsp;voyage from Bingen to. Dort takes from one to six weeks, and the&nbsp;huge unwieldy structures require to be navigated with great care.&nbsp;The commerce carried on by the river itself is supplemented by&nbsp;the numerous railways, which skirt its banks and converge to its&nbsp;principal towns. Before the introduction of railways there were&nbsp;no permanent bridges across the Rhine below Basel ; but now&nbsp;trains cross it at about a dozen different points in Germany and&nbsp;Holland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The salmon fisheries of the Rhine, lying mainly between Bach-arach and St Goar, have long been famous ; but their produce has been seriously diminished since the advent of the steamer. Pike,&nbsp;carp, and other white fish are also caught. A little gold is&nbsp;brought down by the Rhine from the Alps and the heights of the&nbsp;Black Forest, but not in sufficient amount to make its collection&nbsp;of economic value. The white wines of the Rhine are the finest in&nbsp;the world, though the palm in red wines must be given to the&nbsp;vineyards of Bordeaux. The vineyards lie mainly bet when Mainz&nbsp;and Bonn, a distance of 90 miles,—the choicest varieties of wine&nbsp;being produced in the Rheingau, a picturesque district on the&nbsp;right bank between Riidesheim and Biebrich, about 12 miles long&nbsp;and 5 broad. The well known brands Johannisberger, Steinberger,&nbsp;Marcobrunner, and Assmannshauser are all grown in this narrow&nbsp;compass. The valleys of the Neckar, the Moselle, the Nahe, and&nbsp;other tributaries of the Rhine also yield good wine ; and the valley&nbsp;of the Ahr may be indicated as the northern limit of the wine&nbsp;culture. The total annual value of the Rhenish wines is about&nbsp;£2,400,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The long array of ancient and flourishing towns along its banks bear witness to the great importance of the river. These are most&nbsp;frequent in the upper Rhenish basin and again below Bonn, the&nbsp;places in the narrower part of the valley being generally more&nbsp;remarkable for their picturesque situation than for their commercial&nbsp;or political influence. Beyond the borders of Germany the only&nbsp;large towns on the Rhine are Basel in Switzerland, and Arnheim,&nbsp;Utrecht, and Leyden in Holland. Within Germany, as we trace&nbsp;the course of the river form south to north, we come successively&nbsp;to Spires, Mannheim, Mainz, Coblentz, Bonn, Cologne, Düsseldorf,&nbsp;and Wesel. Worms, which was formerly washed by the Rhine,&nbsp;lies about ∣ mile distant from the present course ; and Strasburg,&nbsp;which lies on the 111, 2 miles from the Rhine, may also be reckoned&nbsp;as one of its towns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Politically the Rhine has always played a great part ; and it would require no great straining to write a history of this majestic&nbsp;river which would also be a history of the western half of continental Europe. The whole valley seems to have been originally&nbsp;occupied by Celtic tribes, who have left traces of their presence on&nbsp;the contents of tombs and in the forms of names (Moguutiacum&nbsp;or Mainz, Borbetomagus or Worms, &amp;c.) ; but at the beginning of&nbsp;the historical period we find the Celts everywhere in retreat before&nbsp;the advancing Teutons. Probably the Teutonic pressure began as&nbsp;early as the 4th century before Christ, and the history of the&nbsp;next few hundred years may be summed up as the gradual&nbsp;substitution of a Germanic for a Celtic population along the banks&nbsp;of the Rhine. Its second historical period begins with the advent&nbsp;of the Romans, who stemmed the advancing Teutonic tide.&nbsp;Augustus and his successors took good care to fortify the Rhine&nbsp;carefully, and a large proportion of the Roman legions were constantly in garrison here. For two hundred years the Rhine formed&nbsp;the boundary between the Roman empire and the Teutonic hordes ;&nbsp;and during that period the left or Roman bank made prodigious&nbsp;strides in civilization and culture. The wonderful Roman remains at Treves and elsewhere, the Roman roads, bridges, and&nbsp;aqueducts, are convincing proofs of what the Rhine gained from&nbsp;Roman domination. This Roman civilization was, however, destined to be swamped by the current of Teutonic immigration,&nbsp;which finally broke down the barriers of the Roman empire and&nbsp;overwhelmed the whole of the Rhenish district. Under Charlemagne, whose principal residence was in Aix-la-Chapelle, the culture of the Rhine valley again began to flourish, its results being&nbsp;still to be traced in the important architectural remains of this&nbsp;period. At the partition of the domains of Charlemagne in 843 </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">the Rhine formed the boundary between Germany and the middle&nbsp;kingdom of Lotharingia ; but by 870 it lay wholly within the former&nbsp;realm. For nearly eight hundred years it continued in this position,&nbsp;the frontier of the German empire coinciding more or less with&nbsp;the line of the Rhone. During the early Middle Ages the bank of&nbsp;the Rhine formed the most cultured part of Germany, basing its&nbsp;civilization on its Roman past.
