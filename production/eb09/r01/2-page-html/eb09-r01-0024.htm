<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">of clear ice is cut into the form of a large burning-glass it can be employed to inflame tinder by concentrating the&nbsp;sun’s rays, and the lens does the work nearly as rapidly&nbsp;as if it had been made of glass. It is certainly not what&nbsp;we ordinarily call “ heat ” which can be transmitted under&nbsp;conditions like these. Radiation is undoubtedly a transference of energy, which was in the form commonly called&nbsp;heat in the radiating body, and becomes heat in a body&nbsp;which absorbs it ; but it is transformed as it leaves the first&nbsp;body, and retransformed when it is absorbed by the second.&nbsp;Until the comparatively recent full recognition of the conservation and transformation of energy it was almost impossible to form precise ideas on matters like this ; and,&nbsp;consequently, we find in the writings even of men like&nbsp;Prévost and Sir J. Leslie notions of the wildest character&nbsp;as to the mechanism of radiation. Leslie, strangely, regarded it as a species of “ pulsation ” in the air, in some&nbsp;respects analogous to sound, and propagated with the same&nbsp;speed as sound. Prévost, on the other hand, says, “ Le&nbsp;calorique est un fluide discret ; chaque élément de calorique suit constamment la même ligne droite, tant qu’aucun&nbsp;obstacle ne l’arrête. Dans un espace chaud, chaque point&nbsp;est traversé sans cesse en tout sens uar des filets de&nbsp;calorique.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more intensely the cannon ball is heated the&nbsp;more luminous does it become, and also the more nearly&nbsp;white is the light which it gives out. So well is this&nbsp;known that in almost all forms of civilized speech there&nbsp;are terms corresponding to our </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> red-hot,” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> white-hot,” &amp;c.&nbsp;As another instance, suppose a powerful electric current&nbsp;is made to pass through a stout iron wire. The wire&nbsp;becomes gradually hotter, up to a certain point, at which&nbsp;the loss by radiation and convection just balances the&nbsp;gain of heat by electric resistance. And as it becomes&nbsp;hotter the amount of its radiation increases, till at a&nbsp;definite temperature it becomes just visible in the dark&nbsp;by red rays of low refrangibility. As it becomes still&nbsp;hotter the whole radiation increases ; the red rays formerly&nbsp;given off become more luminous, and are joined by others&nbsp;of higher refrangibility. This process goes on, the whole&nbsp;amount of radiation still increasing, each kind of visible&nbsp;light becoming more intense, and new rays of light of&nbsp;higher refrangibility coming in, until the whole becomes&nbsp;white, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i.e</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">., gives off all the more efficient kinds of visible&nbsp;light in much the same relative proportion as that in&nbsp;which they exist in sunlight. When the circuit is broken,&nbsp;exactly the same phenomena occur in the reverse order,&nbsp;the various kinds of light disappearing later as their&nbsp;refrangibility is less. But the radiation continues, growing weaker every instant, even after the whole is dark.&nbsp;This simple observation irresistibly points to the conclusion that the so-called “ radiant heat ” is precisely the&nbsp;same phenomenon as “ light,” only the invisible rays are&nbsp;still less refrangible than the lowest red, and that our&nbsp;sense of sight is confined to rays of a certain definite&nbsp;range of refrangibility, while the sense of touch comes&nbsp;in where sight fails us. Sir W. Herschel in 1798, by&nbsp;placing the bulb of a thermometer in the solar spectrum&nbsp;formed by a flint-glass prism, found that the highest&nbsp;temperature was in the dark region outside the lowest&nbsp;visible red,—a result amply verified at the time by others,&nbsp;though warmly contested by Leslie.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This striking conclusion is not without close analogies in connexion with the other senses, especially that&nbsp;of hearing. Thus it has long been known that the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> range&nbsp;of hearing” differs considerably in different individuals,&nbsp;some, for instance, being painfully affected by the chirp&nbsp;of a cricket, which is inaudible to others whose general&nbsp;hearing is quite as good. Extremely low notes, on the&nbsp;other hand, of whose existence we have ample dynamical</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">evidence, are not heard by any one</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> when perceived at all they are </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">felt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may now rapidly run over the principal facts&nbsp;characteristic of the behaviour of visible rays (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Light),&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">and point out how far each has been found to characterize&nbsp;that of so-called “ radiant heat ” under similar conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(a)</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> Rectilinear propagation : an opaque screen which is placed so as to intercept the sun’s light intercepts its&nbsp;heat also, whether it be close to the observer, at a few&nbsp;miles from him (as a cloud or a mountain), or 240,000&nbsp;miles off (as the moon in a total eclipse). (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">b</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">) Speed of&nbsp;propagation: this must be of the same order of magnitude, at least, for both phenomena, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> 186,000 miles&nbsp;or so per second; for the sun’s heat ceases to be perceptible the moment an eclipse becomes total, and is perceived&nbsp;again the instant the edge of the sun’s disk is visible,&nbsp;(c) Reflexion: the law must be exactly the same, for&nbsp;the heat-producing rays from a star are concentrated by&nbsp;Lord Rosse’s great reflector along with its light. (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">d</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">)&nbsp;Refraction: when a lens is not achromatic its principal&nbsp;focus for red rays is farther off than that for blue rays;&nbsp;that for dark heat is still farther off. Herschel’s determination of the warmest region of the spectrum (§ 4 above)&nbsp;is another case in point. (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e)</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> Oblique radiation : an illuminated or a self-luminous surface appears equally bright&nbsp;however it is inclined to the line of sight. The radiation&nbsp;of heat from a hot blackened surface (through an aperture&nbsp;which it appears to fill) is sensibly the same however it be&nbsp;inclined (Leslie, Fourier, Mellon!).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(/) Intensity: when</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">there is no absorption by the way the intensity of the light received from a luminous point-source is inversely as the&nbsp;square of the distance. The same is true of dark heat.&nbsp;But this is not a new analogy; it is a mere consequence&nbsp;of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(a)</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> rectilinear propagation, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(g)</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> Selective absorption :&nbsp;light which has been sifted by passing through one plate&nbsp;of blue glass passes in much greater percentage through&nbsp;a second plate of the same glass, and in still greater&nbsp;percentage through a third. The same is true of radiant&nbsp;heat, even when the experiment is made with uncoloured&nbsp;glass; for clear glass absorbs certain colours of dark heat&nbsp;more than others (De Laroche, Melloni). </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(h)</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> Interference&nbsp;bands, whether produced by two mirrors or by gratings,&nbsp;characterize dark heat as well as light; only they indicate&nbsp;longer waves (Fizeau and Foucault), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(i)</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> Polarization&nbsp;and double refraction : with special apparatus, such as&nbsp;plates of mica split by heat into numerous parallel films,&nbsp;the polarization of dark heat is easily established. When&nbsp;two of these bundles are so placed as to intercept the heat,&nbsp;an unsplit film of mica interposed between them allows&nbsp;the heat to pass, or arrests it, as it is made to rotate in its&nbsp;own plane (Forbes), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(j)</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> By proper chemical adjustments&nbsp;photographs of a region of the solar spectrum beyond&nbsp;the visible red have been obtained (Abney). We might&nbsp;mention more, but those given above, when considered&nbsp;together, are conclusive. In fact </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(b)</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(i)</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> alone would&nbsp;almost settle the question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is a superior as well as an inferior limit of&nbsp;visible rays. Light whose period of vibration is too small&nbsp;to produce any impression on the optic nerve can be&nbsp;degraded by fluorescence (see </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Light) </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">into visible rays,&nbsp;and can also be detected by its energetic action on various&nbsp;photographic chemicals. In fact photographic portraits&nbsp;can be taken in a room which appears absolutely dark to&nbsp;the keenest eyesight. By one or other of these processes&nbsp;the solar spectrum with its dark lines and the electric arc&nbsp;with its bright lines have been delineated to many times&nbsp;the length of their visible ranges. The electric arc especially&nbsp;gives (in either of these ways) a spectrum of extraordinary&nbsp;length; for we can examine it, as we can </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> examine&nbsp;sunlight, before it has suffered any sensible absorption.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
