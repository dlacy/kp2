        <p><span class="font1">The Etruscans used very largely the gold swivel ring mounted with a
                scarab, a form of signet probably introduced from&nbsp;Egypt. Some found in Etruscan
                tombs have real&nbsp;Egyptian scarabs with legible hieroglyphs;
                others,&nbsp;probably the work of Phoenician or native engravers,&nbsp;have rude
                copies of hieroglyphs, either quite or partially illegible.&nbsp;A third and more
                numerous class of Etruscan signet rings have&nbsp;scarabs, cut usually in sard or
                carnelian; which are a link&nbsp;between the art of Egypt and that of Greece, the
                design cut&nbsp;on the flat side being Hellenic in style,&nbsp;while the back is
                shaped like the&nbsp;ordinary Egyptian scarabaeus beetle.&nbsp;One from Etruria, now
                in the British&nbsp;Museum, is formed by two minutely&nbsp;modelled lions whose
                bodies form the&nbsp;hoop, while their paws hold the&nbsp;bezel, a scarab engraved
                with a lion&nbsp;of heraldic character. An alternative type of Etruscan ring (as
                in&nbsp;fig. 5) has an,incised design on the&nbsp;gold Bezel, or a flat stone set in
                the&nbsp;rigid bezel. In either case the Etruscan rings tend to ex</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">travagance in size and elaboration.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The Romans appear to have imitated the simplicity of Lacedaemonia.
                Throughout the republic none but iron rings&nbsp;were worn by the bulk of the
                citizens, and even these&nbsp;were forbidden to slaves. Ambassadors were the
                first&nbsp;who were privileged to wear gold rings, and then only&nbsp;while
                performing some public duty. Next senators, consuls,&nbsp;equites and all the chief
                officers of state received the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"

                collections of&nbsp;antique rings were made, and were frequently offered as
                gifts&nbsp;in the temples of Rome. One of the largest and most valuable&nbsp;of the

                class="font1"> was dedicated in the temple of Apollo&nbsp;Palatinus by Augustus’s
                nephew Marcellus (Pliny, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"

                contained&nbsp;another; in this collection was the celebrated ring of
                Polycrates,&nbsp;king of Samos, the story of which is told by Herodotus;
                Pliny,</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">however, doubts the authenticity of this relic </span><span

                2).</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Different laws as to the wearing of rings existed during the empire:
                Tiberius made a large property qualification necessary&nbsp;for the wearing of gold
                rings in the case of those who were not&nbsp;of free descent (Pliny, </span><span
                class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">H.N.</span><span class="font1"> xxxiii. 8)
                ; Severus conceded the right&nbsp;to all Roman soldiers; and later still all free
                citizens possessed the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
                >jus annuli aurei,</span><span class="font1"> silver rings being worn by freedmen
                and iron by&nbsp;slaves. Under Justinian even these restrictions passed
            away.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">In the rings of the Roman period the decoration is no longer an
                accessory of the bezel alone. It modifies the form of the&nbsp;hoop, which may be
                polygonal or angular (see fig. 6). The&nbsp;ring here figured is set with an eye, as
                an amulet, capable of&nbsp;turning on a swivel.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">In the 3rd and 4th centuries Roman rings were made engraved with
                Christian symbols. Fig. 7 shows two silver rings of the latter part of the 4th
                century which were found in 1881&nbsp;concealed in a hole in the pavement of a Roman
                villa at Fifehead</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Neville, Dorset, together with some coins of the same period. Both
                have the monogram of Christ, and one has a dove within an&nbsp;olive wreath rudely
                cut on the silver bezel. These rings are of&nbsp;special interest, as Roman objects
                with any Christian device&nbsp;have very rarely been found in Britain.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Fig. 8 is a choice example of a gold key-ring of the Christian
                period, with good wishes inscribed in pierced gold work—</span><span class="font1"

        <p><span class="font1">Fig. 9 is a gold ring from Smyrna (Brit. Mus.) with seven incised
                intaglio medallions, with a figure of Christ on the bezel.&nbsp;Assigned to the 5th

        <p><span class="font1">Large numbers of gold rings have been found in many parts of Europe
                in the tombs of early Celtic races. They are usually&nbsp;of very pure gold, often
                penannular in form—with a&nbsp;slight break, that is, in the hoop so as to form
                a&nbsp;spring. They are often of gold wire formed into a&nbsp;sort of rope, or else
                a simple bar twisted in an ornamental&nbsp;way. Some of the quite plain penannular
                rings were used in&nbsp;the place of coined money.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Throughout the MiddleAges the signet ring was a thing of great
                importance in religious, legal, commercial and private matters.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The episcopal ring@@<sup>1</sup> was solemnly conferred upon the newly
                made bishop together with his crozier, a special formula for&nbsp;this being
                inserted in the Pontifical. In the earliest&nbsp;references to rings worn by
                bishops, there is nothing&nbsp;to distinguish them from other signet rings.

                class="font1"> 610 the first mention has been found of the episcopal ring&nbsp;as a
                well-understood symbol of dignity. It is clear that it&nbsp;was derived from the
                signet. It was only in the 12th century&nbsp;and onwards that it was brought into
                mystical connexion with&nbsp;the marriage ring. In the time of Innocent III. (1194)
                the&nbsp;ring was ordered to be of pure gold mounted with a stone that&nbsp;was not
                engraved; but this rule appears not to have been&nbsp;strictly kept. Owing to the
                custom of burying the episcopal&nbsp;ring in its owner’s coffin, a great many fine
                examples still exist.&nbsp;Among the splendid collection of rings formed by the
                distinguished naturalist Edmund Water-</span></p>

        <p><span class="font1">was mounted in the bishop’s ring, and often an inscription was added
                in the gold setting of the gem to give a Christian name to the pagan figure. The
