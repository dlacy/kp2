a district in the Tenasserim division of British Burmah, extending from the northern portion of the province southwards to Kaw-ka-rit on the Salwin river, and occupying the whole of the country between that river on the east and the Poung-loung mountains on the west. The district contains an area of about 4646 square miles, and is bounded on the north by the Kareng-ni state, on the east by Zeng-mai, on the south by Amherst and Shwe-gyeng and on the west by Shwe- gyeng and Toung-gnú. From the annexation of Pegu until 1872 the Hill Tracts formed a subdivision of the Shwe-gyeng district, but in that year it was constituted into a separate jurisdiction. Nearly the whole district is a mass of mountains intersected by deep ravines, the only level land of any considerable extent being found in the valley of the Rwon-za-leng, while every part of the country is covered with dense forest.</p><p>The Hill Tracts are drained by three principal rivers, the Salwin, Rwon-za-leng, and Bhi-leng, fed by numerous mountain torrents which rush down narrow ravines. The Salwin is the largest river in the Tenasserim division. Its source has never been explored, but it appears to take its rise far north in the Himalayas or in the mountains which form their extension eastward. After traversing the Chinese province of Yunnan and the Shan and Kareng-ni states to the south, it enters British Burmah at its extreme north- eastern corner, and for some distance marks the eastern limits of the province. It has a known course of about 700 miles, but its breadth seldom exceeds 100 yards, and in some parts the bed does not occupy more than 30 yards. The Salwin is greatly obstructed by rapids, and is not navigable by large craft for more than 100 miles from its mouth. The Rwon-za-leng, which rises in the extreme north, is navigable with some difficulty in the dry season as far as Pa-pwon, the administrative headquarters ; the Bhi-leng is not navigable within the limits of the district except by small boats and rafts.</p><p>Of the total area of the district only 21 square miles are cultivated ; the chief crops are rice and betel-nuts. The revenue of Salwin amounted in 1883-84 to only £1964, of which £940 were raised from the land-tax. The population in 1881 was returned at 30,009 (males 15,509, females 14,500).</p></div></body></text></TEI>
