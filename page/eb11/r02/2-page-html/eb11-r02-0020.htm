<p><span class="font1">numismatics, and his letters on Arabic coinage (in Eichhorn s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Repertorium,</span><span class="font1"> vols, ix.-xi.) form, according to Dc Sacy, the basis&nbsp;of that branch of study. To comprehensive knowledge and very&nbsp;wide reading he added a sound historical judgment. He was not,&nbsp;like Schultcns, deceived by the pretended antiquity of the Yemenite&nbsp;KasIdas.@@<sup>1</sup> Errors no doubt he made, as in the attempt to ascertain&nbsp;the date of the breach of the dam of Marib.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Though Abulfeda as a late epitomator did not afford a starting-point for methodical study of the sources, Reiske’s edition with his version and notes certainly laid the foundation for research in Arabic&nbsp;history. The foundation of Arabic philology, however, was laid not&nbsp;by him but by De Sacy. Reiske’s linguistic knowledge was great,&nbsp;but he used it only to understand his authors; he had no feeling for&nbsp;form, for language as language, or for metre.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In Leipzig Rciske worked mainly at Greek, though he continued to draw on his Arabic stores accumulated in Leiden. Yet his merit&nbsp;as an Arabist was sooner recognized than the value of his Greek&nbsp;work. Reiske the Greek scholar has been rightly valued only in&nbsp;recent years, and it is now recognized that he was the first German&nbsp;since Sylburg who had a living knowledge of the. Greek tongue. His&nbsp;reputation, does not rest on his numerous.editions, often hasty or&nbsp;even made to booksellers’ orders, but in his remarks, especially his&nbsp;conjectures. He himself designates the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Animadversationes in&nbsp;Scriptores Graecos asflos ingenii sui,</span><span class="font1"> and in truth these thin booklets&nbsp;outweigh his big editions. Closely following the author’s thought&nbsp;he removes obstacles whenever he meets them, but he is so steeped&nbsp;in the language and thinks so truly like a Greek that the difficulties&nbsp;he feels often seem to us to. lie in mere points of style. His criticism&nbsp;is empirical and unmethodic, based on immense and careful reading,&nbsp;and applied only when he feels a difficulty; and he is most successful&nbsp;when he has a large mass of tolerably homogeneousjiterature to lean&nbsp;on, whilst on isolated points he is often at a loss. His corrections&nbsp;are often hasty and false, but a surprisingly large proportion of&nbsp;them have since received confirmation from MSS. And, though&nbsp;his merits as a Grecian lie mainly in his conjectures, his realism is&nbsp;felt in this sphere also; his German translations especially show more&nbsp;freedom and practical insight, more feeling for actual life, than is&nbsp;common with the scholars of.that age.@@<sup>2</sup></span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RÉJANE, GABRIELLE [Charlotte Reju] (1857- ), French actress, was born in Paris, the daughter of an actor.&nbsp;She was a pupil of Rcgnier at the Conservatoire, and took the&nbsp;second prize for comedy in 1874. Her </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">debut</span><span class="font0"> was made the next&nbsp;year, during which she played attractively a number of light—&nbsp;especially soubrette—parts. Her first great success was in&nbsp;Henri Meilhac’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ma camarade</span><span class="font0"> (1883), and she soon became&nbsp;known as an emotional actress of rare gifts, notably in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Decorê,&nbsp;Germinie Lacerteux, Ma cousine. Amoureuse</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Lysistrata.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">In 1892 she married M. Porel, the director of the Vaudeville&nbsp;theatre, but the marriage was dissolved in 1905. Her performances in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Madame Sans Gène</span><span class="font0"> (1893) made her as well&nbsp;known in England and America as in Paris, and in later years&nbsp;she appeared in characteristic parts in both countries, being&nbsp;particularly successful in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Zaza</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">La Passerelle.</span><span class="font0"> She opened&nbsp;the Theatre Rejane in Paris in 1906.

<p><span class="font0">RELAPSING FEVER </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Febris recurrens),</span><span class="font0"> the name given to a specific infectious disease occasionally appearing as an epidemic&nbsp;in communities suffering from scarcity or famine. It is characterized mainly by its sudden invasion, with violent febrile&nbsp;symptoms, which continue for about a week and end in a&nbsp;crisis, but are followed, after another week, by a return of the&nbsp;fever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This disease has received many other names, the best known of which are famine fever, seven-day, bilious relapsing fever,&nbsp;and spirillum fever. As in the case of typhoid, relapsing fever&nbsp;was long believed to be simply a form of typhus. The distinction&nbsp;between them appears to have been first clearly established&nbsp;in 1826, in connexion with an epidemic in Ireland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Relapsing fever is highly contagious. With respect to the nature of the contagion, certain important observations have been made&nbsp;(see also Parasitic Diseases). In 1873 Obermeier discovered in&nbsp;the blood of persons suffering from relapsing fever minute organisms&nbsp;in the form of spiral filaments of the genus </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Spirochaete,</span><span class="font1"> measuring&nbsp;in length to inch and in breadth mimr to nrijni inch, and&nbsp;possessed of rotatory or twisting movements. This organism&nbsp;received the name of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Spirillutn ObermeierL</span><span class="font1"> Fritz Schaudinn' has&nbsp;brought forward evidence that it is an animal parasite. The most&nbsp;constantly recognized factor in the origin and spread of relapsing&nbsp;fever is destitution; but this cannot be regarded as more than a&nbsp;predisposing cause, since in many lands widespread and destructive&nbsp;famines have prevailed without any outbreak of this fever. Instances, too, have becn recorded where epidemics were distinctly&nbsp;associated with overcrowding rather than with privation. Relapsing&nbsp;fever is most commonly met with in the young. One attack does&nbsp;not appear to protect from others, but rather, according to some&nbsp;authorities, engenders liability.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The incubation of the disease is about one week. The symptoms of the fever then show themselves with great abruptness and violence&nbsp;by a rigor, accompanied with pains in the limbs and severe headache. The febrile phenomena are very marked, and the temperature quickly rises to a high point (1O5°-1O7° Fahr.), at which it continues with little variation, whilc the pulse is rapid (100-140),&nbsp;full and strong. There is intense thirst, a dry brown tongue,&nbsp;bilious vomiting, tenderness over the liver and spleen, and occasionally jaundice. Sometimes a peculiar bronzy appearance of the&nbsp;skin is noticed, but there is no characteristic rash as in typhus.&nbsp;There is much prostration of strength. After the continuance of&nbsp;these symptoms for a period of from five to seven days, the temperature suddenly falls to the normal point or below it, the pulse&nbsp;becomes correspondingly slow, and a profuse perspiration occurs,&nbsp;while the severe headache disappears and the appetite returns.&nbsp;Except for a sense of weakness, the patient feels well and may&nbsp;even return to work, but in some cases there remains a condition of&nbsp;great debility, accompanied with rheumatic pains in the limbs.&nbsp;This state of freedom from fever continues for about a week, when&nbsp;there occurs a well-marked relapse with scarcely less abruptness&nbsp;and severity than in the first attack, and the whole symptoms&nbsp;are of the same character, but they do not, as a rule, continue so&nbsp;long, and they terminate in a crisis in three or four days, after&nbsp;which convalescence proceeds satisfactorily. Second, third and&nbsp;even fourth relapses, however, may occur in exceptional cases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The mortality in relapsing fever is comparatively small, about 5% being the average death-rate in epidemics (Murchison).&nbsp;The fatal cases occur mostly from the complications common to&nbsp;continued fevers. The treatment is essentially the same as that&nbsp;for typhus fever. Lowcnthal and Gabritochewsky by using the&nbsp;serum of an immune horse succeeded in averting the relapse in 40%&nbsp;of cases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RELATIVITY OF KNOWLEDGE, a philosophic term which was much used by the philosophers of the middle of the 19th&nbsp;century, and has since fallen largely into disuse. It deserves&nbsp;explanation, however, not only because it has occupied so large&nbsp;a space in the writings of some great British thinkers, but also&nbsp;because the main question for which it stands is still matter of&nbsp;eager debate. We get at the meaning of the term most easily&nbsp;by considering what it is that “ relativity ” is opposed to.&nbsp;“ Relativity ” of knowledge is opposed to absoluteness or&nbsp;positiveness of knowledge. Now there are two senses in which&nbsp;knowledge may claim to be absolute. The knower may say, “ I&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">know</span><span class="font0"> this absolutely,’ or he may say, “ I know </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">this</span><span class="font0"> absolutely.”&nbsp;With the emphasis upon the “ know ” he asserts that his knowledge of the matter in question cannot be affected by anything&nbsp;whatever. “ I know absolutely that two and two are four ”&nbsp;makes an assertion about the knower’s intellectual state: he is&nbsp;convinced that his certain knowledge of the result of adding two&nbsp;to two is independent of any other piece of knowledge.
