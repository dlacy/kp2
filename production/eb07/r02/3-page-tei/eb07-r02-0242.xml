Thus the planets have a progressive motion, or a motion of translation, in the orbits which they describe about the sun, while at the same time each revolves about an axis which passes through its centre of gravity.</hi></p><p>In consequence of this double motion of the planetary bodies, the two great problems in physical astronomy are, first, to determine the orbit described in space by each body under the influence of the sun’s attraction, but disturbed by the attraction of every other body in tlle system ; and, secondly, to determine the circumstances of the rotation of each body under the influence of the same disturbing forces. This last problem is not of less importance or difficulty than the first. In the case of the earth it includes the determination of the precession of the equinoxes and the nutation of the axis under the disturbing action of the sun and moon ; and its analysis has led to the discovery of two important facts connected with the physical constitution of the universe, namely, the invariability of the length of the day, and the permanence of tlle poles of rotation on the earth’s surface.</p><p>But tlle problem of determining the rotation of a solid body is not merely interesting in consequence of its forming a principal part of physical astronomy ; it is also one of the highest importance in practical mechanics ; for the principles to which we are led in considering the general theory of rotatory motion, enable us to determine the effect or performance of machines, and the proper relations and most advantageous disposition of their several parts, in order to accomplish the object in view with the smallest waste of force, and the least strain or injury to the machine itself.</p><p>In treating the subject, we shall first endeavour to demonstrate the fundamental propositions of rotatory motion in as elementary a manner as possible ; secondly, we shall show the methods of computing the inertia of bodies of different forms, and the properties of principal axes ; thirdly, we shall consider the motion of a body which revolves about a fixed axis, and the properties of the centres of gyration, percussion, and oscillation ; and, lastly, we shall give the general equations which determine the rotation of a body acted upon by any number of forces, and which is at liberty to move in any direction.</p><p>1.    When a solid body, or system of material particles, so connected that their mutual distances remain invariable, turns round an axis, every particle describes a circle having its centre in the axis, and its plane perpendicular to the axis ; and at every instant of the motion the particle is in the direction of a tangent to the circle, or in a straight line perpendicular to its radius vector. In order, therefore, to ascertain the direction of the motion of any particle of the system, we have only to draw a straight line from the particle perpendicular to the axis of rotation. This line will lie in the plane of the circle, and be its radius vector ; and the perpendicular to the radius vector at its extremity gives the direction of the motion of the particle.</p><p>2.    Since the system is supposed to be invariable in form, every particle describes the circumference of a circle in precisely the same instant of time ; and as this is also true of any given portion of the circumference, it follows that the absolute velocities of the different particles are proportional to their distances from the axis of rotation. Hence, if <hi rend="italic">w</hi>  denote tlle velocity of the particle whose radius vector or distance from the axis = 1, then <hi rend="italic">rw</hi>  is the velocity of the particle whose distance from the axis = r. The velocity denoted by to is called the <hi rend="italic">angular velocity of</hi>  the body ; and the rotations of different bodies are compared in respect of velocity by comparing their angular velocities.</p><p>3.    The nature of the forces which connect the different particles or atoms of a solid body, and render it impossible for any single particle to change its position without a corresponding change in the positions of all the other particles, is very obscurely known ; but whatever their nature may be, there is one general fact or law, established by unexcepted experience, which affords a sufficient foundation for a dynamical theory, namely, that the forces by which the particles of a body act reciprocally on each other are equal. An immediate consequence of this law is, that when a solid body is in equilibrium between two external forces A and B, these forces are equal and opposite ; for the force A being in immediate equilibrium with the opposite forces exerted by that particle of tlle solid body to which it is applied, must therefore be equal and opposite to the force resulting from the combination of all the forces which connect that particle with the series of particles immediately adjoining. In like manner, the compound force by which this first series of particles acts on tllat to which the external force A is applied, is equal and opposite to the compound force which connects this first series with the next series, and so on until we come to the particle to which the external force B is immediately applied. And this particle being in equilibrium, the external force applied to it must be equal and opposite to the compound force exerted on it by the series of contiguous particles on that side ; therefore the two forces A and B are equal and opposite.</p><p>Hence it follows, that when any number of external forces are applied to a solid body, and it is in equilibrium between them, the forces are such as would be in equilibrium if they were all applied at one point.</p><p>4.    If a body is maintained in equilibrium by the action of three forces, these forces lie in the same plane, and are either parallel, or meet in the same point. This follows immediately from the composition of forces ; for the forces being in equilibrium, any one of the three must be equal and opposite to the equivalent, or <hi rend="italic">resultant,</hi>  as it is termed, of the other two ; and this resultant is the diagonal of a parallelogram of which the other two <hi rend="italic">component</hi>  forces are the sides. But the diagonal and sides of a parallelogram are in the same plane, therefore the third force is in the plane of the other two ; and, further, since it is equal and opposite to the resultant of the other two, it must be in the same straight line, and consequently pass through their point of concourse. These simple propositions are the foundation of the theory of statics.</p><p>5.    In applying these propositions to explain the motion of rotation, we must recollect a fundamental theorem in dynamics, that the force which produces any motion is equal and opposite to the force which would prevent it, if applied at the same point, and in the same straight line, or which would extinguish the motion in the same time in which we suppose it to be produced. The force therefore which, acting on any particle, causes the body to revolve about an axis with a given angular velocity, is equal to the force which, if applied at the same point in the opposite direction, would reduce the body to a state of rest in the same time as was necessary to produce the given velocity.</p><p>6.    The only distinct notion we can form of the intensity of any moving force, is the quantity of motion which</p><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
