<p><span class="font0">forming </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font0"> angle at « of 135 degrees; this ſolid, though more capacious than the included ſolid, will&nbsp;be lefs leſiſted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">And, from the fame principles, Sir Iſaac Newtcn determined the form of the curve ADB which would&nbsp;generate the ſolid which, of all others of the ſame&nbsp;length and baſ¢, ſhould have the leaſt reſiſtance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Theſe are curious and important deductions, but are not introduced here, for reafons which will ſoon ap-</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">pear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The reader cannot fail to obſerve, that all that we ⅛tve hitherto delivered on this ſubject, relates to the&nbsp;comparιfon </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font0">different impulſes or refinances. we&nbsp;have always compared the oblique impulfions with the&nbsp;direct, and by their intervention we compare the ob-lique impulſions with each other. But it remains to&nbsp;give abſolute meaſures of ſome individual impulſion ;&nbsp;to which, as to an unit, we may refer every other.&nbsp;And as it is by their preſſure that they become uſe-ful or hurtful, and they muſt be oppoſed by other&nbsp;preſſures, it becomes extremely convenient to compare&nbsp;them all with that preſſure with which we are moſt&nbsp;familiarly acquainted, the preſſure of gravity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The manner in which the companion is made, is this, when a body advances in a fluid with a known&nbsp;velocity, it puts a known quantity of the fluid into&nbsp;motion (as is fuppoſed) with this velocity ; and this is&nbsp;done in a known time, we have only to examine&nbsp;what weight will put this quantity of fluid into the&nbsp;fume motion, by acting on it during the ſame time.&nbsp;This weight is conceived as equal to the reſiſtance.&nbsp;Thus, let us fuppoſe that a ſtream of water, moving&nbsp;at the rate of eight feet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">per</span><span class="font0"> ſecond, is perpendicularly&nbsp;obſtructed by a ſquare foot of folid furface held faſt in&nbsp;its place. Conceiving water to act in the manner of&nbsp;the hypothetical fluid now defcribed, and to be without elaſticity, the whole effect is the gradual annihilation of the motion of eight cubic feet of water </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">mo-</span><span class="font0">ving eight feet in a ſecond. And this is done in a ſe-cond of time. It is equivalent to the gradually put-</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ting </span><span class="font0">eight cubic feet of' water into motion with this&nbsp;velocity ; and doing this by acting uniformly during&nbsp;a fecond. what weight is able to produce this effect ? The weight of eight feet of water, acting du-ring a ſecond on it, will, as is well known, give it the&nbsp;velocity of thirty-two feet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">per</span><span class="font0"> ſecond ; that is, four&nbsp;times greater. Therefore, the weight of the fourth part&nbsp;of eight cubic feet, that is, the weight of two cubic feet,&nbsp;acting during a ſecond, will do the fame thing, or the&nbsp;weight of </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font0">column of water whoſe bafe is a ſquare&nbsp;foot, and whofe height is two feet. This will not&nbsp;©nly produce this effect in the ſame time with the impulſion of the ſolid body, but it will alſo do it by the&nbsp;fame degrees, as any one will clearly perceive, by at-tending to the gradual acceleration of the mafs of water urged by ∣ of its weight, and comparing this with&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font0">gradual production or extinction of motion in the&nbsp;fluid by the progreſs of the reſiſted ſurface.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Now it is well known that 8 cubic feet of water, by felling one foot, which it will do in one-fourth of a fe-¢ond, will acquire the velocity of eight feet per ſecond&nbsp;by its weight ; therefore the force which produces the&nbsp;feme effect in </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font0">whole ſecond is one-fourth of this. This&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ferce is therefore equal to the </span><span class="font0">weight of </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a column of</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font0">water, whofe baſe is a ſquare foot, and whoſe height is two feet} that is, twice the height neceffary for acquiring the velocity of the motion by gravity. The con-cluſion is the ſame whatever be the ſurface that is reſiſted, whatever be the fluid that reſiſts, and whatever be&nbsp;the velocity of the motion. In this inductive and fa-miliar manner we learn, that </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">the direct impulfe or rfifi-ance of an unelajlicfiuid on any plane ſurface, is equal to the&nbsp;weight of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">column of the fiuid having the furface for its&nbsp;bafe, and twice the fall necejfary for acquiring the velocity&nbsp;of the motion for its height :</span><span class="font0"> and if the fluid is conſidered as elaſtic, the impulſe or refiſtance is twice as great.&nbsp;See Newt. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Princip.</span><span class="font0"> B. II. prop. 35. and 38.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It now remains to compare this theory with experi-ment. Many have been made, both by Sir Ifaac Newton and by ſubſequent writers. It is much to be la-mented, that in a matter of fuch importance, both to the philofopher and to the artiſt, there is ſuch a difa-greement in the reſults with each other, we ſliall&nbsp;mention the experiments which ſeem to have been made&nbsp;with the greateſt judgment and care. Thoſe of Sir&nbsp;Iſaac Newton were chiefly made by the oſcillations of&nbsp;pendulums in water, and by the deſcent of balls both in&nbsp;water and in air. Many have been made by Mariotte&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Traité de Mouvement des Eaux).</span><span class="font0"> Gravefande has pub-liihed, in his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Syfiem of Natural Philoſophy,</span><span class="font0"> experiments&nbsp;made on the reſiſtance or impulſions on ſolids in thc&nbsp;midſt of a pipe or canal. They are extremely well con-trived, but are on ſo fmall a ſcale that they are of very&nbsp;little uſe. Daniel Bernoulli, and his pupil Profeffor&nbsp;Krafft, have publiſtied, in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Comment. Acad. PetropοI&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">experiments on the impulſe of a ſtream or vein of water&nbsp;from an oriſice or tube: Theſe are of great value. The&nbsp;Abbé Boffut has publiihed others of the ſame kind in&nbsp;his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hydrodynamique.</span><span class="font0"> Mr Robins has publiſhed, in life&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">New Principles of Gunnery,</span><span class="font0"> many valuable experiments&nbsp;on the impulſe and reſiſtance of air. The Chev. de&nbsp;Borda, in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mem. Acad. Paris,</span><span class="font0"> 1763 and 1767, has&nbsp;given experiments on the reſiſtance of air and alſo of&nbsp;water, which are very intereſting. The moſt complete&nbsp;collection of experiments on the reſiſtance of water are&nbsp;thoſe made at the public expence by a committee of the&nbsp;academy of ſciences, conſiſting of the marquis de Condorcet, Mr d’Alembert, Abbe Boffut, and others. The&nbsp;Chev. de Buat, in his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hydraulique,</span><span class="font0"> has publiihed ſome</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">moſt curious and valuable experiments, where many im-portant circumftances are taken notice of, which had never been attended to before, and which give a view&nbsp;of the ſubject totally different from what is uſually ta-ken of it. Don George d’Ulloa, in his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Examine Ma-ritimo,</span><span class="font0"> has alſo given ſome important experiments, ſimilar to thoſe adduced by Bougeur in his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Manœuvre des&nbsp;Vaiffeaux,</span><span class="font0"> but leading to very different concluſions. All&nbsp;theſe ihould be conſulted by ſuch as would acquire a&nbsp;practical knowledge of this ſubject. we muſt content&nbsp;ourſelves with giving their moſt general and ſteady re-ſults. Such as,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">I. </span><span class="font0">It is very conſonant to experiment that the reſiſtances are proportional to the ſquares of the velocities,&nbsp;when the velocities of water do not exceed a few feet&nbsp;per ſecond, no ſenſible deviation is obferved. In very&nbsp;ſmall velocities the reſiſtances are fenſibly greater than&nbsp;in this proportion, and this exceſs is plainly owing to&nbsp;the viſcidity or imperfect fluidity </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font0">water.
