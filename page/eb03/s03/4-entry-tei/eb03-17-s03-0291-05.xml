(Ptolemy) : a people of the Farther Aſia ; bounded on the west by Scythia extra Imaum ; on the north and eaſt, by Terra Incognita ; and on the south, by India extra Gangem. According to theſe limits, their country anſwers nearly to Cathoy or North China. Other authors vary greatly in placing them, though, the generality agree in placing them far to the eaſt. Mela places them between the Indi and Scythæ ; and perhaps beyond the Indi, if we diſtinguiſh the Sinas from them. The ancients commend them for their cotton manufactures, different from the produce of the bombyces or silk-worms, called <hi rend="italic">fires</hi> by the Greeks: whence serica "silk.”</p></div></body></text></TEI>
