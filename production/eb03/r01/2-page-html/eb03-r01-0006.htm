<p><span class="font4">RADCLIFFE (Dr John), an Engliſh phyſician of great eminence in his time, born at wakefield in&nbsp;Yorkſhire in 1650. He was educated at oxford, and&nbsp;enrolled himſelf upon the phyfical line; but it was re-markable that he recommended himſelf more by his&nbsp;ready wit and vivacity, than by any extraordinary ac-qniſitions in learning. He began to practiſe at oxford&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font4">1675; but never paid any regard to eſtabliſhed rules,&nbsp;which he cenfured whenever he thought fit, with great&nbsp;freedom and acrimony ; and as this drew all the old&nbsp;,<sub>w</sub> practitioners upon him, he lived in a continual ſtate of&nbsp;hoſtility with them. Nevertheleſs, his reputation in-creaſed with his experience; ſo that, before he had been&nbsp;two years in buſinefs, his practice was very extenſive&nbsp;among perfons of high rank. In 1684 he removed to&nbsp;London, and fettled in Bow-ſtreet, Covent Garden,&nbsp;where in leſs than a year he got into prime buſineſs. —&nbsp;In 1687 the princeſs Anne of Denmark made him&nbsp;her phyſician : yet when her huſhand and ſhe joined the&nbsp;prince of orange, Radcliffe, either not chooſing to declare himſelf, or unwilling to favour the meafures then&nbsp;in agitation, excufed himſelf from attending them, on&nbsp;the plea of the multitude of his patients. Nevertheleſs,&nbsp;he was often ſent for to King william and other great&nbsp;perfonages, though he did not incline to be a courtier.&nbsp;He incurred ſome cenſure for his treatment of Q^Mary,&nbsp;who died of the finall-pox ; and ſoon aſter loſt his place&nbsp;about the princeſs Anne, by his attachment to his bottle.&nbsp;He alſo totally loſt the favour of K. william by his un-courtly freedom ; for, in 1699, when the king ſhowed</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">him his ſwollen ankles, while the reſt of his body was emaciated, and aſked him what he thought of them ?&nbsp;&quot; why truly I would not have your majeſty’s two legs&nbsp;for your three kingdoms,” replied Radcliffe. He continued increafing in buſineſs and inſolence as long as he&nbsp;lived, continually at war with his brethren the phyſi-cians ; who conſidered him in no other light than that&nbsp;of an act ive ingenious empiric, whom conſtant practice&nbsp;had at ∖ ngth brought to ſome degree of ſkill in his&nbsp;profeffi<sup>c</sup>⅛. He died in 1714; and if he never attempt-• td to wrſte any thing himſelf, has perpetuated hie me-mory by founding a fine library </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">at Oxford, </span><span class="font4">to preſerve&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">writings of other </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">men.</span></p>

It is a very ancient borough-town, whoſe juriſdiction extends near 12 miles round about : the go-vernment of it is veſted in a bailiff and 25 burgeſſes.&nbsp;Though it is the county-town, the affizes are held at&nbsp;Preſteign: it has one privilege, however, that is very extraordinary, beſides that of fending one member to par-liament ; and that is, it keeps a court of pleas for all&nbsp;actions, without being limited to any particular ſum..&nbsp;It was formerly fenced with a wall and a ſtrong caſtle ⅛&nbsp;but both were in a great meaſure demoliſhed by ûwen&nbsp;Gleπdower, when he aſſumed the title of Prince of&nbsp;wales, upon the depoſition of King Richard II. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">W.&nbsp;</span><span class="font4">Long. 2. 45.

It is ſeat-ed in the dioceſe of Hereford, and fends two members&nbsp;to parliament, one for the county and one for the town&nbsp;of Radnor. The air of this county is in winter cold&nbsp;and piercing. The foil in general is but indifferent j&nbsp;yet ſome places produce corn, particularly the eaſtern&nbsp;and fouthern parts ; but in the northern and weſtern,&nbsp;which are mountainous, the land is chiefly ſtocked with&nbsp;homed cattle, ſheep, and goats.</span></p>
