            <p>SHIFTERS, on hoard a man of war, certain men who are employed by the cooks to ſhift
                and change the water in which the fleſh or fiſh is put, and laid for ſome time, in
                order to fit it for the kettle.</p>
            <p>SHIFTING <hi rend="smallcaps">a tackle,</hi> in ſealanguage, the act of removing the
                blocks of a tackle to a greater diſtance from each other, on the object to which
                they are applied, in order to give a greater ſcope or extent to their purchaſe. This
                operation is otherwiſe called <hi rend="italic">fleeting. </hi>Shifting the helm
                denotes the alteration of its poſition, by puſhing it towards the oppoſite fide of
                the ſhip. Shitting the voyal, ſignifies changing its poſition on the capſtern, from
                the right to the left, and <hi rend="italic">vice verſa.</hi></p>
            <p>SHILLING, an Engliſh ſilver coin, equal to twelve pence, or the twentieth part of a
                pound.</p>
            <p>Freherus derives the Saxon sch<hi rend="italic">illing,</hi> whence our ſhilling,
                from a corruption of si<hi rend="italic">liqua ;</hi> proving the derivation by
                ſeveral texts of law, and, among others, by the 26th law, <hi rend="italic">De
                    annuis legatis.</hi> Skinner deduces it from the Saxon scild “ ſhield,” by
                reaſon of the eſcutcheon of arms thereon.</p>
            <p>Biſhop Hooper derives it from the Arabic sc<hi rend="italic">hecle,</hi> ſignifying
                    <hi rend="italic">a weight ;</hi> but others, with greater probability, deduce
                it from the Latin <hi rend="italic">ſicilicus,</hi> which ſignified in that language
                    a<hi rend="italic"> quarter oſ an ounce,</hi> or the 48th part of a Roman pound.
                In confirmation of this etymology it is alleged, that the ſhilling kept its original
                ſignification, and bore the ſame proportion to the Saxon pound as ſicilicus did to
                the Roman and the Greek, being exactly the 48th part of the Saxon pound ; a
                diſcovery which we owe to Mr Lambarde@@*,</p>
            <p>However, the Saxon laws reckon the pound in the round number at 50 ſhillings, but
                they really coined out of it only 48 ; the value of the ſhilling was five- pence ;
                but it was reduced to fourpence above a century before the conqueſt ; for ſeveral of
                the Saxon laws, made in Athelſtan’s reign, oblige us to take this eſtimate. Thus it
                continued to the Norman times, as one of the Conqueror’s laws ſufficiently
                aſeertains ; and it seems to have been the common coin by which the Engliſh payments
                were adjuſted. After the conqueſt, the French <hi rend="italic">ſolidus</hi> of
                twelvepence, which was in uſe among the Normans, was called by the Engliſh name of
                ſhilling ; and the Saxon ſhilling of fourpence took a Norman name, and was called
                the <hi rend="italic">groat,</hi> or great coin, becauſe it was the largeſt Engliſh
                coin then known in England.</p>
            <p>It has been the opinion of the biſhops Fleetwood and Gibſon, and of the antiquaries
                in general, that, though the method of reckoning by pounds, marks, and ſhillings, as
                well as by pence and farthings, had been in constant uſe even from the Saxon times,
                long before the Norman conqueſt, there never was ſuch a coin in England as either a
                pound or a mark, nor any ſhilling, till the year 1504 or 1505, when a few ſilver
                ſhillings or twelve-pences were coined, which have long ſince been ſolely confined
                to the cabinets of collectors.</p>
            <p>Mr Clarke combats this opinion, alleging that ſome coins mentioned by Mr Folkes,
                under Edward I. were probably Saxon ſhillings new minted, and that archbiſhop
                Aelfric expreſsly ſays@@*, that the Saxons had three names for their money, viz.
                mancuſes, ſhillings, and pennies. He alſo urges the different value of the Saxon
                ſhilling at different times, and its uniform proportion to the pound, as an argument
                that their ſhilling was a coin ; and the teſtimony of the Saxon gospels, in which
                the word we have tranſlated <hi rend="italic">pieces of silver</hi> is rendered
                    sh<hi rend="italic">illings,</hi> which, he says, they would hardly have done,
                if there had been no ſuch coin as a ſhilling then in uſe. Accordingly the Saxons
                expreſſed their ſhilling in Latin by <hi rend="italic">ſiclus</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">argenteus.</hi> He farther adds, that the Saxon ſhilling was never
                expreſſed by <hi rend="italic">ſolidus</hi> till after the Norman ſettlements in
                England ; and howsoever it altered during the long period that elapſed from the
                conqueſt to the time of Henry VII. it was the moſt conſtant denomination of money in
                all payments, though it was then only a species of account, or the twentieth part of
                the pound Sterling ; and when it was again revived as a coin, it leſſened gradually
                as the pound Sterling leſſened, from the 28th of Edward III. to the 43d of
                Elizabeth.</p>
            <p>In the year 1560 there was a peculiar fort of ſhilling ſtruck in Ireland, of the
                value of ninepence Engliſh, which paſſed in Ireland for twelvepence. The motto on
                the reverſe was, <hi rend="italic">poſui Deum adjutorem meum.</hi> Eighty-two of
                theſe ſhillings, according to Malynes, went to the pound ; they therefore weighed 20
                grains, one-fourth each, which is ſomewhat heavier in proportion than the Engliſh
                ſhilling of that time, 62 whereof went to the pound, each weighing 92 grains
                ſeven-eighths ; and the Iriſh ſhilling being valued at the Tower at ninepence
                Engliſh, that is, one-fourth part leſs than the Engliſh ſhilling, it ſhould
                therefore proportionably weigh one fourth part leſs, and its full weight be ſomewhat
                more than 62 grains ; but ſome of them found at this time, though much worn, weighed
                69 grains. In the year 1598, five different pieces of money of this kind were ſtruck
                in England for the ſervice of the kingdom of Ireland. Theſe were ſhillings to be
                current in Ireland at twelvepence each ; half ſhillings to be current at ſixpence,
                and quarter ſhillings at threepence. Pennies and halfpennies were alſo ſtruck of the
                ſame kind, and ſent over for the payment of the army in Ireland. The money thus
                coined was of a very baſe mixture of copper and ſilver ; and two years after there
                were more pieces of the ſame kinds ſtruck for the ſame ſervice, which were ſtill
                worſe ; the former being three ounces of ſilver to nine ounces of copper ; and theſe
                latter only two ounces eighteen pennyweights to nine ounces two pennyweights of the
                alloy.</p>
            <p>The Dutch, Fſemiſh, and Germans, have likewiſe their ſhilling, called sch<hi
                    rend="italic">elin, schilling, fralin,</hi> &amp;c. but theſe not being of the
                ſame weight or fineneſs with the Engliſh ſhilling, are not current at the ſame
                value. The Engliſh ſhilling is worth about 23 French ſols ; thoſe of Holland and
                Germany about 11 ſols and an half; thoſe of Flanders about nine. The Dutch ſhillings
                are alſo called <hi rend="italic">fols de gros,</hi> becauſe equal to twelve gros.
                The Danes have copper ſhillings worth about one- fourth of a farthing Sterling.</p>
            <p>SHILOH is a term famous among interpreters and commentators upon Scripture. It is
                found (Gen. xlix. 10.) to denote the Meſſiah, The patriarch Jacob foretels his
                coming in theſe words ; “ The ſceptre ſhall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver
                from between his feet, until Shiloh come ; and unto him ſhall the gathering of the
                people be.” The Hebrew text reads, ∏⅛if N3<hi rend="superscript">4</hi> ‘5 “Ψ until
                    <hi rend="italic">Shiloh come.</hi> All Chriſtian commentators agree, that this
                word ought to be underſtooſt of the Meſſiah, or Jeſus Chriſt ; but all are not
                agreed</p>
