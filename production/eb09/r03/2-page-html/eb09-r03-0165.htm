<p><span class="font1">the strength of the rope. In a bundle of fibres, equal in length and strength, fastened at the ends, each fibre&nbsp;will, upon a strain being applied to the bundle, bear&nbsp;its proper share of the stress; and the strength of the&nbsp;bundle will evidently be measured by adding together the&nbsp;strength of the separate fibres. But if this bundle is&nbsp;twisted so as to form a thread, the strain will no longer&nbsp;be equally distributed among the fibres, for, by the torsion, the external fibres of the bundle will be wound round&nbsp;those that lie nearest to the centrej and, in proportion&nbsp;to their distance from the heart of the bundle and the&nbsp;amount of twist given, will form spirals more or less&nbsp;inclined from the axis of the thread. The external&nbsp;fibres will in consequence be longer than the internal&nbsp;ones, and the greatest share of the strain will be borne&nbsp;by the latter. The depreciation in strength from twisting of hard woody fibres is greater than is the case with&nbsp;fine soft flexible fibres, such as common hemp of good&nbsp;quality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">To prevent the decay of ropes which are frequently exposed to water, the yarns of which they are composed&nbsp;are soaked in hot Archangel tar before they are formed&nbsp;into strands. Tarring, it is found, also seriously diminishes&nbsp;the strength of the .rope, but no other means of preventing&nbsp;water from penetrating and rotting the fibre has yet been&nbsp;found. M. Duhamel, from a series of investigations made&nbsp;in 1741-46, came to the conclusion that, apart from&nbsp;exposure to wet, untarred cordage in constant service&nbsp;was about oné-third more durable than tarred, that it&nbsp;retained its strength for a longer period when kept in&nbsp;store, and that it resisted the ordinary influences of the&nbsp;weather better than when it was tarred. Subsequent&nbsp;experience has fully borne out these conclusions, and now&nbsp;that Manila hemp, which withstands the influence of water&nbsp;well, is so extensively used for heavy cordage, tarring is&nbsp;no longer so generally practised in rope-making as was at&nbsp;one time the case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ropewalk Spinning.—The</span><span class="font0"> sequence of operations in this ancient but still greatly used method of working is—(1) heckling the&nbsp;fibre ; (2) spinning the yarn ; (3) tarring the yarn (when necessary) ; (4) forming the strands ; (5) laying the strands into ropes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Heckling differs in no way from the hand-heckling process used in the preparation of flax (see vol. xiv. p. 604-5). The heckle-board consists of a wooden plank, studded with strong tapered&nbsp;and sharp-pointed steel prongs. A series of such heckle-boards is&nbsp;used in the progressive heckling operation, the prongs diminishing&nbsp;in size and being closely set together. In drawing his “ stricks ” of&nbsp;fibre through these gradually diminishing heckles the workman not&nbsp;only combs out and disentangles the material, separating “tow”&nbsp;from “ line,” but he also splits up and makes finer the fibres upon&nbsp;which he operates. A little oil is sprinkled on the heckles in course&nbsp;of the process. The spinning is done in a covered and enclosed&nbsp;walk from 300 to 400 yards in length, at both ends of which the&nbsp;machines are placed. These (one variety of which is shown in fig.&nbsp;1) consist of a series of “whirls”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">d, d,</span><span class="font0"> generally twelve in number,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">set in a semicircular frame </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e.</span><span class="font0"> The</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">whirls are set in rapid rotation by</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">a belt which passes over them from</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">a wheel </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">bb</span><span class="font0"> ; or, what is now more</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">usual, they are driven by the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">direct friction of the wheel itself</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">pressed hard against them. The</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">point of the prolonged axis of</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">the whirl is bent into a hook,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">on which the ends of the fibre are</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">hung for spinning. Each spinner</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">carries around his waist a quan</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">tity of heckled fibre, and, fasten</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ing an end on the whirl hook, he</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">walks backward down the walk</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">jpving out even proportions of</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">fibre all the while and regulating</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">his pace so that the amount of</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">twist communicated to the yarn</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">is uniform. He draws the fibre from his waist with the left hand and lets it slip between the thumb and finger of the right, which,&nbsp;protected by a piece of woollen cloth, compresses and moulds into&nbsp;cylindrical form the yarn as it is spun. At intervals in the length&nbsp;of the walk there arc posts and rails supplied with hooks into&nbsp;which the spinner throws the yarn to keep it off the ground. The&nbsp;spinners commonly work from both ends in sets of six, and as each&nbsp;set arrives at the end of the walk the yarns spun by them are&nbsp;unhooked from the whirls, tied together at the ends, and collected&nbsp;in large hooks along the side of the walk till a haul of about four&nbsp;hundred yarns is accumulated. When tarred rope is to be made the&nbsp;haul of yarn is at this stage passed through a kettle of tar heated&nbsp;to about 212° Fahr., from which it is drawn through a nipping&nbsp;apparatus which squeezes out superfluous tar, leaving the yarn a&nbsp;bright brown colour soaked with about one-fourth its weight of tar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For “forming” strands the spun yarn is wound, each yarn separately, on bobbins and placed in a bobbin frame. From their&nbsp;bobbins the yarns are conducted through a concentric circle of&nbsp;holes in a steel register plate, behind which they come together&nbsp;and are pressed. through a trumpet-mouthed tube, which varies&nbsp;in diameter according to the diameter of the strand being formed ;&nbsp;and they are attached to the hooks of the forming machine or&nbsp;traveller. This machine travels down the ropewalk on rails moved&nbsp;by an endless rope passing over a grooved pulley, the hooks&nbsp;being at the same time set in rotation by gearing connected with&nbsp;the pulley. When the machine has reached the end of the walk&nbsp;and sufficient “twist” is given to the three strands, they are unhooked and hung together on the centre hook of the machine. A&nbsp;grooved conical block of wood called a “top” is inserted between&nbsp;the strands, one of which lies in each of the three equidistant concentric grooves. The strands at the fore-end are cut away and&nbsp;attached separately to three other hooks. The laying of the three&nbsp;strands into a hawser is now proceeded with by giving a reverse&nbsp;rotation to the central hook on which at the lower end they are&nbsp;hung. As twist is communicated to the strand between the top&nbsp;and the machine, the former is forced away towards the fore-end,&nbsp;and on the uniform motion outwards of the top depends the even&nbsp;and regular character of the lay. While the hook at the lower&nbsp;end is rotating in one direction to lay the strands, the three&nbsp;hooks holding the strands at the upper end are correspondingly&nbsp;revolved in the opposite direction to keep up the amount of twist&nbsp;in them which they would otherwise lose by the unwinding&nbsp;effect of the revolution of the laying hook. As the laying proceeds, the forming machine is gradually dragged up the rails owing&nbsp;to the shortening of the strands caused by twisting them into a&nbsp;hawser. The formation of a cable from three hawsers is effected&nbsp;in a similar manner ; but the great weight of material dealt with&nbsp;necessitates some modified operations to ensure uniformity of laying.&nbsp;In many rope-works distinct machinery is used for the strand laying and rope-forming operations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Machine or Faxtonj Rope-Making.—</span><span class="font0">The ropewalk system of manufacture has several inconveniences, among which, in towns,&nbsp;the most serious is the difficulty and expense of obtaining the long&nbsp;narrow strips of ground it requires. Hand-made ropes are also&nbsp;subject to certain irregularities of twist, and the yarns are less&nbsp;uniform than can be obtained from the operations of automatic&nbsp;machinery. Moreovei<sup>-</sup> in machine-spinning it is possible so to&nbsp;form the strands and lay the finished rope that any strain can be&nbsp;more equally distributed over all the fibres than can be done with&nbsp;hand-spinning and twisting. The essential feature of the factory&nbsp;system consists in having yarns, strands, and ropes wound upon&nbsp;bobbins or drums in each successive stage, the material being drawn&nbsp;direct from the reel to be twisted and immediately wound up again.&nbsp;The length of rope made is only limited by the carrying capacity&nbsp;of the drum on which it is finally wound.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The earliest practical attempt to introduce machine rope-spinning was made by Cartwright, the famous inventor of the power loom,—&nbsp;who, in 1792, obtained a patent for a machine called by him a&nbsp;“Cordelier.” Cartwright’s cordelier, as improved in 1805 by&nbsp;Captain Huddart, became the basis of modern laying and forming&nbsp;machines. Numerous modifications and improved combinations&nbsp;have been introduced, but the principle on which they are worked&nbsp;is essentially the same. A complete set of rope and twine making&nbsp;machinery includes heckling machines, spreading and drawing&nbsp;frames for line yarns, and carding engines and drawing frames for&nbsp;tow. These machines do not differ from the ordinary preparing&nbsp;machinery in flax manufactures, nor is there any essential difference&nbsp;in the spinning frames for the smaller counts of yarns. The&nbsp;heavier yarns for rope-making are spun upon a gill-spinning frame,&nbsp;such as Goode’s automatic spinner, which is fitted with a self-feeding&nbsp;motion by which when the sliver is presented in large quantity the&nbsp;rate of motion and spinning is proportionally increased, when the&nbsp;sliver becomes attenuated the motion is correspondingly slow, and&nbsp;when the sliver is broken the spinner stops. Thus a yarn well&nbsp;laid and uniform in thickness is secured by automatic machinery.&nbsp;For spinning heckled yarn such as is used in the ropewalk a&nbsp;machine of simple construction, Ronald’s patent (fig. 2), is now&nbsp;extensively used. The yarn in this machine has the advantage of&nbsp;being hand-spun, as the spinner draws out, compresses, and feeds&nbsp;the fibre from a supply round his or her waist just as on the rope-</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
