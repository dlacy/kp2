<p><span class="font1">emolument, and its occupant was invested with a jurisdiction over the youth of Athens similar to that of the vice-chancellor in a modern university. Thus it is said of Theodotus, the first holder of the chair of sophistic as&nbsp;constituted by Marcus Aurelius, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">πρoiστη</span><span class="font1"> δe </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">καί της των&nbsp;Αθηναίων veoτητoς πρώτος</span><span class="font1"> (Philostr., </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vit. Soph.,</span><span class="font1"> II. Π. ρ.&nbsp;566). The Antonines further encouraged rhetoric by&nbsp;granting immunities to its teachers. Three “ sophists ”&nbsp;in each of the smaller towns, and five in the larger, were&nbsp;exempted from taxation </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{Dig.,</span><span class="font1"> xxvii. 1, 6, § 2). The&nbsp;wealthier sophists affected much personal splendour.&nbsp;One of them, Polemon (c. 130 a.d.), was attended on&nbsp;his journeys by an enormous retinue—slaves, beasts of&nbsp;burden, horses, and hounds—while he himself drove in a&nbsp;costly equipage. Another, Adrian of Tyre (c. 170 a.d.),&nbsp;was drawn to his lectures by horses “ with silver bits,”&nbsp;wore the richest attire and the rarest jewels, and endeared himself to the Athenian students by the entertainments which he provided for them. In all this foppery&nbsp;there was calculation. The aim of the sophist was to&nbsp;impress the multitude. Popular applause was the breath&nbsp;of life to him. His whole stock in trade was style, and&nbsp;this was directed to astonishing by </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">tours de force.</span><span class="font1"> The&nbsp;scholastic declamations were chiefly of two classes. (1)&nbsp;The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">suasoriæ</span><span class="font1"> were usually on historical or legendary&nbsp;subjects, in which some course of action was commended&nbsp;or censured ; thus Juvenal, alluding to his school-days,&nbsp;cries—</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ I, too, have counselled Sulla to resign,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">And taste those joys for which dictators pine.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">These </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">suasoriæ</span><span class="font1"> belonged to deliberative rhetoric (the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">βοvλevτLκοv ycvος, deliberativum genus).</span><span class="font1"> (2) The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">controversies</span><span class="font1"> turned especially on legal issues, and represented&nbsp;the forensic rhetoric </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{8eκαvLκοv γevος, judiciale genus).&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">But it was the general characteristic of this period that&nbsp;all subjects, though formally “ deliberative ” or “ forensic,”&nbsp;were treated in the style and spirit of that third branch&nbsp;which Aristotle distinguished, the rhetoric of e7rιδ∈tfιs or&nbsp;“display.” The oratory produced by the age of the&nbsp;academic sophists can be estimated from a large extant&nbsp;literature. It is shown under various aspects, and presumably at its best, by such writers as Dion Chrysostom&nbsp;at the end of the 1st century, Ælius Aristides in the&nbsp;2d, Themistius, Himerius, and Libanius in the 4th.&nbsp;It would be unjust to deny that, amid much which is tawdry&nbsp;or vapid, these writings occasionally present passages of&nbsp;true literary beauty, while they constantly offer matter of&nbsp;the highest interest to the student of the past.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the mediæval system of academic studies, grammar, logic, and rhetoric were the subjects of the trivium, or&nbsp;course followed during the four years of undergraduateship.&nbsp;Music, arithmetic, geometry, and astronomy constituted the&nbsp;quadrivium, or course for the three years from the B.A. to&nbsp;the M. A. degree. These were the seven liberal arts. According to Hallam </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{Lit. Eur.,</span><span class="font1"> vol. i.), the idea of a trivium and&nbsp;quadrivium dates from the 6th century. The well-known&nbsp;memorial couplet can be traced to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">c.</span><span class="font1"> 1420 a.d. :—</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Gram,</span><span class="font0"> loquitur, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dia.</span><span class="font0"> vera docet, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rhet.</span><span class="font0"> verba colorât :</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">A shorter formula was—“ lingua, tropus, ratio ; numerus, tonus, angulus, astra.” In the Middle Ages the chief&nbsp;authorities on rhetoric were the latest Latin epitomists,&nbsp;such as Martianus Capella (5th century), Cassiodorus (5th&nbsp;century), or Isidorus (7th century).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">After the revival of learning, the better Roman and Greek writers gradually returned into use. Some new&nbsp;treatises were also produced. Leonard Cox (died 1549)&nbsp;wrote </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Art or Craft of Rhetoryke,</span><span class="font1"> partly compiled,&nbsp;partly original, which was reprinted in Latin at Cracow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Art of Rhétorique</span><span class="font1"> by Thomas Wilson (1553), afterwards secretary of state, embodied rules chiefly from Aristotle, with help from Cicero and Quintilian. About&nbsp;the same time, treatises on rhetoric were published in&nbsp;France by Tonquelin (1555) and Courcelles (1557). The&nbsp;general aim at this period was to revive and popularize&nbsp;the best teaching of the ancients on rhetoric. The subject&nbsp;was regularly taught at the universities, and was, indeed,&nbsp;important. At Cambridge in 1570 the study of rhetoric&nbsp;was based on Quintilian, Hermogenes, and the speeches of&nbsp;Cicero viewed as works of art. An Oxford statute of 1588&nbsp;shows that the same books were used there. In 1620&nbsp;George Herbert was delivering lectures on rhetoric at Cambridge, where he held the office of public orator. The&nbsp;decay of rhetoric as a formal study at the universities set&nbsp;in during the 18th century. In 1712 Steele regrets that&nbsp;Oxford and Cambridge have “ grown dumb in the study of&nbsp;eloquence.” The function of the rhetoric lecturer passed&nbsp;over into that of correcting written themes ; but his title&nbsp;remained long after his office had lost its primary meaning&nbsp;If the theory of rhetoric fell into neglect, the practice&nbsp;however, was encouraged by the public exercises (“acts’&nbsp;and “ opponencies ”) in the schools. The college prizes fo&nbsp;“ declamations ” served the same purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The fortunes of rhetoric in the modern world, as briefly sketched above, may suffice to suggest why few modern&nbsp;writers of ability have given their attention to the subject.&nbsp;Perhaps one of the most notable modern contributions to&nbsp;the art is the collection of commonplaces framed (in Latin)&nbsp;by Bacon, “ to be so many spools from which the threads&nbsp;can be drawn out as occasion serves,” a truly curious&nbsp;work of that acute and fertile mind. He called them&nbsp;“Antitheta.” A specimen is subjoined :—</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">This is quite in the spirit of Aristotle’s treatise. The popularity enjoyed by Blair’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rhetoric</span><span class="font1"> in the latter part&nbsp;of the 18th and the earlier part of the present century&nbsp;was merited rather by the form than by the matter.&nbsp;Campbell’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Philosophy of Rhetoric,</span><span class="font1"> which found less wide&nbsp;acceptance than its predecessor, was superior to it in depth,&nbsp;though often marred by an imperfect comprehension of&nbsp;logic. But undoubtedly the best modern book on the&nbsp;subject is Whately’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Elements of Rhetoric.</span><span class="font1"> Starting from&nbsp;Aristotle’s view, that rhetoric is “an offshoot from logic,”&nbsp;Whately treats it as the art of “ argumentative composition.” He considers it under four heads :—(1) the address&nbsp;to the understanding ( = Aristotle’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">λoyiκη πiστ∣s)</span><span class="font1"> ; (2) the&nbsp;address to the will, or persuasion ( = Aristotle’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ηθeκη</span><span class="font1"> and&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">παθητική πiστις)</span><span class="font1"> ; (3) style ; (4) elocution, or delivery.&nbsp;At the outset he makes some judicious remarks on the&nbsp;popular objections to the art. “It has been truly observed&nbsp;that ‘genius begins where rules end.’ But to infer from&nbsp;this, as some seem disposed to do, that, in any department wherein genius can be displayed, rules must be&nbsp;useless, or useless to those who possess genius, is a very&nbsp;rash conclusion. What I have observed elsewhere concerning logic, that ‘a knowledge of it serves to save a&nbsp;waste of ingenuity,’ holds good in many other departments also.” “A drayman, we are told, will taunt a&nbsp;comrade by saying, ‘ you ’re a pretty fellow,’ without</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
