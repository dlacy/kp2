        <p><span class="font2">of Rome was prompt and resolute. Both consuls took the
                    field;@@<sup>1</sup> with each were five legates, among them the&nbsp;veteran
                Marius and his destined rival L. Cornelius Sulla,&nbsp;and even freedmen λvere
                pressed into service with the&nbsp;legions. But the first year’s campaign opened
                disastrously.&nbsp;In central Italy the northern Sabellians, and in the
                south&nbsp;the Samnites, defeated the forces opposed to them. And&nbsp;though before
                the end of the year Marius and Sulla in&nbsp;the north, and the consul Cæsar himself
                in Campania,&nbsp;succeeded in inflicting severe blows on the enemy, and on&nbsp;the
                Marsi especially, it is not surprising that, with an&nbsp;empty treasury, with the
                insurgents’ strength still unbroken, and with rumours of disaffection in the
                loyal&nbsp;districts, opinion in Rome should have turned in the direction of the
                more liberal policy which had been so often&nbsp;scornfully rejected and in favour
                of some compromise&nbsp;which should check the spread of the revolt, and
                possibly&nbsp;sow discord among their enemies. Towards the close of&nbsp;the year 90
                the consul Cæsar carried the “lex Julia,”@@<sup>2&nbsp;</sup>by which the Roman
                franchise was offered to all communities which had not as yet revolted ; early in
                the next year&nbsp;(89) the Julian law was supplemented by the “lex
                Plautia&nbsp;Papiria,” introduced by two of the tribunes, which enacted&nbsp;that
                any citizen of an allied community then domiciled in&nbsp;Italy might obtain the
                franchise by giving in his name to&nbsp;a prætor in Rome within sixty days. A third
                law (lex&nbsp;Calpurnia) apparently passed at the same time empowered&nbsp;Roman
                magistrates in the field to bestow the franchise&nbsp;there and then upon all who
                were willing to receive it.&nbsp;This sudden opening of the closed gates of Roman
                citizenship was completely successful, and its effects were at once&nbsp;visible in
                the diminished vigour of the insurgents. By&nbsp;the end of 89 the Samnites and
                Lucanians were left alone&nbsp;in their obstinate hostility to Rome, and neither,
                thanks&nbsp;to Sulla’s brilliant campaign in Samnium, had for the&nbsp;moment any
                strength left for active aggression.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">The termination of the Social War brought with it no peace in Rome.
                The old quarrels were renewed with&nbsp;increased bitterness, and the newly
                enfranchised Italians&nbsp;themselves complained as bitterly of the
                    restriction@@<sup>3</sup> which&nbsp;robbed them of their due share of political
                influence by&nbsp;allowing them to vote only in a specified number of
                tribes.&nbsp;The senate itself was distracted by violent personal
                rivalries&nbsp;—and all these feuds, animosities, and grievances
                were&nbsp;aggravated by the widespread economic distress and ruin&nbsp;λvhich
                affected all classes.@@<sup>4</sup> Lastly, war with Mithradates&nbsp;had been
                declared ; it was notorious that the privilege of&nbsp;commanding the force to be
                sent against him would be&nbsp;keenly contested, and that the contest would lie
                between&nbsp;the veteran Marius and L. Cornelius Sulla.@@<sup>5</sup></span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">It was in an atmosphere thus charged with the elements of disturbance
                that P. Sulpicius Rufus as tribune@@<sup>6</sup> brought&nbsp;forward his laws. He
                proposed—(1) that the command&nbsp;of the Mithradatic war should be given to Marius,
                (2) that&nbsp;the new citizens should be distributed through all the&nbsp;tribes,
                (3) that the freedmen should no longer be confined&nbsp;to the four city tribes, (4)
                that any senator owing more</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">than 2000 denarii should lose his seat, (5) that those exiled on
                suspicion of complicity with the Italian revolt&nbsp;should be recalled. Whatever
                may have been Sulpicius’s&nbsp;intentions, these proposals inevitably provoked a
                storm.&nbsp;The old voters bitterly resented the swamping of the&nbsp;existing
                constituency ; the senate rallied its forces to&nbsp;oppose the alteration in the
                franchise of the freedmen and&nbsp;the proposed purging of its own ranks ; and,
                lastly, both&nbsp;the senate and Sulla himself, now one of the consuls, ρre-pared-to
                resist the transference of the Asiatic command to&nbsp;Marius. Both sides were
                ominously ready for violent&nbsp;measures. The consuls, in order to prevent
                legislation,&nbsp;proclaimed a public holiday.@@<sup>7</sup> Sulpicius replied by
                arming his followers and driving the consuls from the forum.&nbsp;The proclamation
                was withdrawn and the laws carried,&nbsp;but Sulpicius’s triumph was short-lived.
                From Nola in&nbsp;Campania, where lay the legions commanded by him in&nbsp;the
                Social War, Sulla advanced on Rome, and for the&nbsp;first time a Roman consul
                entered the city at the head of&nbsp;the legions of the republic. Resistance was
                hopeless.&nbsp;Marius and Sulpicius fled,@@<sup>8</sup> and Sulla, summoning
                the&nbsp;assembly of the centuries, proposed the measures he considered necessary
                for the public security, the most important being a provision that the sanction of
                the senate&nbsp;should be necessary before any proposal was introduced to&nbsp;the
                    assembly.@@<sup>9</sup> Then, after waiting in Rome long enough&nbsp;to hold the
                consular elections, he left for Asia early in 87.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">Sulla had conquered, but his victory cost the republic dear. He had
                first taught political partisans to look for&nbsp;final success, not to a majority
                of votes in the forum or&nbsp;campus, but to the swords of the soldiery ; and he
                had&nbsp;shown that the legions, composed as they now were, could&nbsp;be trusted to
                regard nothing but the commands of a&nbsp;favourite leader. The lesson was well
                learnt. Shortly&nbsp;after his departure, Cinna as consul revived the
                proposals&nbsp;of Sulpicius ;@@<sup>10</sup> his colleague Octavius at the head of
                an&nbsp;armed force fell upon the new citizens who had collected in&nbsp;crowds to
                vote, and the forum was heaped high with the&nbsp;bodies of the
                    slain.@@<sup>11</sup> Cinna fled, but fled like Sulla to&nbsp;the legions. When
                the senate declared him deposed from&nbsp;his consulship, he replied by invoking the
                aid of the&nbsp;soldiers in Campania in behalf of the violated rights of&nbsp;the
                people and the injured dignity of the consulship, and,&nbsp;like Sulla, found them
                ready to follow where he led. The&nbsp;neighbouring Italian communities, who had
                lost many&nbsp;citizens in the recent massacre, sent their new champion&nbsp;men and
                money ;@@<sup>12</sup> while from Africa, whither he had&nbsp;escaped after Sulla’s
                entry into Rome, came Marius with&nbsp;1000 Numidian horsemen. He landed in Etruria,
                where&nbsp;his old veterans flocked to his standard, and at the head&nbsp;of some
                GOOO men joined Cinna before the gates of Rome.&nbsp;The senate had prepared for a
                desperate defence, but&nbsp;fortune was adverse, and after a brief resistance they
                gave&nbsp;way. Cinna was acknowledged as consul, the sentence of&nbsp;outlawry
                passed on Marius was revoked, and Cinna and&nbsp;Marius entered Rome with their
                troops. Marius’s thirst&nbsp;for revenge was gratified by a frightful massacre,
                and&nbsp;he lived long enough to be nominated consul for the&nbsp;seventh time. But
                he held his consulship only a few&nbsp;weeks. Early in 86 he died, and for the next
                three years&nbsp;Cinna ruled Rome. Constitutional government was virtu-</span></p>
