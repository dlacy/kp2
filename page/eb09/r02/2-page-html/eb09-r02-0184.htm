<p><span class="font1">Rochefort, who then held the archbishopric, and he was also consecrated bishop of Canopus. But he preferred the&nbsp;elegant life and the gaiety of Paris to his clerical duties,&nbsp;and had also an ambition to make a figure in politics.&nbsp;He joined the party opposed to the Austrian alliance,&nbsp;which had been cemented by the marriage of the archduchess Marie Antoinette to the dauphin. This party&nbsp;was headed by the due d’Aiguillon, who in 1771 sent&nbsp;Prince Louis on a special embassy to Vienna to find out&nbsp;what was being done there with regard to the partition of&nbsp;Poland. Rohan arrived at Vienna in January 1772, and&nbsp;made a great noise with his lavish fêtes. But the empress&nbsp;Maria Theresa was implacably hostile to him ; not only&nbsp;did he attempt to thwart her policy, but he spread&nbsp;scandals about her daughter Marie Antoinette, laughed&nbsp;at herself, and shocked her ideas of propriety by his dissipation and luxury. On the death of Louis XV., in 1774,&nbsp;Rohan was recalled from Vienna, and coldly received at&nbsp;Paris ; but the influence of his family was too great for&nbsp;him to be neglected, and in 1777 he was made grand&nbsp;almoner, and in 1778 abbot of St Vaast. In 1778 he&nbsp;was made a cardinal on the nomination of Stanislaus Poniatowski, king of Poland, and in the following year succeeded&nbsp;his uncle as archbishop of Strasburg and became abbot of&nbsp;Noirmoutiers and Chaise-Dieu. His various preferments&nbsp;brought him in an income of two and a half millions of&nbsp;livres ; yet the cardinal was restless and unhappy until he&nbsp;should be reinstated in favour at court and had appeased&nbsp;the animosity which Marie Antoinette felt against him.&nbsp;Though a man of some ability, he became infatuated with&nbsp;the notorious charlatan Cagliostro in 1780, and lodged&nbsp;him in his palace, and in 1782 he made the acquaintance of Madame de Lamotte-Valois, a descendant of an&nbsp;illegitimate branch of the Valois, but a poor adventuress,&nbsp;and married to an adventurer. These people, having acquired great influence over Rohan, determined to turn his&nbsp;excessive desire to become reconciled to the queen to their&nbsp;own advantage. They persuaded him that Marie Antoinette wished him well, and contrived an interview between&nbsp;him and a girl named Oliva, who greatly resembled the&nbsp;queen, in the gardens of Versailles in August 1784, so&nbsp;skilfully that he believed he had seen the queen herself&nbsp;and that she had given him a rose. The adventuress then&nbsp;persuaded him that the queen would be much gratified by&nbsp;the present of an extremely valuable diamond necklace&nbsp;which she had refused in 1778 and 1781, and on 26th&nbsp;January 1785 the cardinal purchased it for 1,600,000&nbsp;francs, to be paid in three instalments, and handed it over&nbsp;to a pretended valet of the queen on receipt of a forged&nbsp;letter of thanks signed “Marie Antoinette of France.” The&nbsp;comte de Lamotte-Valois at once started for London,&nbsp;and, after breaking up the necklace, began to sell the&nbsp;diamonds separately. The plot soon came to light, and&nbsp;the king sent the cardinal to the Bastille. This arrest of&nbsp;a great nobleman and an archbishop excited the wrath&nbsp;of both the nobility and the bishops, and the large party&nbsp;opposed to the Austrian alliance regarded him as a martyr.&nbsp;In this feeling the old courtiers and the judges of the&nbsp;parlement of Paris participated, for they hated the queen&nbsp;for her abolition of strict etiquette and for her extravagance and frivolity. The people, who had also been&nbsp;taught by pamphleteers to hate her and to regard her as&nbsp;the cause of all their ills, shared the feeling of their&nbsp;superiors in education ; and, when the parlement of Paris&nbsp;solemnly absolved the cardinal of all blame on 31st May&nbsp;1786, his acquittal was received with universal enthusiasm,&nbsp;and regarded as a victory over the court and the queen.&nbsp;Though acquitted by the parlement of Paris, the cardinal&nbsp;was deprived of his office as grand almoner and exiled to&nbsp;his abbey of Chaise-Dieu. He was soon allowed to return&nbsp;to Strasburg, and his popularity was shown by his election&nbsp;in 1789 to the states-general by the clergy of the bailliages&nbsp;of Haguenau and Weissenburg. He at first declined to&nbsp;sit, but the states-general, when it became the national&nbsp;assembly, insisted on validating his election. But as a&nbsp;prince of the church in January 1791 he refused to take&nbsp;the oath to the constitution, and went to Ettenheim, in&nbsp;the German part of his diocese. In exile his character&nbsp;improved, and he spent what wealth remained to him in&nbsp;providing for the poor clergy of his diocese who had&nbsp;been obliged to leave France; and in 1801 he resigned&nbsp;his nominal rank as archbishop of Strasburg. On 17th&nbsp;February 1803 he died at Ettenheim.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">ROHILKHAND or Rohilcund, a division or commis-sionership in the North-Western Provinces of India, lying between 27° 35' and 30° 1' N. lat. and between 78° 1'&nbsp;and 80° 26' E. long. It comprises the six districts of&nbsp;Bijnaur (Bijnor), Murâdâbâd, Budâun, Bareli (Bareilly),&nbsp;Shâhjahânpur, and Pilibhit, together containing an area of&nbsp;10,885 square miles, with a population (1881) of 5,122,557&nbsp;(males 2,728,761, females 2,393,796). By religion, Hindus&nbsp;numbered 3,921,989, Mohammedans 1,192,263, and Christians 6304. In the same year there were 11,327 towns&nbsp;and villages in the division and 639,604 occupied houses.&nbsp;Of the total area 6446 square miles were returned as cultivated and 2516 as cultivable. In 1883-84 Rohilkhand&nbsp;division had 2592 miles of road and 163 miles of railway;&nbsp;in the same year its gross revenue amounted to £980,682,&nbsp;of which the land-tax contributed £695,181.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROHTAK, a British district of India, in the Hissar division, under the lieutenant-governorship of the Punjab,&nbsp;lying between 28° 19' and 29° 17' N. lat. and between&nbsp;76° 17' and 77° 30' E. long. It contains an area of 1811&nbsp;square miles, and is bounded on the N. by Karnal, on&nbsp;the E. by Delhi, on the S. by Gurgaon, and on the W. by&nbsp;Hissar and the native state of Jhind. Rohtak district is&nbsp;situated in the midst cf the level tableland separating the&nbsp;J umna and the Sutlej valleys ; it is one unbroken plain,&nbsp;consisting of a hard clay copiously interspersed with light&nbsp;yellow sand, and covered in its wild state by a jungle of&nbsp;scrubby brushwood. It possesses no grand scenery, but&nbsp;on the whole the features of the district are more diversified than many of the plain districts of the Punjab. The&nbsp;only natural reservoir for its drainage is the Najafgarh&nbsp;Jhil, a marshy lake lying within the boundaries of Delhi.&nbsp;The Sahibi, a small stream from the Ajmere hills, traverses&nbsp;a corner of the district, and the northern portions are&nbsp;watered by the Rohtak and Butana branches of the&nbsp;Western Jumna Canal, but the greater portion of the&nbsp;central plain, comprising about two-thirds of the district&nbsp;area, is entirely dependent upon the uncertain rainfall.&nbsp;The climate, though severe in point of heat, is generally&nbsp;healthy; the average rainfall is about 19J inches. Rohtak&nbsp;has no railway ; it is, however, well provided with roads,&nbsp;which cross it in every direction, and telegraphic communication is now under construction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1881 the population of Rohtak district numbered 553,609 (296,221 males and 257,385 females). By religion Hindus numbered&nbsp;168,905, or nearly 85 per cent, of the total population, and Mohammedans 79,510. There are only two towns in the district with&nbsp;inhabitants exceeding 10,000, namely, Rohtak (see below) and&nbsp;Jhajjar with 11,650. Rohtak is a purely agricultural district, but&nbsp;its produce hardly more than suffices for its home consumption.&nbsp;Of the total area of 1811 square miles, 1116 were in 1883-81 returned as cultivated and 269 as cultivable.
