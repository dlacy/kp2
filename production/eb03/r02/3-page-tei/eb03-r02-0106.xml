His conceptions were more extraordinary and more elevated than even thoſe of his maſter, but not ſo natural. He was wonderful in the choice of attitudes ; but did not perfectly underſtand the lights and ſhades, and is frequently harſh and ungraceful. The folds of his draperies, ſays Du Freſnoy, are neither beautiful nor great, eaſy nor natural, but all extravagant, like the fantaſtical habits of comedians. He was, however, ſuperior to moſt painters, by his profound knowledge of antiquity ; and, by converging with the works of the moſt excellent poets, particularly Homer, he made himſelf maſter of the qualifications neceſſarily required in a great deſigner. Julio Romano was alſo well ſhilled in architecture. He was employed by cardinal de Medicis, who was afterwards pope under the name of <hi rend="italic">Clement</hi>  VII.; and afterwards went to Mantua, whither he was invited by Frederic Gonzaga, marquis of that city, in order to avoid his being juſtly puniſhed for his having drawn at Rome the deſigns of 20 ob-ſcene plates, engraved by Mark Antony, to which A-retine added the ſame number of ſonnets. Julio Romano embelliſhed the city of Mantua with many of his performances both in painting and architecture ; and died in that city in 1545, at 54 years of age, much regretted by the marquis, who had an extraordinary friendſhip ſor him.</p><p>ROME, a very ancient and celebrated city of Italy, ſituated on the river Tiber, in E. Long. 13<hi rend="sup">0</hi>. N. Lat. 41. 4Ç. once the capital of the greateſt empire in the world ; and famous in modern hiſtory ſor being the centre of an eccleſiaſtical tyranny, by which for many ages the greateſt part of the world was held in ſubjec-tion.</p><p>The ancient Romans derived their origin from Æ-neas the Trojan hero : and though ſome hiſtorians pretend to treat his voyage into Italy as a mere fable, yet no ſufficient reaſons for rejecting this account have been offered, nor has any more probable hiſtory of the origin of the Roman name been given ; ſo that, without entering into the diſpute, we ſhall proceed to the hiſtory of Æneas and his ſucceſſors as they are recorded by the generality of Latin writers.</p><p>When the Greeks, by the treachery of the ſons of Antehor, or by whatever other means it happened, were become maſters of Troy, Æneas with the forces under his command retired into the fortreſs of the city, and defended it bravely for ſome time; but yielding at length to neceſſity, he conveyed away his gods, his father, wife, and children, with every thing he had that was valuable, and, followed by a numerous crowd of Trojans, fled to the ſtrong places of Mount Ida. Hither all thoſe of his countrymen, who were more anxious than the reſt to preſerve their liberty, flocked to him from the ſeveral towns of Troas. His army thus augmented and advantageouſly polled, he continued quiet, waiting for the departure of the Greeks, who, it was imagined, would return home as ſoon as they had pillaged the country. But theſe, after they had enriched themſelves with the ſpoils of Troy and of the neighbouring towns, turned their arms againſt the fugitives, re ſolving to attack them in their ſtrong-holds upon the mountain. Æneas, to avoid the lrazard of being forced in his laſt refuge, had recourſe to négociation ; and, by his heralds, intreated the enemy not to conſtrain him to a battle. Peace was granted him, on condition that he with his followers quitted the Trojan territories ; and. the Greeks, on their part, promiſed not to moleſt him in his retreat, but to let him ſafely paſs through any country within the extent of their domination.</p><p>Upon this aſſurance Æneas equipped a fleet, in of-der to ſeek a ſettlement in ſome foreign land. We are told, that at his departure he leſt his eldeſt ſon Aſca-nius with the Daſylites, a people of Bithynia, who deſired to have him for their king ; but that the young prince did not remain long with them : for when Sca-mandrius (Aſtyanax), with the reſt of the Hectoridse whom Neoptolemus permitted to return home from Greece, repaired to him, he put himſelf at their head, and led them back to their native country.</p><p>The Trojan having croſſed the Helleſpont, arrived in the peninſula of Pallene, where he built a city, called from him <hi rend="italic">Ænda,</hi>  and left in it a part of that multitude which had followed him. From thence he failed to Delos ; and thence to Cythera, where he erected a temple to Venus. He built another to the ſame goddeſs in Zacynthus, in which iſland he likewiſe inſtituted games, called the <hi rend="italic">races of Æneas and Penns :</hi>  the ſtatues of both, ſays Dionyſius, are ſtanding to this day. In Leucas, where the Trojans landed, was to be ſeen, in the ſame author’s time, a temple erected to Venus the mother of Ænea6. Nor were Actium and Am-brada without monuments that teſtified his arrival in thoſe places. At Dodona were found brazen vaſes, upon which the name of the Trojan hero, who had made an offering of them to Jupiter, was engraven in old characters. Not far from Buthrotos, in Epirus, a Trojan camp which had eſeaped the injuries of time, retained the name of <hi rend="italic">Troja.</hi>  All theſe antiquities, ſtill ſubſiſting in the reign <hi rend="italic">of</hi>  Auguſtus, were then looked upon as indiſputable proofs of Æneas’s voyage to Epirus: “ and that he carne into Italy (adds the ſame Dionyſius) we have the concurrent teſtimony of all the Romans ; the ceremonies they obſerve in their ſacrri ſices and feſtivals bear witneſs to it, as all’» the Sibylline books, the Pythian oracles, and many other things which nobody can reaſonably reject as invented merely for ornament.”</p><p>The firſt land of Italy which Æneas made, after croſſing the Ionian ſea, was cape Minerva, in Iapygia; and here he went on ſhore. Sailing afterwards from hence, and coaſting along the ſouth-eaſt -of Italy and the eaſt and ſouth ſides of Sicily, he arrived with his fleet either by choice or by ſtreſs <hi rend="italic">of</hi>  weather at the port of Drepanuτn in that iſland. Elymus and Ægeftus, who had eſeaped from Troy a little before him, had brought a Trojan colony to this place. Æneas augmented it by a good number of his followers, whom, pleaſed to have found a ſafe reſting place after many dangers and fatiguing voyages, he willingly left behind him at tlreir requeſt ; though certain authors pretend that he was conſtrained to it by the difficulty of tranſporting them, becauſe ſome Trojan women, weary of the ſea, had burnt a conſiderable part of his ſhips.</p><p>Æneas, leaving Dreρanum, fleered hie courſe for I-</p></body></text></TEI>
