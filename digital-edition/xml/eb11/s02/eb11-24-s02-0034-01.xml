In 1837 she was elected to a king’s scholarship, and first appeared at a Philharmonic concert in 1841. In October 1845 she sang at the Gewandhaus, Leipzig, through the influence of Mendelssohn, who had been delighted by her singing in <hi rend="italic">St Paul.</hi> The contralto music in his <hi rend="italic">Elijah</hi> was written for her voice, but she did not appear in that work till the performance at Exeter Hall on the 16th of April 1847. She married M. Sainton in i860, and in 1870 she retired from the career of a public singer, but two years afterwards started a “ vocal academy ” in London. She made various successful attempts as a composer, and the cantatas “ The Legend of St Dorothea” (1876), “The Story of the Faithful Soul ”(1879), and “ Florimel ” (1885), enjoyed considerable success. Her last public appearance was at her husband’s farewell concert in June 1883, and she died on the 18th of February 1885. A scholarship in her memory was founded at the Royal Academy of Music. Her voice was of moderate power and of fine quality, but it was her dignified and artistic style that gave her the high place she held for so many years both in oratorio and ballads.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
