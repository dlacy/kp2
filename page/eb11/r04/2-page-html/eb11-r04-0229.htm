The same name, jacaranda, is applied to several species of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Machaerium,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">also trees belonging to the natural order Leguminosae; and&nbsp;there can be no doubt that a certain proportion of the rosewood&nbsp;of commerce is drawn from these sources. Rosewood comes&nbsp;to the United Kingdom from Rio de Janeiro, Babia, Jamaica and&nbsp;Honduras. The heartwood attains large dimensions, but as it&nbsp;begins to decay before the tree arrives </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">at </span><span class="font2">maturity it is always&nbsp;faulty and hollow in the centre. On this account squared&nbsp;logs or planks of rosewood are never seen, the wood being&nbsp;imported in half-round flitches io to 20 ft. in length and from&nbsp;5 to 12 in. in their thickest part. Owing to its irregular form,&nbsp;the wood is sold by weight, and its value varies within wide&nbsp;limits according to the richness of colour. Rosewood has a&nbsp;deep ruddy brown colour, richly streaked and grained with&nbsp;black resinous layers. It takes a fine polish, but, on account&nbsp;of its resinous nature, it is somewhat difficult to work. The&nbsp;wood is very much in demand both by cabinet-makers and&nbsp;pianoforte-makers, by whom it is used both solid and in veneer.</span></p>

The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bois de&nbsp;Rose</span><span class="font2"> of the French, the Portuguese </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pao de Rosa,</span><span class="font2"> and the German&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rosenholz</span><span class="font2"> is a Brazilian wood, the produce of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Physocalymma&nbsp;floribundum,</span><span class="font2"> called in the United Kingdom tulip wood, and&nbsp;very highly esteemed on account of its beautiful rose colour and&nbsp;grain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ROSICRUCIANISM. What is known as the Society of Rosicrucians </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Rosenkreuzer)</span><span class="font2"> was really a number of isolated&nbsp;individuals who early in the 17th century held certain views&nbsp;in common (which apparently was their only bond of union);&nbsp;for of a society holding meetings, and having officers, there is&nbsp;no trace. So far as the numerous works are concerned it is&nbsp;evident that the writers who posed as Rosicrucians were moral&nbsp;and religious reformers, and utilized the technicalities of&nbsp;chemistry (alchemy), and the sciences generally, as media&nbsp;through which to make known their opinions, there being a&nbsp;flavour of mysticism or occultism promotive of inquiry and&nbsp;suggestive of hidden meanings discernible or discoverable&nbsp;only by adepts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The publication of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">AUgemeine und General-Reformation der ganzen weiten Well</span><span class="font2"> (Cassel, 1614), and the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Fama Frater-nitatis</span><span class="font2"> (Cassel, 1615) by the theologian Johann Valentin Andrea&nbsp;(1586-1654), caused immense excitement throughout Europe,&nbsp;and they not only led to many re-issues, but were followed&nbsp;by numerous pamphlets, favourable and otherwise, whose&nbsp;authors generally knew little, if anything, of the real aims&nbsp;of the original author, and doubtless in not a few cases amused&nbsp;themselves at the expense of the public. It is probable that&nbsp;the first work was circulated in MS. about 1610, for it is said&nbsp;that a reply was written in 1612 (according to Herder), but&nbsp;if so, there was no mention of the cult before that decade.&nbsp;The authors generally favoured Lutheranism as opposed to&nbsp;Roman Catholicism. Others, like John Heydon, admitted&nbsp;they were not Rosicrucians, but under attractive and suggestive titles to their works sought to make Hermeticism and&nbsp;other curious studies more useful and popular, and succeeded,&nbsp;for a time at least.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The curious legend, in which the fabulous origin of the so-called society was enshrined (that a certain Christian Rosen-kreuz had discovered the secret wisdom of the East on a pilgrimage in the 15th century), was so improbable, though ingenious,&nbsp;that the genesis of the Rosicrucians was generally overlooked&nbsp;or ignored, but the worthy objects of the fratres were soon&nbsp;discovered and supported by several able men; the result&nbsp;being a mass of literature on the subject, which absorbs some&nbsp;80 pages of Gardner’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Catalogue Raisonne of Works on the Occult&nbsp;Sciences</span><span class="font2"> (London, 1903).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The influence that Rosicrucianism had in the modernizing of ancient Freemasonry early in the 18th century must have been&nbsp;slight, if any, though it is likely that as the century advanced, and&nbsp;additional ceremonies were grafted on to the first three degrees,&nbsp;Rosicrucian tenets were occasionally introduced into the later&nbsp;rituals. So far, however, as the real foundation ceremonies of Craft</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Masonry are concerned, whether before or after the premier Grand Lodge was formed, it is most unlikely that such a society as the&nbsp;Freemasons would adopt anything of a really distinctive character&nbsp;from any other organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Muses' Threnodie</span><span class="font2"> by H. Adamson (Perth, 1638) are the lines—</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“For what we do presage is riot in grosse,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">For we are brethren of the Rosie Crosse;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We have the Mason Word and second sight,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Things for to come we can fortell aright/*</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Dr Begemann considers that possibly during the decade from 1720 to 1730 a kind of Rosicrucian or .Hermetic influence took place in&nbsp;the lodges of London, some additions to the ritual of that period&nbsp;not having been derived from operative masonty; but in the&nbsp;previous century no such influence is traceable. Several modern&nbsp;societies have been formed from time to time (some of which are&nbsp;still flourishing in Great Britain) for the study of Rosicrucianism&nbsp;and allied subjects, but in no sense are they directly derived from&nbsp;the “ Brethren of the Rosy Cross ” of the 17th century, though&nbsp;keen followers thereof. By far the most important of these is the&nbsp;“ Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia,” with headquarters in London.&nbsp;The Supreme Magus, Dr William Wynn Westcott, has written its&nbsp;History (1900), with other important works on the subject, and&nbsp;the published </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Transactions</span><span class="font2"> of the Society are most valuable.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">ROSIN (a later variant of “ resin,” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">q.v.)</span><span class="font2"> or Colophony </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Colo-phonia resina,</span><span class="font2"> resin from Colophon in Lydia), the resinous constituent of the oleo-resin exuded by various species of pine,&nbsp;known in commerce as crude turpentine. The separation of&nbsp;the oleo-resin into the essential oil-spirit of turpentine and&nbsp;common rosin is effected by distillation in large copper stills.&nbsp;The essential oil is carried off at a heat of between 212° and&nbsp;316° F., leaving fluid rosin, which is run off through a tap&nbsp;at the bottom of the still, and purified by passing through a&nbsp;straining wadding. Rosin varies in colour, according to the&nbsp;age of the tree whence the turpentine is drawn and the amount&nbsp;of heat applied in distillation, from an opaque almost pitchy&nbsp;black substance through grades of brown and yellow to an&nbsp;almost perfectly transparent colourless glassy mass. The&nbsp;commercial grades are numerous, ranging by letters from&nbsp;A, the darkest, to N, extra pale,—superior to which are W,&nbsp;<sup>u</sup> window glass,” and WW, “ water white ” varieties, the&nbsp;latter having about three times the value of the common qualities. Rosin is a brittle and friable resin, with a faint piny&nbsp;odour; the melting-point varies with different specimens,&nbsp;some being semi-fluid at the temperature of boiling water,&nbsp;while others do not melt till 220° or 250° F. It is soluble in&nbsp;alcohol, ether, benzene and chloroform. Rosin consists mainly&nbsp;of abietic acid, and combines with caustic alkalis to form&nbsp;salts (rosinates or pinates) that are known as “ rosin soaps.”&nbsp;In addition to its extensive use in soap-making, rosin is largely&nbsp;employed in making inferior varnishes, sealing-wax and various&nbsp;cements. It is also used for preparing shoemaker’s wax, as&nbsp;a flux for soldering metals, for pitching lager beer casks, for&nbsp;rosining the bows of musical instruments and numerous minor&nbsp;purposes. In pharmacy it forms an ingredient in several&nbsp;plasters and ointments. On a large scale it is treated by&nbsp;destructive distillation for the production of rosin spirit,&nbsp;pinoline and rosin oil. The last enters into the composition&nbsp;of some of the solid lubricating greases, and is also used as an&nbsp;adulterant of other oils.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The chief region of rosin production is the South Atlantic and Eastern Gulf states of the United States. American&nbsp;rosin is obtained from the turpentine of the swamp pine, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pinus&nbsp;australis,</span><span class="font2"> and of the loblolly pine, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">P. Taeda.</span><span class="font2"> The main source&nbsp;of supply in Europe is the <sup>u</sup> landes ” of the departments&nbsp;of Gironde and Landes in France,, where the cluster pine,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">P. Pinaster,</span><span class="font2"> is extensively cultivated. In the north of Europe&nbsp;rosin is obtained from the Scotch fir, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">P. sylvestris,</span><span class="font2"> and throughout European countries local supplies are obtained from other&nbsp;species of pine.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
