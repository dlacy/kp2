It is doubtful whether during the regal period a testamentary appointment of tutors by a husband or parent to wife or children was known in practice,— probably not. If so the office devolved upon the <hi rend="italic">gens</hi>  to which the deceased <hi rend="italic">paterfamilias</hi>  belonged ; and it may reasonably be assumed that it delegated the duties to one of its members in particular, retaining in its collective capacity a right of supervision.</p><p><hi rend="italic">The Quiritiaη Law of Property.—</hi>The distribution of land amongst the early Romans is one of the puzzling problems of their history. The Servian constitution classified the citizens and determined their privileges, duties, and burdens according to the extent of their freeholds; and yet we know very little with certainty of the way in which these were acquired.@@<hi rend="sup">1</hi>  We have indeed a traditional account of a partition by Romulus of the little territory of his original settlement into three parts, not necessarily of equal dimensions, one of which was intended for the maintenance of the state and its institutions, civil and religious, the second<hi rend="italic">(ager publicus)</hi>  for the use of the citizens and profit of the state, and the third <hi rend="italic">(ager prrvvatus) </hi>for subdivision among his followers. Varro and Pliny further relate that to each of them he assigned a homestead <hi rend="italic">(heredium)</hi>  of two jugers, equal to about an acre and a quarter, to be held by him and his heirs <hi rend="italic">(quae here-dem sequerentur),—</hi>Pliny adding that to none did the king give more. There can be no doubt that a portion of the territory, gradually augmented through new conquests, was reserved as <hi rend="italic">ager publicus</hi>  ; that is sufficiently attested by the complaints made for centuries by the plebeians of its monopolization by the patricians. But it is impossible to admit the accuracy of the account of the mode in which the <hi rend="italic">ager privatus</hi>  was dealt with. The fact that the majority of the Servian local tribes bore the names of well-known patrician <hi rend="italic">gentes</hi>  leads to the conclusion that many at least of the clans held tracts of land in their corporate capacity, and that their constituent families settled alongside each other, each with its own homestead in separate and independent right. It can hardly be assumed, however, that two and a half jugers was its maximum. Seven jugers, about 4∣ acres, seems to have been the normal extent of royal grants to plebeians, and a patrician’s freehold is not likely to have been less ; probably in the ordinary case it was larger, seeing the minimum qualification for the third Servian class was ten jugers, and for the first twenty.@@<hi rend="sup">2</hi>  To enable him to make grants during pleasure to his clients he must have held more than seven. But he did not necessarily hold all his lands by gratuitous assignation either from the state or from his<hi rend="italic">gens</hi>  ; purchase from the former was by no means uncommon ; and it may have been on his purchased lands, outside his <hi rend="italic">heredium</hi>  proper, that his clients were usually employed. Those dependants were also employed in large numbers upon those parts of the <hi rend="italic">ager publicus</hi>  which were occupied by the patricians under the name of <hi rend="italic">possessioηes, </hi>and which really were the source of their wealth. These,</p><lb/><p>however, were not the property of their occupant ; it was the lands acquired by assignation or purchase that were alone regarded as his <hi rend="italic">ex jure Qrnmtium,—</hi>what he held in independent ownership to him and his heirs according to the law and custom of the Quirites.</p><p>There are some who maintain that in the regal period, anterior to the reign of Servius Tullius, there was no private property in movables. The proposition thus broadly stated is manifestly untenable. If no more be meant by it than this, that movables were not then recognized as objects of quiritarian right that could be vindicated as such by a real action <hi rend="italic">per sacramentum,</hi>  it may be admitted that down to the time of Servius, with exception perhaps of captured slaves and cattle, there was no property in movables. But, if it be meant to negative the right of a man to alienate by tradition what he held as his own, and to protect himself, or have protection from the authorities, against any attempt to deprive him of it by theft or violence, then the non-existence of ownership of movables must be emphatically denied. Theft was theft, though the stolen article had been acquired only by natural means,—by barter in the market, by the industry of the maker, or as the product of something already belonging to its holder.</p><p><hi rend="italic">The Quiritiaη Law of Succession.—</hi>The legal order of succession in the regal period was extremely simple. It was this : on the death of a <hi rend="italic">paterfamilias</hi>  his patrimony devolved upon those of his children <hi rend="italic">in potestate</hi>  who by that event became <hi rend="italic">sui juris,</hi>  his widow taking an equal share with them, and no distinction being made between movables and immovables, personalty and realty; and, failing widow and children, it went to his <hi rend="italic">gens.</hi>  The notion that between the descendants and the <hi rend="italic">gens</hi>  came an intermediate class under the name of agnates does not seem well founded as regards the regal period ; they were introduced by the XII. Tables to meet the case of the plebeians, who, having no <hi rend="italic">gentes,</hi>  were without legal heirs in default of children.@@<hi rend="sup">3</hi></p><p>The later jurists more than once refer to the perfect equality of the sexes in the matter of succession in the ancient law.@@<hi rend="sup">4</hi> But it was more nominal than real. A daughter who had passed into the hand of a husband during her father’s lifetime of course could have no share in the latter’s inheritance, for she had ceased to be a member of his family. One who was<hi rend="italic">in potestate</hi>  at his death, and thereby became <hi rend="italic">sui juris,</hi>  did become his heir, unless he had prevented such a result by testamentary arrangements. But even then it was in the hands of the <hi rend="italic">gens</hi>  to prevent risk of prejudice to themselves : for she could not marry, and so carry her fortune into another family, without their consent as her guardians ; neither could she without their consent alienate any of the more valuable items of it ; nor, even with their consent, could she make a testament disposing of it in prospect of death. Her inheritance, therefore, was hers in name only ; in reality it was in the hands of her guardians.</p><p>Of primogeniture or legal preference of one member of the family over the others there is not the faintest trace. And yet we find record of <hi rend="italic">heredia</hi>  remaining in a family not for generations merely but for centuries,—a state of matters that would have been impossible had every death of a <hi rend="italic">paterfamilias</hi>  necessarily involved a splitting up of the family estate. It is conceivable that this was sometimes prevented by arrangement amongst the heirs themselves ;</p><lb/><p>@@@<hi rend="sup">1</hi>    See Giraud,<hi rend="italic">Recherches sur le droit de propriété chez les Romains, </hi>Aix, 1838 (only first vol. published) ; Macé, <hi rend="italic">Histoire de la propriété, du domaine publie, et des lois agraires chez les Romains,</hi>  Paris, 1851 ; Hildebrand, <hi rend="italic">De antiquissimae agris Romani distributwnis fiele,</hi>  Jena, 1862 ; Voigt, “ Ueber die <hi rend="italic">bina jugera</hi>  d. ältesten röm.

The supposed mention of agnates in a law attributed to Numa rests simply on a conjecture of I. G. Huschke’s <hi rend="italic">{Analecta litteraria,</hi>  Leipsic, 1826, p. 375). The law, which is preserved in narrative by Servius, <hi rend="italic">In Virg. Eclog.,vt.</hi>  43, runs thus: “In Numae legibus cautum est, ut si quis imprudens occidisset hominem, pro capite occisi et natis ejus in cautione (Scalig., concione) offerret arietem.” Huschke’s substitution of <hi rend="italic">agnatis</hi>  for <hi rend="italic">et natis</hi>  is all but universally adopted ; but, even were it necessary, it need mean nothing more than his children <hi rend="italic">in potestate</hi>  or his <hi rend="italic">gens.</hi></p><p>@@@<hi rend="sup">4</hi>    The Voconian law of 585 u.c. avowedly introduced something new in prohibiting a man of fortune from instituting a woman, even his only daughter, as his testamentary heir ; but even it did not touch the law of intestacy.</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
