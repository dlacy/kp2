<p><span class="font0">ther; and ſo prone to vice, that he was generally believed to have been the ſon, not of Marcus Aurelius, but of a celebrated gladiator, with whom the empreſs</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font0">military exerciſes were the unremitted object of their diſcipline. The recruits and young ſoldiers were conſtantly trained both in the morning and evening; and even the veterans were not excuſed from the daily repetition of their exerciſe. Large ſheds were erected in the winter-quarters of the troops, that theſe uſeful laboura might not be interrupted by tempeſtuous weather, and the weapons uſed in theſe imitations of war were always&nbsp;twice as heavy as thoſe made uſe of in real action. The ſoldiers were diligently inſtructed to march, to run, leap,&nbsp;ſwim, carry heavy burdens, and handle every ſpecies of weapon either for offence or defence; to form a variety&nbsp;of evolutions; and to move to the ſound of flutes in the pyrrhic or martial dance. It was the policy of the ableſt&nbsp;generals, and even of the emperors themſelves, to encourage theſe military ſtudies by their preſence and example; and we are informed that Adrian, as well as Trajan, frequently condeſcended to inſtruct the unexperienced ſoldiers, to reward the diligent, and ſometimes to diſpute with them the prize of ſuperior ſtrength and dexterity. Under the reigns of thoſe princes, the ſcience of tactics was cultivated with ſucceſs; and, as long as&nbsp;the empire retained any vigour, their military inſtructions were reſpected as the moſt perfect model of Roman&nbsp;diſcipline.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">From the foundation of the city, as the Romans had in a manner been continually engaged in war, many alterations had taken place in the conſtitution of the legions. In the time of the emperors, the heavy-armed infantry, which compoſed its principal ſtrength, was divided into 10 cohorts and 55 companies, under the orders of a correſpondent number of tribunes and centurions. The firſt cohort, which always claimed the poſt of honour and the cuſtody of the eagle, was formed of 1105 ſoldiers, the moſt approved for valour and fidelity. The remaining nine cohorts conſiſted each of 555; and the whole body of legionary infantry conſiſted of 6100 men.&nbsp;Their arms were uniform, and excellently adapted to the nature of their ſervice; an open helmet with a lofty&nbsp;creſt; a breaſt-plate or coat of mail; greaves on their legs, and a large buckler on their left arm. Their buckler&nbsp;was of an oblong and concave figure, four ſeet in length, and two and an half in breadth; framed of a light&nbsp;wood, covered with a bull’s hide, and ſtrongly guarded with braſs plates. Beſides a lighter ſpear, the legionary&nbsp;carried the pilum, a ponderous javelin about ſix feet long, and terminated by a maſſy triangular point of ſteel 18&nbsp;inches in length. This weapon could do execution at the diſtance of 10 or 12 paces; but its ſtroke was ſo powerful, that no cavalry durſt venture within its reach, and ſcarce any armour could be formed proof againſt it. As&nbsp;ſoon as the Roman had darted his pilum, he drew his ſword, and ruſhed forward to cloſe with the enemy. It&nbsp;was a ſhort well-tempered Spaniſh blade with a double edge, and equally calculated for the purpoſes of puſhing&nbsp;and ſtriking; but the ſoldier was always inſtructed to prefer the former uſe of his own weapon, as his body remained thereby the leſs expoſed, while at the ſame time he inflicted a more dangerous wound on his adverſary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The legion was uſually drawn up eight deep; and the regular diſtance of three feet was left between the files and ranks. Thus the ſoldier poſſeſſed a free ſpace for his arms and motions; and ſufficient intervals were allowed, through which ſeaſonable reinforcements might be introduced to the relief of the combatants. The cavalry,&nbsp;without which the force of the legion remained imperfect, was divided into ten troops or ſquadrons: the firſt,&nbsp;as the companion of the firſt cohort, conſiſted of 132 men; whilſt each of the other nine amounted only to 66.&nbsp;The entire eſtabliſhment formed a body of 726 horſe, naturally connected with its reſpective legion; but occaſionally acting in the line, and compoſing a part of the wings of the army. The cavalry of the ancient republic&nbsp;was compoſed of the nobleſt youths of Rome and Italy, who, by performing their military ſervice on horſeback, prepared themſelves for the offices of ſenator and conſul; but after the alteration of manners and government which took place at the end of the commonwealth, the moſt wealthy of the equeſtrian order were engaged&nbsp;in the adminiſtration of juſtice and of the revenue; and, whenever they embraced the profeſſion of arms, they&nbsp;were immediately entruſted with a troop of horſe or a cohort of foot, and the cavalry, as well as the infantry,&nbsp;were recruited from the provinces. The horſes were bred for the moſt part in Spain, or in Cappadocia. The&nbsp;Roman troopers deſpiſed the complete armour which encumbered the cavalry of the eaſt. Inſtead of this, their&nbsp;arms conſiſted only of an helmet, an oblong ſhield, light boots, and a coat of mail. A javelin and a long broad&nbsp;ſword were their principal offenſive weapons. They ſeem to have borrowed the uſe of lances and iron maces&nbsp;from the barbarians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Beſides the legionaries, the Romans, eſpecially in the times of the emperors, began to take auxiliaries into their pay. Conſiderable levies were regularly made among thoſe provincials who had not yet attained to the rank&nbsp;of Roman citizens. Many dependent princes and communities, diſperſed round the frontiers, were permitted, for&nbsp;a while, to hold their freedom and ſecurity by the tenure of military ſervice. Even ſelect troops of barbarians&nbsp;were compelled to enter into the ſervice; which was afterwards found to be a moſt deſtructive expedient, not&nbsp;only as it carried the Roman military ſkill among barbarians who were otherwiſe unacquainted with it, but it&nbsp;gave theſe auxiliaries themſelves frequent opportunities of revolting, and at laſt of dethroning the emperors at&nbsp;pleaſure, and even of overturning the empire itſelf. The number of auxiliaries was ſeldom inferior to that of&nbsp;the legionaries themſelves. The braveſt and moſt faithful bands among them were placed under the command of&nbsp;prefects and centurions, and ſeverely trained in the arts of Roman diſcipline; but the far greater part retained&nbsp;thoſe arms which they had uſed in their native country. By this inſtitution, each legion, to whom a certain&nbsp;number of auxiliaries was allotted, contained within itſelf every ſpecies of lighter troops, and of miſſile weapons;</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
