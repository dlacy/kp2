The office upon his resignation was presently disponed to the advocate ; which grieved the father beyond all measure. And the case indeed was pitiful, and much regrated by all honest men ; for he had been a man much employed, and honoured with divers legations, which he discharged with good credit, and now in age to be circumvented in this sort by the simplicity or folly of his son, 'twas held lamentable. The king being informed of the abuse by the old mans complaint, was very careful to satisfie him, and to have the son reconciled to his father, which after some travel was brought to pass : yet so exceeding was the old man’s discontent, as within a few days he deceased.”@@<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> Grief however is seldom so rapidly fatal. Skene resigned his office in the year 1612, and he survived till the 16th of March 1617.</p><p>At that period the legal profession not unfrequently opened the road to emoluments and wealth comparatively great. He acquired the demesnes of Curriehill and Red- hall in the county of Edinburgh, and Edinganoch in the county of Aberdeen. His title on the bench was Lord Curriehill. His son Sir James Skene succeeded him on the 12th of June 1612, and became president of the Court of Session on the 14th of February 1626. On the 15th of October 1633, he died in his own house near the grammar school. The second son, named John, was appointed one of the principal clerks of Session in 1614. He purchased the estate of Hallyards. About twenty years ago, his last descendant, Elizabeth Skene, bequeathed to the Advocates Library a collection of family papers, together with a very curious collection of ancient music, which appears to have belonged to this ancestor. The <hi rend="italic">Shene Papers</hi> have been carefully bound in a folio volume ; and the music has very recently been published by Mr. Dauney, who has added a copious and elaborate introduction, together with notes and illustrations.@@<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> Alexander, the third son of Sir John Skene, was clerk of the registration of hornings. Beside these three sons, he had four daughters. The eldest daughter became the wife of Alexander Hay of Fosterseat, a judge and privy councillor. The second daughter was married to Sir William Scott of Ardross ; the third to Robert Lermont, advocate, brother to Lermont of Balcomy ; and the fourth to Sir Robert Richardson of Pencaitland.@@<hi rend="superscript">3</hi></p><p>The clerk register had a brother named Alexander, who was likewise an advocate and an author. For some time at least, he must have adhered to the popish church ; for we find that in 1561 he was committed to prison by the magistrates of Edinburgh for attending mass, but was released at the intercession of William Skene.@@<hi rend="superscript">4</hi> This was apparently his brother, who was commissary of St. Andrews, and professor of law in that university. Of his method of teaching, we find an account in the very curious Diary of a pupil, who relinquished the study of law for that of divinity. “ In the thrid and fourt yeirs of my course, at the direction of my father.

But there are cases of frequent occurrence, in which various sorts of passages and courses necessarily cross each other obliquely, as well as on different levels;@@<hi rend="superscript">6</hi> and where, on account of the difficulty or impossibility of constructing a square bridge, which should both have sufficient strength, and, at the same time, leave the lower passage quite clear, a different form of arch, placed obliquely to the abutments, and yet exerting its thrust in the direction of the upper passage, is almost the only practicable alternative. Such a structure is called a <hi rend="italic">shew</hi> bridge, and is very frequently required since the more general introduction of railways, in which it is of great consequence to preserve as direct or straight a line as possible. Nay, it is not uncommon for a railway to have to traverse districts in which it may neither be allowable nor practicable to use any means of avoiding the obliquity with which it may have to cross canals, roads, &amp;c.; its course being so much controlled by conflicting interests, and by the natural features of the country.</p><p>If a common square bridge were to be employed in the circumstances just supposed, namely, in which the passages mutually intersecting obliquely, cannot be so diverted as to cross at right angles, then the arch must either be built stretching in the direction of the upper passage, and of sufficient span to allow the lower passage, with its course unaltered, to pass uninterruptedly under it ; or, it must be built stretching at right angles to the lower passage, and having its embankments and abutments so much extended, that the whole structure may both stand securely, and furnish sufficient area above for the upper passage to continue its oblique course over it unaltered. An arch partaking of both these forms might, it is true, be employed ; but to such expedients, a proper skew bridge is in general greatly preferable, and is indeed sometimes the only allowable form of construction that will serve the purpose required. As for any alteration in the old courses, they would often be incompatible with the particular or vested rights of proprietors, and especially with the provisions which are generally inserted in the acts of Parliament expressly prohibiting any alteration to be made in the original courses of canals, &amp;c.; and even were there no such restrictions, the diversion of the courses might be attended with great expense, and might occasion much inconvenience to the traffic. The wide or broad arch again, is a most unscientific mode of overcoming the difficulty. Room for it, with the requisite embankments, could not always be had, and it would, besides, great</p><p><hi rend="superscript">@@@,</hi> Spotswood’s Hist, of the Church of Scotland, p. 517.</p><p>@@@*	Ancient Scotish Melodies, from a manuscript of the reign of King James VI., with an introductory Enquiry illustrative of the History of the Music of Scotland, by William Daυney, Esq., F.S.A.
