When the finished obverse and reverse had been fitted together, the legend was added on their edges by means of the fourth piece of the matrix,—a strip of bronze with letters cut into it on both its</p><p>edges ; first one</p><p>side and then the</p><p>other of this strip</p><p>was pressed against</p><p>the rim of the wax</p><p>seal, which thus</p><p>received the im</p><p>pression of the</p><p>complete legend</p><p>all round its edge.</p><p>The seal of South</p><p>wark priory, also</p><p>of the 14th cen</p><p>tury, is even more</p><p>elaborate, as both</p><p>sides have open</p><p>tracery separately</p><p>applied, and thus</p><p>the matrix consists</p><p>of five distinct</p><p>pieces. Many of</p><p>the bishops’ seals,</p><p>though less com</p><p>plicated in design,</p><p>are of equal beauty</p><p>to those of the</p><p>chapters. The common design has a standing figure under a richly decorated canopy. Fig. 3 shows a very beautiful example, the seal of Richard, bishop of Durham. The standing figure of the bishop in mass vestments is modelled with wonderful skill and shows extreme taste in the treatment of the drapery; the legend is s[igillum] <hi rend="smallcaps">ricardi . dei . gra . dvnelmensis . epi.</hi> A great variety of sacred subjects occur on ecclesiastical seals</p><p>in addition to single figures of patron saints ; the most frequent were perhaps the Crucifixion, the Annunciation, the Coronation of the Virgin, and the Virgin enthroned in Heaven ; small figures of kneeling worshippers were</p><p>often added. Fig. 4 shows one of the most magnificent of this class, with, in the centre, a figure of the Virgin in glory, between St Nicholas and Henry VI., each under a very rich canopy ; at the sides are shields charged with England and France, and France (modern) alone, held by two monks. @@<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> This very beautiful work of art dates about the year 1443. In the 15th century the ecclesiastical seals began to fall off in richness and beauty, and after the Reformation were of little artistic value. Very handsome seals were used by lay corporations, especially the municipalities of towns. These last frequently have a careful representation of the town itself, with its circuit of walls or that of its chief castle or cathedral, and thus often afford valuable evidence as to the form of its defences and principal</p><p>buildings. Fig. 5</p><p>shows a fine example,</p><p>3 inches in diameter,</p><p>—the corporate seal</p><p>of Rochester, made</p><p>in the 13th century;</p><p>it has a minute re</p><p>presentation of the </p><p>keep of Rochester</p><p>Castle, surrounded</p><p>by an outer circuit</p><p>wall and a moat. On</p><p>one of the turrets</p><p>of the gateway is a</p><p>sentinel blowing a</p><p>signal horn ; legend,</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">sigillvm</hi> . CIVIVM . ROFENSIS. The reverse has the same legend repeated round the scene of the Crucifixion of St Andrew. Other corporation seals are covered with small figures under elaborate canopy work, much like those of the ecclesiastical foundations.</p><p>Seals of hospitals are often designed in a similar way, with a representation of the hospital building very minutely treated. In the 15th century seals began to be designed in a rather pictorial style, which, though very graceful, is inferior to the earlier</p><p>and more architect</p><p>onic class. Very</p><p>magnificent seals</p><p>were used by state</p><p>officials : those of</p><p>the lord high ad</p><p>miral of England are</p><p>especially fine, from</p><p>the beautiful form of</p><p>the ship on the ob</p><p>verse. Fig. 6 shows</p><p>that of the earl of</p><p>Huntingdon, who</p><p>was lord high ad</p><p>miral in the reign</p><p>of Henry VIII. In</p><p>design it resembles</p><p>those of the admirals of the previous century. On the sails are embroidered the royal arms of England.</p><p>Among private seals those of powerful barons are often large and very beautifully cut. Fig. 7 shows a silver matrix, now in the British Museum, which is remarkable for the great beauty of its workmanship. Its legend is SIGILLVM . ROBERTI . <hi rend="smallcaps">filii . Walterl</hi> On it an armed knight, of the time of Henry III., is riding over a dragon, whose tail ends in a scroll of very beautiful conventional foliage, modelled with the greatest spirit and delicacy.</p><p><hi rend="superscript">@@@1</hi> This class of seal is often a sort of miniature reproduction of some magnificent altar retable, as in fig. 4.</p></body></text></TEI>
