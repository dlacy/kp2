<p><span class="font3">minent characteristic, their dark red colour blending finely with the bright green woods and sparkling streams. The&nbsp;best example of this species of scenery is on the Jed near&nbsp;Jedburgh. From the left the Teviot receives the Borthwick and the Ale, both rising in Selkirkshire, and from the&nbsp;right the Allan, the Slitrig, the Rule, the Jed, the Oxnam,&nbsp;and the Kale, which rise in the high grounds towards the&nbsp;English border. As the Teviot approaches Hawick the&nbsp;county becomes more cultivated, although frequent irruptions of igneous rocks in the shape of isolated hills lend to&nbsp;it picturesqueness and variety. Towards the Tweed, where&nbsp;the lower division of the coal formation prevails, it expands&nbsp;into a fine champaign country, richly cultivated and finely&nbsp;wooded. The Tweed, which enters the county about two&nbsp;miles north of Selkirk, crosses its northern corner, eastwards by Abbotsford, Melrose, and Kelso to Coldstream.&nbsp;Its tributaries within the county are, besides the Teviot,&nbsp;the Gala, the Leader, and the Eden. One of the principal&nbsp;features of the Tweed district is the beautiful group of the&nbsp;Eildon Hills near Melrose, consisting of felspathic porphyry,&nbsp;the highest of the three peaks reaching 1385 feet. The extensive range of the Cheviots running along the Northumberland border is of similar formation. Within Roxburghshire they reach a height of over 2400 feet. The lochs are&nbsp;comparatively few, the principal being Yetholm or Primside&nbsp;Loch, and Hoselaw in Linton parish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The principal minerals are calcareous spar and quartz. The spar is frequently of a red or rose character indicating&nbsp;the presence of hematite. In the greywacke strata fossils&nbsp;are very rare, but in the Old Red Sandstone fossil fishes&nbsp;of the genus </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Pterixhthys</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Holoptychius</span><span class="font3"> are very numerous, and a great variety of plant impressions have been&nbsp;found, especially fucoids, but also vegetables of a higher&nbsp;origin, including distinct petrifactions of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Galamites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Climate and AgrieUlture.—</span><span class="font2">The mean annual temperature approximates to that of Scotland generally, but it is much warmer in the low and arable portions, where also the rainfall is much less&nbsp;than in the hilly regions. The soil varies much in different districts, being chiefly loam in the Iowand level tracts along the banks&nbsp;of the river, where it is also very fertile. In other parts a mixture&nbsp;of clay and gravel prevails, but there is also a considerable extent&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font2">mossy land. The hilly district is everywhere covered by a thick&nbsp;green pasturage admirably suited for sheep. Both in the pastoral&nbsp;and in the arable districts agriculture is in a very advanced condition. The chief attention is devoted to cattle and sheep&nbsp;rearing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Of the total area of 428,464 acres, 184,196 were in crops in 1885, 48,506 being under corn crops, 28,385 green crops, 59,937 clover,&nbsp;47,058 permanent pasture, and 310 fallow. Of the area under corn&nbsp;crops, 32,624 acres, or fully two-thirds, were occupied by oats, and&nbsp;13,355 acres by barley. Tuniips and swedes were the principal&nbsp;green crons, occupying 25,143 acres, while potatoes occupied only&nbsp;2118. Tue total number of horses was 4420, of which 3697 were&nbsp;used solely for purposes of agriculture ; of cattle 17,831, of which&nbsp;5154 were cows and heifers in milk or in calf ; of sheep 502,721 ; and&nbsp;of pigs 4783. The valued rental in 1674 was £314,633 Scots, or&nbsp;£26,219 sterling, while that in 1883-84 was £420,403 including&nbsp;railways. According to the parliamentary return of lands and&nbsp;heritages, the total number of owners was 2455, of whom 1880&nbsp;possessed less that one acre. The duke of Buccleuch possessed&nbsp;104,461 acres, or nearly a fourth of the whole ; the duke of Rox-burgho, 50,459; the countess of Home, 25,380; marquis of Lothian,&nbsp;19,740 ; and Sir William F. Elliot of Stobs, 16,475.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Manufactures.—</span><span class="font2">Though essentially an agricultural county, Roxburghshire possesses woollen manufactures of some importance,&nbsp;including tweeds, blankets, shawls, and hosiery, the principal seats&nbsp;being Hawick, Jedburgh, and Kelso.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Railways.—</span><span class="font2">The county is intersected by one of the lines of railway from Edinburgh to London (the “ Waverley ” route), which passes Melrose and Hawick. At Riccarton a branch passes south-eastwards to Newcastle. The northern district is crossed by the&nbsp;border railway from St Boswells to Kelso, Coldstream, and Berwick,&nbsp;a branch passing south from near Kelso to Jedburgh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Population.</span><span class="font2"> —⅛etween 1831 and 1881 the population increased from 43,663 to 53,442 (25,436 males, 28,006 females), but from&nbsp;1861 to 1871 there was a decrease from 54,119 to 49,407. The&nbsp;town population numbered 24,273 in 1881, the village 6627, and&nbsp;the rural 22,542. Jedburgh (population 2432) is a royal burgh ;&nbsp;it is also a police and parliamentary burgh, as is likewise Hawick&nbsp;(16,184) ; Kelso (46S7) is a police burgh. The most important&nbsp;villages are Melrose (1550), Newcastlcton (924), and Yetholm (746).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">History and Antiqtiities.—</span><span class="font2">Among the more important relics of the early inhabitants of the county are the so-called Druidical remains at Tinnishill between the j&gt;arishes of Castleton and Canonbie,&nbsp;at Ninestaneriggnear HermitageCastle, and at Plenderleath between&nbsp;the Oxnam and the Kale. Of old forts there are two of great size on&nbsp;the summits of Caerby and Tinnishill in Liddesdale, and a number&nbsp;of smaller ones in different parts of the county. On the northwest of the Eildon Hills are two fossæ or ramparts forming a&nbsp;circuit of more than a mile. On Caldshiels Hill there was another&nbsp;British fort, and between them a ditch with rampart of earth defending the country from the east. The famous Catrail, “partition of&nbsp;the fence,” the most important of the British remains in the kingdom, extended a distance of 45 miles from near Galashiels in Selkirkshire through Roxburgh to Peel Fell on the border. The Roman&nbsp;AVatling Street touched on Roxburgh at Broomhartlaw, whence passing along the mountains now forming the boundary of the county&nbsp;for a mile and a half, until it entered Scotland at Blackball, it&nbsp;turned northward by Bonjedward, Mount Teviot, Newton, Eildon,&nbsp;and Newstead to Channelkirk in the Lammermuirs. On its line&nbsp;there were important stations at Chewgreen in the Cheviots </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">O. Ad&nbsp;Fines),</span><span class="font2"> Bonjedward </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Gaxlanica),</span><span class="font2"> and Eildon Hill (? </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Trimontiitm).&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">Another Roman road, called the Maidenway from Maiden Castle&nbsp;in AVestmoreland entered Roxburgh at Deadwater, and under the&nbsp;name of the AVheelcauseway traversed the north-east corner of&nbsp;Liddesdale into Teviotdale. From AVatling Street a branch called&nbsp;the Devil’s Causeway passed to the Tweed. After forming part of&nbsp;the kingdom of Northumberland for several centuries, Roxburgh was&nbsp;relinquished along with Lothian to the Scottish king about 1020&nbsp;(see Lothian, vol. xv. p. 10). It is supposed to have been formed&nbsp;into a shire in the reign of David I., its ancient Countytown of&nbsp;Roxburgh forming, along with Edinburgh, Berwick, and Stirling,&nbsp;the court of the four burghs of Scotland, whose laws were collected by&nbsp;that king. Roxburgh Castle, between the Tweed and Teviot near&nbsp;Kelso, was a royal residence of the Saxon kings of Northumbria&nbsp;and afterwards of the Scottish monarchs. It was frequently taken&nbsp;by the English, and James II. was killed there by the bursting&nbsp;of a cannon. After this it remained in ruins till it was repaired&nbsp;by Protector Somerset, shortly after which it was demolished.&nbsp;Hermitage, in Liddesdale, the scene of Leyden’s ballad of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Lord&nbsp;Sοιιlis,</span><span class="font2"> was probably built by Nicholas de Sules in the beginning&nbsp;of the 13th century. On the forfeiture of the Soulis family in 1320,&nbsp;it was granted by Robert the Bruce to Sir John Graham of Aber-corn, and passed by the marriage of his heiress Mary to her&nbsp;husband AVilliam Douglas, knight of Liddesdale, who starved Sir&nbsp;Alexander Ramsay of Dalhousie to death in it in 1342 in revenge&nbsp;for Ramsay’s appointment as sheriff of Roxburgh by David II.&nbsp;In 1492 Archibald Douglas, fifth earl of Angus, exchanged the&nbsp;Hermitage for Bothwell Castle, on the Clyde, with Patrick Hepburn, first earl of Bothwcll ; and it was there that his descendant,&nbsp;the fourth earl, was visited in 1566 by Mary queen of Scots. The&nbsp;principal of the other old castles are Branxholm on the Teviot, long&nbsp;the residence of the Buccleuchs and the scene of Sir AValter Scott’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Lay of the Last Minstrel</span><span class="font2"> ; Cessford, on a ridge inclining towards the&nbsp;Kale, formerly of great strength, besieged in 1520 by Surrey, to whom&nbsp;itsurrendered; and Ferniehirst, the mansion of the Kers, on the Jed,&nbsp;occupying the site of a baronial fortress erected in 1410, and the&nbsp;scene of many a fray. The district was for a long time the scene of&nbsp;continual border conflicts, the leaders in which were the Armstrongs&nbsp;and other chiefs occupying the fortresses or peels, chiefly in&nbsp;Liddesdale, as at Gilknockie, Castleton, AVhitehaugh, Copshaw,&nbsp;Syde, Mangerton, Goranberry, Hartsgarth, and Newcastleton.&nbsp;Among many fine modern mansions mention may be made of&nbsp;Floors Castle, the seat of the duke of Roxburghe ; Minto House,&nbsp;the seat of the earl of Minto ; and Abbotsford, built by Sir Walter&nbsp;Scott. Few counties can boast of such important ecclesiastical&nbsp;remains as those of the abbeys of Melrose, Jedburgh, and Kelso.&nbsp;There are several ancient crosses in the county, the principal being&nbsp;those at Ancrum, Bowden, Maxton, and Melrose. Among numerous eminent men connected with Roxburgh mention may be made&nbsp;of Samuel Rutherfurd the theologian, JamesThomson, author of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The&nbsp;Seasons,</span><span class="font2"> John Leyden the poet, and Sir Gilbert Elliot of Minto.</span></p>
