                <p><label>REFINING</label> , in general, is the art of purifying a thing ; including
                    not only the effaying or refining of metals, but likewiſe the depuration or
                    clarification of liquors. See Metallurgy, Part II. Clarification; and Pharmacy.</p>
                <p>Gold and ſilver may be refined by ſeveral methods, which are all founded on the
                    effential properties of theſe metals, and acquire different names according to
                    their kinds. Thus, for inſtance, gold having the property which no other metal,
                    not even filver, has of reſiſting the action of ſulphur, of antimony, of nitrous
                    acid, of marine acid; may be purified by theſe agents from all other metallic
                    ſubſtances, and conſequently may be re-fined. Theſe operations are distinguished
                    by proper names, as <hi rend="italic">purification oſ gold by antimony,
                        parting, concentrated parting, dry parting</hi> <note anchored="true"
                            place="margin" type="authorial" n="1">See <hi rend="italic"
                                >Parting.</hi></note>. In a similar manner, as filver has the
                    property, which the imperfect metals have not, of reſiſting the action of nitre,
                    it may be refined by this ſalt : but the term <hi rend="italic">refining</hi> is chiefly applied to the purification of gold and filver by lead in the cupel.</p>
                <p>This is performed by the deſtruction, vitrification, and ſcorification, of all
                    the extraneous and deſtructible metallic ſubſtances with which they are all
                    allayed.</p>
                <p>As none but the perfect metals can refill: tlie combined action of air and fire,
                    without loſing their inflammable principle, and being changed into earthy or
                    vitreous matters, incapable of remaining any longer united with ſubſtances in a
                    metallic ſtate, there is then a poſſibility of purifying gold and ſilver from
                    all allay of imperfect metals merely by the action of fire and air ; only by
                    keeping them fuſed till all die allay be deſtroy-ed : but this purification
                    would be very expenſive, from the great conſumption of fuel, and would be
                    exceedingly tedious. Silver allayed with copper has been expofed longer than 60
                    hours to a glaſs-houſe fire -without being perfectly refined the reaſon of which
                    is, that when a fmall quantity only of imperfect metal remains united with gold
                    or filver, it is covered and protected from the action of the air, which is
                    neceſſary for the combuſtion of the imperfect metals, as of all comhuſti-ble
                    matters.</p>
                <p>This refining of gold'and ſilver merely by the action of fire·, which was the
                    only method anciently known, was very long, difficult, expenſive, and imperfect
                    ; but a much ſhorter and more advantageous method has been diſcovered. This
                    method conſiſts in adding to the al-layed gold and ſilver a certain quantity of
                    lead, and in expofing afterwards this mixture to the action of the ſire. Lead is
                    one of the metals which lofes moſt quickly and eaſily a ſufficient quantity of
                    its inflammable principle to ceaſe te be in a metallic ſtate·; but <hi
                        rend="sub"> z</hi> at thς ſame time, this metal has the remarkable property
                    of retaining, notwithſtanding the action of the ſire, enough of this ſame
                    inflammable principle to be very eaſily melted into a vitrified and powerfully
                    vitrifying matter, called <hi rend="italic">litharge.</hi></p>
                <p>The lead then which is to be added to the gold and ſilver to be refined, or
                    which happens naturally to be mixed with theſe metals, produces in their
                    refining the following advantages: 1. By increafing the proportion' of imperfect
                    metals, it prevents them from being fo well covered and protected by the perfect
                    metals.—-2. By uniting with theſe imperfect metals, it commu-nicates to them a
                    property it has of lofing very eaſily a great part of its inflammable principle.
                    3. By its vitrifying and fufing property which it exereifes with all its force
                    upon the calcined and naturally refractory parts of the other metals, it
                    facilitates and accelerates the fuſion, the ſcoriſication, and the ſeparation of
                    thefe metals. Theſe are the advantages procured by lead in the refining of gold
                    and ſilver.</p>
                <p>The lead, which in this operation is ſcorified, and' fcorifies along with it the
                    imperfect metals, ſeparates -from the metallic maſs, with which it is then
                    incapable of remaining united. It floats upon the ſurface of the melted maſs ;
                    becauſe, by loſing part of its phlogiſ-ton, it lofes alſo part of its ſpecific
                    gravity, and laſtly it vitrifies.</p>
                <p>Thefe vitrified and melted 'matters accumulating more and more upon the ſurface
                    of the metal while the operation advances, would protect this ſurface from the
                    contact of air which is ſo abſolutely neceſſary for the ſcorification of the
                    reſt, and would thus ſtop the pro-greſs of the operation, which could never be
                    ſiniſhed, if a method had not been contrived for their removal. This removal of
                    the vitrified matter is procured either by the nature of the veſſel in which the
                    melted matter is contained, and which being porous, abſorbs and imbibes the
                    ſcorified matter as faſt as it is formed, or by a chan-, nel cut in the edge, of
                    the veſſel through which the matter flows out.</p>
                <p>The veſſel in which the refining is performed is flat* and ſhallow, that the
                    matter which it contains may prefent to the air the greateſt ſurface poſſible.
                    This form reſembles that of a cup, and hence it lias been called <hi
                        rend="italic"> cupel.</hi> The furnace ought to be vaulted, that the heat
                    may be applied upon the'ſurſace of the metal during the whole time- of the
                    operation. Upon this furface a cruſt of dark-coloured pellicle is continually
                    forming. In the inſtant when all the imperfect metal is deftroyed&gt; and
                    conſequently the ſcorification ceaſes, the ſurface of the perfect metals is
                    ſeen, and appears clean and brilliant. This forms a kind of fulguration or
                    coruſ-cation. By this mark the metal is known to be refinedt If the operation be
                    ſo conducted that the metal ſuſtains only the preciſe degree of heat neceſſary
                    to keep it fuſed before it be perfectly refined, we may obſerve that it fixes or
                    becomes ſolid all at once in the very in-ſtant of the eoruſcation ; becauſe a
                    greater heat is re* quired to&gt; keep ſilver or gold in fuſion when they
                    are pure than when allayed with lead.</p>
                <p>Ί he operation of refining may be performed m finall or in large quantities,
                    upon the fame principles, but only with ſome differences in the management. As
                    the refining of final! quantities of perfect metals is performed in the ſame
                    maimer as theſe metals are eſſay ed,· thé</p>

                <p>eſſay being only a very accurate refining, we refer to the article <hi

                <p>Large quantities of ſilver are thus purified, after the operations by which that
                    metal is obtained from its ores. This ſilver, being always much allayed, is to
                    be mixed with a fufficient quantity of lead to complete its purification, unleſs
                    lead has beer, added in its firſt ſuſion from the ore, or unleſs it has been
                    extracted from an ore which alſo contains lead ; in which latter caſe, it is
                    allayed naturally with a ſufficient quantity, or more than .ſufficient, for the
                    refining of it.</p>
