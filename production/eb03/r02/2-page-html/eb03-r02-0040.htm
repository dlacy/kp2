<p><span class="font0">diminiſhed by the ſame </span><span class="font1">cauſe. </span><span class="font0">For he obſerved, that the general ſtream of a river is frequently compoſed of&nbsp;a ſort of boiling or tumbling motion, by which maſſes&nbsp;of water are brought up to the ſurface and again de-foend. Every perſon muſt recollect ſuch appearances&nbsp;in the ſreſhes of a muddy river ; and in this way Guglielmini was enabled to account in ſome meaſure for the&nbsp;diſagreement of his theory with obſervation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Mariotte had obſerved the ſame obſtructions even in the ſmootheſt glaſs pipes. Here it could not be&nbsp;aſcribed to the checks occaſioned by tranſverſe motions.&nbsp;He therefore aſcribed it to friction, which he ſuppoſed to&nbsp;diminiſh the motion of fluid bodies in the ſame manner&nbsp;as of ſolids: and he thence concludes, that the filaments&nbsp;which immediately rub on the ſides of the tube have&nbsp;their velocity gradually diminiſhed ; and that the filaments immediately adjoining to theſe, being thus obliged to paſs over them or outſtrip them, rub upon them,&nbsp;and have their own velocity diminiſhed in like manner,&nbsp;but in a ſmaller degree; and that the ſucceeding filaments towards the axis of the tube ſuffer, ſimilar but&nbsp;ſmaller diminutions. By this means the whole ſtream&nbsp;may come to have a ſmaller velocity ; and at any&nbsp;rate the medium velocity by which the quantity diſcharged is determined, is ſmaller than it would have&nbsp;beea independent of friction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Guglielmini adopted this opinion of Mariotte, and in his next work on the Motion of Rivers, conſidered&nbsp;this as the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">chief</span><span class="font0"> cauſe of the retardation ; and he added&nbsp;a third circumſtance, which he conſidered as </span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font0">no leſs&nbsp;conſequence, the viſcidity or tenacity of water. He obſerves that ſyrup, oil, and other fluids, where this viſcidity is more remarkable, have their motions prodigi-ouſly retarded by it, and ſuppoſes that water differs&nbsp;from them only in the degree in which it poſſeſſes this&nbsp;quality : and he ſays, that by this means not only the&nbsp;particles which are moving more rapidly have their motions diminiſhed by thoſe in their neighbourhood which&nbsp;move flower, but that the filaments alſo which would&nbsp;have moved more ſlowly are accelerated by their more&nbsp;active neighbours ; and that in this, manner the ſuperficial and inferior velocities are brought nearer to an&nbsp;equality. But this will never account for the univerſal&nbsp;fact, that the ſuperficial particles are the ſwifteſt of all.&nbsp;The ſuperficial particles, ſays ſhe, acquire by this means&nbsp;a greater velocity than the parabolic law allows them ;&nbsp;the medium velocity is often in the middle of the depth ;&nbsp;the numerous obſtacles, continually multiplied and repeated, cauſe the current to loſe the velocity acquired&nbsp;by the fall ; the ſlope of the bottom then diminiſhes,&nbsp;and often becomes very ſmall, ſo that the force remaining is hardly able to overcome the obſtacles which are&nbsp;ſtill repeated, and the river is reduced almoſt to a ſtate&nbsp;of ſtagnation. He obſerves, that the Rheno, a river&nbsp;of the Milaneſe, has near its mouth a ſlope of no more&nbsp;than yo&quot;, which he conſiders as quite inadequate to the&nbsp;taſk ; and here he introduces another principle, which&nbsp;he conſiders as an effential part of the theory of open&nbsp;currents. This is, that there ariſes ſrom the very depth&nbsp;of the ſtream a propelling force which reſtores a part of&nbsp;the loſt velocity. He offers nothing in proof of this principle, but uſes it to account ſor and explain the motion&nbsp;of waters in horizontal canals. The principle has been&nbsp;adopted by the numerous Italian writers on hydraulics,</span></p><a name="caption1"></a><h3><span class="font1">and, by various contrivances, ipterwoven with the para«</span></h3><div>
<p><span class="font0">bolic theory, as it is called, </span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font0">Guglielmini. Our </span><span class="font1">reader </span><span class="font0">may ſee it in various modifications in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Idraſtatica e&nbsp;Idraulica</span><span class="font0"> of P. Lecchi, and in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sperien%e Idrauliche&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">of Michelotti. It is by no means diſtinct either in its&nbsp;origin or in the manner of its application to the explanation of phenomena, and ſeems only to ſerve for giving ſomething like conſiſtency to the vague and obſcure&nbsp;diſcuſſions which have been publiſhed on this ſubject- in&nbsp;Italy. We have already remarked, that in that country the ſubject is particularly intereſting, and has been&nbsp;much commented upon. But the writers of England,&nbsp;France, and Germany, have not paid ſo much attention&nbsp;to it, and have more generally occupied themſelves with&nbsp;the motion of water in cloſe conduits, which ſeem to&nbsp;admit of a more preciſe application of mathematical reaſoning. </span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Some of thoſe have conſidered with more attention the effects of friction and viſcidity. Sir Iſaac Newton,&nbsp;with his uſual penetration, had ſeen diſtinctly the manner in which it behoved theſe circumſtances to operate.&nbsp;He had occaſion, in his reſearches into the mechaniſm&nbsp;of the celeſtial motions, to examine the famous hypo-theſis of Deſcartes, that the planets were carried round&nbsp;the ſun by fluid vortices, and law that there would be&nbsp;no end to,uncertainty and diſpute till the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">modus operandi&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">of theſe vortices was mechanically conſidered. He&nbsp;therefore employed himſelf in the inveſtigation of the&nbsp;manner in which the acknowledged powers of natural&nbsp;bodies, acting according to the received laws of mechanics, could produce and preſerve theſe vortices, and re-ſtore that motion which was expended in carrying the&nbsp;planets round the ſun. He therefore, in the ſecond .&nbsp;book of the Principles of Natural Philofophy, gives a&nbsp;ſeries of beautiful propoſitions, viz. y I, 52, &amp;c. with:&nbsp;their corollaries, ſho wing how the rotation of acylinderor&nbsp;ſphere round its axis in the midſt of a fluid will excite&nbsp;a vortical motion in this fluid ; and he aſcertains with&nbsp;mathematical preciſion the motion of every filament of&nbsp;this vortex.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">He ſets out from the ſuppofition that this motion </span><span class="font1">is-</span><span class="font0">excited in the ſurrounding ſtratum of fluid in confo-quence of a want of perfect lubricity, and affirmes as an hypotheſis, that the initial reſiſtance (or diminution&nbsp;of the motion of the cylinder) which ariſes from this&nbsp;want of lubricity, is proportional to, the velocity with&nbsp;which the ſurface of the cylinder is ſeparated from the&nbsp;contiguous ſurface of the ſurrounding fluid, and that&nbsp;the whole reſiſtance is proportional to the velocity with&nbsp;which the parts of the fluid are mutually ſeparated&nbsp;from each other. From this, and the equality of action and re-action, it evidently follows, that the velocity&nbsp;of any ſtratum of the vortex is the arithmetical medium&nbsp;between the velocities of the ſtrata immediately within&nbsp;and without it. For the intermediate ſtratum cannot&nbsp;be in equilibrio, unleſs it is as much preſſed forward by&nbsp;the ſuperior motion of the ſtratum within it, as it is&nbsp;kept back by the flower motion of the ſtratum without it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This beautiful inveſtigation applies in the moſt perfect manner to every change produced in the motion of a fluid filament, in conſequence of the viſcidity and friction of the adjoining filaments; and a filament proceeding along a tube at ſome ſmall diſtance from the ſides&nbsp;has, in like manner, a velocity which is the medium be</span><span class="font1">tween tho</span><span class="font0">ſ</span><span class="font1">e of the filament} immediately ſurrounding</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
