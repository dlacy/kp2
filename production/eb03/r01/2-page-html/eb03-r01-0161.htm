<p><span class="font2">to </span><span class="font1">haye beeħ a </span><span class="font2">general opinion among </span><span class="font1">the </span><span class="font2">Phariſees ; for although it was a notion of the ſect of the Sadducees that there was no refurrectiûn, neither angel nor&nbsp;ſpirit, yet the Pharifees, we are told, confeffed both.&nbsp;And this affertion is plainly confirmed by St Paul him-ſelf when his countrymen accufed him before Felix, &quot; I&nbsp;confeſs unto thee (ſays this eminent apoftle), that after&nbsp;the way which they call hereſy ſo worlhip I thc God&nbsp;of my fathers, believing all things which are written in&nbsp;the law and in the prophets, and having hope toward&nbsp;God, which they theml¢lves alſo allow, that there ſhall&nbsp;be a refurrection of the dead, both of the juſt and un-juſt.”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This reſurrectiort of the dead to judgment, though not perhaps in the ſame ſenſe in which the old Phariſees conceivfcd it, is now generally and almoſt univerſally (l) maintained by Chriſtians (m). Yet the Chriſtians differ conſiderably with reſpect to the nature of&nbsp;the human ſoul. Some imagine, that this ſpirit is naturally mortal, and that it is propagated along with the&nbsp;Body from the loins of the parent. In ſupport of this&nbsp;opinion, it has been obſerved that a great number of&nbsp;infects and plants transfer their lives to their poſterity,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">and </span><span class="font2">die foon after the act of propagation ; that after&nbsp;this act the vital principle is iu the moſt vigorous of&nbsp;plants and animals always found to be much exhauſted;&nbsp;and that Tertullian a father of the church, in attempt-ing ſome experiments of the kind, became fubject to a&nbsp;momentary blindneſs, and felt a portion of his ſoul </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">going</span><span class="font2"> out of him (n).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Tlreſe imagine that immortality was only conditionally promifed to man ; that Adam forfeited this immortality by his diſobedience ; and that Chriſt has teſtored lis to the hopes of it again by his ſufferings and death :&nbsp;for as in Adam we have all died, ſo in Chriſt, they&nbsp;fay, we ſhall all be made alive,; and that now the ſting&nbsp;is taken ſrom death, and the victory over our ſouls from&nbsp;the grave.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">others have conceived the human ſoul as naturally -immortal, and as ſetting death and the grave at defiance. Adam, they ſay, died only in a figure ; and&nbsp;only from the conſequences oſ this figure, which means</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">fin, has our Lord ſaved us. In this ſenfe Adam died on the very day in which he had fumed ; or he died literally in 1000 years, which with the Lord are as one&nbsp;day. To theſe arguments their opponents reply, what&nbsp;then is the victory* over death and the grave ? You muſt&nbsp;ſtill have recourfe to a new figure, and betake yourſelvefe&nbsp;to the ſecond death ; though, after all, where is your&nbsp;grave ? To this it is anſwered, that the ſoul of itſelf ⅛&nbsp;naturally immortal, and that it depends not either for&nbsp;its exiftence or the exerciſe of its faculties upon the&nbsp;body ; that the properties of matter, as figure, magnitude,&nbsp;and motion, can produce nothing that is like to per-ception, memory, and conſciouſneſs. This is true, rejoin their opponents ; but beſides theſe few properties of&nbsp;matter, which are only the objects of that philoſophf&nbsp;which has lately and properly been termed </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">mechanical,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">the chemical philoſophy has diſcovered other properties&nbsp;of matter ; has found that matter is of various kinds ;&nbsp;that it very often does not act mechanically ; that it&nbsp;acquires many new properties by combination ; and that&nbsp;no man, till farther experiment and obſervation, ſhould&nbsp;venture to affert how far the ſoul is or is not dependent&nbsp;on its preſent orgahiſed ſyſtenl. The others, proceeding&nbsp;on their hypotheſis, maintain that the ſoul, as being immaterial, is not diviſible; and though the body of a frog&nbsp;may live without the head for a whole day ; though&nbsp;the body of a tortoife may live without the head for a&nbsp;whole month ; though a human limb may for ſome mi-nutes after amputation continue to perform a vital motion, independent of a brain, a ſtomach, or a heart ;&nbsp;and though the parts of a plant, a polype, or a worm,&nbsp;may ſurvive their ieparation and become living wholes*,&nbsp;yet the ſoul, they obferve, is not to be compared with&nbsp;the vital principles of plants and animals, nor ought to&nbsp;be divided on reafons ſo ſlender a8 thoſe of analogy.&nbsp;Even granting, they ſay, that the foul were not naturally immortal of itſelf ; yet the juſtice of God, which&nbsp;is not remarkable for its equal diſtribution of rewards&nbsp;and pnniſhments in the preſent world, is bound to make&nbsp;fome amends in the next. And to this again their opponents anſwer, as to the equal diſtribution of juſtice&nbsp;in a future world, of that we are affured on much bet</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font2">^cee paraphraſt of the Canticles, afferting that the prophet Solomon had ſaid, &quot; when the dead (hall revive, it ihall come to paſs that the Mount of olives ſhall be cleft, and all the dead of Iſrael ſhall come out from thence;&nbsp;'and the juſt too that died in captivity ſhall come through the way of the caverns under the earth, and ſhall&nbsp;come forth out of the Mount of olives.” He has likewife quoted Saunderſon’s voyage to the Holy Land, in&nbsp;which, we are told that many of the Jews, by their own account, are to riſe up in the valley of Jehoſaphet ; and&nbsp;that in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">row (ng</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">devolution</span><span class="font2"> of the caverns, thoſe at </span><span class="font1">a </span><span class="font2">diſtance muſt ſcrape their wav thither with their&nbsp;nails.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">(m)</span><span class="font2"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The laſt quoted author* </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Reſurrection op the ſame Body, ajferted from the traditions of the Heathens,&nbsp;the ancient Jews, and the primitive Church}</span><span class="font2"> has endeavoured to ſhow that this doctrine, in the fame fenſe as we&nbsp;-underſtand it, has been afferted by the ancient magi, and by the preſent heathen gaurs of Perfia, the relics of the&nbsp;ancient magi ; by ſome of the ancient Arabians ; by ſome of the banians of India ; by the preſent inhabitants&nbsp;of the iſland of Ceylon, of Java, of Pegu, of Tranſiana ; by ſome amongſt the Chineſe ; by the Arderians in&nbsp;Guinea ; and by the ancient Pruſſians. The proofs which he brings, it muſt be confeffed, are not however always&nbsp;very fatisfactory. It appears, even, from h∣s own account, that ſome of theſe had derived their notions frorh&nbsp;certain Chriftians, Mahometans, or Jews. But the reader may judge of the great accuracy of his 1dea3 from&nbsp;his bringing old Pythagoras and the Stoics, and even Democritus and Epicurus, in ſupport of the ſame or a&nbsp;£milar opinion.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a><h3><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">(n)</span><span class="font1"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In illo ipſo voluptatis ultima? æftu quo genitale virus expellitur, nonne aliquid de anima quoque ſentimui&nbsp;&lt;χire, at que adeo marceffimus-et devigeſcimus cunt lucis detrimcnto.</span></h3></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
