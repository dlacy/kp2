<p><span class="font0">addition to the above, there were heavy artillery with 400 siege guns, engineers with pontoon trains, naval launches, and the&nbsp;necessary supply trains. The total Russian forces numbered&nbsp;200,000 combatants of all arms, with 850 field and 400 siege&nbsp;guns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For some months prior to the tsar’s declaration, Turkey had realized that war was inevitable, but such preparations&nbsp;as were made were far from adequate. Abdul Kerim, who&nbsp;had commanded in Servia the previous year, was still acting as&nbsp;commander-in-chief, but the task set him was not an easy&nbsp;one. With the Russians in front, the Servians and Montenegrins, whose action was known to be uncertain, on the flank,&nbsp;and the Christian population of Bulgaria, in sympathy with&nbsp;the Russians, in the midst, it required a younger and more&nbsp;energetic man, with a greater knowledge of the art of war&nbsp;than he possessed, to plan and to carry out a successful defence&nbsp;of the Moslem dominions. The prospect of war had aroused&nbsp;the Turks, and the nation had taken steps to prepare for the&nbsp;conflict, but they lacked trained leaders. The Turkish officers&nbsp;were but ill-instructed. Works on the art of war did not&nbsp;exist in the Turkish language General conscription existed&nbsp;in Turkey, but there was an entire absence of organization.&nbsp;Theoretically, each of the six districts into which the empire&nbsp;was divided should have produced an army of four corps,&nbsp;but it was only on paper. Practically the troops were not&nbsp;organized in corps. At the outbreak of war, Osman’s force,&nbsp;some 30,000 strong, was at Vidin; a few battalions were&nbsp;spread along the Danube from Vidin to Silistria, with a&nbsp;brigade of infantry at Nikopol, another at Sistova, and the&nbsp;best part of two divisions at Rustchuk. Abdul Kerim’s headquarters were at Shumla where there were two more infantry&nbsp;divisions. A cavalry division was in process of organization.&nbsp;Varna was the base of supply and was connected by rail with&nbsp;Shumla and Rustchuk. Suleiman Pasha with some 40,000&nbsp;men was still in Montenegro. The total Turkish forces in Europe&nbsp;at that time were about 120,000 men with 450 guns, but they&nbsp;were disseminated instead of being concentrated, or grouped&nbsp;in view of a rapid concentration. Abdul Kerim’s plan, or&nbsp;rather his idea, was, that the Russians would find some&nbsp;difficulty in the first place in forcing the passage of the Danube,&nbsp;and when they had succeeded in this, they would be bound&nbsp;to enter the zone of the Quadrilateral, where he hoped, operating&nbsp;with the fortresses as supports, to deal with them successfully.&nbsp;As regards the Turkish fleet, at the outset, in addition to a&nbsp;fleet of 8 ironclads helow Braila, there were 7 monitors and&nbsp;18 wooden ships of war on the Danube between Hirsova and&nbsp;Vidin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the matter of armament the Turks had the advantage. The artillery were armed with a Krupp breech-loading gun,&nbsp;which was better than the Russian bronze gun, while the&nbsp;Peabody-Martini rifles of the infantry were superior to the&nbsp;Russian Krenk. The firearm of the Turkish cavalry was the&nbsp;Winchester repeating carbine, which was inferior to the short&nbsp;Berden with which the Russian cavalry was armed. But&nbsp;this advantage in armament was discounted by the fact that,&nbsp;from motives of economy, the Turkish soldier had done but&nbsp;little rifle practice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Hostilities commenced on the 24th of April, when the Russian army advanced in three columns towards Bucharest,&nbsp;the eastern flank covered by the XI. Corps which&nbsp;marched to Galatz. By the end of May the bulk&nbsp;of the Russian forces were assembled at Bucharest&nbsp;practically opposite the intended point of passage,&nbsp;with the advanced guard under General Skobelev&nbsp;at Giurgevo, and cavalry observing the river line&nbsp;from Turnu Magureli to Kalarashi. It was now&nbsp;decided to await the arrival of the IV., XIII., and</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">XIV. Corps and the necessary bridging material for the passage of the Danube.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On June 15th the troops were disposed as follows: 8th Cavalry Division at Turnu Magureli; 12th at Oltenitza; 2nd&nbsp;at Kalarashi; Advanced Guard at Giurgevo; XI. Army Corps&nbsp;at Oltenitza and Giurgevo; VIII., XII., XIII., |IX., at&nbsp;Bucharest; |IX. at Slatina; IV. at Slobodsia; XIV. at&nbsp;Galatz; VII. at Odessa; X. in the Crimea. Meanwhile&nbsp;steam launches were brought overland, and the Russians, by&nbsp;means of torpedoes, submarine mines and their shore batteries,&nbsp;had succeeded in clearing the Danube of Turkish vessels&nbsp;between Nikopolis and Rustchuk. Two of the smaller ironclads had been sunk, the remainder of the flotilla driven under&nbsp;the shelter of the fortresses, while barricades of mines effectually&nbsp;isolated them and prevented them from again entering the zone&nbsp;of operations. Of the large ironclads on the lower Danube,&nbsp;one was sunk near Sulina, and from that time the remainder&nbsp;stayed in Sulina harbour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On June 22nd the XIV. Army Crops crossed into the Dobrudja at Galatz and advanced south, the Turkish detachment there retiring before them. Pontoons having been&nbsp;brought by rail, the necessary rafts and boats (which had&nbsp;been constructed at Slatina on the Aluta) were floated down&nbsp;to the neighbourhood of Zimnitza, and on June 24th siege&nbsp;batteries opened fire on Nikopol and Rustchuk, while the IX.&nbsp;Army Corps made a feint of crossing just below Nikopol. These&nbsp;measures were effective in confusing the Turkish commander&nbsp;as to the Russian intentions, and on the night of June 26/27th,&nbsp;r 2 companies of rifles, with a squadron and 6 guns, were landed&nbsp;on the south bank opposite Zimnitza, and within twenty-four&nbsp;hours the whole of the VIII. Corps had crossed the river. By&nbsp;July 2nd the Russians had completed a bridge over the river,&nbsp;which is 1000 yds. wide at this part. At Sistova was a&nbsp;Turkish brigade of infantry. The commander, in the early&nbsp;morning of the 27th, received information from his outposts&nbsp;of the crossing, but instead of moving with his whole force,&nbsp;sent two battalions to oppose it. The Russians drove them&nbsp;back, and when reinforced, advanced against the heights in&nbsp;rear of Sistova, which were occupied with a loss of 800 men,&nbsp;the Turkish troops retreating to Timova and Nikopol. The&nbsp;Turks had remained ignorant of the Russians’ concentration&nbsp;in Rumania and no attempt had been made to discover their&nbsp;plans. Abdul Kerim remained inactive in the fortresses of the&nbsp;Quadrilateral, and even when he heard of the crossing at&nbsp;Sistova, decided that it was but a demonstration. No measures&nbsp;were taken to observe the Russians. They were thus able&nbsp;to complete their crossing practically undisturbed, and this&nbsp;although it was never likely that the Russians would voluntarily&nbsp;select a point of passage leading into the Quadrilateral. Everything pointed to a crossing between Nikopol and Rustchuk.&nbsp;The best course for the Turks under existing circumstances&nbsp;would have been to leave garrisons in the fortresses, to observe&nbsp;the river line and to push reconnaissances to the north of the&nbsp;river, and to dispose the field army in a central position,&nbsp;whence it could concentrate on any point as soon as the enemy’s&nbsp;intentions were revealed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On June 30th Lieut.-General Gurko was put in command of a detachment composed of 10 battalions, 31 squadrons and&nbsp;3 2 guns, with which he was ordered to advance rapidly to&nbsp;Tirnova to gain possession of a pass over the Balkans,&nbsp;to damage railways and telegraphs, and to endeavour&nbsp;to stir up a Bulgarian revolt. He crossed the Danube&nbsp;by the Russian bridge on July 3rd and occupied&nbsp;Tirnova on July 7th, the Turkish garrison retreating&nbsp;to Osman Bazar. At Tirnova he learned that the&nbsp;Shipka Pass was occupied by 3000 Turks, and that none&nbsp;of the remaining passes were held in any force. He then&nbsp;determined to cross by the Hainkioi Pass and to turn&nbsp;the Shipka. He started from Timova on the 12th July, on&nbsp;which day the head of the VIII. Corps reached the town.&nbsp;Hainkioi was occupied on the 14th, a detachment of 300 Turks&nbsp;being driven away. Gurko then sent two squadrons to cut&nbsp;the telegraph at Yeni Zagra, and leaving a garrison to hold&nbsp;the pass, set out for Kazanlik on July 16th. It had been&nbsp;arranged that a force from the VIII. Corps should attack the&nbsp;Shipka Pass </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.)</span><span class="font0"> from the north on the 17th, Gurko attacking&nbsp;simultaneously from the south; but his advance was delayed</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
