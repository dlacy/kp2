<body><h2><a name="caption1"></a><span class="font2">forces are really concerned in giving motion to the dif</span><span class="font4">ferent particles.</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">Suppoſe the external force to act immediately on the external particle F. The line FC connecting this&nbsp;particle with the axis in C is either ſtretched or compreſſed by the effort of giving motion to a remote&nbsp;particle </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">A. </span><span class="font0">It is plain that, in the circumſlances&nbsp;rtpreſented in the figure, the line FC is compreſſed,&nbsp;and the axis is puſhed by it againſt its ſupports in&nbsp;the direction C<sup>z</sup> ; and the body muff, on this account, reſiſt in the oppoſite direction F∕. The particle A is dragged out of its poſition, and made to begin its motion in the direction AL perpendicular to&nbsp;AC. This cannot be, unleſs by the connection of the&nbsp;two lines AC, AF. A refills by its inertia, and therefore both AC and AF are ſtretched by dragging it into motion. By this reſiſtance the line AC tends to&nbsp;contract itſelf again, and it pulls C in the direction&nbsp;Cr, and A in the direction A </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a ;</span><span class="font0"> and if we take Cc&nbsp;to repreſent the action on C, A </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font0"> muſt be taken equal&nbsp;to it. In like manner AF is ſtretched and tends to&nbsp;contract, pulling F in the direction F</span><span class="font3">ø</span><span class="font0">  and A in the&nbsp;direction A « with equal forces. Thus the particle A is&nbsp;pulled in the directions Aa and A</span><span class="font4"><sup>α</sup></span><span class="font0"> ; the particle F is&nbsp;pulled in the direction F</span><span class="font3">ø</span><span class="font0">,and puſhed in the direction F</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ſ;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and C is pulled in the direction </span><span class="font2">C</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">c</span><span class="font0">, and puſhed in the direction C×. A</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font0"> and A</span><span class="font4"><sup>α</sup></span><span class="font0"> have produced their equivalent&nbsp;AL, by which A is dragged into motion ; F</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">f </span><span class="font0">and F</span><span class="font3">ø</span><span class="font0">&nbsp;produce their equivalent F</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">g</span><span class="font0">, by which the external&nbsp;force is refilled, and Fg is equal and oppoſite to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">m</span><span class="font0">.Gi;&nbsp;the forces </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Cc</span><span class="font0"> and C× produce their equivalent C</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">d</span><span class="font0"> by&nbsp;which the axis is preſſed on its ſupports, and this is refilled by an equal and oppoſite reaction of the ſupports&nbsp;in the direction </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">d</span><span class="font0"> C. The forces therefore which excite in the body the motion A.AL are both external,&nbsp;viz. the impelling force </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">g</span><span class="font0"> F, and the ſupporting force&nbsp; </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">d</span><span class="font0">C. AL therefore is no<sub>z</sub>t only the immediate equivalent of Aa and A</span><span class="font4">α</span><span class="font0">, but alſo the remote equivalent of&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">g</span><span class="font0"> F and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">cl C.</span><span class="font0"> We may therefore aſcertain the proportion of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">g</span><span class="font0"> F (that is, of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">m</span><span class="font0">.G</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i</span><span class="font0">) to AL (that is, of A. AC),&nbsp;independent of the property of the lever. y F is to&nbsp;AL in the ratio compounded of the ratios </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">of £</span><span class="font0"> F to F<sub>i</sub>&gt;&nbsp;or Aj, and of A« to AL. But we ſhall obtain it&nbsp;more eaſily by conſidering </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">g</span><span class="font0"> F as the equivalent of AL&nbsp;andi∕C. By what has been demonſtrated above, the directions of the three forces </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">g</span><span class="font0"> F, AL, and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">d</span><span class="font0"> C muſt&nbsp;meet in one point E, and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">g</span><span class="font0">F muſt be equal to the diagonal </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">t</span><span class="font0"> E of the parallelogram </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Eet,</span><span class="font0"> of which the&nbsp; ſides Ef, Ef are reſpectively equal to AL and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">dC.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">Now zE is to Ee as the fine of the angle </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">t e</span><span class="font0"> E to the&nbsp;fine of the angle Eze, that is, as the fine of CFA, to&nbsp;the fine of CEP, that is, as C A toCP, as we have already&nbsp;demonſtrated by the property of the lever. We preferred that demonſtration as the ſhorteſt, and as abundantly&nbsp;familiar, and as congenial with the general mechaniſm&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">of </span><span class="font0">rotatory motions. And the intelligent reader will ob-ſerve, that this other demonſtration is nothing but the demonſtration by the lever expanded into its own elements.&nbsp;Having once made all our readers ſenfible of this internal proceſs of the excitement and operation of the&nbsp;forces which connect the particles, we ſhall not again&nbsp;have recourſe to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is evident that the ſum of all the forces </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">g</span><span class="font0">F, or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">m.</span><span class="font0">G</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i</span><span class="font0"> muſt be equal to the whole moving force m.Gl.&nbsp;that </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">m</span><span class="font0">.P</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">p</span><span class="font0"> may be = </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">m.Gl.</span><span class="font0"> That is, we muſt have</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">/Ά CA<sup>z</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">m.Gl=J</span><span class="font0">—cp—; or, becauſe CP is given when the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">poſition of the line FP is given, we muſt have </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">m.Gl</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">∕A CA</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">= —c*p <sup>-</sup>, where both A and CA are variable quantities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This equation gives us </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">m</span><span class="font0">.GI.CP—∕A.CA<sup>1</sup>. Now we learn in mechanics that the energy of any force applied to a lever, or its power of producing a motion&nbsp;round the fulcrum, in oppoſition to any reſiſtance whatever, is expreſſed by the product of the force by the&nbsp;perpendicular drawn from the fulcrum on the line of&nbsp;its direction. Therefore we may call w.GI.CP the momentum @@(b), energy, or rotatory effort, of the force&nbsp;vz.GI. And in like manner/A .CA<sup>,</sup> is the ſum of&nbsp;the momenta of all the particles of the body in actual&nbsp;rotation ; and as this rotation required the momentum nz.GΣ.CP to produce it, this momentum balances,&nbsp;and therefore may expreſs the energy of all the reſiſt-ances made by the inertia of the particles to this motion of rotation. Or∕A.CA<sup>i</sup> may expreſs it. Or,&nbsp;take </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">p</span><span class="font0"> to repreſent the quantity of matter in an« particle, and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span class="font0"> to repreſent its radiu3 vector, or diſtance&nbsp;from the axis of rotation, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">fp.r<sup>x</sup></span><span class="font0"> will expreſs the momentum of inertia, and the equilibrium between the momentum of the external force </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">m.Gl,</span><span class="font0"> acting in the&nbsp;direction FP, and the combined momenta of the inertia of all the particles of the whirling body, is expreſſed by the equation </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ni.</span><span class="font0"> G I. CP =∕A. CA<sup>1</sup>, =&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Jpr<sup>x</sup>. </span><span class="font0">The uſual way of ſtudying elementary mechanics&nbsp;gives us the habit of aſſociating the word equilibrium&nbsp;with ad⅛ate of reft ; and this has made our knowledge&nbsp;fo imperfect. But there is the ſame equilibrium of the&nbsp;actual immediate preſſures when motion enſues from&nbsp;the action. When a weight A deſcending raiſes a&nbsp;ſmaller weight B by means of a thread paſſing over a&nbsp;pulley, the thread is equally ſtretched between the acting and reſiſting weights. The ſtrain on this thread&nbsp;is undoubtedly the immediate moving force acting on B,,&nbsp;and the immediate reſiſting force acting on A.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">'fp.ι^</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The ſame equation gives us GI =</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">@@@(b) The word </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">momentum</span><span class="font0"> is very careleſsly uſed by our mechanical writers. It is frequently employed to expreſs the product of the quantity of matter and velocity, that is, the quantity of motion ; and it is alſo uſed (with ſtrict&nbsp;propriety of language) to expreſs the power, energy, or efficacy of a force to produce motion in the circumstances in which it acts. We wiſh to confine it to this uſe alone. Sir Iſaac Newton adhered rigidly to this&nbsp;employment of the term (indeed no man exceeds him in preciſion of expreſſion), even when he uſed it to expreſs the quantity of motion : for in theſe inſtances the energy of this quantity of motion, as modified by the.&nbsp;circumſtances of its action, was always in the ratio of the quantity of motion.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
