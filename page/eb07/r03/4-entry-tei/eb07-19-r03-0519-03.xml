<p><label>RUE</label>
Charles de la, a French orator and poet, was born at Paris in the year 1643. He was educated at the college of the Jesuits, where he afterwards became professor of humanity and rhetoric. At an early age his talent for poetry disclosed itself. In 1667, when he was only twenty-four years old, he composed a Latin poem on the conquests of Louis XIV.; which was so much esteemed by Corneille that he translated it into French, presented it to the king, and at the same time passed so high encomiums on the superior merit of the original, that the author was received into the favour of that monarch, and ever after treated by him with singular respect.</p><p>De la Rue, anxious to preach the gospel to the Canadians, requested leave of absence from his superiors; but having destined him for the pulpit, they refused to comply with his request. Accordingly, he commenced preacher, and became one of the most eminent orators of his age. In his discourses he would probably have been too lavish of his wit, if he had not been cautioned against it by a judicious courtier. “ Continue,” said he, “ to preach as you do. We will hear you with pleasure as long as you reason with us; but avoid wit. We value the wit contained in two verses of a song more than all that is contained in most of the sermons in Lent.”</p><p>De la Rue died at Paris on the 27th of May 1725, at the advanced age of eighty-two. He was one of those who published editions of the classics for the use of the Dauphin. Virgil, which fell to his share, was published with notes and a life of the poet in 1675, 4to, and is a valuable and useful edition.</p>
