in military matters, a discharge of artillery, or small arms, or both, in honour of some person of extraordinary quality. The colours likewise salute royal persons, and generals commanding in chief, which is done by lowering the point to the ground. In the field, when a regiment is to be reviewed by the king or his general, the drums beat a march as he passes along the line, and the officers salute one another, bowing their half-pikes or swords to the ground, then recover and take off their hats. The ensigns salute all together, by lowering their colours.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Salute,</hi> in the navy, a testimony of deference or homage rendered by the ships of one nation to those of another, or by ships of the same nation to those of a superior or equal.</p><p>This ceremony is variously performed, according to the circumstances, rank, or situation, of the parties. It consists in firing a certain number of cannon, or volleys, of small arms ; in striking the colours or top-sails ; or in one or more general shouts of the whole shipâ€™s crew, mounted for that purpose on the masts or rigging.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
