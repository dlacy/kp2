<p><span class="font1">in the Russian language,” though he was introduced by his friend Kutusoff to the Grand Duke Paul as a proficient in&nbsp;that language ; but to the empress he was not personally&nbsp;known. At Petersburg he could have lived without regretting&nbsp;his country, in the society of such men as Euler and Alpinus, admired by the Russians, and beloved by the British ;&nbsp;but Cronstadt in winter was deplorably melancholy ; and in&nbsp;1773 he was induced, without much difficulty, to makc&nbsp;some little pecuniary sacrifice in accepting the professorship of natural philosophy at Edinburgh, which had become&nbsp;vacant by the death of Dr Russell, and to which he had&nbsp;been recommended by Dr Robertson, then principal of the&nbsp;university. His determination was not disapproved by the&nbsp;Russian government, who granted him a pension of about&nbsp;L.80 a year for life ; but it was only paid as long as three&nbsp;or four young men, who had accompanied him as pupils,&nbsp;continued to reside at Edinburgh ; some discontent having&nbsp;been expressed because he did not keep up a correspondence with the academy on the improvement of maritime&nbsp;education.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">He arrived at Edinburgh in September 1774. He married soon afterwards, and continued to reside in that city for the remaining thirty years of his life, paying only an annual&nbsp;visit to his native place, where he possessed a part of the&nbsp;paternal estate ; not being solicitous to extend it, although&nbsp;“ he did not diminish it otherwise than as it had been diminished before,” that is, in making provision for younger&nbsp;children. His predecessor had been very judicious and&nbsp;successful as a lecturer, though not a mathematician of the&nbsp;highest order : he had himself more practical knowledge&nbsp;and experience in mechanics, and was better acquainted&nbsp;with the foreign mathematicians, who had naturally fallen&nbsp;under his notice during his residence on the continent. His&nbsp;lectures were considered by most of his pupils as somewhat&nbsp;too difficult to be followed ; a complaint which, if it did not&nbsp;depend on their own want of preparatory information, arose&nbsp;perhaps rather more from the hasty manner of his enunciation than from the abstruseness of his matter. “ The singular facility of his own apprehension,” says Professor Playfair, “ made him judge too favourably of the same power in&nbsp;others. To understand his lectures completely was, on account of the rapidity and the uniform flow of his discourse,&nbsp;not a very easy task, even for men tolerably familiar with&nbsp;the subject. On this account his lectures were less popular than might have been expected from such a combination of talents as the author of them possessed.” This inconvenience was increased “ by the small number of experiments he introduced, and a view that he took of natural&nbsp;philosophy, which left but a very subordinate place for them&nbsp;to occupy. An experiment, he would very truly observe,&nbsp;does not establish a general proposition, and never can do&nbsp;more than prove a particular fact ;” but he seems to have&nbsp;carried this principle to some little excess : it is, in fact, the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">illustration,</span><span class="font1"> and not the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">proof,</span><span class="font1"> of general principles that is&nbsp;the object of a public exhibition of experiments ; and it is&nbsp;very doubtful whether Archimedes, or Newton, or Leibnitz,&nbsp;or Euler, would have been very successfid as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">showmen.</span><span class="font1"> With&nbsp;respect, however, to “ accuracy of definition, to clearness,&nbsp;brevity, and elegance of demonstration, and even to neatness and precision in experiments,” Professor Robison was&nbsp;very successful ; his course extended “ to every branch of&nbsp;physics and of mixed mathematics,” and entered so fully&nbsp;into the detail of each particular division of the subjects,&nbsp;that “ a more perfect system of academical instruction is&nbsp;not easily to be imagined.” Nothing, in short, was wanting,&nbsp;but so much previous knowledge of mathematics in his pupils as he thought he had a right to expect, though his expectations were too rarely fulfilled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Philosophical Society of Edinburgh had almost been suffercd to sink into oblivion after the publication of the&nbsp;third volume of its Essays, in 1756. Professor Robison became a member of it soon after his return from Russia, and&nbsp;was chosen secretary of the new society upon its formation&nbsp;by royal charter in 1783, when it incorporated with itself&nbsp;the whole of the surviving members of the former society.&nbsp;In 1798 he received the compliment of a degree of Doctor&nbsp;of Laws from the university of New Jersey ; and a similar&nbsp;honour was paid him at Glasgow the year after. In 1800&nbsp;he was elected, as successor to Dr Black, on the list of the&nbsp;foreign members of the Royal Academy of Sciences of St&nbsp;Petersburg.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In 1785 he was attacked by a severe disorder, from which he was never afterwards wholly free, though it produced little inconvenience besides pain, with some depression of spirits, which was, however, attributed rather to the&nbsp;closeness of his application than to the immediate effect of&nbsp;the disease, which was a glandular induration. For many&nbsp;years he was obliged to obtain the assistance of substitutes&nbsp;in the delivery of his lectures ; but towards the end of his&nbsp;life he w<sup>,</sup>as able again to perform the duties of the professorship in person. He continued his literary labours with&nbsp;little intermission, and was most happy in the care and attention of his wife and children, whose virtues he found the&nbsp;best alleviation of his sufferings. He took a slight cold,&nbsp;after giving a lecture, on the 28th of January 1805, and&nbsp;died on the 30th.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was comparatively late in life that Professor Robison assumed the character of an author, having communicated to the Royal Society of Edinburgh, in 1786, a paper&nbsp;on the Determination of the Orbit and Motion of the Geor-gium Sidus, which was published in the Edinburgh Transactions, vol. i. He had observed - the opposition of the&nbsp;planet with an equatorial telescope only, and he had computed the elements of its orbit with greater accuracy than&nbsp;any other astronomer had then done ; although his suspicion of the effect of such a planet on the motions of Jupiter&nbsp;and Saturn has not been confirmed by later investigations,&nbsp;the irregularities of these planets, on the contrary, having&nbsp;been otherwise explained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second paper, published in the same collection, vol.&nbsp;ii. p. 82, relates to the Motion of Light, as affected by refracting or reflecting substances which are themselves in&nbsp;motion. The author corrects some errors of Boscovich, who&nbsp;had miscalculated the effect of a water-telescope ; but he&nbsp;seems to agree with Dr Wilson in the suggestion of another&nbsp;experiment of a similar nature, which, to say the least, is&nbsp;wholly superfluous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important, beyond all comparison, of Professor Robison’s scientific publications, are the articles&nbsp;which he communicated from time to time to the third edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica, and to its Supplement.&nbsp;It was under the care of Mr Colin Macfarquhar that the&nbsp;first twelve volumes of that edition of this work were published;@@<sup>1</sup> and upon his death, in 1793, the task of continuing it was committed to Dr Gleig, to whom Professor Robison became a most essential co-operator, and from that&nbsp;time “ the work ceased to be a mere compilation.” The&nbsp;first of his contributions, according to Professor Playfair,&nbsp;was the article Optics, but it is probable he only revised&nbsp;and enlarged that article: it was followed by Philosophy, which he wrote jointly with Dr Gleig; by Physics,&nbsp;Pneumatics, Precession, Projectiles, Pumps, Resistance, Rivers, Roof, Rope-making, Rotation, Seamanship, Signal, Sound, Specific Gravity, Statics, Steam,&nbsp;Steam-Engine, Steelyard, Strength,Telescope,Tide,&nbsp;Trumpet, Variation, and Water-works; and in the</span></p><div>
