Three persons of this name enjoyed considerable literary celebrity: (1) Francisco Sanchez (Sanctius) (1523-1601), successively professor of Greek and of rhetoric at Salamanca, whose <hi rend="italic">Minerva,</hi> first printed at that town in 1587, was long the standard work on Latin grammar. (2) Francisco Sanchez, a Portuguese physician of Jewish parentage, born at Tuy (in the diocese of Braga) in 1550, took a degree in medicine at Montpellier in 1574, became professor of philosophy and physic at Toulouse, where he died in 1623; his ingenious treatise (<hi rend="italic">Quod nihil scitur,</hi> 1581) marks the high-water of reaction against the dogmatism of his time; he is said to have been distantly related to Montaigne. (3) Tomas Sanchez of Cordova (1551-1610), Jesuit and casuist, whose treatise <hi rend="italic">De matrimonio</hi> (Genoa, 1592) is more notorious than celebrated.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
