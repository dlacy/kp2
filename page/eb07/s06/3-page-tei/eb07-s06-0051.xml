The cost of the criminal tribunals of the same district was about L.140 sterling.</p><p>The taxes in Switzerland are extremely light. In Neuchâtel tliey amount on an average to about 4s. 8d. per inhabitant yearly ; in Aargau, to 2s. 6d. ; in the canton of Vaud, to 4s. 8d. The whole amount of taxes paid per individual in Thurgau, is not more than one fifth of what is paid in England per individual for the poor-rates alone. In Zürich the poor-rates are less than 2½d. per annum for each inhabitant. The civil expenditure is little more than 10d. and the military expenses less than 6d. for each.</p><p>Savings banks are very generally established in Switzerland, but the working classes seldom deposit in them any of their earnings. They are principally made use of by the children, for whom their parents deposit their savings, in order to purchase for them an equipment when their first attendance at the Lord’s Supper gives them the rights of citizens. Servants and artists also place their savings in these banks ; but the ambition of the workmen is to invest the fruits of their economy in the acquisition of a house, or of a small portion of land.</p><p>In 1817 the population of Switzerland amounted to 1,687,900, in 1827 to 1,916,000, in 1836 to 2,177,420, of whom 130,500 were Protestants, 870,000 Roman Catholics, about 3000 Jews, and a few Moravians and Anabaptists. German is spoken by about 1,560,000 people, French by 450,000, Italian by 124,000, Rumonsch and Ladin by about 42,000 in the Grisons.

He studied at Magdalen Hall, Oxford, but left that university when Oxford was garrisoned for King Charles I., and went to London, where, becoming acquainted with Dr Cox, an eminent physician, that gentleman persuaded him to apply himself to the study of physic. Accordingly, after the garrison was delivered up to the parliament, he retired again to Magdalen Hall, entered on the study of medicine, and in 1648 was created bachelor of physic. He was soon afterwards made a fellow of All-Souls College, and continued there several years. On leaving the university he settled at Westminster, became doctor of his faculty at Cambridge, grew famous for his practice, and was the chief physician in London from the year 1660 to 1670, at which period he began to be disabled by the gout. He died in 1689. His works, written in the Latin language, are highly esteemed both at home and abroad. They have often been reprint-</p></body></text></TEI>
