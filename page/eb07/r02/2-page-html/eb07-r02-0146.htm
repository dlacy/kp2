<p><span class="font1">of both. But upon the return of Cæsar, this contest was brought to a termination. The two rivals began to perceive that their power was in danger of being equalled, if&nbsp;not surpassed by a third ; and Cæsar, to lull their jealousy&nbsp;asleep, till his own designs should be matured, pointed out&nbsp;to them the risk they incurred of merely ruining each&nbsp;other, if they did not speedily compose their differences.&nbsp;He at first paid most court to Pompey, as his most formidable rival, and affected devotion to his cause, till by&nbsp;his aid, seconding his own rising fame, he procured the&nbsp;consulship. During his tenure of that office, he still more&nbsp;increased his popularity by the enactment of several salutary laws, and some of more ambiguous character. In&nbsp;particular, he carried an Agrarian law for the distribution&nbsp;of large tracts of land in Campania among the indigent&nbsp;people, and had the address, in spite of the opposition ofthe&nbsp;senate, to induce both Pompey and Crassus to aid him in&nbsp;passing it, and to act as commissioners in the distribution,&nbsp;thus sharing the odium of the measure, while the entire&nbsp;popularity remained his own.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The schemcs of Cæsar required a new element for their further development. He well knew that he could not gain&nbsp;the supreme power without an army to support his pretensions, or depend on an army without having previously&nbsp;made it completely his own. It was therefore necessary&nbsp;for him to obtain the command of a warlike province, and&nbsp;that, if possible, adjacent to Rome. Gaul was exactly suited to his purpose ; and he now directed his efforts to the&nbsp;obtaining of that appointment. Neither Pompey nor Crassus seems to have penetrated his views ; and a secret but&nbsp;strict alliance was formed between these three powerful and&nbsp;ambitious men, commonly known by the name of “ the&nbsp;first triumvirate.” The province of Gaul was allotted to&nbsp;Cæsar for a term of five years, while Pompey and Crassus&nbsp;remained at Rome ; and the compact between Cæsar and&nbsp;Pompey was confirmed by the latter marrying the daughter&nbsp;of the former.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">To complete the triumph of the triumvirs over the independent party in the senate, Cato was appointed to the government of Cyprus, and Cicero was banished through&nbsp;the intrigues of the infamous Clodius, who had obtained&nbsp;permission to relinquish his patrician rank, that he might&nbsp;be eligible for the tribuneship ; an example which was afterwards repeatedly followed by designing demagogues.&nbsp;After having accomplished this object, Clodius became so&nbsp;troublesome even to his own party, that to keep him in&nbsp;check, Pompey procured the recall of Cicero from exile,&nbsp;which he could not effect without the strenuous aid of the&nbsp;tribune Milo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the mean time, Cæsar had arrested the migration of the Helvetians, expelled the Germans from Gaul, subdued the&nbsp;Belgæ, the Aquitani, the Nervii, and other warlike Gaulish&nbsp;nations, and had also both penetrated into Germany itself,&nbsp;and crossed the sea to Britain, till then almost unknown to&nbsp;the Romans. By these exploits he raised his military reputation to an equality with that of Pompey himself, and&nbsp;formed a hardy and well-disciplined veteran army, entirely&nbsp;devoted to his will. Nor was he inattentive to the course&nbsp;of events at Rome. He found means to maintain his influence there to such a degree as to rouse the dormant jealousy of his rivals, and almost to precipitate the struggle.&nbsp;A reconciliation, however, took place ; and he obtained a&nbsp;renewal of his command in Gaul for another term of five&nbsp;years, while Crassus chose Syria for his province, and Pompey Spain and Africa. Crassus appears to have chosen&nbsp;Syria for the purpose of gratifying his passion for the acquisition of wealth ; and Pompey preferred those provinces&nbsp;which he could govern by his lieutenants, while he remained at Rome to rule the republic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This new arrangement was not destined to a lengthened existence. On his arrival in Asia, Crassus found himself&nbsp;compelled to enter into hostilities with the Parthians, to&nbsp;whose vicinity the overthrow of Mithridates had extended&nbsp;the sway of the republic in that continent. Even to the&nbsp;best of the Roman generals, the Parthians would have proved&nbsp;a formidable foe ; but Crassus was altogether destitute of the&nbsp;military talents necessary for the conduct of such a war.&nbsp;His army was entirely routed in Mesopotamia, and himself&nbsp;taken prisoner and put to death soon after the battle, by&nbsp;the Parthian general Surena.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">About the same time died Cæsar’s daughter, the wife of Pompey ; and thus not only was the triumvirate dissolved by the death of Crassus, but the alliance between&nbsp;the two survivors was greatly weakened by the death&nbsp;of Julia, who had possessed considerable influence over&nbsp;both her father and her husband. The period for tlle termination of Cæsar’s command in Gaul had nearly arrived; and&nbsp;all things seemed to indicate the approach of a mortal crisis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Each party strove to throw on bis rival the odium of beginning the fatal contest; and its actual commencement was for a time retarded by their mutual machinations. At&nbsp;length it began by Cæsar’s demanding permission to hold&nbsp;the consulship while absent. This was strenuously opposed&nbsp;by Pompey, and advocated by Cæsar’s partizans, Curio,&nbsp;Marcus Antonius, and Quintus Cassius, tribunes of the&nbsp;people. Curio succeeded in placing Pompey in what is&nbsp;termed, “ a false position,” by proposing that both he and&nbsp;Cæsar should resign their offices and retire into private life,&nbsp;which he averred that Cæsar was willing to do. Repeated&nbsp;but insincere offers were made by both parties for an accommodation ; but the senate at length passed a decree,&nbsp;commanding Cæsar to disband his army before a certain&nbsp;specified day, under the penalty of being declared a public&nbsp;enemy. The two tribunes, Antony and Cassius, interposed&nbsp;their veto ; but their prerogative was violcntly set aside,&nbsp;and the decree passed hy a large majority. Upon this Antony and Cassius fled from the city disguised as slaves, and&nbsp;sought refuge in the camp of Cæsar, who shewed to his&nbsp;soldiers the tribunes thus insulted by his enemies at Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The conduct of Cæsar had hitherto appeared to be chiefly defensive, that of Pompey and his party aggressive. It had now become necessary for Cæsar either to relinquish his&nbsp;long-cherished visions of ambition, or to become the assailant. He had completely foreseen and anticipated the crisis.&nbsp;At the head of but a small division of his army, not sufficient to create alarm, he had approached the banks of&nbsp;the Rubicon, the boundary of Italy proper, on the side of&nbsp;Cisalpine Gaul, and which he could not cross in a hostile&nbsp;manner without avowing himself a traitor to his country.&nbsp;His schemes were ripe fbr execution, his enemies were&nbsp;thoroughly roused, concealment was no longer practicable,&nbsp;his troops had declared their readiness to support their&nbsp;general and avenge the wrongs of the tribunes, all things&nbsp;urged him to the crisis ; but the dark destinies of file&nbsp;fateful hour hung heavy upon Cæsar’s spirit.@@<sup>1</sup> He retired&nbsp;early from a supper where he had entertained some of his&nbsp;principal officers, and paced to and fro on the banks of&nbsp;the Rubicon, in the deep silence of midnight, oppressed&nbsp;with thought. It probably was not the ruin to himself,&nbsp;should he now hesitate, still less the perils of the undertaking ; it was the long, black, direful train of miseries tllat&nbsp;must sweep remorselessly over his country and the world,&nbsp;all summed up, concentrated, and rendered almost visibly&nbsp;present in the one simple and brief act of that most awful&nbsp;hour, this it was that shook and appalled the heart of even&nbsp;the mighty Cæsar. He at length exclaimed, “ the die is&nbsp;cast,” sprung furiously across the slender stream, and spread&nbsp;to the morning breeze the banner of civil war.</span></p><div>
