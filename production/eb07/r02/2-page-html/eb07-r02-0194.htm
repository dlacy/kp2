<p><span class="font0">timber in it above ten feet long and four inches square. The Parliament House, and the Tron Church of Edinburgh,&nbsp;and the great hall of Tarnaway Castle, near Forres, are&nbsp;specimens of those roofs. They are very numerous on the&nbsp;Continent- Indeed Britain retains few monuments of private magnificence. Aristocratic state never was so great&nbsp;with us ; and the rancour of our civil wars gave most of the&nbsp;performances of the carpenter to the flames. Westminster&nbsp;Hall exhibits a specimen of the false taste of the Norman&nbsp;roofs. It contains the essential parts, indeed, very properly disposed ; but they are hidden, or intentionally covered,&nbsp;with what is conceived to be ornamental ; and this is an&nbsp;imitation of stone arches crammed in between slender pillars, which hang down from the principal frames, trusses,&nbsp;or rafters. In a pure Norman roof, such as Tarnaway Hall,&nbsp;the essential parts are exhibited as things understood, and&nbsp;therefore relished. They are refined and ornamented ; and&nbsp;it is here that the inferior kind of taste or the want of it&nbsp;may appear. And here we do not mean to defend all the&nbsp;whims of our ancestors ; but we assert that it is no more&nbsp;necessary to consider the members of a roof as things to&nbsp;be concealed, like a garret or privy, than the members of a&nbsp;ceiling, which form the most beautiful part of the Greek&nbsp;architecture. Should it be said that a roof is only a thing&nbsp;to keep off the rain, it may be answered, that a ceiling is&nbsp;only to keep off the dust, or the floor to be trodden under&nbsp;foot, and that we should have neither compartments in the&nbsp;one, nor inlaid work or carpets on the other. The structure&nbsp;of a roof may therefore be exhibited with propriety, and&nbsp;made an ornamental feature. This has been done even in&nbsp;Italy. The church of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome, and&nbsp;several others, are specimens ; but it must be acknowledged&nbsp;that the forms of the principal frames of these roofs, which&nbsp;resemble those of our modem buildings, are very unfit for&nbsp;agreeable ornament. As we have already observed, our&nbsp;imaginations have not been made sufficiently familiar with&nbsp;the principles, and we are rather alarmed than pleased with&nbsp;the appearance of the immense logs of timber which form&nbsp;the couples of these roofs, and hang over our heads with&nbsp;every appearance of weight and danger. It is quite otherwise with the ingenious roofs of the German and Norman&nbsp;architects. Slender timbers, interlaced with great symmetry, and thrown by necessity into figures which are naturally pretty, form altogether an object which no carpenter&nbsp;can view without pleasure. And why should the gentleman refuse himself the same pleasure of beholding scientific ingenuity?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The roof is in fact the part of the building which requires the greatest degree of skill, and where science will be of&nbsp;more service than in any other part. The architect seldom&nbsp;knows much of the matter, and leaves the task to the carpenter. The carpenter considers the framing of a great&nbsp;roof as the touchstone of his art ; and nothing indeed tends&nbsp;so much to show his judgment and his fertility of resource.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It must therefore be very acceptable to the artist to have a clear view of the principles by which this difficult problem&nbsp;may be solved in the best manner, so that the roof may&nbsp;have all the strength and security that can be wished for,&nbsp;without an extravagant expense of timber and iron. We&nbsp;have said that mechanical science can give great assistance&nbsp;in this matter. We may add, that the framing of carpentry, whether for roofs, floors, or any other purpose, affords&nbsp;one of the most elegant and most satisfactory applications&nbsp;which can be made of mechanical science to the arts of&nbsp;common life. Unfortunately the practical artist is seldom&nbsp;possessed even of the small portion of science which would&nbsp;almost insure his practice from all risk of failure ; and even&nbsp;our most experienced carpenters have seldom any more&nbsp;knowledge than what arises from their experience and natural sagacity. The most approved author in our language&nbsp;is Price in his British Carpenter. Mathurin Jousse is in</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">like manner the author most in repute in France ; but the publications of both these authors are void of every appearance of principle. It is not uncommon to see the works of&nbsp;carpenters of the greatest reputation tumble down, in consequence of mistakes from which the most elementary knowledge would have saved them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We shall attempt in this article to give an account of the leading principles of this art, in a manner so familiar and&nbsp;palpable, that any person who knows the common properties of the lever, and the composition of motion, shall so far&nbsp;understand them as to be able, on every occasion, so to dispose his materials, with respect to the strains to which they&nbsp;are to be exposed, that he shall always know the effective&nbsp;strain on every piece, and shall, in most cases, be able to&nbsp;make the disposition such as to derive the greatest possible&nbsp;advantage from the materials which he employs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is evident that the whole must depend on the principles which regulate the strength of the materials, relative to the manner in which this strength is exerted, and the&nbsp;manner in which the strain is laid on the piece of matter.&nbsp;With respect to the first, this is not the proper place for&nbsp;considering it, and we must refer the reader to the article&nbsp;Strength op Materials in Mechanics. We shall just&nbsp;borrow from that article two or three propositions suited to&nbsp;our purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The force with which the materials of our edifices, roofs, floors, machines, and framings of every kind, resist being&nbsp;broken or crushed, or pulled asunder, is immediately or ultimately the cohesion of their particles. When a weight&nbsp;hangs by a rope, it tends either immediately to break all&nbsp;the fibres, overcoming the cohesion amongst the particles of&nbsp;each, or it tends to pull one parcel of them from amongst the&nbsp;rest, with which they are joined. This union of the fibres&nbsp;is brought about by some kind of gluten, or by twisting,&nbsp;which causes them to bind each other so hard that any one&nbsp;will break rather than come out, so much is it withheld by&nbsp;friction. The ultimate resistance is therefore the cohesion&nbsp;of the fibre ; and the force or strength of all fibrous materials,&nbsp;such as timber, is exerted in much the same manner. The&nbsp;fibres are either broken or pulled out from among the rest.&nbsp;Metals, stone, glass, and the like, resist being pulled asunder by the simple cohesion of their parts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The force which is necessary for breaking a rope or wire is a proper measure of its strength. In like manner, the&nbsp;force necessary for tearing directly asunder any rod of wood&nbsp;or metal, breaking all its fibres, or tearing them from amongst&nbsp;each other, is a proper measure of the united strength of all&nbsp;these fibres ; and it is the simplest strain to which they&nbsp;can be exposcd, being just equal to the sum of the forces&nbsp;necessary for breaking or disengaging each fibre. And, if&nbsp;the body is not of a fibrous structure, which is the case with&nbsp;metals, stones, glass, and many other substances, this force is&nbsp;still equal to the simple sum of the cohesive forces of each&nbsp;particle which is separated by the fracture. Let us distinguish this mode of exertion of the cohesion of the body by&nbsp;the name of its </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">absolute strength.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When solid bodies are, on the contrary, exposed to great compression, they can resist only a certain degree. A piece&nbsp;of clay or lead will be squeezed out ; a piece of freestone&nbsp;will be crushed to powder ; a beam of wood will be crippled, swelling out in the middle, and its fibres lose their&nbsp;mutual cohesion, after which it is easily crushed by tile&nbsp;load. A notion may be formed of the manner in which&nbsp;these strains are resisted, by conceiving a cylindrical pipe&nbsp;filled with small shot, well shaken together, so that each&nbsp;sphericle is lying in the closest manner possible, that is,&nbsp;in contact with six others in the same vertical plane, this&nbsp;being the position in which the shot will take the least&nbsp;room. Thus each touches the rest in six points. Now&nbsp;suppose them all united, in these six points only, by some&nbsp;ccment. This assemblage will stick together and form a</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
