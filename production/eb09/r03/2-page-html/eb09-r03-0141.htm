        <p><span class="font2">The Forum Pacis, built by Vespasian, was farther to the southeast ;
                the only existing piece, a massive and lofty wall of mixed tufa and peperino, with a
                travertine archway, is opposite the end&nbsp;of the basilica of Constantine. The
                arch opened into what was&nbsp;probably the Templum Sacræ Urbis, which contained a
                plan of the&nbsp;city of Rome. The original plan was probably burnt with
                the&nbsp;whole group of buildings in this forum in 191, in the reign of Coni-niodus
                (Dion Cass., Ixxii. 24) ; but a new plan engraved on marble&nbsp;was made, and the
                building restored in concrete and brick by&nbsp;Severus. The north-east end wall,
                with the clamps for fixing the&nbsp;marble plan, still exists, as does also the
                other (restored) end wall&nbsp;with its arched windows towards the forum (see fig.

                deified son Romulus ; like the&nbsp;other buildings of Maxentius, it was rededicated
                and inscribed with&nbsp;the name of his conqueror Constantine.@@<sup>3</sup> The
                original stone building of Vespasian was probably an archive and record office ;
                the&nbsp;name Templum Sacræ Urbis is with much probability given to it&nbsp;by
                Jordan, partly on the authority of an inscription now in the&nbsp;Vatican (see

        <p><span class="font2">The forum of Nerva (see fig. 18) occupied the narrow strip left
                between the fora of Augustus and Vespasian ; being little more&nbsp;than a richly
                decorated street, it was called the Forum Transitorium&nbsp;or Forum Palladium, from
                the temple to Minerva which it contained. It was begun by Domitian, and dedicated by
                Nerva in 97&nbsp;(see Suet., </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"

                imperial&nbsp;fora, it was surrounded by a peperino wall, not only lined
                with&nbsp;marble but also decorated with rows of Corinthian columns supporting a
                rich entablature with sculptured frieze. Two columns&nbsp;and part of this wall
                still exist ; on the frieze are reliefs of weaving, fulling, and various arts which
                were under the protection of&nbsp;Minerva. A great part of the temple existed till
                the time of Paul&nbsp;V., who in 1606 destroyed it to use the
                    Columnselsewhere.@@<sup>6</sup> In&nbsp;the reign of Severus Alexander

                was a&nbsp;bronze column inscribed with his “res gestæ” (Lamprid., </span><span

        <p><span class="font2">The forum of Trajan with its adjacent buildings was the last and, at
                least in size, the most magnificent of all ; it was in progress from&nbsp;100 to
                117. A great spur of hill, which connected the Capitoline&nbsp;with the Quirinal,
                was cut away to make a level site for this enormous group of buildings. It consisted
                (see fig. 20) of a large dipteral</span></p>
