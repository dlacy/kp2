        <p><span class="font2">provinces ” were to be assigned by lot in the old way to ex-consuls
                and ex-prætors, and to be nominally under the&nbsp;control of the senate ; but in 23
                even their governors were&nbsp;declared to be generally subordinate to Octavian as
                the&nbsp;holder of a higher authority (“ majus imperium).”@@<sup>1</sup>
                In&nbsp;addition to this control, direct and indirect, of all the provinces,
                Octavian received also the sole and supreme command of all the military and naval
                forces of the empire.&nbsp;He alone henceforth levies, pays, and dismisses
                soldiers,&nbsp;equips fleets, and orders the movements of both army and&nbsp;navy,
                and he was granted in addition full authority to&nbsp;wage war and conclude treaties
                with whom he would.@@<sup>2&nbsp;</sup>Finally, in 23, if not in 27, he was exempted
                from the&nbsp;law which required the proconsul to lay down his “ imperium ” on
                entering Rome, and was allowed to exercise it&nbsp;within the sacred limits of the
                    pomœrium,@@<sup>3</sup> a privilege&nbsp;which facilitated the introduction into
                the city of the prefects, prætorian guard, and summary jurisdiction proper&nbsp;to
                the proconsul in the province. This “ proconsular&nbsp;imperium ” was granted in the
                first instance for ten years,@@<sup>4&nbsp;</sup>but was renewed for periods of
                five, five, and ten years&nbsp;successively, and the fiction of its temporary
                duration and&nbsp;periodic renewal was maintained under Augustus’s successors by the
                celebration every ten years of the “ decen-nalia.”@@<sup>5</sup> The
                Supremeimportanceattached to its possession as the mainstay of the imperial power is
                sufficiently&nbsp;indicated by the fact that the man on whom it is conferred becomes
                thereby “ princeps,” and the day on which&nbsp;he receives it (“ dies imperii ”)
                marks the beginning of his&nbsp;reign.@@<sup>6</sup></span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">The proconsular imperium not only carried with it the control of the
                army and the provinces, but in Rome itself&nbsp;it gave its holder a position of
                precedence. In virtue of&nbsp;it he took his seat between the consuls, was
                preceded&nbsp;by Iictors,@@<sup>7</sup> and wore the laurel wreath,
                paludamentum,&nbsp;and sword of the imperator. But as yet Rome could not&nbsp;be
                governed like a subject provincial city by proconsular&nbsp;authority ; and, for the
                necessary direction and regulation&nbsp;of the constitutional machinery which he had
                restored,&nbsp;Augustus contented himself@@<sup>8</sup> with the authority
                which&nbsp;traditionally invested its holder with a popular leadership,&nbsp;that of
                the tribunes of the plebs. The “tribunicia&nbsp;potestas ” had been granted him for
                life in 36,@@<sup>9</sup> and his&nbsp;tenure of it was confirmed in
                    23.@@<sup>lθ</sup> Thenceforward it&nbsp;ranked as a constituent element of the
                principate, second&nbsp;in inιportance only to the proconsular authority.
                With&nbsp;but few exceptions it was conferred for life upon all&nbsp;succeeding
                emperors, and the years of their reigns are&nbsp;reckoned by the years of their
                tribunician power. It was&nbsp;conferred, as all special “ potestas ” had been
                conferred&nbsp;under the republic, by a decree of the senate and vote of&nbsp;the
                    assembly.@@<sup>11</sup> It eave its holder all the prerogatives of</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">the tribunate, without the restrictions which hampered the tribunes
                themselves. Augustus and his successors were&nbsp;unimpeded in its exercise by the
                presence of colleagues ;&nbsp;and both their personal inviolability and their right
                of&nbsp;interference held good outside the pomœrium. It enabled&nbsp;them, as
                representing the acknowledged protectors of the&nbsp;plebs, to control in the name
                of the people the whole&nbsp;administrative machinery, to introduce laws, to
                convene&nbsp;the senate, to protect the aggrieved, and to interfere with&nbsp;any
                exercise of authority by other magistrates. In short,&nbsp;it gave to the man who
                already wielded an authority&nbsp;abroad more absolute than that granted to Pompey
                by the&nbsp;Gabinian law all and more than all the power possessed&nbsp;by a
                Gracchus in Rome.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">It was on these two powers that Augustus’s position as princeps
                rested. In virtue of these he was chief magistrate&nbsp;of the Roman state, and all
                other offices and privileges&nbsp;conferred upon him are comparatively of secondary
                importance. The consulship which he held continuously from&nbsp;31 up to 23 he never
                accepted again but on two occasions, in 5 B.c. and in 2 </span><span class="font0"
                    >B.c.,@@<sup>12</sup>
            </span><span class="font2">though he was twice invested&nbsp;with “ consular authority ”
                for the purpose of taking the&nbsp;census </span><span class="font2"
                style="font-variant:small-caps;">(8b.c.,</span><span class="font2"> 14 </span><span

                class="font2"> That he ever received an extraordinary “ morum legumque regimen,” as
                stated by Suetonius and Dio,@@<sup>14</sup> is extremely doubtful, and his
                language&nbsp;in the Ancyran monument implies that for this purpose,&nbsp;as for
                many others, he found the tribunician authority&nbsp;sufficient.@@<sup>15</sup> In
                22 </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.</span><span
                class="font2"> he was invested with the “ cura&nbsp;annonae,”@@<sup>16</sup> the
                supervision of the corn supply and the&nbsp;corn largesses at Rome. On the death of
                Lepidus in 12&nbsp;B.c. he succeeded him as “ pontifex maximus,” and he
                was&nbsp;also a member of the augural and other priestly
                    colleges.@@<sup>17&nbsp;</sup>Lastly, at various times, and probably by decree
                of the&nbsp;senate, he was granted a number of special exemptions&nbsp;and
                    privileges.@@<sup>18</sup></span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">In theory at least, the Roman world was governed according to the
                “maxims of Augustus”@@<sup>19</sup> down to the&nbsp;time of Diocletian. Even in the
                3d century there is&nbsp;still, in name at least, a republic, of which the
                emperor&nbsp;is in strictness only the chief magistrate, deriving his&nbsp;authority
                from the senate and people, and with prerogatives limited and defined by law. The
                case is quite&nbsp;different when we turn from the theory to the practice.&nbsp;The
                division of authority between the republic and its&nbsp;chief magistrate became
                increasingly unequal. Over the&nbsp;provinces the princeps from the first ruled
                autocratically ;&nbsp;and this autocracy reacted upon his position in Rome,
                so&nbsp;that it became every year more difficult for a ruler so&nbsp;absolute abroad
                to maintain even the fiction of republican&nbsp;government at home. The republican
                institutions, with the&nbsp;partial exception of the senate, lose all semblance of
                authority outside Rome, and even in their altered position as the&nbsp;municipal
                institutions of the chief city of the empire they&nbsp;retain but little actual
                power. The real government even&nbsp;of Rome passes gradually into the hands of
                imperial prefects and commissioners, and the old magistracies become&nbsp;merely
                decorations which the emperor gives away at his&nbsp;pleasure. And at the same time
                the rule of the princeps&nbsp;assumes an increasingly personal character, and the
                whole&nbsp;work of government is silently concentrated in his hands&nbsp;and in
                those of his own subordinate officials. Closely&nbsp;connected with this change is
                the different aspect presented by the history of the empire in Rome and Italy
