<p><span class="font1">of Tübingen has been exaggerated, in so far as regards the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Life of Jesus.</span><span class="font1"> The book appeared on the 23rd of June 1863; before&nbsp;November sixty thousand copies of it were in circulation.&nbsp;Renan still used his literary gifts to pursue a scientific ideal.&nbsp;In the days when he had composed his huge, immature treatise&nbsp;on the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Future of Science,</span><span class="font1"> he had written: “ I envy thc man who&nbsp;shall evoke from the past the origins of Christianity. Such a&nbsp;writer would compose the most important book of the century.”&nbsp;He set to work to realize this project, and produced the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Apostles&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">in 1866, and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">St Paul</span><span class="font1"> in 1869, after having visited Asia Minor&nbsp;with his wife, where he studied the scenes of the labours of&nbsp;St Paul as minutely as Jn 1861 he had observed the material&nbsp;surroundings of the life of Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Renan was not only a scholar. In </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">St Paul,</span><span class="font1"> as in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Apostles, </span><span class="font1">he shows his concern with the larger social life, his sense of&nbsp;fraternity, and a revival of the democratic sentiment which&nbsp;had inspired </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">HAvenir de la science.</span><span class="font1"> In 1869 he presented&nbsp;himself as the candidate of the liberal opposition at the parliamentary election for Meaux. While his temper had become&nbsp;less aristocratic, his Liberalism had grown more tolerant. On&nbsp;the eve of its dissolution Renan was half prepared to accept the&nbsp;Empire, and, had he been elected to the Chamber of Deputies,&nbsp;he would have joined the group of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">V Empire liberal.</span><span class="font1"> But he&nbsp;was not elected. A year later war was declared with Germany,&nbsp;the Empire fell, and Napoleon III. went into exile. The&nbsp;Franco-German War was a turning-point in Renan’s history.&nbsp;Germany had always been to him the asjdum of thought and&nbsp;disinterested science. Now he saw the land of his ideal destroy&nbsp;and ruin the land of his birth; he beheld the German no longer&nbsp;as a priest, but as an invader. His heart turned to France. In&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">La Réforme intellectuelle et morale</span><span class="font1"> (1871) he endeavoured at&nbsp;least to bind her wounds, to safeguard her future. Yet he&nbsp;was still under the influence of Germany. The ideal and the&nbsp;discipline which he proposed to his defeated country were those&nbsp;of her conqueror—a feudal society, a monarchical government,&nbsp;an </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">élite,</span><span class="font1"> which the rest of the nation exists merely to support&nbsp;and nourish; an ideal of honour and duty imposed by a chosen&nbsp;few on the recalcitrant and subject multitude. The errors of&nbsp;the Commune confirmed Renan in this reaction. At the same&nbsp;time the irony always perceptible in his work grows more bitter.&nbsp;His </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dialogues philosophiques,</span><span class="font1"> written in 1871, his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ecclesiastes&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(1882) and his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Antichrist</span><span class="font1"> (1876) (the fourth volume of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Origins of Christianity,</span><span class="font1"> dealing with the reign of Nero) are&nbsp;incomparable in their literary genius, but they are examples of&nbsp;a disenchanted and sceptical temper. He had vainly tried to&nbsp;make his country follow his precepts. He resigned himself to&nbsp;watch her drift towards perdition. The progress of events&nbsp;showed him, on the contrary, a France which every day left a&nbsp;little stronger, and he aroused himself from his disbelieving,&nbsp;disillusioned mood, and observed with genuine interest the&nbsp;struggle for justice and liberty of a democratic society. For&nbsp;his mind was the broadest of the age. The fifth and sixth&nbsp;volumes of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Origins of Christianity</span><span class="font1"> Ifthe </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Christian Church</span><span class="font1"> and&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Marcus Aurelius)</span><span class="font1"> show him reconciled with democracy, confident&nbsp;in the gradual ascent of man, aware that the greatest catastrophes&nbsp;do not really interrupt the sure if imperceptible progress of the&nbsp;world—reconciled also in some measure, if not with the truths,&nbsp;at least with the moral beauties of Catholicism, and with the&nbsp;remembrance of his pious youth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">On the threshold of old age the philosopher cast a glance at the days of his childhood. He was nearly sixty when, in 1883,&nbsp;he published those </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Souvenirs Penfance et de jeunesse</span><span class="font1"> which,&nbsp;after the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Life of Jesus,</span><span class="font1"> are the work by which he is chiefly&nbsp;known. They possess that lyric note of personal utterance&nbsp;which the public prizes in a man already famous. They showed&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">blasé</span><span class="font1"> modern reader that a world no less poetic, no less&nbsp;primitive than that of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Origins of Christianity</span><span class="font1"> exists, or still&nbsp;existed within living memory, on the north-western coast of&nbsp;France. They have the Celtic magic of ancient romance and&nbsp;the simplicity, the naturalness, the veracity which the 19th&nbsp;century prized so highly. But his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ecclesiastes,</span><span class="font1"> published a few&nbsp;months earlier, his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Drames philosophiques,</span><span class="font1"> collected in 1888,·&nbsp;give a more adequate image of his fastidious critical, disenchanted, yet not unhopeful spirit. These books arc often bitter&nbsp;and melancholy, yet not destitute of optimism. They show the&nbsp;attitude towards uncultured Socialism of a philosopher liberal&nbsp;by conviction, by temperament an aristocrat. Wc learn in&nbsp;them how Caliban (democracy), the mindless brute, educated&nbsp;to his own responsibility, makes after all an adequate ruler;&nbsp;how Prospero (the aristocratic principle, or, if we will, the mind)&nbsp;accepts his dethronement for the sake of greater liberty in the&nbsp;intellectual world, since Caliban proves an effective policeman,&nbsp;and leaves his superiors a free hand in the laboratory; how&nbsp;Ariel (the religious principle) acquires a firmer hold on life, and&nbsp;no longer gives up the ghost at the faintest hint of change.&nbsp;Indeed, Ariel flourishes in the service of Prospero under the&nbsp;external government of thc many-headed brute. For the&nbsp;one thing needful is not destined to succumb. Religion and&nbsp;knowledge are as imperishable as the world they dignify. Thus&nbsp;out of the depths rises unvanquished the essential idealism of&nbsp;Ernest Renan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Renan was a great worker. At sixty years of age, having finished the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Origins of Christianity,</span><span class="font1"> he began his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">History of Israel,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">based on a lifelong study of the Old Testament and on the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Corpus Inscriptianurn Semiticarum,</span><span class="font1"> published by the Académie&nbsp;des Inscriptions under Renan’s direction from the year 18S1&nbsp;till the end of his life. The first volume of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">History of Israel&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">appeared in 1887, the third and finest volume in 1891, the last&nbsp;two only after the historian’s decease. As a history of facts and&nbsp;theories the book has many faults; as an essaÿ on the evolution&nbsp;of the religious idea it is (despite some passages of frivolity,&nbsp;irony, or incoherence) of extraordinary importance; as a reflection of the mind of Ernest Renan it is the most lifelike of images.&nbsp;In a volume of collected essays, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Feuilles détachées,</span><span class="font1"> published&nbsp;also in 1891, we find the same mental attitude, an affirmation&nbsp;of the necessity of piety independent of dogma. On the 12th&nbsp;of October 1892 he died after a few’ days’ illness. In his last&nbsp;years he received many marks of honour, being made an&nbsp;administrator of the Collège de France and grand officer of the&nbsp;Legion of Honour. Two volumes of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">History of Israel,</span><span class="font1"> his&nbsp;correspondence with his sister Henriette, his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Letters to M.&nbsp;Berthelot,</span><span class="font1"> and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">History of the Religious Policy of Philippe-Ie-Bel,</span><span class="font1"> which he wrote in the years immediately before his marriage,&nbsp;all appeared during the last eight years of the 19th century.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RENARD, ALPHONSE FRANÇOIS (1842-71903), Belgian geologist and petrographer, was born at Renaix, in Eastern Flanders, on the 27th of September 1842. He was educated for the church&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font1">Rome, and from 1866 to 1869 he was superintendent at the&nbsp;Collège de la Paix, Namur. In 1870 he entered the Jesuit Training College at the old abbey of Maria Laach in the Eifel, and&nbsp;there, while engaged in studying philosophy and science, he&nbsp;became interested in the geology of the district, and especially&nbsp;in the volcanic rocks. Thenceforth he worked at chemistry&nbsp;and mineralogy, and qualified himself for those petrographical&nbsp;researches for which he was distinguished. In 1874 he became&nbsp;professor of chemistry and geology in the college of the Belgian&nbsp;Jesuits at Louvain, a few years later he was appointed one of&nbsp;the curators of the Royal Natural History Museum at Brussels,&nbsp;and in 1882 he relinquished his post at Louvain. In 1S8S he&nbsp;was chosen professor of geology at the university of Ghent, and&nbsp;retained the post until the close of his life. Meanwhile he had&nbsp;been ordained priest in 1877, and had intended to enter the&nbsp;Society of Jesus. He was known as the Abbé Renard; but, as&nbsp;remarked by Sir A. Geikie, “ As years passed, the longing for&nbsp;mental freedom grew ever stronger, until at last it overmastered&nbsp;all the traditions and associations of a lifetime, and he finally&nbsp;separated himself from the church of Rome.” His first work,</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
