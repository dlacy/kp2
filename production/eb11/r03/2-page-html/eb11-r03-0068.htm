<p><span class="font2">Rio de Janeiro is the seaport for a large area of the richest, most productive and most thickly settled parts of Brazil, including the&nbsp;states of Rio dc Janeiro and Minas Gcraes and a small part of&nbsp;eastern Säo Paulo. Its exports include coffee, sugar, hides, cabinet&nbsp;woods, tobacco and cigars, tapioca, gold, diamonds, manganese&nbsp;and sundry small products. Rio is also a distributing centre in the&nbsp;coasting trade, and many imported products, such as jerked beef&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">{carne secca),</span><span class="font2"> hay, flour, wines, &amp;c., appear among the coastwise&nbsp;exports, as well as domestic manufactures. The total exports for&nbsp;1905 were officially valued at 62,572,033 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">milreis</span><span class="font2"> gold, or a little&nbsp;over one-sixth the exportation of the whole country. Formerly&nbsp;Rio led all other ports in the export of coffee, but the enormous&nbsp;increase in production </span><span class="font1">in </span><span class="font2">the state of Sao Paulo has given Santos&nbsp;the lead. The exports of coffee from Rio in 1908 amounted to&nbsp;3,062,268 bags of 60 kilogrammes each, officially valued at about&nbsp;&gt;27,846,000. The coffee-producing area tributary to this port is&nbsp;slowly decreasing, owing to the exhaustion of the soil and the&nbsp;greater productiveness of Sao Paulo. The imports include wheat,&nbsp;flour, Indian corn, jerked beef </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">{carne secca),</span><span class="font2"> lard, bacon, wines and&nbsp;liquors, butter, cheese, conserves of all kinds, coal, cotton, woollen,&nbsp;linen and silk textiles, boots and shoes, earthen- and glasswares,&nbsp;railway material, machinery, furniture, building material, including&nbsp;pine lumber, drugs and chemicals, and hardware. The imports&nbsp;for 1905 aggregated 103,874,724 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">milreis</span><span class="font2"> gold, or about two-fifths&nbsp;the importation of the whole republic. The shipping arrivals in&nbsp;1908 were as follows: from foreign ports, 1195 steamers of 3,479,357&nbsp;tons and 75 sailing vessels of 84,474 tons; from national ports,&nbsp;243 foreign steamers of 582,633 tons, 773 national steamers of 475,587&nbsp;tons and 294 national sailing vessels of 20,250 tons—in all 2580 vessels&nbsp;of 4,642,301 tons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Manufactures.</span><span class="font2">—The industrial activities of Rio Janeiro have been largely increased since the organization of the republic through&nbsp;increased import duties on foreign products. There were a number&nbsp;of protected industries before this, but they made slight impression&nbsp;on imports. Rio de Janeiro has manufactures of flour from imported&nbsp;wheat, cotton, woollen and silk textiles, boots and shoes, readymade clothing, furniture, vehicles, cigars and cigarettes, chocolate,&nbsp;fruit conserves, refined sugar, biscuits, macaroni, ice, beer, artificial&nbsp;liquors, mineral waters, soap, stearine candles, perfumery, feather&nbsp;flowers, printing type, &amp;c. There are numerous machine end repair&nbsp;shops, the most important of which are the shops of the Central&nbsp;railway. One of the most important industrial enterprises in the&nbsp;city is the electric plant belonging to the Rio de Janeiro Light&nbsp;and Power Company, which supplies electric currents for public&nbsp;and private lighting, and power for the tramways and many&nbsp;industries. The hydro-electric works are situated about 50 m.&nbsp;N.W. of the city in a valley of the Serra do Mar, where a large&nbsp;reservoir has been created by building a dam across the <sup>r</sup>Rio das&nbsp;Lages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Government.—</span><span class="font2">Rio de Janeiro is governed by a prefect, who represents the national government, and a municipal council which&nbsp;represents the people. The prefect is appointed by the President&nbsp;of the republic for a term of four years, and the appointment must&nbsp;be confirmed by the Senate. There are seven </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">directories,</span><span class="font2"> or boards,&nbsp;under the prefect, each one assigned to a special field of work, chief&nbsp;among which are education, health and public assistance, public&nbsp;works and transportation, and finance. The municipal council is&nbsp;elected by direct suffrage for a term of two years, and is composed&nbsp;of 15 members. The funded debt of Jhe city on the 30th of June&nbsp;1907 was £7,000,677, a part of which is guaranteed by the national&nbsp;government. There is * some confusion in administration and&nbsp;accounts, however, and it is sometimes, difficult to determine the&nbsp;exact situation. The Federal District is represented in Congress&nbsp;by 2 senators and 10 deputies, and is credited with the rights and&nbsp;privileges of citizenship. On the other hand, the city is a garrison&nbsp;town and a district under the.direct administration ol the national&nbsp;executive, who appoints its chief executive, controls its police force,&nbsp;and exercises part control over its streets, squares and water front.&nbsp;In the work of improving the city, the national government assumed&nbsp;the expense of the commercial quays, the filling of the Sao Christovao&nbsp;bay, the opening of. the Mangue canal and its embellishment, the&nbsp;opening of the Avenida Central, the extension of the sewage system&nbsp;and the addition of new sources to the water supply, while the city&nbsp;was responsible for the Avenida Beira-Mar, the opening of a new&nbsp;avenue from the Largo da Lapa westward to Rua Frei Caneca, the&nbsp;removal of the Morro do Senado, the widening of some streets&nbsp;crossing the Avenida Central and the opening and straightening of&nbsp;other streets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">History.</span><span class="font2">—The discovery of the Bay of Rio de Janeiro is attributed by many Portuguese writers to André Gonçalves,&nbsp;who entered its waters on the ist of January 1502, and believed&nbsp;that it was the mouth of a great river, hence the name Rio de&nbsp;Janeiro (River of January). Another Portuguese navigator,&nbsp;Martim Affonso de Souza, visited it in 1531, but passed on to&nbsp;Säo Vicente, near Santos, where he established a colony. The&nbsp;first settlement in the bay was made by an expedition of French&nbsp;Huguenots under the command OfNicholasDurandVilIegaignon,&nbsp;who established his colony on the small island that bears his&nbsp;name. In 1560 their fort was captured and destroyed by a&nbsp;Portuguese expedition from Bahia under Mem de Sâ, and in&nbsp;1567 another expedition under the same commander again&nbsp;destroyed the French settlements, which had spread to the&nbsp;mainland. The victory was won on the 20th of January, the&nbsp;feast-day of St Sebastian the Martyr, who became the patron&nbsp;saint of the new settlement and gave it his name—Sao Sebastiao&nbsp;do Rio de Janeiro. The French had named their colony La&nbsp;France Antarctique, and their island fort had been called Fort&nbsp;Coligny. In 1710 a French expedition of five vessels and about&nbsp;1000 men under Duclerc attempted to regain possession, but was&nbsp;defeated; its commander was captured and later assassinated.&nbsp;This led to a second French expedition, under Duguay Trouin,&nbsp;who entered the bay on the 12th of September 1711, and captured&nbsp;the town on the 22nd. Trouin released Duclerc<sup>i</sup>S imprisoned&nbsp;followers, exacted a heavy ransom and then withdrew. The&nbsp;discovery of gold in Minas Geraes at the end of the 17th century&nbsp;greatly increased the importance of the town. It had been made&nbsp;the capital of the southern captaincies in 1680, and in 1762 it&nbsp;became the capital of all Brazil. In 1808 the fugitive Portuguese&nbsp;court, uhder the regent Dom Joao VI., took refuge in Rio de&nbsp;Janeiro, and gave a new impulse to its growth. It was thrown&nbsp;open to foreign commerce, foreign mercantile houses were&nbsp;permitted to settle there, printing was introduced, industrial&nbsp;restrictions were removed, and a college of medicine, a military&nbsp;academy and a public library were founded. Dom Joao VL&nbsp;returned to Portugal in 1821, and on the 7th of September 1822&nbsp;Brazil was declared independent and Dom Pedro I. became its&nbsp;first emperor. There was no resistance to this declaration in&nbsp;Rio de Janeiro. There were some political disorders during the&nbsp;reign of Dom Pedro I., who was finally harassed into an abdication in favour of his son, Dom Pedro II., on the 7th of April 1831.&nbsp;The regency that followed was one of many changes, and led in&nbsp;July 1840 to a declaration of the young prince’s majority at the&nbsp;age of fifteen. A long and peaceful reign followed, disturbed&nbsp;only by the struggles of rival political factions. In 1839 a&nbsp;steamship service along the coast was opened, but direct communication with Europe was delayed until 1850, and with the&nbsp;United States until 1865. These services added largely to the&nbsp;prosperity of the port. The first section of the Dom Pedro II.&nbsp;railway was opened in 1858, and the second or mountain section&nbsp;in 1864, which brought the city into closer relations with the&nbsp;interior. In 1874 submarine communication with Europe was&nbsp;opened, which was soon afterwards extended southward to the&nbsp;Platine republics. The first coffee tree planted in Brazil was in&nbsp;a convent garden of Rio de Janeiro. On the 15th of November&nbsp;1889 a military revolt in the city under the leadership of General&nbsp;Deodoro da Fonseca led to the declaration of a republic and&nbsp;the expulsion of the imperial family, which was accomplished&nbsp;without resistance or loss of life. Disorders followed, a naval&nbsp;revolt in 1891 causing the resignation of President Deodoro da&nbsp;Fonseca, and another in 1893-94 causing a blockade of the port&nbsp;for about six months and the loss of many Uves and much&nbsp;property from desultory bombardments. There have been since&nbsp;that time some trifling outbreaks on the part of agitators allied&nbsp;with the extreme republican element, but at no time was the&nbsp;security of the government in danger.</span></p>
