<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">■which pass through their flanges and the sleeper together. At the joints they are fortified by square iron plates laid under the joints,&nbsp;through which fang-bolts are passed. The longitudinals are connected and kept to gauge by transoms or cross-ties at intervals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The minimum weight of ordinary flange rails is about 45 lb per lineal yard. If the weight is less than this for main lines the&nbsp;upper bearing surface is objectionably narrow, and it is scarcely&nbsp;high enough above the sleepers. The maximum weight of flange&nbsp;rails is about 80 lb per lineal yard. Flange rails, like headed rails,&nbsp;are laid on transverse sleepers, to which they are fixed, most commonly by means of screws, spikes, or flange bolts and nuts. In all&nbsp;cases it is preferable to effect the fastening of steel rails without&nbsp;piercing them in the flange, as they are materially weakened by&nbsp;such perforations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">In the United States (also very largely in Germany, Canada, and Mexico) the Yignoles rail is universally used for railways, varying&nbsp;in weight from 67 or 70 lb per yard on a few leading lines to 30 lb&nbsp;on narrow-gauge railways. No railroads with any considerable&nbsp;traffic are now laid down with rails of less weight than 60 lb per&nbsp;yard. The Pennsylvania Railroad, laid to a gauge of 4 feet 9 inches,&nbsp;is constructed of flange rails of two sections, one of 60 lb per yard&nbsp;4 j inches high, the other of 67 lb 4J inches high, in lengths of 30&nbsp;feet. The fishes or splices are 2 feet in length, held by four bolts&nbsp;and nuts. The outer splice is formed with a horizontal flange or&nbsp;“tongue,” which overhangs the flange of the rail and is spiked to&nbsp;the sleeper. Allowance for expansion when the rails are laid in&nbsp;winter is provided by laying the rails five-sixteenths of an inch&nbsp;apart, endwise ; in summer a space of only.one-sixteenth of an inch&nbsp;in width is allowed. The cross sleepers are 8 inches wide by 7 deep,&nbsp;and are 8^ feet in length ; they are laid so closely that the maximum&nbsp;distance apart between centres does not exceed 2 feet. There are&nbsp;sixteen sleepers for each length of 30 feet, and the sleepers at the&nbsp;joints are laid with a clearance of over 10 inches between them.&nbsp;The rails are fastened by spikes to the sleepers at the inside and the&nbsp;outside. The width for the double line of way at the formation&nbsp;level is 31 feet 4 inches in cuttings; and on embankments the&nbsp;width of the formation is 24 feet 3 inches, sloping from the centre&nbsp;at the rate of 1 in 20. The ballast is laid to a depth of not less&nbsp;than 12 inches under the sleepers, and is filled in to the level of the&nbsp;upper surface of the sleepers. Where stone ballast is used it is&nbsp;broken uniformly to a gauge of 2£ inches in diameter. For double&nbsp;lines of way large stones are placed in the bottom, at the centre,&nbsp;between the lines to provide for drainage ; but the stones are not&nbsp;placed under the ends of the sleepers ; thus water is drained off&nbsp;rapidly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Metallic Permanent Way</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">.—Metallic permanent way, in which the sleepers are of iron, has been much employed in tropical&nbsp;countries, and is&nbsp;now to some extent adopted in&nbsp;France and in Germany. The oldest&nbsp;and most widely&nbsp;used system of metallic way is that of&nbsp;Mr H, Greaves, who '&nbsp;in 1846 introduced&nbsp;a spherical or bowl&nbsp;sleeper of cast-iron,&nbsp;having the chair&nbsp;for the rail cast on&nbsp;its summit (see fig.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">38). Every second pair of sleepers are&nbsp;connected and held&nbsp;to gauge by transverse tie-bars, which pass through and are bolted&nbsp;to them. The form of the sleeper is strong, it holds well in the&nbsp;ground, the chair is not liable to be detached, the whole bearing&nbsp;surface is directly beneath the road, the ballast is kept dry and&nbsp;elastic, and there is a simple means of packing the sleeper through&nbsp;holes in the top, with a pointed rammer from the surface, so&nbsp;that the sleeper and the rail can be forced upwards without disturbing the general bed of ballast. They may also be lowered&nbsp;by taking out a portion of ballast from the interior. Another&nbsp;system, Mr W. Bridges Adams’s “ suspended girder rail,” is shown&nbsp;in fig. 39. The rail&nbsp;is 7 inches deep,&nbsp;weighing 65 lb per&nbsp;lineal yard, and is&nbsp;suspended by continuous angle-wires, or side wings bolted to it,&nbsp;and bedded in the ballast; and, as the bearing surface on the&nbsp;ballast was approximated to the bearing surface of the rail, a&nbsp;great degree of stability was anticipated. Wrought - iron transverse sleepers were first tried in Belgium in 1862, then in&nbsp;France and in Portugal, and afterwards in Germany. There are&nbsp;various systems, most of which were׳ unsatisfactory, but the&nbsp;Yautherin sleeper, first tried in 1864 on the Lyons railway, has</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">been successful. It is hollow in section, of the form A truncated, supposing the upper part of the letter to be removed, presenting a&nbsp;flat bearing surface, 3.| inches wide, for a flange rail. It is 8 feet&nbsp;in length and 9 inches wide over the flanges forming the base. It&nbsp;is three-eighths of an inch thick at the centre and is only half&nbsp;that thickness in the wings. The rail is fixed to the sleeper with&nbsp;gibs and cotters. It has been reported that the motion over the&nbsp;Vautlierin sleepers is much easier than that over sleepers of oak,&nbsp;and that in consequence the cost of maintenance is comparatively&nbsp;low. It is stated that amongst a number of rails laid for trial&nbsp;under similar conditions, some of them on wooden sleepers and&nbsp;some of them on Yautherin sleepers, the number of defective rails&nbsp;amounted to only 2^ per cent, of those laid on Yautherin sleepers&nbsp;against 13 per cent, of those laid on wood. It was found that if&nbsp;the Vautherin sleepers were not at least 8 feet in length they failed&nbsp;at the ends, and that even for this length it was expedient to&nbsp;strengthen them at the angles. It was also found that large and&nbsp;hard ballast, or broken stoqes or broken slag, aggravated the tendency to give way. Ballast of ashes produced a similar bad effect,&nbsp;and also caused the sleepers to rust. On the contrary, ballast of&nbsp;gravel, of a marly character, adapted itself admirably to the form&nbsp;of the sleeper. The system of fastening the rails to the sleepers by&nbsp;gibs and cotters has been abandoned in favour of clips and liook-bolts. The Hartwich system of iron way need not be described&nbsp;here, having always given bad results. The Hilf system of iron&nbsp;way consists of two parts,—an iron longitudinal sleeper and a flange&nbsp;rail of steel. It is simple, easily laid and maintained, and economical. The sleeper is in section like the letter </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">E, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">bevelled at the&nbsp;angles, having an upper flat surface and three flanges downwards.&nbsp;It is 12 inches wide and about 2£ deep ; and it can be rolled to&nbsp;lengths of 30 feet and only one-third of an inch in thickness, and&nbsp;to a weight of 59 lb per yard. The rail is 432־ inches high, with&nbsp;232־ inches width of table, 340־ width of flange base, and four-tenths of an inch thickness of web. It is rolled in lengths of 30&nbsp;feet and weighs 5H lb per yard. It is fish-jointed and is fixed to&nbsp;the sleeper with two rows of bolts and nuts at intervals of from 30&nbsp;to 40 inches. The gauge is preserved by means of 1-inch tie-rods,&nbsp;screwed at both ends with nuts. One tie-rod is sufficient for each&nbsp;length of rail. The combined rail and sleeper, placed on supports&nbsp;54 inches apart, can carry 18 tons at their middle, without impairing their elastic strength.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Locomotive Power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Locomotives may broadly be reduced to two classes, according to the situation of the working cylinders. In the first class these&nbsp;are within the framing, under the boiler, with the main driving&nbsp;axle cranked at two points to receive the power from the two&nbsp;cylinders ; in the second class they are outside the framing, and&nbsp;connected, not to the axle, which is straight, but to crank-pins&nbsp;fixed between the spokes of the wheels, in connexion with the&nbsp;nave. From these distinguishing features the two types of engines&nbsp;are known respectively as “ inside cylinder locomotives” and “outside cylinder locomotives.” In the latter the general contour of&nbsp;the cylinders is usually visible at the fore-end of the machine.&nbsp;The tenders have six or four wheels, according to the taste of the&nbsp;designer, and they are supplied with powerful brakes, worked by&nbsp;screws, with blocks of wood placed against each wheel. A water-tank forms the upper part of the tender, namely, the two sides&nbsp;and the back, usually in the form of a horse-shoe, holding from&nbsp;1000 to 3000 gallons ; and in the hollow of the shoe the fuel is&nbsp;deposited, of which a full charge may weigh from 30 cwt. to 3^&nbsp;tons. The engine and the tender are sustained on springs placed&nbsp;over the axle-bearings. Again, there is the general classification&nbsp;of locomotives into passenger engines and goods and mineral&nbsp;engines. As the power of the engine is brought into action through&nbsp;the grip of the driving wheels upon the rails, it is necessary, for&nbsp;the exertion of maximum power in goods engines, to make two or&nbsp;more pairs of the wheels of one ·size, and transmit the driving force&nbsp;from the central pair of wheels to the front and back pairs by&nbsp;means of coupling-rods attached to crank-pins at the naves of the&nbsp;wheels. Such engines are called “six-coupled,” and for them the&nbsp;most convenient combination is with inside cylinders. When the&nbsp;cylinders are outside it is usual to couple only the hind pair of&nbsp;wheels to the driving wheels, making a </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> four-coupled ” engine,&nbsp;the leading or front wheels being of smaller diameter than the&nbsp;driving-wheels, and so leaving room for the convenient placement&nbsp;of the cylinders. The six-coupled engine can take the heaviest&nbsp;train on a good straight railway,—that is, one free for the most&nbsp;part from curves ; but four-coupled engines work more economically on lines with frequent curves, and may be made so as to take,&nbsp;in average practice, as great a load as six-coupled engines. Passenger locomotives have usually been constructed with a single&nbsp;pair of driving-wheels, for free running at high speeds; but as&nbsp;traffic became heavier four-coupled-wheel passenger engines came&nbsp;into vogue : and express trains are · now for the most part worked&nbsp;with four-coupled engines. In recent years the forepart of engines&nbsp;has in many cases been placed on a four-wheeled truck connected</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
