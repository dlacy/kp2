<p><label>RHAPSODI</label>
Rhapsodjsts, in antiquity, perſons wlio made a buſineſs of ſinging pieces of Homer’s poems. Cuper informs us, that the Rhapfodi were clothed in red when they ſung the Iliad, and in blue when they ſung tlie Odyffey.. They performed on the theatres, and ſometimes ſtrove for prizes in. conteſts of poetry, ſinging, &amp;c. After the two antagoniſts liad ſiniſhed their parts, the two pieces or papers they were written in were joined together again : whence the name, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> from <hi rend="italic">ofuo,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">canticum :</hi> but there</p><p>ſeem to have been other Rhapſodi of more antiquity than .theſe people, who compoſed heroic poems or ſongs in praiſe oſ heroes and great men, and ſung their own compoſitions ſrom town to town ſor a livelihood ; oſ which profeffion Homer himſelſ is ſaid to have been.
