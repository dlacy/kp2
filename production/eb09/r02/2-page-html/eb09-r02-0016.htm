<p><span class="font0">lower arm bones, the ulna is stronger than the radius, and its olecranon forms a short projection. The carpus consists&nbsp;of nine bones, one at the end of each lower limb, one at&nbsp;the base of each metacarpal, one—the os centrale—between&nbsp;these five and the two at the end of the midlimb bones, and&nbsp;one—the pisiforme—outside these latter two. There are&nbsp;five metacarpals and five digits, the latter composed of phalanges, which for the most part number two for the innermost digit or pollex, three for the next or index, four for the&nbsp;third digit, five for the fourth (generally the longest)&nbsp;digit, and three for the outermost or ulnar digit. In the&nbsp;Chamæleons the five proximal carpals coalesce with the&nbsp;metacarpals, and the phalanges are 2, 3, 4, 4, and 3&nbsp;respectively; the digits, moreover, are very exceptionally&nbsp;disposed, the three inner or radial digits being opposed to&nbsp;the two outer or ulnar ones. The digits may be but four&nbsp;in number, as in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Saurophis, Gymnophthalmus, Tetradactylus,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and others ; or but three, as in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chalcis, Seρs,</span><span class="font0"> and others ; or&nbsp;but two, as in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Heteromeles, Chelomeles,</span><span class="font0"> and others; or, finally,&nbsp;but one, as in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rhodona,</span><span class="font0"> &amp;c., as we have already seen. The&nbsp;limb may be entirely wanting, as in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pygopus, Delma, Lialis,&nbsp;Anguis, Acontias,</span><span class="font0"> and others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ophidiα</span><span class="font0"> the pectoral limb is entirely absent, not even a rudiment of it being found.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hatteria</span><span class="font0"> the limb is Lacertilian in form but has ten carpals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Crocodilia</span><span class="font0"> have the long limb bones well developed. The carpus has two large long ossicles articulated with the&nbsp;radius and ulna respectively, and a pisiforme; and an oblong&nbsp;bone and disk of cartilage lie between the large carpals&nbsp;and the five metacarpals. The third digit is the longest,&nbsp;and the number of phalanges of the digit from within outwards (as before) is 2, 3, 4, 4, 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chelonia</span><span class="font0"> the humerus may be nearly straight, as in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chelone,</span><span class="font0"> or very much curved, as in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Testudo.</span><span class="font0"> The&nbsp;radius and ulna, which, though susceptible of very little&nbsp;motion, are generally distinct, may become anchylosed together towards their distal ends, as in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chelone.</span><span class="font0"> The carpus&nbsp;has generally nine ossicles. The pisiforme may be very&nbsp;large, as in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chelone.</span><span class="font0"> There are always five digits, which&nbsp;—both their metacarpals and phalanges—may be very long,&nbsp;as in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chelone,</span><span class="font0"> or exceedingly short, as in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Testudo.</span><span class="font0"> The&nbsp;number of the phalanges may be but two to each digit, as&nbsp;in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Testudo,</span><span class="font0"> but generally it is 2, 3, 3, 3, 2, from pollex to&nbsp;the ulnar digit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Pelvic Limb.—</span><span class="font0">The skeleton of this limb, like that of the pectoral one, is in its main features normally conditioned as is that of Mammals, save as to the mobility of&nbsp;the tarsus, as will be shortly explained. It may, however,&nbsp;be simplified in two ways like the pectoral limb—namely,&nbsp;by the great similarity and want of differentiation of its&nbsp;numerous parts, as in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ichthyosaurus,</span><span class="font0"> or by excessive reduction in the number of its parts, as in certain Ophidians,&nbsp;and in Saurians such as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pseudopus</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lialis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Its resemblance to the pectoral limb, which, as we have seen, is so exceedingly close in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ichthyosaurus</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Plesiosaurus,</span><span class="font0"> may be, in other conditions, hardly less complete&nbsp;in some Chelonians, such, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font0"> as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chelydra.</span><span class="font0"> When all&nbsp;four limbs are fairly developed, the pelvic ones are in no&nbsp;existing forms so inferior in size to the pelvic ones as in&nbsp;the extinct </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ornithosauria,</span><span class="font0"> or so superior in size to the&nbsp;latter as in some of the extinct </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dinosauria,</span><span class="font0"> as, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e.g</span><span class="font0">., in&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Compsognathus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Amongst existing Reptiles the Lacertilians present us with very varied conditions. Generally there is an elongated femur furnished proximally with a trochanter on its&nbsp;inner side. Of the lower limb bones the tibia is larger&nbsp;than the fibula. A knee-pan bone, or patella, is placed in&nbsp;front of the junction of the upper and lower limb bones.&nbsp;The tarsus consists of a proximal segment made up of&nbsp;two large ossicles more or less firmly and immovably&nbsp;united by fibrous tissue to the tibia and fibula and of a&nbsp;distal segment, which consists of a cuboid bone and which&nbsp;is capable of motion upon the proximal segment, while&nbsp;it is firmly connected with the five metatarsals. Thus&nbsp;the flexion of the foot upon the leg takes place, not as in&nbsp;Mammals between the whole tarsus and the leg-bone, but&nbsp;between the distal and proximal segments of the tarsus&nbsp;itself. The outermost or peroneal metatarsal is more or&nbsp;less bent toward its proximal end. The fourth digit is&nbsp;the longest, and the number of the phalanges of the&nbsp;digits, from within outwards, is 2, 3, 4, 5, 4. In the&nbsp;Chamæleons the distal tarsals coalesce with the metatarsals, and two inner or tibial digits are opposed to the&nbsp;three outer or peroneal ones. The foot may have but four&nbsp;digits, as in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Cαmp&gt;sodactylus, Tekrαdαctylus,</span><span class="font0"> and others ; or&nbsp;but three digits, as in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sep&gt;s, Heteromeles,</span><span class="font0"> and others ; or&nbsp;only two, as in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chelomeles, Rhodona,</span><span class="font0"> and others ; or but a&nbsp;single one, as in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chalcis.</span><span class="font0"> There may be but a very small&nbsp;and slender femur, to which a still smaller tibia unites a&nbsp;rudiment of a tarsal ossicle at its distal end, as in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lialis<sub>i&nbsp;</sub></span><span class="font0">or but a rudiment of a femur and tibia only, as in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pseudo-pus∙,</span><span class="font0"> or the limb may be entirely wanting, as in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Anguis,&nbsp;Acontias, Chirotes, Amphisbæna,</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lepidosternon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Op&gt;hidia</span><span class="font0"> the limb is generally wanting, and there is never any rudiment of the tarsus or digits, but there&nbsp;may be a rudiment of a femur, as in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Stenostoma,</span><span class="font0"> or of a&nbsp;tibia as well as a femur, the tibia ending in a hooked process, as in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Cylindrophis, Ilysiα,</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Boa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hatteria</span><span class="font0"> the limb is as it normally is in Lacertilians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Crocodilia</span><span class="font0"> there is a well-developed femur, and also a tibia and a fibula. The tarsus has two proximal bones&nbsp;(less closely united than in Lizards), whereof that adjoining&nbsp;the fibula has a large calcaneal process. The distal segment of the tarsus consists of two rounded ossicles on the&nbsp;peroneal side and a thin plate of cartilage on the tibial&nbsp;side. There are four long tibial metatarsals supporting&nbsp;digits and a rudimentary fifth one to which no rudiment&nbsp;of a digit is attached. Of the four digits the third is&nbsp;generally the longest, and, like the fourth digit, has four&nbsp;phalanges. The second digit has three, and the innermost, or hallux, but two.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In Chelonians the femur has a strong, rounded articular head, which forms a marked angle with the body of the bone.&nbsp;Sometimes, as in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Emys</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Trionyx,</span><span class="font0"> there are two trochanters separated by a groove. The lower limb bones are&nbsp;always distinct. They are longest in the Land Tortoises,&nbsp;and shortest in the Marine Turtles. There is no patella.&nbsp;The tarsal bones vary by coalescence from eight to six in&nbsp;number. They are exceptionally flattened in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chelone.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">In </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Testudo</span><span class="font0"> the metatarsals are short, but are longer than&nbsp;are the metacarpals, whereas the reverse is the case in&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chelone.</span><span class="font0"> There are always five digits, except in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Testudo,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">where the fifth is only represented by a rudimentary&nbsp;metatarsal. The metatarsals are shortest,in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Tcsiudo</span><span class="font0"> and&nbsp;its allies, though they are not so short as are the digits of&nbsp;the hand. They are longest in the aquatic forms, though&nbsp;they are not so long in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chelone</span><span class="font0"> as are the digits of its&nbsp;hand. The number of phalanges, counting from within&nbsp;outwards, may be 2, 2, 2, 2, as in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Testτιdo,</span><span class="font0"> or 2, 3 3 3,&nbsp;2, as in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Trwnyx,</span><span class="font0"> or 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, as in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chelone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Myology.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The muscles of four-footed Reptiles other than the Chelonians are arranged in a general way on the same&nbsp;fundamental plan as in the Mammals, though the determination of the true homology of many of them is more or&nbsp;less difficult if not impossible now to determine. The&nbsp;muscular masses are thus arranged in a similar longitudinal&nbsp;manner on the dorsum of the trunk, and expand into large</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
