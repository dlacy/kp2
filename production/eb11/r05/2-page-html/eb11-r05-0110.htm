<p><span class="font0">Reform ministry was formed, in November 1830, Lord John Russell accepted the office of paymaster-general without a&nbsp;scat in the cabinet. This exclusion was the more remarkable&nbsp;in that he was chosen (1st of March 1831) to explain the provisions of the Reform Bill, to which the cabinet had given its&nbsp;formal sanction. The Whig ministry was soon defeated, but&nbsp;an appeal to the country increased the number of their adherents, and Lord John Russell was returned by the freeholders&nbsp;of Devon. After many a period of doubt and defeat, “ the bill,&nbsp;the whole bill, and nothing but the bill ” passed into law (7 th&nbsp;of June 1832), and Lord John stood forth in the mind of the&nbsp;people as its champion. After the passing of the Reform Bill&nbsp;he sat for the S. division of Devon, and continued to retain&nbsp;the place of paymaster-general in the ministries of Lord Grey&nbsp;and Lord Melbourne. The former of these cabinets was broken&nbsp;up hy the withdrawal of Mr Stanley, afterwards Lord Derhy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Lord John Russell had visited Ireland in the autumn of 1833 and had come back with a keen conviction of the necessity&nbsp;for readjusting the revenues of the Irish church. To these&nbsp;views he gave expression in a debate on the Irish Tithe Bill&nbsp;(May 1834), whereupon Stanley, with the remark that “ Johnny&nbsp;has upset the coach,” resigned his place. The latter was&nbsp;abruptly, if not rudely, dismissed by William IV. when the&nbsp;death of Lord Spencer promoted the leader of the House of&nbsp;Commons, Lord Althorp, to the peerage, and Lord John Russell&nbsp;was proposed as the spokesman of the ministry in the Commons&nbsp;(Nov. 1834). At the general election which ensued the Tories&nbsp;received a considerable accession of strength, but not sufficient&nbsp;to ensure their continuance in office, and the adoption by the&nbsp;House of Commons of the proposition, that the surplus funds&nbsp;of the Irish church should be applied to general education,&nbsp;necessitated the resignation of Sir Robert Peel’s ministry&nbsp;(April 1835). In Lord Melbourne’s new administration Lord&nbsp;John Russell became home secretary and leader of the House&nbsp;of Commons, but on his seeking a renewal of confidence from&nbsp;the electors of South Devon, he was defeated and driven to&nbsp;Stroud. The Whig ministry succeeded in passing a Municipal&nbsp;Reform Bill (7th of Sept. 1835), and a settlement of the tithe&nbsp;question in England and Ireland (1836). In May 1839, on an&nbsp;adverse motion concerning the administration of Jamaica,&nbsp;the ministry was left with a majority of five only, and promptly&nbsp;resigned. Sir Robert Peel’s attempt to form a ministry was,&nbsp;however, frustrated by the refusal of the queen to dismiss&nbsp;the ladies of the bedchamber, and the Whigs resumed their&nbsp;places with Lord John Russell as secretary of state for the&nbsp;colonies. Their prospects brightened when Sir John Yarde&nbsp;Buller’s motion of “no confidence ” at the opening of the&nbsp;session of 1840 was defeated by twenty-one, but a similar&nbsp;vote was some months later carried by a majority of one,&nbsp;whereupon the Whig leader announced a dissolution of parliament (June 1841). At the polling-booth his friends sustained&nbsp;a crushing defeat; the return of Lord John Russell for the&nbsp;City of London was almost their solitary triumph.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On Sir Robert Peel’s resignation (1846) the task of forming an administration was entrusted to Lord John Russell, and he&nbsp;remained at the head of affairs from July 1846 to Feb. 1852,&nbsp;but his tenure of office was not marked by any great legislative&nbsp;enactments. His celebrated Durham letter (4th of Nov. 1850) on&nbsp;the threatened assumption of ecclesiastical titles by the Roman&nbsp;Catholic bishops weakened the attachment of the “ Peelites ”&nbsp;and alienated his Irish supporters. The impotence of their&nbsp;opponents, rather than the strength of their friends, kept the&nbsp;Whig ministry in power, and, although beaten by a majority&nbsp;of nearly two to one on Mr Locke King’s County Franchise&nbsp;Bill in February 1851, it could not divest itself of office. Lord&nbsp;Palmerston’s unauthorized recognition of the French </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">coup&nbsp;d'êtat</span><span class="font0"> was followed by his dismissal from the post of foreign&nbsp;secretary (Dec. 1851), but he had his revenge in the ejectment&nbsp;of his old colleagues in February 1852. During Lord Aberdeen’s&nbsp;administration Lord John Russell led the Lower House, at&nbsp;first as foreign secretary (to the 21st of February 1853), then&nbsp;without portfolio, and lastly as president of the council (June&nbsp;1854). In 1854 he brought in a Reform Bill, but in consequence&nbsp;of the war with Russia the bill was allowed to drop. His&nbsp;popularity was diminished by this failure, and although he&nbsp;resigned in January 1855, on Mr Roebuck’s motion for an&nbsp;inquiry into the conduct of the war in the Crimea, he did not&nbsp;regain his old position in the country. At the Vienna conference&nbsp;(1855) Lord John Russell was England’s representative, and&nbsp;immediately on his return he became secretary of the colonies&nbsp;(May 1855), but the errors in his negotiations at the Austrian&nbsp;capital followed him and forced him to retire in July of the&nbsp;same year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For some years after this he was the “ stormy petrel ” of politics. He was the chief instrument in defeating Lord&nbsp;Palmerston in 1857. He led the attack on the Tory Reform&nbsp;Bill of 1859. , A reconciliation was then effected between the&nbsp;rival Whig leaders, and Lord John Russell consented to become&nbsp;foreign secretary in Lord Palmerston’s ministry (i860) and&nbsp;to accept an earldom (July 1861). During the American War&nbsp;Earl Russell’s sympathies with the North restrained his country&nbsp;from taking sides in the contest, and he warmly sympathized&nbsp;with the efforts for the unification of Italy, but he was not&nbsp;equally successful in preventing the spoliation of Denmark.&nbsp;On Lord Palmerston’s death (October 1865) Earl Russell was&nbsp;once more summoned to form a cabinet, but the defeat of&nbsp;his ministry in the following June on the Reform Bill which&nbsp;they had introduced was followed by his retirement from&nbsp;public life. His leisure hours were spent after this event in&nbsp;the preparation of numberless letters and speeches, and in&nbsp;the composition of his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Recollections and Suggestions</span><span class="font0"> (1875),&nbsp;but everything he wrote was marked by the belief that all&nbsp;philosophy, political or social, was summed up in the Whig&nbsp;creed of fifty years previously. Earl Russell died at Pembroke&nbsp;Lodge, Richmond Park, 28th May 1878.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Earl Russell was twice married—first in 1835, to Adelaide, daughter of Mr Thomas Lister, and widow of Thomas, second&nbsp;Lord Ribblesdale, and secondly, in 1841, to Lady Frances Ann&nbsp;Maria, daughter of Gilbert, second earl of Minto. By the&nbsp;former he had two daughters, by the latter three sons and&nbsp;one daughter. His eldest son, Lord Amberley, who married&nbsp;a daughter of the second Baron Stanley of Alderley, predeceased&nbsp;him on the 9th of January 1876, and their eldest son (b. 1865)&nbsp;succeeded as second Earl Russell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Lord Russell played some part as an author. His tales, tragedies and essays (including </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Nun of Arrouca,</span><span class="font0"> 1822, and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Essays and&nbsp;Sketches by a Gentleman who has left his Lodgings,</span><span class="font0"> 1820) are forgotten, but his historical works, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Life of William Lord Russell&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(1819), </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Memoirs of the Affairs of Europe</span><span class="font0"> (1824-29, 2 vols.), </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Correspondence of John, 4th Duke of Bedford</span><span class="font0"> (1842-46, 3 vols.), </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Memorials&nbsp;and Correspondence of C. J, Fox</span><span class="font0"> (1853-57, 4 vols.) and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Life and&nbsp;Times of</span><span class="font0"> C. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">J. Fox</span><span class="font0"> (1859-66,3 vols.) are among the chief authorities&nbsp;on Whig politics. He also edited the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Memoirs, Journal and Correspondence of Thomas Moore</span><span class="font0"> (1853-56, $ vols.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The chief biography is that by Sir Spencer Walpole (1891, 2 vols.). The volume by Stuart J. Reid (1895, “ Prime Ministers of&nbsp;Queen Victoria” Series) should also be consulted. (W.P. C.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RUSSELL, JOHN SCOTT (1808-1882), British engineer, was born in 1808 near Glasgow, a “ son of the manse,” and was&nbsp;at first destined for the ministry. But this intention on his&nbsp;father’s part was changed in consequence of the boy’s early&nbsp;leanings towards practical science. He attended in succession&nbsp;the universities of St Andrews, Edinburgh and Glasgow,—&nbsp;taking his degree in the last-named at the age of sixteen.&nbsp;After spending a couple of years in workshops, he settled in&nbsp;Edinburgh as a lecturer on science, and soon attracted large&nbsp;classes. In 1832-33 he was engaged to give the natural&nbsp;philosophy course at the university, the chair having become&nbsp;vacant by the death of Sir John Leslie. In the following year he&nbsp;began his remarkable series of observations on waves. Having&nbsp;been consulted as to Ihe possibility of utilizing steam-navigation on the Edinburgh &amp; Glasgow canal, he replied that the&nbsp;question could not be answered without experiments, which&nbsp;he was willing to undertake if a portion of the canal were placed&nbsp;at his disposal. The results of this inquiry are to be found&nbsp;in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Trans, Roy, Soc, Ed,</span><span class="font0"> (vol. xiv.), and in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">British</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
