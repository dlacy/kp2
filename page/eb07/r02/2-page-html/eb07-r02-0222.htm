<p><span class="font0">These can-frames run in brackets </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">dd, d'd',</span><span class="font0"> fixed upon an upright spindle </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ee ;</span><span class="font0"> the bottom bracket </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">dd</span><span class="font0"> is shown in the&nbsp;ground plan as a round plate, and the parts for the pivots&nbsp;of the can-frames to run in are raised upon it partly on&nbsp;each side. The spindle </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ee</span><span class="font0"> is made to revolve by means of&nbsp;a bevel-pinion </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">f</span><span class="font0"> fixed upon it, which pinion gears into a&nbsp;wheel </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">gg</span><span class="font0"> fixed upon the shaft </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">hh.</span><span class="font0"> A belt from the pulley&nbsp;communicates motion to the main shaft </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">hh,</span><span class="font0"> which carries&nbsp;a spur-pinion </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">h,</span><span class="font0"> gearing into a wheel </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">l</span><span class="font0"> fixed on the shaft&nbsp;mz«. Upon this shaft the cone </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">nn</span><span class="font0"> is fixed, which by a belt&nbsp;drives the cone o, running loose upon the main shaft A.&nbsp;Upon the large end of this cone the bevel-wheel </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">p</span><span class="font0"> is either&nbsp;cast or fixed ; and this gears into the pinion </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">q</span><span class="font0"> fixed to the&nbsp;wheel </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">r,</span><span class="font0"> the teeth of which are in its inner edge. This&nbsp;wheel with its pinion turns on the spindle </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ee,</span><span class="font0"> and its teeth&nbsp;gear into spur-pinions ss, fixed on the bottom of the can-frames. From the nippers at the top of the can-frame,&nbsp;each sliver is conducted to a separate hole near the top of&nbsp;the spindle ee ; these holes run upwards in an angular di</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font0">rection from under the bracket </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i,</span><span class="font0"> and meet in one which is carried to the top of the spindle, where is fixed a nipper&nbsp;similar to those of the can-frames. The roller </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">v</span><span class="font0"> is for the&nbsp;purpose of pulling away the βtrand, cord, or rope, as it is&nbsp;formed ; and in this case is made slightly conical, so that&nbsp;by shifting it along its shaft, the speed with which it draws&nbsp;may be varied. The action of the machine will be easily&nbsp;comprehended. By the revolution of the spindle ee the&nbsp;can-frames are carried round a common centre ; and as&nbsp;they turn they receive a motion, each round its own axis,&nbsp;by means of the wheel </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span class="font0"> and the pinions ss. If sliver be&nbsp;put into the cans and carried through their nippers, they&nbsp;will be twisted into yarns between the nippers and the holes&nbsp;in the upright spindle, and by the revolution of the spindle&nbsp;they will be combined so as to form a strand or cord. If&nbsp;in place of slivers strands be used, the result will be a rope.&nbsp;The patentee further describes machinery for the formation&nbsp;of flat ropes, or bands for mines and the like purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Having thus, as far as in our power, given an account of the progressive improvement of the art by the application&nbsp;of machinery, we shall conclude with a description of the&nbsp;most improved forms of machines and apparatus used in&nbsp;laying ropes in the present day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When the yams have been spun upon Mr Lang’s or other spinning machines, or by hand, they are wound from&nbsp;the bobbins in a haul, upon a large octagonal reel about&nbsp;eight or nine feet diameter : the number of yarns in the&nbsp;haul are, of course, regulated by the conveniences of the&nbsp;manufactory. The haul is then passed from this reel through&nbsp;the tar-kettle, and, after undergoing the action of the nippers, is again wound upon a similar reel. From this reel&nbsp;the yams are wound singly upon the reels or bobbins to&nbsp;be used in the laying. The bobbins, with their yams, are&nbsp;then hung in frames, and the further machinery used is&nbsp;an improved form of Mr Chapman’s locomotive apparatus.&nbsp;The whole arrangement of these parts will be better understood from the drawings. In the drawings the connection&nbsp;of the different parts with the moving power is not shown.&nbsp;This may be steam, water, or any other power, and may be&nbsp;placed in any convenient situation, so as best to serve all&nbsp;the purposes of the establishment.</span></p>
