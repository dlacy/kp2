<p><span class="font2">timidly halting speculation was to him intolerable. Though his own system may seem to contain extremely&nbsp;doubtful or even fantastic elements, it is allowed by all&nbsp;that it is in its general outlines a noble massive whole,&nbsp;constructed by a profound, comprehensive, fearless, and&nbsp;logical mind. Another peculiarity of his thought was&nbsp;the realistic nature of his spiritualism : his abstractions&nbsp;are all real existences ; his spiritual entities are real and&nbsp;corporeal ; his truth is actual being. Hence Rothe, unlike Schleiermacher, lays great stress, for instance, on the&nbsp;personality of God, on the reality of the worlds of good&nbsp;and evil spirits, and on the visible second coming of&nbsp;Christ. Hence his religious feeling and theological speculation demanded their realization in a kingdom of God&nbsp;coextensive with man’s nature, terrestrial history, and&nbsp;human society ; and thus his theological system became a&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Theologische Ethik.</span><span class="font2"> It is on the work published under&nbsp;this title that Rothe’s permanent reputation as a theologian and ethical writer will rest. The first edition, in&nbsp;three volumes, was published in 1845-48, and remained&nbsp;twelve years out of print before the second (1867—71, in&nbsp;five volumes) appeared. It was the author’s purpose to&nbsp;rewrite the whole, but he had completed the first two&nbsp;volumes only of the new edition when death overtook him.&nbsp;The remainder was reprinted from the first edition by&nbsp;Prof. Holtzmann, with the addition of some notes and&nbsp;emendations left by the author.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Tliis work begins with a general sketch of the author’s system of speculative theology in its two divisions, theology proper and&nbsp;cosmology, the latter falling into the two subdivisions of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Physik&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(the world of nature) and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ethik</span><span class="font1"> (the world of spirit). It is the last&nbsp;subdivision with which the body of the work is occupied. After&nbsp;an analysis of the religions consciousness, which yields the doctrine&nbsp;of an absolute personal and spiritual God, Rothe proceeds to deduce&nbsp;from his idea of God the process and history of creative development,&nbsp;which is eternally proceeding and bringing forth, as its unending&nbsp;purpose, worlds of spirits, partially self-creative and sharing the&nbsp;absolute personality of the Creator. As a thorough-going evolutionist Rothe regards the natural man as the consummation of the&nbsp;development of physical nature, and obtains spirit as the personal&nbsp;attainment, with divine help, of those beings in whom the further&nbsp;creative process of moral development is carried on. His theory&nbsp;leaves the natural man, without hesitation, to be developed by the&nbsp;natural processes of animal evolution. The attainment of the&nbsp;higher stage of development is the moral and religious vocation of&nbsp;man ; this higher stage is self-determination, the performance of&nbsp;every human function as a voluntary and intelligent agent, or as a&nbsp;person, having as its cosmical effect the subjection of all material to&nbsp;spiritual existences. This personal process of spiritualization is the&nbsp;continuation of the eternal divine work of creation. Thus the moral&nbsp;life and the religious life coincide, and when normal are identical ;&nbsp;both have the same aim and are occupied with the same task,&nbsp;the accomplishment of the spiritualization of the world. “ Piety,&nbsp;that it may become truth and reality, demands morality as its&nbsp;fulfdment, as the only concrete element in which the idea of&nbsp;fellowship with God is realized ; morality, that it may find its&nbsp;perfect unfolding, requires the aid of piety, in the light of which&nbsp;alone it can comprehend its own idea in all its breadth and depth.”&nbsp;Rothe follows Schleiermacher in dividing his ethical system&nbsp;into the three parts of the doctrine of moral ends </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Güterlehre'),</span><span class="font1"> or&nbsp;the products of moral action, the doctrine of virtue ( </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tugendlehre),&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">or of the power producing moral good, and the doctrine of duty&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Pfiiehtenlehre),</span><span class="font1"> or the specific form and manner in which that&nbsp;power obtains its results. The process of human development&nbsp;Rothe regards as necessarily taking an abnormal form and passing&nbsp;through the phase of sin. This abnormal condition necessitates a&nbsp;fresh creative act, that of salvation, which was, however, from the&nbsp;first part of the divine plan of development. As a preparation&nbsp;for this salvation supernatural revelation was required for the&nbsp;purifying and revivification of the religious consciousness, and the&nbsp;Saviour Himself had to appear in human Iiistory as a fresh&nbsp;miraculous creation, born of a woman but not begotten by a man.&nbsp;In conseπuence of His Supeniatural birth the Saviour, or the&nbsp;second Adam, was free from original sin. By His own moral and&nbsp;religious development He made possible a relation of perfect&nbsp;fellowship between God and man, which was the new’ and highest&nbsp;stage of the divine creation of mankind. This stage of development&nbsp;inaugurated by the Saviour is attained by means of His kingdom or&nbsp;the community of salvation, which is both moral and religious, and&nbsp;in the first instance and temporarily only religious—that is, a&nbsp;church. As men reach the full development of their nature, and&nbsp;appropriate the perfection of the Saviour, the separation between&nbsp;the religiousand the moral life will vanish, and the Christian state,&nbsp;as the highest sphere of human life representing all human&nbsp;functions, will displace the church. “In proportion as the Saviour&nbsp;Christianizes the state by means of the church must the progressive completion of the structure of the church prove the cause of&nbsp;its abolition.” The declino of the church is therefore not to be&nbsp;deplored, but recognized as the consequence of the independence&nbsp;and complctenessof the Christian life. It is the third section of&nbsp;his work—the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pfiichtxnlehre-</span><span class="font1">which is generally most highly valued,&nbsp;and where his full strength as an ethical thinker is displayed,&nbsp;without any mixture of thcosophic speculation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">ROTHERHAM, a market-town and municipal borough in the West Riding of Yorkshire, is situated at the junction of the Rother with the Don navigation, on several&nbsp;railway lines, 5 miles north-east of SheflBeld. The parish&nbsp;church of All Saints, occupying the site of a building&nbsp;dating from Anglo-Saxon times, was erected in the reign&nbsp;of Edward IV., and is a good specimen of Perpendicular.&nbsp;Among the other principal public buildings are the new&nbsp;market-hall, the post office, the court-house, the temper&nbsp;ance hall, St George’s Hall, the council hall, and the corporation offices. There are a large number of educational&nbsp;and literary institutions, including the grammar school&nbsp;founded in 1483, the people’s charity school, the Independent college, the mechanics’ institute, the free library,&nbsp;and the literary and scientific society. There is a large&nbsp;hospital, besides almshouses and various other charities.&nbsp;The town possesses extensive iron, steel, and brass works,&nbsp;potteries, glass works, breweries, saw mills, and rope yards.&nbsp;The population of the municipal borough (area 5995 acres)&nbsp;in 1881 was 34,782.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The town is of Roman origin, and was of some importance in Anglo-Saxon times. In the time of Edward the Confessor it&nbsp;possessed a market and a church. Maiy queen of Scots stayed a&nbsp;night at Rotherham while a prisoner, as did also Charles I. when&nbsp;in the hands of the Scots. During the Civil War it sided with&nbsp;the Parliament. It w<sup>τ</sup>as taken possession of by the Royalists in&nbsp;1643, but after the victory of Marston Moor was yielded up to a&nbsp;detachment of the Parliamentary forces. The townships of Rotherham and Kimberworth were incorporated as a municipal borough&nbsp;in August 1871, the adjacent suburbs being included in 1879.&nbsp;The corporation act as the sanitary authority, and own the waterworks, gasworks, and markets. They have introduced a system&nbsp;of main drainage, and have also provided a public park and a free&nbsp;library.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ROTHESAY, a royal burgh, and the principal town of the county of Bute, Scotland, is situated in the island of&nbsp;Bute, at the head of a well-sheltered and spacious bay in&nbsp;the Firth of Clyde, 40 miles W. of Glasgow and 18 S.W. of&nbsp;Greenock, with which there is frequent communication by&nbsp;steamers. The bay affords good anchorage in any wind,&nbsp;and there are also a good harbour and pier. The town is&nbsp;the headquarters of an extensive fishing district, and is&nbsp;much frequented as a watering place. Besides two&nbsp;hydropathic establishments, it has several hotels and&nbsp;numerous lodging houses. Facing the bay there is an&nbsp;extensive esplanade. In the centre of the town are the&nbsp;ruins of the ancient castle, supposed by some to have been&nbsp;erected in 1098 by Magnus Barefoot, and by others at&nbsp;the same date by the Scots to defend themselves against&nbsp;the Norwegians. The village which grew up round the&nbsp;castle was made a royal burgh by Robert III., who created&nbsp;his eldest son David duke of Rothsay. During the&nbsp;Commonwealth the castle was garrisoned by Cromwell’s&nbsp;troops. It was burned by the followers of Argyll in&nbsp;1685, and remained neglected till the rubbish was cleared&nbsp;away by the marquis of Bute in 1816.
