Mersenne relates, that the Flemings invented an instrument, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">les regales de&nbsp;bois,</span><span class="font0"> consisting of seventeen cylindrical pieces of wood, decreasing gradually in length, so as to produce a succession&nbsp;of tones and semitones in the diatonic series, which had keys,&nbsp;and was played on as a spinnet ; the hint of which, he says,&nbsp;was taken from an instrument, in use among the Turks,&nbsp;consisting of twelve wooden cylinders of different lengths,&nbsp;strung together, which being suspended and struck with a&nbsp;stick having a ball at the end, produced music.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RIMA-SZOMBACH, a large market-town in the circle of Houth, and province of the Hither Theiss, in Hungary.&nbsp;It is situated on the river Rima, over which is a fine bridge.&nbsp;It is a well-built place, having a Catholic, a Lutheran, and&nbsp;a Calvinistic church, and a house of assembly for the meeting of the provincial states. It contains 4050 inhabitants,&nbsp;who are actively employed in making linen goods, in tanning&nbsp;leather, and other trades.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RIMINI, a city in the papal dominions, in the delegation of Forli. It is situated at the mouth of the river Marechia,&nbsp;over which is a bridge said to have been built by Augustus.&nbsp;The city was once on the sea-shore, but the water having&nbsp;receded, the canal to the ancient harbour is now a part of&nbsp;a garden. It is surrounded with walls. It is the seat of&nbsp;a bishop ; and, besides the cathedral, it contains several&nbsp;churches, and many convents, in which are paintings of the&nbsp;highest repute. It likewise contains several fine palaces, a&nbsp;public library, a town-house, and a market-place, adorned&nbsp;with some fine statuary. Among the antiquities are an&nbsp;amphitheatre, and some triumphal arches. There is a Lombard and several charitable institutions. The inhabitants&nbsp;amount to 17,460. They partly live on their incomes, but&nbsp;some are employed in making leather, in the fisheries, and in&nbsp;preparing sulphur. Long. 12. 27. 31. E. Lat. 44. 3. 43. N.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RING, an ornament of gold and silver, of a circular figure, and usually worn on the finger. The antiquity of&nbsp;rings is known from Scripture and profane authors. Judah&nbsp;left his ring or signet with Tamar. When Pharaoh committed the government of all Egypt to Joseph, he took his ring&nbsp;from his finger, and gave it to Joseph. After the victory&nbsp;which the Israelites obtained over the Midianites, they offered to the Lord the rings, the bracelets, and the golden&nbsp;necklaces, and the ear-rings, that they had taken from the&nbsp;enemy. The Israelitish women wore rings, not only on their&nbsp;fingers, but also in their nostrils and their ears. St James&nbsp;distinguishes a man of wealth and dignity by the ring of&nbsp;gold that he wore on his finger. At the return of the prodigal son, his father orders him to be dressed in a new suit&nbsp;of clothes, and to have a ring put upon his finger. The&nbsp;ring was used chiefly to seal with. The patents and orders&nbsp;of princes were sealed with their rings or signets ; and it&nbsp;was this that secured to them their authority and respect-The Episcopal Ring, which makes a part of the pontifical&nbsp;apparatus, and is esteemed a pledge of the spiritual marriage&nbsp;between the bishop and his church, was used at a remote&nbsp;period. The fourth council of Toledo, held in 633, appoints&nbsp;that a bishop condemned by one council, and found afterwards innocent by a second, shall be restored, by giving him&nbsp;the ring, staff, &amp;c. From bishops, the custom of the ring&nbsp;has passed to cardinals, who are to pay a very great sum </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">pro&nbsp;jure annuli cardinalita.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RINGWOOD, a market-town of Hampshire, in the division of the Ncw Forest, ninety miles from London. It is situated on the river Avon, is well built, has a handsome&nbsp;church, and a good market on Wednesday. It has been&nbsp;long celebrated for the excellence of the strong beer which&nbsp;is brewed there. The population amounted in 1801 to&nbsp;3222, in 1811 to 3269, in 1821 to 3471, and in 1831 to&nbsp;3434.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RIO GRANDE, a large river of Western Africa, which falls into the Atlantic a considerable distance to the south&nbsp;of the Gambia. It appears to be now ascertained, that the&nbsp;three great rivers of the western coast, the Senegal, the&nbsp;Gambia, and the Rio Grande, have all their sources very&nbsp;close to each other, in a range of mountains a short distance to the north-west of Teembo, in Foota Jallo. M.&nbsp;Mollien’s account represents the Gambia, called the Ba Diman, and the Rio Grande, called the Comba, as springing&nbsp;from the same basin, amid high mountains. The source of&nbsp;the latter stream is in latitude 10. 37. north, and longitude&nbsp;11. 17. west. The correctness of this traveller’s statements&nbsp;is confirmed by M. Caillé, who crossed his route. M. Mol-lien, in describing the origin of the rivers, says, that on&nbsp;leaving the village called Toulon, he was led to the summit of one of the mountains which bear the appellation of&nbsp;Badet. Below him appeared two thickets, the one concealing the sources of the Rio Grande, and the other those&nbsp;of the Gambia. The valley in which they are situated&nbsp;forms a kind of funnel, having no other outlets than the&nbsp;two defiles by which the rivers issue. On quitting this&nbsp;basin these rivers pursue their course towards opposite&nbsp;points. The current of the Rio Grande is at first slow and&nbsp;turbid, but it soon clears ; and beyond the valley its direction, hitherto north-north-east, changes to the west. After&nbsp;receiving the Tomine or Dongo, it assumes the appellation&nbsp;of Kaboo, a name which also distinguishes the country between the Rio Grande, the Gambia, and the Geba river.&nbsp;The territories bordering on the upper part of its course are&nbsp;inhabited by Foulahs, and the kingdom of Foota Jallo extends along the right bank. Further down, its shores are&nbsp;peopled by the Biafaras<sub>1</sub> Balantes, Papels, and other tribes,&nbsp;and occupied by the kingdoms of Ghinala and Biguba-Near its embouchure it divides into a number of branches,&nbsp;forming alluvial islands, which, with others farther out at&nbsp;sea, compose the Archipelago of the Bissagos. The whole&nbsp;length of its course may be about 500 miles. It falls into&nbsp;the Atlantic fifty leagues to the south of the Gambia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rio Grande do Norte, a province of Brazil, is bounded on the south by Paraiba, on the north and east by the Atlantic Ocean, and on the west by Seara. Situated between the parallels of 4. 10. and 5. 45. of south latitude,&nbsp;the climate is of course very hot. At Cape St Roque, which&nbsp;forms the angle of this province, in longitude 36. 15. west,&nbsp;latitude 5. 7. south, the coast of Brazil terminates towards&nbsp;the north-east ; and the Atlantic Ocean, which has so long&nbsp;been its boundary on the east, begins to wash its northern&nbsp;shores. It presents about one hundred miles of sea-coast. The&nbsp;general features of the province may be laid down as displaying a tolerable fertility to the southward of Natal, the&nbsp;capital, and as presenting a barren aspect to the northward&nbsp;of it, except on the banks, and in the immediate neighbourhood of the Rio Grande, or Potengi, the great river of the&nbsp;province. This stream rises in a ridge in the western limits&nbsp;of Rio Grande, and traverses its whole extent in a direction&nbsp;from south-west to north-east. The bar of the Potengi is&nbsp;narrow, but sufficiently deep for vessels of moderate tonnage. The river is very safe within the bar ; the water&nbsp;being deep and quite tranquil. The province is irrigated&nbsp;by other streams, on whose banks the most fertile land is&nbsp;to be found. The village and valley of Papari, lying to the&nbsp;north of the Rio Grande, are described as presenting a&nbsp;most inviting aspect. The whole of the valley is cultivated,&nbsp;and when every other part of the surrounding country is&nbsp;parched with drought, and the high sandy lands are rendered quite barren, this place retains its freshest verdure.&nbsp;Although at the distance of three or four leagues from&nbsp;the sea, the salt-water lake of Groahyras communicates&nbsp;with it, so that the inhabitants have the fish brought to their&nbsp;own doors. Between three and four leagues farther is the&nbsp;Indian village of St Joze, situated on a dry sandy soil. A</span></p>
