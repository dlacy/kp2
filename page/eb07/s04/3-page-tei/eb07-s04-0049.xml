Insurrection quailed before him, the laws resumed their empire, and prosperity revisited the people. The remaining events of his reign must be briefly summed up. He solicited and obtained the hand of Germaine, niece to Charles of France, in the hope of leaving a male heir to the throne ; but his anticipations were not realized. In several expeditions to Africa, important conquests were made in that country, Algiers, Tunis, and other places submitting to become vassals to the king of Spain. In 1511 he went to Italy to assist the pope against the schismatics under the protection of the king of France and the em peror. But into the interminable affairs of Italy, the critical wars carried on by Ferdinand in that country in defence of his Sicilian and Neapolitan possessions, we cannot enter. This war, however, led to one memorable result, and one not very glorious to Ferdinand. Desirous of carrying hostilities into France, he demanded from Jean d’Albret, king of Navarre, permission to march his troops through that country. The Navarrese refused, but at the same time promised to remain neutral. He broke his engagement, however, and entered into an alliance, offensive and defensive, with France. Determined to accomplish his end by force, and to punish the duplicity of the Navarrese, Ferdinand invaded Navarre, and in a short time obtained possession of the whole kingdom, annexing it to that over which he formerly ruled, and successfully defending it against the invasion of the French. This was the last great event of Ferdinand’s life, and, however fortunate for the country, it was by no means honourable to the king. After a lingering illness, his death took place on the 23d of January 1516. In his last will he declared his daughter Juana heiress to all his dominions in Spain and Italy, and after her his grandson Charles. Cardinal Ximenes Cisneros was at the same time appointed sole regent of Castille till the arrival of his grandson. Ferdinand is justly regarded as the founder of the Spanish monarchy ; and although his character has some dark stains upon it, intolerant bigotry being not the least conspicuous, he was certainly the greatest prince of his age, and one of the ablest and best that ever swayed the sceptre of Spain. We shall now glance at the civil and political condition of Spain under the Moors and under the Christians respectively, from the period of the Mahommedan conquest till the death of Ferdinand.</p><p>Mahommedan Spain originally comprehended nearly nine tenths of the Peninsula. Murcia, which the Arabs call Tadmir, though governed by the Christian Theodomir and his successor Athanagild, was as much depcndent on the Saracens as Andalusia or New Castille. The districts over which the barbarian sway never extended were the mountains of the Asturias, Biscay, Navarre, and an angle of Aragon. Thus not only by far the greatest, but infinitely the most valuable, part of the Peninsula was comprised in the Mahommedan kingdom. Under the viceroys of the caliphs, and the immediate successors of the first Abderahman, that is, during the first three centuries, it was the admiration and terror of Europe. The revenues which the kings of Cordova derived from their ample possessions were doubtless immense, and this enabled them to main tain not only a large army of native troops, but great bodies of foreign auxiliaries. These mercenary soldiers are sup posed by some of the most distinguished Arabian histo rians to have been the principal cause of the downfall of that splendid monarchy. The spirit of nationality was not destroyed ; it was fostered by transplantation from the original soil ; the Egyptians in Beja and Lisbon ; the Persians in Huete ; the Assyrians in Granada ; the Berbers and Slavones in most of the great cities, especially about the court ; the inhabitants of Damascus, Emessa, and of Old Palestine, in Cordova, Seville, Niebla, Medina Sidonia, and Algeziras ; became so many rival factions, all eager in</p><p>the pursuit of power, and all mutually hostile. Their frequent quarrels occasioned great disasters in the state, and allowed the ambitious no less than the desperate a long continued impunity. In this distracted state of the king dom, rebel chiefs contrived to retain and even to extend their governments; while the Christians, ever ready to take advantage of circumstances, drove the Saracens from city to city, and from province to province, till they finally expelled them from the country. After Cordova fell from its proud eminence, the Mahommedan power declined with great rapidity. The rulers of Toledo, Badajos, Beja, Seville, Ecija, Malaga, Granada, Almeria, Lorca, Murcia, Denia, Valencia, Lerida, Saragossa, and Huesca, all openly aspired to independent sovereignty. Many of these petty states were annihilated by the king of Seville ; but his own, with those which still remained, were swept from the Peninsula by Yussef, the first emperor of the Almoravides. This African dynasty was again subverted by the still more ferocious Almohades. In the decline of the latter, the local governors again endeavoured to establish inde pendent kingdoms. The Moorish domination thus be came circumscribed within the mountainous region bounded by the sea, and by a line drawn from Malaga through Archidona, Loxa, Guardia, the Sierra de Cazorla, to the environs of Lorca. This small state was still farther limited by the succeeding sovereigns of Castile, from Alfonso el Sabio downwards, till, as we have seen, it was finally subjugated by Ferdinand the Catholic.</p><p>In all the states of Spain, whether Mahommedan or Christian, the government was absolute, but not despotic. If the Christian, as a protection against arbitrary power, could appeal to the legal code of the country which he inhabited, the Mahommedan could also invoke the provisions of the Koran, for the laws <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the followers of the prophet are founded in their religion. Several of the Mahommedan potentates were the munificent patrons of literature and literary men, the names of some of whom are mentioned with respect at the present day. At the close of the eleventh century, Mahommedan Spain could boast of seventy public libraries, and of colleges, or seminaries of learning, in all the principal cities. Thus learning was much encouraged ; and among these numerous collections of books were many hundred volumes by native writers. So great, in fact, was the literary reputation of the Spa nish Arabs, that when the caliph of Egypt desired his library to be arranged and indexes to be made, he confided the task to two individuals of that nation. These men of learning comprised historians, poets, grammarians, ora tors, rhetoricians, mathematicians, astronomers, philosophers natural and moral, physicians, lawyers, and divines. It was in the physical and experimental sciences that the people most excelled, and that too at a time when many of the sciences were wholly neglected or totally unknown in the rest of Europe. Their knowledge of botany was far famed ; that of chemistry was still more so. Indeed they are to be regarded, if not the founders, at least the regenerators, of that science in Europe. Their skill in medicine was great ; in the mathematics they particularly distinguished themselves ; the improvements which they made in algebra are well known. Optics and astronomy were much cultivated by them ; nor were the useful arts less at tended to, more especially agriculture, including horticulture and planting. The mechanical arts and manufactures were also carried to considerable perfection by the Spanish Arabs. Commerce was deemed no less worthy of encouragement than domestic industry. The fine arts however were less cultivated ; but still all the great cities of Mahommedan Spain, Cordova, Granada, Toledo, Va 1encia, Ubeda, Coimbra, were deeply indebted to the Moorish inhabitants ; a fact sufficiently proved by the remains of their past magnificence, which still exist.</p></body></text></TEI>
