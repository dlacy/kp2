For this purpoſe there is nothing better than to preſerve a proper degree of heat in the parts. This is commonly done by the means of warm fomentations and cataplaſms ; and when theſe are regularly and frequently renewed, nothing, it is probable, could more effectually anſwer the purpoſe. But in the ordinary manner in which they are applicd, by the cataplaſms being renewed only once, or at moſt twice a day, they muſt always, it is imagined, do more harm than good. For ſo ſoon as the degree of heat they were at firſt poſseſſed of is diſſipated, the moiſture kept up by them, with the conſequent evaporation which enſues, muſt always render the part a great deal colder than if it had been merely wrapped in flannel without the uſe of any ſuch application.</p><p>In order to receive all the advantages of ſuch remedies, the part affected ſhould be well fomented with flannels presſed out of any warm emollient decoction, applied as warm as the patient can eaſily bear them, continued at leaſt half an hour at once, and repeated four times a day.</p><p>Immediately aſter the fomentation is over, a large emollient poultice ſhould likewiſe be applied warm, and renewed every ſecond or third hour at fartheſt. Of all the forms recommended for emollient cataplaſms, a common milk and bread poultice, with a proportion of butter or oil, is perhaps the moſt eligible ; as it not only possesses all the advantages of the others, but can at all times be more eaſily obtained.</p><p>Roaſted onions, garlic, and other acrid ſubſtances, are frequently made uſe of as additions to maturating cataplaſms. When there is not a due degree of inflammation in the rumor, and when it appears probable that the ſuppuration would be quickened by having the inflammatory ſymptoms somewhat increased, the addition of ſuch ſubſtances may then be of ſervice ; but when ſtimulants are neceſſary in ſuch caſes, a ſmall proportion of ſtrained galbanum, or of any of the warm gums, diſſolved in the yolk of an egg, and added to the poultices, is a more certain form of applying them. Whenever the inflammation, however, takes place to a proper degree, ſuch ſtimulating ſubſtances never can be neceſſary ; and in many caſes, it is apprehended, they may even do miſchief.</p><p>In ſuch tumors as, from their being posseſſed of little or no inflammation, are commonly ſaid to be of a cold nature, as they are generally indolent, and proceed very ſlowly to ſuppuration, plaſters compoſed of the warm gums are often had recourſe to with conſiderable advantage. In ſuch caſes, they are not only of uſe by the ſtimulus and irritation they occaſion, but by the heat which they tend to preſerve in the part. They become particularly neceſſary when the patient, by being obliged to go abroad, cannot have cataplaſms frequently enough renewed, or ſo conveniently applied ; but when ſome ſuch objection does not occur, the latter, for very obvious reaſons, ſhould always be preferred.</p><p>Dry cupping, as it is termed, that is, cupping without the uſe of the ſcarificator, upon or as near as poſſible to the part affected, is frequently had recourſe to with advantage in promoting the ſuppuration of tumors. It is only, however, in ſuch as theſe laſt mentioned, where there ſeems to be a deficiency of inflammation, that it can ever either be neceſſary or uſeful ; but in all tumors of a real indolent nature, and where there is ſtill ſome probability of a ſuppuration, no remedy is more effectual.</p><p>Theſe different applications, under the reſtrictions taken notice of, being continued for a longer or ſhorter time, according to the ſize of the tumor, its ſituation, and other circumſtances, a thorough ſuppuration may in general at laſt be expected.</p><p>Matter being fully formed in a tumor, is known by a remiſſion of all the ſymptoms taking place ; the throbbing pain, which before was frequent, now goes off, and the patient complains of a more dull, confiant, heavy pain ; the tumor points at ſome particular part, generally near to its middle; where, if the matter is not encyſted, or deep ſeated, a whitiſh yellow appearance is obſerved, inſtead of a deep red that formerly took place ; and fluctuation of a fluid underneath is, upon preſſure, very evidently diſcovered. Sometimes, indeed, when an abſceſs is thickly covered with muſcular and other parts, though, from concurring circumſtances, there can be little doubt of there being even a very conſiderable collection of matter, yet the fluctuation cannot be readily diſtinguiſhed : it does not, however, often happen, that matter is ſo very deeply lodged as not to be diſcovered upon proper examination.</p><p>This, however, is a circumſtance of the greateſt conſequence in practice, and deferves more attention than is commonly given to it. In no part of the ſurgeon’s employment is experience in former ſimilar caſes of greater uſe to him than in the preſent ; and however simple it may appear, yet nothing, it is certain, more readily diſtinguishes a man of obſervation and extenſive practice, than his being able eaſily to detect collections of deep-ſeated matter ; whilſt nothing, on the contrary, ſo materially affects the character of a ſurgeon, as his having, in ſuch caſes, given an inaccurate or unjuſt prognolis ; as the event, in diſorders of that nature, comes generally at laſt to be clearly demonstrated to all concerned.</p><p>Together with the ſeveral local ſymptoms of the preſence of pus already enumerated, may be mentioned the frequent ſhiverings to which patients are liable on its firſt formation; theſe, however, ſeldom occur ſo as to be diſtinctly obſerved, unleſs the collection is conſiderable, or ſeated internally in some of the viſcera.</p><p>After the matter is fully formed, and the abſceſs brought to maturity, the only remedy is to open it, and give vent to the pus it contains. In many caſes, indeed, nature will do the work, and abſcesses, when ſuperficially ſeated, will certainly burſt of themſelves : but where the matter lies deep, we are by no means to wait ſor this ſpontaneous opening; as the pus will acquire an acrimony before it can break throu the integuments, which may prove very prejudicial to health. However, it is a general rule not to open abſcesses. till a thorough ſuppuration has taken place ; for, when laid open long before that period, and while any conſiderable hardneſs remains, they commonly prove more troubleſome, and ſeldom heal ſo kindly.</p><p>In ſome caſes, however, it is neceſſary to deviate from this general rule, and to open them a good deal ſooner ; particularly in all ſuch critical abſcesses as occur in malignant fevers. In like manner, in the plague, we are commonly advised to open ſuch tumors, ſo ſoon as they are at all tolerably advanced, and not to wait till they are fully maturated ; as, from experience in theſe diſorders, it is found to be of more conſequence, for the removal of the original diſeaſe, to have a quick diſcharge of matter produced, than any harm the patient can ever ſuffer from having a ſwelling ſomewhat prematurely laid open.</p><p>In abſcesses, alſo, ſituated on any of the joints, or upon</p></body></text></TEI>
