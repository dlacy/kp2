<p><span class="font0">decks, of which those on the lower battery are thirty-two-’ pounders ; those on the middle eighteen-pounders ; on the upper deck twelve-pounders ; and those on the quarter-deck&nbsp;six-pounders, which usually amount to four or six. Their&nbsp;complement of men is 750, in which there are six lieutenants, four master’s mates, twenty-four midshipmen, and&nbsp;four surgeon’s mates, fourteen quarter-masters and their&nbsp;mates, eight boatswain’s mates and yeomen, six gunner’s&nbsp;mates and yeomen, with twenty-two quarter-gunners, two&nbsp;carpenter’s mates with ten assistants, and one steward and&nbsp;steward’s mate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Ships of the third rate carry from sixty-four to eighty cannon, which are thirty-two, eighteen, and nine-pounders.&nbsp;The eighty-gun ships, however, begin to grow out of repute, and to give way to those of seventy-four, seventy, &amp;c.&nbsp;which have only two whole batteries ; whereas the former&nbsp;have three, with twenty-eight guns planted on each, the&nbsp;cannon of their upper deck being the same as those on the&nbsp;quarter-deck and forecastle of the latter, which are nine-pounders. The complement in a seventy-four is 650, and&nbsp;in a sixty-four 500 men ; these have in peace four lieutenants, but in war five, and, when an admiral is aboard, six.&nbsp;They have also three master’s mates, sixteen midshipmen,&nbsp;three surgeon’s mates, ten quarter-masters and their mates,&nbsp;six boatswain’s mates and yeomen, four gunner’s mates and&nbsp;yeomen, with eighteen quarter-gunners, one carpenter’s mate&nbsp;with eight assistants, and one steward and steward’s mate&nbsp;under the purser.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Ships of the fourth rate mount from sixty to fifty guns, upon two decks and the quarter-deck. The lower tier is&nbsp;composed of twenty-four pounders, the upper tier of twelve-pounders, and the cannon on the quarter deck and forecastle&nbsp;are six-pounders. The complement of a fifty-gun ship is&nbsp;350 men, in which there are three lieutenants, two master’s&nbsp;mates, ten midshipmen, two surgeon’s mates, eight quartermasters and their mates, four boatswain’s mates and yeomen, one gunner’s mate and one yeoman, with twelve quarter-gunners, one carpenter’s mate and six assistants, a steward and steward’s mate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">All vessels of war under the fourth rate are usually comprehended under the general name of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">frigates,</span><span class="font0"> and never appear in the line of battle. They are divided into the fifth&nbsp;and sixth rates ; the former mounting from forty to thirty-two guns, and the latter from twenty-eight to twenty. The&nbsp;largest of the fifth rate have two decks of cannon, the lower&nbsp;battery being of eighteen-pounders, and that of the upper&nbsp;deck of nine-pounders ; but those of thirty-six and thirty-two guns have one complete deck of guns, mounting twelve-pounders, besides the quarter-deck and forecastle, which&nbsp;carry six-pounders. The complement of a ship of forty-four guns is 280 men, and that of a frigate of thirty-six&nbsp;guns 240 men. The first has three and the second two&nbsp;lieutenants ; and both have two master’s mates, six midshipmen, two surgeon’s mates, six quarter-masters and their mates,&nbsp;two boatswain’s mates and one yeoman, one gunner’s mate&nbsp;and one yeoman, with ten or eleven quarter-gunners, and&nbsp;one purser’s steward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Frigates of the sixth rate carry nine-pounders, those of twenty guns having three-pounders on their quarter-deck,&nbsp;with 200 men for their complement ; and those of twenty-four 160 men. The former has two lieutenants, the latter&nbsp;one ; and both have two master’s mates, four midshipmen,&nbsp;one surgeon’s mate, four quarter-masters and their mates,&nbsp;one boatswain’s mate and one yeoman, one gunner’s mate&nbsp;and one yeoman, with six or seven quarter-gunners, and&nbsp;one purser’s steward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The sloops of war carry from eight to eighteen cannon, the largest of which have six-pounders ; and the smallest,&nbsp;that is, those of eight or ten guns, four-pounders. Their&nbsp;officers are generally the same as in the sixth rates, with&nbsp;little variation; and their complements of men vary from 60</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">to 120, in proportion to their force or magnitude. Bomb-vessels are on the same establishment as sloops ; but fireships and hospital-ships are on that of fifth rates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RATEEN, or Ratten, in commerce, a thick woollen stuff, quilled, and woven in a loom with four treddles, like&nbsp;serges and other stuffs that have the whale or quilling.&nbsp;There are some rateens dressed and prepared like cloths ;&nbsp;others left simply in the hair, and others where the hair or&nbsp;knap is frized. Rateens are chiefly manufactured in France,&nbsp;Holland, and Italy, and are mostly used in linings. The&nbsp;frize is a sort of coarse rateen, and the drugget is a rateen&nbsp;half linen half woollen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RATHENAU, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font0"> city of Prussia, in the province of Potsdam, and circle of West Havell. It stands on the river Havell, is surrounded with walls, and has a good marketplace, in which there is a statue of the elector Frederick&nbsp;William, placed to commemorate a victory gained by him&nbsp;near this place over the Swedes in the year 1675. It contains 620 houses, and about 4500 inhabitants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RATIO, in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Arithmetic</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Geometry,</span><span class="font0"> is that relation of homogeneous things which determines the quantity of one&nbsp;from the quantity of another, without the intervention of a&nbsp;third.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The numbers, lines, or quantities, A and B, being proposed, their relation one to another may be considered under one or other of these two heads : 1. How much A exceeds B, or B exceeds A ; which is found by taking A from B, or B from A, and is called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">arithmetical reason</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rαtia.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">2. How many times, or parts of a time, A contains B, or&nbsp;B contains A ; which is called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">geometrical reason</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ratio,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">or, as Euclid defines it, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">mutual habitude,</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">respect,</span><span class="font0"> of&nbsp;two magnitudes of the same kind, according to quantity,&nbsp;that is, llow often the one contains or is contained in the&nbsp;other ; and this is found by dividing A by B, or B by A.&nbsp;But observe, that that quantity which is referred to another&nbsp;quantity is called the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">antecedent e&gt;f the ratio ;</span><span class="font0"> and that to&nbsp;which the other is referred is called the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">consequent of the&nbsp;ratio.</span><span class="font0"> In the ratio of A to B, A is the antecedent, and B&nbsp;the consequent. Therefore any quantity as antecedent, divided by any quantity as a consequent, gives the ratio of&nbsp;that antecedent to the consequent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Thus the ratio of A to B is </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">∙q<sub>r</sub>,</span><span class="font0"> but the ratio of B to A is </span><span class="font1">B</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">B &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">— ; and, in numbers, the ratio of 12 to 4 is — = 3, or tri-A &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⅛</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ple ; but the ratio of 4 to 12 is — = -, or subtriple.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">1 &lt;~ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;«5</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font0">And here observe, that the quantities thus compared must be of the same kind ; that is, such as by multiplication may&nbsp;be made the one to exceed the other, or as these quantities are&nbsp;said to have a ratio between them, which, being multiplied,&nbsp;may be made to exceed one another. Thus a line, how&nbsp;short soever, may be multiplied, that is, produced so as to&nbsp;exceed any given right line ; and consequently these may&nbsp;be compared together, and the ratio expressed. But as a&nbsp;line can never, by any multiplication whatever, be made to&nbsp;have breadth, that is, to be equal to a superficies, however&nbsp;small, so these can never be compared together, and consequently have no ratio or respect to one another, according to quantity ; that is, how often the one contains or is&nbsp;contained in the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RATION, in an army, a portion of ammunition, bread, drink, and forage, distributed to each soldier for his daily&nbsp;subsistence. The horse have rations of hay and oats when&nbsp;they cannot go out to forage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RATIONALE, a solution or account of the principles of some opinion, action, hypothesis, or phenomenon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RATIOS of musical intervals.
