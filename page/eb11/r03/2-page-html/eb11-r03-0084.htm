<p><span class="font0">it is doubtful if the savage does not move quite indifferently to and fro across the supposed frontier-line between magic and&nbsp;religion, interspersing “ bluff ” with blandishment, spell with&nbsp;genuine prayer. Meanwhile the particular meanings ' of the&nbsp;detailed acts composing a complicated piece of ritual soon tend&nbsp;to lose themselves in a general sense of the efficacy of the rite as a&nbsp;whole to bring blessing and avert evil. Nay, unintelligibility&nbsp;is so far from invalidating a sacred practice that it positively&nbsp;supports it by deepening the characteristic atmosphere of&nbsp;mystery. Even the higher religions show a lingering predilection&nbsp;for cabalistic formulas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Changes in Ritual.—</span><span class="font0">Whilst ritual displays an extraordinary stability, its nature is of course not absoIutely rigid; it grows,&nbsp;alters and decays. As regards its growth, there is hardly a&nbsp;known tribe without its elaborate body of magico-religious&nbsp;rites. In the exceptional instances where this feature is&nbsp;relatively absent (the Masai of E. Africa offer a case in point),&nbsp;we may suspect a disturbance of tradition due to migration&nbsp;or some similar cause. Thus there is always a pre-existing&nbsp;pattern in accordance with which such evolution or invention&nbsp;as occurs proceeds. Unconscious evolution is perhaps the&nbsp;more active factor in primitive times; imitation is never exact,&nbsp;and small variations amount in time to considerable changes.&nbsp;On the other hand, there is also deliberate innovation. In&nbsp;Australia councils of the older men are held day by day during&nbsp;the performance of their ceremonies, at which traditions are&nbsp;repeated and procedure determined, the effect being mainly&nbsp;to preserve custom but undoubtedly in part also to alter it.&nbsp;Moreover, the individual religious genius exercises no small&nbsp;influence. A man of a more original turn of mind than his&nbsp;fellows will claim to have had a new ceremony imparted to him&nbsp;in a vision, and such a ceremony will even be adopted by another&nbsp;tribe which has no notion of its meaning (Spencer and Gillen,&nbsp;ib. 272, 278, 281 n.). Meanwhile, since little is dropped whilst&nbsp;so much is being added, the result is an endless complication&nbsp;and elaboration of ritual. Side by side with elaboration goes&nbsp;systematization, more especially when local cuIts come to be&nbsp;merged in a wider unity. Thereupon assimilation is likely to&nbsp;take place to one or another leading type of rite—for instance,&nbsp;sacrifice or prayer. At these higher stages there is more need&nbsp;than.ever for the expert in the shape of the priest, in whose&nbsp;hands ritual procedure becomes more and more of a conscious&nbsp;and studied discipline, the naïve popular elements being steadily&nbsp;eliminated, or rather transformed. Not but what the transference of ritualistic duties to a professional class is often the&nbsp;signal for slack and mechanical performance, with consequent&nbsp;decay of ceremonial. The trouble and worry of having to&nbsp;comply with the endless rules of a too complex system is apt to&nbsp;operate more widely—namely, in the religious society at large—&nbsp;and to produce an endless crop of evasions. Good examples&nbsp;of these on the part alike of priests and people are afforded by&nbsp;Toda religion, the degenerate condition of which is expressly&nbsp;attributed by Dr W. H. R. Rivers to “ the over-development&nbsp;of the ritual aspect of religion ” </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(The Todas,</span><span class="font0"> 454-55). It is&nbsp;interesting to observe that a religion thus atrophied tends to&nbsp;revert to pureIy magical practices, the use of the word of power,&nbsp;and so on (ib. ch. x.). It is to be noted, however, that what&nbsp;are known as ritual substitutions, though they lend themselves&nbsp;to purposes of evasion (as in the well-known case of the Chinese&nbsp;use of paper money at funerals), rest ultimately on a principle&nbsp;that is absolutely fundamental in magico-religious theory—&nbsp;namely, that what suggests a thing because it is like it or a&nbsp;part of it becomes that thing when the mystic power is there&nbsp;to carry the suggestion through.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Classification of Rites.—</span><span class="font0">More than one basis of division has suggested itself. From the sociological point of view&nbsp;perhaps the most important distinction in use is that between&nbsp;public and private rites. Whilst the former essentially belong&nbsp;to religion as existing to further the common weal, the latter&nbsp;have from the earliest times an ambiguous character, and&nbsp;tend to split into those which are licit—“ sacraments,” as they&nbsp;may be termed—and those which are considered anti-social&nbsp;in tendency, and are consequently put beyond the pale of&nbsp;religion and assigned to the “ black art ” of magic. Or the&nbsp;sociologist may prefer to correlate rites with the forms of social&nbsp;organization—the tribe, the phratry, the clan, the family and&nbsp;so on. Another interesting contrast (seeing bow primary a&nbsp;function of religion it is to establish a calendar of sacred seasons)&nbsp;is that between periodic and occasional rites—one that to a&nbsp;certain extent falls into line with the previous dichotomy. A&nbsp;less fruitful method of classing rites is that which arranges&nbsp;them according to their inner meaning. As we have seen,&nbsp;such meaning is usually acquired </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ex post facto,</span><span class="font0"> and typical&nbsp;forms of rite are used for many different purposes; so that&nbsp;attempts to differentiate are likely to beget more equivocations&nbsp;than they clear up. The fact is that comparative religion&nbsp;must be content to regard all its classifications alike as pieces&nbsp;of mere scaffolding serving temporary purposes of construction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Negative Rites.—A</span><span class="font0"> word must be added on a subject dealt with elsewhere (see </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Taboo, Genna),</span><span class="font0"> but strictly germane to the&nbsp;matter in hand. What have the best, if not the sole, right to&nbsp;rank as taboos are ritual interdictions (see M. Mauss in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">L<sup>1</sup> Année&nbsp;SOCiologiq<sup>i</sup>Oe,</span><span class="font0"> ix. 249). Taboo, as understood in Polynesia,&nbsp;the home of the word, is as wide as, and no wider than, religion,&nbsp;representing one side or aspect of the sacred (see </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Religion).&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">The very power that can help can also blast if approached&nbsp;improperly and without due precautions. Taboos are such&nbsp;precautions, abstinences prompted, not by simple dread or&nbsp;dislike, but always by some sort of respect as felt towards&nbsp;that which in other circumstances or in other form has healing&nbsp;virtue. Thus the negative attitude of the observer of taboo&nbsp;involves a positive attitude of reverence from which it becomes&nbsp;in practice scarcely distinguishable. To keep a fast, for instance,&nbsp;is looked upon as a direct act of worship. It must be noted,&nbsp;too, that, whereas taboo as at first conceived belongs to the&nbsp;magico-religious circle of ideas, implying a quasi-physical&nbsp;transference of sacredness from what has it to one not fit to&nbsp;receive it, it is very easily reinterpreted as an obligation imposed&nbsp;by the deity on his worshippers. The law observed by a&nbsp;primitive religious community abounds in negative precepts,&nbsp;and if early religion tends to be a religion of fear it is because&nbsp;the taboo-breaker provides the most palpable objective for&nbsp;human and divine sanctions. In the higher religions, to be&nbsp;pure remains amongst the most laudable of aspirations, and,&nbsp;even though the ceremonial aversion of a former age has become moralized, and a purity of heart set up as the ideal, it&nbsp;is on “ virtues of omission ” that stress is apt to be laid, so&nbsp;that a timorous propriety is too often preferred to a forceful&nbsp;grappling with the problems of life. There are signs, however,&nbsp;that the religious consciousness has at length come to appreciate&nbsp;the fact that the function of routine in religion as elsewhere&nbsp;is to clear the way for action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bibliography.</span><span class="font0">—A comprehensive study of ritual as such from the comparative standpoint remains yet to be written. Some leading&nbsp;ideas on the subject are struck out by E. B.Tylor, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Primitive Culture<sup>9&nbsp;</sup>(190$),</span><span class="font0"> ch. 18; and A. Lang, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Myth, Ritual and Religion<sup>9</sup></span><span class="font0"> (1899);&nbsp;whilst the whole of J. G. Frazer’s vast collection of facts in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The&nbsp;GoldenBough<sup>9</sup></span><span class="font0"> (1900) illustrates ritual, more especially on its magical&nbsp;side; see also W. Robertson Smith, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lectures on the Religion of the&nbsp;Semites</span><span class="font0"> (1889). A very valuable work of restricted range but&nbsp;embodying a method that might fruitfully be applied to the ^hole&nbsp;subject of ritual is H. Hubert and M. Mauss, “ Essai sur la nature et&nbsp;sur la fonction du sacrifice” in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">L’Année sociologique,</span><span class="font0"> ii.; in close&nbsp;connexion with the above should be studied S.
