<p><span class="font0">very thin glass walls of the containing tube. The collected particle gave the spectrum of helium, showing, without doubt,&nbsp;that the α particle must be a helium atom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Since the α particle is an atom of helium, all radioactive matter which expels </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font0"> particles must give rise to helium. In&nbsp;agreement with this, Debiernc and Giesel have shown that&nbsp;actinium as well as radium produces helium. Observations&nbsp;of the production of helium by radium have been made by&nbsp;Ramsay and Soddy, Curie and Dewar, Himstedt and others.&nbsp;The rate of production of helium per gram of radium was first&nbsp;definitely measured by Dewar (43). His preliminary measurements gave a value of 134 cubic mms. of helium per year per&nbsp;gram of radium and its products. Later observations extending over a larger interval give a rate of production about&nbsp;168 cubic mms. per year. As a result of preliminary measurements, Boltwood and Rutherford (44) have found a growth&nbsp;of 163 cubic mms. per year. It is of interest to note that the&nbsp;rate of production of helium by radium is in excellent agreement&nbsp;with the value calculated theoretically. From their work of&nbsp;counting the particles and measuring their charge, Rutherford&nbsp;and Geiger showed that the rate of production of helium should&nbsp;be 158 cubic mms. per year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Properties of the α Rays. </span><span class="font0">—We have seen that the rays are positively charged atoms of helium projected at a high velocity,&nbsp;which are capable of penetrating through thin metal sheets&nbsp;and several centimetres of air. Early observations indicated&nbsp;that the ionization due to a layer of radioactive matter decreased&nbsp;approximately according to an exponential law with the thick-ness of the absorbing matter placed over the active matter.&nbsp;The true nature of the absorption of the α rays was first&nbsp;shown by Bragg and by Bragg and Kleeman (45). The active&nbsp;particles projected from a thin film of active matter of one&nbsp;kind have identical velocities, and are able to ionize the air&nbsp;for a definite distance, termed the “ range ” of the α particle.&nbsp;It was found that the ionization per centimetre of path due&nbsp;to a narrow pencil of α rays increases with the distance from&nbsp;the active matter, at first slowly, then more rapidly, near the&nbsp;end of the range. After passing through a maximum value&nbsp;the ionization falls off rapidly to zero. The range of an α&nbsp;particle in air has a definite value which can be accurately&nbsp;measured. If a uniform screen of matter is placed in the path&nbsp;of the pencil of rays the range is reduced by a definite amount&nbsp;proportional to the thickness of the screen. All the α particles have their velocity reduced by the same amount in their&nbsp;passage through the screen. The ranges in air of the α rays&nbsp;from the various products of the radioelements have been&nbsp;measured. The ranges for the different products vary between&nbsp;2‧8 cms. and 8∙6 cms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Bragg has shown that the range of an α particle in different elements is nearly proportional to the square roots of their&nbsp;atomic weights. Using the photographic method, Rutherford&nbsp;(46) showed that the velocity V of an α particle of range R cms.&nbsp;in air is given by V<sup>2</sup> = K(R + I∙25), where K is a constant. In&nbsp;his experiments he was unable to detect particles which had a&nbsp;velocity lower than 8∙8×10<sup>8</sup> cms. per second. Geiger (47),&nbsp;using the scintillation method, has recently found that α&nbsp;particles of still lower velocity can be detected under suitable&nbsp;conditions by the scintillations produced on a zinc sulphide&nbsp;screen. He has found that the connexion between velocity&nbsp;and range can be closely expressed by V<sup>3</sup>=KR, where K is a&nbsp;constant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On account of the great energy of motion of the α particle, it was at first thought that it pursued a rectilinear path in the&nbsp;gas without appreciable deflection due to its encounters with&nbsp;the molecules. Geiger (48) has, however, shown by the scintillation method that the α particles are scattered to a marked&nbsp;extent in passing through matter. The scattering increases&nbsp;with the atomic weight of the substance traversed, and becomes&nbsp;more marked with decreasing velocity of the α particle. A&nbsp;small fraction of the α particles falling on a thick screen are&nbsp;deflected through more than a right angle, and emerge again on&nbsp;the side of incidence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rutherford and Geiger (49) have devised an electrical method of counting the α particles expelled from radioactive matter.&nbsp;The α particle enters through a small opening into a metal&nbsp;tube containing a gas at a reduced pressure. The ionization&nbsp;produced by the α particle in its passage through the gas is&nbsp;magnified several thousand times by the movement of the&nbsp;ions in a strong electric field. In this way, the entrance of an&nbsp;α particle into the detecting vessel is shown by a sudden and&nbsp;large deflection of the measuring instrument. By this method,&nbsp;they determined that 3∙4 × 10<sup>l0</sup> α particles are ejected per&nbsp;second from one gram of radium itseíf and from each of its&nbsp;α ray products in equilibrium with it. By measuring the&nbsp;charge on a counted number of α particles, it was found that&nbsp;the α particle carries a positive charge of 9∙3 × 10<sup>-l0</sup> electrostatic units. From other evidence, it is known that this must&nbsp;be twice the fundamental unit of charge carried by the hydrogen&nbsp;atom. It follows that this unit charge is 4∙65 × 10<sup>-10</sup> units.&nbsp;This value is in good agreement with numerous recent detcr-minations of this fundamental quantity by other methods.&nbsp;With this data, it is possible to calculate directly the values&nbsp;of some important radioactive data. The calculated and&nbsp;observed values are given below: —</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">The calculated values are in all cases in good agreement with the experimental numbers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is well known from the experiments of Sir William Crookes (50) that the α rays produce visible scintillations when they&nbsp;fall on a screen of phosphorescent zinc sulphide. This is shown&nbsp;in the instrument called the spinthariscope. By means of a&nbsp;suitable microscope, the number of these scintillations on a&nbsp;given area in a given time can be counted. The number so&nbsp;obtained is practically identical with the number of α particles&nbsp;incident on the screen, determined by the electrical method of&nbsp;counting. This shows that each α particle produces a visible&nbsp;flash of light when it falls on a suitable zinc sulphide screen.&nbsp;The scintillations produced by α rays are observed in certain&nbsp;diamonds, and their number has been counted by Regener (51)&nbsp;and the charge on each particle has been deduced. The latter&nbsp;was the first to employ the scintillation method for actual&nbsp;counting of α particles. Kinoshita has shown that the number&nbsp;of α particles can also be counted by the photographic method,&nbsp;and that each particle must produce a detectable effect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Absorption of ß Rays. </span><span class="font0">—We have seen that the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">β</span><span class="font0"> particles, which arc emitted from a number of radioactive products, carry&nbsp;a negative charge and have the same small mass as the particles&nbsp;constituting the cathode rays. The velocity of expulsion and&nbsp;penetrating power of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ß</span><span class="font0"> rays varies widely for different&nbsp;products. For example, the rays from radium B are very easily&nbsp;absorbed, while some of the rays from radium C are of a very&nbsp;penetrating type. It has been found that for a single </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ß</span><span class="font0"> ray&nbsp;product, the particles are absorbed according to an exponential&nbsp;law with the thickness of matter traversed, and Hahn has made&nbsp;use of this fact to isolate a number of new products. It has been&nbsp;generally assumed that the exponential law of absorption is a&nbsp;criterion that the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ß</span><span class="font0"> rays are all expelled at the same speed. In&nbsp;addition, it has been supposed that the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">β</span><span class="font0"> particles do not&nbsp;decrease much in velocity in passing through matter. Wilson&nbsp;has recently made experiments upon homogeneous </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ß</span><span class="font0"> rays, and&nbsp;finds that the intensity of the radiation falls off in some cases&nbsp;according to a linear rather than to an exponential law, and that&nbsp;there is undoubted evidence that the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ß</span><span class="font0"> particles decrease in&nbsp;velocity in traversing matter. Experiments upon the absorption&nbsp;of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ß</span><span class="font0"> rays are greatly complicated by the scattering of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ß</span><span class="font0"> rays&nbsp;in their encounters with the molecules. For example, if a pencil&nbsp;of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ß</span><span class="font0"> rays falls on a metal, a large fraction of the rays are scattered</span></p>
