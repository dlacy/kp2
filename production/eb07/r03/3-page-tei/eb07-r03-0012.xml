Several of these, exceeding a valuation of L.400 Scotch, and held of the crown, have been acquired by professional farmers. Among the seats in the county, which are too numerous to be mentioned here, the most splendid is Fleurs, the mansion of the Duke of Roxburghe, beautifully situated at the confluence of the Tweed and Teviot, near Kelso. Abbotsford, the seat of the late Sir Walter Scott, is also situated in this county. It is placed on a bank overhanging the south side of the Tweed, and is about half-way between Melrose and Selkirk. The property attached to it is judiciously laid out with thriving plantations; and in improving his land, Sir Walter gave a stimulus that has had the happiest effects on the agriculture and appearance of this beautiful district.</p><p>Roxburghshire is divided, for the most part, into larger farms, if we except a few sheep-farms in the Highlands, than any other county in Scotland ; many of them, consisting of land partly arable and partly pasture, being from 1000 to 3000 acres, and several of these, in some instances, being in the occupation of one tenant. Farms altogether arable, containing from 500 to 1000 acres, are not uncommon. The capital and knowledge required for conducting concerns so extensive entitle such men to suitable accommodations in their houses and farm-offices, many of which are accordingly laid out and constructed in a superior style. The average rent of arable land varies from 15s. to L.2.10s. an acre, according to the quality of the soil and the distance from market. The rents of sheep-farms are calculated, not by the number of acres, but by the number of sheep that can be supported thereon. The grazing of an ox or cow, in various parts of the county, is from L.l. 10s. to L.7 a year; that of a sheep from 5s. to L.l, one of the Cheviot breed being charged about one half less than one of the Leicester breed. Farms are generally let on leases at fifteen and nineteen years. On some of the Buccleuch estates it is nine years, but the leases are usually renewed at the end of that period. On other estates the leases vary from five to eleven years.</p><p>Most of the farm-servants are married, and live in houses apart, set down together in some convenient quarter of the farm, each having a small garden attached. It is the practice here, as in other parts of the lowlands of Scotland, to pay most of their wages in the produce of the farm, and not in money, every married ploughman, or <hi rend="italic">hind,</hi>  getting a certain quantity of com, a cow kept, and some land allowed for potatoes, and often also for flax ; he is also commonly allowed to keep a pig and a few hens. The value of his income may be calculated to be between L.25 and L.28 a year. Whatever may be the fluctuation of the markets, these labourers are thus always provided with the necessaries of life ; and the sale of the butter made from their cow, with its calf, and the eggs of their poultry, and, if the family be not large, a part of their corn, supplies them with the other articles they need ; whilst they fatten their pigs, and work up the flax for the use of their families. No class of men of their rank are to be compared with these hinds for propriety of conduct and frugality ; and few of the labouring classes any where are so comfortable and contented with their condition.</p><p>The wages of a shepherd are much higher than those of a hind. These, however, fluctuate with the value of stock. Shepherds are allowed in many instances thirty sheep, the right of keeping a cow, with one or two pigs, and have besides a certain quantity of potato-ground. With these advantages, they realize considerable property, so that not a few are able in the course of years to take farms.</p><p>The system of farming is generally what is called the four and five year shift rotation of cropping. The five-year shift is that which is now most generally adopted, and is</p><p>as follows: First year, fallow or turnip; second year, wheat, after plain fallow ; third and fourth years, grass ; fifth year, oats. There may be a variation after turnip in the second year, when barley or oats can be sown instead of the wheat, if the season is bad. Under a six years’ course, the most profitable on rather weak soils, and in a district where there are no large towns to furnish manure, the rotation from pasture is oats, turnips, barley or wheat, clover and rye-grass, partly cut for hay the first year, but chiefly pastured with sheep, and then continued in pasture two years longer. Under this system the crops are almost always good, and the land, instead of being exhausted, is kept in a state of progressive improvement. Though little of the soil be naturally adapted to wheat, yet this grain is now raised to a great extent on all the better descriptions of sandy loam; generally after turnips, which are eaten on the ground by sheep, which, by their treading, give consistency to the soil, as well as leave it greatly enriched by their manure. Only a small part is under beans, and somewhat more under pease ; barley has in many instances been superseded by wheat, so that wheat and oats are the principal crops of grain ; whilst, whatever be the number of acres in corn, nearly half the quantity is allotted to turnips, and the other half to clover and ryegrass. Potatoes occupy but a very small part of every farm ; and flax, where raised at all, is only in small patches for the use of the farm-servants. The turnip crop, however, has for a series of years been attacked with a disease which is popularly known by the name of <hi rend="italic">fingers and toes. </hi>It converts the bulb of the turnip, when one has been allowed to form, into a shapeless and morbid mass, which no animal will eat; and becomes putrid, and disappears altogether on the first approach of frost. It often prevails over extensive fields, whilst others adjoining escape; and it seems to make no difference whether the land be fresh from pasture or has been long in tillage. Various conjectures have been formed as to the cause or causes of this evil; and the general opinion is, that it is owing to the constant repetition, within a given time, of a turnip crop. To abate the evil, lime, and a proper attention to the change of rotation, are necessary.</p><p>The pastoral district of this county is occupied with an excellent breed of sheep called the <hi rend="italic">Cheviot,</hi>  from the general name of the hills on which they feed ; for an account of which breed we must refer to the article Agriculture. On the arable farms, the short-horned cattle and Leicester sheep, neither of them, however, always in a pure state, form the principal stock; and as so large a proportion of even the arable land is always in grass, the number of both is very great. On farms partly arable and partly hill-pasture, the cross between the Cheviot and the Leicester is found to answer very well. Many of the farmers of late have purchased Highland stots or kyloes at the Falkirk trysts, which have been wintered for a year and then sold to advantage. The greatest improvement recently made is sheep or surface drains, which have not only had the effect of drying the meadow and marshy land, and thereby adding to the fineness and thickness of the grass, but also of curing to a great extent the rot and several other disorders which afflicted the sheep. By means of turnips, most of the disposable stock, whether of cattle or sheep, are carried forward till they are ready for the butcher, when the far greater part is sent to the weekly market of Morpeth in Northumberland, for the consumption of Newcastle and other towns in the north of England.</p><p>The progress which agriculture has made in this district has not been much favoured by its situation in regard to markets, coal, and lime. Weekly markets are held at Jedburgh, Hawick, and Kelso, where the corn is sold by sample upon very short credit, what is bought being paid for next market-day. Kelso market is the best attended,</p><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
