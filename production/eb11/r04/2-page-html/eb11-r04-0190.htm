<p><span class="font0">pure air zinc coating of the galvanized sheets is durable&nbsp;for many years, but in large&nbsp;cities and manufacturing&nbsp;towns its life is short unless&nbsp;protected by painting. In&nbsp;such districts it has, often&nbsp;been found that plain ungalvanized sheets well coated&nbsp;with paint will last longer&nbsp;than those galvanized, for&nbsp;the latter are attacked by&nbsp;corrosive influences through&nbsp;minute flaws in the zinc&nbsp;coating developed in the&nbsp;process of corrugation or&nbsp;resulting from some defect&nbsp;in the coating. The stock&nbsp;sizes of corrugated sheets&nbsp;vary from 5 ft. to 10 ft. long,&nbsp;and from 2 ft. to 2 ft. 9 in.&nbsp;wide with corrugations measuring 3 in. to 5 in. from&nbsp;centre to centre. For roofing&nbsp;purposes the sheets are&nbsp;supplied in several thicknesses ranging from No. 16&nbsp;to No. 22 Standard Wire&nbsp;Gauge. No. 16 is for exceptionally strong work, No. 18&nbsp;and No. 20 are used for good-class work, and No. 22 for&nbsp;the roofs of temporary buildings. The sheets when laid&nbsp;should lap about 3 in. at&nbsp;their sidei and from 3 in.&nbsp;to 6 in. at the ends. Riveting is the best method of&nbsp;connecting the sheets, although galvanized bolts,&nbsp;which are not so satisfactory, are frequently employed. The joints should&nbsp;be made along the raised&nbsp;corrugations to lessen the&nbsp;risk of leakage. Holes can&nbsp;be punched during the erection of the roof; their positions should first be determined by placing the sheets&nbsp;in position and marking the</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">necessary point of fixing. Sheets are usually attached to timber framework with galvanized screws, or nails with domed&nbsp;washers placed under their heads. Fixing to a steel framework is effected by means of galvanized hooked bolts clipping&nbsp;the purlins passed through the sheet and held tight by nuts</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
