<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">pseudopodial origin and the nutritive function are equally obvious. The resemblance of such stages to definite&nbsp;Protozoan types is not a little remarkable; thus, while,&nbsp;in fig. 8, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">b</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> is perfectly amoeboid, the resemblance of c to&nbsp;a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Heliozoon</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> or of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">d</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> to a Gregarine is almost equally&nbsp;striking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The ovum is rarely destitute of egg-membranes, but these may be of very various kinds : thus we may have a&nbsp;vitelline membrane proper, formed by the protoplasm of&nbsp;the ovum, or a chorion formed by the cells of the follicle;&nbsp;or secondary membranes may be present (alone or in addition to the primary membrane) like the shell of a Bird’s&nbsp;egg, which is formed by the walls of the oviduct, or the&nbsp;shell of many Trematode ova, which is secreted by a&nbsp;special gland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Any or all of these membranes may be provided with a special aperture, the micropyle, first discovered by Keber,&nbsp;but this is by no means universally present, as he supposed.&nbsp;This may correspond to the point of attachment of the&nbsp;immature ovum, or may arise elsewhere ; in the first case&nbsp;its function is obviously nutritive, though later it may also&nbsp;serve for the entrance of the spermatozoon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The identification of the ovum as a cell, and of its germinal vesicle and spot as nucleus and nucleolus,&nbsp;although a result only established after prolonged controversy, and of capital importance, is sufficiently familiar.&nbsp;The invaluable labours of the older generation of embryologists from Yon Baer to Allen Thomson, and even the&nbsp;still classical monographs of sucli recent workers as&nbsp;Waldeyer or Ludwig (1874), can only be alluded to;&nbsp;this department of the subject is, however, of peculiarly&nbsp;easy access, thanks to the exceptionally excellent state of&nbsp;its bibliography, and to the recent discussions of Balfour,&nbsp;Hensen, and others. Much, however, remains to be ascertained respecting the finer histology of the ovum, and&nbsp;many investigations are at present in active progress, along&nbsp;the lines of that more general inquiry into the minute&nbsp;structure of cells in general which has of recent years&nbsp;been again becoming of paramount interest in morphological research.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The protoplasm of the ovum may, as has been said, acquire a very varying quantity of food yolk,—may&nbsp;become, that is to say, more or less closely packed with&nbsp;highly refracting spherules of modified protoplasm (see&nbsp;egg of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hydra,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> fig. 8, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">b),</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> which may again present various&nbsp;morphological differentiations, as in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ascaris</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> (fig. 11).&nbsp;And, as explained below under segmentation, it is with&nbsp;regard to the presence, amount, and position of the food-yolk that the important varieties of that process are to be&nbsp;understood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The great differentiation both of protoplasm and of yolk in the animal series, as might be expected, appears&nbsp;to exhibit all gradations from the most simple amoeboid&nbsp;state of a more or less granulated or semi-fluid mass to the&nbsp;most problematical complexity. Of this the best known&nbsp;instance is probably that of the egg of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ascaris,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> described&nbsp;by Van Beneden </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(vide infra,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> pp. 416 </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sq.</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">). Not only&nbsp;has a protoplasmic network been frequently described in&nbsp;both holoblastic and meroblastic ova, but a radiate structure as well,—the former evidently corresponding to the&nbsp;stroma first described by Frommann and Heitzmann and&nbsp;subsequently by so many authors in both animal and&nbsp;vegetable cells, while the latter appearance recalls the&nbsp;striated appearance of the ectoplasm of certain amoeboid&nbsp;organisms described by Strasburger. The concentric&nbsp;differentiation of the ovum has also often been described,&nbsp;and is lately well discussed by Flemming, Brass, and&nbsp;others. Thus Pflüger, in the half-ripe ovum of the Cat,&nbsp;describes the central mass as clear, the cortical layer as&nbsp;rich in granules; Yan Beneden in the egg of the Bat</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">enumerates two similar layers surrounded by an almost granular cortical layer; while Flemming himself, in the&nbsp;ovum of the Rabbit, describes a coarsely granular region&nbsp;around the nucleus, a clearer central region finely granular&nbsp;and with a reticulated structure, and a coarsely granular&nbsp;cortical region. \Ve have still, however, to learn how far&nbsp;such differentiations in structure—reticulate, radial, and&nbsp;concentric—are constant for individual or general cases,&nbsp;and how far they may be permanent or merely incidental&nbsp;to certain phases of development.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">In these regards the recent publications of Carnoy and Brass are of special interest—the former on account of its&nbsp;minuteness of micrographic detail, the latter in its attempt&nbsp;at physiological interpretation. The results of the former&nbsp;will be best understood from his own figures (fig. 9).</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Brass, starting from the familiar structure of an amoeba, with its clear and granular ectoplasm, from which the&nbsp;pseudopodia are emitted, its semi-fluid and highly granular&nbsp;endoplasm around the nucleus, and the less granular&nbsp;intermediate zone, assigns to these definite physiological&nbsp;functions,—to the first that of contractility (</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bewegungs</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">-</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">plasma),</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> to the second that of nutrition (</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Emdhrungs</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">-</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">plasma),</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> and to the third that mainly of respiration&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Athmungsplasma, Nahrungsschicht).</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> He holds that some&nbsp;such concentric disposition of the protoplasm is a normal&nbsp;and constant fact of cell-structure, and insists upon it with&nbsp;special reference to the ovum. From his somewhat vague&nbsp;and diffuse development of these views, it must suffice here&nbsp;to note his opinion that the chromatin of the nucleus, as&nbsp;well as the protoplasmic reticulum, and in fact all the&nbsp;former constituents of the cell, are of quite secondary&nbsp;importance to the colourless protoplasm. The former is&nbsp;to him in fact no more than reserve material, while to the&nbsp;latter he assigns all active functions,—thus” substantially&nbsp;reviving the view so long and energetically maintained by&nbsp;Beale. The recent observations of Wielowiejski may also&nbsp;be noted in this connexion, as he not only brings his contribution to the ontogeny of the ovum, but to some extent&nbsp;also distinguishes a regional adaptation of its protoplasmic&nbsp;structure-to its functions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">From the rapid succession of new contributions to the solution of the problem of egg and cell structure might be&nbsp;gathered many other points of interest, morphological and&nbsp;physiological, empirical and speculative. Thus, for instance, Sabatier describes senile degeneration in Ascidian&nbsp;ova, an observation of wide suggestiveness; while, again,&nbsp;on the important problem of the relation of nucleus to&nbsp;protoplasm there are many recent discussions, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> from</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
