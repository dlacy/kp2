<p><label>RECLUSE</label>
among the Papiſts, a perſon ſſiut up in a ſmall cell o£ an hermitage, or monaſtery, and cut eff, not only ſrom all converſation with the world, but even with the houſe. This is a kind of voluntary im-priſonment, from a motive either of devotion or penance.</p><p>The word ia alſo applied to incontinent wives, whom their huſhands procure to be thus kept in ptrpetual impriſonment in ſome religious houſe.</p><p>Recluſes were anciently very numerous, They took an oath never to ſtir out of their retreat : and having entered it, the biſhop ſet bis ſeal upon the door ; and the recluſe was to have every thing ncceffary for the fupport of life conveyed to him through a window» If</p><p>he was a prieſt, he was allowed a fmaπ oratory, with a window, which looked into the church, through which he might make his offerings at the maſs, hear the ſing-i∙ng, and anſwer thoſe who ſpoke to him ; but this win-dow had curtains before it, ſo that he could not be ſeen. He was allowed a little garden, adjoining to his cell, in which he might plant a few herbs, and breathe a little freih air. Ifhe had diſciples, their cells were contigu-ous to his, with only a window of communication, thro <hi rend="sup">,</hi> which they conveyed neceffaries to him, and received his inftructions. If a recluſe fell ſick, his door might be opened for perſons to come in and aſſiſt him, but he himſelf was not to ſtir out.</p>
