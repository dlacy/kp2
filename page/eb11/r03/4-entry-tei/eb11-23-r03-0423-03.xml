                <p><label>ROBINSON, JOHN THOMAS ROMNEY</label> (1792-1882), Irish astronomer and
                    physicist, was born in Dublin on the 23rd of April 1792. He studied at Trinity
                    College, Dublin, and obtained a fellowship in 1814; for some years he was deputy
                    professor of natural philosophy, until in 1821 he obtained the college living of
                    Enniskillen. In 1823 he was appointed astronomer of the Armagh observatory, with
                    which he (from 1824) combined the living of Carrickmacross, but he always
                    resided at the observatory, engaged in researches connected with astronomy and
                    physics, until his death on the 28th of February 1882.</p>
               <p>Robinson published a number of papers in scientific journals, and the Armagh
                    catalogue of stars <hi rend="italic">{Places of 5345 Stars Observed from 1828 to
                        1854 at the Armagh Observatory,</hi> Dublin, 1859), but he is best known as
                    the inventor (1846) of the cup-anemometer for registering the velocity of the
                    wind.</p>
