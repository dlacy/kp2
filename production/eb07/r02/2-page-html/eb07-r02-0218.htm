<p><span class="font0">Although the yarn thus produced was of superior strength to hand-spun yarn, yet, as it was attended with additional&nbsp;cost in the manufacture, the invention was laid aside.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The next part of the invention was in the application of locomotive power to the machinery of the rope-work. Part&nbsp;of this consisted in the application of an endless rope, reaching from end to end of the rope-walk, and moved with&nbsp;considerable speed, to any of the machines, whether stationary like the fore-end wheels, or changing position like the&nbsp;sledges. The application of the endless rope to the sledge&nbsp;was effected by passing a turn round suitable grooved&nbsp;wheels fixed to the sledge, and capable of giving motion to&nbsp;its machinery. By this machinery great advantages were&nbsp;gained, as each revolution of the strands and the rope, and&nbsp;the proper motion of the sledge, were predetermined and fixed by changes of wheels. For this purpose tables were made&nbsp;out to show what wheels were to be used for each kind of&nbsp;rope. Instead of two hundred men, the number usually&nbsp;employed in closing a twenty-one inch cable, fourteen only&nbsp;were required ; and they, with the help of the steam-engine,&nbsp;which was only of eight horse power, were able to coil&nbsp;away the rope when made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">1799. In the same month Mr Mitchell obtained a patent&nbsp;for a “ method of manufacturing cables, hawsers, or shroud-laid ropes, and other cordage, on scientific principles.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">These principles consisted in combining by twisting the integral yarns of a strand, in numbers of two, three, or more,&nbsp;previous to their being formed into the strand, and thereby lessening the strain on the external yarns when ultimately formed into a rope. The strain on the external&nbsp;yarns would doubtless be by this method lessened, but the&nbsp;number of yarns exposed to external injury would, at the&nbsp;same time, be increased. The ropes formed on this principle were by the patentee termed selvagee cordage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">1799. August 20th, Mr Huddart look out a patent for an improvement on his apparatus of 1793. In this the registering apparatus, instead of being moved up the walk,&nbsp;was, like Mr Chapman’s press-blocks, fixed to the tackle-board, and the machinery for twisting thc strands was stationary, and also contained apparatus for winding the strands&nbsp;upon reels as they were formed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">1799. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same month Mr Grimshaw obtained a patent&nbsp;for improvements in rope-machinery, which consisted, first,&nbsp;in dressing the hemp preparatory to spinning; secondly,&nbsp;in winding up the yarn ; thirdly, in preparing the yarns for&nbsp;tarring ; and, fourthly, in laying the ropes or cordage. The&nbsp;first step appears to be best entitled to notice. The hemp in&nbsp;this was conducted to rotatory hackles through conical fluted rollers, by which means the hemp was equally mixed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">1800. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;July 1st, Mr Huddart took another patent for&nbsp;further improvements in the manufacture of cordage. “ A&nbsp;considerable expense,” says the patentee, “ is attached to&nbsp;having the tarred yarns wound upon bobbins ; and also&nbsp;the tar, especially when the ropes are laid in cold weather,&nbsp;is not sufficiently incorporated amongst the yarns to render&nbsp;it compact for durability, whether registered or laid in the&nbsp;common way. In order to obviate these inconveniences,&nbsp;I have invented a method of registering the strands of ropes&nbsp;during the operation of tarring the yarns, which may be&nbsp;effected in the following manner. The white yarns must&nbsp;be wound separately on reels or bobbins, and placed upon&nbsp;a frame or otherwise, so tllat the yarns may be delivered&nbsp;from them with as small and equal a tension as possible,&nbsp;and to pass under rollers, or through holes, or between separating rods of wood or metal, to be guided into the tar,&nbsp;when sufficiently heated in the kettle, and thence to the&nbsp;register, separate from each other, to prevent entanglement,&nbsp;until they enter the tube, which must be placed at the end&nbsp;of the tar-kettle opposite to that where the bobbins of white&nbsp;yarns are placed. The registering tube now acts in a&nbsp;double capacity, viz. in forming the strand fair, as in ordinary</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">cases, and in acting as a nipper to squeeze out the superfluous tar. The strands are now twisted as before, and the twisting forces out some more tar, which must be cleared off&nbsp;by making the strand pass through the common adjustable&nbsp;nipper plate.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">1801. July 16th, Mr William Hoard obtained a patent for “ a portable machine for manufacturing ropes and cordage of any length in a short space, particularly adapted for&nbsp;shipping.” This machine consists of separate reels, one&nbsp;containing the full length and number of yarns for a strand,&nbsp;from which reel they are drawn out to such distance as&nbsp;the two reels can conveniently be placed asunder, and are&nbsp;attached to the other, which is then empty, one of the reels&nbsp;being in a sledge or moveable frame. The process then&nbsp;begins by twisting the intermediate length of strand, until&nbsp;the reels have approached to each other the usual proportional space, namely, one fifth. The length of strand thus&nbsp;made is then wound up on the second described reel, and&nbsp;so much is let off from the first reel as to admit of their being&nbsp;at their greatest distance asunder, which proecss is necessarily continued until the whole strand be made, and wound&nbsp;up on the second reel. Lastly, three strands thus made&nbsp;have their ends united to a fourth reel placed opposite to&nbsp;them at its greatest convenient distance. By these four reels,&nbsp;the process of making the rope is carried on similarly to&nbsp;that of making a strand, except in the use of a top to regulate the progress of the twist of the rope in its approach to&nbsp;the three strand reels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1801, Mr Archibald Thompson of Plough Court, Lombard Street, took out a patent for “ certain new or improved machinery, for the purpose of spinning rope yarn and sailcloth yarn, and for laying and making ropes and cordage.”&nbsp;Mr Thompson’s invention includes the whole process of&nbsp;spinning, tarring, and laying the cordage. Preparatory to&nbsp;spinning, he draws out the hemp into a long sliver, by different sets of chain hackles, moving with progressively greater&nbsp;speed ; and in the end the sliver is spun by a spindle with&nbsp;its plyer and bobbin into a thread. The threads remain&nbsp;wound up on their bobbins until wanted to be made into a&nbsp;rope, tarred or untarred. The bobbins are then, according&nbsp;to the number of yams wanted in a strand, placed so as to&nbsp;form two circles of the same diameter, round an open cylinder consisting of three hoops or rings, distant from each&nbsp;other the length of a bobbin, and placed near to one end&nbsp;of a long horizontal axis ; and, if the rope be to be tarred,&nbsp;thc yarns are led through a ring of a few inches diameter,&nbsp;near that end of the described open cylinder which has the&nbsp;spare length of axis projecting from it. The yams are then&nbsp;diverged in different degrees, so as to form, when passed&nbsp;longitudinally through an open cylindrical frame of several&nbsp;feet in length, so many different concentric circles round&nbsp;the axis mentioned, as there are different shells or concentric coats of yarns in the strand ; and from the further extremity of this last-mentioned cylindrical frame, the yarns are&nbsp;concentrated to one focus at the extremity of the axis, which&nbsp;is there concave, and has an opening through which the&nbsp;yarns pass to the machine which is to twist them into a&nbsp;strand, and draw them forward to be coiled up within itself.&nbsp;At the focal point described, there are nippers to express&nbsp;the tar from the yarns, which is put into them in the following manner, viz. the last-mentioned open cylinder, between the ring from which the yarns enter to it, and the&nbsp;perforation of the axis where they concentre and quit it,&nbsp;lies over a tar-kettle, and has a portion of its lower half immersed in the tar, just so far as to imbue either the whole&nbsp;or any portion of the yams with tar, as may be deemed expedient. This cylinder must, of course, turn round with&nbsp;such a convenient degree of speed as not to let the yarns be&nbsp;drawn off the cylinder before it comes in their rotation to&nbsp;pass through the tar. When the full length of strand is&nbsp;made, the twist of which is principally given by the revo-</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
