<p><span class="font0">RUT A, rue : A genus of the monogynia order, belonging to the decandria claſs of plants ; and in the&nbsp;natural method ranking under the 26th order, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Multifi-liqu&lt;r.</span><span class="font0"> The calyx is quinquepartite; the petals concave;&nbsp;the receptacle ſurrounded with 1 o melliferous pores ;&nbsp;the capſule is lobed. In ſome flowers, a fifth part of&nbsp;the number is excluded. There are ſeveral ſpecies ; of&nbsp;which the moſt remarkable is the horten fis, or common&nbsp;broad-leaved garden rue, which has been long cultivated for medicinal uſe. This riſes with a ſhrubby ſtalk&nbsp;to the height of five or ſix feet, ſending out branches&nbsp;on every ſide, garniſhed with decompounded leaves,&nbsp;whoſe ſmall lobes are wedge-ſhaped, of a grey colour,&nbsp;and have a ſtrong odour. The flowers are produced&nbsp;at the end of the branches in bunches almoſt in the&nbsp;form of umbels : they are compoſed of four yellow&nbsp;concave petals which are cut on their edges, and eight&nbsp;yellow ſtamina which are longer than the petals, terminated by roundiſh ſummits. The germen becomes a&nbsp;roundiſh capſule, with four lobes punched full of holes&nbsp;containing rough black ſeeds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rue has a ſtrong ungrateful fmell, and a bitteriſh penetrating taſte : the leaves, when full of vigour, are&nbsp;extremely acid, inſomuch as to inflame and bliſter the&nbsp;ſkin, if much handled. With regard to their medicinal&nbsp;virtues, they are powerfully ſtimulating, attenuating,&nbsp;and detergent ; and hence, in cold phlegmatic habits,&nbsp;they quicken the circulation, diſſolve tenacious </span><span class="font1">juices,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">open obſtructions of the excretory glands, and promote&nbsp;the fluid ſecretions. The writers on the materia mεdi-ca in general have entertained a very high opinion of&nbsp;the virtues of this plant. Boerhaave is full of its&nbsp;praiſes ; particularly of the eſſential oil, aud the diſtil-led water cohobated or re-diſtilſed ſeveral times from&nbsp;freſh parcels of the herb. Alter extravagantly commending other waters prepared in this manner, he adds,&nbsp;with regard to that of rue, that the greateſt commendations he can bellow upon it fall ſhort of its merit :&nbsp;“ What medicine (lays he) can be more efficacious for&nbsp;promoting ſweat and perſpiration, for the cure of the&nbsp;hyſteric paſſion and of epilepſies, and for expelling&nbsp;poiſon ?” Whatever ſervice rue may be of in the two&nbsp;laſt caſes, it undoubtedly has its uſe in the others : the&nbsp;cohobated water, however, is not the moſt efficacious&nbsp;preparation of </span><span class="font1">it. </span><span class="font0">An extract made by rectified ſpirit&nbsp;contains in a ſmall compaſs the whole virtues of the&nbsp;rue; this menſtruum taking up by infufion all the pungency and flavour of the plant, and elevating nothing&nbsp;in diſtillation. With water, its peculiar flavour and&nbsp;warmth ariſe ; the bitterneſs, and a conſiderable ſhare&nbsp;of the pungency, remaining behind.</span></p>

In this ſtory are obſervable the ancient rights of kindred and redemption ; and the manner of buying the inheritance of the deceaſed, with&nbsp;other particulars of great note and antiquity. The ca-nonicalneſs of this book was never diſputed ; but the&nbsp;learned are not agreed about the epocha of the hiſtory&nbsp;it relates. Ruth the Moabiteſs is found in the genealogy of our Saviour.

<p><span class="font0">RUTHERGLEN, or by contraction Ruglen, the head borough of the netherward of Lanarkſhire in&nbsp;Scotland, is ſituated in N. Lat. 55<sup>0</sup> yι', and W. Long.&nbsp;4<sup>c</sup> 13' ; about two miles ſouth-eaſt of Glaſgow, and&nbsp;nine weſt of Hamilton. Few towns in Scotland can&nbsp;lay greater claim to antiquity than Rutherglen. Maitland, in his Hiſtory of the Antiquities of Scotland, vol.&nbsp;i. p. 92. tells us, that it was founded by a king Reuther,&nbsp;from whom it derived its name ; and a tradition of the&nbsp;ſame import prevails among the inhabitants. But&nbsp;without laying any ſtreſs on the authority of tradition,&nbsp;which is often falſe and always doubtful, we find,&nbsp;from ſeveral original charters ſtill preſerved, that it was&nbsp;erected into a royal borough by king David I. about&nbsp;the year 1126.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The territory under the juriſdiction of the borough was extenſive, and the inhabitants enjoyed many diſtin-guiſhed privileges, which were however gradually wreſted from them, by political influence, in favour of Glaſgow, which in latter times roſe into conſequence by&nbsp;trade and manufactures. The ancient dimenſions oſ the&nbsp;place are now unknown ; but in the fields and gardens&nbsp;towards the eaſt the foundations of houſes are occaſion-ally diſeovered. It is now of a very reduced ſize, conſiſting but of one principal ſtreet and a few lanes, and&nbsp;containing about 1 63 ι inhabitants.</span></p><h2><a name="caption1"></a><span class="font1">About 150 yar&lt;⅛ to the ſouth of.the main ſtreet</span></h2><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
