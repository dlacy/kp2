<p><span class="font0">is the next, publication of homilies </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Checa infclesului,</span><span class="font0"> “ the Key of understanding,” by the Walachian metropolitan Varlaam, translated from the Russian and printed at Bucharest in 1678. This, the&nbsp;first book printed in Bucharest, begins the long series of editions&nbsp;which have issued from the press of the “.Mitropolie ” in Bucharest.&nbsp;From this press originated also the no less important presses at Buzeu&nbsp;and Ràmnicu Vàlcea, where in the following two centuries almost&nbsp;all the books for the Church service were printed. Two or three&nbsp;more collections may be mentioned here—one called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sicriu de aur,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">“ the Golden treasury,” by Ioan of Vinji (Sasz-Shebesh, 1688),&nbsp;probably from some Hungarian Calvinistic collection of obituary&nbsp;sermons; and the “ Pearls,” </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Màrgàritarc,</span><span class="font0"> an anthology made from&nbsp;the Greek homilies of St Chrysostom, Epiphanius, Anastasius&nbsp;Sinaita, &amp;c., And translated from the Greek by the brothers Radu&nbsp;and §erban Greceanu. The only collection of original sermons is the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Didahii</span><span class="font0"> delivered by the metropolitan Anthim the Iberian (tf.v.), the&nbsp;scholar, artist, translator, printer and great linguist, who was&nbsp;the first to issue books in Arabic and even in Georgian from his&nbsp;printing-presses in Bucharest. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Didahii</span><span class="font0"> were published at&nbsp;Bucharest in 1888.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Rumanian language was not yet introduced into the Church. All the service books were in Slavonic, but during this, period most of&nbsp;them were translated, and some of them printed, although&nbsp;not yet officially used. The burial service seems to have&nbsp;been the first to be translated. Two </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Evhologia</span><span class="font0"> appeared&nbsp;during the second half of the 17th century, one by the bishop Dosi-theiu (Jassy, 1679-80), which remained almost unknown, and the other&nbsp;based upon the Slavonic, by Ioan of Vin$i (Belgrad, 1689). This&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Molitàvnic</span><span class="font0"> (prayer-book) has been the basis of all subsequent&nbsp;editions of the Rumanian Prayer-book. The Liturgy proper was&nbsp;also translated by bishop Dositheiu in 1679, but a translation from&nbsp;the Greek, by Jeremia. Kakavela (Jassy, 1697), was the <sup>one</sup> adopted&nbsp;in the churches. Passing over the numerous editions of the Akathist&nbsp;and Katavasiar, some partly in Rumanian, we may mention the&nbsp;Ceasoslov (Book of. Hours), said to have been printed for the first&nbsp;time in Transylvania in 1696, but certainly printed or reprinted by&nbsp;the metropolitan Anthim (Tirgovishtea, 1715). In 1694 Alexander&nbsp;Dascalul translated, and the bishops Mitrofan of Buseu and Kesarie&nbsp;of Ràmnicu Vàlcea printed (among other church books) the twelve&nbsp;volumes of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Mineu</span><span class="font0"> in Slavonic with Rumanian rubrics, and short</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">lives of the saints, as well as the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Triod</span><span class="font0"> and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Anthologion..</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In addition to the activity of the Reformers in Transylvania, there was also a Roman Catholic propaganda in Rumania, and the&nbsp;Orthodox Church found it necessary to convoke a synod in Jassy for&nbsp;the purpose of formulating anew its own dogmatic standpoint. It&nbsp;was held in 1642 under the presidency of Peter of Mogila, and a&nbsp;formulary of the Orthodox creed was drawn up. An answer to the&nbsp;Lutheran Catechism of Heidelberg (translated into Rumanian and&nbsp;printed at Fogaras in 1648) was also prepared by Bishop Varlaam.&nbsp;R. Greceanu translated the formulary from Greek into Rumanian&nbsp;under the title </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pravoslavnicà màrtunsire</span><span class="font0"> (Bucharest, 1692). . Of a&nbsp;more decided polemical character is the Zttwnwa of Maxim of&nbsp;Peloponnesus, translated from the Greek (Bucharest, 1699).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Of far greater „interest is the literature of maxims, and lives of saints, real or apociyphal, intended to teach by example. Such are&nbsp;the maxims in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Fioaerea darurilor,</span><span class="font0"> translated from the&nbsp;Greek (Sneagov, 1700)., and going back to the Italian </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Fiore&nbsp;de virtù;</span><span class="font0"> the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Invàtafari cre$hne$ti,</span><span class="font0"> “ Christian teachings ”&nbsp;of Filoteos </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(ibid.,</span><span class="font0"> 1700); the short moral guide, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Càrare&nbsp;pre scurii</span><span class="font0"> by Ioan of Vin^i (Belgrad, 1685), translated from, some&nbsp;Hungarian original; the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Màntuirea pàcatosilor,</span><span class="font0"> or “Salvation of&nbsp;sinners,” translated from the Greek by a certain-Cozma in 1682,&nbsp;which is a storehouse of medieval exempla; and above all the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Mirror of. Kings,</span><span class="font0"> ascribed to Prince Neagoe Bassaraba, written&nbsp;originally in Slavonic (or. Greek, if the prince, be really the author),&nbsp;and translated </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(c.</span><span class="font0"> 1650) into Rumanian. This exceeds all the other&nbsp;publications of its class in purity of language and excellence of&nbsp;style. Of the lives of saints, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Prolog,</span><span class="font0"> translated from the Slavonic&nbsp;at the beginning of the 17th century (MS.), and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Vienile Sfinfilor,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">by Dositneiu (2 vols., Jassy, 1682), are the most important. In&nbsp;the latter, which is his greatest work, Dositheiu uses not only&nbsp;Greek texts, but also Slavonic legends and other MS. material; and&nbsp;he includes a goodly number of the apocryphal legends of saints.&nbsp;To this kind of literature belongs also the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lafsaikon, i.e.</span><span class="font0"> the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Historia&nbsp;Lausiaca</span><span class="font0"> of Palladius, differing, however, in some points from the&nbsp;original. The legends of the saints of the Pecherskaya in Kiev were</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">translated by Alexander Dascalul. All these are still in MS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The first law-books were also compiled during this period. The Slavonic </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Nomokanon,.</span><span class="font0"> which rests on Greek legislation and embodies&nbsp;the canonical and civil law, had previously been used in&nbsp;Rumania. In 1640 there appeared in Govora the first&nbsp;canonical law-book, which was at the same time the first Rumanian&nbsp;book printed in Walachia. This </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pravilà</span><span class="font0"> (code) was probably the work&nbsp;of the historian Moxa or Moxalie. In 1632 Evstratie the Logofet&nbsp;(logothete) also translated a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pravità</span><span class="font0"> from the Greek, which remains&nbsp;in MS. In 1646 appeared the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pravilà aleasà,</span><span class="font0"> or “ Selected Code,”&nbsp;compiled, no doubt, by Evstratie and published with the authority&nbsp;of the then reigning Prince Vasile Lupul (Basil the Wolf), hence&nbsp;known as the Code of Vasile. In 1652 there appeared in Bucharest&nbsp;a complete code of laws, translated from the Greek and Slavonic and&nbsp;adapted to local needs under the direction of the prince of Walachia,&nbsp;Matthias Bassaraba. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Indrcptarca legii,</span><span class="font0"> in which </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pravild</span><span class="font0"> of&nbsp;Vasile. was incorporated without acknowledgment, remained the&nbsp;recognized code almost down to 1866. It embraces the canonical&nbsp;as well as the civil law. The chief authors were Uriil Nisturel and&nbsp;Daniil M. Panoneanul.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The earliest historical works are short annals, written originally in Slavonic by monks in the monasteries of Moldavia and Walachia.&nbsp;In 1620 Moxa translated from the Slavonic a short history&nbsp;of the world down to 1498. Two other universal histories&nbsp;were translated from Greek and Slavonic chronographs. One by&nbsp;Pavel Danovic.i contains the history of the world tola in the style&nbsp;of the Byzantine chroniclers; it includes the legend of Troy, the&nbsp;history of Pope Sylvester and the description of the various church&nbsp;councils; ana it concludes at the year 1636. The second is the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hrongraf</span><span class="font0"> of Dorotheus of Monembasia, translated by a certain&nbsp;Ion Buburez&amp;u. Both are still in MS. The Old Slavonic annals&nbsp;were later on translated and new notes were added, each subsequent&nbsp;writer annexing the work of his predecessor, and prefixing his name&nbsp;to the entire compilation. Ancient Rumanian historiography is&nbsp;thus difficult to unravel. In Moldavia, where the influence of&nbsp;Poland had been great and Western writings were accessible, we&nbsp;find the best chroniclers. The writers are often actors in the dramas&nbsp;which they describe, and often also the victims. A history of Moldavia&nbsp;from the earliest times to 1594 is ascribed to Nestor or to his son,&nbsp;Gregorie Ureche, or to Simion Dascalul. It was continued by the&nbsp;Evstratie mentioned above, and probably also by Missail Caiugirul.&nbsp;The most important author whose writings rank as classical is&nbsp;Miron Costin, who either took up the thread where it was left by&nbsp;Simion and Ureche and wrote the history of Moldavia from 1594-1662, or continued the history from where (probably) Evstratie had&nbsp;left it </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(c.</span><span class="font0"> 1630-62). Nicolae Costin (d. 1715), son of Miron, completed&nbsp;the history at both ends. He starts from the creation and endeavours&nbsp;to fill up the lacuna from 1662 to his own time, 1714. It is doubtful,&nbsp;however, whether the portion from 1662-1701 is his work or whether&nbsp;another compiler had filled up that section. Acsintie Uricariul,&nbsp;1715, brings to a close the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">corpus</span><span class="font0"> of Moldavian Chronicles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The same uncertainty holds good also for Walachia. The beginnings are the work of an anonymous author, whose chronicle, continued by a certain Constantin Capitanul, describes the history&nbsp;of Walachia from Radu Negru (i.e. Rudolph the Black), e. 1290-1688. An addition to. this Chronicle from the time of the Roman&nbsp;Conquest to Attila is ascribed to Tudosie Vestemianul, twice&nbsp;metropolitan of Walachia (1669-73, 1677-1703). The Chronicle of&nbsp;Capitanul was further continued by Radu Greceanu to 1707, and&nbsp;finally by Radu Popescu to 1720. Two works remain still to be&nbsp;mentioned—a comprehensive history of both principalities by an&nbsp;anonymous author, probably the Spatar Milescu, who finished his&nbsp;eventful life as ambassador of Russia to China (still in MS.), and&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hronicul Moldo-Vlahilor</span><span class="font0"> of Prince Demetrius Cantemir (see&nbsp;Cantemir), more an apology for the Roman origin of the Rumanians&nbsp;than a true history. Cantemir wrote the original in Latin and&nbsp;translated it into Rumanian in 1710. His style shows an immense&nbsp;superiority to that of .the previous historians. Of poetry there is&nbsp;scarcely a trace during the whole period under review except&nbsp;some rhymed Psalters and a few rhymed dedications to patrons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Second Period: 1710-1830.—</span><span class="font1">The Phanariote period has been described as one of total decay; the political degradation&nbsp;of Rumania was thought to be reflected in its spiritual life.&nbsp;But the facts do not warrant this opinion. The few who had&nbsp;taken the trouble to study Rumanian literature paid not the&nbsp;slightest attention to the vast MS. material accumulated&nbsp;during the years of the Phanariote dominion, and out of sheer&nbsp;ignorance and political bias condemned this period as sterile.&nbsp;Another influence was far more potent than the conduct of&nbsp;the Greek princes, though some of them were real benefactors&nbsp;of the people. In Transylvania one section of the&nbsp;Rumanian population had accepted the spiritual&nbsp;rule of the pope; they became now Greek-Catholic,&nbsp;instead of Greek Orthodox. Rome took good care&nbsp;to educate the priesthood far above the status of the Orthodox&nbsp;priests, and continued an extensive proselytizing activity. So&nbsp;long as the Rumanians were spiritually united with the other&nbsp;Orthodox nations, and so long as they used the Slavonic or&nbsp;Cyrillic alphabet, they would practically be cut off from the&nbsp;Latin West. If, however, they could be induced to discard the&nbsp;old Slavonic alphabet and substitute for it the Latin, and could&nbsp;be brought to recognize their national and ethnical unity with&nbsp;ancient Rome, it was hoped that then they would be more&nbsp;easily induced to enter into the unity of faith. Thus a great&nbsp;change was wrought towards the end of the 18th and in the</span></p>
