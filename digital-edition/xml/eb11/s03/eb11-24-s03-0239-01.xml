He devoted most of his life to researches among the archives of his native city, and in 1656 even obtained a licence to print his <hi rend="italic">Paris ancien et moderne;</hi> but on his death (21st March 1676) the whole work was still in manuscript. A long time afterwards it appeared, thanks to his collaborator, Claude Bernard Rousseau, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Histoire et recherches des antiquités de la ville de Paris</hi> (1724), but remodelled, with the addition of long and dull dissertations which were not by Sauval. The work was not without merits, and it was re-issued in 1733 and 1750. The original manuscript first belonged to Montmerqué, and then passed into the possession of Le Roux de Lincy, who prepared an annotated edition; unfortunately this material, together with the original MS., was lost in the incendiary fires which took place under the Commune (1871). There remain, however, Le Roux de Lincy’s researches, a series of articles on Sauval which appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Bulletin du bibliophile et du bibliothécaire</hi> in 1862, 1866 and 1868. See also the <hi rend="italic">Bibliographie de Paris avant 1789,</hi> by the Abbé Valentin Dufour (τ882).</p></div></body></text></TEI>
