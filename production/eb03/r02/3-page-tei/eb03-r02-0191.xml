As ſhe had been long conversant in this horrid practice, ſhe applied to a woman called <hi rend="italic">Locuſta,</hi>  notorious for aſſiſting on ſuch occaſions. ∙*Γhe poiſon was given to the emperor among muſhrooms, a diſh he was particularly fond of. Shortly after having eaten, he dropped down inſenſible ; but this cauſed no alarm, as it was uſual with him to fit eating till he had ſtupified all his faculties, and was obliged to be carried off to his bed from the table. However, his conſtitution ſeemed to overcome the effects of the potion, when Agrippina reſolved to make ſure of him : wherefore ſhe directed a wretched phyſician, who was her creature, to thruſt a poiſoned feather down his throat, under pretence of making him vomit ; and this diſpatched him.</p><p>The reign of the emperor, feeble and impotent as he was, produced no great calamities in the ſtate, ſince his cruelties were chiefly levelled at thoſe about his perſon. The liſt of the inhabitants of Rome at this time amounted to ſix millions eight hundred and forty-four thouſand ſouls ; a number little inferior to all the people of England at this day. The general character of the times was that of corruption and luxury : but the military ſpirit of Rome, though much relaxed ſrom its former ſeverity, ſtill continued to awe mankind ; and though during this reign, the empire might be juſtly ſaid to be without a head, yet the terror of the Roman name alone kept the nations in obedience.</p><p>Claudius being deſtroyed, Agrippina took every precaution to conceal h13 death from the public, until ſhe had ſettled her meaſures for ſecuring the ſucceſſion. A ſtrong guard was placed at all the avenues of the palace, while ſhe amuſed the people with various reports ; at one time giving out that he was ſtill alive ; at another, that he was recovering. In the meanwhile, ſhe made ſure of the perſon of young Britannicus, under a pretence of affection for him. Like one overcome with the extremity of her grief, ſhe held the child in her arms, calling him the dear image of his ſather, and thus preventing his eſcape. She uſed the ſame precautions with regard to his fiffer3, Octavia and Antonia ; and even ordered an entertainment in the palace, as if to amuſe the emperor. At laſt, when all things were adjuſted, the palace-gates were thrown open, and Nero, accompanied by Burrhus, prefect of the Prætorian guards, iſſued to receive the congratulations of the people and the army. The cohorts then attending, proclaimed him with the loudeſt acclamations, though not without making ſome inquiries after Britannicus. He was carried in a chariot to the reſt of the army ; wherein having made a ſpeech proper to the occaſion, and promiſing them a donation, in the manner of his predeceſſors, he was declared emperor by the army, the ſenate, and the people.</p><p>Nero’s firſl care was, to ſhow all poſſible reſpect to the deceaſed emperor, in order to cover the guilt of his death. His obſequies were performed with a pomp equal to that of Auguſtus : the young emperor pronounced his- funeral oration, and he was -canonized among the gods. The funeral oration, though ſpoken by Nero, was drawn up by Seneca ; and it was remarked, that this was the firſt time a Roman emperor needed the aſſiſtance of another’s eloquence.</p><p>Nero, though but ï 7 years of age, began his reign with the general approbation of mankind. As he owed the empire to Agrippina, ſo in the beginning he ſubmitted to her directions with the moſt implicit obedience. On her part, ſhe ſeemed reſolved on governing with her natural ferocity, and conſidered her private animoſities as the only rule to guide her in public juſtice. Immediately after the death of Claudius, ſhe cauſed Silanus, the pro-conſul of Aſia, to be aſſaſſinated upon very flight ſuſpicions, and without ever acquainting the emperor with her deſign. The next object of her reſentment was Narciſſus, the late emperor’s favourite ; a man equally notorious for the greatneſs of his wealth and the number of his crimes. He was obliged to put an end to his life by Agrippina’s order, though Nero refuſed his conſent.</p><p>This bloody onſet would have been followed by many ſeverities of the ſame nature, had not Seneca and Burrhus, the emperor’s tutor and general, oppoſed. Theſe worthy men, although they owed their riſe to the empreſs, were above being the inſtruments of her cruelty. They, therefore, combined together in an oppoſition ; and gaining the young emperor on their ſide, formed a plan of power, at once the moſt merciful and wiſe. The beginning of this monarch’s reign, while he continued to act by their counſels, has always been conſidered as a model for ſucceeding princes to govern by. The famous emperor Trajan uſed to ſay, “ That for the firſt five years of this prince all other governments came ſhort of his.” In fact, the young monarch knew ſo well how to conceal hrs innate depravity, that his neareſt friends could ſcarce perceive his virtues to be but aſſumed. He appeared juſt, liberal, and humane. Wſhen a warrant for the execution of a criminal was brought to him to be ſigned, he was heard to cry out, with ſeeming concern, “ Would to Heaven that I had never learned to write !” The ſenate, upon a certain occaſion, giving him their applauſe ſor the regularity and juſtice of his adminiſtration ; he replied with lingular modeſty, « That they ſhould defer their thanks till he had deſerved them.” His condeſcenſion and affability were not leſs than his other virtues ; ſo that the Romans began to think, that the clemency of this prince would compenſate for the tyranny of his predeceſſors.</p><p>In the mean time, Agrippina, who was excluded from any ſhare in government, attempted, by every poſſible method, to maintain her declining power. Perceiving that her ſon had fallen in love with a freed-woman, named <hi rend="italic">A8e,</hi>  and dreading the influence of a concubine, ſhe tried every art to prevent his growing paſſion. However, in ſo corrupt a court, it was no difficult matter for the emperor to find other -confidents ready to aſſiſt him in his wiſhes. The gratification of his paſſion, therefore, in this inſtance, only ſerved to increaſe his hatred for the empreſs. Nor was it long before he gave evident marks of his diſobedience, by diſplacing Pallas her chief favourite. It was upon this occaſion that ſhe firſt perceived the total declenſion of her authority ; which threw her into the moſt ungovernable fury. In order to give terror to her rage, ſhe proclaimed that Britannicus, the real heir to the throne, was ſtill living, and in a condition ’ to receive his father’s empire, which was now poſſeſſed by an uſurper. She threatened to go to the camp, and</p><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
