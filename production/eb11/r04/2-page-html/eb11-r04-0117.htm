        <p><span class="font2">fixed resolution no longer of crippling but of destroying the
                Macedonian state. Perseus’s repeated proposals for peace&nbsp;during the war had
                been rejected; and his defeat was followed&nbsp;by the final extinction of the
                kingdom of Philip and Alexander.@@<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>Macedonia, though it ceased to
                exist as a single state, was not,&nbsp;however, definitely constituted a Roman
                    province.@@<sup>2</sup> On the&nbsp;contrary, the mistake was made of
                introducing some of *the&nbsp;main principles of the provincial system—taxation,
                disarmament and the isolation of the separate communities—without&nbsp;the addition
                of the clement most essential for the maintenance&nbsp;of order—that of a resident
                Roman governor. The four petty&nbsp;republics now created were each autonomous, and
                each separated&nbsp;from the rest by the prohibition of </span><span class="font2"
                style="font-style:italic;">commercium</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span

                >but no central controlling authority was substituted for that&nbsp;of the
                Macedonian king. The inevitable result was confusion&nbsp;and disorder, resulting
                finally (149-48) in the attempt&nbsp;of a pretender, Andriscus, who claimed to be a
                son&nbsp;of Perseus, to resuscitate the ancient monarchy.@@<sup>3&nbsp;</sup>On his
                defeat in 148 the senate declared Macedonia&nbsp;a Roman province, and placed a
                Roman magis</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">trate at its head.@@<sup>4</sup></span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">From 189 to the defeat of Perseus in 168 no formal change of
                importance in the status of the Greek states had been made by&nbsp;Rome. The senate,
                though forced year after year to&nbsp;listen to the mutual recriminations and
                complaints of&nbsp;rival communities and factions, contented itself as&nbsp;a rule
                with intervening just enough to remind the Greeks that&nbsp;their freedom was
                limited by its own paramount authority,&nbsp;and to prevent any single state or
                confederacy from raising&nbsp;itself too far above the level of general weakness
                which it was&nbsp;the interest of Rome to maintain. After the victory at
                Pydna,&nbsp;however, the sympathy shown for Perseus, exaggerated as it&nbsp;seems to
                have been by the interested representations of the&nbsp;romanizing factions in the
                various states, was made the pretext for a more emphatic assertion of Roman
                ascendancy.&nbsp;All those suspected of Macedonian leanings were removed
                to’&nbsp;Italy, as hostages for the loyalty of their several
                    communities,@@<sup>5&nbsp;</sup>and the real motive for the step was made clear
                by the exceptionally severe treatment of* the Achacans, whose loyalty was&nbsp;not
                really doubtful, but whose growing power in the Pelopon-ncse and independence of
                language had awakened alarm at&nbsp;Rome. A thousand of their leading men, among
                them the&nbsp;historian Polybius, were carried off to Italy (see </span><span
                class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Polybius).&nbsp;</span><span
                class="font2">In Aetolia the Romans connived at the massacre by their so-called
                friends of five hundred of the opposite party. Acarnania&nbsp;was weakened by the
                loss of Leucas, while Athens was rewarded for her unambitious loyalty by the gift of
                Delos and</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">Samos.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">But this somewhat violent experiment only answered for a time. In 148
                the Achaeans rashly persisted, in spite of warnings, in attempting to compel Sparta
                by force of&nbsp;arms to submit to the league. When threatened by&nbsp;Rome with the
                loss of all that they had gained since&nbsp;Cynoscephalae, they madly rushed into
                    war.@@<sup>6</sup> They&nbsp;were easily defeated, and a “ commission of ten,”
                under the presidency of L. Mummius, was appointed by the senate thoroughly&nbsp;to
                resettle the affairs of Greece.@@<sup>7</sup> Corinth, by orders of the&nbsp;senate,
                was burnt to the ground and its territory confiscated.&nbsp;Thebes and Chalcis were
                destroyed, and the walls of all towns&nbsp;which had shared in the last desperate
                outbreak were razed to&nbsp;the ground. All the existing confederacies were
                dissolved; no&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"
                >commercium</span><span class="font2"> was allowed between one community and
                another.&nbsp;Everywhere an aristocratic type of constitution, according to&nbsp;the
                invariable Roman practice, was established, and the payment of a tribute imposed.
                Into Greece, as into Macedonia&nbsp;in 167, the now familiar features of the
                provincial&nbsp;system were introduced—disarmament, isolation and&nbsp;taxation. The
                Greeks were still nominally free, and no separate&nbsp;province with a governor of
                its own@@<sup>8</sup> was established, but the&nbsp;needed central control was
                provided by assigning to the neighbouring governor of Macedonia a general
                supervision over the&nbsp;affairs of Greece. From the Adriatic to the Aegean, and as
                far&nbsp;north as the river Drilo and Mount Scardus, the whole peninsula was now
                under direct Roman rule.@@<sup>9</sup></span></p><div>
            <p><span class="font2">Beyond the Aegean the Roman protectorate worked no better than in
                    Macedonia and Greece, and the quarrels and disorders&nbsp;which flourished under
                    its shadow were aggravated by&nbsp;its longer duration and by the still more
                    selfish view&nbsp;taken by Rome of her responsibilities.@@<sup>10</sup> At one
                    period&nbsp;indeed, after the battle of Pydna, it seemed as if&nbsp;the more
                    vigorous, if harsh, system then initiated&nbsp;in Macedon and Greece was to be
                    adopted farther&nbsp;east also. The levelling policy pursued towards
                    Macedon&nbsp;and the Achacans was applied with less justice to Rome’s&nbsp;two
                    faithful and favoured allies, Rhodes and Pergamum.&nbsp;The former had rendered
                    themselves obnoxious to Rome&nbsp;by their independent tone and still more by
                    their power&nbsp;and commercial prosperity. On a charge of complicity
                    with&nbsp;Perseus they were threatened with war, and though this danger&nbsp;was
                        averted@@<sup>11</sup> they were forced to exchange their equal
                    alliance&nbsp;with Rome for one which placed them in close dependence
                    upon&nbsp;her, and to resign the lucrative possessions in Lycia and
                    Caria&nbsp;given them in 189. Finally, their commercial prosperity was ruined by
                    the establishment of a free port&nbsp;at Delos,@@<sup>12</sup> and by the
                    short-sighted acquiescence of Rome in the&nbsp;raids of the Cretan pirates. With
                    Eumenes of Pergamum no&nbsp;other fault could be found than that he was strong
                    and successful; but this was enough. His brother Attalus was invited,&nbsp;but
                    in vain, to become his rival. His turbulent neighbours,&nbsp;the Galatae, were
                    encouraged to harass him by raids. Pam-phylia was declared independent, and
                    favours were heaped upon&nbsp;Prusias of Bithynia. These and other annoyances
                    and humiliations had the desired effect. Eumenes and his two
                    successors&nbsp;—his brother and son, Attalus II. and Attalus
                    III.—contrived&nbsp;indeed by studious humility and dexterous flattery to
                    retain&nbsp;their thrones, but Pergamum </span><span class="font2"
                    style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.)</span><span class="font2"> ceased to be a
                    powerful state,&nbsp;and its weakness, added to that of Rhodes, increased the
                    prevalent disorder in Asia Minor. During the same period we have&nbsp;other
                    indications of a temporary activity on the part of Rome.&nbsp;The frontier of
                    the protectorate was pushed forward to the&nbsp;confines of Armenia by alliances
                    with the kings of Pontus and&nbsp;Cappadocia beyond the Halys. In Syria, on the
                    death of&nbsp;Antiochus Epiphanes (164), Rome intervened to place&nbsp;a minor,
                    Antiochus Eupator, on the throne, under&nbsp;Roman guardianship.@@<sup>13</sup>
                    In 168 Egypt formally acknowledged the suzerainty of Rome,@@<sup>14</sup> and in
                    163 the&nbsp;senate, in the exercise of this new authority, restored
                    Ptolemy&nbsp;Philometor to his throne, but at the same time weakened
                    his&nbsp;position by handing over Cyrene and Cyprus to his
                        brother&nbsp;Euegertes.@@<sup>15</sup></span></p>
            <p><span class="font2">But this display of energy was shortlived. From the death of
                    Eumenes in 159 down to 133 Rome, secure in the&nbsp;absence of any formidable
