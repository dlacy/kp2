<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Latin Christianity. The Reformation, inspired by the same energy of resuscitated life as the Renaissance,&nbsp;assisted by the same engines of the printing-press and&nbsp;paper, using the same apparatus of scholarship, criticism,&nbsp;literary skill, being in truth another manifestation of the&nbsp;same world-movement under a diverse form, now posed&nbsp;itself as an irreconcilable antagonist to Renaissance Italy.&nbsp;It would be difficult to draw any comparison between&nbsp;German and Italian humanists to the disparagement of&nbsp;the former. Reuchlin was no less learned than Pico;&nbsp;Melanchthon no less humane than Ficino ; Erasmus no less&nbsp;witty, and far more trenchant, than Petrarch; Ulrich&nbsp;von Hutten no less humorous than Folengo; Paracelsus&nbsp;no less fantastically learned than Cardano. But the&nbsp;cause in which German intellect and will were enlisted&nbsp;was so different that it is difficult not to make a formal&nbsp;separation between that movement which evolved culture&nbsp;in Italy and that which restored religion in Germany,&nbsp;establishing the freedom of intelligence in the one sphere&nbsp;and the freedom of the conscience in the other. The truth&nbsp;is that the Reformation was the Teutonic Renaissance.&nbsp;It was the emancipation of the reason on a line neglected&nbsp;by the Italians, more important indeed in its political&nbsp;consequences, more Aveighty in its bearing on rationalistic&nbsp;developments than the Italian Renaissance, but none the&nbsp;less an outcome of the same ground-influences. We have&nbsp;already in this century reached a point at which, in spite&nbsp;of stubborn Protestant dogmatism and bitter Catholic&nbsp;reaction, we can perceive how the ultimate affranchisement&nbsp;of man will be the work of both.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The German Reformation Avas incapable of propagating <sup>:</sup> itself in Italy, chiefly for the reason that the intellectual&nbsp;forces which it represented and employed had already&nbsp;found specific outlet in that country. It Avas not in the&nbsp;nature of the Italians, sceptical and paganized by the&nbsp;Revival, to be keenly interested about questions which&nbsp;seemed to revive the scholastic disputes of the Middle&nbsp;Ages. It was not in their external conditions, suffering as&nbsp;they were from invasions, enthralled by despots, to use the&nbsp;Reformation as a lever for political revolution. Yet Avhen&nbsp;a tumultuary army of so-called Lutherans sacked Rome in&nbsp;1527 no sober thinker doubted that a new agent had&nbsp;appeared in Europe Avhich Avould alter the destinies of the&nbsp;peninsula. The Renaissance Avas virtually closed, so far&nbsp;as it concerned Italy, Avhen Clement VII. and Charles V.&nbsp;struck their compact at Bologna in 1530. This compact&nbsp;proclaimed the principle of monarchical absolutism, supported by papal authority, itself monarchically absolute,&nbsp;which influenced Europe until the outbreak of the Revolution. A reaction immediately set in both against the&nbsp;Renaissance and the Reformation. The council of Trent,&nbsp;opened in 1545 and closed in 1563, decreed a formal purgation of the church, affirmed the fundamental doctrines&nbsp;of Catholicism, strengthened the papal supremacy, and&nbsp;inaugurated that movement of resistance Avhich is knoAAm&nbsp;as the Counter-Reformation. The complex onward effort&nbsp;of the modern nations, expressing itself in Italy as Renaissance, in Germany as Reformation, had aroused the forces&nbsp;of conservatism. The four main instruments of the reaction Avere the papacy, Avhich had done so much by its sympathy with the revival to promote the humanistic spirit it&nbsp;now dreaded, the strength of Spain, and tAvo Spanish&nbsp;institutions planted on Roman soil—the Inquisition and the&nbsp;Order of Jesus. The principle contended for and established by this reaction was absolutism as opposed to&nbsp;freedom—monarchical absolutism, papal absolutism, the&nbsp;suppression of energies liberated by the Renaissance and&nbsp;Reformation. The partial triumph of this principle Avas&nbsp;secure, inasmuch as the majority of established poAvers in&nbsp;church and state felt threatened bv the revolutionary&nbsp;opinions afloat in Europe. Renaissance and Reformatioi&nbsp;were, moreover, already at strife. Both too Avere spiritua&nbsp;and elastic tendencies toAvard progress, ideals rather thai&nbsp;solid organisms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The part played by Spain in this period of history wa determined in large measure by external circumstance&nbsp;The Spaniards became one nation by the conquest o&nbsp;Granada and the union of the crowns of Castile ant&nbsp;Aragon. The Avar of national aggrandizement, being ii&nbsp;its nature a crusade, inflamed the religious enthusiasm o&nbsp;the people. It Avas folloAved by the expulsion of Jews ant&nbsp;Moors, and by the establishment of the Inquisition on !&nbsp;solid basis, Avith powers formidable to the freedom of al&nbsp;Spaniards from the peasant to the throne. These fact&nbsp;explain the decisive action of the Spanish nation on th&lt;&nbsp;side of Catholic conservatism, and help us to understam&nbsp;Avhy their brilliant achievements in the field of culture&nbsp;during the 16th century Avere speedily folloAved by stag&nbsp;nation. It will be Avell, in dealing Avith the Renaissance&nbsp;in Spain, to touch first upon the arts and literature, an&lt;&nbsp;then to consider those qualities of character in actio!&nbsp;Avhereby the nation most distinguished itself from the res&nbsp;of Europe. Architecture in Spain, emerging from the&nbsp;Gothic stage, developed an Early Renaissance style o&nbsp;beAvildering richness by adopting elements of Arabic an&lt;&nbsp;Moorish decoration. Sculpture exhibited realistic vigou&nbsp;of indubitably native stamp; and the minor plastic craft&nbsp;Avere cultivated Avith success on lines of striking originality&nbsp;Painting greAv from a homely stock, until the work o&nbsp;Velazquez showed that Spanish masters in this branch Aver&nbsp;fully abreast of their Italian compeers and contemporaries&nbsp;To dwell here upon the Italianizing versifiers, moralists, an&lt;&nbsp;pastoral romancers who attempted to refine the vernacula&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Romancero</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> Avould be superfluous. They are mainl;&nbsp;noticeable as proving that certain coteries in Spain wer&nbsp;Avilling to accept the Italian Renaissance. But the rea&nbsp;force of the people Avas not in this courtly literary style&nbsp;It expressed itself at last in the monumental Avork of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Do¡&nbsp;Quixote,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> which places Cervantes beside Rabelais, Ariosto&nbsp;and Shakespeare as one of the four supreme exponents o&nbsp;the Renaissance. The affectations of decadent chivaln&nbsp;disappeared before its humour; the lineaments of a nobh&nbsp;nation, animated by the youth of modern Europe emerging&nbsp;from the Middle Ages, were portrayed in its enduring pic&nbsp;tures of human experience. The Spanish drama, mean&nbsp;Avhile, untrammelled by those false canons of pseudo&nbsp;classic taste which fettered the theatre in Italy ant&nbsp;afterAvards in France, rose to an eminence in the hands o:&nbsp;Lope de Vega and Calderon Avhich only the English, ant&nbsp;the English only in the masterpieces of three or four play&nbsp;Avrights, can rival. Camoeus, in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lusiad,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> if we may&nbsp;here group Portugal with Spain, was the first modern poel&nbsp;to compose an epic on a purely modern theme, vying Avitl:&nbsp;Virgil, but not bending to pedantic rules, and breathing&nbsp;the spirit of the age of heroic adventures and-almost fabu&nbsp;lous discoveries into his melodious numbers. What has&nbsp;chiefly to be noted regarding the achievements of the&nbsp;Spanish race in arts and letters at this epoch is then&nbsp;potent national originality. The revival of learning pro&nbsp;duced in Spain no slavish imitation as it did in Italy, nc&nbsp;formal humanism, and, it may be added, very little ol&nbsp;fruitful scholarship. The Renaissance here, as in England,&nbsp;displayed essential qualities of intellectual freedom, delight&nbsp;in life, exultation over rediscovered earth and man.
