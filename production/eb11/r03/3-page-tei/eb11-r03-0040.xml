But from about 1903 this equivalence of infantry weapons began to be disturbed by two new influences: the tendency towards a “ short ” rifle, and the introduction of the pointed bullet.</p><p>In the first, Switzerland took the lead with the short Schmidt-Rubin in 1900. But amongst the greater powers, England and the United States alone have followed her example. At the close of the South African War Great Britain issued 1000 short Lee-Enfield rifles experimentally, and in 1903 the “ short rifle ” was actually approved and issued generally. Since then it has been improved in details. The barrel was shortened by 5 in., multiple-loading by charger was introduced, and by the <hi rend="italic">Musketry Regulations</hi>  of 1909 magazine fire was laid down as the normal, single-loading being forbidden. The change met with very considerable opposition, especially from target-shooting experts, who maintained that a long rifle, so perfected in details as to be equal to the short in every point except in length, must be more accurate. The view of the military authorities, which was maintained in spite of criticism, was that for service purposes, and especially for prolonged snap-shooting, the handier weapon was preferable. One important factor in the decision was the desire to give the cavalry a weapon with which, when dismounted, it could fight the infantry rifle on equal terms. A more serious objection than that of want of superfine accuracy in bull’s-eye shooting was the loss of 5 in. of reach in bayonet fighting. This objection was met in 1907 by the introduction of a new pattern bayonet with a blade 5 in. longer. In 1908 the long Lee-Enfield and Lee-Metford rifles in store were converted for charger-loading (fig. 3), fitted with safety catches and</p><p>The United States in 1904 replaced the Krag-Jorgensen (handloading horizontal magazine) by the short Springfield. A sort of spring bayonet was at first fitted to this rifle, but it was soon replaced by an ordinary sword bayonet.</p><p>The pointed bullet (“ Spitz-geschoss'” or “S”) was introduced hy Germany in 1905, and her example was quickly followed by France (balle D) and other powers. Its advantage is a considerable flattening of the trajectory, chiefly on account of the lessened resistance of the air. This latter allows of a reduction in the sectional density and consequently in the weight of the bullet. Thus velocities up to 2900 foot-seconds are realized, which enables the “ dangerous space ” to be very greatly augmented (see fig. 20). The “ fixed sight ” range with the “ S” bullet is 700 yds., as against the Lee-Enfield’s 500. It was announced in the House of Commons in 1910 that a modified bullet was being experimented with, and that some increase in the fixed-sight range was expected to be obtained, but the relatively weak breech action of the Lee-Enfield—which is due chiefly to the rearward position of the locking lugs—does not allow designers much freedom in the matter of increasing velocities, as the chamber pressure has to be kept low. It will be seen from the table that other rifles are constructed to stand a much higher pressure.</p><p>But both these improvements are destined to be eclipsed in importance by the adoption of the automatic rifle. The application of the automatic principle to the modem high-velocity small-arm of precision has been occupying the attention of the small-arms experts of all armies and of numerous private inventors for some years past. These numerous attempts have, in the case of the rifle, been largely doomed to failure because of the necessary Umitations of space and weight; although the automatic principle has been successfully applied both to machine guns <hi rend="italic">(q.v.)</hi>  and to pistols <hi rend="italic">(q.v.).</hi>  In these weapons the work of extracting the empty cartridge-case, re-loading and re-cocking, is accomplished either by the motive power of the recoil or of the gas generated by the explosion of the powder, thus enabling a rapid and continuous fire to be maintained to the fuU capacity of the weapon’s magazine. In the case of machine guns the firing also is automatic, but self-firing  rifles are not very desirable as infantry weapons and in addition are so heavy as to approximate to machine guns.</p><p>Of the recoil-operated class of automatic rifles there are two subdivisions, “ short-recoil ” and “ long-recoil. ” In the former, which is most favoured by inventors, the barrel, body and bolt recoil together for a short distance, about } in., in which space the bolt is unlocked, and the bolt then recoils freely in the body. The bolt is run forward in reloading by a spring. In the long-recoil type the barrel, body and bolt recoil the whole distance, and the barrel and body are run up by one spring, the bolt by another. Several such rifles have been shown at the N.R.A. meetings at Bisley; the Rexer, Mauser and Woodgate rifles being on the long-recoil, the Halle on the short-recoil principle. Gas-operated rifles, like the Hotchkiss and Colt machine guns, have fixed barrels and are worked by a portion of the powder-gases which is allowed to escape from the barrel through a small hole near the muzzle, thence entering a cyUnder and working a piston in connexion with the breech mechanism. No automatic rifle has as yet (August 1910) been issued as a service weapon by any power, the problem of ensuring certainty in action under service conditions—<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>  with grit and dirt in the working parts—being the principal difficulty.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Great Britain.—</hi>There are two principal types of Lee-Metford and Lee-Enfield rifles in the service, the “ short ” and the “ chargerloading.” The former is carried by all units (cavalry included) of the regular army, by the yeomanry cavalry of the Territorial Force, and by units of the Officers’, Training Corps. The latter is used by the infantry of the Territorial Force. There exist, further, the older, non-charger-loading Lee-Metford and Lee-Enfield rifles, a few carbines of the same type, and some Martini-Metford and Martini-Enfield carbines which have the *303 barrel and cartridge with the falling-block Martini action. -45 Martini-Henry rifles and carbines, and even Sniders, are still used by local police forces in some of the smaller colonies.</p><p>The “long” charger-loading Lee^Enfield is, converted, from earlier patterns by the, addition of a charger guide, the stripping of the bolt-cover, and improvements in the sighting. The action of the breech mechanism 1 is as follows (the breech mechanism of the “ short ” rifle being practically the same) : The breech is closed by a bolt (I) which slides in a bolt-way cut in the body; the bolt-head (Io) abuts against the base of the cartridge when the rifle is loaded, and when the knob is turned down the whole is locked. On the right side of the bolt is a solid rib, and on the left side a lug; these support the bolt on firing by contact with the “ resisting shoulder ” on the right, and the rear face of the “ lug seating ” on the left of the body. Underneath the bolt there are two recesses and two studs. The bolt-head is screwed to the bolt and is fitted with an extractor claw. The bolt-head, instead of being rigidly attached to the bolt, is so far independent that it remains stationary while the bolt is revolved. Inside the bolt is the arrangement of striker (V) and spring (W), and at its rear end, forming the Working connexion between trigger and striker, is the “ cocking-piece ” (X) which 4s fitted with a safety-catch (not in the old pattern rifle illustrated). This cocking-piece (which cannot turn) has a long tongue projecting to the front, lying along the under side of the bolt, and the front end of this tongue (Y), called the “ full-bent,”</p><p><hi rend="sup">1</hi> The annexed figures show the old pattern weapon. In both the existing patterns a safety catch is fitted, the magazine spring is of a different shape and there is no bolt-cover. But the essential parts of the action remain the same.</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
