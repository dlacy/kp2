<p><span class="font0">willing to keep him ſtill in view, made him prefect of the city ; which employment he filled, when the conſpirators fixed upon him as the propereſt perſon to ſucceed to the empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">His being advanced by Commodus only ſerved to increaſe his fears of falling as an object of his ſuſpi-eions ; when therefore the conſpirators repaired to his&nbsp;houſe by night, he conſidered their arrival as a command from the emperor for his death. Upon Lætus&nbsp;entering his apartment, Pertinax, without any ſhow of&nbsp;fear, cried out, That for many days he had expected&nbsp;to end his liſe in that manner, wondering that the emperor had deferred it ſo long. However, he was not&nbsp;a little ſurpriſed when informed of the real cauſe oſ&nbsp;their viſit ; and being ſtrongly urged to accept of the&nbsp;empire, he at laſt complied with their offer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Being carried to the camp, Pertinax was proclaimed emperor : ſoon after the citizens and ſenate conſented ; the joy for the election of a new ſovereign being ſcarce equal to that for the death of the former. The&nbsp;provinces quickly followed the example of Rome ; ſo&nbsp;that he began his reign with univerſal ſatisſaction to&nbsp;the whole empire, in the 68th year of his age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Nothing could exceed the wiſdom and juſtice of this monarch’s reign the ſhort time it continued. He puniſhed all thoſe who had ſerved to corrupt the late emperor, and diſpoſed of his ill-got poſſeſſions to public&nbsp;uſes. He attempted to reſtrain the licentiouſneſs of&nbsp;the prætorian bands, and put a ſtop to the injuries and&nbsp;inſolences they committed againſt the people. He ſold&nbsp;moſt of the buffoons and jeſters of Commodus as ſlaves;&nbsp;particularly ſuch as had obſcene names. He continually frequented the ſenate as often as it ſat, and never&nbsp;refuſed an audience even to the meaneſt of the people.&nbsp;His ſucceſs in foreign affairs was equal to his internal&nbsp;policy. When the barbarous nations abroad had certain intelligence that he was emperor, they immediately laid down their arms, well knowing the oppoſition&nbsp;they were to expect from ſo experienced a commander.&nbsp;His great error was avarice ; and that, in ſome meaſure, ſerved to haften his ruin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The prætorian ſoldiers, whoſe manners he had attempted to reform, having been long corrupted by the indulgence and profuſion of their former monarchs, began to hate him for the parſimony and diſcipline he&nbsp;had introduced among them. They therefore reſolved&nbsp;to dethrone him ; and for that purpoſe declared Maternus, an ancient ſenator, emperor, and endeavoured&nbsp;to carry him to the camp to proclaim him. Maternus,&nbsp;however, was too juſt to the merits of Pertinax, and&nbsp;too faithful a ſubject, to concur in their ſeditious designs ; wherefore eſcaping out of their hands, he fled,&nbsp;firſt to the emperor, and then out of the city. They&nbsp;then nominated one Falco, another ſenator ; whom the&nbsp;ſenate would have ordered for execution, had not Pertinax interpoſed, who declared that daring his reign no&nbsp;ſenator ſhould ſuffer death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">'1 </span><span class="font0">he prætorian ſoldiers then reſolved unanimouſly not to uſe any ſecret conſpiracies, or private contrivances,&nbsp;but boldly to ſeize upon the emperor and empire at&nbsp;once. They accordingly, in a tumultuous manner,&nbsp;marched through the ſtreets of Rome, and entered the&nbsp;palace without oppoſition. Such was the terror at their&nbsp;approach, that the greateſt part of the emperor ’s atten</span><span class="font1">dants forſook hiift </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">j</span><span class="font1"> while theſe who remaiaed earnçit-</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font0">ly intreated him to fly to the body of the people, and intereſt them in his defence. However, he rejected&nbsp;their advice ; declaring, that it was unworthy his imperial dignity, and all his paſt actions, to ſave himſelf&nbsp;by flight. Having thus reſolved to face the rebels, he&nbsp;had ſome hopes that his preſence alone would terrify&nbsp;and confound them. But what could his former virtues, or the dignity of command, avail againſt a tumultuous rabble, nurſed up in vice, and miniſters of former tyranny ? One Thauſius, a Tuagrian, ſtruck him&nbsp;with his lance on the breaſt, crying out, “ The ſoldiers ſend you this.” Pertinax finding all was over,&nbsp;covered his head with his robe, and ſunk down, mangled with a multitude of wounds, which he received&nbsp;from various aſſaſſins. Eclectus, and ſome more of his&nbsp;attendants, who attempted to defend him, were alſo&nbsp;ſlain : his ſon and daughter only eſcaped, who happened to be lodged out of the palace. Thus, after a&nbsp;reign of three mouths, Pertinax ſell a ſacriſice to the&nbsp;licentious ſury of the prætorian army. From the number of his adventures, he was called the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">tennis-ball of&nbsp;Fortune ;</span><span class="font0"> and certainly no man ever experienced ſuch </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">variety of ſituations with ſo blameleſs a character.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The ſoldiers having committed this outrage, retired with great precipitation ; and getting out of the city&nbsp;to the reſt of their companions, expeditiouſly fortified&nbsp;their camp, expecting to be attacked by the citizens.&nbsp;Two days having paſſed without any attempt of this&nbsp;kind, they became more inſolent ; and willing to make&nbsp;uſe of the power of which they found themſelves poſſeſſed, made proclamation, that they would ſell the empire to whoever would purchaſe it at the higheſt price,&nbsp;In conſequence of this proclamation, ſo odious and unjuſt, only two bidders were found ; namely, Sulpicia-nus and Didius Julianus: The former, a conſular perſon, prefect of the city, and ſon-in-law to the late emperor Pertinax ; the latter, a Conſular perſon likewile<sub>s&nbsp;</sub>a great lawyer, and the wealthieſt man in the city.&nbsp;He was ſitting with ſome ſriends at dinner when the&nbsp;proclamation was publiſhed ; and being charmed with&nbsp;the proſpect of unbounded power, immediately roſe&nbsp;ſrom tahle and haſtened to the camp. Sulpicianus&nbsp;was got there before him ; but as he had rather promiſes than treafore to beſtow, the offers of Didius, who&nbsp;produced immenſe ſums of ready money, prevailed»&nbsp;He was received into the camp by a ladder, and they&nbsp;inſtantly ſwore to obey him as emperor. From the&nbsp;camp he was attended by his new electors into the&nbsp;city ; tire whole body of his guards, which conſiſted of&nbsp;10,000 men, ranged around him in ſuch order as if&nbsp;they had prepared for battle, and not for a peaceful&nbsp;ceremony. The citizens, however, refuſed to confirm&nbsp;his election ; but rather curſed him as he paſſed. Up-»&nbsp;on being conducted to the ſenate-houſe, he addreſſed&nbsp;the few ſenators that were preſent in a very laconic&nbsp;ſpeech : “ Fathers, you want an emperor ; and I am&nbsp;the ſitteft perſon you can chooſe.” But even this, ihort&nbsp;as it ſeems, was unneceſſary, ſince the ſenate had it not&nbsp;in their power to refuſe their approbation. His ſpeech&nbsp;being backed by the army, to whom lie had given,&nbsp;about a million of our money, ſucceeded. The choice&nbsp;of the ſoldiers was confirmed by the ſenate, and Didius wag acknowledged emperor, now in the 57 th year&nbsp;of his. age.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a><h4><span class="font2">it </span><span class="font1">ſhould ſeem by this weak monarch’s conduct </span><span class="font0">when</span></h4><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
