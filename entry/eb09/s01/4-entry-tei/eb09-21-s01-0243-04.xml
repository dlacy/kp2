(Heb. jnoty, Shômerôn; LXX. Σαμάρεια, except in I Kings xvi. 24<note anchored="true" n="1" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The first ô in <hi rend="italic">Shômerôn</hi> can hardly represent the old pronunciation. In 1 Kings xvi. 24, the name of the city is derived from that of Shemer, from whom Omri bought the site, and here LXX. seems to have originally had Σαμάρων or (Cod. Vat. Σαεμηρων ), afterwards</p><p>corrected to Σαμορων (as in Lagarde’s edition of Lucian’s text) from the Hebrew tradition (compare Field’s <hi rend="italic">Hexapla</hi> on the passage). The Assyrian monuments have <hi rend="italic">Samirina.</hi></p></note>), the capital of Northern Israel from the time of Omri to the fall of the kingdom, which was consummated in the long siege of the royal city by Shalmaneser (2 Kings xvii. 5) and its capture by his successor Sargon (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>. 721 B.C.). The choice of Samaria as his capital by the warlike and energetic prince to whom the kingdom of Ephraim mainly owed its greatness is easily understood. It stands in the very centre of Palestine and of the country of the dominating tribe of Joseph, and, built on a steep and almost isolated hill, with a long and spacious plateau for its summit, was naturally a position of much strength, commanding two of the most important roads—the great north and south road which passes immediately under the eastern wall, and the road from Shechem to the maritime plain which runs a little to the west of Omri’s capital. The hill of Samaria is separated from the surrounding mountains (Amos iii. 9) by a rich and well-watered plain, from which it rises in successive terraces of fertile soil to a height of 400 or 500 feet. Only on the east a narrow saddle, some 200 feet beneath the plateau, runs across the plain towards the mountains; it is at this point that the traveller coming from Shechem now ascends the hill to the village of Sebastiya (now pronounced Sebastíya), which occupies only the extreme east of a terrace beneath the hill top, behind the crusading church of John the Baptist, which is the first thing that draws the eye as one approaches the town. The hill-top, the longer axis of which runs westward from the village, rises 1450 feet above the sea, and commands a superb view towards the Mediterranean, the mountains of Shechem, and Mount Hermon. The situation as a whole is far more beautiful than that of Jerusalem, though not so grand and wild. The line of the ancient walls has not been determined, the chief visible ruins being of the time of Herod; but, if they followed the natural lines of defence, the city may have been almost a mile in length from east to west.</p><p>The foundation of the new capital was speedily followed by the wars with Damascus, in which repeated ineffectual sieges by the Syrians proved the value of the stronghold; and even the Assyrians, as has been mentioned, reduced the place with difficulty. During part of the struggle with Damascus the kings of Israel often resided at Jezreel, which was nearer the seat of war; but Omri’s city never lost its pre-eminence. While it stood, Samaria and not Jerusalem was the centre of Hebrew life, and the prophets sometimes speak of it as also the centre of corrupt Jehovah- worship and idolatry (Hos. viii. 5, Mic. i. 5, Isa. x. 10).

<hi rend="italic">ashera</hi> of Samaria, which was not removed by the house of Jehu, is mentioned in 2 Kings xiii. 6 ; and Hos. viii. 5 seems to speak of calf-idols there, unless the prophet is already using the name of Samaria for tho kingdom as a whole, as later writers often do. Ultimately, in the Greek period, the name of Samaria or Samaritis was applied to the whole tract of which it is the centre—the region between Judaea and Galilee, the country of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Samaritans (q.v);</hi> and the New Testament uses Samaria in this sense. The city of Samaria was Hellenized by Alexander, who settled Macedonian colonists in it It became a fortress and was twice taken by siege in the wars of the Diadochi (by Ptolemy I. in 312 and by Demetrius Poliorcetes about 296). Under the Ptolemies Samaria was the head of a separate province, and it continued to be a strong city till John Hyrcanus took and utterly destroyed it after a year’s siege (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>. 110 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c</hi>.; see Jos., <hi rend="italic">Ant.,</hi> xiii. 10, 2 <hi rend="italic">sq.).</hi> Taken from the Jews by Pompey, Samaria was one of the ruined cities which Gabinius ordered to be restored (Jos., <hi rend="italic">Ant.,</hi> xiv. 5, 3); then given by Augustus to Herod the Great, it was refounded by him on a splendid scale probably in 27 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> the autumn of which year, according to Schürer’s calculations, is the probable epoch of the new city of Sebaste, as it was now called in honour of Augustus. Many remains of Herod's buildings, described by Josephus <hi rend="italic">{Ant.,</hi> xv. 8, 5; <hi rend="italic">B. J.,</hi> i. 21, 2), still remain; the most notable belong to a long colonnade just above the line of Herod’s wall and those of the great temple of Cæsar. The tombs of John the Baptist, Elisha, and obadiah were visited at Samaria in the time of Jerome (see O <hi rend="smallcaps">badiah),</hi> and that of St John must have been shown there still earlier, for it was violated by Julian. The old crusading church, now a mosque, was built over the tomb of the Baptist, who is reverenced as a prophet by the Moslems. A view and plan of the church, with details, are given in the <hi rend="italic">Survey of W. Pah (Memoirs,</hi> vol. ii. p. 211 <hi rend="italic">sq.),</hi> where also there is a plan of the city.
