<p><span class="font0">. Russia's advance westward raised indirectly the Eastern Question, because it threatened two of France's traditional&nbsp;allies, ■ Sweden and Poland, and Choiseul considered&nbsp;that the best means of checkmating Catherine's&nbsp;aggressive schemes was to incite France's third&nbsp;traditional ally, Turkey, to attack her. This was not&nbsp;a difficult matter, because the Sublime Porte had many things&nbsp;to complain of in the past and had good reason to fear&nbsp;aggression in the near future. War was accordingly declared&nbsp;in 1768, but it proved disastrous for the sultan; and he had&nbsp;to sign in 1774 the treaty of Kuchuk-Kainarji, which gave</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Russia a firm hold on the Black Sea and the lower Danube (see Turkey: </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History).</span><span class="font0"> The Tatars of the Bug, of the Crimea and&nbsp;of the Kuban were liberated from the suzerainty of the Porte;&nbsp;Azov, Kinburn and all the fortified places of the Crimea were&nbsp;ceded to Russia; the Bosphorus and Dardanelles were opened&nbsp;to Russian merchant vessels; and Russian ambassadors&nbsp;obtained the right to intervene in favour of the inhabitants of&nbsp;the Danubian principalities. Ten years later the semblance&nbsp;of independence which was left to the khans of the Crimea&nbsp;was destroyed and the peninsula formally annexed to the empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The peace concluded at Kuchuk-Kainarji was not of long duration. Catherine had conceived an ambitious plan of&nbsp;solving radically the Eastern Question by partitioning Turkey&nbsp;as she and her allies had partitioned Poland, and she had&nbsp;persuaded the emperor Joseph II. to take part in the scheme.&nbsp;It was intended that Russia should take what remained of the&nbsp;northern coast of the Black Sea, Austria should annex the&nbsp;Turkish provinces contiguous to her territory, the Danubian&nbsp;principalities and Bessarabia should be formed into an independent kingdom called Dacia, the Turks should be&nbsp;expelled from Europe, the Byzantine empire should be resuscitated, and the grand-duke Constantine, second son of the&nbsp;Russian heir-apparent, should be placed on the throne of the&nbsp;Palaeologi. Rumours of this gigantic scheme reached Constantinople, and as Catherine’s menacing attitude left little&nbsp;doubt as to her aggressive intentions the Porte presented an&nbsp;ultimatum and finally declared war (1787). Fortune again&nbsp;favoured the Russian arms, but as Austria was less successful&nbsp;and signed a separate peace at Sistova in 1791, Catherine did&nbsp;not obtain much matérial advantage from the campaign. By&nbsp;the peace of Jassy, signed in January 1792, she retained Ochakov&nbsp;and the coast between the Bug and the Dniester, and she secured&nbsp;certain privileges for the Danubian principalities, but the Turks&nbsp;remained in Constantinople, and the realization of the famous&nbsp;Greek project, as it was termed, had to be indefinitely postponed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">During the first years of the French Revolution Catherine's sympathy with philosophic liberalism rapidly evaporated, and&nbsp;she did all in her power to stimulate the hostility of&nbsp;the European sovereigns to the democratic movement;&nbsp;but she carefully abstained from joining the Coalition,&nbsp;and waited patiently for the moment when the&nbsp;complications in western Europe would give her an opportunity of solving independently the Eastern Question in accordance with Russian interests. That moment never came.&nbsp;In November 1706, when the country was not yet prepared&nbsp;to énter on a decisive struggle with Turkey, Catherine died at&nbsp;the age of sixty-six, and was succeeded by her son Paul, whom</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">she had kept during her long réign in a state of semi-captivity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The short reign of Paul (1796-1801) resembled in many points the still shorter one of his father, Peter III. Both sovereigns&nbsp;were childishly wayward and capriciously autocratic;&nbsp;both were recklessly indifferent to the feelings, convictions and wishes of those around them; both took a passionate&nbsp;interest in the minutiae of military affairs; as Peter had&nbsp;conceived a boundless admiration for Frederick the Great, so&nbsp;Paul conceived a similar admiration for Napoleon, and both&nbsp;suddenly reversed the national policy to suit this feeling; both&nbsp;were singularly blind to the consequences of their foolish&nbsp;conduct; and both fell victims to court conspiracies which&nbsp;could be in some measure justified, or at least excused, on</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">patriotic grounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Paul left no deep, permanent mark on Russian history. In internal affairs he wished to undo what his mother had done,&nbsp;but his impulsive, incoherent efforts in that direction merely&nbsp;dislocated the administrative mechanism withput producing&nbsp;any tangible results. In foreign affairs he displayed the same&nbsp;capaciousness and want of perseverance. After proclaiming&nbsp;his intention of conferring on his subjects the blessings of&nbsp;peace, he joined in 1798 an Anglo-Austrian coalition against&nbsp;France; but when Austria paid more attention to her own&nbsp;interests than to the interests of monarchical institutions in&nbsp;general, and when England did not respect the independence&nbsp;of Malta, which he had taken under his protection, he succumbed&nbsp;to the artful blandishments of Napoleon and formed with him&nbsp;a plan for ruining the British empire by the conquest of India.&nbsp;Having roused, by what ought perhaps to be called his insanity,&nbsp;the enmity, distrust and fear of all around him, including some&nbsp;members of his own family, he was assassinated on the night&nbsp;of the 23rd to 24th of March 1801, and was succeeded by his&nbsp;son Alexander I.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The early part of Alexander's reign (1801-25) was a period of generous ideas and liberal reforms. Under the influence&nbsp;of his Swiss tutor, Frederick Cesar de Laharpe, he&nbsp;had imbibed many of the democratic ideas of the&nbsp;time, and he aspired to put them in practice, with&nbsp;the assistance at first of three young friends, Novosiltsov,&nbsp;Adam Czartoryski and Strogonov, who were his intimate&nbsp;counsellors and were popularly known as the Triumvirate, and&nbsp;later of Mikhail Speranski (?.r.). Some of the more oppressive&nbsp;measures of the previous reign were abolished; the clergy,&nbsp;the nobles and the merchants were exempted from corporal&nbsp;punishment; the central organs of administration were&nbsp;modernized and the Council of the Empire was created; the&nbsp;idea of granting a constitution was academically discussed;&nbsp;great schemes for educating the people were entertained;&nbsp;parish schools, gymnasia, training colleges and ecclesiastical&nbsp;seminaries were founded; the existing universities of Moscow,&nbsp;Vilna and Dorpat were reorganized and new ones founded&nbsp;in Kazan and Kharkov; the great work of serf-emancipation&nbsp;was begun in the Baltic provinces. In all these schemes&nbsp;Alexander took a keen personal interest; but his enthusiasm&nbsp;was soon cooled by practical difficulties, and his attention&nbsp;became more and more engrossed by foreign affairs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">At that time, in respect of foreign affairs, Russia was entering on a new phase of her history. Hitherto she had confined her&nbsp;efforts to territorial expansion in eastern Europe and in Asia,&nbsp;and she had sought foreign alliances merely as temporary&nbsp;expedients to facilitate the attainment of that object. Now&nbsp;she was beginning to consider herself a powerful member of&nbsp;the European family of nations, and she aspired to exercise a&nbsp;predominant influence in all European questions. This tendency&nbsp;was already shown by Catherine when she* created the League&nbsp;of Neutrals as an arm against the naval supremacy of England,&nbsp;and by Paul when he insisted that his peace negotiations with&nbsp;Bonaparte should be regarded as part of a general European&nbsp;pacification, in which he must be consulted. Alexander&nbsp;insisted still more strongly on this claim, and in the convention&nbsp;which he concluded with the First Consul in October&nbsp;1801 it was agreed that the maintenance of a just&nbsp;equilibrium between Austria and Prussia should be&nbsp;taken as an invariable principle in the plans of both&nbsp;parties, that the integrity of the kingdom of the Two Sicilies&nbsp;should be respected, that the • duke of Württemberg should&nbsp;receive in Germany an indemnity proportionate to his losses,&nbsp;that the dominions of the elector of Bavaria should be preserved&nbsp;intact, and that the independence of the Ionian Islands should&nbsp;not be violated. Having obtained these important concessions&nbsp;the tsar imagined for a moment that in any further territorial&nbsp;changes he would be consulted and his advice allowed due&nbsp;weight, and he seems even to have indulged in the hope that&nbsp;the affairs of Europe might be directed by himself and bis new&nbsp;ally. His illusion was soon dispelled, because the aims and&nbsp;policy of the two potentates were utterly irreconcilable.
