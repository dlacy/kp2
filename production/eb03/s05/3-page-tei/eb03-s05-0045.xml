It was visited by Sir Joſeph Banks, who communicated the following account of it to Mr Pennant.</p><p>“ The little iſland of Staſſa lies on the weſt coaſt of Mull, about three leagues north-eaſt from Iona, or Icolumbkill : its greateſt length is about an Engliſh mile, and its breadth about half a one. On the weſt side of the iſland is a ſmall bay where boats generally land ; a little to the ſouthward of which the firſt appearance of pillars are to be obſerved : they are ſrnall ; and inſtead of being placed upright, lie down on their ſides, each forming a ſegment of a circle. From thence you paſs a ſmall cave, above which the pillars, now grown a little larger, are inclining in all directions ; in one place in particular, a ſmall maſs of them very much reſembles the ribs of a ſhip. From hence having paſſed the cave, which, if it is not low-water, you must do in a boat, you come to the first ranges of pillars, which are ſtill not above half as large as thoſe a little beyond. Over againſt this place is a ſmall iſland, called in Erſe <hi rend="italic">Boo-ſha-la,</hi> ſeparated from the main by a channel not many fathoms wide. This whole iſland is compoſed of pillars without any ſtratum above them ; they are ſtill small, but by much the neateſt formed of any about the place.</p><p>“ The firſt division of the iſland, for at high water it is divided into two, makes a kind of a cone, the pillars converging together towards the centre : on the other they are in general laid down flat ; and in the front next to the main, you see how beautifully they are packed together, their ends coming out ſquare with the bank which they form. All theſe have their tranſverſe ſections exact, and their ſurfaces ſmooth ; which is by no means the case with the large ones, which are cracked in all directions. I much queſtion, however, if any part of this whole iſland of Boo-ſha-la is two feet in diameter.</p><p>“ The main iſland oppoſite to Boo-ſha-la, and farther towards the north-weſt, is ſupported by ranges of pillars pretty erect, and, though not tall (as they are not uncovered to the baſe), of large diameters; and at their feet is an irregular pavement, made by the upper ſides of ſuch as have been broken off, which extends as far under water as the eye can reach. Here the forms of the pillars are apparent : theſe are of three, four, five, six, and ſeven sides ; but the number of five and six are by much the moſt prevalent. The largeſt I meaſured was of ſeven ; it was four feet five inches in diameter.</p><p>“ The ſurfaces of theſe large pillars, in general, are rough and uneven, full of cracks in all directions ; the tranſverſe figures in the upright ones never fail to run in their true directions. The ſurfaces upon which we walked were often flat, having neither concavity nor convexity ; the larger number, however, were concave, though ſome were very evidently convex. In ſome places, the interſtices within the perpendicular figures were filled up with a yellow ſpar : in one place, a vein paſſed in among the maſs oſ pillars, carrying here and there ſmall threads of ſpar. Though they were broken and cracked through in all directions, yet their perpendicular figures might eaſily be traced : from whence it is eaſy to infer, that whatever the accident might have been that cauſed the diſlocation, it happened after the formation of the pillars.</p><p>“ From hence proceeding along ſhore, you arrive at Fingal’s cave. Its dimensions I have given in the form of a table :</p></body></text></TEI>
