<p><span class="font0">who followed him and brought him wide acknowledgment. It is notable that American architects who have studied in Europe,&nbsp;especially in Paris, are apt to drift either into a pathless eclecticism or into the English current. Richardson did neither.&nbsp;The Romanesque that he saw in Europe, especially in the&nbsp;middle and south of France, appealed so strongly to his sense&nbsp;for mass and broad picturesqueness that he soon followed its&nbsp;leading, away from the style he had learned in Paris. His&nbsp;earliest work was modem French in style; his first church,&nbsp;in Springfield, a startlingly independent version of English&nbsp;Gothic. Yet half a dozen buildings made the transition to&nbsp;that derivative of Romanesque to which afterwards in all his&nbsp;buildings he steadfastly adhered. In Trinity church, his first&nbsp;monumental work, perhaps his finest, he broke away absolutely&nbsp;from the prevailing English Gothic fashion. Instead of the&nbsp;long Latin cross with aisles and transepts, he made a wide cross&nbsp;almost Greek in plan, with short arms fifty feet broad and&nbsp;aisles that are only passages, a narthex flanked by two western&nbsp;towers, a nave of one double bay, an eastern arm prolonged&nbsp;into a great apse of the full width of the crossing, over which&nbsp;sits a massive square tower. The arms of the church are&nbsp;barrel-vaulted in wood; under the great tower is a flat coffered&nbsp;ceiling a hundred feet above the floor. The style, though&nbsp;mixed, shows his surrender to the attraction of the churches&nbsp;in Auvergne, which have furnished the material for the design&nbsp;of the apse. .The central tower is a reminiscence of the noble&nbsp;lantern of the old cathedral of Salamanca, but the square&nbsp;outline is insisted on instead of the polygonal, and the forms&nbsp;are in other ways much changed. The alteration of the Capitol&nbsp;at Albany, half a dozen years later, shared with Leopold&nbsp;Eidlitz, was a compromise in style, and so lacks the sure handling&nbsp;of his best work, except in that part of the interior in which&nbsp;he was untrammelled, the Senate Chamber and the great&nbsp;staircase. In the buildings at Pittsburg, on the other hand,&nbsp;he was free from interference, and these satisfied him more&nbsp;than any other of his buildings. His great design for the new&nbsp;cathedral at Albany, an adaptation of the Romanesque&nbsp;forms of Auvergne to a large modern problem, would have&nbsp;displayed his mature manner, and been perhaps his greatest&nbsp;work; but the plan did not lend itself to the tradition or the&nbsp;ritual of the Anglican Church, and it was rejected, to his great&nbsp;disappointment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">At first the breadth of his compositions was offset by a richness of ornament which he afterwards called flamboyant,&nbsp;but there was a continual growth in simplicity. Some of his&nbsp;imitators have abused his example, runniug into mere baldness&nbsp;and brutality, but his own work never lost the fineness of quality&nbsp;with which he began, nor the adequacy of its detail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Richardson's uncommon personality so embodied itself in his works that it cannot be overlooked. He had an inexhaustible&nbsp;energy of body and mind, an enthusiasm more genial than&nbsp;combative, but so abounding and at times vehement that few&nbsp;men and few bodies of men could resist him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Abounding energy he had, but not health. .A serious bodily injury, and later a chronic malady, made his last years a constant struggle with suffering and infirmity, borne with indomitable cheerfulness, but at last fatal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is likely that the small number of his designs enhanced their quality. He put twice the labour into his work that the&nbsp;average architect would have given to it, and often twice the&nbsp;time, but the result was apt to be twice as good. He found&nbsp;American architecture restless, incoherent and exuberant;&nbsp;his example did much to turn it back to simplicity and repose.&nbsp;He came as near to establishing a style as it is given to any one&nbsp;man to come; but the tendency of the time was too strong,&nbsp;and the classic styles, reasserting themselves, once more drove&nbsp;out the medieval.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RICHARDSON, SIR JOHN (1787-1865), British naturalist, was bom at Dumfries on the 5th of November 1787. He studied&nbsp;medicine at Edinburgh, and became a surgeon in the navy in&nbsp;1807. In 1819 he was appointed surgeon and naturalist to&nbsp;Franklin's first arctic expedition (1819-22), and he served in&nbsp;the same capacity to the second (1825-26). The scientific&nbsp;results of these expeditions he described in contributions to&nbsp;Franklin's </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Narratives,</span><span class="font0"> and especially in the four quarto volumes&nbsp;of his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Fauna Boreali-Americana</span><span class="font0"> (1829-37). He was knighted&nbsp;in 1846, and in the following year was chosen commander of&nbsp;the Franklin search expedition (1848-49), the journal of which&nbsp;he published in 1851 under the title of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">An Arctic Searching&nbsp;Expedition.</span><span class="font0"> In 1855 he retired to Grasmere, where he died on&nbsp;the 5th of June 1865. He also wrote accounts dealing with the&nbsp;natural history, and especially the ichthyology, of several other&nbsp;arctic voyages, and was the author of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ieones Piscium</span><span class="font0"> (1843),&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Catalogue of Apodal Fish in the British Museum, translated from&nbsp;the German MS.</span><span class="font0"> (1856), the second edition of YarrelPs </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History&nbsp;of British Fishes</span><span class="font0"> (i860), and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Polar Regions</span><span class="font0"> (1861), expanded&nbsp;from an article with the same title which he wrote for the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopaedia Britannica.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RICHARDSON, SAMUEL (1689-1761), English novelist, is a notable example of that “late-flowering” sometimes applied&nbsp;to Oliver Goldsmith. Bom under William and Mary, the reign&nbsp;of the second George was well advanced before, at fifty years of&nbsp;age, he made his first serious literary effort—-an effort which&nbsp;was not only a success, but the revelation of a new literary form.&nbsp;He was the son of a London joiner, who, for obscure reasons,&nbsp;probably connected with Monmouth's rebellion, had retired to&nbsp;an unidentified town in Derbyshire, where, in 1689, Samuel was&nbsp;born. At first intended for holy orders, and having little but&nbsp;the common learning of a private grammar school—for the&nbsp;tradition that upon the return of the family to the metropolis&nbsp;he went to Christ’s Hospital cannot be sustained—he was&nbsp;eventually, as some compensation for a literary turn, apprenticed&nbsp;at seventeen to an Aldersgate printer named John Wilde. Here,&nbsp;like the typical “ good apprentice ” of his century, he prospered;&nbsp;became successively compositor, corrector of the press, and&nbsp;printer on his own account; married his master's daughter&nbsp;according to programme ; set up newspapers and books ;&nbsp;dabbled a little in literature by compiling indexes and “ honest&nbsp;dedications,” and ultimately proceeded Printer of the Journals of&nbsp;the House of Commons, Master of the Stationers' Company, and&nbsp;Law-Printer to the King. Like all well-to-do citizens, he had&nbsp;his city house of business and his “ country box ” in the&nbsp;suburbs; and, after a thoroughly “ respectable ” life, died on&nbsp;the 4th of July 1761, being buried in St Bride's Church, Fleet&nbsp;Street, close to his shop (now demolished), No. 11 Salisbury&nbsp;Court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To this uneventful and conventional career one would scarcely look for the birth and growth of a fresh departure in fiction.&nbsp;And yet, although Richardson's manifestation of his literary&nbsp;gift was deferred for half a century, there is no life to which&nbsp;the Horatian “ qualis ab incepto &quot; can be more appropriately&nbsp;applied. From his youth this moralist had moralized; from&nbsp;his youth—nay, from his childhood—this letter-writer had&nbsp;written letters; from his youth this supreme delineator of the&nbsp;other sex had been the confidant and counsellor of women. In&nbsp;his boyhood he was secretary-general to all the love-sick girls of&nbsp;the neighbourhood; at eleven he addressed a hortatory epistle,&nbsp;stuffed with texts, to a scandal-loving widow; and whenever it&nbsp;was possible to correspond with any one he was as “ corresponding ” as even Horace Walpole could have desired. At last, when&nbsp;he was known to the world only as a steady business man, who&nbsp;was also a “dab at an index” and an invaluable compiler of the&nbsp;“ puff prefatory,” it occurred to Mr Rivington of St Paul’s&nbsp;Churchyard and Mr Osbornof Patemoster Row, two bookselling friends who were aware of his epistolary gifts, to suggest&nbsp;that he should prepare a little model letter-writer for such&nbsp;“ country readers ” as “ were unable to indite for themselves.”&nbsp;Would it be any harm, he suggested in answer, if he should also&nbsp;“ instruct them how they should think and act in common&nbsp;cases ”? His friends were all the more anxious that he should</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
