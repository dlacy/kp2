<p><span class="font0">headlands of the western coast of Ross-shire, north of Loch Carron, are composed of sandstone, exhibiting the usual&nbsp;smooth and regular outline characteristic of that formation ;&nbsp;and hence the promontories are tame, and of an unvaried&nbsp;reddish coloured aspect, and the shores of the bays are for&nbsp;the most part covered over with brown heath. It is therefore more in the inner recesses of these inlets, and perhaps&nbsp;somewhat inland, that truly beautiful and romantic scenery&nbsp;is to be found. The coast of the island of Lewis is so indented with bays, lochs, creeks, and long and tortuous arms&nbsp;of thc sea, as to bid defiance to any enumeration or description within the confined limits assigned to this article.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The general surface of Ross and Cromarty is wild and mountainous, the mountain chains and groups being interspersed with valleys, glens, lakes, and rivers, exhibiting nature in every variety of form and character. The mountains, and particularly those towards the west, are covered&nbsp;with excellent pasture for sheep. Some of the sheep-farms&nbsp;are extensive, and possessed by sheep-farmers of capital,&nbsp;who have introduced the Cheviot breed of sheep, or a cross&nbsp;of that breed. The valleys and glens are depastured by&nbsp;large herds of cattle. Although agriculture is found in&nbsp;patches in the valleys and on the shores of the west coast,&nbsp;the great agricultural district of Ross and Cromarty is tllat&nbsp;extending from Dingwall along the northern shore of Cromarty Frith, and so onwards in a north-eastern direction&nbsp;along the Moray Frith and that of Dornoch. The soil and&nbsp;climate of Easter Ross are as fine as any in Scotland, the&nbsp;agriculture is of the very best description, and the numerous gentlemen’s seats and extensive plantations with&nbsp;which it is ornamented render this one of' the most pleasant, smiling, and cheerful countries that the stranger can&nbsp;visit. All the grains and other agricultural produce of&nbsp;Britain are here raised in perfection ; and if we were desired to fix on a spot in any part of Scotland where the best&nbsp;fruits could be produced, or where the rarest or most delicate plants or trees could best be reared, we should be disposed to fix on Tarbat House, on the northern shore of the&nbsp;Bay of Cromarty. We may further venture to assert, that&nbsp;no traveller of taste can possibly drive along that northern&nbsp;shore, from Dingwall eastwards, without very great enjoyment. The roads made in Ross-shire by the parliamentary&nbsp;commissioners are extensive and excellent, and they are&nbsp;kept in the highest state of repair. Many of the wildest&nbsp;and most unapproachable districts have thus been opened ;&nbsp;but there are still many left hermetically sealed against all&nbsp;but the adventurous horseman or the unwearied pedestrian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Amongst the numerous fresh-water lakes and rivers to be found in Ross and Cromarty, we may particularize the&nbsp;following. On the eastern side of the island we have Loch&nbsp;Ailsh and Loch Craggan, that give birth to the river&nbsp;Oikel, which divides Ross-shire from Sutherland, and which,&nbsp;after a course of forty miles, finds its way into the upper&nbsp;end of Dornoch Frith, near the fine iron-arched bridge&nbsp;of Bonnar. Then, as we move southwards, we have the&nbsp;river Carron and the Water of Fearn, discharging themselves into the same frith. Cromarty Frith receives the&nbsp;large and important stream of the river Conan, which&nbsp;drains off the waters of Lochs Tolimuir, Garrogan, and&nbsp;Garve ; Loch Fannich, Loch Roslik, Lochs Lett, Achin,&nbsp;Hular, and Luichart ; Loch Benachan, Loch Scolbuck, and&nbsp;Lochs Negin and Nerick, and Loch Gowrie, by the important tributary river Orrin. Lochs Calavie and Gedd&nbsp;furnish their supplies to the river BeauΓy of Inverness-shire.&nbsp;Loch Clunie, half of which is in Ross-shire, pays its tribute&nbsp;to Loch Ness by the river Morrison. On the west coast&nbsp;we have the rivers Shed and Ling, the one tributary to&nbsp;Loch Duich, and the other to Loch Ling ; the river Carron discharging into Loch Carron the waters of Lochs Doule&nbsp;and Scaven. In Applecross we have Lochs Lundie and&nbsp;Daroph, and the rivers of Applecross and Torridon, the</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">last mentioned discharging itself into Loch Torridon. Loch Vallich, and a great chain of small lakes, empty their waters&nbsp;into Gairloch, as do Lochs Naheig, Padnascally, and Slat-tadale. The river Ewe, which is only one mile in length,&nbsp;discharges into Loch Ewe the waters of the grand Loch&nbsp;Maree, together with those of Loch Clare and its chain of&nbsp;small lochs, and those of Loch Gurraig; Loch Poolewe&nbsp;also sends its stream into Loch Ewe. Loch Fuir and Loch&nbsp;Shallag have their embouchures in Loch Greinord. The&nbsp;waters of Lochs Arin and Druin find their way into Loch&nbsp;Broom, as do those of Loch Damph and Loch Auchall, and&nbsp;those of Loch Cruisk through the stream of the Strakemort ;&nbsp;Loch Kynoch, Loch Lurgan, and Loch Baddagyle send&nbsp;their streams into Loch Enard; and Lochs Skinaskink,&nbsp;Achyle, Vattie, and Fin also discharge themselves into the&nbsp;same bay, at the north-western point of the Coygash part&nbsp;of Cromarty. All these lochs and streams abound with&nbsp;fish, and salmon are particularly abundant in all the rivers,&nbsp;especially in the Oikel and in the Ewe. Short as is the&nbsp;course of this last-mentioned stream, it so swarms with salmon that twenty fish are no uncommon number for an expert angler to take in one day. Loch Maree, from which&nbsp;it derives its stream, is by far the largest and finest lake in&nbsp;Ross-shire. It is eighteen miles long, and from one to three&nbsp;miles broad ; and the greater part of it is full sixty fathoms&nbsp;deep, so tllat it has never been known to freeze even in the&nbsp;most intense frosts. It contains no less than twenty-four&nbsp;islands, and its mountains are magnificent. The highest of&nbsp;the group is Sliabhach or Slioch, which is estimated at about&nbsp;three thousand feet. The Messrs Andersons of Inverness,&nbsp;in their admirable Guide to the Highlands and Islands of&nbsp;Scotland, tell us that the scenery of this lake is the most&nbsp;utterly savage and terrific, in its barrenness and loneliness,&nbsp;of any part of this land of the mountain and the flood.&nbsp;A few ash-trees, oaks, birches, and pines, the latter but&nbsp;remnants of a gigantic ancient forest, are seen along the&nbsp;water’s edge, and beautify some of the islands in a high degree. But above this narrow zone scarcely a blade of grass&nbsp;exists, and eternally recurring sheets, precipices, and tables&nbsp;of dark-brown sandstone and quartz rock meet the eye in&nbsp;every direction. Ben Eye, at the south-eastern end, is the&nbsp;only exception, for it consists of two high sharp peaks of&nbsp;pure white quartz rock, and its form is altogether beautiful&nbsp;and stately. The Corries, and the solitudes of Glen Logan, opposite to it, on the other side of the lake, are the favourite haunts of the red deer. Ben Lairg and Stengach,&nbsp;also on the northern shore, are both stupendous mountains : the former recedes to a considerable distance from&nbsp;the margin of the lake, while the latter is visible at once&nbsp;from its base to the summit. Its lower acclivities are remarkably steep, and in one part it presents a front of abrupt lofty cliffs, disposed in great horizontal sections, along&nbsp;the crevices of which' a few aged and fantastically shaped&nbsp;pine-trees are seen casting forth their arms against the&nbsp;western breeze. Its rocks contain an unexampled number&nbsp;of varieties of quartz, and the view from its top is unusually grand and extensive. The easiest way to survey its&nbsp;scenery is from a boat. The path on the northern shore&nbsp;by Letterewe is hardly passable, and that on the opposite&nbsp;side is surpassed by none in the Highlands for ruggedness&nbsp;and sterility. It clambers up many rocky channels of torrents, and then, adapting its course to the shelf of a long&nbsp;ledge of sandstone, it stops suddenly over a precipice, leaving the bewildered stranger in utter uncertainty where he&nbsp;is next to step. Yet there are many beauties mingled with&nbsp;all this ruggedness, and some of the numerous little bays&nbsp;are full of the loveliest features of fairy landscape. In the&nbsp;middle of this romantic lake, there is an island called Island&nbsp;Maree, on which there is a very ancient burying-ground.&nbsp;Some think that it was dedicated to the Virgin Mary, and&nbsp;that, from this circumstance, both the island and the lake de-</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
