He was made rector of that university in 1873. In 1874 and 1875 he was the official reporter of the memorable Reunion Conferences held at Bonn in those years and attended by many distinguished theologians of the Oriental and Anglican communions.</p><p>Reusch was a profound scholar, an untiring worker and a man of lovable character. Among his voluminous works were contributions to the <hi rend="italic">Revue internationale de théologie,</hi>  a review started at Bern at the instance of the Old Catholic Congress at Lucerne. He wrote also works on the Old Testament; a pamphlet on <hi rend="italic">Die Deutschen Bischöfe und der Aberglaube;</hi>  and another on the falsifications to be found in the treatise of Aquinas against the Greeks; as well as essays on the history of the Jesuit Order, and a book of prayers. But his fame will mainly rest on the works which he and DoUinger published jointly. These consisted of a work on the Autobiography of Cardinal BeUarmine, the <hi rend="italic">Geschichte der Moralstreitigen in der Römisch-Katholischen Kirche seit dem XVI. Jahrhundert,</hi>  and the <hi rend="italic">Erörterungen über Leben und Schriften des hl. Liguori. </hi>During the last few years of his life he was smitten with paralysis. He died on the 3rd of March 1900, leaving behind him in manuscript a coUection of letters to Bunsen about Roman cardinals and prelates, which has since been published. (J. J. L. *)</p><p>REUSCH, HANS HENRIK (1852-    ), Norwegian geologist,</p><p>was born at Bergen on the 5th of September 1852. Hc was educated at Christiania, Leipzig and Heidelberg, and graduated Pb.D. at Christiania in 1883. He joined the Geological Survey of Norway in 1875, and became Director in 1888. He is distinguished for his researches on the crystaUine schists and the Palaeozoic rocks of Norway. He discovered Silurian fossils in the highly altered rocks of the Bergen region; and in 1891 he called attention to a palaeozoic conglomerate of glacial origin in tbe Varanger Fiord, a view confirmed by Mr A. Strahan in 1896, who found glacial striae on the rocks beneath the ancient boulder-bed. Reusch has likewise thrown light on the later geological periods, on the Pleistocene glacial phenomena and on the sculpturing of the scenery of Norway. Among his separate publications are <hi rend="italic">Silur fossiler og pressede Kon-glomerater</hi>  (1882); <hi rend="italic">Det nordlige Norges Geologi</hi>  (1891).</p><p>REUSS, AUGUST EMANUEL VON (1811-1873), Austrian geologist and palaeontologist, the son of Franz Ambrosius Reuss (1761-1830), was born at Bilin in Bohemia on the 8th of July 1811. He was educated for the medical profession, graduating in 1834 at the university of Prague, and afterwards practising for fifteen years at BiUn. His leisure was devoted to mineralogy and geology, and the results of his researches were pubUshed in <hi rend="italic">Geognostische Skizzen aus Böhmen</hi>  (1840-44) and <hi rend="italic">Die Versteinerungen der Böhmischen Kreideformation</hi>  (1845-46). In 1849 he gave up his medical practice, and became professor of mineralogy at the university of Prague. There he estab-Hshed a fine mineralogical coUection, and he became the first lecturer on geology. In 1863 he was appointed professor of mineralogy in the university of Vienna. He investigated the Cretaceous fauna of Gosau, and studied the Crustacea, including entomostraca, the corals, bryozoa, and especially the foraminifera of various geological formations and countries. He died at Vienna on the 26th of November 1873.</p><p>REUSS<hi rend="sub">t</hi> ÉDOUARD GUILLAUME EUGÈNE &lt;1804-1891), Protestant theologian, was born at Strassburg on the 18th of July 1804. He studied philology in his native town (1819-22), theology at Göttingen under J. G. Eichhorn; and Oriental languages at Halle under Wilhelm Gesenius, and afterwards at Paris under SiIvestre de Sacy (1827-28). In 1828 he became <hi rend="italic">Privatdozeni</hi>  at Strassburg. From 1829 to 1834 he taught BibUcal criticism and Oriental languages at the Strassburg Theological School; he then became assistant, and afterwards, in 1836, regular professor of theology at that university. The sympathies of Reuss were German rather than French, and after the annexation of Alsace to Germany he remained at Strassburg, and retained his professorship till, in 1888, he retired on a pension. Amongst his earliest works were: <hi rend="italic">De Iibris veteris Testamenti Jpocrypkis plebi non negandis</hi>  (1829), <hi rend="italic">Ideen zur Einleitung in das Evangelium Johannis</hi>  (1840) and <hi rend="italic">Die Johanneische Theologie</hi>  (1847). In 1852 he pubUshed his <hi rend="italic">Histoire de la théologie chrétienne au siècle apostolique,</hi>  which was foUowed in 1863 by <hi rend="italic">HHistoire du canon des saintes écritures dans Véglise chrétienne.</hi>  In 1874 he began to pubUsh his translation of the Bible, <hi rend="italic">La Bible, nouvelle traduction avec commentaire.</hi>  It was the criticism and exegesis of the New Testament which formed the subject of Reuss’s earUer labours—in 1842, indeed, he had published in German a history of the books of the New Testament, <hi rend="italic">Geschichte der heiligen Schriften N. Test.*,</hi>  and though his own views were Uberal, he opposed the results of the Tübingen school. After a time he turned his attention also to Old Testament criticism, for which he was especially fitted by his sound knowledge of Hebrew. In 1881 he pubUshed in German his <hi rend="italic">Geschichte der heiligen Schriften A. Test.,</hi>  a veritable encyclopaedia of the history of Israel from its earliest beginning tiU the taking of Jerusalem by Titus. He died at Strassburg on the 15th of AprU 1891.</p><p>Reuss belonged to the more modern section of the Liberal party in the Lutheran Church. His critical position was to some extent that of K. H. Graf and J. Wellhausen, aUowing for the circumstances that he was in a sense their forerunner, and was actuaUy for a time Graf’s teacher. Indeed, he was reaUy the originator of the new movement, but hesitated to pubUsh the results of his studies. For many years Reuss edited with A. H. Cunitz (b. 1812) the <hi rend="italic">Beiträge zu den theologischen Wissenschaften.</hi>  With A. H. Cunitz and J. W. Baum (1809-1878), and after their death alone, he edited the monumental edition of Calvin’s works (38 vols., 1863 ff.). His critical edition of the Old Testament appeared a year after his death. His son, Ernst Rudolf (b. 1841), was in 1873 appointed city Ubrarian at Strassburg.</p><p>See the article in IIerzog-Hauck, <hi rend="italic">Realencyklopadie,</hi>  and cf. Otto Pfleiderer, <hi rend="italic">Development of Theology in Germany since Rant </hi>(1890).</p><p>REUSS, the name of two small principaUties of the German empire, caUed Reuss, elder line, or Reuss-Greiz, and Reuss, younger line, or Reuss-Schleiz-Gera. With a joint area of 441 sq. m. they form part of the complex of Thuringian states, and consist, roughly speaking, of two main blocks of territory, separated by the Neustadt district of the duchy of Saxe-Weimar. The more southerly, which is much the larger of the two portions, belongs to the bleak, mountainous region of the Frankenwald and the Vogtland, whUe the northern portion is hiUy, but fertile. The chief rivers are the Weisse Elster and the Saale. About 35% of the total surface is occupied by forests, while about 40% is under tiUage and about 19% under meadow and pasture. Wheat, rye and barley are the principal crops grown, and the breeding of cattle is an important industry.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Reuss-Greiz,</hi>  with an area of 122 sq. m., belongs to the larger of the two divisions mentioned above, and consists of three large and several smaU parcels of Iand. On the whole, the soil is not favourable for agriculture, but the rearing of cattle is carried on with much success. About 63% of the inhabitants maintain themselves by industrial pursuits, the chief products of which are the making of wooUen fabrics at Greiz, the capital, and of stockings at Zeulenroda. Other industries are machine-budding, printing and the making of paper and porcelain. In 1905 the population of the principality was 70,603. The constitution of Reuss-Greiz dates from 1867, and provides for a representative chamber of twelve members, of whom three are appointed by the prince, while two are chosen by the landed proprietors, three by the towns and four by the rural districts. The revenue and expenditure amount to about £76,000 a year, and there is no public debt. The reigning prince is Henry XXIV. (b. 1878), but as he is incapable of discharging his duties, these are now undertaken by a regent.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Reuss-Schleiz-Gero,</hi>  with an area of 319 sq. m., includes part of the southern and the whole of the northern of the two main divisions mentioned above; it touches Bavaria on the south</p><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
