<p><span class="font0">interesting by his abundant illustration drawn from the private and social life of his contemporaries. He has&nbsp;knowledge of the world, the suppleness of a courtier,&nbsp;Spanish vivacity, and the “ ingenium amcenum ” attributed&nbsp;to him by Tacitus, the fruit of which is sometimes seen in&nbsp;the “honeyed phrases” mentioned by Petronius,—pure&nbsp;aspirations combined with inconsistency of purpose,—the&nbsp;inconsistency of one who tries to make the best of two&nbsp;worlds, the ideal inner life and the successful real life in&nbsp;the atmosphere of a most corrupt court. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pharsalici</span><span class="font0"> of&nbsp;Lucan (39-65), with Cato as its hero, is essentially a Stoical&nbsp;manifesto of the opposition. It is written with the force and&nbsp;fervour of extreme youth and with the literary ambition of&nbsp;a race as yet new to the discipline of intellectual culture,&nbsp;and is endowed with a rhetorical rather than a poetical&nbsp;imagination. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Satires</span><span class="font0"> of Persius (34-62) are the purest&nbsp;product of Stoicism,—a Stoicism that had found in a living&nbsp;contemporary, Thrasea, a more rational and practical hero&nbsp;than Cato. But no important writer of antiquity has less&nbsp;literary charm than Persius. He either would not or could&nbsp;not say anything simply and naturally. In avoiding the&nbsp;literary conceits and fopperies which he satirizes he has&nbsp;recourse to the most unnatural contortions of expression.&nbsp;Of the works of the time that which from a human point&nbsp;of view is perhaps the most detestable in ancient literature&nbsp;has the most genuine literary quality, the fragment of the&nbsp;prose novel of Petronius. It is most sincere in its representation, least artificial in diction, most penetrating in its&nbsp;satire, most just in its criticism of art and style.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(2) A greater sobriety of tone was introduced both into life and literature with the accession of Vespasian. The&nbsp;time was, however, characterized rather by good sense and&nbsp;industry than by original genius. Under Vespasian Pliny&nbsp;the elder is the most important prose-writer, and Valerius&nbsp;Flaccus, author of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Argonautica,</span><span class="font0"> the most important&nbsp;among the writers of poetry. The reign of Domitian,&nbsp;although it silenced the more independent spirits of the&nbsp;time, Tacitus and Juvenal, witnessed more important contributions to Roman literature than any age since the&nbsp;Augustan,—among them the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Institutes</span><span class="font0"> of Quintilian, the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Punic War</span><span class="font0"> of Silius Italicus, the epics and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Silvan</span><span class="font0"> of&nbsp;Statius, and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Epigrams</span><span class="font0"> of Martial. Quintilian (c. 35-95) is brought forward by Juvenal as a unique instance&nbsp;of a thoroughly successful man of letters, of one not belonging by birth to the rich or official class who had risen&nbsp;to wealth and honours through literature. He was well&nbsp;adapted to his time by his good sense and sobriety of judgment. His criticism is just and true rather than subtle&nbsp;or ingenious, and thus stands the test of the judgment of&nbsp;after-times. The poem of Silius (25-101) is a proof of the&nbsp;industry and literary ambition of members of the rich&nbsp;official class. Of the epic poets of the Silver Age Statius&nbsp;(c. 45-96) shows the greatest technical skill and the richest&nbsp;pictorial fancy in the execution of detail; but his epics&nbsp;have no true inspiring motive, and, although the recitation&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Thebaid</span><span class="font0"> could attract and charm an audience in&nbsp;the days of Juvenal, it really belongs to the class of poems&nbsp;so unsparingly condemned both by him and Martial. In&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Silvae,</span><span class="font0"> though many of them have little root in the&nbsp;deeper feelings of human nature, we find occasionally more&nbsp;than in any poetry after the Augustan age something of&nbsp;the purer charm and pathos of life. But it is not in the&nbsp;artificial poetry of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Silvas,</span><span class="font0"> nor in the epics and tragedies&nbsp;of the time, nor in the cultivated criticism of Quintilian&nbsp;that the age of Domitian lives for us. It is in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Epigrams</span><span class="font0"> of Martial (c. 41-102) that we have a true image&nbsp;of the average sensual frivolous life of Rome at the end&nbsp;of the 1st century, seen through a medium of wit and&nbsp;humour, but undistorted by the exaggeration which moral&nbsp;indignation and the love of effect add to the representation&nbsp;of Juvenal. Martial represents his age in his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Epigrams,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">as Horace does his in his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Satires</span><span class="font0"> ami </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Odes,</span><span class="font0"> with more&nbsp;variety and incisive force in his sketches, though with&nbsp;much less poetic charm and serious meaning. We know&nbsp;the daily life, the familiar personages, the outward aspect&nbsp;of Rome in tire age of Domitian better than at any other&nbsp;period of Roman history, and that knowledge we owe to&nbsp;Martial. Though a less estimable character than some of&nbsp;them, he is a better writer than any of his contemporaries&nbsp;because he did not -withdraw into a world of literary interests, but lived and wrote in the central whirl of city&nbsp;life. He tells us the truth of his time without the wish&nbsp;cither to protest against or to extenuate its vices.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(3) But it was under Nerva and Trajan that the greatest and most truly representative works of the empire were&nbsp;written, those which at once present the most impressive&nbsp;spectacle to the imagination and have made its meaning&nbsp;sink most deeply into the heart and conscience of the&nbsp;world. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Annals</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Histories</span><span class="font0"> of Tacitus (54-119),&nbsp;with the supplementary </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Life of Agricola</span><span class="font0"> and the treatise&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">On the Manners of the Germans,</span><span class="font0"> and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Satires</span><span class="font0"> of Juvenal&nbsp;(c. 47-130) have summed up for all after-times the moral&nbsp;experience of the Roman world from the accession of&nbsp;Tiberius to the death of Domitian. The powerful feelings under which they both wrote, the generous scorn and&nbsp;generous pathos of the historian acting on extraordinary&nbsp;gifts of imaginative insight and imaginative characterization, and the fierce indignation of the satirist finding its&nbsp;vent in exaggerating realism, have undoubtedly disturbed&nbsp;the completeness and exactness of the impressions which&nbsp;they received and have perpetuated; nevertheless their&nbsp;works are the last powerful voices of Rome, the last voices&nbsp;expressive of the freedom and manly virtue of the ancient&nbsp;world. In them alone among the writers of the empire&nbsp;the spirit of the Roman republic seems to revive. The&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Letters</span><span class="font0"> of Pliny (61-c. 115), though they do not contradict&nbsp;the representation of Tacitus and Juvenal regarded as an&nbsp;exposure of the political degradation and moral corruption&nbsp;of prominent individuals and classes, do much to modify&nbsp;the pervadingly tragic and sombre character of their representation, and to show that life even in the higher&nbsp;circles of Roman society had still sources of pure enjoyment and wellbeing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">With the death of Juvenal, the most important part of whose activity falls in the reign of Trajan, Roman literature&nbsp;as an original and national expression of the experience,&nbsp;character, and sentiment of the Roman state and empire,&nbsp;and as one of the great literatures of the world, may be&nbsp;considered as closed. There still continued to be much&nbsp;industry and activity in gathering up the memorials of&nbsp;the past and in explaining and illustrating the works of&nbsp;genius of the ages of literary creation. A kind of archaic&nbsp;revival took place in the reign of Hadrian, which showed&nbsp;itself both in affectation of style and in a renewed interest&nbsp;in the older literature. The most important works of the&nbsp;age succeeding that of Juvenal are the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Biographies</span><span class="font0"> of&nbsp;Suetonius (c. 75-160), which did much to preserve a know<sup>r</sup>-ledge of both political and literary history. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Nodes&nbsp;Atticae</span><span class="font0"> of Aulus Gellius, written in the latter part of the&nbsp;2d century, have preserved many anecdotes, some of them&nbsp;of doubtful authenticity, concerning the older writers. The&nbsp;persistence of critical and grammatical studies and of interest in the literature of the past resulted in the 4th and&nbsp;5th centuries in the works of Donatus and Servius and&nbsp;in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Saturnalia</span><span class="font0"> of Macrobius. The works of the great&nbsp;Latin grammarians are also to be connected with the&nbsp;scholarly study of antiquity which superseded to a great&nbsp;extent the attempt to produce works of new creation. The&nbsp;writer of most original genius among the successors of&nbsp;Juvenal and Tacitus is probably Apuleius, and his most</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
