In the&nbsp;manufacture of printed cotton and woollen goods 22 establishments&nbsp;and 5000 workmen are employed. - The annual production of&nbsp;printed calico amounts to 1,000,000 pieces, each 105 metres (about&nbsp;115 yards) long ; 22 establishments with 700 workmen are devoted&nbsp;to the dyeing of cotton cloth, and 32 establishments with 1200&nbsp;workmen to the dyeing of cotton thread, the industry being specially&nbsp;favoured by the quality of the water of Rouen. There are also 3&nbsp;soap works, 7 chemical works, manufacturing soda, vitriol, and&nbsp;dyestuffs, and 10 iron foundries. Engineering works manufacture&nbsp;steam-engines, spinning-machines, and weaving-looms, agricultural&nbsp;machines, sewing-machines, &amp;c., which are sold throughout France&nbsp;and exported to other countries to a total value of £360,000.&nbsp;There is an establishment at Déville for refining copper and manufacturing copper pipes. Other works at Rouen are distilleries, oil&nbsp;mills, bleacheries and cloth-dressing establishments, tanneries, and&nbsp;ship-building yards.

<p><span class="font1">indebted to its first bishops—</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">from St Mello, the apostle of the region, who flourished about 260, to St Remigius, who died in 772. Ten or twelve of&nbsp;those prelates have the title of saints ; they built in their city&nbsp;many churches, and their tombs became in turn the origin of new&nbsp;sanctuaries, so that Rouen was already, at that early period, what&nbsp;it has remained to the present time, and in spite of its political&nbsp;character—a religious city full of ecclesiastical monuments. From&nbsp;this period there has been preserved the precious crypt of St&nbsp;Gervais, which contains the tomb of the second bishop of Rouen,&nbsp;St Avitian. Under Louis “le Débonnaire” and his successors&nbsp;Normans several times sacked the city, but the conversion of&nbsp;Rollo in 912 made Rouen the capital of Normandy, and raised&nbsp;it to a greater degree of prosperity than ever. The first Norman&nbsp;kings of England rather neglected Roucn in favour first of Caen&nbsp;and afterwards of Poitiers, Le Mans, or Angers ; but the monasteries, the local trade and manufactures, and the communal&nbsp;organization, which the people of Rouen had exacted from their&nbsp;sovereigns in 1145, maintained a most flourishing state of affairs,&nbsp;indicated by the rebuilding of several sumptuous churches, and&nbsp;notably of the great abbey which had been erected in the 5th&nbsp;century by St Victrix, and afterwards took the name of St Ouen&nbsp;from the bishop whose tomb it contained. Of this restoration there remains in the present building a small apse of two&nbsp;stories, Uie only Norman fragment of any importance preserved by&nbsp;the ancient capital of Normandy. The union of this province to</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">France by Philip Augustus in 1204 did no damage to the prosperity of Rouen, although its inhabitants submitted to their new master&nbsp;only after a siege of nearly three months. To this period belong,&nbsp;if not the commencement, at least the rapid erection of the most&nbsp;important building in the town, the cathedral of Notre Dame,&nbsp;whose vast pile, erected between 1200 and 1220 by an architect&nbsp;called Ingelram or Enguerrand, underwent so many alterations,&nbsp;restorations, and extensions that it took its final form only in&nbsp;the 16thccntury. It is in plan a Latin cross 427 feet in length,&nbsp;with aisles completely surrounding it and giving access to the&nbsp;three great chapels of the choir. The west façade and those of the&nbsp;transept are of extreme richness. Each was surmounted by two&nbsp;towers, of which only one—the Butter Toiver (Tour de Beurre)—&nbsp;was completed. The western façade, frequently enlarged, embellished, or restored from its first construction to the present time, has&nbsp;two Charmingside doorways of the close of the 12th century, a great&nbsp;central doorway, a rose window, and countless arcades and Gothic&nbsp;pinnacles and turrets of the close of the 15th and the beginning of&nbsp;the 16th century. The width of the front is increased by the projection of the two towers : that on the left hand, the Tour Saint-Romain, was commenced about 1200, and raised to a greater height&nbsp;in 1465-1477 ; that on the right hand, the finer, has a Iieightof 260&nbsp;feet, and takes its name of Butter Tower from the fact that it was&nbsp;erected between 1485 and 1507 by means of the moneys paid by&nbsp;the faithful for permission to eat butter in Lent. On the north</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">side of the cathedral are various accessory buildings dating from the AIiddle Ages, and the Booksellers’ Portal, corresponding to the&nbsp;Portail de la Calcnde in the south transept. Both portals are&nbsp;adorned with statues, and both, as well as the towers which flank&nbsp;them, date from the reigns of St Louis and Philip the Fair. Above&nbsp;the transept rises the central tower, which was rebuilt in the&nbsp;15th and 16th centuries, and had before its destruction by fire in&nbsp;1822 a Iieightof 430 feet. The iron spire added in 1876, though&nbsp;unfortunately much too slender, has raised it to a height of 485&nbsp;feet, and thus made it the highest erection in Europe after the&nbsp;spires of Cologne cathedral. While more harmonious in its style&nbsp;than the exterior, the interior of Notre Dame de Rouen presents&nbsp;nothing peculiar in its architecture, with the exception of the false&nbsp;gallery along the nave with passages running round the pillais ;&nbsp;but the artistic curiosities are numerous and varied. In the choir&nbsp;may be noted a fine series of 13th-century stained-glass windows,&nbsp;carved stalls of the 15th century, the tombs of the English kings&nbsp;Henry II. and Richard I., that of Bishop Maurille, who built the&nbsp;larger part of the present structure, an elegant Gothic staircase,&nbsp;and various tombs of archbishops and nobles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Philip Augustus built a castle at Rouen, but it was rather a fortress than a palace, and the kings of France never treated it as a&nbsp;residence ; a round keep called Joan of Arc’s Tower still stands. On&nbsp;the other hand, nothing remains of the castle erected by Henry V.&nbsp;of England when he took possession of Rouen in 1418 after a san</span></p>
