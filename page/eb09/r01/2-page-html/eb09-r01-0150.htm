<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">various Acts passed since 1870 school boards have power, with the consent of the secretary of state, to contribute to or wholly to&nbsp;undertake the establishment, building, and maintenance of industrial schools, and a power exists to transfer industrial schools&nbsp;from other authorities to school boards, but such schools are subject to the jurisdiction of the secretary of state in the same manner&nbsp;as other certified industrial schools. The machinery for bringing&nbsp;children, the subjects of certified industrial schools, before the proper&nbsp;tribunal for making orders has been and is a vexed question. Legislative powers given to “any one” are apt to fall into abeyance or&nbsp;into the hands of the police. School boards have a discretionary&nbsp;power to appoint officers to bring children before justices to be&nbsp;sent to industrial schools (33 and 34 Yict. c. 75, s. 36). A school&nbsp;board or school attendance committee (as the local authority) is&nbsp;required, after due warning to the parents, to complain to a court&nbsp;of summary jurisdiction of the non-attendance of a child coming&nbsp;within the elementary education Acts, and must so complain at&nbsp;the instance of any person. The court may then make an attendance order for the child at some certified efficient school, and, in&nbsp;case of non-compliance, may order the child to be sent to a certified&nbsp;day or other industrial school. The expenses of industrial schools,&nbsp;established by or contributed to by school boards, form part of the&nbsp;general expenses of the school fund. As in the case of other industrial schools, parents are liable to contribution, and where a&nbsp;child is ordered upon complaint made by a school attendance committee to be sent to a certified industrial school the council, guardians, or sanitary authority appointing such committee have, on&nbsp;the recommendation of the committee, the same power of contri-buting towards the maintenance as if they were a school board (42&nbsp;and 43 Viet. c. 48, s. 4).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">In 1876 a fresh class of industrial schools was introduced called “certified day industrial schools,” in relation to which prison&nbsp;authorities and school boards have the same powers as in the case&nbsp;of industrial schools ; and towards the custody, industrial training,&nbsp;elementary education, and meals of children attending these schools&nbsp;parliament may contribute a sum limited to Is. per head per week,&nbsp;on conditions recommended by the secretary of state, with a limited&nbsp;power over the contribution of parents. In certain cases of non-compliance with an attendance order the child is sent to a day&nbsp;industrial school rather than to an industrial school of the class&nbsp;described above (39 and 40 Viet. c. 79, s. 16). In large cities day&nbsp;industrial schools are calculated to be of great service in dealing&nbsp;with the class of poor neglected children. The children are found&nbsp;to be managed without much difficulty, and to respond to any&nbsp;efforts made on their behalf; they compare favourably with children&nbsp;kept for years in close confinement, and are often their superiors&nbsp;in spirit and intelligence (27th </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Report</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> of inspector). Another description of certified schools has sprung up in connexion with&nbsp;school boards,—“ truant schools. ” The few which at present are&nbsp;established in London and some large towns are on the whole doing&nbsp;a good work. The necessary adaptation of certified industrial&nbsp;schools to the school-board system must necessitate the placing of&nbsp;all reformatory and industrial schools on a clearer system of classification. Crime must be distinguished from pauperism. However&nbsp;crime may arise from neglect of parents, it is neither desirable nor&nbsp;fair to compel as the price of poverty children unconvicted of crime&nbsp;to associate with juvenile delinquents even after the punishment&nbsp;of crime has ceased. On the other hand, the actual incarceration&nbsp;of boys and girls in a jail should be avoided as far as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The total number of schools under Government inspection at the close of 1883 was 200, viz., 61 reformatory and 139 industrial&nbsp;schools, of which last 7 were specially certified as truant and 12&nbsp;as day industrial schools. The number of children under detention&nbsp;in 1883 in reformatory schools in Great Britain was 6657, at a total&nbsp;school expenditure of £126,122, of which £85,635 was paid by the&nbsp;treasury, £6140 by parents, £23,183 by rates, and £4943 by subscriptions and legacies. In industrial schools the number was&nbsp;18,780 and the expenditure £359,821, of which £176,733 was paid&nbsp;by the treasury, £17,596 by parents, £40,052 by rates, £65,542 by&nbsp;school boards, and £42,129 by subscriptions. The total admissions&nbsp;(excluding transfers) to reformatory schools to the end of 1883&nbsp;amounted to 42,669, viz., 34,640 boys and 8029 girls. The total&nbsp;discharges (excluding transfers) were 36,111, viz., 29,235 boys and&nbsp;6876 girls. They were disposed of as follows :—</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Ireland</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">.—Reformatory schools were established in Ireland in 1858, and ten years afterwards were placed mainly on their present&nbsp;footing (Irish Reformatory Schools Act, 1868) ; whilst the establishment and regulation of industrial schools were provided for by&nbsp;the Industrial Schools Act (Ireland), 1868, extending to Ireland,&nbsp;with certain modifications, the English Act of 1866. The differences between the Acts applicable in Ireland and Great Britain&nbsp;relate chiefly to minor matters. The rule requiring a young offender&nbsp;or a child to be sent to a school under the same religious management is much more rigid in Ireland than in Great Britain, and the&nbsp;Irish Act does not limit the power of sending a child under ten&nbsp;to a reformatory school where the child has not been previously&nbsp;charged with an offence punishable with penal servitude or imprisonment. The power to contract with managers for the reception and maintenance of young offenders is in general vested in&nbsp;grand juries and in some town councils. The number of reformatory schools in Ireland at the close of 1883 was 9, viz., 5 for&nbsp;boys and 4 for girls, with 907 boys and 192 girls. Of industrial&nbsp;schools there were 62, viz., 17 for boys, 44 for girls, and 1 for young&nbsp;boys and girls, with a total of 2409 boys and 3759 girls. The&nbsp;disposal on discharge follows the lines given in the tables for Great&nbsp;Britain. Much the larger proportion of girls in industrial schools&nbsp;in Ireland, as might be anticipated, find their subsequent career in&nbsp;employment or service, or are placed out through Mends. Emigration also is absolutely far larger (and has been from the establishment of industrial schools) in the case of girls than of boys. The&nbsp;reported results of the training of girls discharged from reformatory&nbsp;schools are very satisfactory, and among the 1526 girls discharged&nbsp;during the three years 1880-82 there was only one conviction for&nbsp;crime during 1883. The total receipts for the maintenance of&nbsp;reformatory schools in 1883 were £28,116, of which £17,555 was&nbsp;contributed by the treasuiy vote and £7920 from local rates. The&nbsp;average cost per head for maintenance (including rent and disposal) was £23, 9s. for boys and £27, 2s. 2d. for girls. For industrial schools the receipts in 1883 ־were £126,820, of which the&nbsp;treasuiy contributed £77,259 and rates £27,960. Parental contributions to reformatory and industrial schools were £1018.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">United States</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">.—The institutions in the United States and of other civilized countries, having for their object or effort the&nbsp;reclamation of the young, are too closely connected with the education of poor and destitute children generally to allow of examination&nbsp;here, or of useful comparison with the reformatory and industrial&nbsp;schools of Great Britain under state control.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">In 1882 a royal commission was issued to inquire into the management generally of all certified reformatories and&nbsp;industrial schools in the United Kingdom. The commission,&nbsp;in the following year, suggested a simplification of the law&nbsp;and the removal of some anomalies and defects, including&nbsp;the vexed question as to the treatment of boys and girls&nbsp;in relation to imprisonment, and the distinctions already adverted to. The commissioners expressed their opinion that&nbsp;these schools were having a salutary effect in reducing the&nbsp;amount both of juvenile and of adult crime. The memoranda of the earl of Dalhousie and Lord Norton attached to&nbsp;the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Report</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> are worthy of special attention. </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">(j.
