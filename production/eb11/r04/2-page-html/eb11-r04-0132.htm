        <p><span class="font2">found for the master of the legions within the narrow limits of the
                old Roman constitution. Augustus could say with truth that&nbsp;he had accepted no
                office which was “ contrary to the usage&nbsp;of our ancestors,” and that it was
                only in dignity that he took&nbsp;precedence of his colleagues. Nevertheless, as
                every thinking&nbsp;man must have realized, the compromise was unreal, and
                its&nbsp;significance was ambiguous. It was an arrangement avowedly&nbsp;of an
                exceptional and temporary character, yet no one could&nbsp;suppose that it would in
                effect be otherwise than permanent.&nbsp;The powers voted to Augustus were (like

                was afterwards&nbsp;renewed for successive periods of five, five, ten and ten
                    years.@@<sup>7&nbsp;</sup>In this way the powers of the principate were made
                coextensive&nbsp;in time with the life of Augustus, but there was absolutely
                no&nbsp;provision for hereditary or any other form of succession, and&nbsp;various
                expedients were devised in order to indicate the destined&nbsp;successor of the
                </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">princeps</span><span
                class="font2"> and to bridge the gap created by his&nbsp;death. Ultimately Augustus
                associated his stepson Tiberius&nbsp;with himself as co-regent. The </span><span

                >tribunicia&nbsp;potestas</span><span class="font2"> were conferred upon him, and he
                was thus marked&nbsp;out as the person upon whom the remaining powers of
                the&nbsp;principate would naturally be bestowed after the death of
                his&nbsp;stepfather. But succeeding emperors did not always indicate&nbsp;their
                successors so clearly, and, in direct contrast to the maxim&nbsp;that “ the king
                never dies,” it has been well said that the Roman</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">principate died with the death of the </span><span class="font2"
                style="font-style:italic;">princeps.@@<sup>8</sup></span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">In theory, at least, the Roman world was governed
            according</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">to the “ maxims of Augustus” (Suet. </span><span class="font2"
                style="font-style:italic;">Ner.</span><span class="font2"> 10), down to the time of
                Diocletian. Even in the 3rd century there is&nbsp;still in name at least, a
                republic, of which the emperor&nbsp;is in strictness only the chief magistrate,
                deriving&nbsp;his authority from the senate and people, and with&nbsp;prerogatives
                limited and defined by law. The case&nbsp;is quite different when we turn from
                theory to practice. The&nbsp;division of authority between the republic and its
                chief magistrate became increasingly unequal. Over the provinces
                the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">princeps</span><span
                class="font2"> from the first ruled autocratically; and this autocracy&nbsp;reacted
                upon his position in Rome, so that it became every&nbsp;year more difficult for a
                ruler so absolute abroad to maintain&nbsp;even the fiction of republican government
                at home. The&nbsp;republican institutions, with the partial exception of the
                senate,&nbsp;lose all semblance of authority outside Rome, and even as
                the&nbsp;municipal institutions of the chief city of the empire they retain&nbsp;but
                little actual power. The real government even of Rome&nbsp;passes gradually into the
                hands of imperial prefects and commissioners, and the old magistracies become merely
                decorations&nbsp;which the emperor bestows at his pleasure. At the same
                time&nbsp;the rule of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"
                >princeps</span><span class="font2"> assumes an increasingly personal character, and
                the whole work of government is silently concentrated in his hands and in those of
                his own subordinates. Closely&nbsp;connected with this change is the different
                aspect presented by&nbsp;the history of the empire in Rome and Italy on the one
                hand&nbsp;and in the provinces on the other. Rome and Italy share in&nbsp;the
                decline of the republic. Political independence and activity&nbsp;die out; their old
                pre-eminence and exclusive privileges gradually&nbsp;disappear; and at the same time
                the weight of the overwhelming power of the </span><span class="font2"
                style="font-style:italic;">princeps,</span><span class="font2"> and the abuses of
                their power by&nbsp;individual </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"
                >principes,</span><span class="font2"> press most heavily upon them. On
                the&nbsp;other hand, in the provinces and on the frontiers, where the&nbsp;imperial
                system was most needed, and where from the first it&nbsp;had full play, it is seen
                at its best as developing or protecting&nbsp;an orderly civilization and maintaining
                the peace of the&nbsp;world.</span></p><div>
            <p><span class="font2">The decay of the republican institutions had commenced before the
                    revolutionary crisis of 49. It was accelerated bv&nbsp;the virtual suspension of
                    regular government between&nbsp;49 and 28; and not even the diplomatic
                    deference&nbsp;towards ancient forms which Augustus displayed&nbsp;availed to
                    conceal the unreality of his work of&nbsp;restoration. The </span><span
                    class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">comitia</span><span class="font2">
                    received back from him&nbsp;“ their ancient rights ” (Suet. </span><span
                    class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Aug.</span><span class="font2"> 40),
                    and during his&nbsp;lifetime they continued to pass law’s and to
                    elect&nbsp;magistrates. But after the end of the reign of Tiberius&nbsp;we have
                    only two instances of legislation by the&nbsp;assembly in the ordinary
                        way,@@<sup>9</sup> and the law-making of the empire&nbsp;is performed either
                    by decrees of the senate or by imperial edicts&nbsp;and constitutions. Their
                    prerogative- of electing magistrates&nbsp;was, even under Augustus, robbed of
                    most of its importance&nbsp;by the control which the </span><span class="font2"
                    style="font-style:italic;">princeps</span><span class="font2"> exercised over
                    their choice by&nbsp;means of his rights of nomination and commendation,
                    which&nbsp;effectually secured the election of his own nominees.@@<sup>10</sup>
                    By&nbsp;Tiberius this restricted prerogative was still further
                    curtailed.&nbsp;The candidates for all magistracies except the consulship
                    were&nbsp;thenceforward nominated and voted for in the senate-house&nbsp;and by
                    the senators,@@<sup>11</sup> and only the formal return of the
                    result&nbsp;(re»««/ia//o) took place in the assembly (Dio lviii. 20).
                    And,&nbsp;though the election of consuls was never thus transferred to&nbsp;the
                    senate, the process of voting seems to have been silently&nbsp;abandoned. In the
                    time of the younger Pliny we hear only&nbsp;of the nomination of the candidates
                    and of their formal </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"
