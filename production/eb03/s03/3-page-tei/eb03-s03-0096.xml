C. and lived 912 years.</p><p>SETHIANS, in church-hiſtory, Chriſtian heretics; ſo called because they paid divine worſhip to Seth, whom they looked upon to be Jeſus Chriſt the ſon of God, but who was made by a third divinity, and ſubſtituted in the room of the two families of Abel and Cain, which had been deſtroyed by the deluge. Theſe heretics appeared in Egypt in the second century; and as they were addicted to all sorts of debauchery, they did not want followers ; and continued in Egypt above 200 years</p><p>SETIMO, a town of Italy, in the province of Piedmont, ſituated on the river Po, eight miles north of Turin.</p><p>SETON, in ſhrgery, a few horſe hairs, ſmall threads, or large packthread, drawn through the skin, chiefly the neck, by means of a large needle or probe, with a view to reſtore or preſerve health.</p><p>We find by experience, that ſetons are very uſeful in catarrhs, inflammations, and other diſorders, particularly thoſe of the eyes, as a gutta ſerena, cataract, and incipient ſuffuſion ; to theſe we may add intenſe headachs, with ſtupidity, drowſineſs, epilepſies, and even the apoplexy itself.</p><p>SETTEE, in sea-language, a veſſel very common in the Mediterranean with one deck and a very long and ſharp prow. They carry ſome two masts, ſome three, without top-maſts. They have generally two masts, equipped with triangular sails, commonly called <hi rend="italic">lateen ſails.</hi> The leaſt of them are of 60 tons burden. They ſerve to tranlport cannon and provisions for ſhips of war and the like. Theſe vesſels are peculiar to the Mediterranean ſea, and are uſually navigated by Italians, Greeks, or Mahometans.</p><p>SETTING, in aſtronomy, the withdrawing of a ſtar or planet, or its sinking below the horizon. Aſtronomers and poets make three different kinds of ſetting of the stars, viz. the <hi rend="smallcaps">Cosmical, Acronycal,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Heliacal.</hi> See theſe articles.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Setting,</hi> in the ſea-language. To ſet the land or the ſun by the compaſs, is to obſerve how the land bears on any point of the compaſs, or on what point of the compaſs the ſun is. Alſo when two ſhips ſail in  sight of one another, to mark on what point the chaſed bears, is termed <hi rend="italic">ſetting the chace by the compaſs.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Setting,</hi> among ſportſmen, a term tiled to expreſs the manner of taking partridges by means of a dog peculiarly trained to that purpoſe. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Shooting.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Act of</hi> SETTLEMENT, in Britiſh hiſtory, a name given to the ſtatute 12 and 13 W. III. cap. 2. whereby the crown was limited to his preſent majeſty’s illuſtrious houle ; and ſome new provisions were added, at the same fortunate era, for better ſecuring our religion, laws, and liberties ; which the ſtatute declares to be the birthright of the people of England, according to the ancient doctrine of the common law.</p><p>SEVENTH, in muſic, an interval called by the Greeks <hi rend="italic">heptachordon.</hi> See <hi rend="smallcaps">Interval.</hi></p><p>SEVERANCE, in law, the singling or severing two or more that join or are joined in the same writ or action. As if two join in a writ, <hi rend="italic">de libertate probanda, an</hi>d the one be afterwards uonſuited ; here ſeverance is </p><p>permitted, ſo as notwithſtanding the nonſuſt the one, the other may ſeverally proceed.</p><p>There is alſo ſeverance of the tenants in aſſize; when one, two, or more diſſeiſees appear upon the writ, and not the other. And ſeverance in debt, where two executors are named plaintiffs, and the one refuſes to proſecute. We alſo meet with ſeverance of ſummons, ſeverance in attaints, &amp;c. An eſtate in joint tenancy may be fevered and deſtroyed by deſtroying any of its unities. I. That of time, which reſpects only the original commencement of the joint eſtate, cannot indeed (being now part) be affected by any ſubſequent tranſaction. But, 2. The joint-tenants eſtate may be deſtroyed without any alienation, by merely diſuniting their poſſeſſion. 3∙ The jointure may be deſtroyed, by deſtroying the unity of title. And, 4. By deſtroying the unity of intereſt.</p><p>SEVERIA, a province of the Ruffian empire, with the title of a duchy, bounded on the north by Smolenſko and Muſcovy, on the eaſt by Vorotinſhi and the country of the Coſſacks, on the ſouth by the same, and on the west by Zernegovia. It is a country overrun with woods, and on the ſouth part is a foreſt of great length. Novogrodec, or Novogorod, is the capital town.</p><p>ST SEVERINA, a town of Italy, in the kingdom of Naples, and in Lower Calabria, with an archbiſhop’s ſee. It is very well fortified, and ſeated on a craggy rock, on the river Neeto; in E. Long. 17. 14. N. Lat 39. 15.</p><p>SEVERINO, a town of Italy, in the territory of the church, and in the Marche of Ancona, with a biſhop’s ſee. It has fine vineyards, and is ſeated between two hills on the river Petenza, in E. Long. <hi rend="italic">13.</hi></p><p>6. N. Lat. 43. 16.		</p><p>SEVERN, a river which rises near Blimlimmon- Hill in Montgomeryſhire, and before it enters Shropshire receives about 30 ſtreams, and paſſes down to Laudring, where it receives the Morda, that flows from Oſweſtry. When it arrives at Monford, it receives the river Mon, paſſing on to Shrewſhury, which it almoſt ſurrounds, then to Bridgeworth ;@@ afterwards it runs through the skirts of Staffordſhire, enters Worceſterſhire, and paſſes by Worcester; then it runs to lewkeſhury, where it joins the Avon, and from thence to Glouceſter, keeping a north-weſterly courſe, till it falls into the Briſtol Channel. It begins to be navigable for boats at Weichpool, in Montgomeryſhire, and takes in ſeveral other rivers in its courſe, beſides thoſe already mentioned, and <hi rend="italic">is the second in England.</hi> By the late inland navigation, it has communication with the rivers Merſey, Dee, Ribble, Ouſe, Trent. Derwent, Humber, Thames, Avon, &amp;c. which navigation, including its windings, extends above 500 miles in the counties of Lincoln, Nottingham, York Lancaſter, Weſtmoreland, Cheſter, Stafford, Warwick Leiceſter, Oxford, Worceſter, &amp;c. A canal from Stroud-Water, a branch of the Severn, to join the  Thames, has lately been undertaken, by which great undertaking of conveying a tunnel 16 feet high and 16 feet wide, under Sapperton Hill and Hayley-Wood (very high ground), for two miles and a quarter in length, through a very hard rock, lined and arched with brick, is entirely completed, and boats paſſed through it the 21st of May 1789. By this opening, a communication is made between the river Severn at</p><p>@@@[mu] Lucombe's English Gazetteer.</p></body></text></TEI>
