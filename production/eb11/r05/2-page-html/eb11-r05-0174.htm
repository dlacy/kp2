But the difficulties of the coast were such that it took three&nbsp;weeks to disembark the whole and to extend across the peninsula&nbsp;to Port Adams. Oku then, leaving the 5th division behind,&nbsp;moved down with the rest towards Kinchow, and after storming&nbsp;that place found himself face to face with a position of enormous&nbsp;strength, Nanshan Hill, at the narrowest part of the peninsula,&nbsp;where part of a Russian division (3000 only out of 12,000 were&nbsp;actually engaged) had fortified itself with extreme care. On the&nbsp;26th of May took place the battle of Nanshan. The Japanese&nbsp;attack was convergent, but there was no room for envelopment;&nbsp;the Russian position moreover was “ all-round ” and presented&nbsp;no flanks, and except for the enfilade fire of the Japanese and&nbsp;Russian gunboats in the shallow bays on either side the battle&nbsp;was locally at every point a frontal attack and defence. The&nbsp;first rush of the assailants carried them up to the wire and other&nbsp;obstacles, but they were for many hours unable to advance a step&nbsp;farther. But the resolute Oku attacked time after time, and at&nbsp;last the 4th division on his right, assisted by its gunboats,&nbsp;forced its w<sup>T</sup>ay into the Russian position.

It was, moreover, a preface to those furious assaults&nbsp;on Port Arthur which, because they were the expression of a&nbsp;need that every soldier felt, and not merely of a tactical method,&nbsp;transcend all cool-blooded criticism. The Japanese losses were&nbsp;4500 out of 30,000 engaged or 15%, that of the Russians fully&nbsp;half of the 3000 engaged. The victors captured many guns,&nbsp;but were too exhausted to pursue the Russians, whose retirement&nbsp;was not made in the best order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The transports were now conveying the 6th and nth divisions to Pitszewo; theses were to form the 3rd Army (Nogi) for operations against Port Arthur. Oku exchanged his 1st division for&nbsp;the 6th. The 2nd Army then turned northward (3rd, 4 th, 5th&nbsp;and 6th divisions). The 10th division, forming the nucleus of&nbsp;the 4th Army, had begun to land at Takushan on the 19 th of May.&nbsp;The 2nd and 4th Armies were the left wing of a widespread&nbsp;converging movement on Liao-Yang.
