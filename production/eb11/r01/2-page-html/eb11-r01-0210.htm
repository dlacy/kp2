<p><span class="font1">REED INSTRUMENTS (Fr. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">instruments à anche;</span><span class="font1"> Ger. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Blas-instrumente mit Zungen</span><span class="font1">; It</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">. Strumenti a ancia),</span><span class="font1"> a class of&nbsp;wind instruments in the tubes of which sound-waves are&nbsp;generated by the vibrations of a reed mouthpiece. Reed&nbsp;instruments fall into two great classes: (1) those blown directly&nbsp;by the breath of the performer, who is thus able in all but a&nbsp;few obsolete instruments to express his emotional feelings in&nbsp;music; (2) those in which the wind supply is obtained by&nbsp;mechanical devices, such as the bag of bagpipe instruments&nbsp;or the bellows of such keyboard instruments as the regal,&nbsp;harmonium and kindred instruments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Directly-blown reed instruments comprise the section of modern wind instruments known as the “wood wind,” with the&nbsp; exception of flute and piccolo; they are classified according to&nbsp;the kind of reed vibrator of which the mouthpiece is composed.&nbsp;There are three kinds of reed mouthpieces: (1) the single or&nbsp;beating reed; (2) the double reed; (3) the free reed, all of which&nbsp;perform the function of sound-producer (see Mouthpiece and&nbsp;Free Reed Vibrator). The reed used consists of a thin tongue&nbsp;or strip of reed, cane or some elastic material, thinned gradually&nbsp;to a delicate edge. It is adapted to a resonating tube in such a&nbsp;manner that when it is at rest the opening at the mouthpiece&nbsp;end of the tube consists only of a very slight aperture or chink,&nbsp;which is periodically opened and closed by the pulsations of the&nbsp;τeed when acted upon by the compressed breath of the player.&nbsp;This principle is common to all reed mouthpieces, and the&nbsp;difference in timbre is in a measure due to the manner in which&nbsp;the pulsations are brought about and the degree of elasticity&nbsp;secured.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">double reed</span><span class="font1"> consists of two blades of reed or laminae of elastic material tightly bound together by many turns of waxed&nbsp;silk, so that above the construction the tube has an oval section;&nbsp;below, where it communicates with the main bore of the instru-ment, the tube is strictly cylindrical. The chink here is formed&nbsp;by two thin walls of reed of equal elasticity (see Oboe, Bassoon).&nbsp;The double reed is common to the members of the oboe family,&nbsp;consisting, besides the oboe, of the cor anglais or tenor, of the&nbsp;fagotto or bassoon, and of the contra fagotto or double bassoon.&nbsp;The double reed mouthpiece is used besides on the sarrusophone&nbsp;family, instruments of brass but classed with the wood wind on&nbsp;account of the mouthpiece and fingering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">single</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">beating reed</span><span class="font1"> consists of a single blade bevelled at the edge and placed over a table or frame communicating&nbsp;with the main bore of the instrument, against which it beats,&nbsp;causing a series of pulsations. The single reed is common to all the members of the clarinet family, consisting, besides the&nbsp;clarinet, of the basset-horn or tenor, and of the bass and pedal&nbsp;clarinets; of the batyphone, an early bass clarinet, and of the&nbsp;saxophone, a metal oboe with a beating reed instead of a double&nbsp;reed. The ancient Greek aulos was undoubtedly used with a&nbsp;beating reed during some period of its history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">free reed</span><span class="font1"> is not represented among members of the modern wood wind, and, as adapted to a directly-blown instrument,&nbsp;only finds application in the Chinese chcng, the prototype of&nbsp;the harmonium, and in the mouth organ or harmonica.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The reed in wind instruments produces a peculiar tone quality to which it has given its name; it varies in the three different&nbsp;kinds of mouthpieces without losing the fundamental reedy&nbsp;timbre. In the single reed the impact against the hard wood&nbsp;or vulcanite of the table against which it beats produces a sound&nbsp;harsh and strident in inverse proportion to the degree of elasticity&nbsp;possessed by the vibrating tongue. In the clarinet the reed is&nbsp;carefully and delicately made of cane with due regard to the&nbsp;interdependence of reed and clarinet tube. The strong wooden&nbsp;or metallic beating reeds of the early organ reed pipes must&nbsp;have had an unpleasantly harsh timbre, which won for them in&nbsp;Germany the epithet </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Schnarrwerk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the double reed the two delicately shaped pieces of reed vibrate against each other, producing the somewhat nasal,&nbsp;reedy tone of the oboe family. In the free reed compressed&nbsp;air is the only buffer which the vibrator encounters while&nbsp;swinging through the aperture, alternately closing and reopening&nbsp;it; hence the soft and mellow timbre which it is possible to&nbsp;produce by proper treatment of the free reed. Experience has&nbsp;shown that the best results for the double reed are obtained when&nbsp;it is used in conjunction with a tube of conical bore, whereas&nbsp;the beating reed is heard to greater advantage in instruments&nbsp;with cylindrical bore, one notable exception in practice being,&nbsp;as already mentioned, the saxophone family. * The double&nbsp;reed adapted to a conical tube confers upon the latter the&nbsp;acoustic properties of the open pipe, whose wave-length is equal&nbsp;to that of the tube and which is capable of overblowing the octave&nbsp;and successive harmonics (theoretically). Either a single or a&nbsp;double reed adapted to a cylindrical pipe converts it for all&nbsp;acoustic purposes into a closed pipe, in which the whole wave-length is twice the length of the tube, a node forming at the&nbsp;mouthpiece end. The fundamental note of such a tube will&nbsp;therefore be an octave lower than that of an open pipe of the&nbsp;same length, and it can only overblow the uneven numbers of&nbsp;the harmonic series, such as the third harmonic (or twelfth above&nbsp;the fundamental).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In order to overblow on instruments with reed mouthpieces, greater pressure of breath must be exerted, and the vibrating&nbsp;length of the reed must be decreased by the action of the lips&nbsp;upon it. This is what occurs in instruments of the oboe and&nbsp;clarinet type, which are blown directly from the mouth. There&nbsp;are, however, cases in which the reed is concealed within the&nbsp;instrument out of reach of the lips, either in a capsule, as in the&nbsp;old instruments hautbois de Poitou and cromorne, or else in a&nbsp;socket, as in the chaunter and drones of the bagpipe, or, again,&nbsp;as in the mouthpieces of organ reed pipes. In the last (each of&nbsp;which gives but one fixed note) the vibrating length of the reed&nbsp;tongue is fixed, as is also the pressure of the compressed air&nbsp;supply fed to them. The result in all these cases is similar:&nbsp;no harmonics can be obtained, and therefore the scale of the&nbsp;instrument depends solely on the number of holes and keys&nbsp;provided, whereas, where the lips control the reed, fewer holes&nbsp;are necessary to produce any given compass. The chaunters of&nbsp;bagpipes have double reeds, but the drones are as a rule provided&nbsp;with beating reeds and are of cylindrical bore, a combination&nbsp;which, for the reason explained above, gives them a note an&nbsp;octave deeper in pitch, the length of pipe being equal, than would&nbsp;be the case if the bore were conical. In the musette, in the&nbsp;cornemuse used in concert with the hautbois de Poitou, and in&nbsp;the Neapolitan surdelina (see Bagpipe), both chaunter and&nbsp;drones had double reeds.</span></p>
