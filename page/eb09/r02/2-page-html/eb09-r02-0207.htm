<p><span class="font1">his cell by Christ Himself. Vespasian, son of the emperor Titus, falls ill, hears of Christ, frees Joseph from his prison, becomes a&nbsp;Christian, and reduces the Jews to slavery. Joseph takes leave&nbsp;of Vespasian, goes forth with those who had joined him and his&nbsp;brother-in-law Bron. After a while the adherents suffer privation&nbsp;for having sinned secretly, and Joseph is directed by the voice&nbsp;of Jesus speaking from the vaisseul (graal) to establish a test of&nbsp;righteousness and sin by means of the holy blood, calling to remembrance His own words about Judas, that “ he who shall betray&nbsp;Me is eating and drinking with Me.” The place of the rejected&nbsp;Judas should be filled, not at the table of the Last Supper, but at&nbsp;another table which Joseph should make in token of it,—a square&nbsp;one, and not until Brou’s grandson (the third man of Joseph’s&nbsp;lineage) should be fit to take it. The table was constructed, a&nbsp;repast prepared, one place left empty, and the Graal put upon the&nbsp;board, with some fish which had been caught by Bron for the occasion. Those who could find a place at the board felt a sense of&nbsp;satisfaction and were known to be righteous ; those who could find&nbsp;no place were recognized as the sinners whose secret licentiousness&nbsp;had caused the distress among them. Then the name of graal&nbsp;was given to the vaisseul, because of its gracious and delightful@@<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>influence. A hypocrite named Moyse who attempts to sit at the&nbsp;table without avowing his sins is swallowed up in the earth.&nbsp;Alan, the son of Bron, grows up to be head of the line, and is entrusted with the knowledge of all things that Joseph could teach&nbsp;and a sight of the Grail. He leads his kinsmen to the far West, to&nbsp;the vale of Avaron or Avalon, whither the disciple Petrus or Perron&nbsp;precedes them with a letter given him by Joseph, after he has seen&nbsp;the latter transfer to Bron the custody of the vaisseul. The son of&nbsp;Alan is in due time to grow to manhood, to read Peter’s letter, and&nbsp;again to see the Grail—a boon which is as it were to renew the&nbsp;covenant of the Saviour with the family and followers of Joseph of&nbsp;Arimathea—to expose and expel the false, and to bring celestial&nbsp;happiness upon all the true. The race is now settled in Britain,&nbsp;and Perceval, the son of Alan, is the third man who is to see the&nbsp;Grail, after having passed through a perilous quest. Up to this&nbsp;point the mystic and pious romance of the Grail was derived by&nbsp;Robert de Borron from sources other than those which furnished&nbsp;the Arthurian stories ; but the new realm of fiction was open (it&nbsp;was about 1160-70), and the Franco-British tales coming to his&nbsp;knowledge must have supplied him with the incidents of his&nbsp;third man’s quest and even the very name of Perceval. It is difficult to assign the exact proportion of give and take among the&nbsp;early romances ; but at this point there is a new departure in which&nbsp;several writers took various parts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">IV. 2. Perceval.—The original story of the knight Perceval, before he takes up the quest, is simply that of an inexperienced&nbsp;youth who knows nothing of arms and chivalry, but whose rustic&nbsp;retirement with his mother has not deteriorated the instincts of his&nbsp;noble birth. After some amusing incidents, in which his youthful&nbsp;awkwardness is playfully depicted, he exhibits so much courage&nbsp;and skill as to become a doughty champion, the vanquisher of&nbsp;bullies and the protector of ladies ; and, when he reaches the court&nbsp;of King Arthur, knighthood is offered him. Chrestien de Troyes&nbsp;related the tale in verse (before 1191), but he probably had it from&nbsp;the (prose or poetic) narrative woven (about 1170-75) by Walter&nbsp;Map into his work which we call Lancelot. The agreement, so&nbsp;far, of those writers and the text of the Mabinogi of Peredur on the&nbsp;same subject leads to a supposition that the latter represents a&nbsp;Cambrian story older than Walter Map ; but the introduction of&nbsp;the cup and the lance into it invalidates the theory that its existent&nbsp;Welsh form is the original. Robert de Borron continued his Graal,&nbsp;by relating the quest of the holy vessel—still in the hands of&nbsp;Bron, le Roi Pêclieour, but hidden from all save the predestined perfect knight—pursued by Bron’s grandson Perceval, the only man&nbsp;who, by his origin, had a right to search for and find it so as to fill&nbsp;the vacant place at the table. Robert de Borron must have written&nbsp;his story more than once, and the result was that he also introduced&nbsp;his hero to Arthur’s court, where Merlin had founded a round&nbsp;table. This round table, probably an independent element in the&nbsp;Breton legends, must have caught Robert de Borron’s fancy as&nbsp;lending a further symbol of trinity (being the third table) to his&nbsp;own conception of the third descendant of Joseph of Arimathea.&nbsp;In his relation of the quest Perceval (whom he in no way identifies&nbsp;with the rustic Perceval or Peredur mentioned above) starts from&nbsp;Arthur’s court, and after various adventures sees his grandfather,&nbsp;the Grail, the lance, and the broken sword without knowing with&nbsp;whom he is or making inquiry. In a second attempt he is more&nbsp;successful. Bron reveals himself, explains all the signs (the lance&nbsp;is that which pierced the Saviour’s side), and communicates the&nbsp;precious truths which Joseph of Arimathea had ordered to be told&nbsp;only to the third of his lineage. Then the fisher-king dies ; all&nbsp;the enchantments of Britain pass away (we presume the reign of&nbsp;idolatry is meant) ; and Perceval is left as the custodian of the&nbsp;Grail. This version of the Perceval and the preceding Saint Graal,&nbsp;both by Robert de Borron, have only been printed of late years&nbsp;(the former as a supplement to the latter) from rare and little known&nbsp;MSS., and differ enormously from the old printed Grail and Perceval,&nbsp;and most of the MSS. which contain them. The introduction,&nbsp;however slightly, of Arthur, Merlin, and Gawain into Robert de&nbsp;Borron’s Perceval simply shows that he had made acquaintance&nbsp;with Walter Map’s Lancelot ; yet the large use made by Map of the&nbsp;Frenchman’s Grail and Perceval implies that they wrote contemporaneously, but that De Borron’s second part preceded Map’s&nbsp;second part. In the latter the young rustic is represented as tne&nbsp;youngest son of King Pellinore, brought by an elder brother out of&nbsp;his retirement and presented for an inferior class of knighthood at&nbsp;Arthur’s court. He then meets all the other companions of the&nbsp;Round Table, to whom, as well as to Arthur and Guinevere, he&nbsp;makes himself very dear. He becomes one of the knights who&nbsp;undertake the quest of the Grail, a task which is proposed for&nbsp;accomplishment by him who is the best knight in the world.&nbsp;According to the Lancelot fiction he fails because of having slightly</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;">
