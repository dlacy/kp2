<p><span class="font2">of Gothic is the change of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span class="font2"> to i, so that it has names ending in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">mir.</span><span class="font2"> Of these we find no trace whatever in ltaly, on the contrary&nbsp;we find </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Gundimar, Ildimar<sub>t</sub></span><span class="font2"> &amp;c. Then we have abbreviated forms&nbsp;in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">izzo, e.g. Gaudizzo, Albizzo<sub>t</sub></span><span class="font2"> &amp;c., which are distinctly Lombardic;&nbsp;but not Gothic ones in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">-ila.</span><span class="font2"> There is no parallel to all this in the&nbsp;Iberian peninsula. As we have already said, the Gothic contribution to the vocabulary is very slight. But on the other hand&nbsp;in the Hth century the great majority of proper names is Gothic,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">e.g, Alfonsus (Hadufonsus)<sub>t</sub> Gundomirus<sub>t</sub> Recimirus,</span><span class="font2"> &amp;c. ; or&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Recila<sub>t</sub> Fafila<sub>t</sub></span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Elvira<sub>t</sub></span><span class="font2"> O. Port. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Gelvira<sub>t</sub></span><span class="font2"> Goth. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">*Gailavira,</span><span class="font2"> and&nbsp;scores of others, all proving the great influence of Gothic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">And lastly, France possesses the. largest number of Germanic elements in its vocabulary, Gothic in the south, Frankish in the&nbsp;north (though it is often impossible to ascertain to which class&nbsp;they belong). But beside these there are many Old High German&nbsp;words, and again Anglo-Saxon and northern ones, more particularly those connected with shipping and the sea. These Germanic&nbsp;elements cover nearly all branches of human activity. Thus </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">bât,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">Fr. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">bâtir,</span><span class="font2"> “ to build,” from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">*bastyan<sub>t</sub></span><span class="font2"> “ to bind together with bast,&quot;&nbsp;“ to plait ”; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">hourder,</span><span class="font2"> “ to cover with boards,” from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hurdi<sub>t</sub> “</span><span class="font2"> hurdle ” ;&nbsp;maçon, “ the mason,” in Isidore </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">makjo</span><span class="font2"> (Frankish rather than Gothic)&nbsp;refer to house-building; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">guâcher</span><span class="font2"> from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">waskyan, broder</span><span class="font2"> from&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">*brusdan,</span><span class="font2"> point to the occupations of women, and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">danser</span><span class="font2"> from&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">dinsan</span><span class="font2"> and O. Fr. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">treschier,<sup>11</sup></span><span class="font2"> to dance,” from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">treskan,</span><span class="font2">“ to thresh,” to&nbsp;their amusements. Women's work is probably denoted further&nbsp;in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">rouir, rotfan,</span><span class="font2"> and E. Frank, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">naisier, natjan,</span><span class="font2"> <sup>11</sup> to net”;&nbsp;the same remark applies to the dyeing of cloths (Fr. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">touaille,</span><span class="font2"> Engl.&nbsp;“ towel,” from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">thwaliila),</span><span class="font2"> and ribbons </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(bande</span><span class="font2"> from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">binda)</span><span class="font2"> with&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">guede,</span><span class="font2"> “ woad,” and other colouring matters, whence we have,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">e.g., brum bleu, blond, blanc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But while the vocabulary has had its accessions drawn from various races, the proper names show the same rules as in Italian,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font2"> Frankish gains the sole supremacy. We find, it must be&nbsp;admitted, some Gothic names in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">-mir</span><span class="font2"> in the south early in the middle&nbsp;ages, but they were not maintained as late as the Romance period,&nbsp;such was the influence of the victorious northern race.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Even after political and literary independence had enabled the individual Romance languages to grow as separate units on&nbsp;their own basis, they retained their interconnexion and were open&nbsp;to mutual influence. But this influence is only partial, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font2"> it&nbsp;affects nothing but the vocabulary, and has a certain relation to&nbsp;various tendencies in the developments of civilization. And&nbsp;under this head the most important point is the really enormous influence which France (both south and north) has exercised on all the&nbsp;Romance countries, just as she has on the Germanic—an influence&nbsp;which has hitherto not been duly recognized. The first traces&nbsp;go back to the invasions of Charlemagne already mentioned. To&nbsp;instance only one, we have </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">schiavino,</span><span class="font2"> <sup>11</sup> justice, alderman,” which&nbsp;cannot be derived directly from the Germanic, as is shown by&nbsp;the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">V.</span><span class="font2"> The second important period is the age of chivalry and the&nbsp;literary tendencies centring round it. A. word like </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">budriere,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">“ baldric,” is derived from Fr. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">baudrier,</span><span class="font2"> not directly from Germanic&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Baldericli; </span><span class="font2">Ital. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">banda</span><span class="font2"> goes back to O. Fr. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">bande,</span><span class="font2"> and this again to&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">binda·,</span><span class="font2"> Ital. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">giallo</span><span class="font2"> is not from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">galbinus</span><span class="font2"> but from O. Fr. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">jalne</span><span class="font2"> (Mod.&nbsp;Fr. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">faune),</span><span class="font2"> derived from that word, &amp;c. But it seems that in one&nbsp;of the prehistoric periods the Tuscan vocabulary was strongly&nbsp;affected by that of the Gallo-Romanic. Whereas in the lberian&nbsp;peninsula, in Sardinia, in south ltaly, Rumania and Rhaetia </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">dies&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">survives, in O. Fr. has been almost completely ousted by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">four,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">but in Tuscan and the Italian literary language we find </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">giorno&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">di</span><span class="font2"> side by side. Thus </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">trouver,</span><span class="font2"> Prov. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">trobar,</span><span class="font2"> spreading from&nbsp;France into Italy, drove the old </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">afflare</span><span class="font2"> more and more back towards&nbsp;the south. The most recent layer was introduced during the reign&nbsp;of the house of Anjou chiefly in south ltaly. and Sicily, and kept&nbsp;its hold to the present day in spite of the Sicilian Vespers, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font2"> Sic.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">vuccieri,</span><span class="font2"> <sup>11</sup> butcher,” from Fr. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">boucher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The lberian peninsula can likewise bear witness as to French influence, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font2"> O. Sp. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">fonta,</span><span class="font2"> <sup>11</sup> shame,” is not from Goth, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">*haunitha,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">but from Fr. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">honte·,</span><span class="font2"> O. Port, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">saluar</span><span class="font2"> not from Lat. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">salutare,</span><span class="font2"> but&nbsp;O. Fr. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">saluer.</span><span class="font2"> On the whole, Portuguese seems to possess more&nbsp;of these Gallicisms than Spanish, history supplying a simple&nbsp;explanation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ltaly too yielded its contributions, especially in the 15th and 16th centuries, many military terms (noble and ignoble), </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font2"> French&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">carogne</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">canaille·, poignard,</span><span class="font2"> “ dagger,” from Ital. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">pugnale,</span><span class="font2"> instead&nbsp;of O. Fr. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">poigniel·,</span><span class="font2"> but also </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">panache,</span><span class="font2"> “plume,” from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">pennacchio,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">and many others that have become common property. But the&nbsp;influence of the lberian peninsula on the contrary was not so strong&nbsp;as to be more than sporadic; the Sicilian and Neapolitan vocabularies alone are more closely akin to Spanish, and. this is easily&nbsp;explained on the ground of their political and commercial relations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As to the Romance languages beyond Europe we have but little to say. There is a distinction to be made between Creole&nbsp;and genuine Romance. Belonging to the latter we have the French&nbsp;of Canada, the Spanish of Central and South America, the Portuguese of the Brazils. Speaking generally we may say that the&nbsp;particular languages retained the form of the language in .the 16th&nbsp;and 17th centuries, that is to say that of the time of the immigration, and that they developed along the lines already established.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Thus in Mexican Spanish the loss of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">d, g,</span><span class="font2"> between vowels, of 5 before consonants and as a final, has been carried further than in the&nbsp;mother-country. There are no proved traces of any noticeable&nbsp;influence from the languages of the natives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Literature.</span><span class="font2">—The real founder of scientific Romance philology and linguistics is Friedrich Diez, in his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Grammatik der romanischen&nbsp;Sprachen</span><span class="font2"> (3 vols., Bonn, 1836-42), and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Etymologisches Wörterbuch&nbsp;der romanischen Sprachen</span><span class="font2"> (2 vols.., 1852). All questions concerning&nbsp;Romance philology and the historic grammar of the different&nbsp;Romance languages are treated in G. Gröber's </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Grundriss der romanischen Philologie</span><span class="font2"> (2nd ed.,Strassburg, ioo6),and in W. Meyer-Lübke's&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Grammatik der romanischen Sprachen</span><span class="font2"> (4 vols., Leipzig, 1890-1900);&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Einführung in die romanische Sprachwissenschaft</span><span class="font2"> (2nd ed., Heidelberg, 1909). The principal magazines devoted to the subject are </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Zeitschrift fiir romanische Philologie</span><span class="font2"> (ed. Gröber; since 1877) ; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Zeitschrift&nbsp;für neufranzösische Sprache und Literatur</span><span class="font2"> (ed. Behrens; since&nbsp;1879); </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Romanische Forschungen</span><span class="font2"> (ed. Vollmöller; since 1885);&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Archiv für das Studium der neueren Sprachen</span><span class="font2"> (since 1846); </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Romania&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">(ed. G. Paris and P. Meyer; since 1812); </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Archivio glottologico&nbsp;italiano</span><span class="font2"> (ed. G. </span><span class="font1">1. </span><span class="font2">Ascoli; since 1873). The great development&nbsp;of Romanic philology after Diez is due principally to A. Tobler,&nbsp;G. Gröber, W. Förster and H. Suchier in Germany; A. Mussafia&nbsp;(d. 1905), H. Schuchardt in Austria; G. Paris (d. 1905), P. Meyer&nbsp;in France; G. I. Ascoli (d. 1907), and F. d’Ovidio in Italy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(W. M.-L.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ROMAN DE LA ROSE, a French poem dating from the 13th century. The first part was written about 1230 by Guillaume&nbsp;de Lorris </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.),</span><span class="font2"> whose work formed the starting-point, about&nbsp;forty years later, for the more extensive section written by&nbsp;Jean de Meun </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.).</span><span class="font2"> Guillaume de Lorris wrote an aIlcgorx<sup>r</sup>,&nbsp;possibly of an adventure of his own, which is an artistic and&nbsp;beautiful presentment of the Iove philosophy of the troubadours. In a dream the Lover visits a park to which he is&nbsp;admitted by Idleness. In the park he finds Pleasure, Delight,&nbsp;Cupid and other personages, and at length the Rose. Welcome&nbsp;grants him permission to kiss the Rose, but he is driven away&nbsp;by Danger, Shame, Scandal, and especially by Jealousy, who&nbsp;entrenches the Rose and imprisons XVelcome, leaving the Lover&nbsp;disconsolate. The story, thus left incomplete by its inventor,&nbsp;was finished in 19,000 lines by Jean de Meun, who allows the&nbsp;Lover to win the Rose, but only after a long siege and much&nbsp;discourse from Reason, the Friend, Nature and Genius. In&nbsp;the second part, however, the story is entirely subsidiary to&nbsp;the display of the author’s encyclopaedic knowledge, to picturesque and poetic digressions, and to violent satire in the&nbsp;manner of the fabliaux against the abuse of power, against&nbsp;women, against popular superstition, and against the celibacy&nbsp;of the clergy. The length of the work and its heterogeneous&nbsp;character proved no bar to its enormous popularity in the&nbsp;middle ages, attested by the 200 MSS. of it which have survived.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Romaunt of the Rose</span><span class="font2"> was translated into English by Chaucer (see the prologue to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Legende of Good Women),</span><span class="font2"> but the English&nbsp;version of that, extending to about one-third of the whole work,&nbsp;which has come down to us (see an edition by Dr Max Kaluza,&nbsp;Chaucer Society, 1891), is generally admitted to be by another hand.&nbsp;For a list of books on the vexed question of the authorship of&nbsp;the English translation see G. Körting, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Grundriss der engl. Lit.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">(Münster, 1905, 4th ed. p. 184). A Flemish version by Hein van&nbsp;Aken appeared during Jean de Meun’s lifetime, and at the beginning&nbsp;of the 14th century a free imitation, in the form of a series of sonnets,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Il Fiore,</span><span class="font2"> was written in Italian by the Tuscan poet Durante. Three&nbsp;editions of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Roman de la Rose</span><span class="font2"> were printed at Lyons between&nbsp;1473 and 1490; two by Antoine Verard (Paris, 1490 ? and 1496 ?),&nbsp;by Jean du Pré (Paris, 1493 ?), by Nicholas Desprez for Jean Petit&nbsp;(Paris), by Michel Ie Noir (Paris, 1509 and 1519). ln 1503 Jean&nbsp;Molinet produced a prose version. Marot altered and modernized&nbsp;the text (1526), and his corrections were followed in subsequent&nbsp;editions. Modern editions are by Méon (4 vols., 1813), by Francisque&nbsp;Michel (2 vols., 1864), by Croissandeau (pseudonym for Pierre&nbsp;Marteau), with a translation into modern French (Orleans, 5 vols.,&nbsp;1878-80), and a critical edition by E. Langlois, author of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Origines&nbsp;et sources du Roman de la Rose</span><span class="font2"> (Paris, 1890). There is a modern&nbsp;English version by F. S. Ellis (Temple Classics, 3 vols., 1900).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ROMAN EMPIRE, LATER. The reign of Constantine the Great forms the most deep-reaching division in the history&nbsp;of Europe. The external continuity is not broken, but the&nbsp;principles which guided society in the Greek and Roman world&nbsp;are replaced by a new order of ideas. The emperor-worship,&nbsp;which expressed a belief in the ideal of the earthly empire of&nbsp;Rome, gives way to Christianity; this is the outward sign that</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
