                exact site is doubtful, but some existing foundations near the foot of the
                Aven-tine, near the Mariuoratum, may have been the supports of its&nbsp;wooden
                piers. The first stone bridge was completed in 142 b.c.,&nbsp;when the conquest of
                Etruria and the defeat ot Hannibal had put&nbsp;an end to fears of invasion ; it was
                called the Pons Æmilius,&nbsp;after the pontifex nιaximus @@<sup>2</sup> DI. Æmilius
                Lepidus, its founder. It&nbsp;was also called Pons Lapideus to distinguish it from
                the wooden&nbsp;Sublician bridge. The modern Ponte Rotto is on the site of this
                ;&nbsp;but the existing three arches are mediæval. An ancient basalt-paved&nbsp;road
                still exists, leading to the bridge from the Forum Boarium.&nbsp;The Pons Fabricius
                unites the city and the island (Insula Tiber-ina) ; Livy (ii. 5) gives the fable of
                the formation of this island&nbsp;from the Tarquin com, cut from the Campus Martius
                and thrown&nbsp;into the river. The bridge derived its name from L. Fabricius,
                a&nbsp;curator viarum in 62 B.c.; its inscription, twice repeated, is </span><span

                peperino and&nbsp;tufa, with a massive facing of travertine on both sides. Corbels
                to&nbsp;support centering were built in near the springing of the arches,&nbsp;so
                that they could be repaired or even rebuilt without a scaffolding&nbsp;erected in
                the river-bed. The well-preserved Pons Cestius, probably named after L. Cestius,
                præfectus urbi in 46 B.c., unites the&nbsp;island and the Janiculan side ; on the
                marble parapet is a long inscription recording its restoration in 370 by Gratian,
                Valentinian,&nbsp;and Valens. The next bridge, Ponte Sisto, is probably on the
                site&nbsp;of an ancient bridge called in the </span><span class="font1"

                the&nbsp;time of Hadrian. The Pons Ælius was built in 135 by Hadrian to&nbsp;connect
                his mausoleum with the Campus Martius ; it is still well&nbsp;preserved, and is now
                called the Ponte S. Angelo (see Dante, </span><span class="font1"

                than 12 miles in circuit, were mainly built to enclose the regiones of Augus-tus,
                the greater part of which were then thickly inhabited. This</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">enormous work was begun in 271, to defend Rome against sudden attacks
                of the Germans and other northern races when the great&nbsp;armies of Rome were
                fighting in distant countries.@@<sup>5</sup> After&quot; the&nbsp;death of Aurelian
                the walls were completed by Probus in 280, and&nbsp;about a century later they were
                restored and strengthened by the&nbsp;addition of gate-towers under Arcadius and
                Honorius (395-425),&nbsp;in place of the earlier gateways of Aurelian ; this is
                recorded by&nbsp;existing inscriptions on several of the gates.@@<sup>6</sup> At
                many periods&nbsp;these walls suffered much from the attacks of the Goths
                (Procop.,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bell.
                Goih.,</span><span class="font1"> iii. 22, 24), and were restored successively by
                Theodoric&nbsp;(about 500), by Belisarius (about 560), and by various popes
                during&nbsp;the 8th and 9th centuries, and in fact all through the Middle
                Ages.&nbsp;A great part of the Aurelian wall still exists in a more or less
                perfect&nbsp;state ; but it has wholly vanished where it skirted the river, and
                a&nbsp;great part of its trans-Tiberine course is gone. The most perfect&nbsp;piece
                is that in the gardens of the Villa Ludovisi. Other well-preserved pieces are by the
                Porta Appia, and between the Lateran&nbsp;and the Amphitheatrum Castrense. The wall,
                of concrete, has the&nbsp;usual brick-facing and is about 12 feet thick, with a
                guards’ passage&nbsp;formed in its thickness. Fig. 25 shows its plan : on the inside
                the</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">passage has tall open arches, which look like those of an aqueduct,
                and at regular intervals of about 45 feet massive square towers are&nbsp;built,
                projecting on the outside of the wall, in three stories, the top&nbsp;story rising
                above the top of the wall. The height of the wall varies&nbsp;according to the
                contour of the ground ; in parts it was about 60&nbsp;feet high outside and 40
                inside. Necessaria, supported on two&nbsp;travertine corbels, projected from the top
                of the wall on the outside&nbsp;beside most of the towers. The Einsiedeln MS. gives
                a description&nbsp;of the complete circuit, counting all the gates, fourteen in
                number,&nbsp;as follows :—</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Porta S. Petri (destroyed) ; P. Flaminia (in use) ; P. Pinciana
                (closed); P. Salaria (destroyed in 1870); P. Nomentana (closed) ;&nbsp;P. Tiburtina
                (in use, now called P. S. Lorenzo) ; P. Prænestina (in&nbsp;use, now Porta Maggiore)
                ; P. Asinaria (closed) ; P. DIetrovia&nbsp;(closed) ; P. Latina (closed) ; P. Appia
                (in use, now called P. S.&nbsp;Sebastiano) ; P. Ostiensis (in use, now P. S. Paolo).
                On the Jani-culan side, P. Portensis (destroyed) ; P. Aurelia (in use). One
                gate,&nbsp;known as the P. Chiusa, is omitted in this list, owing to its
                being&nbsp;blocked up in the time of the Einsiedeln writer. Its ancient name&nbsp;is
                not known.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">These existing gates are mostly of the time of Honorius ; each is
                flanked by a projecting tower, and some are double, with a second&nbsp;pair of
                towers inside. Several have grooves for a portcullis </span><span class="font1"

                stages high, the upper semicircular in plan. DIany of the gates of Honorius have
                Christian&nbsp;symbols or inscriptions. The general design of all these gates
                is&nbsp;much the same,—a central archway, with a row of windows over it&nbsp;and two
                flanking towers, some square, others semicircular in plan.&nbsp;In many of the gates
                older materials are used, blocks of tufa, travertine, or marble. The doors
                themselves swung on pivots, the bottom&nbsp;ones let into a hole in the threshold,
                the upper into projecting&nbsp;corbels.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">At many points along the line of the Aurelian wall older buildings
                form part of the circuit,—near the Porta Asinaria a large piece of the Domus

                basilica, and a little farther on, by S. Croce in&nbsp;Gerusalemme, the
