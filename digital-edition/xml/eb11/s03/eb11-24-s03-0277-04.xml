S. A., on the North Branch of the Susquehanna river, about 95 m. (by rail) N.N.W. of Wilkes-Barr√©, and just S. of the New York state boundary. Pop. (1900) 5243 (337 foreign-born); (1910) 6426. Sayre is served by the main line and by a branch of the Lehigh Valley railway, and is connected by electric railway with Waverly, New York, and with the adjacent borough of Athens, Pennsylvania (pop. in 1910, 3796), which manufactures furniture, carriages and wagons. Sayre, Athens, South Waverly and Waverly form virtually one industrial community. The borough of Sayre is the seat of the Robert Packer Hospital (1885) and has two parks. It is the trade centre of an agricultural and dairying region, and has metal works and other factories; but its industrial importance is due primarily to the locomotive and car shops of the Lehigh Valley railway. It was named in honour of Robert Heysham Sayre (1824-1907), long chief-engineer of this railway. Sayre was settled in 1880 and was incorporated as a borough in 1891.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
