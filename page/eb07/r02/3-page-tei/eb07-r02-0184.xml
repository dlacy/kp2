The produce of secondary importance is fruit, potatoes, flax, seeds, and oleaginous vegetables, dye-woods, and barks of the cork and other trees, potash, soda, hay, mulberry-trees, aniseed, &amp;c. The main agricultural products are cattle, both large and small, with their secondary productions, such as wool, cheese, butter, hides, bacon, &amp;c.; silks, wax, honey, tallow, horns and bones, parchment, &amp;c. Buffalos, goats, mules, and other animals for carriage, are found, but not in large numbers. Domestic fowls, and game of all sorts, are in abundance.</p><p>The cultivation of rice, vegetables, potatoes, hemp, olives, mulberry-trees, silk worms, horned cattle and sheep, with cheese and wool, is on the increase, while, on the contrary, corn, firewood, charcoal, wood, pine-kernels, horses, and the salted sardinias of the Adriatic are diminishing. The fishing-trade generally is declining or almost extinct. Other produce is nearly stationary.</p><p>With respect to the mineral productions of the Pontifical</p><p>States, but little information can be given. They possess excellent earths, argillaceous and others, fit for various manufactures, and especially for earthenware. Pozzolano is found at Rome and elsewhere; travertine, peperine, and other building stones, at Tivoli, Albano, &amp;c. Millstones, siliceous and fire-stones, fuller’s earth, alabaster, are also found. In some parts are marbles, variegated and sculp-tuary. Rock crystals are found at Tolfa, and elsewhere. They produce also salts and bitumens, alum, vitriol, fossil coal, pitch and naphtha. They have no fossil, but abundance of marine salt, the annual produce of which is 76,000,000 lbs. There are many salt-springs in Romagna and the frontiers, and abundance of salubrious mineral springs, both hot and cold. Of metals there are indices of gold and silver in various places, but the quantities are small. Iron ore is believed to exist in the territory of Terni, Viterbo, Bologna, and elsewhere, but no sufficient trial has been made to enable a correct estimate to be formed of the probable produce. Copper ores, quicksilver, marcasite and lead, have also been found. Pozzo-lana is employed for subaquatic works, and is exported to some extent. The Viterbo vitriol mines produce more than 100,000 lbs., one-half of which is exported. There are many mines of fossil coal, which were worked with great success, and the coal was found most abundant and excellent, but they have of late been utterly neglected. About four million lbs. of sulphur are dug in Romagna, Pesaro, and Tor-mignano. The government works only the alum mines, all the rest are private undertakings.</p><p>Roman agriculture is by no means in a flourishing state. Most of the lands in the Agro Romano, and generally in the Maremme, extending from the confines of Tuscany to those of Naples, are divided into large properties. The extent varies much, some containing no less than 8000 hectares, and others not exceeding a few hundred hectares ; but, generally speaking, the landed properties vary from 500 to 1000 hectares. All the tract of country from the Apennines to the Mediterranean, with the exception of the suburban districts near the towns and villages, is divided into possessions of considerable size. But the number of wealthy proprietors is very small, perhaps there are not twenty landholders of ample fortune. The great majority of them are poor, a few of them are tolerably well off, but the opulent are rare indeed. The value of land is almost infinitely various; the rent in the Maremme varies from a half to four crowns per hectare. Beyond the Maremme it is sometimes let at twenty crowns per hectare (L.4) per annum, and in some cases the rental exceeds that sum. Lands do not ordinarily render more than two and a-half or three per cent. In the neighbourhood of the large towns of the State, land readily sells for forty years’ purchase. The agricultural labourers are grossly ignorant, and they have no means of acquiring education, though they are neither indolent nor unwilling to better their condition. They in general live badly, using, for the most part, maize bread and <hi rend="italic">polenta, </hi>beans and pulse, and other vegetables, but they seldom are able to obtain animal food. In winter their beverage isjoιc-<hi rend="italic">chetta,</hi>  a mixture of wine and water, and in summer wine alone. In the populous districts, wages vary from one to two pauls (5d. to l0d.) and in the Maremme from two to four pauls per day, according to the employment, the season, and the locality.</p><p>In the most populous and best cultivated districts, there is usually an annual change from spring grasses to corn produce, but in the Maremme the soil is often left to repose for from three to seven years. No operations on a large scale can be carried on there in summer, owing to the state of the climate. In the summer season, the animals are driven</p><p>@@@<hi rend="sup">1</hi>  The Tavola censuale = 1,000 square metres ; so that 39,985,235 T. □ C. = 11,632,745 miles □ Italian, of 60 to the degree.</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
