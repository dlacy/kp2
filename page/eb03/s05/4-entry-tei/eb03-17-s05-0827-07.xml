a philoſopher oſ Lampſacus, diſciple and ſucceſſor in the ſchool of Theophraſtus, about 248 years before the Chriſtian era. He applied himself with uncommon induſtry to the ſtudy of nature ; and aſter the moſt mature inveſtigations, he ſupported that nature was inanimate, and that there was no god but nature. (See <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Plastic</hi> <hi rend="italic">Nature).</hi> He was appointed preceptor to Ptolemy Philadelphus, who not only revered his abilities and learning, but alſo rewarded his labours with unbounded liberality. He wrote different treatiſes, all now lost.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
