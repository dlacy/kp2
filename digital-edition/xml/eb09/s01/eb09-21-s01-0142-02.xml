The Sadducees were essentially a political party opposed to the Pharisees or party of the Scribes, and their position and history have therefore already been discussed in Israel, vol. xiii. p. 424 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi> The common view that Sadducaeism was essentially a philosophico-religious school is due partly to Josephus but mainly to later Jewish tradition, which never could realize the difference between a nation and a sect, and fancied that the whole history of Israel was made up of such scholastic controversies as engrossed the attention of later times. The theological tenets of the Sadducees as they appear in the New Testament and in Josephus had a purely political basis. They detested the doctrine of the resurrection and the fatalism of the Pharisees because these opinions were used by their adversaries to thwart their political aims. The aristocracy suffered a great loss of position through the subjection of Judsea to a foreign power; but it was useless to urge political schemes of emancipation on those who believed with the Pharisees that Israel’s task was to endure in patience till Jehovah redeemed the nation, and the resurrection rewarded those who had lived and died in bondage. In matters of ritual the Sadducees were naturally conservative, and their opposition to the unwritten traditions, from which they appealed to Scripture, is simply one phase of their opposition to Pharisaic innovations; for the traditions were the invention of the Pharisees and the written law represented old practice. When the Sadducees had lost all political importance their opposition to Pharisaism necessarily became more and more an affair of the schools rather than of practical life, but the Sadducees of the schools are only the last survival of what had once been a great political party.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
