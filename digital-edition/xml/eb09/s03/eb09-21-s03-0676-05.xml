The Eastern and Western Churches celebrate the martyrs Sergius and Bacchus, Roman officers who suffered under Maximian, on 7th October. Both were martyred in Syria, Sergius at Rosáfa (Rasíftá, Roṣáfat Hishám) near Rakka. Sergius was a very famous saint in Syria and Christian Arabia (comp. what is related of Chosroes II. in vol. xviii. p. 614); and Rosáfa, which became a bishop’s see (Le Quien, <hi rend="italic">Or. Chr.,</hi> ii. 951), took the name of Sergiopolis, and preserved his relics in a fortified basilica. The church was adorned and the place further strengthened by Justinian (Procopius, <hi rend="italic">Æd.,</hi> ii. 9).</p></div></body></text></TEI>
