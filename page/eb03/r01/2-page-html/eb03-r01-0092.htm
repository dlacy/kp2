<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">adequate ideas and notions of every </span><span class="font1">object </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">in which </span><span class="font2">they were intereſted, brought all their organs, external&nbsp;and internal, at once to their utmoſt poſſible ſtate of perfection ; taught them inſtantaneouſly the laws of reaſon-ing ; and, in one word, ſtored their minds with every&nbsp;branch of uſeful knowledge ? This is indeed our own&nbsp;opinion ; and it is perfectly agreeable to what we are&nbsp;taught by the Hebrew lawgiver. when God had&nbsp;formed Adam and Eve, Moſes does not ſay that he&nbsp;leſt them to acquire by flow degrees the ufe of their&nbsp;ſenfes and reaſoning powers, and to diſtinguiſh as they&nbsp;could fruits that were ſalutary from thoſe that were&nbsp;poiſonous. No : he placed them in a garden where&nbsp;every tree but one bore fruit fit for food ; he warned&nbsp;them particulaιly againſt the fruit of that tree; he&nbsp;brought before them the various animals which roamed&nbsp;through the garden ; he arranged theſe animals into&nbsp;their proper genera and ſpeciee ; and by teaching Adam&nbsp;to give them names, he communicated to the </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">firſt </span><span class="font2">pair&nbsp;the elements of language. This condeſcenſion appears&nbsp;in every reſpect worthy of perfect benevolence ; and&nbsp;indeed without it the helpleſs man and woman could&nbsp;not have lived one whole week. But it cannot be ſup-poſed, that amidſt ſo much uſeful inſtruction the gra-cious Creator would neglect to communicate to his rational creatures the knowledge of himſelf ; to inform&nbsp;them of their own origin, and the relation in which&nbsp;they ſtood to him ; and to ſtate in the plaineſt terms&nbsp;the duties incumbent on them in return for fo much&nbsp;goodnefs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In what manner all this knowledge was communica-±ed, cannot be certainly known. It may have been in either of the following ways conceivable by us, or in&nbsp;others of which we can form no conception. God may&nbsp;have miraculouſly ſtored the minds of the ſirſt pair with&nbsp;adequate ideas and notions of ſenſible and intellectual&nbsp;objects ; and then by an internal operation of his own&nbsp;Spirit have enabled them to exert at once their rational&nbsp;faculties ſo as to difcover his exiſtence and attributes,&nbsp;together with the relation in which as creatures they&nbsp;ſtood to him their Almighty Creator. Ον, after rendering them capable of diſtinguiſhing objects by means&nbsp;of their ſenſes, of comparing their ideas, and underſtand-ing a language, he may have exhibited himtelt under&nbsp;ſome ſenſible emblem, and conducted them by degrees&nbsp;from one branch of knowledge to another, as a tehool-maſter conducts his pupilβ, till they were ſufficiently&nbsp;acquainted with every thing relating to their own happinefs and duty as rational, moral, and religious, creatures. In determining the queſtion before us, it is of&nbsp;no importance whether infinite wiſdom adopted either&nbsp;of theſe methods, or fome other different from them,&nbsp;both which we cannot conceive. The ordinary proceſs&nbsp;in which men acquire knowledge is, by the laws of their&nbsp;nature, extremely tedious. They cannot reafon before&nbsp;their minds be ſtored with ideas and notions ; and they&nbsp;cannot acquire theſe but through the medium of their&nbsp;ſenſes long exerciſed on external objects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The progenitors of the human race, left to inform themſelves by this proceſs, muſt have inevitably periſhed&nbsp;before they had acquired one diſtinct notion ; and it is&nbsp;the fame thing with reſpect to the origin of religion,&nbsp;whether God preferved them from deſtruction </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">by </span><span class="font2">aa&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">internal</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">external</span><span class="font2"> revelation. If he ſtored their minds&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">at once with the rudiments of all uſeful knowledge, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">rendered </span><span class="font3">them </span><span class="font2">capable of exerting </span><span class="font1">thcir rational facul</span><span class="font2">ties, ſo as, by tracing effects to their cauſes, to diſcover his being and attributes, he </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">revealed</span><span class="font2"> himſelf to them as&nbsp;certainly as he did afterwards to Moſes, when to </span><span class="font1">him he&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">condeſcended to fpeak face to face.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If this reaſoning be admitted as fair and concluſive, and wc apprehend that thc principles on which it proceeds cannot be conſidered as ill-founded, we have advanced ſo far as to prove that mankind muſt have been&nbsp;originally enlightened by a revelation. But it is ſcarce&nbsp;neceſſary to obſerve, that this revelation mnſt have been&nbsp;handed down through ſucceeding generations. It&nbsp;could not fail to reach the era of the deluge. It is not&nbsp;abfurd to ſuppoſe, that he who ſpake from heaven to&nbsp;Adam, ſpake alſo to Noah. And both the revelation&nbsp;which had been handed down to the poſtdeluvian patriarch by tradition, and that which was communicated&nbsp;immediately to himſelf, would be by him made known&nbsp;to his deſcendants. Thus it appears almoſt impoſſible&nbsp;that ſome part of the religious ſentiments of mankind&nbsp;ſhould not have been derived from revelation ; and that&nbsp;not of the religious ſentiments of one particular family&nbsp;or tribe, but of almoſt all the nations of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This concluſion, which we have deduced by fair rea-ſoning from the benevolence of God and the nature of man, is confirmed by the authority of the Jewiſh and&nbsp;Chriſtian Scriptures, which are entitled to more implicit credit than all the other records of ancient hiſ-tory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">when we review the internal and external evidence of the authenticity of thefe ſacred books, we cannot for&nbsp;a moment hefitate to receive them as the genuine </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">word&nbsp;oſ God.</span><span class="font2"> If we examine their internal character, they&nbsp;everywhere appear to be indeed the voice of Heaven.&nbsp;The creation of the world—-the manner in which this&nbsp;globe was ſirſt peopled—the deluge which ſwept away&nbsp;its inhabitants—the ſucceeding views of the ſtate of&nbsp;mankind in the next ages after the deluge—the calling&nbsp;of Abraham—the legiſlation of Moſes—the whole fe-ries of events which befel the Jewiſh nation—the prophecies—the appearance of Jeſus Chriſt, and the promulgation of his goſpel, as explained to us in the Scrip-tureβ—form one ſeries, which is, in the higheſt degree,&nbsp;illuſtrative of the power, wiſdom, and goodnefs of the&nbsp;Supreme Being.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">while it muſt be allowed that the human mind is ever prone to debate the ſublime principles of true religion by enthuſiaſm and ſnperſtition, reaſon and can-dour will not for a moment heſitate to acknowledge, that&nbsp;the whole ſyſtem of revelation repretents the Supreme&nbsp;Being in the moſt fublime and amiable light : that, in&nbsp;it, religion appears effentially connected with morality :&nbsp;that the legiilative code of Motes was ſuch as no legiſ-lator ever formed and eſtabliſhed among a people e-qually rude and uncultivated : that the manners and&nbsp;morals of the Jews, vicious and ſavage as they may in&nbsp;ſome inſtances appear, yet merit a much higher character than thoſe either of their neighbours, or of almoſt&nbsp;any other nation, whofe circumſtances and character&nbsp;were in other reſpects ſimilar to theirs : that there is an&nbsp;infinite difference between the Scripture prophecies and&nbsp;the oracles and predictions which prevailed among hea-then nations : and that the miracles recorded in thofe&nbsp;writings which we eſteem ſacred were attended with&nbsp;circumſtances which entitle them to be ranked in a very</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
