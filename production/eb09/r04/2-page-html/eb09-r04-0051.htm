<p><span class="font1">the Polish rebellion of 1863 by Berg, published in 1873, which gave many startling and picturesque episodes of&nbsp;this celebrated struggle, has now been withdrawn from&nbsp;circulation. It appeared originally in the pages of the&nbsp;Russian magazine, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Starina.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Since the death of Lermontoff the chief Russian poet who has appeared is Nicholas Nekrasoff, who died in 1877.&nbsp;He has left six volumes of poetry, which in many respects&nbsp;remind us of the writings of Crabbe; the poet dwells&nbsp;mainly upon the melancholy features of Russian life. He&nbsp;is of that realistic school in which Russian authors so much&nbsp;resemble English. Another writer of poetry deserving&nbsp;mention is Ogarieff, for a long time the companion in&nbsp;exile of Herzen in England; many of his compositions&nbsp;appeared in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Polar Star</span><span class="font1"> of the latter, a medley of&nbsp;prose and verse, which contains some very important&nbsp;papers, including the interesting autobiographical sketches&nbsp;of Herzen, entitled </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Biloe i Dumi</span><span class="font1"> (“The Past and my&nbsp;Thoughts”). Alaikoff at one time enjoyed great popularity as a poet ; he is a kind of link between the present&nbsp;generation and that of Pushkin, of whose elegance of&nbsp;versification he is somewhat of an imitator. Another poet&nbsp;of a past generation was Prince Viazemski, &quot;whose works&nbsp;are now being collected. Graceful lyrics have also been&nbsp;written by Mei, Fet (whose name would apparently prove&nbsp;Dutch extraction, Veth), Stcherbina, and, going a little&nbsp;farther back, Yazikoff, the friend of Pushkin, and Khomi-akoff, celebrated for his Slavophile propensities. To these&nbsp;may be added Mdlle Zhadovskaia, who died a short time&nbsp;ago, Benediktoff, Podolinski, and Tiutcheff. It will be&nbsp;seen that in Russia (as in England) lyrical poetry is almost&nbsp;the only form now cultivated. It is becoming more and&nbsp;more coloured with imitations of the bilini and reproductions of the old Russian past, which is perhaps getting&nbsp;treated somewhat fantastically, as was the old Irish life in&nbsp;the Irish melodies of Moore. Occasionally Polonski contributes one of his exquisite lyrics to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Viestnik Yevropi&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(“European Messenger”).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Excellent works on subjects connected with Slavonic philology have been published by Vostokoff, who edited the&nbsp;Ostromir Codex, mentioned above (p. 103), and Sreznevski&nbsp;and Bodianski, who put forth an edition of the celebrated&nbsp;codex used at Rheims for the coronation of the French&nbsp;kings. Since their deaths their work has been carried&nbsp;on by Prof. Grote </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Philological Investigations,</span><span class="font1"> also many&nbsp;critical editions of Russian classics). Budilovich, now a&nbsp;professor at Warsaw, Potebnya of Kharkoff, and Baudoin&nbsp;de Courtenay, -who, among other services to philology, has&nbsp;described the Slavonic dialect spoken by the Resanians, a&nbsp;tribe living in Italy, in two villages of the Julian Alps.&nbsp;The songs (bilini) of the Russians have been collected by&nbsp;Zakrevski, Ribnikoff, Hilferding, Barsoff, and others, and&nbsp;their national tales by Sakharoff, Afanasieff, and Erlen-vein. Kotliarevski, Tereshenko, and others have treated of&nbsp;their customs and superstitions, but it is to be regretted&nbsp;that no one as yet has made a complete study of the&nbsp;vexed question of Slavonic mythology. At the present&nbsp;time Stanislaus Alikutzki, professor, at the university of Warsaw, is publishing his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Materials for a Dictionary of&nbsp;the Roots of the Russian and all Slavonic Dialects,</span><span class="font1"> but,&nbsp;unfortunately, it represents a somewhat obsolete school of&nbsp;philology. The Early Russian Text Society continues its&nbsp;useful labours, and has edited many interesting monuments of the older Slavonic literature. Quite recently&nbsp;two valuable codices have been printed in Russia, Zogra-phus and Marianus, interesting versions of the Gospels in&nbsp;Palaeoslavonic. They were edited by the learned Croat&nbsp;Jagid, who now occupies the chair of Sreznevski in St&nbsp;Petersburg. An excellent </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tolkovi Slovar Velikorusskago&nbsp;Yazika</span><span class="font1"> (“ Explanatory Dictionary of the Great Russian</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Language”), by Dahl, has gone into a second edition. Alexander Hilferding published some valuable works&nbsp;on ethnology and philology, among others on the Polabes,&nbsp;an extinct Slavonic tribe who once dwelt on the banks of&nbsp;the Elbe. Although they have produced some good Slavonic scholars, the Russians have not exhibited many&nbsp;works in the field of classical or other branches of philology. Exception, however, must be made in favour of the&nbsp;studies of Tchubinoff in Georgian, Minayeff in the Indian,&nbsp;and Tzvetayeff in the old languages of Italy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In moral and mental philosophy the Russians have produced but few authors. We meet with some good mathematicians, Ostrogradski among others, and in natural science the publications of the Society for Natural History&nbsp;at Moscow have attracted considerable attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Since the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Boris Godunoff</span><span class="font1"> of Pushkin, which was the first attempt in Russia to produce a play on the Shakespearian model, many others have appeared in the same&nbsp;style. A fine trilogy was composed by Count A. Tolstoi&nbsp;on the three subjects, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Death of Ivan the Terrible&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(1866), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Czar Feodor</span><span class="font1"> (1868), and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Czar Boris&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(1869). Other plays of merit have been written by&nbsp;Ostrovski and Potiekhin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Many excellent literary journals and magazines make their appearance in the country ; among these may&nbsp;especially be mentioned the time-honoured </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Viestnik Yevropi&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(“Messenger of Europe”), which contains some of the&nbsp;most brilliant writing produced in the Russian empire.&nbsp;The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Istoricheski Viestnik</span><span class="font1"> (“Historical Messenger”) is full&nbsp;of curious matter, and does not confine itself merely to&nbsp;Russian subjects. It is edited by M. Shubinski, the&nbsp;author of some pleasant sketches on the manners of&nbsp;Russia in the old time. On the contrary </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Starina</span><span class="font1"> (the&nbsp;“Antiquary,” if we may so freely translate the original&nbsp;name) is entirely Russian, and is a valuable repertory of&nbsp;documents concerning the history of the country, and&nbsp;memoirs, especially relating to the latter part of the 17th&nbsp;century. The highly interesting magazine </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Drevnaia i&nbsp;Novaia Rossia</span><span class="font1"> did not protract its existence beyond six&nbsp;years, having come to an end in 1881. Many of the best&nbsp;Russian writers contributed to it; it contains much valuable&nbsp;material for the student of history. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Russkii Arkhiv&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">is edited by M. Bartenieff, and has long been celebrated ;&nbsp;some of the most important notes on Russian history&nbsp;of the 18th and 19th century have appeared in this&nbsp;journal. During the last few years extensive excavations have been made in many parts of Russia, and much&nbsp;has been done to throw light upon the prehistoric period&nbsp;of the country. A large “ kurgan,” called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cherna Mogila,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">or the Black Grave, was opened by Samokvasoff in the&nbsp;government of Tchernigoff and described in the pages of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Old&nbsp;and New Russia.</span><span class="font1"> Explorations have been carried on on&nbsp;the site of Bolgari, the ancient capital of the Ugrian&nbsp;Bolgars on the Volga. One of the most active workers in&nbsp;this field was the late Count Uvaroff (d. 1884), who published a valuable monograph on the Stone Age in Russia,&nbsp;and many other important works.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A few words must be said on the literature of the Russian dialects, the Little and White Russian. The Little Russian is&nbsp;rich in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">skazki</span><span class="font0"> (tales) and songs. Peculiar to them is the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">duma,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">a narrative poem which corresponds in many particulars with the&nbsp;Russian bilina. Since the commencement of the present century,&nbsp;when curiosity was first aroused on the subject of national poetry,&nbsp;the Little Russian </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">dumî</span><span class="font0"> have been repeatedly edited, as by&nbsp;Maksimovich Metlinski and others. An elaborate edition (far&nbsp;surpassing the earlier ones) was commenced by Dragomanoff&nbsp;and Antonovich, but as yet only one volume and a portion of a&nbsp;second have made their appearance. Just as the bilini- of the&nbsp;Great Russians, so also these dumi of the Little Russians admit&nbsp;of classification, and they have been divided by their latest editors&nbsp;as follows (1) the songs of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">druzhina,</span><span class="font0"> treating of the early&nbsp;princes and their followers ; (2) the Cossack period </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Kozaehxstvo),&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">in which the Cossacks are found in continual warfare with the</span></p>
