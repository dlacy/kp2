The main body was brought up by Edward in perſon, attended by Aymer de Valence earl of Pembroke, and Sir Giles d’Argentine, two experienced commanders. Maurice abbot of Inchaſſray, placing himſelf on an eminence, celebratcd maſs in the fight of the Scottiſh army. He then paſſed along the front, barefooted, with a crucifix in his hands, and in few words exhorted the Scots to fight for their rights and liberty. The Scots fell down on their knees; which being perceived by Edward, he cried out, “They yield! See, they implore mercy” “They do,” anſwered Umfraville, one of his commanders, “they do implore mercy, but not from us. On that field they will be victorious or die.”</p><p>As both parties were violently exaſperated againſt each other, the engagement began with great fury. The king of Scotland, perceiving that his troops were grievouſly annoyed by the Engliſh archers, ordered Sir Robert Keith the mariſchal, with a few armed horſemen, to make a circuit and attack the archers in flank. This was inſtantly accompliſhed; and as the weapons of the archers were uſeleſs in a cloſe encounter, they could make very little reſiſtance, at the ſame time that their flight ſpread diſorder through the whole army.</p><p>Robert now advanced with the reſerve: the whole Engliſh army was in the utmoſt confuſion; for the defeat of the archers had decided the victory in favour of the Scots. The young and gallant earl of Glouceſter attempted to rally the fugitives, but was thrown from his horſe, and cut in pieces, which increaſed the general confuſion. At this critical moment, the numerous attendants on the Scottiſh camp, prompted by curioſity or the deſire of plunder, iſſued from their retirement. The Engliſh miſtook them for a body of freſh troops coming to the aſſiſtance of their enemies, and fled with precipitation on all ſides. Many ſought refuge among the rocks in the neighbourhood of Stirling caſtle, and many were drowned in the rivers. Pembroke and Sir Giles d’Argentine had never quitted Edward during the action; but now, ſeeing the battle irretrievably loſt, Pembroke conſtrained the king to quit the field. D’Argentine refuſed to fly. He was a man of great valour, and had a high reputation in Scotland. According to the vulgar opinion, the three moſt eminent worthies in that age were the emperor Henry of Luxemburg, Robert Bruce, and Giles d’Argentine. He is laid to have thrice encountered two Saracen warriors in Paleſtine, and to have killed them both each time. His valour now availed him but little; for ruſhing into the midſt of the Scots army, he was inſtantly cut in pieces. Douglas, with 60 horſemen, purſued Edward cloſe. At the Torwood he met Sir Lawrence Abernethy, who was haſtening to the Engliſh rendezvous with twenty horſemen. The latter ſoon abandoned the cauſe of the vanquiſhed, and joined Douglas in the purſuit of Edward, who fled to Linlithgow. He had ſcarcely arrived there, when he was alarmed by the approach of the Scots, and again obliged to fly. Douglas and Abernethy followed him with ſuch aſſiduity, that (as Lord Hailes chooſes to Latinize the expreſſion of an ancient hiſtorian) <hi rend="italic">ne vel mingendi locus concederetur;</hi> but, notwithſtanding their utmoſt efforts, Edward got ſafe to Dunbar, where he was received by the earl of March, who protected him till he could be conveyed by ſea to England.</p><p>Such was the deceiſive battle of Bannockburn, the greateſt defeat the Engliſh ever ſuſtained from the Scots. On the ſide of the latter no perſons of note were ſlain, excepting Sir William Vipont, and Sir Walter Roſs the favourite of Edward Bruce; and ſo grievouſly was Edward afflicted by the death of this man, that he exclaimed, "O that this day’s work were undone, ſo Roſs had not died!” On the Engliſh side were ſlain 27 barons and bannerets, and 22 taken priſoners; of knights there were killed 42, and 60 taken priſoners; of eſquires there fell 700; but the number of the common men who were killed or taken was never known with any certainty. The Welſh who had ſerved in the Engliſh army were ſcattered over the country, and cruelly butchered by the Scottiſh peaſants. The Engliſh, who had taken refuge among the rocks in the neighbourhood of Stirling, ſurrendered at diſcretion: the caſtle was ſurrendered, and the privy-ſeal of England fell into the hands of the king of Scots. The ſpoils of the Engliſh camp were immenſe, and enriched the conquerors, along with the ranſom of many noble priſoners who fell into their hands. Robert ſhowed much generoſity in his treatment of the priſoners who fell to his ſhare. He ſet at liberty Ralph de Monthermer, and Sir Marmaduke Twerge, two officers of high rank, without ranſom; and by humane and generous offices alleviated the misfortune of the reſt. The dead bodies of the earl of Glouceſter and the lord Clifford were ſent to England, that they might be interred with the uſual ſolemnity. There was one Baſton, a Carmelite friar and poet, whom Edward is ſaid to have brought with him in his train to be ſpectator of his achievements, and to record his triumphs. Baſton was made priſoner, and obliged to celebrate the victory of Robert over the Engliſh. This he did in wretched Latin rhymes; which, however, procured his liberty. After the battle of Bannockburn, the earl of Hereford retreated to the caſtle of Bothwell, where he was beſieged by Edward Bruce, and ſoon obliged to  ſurrender. He was exchanged for the wife, ſiſter, and daughter of the king, the young earl of Marr, and the biſhop of Glaſgow. </p><p>The terror of the Engliſh after the defeat at Bannockburn is almoſt incredible. Walſingham aſſerts, that many of them revolted to the Scots, and aſſiſted them in plundering their own country. “The Engliſh,” ſays he, “were ſo bereaved of their wonted intrepidity, that an hundred of that nation would have fled from two or three Scotſmen.” Edward. Bruce and Douglas entered England on the eaſteen ſide, ravaged Northumberland, and laid the biſhopric of Durham under contribution. From thence they proceeded to Richmond, laid Appleby and ſome other towns in aſhes, and returned home loaded with plunder. Edward ſummoned a parliament at York, in order to concert means for the public ſecurity; and appointed the earl of Pembroke, formerly the guardian of Scotland, to be guardian of the country between the Trent and the Tweed. Robert, however, ſent ambaſſadors to treat of a peace; but the Scots were too much elated with their good fortune to make conceſſions, and the Engliſh were not yet ſufficiently humbled to yield to all their demands. The ravages of war were again renewed: the Scots continued their incurſions into England, and levied contributions in different places.</p><p>In 1315, the Engliſh affairs ſeemed a little to revive.</p></body></text></TEI>
