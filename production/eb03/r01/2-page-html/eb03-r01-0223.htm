<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Ά </span><span class="font0">piece oſ filver coin weighing </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">centigrave,</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">franc</span><span class="font0"> of ſilver, according to the former ſtandard will be&nbsp;worth 40 fols </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">iof</span><span class="font0"> deniers. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">milliare,</span><span class="font0"> or thou-ſand ffjf/rij, is ſubſtituted for the mile ; and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">are,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">■for the arpent in land-ineaſure. The latter two are&nbsp;-to each other as 49 to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">25.</span><span class="font0"> The aſtronomical circles&nbsp;•with which M. M. de Borda and Caffini made the obſer-&quot;vations, are divided according to this plan. The qua-•drant contains 1O0 degrees, and each degree 100 mi-' nutes. Hence the minute of a great circle on our&nbsp;globe is equal to a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">miUiare,</span><span class="font0"> or new French mile. If,&nbsp;for the reduction of -this meafure, we eſtimate the&nbsp;Paris toiſe, according to the compariſon made with&nbsp;the ſtandard kept in the Royal Society of London, at 6.3925 Engliſh feet, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">milliare</span><span class="font0"> or minute will&nbsp;be equal to 1093.f?33 y<sup>ai</sup>^<sup>s</sup>&gt; <sup>an</sup>ſt the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">metre</span><span class="font0"> 3.280899&nbsp;feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">. At the ſame period a new kalendar was formed.— By it the year is made </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font0">begin with the autumnal&nbsp;‘equinox, and is divided into 12 months. Theſc are&nbsp;‘called Vindemaire, Brumaire, Frimaire, Nivos, Ventos,&nbsp;•Pluvios, Germinal, Frorial, Praireal, Meffidor, Fervi-’dor, and Fructider. The months conſiſt of 30 days&nbsp;each, and are divided into three decades. The days of&nbsp;oach decade are known by the names of Primidi, Duo-&quot;di, Tridi, &amp;c. to Decadi ; and the day of reſt is ap-&quot;pointed for every tenth day, inſtead of the ſeventh.&nbsp;The day (which begins at midnight) is diſtributed into&nbsp;tell parts, and theſe are decimally divided and ſubdivided. Five ſupernumerary days are added every year&nbsp;after the 30th of Fructidor. To theſe is given the ab-ſurd appellation of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sans Cullottides,</span><span class="font0"> a word borrowed&nbsp;from a term of reproach </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(fans cullotte),</span><span class="font0"> which had often been beſtowed on the republican party from the&nbsp;jneannefs of their rank and fortune ; but which that&nbsp;party now attempted to render honourable and popular. The childiſh folly of this innovation has ſtruck&nbsp;every perſon with ſurprize, as it can ſerve no good purpoſe whatever. It is a wonderful inſtance of the way-wardneſs of the human mind, which can occupy itſelf&nbsp;one moment with deeds of ſavage barbarity, and the&nbsp;next with a matter ſo unimportant as the artificial diviſion of time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The religion of France had been gradually Iofing its influence ; and on the 7th of November, Gobet biſhop&nbsp;of Paris, along with a great multitude of other eccle-ſiaſtics, came into the hall of the convention, and ſolemn-ly refigned their functions and renounced the Chriſtian&nbsp;religion. All the clergymen, whether Proteſtant or Catholic, that were members of the convention, followed&nbsp;this example, excepting only Gregoire, whom we formerly mentioned as having been one of the firſt prieſts&nbsp;that joined the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Tiers Fiat</span><span class="font0"> after the meeting of the&nbsp;States General. He had the courage to profefs himſelf&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font0">Chriſtian, although he faid that the emoluments of his&nbsp;biſhoprſc were at the ſervice of the republic, with the&nbsp;acclamations of the convention, it was decreed that the&nbsp;only French deities hereafter ſhould be Liberty, Equality, Reaſon, &amp;c. and they would ſeem to have conſecrated theſe as a kind of new objects of worſhip.—&nbsp;what political purpofe the leaders in the convention intended to ſerve by this proceeding does pot clearly ap-pear ; unlefs, perhaps, their object was to render the&nbsp;French manners and modes of thinking ſo completely&nbsp;new', that it ſhould never be in their power to return to&nbsp;the ſtate from which they had juſt emerged, or to unite</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font0">in intercourſe with the other nations of Europe. </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font0">populace, however, could not at once relinquiſh en-tirely the religion of their fathers. The Commune oſ&nbsp;Paris ordered the churches to be ſhut up, but the Convention found it neceſſary to annul this order ; and Robefpierre gained no ſmali degree of popularity by ſupporting the liberty of religious worſhip on this occaſion. Hebert and Fabre d’Eglantine, who led the op-poſite party, haſtened their own fall by this ill-judged&nbsp;contempt of popular opinion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For, now that the republic ſaw itſelf fuccefsful in all quarters, when the Mountain party and the Jacobins&nbsp;had no rival at home, and accounted themſelves in no&nbsp;immediate danger from abroad, they began to ſplit into&nbsp;factions, and the fierceſt jealouſies aroſe. The Jacobin&nbsp;Club was the uſual place in which their conteſts were&nbsp;carried 011 ; and at this time Robefpierre acted the part&nbsp;of a mediator between all parties. Fie attempted with&nbsp;great art to turn their attention from private animoſities&nbsp;to public affairs. He ſpread a report that an invaſion&nbsp;of Great Britain was fpeedily to take place. He therefore propoſed that the Jacobin Club ſhould ſet themſelves&nbsp;to work to diſeover the vulnerable parts of the Brſtiſh&nbsp;conſtitutſon and government. They did ſo : They&nbsp;made ſpeeches, and wrote eſſays without number. And&nbsp;in this way was the moſt fierce and turbulent band of&nbsp;men that ever perhaps exiſted in any country occupied&nbsp;and amuſed for a very conſiderable time, what is no&nbsp;leſs ſingular, a great number of Britiſh ſubjects favoured the plans of theſe reforming Atheiſts, and, under&nbsp;the fpecious appellation of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Friends of the People,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">acted in concert with the French Jacobins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The winter paſſed away in tolerable quſetneſs, and no military enterpriſe was undertaken either by the allies&nbsp;or by the French. On the iſt of February, Barrere&nbsp;aſſerted in the Convention that the confederate powers&nbsp;were willing </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">provifionally</span><span class="font0"> to acknowledge the French&nbsp;republic, to conſent to a ceſſation oi hoſtilities for two&nbsp;years, at the end of which a laſting peace ſhould be ratified by the French people. But this propoſal the&nbsp;Convention declared itſelf determined to reject, as affording to the other nations of Europe the means of&nbsp;undermining their new government. In the mean time,&nbsp;the revolutionary government was gradually becoming&nbsp;' more vigorous. Thirty committees of the Convention&nbsp;managed the whole buſineſs of the ſtate, without ſha-ring^much of the direct executive government, which&nbsp;reſted in the committee of public fafety. Theſe diffe-rent committees were engaged in the utmoſt variety of&nbsp;objects. The ruling party had no competitors for&nbsp;power, without confuſion or oppoſition, therefore,&nbsp;the moſt extenſive plans were rapidly carried into effect.&nbsp;The Convention was little more than a court in which</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">every project was ſolemnly regiſtered. In the ſame ſeſ-iion 30 decrees would ſometimes be paſſed upon objects the moſt widely different. The finances were under&nbsp;one committee, at the head of which was Cambon.—&nbsp;This committee found reſources for the moſt laviſh ex-penditure. The affignats were received as money&nbsp;throughout the ſtate ; and thus a paper mill was ſaid to&nbsp;have become more valuable than a mine of gold. Their&nbsp;credit was ſupported by an arbitrary law regulating the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">maximum</span><span class="font0"> or higheſt price of all proviſions, and by the&nbsp;immenſe maſs of wealth which had come into the hands&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font0">the Convention by ſeizing the church lands, and </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">by&nbsp;confiſcating the property of royaliſts, </span><span class="font0">emigrants, and</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
