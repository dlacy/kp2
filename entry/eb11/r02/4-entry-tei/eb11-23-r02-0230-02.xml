<p><label>RHADAMANTHUS</label>
(Gr. Rhadamanthys), in Greek mythology, son of Zeus and Europa and brother of Minos, king of Crete. Driven out of Crete by his brother, who was jealous of his popularity, he fled to Boeotia, where he wedded Alcmene. Homer represents him as dwelling in the Elysian fields <hi rend="italic">(Odyssey,</hi> iv. 564). According to later legends, on account of his inflexible integrity he was made one of the judges of the dead in the lower world, together with Aeacus and Minos. He was supposed to judge the souls of Asiatics, Aeacus those of Europeans, while Minos had the casting vote (Plato, <hi rend="italic">Gorgias,</hi> 424A).</p>
