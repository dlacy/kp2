The penalties for transgressing any of these regulations are heavy.@@<hi rend="superscript">l</hi> The herring fishery has long been extensively cultivated, and much capital has been invested in it. The chief seat is the east of Scotland, of which Wick, and its suburb, Pultneytown, in Caithness, are important stations. Pultneytown, indeed, has, owing to this circumstance, grown up with something like the rapidity of a manufacturing village. During the fishing season, from 1500 to 2000 boats, each averaging a crew of five men, rendezvous here. Of these about 500 belong to the town ; the rest resort thither from all quarters of the kingdom. Of 436,098 barrels of herring cured in the year ending the 5th of April 1834, no fewer than 134,738, or between a third and a fourth of the whole, were cured at Wick. The following table contains an account of the total number of barrels of herring which were cured in Scotland in the year just referred to, distinguishing the stations where landed or cured :</p><p>Number of</p><p>Stations.	barrels</p><p>cured.</p><p>Ayr, Irvine, and Saltcoats 	 3,158</p><p>Campbelton	 3,394<hi rend="superscript">1</hi>/<hi rend="subscript">2</hi></p><p>Dumfries and Stran</p><p>raer	 3,343</p><p>Fort William	 2,259</p><p>Glasgow	 8,946<hi rend="superscript">1</hi>/<hi rend="subscript">2</hi></p><p>Greenock	12,817<hi rend="superscript">1</hi>/<hi rend="subscript">2</hi></p><p>Inverary	 3,931</p><p>Loch Broom			1,054</p><p>Dunvegan and Loch</p><p>Carron	 953<hi rend="superscript">1</hi>/<hi rend="subscript">2</hi></p><p>Lochgilphead.... ....	656</p><p>Lybster	34,712</p><p>Orkney, north isles.. 3,196 Orkney, south isles..10,560</p><p>Port-Gordon	 6,215</p><p>Shetland	36,855</p><p>Stonehaven		59<hi rend="superscript">1</hi>/<hi rend="subscript">2</hi></p><p>Number of</p><p>Stations.	barrels</p><p>cured.</p><p>Loch Shildag	 1,124 .</p><p>Rothsay	20,561<hi rend="superscript">1</hi>/<hi rend="subscript">2</hi></p><p>Stornoway	 398</p><p>Tobermory	 1,968</p><p>Anstruther	 1,134<hi rend="superscript">3</hi>/<hi rend="subscript">4</hi></p><p>Banff	19,956</p><p>Burntisland	 184<hi rend="superscript">1</hi>/<hi rend="subscript">2</hi></p><p>Cromarty	10,318</p><p>Eyemouth	 3,093</p><p>Findhorn	 6,520</p><p>Fraserburgh	58,275</p><p>Helmsdale	27,432</p><p>Leith	 41<hi rend="superscript">1</hi>/<hi rend="subscript">2</hi></p><p>Thurso	 8,890</p><p>Tongue	 9,353</p><p>Wick	134,738<hi rend="superscript">1</hi>/<hi rend="subscript">2</hi></p><p>Total	436,098<hi rend="superscript">1</hi>/<hi rend="subscript">4</hi></p><p>About an eighth part of the whole was cured at sea, and the remainder on shore. About the same proportion was cured ungutted ; the rest were gutted, and generally within twenty-four hours after the fish were caught. In addition to the herring, the Scottish coast abounds with various kinds of white fish, such as haddock, cod, ling, and the like, as also oysters, flounders, and other flat fish. the persons who carry on the white fishing reside in the sea-ports, or the numerous villages on the coast. They use lines and nets, but principally the former ; and their business can be carried on throughout the year. Steam navigation gives them a readier and a wider command of a market than they formerly enjoyed. In 1834 the herring, cod, and ling fisheries employed 9,263 boats, decked and undecked, 48,700 fishermen and boys by whom the boats were manned, 1893 coopers, and 28,645 in gutting, packing, &amp;c ; the total number of persons employed in these fisheries being 79,238.</p><p>This article would not be complete if it did not refer, however briefly, to the system of banking for which Scotland has become so celebrated. The Scottish banks are joint-stock establishments with large constituencies, the National bank having no fewer than 1238 partners, and the North of Scotland bank 1418; and, except in the case of</p><p>chartered banks, each partner is responsible to the extent of his private fortune. With the chartered banks the responsibility is limited ; but then the charter guarantees a certain amount of capital. For example, the capital of the bank of Scotland is L.1,500,000, for which sum the shareholders are responsible; and of it two-thirds, or L. 1,000,000, has been actually paid up. These establishments, consisting of extensive constituencies, whose responsibility is unlimited, or, if chartered, possessing large capitals paid up or guaranteed, enjoy the perfect confidence of the public. Besides, they are severally under the management of a body of Directors chosen by the partners out of their own body, and directly and periodically responsible to their constituents ; and under their superintendence the banking business is carried on in these establishments on the most judicious and approved principles. Nor is this all. The different banks periodically exchange notes with each other ; in Edinburgh, twice weekly, and in the country generally once a- week. Over-issuing is thus completely checked, for if any one bank has, after an exchange is made, an overplus of the notes of any other, this latter must redeem those notes either by a payment in specie, or in Exchequer bills, or an order on the bank of England. For any of these institutions to become insolvent or bankrupt seems next to be impossible. Indeed, no joint-stock bank, of any importance, ever did become insolvent ; but in cases when, in provincial towns, such banks have suspended payment, (which has happened only in a very few instances, and these originating in ignorance or fraud,) the public, or the holders of their notes, have suffered no loss, each partner being responsible to the amount of his private fortune. The Scotch banks receive sums as low as L.10, or sometimes lower, as deposits, and allow interest on them at about one, or one and a half per cent. below the market rate. The system of “cash accounts” is peculiar to the Scottish mode of banking. A cash account is a credit given by a bank to an individual with two or more collateral securities, for a certain sum, which he may draw out wholly or partially as he pleases, replacing it in the same way, being charged interest only on the portion he withdraws. The act prohibiting the circulation of small notes in England did not extend to Scotland ; so that the currency consists almost exclusively of papcr, namely, notes of the value of L.1 and upwards, Indeed, there is very little gold in circulation. The Scotch banks draw on London at twenty days date. The Bank of Scotland, the oldest banking establishment in Scotland, was established in 1695, and issued notes for L.1 as early as 1704. The Royal Bank of Scotland was founded in 1727 and the British Linen Company in 1746. The total number of joint-stock banks at present in Scotland is 25, having altogether 306 branches. There are also seven private banking establishments. The aggregate amount of the sums deposited in the different Scottish banks was calculated to be in 1826 about L.20,000,000 or L.21,000,000 ; and it must have since increased considerably. The circulatior is supposed to be between L.3,000,000 and L.4,000,000 seldom exceeding the latter sum.@@“</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">Historical</hi> part of this article was contributed by Patrick Fraser Tytler, Esq.; the <hi rend="italic">Statistical</hi> part by the Rev.
