<p><span class="font0">tions of argumentative with narrative matter which make up the staple of the oration are next resumed, and close at last&nbsp;in a remonstrance against the unfairness of the comparison&nbsp;proposed by rEschines, between the honours of the ancient&nbsp;times and those now conferred.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A short peroration follows, in which Demosthenes, without attempting any summary, claims for himself, and denies to his rival, credit for possessing what he maintains to be the two principal qualifications of a good citizen; namely,&nbsp;unchangeable love for his country, and a constant inclination to prompt his countrymen to noble and ambitious deeds.&nbsp;The foreign faction are then painted with a few bold and&nbsp;hurried strokes ; and the oration closes with a prayer to the&nbsp;gods to convert them if they will be converted, and if they&nbsp;will not, to cut them off from among the people, destroying&nbsp;a few men that the nation may be saved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We had designed to attempt exhibiting the eloquence of the great Attic masters in a yet stronger light, by contrasting it with specimens from the lowest ages of Greek&nbsp;oratory; and for that purpose we had selected one or two&nbsp;disputations of the learned and skilful sophist Libanius, the&nbsp;panegyrist of Julian the Apostate. Want of space, however, compels us to abandon this intention; and as the&nbsp;same cause prevents us from entering minutely on the Orations of Cicero, we prefer leaving these altogether untouched, to passing them with a few vague generalities. The&nbsp;characteristics of Cicero’s admirable eloquence, and the differences between it and that of Demosthenes, are matters&nbsp;familiar to every one ; and the study of the Latin orator is&nbsp;more common than that of the Greek, nearly in the inverse&nbsp;proportion of the real merits of the two.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>

<p><span class="font0">taste enough to relish the severer graces of a manly and prac- ''■&quot;“'v—</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">and richly stored understanding, always animated by at least</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">this, the speeches of Fox will form a treasure of models, in</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">which they will not only find successful exemplifications of</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">most of the principles of eloquence, but much that will remind</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">them of the calmer moods of Demosthenes. But several The speech-</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">of this, deserve from the student of eloquence more indus-j^<sub>n&gt;</sub> <sup>en</sup>&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">trious study than those two great men. Among these, we</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">can do no more than name Grattan, Erskine, and Sheridan ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">and we pause at the threshold of the present age, naming</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">no man who is still alive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But of the political orators who have preceded the present The three time both in the last century and this, by far the most re- great ora-markable, in a merely rhetorical point of view, were these<sup>tors-</sup>three j Chatham, Burke, and Canning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Very many of Chatham’s speeches are unreported ; many The elo-of the earlier ones have reached us with much distortion; quence of and there are but a very few in which we can believe our- ^<sup>orci</sup> *-**at-selves to be listening throughout to the exact words of the<sup>ham</sup>‘&nbsp;speaker. But enough remains to convince us that Chatham&nbsp;was the most powerful and striking political orator whom our&nbsp;country has ever produced. His celebrated youthful retort&nbsp;to the elder Horace Walpole bears unequivocal marks of&nbsp;being, in the shape in which we possess it, the manufacture&nbsp;of Samuel Johnson ; and we have scarcely any speech completely and genuinely reported, which was delivered before&nbsp;his fiftieth year. In the orations succeeding that time, our&nbsp;recollection of the speaker’s age and lofty position in the&nbsp;state prepares our minds to harmonize with the tone of address, and to consider that as noble boldness, which in a&nbsp;younger and meaner man might have received another&nbsp;name. The tone is never varied ; it is always uncompromising, stern, and admonitory: the speaker is not an advocate devising means to conciliate and persuade, but a preacher of truth and right, denouncing judgments on political transgression. Chatham’s mind never grew old; to the last hour&nbsp;of his public life the feelings glowed as passionately, and&nbsp;prompted images as vivid, and alternately checked, and impelled, and transformed the language, in figures as abrupt&nbsp;and varied, as in the morning of his youth and dawning ambition ; the sickness and decay of the body were overcome&nbsp;by the resistless energy of the fiery soul; and the British&nbsp;House of Lords trembled before the cripple who stood up&nbsp;feebly in the midst of them, to grow strong as he spoke&nbsp;by the impulse of his own fervent imagination. The idol&nbsp;of Chatham’s mind was the baronial constitution of England as confirmed in Magna Charta, which, indeed, with&nbsp;the Petition and Bill of Rights, he himself called the Englishman’s political bible: all the strong and diversified&nbsp;powers of his intellect, in observation, judgment, and rapidly&nbsp;convincing argument, and all the array of his chivalrously&nbsp;generous feelings, did continual homage at the one sacred&nbsp;shrine: attempts from below to widen the area of the political edifice, that the mass of the people might come in, the&nbsp;aristocratic Whig would have laughed to scorn: insidious&nbsp;endeavours from above and within to shake the pillars of the&nbsp;temple, roused him repeatedly to overwhelming indignation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">His eloquence found its most favourable field of display in two questions of his time: the famous elections of Wilkes for&nbsp;Middlesex, which were made the occasion of fierce debates&nbsp;as to the constitutional rights of the subject; and the more</span></p>
