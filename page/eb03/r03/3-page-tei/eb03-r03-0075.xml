See Helm.</p><p>In the ſeventh volume of the Tranſactions of the Society inſtituted at London for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce, there is explained a method of ſupplying the loſs of a ſhip’s rudder at ſea. The invention, which is Captain Pakenham’s of the roy<hi rend="sup">r</hi>al navy, has been approved by Admiral Cornwallis, the commiſſioners of the admiralty, by the ſociety in whoſe tranſactions the account of it was firſt publiſhed, and who preſented to Captain Pakenham their gold medal, by the Trinity-houſe, by the managing owners of Eaſt India ſhipping, by the duke of Sudermania the preſent regent of Sweden, and by the ſociety for the improvement of naval architecture. The ſubſtitute here recommended for a loſt rudder, ſays the inventor, is formed of thoſe materials without which no ſhip goes to ſea, and its conſtruction is ſimple and ſpeedy. Captain Pakenham, however, did not give a particular account of his invention to the ſociety whom he addreſſed, and to whom he ſent a model of his invention, till ſuch time as he had an opportunity of reducing the theory he had conceived to practice. On the 7th of July 1788, he made this trial with the Merlin of Newfoundland ; and he declares that, during the different, manœuvres of tacking and wearing, he could not diſcover the leaſt variation between the operation of the machine and that of the ſhip’s rudder : ſhe was ſteered with the ſame eaſe by one man, and anſwered the helm in every ſituation fully as quick. Admiral Cornwallis certifies the ſame with reſpect to the Crown of 64 guns, which loſt her rudder on the Kentiſh Knock, when with the ſubſtitute ſhe was ſteered to Portſmouth with the utmoſt eaſe in a heavy gale, and, as the admiral aſ-ſerts, it would have taken her to the Eaſt Indies.</p><p>The materials and conſtruction are thus deſcribed in the Tranſactions. “ N<hi rend="smallcaps"><hi rend="sup">j</hi></hi>  .l. a top-maſt inverted ; the fid-hole to ſiiip the tiller in, and ſecured with hoops from the anchor {locks ; the heel forming the head of the rudder.

N<hi rend="sup">j</hi>  6. A plank, or, if none on board the ſhips, gangboards. N<hi rend="sup">u</hi>  7.

The head of the rudder to paſs through as many decks as you wiſh.”</p><p>On this the Captain makes the following remarks : “ It might probably be ſuppoſed, that a difficulty would occur in bringing the jaws of the cap to embrace the ſtern-poſt ; but this will at once be obviated, when it is remembered that the top-chains, or hawſers, leading from each end of the jaws, under the ſhip’s bottom, are in fact a continuance of the jaws themſelves. Nor can it be apprehended that the cap, when fixed, may be impelled from its ſtation, either by the efforts of the ſea, or the courſe of the ſhip through the water, tho* even the hawſers, which confine it in the firſt inſtance, ſhould be relaxed:—the experiment proves, that the partners muſt be firſt torn away, or the main-piece broken off.</p><p>“ Since the improved ſtate of navigation, notwithſtanding· remedies have been found in general for the moſt diſaſtrous accidents at ſea, experience has evinced that nothing complete, had been hitherto invented to ſupply the loſs of a rudder. The firſt expedient within my knowledge were cables veered altern, with tackles leading from them to the ſhip’s quarters. This practice was ſuperſeded by the invention of the machine uſually called <hi rend="italic">the Ipſwich machine</hi>  ; but the conſtruction of it is complex and unwieldy, and veffels are ſeldom found in poſſeſſion of the materials which form it.
