<p><span class="font1">In 1628 the whole question of its legality was raised by the attempt of the privy council to rack John Felton, the assassin&nbsp;of the duke of Buckingham. This the judges resisted, unanimously declaring its use to be contrary to the laws of England.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RACKETT, or Rackett-Bassoon (Fr. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">cervelas</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">cervelat, </span><span class="font1">Ger. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rackett, Rankett </span><span class="font1">or</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"> Wurstfagott),</span><span class="font1"> a kind of dwarf bassoon,&nbsp;now obsolete, with a body measuring only from 4½ to 11 in.&nbsp;in length, but nevertheless containing the necessary length&nbsp;of tubing to give the bassoon or CONTRA-BASSOON pitch. The&nbsp;rackett consists of a barrel like body, resembling the barrel&nbsp;drone of the musette (see Bagpipe), made of wood or ivory.&nbsp;Round a centre tube are grouped eight parallel channels of&nbsp;very narrow cylindrical bore communicating with each other&nbsp;and forming a continuous tube nine times the length of the&nbsp;small body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A reed mouthpiece in combination with a cylindrical tube invests the latter with the acoustic properties of a closed pipe by&nbsp;creating a node at the mouthpiece end; the fundamental note&nbsp;given by such a tube is, therefore, an octave deeper in pitch than would&nbsp;be an open pipe of the same length. The bassoon&nbsp;has a conical bore and the properties of the open&nbsp;pipe, wherefore the aggregate length of the channels in the rackett only requires to be half that of the&nbsp;bassoon, a physical phenomenon to which this&nbsp;curious freak owed its existence. In the rackett&nbsp;the holes are bored obliquely through from the&nbsp;channels to the circumference—three in front for&nbsp;the left and three for the right hand, with an&nbsp;additional hole for the little finger; while at the&nbsp;back are placed the vent and three holes, one for&nbsp;the left thumb and two for the right, the second&nbsp;hole being controlled by the ball of the thumb.&nbsp;The rackett is played by means of a large double&nbsp;reed placed within a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">pirouette</span><span class="font0"> or cap, so that the&nbsp;lips do not come into contact with the reed, but&nbsp;only send a stream of compressed air into the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">pirouette,</span><span class="font0"> whereby the reed is set in vibration.&nbsp;The consequence of this principle of construction,&nbsp;peculiar to the bagpipe chaunter and drones (with&nbsp;a slight variation) and to cromornes, hautbois de Poitou and a lew&nbsp;other obsolete instruments, is that no harmonics can be obtained,&nbsp;since the vibrating length and the tension of the reed cannot be&nbsp;controlled by the player; the compass is therefore obtained by means&nbsp;of the fundamental and of the ten holes of the instrument, aided by</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">CROSS-FINGERING.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(K. S. )</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RACQUETS, or Rackets, a game played in an enclosed court with a ball and an implement with which the ball is&nbsp;struck called a racquet, from which the game takes its name.&nbsp;The racquet@@<sup>1</sup> is about 2½ ft. long, the head, which was&nbsp;formerly pear-shaped, being in the modern racquet nearly&nbsp;circular, from 7 to 8 in. in diameter and tightly cross-strung with cat gut. The balls, which are about 1¼ in.&nbsp;in diameter, are made of strips of cloth tightly wound over&nbsp;each other, with a sewn covering of smooth white leather,&nbsp;the floor and walls of English courts being coloured black;&nbsp;in India, where the floor and walls of the court are painted white, black balls are used. There are no regulation dimensions for a racquet court, nor for the racquet or ball, though&nbsp;substantial uniformity is observed in practice. The game is&nbsp;usually played either by two or by four players; and in England&nbsp;the court is the same for the four-handed and the two-handed&nbsp;game, the floor measuring usually 60 ft. by 30 ft., or occasionally&nbsp;an inch or two more each way; but in America larger courts&nbsp;measuring on the floor 80 ft. by 40 ft., a size formerly not </span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">uncommon in England, are sometimes built for the fou∑-handed game. Modern racquet courts have four walls and a roof, though in India they are sometimes left unroofed for the&nbsp;sake of coolness. The floor, which must be perfectly level&nbsp;and smooth, should be made of cement; but is sometimes&nbsp;paved, with less perfect results. The floor cannot be too hard,&nbsp;since the faster the ball travels the better the game; similarly&nbsp;the walls, which should be built of masonry faced with cement&nbsp;and most carefully smoothed, cannot be too hard and fast.&nbsp;The front and side walls are about 30 ft. high, the back wall&nbsp;being about half that height, with a gallery for spectators&nbsp;(containing the marker’s and umpires’ box) above it. The&nbsp;court is entered by a door in the centre of the back wall,&nbsp;which when shut must be perfectly flush with that wall,&nbsp;and without any projecting handle. The court is lighted&nbsp;from the roof. The diagram (fig. 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">shows the divisions and markings of</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">the court. On the front wall is fixed</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">a wooden board, the upper edge of</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">which, 26 in. from the fl∞r, constitutes</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">the “ play-line, ” and which usually</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">fills the whole space from that height</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">to the floor; and at a height from the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">floor of 8 ft. or a few inches more is</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">a second line, called the “ cut-line ” or</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“ service-line, ” painted white or in</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">colour. At a distance of 38 ft. (in a</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">court 60 ft. by 30 ft. ) from the front</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">wall and parallel to it, a white line is</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">painted on the floor from wall to wall,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">called the “short-line”; and from the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">centre of the short-line to the centre</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">of the back wall is the “ fault-line, ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">dividing into two equal rectangles the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">space between the back wall and the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">short-line. These rectangles are the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">service-courts and are called the right-</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">hand and left-hand court respectively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Against the side walls outside these</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">courts, but so that one side in each case</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">is formed by the short-line, are squares</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">8 ft. by 8 ft. called the service-boxes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Game. —</span><span class="font1">Racquets. is usually played either by two</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">persons (“ singles ”), or four persons playing two against two (“ doubles ’’); and the general idea of the game is the same as&nbsp;that in tennis, lawn tennis and fives, the object of the player in&nbsp;all these games being to score a point by striking the ball either&nbsp;before it reaches the ground or on its first bound, in accordance&nbsp;with the rules of the game, in such a way that his adversary may&nbsp;fail to make a “ good, ” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font1"> a valid, stroke in return. In the&nbsp;four-handed game one of each set of partners takes the right-hand court and his partner the left. The game consists of&nbsp;15 points called “aces. ” Aces can only be scored by the&nbsp;“ hand-in ’’ (the player, or side, having the “innings”), and the&nbsp;“ hand-out ’’ must therefore win a stroke or strokes to obtain&nbsp;innings before he or they can score an ace; in “ doubles ” each&nbsp;of the partners has an innings, and both must therefore be&nbsp;ousted before “ hand-out ’’ obtains the innings; but to this&nbsp;rule the first innings of each game affords an exception (see&nbsp;below). The “ hand-in ’’ always has “ service, ” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i. e.</span><span class="font1"> he opens the&nbsp;rally (the “ rally ’’ being the series of strokes made alternately&nbsp;by the two sides until one or other of them fails to make a good&nbsp;return) by “ serving ” the ball from the hand. This first stroke,&nbsp;or “ serve, ” must be made in the following manner. The server,&nbsp;standing with one foot at least inside one of the service-boxes,&nbsp;must toss the ball from his hand, and while it is in the air he&nbsp;must hit it with his racquet so that it strikes the front wall&nbsp;above the service-line and falls to the floor within the service-court on the opposite side; after striking the front wall the&nbsp;ball may, but need not, strike the side wall or back wall, or&nbsp;both, and it may do so cither before or after touching the floor.&nbsp;The serve is a “ fault ” if the ball (1) strikes the front wall</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
