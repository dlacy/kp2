<p><span class="font0">Dublin out of the hands of the English ; he made eight voyages to the West Indies, and ten to Brazil ; he was then&nbsp;promoted to the rank of rear-admiral, and sent to assist the&nbsp;Portuguese against the Spaniards. When the enemy came&nbsp;in sight, he advanced boldly to meet them, and gave such&nbsp;unquestionable proofs of valour as drew from the Portuguese&nbsp;monarch the warmest applause. His gallantry was still&nbsp;more conspicuous before Salee, a town of Barbary. With&nbsp;a single vessel he sailed through the roads of that place, in&nbsp;defiance of five Algerine corsairs who came to attack him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1653 a squadron of seventy vessels was despatched against the English, under the command of Admiral Van&nbsp;Tromp. Ruyter, who accompanied the admiral in this expedition, seconded him with great skill and bravery in the three&nbsp;battles which the English so gloriously won. He was afterwards stationed in the Mediterranean, where he captured&nbsp;several Turkish vessels. In 1659 he received a commission&nbsp;to join the king of Denmark in his war with the Swedes ;&nbsp;and he not only maintained his former reputation, but even&nbsp;raised it higher. As a reward of his services, the king of&nbsp;Denmark ennobled him and gave him a pension. In 1661&nbsp;he run ashore a vessel belonging to Tunis, released forty&nbsp;Christian slaves, made a treaty with the Tunisians, and reduced the Algerine corsairs to submission. His country,&nbsp;as a testimony of her gratitude for such illustrious services,&nbsp;raised him to the rank of vice-admiral and commander in&nbsp;chief. To the latter dignity, the highest that could be conferred upon him, he was well entitled by the signal victory&nbsp;which he obtained over the combined fleets of France and&nbsp;Spain. This battle was fought in 1672, about the time of&nbsp;the conquest of Holland. The battle was maintained between the English and Dutch with the obstinate bravery of&nbsp;nations which were accustomed to dispute the empire of&nbsp;the ocean. Ruyter having thus made himself master of the&nbsp;sea, conducted a fleet of Indiamen safely into the Texel ;&nbsp;thus defending and enriching his country, whilst it had become the prey of hostile invaders. The next year he had&nbsp;three engagements with the fleets of France and England,&nbsp;in which, if possible, his bravery was still more distinguished than ever. D’Estrées, the French vice-admiral, wrote&nbsp;to Colbert, “ </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font0"> w<sup>,</sup>ould purchase with my life the glory&nbsp;of De Ruyter.” But he did not long enjoy the triumphs&nbsp;which he had so honourably won. In an engagement with&nbsp;the French fleet off the coast of Sicily, he was defeated&nbsp;and received a mortal wound, which in a few days put an&nbsp;end to his life. His corpse was carried to Amsterdam, and&nbsp;a magnificent monument to his memory was there erected&nbsp;by the command of the states-general. The Spanish council had bestowed on him the title of duke, and transmitted&nbsp;a patent investing him with that dignity ; but he died before it arrived. When Louis XIV. was congratulated upon&nbsp;De Ruyter’s death, he replied, “ Every one must be sorry&nbsp;at the death of so great a man.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RYACOTTA, a town and celebrated fortress of the south of India, added to the Baramuhl district by the Marquis Cornwallis, in virtue of a treaty he concluded with Tip-poo. The fort is very strong by nature, and it has been further fortified by art, as this place is the chief key to Karna-ta. The air is so temperate here, from the elevation of the&nbsp;ground, that even in the hot season the thermometer scarcely&nbsp;ever rises higher than 82° of Fahrenheit. Ryacotta was besieged in 1791 by Major Gowdie ; and though it was of such&nbsp;strength, yet the garrison were intimidated by the spirited&nbsp;attacks of the besiegers, and surrendered, though amply supplied with guns, ammunition, and provision for its defence.&nbsp;It is ninety-eight miles east by north from Seringapatam.&nbsp;Long. 78. 1. E. Lat. 12. 33. N.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RYAGUDD, a town of Hindustan, possessed by independent zemindars, in the province of Orissa. It is sixty miles north-west from Cicacole. Long. 83. 27. E. Lat. 19. 1. N.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RYCHOOR, a town of Hindustan, in the nizam’s territories, and the province of Bejapoor. It is the capital of a district of the same name, and is 130 miles south-west from&nbsp;Hyderabad. It is an irregularly-built town, being an old&nbsp;fort with some new works. It is commanded by a hill, and&nbsp;by some rising grounds near it. Long. 77. 17. E. Lat. 15.&nbsp;59. N. The district extends along the north bank of the&nbsp;Toombuddra river, between the 15th and 16th degrees of&nbsp;north latitude.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RYDE, a hamlet within the parish of Newchurch, in the Isle of Wight. It has become a place of some importance,&nbsp;from having of late years been the resort of numerous families for the purpose of sea-bathing. It is opposite to Portsmouth, and from its vicinity to Spithead has some trade in&nbsp;supplying fresh stock and vegetables to the ships of war.&nbsp;It is finely situated, and the bathing is good. The population in 1801 amounted to 2039, in 1811 to 2847, in 1821&nbsp;to 3945, and in 1831 to 4928.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RYDROOG, a town and district of Hindustan, in the Balaghaut ceded territories. The town is 170 miles north by&nbsp;east from Seringapatam. Long. 77. 2. E. Lat. 14. 49. N.&nbsp;The district is situated principally between the 14th and&nbsp;15th degrees of north latitude. The Hoggry is the chief river, and the principal towns are Rydroog and Mulkamarroor.&nbsp;This district was ceded to the Company in 1800, and a&nbsp;pension allowed to the polygar’s family, to whom it belonged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RYE, a borough and seaport of the county of Sussex, in the hundred of Gostrow and rape of Hastings, 63 miles from&nbsp;London. It is a member of the Cinque Ports, but of a later date than the others. The harbour has been nearly&nbsp;choked up, partly by the recession of the sea, though it has&nbsp;been recently somewhat improved by a new cut. It was&nbsp;once fortified, but is ill built. It has a corporation, and&nbsp;returned two members to the House of Commons till 1832,&nbsp;since which it elects but one ; and its corporation, by the late&nbsp;law, consists of a mayor, four aldermen, and eleven councillors, but no justice of the peace. It has markets, which are&nbsp;held on Wednesday and Friday. The population amounted in 1821 to 3599, and in 1831 to 3715.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RYEPOOR, a town of Hindustan, in the province of Gundwana, and district of Choteesgur. This town, from its&nbsp;population and commerce, may be ranked amongst the first&nbsp;in the Choteesgur district. It contains 3000 huts, and has a&nbsp;stone fort on the north-east side of the town. It is sixty-nine&nbsp;miles from Ruttunpoor. Long. 82. 26. E. Lat. 21. 17. N.</span></p>

It is 847&nbsp;miles from St Petersburg. Long. 35. 3. E. Lat. 51. 35. N.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RYMER, Thomas, the author of that w'ell-known and important work the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Fadera,</span><span class="font0"> was born in the north of England, and educated at the grammar-school of Northallerton.&nbsp;He was admitted a scholar at Cambridge, then became a&nbsp;member of Gray’s Inn, and at length was appointed historiographer to King William in place of Mr Shadwell. He&nbsp;wrote a View of the Tragedies of the last Age, and afterwards published a tragedy named Edgar. For a critic he&nbsp;was certainly not well qualified, for he wanted candour ;&nbsp;nor is his judgment much to be relied on, who could condemn Shakspeare with such rigid severity. His tragedy&nbsp;will show that his talents for poetry were by no means&nbsp;equal to those whose poems he has publicly censured. But&nbsp;though he has no title to the appellation of poet or critic,&nbsp;as an antiquarian and historian his memory will long be&nbsp;preserved. His </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Foedera,</span><span class="font0"> which is a collection of all public&nbsp;documents of the kings of England with foreign princes, is&nbsp;esteemed one of our most authentic and valuable records,&nbsp;and is oftener referred to by the best English historians&nbsp;than any other book in the language. It was published at&nbsp;London in the beginning of the eighteenth century, in se-</span></p>
