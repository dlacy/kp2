<p><span class="font1">REGGI0, an ancient and conſiderable town of Italy, in the kingdom of Naples, and in the Farther&nbsp;Calabria, with an archbiſhop’s ſee, and a woollen manufactory. It is · ſeated in a delightful country, which&nbsp;produces plenty of oranges, and all their kindred fruits.&nbsp;The olives are exquiſite, and high-flavoured· The town,&nbsp;however, can boaſt oſ neither beautiful buildings nor&nbsp;ſtrong fortifications. 01' its edifices the Gothic cathedral is the only ſtriking one, but it affords nothing curious in architecture. The citadel is far from formidable, according to the preſent ſyſtem of tactics : nor could&nbsp;the city walls make a long reiiſtance againſt any enemy&nbsp;but Barbary corſairs ; and even tbeſe they have not always been able to repel, for in 1543 it was laid in aſhes&nbsp;by Barbaroffa. Muſtapha ſacked it 15 years after, and&nbsp;the deſolation was renewed in 1593 by another ſet of&nbsp;Turks. Its expofed ſituation, on the very threſhold of&nbsp;Italy, and fronting Sicily, has from the earlieſt period&nbsp;rendered it liable to attacks and devaſtation. The Chal-cidians ſcized upon it, or, according to the uſual Greek&nbsp;phraſe, founded it, aud called the colony </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rhegion,</span><span class="font1"> from&nbsp;a word that means a break or crack, alluding to its poſt-tion on the point where Sicily broke off from the continent. Anaxilas oppreffed its liberties. Dionyſius the&nbsp;Elder took it, and put many of the principal citizens&nbsp;to death, in revenge for their having refufed his alliance..&nbsp;The Campanian legion, ſent to protect the Rhegians,&nbsp;turned its ſword againſt them, maffacred many inhabitants, and tyrannized over the remainder, till the Roman ſenate thought proper to puniſh theſe traitors with&nbsp;exemplary ſeverity, though at the ſame time it entered&nbsp;into kagιιe with the revolted garrifon of Meſſina. This&nbsp;union with a ſet of villains, guilty of the ſame crime,&nbsp;proved that no love of juſtice, but political reaſons&nbsp;alone, drew down its vengeance on the Campanians.—&nbsp;It is about 12 miles S.<sub>j</sub>E. of Meſſina, and 190 S. by E.&nbsp;of Naples. E. Long. 16. ο. N. Lat. 38. 4.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">REG1FUGJUM was a feaſt celebrated at Rome on the 24th of February, in commemoration of the expυl-ſion of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tcirquinius Snperbm,</span><span class="font1"> and tlie abolition ot regal&nbsp;power.

<p><span class="font1">The viciſſitude of excrciſe and reſt forms alſo a neceffary part of regimen. See Exercise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">it is beneficial to be at reſt now and then, ’ but more ſo frequently to uſe exerciſe ; becauſe inaction renders&nbsp;the body weak and liſtleſs, and labour ſtrengthens it.&nbsp;But a medium is to be obſerved in all things, and too&nbsp;much fatigue is to be avoided : for frequent and violent&nbsp;exerciſe overpowers the nat ural ſtrength, and waſtes thc&nbsp;body ; but moderate exerciſe ought always to be uſed&nbsp;before meals. Now, of all kinds of exerciſe, riding on&nbsp;horfeback is the molt convenient : or if the perſon be&nbsp;too weak to bear it, riding in a coach, or at leaſt in a&nbsp;litter : next follow fencing, playing at ball, running,&nbsp;walking. But it is one of the inconveniences of old&nbsp;age, that there, is ſeldom ſuſſicient ſtrength for uſing bodily exerciſe, though it be extremely requiſtte for health:.&nbsp;wherefore frictions with the fleſh-bruſh are neceffary at&nbsp;this time of life ; which ſhould be performed by the perfon himſelf, if poſſible ; if not, by his ſervants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Sleep is the ſweet ſoother of cares, and reſtorer of ſtreifbth ; as it repairs and replaces the waſtes that are&nbsp;made by the labours and exerciſes of the day. But exceſſive ſleep has its inconveniences ; for it blunts the&nbsp;ſenſes, and renders them leſs fit for the duties of life.&nbsp;The proper time for ſleep is the night, when darknefi&gt;-and filence invite and bring it on : day-ſleep is leſs re··&nbsp;freſhing ; which rule if it be proper ſor the multitude&nbsp;to obſerve, much more is the obſervance of it neceffary&nbsp;for perſons addicted to literary ſtudies, whofe minds and&nbsp;bodies are more fiιfcept⅛le oſ injuries.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">REGIMENT, is a body of men, either horſe, foot, or artillery, commanded by a colonel, lieutenant-colonel,&nbsp;and major. Each regiment of foot is divided into companies ; but the number of companies differs : though&nbsp;in Britain our regiments are generally 10 companies,&nbsp;one of which is always grenadiers, excluſive of the two&nbsp;independent companies. Regiments of horfe are commonly ſix troops, but there are fome of nine. Dragoon&nbsp;regiments are generally in war-time 8 troops, and in&nbsp;time of peace but 6. Each regiment has a chaplain,&nbsp;quarter-maſter, adjutant, and ſurgeon.
