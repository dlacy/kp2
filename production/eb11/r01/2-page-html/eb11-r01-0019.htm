<p><span class="font0">A military championship was inaugurated in 1903 and is played annually at Princes’ Club. In 1908, mainly through the exertions&nbsp;of Major A. Cooper-Key, a “ Tennis, Racquets and Fives Association” was founded for the purpose of encouraging these games,&nbsp;safeguarding their interests and providing a legislative body whose&nbsp;authority would be recognized by all tennis and racquet players.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Racquets in America. —</span><span class="font0">In the United States and in Canada racquets is a popular game, and most of the leading athletic clubs&nbsp;have good courts. The American champions Foulkes, Boakes&nbsp;and George Standing were all beaten* by English professionals,&nbsp;but had a great reputation in their own country; and Tom Pettitt,&nbsp;Ellis and Moore are names that stand high in the records of the&nbsp;game. Among American amateurs, Lamontayne did much to&nbsp;encourage racquets in New York in the early period of its history;&nbsp;and in more recent times Quincy Shaw, de Garmendia, R. Fearing,&nbsp;Payne Whitney, Mackay, L</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">.</span><span class="font0"> Waterbury and P. D. Haughton have&nbsp;shown themselves racquet players of very high merit, although&nbsp;Mr Eustace Miles is of opinion that “ an English player like H. K.&nbsp;Foster, or Dames Longworth, or Ashworth, would give any American&nbsp;amateur upwards of seven aces. ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Squash racquets</span><span class="font1"> is a form of the game which provides admirable practice for the beginner, and has advantages of&nbsp;its own which offer attractions even to those who are proficient&nbsp;players of real racquets. It is played with a hollow india-rubber ball about the size of a fives ball (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i. e.</span><span class="font1"> nearly twice the&nbsp;size of an ordinary racquet ball) and with a racquet rather&nbsp;shorter in the handle than those used in racquets proper.&nbsp;The court may be of any dimensions, but is always much&nbsp;smaller than a real racquet court; the squash ball, being not&nbsp;nearly so fast as the racquet ball, would not reach the back&nbsp;wall in a 60 ft. court on the first bound unless hit high as well&nbsp;as hard against the front wall. The rules of the game itself&nbsp;are precisely the same as in real racquets. Squash racquets&nbsp;originated at Harrow, where the boys were in the habit of&nbsp;playing in an improvised court in the corner of the school-yard against the old school building; the windows, buttresses&nbsp;and water-pipe on the face of the wall forming irregularities&nbsp;which developed great skill on the part of the players in taking&nbsp;advantage of the difficulties thus caused. The marked success&nbsp;of Harrow in the Public Schools Championship at racquets,&nbsp;especially during the first twenty years of its institution (see&nbsp;above), has been attributed to the early training and practice&nbsp;gained at squash racquets in the school-yard, and in other&nbsp;courts which came into use as the popularity of this form of&nbsp;the game increased. Towards the end of the 19th century&nbsp;squash racquets became adopted at other schools and at the&nbsp;universities; and as the court is much cheaper to build than&nbsp;that required for real or “ hard ball ” racquets, and the game&nbsp;is cheaper as well as easier to play, many private courts came&nbsp;into existence. On the initiative of Lord Desborough, who&nbsp;had learnt the game at Harrow, several squash courts were&nbsp;provided at the Bath Club, London, where handicap tournaments arc annually played. At Lord’s cricket ground, when&nbsp;a new pavilion was erected in 1890, squash racquet courts&nbsp;were included in the building. The dimensions of the courts&nbsp;at Lord’s, which may be taken as the best model, are as follows:&nbsp;length 42 ft. by 24 ft.; height of back wall 8 ft. 8 in.;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">height of service-line from floor 8 ft. 9 in.; height of play-line 2 ft. 4 in. The short-line is 23 ft. from the front wall. The place which squash racquets has come to occupy may be&nbsp;estimated from the fact that Mr. Eustace Miles pronounces&nbsp;it “ an almost indispensable preparation ” for tennis and&nbsp;racquets as those games are played under modem conditions;&nbsp;and the same authority sufficiently describes its merits when&nbsp;he observes that it “ gives, at a small cost of time or money,&nbsp;abundance of hard and brisk and simple yet exciting exercise&nbsp;for all times of life, of the year, and even of the day—if we&nbsp;have good artificial light. ” The squash courts at Lord’s and&nbsp;at the Bath Club are lighted by electricity, so that play is not&nbsp;dependent on the condition of the atmosphere, or on the&nbsp;season of the year.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RADAUTZ, a town in Bukovina, Austria, 35 m. S. by W. of Czernowitz by rail. Pop. (1900) 14, 343, of which about&nbsp;70% are Germans and 25% are Rumanians. It was formerly&nbsp;the seat of a Greek bishopric, removed to Czernowitz in 1786,&nbsp;and possesses a cathedral (1402) with the tombs of several&nbsp;Moldavian princes. The Austrian government has here a&nbsp;large stud. To the W. of Radautz are situated the old&nbsp;monasteries of Putna and Suczawica, dating from the 15th&nbsp;century. They still contain many old and valuable ecclesiastical&nbsp;objects of art, although a great part has been removed to the&nbsp;various monasteries in Moldavia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RADBERTUS PASCHASIUS (d. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">c.</span><span class="font1"> 860), French theologian, was born at or near Soissons towards the close of the 8th&nbsp;century. He became a monk of Corbie, near Amiens in Picardy,&nbsp;in 814, and assumed the cloister name of Paschasius. He&nbsp;soon gained recognition as a learned and successful teacher,&nbsp;and the younger Adalhard, St Anskar the apostle of Sweden,&nbsp;Odo bishop of Beauvais and Warinus abbot of Corvei in&nbsp;Saxony may be mentioned among the more distinguished&nbsp;of his pupils. Between 842 and 846 be was chosen abbot,&nbsp;but as a disciplinarian he was more energetic than successful,&nbsp;and about 851 he resigned the office. He never took priestly&nbsp;orders. He died and was buried in Corbie.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Radbertus is one of the most important theologians in the history of the church. “ He was perhaps the most learned&nbsp;and able theologian after Alcuin, as well versed in Greek&nbsp;theology as he was familiar with Augustinianism, a comprehensive genius, who felt the liveliest desire to harmonize theory&nbsp;and practice, and at the same time give due weight to tradition ”&nbsp;(Harnack). His great work was the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Liber de Corpore et&nbsp;Sanguine Domini</span><span class="font1"> (first ed. 831; new ed., with an epistle to&nbsp;Charles the Bald, 844), which was not only the first systematic&nbsp;and thorough treatise on the sacrament of the eucharist, but&nbsp;is the first clear dogmatic statement of transubstantiation,&nbsp;and as such opened an unending controversy. It was at once&nbsp;attacked by Ratramnus and Hrabanus Maurus, but was so&nbsp;completely in touch with the practice of the church and the&nbsp;spirit of the age, as to win the verdict of Catholic orthodoxy.</span></p>
