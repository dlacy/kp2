in the ſportſman’s language, a term uſed to expreſs the mark of the foot of a ſtag or other animal proper for the chace in the clay or earth, by which they are able to gueſs when the animal paſſed, and which way he went. The ſlot, or treading of the stag, is very nicely ſtudied on this occasion ; if the slot be large, deep printed in the ground, and with an open cleft, and, added to theſe marks, there is a large ſpace between mark and mark, it is certain that the ſtag is an old one. If there be obſerved the ſlots or treadings of two, the one long and the other round, and both of one ſize, the long ſlot is always that of the larger animal. There is alſo another way of knowing the old ones ſrom the young ones by the treading ; which is, that the hinder feet of the old ones never reach to their fore feet, whereas thoſe of the young ones do.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
