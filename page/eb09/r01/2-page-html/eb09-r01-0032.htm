<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">England betAveen the conference of Norham in May 1291 and the final award in favour of Baliol in November 1292,&nbsp;and again in 1296. Of the former of these records two&nbsp;copies were preserved in the chapter-house at Westminster&nbsp;(now in the Record Office, London), and it has been printed&nbsp;by Rymer (</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Foedera</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">, ii. 542). Another copy, preserved&nbsp;originally in the Tower of London, is now also in the&nbsp;Record Office. The latter record, containing the various&nbsp;acts of homage and fealty extorted by EdAvard from Baliol&nbsp;and others in the course of his progress through Scotland&nbsp;in the summer of 1296 and in August at the parliament&nbsp;of Benvick, was published by Prynne from the copy in the&nbsp;Tower and now in the Record Office. Both records were&nbsp;printed by the Bannatyne Club in 1834. The derivation of&nbsp;the word “ ragman ” has never been satisfactorily explained,&nbsp;but various guesses as to its meaning and a list of examples&nbsp;of its use for legal instruments both in England and Scotland Avili be found in the preface to the Bannatyne Club’s&nbsp;volume, and in Jamieson’s </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Dictionary, s.v.</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> “Ragman.” The&nbsp;name of “ Ragman ” has been sometimes confined to the&nbsp;record of 1296, of which an account is given in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Calendar of&nbsp;Documents relating to Scotland preserved in the Public&nbsp;Record Office, London</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1884), vol. ii., Introd., p. xxiv. ;&nbsp;and as to the seals see p. lii. and appendix.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">RAGUSA (Slavonic </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Dubrovnik,</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> Turkish </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Paprovnik),</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> a city on the east coast of the Adriatic, for many centuries&nbsp;an independent republic, now at the head of a district&nbsp;in the province of Dalmatia in Austria-Hungary. It is&nbsp;built close to the sea at the foot of the bare limestone&nbsp;mass of Monte Sergio, on which stands an unfinished Fort&nbsp;Impérial erected by the French. In front lies the island&nbsp;of Lacroma, the traditional landing-place of Cœur-de-Lion.&nbsp;Several ancient stone-built forts—San Lorenzo (11th century), Leverono (16th), &amp;c.—defend the harbour, and the&nbsp;city is fenced in Avith lofty walls. The main street runs&nbsp;in a narroAv valley between the mountain and a seaward&nbsp;ridge; the valley Avas up till the 13th century a channel&nbsp;of the sea, and the seaward ridge was the rocky island of&nbsp;Lavve or Ragusa proper, opposite which lay among its&nbsp;pine trees the Slavonic settlement of Dubrovnik. Though&nbsp;still a fine street, this corso is not so imposing as before&nbsp;its palatial mansions were overthroAvn by the earthquake&nbsp;of 1667. It contains a 15th-century cistern, a church&nbsp;(Del Redentore) erected after the earthquake of 1536 to&nbsp;avert similar catastrophes, and a Franciscan monastery;&nbsp;and in the piazza off its southern extremity are the Palazzo&nbsp;Rettorale, or residence of the “rectors” of the republic&nbsp;(1435-52), the old custom-house and mint, completed in&nbsp;1520, and the Torre del Orologio, with its curious clock.&nbsp;The “palace” is a marvellous specimen of late Romanesque&nbsp;influence, especially famous for the six columns of its façade&nbsp;and the alchemist group with which one of the capitals is&nbsp;decorated ; and the custom-house has also a fine Romanesque element in its style. The cathedral (dedicated to&nbsp;the Virgin Mary, though the patron saint of the city is&nbsp;St Blasius, whose effigy perpetually occurs on its coins,&nbsp;fortifications, and churches) is a building in the Italian&nbsp;taste of the 18th century. Ragusa can never have been&nbsp;a large city. In the 16th century it is said to have contained 30,000 or 40,000 inhabitants; in 1881 it had only&nbsp;7245, and its commune, with its fifteen additional villages,&nbsp;10,936. The harbour, once one of the great ports of&nbsp;southern Europe, is altogether too small for modern&nbsp;requirements, in spite of the new breakAvater constructed&nbsp;in 1873 to protect it from the south-west winds. From&nbsp;400 to 600 vessels (mostly under 50 tons burden) enter&nbsp;yearly. The neighbouring harbour of Gravosa (Slav </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Gruz·,&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">population 677) is the real port of Ragusa as far as steamboat traffic is concerned. The staple trade is that of oil ;&nbsp;but the whole supply is sent to the Trieste market.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Ragusan Malmsey, once famous, has disappeared before the vine-disease since 1852.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The history of Ragusa has been thus summarized by Mr Freeman :—“Those hills, the slopes of which begin in the streets of the city, once fenced in a ledge of Hellenic land from the native&nbsp;barbarians of Illyricum. Then they fenced in a ledge of Roman&nbsp;land from the Slavonic invader. Lastly they still fence in a ledge&nbsp;of Christian land from the dominion of the infidel.” The city was&nbsp;founded on a rocky island by Roman Christian refugees from&nbsp;Epidaurus (now Ragusa Vecchia, 675 inhabitants), in the middle,&nbsp;say some, of the 3d century after Christ ; and in the middle of the&nbsp;7th century it was strengthened by other refugees from Salona,&nbsp;destroyed by the Slavs. In course of time a Slavic settlement&nbsp;was incorporated within its walls ; and thus by language and&nbsp;sympathies it became a link between two great civilizations.&nbsp;Ragusa<sup>1</sup> maintained its independence against all comers partly by&nbsp;war but more by diplomacy. In the 9th century it more than&nbsp;once repulsed the Saracens, and in the 10th defended itself against&nbsp;Venice, the pirates of the Narenta, Samuel (czar of the Bulgarians),&nbsp;and the emperor Otho ; in the 11th century it was drawn by its&nbsp;alliance with Robert Guiscard into a war with Byzantium and&nbsp;Venice, and in the 12th century fought with the ban of Bosnia&nbsp;and with Stephen Nemanya of Servia, who twice invested the city.&nbsp;But its policy wa3 generally peaceful. To refugees of all nations,&nbsp;even to those who had been its own bitter foes, it afforded asylum ;&nbsp;and by means of treaty and tribute it gradually worked its way to&nbsp;a position of mercantile power which Europe could hardly parallel.&nbsp;A compact Avhich it made with the Turkish ruler at Broussa in 1370&nbsp;was renewed by Bajazet in the 15th century and saved the little&nbsp;state from the fate of her most powerful neighbours, Byzantium&nbsp;and Servia. By that time Ragusa had stations at Serai, Bucharest,&nbsp;Tirgovisce, Widdin, Rustchuk, Sophia, and Adrianople ; and her&nbsp;vessels were known not only in Italy, Sicily, Spain, Greece, and&nbsp;the Levant, but in the more northern parts of Europe. Our own&nbsp;language retains in the word “ai־gosy” a relic of the carracks of&nbsp;Ragusa, then known to Englishmen as Argouse, Argusa, or Aragosa.&nbsp;As the world widened the Ragusan merchants went farther,—to&nbsp;India, even, and America. But the finest vessels of their fleet were&nbsp;compelled to join the Spanish Armada and shared its fate ; and the&nbsp;city, which had felt shocks of earthquake in 1520, 1521, 1536, and&nbsp;1639, Avas in April 1667 laid utterly in ruins and lost a fifth of its&nbsp;inhabitants. “ The rector of the republic, five-sixths of the nobles,&nbsp;nine-tenths of the clergy, a Dutch ambassador Avith his suite of&nbsp;thirty-three on his Avay to Constantinople, and 6000 citizens Avere&nbsp;buried.” Ragusa never quite recovered its prosperity, though it&nbsp;Avas again a busy trading toAvn of 15,000 inhabitants when Napoleon&nbsp;seized it in 1806. In 1808 it Avas deprived of its independence ;&nbsp;and by the congress of Vienna in 1814 it was assigned to Austria.&nbsp;This is not the place to describe the remarkable literary development, Latin, Italian, and Slavonic, of Avhich Ragusa Avas the&nbsp;centre in the 15th, 16th, and 17th centuries, and to which so many&nbsp;of its patricians contributed ; a detailed account will be found&nbsp;in Pypin and Spasovich’s </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">History of Slavic Literatures</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> (German&nbsp;edition, 1880). Gondulic (Gondola) the poet and Boscovich the&nbsp;mathematician are leading names.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">RAGUSA, a city of Italy in the province of Syracuse (Sicily), 16 miles east of Vittoria and 10 north-north-Avest of Modica, lies on the right side of the valley of the&nbsp;Ragusa or Erminio (Herminius). It consists of an upper&nbsp;toAvn Avith 24,183 inhabitants and a lotver toAATi with&nbsp;6260 (1881), the two communes having a total population of 30,720. The church of Santa Maria della Scala is&nbsp;in part modern, but in part of considerable antiquity and&nbsp;interest </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> and San Giorgio contains the tomb of Bernardo&nbsp;Caprera (ob. 1423), who tried to seize the crown of Sicily.&nbsp;Ragusa possesses a large cotton-factory.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stone impreg</span></p>
