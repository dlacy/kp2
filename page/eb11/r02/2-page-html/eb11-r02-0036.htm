<p><span class="font2">of the world, brother of Maät and the giver of laws and culture to man.@@<sup>1</sup> Thoth “ the thrice-great ” passed into Hermes&nbsp;Trismegistus whom Christian fathers could recognize,@@<sup>2</sup> when the&nbsp;supremely beautiful figure of Greek theology, Apollo, had lost&nbsp;his dignity and ceased to be desired. Thoth was a voluminous&nbsp;author, and the collection of forty-two books which bore his&nbsp;name was a kind of primitive cyclopaedia of theology, astronomy,&nbsp;geography and physiology. Apollo proclaims at his birth that&nbsp;he will declare the counsel of Father Zeus to men.@@<sup>3</sup> But his&nbsp;utterances have been only casually preserved. A special&nbsp;literature of oracles did indeed arise; the divine words were&nbsp;collected and the circumstances which produced them' were&nbsp;recorded; and had Delphi become in fact the centre of Greece,&nbsp;as Plato conceiyed it, here might have been the nucleus of&nbsp;a scripture. Theories of inspiration lurk behind the rich&nbsp;vocabulary of Greek prophecy; the seer is </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">cvBcos, BcFKrprros,&nbsp;BclnrvcvaTOS, BcOfkbprjTOS,</span><span class="font2"> and Bakis and Musaeus give their&nbsp;names to sacred verses. The story of the Sibylline books&nbsp;in Rome, on the other hand, shows the growth of the idea&nbsp;of authority. They are deposited in a temple, in charge of&nbsp;a small sacred college; new deities and rites are introduced&nbsp;under their sanction; when they are accidentally destroyed,&nbsp;envoys are sent to the East and fresh collections are made;&nbsp;these are in their turn purged, the false are discarded and the&nbsp;true reverently preserved. By what method the books were&nbsp;consulted is not known; but they exhibit the idea of a sacred&nbsp;canon in process of formation. The theologians of India&nbsp;guarded their ancient hymns with the utmost care. A vast&nbsp;literary apparatus was devised for their protection. The famous&nbsp;Purusha-hymn </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(R. V.</span><span class="font2"> x. 90) already claimed a divine origin for&nbsp;the three Vedas, the Rik, the Saman and the Yajush. The&nbsp;“ triple knowledge ” was sometimes derived from the “ Lord of&nbsp;Creatures ” Prajapati—one of the unifying forms of Brahmanical&nbsp;theology—through Vac or “ speech.” The Veda, that is to say,&nbsp;had existed in the divine mind ere it was made known to men,&nbsp;and as such it belonged to the realm of the deathless and the&nbsp;infinite. The tribal poets were supposed to have “ seen ” the&nbsp;heavenly originals; elaborate arguments were devised to explain&nbsp;how the names of particular objects like rivers and mountains&nbsp;could have existed in the Eternal; while the grounds of belief&nbsp;in the infallibility of the sacred verses were enforced with the&nbsp;double weight of philosophy and tradition. Buddhism repudiated the authority of the Veda, but found it needful to supply&nbsp;its place; and the word of the omniscient Teacher, faithfully&nbsp;reported by his disciples and guaranteed by concurrent traditions, became the rule of belief for the new Order. Nor were&nbsp;the authors of the scriptures whose fragments are preserved in&nbsp;the Zend Avesta less conscious of their divine value. The&nbsp;ancient Gāthās, which were supposed to be the composition of&nbsp;Zarathustra himself, received the homage of later worshippers.@@<sup>4&nbsp;</sup>Daena, the ideal personification of law and religion, is the object&nbsp;of praise and sacrifice. She dwells on high in the Heavenly&nbsp;Home, the radiant “Abode of song,” but Zarathustra summons&nbsp;her thence, begs for her fellowship, and prays her for righteousness of thought, speech and deed.@@<sup>5</sup> She is produced by Vohu&nbsp;Mano, the “ Good Thought ” of Ahura,· one of the six Holy&nbsp;Immortals; she thus belongs to the ideal creation before the&nbsp;earth and its inhabitants;@@<sup>6</sup> but how the heavenly Daena was&nbsp;wrought by Zarathustra into written form is nowhere stated.&nbsp;This conception of pre-existent spiritual counterparts was not&nbsp;without influence on the later theology of Israel. The sacred&nbsp;law (Torah) was the earthly reproduction of a heavenly Torah&nbsp;which had no origin in time, and constituted the sum of ideal&nbsp;wisdom into which God looked when he would create the world.@@<sup>7</sup></span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2">Even Mahommedanism felt the spell of the same modes of thought. The idea of revelation was expressed by “ sending&nbsp;down ” (from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">nazala,</span><span class="font2"> to descend) ; that which passed from&nbsp;heaven to earth was a pre-existent word, eternal as God Himself.&nbsp;Allusions in particular passages of the Koran to the “ mother&nbsp;of the scripture,” the invisible originals of the prophet’s speech,&nbsp;led to the doctrine of its uncreated being. The whole history&nbsp;of religion presents perhaps no more singular spectacle than the&nbsp;mosques of Bagdad in the middle of the 9th century filled with&nbsp;vast crowds of twenty and thirty thousand of the faithful,&nbsp;assembled to discuss the dogmas of the created and the uncreated Koran.@@<sup>8</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2">8. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ethics and Eschalology.—</span><span class="font2">The second distinguishing mark in Tiele’s higher group is implied in the term “ Ethical.” By&nbsp;this it is not intended to assert that moral ideas are wanting in&nbsp;the so-called “ naturist ” religions. Anthropologists have, it&nbsp;is true, taken widely different views of the relation of ethics&nbsp;and religion, and the stage at which an effective alliance between&nbsp;them might be recognized. Like all problems of origins, the&nbsp;question is necessarily extremely obscure, and cannot be definitely&nbsp;settled by historical evidence. Broadly speaking, however, it&nbsp;may be said that the attempt to show that certain savages are&nbsp;destitute of moral feeling cannot be sustained;@@<sup>9</sup> and evidence&nbsp;has been already cited above (in the section on </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Primitive&nbsp;Religion)</span><span class="font2"> proving the varied and immediate effects of religion&nbsp;on the life of the lowest tribes. Continuous interaction marks&nbsp;the slow courses of advance. At a very early period in social&nbsp;development the rules of conduct are referred to some higher&nbsp;source. Thus among the tribes of south-eastern Australia&nbsp;described by Mr Howitt,@@<sup>10</sup> the native rites and laws handed&nbsp;down from generation to generation were supposed to have been&nbsp;first imparted by some higher being such as Nurrundere, who&nbsp;made all things on the earth; or Nurelli, who created the whole&nbsp;country, with the rivers, trees and animals; or Daramulun,&nbsp;who (like Nurrundere) bestowed weapons on the men, and&nbsp;instituted the rites and ceremonies connected with life and death.&nbsp;As reUgion advances with improved social organization, a series-of figures, partly human, partly divine, embodies the idea that&nbsp;the command of nature implied in the progress of the arts is&nbsp;due to some kind of instruction from above, and that the obU-gations of law are of more than human origin. The Algonquin&nbsp;Manibozho and Quetzalcoatl of Mexico stand for a whole group&nbsp;of typical personalities in North and-Central America. The&nbsp;mysterious fish-man Oannes,who taught the primitive inhabitants&nbsp;of Babylonia, according to Alexander Polyhistor, has been&nbsp;identified with Ea, god of the deep, the source of wisdom, culture&nbsp;and social order. Zeus gave laws to Minos; Apollo revealed&nbsp;the Spartan constitution to Lycurgus; Zaleucus received the&nbsp;laws for the Locrians from Athena in a dream; Vishnu and&nbsp;Manu condescended to draw up law-books in India. The&nbsp;worship of ancestors has again and again gathered around it&nbsp;powerful and ethical influences, emphasizing the parental and&nbsp;filial relations, and strengthening the mutual obligations of&nbsp;communal life. Hirata answered by anticipation the modern&nbsp;reproach against Shinto, founded on the absence of any definite&nbsp;morality connected with it, by laying down the simple rule,&nbsp;“ Act so that you need not be ashamed before the Kami of the&nbsp;unseen.” @@<sup>11</sup> The mythological embodiments of the connexion&nbsp;of law in nature with the social and moral order have already&nbsp;been briefly noted: a few words may be said in conclusion on&nbsp;another product of the union of reUgion and ethics, viz. the&nbsp;doctrine of judgment after death. That this doctrine is not&nbsp;essential to a highly moralized religion is clear from the fact that&nbsp;it formed no part of the earlier Hebrew prophecy. Judgment,&nbsp;indeed, was an inevitable outcome of the sovereignty of Yahweh,&nbsp;but it would be passed upon the nation in the-immediate scene&nbsp;of its misdoings; and even when the scope of the divine doom</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
