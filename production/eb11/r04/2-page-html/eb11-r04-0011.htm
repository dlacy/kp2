<p><span class="font0">guarded against by the rule which required in grave eases the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias</span><span class="font0"> to consult in the first place the near kinsmen oí his&nbsp;child, maternal as well as paternal. Even the incapacity of the&nbsp;children of the family to acquire property of their own cannot&nbsp;in those times have been regarded as any serious hardship; for,&nbsp;though the legal title to all their acquisitions was in the housefather during his life, yet in truth they were acquired for and&nbsp;belonged to the family as a whole, and he was little more than&nbsp;a trustee to hold and administer them for the common benefit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">patria potestas,</span><span class="font0"> unless the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias</span><span class="font0"> voluntarily put an end to it, lasted as long as he lived and retained his status.&nbsp;The marriage of a son, unlike that of a daughter passing into&nbsp;the hand of a husband, did not release him from it, nor did his&nbsp;children become subject to him so long as he himself was </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">in&nbsp;potestate.</span><span class="font0"> On the contrary, his wife passed on marriage into&nbsp;the power of her father-in-law, and their children as they were&nbsp;bom fell under that of their paternal grandfather; and the&nbsp;latter was entitled to exercise over his daughters-in-law and&nbsp;grandchildren the same rights that he had over his sons and unmarried daughters. But there was this difference, that, when&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">pater-familias</span><span class="font0"> died, his sons and daughters who had remained </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">in potestate</span><span class="font0"> and his grandchildren by a predeceased son&nbsp;instantly became their own masters </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(sui juris))</span><span class="font0"> whereas grandchildren by a surviving son simply passed from the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">pot estas</span><span class="font0"> of&nbsp;their grandfather into that of their father.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The acquisition of domestic independence by the death of the family head frequently involved the substitution of the&nbsp;guardianship of tutors </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(tutela)</span><span class="font0"> for the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">potestas</span><span class="font0"> that&nbsp;had come to an end. This was so invariably&nbsp;in the case of females </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sui juris,</span><span class="font0"> no matter what&nbsp;their age: they remained under guardianship until they had&nbsp;passed by marriage </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">in tnanum tnariti.</span><span class="font0"> It was only during&nbsp;pupillarity, however, that males required tutors, and their&nbsp;office came to an end when puberty was attained. It is improbable that during the regal period a testamentary appointment of tutors by a husband or parent to wife or children was&nbsp;known in practice. In the absence of it the office devolved</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">upon the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">gens</span><span class="font0"> to which the deceased </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias</span><span class="font0"> belonged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">' Family Organization among the Plebeians.—</span><span class="font0">If perfect identity of customs cannot be assumed to have existed amongst the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">patrician </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">gentes</span><span class="font0"> in the regal period of Rome, far less ean it be supposed to have existed amongst the heterogeneous population (Latins, Etruscans, Greeks, &amp;c.)&nbsp;of which the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">plebs</span><span class="font0"> was constituted. Nevertheless, contiguity&nbsp;of residence and community of interests tend inevitably to&nbsp;unify customs and cause dissimilarities to disappear, and the&nbsp;plebeians must have not only gradually brought their own&nbsp;customs into unison </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">inter se,</span><span class="font0"> but adapted them at the same&nbsp;time in many respects to those of the patricians. Even to&nbsp;those of non-Latin race </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">manus</span><span class="font0"> over their wives and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">potestas&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">over their children would become a desideratum. Though&nbsp;the plebeians seem to have been always excluded from con-farreation, and their matrimonial unions must have been at&nbsp;first informal and irregular from the point of view of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Quirites,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">two civil modes of acquiring marital </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">manus</span><span class="font0"> were available to&nbsp;them after they obtained citizenship, viz. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">coemptio</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">usus.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">Some writers hold that neither of these modes was legally&nbsp;recognized prior to the XII. Tables.@@<sup>1</sup> This may be so, but it&nbsp;is improbable. As the plebeians obtained by the Servian&nbsp;constitution full capacity for quiritarian ownership, it was at&nbsp;once open to them to adapt the modes sanctioned for acquiring&nbsp;property to the acquisition of marital </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">manus. Coemptio</span><span class="font0"> was&nbsp;just a simple adaptation of mancipation above referred to&nbsp;(see also </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">infra,</span><span class="font0"> p. 540). It was, as we may infer from what we&nbsp;know of it at a later time, a sale of the woman to the man </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">per&nbsp;aes et libram</span><span class="font0"> for a nominal price. The price being fictitious,&nbsp;a piece of copper </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(raudusculum)</span><span class="font0"> was used to represent it, and&nbsp;this was handed over to the seller, who would ordinarily be&nbsp;the woman’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias,</span><span class="font0"> or, if she were </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">siti juris,</span><span class="font0"> her gentile&nbsp;tutor. The nuncupatory words used in the ceremony have&nbsp;unfortunately not been preserved; necessarily, of course, they</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">varied from those of an ordinary mancipation of property.<sup>@@2 </sup>Though called by the jurists a mode of constituting marriage,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">coemptio,</span><span class="font0"> as we know it, was strictly a mode of creating </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">manus,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">for, though usually contemporaneous with, it might, as Gaius&nbsp;informs us, follow the marriage at any distance of time, and&nbsp;was not dissolved by divorce, but required a separate act of&nbsp;remancipation. Students of comparative law have observed&nbsp;that in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">coemptio</span><span class="font0"> there arc clear traces of earlier bride purchase,&nbsp;so common even nowadays among uncivilized tribes, where a&nbsp;real price in cattle or sheep, and not a mere nominal one, has&nbsp;to be paid for the bride. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Usus,</span><span class="font0"> on the other hand, was a mode&nbsp;of acquiring marital </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">manus</span><span class="font0"> by possession of the woman as wife&nbsp;for a certain period of time—long cohabitation.@@<sup>3</sup> Whether this&nbsp;was recognized by the law prior to the XII. Tables depends&nbsp;probably upon whether usucaption, as a mode of acquiring&nbsp;property, was settled by custom earlier than the Tables. Some&nbsp;writers, however, think it older than </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">coemptio,</span><span class="font0"> and as a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">de&nbsp;facto</span><span class="font0"> relation prolonged cohabitation as man and wife must&nbsp;have existed from very early times. Comparative historians&nbsp;with good reason trace in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">usus</span><span class="font0"> the relics of primitive bride&nbsp;capture. Both coemption and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">usus,</span><span class="font0"> from the time they were&nbsp;first recognized by the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">jus Quiritium,</span><span class="font0"> undoubtedly created&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">pair io potestas</span><span class="font0"> and agnatic rights.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Law of Property.<sup>@@4</sup>—</span><span class="font0">The history of the early Roman community, like many other primitive communities, is marked by the disintegration of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">gentes</span><span class="font0"> and the growth of&nbsp;individual property. Yet the distribution of land,&nbsp;amongst the early Romans is one of the puzzling&nbsp;problems of their history. The Servian constitution'&nbsp;apparently classified the citizens and determined their privileges, duties and burdens according to the extent of their&nbsp;lands; and yet we know nothing for certain of the way in&nbsp;which these were acquired. All is conjectural. We have&nbsp;indeed a traditional account of a partition by Romulus of the&nbsp;little territory of his original settlement into three parts, one&nbsp;of which was devoted to the maintenance of the state and its&nbsp;institutions, civil and religious, the second </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(ager publicus)</span><span class="font0"> to&nbsp;the use of the citizens and profit of the state, and the third&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(ager privatus)</span><span class="font0"> subdivided among his followers. Varro and&nbsp;Pliny relate that to each </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias</span><span class="font0"> among his followers&nbsp;he assigned a homestead </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(keredium)</span><span class="font0"> of two jugera, equal to&nbsp;about an acre and a quarter. These </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">heredia</span><span class="font0"> were to be held&nbsp;by him and his heirs for ever </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(quae heredem sequerentur);</span><span class="font0"> Pliny&nbsp;adding that to none did the king give more. This can only&nbsp;be accepted as a partially correct account of what may have&nbsp;taken place at some early period during the kingly regime.&nbsp;There can be little doubt that a portion of the Roman territory, gradually augmented through new conquests, was early&nbsp;reserved by the state as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ager publicus*,</span><span class="font0"> that is sufficiently&nbsp;attested by the complaints made for centuries by the plebeians&nbsp;of its monopolization by the patricians. It is also probable&nbsp;that </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">heredia (i.e.</span><span class="font0"> plots of land within the city) may have been&nbsp;granted to the heads of the gentile families, many of whom&nbsp;would be living in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">pagi</span><span class="font0"> on their respective gentile lands outside&nbsp;the city. Such </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">heredia</span><span class="font0"> became family property, administered&nbsp;as such by the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias,</span><span class="font0"> but inalienable by him. In this&nbsp;respect the position would be very similar to what existed&nbsp;among the ancient Germans and exists to-day in India among&nbsp;the Hindus.

<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@2</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One or two writers of the later Empire (e.g. Servius, in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Georg.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">i. 31) describe </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">coemptio</span><span class="font0"> as a mutual purchase, the man and woman&nbsp;taking alternately the position of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">emptor</span><span class="font0"> and using nuncupatory&nbsp;words as such ; but this seems to be a misapprehension and not&nbsp;consistent with what Gaius says.
