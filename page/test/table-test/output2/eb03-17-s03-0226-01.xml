contrary to the appointment of Jeſus Chriſt, and the practice of the apoſtles, when they filled up the firſt vacancy in the apoſtolic college, and appointed the election of deacons and elders in the primitive church.— Many of thoſe alſo who were thought to be the beſt friends of the church, expreſſed their fears that this act would have a tendency to overturn the eccleſiaſtical conſtitution which was eſtabliſhed at the Revolution.</p><p>Mr Ebenezer Erſkine miniſter at Stirling diſtinguiſhed himſelf by a bold and determined oppoſition to the meaſures of the aſſembly in 1732. Being at that time moderator of the ſynod of Perth and Stirling, he opened the meeting at Perth with a ſermon from Pſalm cxviii. 22. “The ſtone which the builders rejected is become the head ſtone of the corner.” In the courſe of his ſermon he remonſtrated with no ſmall degree of freedom againſt the add of the preceding aſſembly with regard to the ſettlement of miniſters, and alleged that it was contrary to the word of God and the eſtabliſhed conſtitution of the church. A formal complaint was lodged againſt him for uttering ſeveral offenſive expreſſions in his ſermon before the ſynod. Many of the members declared that they heard him utter nothing but found and ſeaſonable doctrine; but his accuſers inſiſting on their complaint, obtained an appointment of a committee of ſynod to collect what were called the offenſive expreſſions, and to lay them before the next diet in writing. This was done accordingly; and Mr Erſkine gave in his anſwers to every article of the complaint. After three days warm reaſoning on this affair, the ſynod by a majority of ſix found him cenſurable; againſt which ſentence he proteſted, and appealed to the next general aſſembly. When the aſſembly met in May 1733, it affirmed the ſentence of the ſynod, and appointed Mr Erſkine to be rebuked and admoniſhed from the chair. Upon which he proteſted, that, as the aſſembly had found him cenſurable, and had rebuked him for doing what he conceived to be agreeable to the word of God and the ſtandards of the church, he ſhould be at liberty to preach the ſame truths, and to teſtify againſt the ſame or ſimilar evils, on every proper occaſion. To this proteſt Meſſrs William Wilſon miniſter at Perth, Alexander Moncrief miniſter at Abernethy, and James Fiſher miniſter at Kinclaven, gave in a written adherence, under the form of inſtrument; and theſe four withdrew, intending to return to their reſpective charges, and act agreeably to their proteſt whenever they ſhould have an opportunity. Had the affair reſted here, there never would have been a ſeceſſion; but the aſſembly reſolving to carry on the proceſs, cited them by their officer to compear next day. They obeyed the citation; and a committee was appointed to retire with them, in order to perſuade them to withdraw their proteſt. The committee having reported that they ſtill adhered to their proteſt, the aſſembly ordered them to appear before the commiſſion in Auguſt following and retract their proteſt; and if they ſhould not comply and teſtify their ſorrow for their conduct, the commiſſion was empowered to ſuſpend them from the exerciſe of their miniſtry, with certification that if they ſhould act contrary to ſaid ſentence, the commiſſion ſhould proceed to an higher cenſure.</p><p>The commiſſion met in Auguſt accordingly; and the four miniſters ſtill adhering to their proteſt, were ſuſpended from the exerciſe of their office, and cited to the next meeting of the commiſſion in November following. From this ſentence ſeveral miniſters and elders, members of the commiſſion, diſſented. The commiſſion met in November, and the ſuſpended miniſters compeared. Addreſſes, repreſentations, and letters from ſeveral lynods and preſbyteries, relative to the buſineſs now before the commiſſion, were received and read. The ſynods of Dumfries, Murray, Roſs, Angus and Mearns, Perth and Stirling, craved that the commiſſion would delay proceeding to an higher cenſure. The ſynods of Galloway and File, as alſo the preſhytery of Dornoch, addreſſed the commiſſion for lenity, tenderneſs, and forbearance, towards the ſuſpended miniſters; and the preſhytery of Aberdeen repreſented, that, in their judgment, the ſentence of ſuſpenſion inflicted on the foreſaid miniſters was too high, and that it was a ſtretch of eccleſiaſtical authority. Many members of the commiſſion reaſoned in the ſame manner, and alleged that the act and ſentence of laſt aſſembly did not oblige them to proceed to an higher cenſure at this meeting of the commiſſion. The queſtion, however, was put, Proceed to an higher cenſure, or not? and the votes being numbered, were found equal on both ſides: upon which Mr John Goldie the moderator gave his caſting vote to proceed to an higher cenſure; which ſtands in their minutes in theſe words: “The commiſſion did and hereby do looſe the relation of Mr Ebenezer Erſkine miniſter at Stirling, Mr William Wilſon miniſter at Perth, Mr Alexander Moncrief miniſter at Abernethy, and Mr James Fiſher miniſter at Kinclaven, to their reſpective charges, and declare them no longer miniſters of this church; and do hereby prohibit all miniſters of this church to employ them, or any of them, in any miniſterial function. And the commiſſion do declare the churches of the ſaid miniſters vacant from and after the date of this ſentence.”</p><p>This ſentence being intimated to them, they proteſted, that their miniſterial office and relation to their reſpective charges ſhould be held <hi rend="italic">as</hi> valid as if no ſuch ſentence had paſſed; and that they were now obliged to make a <hi rend="italic">ſecession</hi> from the prevailing party in the eccleſiaſtical courts; and that it ſhall be lawful and warrantable for them to preach the goſpel, and diſcharge every branch of the paſtoral office, according to the word of God and the eſtabliſhed principles of the church of Scotland. Mr Ralph Erſkine miniſter at Dunfermline, Mr Thomas Mair miniſter at Orwel, Mr John M'Laren miniſter at Edinburgh, Mr John Currie miniſter at Kinglaſſie, Mr James Wardlaw miniſter at Dunfermline, and Mr Thomas Nairn miniſter at Abbotſhal, proteſted againſt the ſentence of the commiſſion, and that it ſhould be lawful for them to complain of it to any ſubſequent general aſſembly of the church.</p><p>The ſeceſſion properly commenced at this date. And accordingly the ejected miniſters declared in their proteſt that they were laid under the diſagreeable neceſſity of ſeceding, not from the principles and conſtitution of the church of Scotland, to which, they ſaid, they ſtedfaſtly adhered, but from the preſent church-courts, which had thrown them out from miniſterial communion. The aſſembly, however, which met in May 1734 did ſo far modify the above ſentence, that they empowered the ſynod of Perth and Stirling to receive the ejected<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0233.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0227"/>
miniſters into the communion of the church, and reſtore them to their reſpective charges; but with this expreſs direction, “that the ſaid ſynod ſhould not take upon them to judge of the legality or formality of the former procedure of the church judicatories in relation to this affair, or either approve or cenſure the ſame.” As this appointment neither condemned the act of the preceding aſſembly nor the conduct of the commiſſion, the ſeceding miniſters conſidered it to be rather an act of grace than of juſtice, and therefore they ſaid they could not return to the church-courts upon this ground; and they publiſhed to the world the reaſons of their refuſal, and the terms upon which they were willing to return to the communion of the eſtabliſhed church. They now erected themſelves into an eccleſiaſtical court, which they called the As <hi rend="italic">ſociated Preſbytery,</hi> and preached occaſionally to numbers of the people who joined them indifferent parts of the country. They alſo publiſhed what they called an Act, <hi rend="italic">Declarations and Testimony,</hi> to the doctrine, worſhip, government, and diſcipline of the church oſ Scotland, and againſt ſeveral inſtances, as they ſaid, of defection from theſe, both in former and in the preſent times. Some time arter this ſeveral miniſters of the eſtabliſhed church joined them, and the Aſſociated Preſhytery now conſiſted of eight miniſters. But the general aſe ſembly which met in 1738 finding that the number of Seceders was much increaſed, ordered the eight miniſters to be ſerved with a libel, and to be cited to the next meeting of the aſſembly in 1739. They now appeared at the bar as a conſtituted preſbytery, and having formally declined the aſſembly’s authority, they immediately withdrew. The aſſembly which met next year depoſed them from the office of the miniſtry; which, however, they continued to exerciſe in their reſpective congregations, who ſtill adhered to them, and erected meeting-houſes, where they preached till their death. Mr James Fiſher, the laſt ſurvivor oſ them, was, by an unanimous call in 1741, tranſlated from Kinclaven to Glaſgow, where he continued in the exerciſe of his miniſtry among a numerous congregation, reſpected by all ranks in that large city, and died in 1775 much regretted by his people and friends. In 1745 the ſeceding miniſters were become ſo numerous, that they were erected into three different preſbyteries, under one ſynod, when a very unprofitable dispute divided them into two parties.</p><p>The burgeſs oath in ſome of the royal boroughs of Scotland contains the following clauſe: “I profeſs and allow with my heart the true religion preſently profeſſed within this realm, and authoriſed by the laws thereof. I will abide at and defend the ſame to my life’s end, renouncing the Romiſh religion called <hi rend="italic">Papistry</hi> Meſſrs Ebenezer and Ralph Erſkine, James Fiſher, and others, affirmed that this clauſe was no way contrary to the principles upon which the ſeceſſion was formed, and that therefore every Seceder might lawfully ſwear it. Meſſrs Alexander Moncrief, Thomas Mair, Adam Gib, and others, contended on the other hand</p><p>that the ſwearing oſ the above clauſe was a virtual renunciation of their teſtimony. And this controverſy was ſo keenly agitated, that they ſplit into two different parties, and now meet in different ſynods. Thoſe or them who affert the lawfulneſs of ſwearing the burgeſs oath are called <hi rend="italic">Burghers,</hi> and the other party wſho condemn it are called A <hi rend="italic">ntiburgher Seceders.</hi> Each party claiming to itſelf the lawful conſtitution of the <hi rend="italic">Aſſociate Synod,</hi> the Antiburghers, after ſeveral previous ſteps, excommunicated the Burghers on the ground of their fin and of their contumacy in it. This rupture took place in 1747, ſince which period no attempts to effect a reunion have been ſucceſsful. They remain under the juriſdiction of different ſynods, and hold ſeparate communion, although much of their former hoſtilſty has been laid aſide. The Antiburgſhers conſider the Burghers as too lax and not Efficiently ſtedfaſt to their teſtimony. The Burghers on the other hand contend that the Antiburghers are too rigid, in that they have introduced new terms of communion into the ſociety. The Antiburghers having adopted ideas with regard to what they call <hi rend="italic">covenanting,</hi> wſhich the Burghers never approved<note anchored="true" n="1" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="smallcaps">(a)</hi> This is the account which the Burghers give of their own notions reſpecting the covenant. One of the moſt enlightened of their opponents, however, aſſure us that they acknowledge covenanting to be a <hi rend="italic">moral duty,</hi> and that the ſolemn vows of our anceſtors are obligatory. But ſince the breach in the ſynod they have never engaged in this work; giving, as their reaſon, that this is not the proper ſeaſon.</p></note> <hi rend="smallcaps">(a),</hi> have been in uſe of renewing in their ſeveral congregations the Scottiſh Covenant, by cauſing their people formally ſwear to maintain it. In other reſpects the differences between the two parties are not material. The Antiburghers are moſt numerous on the north of the Tay, and the Burghers on the ſouth of it.</p><p>What follows in this article is a further account of thoſe who are commonly called the <hi rend="italic">Burgher Seceders.</hi> Theſe have a greater number of people in their communion than the Antiburghers, and for ſome years paſt they have greatly increaſed in the ſouthern and weſtern diſtricts of Scotland. As there were among them from the commencement of their ſeceſſion ſeveral ſtudents who had been educated at one or other of the univerſities, they appointed one of their miniſters to give lectures in theology, and train up candidates for the miniſtry. Meſſrs William Willon miniſter at Perth and Alexander Moncrief miniſter at Abernethy were their proſefſors of theology before their ſeparation from the Antiburgſhers.</p><p>Since that period Mr Ebenezer Erſkine miniſter at Stirling, Mr James Fiſher miniſter at Glaſgow, Mr John Swanſton miniſter at Kſhroſs, and Mr John Brown miniſter at Haddington, have ſucceeded each other in this office. At preſent (1794) Mr George Eawſon miniſter at Selkirk is their profeſſor of theology, and there are between thirty and forty ſtudents who attend his lectures annually. The number of their miniſters is about an hundred, and each of their congregations contain from two hundred and fifty to three thouſand perſons; and there are among them at preſent more than twenty vacant charges. Where a congregation is very numerous, as in Stirling, Dunfermline, and Perth, it is formed into a collegiate charge, and provided with two miniſters. They are erected into ſix dif-<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0234.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0228"/>
ferent preſbyteries, united in one general ſynod, which commonly meets at Edinburgh in May and September<note anchored="true" n="2" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="smallcaps">(b)</hi> The conſtitution of the Antiburgher church differs very little from that of the Burghers. The ſupreme court among them is deſigned <hi rend="italic">The General Aſſociate Synod,</hi> having under its juriſdiction three provincial ſynods in Scotland and one in Ireland. In the former country there are eleven preſhyteries; in the latter, four. They have a few congregations in England, and a preſbytery in connection with them in North America. The number of miniſters belonging to the general ſynod is a hundred and thirty-ſeven; and in Scotland there are nineteen vacancies. They, as well as the Burgher Seceders, have a profeſſor of theology, whoſe lectures every candidate for the office of a preacher is obliged to attend, we have been told, for no leſs than five or ſix ſeſſions! Surely the ſeſſion muſt be of ſhort duration,</p></note> <hi rend="smallcaps">(b).</hi> They have alſo a ſynod in Ireland compoſed of three or four different preſbyteries. They are legally tolerated in Ireland; and government ſome years ago granted L.500 <hi rend="italic">per annum</hi>, and oſ late an additional L. 500, which, when divided among them, affords to each miniſter about L. 20 over and above the ſtipend which he receives from his hearers. Theſe have beſides a preſbytery in Nova Scotia; and ſome years ago, it is ſaid, that the Burgher and the Antiburgher miniſters reſiding in the United States formed a coalition and joined in a general ſynod, which they call the <hi rend="italic">Synod</hi> of <hi rend="italic">New York</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Penn</hi> ſ <hi rend="italic">ylvania.</hi> They all preach the doctrines contained in the Weſtminſter Confeſſion of Faith and Catechiſms, as they believe theſe to be founded on the ſacred ſcriptures. They catechiſe their hearers publicly, and viſit them from houſe to houſe once every year. They will not give the Lord’s ſupper to thoſe who are ignorant of the principles of the goſpel, nor to ſuch as are ſcandalous and immoral in their lives. They condemn private baptiſm, nor will they admit thoſe who are groſsly ignorant and profane to be ſponſors for their children. Believing that the people have a natural right to chooſe their own paſtors, the ſettlement of their miniſters always proceeds upon a popular election; and the candidate who is elected by the majority is ordained among them. Convinced that the charge of ſouls is a truſt of the greateſt importance, they carefully watch over the morals of their ſtudents, and direct them to ſuch a courſe of reading and ſtudy as they judge moſt proper to qualify them for the profitable diſcharge of the paſtoral duties. At the ordination of their miniſters they uſe a <hi rend="italic">formula</hi> of the ſame kind with that of the eſtabliſhed church, which their miniſters are bound to ſubſcribe when called to it; and if any of them teach doctrines contrary to the ſcriptures or the Weſtminſter Confeſſion of Faith, they are ſure of being thrown out of their communion. By this means uniformity of ſentiment is preſerved among them; nor has any of their miniſters, excepting one, been proſecuted for error in doctrine ſince the commencement of their ſeceſſion.</p><p>They believe that the holy ſcriptures are the ſole criterion of truth, and the only rule to direct mankind to glorify and enjoy God, the chief and eternal good; and that “the Supreme Judge, by which all controverſies of religion are to be determined, and all the decrees of councils, opinions of ancient writers, doctrines of men and private ſpirits, are to be examined, and in whoſe ſentence we are to reſt, can be no other but the Holy Spirit ſpeaking in the ſcriptures.” They are fully perſuaded, however, that the ſtandards of public authority in the church of Scotland exhibit a juſt and</p><p>conſiſtent view of the meaning and deſign of the holy ſcriptures with regard to doctrine, worſhip, government, and dilcipline; and they in ſo far differ from the diſſenters in England, in that they hold theſe ſtandards to be not only articles of peace and a teſt of orthodoxy, but as a bond of union and ſellowſhip. They conſider a ſimple declaration of adherence to the ſcriptures as too equivocal a proof of unity in ſentiment, becauſe Arians, Socinians, and Arminians, make ſuch a confeſſion of their faith, while they retain ſentiments which they (the Seceders) apprehend are ſubverſive of the great doctrines of the goſpel. They believe that Jeſus Chrift is the only King and Head of the Church, which is his body; that it is his ſole prerogative to enact laws for the government, of his kingdom, which is not of this world; and that the church is not poſſeſſed of a legiſlative, but only of an executive power, to be exerciſed in explaining and applying to their proper objects and ends thoſe laws which Chriſt hath publiſhed in the ſcriptures, Thoſe doctrines which they teach relative to faith and practice are exhibited at great length in an explanation of the Weſtminſter Aſſembly’s Shorter Catechiſm, by way of queſtion and anſwer, in two volumes, compoſed chiefly by Mr James Fiſher late of Glaſgow, and publiſhed by deſire of their ſynod.</p><p>For theſe fifty years paſt, the grounds of their ſeceſſion, they allege, have been greatly enlarged by the public adminiſtrations of the eſtabliſhed church, and particularly by the uniform execution of the law respecting patronage, which, they ſay, has obliged many thouſands of private Chriſtians to withdraw from the pariſh- churches and join their ſociety.</p><p>It is certain, however, that their number has rapidly increaſed of late, eſpecially in the large cities of the kingdom. They have three different congregations in Edinburgh, two in Glaſgow, and two in London, beſides ſeveral others in the north of England. In moſt of their congregations they celebrate the Lord’s ſupper twice in the year, and they catechiſe their young people concerning their knowledge of the principles of religion previouſly to their admiſſion to that ſacrament. When any of them fall into the ſin of fornication or adultery, the ſcandal is regularly purged according to the form of proceſs in the eſtabliſhed church; and thoſe of the delinquents who do not ſubmit to adequate cenſure are publicly declared to be fugitives from diſcipline, and are expelled the ſociety. They never accept a ſum of money as a commutation for the offence. They condemn all clandeſtine and irregular marriages, nor will they marry any perſons unleſs they have been proclaimed in the pariſh church on two different Lord’s days at leaſt.</p><p>When they ſeparated from the eſtabliſhed church, they remained firm in their attachment to the ſtate; and<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0235.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0229"/>
they were not many years formed into a diſtinct ſociety, when they expelled from their communion a Mr Thomas Nairn miniſter at Kirkcaldy, who had taught doctrines inimical to the civil governmcnt of the nation. In 1745 there was not one of their number who joined the then pretender to the Britiſh crown. They are ſtill of the ſame ſentiments; and in their public aſſemblies they always pray for our ſovereign King George, with the royal family, and for all who are in authority under them. They are ſo far from wiſhing the overthrow of the preſent civil government, that when the nation was lately in danger of being thrown into a fermentation by the circulation of inflammatory and ſeditious writings, they warmly recommended peace and order in ſociety<note anchored="true" n="3" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>( c ) All this is ſaid of the Burgher Seceders; but we hope it is equally true of thoſe who are ſtyled. Antiburghers. There are indeed ſome clauſes in the Covenant which they ſwear to maintain, that ſeem not, at firſt view, very friendly to civil ſubordination; but let not thoſe who entertain any apprehenſion on this account, forget that one of the moſt uſeful defences of the Britiſh conſtitution, occaſioned by the late factious ſpirit of democratic innovation, came from the pen of Dr Young the Antiburgher miniſter at Hawick. See Young's Essays.</p></note> (c). No legal diſqualifications, as in the caſe of the diſſenters in England, exclude them from any place of public truſt in the municipal government of the country; and ſome of them are frequently in the magiſtracy of the royal boroughs. They are not, however, legally tolerated, but are ſupported by the mildneſs of adminiſtration and the liberal ſpirit of the times. Avowing their adherence to the doctrines contained in the public ſtandards of the church of Scotland, together with the preſbyterian form of government, from which they never intended to ſecede, they deny that they are either ſchiſmatics or ſectaries, as they have been frequently called: and when they withdrew from the eccleſiaſtical courts, they did not, they ſay, conſtitute a church of their own, different from the national church, but profeſs to be a part of that church, endeavouring to hold by her reformed principles, in oppoſition to thoſe deviations from them which they have ſpecified in their</p><p><hi rend="italic">Act and Testimony.</hi> Moſt of them live in habits of friendſhip and intimacy with their brethren of the eſtabliſhment, and they profeſs an affectionate regard for all thoſe of every denomination who love Jeſus Chriſt in ſincerity and truth. In the late re-exhibition of their teſtimony, they have declared to the world, that, were the grounds of their ſeceſſion happily removed, they would account it one of the moſt ſingular felicities of their time to return with pleaſure to the communion of the eſtabliſhed church.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
