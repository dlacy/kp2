<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">with Antigonus, and affiſt him in his wars againſt all </span><span class="font1">ſtates and princes except Ptolemy king of Egypt ; and&nbsp;that,Tor the effectual performance of the articles ſtipu-lated between them, they ſhould deliver ioo hoſtages,&nbsp;ſuch as Demetrius ſhould make choice of, except thoſe&nbsp;who bore any public employment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Thus was the ſiege raiſed, after it had continued a whole year ; and the Rhodians amply rewarded all&nbsp;thoſe who had diſtinguiſhed themſelves in the ſervice&nbsp;of their country. They alſo ſet up ſtatues to Ptolemy,&nbsp;Caffander, and Lyſimachus ; to all of whom they paid&nbsp;the higheſt honours, eſpecially to the ſirſt, whom they&nbsp;worſhipped as a god. Demetrius at his departure preſented them with the helepolis, and all the other machines which he had employed in battering the city ;&nbsp;from the ſale of which, with ſome additional ſums of&nbsp;their own, they erected the famous coloffus. After this&nbsp;they applied themfelves entirely to trade and navigation ; by which means they became quite maſters of the&nbsp;ſea, and much more opulent than any of the neigh-bouring nations. As far as lay in their power, they&nbsp;endeavoured to preſerve a neutrality with regard to the&nbsp;jarring nations of the eaſt. However, they could not&nbsp;avoid a war with the Byzantines, the occaſion oſ which&nbsp;was as follows : The Byzantines being obliged to pay&nbsp;a yearly tribute of 80 talents to the Gauls, in order to&nbsp;raife this ſum, they came to a refolution of laying a toll&nbsp;on all ſhips that traded to the Pontic ſea. This reſolu-tion provoked the Rhodians, who were a trading nation, above all the reſt. For this reafon they immedi-ately diſpatched ambaſſadors to the Byzantines, complaining of the new tax ; but as the Byzantines had no&nbsp;other method of ſatisfying the Gauls, they perfiſted in&nbsp;their reſolution. The Rhodians now declared war,&nbsp;and prevailed upon Pruſſas king of Bithynia, and Attalus king of Pergamus, to affiſt them ; by which&nbsp;confederacy the Byzantines were ſo intimidated, that&nbsp;they agreed to exact no toll from ſhips trading to the&nbsp;Pontic ſea, the demand which had been the occaſion of&nbsp;the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">About this time happened a dreadful earthquake, which threw down the coloſſus, the arſenal, and great&nbsp;part of the city-walls of Rhodes </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">y</span><span class="font1"> which calamity the&nbsp;Rhodians improved to their advantage, ſending ambaſſadors to all the Grecian princes and ſtates, to whom&nbsp;their loſſes were ſo much exaggerated, that their countrymen obtained immenſe ſums of money under pretence&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font1">repairing them. Hiero king of Syracuſe preſented&nbsp;them with 100 talents ; and, beſides, exempted from all&nbsp;tolls and duties ſuch as traded to Rhodes. Ptolemy&nbsp;king of Egypt gave them </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ico </span><span class="font1">talents, a million of mea-fures of wheat, materials for building 20 quinqueremes&nbsp;and the like number of triremes ; and, beſides, ſent&nbsp;them 100 architects, 300 workmen, and materials for&nbsp;tepairing their public buildings, to a great value, pay-ing them moreover 14 talents a-year for the mainte-nance of the workmen whom he ſent them. Antig©-Bus gave them 100 talents of ſilver, with 10,000 pieces&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font1">timber, each piece being 16 cubits long ; 7000&nbsp;planks ; 3000 pounds of iron, as many of pitch and re-Jin, and 1000 meaſures of tar. Chryſeis, a woman of&nbsp;diftinction, ſent them 100,000 meaſures of wheat, and&nbsp;3000 pounds of lead. Antiochus exempted from all&nbsp;taxes and duties the Rhodian ſhips trading to his do-</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ttinioas i preſented them with 10 galley </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">s, and 200,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">meafures of c®rn, with many other things of great </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">va</span><span class="font1">lue. Pruſias, Mithridates, and all the princes then reigning in Aſia, made them proportionable preſents :&nbsp;in ſhort, all the Greek towns and nations, all the princes&nbsp;of Europe and Aſia, contributed, according to their&nbsp;ability, to the relief ©f the Rhodians on that occa«&nbsp;ſion ; inſomuch that their city not only ſoon rofe from&nbsp;its ruins, but attained to an higher pitch of ſplendor&nbsp;than ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the year 203 B. C. the Rhodians engaged in a war with Philip of Macedon. This monarch had invaded the territories of Attalus king of Pergamus ; and&nbsp;becauſe the Rhodians ſeemed to favour their ancient&nbsp;friend, ſent one Heraclides, by birth a Tarentine, to&nbsp;ſet ſirc to their fleet ; at the ſame time that he diſpatch-ed ambaffadors into Crete, in order to ſtir up the Cretans againſt the Rhodians, and prevent them from ſending any affiſtance to Attalus. Upon this war was im-mediately proclaimed. Philip at ſiril gained an incon-ſiderable advantage in a naval engagement ; but the&nbsp;next year was defeated with the lofs of 11,000 men,&nbsp;while the Rhodians loſt but 60 men and Attalus 70.&nbsp;After this he carefully avoided coming to an engagement at ſea either with Attalus or the Rhodians. The&nbsp;combined fleet, in the mean time, faffed towards the&nbsp;iſland of Ægina in hopes of intercepting him : but having failed in their purpoſe, they failed to Athens,&nbsp;where they concluded a treaty with that people ; and,,&nbsp;on their return, drew all the Cyclades into a confederacy againſt Philip. But while tlie allies were thus-walling xheir time in négociations, Philip, having divided his forces into two bodies, ſent one, under the cum·&nbsp;rhand of Philocles, to ravage the Athenian territories £&nbsp;and put the other aboard his fleet, with orders to ſail&nbsp;to Meronea·, a city on the north ſide of Thrace. He&nbsp;then marched towards that city himſelf with a body of&nbsp;forces, took it by affault, and reduced a great many&nbsp;others ; ſo that the confederates would, in all pro-bability, have had little reaſon to boaſt of their ſuc-ceſs, had not the Romans come to their afliftance, by&nbsp;whoſe help the war was foon terminated to their advantage. In the war which took place between the&nbsp;Romans and Antiochus the Great king of Syria, the&nbsp;Rhodians were very uſeful allies to the former. </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">beſt part of their fleet was indeed delhoyed by a trea-cherous contrivance of Polyxeniades the Syrian admi-ral ; but they ſoon fitted out another, and defeated </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">Syrian iquudron commanded by the celebrated Hannibal, the Carthaginian commander ; after which, in con-junction with the Romans, they utterly defeated the&nbsp;whole Syrian fleet commanded by Polyxeniades ; which,&nbsp;together with the lofs of the battle of Magneſia, ſo di-ſpirited Antiochus, that he ſubmitted to whatever </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">eon-</span><span class="font1">ditions the Romans pleaſed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For theſe ſerviees the Rhodians were rewarded with the provinces oſ Lycia and Cana ; but tyrannizing&nbsp;over the people in a terrible manner, the Lycians applied to the Romans for protection. This was readily&nbsp;granted ; but the Rhodians were ſo much diſpleaſed&nbsp;with their interfering in this matter, that they ſecretly&nbsp;favoured Perſes in the war which broke out between&nbsp;him and the Roman republic. For this offence the&nbsp;two provinces above-mentioned were taken ſrom them ;&nbsp;but the Rhodians, having baniſhed or put death thoſe&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">who had favoured Perſes, were again admitted </span><span class="font1">into ſa-VOUTj</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
