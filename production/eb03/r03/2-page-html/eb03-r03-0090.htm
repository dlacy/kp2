<p><span class="font0">election oſ Sigiſmund I. a prince of a mild and peaceable diſpoſition, he ſent an army into Lithuania, and laid ſiege to Smolenſko. The place made a brave reſiſtance, till news arrived that the crown-troops of Poland were coming to their aſſiſtance, with the additional aid of 80,000 Crim Tartars ; on which the Ruffians returned home with the utmoſt precipitation.&nbsp;They were, however, quickly followed by the Poles,&nbsp;who reduced the czar, to ſubmit to ſuch terms as they&nbsp;pleaſed to impoſe. Baſilius remained quiet till he&nbsp;thought himſelf capable of revenging the injuries he&nbsp;had ſuſtained ; after which, pretending to ſet out upon&nbsp;ſome other expedition, he marched with a numerous&nbsp;army, and encamped in the neighbourhood of Pleſkow,&nbsp;where the Poles, prefuming∙ on the late treaty, received him as a friend and ally. But in the mean time&nbsp;the Muſeovite prieſts oſ the Greek church preached to&nbsp;their hearers concerning the expediency of having a fovereign of their own religion ; and brought them to&nbsp;ſuch a height of enthufιafm,that they murdered their magiſtrates, and opened their gates to the czar, who made&nbsp;them all ilaves, and ſent them away' to different parts,&nbsp;replacing them with Muſcovites, the better to ſecure&nbsp;his conqueſt. Soon after he took alſo the city of Smolenſko ; and the Swedes, alarmed at his rapid progreſs,&nbsp;deſired a prolongation of the truce, at that time ſub-liſting between the two ſtates, for 6o years longer.&nbsp;The duchy of Lithuania was the great object of the&nbsp;deſigns of Baſilius ; and to accompliſh his deſign,&nbsp;he ordered Ivan Czeladin, a man of great reſolution,&nbsp;and enterprifing even to raſhneſs, to march thither with&nbsp;80,000 men. The army of the Poles did not exceed&nbsp;35,000 men, but was commanded by a moſt experienced general. The two armies met on the oppoſite&nbsp;banks oſ the Dneiper, near Orſova, and the Poles paffed that river in fight of their enemies. Czeladin’s&nbsp;officers adviſed him to fall upon the enemy when about&nbsp;half of them had croſſed the river ; but that general,&nbsp;too confident of ſucceſs, replied, that the other half&nbsp;would then run away, and he was determined to gain&nbsp;a complete victory. The Lithuanians began the attack,&nbsp;but were repulſed by the Ruffians ; who imprudently&nbsp;following them, loſt an advantageous ſituation, and&nbsp;found themſelves at once expoſed to the full fire of the&nbsp;enemy’s artillery. The Poliſh cavalry then ruſhed&nbsp;in among them ſword in hand, and made dreadful&nbsp;havoc ; the trembling Ruffians ſcarce even attempting to defend themſelves. Thoſe who endeavoured&nbsp;to fly, fell into the Dneiper and'were drowned ; and&nbsp;all the reſt, including Czeladin himſelf, were made&nbsp;ſlaves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Baſilius was at Smolenſko when he received the news of this dreadful defeat ; on which he immediately fled*&nbsp;to Moſcow, where his danger increaſed daily. The&nbsp;Crim-Tartars ravaged his dominions, and the emperor Maximilian, with whom he had been in alliance,&nbsp;deſerted him ; his troops, were utterly defeated in Iri-vonia, where he was obliged to ſubmirto a peace on&nbsp;diſhonourable terms ; but what theſe terms were hiſtorians do not inform.us. In the mean time, the king&nbsp;of Poland ſtirred up the Tartars to invade Ruſſia,&nbsp;while the Ruffian monarch in his turn endeavoured to&nbsp;excite them to an invaſion of Poland. Theſe barbarians, equally treacherous to both parties, firſt invaded and ravaged Podolia, a province of Poland ; and&nbsp;then having invaded Ruſſia and defeated the armies of&nbsp;the czar in the year 1521, they poured in thither in&nbsp;ſuch incredible multitudes, that they quickly made&nbsp;themſelves maſters of Moſcow. An army, which had&nbsp;been ſent to oppoſe their progreſs, was defeated near&nbsp;the riveT Occa ; and the czar’s brother Andrew, who&nbsp;commanded it, was the very firſt who fled. Baſilius&nbsp;with great difficulty made his way to Novogorod ; ſo&nbsp;terrified, that he hid himſelf by the way under a haycock, to avoid a ſtraggling party of the enemy. The&nbsp;Tartars, however, ſoon obliged him to ſign a writing,&nbsp;by which he acknowledged himſelf their vaſſal, and&nbsp;promiſed to pay, them a tribute of ſo much a head for&nbsp;every one of his ſubjects. Beſides this, Machmetgerei,&nbsp;the commander of the Tartars, cauſed his own ſtatuq&nbsp;to be ſet up at Moſcow, as a mark of his ſovereignty;&nbsp;compelled Baſilius to return to his capital, to bring&nbsp;thither in perſon the firſt payment of this tribute, and<sub>i&nbsp;</sub>as a token of his ſubmiſſion, to proſtrate himſelf before&nbsp;his ſtatue. Machmetgerei then left Moſcow, and returned home with an immenſe booty, and upwards of&nbsp;80,000 priſoners, who were made ſlaves, and ſold like&nbsp;cattle to the Turks and other enemies of the Chriſtian&nbsp;name. In his way back.he attempted to take the city&nbsp;of Rezan ; but was repulſed with conſiderable loſs by&nbsp;I wan Ko wen, who commanded in that place for the&nbsp;Ruffians. Here the Tartar general narrowly eſcaped&nbsp;with his life, his coat being ſhot through with a mu-ſket-ball ; andthe Muſcovites pulled down his ſtatue,&nbsp;and broke it to pieces as ſoon as the conquerors had left&nbsp;them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Tartars were no ſooner gone, than Baſilius began to talk in a high ſtrain of the revenge he intended to take of them ; but was never abſe to execute his&nbsp;threats. He died in 1533 ; and was ſucceeded by his&nbsp;ſon Ivan or John Baſilovitz, an infant of -five years&nbsp;of age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">During the minority of the young prince, his two uncles Andrew and George endeavoured to deprive&nbsp;him of the crown; but their attempts were defeated by&nbsp;the care and activity of his guardians ; and the Poles&nbsp;alſo immediately commenced hoſtilities, but could make&nbsp;little progreſs. The new czar, as ſoon a3 he entered&nbsp;the 19th year of his age, ſhowed an inclination ſor re-ſeuing his ſubjects out of that deſperate ſtate of ignorance and barbariſm in which they had been hitherto&nbsp;immerſed. Pie ſent a ſplendid embaſſy to the emperor&nbsp;Charles V. who was then at Augſhurg, to deſire the&nbsp;renewal of the treaty of friendſhip which had been concluded with his father Maximilian ; and offering to enter into a league with him againſt the Turks, as enemies to the Chriſtian religion ; for his farther information in which, particularly in regard to the doctrine&nbsp;and ceremonies of the Latin church, he requeſted that&nbsp;his ambaſſador might be allowed to ſend from Germany&nbsp;to Ruſſia proper prieſts to inſtruct him and his ſubjects.&nbsp;With theſe he likewiſe deſired to have ſome wiſe and&nbsp;experienced ſtateſmen, able to civilize the wild people&nbsp;under his government ; and alſo, the better to help to&nbsp;poliſh them, he requeſted that he would ſend mechanics and artiſts of every kind ; in return ſor all which&nbsp;he offered to furniſh two tons of gold yearly, for 20&nbsp;years together, to be employed in the war againſt the&nbsp;Turks. The emperor readily agreed to the deſire of&nbsp;the czar ; and the Ruffian ambaſſador accordingly en-</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
