the habit of the officiating clergy in the church of England. By Can. 58, every miniſter ſaying the public prayers, or miniſtering the ſacrament or other rites of the church, ſhall wear a decent and comely ſurplice with ſleeves, to be provided at the charge of the pariſh. But by 1 Eliz. c. 2. and 13 and 14 Car. II. the garb preſcribed by act of parliament, in the ſecond year of king Edward the Sixth, is enjoined : and this requires that in the ſaying or ſinging of matins and even ſongs, baptizing and burying, the miniſter in pariſh churches and chapels ſhall uſe a ſurplice. And in all cathedral churches and colleges, the archdeacon, dean, provoſts, maſters, prebendaries, and fellows, being graduates, may uſe in the choir, beſides their surplices, ſuch hoods as pertain to their ſeveral degrees. But in all other places every miniſter ſhall be at liberty to uſe a ſurplice or not. And hence in marrying, churching of women, and other offices not ſpecified in this rubric, and even in the adminiſtration of the holy communion, it ſeems that a ſurplice is not neceſſary. Indeed for the holy communion the rubric appoints a white ALB plain, which differs from the ſurplice in being cloſe-ſleeved, with a veſtment or cope.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
