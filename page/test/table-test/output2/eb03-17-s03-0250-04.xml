(John), called by Grotius <hi rend="italic">the glory of England,</hi> was born at Salvington in Suſſex in 1584. He was educated at the free-ſchool at Chicheſter; whence he was sent to Hart-Hall in the univerſity of Oxford, where he ſtaid four years. In 1612, he entered himſelf in Clifford’s Inn, in order to ſtudy the law ; and about two years after removed to the Inner Temple, where he soon acquired great reputation by his learning. He had already publiſhed ſeveral of his works ; and this year wrote verſes in Latin, Greek, and Engliſh, upon Mr William Browne’s Britannia’s Paſtorals. In 1614, he publiſhed his Titles of Honour; and in 1616, his Notes on Sir John Forteſcue’s book <hi rend="italic">De Laudibus Legum Angliae.</hi> In 1618,he publiſhed his Hiſtory of Tythes ; which gave great offence to the clergy, and was animadverted upon by ſeveral writers ; and for that book he was called before the high commiſſion court, and obliged to make a public acknowledgment of his sorrow for having publiſhed it. In 1621, being sent for by the parliament, though he was not then a member of that houſe, and giving his opinion very ſtrongly in favour of their privileges in oppoſition to the court, he was committed to the cuſtody of the ſheriff of London, but was ſet at liberty after five weeks confinement. In 1623, he was choſen burgeſs for Lancaſter ; but, arnidſt all the diviſions of the nation, kept himſelf neuter, proſecuting his ſtudies with ſuch application, that though he was the next year choſen reader of Lyon’s Inn, he refilled to perform that office. In 1625, he was choſen burgeſs for Great Bedwin in Wiltſhire, to ſerve in the firſt parliament of king Charles I. in which he declared himſelf warmly againſt the duke of Buckingham ; and on his Grace’s being impeached by the Houſe of Commons, was appointed one of the managers of the articles againſt him. In 1627 and 1628, he oppoſed the court party with great vigour. The parliament being prorogued to January 20. 1629, Mr Selden retired to the earl of Kent’s houſe at Wreſt, irr Bedfordſhire, where he finiſhed his <hi rend="italic">Marmora Arundeliana.</hi> The parliament being met, he, among others, again diſtinguiſhed himſelf by his zeal againſt the court; when the king diſſolving the parliament, ordered ſeveral of the members to be brought before the King’s-Bench bar, and committed to the Tower. Among theſe was Mr Selden, who insisting on the benefit of the laws, and refuſing to make his submiſſion, was removed to the King’s Bench priſon. Being here in danger of his life on account of the plague then raging in Southwark, he petitioned the lord high treaſurer, at the end of Trinity-term, to intercede with his Majeſty that he might be removed to the Gate-Houſe, Weſtminſter, which was granted : but in Michaelmas term following, the judges objecting to the lord treaſurer’s warrant, by which he<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0257.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0251"/>
had been removed to the Gate-houſe, an order was made for conveying him back to the King’s Bench, whence he was releaſed in the latter end of the ſame year ; but fifteen years after, the parliament ordered him 5000 l. for the loſſes he had ſuſtained on this occaſion. He was afterwards committed, with ſeveral other gentlemen, for diſperſing a libel ; but the author, who was abroad, being discovered, they were at length ſet at liberty. In 1634, a diſpute ariſing between the Engliſh and Dutch concerning the herring-fiſhery on the Britiſh coaſt, he was prevailed upon by archbiſhop Laud to draw up his M <hi rend="italic">are Clauſum,</hi> in anſwer to Grotius’s <hi rend="italic">Mare Liberum :</hi> which greatly recommended him to the favour of the court. In 1640, he was choſen member for the univerſity of Oxford ; when he again opposed the court, though he might, by complying, have raised himſelſ to very conſiderable posts. In 1643, he was appointed one of the lay-members to sit in the aſſembly of divines at Weſtminſter, and was the ſame year appointed keeper of the records in the Tower. Whilſt he attended his duty in the aſſembly, a warm debate aroſe reſpecting the diſtance of Jericho from Jeruſalem. The party which contended for the ſhorteſt diſtance, urged, as a proof of their opinion being well founded, that fiſhes were carried from the one city to the other, and sold in the market. Their adverſaries were ready to yield to the force of this concluſive argument, when Selden, who deſpiſed both parties, as well as the frivoloulneſs of their diſpute, exclaimed, “ Perhaps the fiſhes were ſalted !” This unexpected remark left the victory doubtful, and renewed the debate ; and our author, who was ſick of ſuch trifling, soon found employment more ſuited to his genius ; for, in 1645, he was made one of the commiſſioners of the admiralty. The ſame year he was unanimouſly elected maſter of Trinity-college, Cambridge ; but declined accepting. He died in 1654; and was interred in the Temple-church, where a monument is erected to his memory. Dr Wilkes obſerves, that he was a man of uncommon gravity and greatneſs of foul, averſe to flattery, liberal to ſcholars, charitable to the poor; and though he had great latitude in his principles with regard to ecclefiaſtical power, yet he had a ſincere regard for the church of England. He wrote many learned works beſides thoſe already mentioned ; the principal of which are, 1. <hi rend="italic">De Jure Naturali</hi> &amp;  <hi rend="italic">Gentium juxta Disciplinam Hebraeorum.</hi> 2. <hi rend="italic">De Nuptiis &amp;  Divοrciis. 3. De Anno Civili veterum Hebraeorum.</hi> 4. <hi rend="italic">De Nummis.</hi> 5. <hi rend="italic">De Diis Syris. 6. Uxor Hebraica. 7. Jani Anglorum Facies altera,</hi> &amp; c. All his works were printed together in 1726, in 3 vols folio.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
