The framework of the story&nbsp;is borrowed from a popular </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">märchen</span><span class="font0"> of the youth who takes&nbsp;service away from home, and is paid in wise saws instead of&nbsp;current coin. He receives at the same time a loaf, with&nbsp;instructions not to cut it until he is once more at home. This&nbsp;contains the coins. The proverbs, usually three in number,&nbsp;were increased in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ruodlieb</span><span class="font0"> to twelve, each of which was the&nbsp;starting-point of an episode by which the hero was made to&nbsp;appreciate its value.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RUPAR, a town of British India, in Umballa, district of the Punjab, on the left bank of the river Sutlej, 43 m. N. of&nbsp;Umballa, 1120 ft. above sea-level. Pop. (1901) 8888. It was&nbsp;the scene of Ranjit Singh’s visit to Lord William Bentinck&nbsp;when governor-general in 1831. Here are the head works of&nbsp;the Sirhind canal.

<p><span class="font0">RUPEE (Hindustani </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rupiya,</span><span class="font0"> from Sanskrit </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rupya),</span><span class="font0"> the standard coin of the monetary system in India. A silver&nbsp;coin of 175 grains Troy, called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">lanka,</span><span class="font0"> approximating to the&nbsp;rupee, was struck by the Mahommedan rulers of Delhi in&nbsp;the 13th century; but the rupee itself, of 179 grains, was&nbsp;introduced by Sher Shah in 1542. The English at first followed&nbsp;various indigenous standards; but since 1835 the rupee has&nbsp;uniformly weighed 180 grains, containing 165 grains of pure&nbsp;silver. The weight of the rupee (one </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">tola)</span><span class="font0"> is also the unit&nbsp;upon which the Indian standard of weights is based. Down&nbsp;to about 1873 the gold value of the rupee was 2s., and ten&nbsp;rupees were thus equal to £1; but after 1873, owing to the&nbsp;depreciation of silver, the rupee at one time sank as low in&nbsp;value as is. In order to provide a remedy the government&nbsp;of India decided in 1893 to close the mints, and in 1899 to&nbsp;make the rupee legal tender at fifteen to £1. This policy&nbsp;proved successful, and since 1899 the exchange value of the&nbsp;rupee has practically remained at is. 4d. Therefore a&nbsp;lakh of rupees, which before 1873 was worth £10,000, is now&nbsp;only worth £6666, and a crore of rupees, which was formerly&nbsp;a million sterling, now only amounts to £666,666. The rupee&nbsp;is divided into sixteen annas, now worth id. each, and the&nbsp;anna is subdivided into 12 pies. (See India, and Money.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RUPERT (Hrodbert), ST, according to the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Gesla Sancti Hrodberti,</span><span class="font0"> which dates from the 9th century, was a kinsman&nbsp;of the Merovingian house, and bishop of Worms under Childe-bert III. (695-711). At the invitation of the duke of Bavaria,&nbsp;Theodo II., Rupert went to Regensburg (Ratisbon), where&nbsp;he began his apostolate. He founded the church of St Peter&nbsp;near the Wallersee, and subsequently, at Salzburg, the church&nbsp;of St Peter, together with a monastery and a dwelling for the&nbsp;clerks, as well as a convent for women <sup>11</sup> in superiori Castro&nbsp;Iuvavensium.” He died and was buried at Salzburg. He&nbsp;is regarded as the apostle of the Bavarians, not that the land&nbsp;was up to that time altogether heathen, but because of his&nbsp;services in the promotion and consolidation of its Christianity.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RUPERT, PRINCE, </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Count Palatine oe the Rhine and Duke of Bavaria (1619-1682), third son of the elector palatine&nbsp;and “ winter king ” of Bohemia, Frederick </span><span class="font0">V., and of Elizabeth,&nbsp;daughter of James I. of England, was born at Prague on the&nbsp;17th of December 1619. A year later his father was defeated at&nbsp;the Battle of the Weisser-Berg, near Prague, and driven from&nbsp;Bohemia. After many wanderings the family took refuge in&nbsp;Holland, where Rupert’s boyhood was spent. In 1633 the boy&nbsp;was present at the siege of Rheinberg in the suite of the Prince&nbsp;of Orange, and in 1635 he served in this prince’s bodyguard.&nbsp;In 1636 he paid his first visit to. England, was entered as an&nbsp;undergraduate, though only nominally, at St John’s College,&nbsp;Oxford, and was named as the governor of a proposed English&nbsp;colony in Madagascar. But this scheme did not mature, and&nbsp;Charles sent his nephew back to Holland, having, however,&nbsp;formed a high opinion of his energy, talent and resolution. In&nbsp;1637 he was again serving in the wars, and in 1638, after displaying conspicuous bravery, he was taken prisoner by the&nbsp;imperialists at the action of Vlotho (17th October) and held&nbsp;in a not very strict captivity for three years. In 1641 he was&nbsp;released, and, rejoinifig his mother in Holland, was summoned&nbsp;to England to the assistance of his uncle, for the Great Rebellion&nbsp;was about to break out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In July 1642 he landed at Tynemouth. Charles at once made him general of the horse and independent of Lord&nbsp;Lindsey, the nominal commander of the whole army. From&nbsp;this point until the close of the first Civil War in 1646 Prince&nbsp;Rupert is the dominant figure of the war. His battles and.&nbsp;campaigns are described in the article Great Rebellion.&nbsp;He was distinctively a cavalry leader, and it was not until the&nbsp;battle of Marston Moor in 1644 that the Royalist cavalry was&nbsp;beaten. The prince’s strategy was bold' as well as skilful,&nbsp;as was shown both in the Royalist movements of 1644 which&nbsp;he proposed, and in the two far-ranging expeditions which he&nbsp;carried out for the relief of Newark and of York. In November&nbsp;1644, in spite of the defeat at Marston Moor, he was appointed&nbsp;general of the king’s army. But this appointment, though&nbsp;welcome to the army, was obnoxious to the king’s counsellors,&nbsp;who resented the prince’s independence of their control, to&nbsp;some of the nobility over whose titles to consideration he had&nbsp;ridden roughshod, and to some of the officers whose indiscipline&nbsp;and rapacity were likely to be repressed with a heavy hand.&nbsp;These dissensions culminated, after the prince’s surrender of&nbsp;Bristol to Fairfax, in a complete break with Charles, who&nbsp;dismissed him from all his offices and hade Rupert and his&nbsp;younger brother Maurice seek their fortunes beyond the seas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rupert’s character had been tempered by these years of responsible command. By 1645, although the parliamentary&nbsp;party accused him not merely of barbarity but of ingratitude&nbsp;for the kindnesses which his family had received from English&nbsp;people in the days of the Palatinate War, Rupert had in fact&nbsp;become a good Englishman. He was convinced, after Marston&nbsp;Moor, that the king’s cause was lost, in a military sense, and&nbsp;moreover that the king’s cause was bad. When he surrendered&nbsp;Bristol without fighting to the uttermost, it was because Fairfax placed the political issue in the foreground, and after the&nbsp;capitulation the prince rode to Oxford with his enemies, frankly&nbsp;discussing the prospect of peace. Already he had deliberately&nbsp;advised Charles to make peace, and had come to be suspected,&nbsp;in consequence, by Charles’s optimistic adviser Digby. But to&nbsp;Charles himself the news of the fall of Bristol was a thunderbolt.&nbsp;“ It is the greatest trial to my constancy that has yet befallen&nbsp;me,” he wrote to the prince, “ that one that is so near to me in&nbsp;blood and friendship submits himself to so mean an action.”&nbsp;Rupert was deeply wounded by the implied stain on his honour;&nbsp;he forced his way to the king and demanded a court-martial.&nbsp;The verdict of this court smoothed over matters for a time, but&nbsp;Rupert was now too far estranged from the prevailing party at&nbsp;court to be of any assistance, and after further misfortunes and&nbsp;quarrels they separated, Charles to take refuge in the camp of&nbsp;the Scots, Rupert to stay, as a spectator without command,&nbsp;with the Oxford garrison. He received at the capitulation a&nbsp;pass from the parliament to leave England, as did also his&nbsp;faithful comrade Maurice.</span></p>
