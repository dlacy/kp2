        <p><span class="font3">The space between the north-west end of the Forum and the Tabularium
                is occupied by a range of important buildings (see Plate&nbsp;VII.). The chief of
                these is the temple of Concord (see Festus, ed.&nbsp;Müller, p. 347) shown on a
                fragment of the marble plan, founded&nbsp;by Camillus in 367 b.c. (Plut.,

                depth, and a very large projecting&nbsp;portico. Its construction is an interesting
                example of the Roman&nbsp;use of many different materials. The lower part of the
                walls was&nbsp;of massive tufa blocks, the upper part of the cella of travertine
                ;&nbsp;and the inner low wall, which supported ranges of internal columns,&nbsp;was
                of mixed concrete, tufa, and travertine. The whole was lined&nbsp;with marble, white
                outside, and rich Oriental marbles inside (see&nbsp;fig. 5), which were also used
                for the pavement. The door-sill is&nbsp;made of enormous blocks of porta santa
                marble, in which a bronze&nbsp;Caduceus (emblem of Concord) was inlaid. Between the
                internal&nbsp;columns of the cella stood rows of statues ; and the temple
                also&nbsp;contained a large collection of pictures, engraved gems, gold
                and&nbsp;silver plate, and other works of art, mostly the work of ancient&nbsp;Greek
                artists (see Plin., </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"

        <p><span class="font3">The arch of Severus stands by the rostra, across the road on the
                north-east side of the Forum ; the remains of the ancient travertine&nbsp;curb show
                that originally the road went along a rather different&nbsp;line, aud was probably
                altered to make room for this great arch.&nbsp;It was built in 203 a.d., after
                victories in Parthia, and was originally set up in honour of Severus and his two
                sons Caracalla (here&nbsp;called M. Aurelius Antoninus) and Geta. Caracalla, after
                murdering Geta, erased his name from all monuments to his honour in&nbsp;Rome.
                Representations of the arch on coins of Severus show that&nbsp;its attic was
                surmounted by a chariot of bronze drawn by six&nbsp;horses, in which stood Severus
                crowned by Victory ; at the sides&nbsp;were statues of Caracalla and Geta, with an
                equestrian statue at&nbsp;each angle. The arch, except the base, which is of
                marble-lined&nbsp;travertine, is built of massive blocks of Pentelic marble, and
                has&nbsp;large crowded reliefs of victories in the East, showing much decadence from
                the best period of Roman art.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font3">The central space of the Forum is paved with slabs of travertine,
                much patched at various dates ; it appears to have been marked&nbsp;out into
                compartments with incised lines (see Plate VII.), the use&nbsp;of which is not
                    known.@@<sup>12</sup> Numerous clamp-holes all over the&nbsp;paving show where
                statues and other ornaments once stood. The&nbsp;recorded number of these is very
                great, and they must once have&nbsp;thickly crowded a great part of the central
                area. Two short marble&nbsp;walls or plutei covered with reliefs, discovered in
                1872, stand on the&nbsp;north side. Their use and original position are not known,
                as the&nbsp;rough travertine plinth on which they have been set is evidently&nbsp;of
                late date. Each of these marble screens has (on the inside)&nbsp;reliefs of a fat
                bull, boar, and ram, decked out with sacrificial&nbsp;wreaths and vittæ—the
                Suovetaurilia. On the outside are scenes&nbsp;in the life of Trajan : one has the
                emperor seated on a suggestus&nbsp;instituting a charity for destitute children in
                99 a.d.—a scene&nbsp;shown also in one of his first brasses—with the legend
