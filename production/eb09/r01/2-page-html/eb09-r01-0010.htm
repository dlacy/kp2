<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">RABIES, a virulent disease, developed primarily in and peculiar to the canine species. Its occurrence in the&nbsp;same manner in other carnivorous animals, as the fox,&nbsp;wolf, hyæna, jackal, raccoon, badger, and skunk, has been&nbsp;asserted ; but there is every probability that it is originally&nbsp;a disease of the dog. It is communicated by inoculation&nbsp;to nearly all, if not all, warm-blooded creatures. The transmission from one animal to another only certainly takes&nbsp;place through inoculation with viruliferous matters. The&nbsp;malady is generally characterized at a certain stage by an&nbsp;irrepressible desire in the animal to act offensively with&nbsp;its natural weapons,—dogs and other carnivora attacking&nbsp;with their teeth, herbivora with their hoofs or horns, and&nbsp;birds with their beaks, when excited ever so slightly. In&nbsp;the absence of excitement the malady may run its course&nbsp;without any fit of fury or madness. Transmission of the&nbsp;disease to man produces </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Hydrophobia </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.)</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> or dread of&nbsp;water, but in animals this symptom is rarely, if ever,&nbsp;observed. Rabies has been known from the very earliest&nbsp;times, and serious outbreaks have been recorded as occurring among dogs, wolves, and foxes in different parts of&nbsp;the world, particularly in western Europe and in North&nbsp;and South America. It is very frequent in Europe and&nbsp;appears to be on the increase. France, Germany, upper&nbsp;Italy, and Holland evidently suffer more than other Continental countries. England is becoming more frequently&nbsp;visited than before, though Scotland and Ireland are much&nbsp;less troubled than England. Spain is also sometimes&nbsp;severely scourged by it; but it is rare in Portugal. On&nbsp;the American continent it is well known, though on the&nbsp;eastern side of the Andes it is rarely if ever seen ; and it&nbsp;has never been heard of in Quito. In the West Indies&nbsp;—in Hispaniola, Jamaica, Domingo, Havana, Guadaloupe,&nbsp;and Hayti—as well as in Ceylon, it is frequently witnessed, and in 1813 it was introduced into Mauritius. It&nbsp;exists in North and South China, and has been reported&nbsp;in Cochin China and the kingdom of Anam. It is frequent and fatal in India ; and it is by no means rare in&nbsp;Syria, Palestine, and Turkey. It has been observed in&nbsp;the Hijâz in Arabia, and in North Africa and Egypt.&nbsp;Hydrophobia has been reported in Algeria; but Rohlfs&nbsp;asserts that it is unknown in Morocco. Gibraltar and&nbsp;Malta have been seriously invaded at times, and in Sweden,&nbsp;Denmark, Norway, Russia, and Lapland it has been frequently seen in an epizootic form ; but it is not yet&nbsp;positively decided whether it exists in the Arctic regions.&nbsp;Steller and Erman assert that it is unknown in Kamchatka and Greenland; but Hayes </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(The Open Polar Sea)&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">gives us the particulars of an outbreak of disease in&nbsp;South Greenland, which persisted for several years, caused&nbsp;him the loss of his sledge-dogs in 1870, and in 1872&nbsp;extended from Smith’s Sound to Jakobshavn, threatening&nbsp;the utter extinction of the species, and with it the disappearance of the Eskimo. In most of its features it&nbsp;appeared to be rabies. The scourge is unknown, according to reliable evidence, in Australia and New Zealand,&nbsp;Tasmania, the Azores, and St Helena, as well as the island&nbsp;of Madeira ; it has not been seen at Sumatra, nor in East,&nbsp;South, and West Africa, nor in the island of Réunion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Rabies (hydrophobia) is almost invariably fatal in man, and in the dog it nearly always terminates in death, though&nbsp;instances of recovery are recorded ; and it is extremely&nbsp;probable that in those cases in which people have been&nbsp;bitten by dogs and subsequently perished from hydrophobia, without the animals themselves offering any marked&nbsp;indications of illness either at the time or afterwards, these&nbsp;have been suffering from a mild form of the disease. It&nbsp;is also fatal to horses, cows, pigs, goats, and cats, but not&nbsp;to fowls, many of these recovering from accidental or&nbsp;experimental inoculation. Indeed rabies varies consider-</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ably in intensity and in the character of its symptoms in different species of creatures. Pasteur has shown that, if&nbsp;it is transmitted from the diseased dog to the monkey&nbsp;and ultimately from monkey to monkey, at each transmission it becomes more attenuated in virulence, and&nbsp;remains so attenuated when passed again to the dog,&nbsp;rabbit, or guinea-pig, nor will it any longer produce the&nbsp;disease in dogs by hypodermic inoculations. Even inoculation by trepanning the cranium, which is so infallible in&nbsp;conveying rabies, may produce no result, the dog thenceforward being protected, and no longer capable of receiving&nbsp;the disease. On the other hand, the rabific virus is intensified when passed from rabbit to rabbit, or from&nbsp;guinea-pig to guinea-pig; and after several transmissions&nbsp;through the bodies of these animals it regains the maximum virulence which it possessed before it was enfeebled&nbsp;by being passed through the monkey. And the same thing&nbsp;holds with respect to the virulence of the ordinary rabid&nbsp;dog: when virus which is far from having reached its&nbsp;maximum intensity is conveyed to the rabbit, it requires&nbsp;to be passed through several of these animals before it&nbsp;reaches its maximum. It may be mentioned that the&nbsp;disease is not readily conveyed from man to animals,&nbsp;either accidentally or experimentally. The virus appears&nbsp;to exist in greatest intensity in the salivary glands and&nbsp;their secretion, in the brain and spinal cord, and perhaps&nbsp;to a lesser degree in the blood; doubtless it exists also in&nbsp;other fluids and tissues of the diseased animal. The&nbsp;principal alterations found in the bodies of rabid animals&nbsp;after death are located in the spinal cord, especially its&nbsp;upper portion, the medulla oblongata, certain parts of&nbsp;the brain, and the salivary glands, more particularly the&nbsp;submaxillary and sublingual,—less in the parotid. The&nbsp;stomach, kidneys, and other organs also present alterations which are more or less significant, especially the&nbsp;former, in which foreign bodies, as hair, wood, stones,&nbsp;earth, pieces of cloth, &amp;c., are very frequently found.&nbsp;But the nature of the lesions, as well as the symptomatology, shows that the action of the poison is more especially&nbsp;exerted on the brain or spinal cord, though the eighth&nbsp;pair of nerves, and branches of the fifth and seventh pairs,&nbsp;are not involved in animals, as in man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The period in which the symptoms of the disease become manifest, especially after accidental inoculations, as bites,&nbsp;varies extremely; indeed there is no disease in which the&nbsp;period of latency or incubation is more variable or pro״&nbsp;tracted, this being sometimes limited to a few days or&nbsp;weeks and extending in rare cases to more than twelve&nbsp;months. In experimental inoculations the period is greatly&nbsp;shortened and the results more certain,—all the more so&nbsp;if the virus is introduced into the cranial cavity by trepanning, or into the blood-stream by intravenous inoculation.&nbsp;In accidental inoculations, as in wounds from rabid dogs,&nbsp;a certain but varying percentage escape. This immunity&nbsp;may be due to natural non-receptivity, to the wound not&nbsp;having been inflicted in a very vascular part, or to the&nbsp;saliva having been expended from frequent bites on other&nbsp;animals, or intercepted by clothing, hair, wool, &amp;c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Symptoms.</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">—The disease has been divided into three stages or periods, and has also been described as appearing in at least two&nbsp;forms, according to the peculiarities of the symptoms. But, as a&nbsp;rule, one period of the disease does not pass suddenly into another,&nbsp;the transition being almost imperceptible; and the forms do not&nbsp;differ essentially from each other, but appear merely to constitute&nbsp;varieties of the same disease, due to the natural disposition of the&nbsp;animal, or other modifying circumstances. These forms have been&nbsp;designated </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">true</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">furious rabies</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> (Fr. </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">rage vrai</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">; Germ, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">rasende&nbsp;JVuth)</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">dumb rabies</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> (Fr. </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">rage mue</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> ; Germ, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">stille Wuth</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The malady does not commence with fury and madness, but in a strange and anomalous change in the habits of the dog : it becomes&nbsp;dull, gloomy, and taciturn, and seeks to isolate itself in out-of-the-way places, retiring beneath chairs and to odd corners. But in&nbsp;its retirement it cannot rest: it is uneasy and fidgety, and no</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
