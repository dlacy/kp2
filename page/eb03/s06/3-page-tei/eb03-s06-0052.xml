And, on the other hand, divine indefeaſible hereditary right, when coupled with the doctrine of unlimited pasſive obedience, is ſurely of all conſtitutions the moſt thoroughly ſlaviſh and dreadful. But when ſuch an hereditary right as our laws have created and veſted in the royal ſtock, <hi rend="italic">is</hi> closely interwoven with thoſe liberties which are equally the inheritance of the ſubject ; this union will form a conſtitution, in theory the moſt beautiful of any, in practice the moſt approved, and, we truſt, in duration the moſt permanent.</p><p>In France the ſucceſſion to the monarchy was limited to heirs male (ſee <hi rend="smallcaps">Salic) ; </hi>but in Navarre the crown was inherited by the heir of line, whether male or female. The caſe ſtands thus: Philip the Fourth, king of France, ſurnamed <hi rend="italic">the Fair,</hi> in the year 1285 eſpoused Jane queen of Navarre in her own right ; and as king consort of this latter kingdom added the title of Navarre to his former one of France. Louis X. ſon and heir oſ Philip and Jane (ſurnamed H<hi rend="italic">utin,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">Boisterous),</hi> ſucceeded to both crowns. By Margaret his firſt wife, who had been crowned queen of Navarre, he left one daughter Joan or Jane. His ſecond wife Clementia was pregnant at the time of his deceaſe, and was delivered of a poſthumous ſon, whom moſt of the French annaliſts recognize as John I. of France, though he lived no longer than three weeks. On his death the kingdom of France paſſed to Philip V. (ſurnamed the <hi rend="italic">Long), </hi>and that of Navarre (to which the Salic law could by no conſtruction extend) to Joanna the only child and heir of Louis and Margaret. From Joanna, in lineal ſucceſſion, the kingdom of Navarre paſſed to Jane d'Αlbret, mother of Henry IV. of France, and wife of Anthony of Vendoſme, who as king confort wore the crown of Navarre. On the acceſſion of Henry to the kingdom of France, the two monarchies were united, and the four ſucceeſting princes aſſumed the joint titles. But if ever the monarchy be reſtored in France, Mary, princeſs royal and daughter of Louis XVI. will have the same right to the throne of <hi rend="smallcaps">Navarre</hi> that her uncle has to the throne of France ; for ſhe is the undoubted heir of line of the great and illuſtrious Henry IV.</p><p>SUCCINIC <hi rend="smallcaps">Acid,</hi> an acid extracted from amber by ſublimation in a gentle heat, and riſes in a concrete form into the neck of the ſubliming veſſel. The operation muſt not be puſhed too far, or by too ſtrong a fire, otherwise the oil of the amber riſes along with the acid. The ſalt is dried upon blotting paper, and purified by repeated ſolution and cryſtallization.</p><p>The acid is ſoluble in 24 times its weight of cold water, and in a much ſmaller quantity of hot water. It poſſeſſes the qualities of an acid in a very ſmall degree, and only affects the blue vegetable colours very lightly. The affinities of this acid with the ſalifiable baſes were determined by Mr de Morveau, who is the firſt chemiſt that has endeavoured to aſcertain them.</p><p>SUCCINUM, <hi rend="smallcaps">Amber,</hi> in mineralogy, a ſpecies of bitumen claſſed under the inflammable ſubſtances. As a full account of this mineral was given under the word <hi rend="smallcaps">Amber, </hi>nothing remains but to mention a few things which recent experiments enable us to add. According to Dr Kirwan, 100 grains of amber afford about 72 of petroleum, 4.5 of ſuccinic acid, and a reſidue of fixed matter and water. Mr Scheele ſays, that, when diſtilled, it yields an aqueous acid reſembling vinegar in its qualities. This would induce us to believe it to be of vegetable origin. But its origin is a point not yet aſcertained. Its ſpecific gravity is from 1,065 to 1,100, and melts at 550⁰ of Fahrenheit. Wallerius affirms, that mirrors, priſms, &amp;c. may be made of amber.</p><p>SUCCORY, in botany.

He discovered an uncommon propenſity to the acquiring of languages, inſomuch that he is reported to have ſpoken Latin at five years of age, and to have written it at nine. When he was grown up, he travelled ; but seems to have affected nothing more than the character of a courtier and fine gentleman ; which he ſo far attained, that he was allowed to have the peculiar happineſs of making every thing he did become him. In his travels he made a campaign under the great Guſtavus Adolphus ; and his loyalty, if not his valour, appeared in the beginning of our civil wars ; for, after his return to England, he raiſed a troop of horſe for the king’s ſervice entirely at his own charge ; and mounted them ſo completely and richly, that they are ſaid to have coſt him 12,000 l. This troop, with Sir John at its head, behaved ſo ill in the engagement with the Scots, upon the English borders, in 1639, as to occasion the famous lampoon compoſed by Sir John Mennis ; “ Sir John he got him an ambling nag,” &amp;c. This ballad, which was ſet to a briſk tune, was much ſung by the parliamentarians, and continues to be ſung to this day. This diſaſtrous expedition, and the ridicule that attended it, was ſuppoſed to have haſtened his death ; being ſeized by a fever, of which he died, at 28 years of age. He was a ſprightly wit, and an eaſy versifier, but no great poet. His works, conſiſting of a few poems, letters, and plays, have nevertheleſs gone through ſeveral editions.</p><p>SUCTION, the act of ſucking or drawing up a fluid, as air, water, milk, or the like, by means of the mouth and lungs ; or, in a ſimilar manner, by artificial means.
