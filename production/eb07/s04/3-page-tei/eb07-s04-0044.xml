Still many of them preferred independence under severe privations amidst the wild rocks of the Asturias, to abundance and plenty on the fertile plains of Murcia. At the head of those who sought a refuge in this mountain sanctuary was Pelayo, a prince of royal Gothic blood, and who is recognised by Spanish historians as having acceded to the throne in 718; Theo domir, the legitimate monarch, having ingloriously submitted to the yoke of the infidel. Numbers of his countrymen flocked to his standard, and his force became at length so formidable as to create alarm in the Saracens. A large army was despatched to the Asturias to crush the rising insurrection ; but in attempting to gain the position where Pelayo and his resolute followers were strongly posted, the Moors were repulsed with a slaughter so terrible, that for some years they showed no inclination to assail their for midable neighbours. Various successes followed, and the Asturias, now left in the undisturbed possession of Pelayo and his band, became the asylum of the liberty and the re ligion of the Christians in Spain. It formed the nucleus of a kingdom, which was destined slowly but surely to increase in size from century to century, until the invaders were finally expelled from the Peninsula. Little more is known of Pelayo, than that he gained repeated victories over the Moors, and died in peace in 737. He was succeeded by his son Favila, whose reign was brief and his end tragical, he having been killed by a wild boar in 739. The subsequent history of Spain is rendered so confused by the numerous kingdoms established by Christians and Moors, that some chronological guide is necessary to render it intelligible. We shall therefore present a chronological list of the various sovereigns who reigned over different parts of the country, which had been erected into distinct and independent sovereignties. The dates given mark the years in which the sovereigns acceded to the throne ; the intervening periods, of course, indicate the du ration of their respective reigns. We shall commence with the Mahommedan succession, as during the earlier centu ries the greater part of Spain was subject to the Moors.</p><p>MAHOMMEDAN RULERS OF SPAIN.—CORDOVA.</p><p>1.	<hi rend="italic">Emirs.—</hi>Tarik ben Zeyad and Musa ben Nozeir, 711.
