<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">chap, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">v!,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Theology,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> n<sup>0</sup> 8, 9.) But ſurely it </span><span class="font0">would be raſh to infer, either that every truth for&nbsp;which, when it is known, the ingenuity of man can&nbsp;frame </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font0">demonſtration, is therefore </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">diſcover able</span><span class="font0"> by human ſagacity, or that all the truths which have been&nbsp;diſcovered by a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Newton</span><span class="font0"> or a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lot he</span><span class="font0"> might therefore&nbsp;have been diſcovered by untaught barbarians. In mathematical foiençe, there are few demonſtrations of ea-fier comprehenſion than that given by Euclid, of the&nbsp;theorem of which Pythagoras is the reputed author ;&nbsp;yet no man ever dreamed that a boy capable of being&nbsp;made to undeιſtand that theorem, muſt therefore have&nbsp;ſagacity equal to the fagc of Samos; or that ſuch a boy,&nbsp;having never heard of the relation between the hypo-then uſe and other two ſides of a right angled triangle,&nbsp;would be likely to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">diſcover</span><span class="font0"> that the ſquare ot the former&nbsp;js preciſely equal to the ſum of the ſquares of the latter.&nbsp;Juſt fo it feems to be with the fundamental truths of&nbsp;theology. There can hardly be conceived a demonſtration lefs intricate, or more concluſive, than that which&nbsp;the man of ſcience employs to prove the exiſtence of at&nbsp;leaſt one God, poſſeſſed of boundleſs power and perfect&nbsp;wiſdom. And could we ſuppoſe that the human race had&nbsp;remained without any knowledge oſ God in the world,&nbsp;till certain lucky individuals had by ſome means or other&nbsp;made themſelves maſters oſ the rules oſ logic, and the&nbsp;philoſophy of cauſes, there can be no doubt but that&nbsp;theſe individuals might have diſcovered the exiſtence of&nbsp;ſuperior powers, and communicated their diſcovery to&nbsp;their aiſociates and followers. But this iuppofitιon&nbsp;cannot be admitted, as it is contradicted by the evidence&nbsp;of all hiſtory. No nation or tribe has ever been found,&nbsp;in which there is not reafon to believe that fome notions&nbsp;were entertained of fuperior and inviſible powers, upon&nbsp;which depends the happinefs or mifery of mankind :&nbsp;and from the moſt authentic records cf antiquity, it is&nbsp;apparent that very pure principles of theiſm prevailed&nbsp;in ſome nations long before the rules of logic, and the&nbsp;philoſophy of cauſes, were thought of by any people&nbsp;under heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The ſuppoſition before us is inadmiſſible upon other accounts. Some modern philoſophers have fancied that&nbsp;the original progenitors of mankind were left entirely to&nbsp;themſelves from the moment ot their creation; that they&nbsp;wandered about for ages without the uſe of ipeech and&nbsp;in the loweſt ſtate of ſavagiſin ; but that they gradually&nbsp;civilized themſelves, and at laſt ſtumbled upon the contrivance of making articulate founds ſignificant of ideas,&nbsp;which was followed by the invention of arts and ſciences, with all the bleſſings of religion and legiſlation in&nbsp;their train. But this is a wild reverie, inconſiſtent with&nbsp;the phenomena of human nature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is a well known fact, that a man blind from his birth, and fuddeπly made to ſee, would not by means <sup>,</sup>cf&nbsp;his newly acquired ſenſe diſcern either the magnitude&nbsp;or figure or diſtance of objects, but would conceive every thing which communicated to him viſible ſenſations&nbsp;as inſeparably united to his eye or his mind (See Me-taphysics, n° 49—53)· How long his ienle of ſight&nbsp;would remain in ſuch an imperfect ſtate, we cannot poſitively fay ; but from attending to the viſible ſenſations&nbsp;of infants, we are confident that weeks, if not months,&nbsp;elapſe before they can diſtinguiſh one thing from another. we have indeed been told, that Cheſelden’a fa</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">mous </span><span class="font0">patient, though he was at </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ſirſt </span><span class="font0">in the ſtate which&nbsp;we have deſcribed, learned to diſtinguiſh objects </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">by&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">ſight in the courſe of a few hours, or at the moſt of a&nbsp;few days ; but admitting this to a certain extent to be&nbsp;true, it may eaſily be accounted for. The diſeaſe call-ed a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">cataract</span><span class="font0"> foldυm occaſions total blindneſs ; but let&nbsp;us iuppoie the eyes of this man to have been ſo completely dimmed as to communicate no ſenſation whatever upon being expofed to the rays of light; ſtill we&nbsp;muſt remember that he had long poſſeſſed the power of&nbsp;loco-motion and all his other ſenſes in perfection. He&nbsp;was therefore well acquainted with the real, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i. e,</span><span class="font0"> the&nbsp;tangible magnitude, figure, and diſtance of many υb-jects ; and having been often told that the tilings which&nbsp;he touched would, upon his acquiſition oſ ſight, com-municate new ſeniations to his mind, differing ſrom&nbsp;each other according to the diſtance, figure, and magnitude of the objects by which they were occaſioned,&nbsp;he would foon learn to infer the one ſrom the other,&nbsp;and to diſtinguiſh near objects by means oſ his ſight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Ί he progenitors oſ the human race, however, iſ leſt to themielves from the moment oſ their creation, had&nbsp;not the ſame advantages. when they ſirſt opened&nbsp;their eyes, they had neither moved, nor handled, nor&nbsp;heard, nor ſinelled, nor tailed, nor had a ſingle idea or&nbsp;notion treaſured up in their memories ; but were in alI&nbsp;theſe reſpects in the ſtate oi new-born infants. Now&nbsp;we ſhould be glad to be informed by thoſe ſages who&nbsp;have conducted mankind through many generations in&nbsp;which they were </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">mutum et turpe pecus</span><span class="font0"> to that happy pe-ricd when they invented language, how the ſirſt men&nbsp;were taught to diſtinguiſh objects by their ſenſe of&nbsp;ſight, and how they contrived to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">live</span><span class="font0"> till this moſt ne-ceiſary faculty was acquired ? It does not appear that&nbsp;men are like brutes, provided with a number oſ inilinct⅛&nbsp;which guide them blindfold and without experience to&nbsp;whatever is neceſſary ſor their own preſervation (ſee&nbsp;Instinct) : Ο11 the contrary, all voyagers tell us that,,&nbsp;in ſtrange and uninhabited countries, they dare not venture to taſte unknown fruits unleſs they perceive that&nbsp;theſe fruits are eaten by the fowls of the air. But with-out the aid of inſtinct, or of ſome other guide equally&nbsp;to be depended upon, it is not in our power to conceive&nbsp;how men dropt from the hands of their Creator, and&nbsp;left from that inſtant wholly to themſelvcs, could move&nbsp;a ſingle ſtep without the moſt imminent danger, or&nbsp;even ſtretch out their hands to lay hold of that food&nbsp;which we may ſuppoſe to have been placed within&nbsp;their reach. They could not, for mauy days, diſtinguiſh a precipice from a plane, a rock from a pit, or a&nbsp;■river from the meadows through which it rolled. And&nbsp;in ſuch circumſtances, how could they pofſibly exiſt,&nbsp;till their ſenſe of ſight had acquired ftιch perfection as&nbsp;to be a ſuſſicient guide to all their neceſlary motions </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ί&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">Can any conſiſtent theiſt ſuppoſe that the God whoſe&nbsp;goodneis is lo conſpicuouſiy diſplayed in all his works,&nbsp;would leave his nobleſt creature on earth, a creature ſor&nbsp;whole comfort alone many other creatures ſeem to have&nbsp;been formed, in a ſituation io forlorn as this, where his&nbsp;immediate deſtruction appears to be inevitable ? No !&nbsp;This ſuppoſition cannot be formed, becauſe mankind&nbsp;ſtiil exiſt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">WÜ1 it then be ſaid, that when God formed the ſirſt men, he not only gave them organs of ſenſation, and&nbsp;fouls capable of arriving by diſcipline at the exerciſe of&nbsp;reaιυn, but that he alſo impreiſed upon their minds</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
