None can be given, but faying that the preffure is equivalent to its production ; and this is affirming the very thing he la-bours to prove. The matter of fact is, that the velocity of the jet is greater than that of the ſtream, and may be greater almoſt in any proportion, which curious circumſtance was difcovered and ingeniouſly explained long ago by Daniel Bernoulli in his <hi rend="italic">Hydrodyna-mica.</hi>  It is evident that the velocity muſt be greater, were a ſtream of ſand to come againſt the plane, what goes through would indeed preſerve its velocity unchanged : but when a real ſiuid ſtrikes the plane, all that does not paſs through is deflected on all ſides ; and by theſe deflections forces are excited, by which the filaments which ſurround the cylinder immediately fronting the hole are made to preſs this cylinder on all fides, and as it were ſqueeze it between them : and thus the particles at the hole muſt of neceſſity be accelerated, and the velocity of the jet muſt be greater than that of the ſtream. λVe are diſpoſed to think that, in a fluid perfectly incompreſſible, the velocity will be doubled, or at leaſt increafed in the proportion of ι to √L If the fluid is in the finalleſt degree compreſſible, even in the very ſmall degree that water is, the velocity at the ſirſt impulſe may be much greater. D. Bernoulli found that a column of water moving y feet per ſecond, in a tube ſome hundred feet long, produced a velocity of 136 ſeet per fecond in the firſt moment.</p><p>There being this radical defect in the theory of Mr Euler, it is needleſs to take notice of its total inſuſſi-ciency for explaining oblique impulſesand the refiſtance of curvilineal prows.</p><p>we are extremely ſorry that our readers are deriving ſo little advantage from all that we have ſaid ; and that having taken them by the hand, we are thus obliged to grope about, with only a few ſcattered rays of light to direct our ſteps. Let us ſee what aſſiſtance we can get from Mr d’Alembert, who has attempted a folution of this problem in a method entirely new and extremely ingenious. He ſaw clearly that all the followers of Newton had forſaken thc path which he had marked out for them in the ſecond part of his inveſtigation, and had merely amuſed themſelves with the mathematical difcuſſions with which his introductory hypothefis gave them an opportunity of occupying themſelves. He paid the deſerved tribute oſ applauſe to Daniel Bernoulli for having introduced the notion of pure preſſure as the chief agent in this bufineſs ; and he ſaw that he was in the right road, and that it was from hydroſtati-cal principles alone that we had any chance of explaining the phenomena of hydraulics. Bernoulli had only confidered the preſſures which were excited in conſequence of the curvilineal motions of the particles. Mr d’Alembert even thought that thefe preſſures were not the conſequences, but tlie caufes, of theſe curvilineal motions. No internal motion can happen in a fluid-blit in conſequence of an unbalanced preſſure ; and every</p><p>ſuch motion will produce an inequality of preffure, which will determine the ſucceeding motions. He there-fore endeavoured to reduce all to the diſcovery of thofe diſturbing preſſures, and thus to the laws of hydroſta-tics. Fie had long before this hit on a very refined and ingenious view oſ the action of bodies on each other, which had enabled him to ſolve many of the moſt difficult problems concerning the motions of bodies, ſuch as the centre of oſcillation, of ſpentaneous converſion, the preceſſion of the equinoxes, &amp;c. &amp;c. with great facility and elegance. He ſaw that the fame principle would apply to the action of fluid bodies. The principle is this.</p><p><hi rend="italic">" In whatever manner any number of bodies are ſuppofed to act on each other, and by theſe actions come to change their preſent motions, if we conceive that the motion which each body would have in the following infant ( if it became free), is refolved into two other motions ; one of which is the motion which it really takes in the following infant ; the other will be fuch, that iſ each body had no other motion but this ſecond, the whole bodies would have remained in equilibria.” VIe</hi>  here obſerve, that " the motion which each body would have in the following inſtant, if it became free,” is a continuation of the motion which it has in the firſt inſtant. It may therefore perhaps be better expreſſed thus :</p><p><hi rend="italic">If the motions of bodies, anyhow acting on each other, be cοnfdered in two confecuùve irfants, and if we conceive the motion which it has in the frf infant as compounded of two others, one of which is the motion which it actually takes in the ſecond infant, the other is ſueh, that if each body had only thoſe ſecond motions, the whole fyfem would have remained in equilibrio.</hi></p><p>The propoſition itſelf is evident. For if theſe fe-cond motions be not ſuch as that an equilibrium of thc whole ſyftem would reſult from them, the other component motions would not be thoſe which the bodies really have after the change ; for they would neceſſari. ly be altered by theſe unbalanced motions. See D’A-lembert <hi rend="italic">IIffai de Dynamique.</hi></p><p>Aſſiſted by this inconteſtable principle, Mr d’Alem-bert demonſtrates, in a manner equally new and fimple, thofe propofitions which Newton had ſo cautioufly deduced from his hypothetical fluid, ſhowing that they were not limited to this hypothefis, *u∕z. that the motions produced by fimilar bodies, limilarly projected in them, would be fimilar ; that whatever were the preſ-ſures, the curves deſcribed by the particles would be the ſame ; and that the refiſtance3 would be proportional to the ſquares of the velocities. He then comes to confider the fluid as having its motions conſtrained by the form oſ the canal or by ſolid obſtacles interpoſed.</p><p>we ſhall here give a ſummary account of his fundamental propofitioπ.</p><p>It is evident, that if the body ADCE (fig. 16.) did not form an obſtruction to the motion of the water, the particles would deſcribe parallel lines TF, OK, PS, &amp;c. But while yet at a diſtance from the body in F, K, S, they gradually change their directions, and deſcribe the curves FM, K <hi rend="italic">nι,</hi>  S <hi rend="italic">n,</hi>  fo much more incflrvated as they are nearer to the body. At a certain diſtance ZY this curvature will be inſenſible, and the fluid included in the fpace ZYHQjvill move uniformly as if the fo!id body were not there. The motions on the other fide oi the axis AC will be the ſame ; and we need only</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
