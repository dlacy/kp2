<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">derm of the nutritive polyp. These conclusions not only invalidate Van Beneden’s attractive theory, but tend to&nbsp;overthrow the ordinary view of the alternation of generations in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hydromedusae.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vermes.</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">—The incipient ovary and testis are seen in their simplest expression in such a case as that of the&nbsp;hermaphrodite </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bryozoa,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> or even better in the low Cliseto-pod Worm </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tomopteris</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> (fig. 1), in which a patch of cells&nbsp;of the lining membrane of the&nbsp;coelom proliferate and enlarge&nbsp;into ova, or divide into spermatozoa, fall off, and become extruded. In higher Worms (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lumbricus)</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> the glands become localized in definite segments,&nbsp;and excretory ducts, apparently&nbsp;specialized segmental organs, appear. Among the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Platyhelminthes</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">, on the other hand, the&nbsp;most extraordinary specializations occur. The generative&nbsp;apparatus reaches a complexity which in some respects&nbsp;even excels that of the higher Vertebrates, and which, since&nbsp;it occurs not only among the parasitic forms but also in&nbsp;their less modified free-living allies (if not ancestors), the&nbsp;Turbellarians, must be regarded, not as any mere adaptation to parasitic life, but as an important factor in&nbsp;explaining (by the peculiar advantage which such increased&nbsp;reproductive efficiency affords ; see </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Pakasitism) </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">the wide&nbsp;prevalence of parasitism in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Platyhelminthes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Echinodermata.</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">—Here the reproductive organs are of extreme simplicity—mere lobed glands usually provided&nbsp;with a duct or pore, or sometimes merely bursting into the&nbsp;body-cavity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Arthropoda.</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">—The essential organs never exceed one pair,—a simple median germ-gland being probably, as&nbsp;Gegenbaur suggests, the primitive condition. The accessory organs, however, reach great complexity, especially&nbsp;among the higher </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Insecta.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mollusca.</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">—The lower Lamellibranchs have paired hermaphrodite glands opening in relation to the excretory organs; in the hermaphrodite </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Gasteropoda</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">, however, high&nbsp;complexity of the accessory organs occurs </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{e.g., Helix).</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> In&nbsp;the dioecious Cephalopoda the oviduct is single, and there&nbsp;are remarkable accessory female glands, while in the male&nbsp;the formation of the spermatopliores and the curious modification of an arm for copulatory purposes are noteworthy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tunicata.</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">—In this group (so frequently hermaphrodite) the reproductive apparatus is again greatly reduced, the&nbsp;paired or single sexual glands being sometimes even ductless, while accessory organs are absent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vertebrata.</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">—Starting again, in the lowest Vertebrates, with organs of an exceedingly simple and primitive kind,&nbsp;we find the series presenting all gradations up to a very&nbsp;high complexity. Thus in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Amphioxus</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> the reproductive&nbsp;glands are little modified patches of the lining epithelium&nbsp;of the coelom, and arise in a paired series,—an arrangement recalling that of the simpler segmented Worms. In&nbsp;other Vertebrates, however, the essential organs are most&nbsp;distinctly localized in origin, never exceeding a single pair,&nbsp;and are also much more evolved in structure. In its&nbsp;earliest recognizable state the generative gland is a slight&nbsp;thickening of the peritoneal epithelium and the subjacent&nbsp;connective tissue on each side of the mesentery, lying near&nbsp;and parallel to the incipient renal apparatus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Leaving the histological details of the process by which this “germinal epithelium,” with the subjacent connective&nbsp;tissue of the “genital ridges,” develops into ovary and&nbsp;testis with their characteristic products to the sections&nbsp;dealing with oogenesis and spermatogenesis respectively,&nbsp;and confining ourselves to the gross anatomy of these&nbsp;essential organs, we may note their very simple character</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Marsipobranchii,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> where in the Lampreys they extend for a great length along the coelom, and exhibit a&nbsp;number of tolerably regular lamellar folds, recalling the&nbsp;segmental arrangement of lower forms. In the remaining Vertebrates these organs are usually less elongated&nbsp;and relatively smaller and more compact, though it is&nbsp;interesting to note that some Amphibians (notably many&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cseciliae)</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> exhibit traces of a more or less discontinuous,&nbsp;perhaps serial, arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">In Plagiostome Fishes the sexual glands arise along only a portion of the genital ridge, the remainder having its&nbsp;stroma mainly enlarged, and forming the so-called epigonal&nbsp;gland. In many of the higher Amphibians accessory organs&nbsp;of unknown function, the so-called fatty bodies or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">corpora&nbsp;adiposa,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> are attached to the ovaries and testes; and in the&nbsp;Toad and other </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Anura</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> another organ in close relation to&nbsp;the testis, and in histological structure resembling a rudimentary ovary, has also been described.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">A considerable tendency towards loss of symmetry appears in the essential organs, particularly the ovaries, of&nbsp;many Vertebrates. Thus in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Myxine</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> neither ovary nor&nbsp;testis is present on the left side, and in many Sharks and&nbsp;Dogfish the left ovary is rudimentary. In Snakes the left&nbsp;ovary is smaller than the right and usually lies behind it,&nbsp;while in Birds the left ovary is alone functional, that of&nbsp;the right side becoming so completely atrophied at an&nbsp;early stage of development that traces of it in the adult&nbsp;are only found surviving in a few forms, especially some&nbsp;of the diurnal birds of prey. Among Mammals symmetrical&nbsp;development is the rule, yet in the curiously Bird-like&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ornithorhynchus</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> the left ovary is much smaller than the&nbsp;right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The relative size of the ovaries varies greatly throughout the Vertebrate series, in relation partly to the relative&nbsp;proportion of stroma to germinal tissue in the histological&nbsp;structure of the organ, to the fecundity of the species, and&nbsp;to the number of ova produced, partly also to the presence&nbsp;or absence of a food yolk, and the consequent size of the&nbsp;ova. In many forms a great increase of size takes place&nbsp;at breeding-time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">In the majority of Vertebrates, as in lower forms, the essential organs remain throughout life in the position in&nbsp;which they develop, or at most depend into the coelom&nbsp;supported by a mesenteric fold. In most Mammals, however, a certain change of position takes place, the ovaries&nbsp;usually shifting more or less backwards towards the pelvis.&nbsp;The testes too in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Monotremata</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> leave their embryonic&nbsp;position at the inner edge of the primitive kidneys and&nbsp;travel backwards. In Edentates, Hyrax, Elephants, and&nbsp;Cetaceans they remain near or a little below the kidneys,&nbsp;but they usually reach the abdominal wall, which they&nbsp;may more or less completely pass through in the inguinal&nbsp;region (as in many of the lower Rodents and Carnivores), or&nbsp;even descend into a more or less distinct diverticulum or&nbsp;hernial protrusion of the integuments of .the abdominal&nbsp;wall, the scrotum. This protrusion arises usually at the&nbsp;posterior margin of the primitive urinogenital opening,&nbsp;but, by exception, in Marsupials in front of it. The cavity&nbsp;of the scrotal pouch may remain throughout life in continuity with that of the abdomen, so enabling the testes&nbsp;to pass backwards and forwards at each breeding season&nbsp;(Marsupials, Rodents, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Insectívora,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> Bats, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">&amp;c.),</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> while in the&nbsp;higher forms, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> Ungulates, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Primates,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> &amp;c., the scrotum&nbsp;retains the testes permanently shut off from the abdominal&nbsp;cavity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The origin and homologies of the genital ducts in i Vertebrates, and the accessory organs in relation to them,&nbsp;may now, after a very great amount of anatomical and&nbsp;embryological inquiry, be considered as tolerably settled,&nbsp;׳ at least in their main outlines.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
