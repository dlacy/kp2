<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">preach lies hidden and lives unspoken in the minds and f hearts of their generation. It is clear then, that on both&nbsp;sides of the line of demarcation between the two categories&nbsp;of religions there are individuals at work, and that on&nbsp;both sides there is growth. The only remaining difference&nbsp;is, that on this side there is consciousness, on that side&nbsp;there is not. But this too cannot serve us. Much in the&nbsp;growth of the so-called race religions was unconscious and&nbsp;therefore anonymous and forgotten; much, however, was&nbsp;not so. We know of many changes for better or worse in&nbsp;national religions, either reforms or reactions, made with&nbsp;full consciousness, because intentionally; and we know the&nbsp;names of the kings or tyrants or other individuals who&nbsp;made them. Who knows if the same Avas not the case&nbsp;when these religions Avere born—if A\<sup>r</sup>hat noAv seems to be&nbsp;the collective product of the wisdom of the community&nbsp;\A־as not simply the product of a tyrant’s, a mighty chieftain’s bon plaisir, or of a renoAvned magician’s influence 1&nbsp;Finally, if by “ founder of a religion ” is meant he Avhom&nbsp;the professors of that religion revere as a heaven-born&nbsp;messenger of the truth or as the greatest of prophets, or&nbsp;adore as the son of God, the incarnation of the highest,&nbsp;—then Avhat Prof. Whitney says they all did, namely, “ give&nbsp;shape and coherence to a body of doctrines of specially&nbsp;moral aspect,” does not apply to the most of them. The&nbsp;neAV body of doctrines in its coherence Avas never shaped&nbsp;by them, but by the leaders of the community to which&nbsp;their preaching gave rise. We call them founders of a&nbsp;neAv religion, not because they ahvays intended to found&nbsp;one, but because, perhaps involuntarily, they laid the&nbsp;foundations of it in the new and pregnant principles they&nbsp;revealed to the world by their Avord and life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Still, Avhatever Ave may have to criticize in Prof. Whitney’s proposition, there is indeed no more marked&nbsp;distinction among religions than the one he makes betAveen&nbsp;AA־hat he calls race religions and religions proceeding from&nbsp;an individual founder, and no other than this should be&nbsp;the basis of a morphological classification. For betAveen&nbsp;those tAvo great categories or orders to one or other of&nbsp;Avhich all known religions belong and eA<sup>r</sup>ery religion must&nbsp;belong there is a difference not only of degree but of an&nbsp;essential kind, a difference of principle, the one great all-important difference. The principle of the one category&nbsp;is nature, that of the other ethics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">In the nature religions the supreme gods are the mighty poAvers of nature, be they demons, spirits, or man-like&nbsp;beings, and ever so highly exalted. There are great mutual :&nbsp;differences betAveen these religions, though they belong to&nbsp;the same order,—e.g., a great difference betAveen the&nbsp;Finnic Ukko and the Norse OcTin, bet\A<sup>T</sup>een the thunder-god of the Brazilian aborigines and the Yedic Indra&nbsp;or the Olympian Zeus, but it is only a difference of&nbsp;degree; fundamentally they are the same. Nobody&nbsp;denies that one nature religion stands on a much higher&nbsp;level than another. Not only are they either unconsciously and by the drift of public opinion or consciously&nbsp;and intentionally altered, enriched, combined Avith foreign&nbsp;modes of AA<sup>r</sup>orship, but in some of them a constant and&nbsp;remarkable progress is also to be noticed. Gods are more&nbsp;and more anthropomorphized, rites humanized. For they&nbsp;are not by any means inaccessible to the influence of moral&nbsp;progress. From an early period moral ideas are combined Avith religious doctrines, and the old mythology is&nbsp;modified by them. Ethical attributes are ascribed to the&nbsp;gods, especially to the highest. Nay, ethical as well as&nbsp;intellectual abstractions are personified and worshipped as&nbsp;divine beings. But as a rule this happens only in the most&nbsp;advanced stages of nature worship; and, moreover, these&nbsp;ethical personifications are simply incorporated in the old&nbsp;system, and not only not distinguished from the nature</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">gods, but even subordinated to them. If some individuals— philosophers, sages, prophets—have risen to the consciousness that the moral ought to have predominance over the&nbsp;natural, yet nature religion, though strongly mixed with&nbsp;ethical elements, does not recognize this, and those who&nbsp;are called to represent and defend it abhor such independent thinkers and persecute them as dangerous enemies&nbsp;to the faith of the fathers. Nature religions cannot do&nbsp;otherAvise, at least if they do not choose to die at once.&nbsp;They can for a long time bear the introduction—let us say,&nbsp;infiltration—of moral, as Avell as msthetic, scientific, and&nbsp;philosophical notions into their mythology; they suffer from&nbsp;it, indeed, and this is instinctively felt by the headstrong&nbsp;defenders of the pure old tradition; but they are unable&nbsp;to shut them out, and if they did so they Avould be left&nbsp;behind and lose their hold on the minds and the hearts of&nbsp;the leading classes among more civilized nations. So they&nbsp;are obliged to let them in, Avere it only for self-preservation.&nbsp;But the reform must not exceed certain limits. If the&nbsp;ethical elements acquire the upper hand, so that they&nbsp;become the predominating principle, then the old forms&nbsp;break in twain by the too heavy burden of neAv ideas, and&nbsp;the old rites become obsolete as being useless. If the&nbsp;majority has at last outgroAvn the traditional worship and&nbsp;mythology—if it comes to the conclusion, Avhich was&nbsp;already the conviction of philosophers, that the old numina&nbsp;are only nomina, Zeus, Hera, Hestia only names for the&nbsp;sky, the aether, the fire,@@<sup>1</sup> to Avhich moral attributes can be&nbsp;ascribed only in a tropical sense—then nature religion&nbsp;inevitably dies of inanition. No political power, no&nbsp;mighty priesthood, no poetry, no mysticism like that of&nbsp;the Neo-Platonists, no romanticism like that of Julian, not&nbsp;even an attempt to imitate the organization and the rites&nbsp;of an ethical religion, can save it any longer from utter&nbsp;decay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">When this culminating point has been reached, the way is prepared for the preaching of an ethical religious&nbsp;doctrine. Ethical religions do not exclude the old&nbsp;naturistic elements altogether, but subordinate them to&nbsp;the ethical principle and lend them something of an ethical&nbsp;tinge, that they may be more in accordance Avith the noAv&nbsp;prevailing system. The old nature-gods, at least the most&nbsp;important among them, survive, and, though first neglected&nbsp;and throAvn into the background by the neAv ideal or&nbsp;abstract divine beings, come again to the front, but only as&nbsp;serving spirits, ministers, angels (ayyeAoi, yazatas, &amp;c), or&nbsp;: even saints, as all nature now stands under the control of&nbsp;| one supernatural ruler in Avhom the supremacy of moral&nbsp;laAv is personified. Noav the prominent characteristics of&nbsp;ethical religions are just the reverse of that which&nbsp;characterizes the naturistic. Nature religions are polydie-monistic or polytheistic; under favourable circumstances&nbsp;they may rise at best to monolatry. Ethical religions, on&nbsp;the other hand, though not all of them strictly monotheistic&nbsp;or pantheistic, all tend to monotheism and are at least&nbsp;monarchic. In nature religions, though they are not&nbsp;exempt from the control of individuals, and even have in&nbsp;part received from them their particular shape or been&nbsp;reformed by them, the ethical or national aspect prevails&nbsp;over the individual, spontaneous groAvth over conscious&nbsp;speculation, imagination over reflexion. Ethical religions&nbsp;on the contrary are communities brought together, not&nbsp;by the common belief in national traditions, but by the&nbsp;common belief in a doctrine of salvation, and organized&nbsp;Avith the aim of maintaining, fostering, propagating, and</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>@@@1</sup> This conclusion as such is utterly false. The gods are no mere </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nomina.</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> They are not the natural phenomena themselves, but&nbsp;spirits, lords, ruling them.
