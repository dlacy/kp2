This book is written in an incorrect but forcible style ; it is full of remarks both new and profound, and is equally useful to the soldier and the general.</p><p>The death of the king of Poland, his father, in 1733, kindled a new war in Europe. His brother, the elector of Saxony, offered him the command of all his forces ; but he preferred the French service, and repaired to Marshal Berwick’s army, which was encamped on the Rhine. “ Count,” said that general, who was preparing to attack the enemy’s intrenchments at Etlinghen, “ I was going to send for three thousand men, but your arrival is of more value than theirs.” When the attack began, the count, at the head of a regiment of grenadiers, forced the enemy’s lines, and by his bravery decided the victory. He behaved with no less intrepidity at the siege of Philipsburg. For these services he was, in 1734, rewarded with the rank of lieutenant- general. Peace was concluded in 1736 ; but the death of Charles VL, the emperor of Germany, almost immediately kindled a new war.</p><p>Prague was besieged by the Count of Saxe in 1741, near the end of November, and was taken the same month by assault. The conquest of Egra followed that of Prague. It was taken a few days after the trenches were opened. This success gave so much joy to the Emperor Charles VIL, that he wrote with his own hands a congratulatory letter to the conqueror.</p><p>In 1744 he was made marshal of France, and commanded a part of the French army in Flanders. During that campaign he displayed the greatest military conduct. Though the enemy was superior in number, he observed their motions so skilfully that they could do nothing. In January 1745, an alliance was concluded at Warsaw, between the queen of Hungary, the king of England, and the states of Holland. The ambassador of the states-gcneral, meeting Marshal Saxe one day at Versailles, asked his opinion of that treaty. “ I think,” said he, “ that if the king my master would give me an unlimitcd commission, I would read the original at the Hague before the end of the year.” This answer was not a bravado ; the marshal was capable of performing it.</p><p>He went soon afterwards, though exceedingly ill, to take the command of the French army in the Low Countries. A gentleman seeing the feeble condition in which he left Paris, asked him how he could in that situation undertake so great an enterprise. “ The question,” replied he, “ is not about living, but setting out.” Soon after the opening of the campaign, the battle of Fontenoy was fought. Marshal Saxe was at the point of death, yet he caused himself to be put into a litter, and carried round all the posts. During the action he mounted on horseback, though he was so very weak that his attendants dreaded every moment to see him expire. The victory of Fontenoy, which was owing entirely to his vigilance and capacity, was followed by the reduction of Tournay, Bruges, Ghent, Oudenard, Ostend, Ath, and Brussels. This last city was taken on the 28th of February 1746 ; and very soon afterwards the king sent to the marshal a letter of naturalization, conceived in the most flattering terms. The succeeding campaigns gained him additional honours. After the victory of Raucoux, which he gained on the 11th of October 1746, the king of France made him a present of six pieces of cannon. He was, on the 12th of January of the following year, created marshal of all the French armies, and, in 1748, commander- general of all those parts of the Netherlands which were lately conquered.</p><p>Holland now began to tremble for her safety. Maestricht and Bergen-op-Zoom had already fallen, and nothing but misfortunes seemed to attend the further prosecution of the war. The states-general, therefore, offered terms of</p><p>peace, which were accepted, and a treaty concluded on the 18th of October 1748.</p><p>Marshal Saxe retired to Chambord, a country-seat which the king of France had given him. Some time afterwards he went to Berlin, where the king of Prussia received him as Alexander would have received Cæsar. On his return to France, he spent his time among men of learning, artists, and philosophers. He died of a fever, on the 30th of November 1750, at the age of fifty-four.</p><p>The best edition of his Reveries was printed at Paris, 1757, in two volumes 4to. It was compared with the greatest attention with the original manuscript in the king’s library. It is accompanied with many designs exactly engraved, and a life of the author written in the panegyrical style.</p><p>SAXE-ALTENBURG, a duchy in Germany, recently become an independent though a small sovereignty. It was united with Saxe-Gotha till the decease without issue of the Grand Duke of Saxe-Gotha Altenburg, when a dispute arose between the several branches of the family, which was terminated by a treaty in 1826, Gotha being transferred to the Duke of Saxe-Coburg, and Altenburg being created a sovereign state. It is 502 square miles in extent, but is not compact, and some parts are surrounded by the territories of other states. It contains ten cities and towns, and 458 villages, with (in 1836) 120,690 inhabitants, who, with the exception of 3900 Catholics, adhere to the Lutheran religion. The revenues of the state amount to L.68,250, consisting nearly one half of the rent of the domains, and the other half of direct taxes on consumption. The annual expenditure is somewhat less, and the surplus is applied to the discharge of the debt, which, in 1832, amounted to L.183,900. The force to form the contingent to the German confederation is fixed at 982 men. By a constitution fixed in April 1831, the assembly of the states is appointed to consist of nobles, burghers, and peasants, and, with the duke, to make or alter the laws. The district is hilly and woody, but more so on the western than on the eastern side. In the latter division the soil is generally fertile, producing abundant crops of corn, and containing much rich meadow-land, adapted to the fattening of cattle. The river Saale rises in this duchy, and receives many of the smaller streams which run to the Elbe. The chief manufacturing industry is spinning the flax of their own growth ; but a few woollen goods are made, and some iron ware. The capital is the city of Altenburg, containing 13,800 inhabitants. Two other places contain more than 4000, viz. Ronnenburg 4640, and Eisenburg 4605.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Saxe-Coburg-Gotha,</hi> a sovereign duchy in Germany. The Duke of Coburg, by a family arrangement, attained in 1826 the duchy of Gotha, and added it to his former dominions. The whole is a compact territory, except that a part of Saxe-Weimar projects itself into the south-eastern portion of it, and it extends over 1049 square miles. It comprehends twenty-one towns and cities, and 525 villages, with 156,639 inhabitants, of whom 127,000 are Lutherans, 11,500 are Catholics, 2900 Calvinists, and 1200 Jews, the remainder not being ascertained. The revenue amounts to L. 120,000, and the expenditure to about one tenth less, the residue being applied to diminish the state debts, amounting to L.300,000. The military force to be furnished to the German Confederation is 136G men. The northern part, or the duchy of Gotha, is on the Thuringian Mountains, some of whose elevations are near 3000 feet above the level of the sea, but decline towards the cast into an undulating district, which is drained by streams running into the Elbe or the Weser. The climate, though cold, is healthy. The soil is of moderate fertility, and being well cultivated, produces good crops of corn, and a great abundance of fruits and culinary vegetables, as well as large quantities of flax. The duchy of Coburg, or southern part, is an extensive plain, except in the province of Lichtenburg, where there are some ranges</p></body></text></TEI>
