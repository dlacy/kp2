The son was educated&nbsp;for the Congregational ministry, but the development of his&nbsp;views prevented his taking up that career, and he became a clerk&nbsp;in the admiralty. He had already served an apprenticeship&nbsp;to journalism before he made his name as a novelist by th£&nbsp;three books “ edited by Reuben Shapcott/’ </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Autobiography&nbsp;of Mark Rutherford</span><span class="font0"> (1881), </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Mark Rutherford’s Deliverance</span><span class="font0"> (1885),&nbsp;and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Revolution in Tanner’s Lane</span><span class="font0"> (1887).

<p><span class="font0">RUTHERFORD, WILLIAM GUNION (1853-1907), English scholar, was born in Peeblesshire on the 17th of July 1853. He&nbsp;was educated at St Andrews and Oxford, where he graduated&nbsp;in natural science, with a view to following the medical profession, which he abandoned in favour of a scholastic career.&nbsp;From 1883 to 1901 he was headmaster of Westminster school;&nbsp;and his death, on the 19th of July 1907, deprived classical&nbsp;scholarship in England of one of its most brilliant modern&nbsp;representatives. Rutherford devoted special attention to&nbsp;Attic idioms and the language of Aristophanes. His most&nbsp;important work, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">New Phrynichus</span><span class="font0"> (1882), dealing with the&nbsp;Atticisms of the grammarian, was supplemented by his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Babrius&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(1883), a specimen of the later Greek, which was the chief subject&nbsp;of C. A. Lobeck’s earlier commentary (1820) on Phrynichus.&nbsp;His edition (1896-1905) of the Aristophanic scholia from the&nbsp;Ravenna MS. was less successful. Mention may also be made&nbsp;of his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Elementary Greek Accidence</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lex Rex,</span><span class="font0"> a list of cognate&nbsp;words in Greek, Latin and English.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RUTHERFURD (or Rutherpord), SAMUEL (c. 1600-1661), Scottish divine, was born about 1600 at the village of Nisbet,&nbsp;Roxburghshire. He went to college at Edinburgh in 1617,&nbsp;graduating M.A. in 1621, and two years afterwards was elected&nbsp;professor of humanity. On account of an alleged indiscretion&nbsp;before his marriage in 1626 he was dismissed his professorship&nbsp;in that year, but, after studying theology, he was in 1627&nbsp;appointed minister of Anwoth, Kirkcudbrightshire, and soon&nbsp;took a leading place among the clergy of Galloway. In 1636&nbsp;his first book, entitled </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Exercitationes Apologeticae pro Divina&nbsp;Gratia</span><span class="font0">—an elaborate treatise against Arminianism—appeared&nbsp;at Amsterdam. Its severe Calvinism led to a prosecution by&nbsp;the bishop, Thomas Sydserf, in the High Commission Court,&nbsp;first at Wigtown and afterwards at Edinburgh, with the result&nbsp;that Rutherfurd was deposed from his pastoral office, and&nbsp;sentenced to confinement in Aberdeen during the king’s pleasure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">His banishment lasted from September 1636 to February 1638, and the greater number of his published </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Letters</span><span class="font0"> belong to this&nbsp;period of his life. He was present at the signing of the Covenant&nbsp;in Edinburgh in 1638, and at the Glasgow Assembly of the same&nbsp;year he was restored to his parish. In 1639 he was appointed&nbsp;professor of divinity in St Mary’s College, St Andrews. He&nbsp;only accepted the position on the condition that he should&nbsp;be allowed to act as colleague to Robert Blair in the church&nbsp;of St Andrews. He was sent up to London in 1643 as one of&nbsp;the eight commissioners from Scotland to the Westminster&nbsp;Assembly. Remaining at his post over three years, he did great&nbsp;service to the cause of his party. In 1642 he had published his&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Peaceable and Temperate Plea for Paul’s Presbyterie in Scotland,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and the sequel to it in 1644 on </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Due Right of Presbyteries&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">provoked Milton’s contemptuous reference to “mere A. S.&nbsp;and Rutherfurd ” in his sonnet </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">On the New Forcers of Conscience&nbsp;under the Long Parliament.</span><span class="font0"> In 1644 also appeared Rutherfurd’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lex Rex, a Dispute for the Just Prerogative of King and People,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">which gives him a recognized place among the early writers on&nbsp;constitutional law; it was followed by </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Divine Right of&nbsp;Church Government and Excommunication</span><span class="font0"> (1646), and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Free&nbsp;Disputation against Pretended Liberty of Conscience</span><span class="font0"> (1648),&nbsp;characterized by Bishop Heber as “ perhaps the most elaborate&nbsp;defence of persecution which has ever appeared in a Christian&nbsp;country.” Among his other works are the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Tryal and Triumph&nbsp;of Faith</span><span class="font0"> (1645), </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Christ Dying and Drawing Sinners to Himself&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(1647), and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Survey of the Spiritual Antichrist</span><span class="font0"> (1648). In 1647&nbsp;he returned to St Andrews to become principal of the New&nbsp;College there, and in 1648 and 1651 he declined successive&nbsp;invitations to theological chairs at Harderwijk and Utrecht.&nbsp;After the Restoration in 1660, his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lex Rex</span><span class="font0"> was ordered to be&nbsp;burned. He was deprived of all his offices, and on a charge of&nbsp;high treason was cited to appear before the ensuing parliament.&nbsp;His health utterly broke down, and he drew up, on the 26th of&nbsp;February 1661, a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Testimony,</span><span class="font0"> which was posthumously published.&nbsp;He died on the 23rd of the following March.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The fame of Rutherfurd now rests principally upon his remarkable </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Letters,</span><span class="font0"> which, to the number of 215, were first published anonymously by M'Ward, an amanuensis, as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Joshua Redivivus,&nbsp;or Mr Rutkerfoord's Letters,</span><span class="font0"> in 1664. They have been frequently&nbsp;reprinted, the best edition (365 letters) being that by Rev. A. A.&nbsp;Bonar (1848), with a sketch of his life. In addition to the other&nbsp;works already mentioned, Rutherfurd published in 1651 a treatise,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">De Divina Providentia,</span><span class="font0"> against Molimsm, Socinianism and Arminianism, of which Richard Baxter, not without justice, remarked&nbsp;that “as the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Letters</span><span class="font0"> were the best piece so this was the worst he&nbsp;had ever read.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RUTHERGLEN (locally pronounced </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rugleri),</span><span class="font0"> a royal municipal and police burgh of Lanarkshire, Scotland. Pop. of royal&nbsp;burgh (1901) 18,279. It is situated on the left bank of the Clyde,&nbsp;2| m. by the Caledonian railway S.E. of Glasgow, with the&nbsp;E. of which it is connected by a bridge. The parish church&nbsp;stands near the spire of the ancient church where, according&nbsp;to tradition, the treaty was made in 1297 with Edward I.,&nbsp;by which Sir John Menteith undertook to betray Wallace to the&nbsp;English. The principal public building is the town hall, dating&nbsp;from 1861. The industries include collieries, chemical works,&nbsp;dye-works, cotton- and paper-mills, chair-making, tube-making,&nbsp;pottery, rope- and twine-works and some shipbuilding. It&nbsp;forms one of the Kilmarnock group of parliamentary burghs,&nbsp;with Dumbarton,&quot;Port-Glasgow, Renfrew and Kilmarnock.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rutherglen was erected into a royal burgh by David I. in 1126. It then included a portion of Glasgow, but in 1226 the&nbsp;boundaries were rectified so as to exclude the whole of the city.&nbsp;In early times it had a castle, which was taken by Robert Bruce&nbsp;from the English in 1313. It was kept in good repair till after&nbsp;the battle of Langside (1568), when it was burnt by order of&nbsp;the regent Moray. In 1679 the Covenanters published their&nbsp;“ Declaration and Testimony ” at Rutherglen prior to the&nbsp;battles of Drumclog and Bothwell Brig (1679).</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
