He began his military career under Frederick Henry, prince of Orange, and after his death in 1659 entered the service of France, acquiring ultimately a reputation as a general second only to that of Turenne and the prince of Condé. In Paris he made the acquaintance of Charles II., who according to his own account “admitted him to great familiarities with him.” In 1660 he was sent to Portugal, and on his way thither passed through England to concert with Charles measures for supporting that country in the contest with Spain. For his services to Portugal he was in 1668 made a grandee, and received a pension of £5000 a year. In 1673 he was invited by Charles to England, with the view of taking command of the army, but so strong was the general sentiment against the appointment as savouring of French influence that it was not carried into effect. He therefore again entered the service of France, and after his capture of Bellegarde, 29th July 1675, received the rank of marshal. In subsequent campaigns he continued to add to his reputation until the revocation of the edict of Nantes (22d October 1685) compelled him as a Protestant to quit his adopted country. Ultimately he was chosen commander-in-chief of the forces of the elector of Brandenburg, and with the elector’s consent he joined the prince of Orange on his expedition to England in 1688, as second in command to the prince. The following year he was made a knight of the Garter, created successively baron, marquis, and duke, and received from the House of Commons a vote of £100,000. In August he was appointed commander-in-chief of the expedition to Ireland against James IL After capturing Carrickfergus he marched unopposed through a country desolated before him to Dundalk, but, as the bulk of his forces were raw and undisciplined as well as inferior in numbers to the enemy, he deemed it imprudent to risk a battle, and entrenching himself at Dundalk declined to be drawn beyond the circle of his defences. Shortly afterwards pestilence broke out, and when he retired to winter quarters in Ulster his forces were in a more shattered condition than if they had sustained a severe defeat. At the same time competent authorities were agreed that the policy of masterly inactivity which he pursued was the only one open to him. In the spring he began the campaign with the capture of Charlemont, but no advance southward was made until the arrival of William. At the Boyne (July 1, 1690) Schömberg gave his opinion against the determination of William to cross the river in face of the opposing army. In the battle he held command of the centre, and, while riding through the river without his cuirass to rally his men, was surrounded by a band of Irish horsemen and met instantaneous death. He was buried in St Patrick’s cathedral, Dublin, where there is a monument to him, with a Latin inscription by Dean Swift. Schömberg was generally regarded in Eng-</p><pb xml:id="eb09-21-s02-0432" facs="encyclopediabrit21newyrich_raw_0454.jp2"/><p>land with great respect, and his manners and bearing rendered him universally popular.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
