<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">what this means. It is, in plain English, humour. The definition of humour is a generally acknowledged </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">crux,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> and till it is defined&nbsp;the definition of Pantagruelism will be in the same position. But&nbsp;that it consists in the extension of a wide sympathy to all human&nbsp;affairs together with a comprehension of their vanity may be said&nbsp;as safely as anything else. Moroseness and dogmatism are as far&nbsp;from the Pantagruelism of Rabelais as maudlin sentimentality or&nbsp;dilettantism. Perhaps the chief things lacking in his attitude are,&nbsp;in the first place, reverence, of which, however, from a few passages,&nbsp;it is clear he was by no means totally devoid, and an appreciation&nbsp;of passion and poetry. Here and there there are touches of the<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>latter, as in the portrait of Quintessence, but passion is everywhere&nbsp;absent—an absence for which the comic structure and plan of the&nbsp;book does not by any means supply a complete explanation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">For a general estimate of Rabelais’s literary character and influence the reader may be referred to the article </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">France </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(vol. ix. p. 652). But some detailed remarks must be given here. The life&nbsp;and works of Rabelais, despite the considerable number of publications of which they have been the subject, have hitherto been less&nbsp;fully and satisfactorily treated than the life and works of any author&nbsp;who occupies an equally important place. As will have been seen&nbsp;from the foregoing attempt to give the actual facts, a whole legend&nbsp;has grown up round the scanty details recorded of him, and many,&nbsp;if not all, of the particulars of that legend can be shown to be&nbsp;false. But no one hitherto has undertaken in a satisfactory fashion&nbsp;the construction of a rigorously critical life. In the same way&nbsp;there are many questions in reference to his main work which have&nbsp;never been thoroughly and finally sifted by a critical intelligence&nbsp;equal to the task. Limits of space, to say no more, prevent any&nbsp;such attempt being made here ; but there are three questions without the discussion of which this notice of one of the foremost writers&nbsp;of the world would not be worthy of its present place. These are&nbsp;—What is the general drift and purpose of </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Gargantua</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Panta-gruel,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> supposing there to be any ? What defence can be oifered, if&nbsp;any defence is needed, for the extraordinary licence of language&nbsp;and imagery which the author has permitted himself? What was&nbsp;his attitude towards the great questions of religion, philosophy, and&nbsp;politics ? These questions succeed each other in the order of reason,&nbsp;and the answer to each assists the resolution of the next.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">There have been few more remarkable instances of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">lues com-mentatoria</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> than the work of the editors of Rabelais. Almost every one appears to have started with a Rabelais ready made in his head,&nbsp;and to have, so to speak, read that Rabelais into the book. Those&nbsp;who have not done this, like Le Duchat, Motteux, and Esmangart,&nbsp;have generally committed the error of tormenting themselves and&nbsp;their author to find individual explanations of personages and&nbsp;events. The extravagance of the last-named commentator takes&nbsp;the form of seeing elaborate allegories ; that of some others devotes&nbsp;itself chiefly to identifying the characters of the romance with more&nbsp;or less famous historical persons. But the first blunder, that of&nbsp;forming a general hypothetical conception of Rabelais and then&nbsp;adjusting interpretation of the work to it, is the commoner. This&nbsp;conception, however, has singularly varied. According to some&nbsp;expositors, among whom the latest and not the least respectable is&nbsp;M. Fleury, Rabelais is a sober reformer, an apostle of earnest work,&nbsp;of sound education, of rational if not dogmatic religion, who wraps&nbsp;up his morals in a farcical envelope partly to make them go down&nbsp;with the vulgar and partly to shield himself from the consequences&nbsp;of his reforming zeal. According to others, of whom we have had&nbsp;in England a distinguished example in Mr Besant, Rabelais is all&nbsp;this but with a difference. He is not religious at all; he is more&nbsp;or less anti-religious ; and his book is more or less of a general protest against any attempt to explain supematurally the riddle of&nbsp;the earth. According to a third class, the most distinguished recent representative of which was M. Paul Lacroix, the Rabelaisian&nbsp;legend does not so much err in principle as it invents in fact.&nbsp;Rabelais is the incarnation of the “ esprit Gaulois,” a jovial careless&nbsp;soul, not destitute of common sense or even acute intellectual&nbsp;power, but first of all a good fellow, rather preferring a broad jest&nbsp;to a fine-pointed one, and rollicking through life like a good-natured&nbsp;undergraduate. Of all these views it may be said that those who&nbsp;hold them are obliged to shut their eyes to many things in the&nbsp;book and to see in it many which are not there. The religious&nbsp;part of the matter will be dealt with presently ; but it is impossible&nbsp;to think that any unbiassed judge reading Rabelais can hold the&nbsp;grave philosopher view or the reckless good fellow view without&nbsp;modifications and allowances which practically deprive either of&nbsp;any value as a sufficient explanation of the book and its writer.&nbsp;Those who, as it has been happily put, identify Rabelais with&nbsp;Pantagruel, strive in vain on any view intellectually consistent or&nbsp;morally respectable to account for the vast ocean of pure or impure&nbsp;laughter and foolery which surrounds the few solid islets of sense&nbsp;and reason and devotion. Those w<sup>r</sup>ho in the same way identify&nbsp;Rabelais with Panurge can never explain the education scheme, the&nbsp;solemn apparition of Gargantua among the farcical and fantastic&nbsp;variations on Panurge’s wedding, and many other passages ; while,&nbsp;on the other hand, those who insist on a definite propaganda of&nbsp;any kind must justify themselves by their own power of seeing&nbsp;things invisible to plain men. But these vagaries are not only unjustifiable ; they are entirely unnecessary. No one reading Rabelais&nbsp;without </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">parti pris,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> but with a good knowledge of the history and&nbsp;literature of his own times and the times which preceded him, can&nbsp;have much difficulty in appreciating his book. He had evidently&nbsp;during his long and studious sojourn in the cloister (a sojourn&nbsp;which was certainly not less than five-and-twenty years, while it&nbsp;may have been five-and-thirty, and of which the studiousness rests&nbsp;not on legend but on documentary evidence) acquired a vast stock&nbsp;of learning. He was, it is clear, thoroughly penetrated with the&nbsp;instincts, the hopes, and the ideas of the Renaissance in the form&nbsp;which it took in France, in England, and in Germany,—a form,&nbsp;that is to say, not merely humanist but full of aspirations for social&nbsp;and political improvement, and above all for a joyous, varied, and&nbsp;non-ascetic life. He had thoroughly convinced himself of the abuses&nbsp;to which monachism lent itself. Lastly, he had the spirit of lively&nbsp;satire and of willingness </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">desipere in loco</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> which frequently goes with&nbsp;the love of books. It is in the highest degree improbable that in&nbsp;beginning his great work he had any definite purpose or intention.&nbsp;The habit of burlesquing the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">romans d'aventures</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> was no new one,&nbsp;and the form lent itself easily to the two literary exercises to which&nbsp;he was most disposed,—apt and quaint citation from and variation&nbsp;on the classics and satirical criticism of the life he saw around him.&nbsp;The immense popularity of the first two parts induced him to continue them, and by degrees (the genuineness of the fifth book at&nbsp;any rate in substance is here assumed) the possibility of giving the&nbsp;whole something like a consistent form and a regular conclusion&nbsp;presented itself to him. The voyage in particular allowed the&nbsp;widest licence of satirical allusion, and he availed himself of that&nbsp;licence in the widest sense. Here and there persons are glanced&nbsp;at, while the whole scenery of his birthplace and its neighbourhood&nbsp;is curiously worked in ; but for the most part the satire is typical&nbsp;rather than individual, and it is on the whole a rather negative&nbsp;satire. In only two points can Rabelais be said to be definitely&nbsp;polemic. He certainly hated the monkish system in the debased&nbsp;form in which it existed in his time ; he as certainly hated the&nbsp;brutish ignorance into which the earlier systems of education had&nbsp;suffered too many of their teachers and scholars to drop. At these&nbsp;two things he was never tired of striking, but elsewhere, even in&nbsp;the grim satire of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Chats fourres,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> he is the satirist proper rather&nbsp;than the reformer. It is in the very absence of any cramping or&nbsp;limiting purpose that the great merit and value of the book consist.&nbsp;It holds up an almost perfectly level and spotless mirror to the&nbsp;temper of the earlier Renaissance. The author has no universal&nbsp;medicine of his own (except Pantagruelism) to offer, nor has he&nbsp;anybody else’s universal medicine to attack. He ranges freely&nbsp;about the world, touching the laughable sides of things with kindly&nbsp;laughter, and every now and then dropping the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">risibile</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> and taking&nbsp;to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">rationale.</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> It is not indeed possible to deny that in the&nbsp;Oracle of the Bottle, besides its merely jocular and fantastic sense,&nbsp;there is a certain “echo,” as it has been called, “of the conclusion&nbsp;of the preacher,” a certain acknowledgment of the vanity of things.&nbsp;But in such a book such a note could hardly be wanting unless the&nbsp;writer had been a fanatic, which he was not, or a mere voluptuary,&nbsp;which he was not, or a dullard, which he was least of all. It&nbsp;is, after all, little more than a suggestion, and is certainly not&nbsp;strengthened by anything in the body of the work. Rabelais is,&nbsp;in short, if he be read without prejudice, a humourist pure and&nbsp;simple, feeling often in earnest, thinking almost always in jest.&nbsp;He is distinguished from the two men who alone can be compared&nbsp;to him in character of work and force of genius combined—Lucian&nbsp;and Swift—by very marked characteristics. He is much less of a&nbsp;mere mocker than Lucian, and he is entirely destitute, even when&nbsp;he deals with monks or pedants, of the ferocity of Swift. He&nbsp;neither sneers nor rages; the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">rire immense</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> which distinguishes&nbsp;him is altogether good-natured ; but he is nearer to Lucian than&nbsp;to Swift, and Lucian is perhaps the author whom it is most necessary to know in order to understand him rightly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">If this general view is correct (and it may at least claim to be founded on nothing but the reading of Rabelais himself without&nbsp;prejudice and with a tolerable apparatus) it will probably condition&nbsp;to some extent the answer to be given to the two minor questions&nbsp;stated above. The first is connected with the great blemish of&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Gargantua</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Pantagruel</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">,—their extreme coarseness of language&nbsp;and imagery. It is somewhat curious that some of those who claim&nbsp;Rabelais as an enemy of the supernatural in general have been the&nbsp;loudest to condemn this blemish, and that some of them have&nbsp;made the exceedingly lame excuse for him that it was a means of&nbsp;wrapping up his propaganda and keeping it and himself safe from&nbsp;the notice of the powers that were. This is not complimentary to&nbsp;Rabelais, and, except in some very small degree, it is not likely to&nbsp;be true. For as a matter of fact obscenity no less than impiety&nbsp;was charged against him by his ultra-orthodox enemies, and the&nbsp;obscenity no less than the supposed impiety gave them a handle&nbsp;against him before such bodies as the Sorbonne and the parliaments.&nbsp;As for the extreme theory of the anti-Rabelaisians, that Rabelais</span></p>
