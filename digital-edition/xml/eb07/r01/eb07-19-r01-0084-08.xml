Composition. Their nature will be best understood by a few examples, and an account of the number of tones, semitones, or lesser intervals, contained in each.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">second redundant</hi> is composed of a major tone and a minor semitone, as from <hi rend="italic">fa</hi> to <hi rend="italic">sol</hi> sharp. Its proportion is as 64 to 75. The <hi rend="italic">third redundant</hi> consists of two tones and a semitone, as <hi rend="italic">fa Ut</hi> sharp. Its proportion is as 96 to 125. The <hi rend="italic">fourth redundant</hi> is the same with the tritone.</p><p>From these examples compared with the same intervals in their natural state, the reader may form a general idea of what is meant by <hi rend="italic">redundant.</hi></p>
