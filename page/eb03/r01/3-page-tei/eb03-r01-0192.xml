Rumours of plots were ſpread through the country, and a new ſtorm was obviouſly gathering, when the queſtion was thus got quit of. M. Mounier remarked, that the executive power could poffeſs no negativc againſt the decrees of the preſent aſſembly, which had been nominated by the nation with ſuprem£ powers for the expreſs purpoſe of framing a conſtitu-tion, which was to remain binding over all orders of men. in the ſtate ; and with regard to future legiſlatures, the king declared by a meſſage, that he wiſhed to poſſefe no more than a <hi rend="italic">ſuſpenfive veto.</hi>  It is remarkable that the popular Mirabeau concluded a fpeech in favour of the abſolute <hi rend="italic">veto</hi>  of the crown with thefe words, " Tlιat it would be better to live in Conſtantinople than in France, if laws could be made without the royal function.” This political adventurer is, however, accufed of having taken care to circulate in Paris a report that he had oppoſed the <hi rend="italic">veto</hi>  with all his influence ; and to give credit to the ſtory, he is ſaid to have quitted the aſſembly juſt before the diviſion, that his vote might not appear on record againſt it.</p><p>In the debates about the <hi rend="italic">veto</hi>  the month of Auguſt was ſpent ; and in the beginning of September a new conſtitutional queſtion was prefented to the aſſembly by one of its numerous committees. This was, whether the legiſlative body ought to conſiſt of one or of two chambers ? Mounier, Lally, Tollendal, Clermont Tonnerre, and others, who were zealous lovers of freedom upon what were then accounted moderate principles, ſupported eagerly the idea of eſtabliſhing two independent chambers in imitation of the Brſtiſh conſtitution ; but they were deſerted both by the democratic and ariſtocratic parties. The firſt of theſe re-garded an upper houſe or ſenate as a refuge for the o!d ariſtocracy, or as the cradle of a new one ; while the higher nobles and clergy feared leſt ſuch an arrange-ιnent might prevent the future re-eſtabliſhment of the ancient diviſion into three orders. Οί ιοοο members who voted, only 89 fupported the propofal for dividing the legiſlature into two chambers.</p><p>Soon after this, the king gave his fonction to the important decrees of the 4tl1 of Auguſt, but not with-. out ſome heſitation, and expreffing doubts of the wiſdom of ſome of them in a letter to the aſſembly. At the fame time the <hi rend="italic">inviolability</hi>  of the perſon of the monarch was decreed, the indiviſibility of the throne, and its hereditary deſcent from male to male in the reigning family.—But we ſhall not here attempt to enter into a detail of the various articles of the new conſti-tution as connected with the circumſtances under which they became the ſubject of debate, we ſhall only ſtate thoſe more remarkable circumſtances which tend to aſ-certain the peculiar changes which the ſentiments of the nation underwent in the progreſs of a revolution the moſt remarkable that occurs in human hiſtory.</p><p>In confequence oſ the debates upon the queſtions of the <hi rend="italic">veto</hi>  and the two chambers, the minds of parties had become much irritated. Paris wore the fome threatening afpect that it had done in the months of June and of July preceding ; and every thing feemed tending towards an important criſis. The ariſtocratiq party accuſed their antagoniſts of a deſign to excite ¢ew inſurrections j and the charge was retorted, by cir</p><lb/><p>culating a report that a plot for conveying the king to</p><p>Metz was already ripe for execution.</p><p>From the period 0f the defection of the French, guards, who were now in the pay of the capital, the protection of the royal family had been entruſted to thes militia or national guard of Verfailles, together with the regiment of the <hi rend="italic">gardes du corps,</hi>  which was compoſed entirely of gentlemen. Upon the circulation of the report of the intended flight of the king, the French guards, began to wi∏ι to be reſtored to their ancient employment of attending his perſon, for the purpoſe of preventing any attempt of this nature. This idea was eagerly cheriihed by the capital ; and, in ſpite of every effort uſed by M. de la Fayette, the obvious appearance of approaching diſturbances could not be prevented. The popular party fow the advan-tages which they would derive from placing the aſſem* bly and the king in thc midſt of that turbulent metro-polis which had given birth to -the revolution, an&lt;L upon the attachment of which they could moſt ſecurely depend. Every encouragement was therefore given-by the moſt active leaders of what was now called the. <hi rend="italic">Democratic</hi>  party to the project of eſtabliihing the court at Paris. The miniſtry were under no finall degree of alarm ; and the count d’ Eſtaing, who commanded the national guard of Verfailles, requeſted the aid of an. additional regiment. The regiment of Flanders was. accordingly lent for : its arrival caufed no ſmall degree of anxiety and every effort was inſtantly made, to gain over both officers and ſoldiers to the popular cauſe.</p><p>Οη the ſirſt of october the garde du corps, probably for the purpoſe of ingratiating tb.emſelves with thc newly arrived regiment, and perhaps to attach them more· ſteadily to the royal cauſe, invited the officers of the regiment of Flanders to a public entertainment. Several officers of the national guard, and others of the military, were invited. Tlie entertainment was given in the opera houſe adjoining to the palace ; ſeveral loyal toaſts were drank; but it is aſſerted, that when the fa-vυurite popular toεit <hi rend="italic">The Nation</hi>  was given, it was-rejected by the gardes du corps. In ordinary cafes,, ſuch a trifling circumſtance as this, or even any other of the tranſactions of a night of feſtivity,. would' juſtly be regarded as unworthy of notice in recording thç more remarkable events in the hiſtory of a great nation ; but ſuch was now the ſingular ſtate of affairs», that the moſt trivial occurrences were inſtruroental, by their combination, in the production of important con-ſequences. The queen, having ieen from a window of the palace the gaiety which prevailed among the military, prevailed- with the king,, who-was juif returned, from huntings to viſit tÉem along with herfelf and the dauphin. Their ſudden appearance in. thc foloon kin-dled in an inſtant the ancient euthuſiaſra of French..-loyalty. The grenadiers of the regiment of Flanders, along with the Swifs chaſſeurs, had been admitted to» the defert ; and they, as well as their officers, drank, the health of the King, Queen, and Dauphin, with their ſwords drawn. The royal family having bowed, with po∙ liteneſs to the company, retired.—Οί all nations, the French are moſt liable to the influence of ſudden im-∙ preflions: the muſic played the favourite air, <hi rend="italic">0 Ricard </hi><hi rend="italic">L </hi><hi rend="italic">0 mon Roi !
