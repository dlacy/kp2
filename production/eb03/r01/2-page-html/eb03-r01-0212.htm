<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Prof.</span><span class="font1"> &quot; Aries had hoiſted the ſtandard oſ rebellion ; 'you favoured it by ſending three civil commiſſaries,&nbsp;who made it their buſmefs not to repreſs the counter«&nbsp;revolutioniſts, but to juſtify their proceedings.—what&nbsp;have you to anſwer ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lows.</span><span class="font1"> &quot; The inftructions which were given to the commiffaries muſt prove what was their miffion ; and I&nbsp;knew none oſ them when the miniſters propoſed them&nbsp;to me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Prof</span><span class="font1"> &quot; Avignon, and the county of Venaiffin, had been united with France ; you cauſed the decree to be&nbsp;executed ; but a month aſter that time civil war defo-lated that country. The commiffaries you ſent thither&nbsp;helped to ravage it.—what have you to anſwer?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Louis.</span><span class="font1"> “ I do not remember what delay has been -cauſed in the execution oſ the decree ; beſides, this occurrence has no perſonal reference to me ; -it only con-cerns thoſe that haye been ſent, not thoſe who ſent&nbsp;them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">• Preſ.</span><span class="font1"> &quot; Nîmes, Montauban, Mende, Jales, felt great ſhocks dm ing the ſirſt days oſ freedom. You did no-thing to ſtiſſe thoſe germens oſ counter-revolution till&nbsp;the moment when Saillant’s conſpiracy became mani-feſtly notorious.—what have you to anſwer ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Louis.</span><span class="font1"> &quot; I gave, in this reſpect, ali tlie orders which were propoſed to me by the miniſters.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Prof</span><span class="font1"> “ You ſent 22 battalions againſt the Marſeil-lois, who marched to reduce the counter-revolutioniſts oſ Arles. - what have you to anſwer ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Louis.</span><span class="font1"> “ I ought to have the pieces referring to this matter, to give a juſt anſwer.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Prof</span><span class="font1"> “ You gave the ſouthern command to wit-genſtein, who wrote to you on the 2iſt oſ April 1792, after he had been recalled : ‘ A ſew inſtants more, and&nbsp;I ſhall call around the throne oſ your Majeſty thouſands&nbsp;oſ French, who are again become worthy of the wiſhes&nbsp;you form ſor their happineſs.’—what have you to an-ſwei ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Louis.</span><span class="font1"> &quot; This letter is dated ſince his recall ; he has not been employed ſince. I do not recollect this&nbsp;letter.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Prof.</span><span class="font1"> &quot; You paid your late life-guards at Coblentz ; the regiſters oſ Septeuil atteſt this ; and general orders&nbsp;ſigned by you prove that you ſent conſiderable remit-tances to Bouille, Rochefort, Vauguyon, Choiſeul,&nbsp;Beaupre, Hamilton, and the wife oſ Polignac.—what&nbsp;have you to anſwer ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Louis.</span><span class="font1"> &quot; when I ſirſt learned that my life-guards affembled beyond the Rhine, I ſtopped their pay : as&nbsp;to the reft, ί do not remember ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Prof</span><span class="font1"> “ Your brothers, enemies to the ſtate, cauſed the emigrants to rally under their banners : they raiſed&nbsp;regiments, took up loans, and concluded alliances in&nbsp;your name : you did not diſelaim them 5 but at the moment when you were fully certain that you could no&nbsp;longer croſs their projects, your intelligence with them&nbsp;by a note, written by Louis Staniſiaus Xavier, ſigned&nbsp;by your two brothers, was conceived in theſe words :</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">‘ I wrote to yon, but it was by poſt, and I could ſay nothing. \Ve are two here, who make but one ;&nbsp;one in ſentiments, one in principles, one in zeal of&nbsp;ſerving </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">you. we </span><span class="font1">keep ſilence ; becauſe, were we to&nbsp;Jbreak it too ſoon, it would injure you : but we ſhall&nbsp;ſpeak as ſoon as we ſhall be certain oſ general ſupport,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">#ad that moment is near. If we are ſpoken to on the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">part oſ thoſe people, we ſhall hear nothing ; </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">but </span><span class="font1">iſ on&nbsp;your part, we will liſten : we ſhall purſue our road&nbsp;ſtraiglit. It is therefore deſired that you will enable us&nbsp;to ſay ſomething. Do not ſtand on ceremonies. Be eaſy&nbsp;about your ſaſety : we only exiſt to ſerve you ; we are&nbsp;eagerly occupied with this point, and all goes on well ;&nbsp;even our enemies feel themſeives too much intereſted in&nbsp;your preſervation to commit an uſeleſs crime which&nbsp;would terminate in their own deſtruction. Adieu.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">‘ L. S. </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Xavier</span><span class="font0"> and</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">‘ Charles Philippe?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&quot; what have you to anſwer ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Louis.</span><span class="font1"> &quot; I diſowned all the proceedings oſ </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">my </span><span class="font1">brothers, according as the conſtſtution preſeribed me to do, and ſrom the moment they came to my knowledge. Of&nbsp;tliis note I know nothing.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">PreJ.</span><span class="font1"> &quot; The ſoldiers of tlie line, who were to be put on the war eſtabliſhment, conſiſted but of ic 0,000&nbsp;men at the end of December, you therefore neglected&nbsp;to provide for the ſaſety of the ſtate from abroad. Nar-bonne required a levy of 50,000 men, but he ſtopped&nbsp;tlie recruiting at 26,000, in giving affnrances that all&nbsp;was ready ; yet there was no truth in theſe aſſurances.&nbsp;Servan propoſed after him to form a camp of 20,000&nbsp;men near Paris ; it was decreed by the legiſiative affem-bly 5 you reſuſed your ſanction.—what have you to&nbsp;anſwer ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Louis.</span><span class="font1"> &quot; I had given to the miniſters all the orders for expediting the augmentation of the army : in tlie&nbsp;month of December laſt, the returns were laid before&nbsp;the Aſſembly. If they deceived themſelves, it is not&nbsp;my fault.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Prof</span><span class="font1"> &quot; A ſſight of patriotiſm made tlie citizens re-pair to Paris from all quarters. You iffued a procla-mation, tending to ſtop their march ; at the ſame time our camps were without ſoldiers. Dumourier, the ſuc-ceffor of Servan, declared that the nation had neither&nbsp;arms, ammunition, nor proviſions, and that tlie poſts&nbsp;were left defenceleſs. You waited to be urged by a re-queſt made to the miniſter Lajard, when the legiſſative&nbsp;affembly wiſhed to point out the means of providing&nbsp;ſor the external ſaſety of tlie ſtate, by propoſing tlie&nbsp;levy of 42 battalions. You gave commiffion to tlie&nbsp;commanders oſ the troops to diiband the army, to force&nbsp;whole regiments to deſert, and to make them paſs the&nbsp;Rhine, to put them at tlie diſpoſal of your brothers,&nbsp;and of Leopold of Auſtria, with whom you had intelligence. Ί his fact is proved by the letter of Toulou-geon, governor of Franche Comté.—what have you&nbsp;to anſwer ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lows.</span><span class="font1"> &quot; I know nothing of this circumſtance ; there is not a word of truth in this charge.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Prof.</span><span class="font1"> &quot; You charged your diplomatſcal agents to favour this coalition of foreign powers and your brothers againſt France, and eſpecially to cement the peace&nbsp;between Turkey and Auſtria, and to procure thereby a&nbsp;larger number of troops againſt France from the latter.&nbsp;A letter of Choiſeul-Gouffier, ambaſſador at Con-ſtantinople, verifies the fact.-—what have you to an-ſwer ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Louis.</span><span class="font1"> &quot; M. Choiſeul did not ſpeak the truth : no ſuch thing has ever been.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">P'of</span><span class="font1"> “ The Pruffians advanced againſt our fron» tiers : your miniſter was ſummoned on the 8th of July&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">to give an account of </span><span class="font1">the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ſtate of our </span><span class="font1">political relations</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
