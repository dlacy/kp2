A correct knowledge of the nature and properties of steam is of such importance at the present day, that the matter ought to be taken up by government. Private individuals are not able to incur the expense necessary in conducting a complete course of the experiments which are required to fully develope such an intricate and voluminous subject.
The practice of putting two engines to a train is not considered so good as dividing the train into two, and putting one engine to each. Whatever may be the objections to the latter plan, those who argue in this way assert that no two engines will have their wheels mathematically accurate as to size, and if they had, still their rate of working, depending as it does on so many elements, would always prevent their velocity being precisely the same, except for a short time, by mere chance ; and when this is not the case, a most destructive rubbing immediately takes place. When two are working together, for instance, with driving wheels 5 feet 6 inches in diameter, the circumference will be 17∙2787 feet, and at a speed of 40 miles an hour, which is 211200 feet, or 3520 feet per minute, equal to 58∙66 feet per second, these wheels must revolve 12223 times in an hour, or 203- 71 times per minute, equal to 3∙395 times per second.
Now, if we only take half this velocity, or 20 miles an hour, or 105600 feet for the one engine, and 19 or 21 miles, or 100320 and 110880 feet respectively for the other, we

have at once a rubbing motion of no less than 5280 feet
per
hour, or one mile in twenty, with a rubbing instead ofa rolling motion. In fact, the rubbing will always be equivalent
to 
the difference between the velocities of the two engines,
and 
the loss of power, the wear and tear ; and the injury to the maèhinery by the extra steam which must be brought on all the working parts, if the above be true, may readily be imagined. A self-registering counter, fixed to ascertain the number of strokes, would easily settle this point ; to do which, it must trace the work of each engine on paper, similarly to the self-acting anemometer of Mr. Oslerof Birmingham. But for our own parts no proof is required. We are certain it is not the case, and that the speed of both engine3 becomes equalized almost immediately after they start ; that engine which would travel the fastest, doing the largest proportion of the work, and thus relieving the pistons of the other, by drawing her along at her own rate, as she would, in fact, if the steam were shut oft' altogether. A strong man and
a 
weak man working at a winch is an exactly similar case.
Before long there is no doubt that signals will be established along all considerable lines of railway. The use of them is sufficiently obvious, and they might be turned to profit also, by conveying messages of all kinds, at the rate of so much per word ; they would thus, instead of being a cost to the railway company, become a source of emolument. Communications throughoutalength of l00miles, when they can be made at one signal from each station, would be transmitted in about a minute and a quarter, and any ordinary message out of the usual course in about half an hour ; a telegraph would be prevented from working by the weather, about two months a-year in the aggregate.
There is nothing so easy as to make a telegraph book ; in fact, it is only numbering a dictionary, and the thing is done. In fact, hundreds of messages may be sent on the usual address of a newspaper, without the possibility of the post-office being at all aware of anything of the kind being carried on. In the case of a railway, each head of the different departments should send in lists of the various messages most likely to he wanted, and these could be added to, as time de-velopes what is required.
The original expense of such a thing would probably be about L.260 each station, and the annual expense about L.77 per station; to which would have to be added the salary of the superintendent, clerks, and a few supernumerary men. Their great use renders them most desirable things. For instance, an accident happens to an engine ten miles from an engine station. The telegraph would send out another engine in a minute, with any commonly good look-out ; whereas, to send on foot would require two hours, thus deranging the time of all the succeeding trains. As another instance, a train starting from one end to the other of the line, perhaps leaves 50 passengers at some intermediate town ; the telegraph might immediately make this known to the clerk of that station, who, if he had few passengers ready for the train, could prepare goods’ waggons to put on, so that the engine should not go with half a load ; a matter of great importance, for the power absorbed by an engine before it can put itself in motion, being one-third of its whole power, it follows that the relative expenditure of power per ton per mile, is nearly six times greater with a load of 10 tons than it would be with a load of 100 tons.
When accidents do happen upon railways, they may generally be expected to be extremely serious, and no means should be left unprovided, for immediate assistance being dispatched ; even an advice carriage, which might be worked at 20 miles an hour, would be but a slow method, compared with a telegraph, for instance, if medical assistance, or what is more likely, surgical assistance, was wanted. In many cases, it will be highly advantageous, particularly in a pecuniary point of view, to run trains at different velocities, passing each other bv means of sidings, the
