Lewis also avoided Mrs. Radcliffe’s error ; his ghosts are real, and his devil genuine, though, as is not uncommon, we believe, in practice, he takes the form of a woman, instead of appearing, as Defoe has it, “ in all his formalities and frightfuls.”</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">Montorio</hi>  of Maturin was also a boyish production, which the writer affected at a more advanced period of life to despise. Yet it appears to us to exhibit more genius, mingled, no doubt, with a deep vein of extravagance and false taste, than his more elaborate attempts to picture real manners and passions in his <hi rend="italic">Woman.</hi>  There was originality even in the conception, hideous as it was, of the hero employing against the brother, who had deceived him, the agency of that brother’s own sons, whom he persuades to parricide, by working on their visionary fears and by the doctrines of fatalism ; and then, when the deed is done, discovering that the victims whom he had reasoned and persecuted into crime were his own children. And though Maturin's machinery in no respect differs from that of his brethren, though he labours to explain away in the close all that had appeared supernatural in the beginning, and of course with total wantof success, yet the impression left on the mind by the perusal of the work, in the three thickest volumes we believe that modern romance has to boast of, though gloomy and unsatisfactory’, is certainly that of an inventive genius in the author. Such was the effect it produced on Sir Walter Scott, who was the first to direct attention to it, by a criticism in the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Review</hi>  for 1810. “ We have strolled,” says he in a lively introduction, “ through a variety of castles, each of which was regularly called II Castello ; met with many captains of condottieri ; heard various ejaculations of Santa Maria and Diabolo; read, by a decaying lamp, and in a tapestried chamber, dozens of legends as stupid as the main history ; examined such suites of deserted apartments as might set up a reasonable barrack, and saw as many glimmering lights as would make a respectable illumination. Amidst these flat imitations of the <hi rend="italic">Castle of Udolpho,</hi>  we lighted unexpectedly upon the work which is the subject of the present article, and in defiance of the very bad taste in which it is composed, we found ourselves unusually involved in the perusal, and at times impressed with no common degree of respect for the powers of the author.”</p><p>Of the Zelucco of Dr. Moore, which appeared about 1785, we have already spoken at some length in our Biographical article.</p><p>The influence of such works as Goethe’s <hi rend="italic">Sorrows of Werther,</hi>  written seemingly with the view of reversing Pope’s maxim, and proving that whatever is is wrong, becomes very obvious in our literature of fiction towards the close of the eighteenth century. For, in truth, such speculations, embodied in an imaginative form, were found highly congenial to that spirit of restlesness and discontent with political institutions which was every where abroad, perplexing nations with fear of change, and leading men of genius to dress up moral paradoxes in the shape of narrative, and to employ their eloquence in attacking those principles of society which tend to make men happy, or which keep them so. This tendency appears sufficiently obvious in the novels of Bage, a sceptic in religion, and a latitudinarian in morals, whose crude theories, we think, might have been allowed to repose in that oblivion to which they had been consigned, without being revived in such a work as the <hi rend="italic">Novelist's Library.</hi>  Their introduction at all into a work intended to embody only the classical works of fiction, seems unaccountable ; nor is the singularity diminished by the fact that his best work, <hi rend="italic">Herms-ρrong, or Man as he is not,</hi>  is omitted, while three of inferior merit are re-published.</p><p>But the social and political theories of the time found an abler exponent in Godwin, whose first work, <hi rend="italic">Caleb</hi></p><lb/><p><hi rend="italic">Williams,</hi>  appeared in 1794, in which, throwing aside the stimulus of the marvellous, he has trusted the effect of his tale entirely to a picture of the workings of the mind on two beings of very opposite natures, who are driven, by a species of fatal instinct, into the relative positions of persecutor and victim. Tbe doctrines of the <hi rend="italic">Political Justice </hi>furnished avowedly the primary source of the inspiration of <hi rend="italic">Caleb Williams,</hi>  intended, to use the words of tile preface, “ to furnish a general review of the modes of domestic and unrecorded despotism, by which man becomes the destroyer of man ;” that is to say, to shew that, under the maladministration of English law, liable to be perverted by influence and wealth, the chances are all in favour of the escape of the real criminal and the conviction of the innocent ; a proposition notoriously untrue, and which is not even advocated with much art or plausibility in the series of persecutions to which Williams is exposed. Fortunately, however, for the real merit and permanent popularity of this singular work, the political design soon merges in a higher and more legitimate interest. The genius of the author kindles as he proceeds, and out of a hard and republican background brings forth the bright and chivalrous vision of the aristocratic Falkland, a being of a loving noble nature, the victim of false honour and morbid refinement of feeling. Few scenes in romance exceed in breathless and entrancing interest the description of the progress of suspicion in the mind of Williams, till he extorts from his master the fatal secret, on which hangs the whole of his future fate ; the escape from prison in the grey dawn of a drizzling morning ; and the last interview between Williams and his dying persecutor, sitting, corpse-like, to hear his secret disclosed to the world, and to suffer the agony of knowing that life and reputation are about to leave him together.</p><p>In none of his other works did Godwin evince the same grandeur of conception, and in none of his subsequent personations, except Bethlehem Gabor, did he exhibit that pow*er of presenting demoniacal characters, such as Tyrrell and Gines, in a light which renders them, unnatural as they are, actual objects of terror, like a serpent in the path. The tone of his next novel, <hi rend="italic">St. Leon,</hi>  is altogether more subdued than that of <hi rend="italic">Caleb Williams.</hi>  It has a mournful eloquence in harmony with the picture of desolation which it presents. Here, too, the author has imperfectly succeeded in working out the design which he announces he had in view ; namely, that of proving that the happiness of mankind w<hi rend="sup">r</hi>ould not have been augmented by tile gifts of immortal youth and inexhaustible riches ; for, in order to illustrate his position, Godwin is under the necessity of laying the scene in a remote age, and making the persecutions of St. Leon arise from feelings of superstitious credulity, which we cannot help recollecting that the progress of intelligence has since exploded. The senior wrangler, who asked what<hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost </hi>proved, would certainly therefore have been dissatisfied with Godwin’s demonstration ; but as the vehicle of a series of most touching and impressive scenes, his plot is farfrom deficient in interest, nor, granting its premises, in probability. “ How minute,” says an eloquent critic, “ how pathetic, how tragical is the detail of the gradual ruin which falls on this weak devoted man, up to its heart-breaking consummation in the death of the noble Marguerite de Damville ; how tremendous and perfect is the desolation, after voluntarily leaving his daughters, and cutting the last thread which binds him to his kind ! How complete is the description of his escape from the procession of the auto da fé ; of his entrance into the Jew’s house, his fears, his decaying strength, just serving to make up the life-restoring elixir, the dying taper, the insensibility, the resurrection to new life, and the day-spring of his young manhood ! How shall we speak of the old man, the bequeather of the fatal legacy to St. Leon, and his fearful words : ‘Friendless, friendless ! alone,</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
