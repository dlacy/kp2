<p><span class="font2">qttence ariſe from thus founding diſtinctions </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">on </span><span class="font2">ratios of time, which it may be ſaid are too nice to be often&nbsp;rightly hit upon : for if a confuſion ſhould happen between that of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">colon</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">period,</span><span class="font2"> there is perhaps fo&nbsp;trifling a difference between the nature of the paffages&nbsp;they ſucceed, as to make a ſmall inaccuracy of no con-ſequence. And as to the reſts of the ſemicolon and&nbsp;period, it will not be eaſy to miſtake about them, as&nbsp;their, ratio is that of two to one. Add to this the&nbsp;power which the matter and introduction of-the ſub-ſequent paffages have to rectify any flight errδr here&nbsp;made, and we ſhall be fully ſatisſied, that the pauſes&nbsp;as uſually explained, with the cadence above defcribed,&nbsp;and a proper knowledge of the language, will convey&nbsp;fufficient information to the underſtanding of the con-ſtructive nature of the paffages after which they are&nbsp;found.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It may be obſerved, that in natural fpeech, accord-ing to the warmth and agitation of the ſpeaker, the reſts are often ſhort and injudiciouſly proportioned, and&nbsp;hence that eveιy thing thus delivered cannot be ſo grace-ful as it might have been from a proper attention to&nbsp;their magnitude and effects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Pauſes then, though chiefly ſubjected to the ſenſe, are, as was remarked at the outſet, ſerviceable in&nbsp;beautifying the modulation, &amp;c.—And ſince books&nbsp;are often inaccurately printed as to points, and peo-ple’s taſtes differ fome little about their place and va-Iue, it appears, that, &quot; although in reading great attention ſhould be paid to the ſtops, yet a greater&nbsp;ihould be given to the ſenſe, and their coreſpondent&nbsp;times occafionally lengthened beyond what is uſual in&nbsp;common ſpeech which obſervation contains all that&nbsp;we ſhall pretend to lay down by way of rule for the&nbsp;management of pauſes in the delivery of written lan</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">guage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As there are two or three ſpecies of writing, which have ſomething ſingular in them, and with regard to&nbsp;the manner in which they ſhould be read, a few </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">particular</span><span class="font2"> remarks ſeem neceffarily required, we ſhall con-clude this article with laying them before the reader :</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">of </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Plays,</span><span class="font2"> and ſuch like </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">conversation-pièces.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">Writings of this kind maybe conſidered as intended for&nbsp;two different purpoſes ; one to unfold ſubject matter for&nbsp;the exercife of theatric powers ; and the other to convey&nbsp;amuſement, merely as fable replete with pleaſing incidents and characteriſtic maimers. Hence there appears&nbsp;to be great latitude for the diſplay of a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">conſflent</span><span class="font2"> delivery&nbsp;of theſe performances : for while, on one hand, a good&nbsp;reader of very inferior talents for mimicry may be heard&nbsp;with a tolerable degree of pleaſure ; on the other, if any&nbsp;perſon is qualified to give a higher degree of life and&nbsp;force to the dialogue and characters by delivering them&nbsp;as an actor, he muſt be fully at liberty to ſtart from the&nbsp;confinement of a chair to a poſture and area more ſuit-ed to his abilities ; and, if he be not deceived in himſelf,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">his hearers will be conſiderable gainers by the change._</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The next article is,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sermons</span><span class="font2"> or other </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">orations,</span><span class="font2"> which in like man-tier may be conceived intended for a double purpoſe.&nbsp;Firſt, as matter for the diſplay of oratorical powers ;&nbsp;aιwl, ſecondly, as perſuaſive diſcourſes, &amp;c. which may&nbsp;be read like any other book. Therefore it appears (for&nbsp;reaſons ſimilar to thoſe above) that according as clergymen are poffeffed of the talents </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">of elocution, </span><span class="font2">they&nbsp;may conſiſtently either rehearſe their fermons, in </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">manner of an extemporary harangue, or deliver them&nbsp;in the more humble capacity of one -who is content to&nbsp;entertain and inſtruct his hearers with reading to them&nbsp;his own or ſome other perſon’s written diſcourſe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Ί hat either of theſe manners of delivery (or a mixture of them), in either of the cafes above-mentioned, is agreeable, we find on a careful exa. ſination. For this&nbsp;will ſhow us how frequently they run into one another;&nbsp;and that we are ſo far from thinking ſuch tranſitions&nbsp;wrong, that, without a particular attention that way,&nbsp;we fcarce ever perceive them at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">3. </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Poetry</span><span class="font2"> is the next and laſt object of our prefent remarks. This is a very peculiar kind of writing, and as&nbsp;much different from the language of ordinary difcourſe&nbsp;as the movements of the dance are from common w..<sub>i</sub>k-ing. 1 o ornament and improve whatever is ſubfervient&nbsp;to the pleaſures and amufements of life, is the delight of&nbsp;human nature, we are alfo pleaſed with a kind o£&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">excefi.</span><span class="font2"> in any thing which has a power to amuſe the fart-cy, inſpire us with enthuſiaſm, or awaken the ſoul to </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">3&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">conſciouſneſs of its own importance and dignity. Hence&nbsp;one pleaſure, at leaft, takes its riſe, that we feel in con-templating the performances of every art ; and hence&nbsp;the language&quot;, of poetry, conſiſting of a meaſured ryth-mus, harmonious cadences, and an elevated pictureſqn¢&nbsp;diction, has been ſtudied by the ingenious, and found&nbsp;to have a powerful influence over the human breaſt </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">in&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">every age and region. There is ſuch an affinity between&nbsp;this language and muſic, that they were in the earlier&nbsp;ages never ſeparated; and though modern refinement&nbsp;has in a great meaſure deſtroyed this union, yet it </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">is&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">with fome degree of difficulty in rehearfing thefe divine&nbsp;compofitions we can forget tlie finging of the muſe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">From theſe confiderations (and ſome kindred ones mentioned in ſect. iii.) in repeating verſes, they are ge-nerally accompanied with a modulation rather more or-namented and mufical than is uſed in any other kind of&nbsp;writing. And accordingly, as there ſeems to bc the&nbsp;greateſt propriety in the practice, the rule for this par-ticular in the ſection juſt referred to, will allow any lati∙&gt;&nbsp;tude in it that can gain the ſanction of taſte and pleaſure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rhymes</span><span class="font2"> in the lighter and more ſoothing provinces of poetry are found to have </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font2">good effect ; and hence&nbsp;(for reaſons like thoſe juſt ſuggeſted) it is certainly&nbsp;abſurd to endeavour to {mother them by a feeble pro*&nbsp;nuπciation, and running one line precipitately into another, as is often affected to be done by many of our </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">mo</span><span class="font2">dern readers and ſpeakers. By this method they not on»&nbsp;ly deftroy one ſource of pleaſure intended by the com-poſer (which though not great is nevertheleſs genuine),&nbsp;but even often ſupply its place with what is really diſa-greeable, by making the rhymes, as they are interruptedly perceived, appear accidental blemiſhes of a different&nbsp;ſtyle, arifing from an unmeaning recurrence of fimilar&nbsp;founds, with regard then to reading verſes terminated&nbsp;with rhyme, the common rule, which directs to prδ-nounce the final words </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">full,</span><span class="font2"> and to diſtinguiſh them by&nbsp;a flight pauſe even where there is none required by the&nbsp;fen le, ſeems the moſt rational, and conſequently moſt&nbsp;worthy, of being followed. See </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Declamation, Na&amp;-</span><span class="font2">RAτi0N,and </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">oratory.</span></p>
