<p><span class="font0">RICHARDSON (Samuel), a celebrated Engliſh ſentimental novel-writer, born in 1688, was bred to&nbsp;the buſineſs of a printer, which he exerciſed all his life&nbsp;with eminence. Though he is ſaid to have uijderſtood&nbsp;no language but his own, yet he acquired great reputation by his three epiſtolary novels, intitled </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pamela,&nbsp;Clariſſa,</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sir Charles Grandiſon ;</span><span class="font0"> which ſhow an&nbsp;uncommon knowledge of human nature. His purpoſe&nbsp;being to promote virtue, his pictures of moral excellence are by much too highly coloured ; and he has de-ſcribed his favourite characters ſuch rather as we might&nbsp;wiſh them to be, than as they are to be found in reality. It is alſo objected by ſome, that his writings&nbsp;have not always the good effect intended : for that, in-ftead of improving natural characters, they have fa-ſhioned many artificial ones ; and have taught delicate&nbsp;and refined ladies and gentlemen to deſpiſe every one&nbsp;but their own ſelf-exalted perſons. But after all that&nbsp;can be urged of the ill effects of Mr Richardſon’s novels on weak minds, eager to adopt characters they&nbsp;can only burleſque ; a ſeniible reader will improve more&nbsp;by ſtudying ſuch models of perfection, than of thoſe&nbsp;nearer to the natural ſtandard of human frailty, and&nbsp;where thoſe frailties are artfully exaggerated ſo as to </span><span class="font1">fix&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and miſemploy the attention on them. A ſtroke of the&nbsp;palfy carried off Mr Richardſon, after a few days ill-neſs, upon the 4th of July 1761. He was a man of&nbsp;fine parts, and a lover of virtue ; which, for aught we&nbsp;have ever heard to the contrary, he ſhowed in his life&nbsp;and conversation as well as in his writings. Beſides&nbsp;the works above-mentioned, he is the author of an Æ-ſop’s Fables, a Tour through Britain, 4 vols, and a&nbsp;volume of Familiar Letters upon buſineſs and other&nbsp;ſubjects. He is ſaid from his childhood to have delighted in letter-writing ; and therefore was the more&nbsp;eaſily led to throw his romances into that form; which,&nbsp;if it enlivens the hiſtory in ſome reſpects, yet lengthens it with unintereſting prate, and formalities that&nbsp;mean nothing, and on that account is ſometimes found&nbsp;a little tedious and fatiguing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The moſt eminent writers of our own country,, and even of foreign parts, have paid their tribute to the&nbsp;tranſcendant talents of Mr Richardſon, whoſe works&nbsp;have been publiſhed in almoſt every language and country of Europe. They have been greatly admired, not-withſtanding every diſſimilitude of manners, or every&nbsp;diſadvantage of tranſlation. M. Diderot, a late celebrated French author, ſpeaking of the means employed&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font0">move the paſſions, in his Eſſay on Dramatic Poetry,&nbsp;mentions Richardſon as a perfect maſter of that art :</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ How ſtriking (ſays he), how pathetic, are his deſcrip-tions ! His perſonages, though filent, are alive before me ; and of thoſe who ſpeak, the actions are ſtill more&nbsp;affecting than the words.”—The famous John-James&nbsp;Rouſſeau, ſpeaking, in his letter to M. d’Alembert, of&nbsp;the novels of Richardſon, aſſerts, “ that nothing was&nbsp;ever written equal to, or even approaching them, in any&nbsp;language.”—Mr Aaron Hill calls his Pamela a “ delightful nurſery of virtue.”—Dr Warton ſpeaks thus of&nbsp;Clementina : “ Of all repreſentations of madneſs, that&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font0">Clementina, in the Hiſtory of </span><span class="font1">Sir Charles Grandiſon,</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">is the moſt deeply intereſting. </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font0">know not whether even the madneſs of Lear is wrought up, and expreſſed,&nbsp;by ſo many little ſtrokes of nature and paſſion. It is&nbsp;abſolute pedantry to prefer and compare the madneſs&nbsp;of Oreſtes in Euripides to this of Clementina.”—Dr&nbsp;Johnſon, in his Introduction to the 97th number of the&nbsp;Rambler, which was written by Mr Richardſon, ob-ſerves, that the reader was indebted for that day’s en-tertainment to an author, “ from whom the age has received greater favours, who has enlarged the knowledge&nbsp;of human nature, and taught the paſſions to move at&nbsp;the command of virtue and, in his Life of Rowe,&nbsp;he ſays, “ The character of Lothario ſeems to have&nbsp;been expanded by Richardfon into that of Lovelace ;&nbsp;but he has excelled his original in the moral effect of&nbsp;the fiction. Lothario, with gaiety which cannot be&nbsp;hated, and bravery which cannot be deſpifed, retains&nbsp;too much of the ſpectator’s kindneſs. It was in the&nbsp;power of Richardſon alone to teach us at once eſteem&nbsp;and deteſtation ; to make virtuous reſentment overpower&nbsp;all the benevolence which wit, and elegance, and courage, naturally excite ; and to loſe at laſt the hero in&nbsp;the villain.”—Dr Young very pertinently obſerved,&nbsp;that Mr Richardſon, with the mere advantages of nature, improved by a very moderate progreſs in education, ſtruck out at once, and of his own accord, into a&nbsp;new province of writing, in which he ſucceeded to admiration. And what is more remarkable, that he not&nbsp;only began, but finiſhed, the plan on which he ſet out,&nbsp;leaving no room for any one after him to render it more&nbsp;complete : and that not one of the various writers that</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">have ever ſince attempted to imitate him, have in any reſpect equalled, or at all approached near him. This&nbsp;kind of romance is peculiarly his own; and “ I conſider&nbsp;him (continues the Doctor) as a truly great natural&nbsp;genius; as great and ſupereminent in his way as&nbsp;Shakeſpeare and Milton were in theirs.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">RichaRdson (Jonathan), a celebrated painter of heads, was born about the year 166y, and againſt his&nbsp;inclination was placed by his father-in-law apprentice&nbsp;to a ſcrivener, with whom he lived fix years ; when obtaining his freedom by the death of his maſter, he followed the bent of his diſpoſition, and at 20 years old&nbsp;became the diſciple of Riley ; with whom he lived four&nbsp;years, whoſe niece he married, and of whoſe manner he&nbsp;acquired enough to maintain a ſolid and laſting reputation, even during the lives of Kneller and Dahl ; and&nbsp;to remain at the head of the profeſſion when they went&nbsp;off the ltage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There is ſtrength, roundneſs, and boldneſs in his colouring ; but his men want dignity, and his women grace. The good ſenſe of the nation is characteriſed&nbsp;in his portraits. You ſee he lived in an age when neither enthuſiaſm nor ſervility were predominant. Yet&nbsp;with a pencil ſo firm, poſſeſſed of a numerous and excellent collection of drawings, full of the theory, and&nbsp;profound in reflections on his art, he drew nothing we’ll&nbsp;below the head, and was void of imagination. His attitudes, draperies, and back-grounds, are totally inſipid&nbsp;and unmeaning ; ſo ill did he apply to his own practice&nbsp;the ſagacious rules and hints he beſtowed on others.&nbsp;Though he wrote with fire and judgment, his paintings&nbsp;owed little to either. No man dived deeper into the&nbsp;inexhauſtible ſtores of Raphael, or was more ſmitten&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">with the native luſtre </span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font1">Vandyck. Yet though caps-</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
