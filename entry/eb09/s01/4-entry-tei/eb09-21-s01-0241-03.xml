the name of the third among those native dynasties which sprang up in the 9th and 10th centuries in the eastern portions of Persia, and, although</p><p>nominally provincial governors under the suzerainty of the caliphs of Baghdad, succeeded in a very short time in establishing an almost independent rule over the vast territories round the Oxus and Jaxartes. The Ma’mún, Hárún-al- rashid’s son, to whose patronage the Táhirid family owed their supremacy in Khorásán and Transoxiana (820-872, 205-259 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.h.)</hi> appointed three sons of Sámán, originally a Tartar chief who claimed descent from the old Sásánian kings, governors of Herát and some districts beyond the Oxus; and these soon gained such an ascendency over all rival clanships that in 872, when the Táhirids were overthrown by the Saffárids under the leadership of Ya'ḳúb b. Laith (868-878), they were strong enough to retain in their family the governorship of Transoxiana, with the official sanction of the caliph Mo'tamid (870-892), and to establish a semi-royal court in Bokhárá, the seat of the new Sámánid government. During the reign of Ya'ḳúb’s brother 'Amr b. Laith (878-900) Isma'il b. Ahmad, Sámán’s great-grandson (892-907, 279-295 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.h.),</hi> crossed the Oxus with a powerful army, invaded the territory of the Saffárids, sent 'Amr as prisoner to Baghdad, and gradually extended his rule over Khorásán, Khwárizm, Jurján, and the neighbouring countries. His successors, all renowned by the high impulse they gave both to the patriotic feelings and the national poetry of modern Persia (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Persia,</hi> vol. xviii. p. 655 <hi rend="italic">sq.),</hi> were Ahmad b. Isma'íl (907-913, 295-301 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.h.) ;</hi> Nasr II. b. Ahmad, the patron and friend of the great poet Rúdagí (913-942, 301-331 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.h.);</hi> Núh I. b. Naṣr (942-954, 331-343 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.h.);</hi> 'Abd al-Malik I. b. Núḥ (954-961, 343-350 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.h.);</hi> Mansur I. b. Núḥ, whose vizier Bal'amí translated Tabari’s universal history into Persian (961-976, 350-366 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.h.);</hi> Núḥ II. b. Mansur, whose court-poet Daḳíḳí commenced the <hi rend="italic">Sháhnáma</hi> (976-997, 366-387 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.h.)</hi>; Mansur II. b. Núḥ (997-998, 387-389 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.h.);</hi> and 'Abd al-Malik II. b. Núḥ (999), with whom the Sámánid dynasty came to a rather abrupt end. The rulers of this powerful house, whose silver dirhems had an extensive currency during the 10th century all over the northern part of Asia, and were brought, through Russian caravans, even so far as to Pomerania, Sweden, and Norway, where Sámánid coins have lately been found in great number, suffered in their turn the fate they had prepared for their predecessors; they were overthrown by a more youthful and vigorous race, that of Sabuktagín, which founded the illustrious Ghaznawid dynasty and the Mussulman empire of India. Under 'Abd al-Malik I. a Turkish slave, Alptagín, had been entrusted with the government of Bokhárá, but, showing himself hostile to 'Abd al-malik’s successor Mansur I., he was compelled to fly and to take refuge in the mountainous regions of Ghazna, where he soon established a semi-independent rule, to which, after his death in 977 (367 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.h.),</hi> his son-in-law Sabuktagín, likewise a former Turkish slave, succeeded. Núḥ II., in order to retain at least a nominal sway over those Afghán territories, confirmed him in his high position and even invested Sabuktagín’s son Maḥmtúd with the governorship of Khorásán, in reward for the powerful help they had given him in his desperate struggles with a confederation of disaffected nobles of Bokhárá under the leadership of Fá’iḳ and the troops of the Dailamites, a dynasty that had arisen on the shores of the Caspian Sea and wrested already from the hands of the Sámánids all their western provinces. Unfortunately, Sabuktagín died in the same year as Núḥ II. (997, 387 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.h.),</hi> and Mahmud, confronted with an internal contest against his own brother Isma'íl, had to withdraw his attention for a short time from the affairs in Khorásán and Transoxiana. This interval sufficed for the old rebel leader Fa’iḳ, supported by a strong Tartar army under Ilekkhán, to turn Núḥ’s successor Manṣúr II. into a mere puppet, to concentrate all the<pb facs="encyclopediabrit21newyrich_raw_0262.jp2" xml:id="eb09-21-s01-0242"/>
power in his own hand, and to induce even his nominal master to reject Maḥmúd’s application for a continuance of his governorship in Khorásán. Maḥmúd refrained for the moment from vindicating his right; but, as soon as, through court intrigues, Mansur II. had been dethroned, he took possession of Khorásán, deposed Manṣúr’s successor ‘Abd al-Malik II., and assumed as an independent monarch for the first time in Asiatic history the title of “sultán.” The last descendant of the house of Sámán, Prince Muntaṣir, a bold warrior and a poet of no mean talent, carried on for some years a kind of guerilla warfare against both Maḥmúd and Ilekkhán, who had occupied Transoxiana, till he was assassinated in 1005 (395 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.h.).</hi> Transoxiana itself was annexed to the Ghaznawid realm eleven years later, 1016 (407 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.h.).</hi></p></div></body></text></TEI>
