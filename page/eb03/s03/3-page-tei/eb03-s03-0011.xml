The ſame thing happens to perſons much fatigued, or long kept awake, who frequently fall aſleep for a moment, or for a long ſpace, while they are ſtanding, or walking, or riding on horſeback. Add but a lively dream to this ſlumber, and (which is the frequent effect of diſeaſe) take away the conſciouſneſs of having been aſleep, and a ſuperſtitious man may eaſily miſtake his dream for a waking viſion; which, however, is ſoon forgotten when no fubſequent occurrence recals it to his memory; but which, if it ſhall be thought to reſemble any future event, exalts the poor dreamer into a Highland prophet. This conceit makes him more recluſe and more melancholy than ever; and ſo feeds his  diſeaſe, and multiplies his viſions: which, if they are not diſſipated by buſineſs or ſociety, may continue to haunt him as long as he lives; and which, in their progreſs through the neighbourhood, receive ſome new tinctures <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the marvellous from every mouth that promotes their circulation. As to the prophetical nature of this ſecond ſight, it cannot be admitted at all. That the Deity ſhould work a miracle in order to give intimation of the frivolous things that theſe tales are made up of, the arrival of a ſtranger, the nailing of a coffin, or the colour of a ſuit of clothes; and that theſe intimations ſhould be given for no end, and to thoſe perſons only who are idle and ſolitary, who ſpeak Gaelic, or who live among mountains and deferts—is like nothing in nature or providence that we are acquainted with; and muſt therefore, unleſs it were confirmed by ſatisfactory proof (which is not the caſe), be rejected as abſurd and incredible.</p><p>Theſe viſions, ſuch as they are, may reaſonably enough be aſcribed to a diſtempered fancy. And that in them, as well as in our ordinary dreams, certain appearances ſhould, on ſome rare occaſions, reſemble certain events, is to be expected from the laws of chance; and ſeems to have in it nothing more marvellous or ſupernatural, than that the parrot, who deals out his ſcurrilities at random, ſhould ſometimes happen to ſalute the paſſenger by his right appellation.</p><p>To the confidence of theſe objections Dr Johnſon replies, that by preſuming to determine what is fit, and what is beneficial, they preſuppofe more knowledge of the univerſal ſyſtem than man has attained; and therefore depend upon principles too complicated and extensive for our comprehenſion; and that there can be no ſecurity in the conſequence when the premiſes are not underſtood; that the ſecond ſight is only wonderful becauſe it is rare, for, conſidered in itſelf, it involves no more difficulty than dreams, or perhaps than the regular exerciſe of the cogitative faculty; that a general opinion of communicative impulſes, or viſionary repreſentations, has prevailed in all ages and all nations; that particular inſtances have been given with ſuch evidence, as neither Bacon nor Bayle has been able to reſiſt; that ſudden impreſſions, which the event has verified, have been felt by more than own or publiſh them; that the ſecond ſight of the Hebrides implies only the local frequency of a power, which is nowhere totally unknown; and that where we are unable to decide by antecedent reaſon, we muſt be content to yield to the force of teſtimony. By pretenſion to ſecond ſight, no profit was ever ſought <hi rend="italic">or</hi> gained. It is an involuntary affection, in which neither hope nor fear are known to have any part. Thoſe who profeſs to feel it do not boaſt of it as a privilege, nor are conſidered by others as advantageouſly diſtinguiſhed. They have no temptation to feign, and their hearers have no motive to encourage the impoſture.</p><p><hi rend="italic smallcaps">Second</hi><hi rend="italic"> Terms</hi>, in algebra, thoſe where the unknown quantity has a degree of power leſs than it has in the term where it is raiſed to the higheſt.

Of theſe there are ſeveral kinds; as, 1. Secretaries of ſtate, who are officers that have under their management and direction the moſt important affairs of the kingdom, and are obliged conſtantly to attend on the king: they receive and diſpatch whatever comes to their hands, either from the crown, the church, the army, private grants, pardons, diſpenſations, &amp;c. as likewiſe petitions to the ſovereign, which, when read, are returned to them; all which they diſpatch according to the king’s direction. They have authority to commit perſons for treaſon, and other offences againſt the ſtate, as conſervators of the peace at common law, or as juſtices of the peace throughout the kingdom. They are members of the privy-council, which is ſeldom or never held without one of them being preſent. As to the buſineſs and correſpondence in all parts of this kingdom, it is managed by either of the ſecretaries without any diſtinction; but with reſpect to foreign affairs, the buſineſs is divided into two provinces or departments, the ſouthern and the northern, comprehending all the kingdoms and ſtates that have any intercourſe with Great Britain; each ſecretary receiving all letters and addreſſes from, and making all diſpatches to, the ſeveral princes and ſtates comprehended in his province. Ireland and the Plantations are under the direction of the elder ſecretary, who has the ſouthern province, which alio comprehends France, Italy, Switzerland, Spain, Portugal, and Turkey; the northern province includes the Low Coun-</p></body></text></TEI>
