<p><span class="font1">to the difference of preſſure, we muſt always take in the preffure of the atmoſphere ; and thus the preffure&nbsp;at 33 feet deep is not 33 times the preffure at one foot&nbsp;deep, but only double, or twice as great. The atmo-fpheric preffure is omitted only when the reſiſted plane&nbsp;is at the very furface. D’Ulloa, in his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Examino Mori·&nbsp;timo,</span><span class="font1"> has introduced an equation expreſſing this relation ; but, except with very limited conditions, it will&nbsp;miſiead us prodigiouſly. To give a general notion of&nbsp;its foundation, let AB (ſig. 23.) be the fiction of a&nbsp;plane moving through a fluid in the direction CD, with&nbsp;a known velocity. The fluid will bc heaped up before&nbsp;it above its natural level CD, becaufe the water will not&nbsp;be puſhed before it like a ſolid body, but will be puſh-ed aſide. And it cannot acquire a lateral motion any&nbsp;other way than by an accumulation, which will diffuſe&nbsp;itfilf in all directions by the law of undulatory motion. The water will alſo be left lower behind the&nbsp;plane, becaufe time </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">muβ</span><span class="font1"> elapſe before-the preffure of&nbsp;the water behind can make it fill the ſpace. We may&nbsp;acquire ſome notion of the extent oſ both the accumulation and depreſſion in this way. There is a certain</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&lt;υ<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">depth CF (= —, where ∙υ is the velocity, and ;· the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">accelerating power of gravity) under the ſurface, fucſh that water would flow through a hole at F with the velocity of the plane’s motion. Draw a horizontal line FG.&nbsp;The water will certainly touch the plane in G, and we&nbsp;may ſuppoſe that it touches it no higher up. Therefore&nbsp;there will be a hollow, fuch as CGE. The elevation&nbsp;HE will be regulated by confiderations nearly fimilar.&nbsp;ED muff be equal to the velocity of the plane, and HE&nbsp;asuſt be its productive height. Thus, if the velocity&nbsp;¢ff the plane be one foot </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">per</span><span class="font1"> feeond, HE and EG will&nbsp;be -,⅛of an inch. This is ſnſſicient (though not exact)&nbsp;for giving us a notion of the thing. We fie that from&nbsp;this muſt ariſe a preffure in the direction DC, viz. the&nbsp;preffure of the whole column HG.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Something of the ſame kind will happen although thc plane AB be wholly immerged, and this even to&nbsp;fome depth, we fie ſuch elevations in a ſwift running&nbsp;ſtream, where there are large ftones at the bottom.—&nbsp;This occafions an excels of preffure in the direction op-poſite to the plane’s motion ; and we ſee that there&nbsp;muſt, in every caſe, be a relation between the velocity&nbsp;and this exceſs of preſſure. This D’Ulloa expreſſes by&nbsp;an equation. But it is very exceptionable, not taking&nbsp;properly into the account the comparative facility with&nbsp;which the water can heap up and diſſuſe itfilf. It muſt&nbsp;always heap up till it acquires a ſuſſicient head of water&nbsp;to produce a lateral and progreſſive diſſufion ſufficient&nbsp;for the purpofe. It is evident, that a ſmaller elevation&nbsp;will ſuſſice when the body is more immerfid, becaufe&nbsp;the check or impulfi given by the body below is propagated, not vertically only, but in every direction ; and&nbsp;therefore the elevation is not confined to that part of&nbsp;the ſurface which is immediately above the moving body,&nbsp;but extends ſo much farther laterally as the centre of&nbsp;agitation is deeper : Thus, the elevation neceſſary for&nbsp;the paſſage of the body is ſo much ſmaller ; and it is&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">height</span><span class="font1"> only of this accumulation or wave which de-termines the backward preſſure on the body. D’Ulloa’s&nbsp;equation may happen to quadrate with two experiments&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">at </span><span class="font1">different depths, without being nearly juſt ; for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">any&nbsp;two</span><span class="font1"> points may </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font1">in </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font1">curves without exhibiting its</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">equation. Three points will do it with ſome approach to precifion ; but four, at leaſt, are neceſſary for giving&nbsp;any notion of its nature. D’Ulloa has only given two&nbsp;experiments, which we mentioned in another place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">we may here obſerve, that it is this circumſtance which immediately produces the great reſiſtance to the&nbsp;motion of a body through a fluid in a narrow canal.—.&nbsp;The fluid cannot paſs the body, unleſs the area of thc&nbsp;fiction be ſufficiently extenſive. A narrow canal pre-vents the extenſion ſidewiſe. The water muſt therefore&nbsp;heap up, till the fiction and velocity of diſſuſton are&nbsp;ſuſſiciently enlarged, and thus a great backward preſſure&nbsp;is produced. (See the ficondfiries of Experiments by&nbsp;the French Academicians ; fie alſo Franklin’s Eſſays.)&nbsp;It is important, and will be conſidered in another place,.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">T h us have we attempted to give our readers ſome account of one of the moſt intereſting problems in the whole of mechanical philoſophy. we are ſorry that ſo&nbsp;little advantage can be derived from the united efforts&nbsp;of the .firſt mathematicians of Europe, and that there&nbsp;is ſo little hope of greatly improving our ſcientific&nbsp;knowledge of the ſubjtct. what we have delivered will,&nbsp;however, enable our readers to perufi the writings of&nbsp;thofi who have applied the theories to practical pur-pofis. Such, for inſtance, are the treatifis of John&nbsp;Bernoulli, of Bouguer, and of Euler, on the conſtruc-tion and working of ihips, and the occaſtonal diſſerta-tions of different authors on water-mills. In this laſt&nbsp;application the ordinary theory is not without its value, for the itnpulſes are nearly perpendicular ; in which&nbsp;caſe they do not materially deviate from the duplicate&nbsp;proportion of the fine of incidence. But even here this&nbsp;theory, applied as it commonly is, miileads us exceedingly. The impulſe on one float may be accurately&nbsp;enough ſtated by it ; but the authors have not been attentive to the motion of the water after it has made its&nbsp;impulfi ; and the impulſe on the next float is ſtated the&nbsp;ſame as if the parallel filaments of water, which were&nbsp;not ſtopped by the preceding float, did impinge on the&nbsp;oppofite part of the ficond, in the ſame manner, and&nbsp;with the ſame obliquity and energy, as if it were detached ſrom the reſt. But this does not in the leaſt re-fcmble the real proceſs of nature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Suppoſe the floats B, C, D, H (fig. 24.) oſ a wheel immerſed in a ſtream whoſe ſurface moves in the direction AK, and that this ſurface meets the float B in E.&nbsp;The part B E alone is ſuppoſed to be impelled ; whereas&nbsp;the water, checked by the float, heaps up on it to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.—∙&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">Then drawing the horizontal line BF, the part CF of&nbsp;the next float is ſuppofid to be all that is impelled by&nbsp;the parallel filaments of the ſtream ; whereas the water&nbsp;bends round the lower edge of the float B by the fur-rounding preſſure, and riles on the float </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">c</span><span class="font1"> all the way&nbsp;to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">f.</span><span class="font1"> In like manner, the float D, inſtead of receiving&nbsp;an impulſe on the very fmall portion D G, is impelled all&nbsp;the way from D to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">g,</span><span class="font1"> not much below the lurface of&nbsp;the ſtream. The ſurfaces impelled at once, therefore,&nbsp;greatly exceed what this ſiovenly application of the&nbsp;theory ſuppoſes, and the whole impulſe is much greater;&nbsp;but this is a fault in the application, and not in the&nbsp;theory. It will not be a very difficult thing to acquire&nbsp;a knowledge of the motion of the water which has&nbsp;paſſed the preceding float, which, though not accurate,&nbsp;will yet approximate conſiderably to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">truth; </span><span class="font1">and</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
