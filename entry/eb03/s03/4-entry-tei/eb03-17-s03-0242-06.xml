is the act of tempting and drawing aſide ſrom the right path, and comprehends every endeavour to corrupt any individual of the human race. This is the import of the word in its largeſt and moſt general ſenſe; but it is commonly employed to expreſs the act of tempting a virtuous woman to part with her chaſtity.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">ſeducer</hi> of female innocence practiſes the fame ſtratagems of fraud to get poſſeſſion of a woman’s perſon, that the <hi rend="italic">ſiuindler</hi> employs to get poſſeſſion of his neighbour’s goods or money; yet the law of honour, which pretends to abhor <hi rend="italic">deceit,</hi> and which impels its votaries to <hi rend="italic">murder</hi> every man who preſumes, however juſtly, to ſuſpect them of fraud, or to queſtion their veracity, applauds the addreſs of a ſucceſsful intrigue, tho' it be well known that the ſeducer could not have obtained his end without ſwearing to the truth of a thouſand falſehoods, and calling upon God to witneſs promiſes which he never meant to fulfil.</p><p>The law of honour is indeed a very capricious rule, which accommodates itſelf to the pleaſures and conveniences of higher life; but the law of the land, which is enacted for the equal protection of high and low, may be ſuppoſed to view the guilt of ſeduction with a more impartial eye. Yet for this offence, even the laws of this kingdom have provided no other puniſhment than a pecuniary ſatisfaction to the injured family 5 which, in England, can be obtained only by one ol the quainteſt fictions in the world, by the father’s bringing his action againſt the ſeducer for the loſs of his daughter’s ſervice during her pregnancy and nurturing. See Paley’s <hi rend="italic">Moral Philoſophy,</hi> Book III. Part iii. Chap. 3.</p><p>The moraliſt, however, who eſtimates the merit or demerit of actions, not by laws of human appointment, but by their general conſequences as eſtablrſhed by the laws of nature, muſt conſider the ſeducer as a criminal<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0249.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0243"/>
of the deepeſt guilt, In every civilized country, and in many countries where civilization has made but ſmall progreſs, the virtue of women is collected as it were into a ſingle point, which they are to guard above all things, as that on which their happineſs and reputation wholly depend. At firſt ſight this may appear a capricious regulation; but a moment’s reflection will convince us of the contrary. In the married ſtate ſo much confidence is neceſſarily repoſed in the fidelity of women to the beds of their huſbands, and evils ſo great reſult from the violation or that fidelity, that whatever contributes in any degree to its preſervation, muſt be agreeable to him who, in eſtabliſhing the laws of nature, intended them to be ſubſervient to the real happineſs of all his creatures. But nothing contributes ſo much to preſerve the fidelity of wives to their huſbands, as the impreſſing upon the minds of women the higheſt veneration for the virtue of chaſtity. She who, when unmarried, has been accuſtomed to grant favours to different men, will not find it eaſy, if indeed poſſible, to reſiſt afterwards the allurements of variety. It is therefore a wiſe inſtitution, and agreeable to the will of Him who made us, to train up women ſo as that they may look upon the loſs of their chaſtity as the moſt diſgraceful of all crimes; as that which ſinks them in the order of ſociety, and robs them of all their value. In this light virtuous women actually look upon the loſs of chaſtity. The importance of that virtue has been ſo deeply impreſſed upon their minds, and is ſo cloſely aſſociated with the principle of honour, that they cannot think but with abhorrence upon the very deed by which it is loſt. He therefore who by fraud and falſehood perſuades the unſuſpecting girl to deviate in one inſtance from the honour of the ſex, weakens in a great degree her moral principle; and if he reconcile her to a repetition of her crime, he deſtroys that principle entirely, as ſhe has been taught to conſider all other virtues as inferior to that of chaſtity. Hence it is that the hearts of proſtitutes are generally ſteeled againſt the miſeries of their fellow-creatures; that they lend their aid to the ſeducer in his practices upon other gills; that they lie and ſwear and ſteal without compunction; and that too many of them heſitate not to commit murder if it can ſerve any ſelfiſh purpoſe of their own.</p><p>The loſs of virtue, though the greateſt that man or woman can ſuſtain, is not the only injury which the ſeducer brings upon the girl whom he deceives. She cannot at once reconcile herſelf to proſtitution, or even to the loſs of character; and while a sense of ſhame remains in her mind, the miſery which ſhe suffers muſt be exquiſite. She knows that ſhe has forfeited what in the female character is moſt valued by both ſexes; and ſhe muſt be under the perpetual dread of a diſcovery. She cannot even confide in the honour of her ſeducer, who may reveal her ſecret in a fit of drunkenneſs, and thus rob her of her fame as well as of her virtue; and while ſhe is in this ſtate of anxious uncertainty, the agony of her mind muſt be inſupportable. That it is ſo in fact, the many inſtances of child murder by unmarried women of every rank leave us no room to doubt. The affection of a mother to her new-born child is one of the moſt unequivocal and ſtrongeſt inſtincts in human nature (ſee <hi rend="smallcaps">Instinct)</hi>; and nothing ſhort of the extremity of diſtreſs could prompt any one ſo far to oppoſe her nature as to embrue her hands in the blood of her imploring infant.</p><p>Even this deed of horror ſeldom prevents a detection of the mother’s frailty, which is indeed commonly diſcovered, though no child has been the conſequence of her intrigue. He who can ſeduce is baſe enough to betray; and no woman can part with her honour, and retain any well-grounded hope that her amour ſhall be kept ſecret. The villain to whom she ſurrendered will glory in his victory, if it was with difficulty obtained; and if ſhe ſurrendered at diſcretion, her own behaviour will reveal her ſecret. Her reputation is then irretrievably loſt, and no future circumſpection will be of the ſmalleſt avail to recover it. She will be shunned by the virtuous part of her own ſex, and treated as a mere instrument of pleaſure by the other. In ſuch circumſtances ſhe cannot expect to be married with advantage. She may perhaps be able to captivate the heart of a heedleſs youth, and prevail upon him to unite his fate to her’s before the delirium of his paſſion ſhall give him time for reflection; ſhe may be addreſſed by a man who is a ſtranger to her ſtory, and married while he has no ſuſpicion of her ſecret; or ſhe may be ſolicited by one of a ſtation inferior to her own, who, though acquainted with every thing that has befallen her, can barter the delicacy of wedded love for ſome pecuniary advantage; but from none of theſe marriages can ſhe look for happineſs. The delirium which prompted the firſt will ſoon vaniſh, and leave the huſband to the bitterneſs of his own reflections, which can hardly fail to produce cruelty to the wife. Of the ſecret, to which, in the ſecond caſe, the lover was a ſtranger, the huſband will ſoon make a diſcovery, or at leaſt find room for harbouring ſtrong ſuſpicions; and ſuſpicions of having been deceived in a point ſo delicate have hitherto been uniformly the parents of miſery. In the third caſe, the man married her merely for money, or which having got the poſſeſſion, he has no farther inducement to treat her with reſpect. Such are ſome of the consequences of ſeduction, even when the perſon ſeduced has the good fortune to get afterwards a huſband; but this is a fortune which few in her circumſtances can reaſonably expect. By far the greater part of thoſe who have been defrauded of their virtue by the arts of the ſeducer ſink deeper and deeper into guilt, till they become at laſt common proſtitutes. The public is then deprived of their ſervice as wives and parents; and inſtead of contributing to the population of the ſtate, and to the ſurn. of domeſtic felicity, theſe outcaſts of ſociety become ſeducers in their turn, corrupting the morals of every young man whoſe appetites they can inflame, and of every young woman whom they can entice to their own practices.</p><p>All this complication of evil is produced at firſt by arts, which, if employed to deprive a man of his property, would ſubject the offender to the execration of his fellow subjects, and to an ignominious death: but while the forger of a bill is purſued with relentleſs rigour by the miniſters of juſtice, and the ſwindler loaded with univerſal reproach, the man who by fraud and forgery has enticed an innocent girl to gratify his deſires at the expence of her virtue, and thus introduced her into a path which muſt infallibly lead to her own ruin, as well as to repeated injuries to the public at<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0250.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0244"/>
large, is not deſpiſed by his own ſex, and is too often careſſed even by the virtuous part of the other. Yet the loſs of property may be eaſily repaired; the loſs of honour is irreparable! It is vain to plead in alleviation of this guilt, that women ſhould be on their guard againſt the arts of the ſeducer. Moſt unqueſtionably they ſhould; but arts have been uſed which hardly any degree of caution would have been ſufficient to counteract. It may as well be ſaid that the trader ſhould be on his guard againſt the arts of the forger, and accept of no bill without previouſly conſulting him in whoſe name it is written. Caſes, indeed, occur in trade, in which this caution would be impoſſible; but he muſt be little acquainted with the workings of the human heart, who does not know that ſituations like- wiſe occur in life, in which it is equally impoſſible for a girl of virtue and tenderneſs to reſiſt the arts of the man who has completly gained her affections.</p><p>The mentioning of this circumſtance leads us to conſider another ſpecies of ſeduction, which, though not ſo highly criminal as the former, is yet far removed from innocence; we mean the practice which is too prevalent among young men of fortune of employing every art in their power to gain the hearts of heedleſs girls whom they reſolve neither to marry nor to rob of their honour. Should a man adhere to the latter part of this reſolution, which is more than common fortitude can always promiſe for itſelf, the injury which he does to the object of his amuſement is yet very great, as he raiſes hopes of the moſt ſanguine kind merely to diſappoint them, and diverts her affections perhaps for ever from ſuch men as, had they been fixed on one of them, might have rendered her completely happy. Diſappointments of this kind have ſometimes been fatal to the unhappy girl; and even when they have neither deprived her of life, nor diſordered her reaſon, they have often kept her wholly from marriage, which, whatever it be to a man, is that from which every woman expects her chief happineſs. We cannot therefore conclude this article more properly than with warning our female readers not to give up their hearts haſtily to men whoſe ſtation in life is much higher than their own; and we beg leave to aſſure every one of them, that the man who ſolicits the laſt favour under the moſt ſolemn promiſe of a ſubſequent marriage, is a baſe ſeducer, who prefers a momentary gratification of his own to her honour and happineſs through life, and has no intention to fulfil his promiſe. Or, if he ſhould by any means be compelled to fulfil it, ſhe may depend upon much ill treatment in return for her premature compliance with his baſe deſires.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
