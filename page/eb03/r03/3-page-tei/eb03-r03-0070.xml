But in general, unleſs where the law has expreſsly declared her exempted, ſhe is upon the ſame footing with other ſub-jects ; being to all intents and purpoſes the king’s ſubject, and not his equal ; in like manner as in the imperial law, <hi rend="italic">Augujlus legibus ſolutus non eβ.</hi></p><p>The queen hath alſo ſome pecuniary advantages, which form her a diſtinct revenue : as, in the firſt place, ſhe is intitled to an ancient perquiſite called <hi rend="italic">queen-gold, </hi>or <hi rend="italic">aurum regime ;</hi>  which is a ιoyal revenue belonging to every queen-conſort during her marriage with the king, and due from every perſon wſho hath made a voluntary offering or fine to the king, amounting to 10 merks or upwards, for and in conſideration of any privileges, grants, licences, pardons, or other matter of royal favour conferred upon him by the king : and it is due in the proportion to one-tenth part more, over and above the entire offering or fine made to the king, and becomes an actual debt of record to the queen’s majeſty by the mere recording of the fine. As, if rco merks of ſilver be given to the king for liberty to take in mortmain, or to have a fair, market, park, chaſe, or free-warren ; there the queen is intitled to io merks in ſilver, or (what was formerly an equivalent denomination) to one merk in gold, by the name of <hi rend="italic">queen-gold,</hi>  or <hi rend="italic">aurum regin'æ.</hi>  But no ſuch payment is due for any aids or ſubſidies granted to the king in parliament or convocation ; or for fines impoſed by courts on offenders againſt their will ; nor for voluntary preſents to the king, without any conſideration moving from him to the ſubject ; nor for any ſale or contract whereby the preſent revenues or poſſeſſions of the crown are granted away or diminiſhed.</p><p>The original revenue of our ancient queens, before and ſoon after the conqueſt, ſeems to have conſiſted in certain reſervations or rents out of the demeſne lands of the crown, which were expreſsly appropriated to her majeſty, diſtinct from the king. It is frequent in domeſday book, after ſpecifying the rent due to the crown, to add likewiſe the quantity of gold or other Tenders reſerved to the queen. Theſe were frequently appropriated to particular purpoſes ; to buy wood for her majeſty’s uſe, fo purchaſe oil for lamps, or to fur-niſh her attire from head to foot, which was frequently very coſtly, as one ſingle robe in the fiſth year of Henry II. ſtood the city of London in upwards of 8o pounds : A practice ſomewhat ſimilar to that of the eaſtern countries, where whole cities and provinces were ſpecifically aſſigned to purchaſe particular parts of the queen’s apparel. And for a farther addition to her income, this duty of queen-gold is ſuppoſed to have been originally granted ; thoſe matters of grace and favour, out of which it aroſe, being frequently obtained from the crown by the powerful interceſſion of the queen. There are traces of its payment, though obſcure ones, in the book of domeſday, and in the great pipe-roll of Henry I. In the reign of Henry II. the manner of collecting it appears to have been well underſtood ; and it forms a diſtinct head in the ancient dialogue of the exchequer written in the time of that prince, and uſually attributed to Gervaſe of Tilbury. From that time downwards, it was regularly claimed and enjoyed by all the queen-conſorts of England till the death of Henry VIII. ; though after the acceſſion of the Tudor family, the collecting of it ſeems to have been much neglected : and there being no queen confort afterwards till the acceſſion of James 1. a period of near 6o years, its very nature and quantity then became a matter of doubt ; and being referred by the king to the chief juſtices and chief baron, their report of it was ſo very unfavourable, that his confort queen Anne, though ſhe claimed it, yet never thought proper to exact it. In <hi rend="italic">ιf&gt;3ζ&gt;</hi><hi rend="sup">11</hi>  ^-ar. I. a time fertile of expedients for railing money upon dormant precedents in our old records (of which ſhip-money was a fatal inſtance), the king, at the petition of his queen Henrietta Maria, iffued out his writ for levying it ; but afterwards purchaſed it of his confort at the price of 10,000 pounds ; finding it, perhaps, too trifling and troubleſome to levy. And when afterwards, at the Reſtoration, by the abolition of military tenures, and the fines that were conſequent upon them, the little that legally remained of this revenue was reduced to almoſt nothing at all ; in vain did Mr Prynne, by a treatiſe that does honour to his abilities as a painful and judicious antiquarian, endeavour to excite queen Catherine to revive this antiquated claim.</p><p>Another ancient perquiſite belonging to the queen confort, mentioned by all our old writers, and therefore only worthy notice, is this : that on the taking a whale on the coaſts, which is a royal fiſh, it ſhall be divided between the king and queen ; the head only being the king’s property, and the tail of it the queen’s. <hi rend="italic">De flurgione obſervetur, quod rex ilium babebit integrum : de balena vero ſujſidt, fi rex habeat caput, et regina cau-dam.</hi>  The reaſon of this whimſical diviſion, as aſſigned by our ancient records, was, to furniſh the queen’s wardrobe with whale-bone.</p><p>But farther: though the queen is in all.reſpects a ſubject, yet,· in point of the ſecurity ef her life and perſon, ſhe is put upon the ſame footing with the king. It is equally treaſon (by the ſtatute 25 Edward III.) to imagine or compaſs the death of our lady the king’s companion, as of the king himſelf ; and to violate or defile the queen confort, amounts to the ſame high crime ; as well in the perſon committing the fact, as in the queen herſelf if conſenting. A law of Henry VIII. made it treaſon alſo for any woman who was not a virgin, to marry the king without informing him thereof: but this law was ſoon after repealed ; it treſpaſſing too ſtrongly, as well on natural juſtice as female modeſty. If however the queen be accuſed of any ſpecies of treaſon, ſhe ſhall (whether confort or dowager) be tried by the peers of parliament, as queen Ann Boleyn was in 28 Hen. VIII.</p><p>The huſhand of a queen regnant, as prince George of Denmark was to queen Anne, is her ſubject ; and may be guilty of high treaſon againſt her : but, in the inſtance of conjugal fidelity, he is not ſubjected to the ſame penal reſtrictions. For which the reaſon ſeems to be, that if a queen confort is unfaithful to the royal bed, this may debaſe or baſtardize the heirs to the crown ; but no ſuch danger can be conſequent on the infidelity of the huſhand to a queen regnant.</p><p>2. A queen <hi rend="italic">dowager</hi>  is the widow of the king, and as ſuch enjoys moſt of the privileges belonging to her as queen confort. But it is not high treaſon to con-ſpire her death, or to violate her chaſtity ; for the ſame reaſon as was before alleged, becauſe the ſucceſſion to the crown is not thereby endangered.
