in <hi rend="italic">Anatomy,</hi> the dried bones of any animal joined together by wires, or by the natural ligament dried, in such a manner as to show their position when the creature was alive.</p><p>In the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions</hi> we have an account of a human skeleton, all the bones of which were so united as to make but one articulation from the back to the os sacrum, and downwards a little way. On sawing some of them where they were unnaturally joined, they were found not to cohere throughout their whole substance, but only about a sixth of an inch deep all round. The figure of the trunk was crooked, the spins making the convex, and the inside of the vertebr√¶ the concave part of the segment. The whole had been found in a charnel-house, and was of the size of a full-grown person.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
