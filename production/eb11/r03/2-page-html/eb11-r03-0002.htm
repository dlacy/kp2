All the names entered in Chinese&nbsp;calligraphy. This map obtained immense favour, and was&nbsp;immediately engraved at the expense of the viceroy and&nbsp;widely circulated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the accompanying cut we have endeavoured to portray this map. The projection adopted is a perspective of the hemisphere&nbsp;as viewed from a&nbsp;point at the distance&nbsp;of one diameter from&nbsp;the surface, and situated on the production of the radius&nbsp;which passes through&nbsp;the intersection of&nbsp;115° E. long. (Greenwich) with 30° N. lat.&nbsp;Something' near this&nbsp;must have been Li-ma-teu’s projection.&nbsp;With a vertex much&nbsp;more distant the desired effect would be&nbsp;impaired, and with&nbsp;one nearer neither&nbsp;of the poles would be seen, whilst the exaggeration of China&nbsp;would have been too gross for a professed representation of the&nbsp;hemisphere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The chief facts of Ricci’s career are derived from Trigault; some contemporary works on the rites controversy have also&nbsp;been consulted; in the notice of Ricci’s Chinese writings&nbsp;valuable matter has been derived from </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Notes on Chinese Literature&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">by A. Wylie (London and Shanghai, 1867). A number of&nbsp;Ricci’s letters are extant in the possession of the family, and access&nbsp;to them was afforded to Giuseppe La Farina, author of the work&nbsp;caUed </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">La China, Considerata nella sua Storia,</span><span class="font1"> &amp;c.

Settling in&nbsp;Rome, he received abundant encouragement. His constant&nbsp;friend, Michelangelo, recommended him on all possible occasions,&nbsp;and he was commissioned to beautify with works of art a chapel&nbsp;in the church of the Trinita, to paint in the Farnese Palace, to&nbsp;execute certain decorations in the Palazzo de’ Medici at Navona,&nbsp;and to begin the stucco work and the pictures in the Hall of the&nbsp;Kings. Towards the close of his life he turned his attention to&nbsp;statuary. His last work was a bronze horse intended for an&nbsp;equestrian statue of Henry II. of France. He died in 1566. The&nbsp;principal extant works of Ricciarelli are at Rome, These are a&nbsp;“ St John the Baptist ” in the picture gallery of the Capitol,&nbsp;a “ Saviour bearing the Cross ” in the Palazzo Rospigliosi, and a&nbsp;“ Descent from the Cross,” his masterpiece, in the church of&nbsp;Trinita de Monti. There is also an “ Elijah ” at Volterra.</span></p>

Besides the works named, she wrote a novel (1762) on the subject of Fielding’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Amelia,</span><span class="font1"> and supplied in 1765 a&nbsp;continuation (but not the conclusion sometimes erroneously&nbsp;ascribed to her) of Marivaux’s unfinished </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Marianne.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">All Madame Rieeobon's work is clever, and there is real pathos in it. But it is among the most eminent examples of the “sensibility ” novel, of which no examples but Sterne’s have kept their&nbsp;place in England, and that not in virtue of their sensibility. A still&nbsp;nearer parallel may be found in the work of Mackenzie. Madame&nbsp;Riccoboni is an especial offender in the use of mechanical aids to&nbsp;impressiveness—italics, dashes, rows of points and the like. The&nbsp;principal edition of her complete works is that of Paris (6 vols.,&nbsp;m8i8). The chief novels appear in a volume of Garnier’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bibliothèque amusante</span><span class="font1"> (Paris, 1865).</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RICE, EDMUND IGNATIUS (1762-1844), Irish philanthropist, founder of the “ Irish Christian Brothers,” was born at Westcourt, near Callen, Kilkenny, on the ist of June 1762.&nbsp;He entered the business of his uncle, an export provision merchant&nbsp;in Waterford, in 1779 and succeeded him in 1790. In 1796 he&nbsp;established an organization for visiting and relieving the poor,&nbsp;and in 1802 began to educate the poor children of Waterford,&nbsp;renting a school and supporting two teachers. In 1803 he gave&nbsp;up his business and, joined by a number of friends, began to&nbsp;systematize his plans. Others, like-minded, opened schools&nbsp;at Dungarvan and Carrick-on-Suir. The little society numbered&nbsp;nine in 1808, and meeting at Waterford took religious vows&nbsp;from their bishop,· assumed a “ habit ” and adopted an additional Christian name, by which, as by the collective title&nbsp;“ Christian Brothers,” they were thenceforth known. Schools&nbsp;were established in Cork (1811), Dublin (1812), and Thurles&nbsp;and Limerick (1817). In 1820 Pope Pius VII. issued a brief&nbsp;sanctioning the order of “ Religious Brothers of the Christian&nbsp;Schools (Ireland),” the members of which were to be bound&nbsp;by vows of obedience, chastity, poverty and perseverance, and&nbsp;to give themselves to the free instruction, religious and literary,&nbsp;of male children, especially the poor. The heads of houses were&nbsp;to elect a superior general, and Rice held this office from 1822&nbsp;to 1838, during which time the institution extended to several&nbsp;English towns (especiaUy in Lancashire), and the course of&nbsp;instruction grew out of the primary stage. Rice died on the&nbsp;‘29th of August 1844. The Irish Christian Brothers have some&nbsp;hundred houses in Ireland with 300 attached schools and over&nbsp;30,000 pupils. There are also industrial schools and orphanages,&nbsp;and the institute has branches in Australia, India, Gibraltar&nbsp;and Newfoundland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RICE, JAMES (1843-1882), English novelist, was born at Northampton on the 26th of September 1843. Educated at&nbsp;Queens’ College, Cambridge, where he graduated in law in 1867,&nbsp;he was called to the bar at Lincoln’s Inn in 1871. In the&nbsp;meantime (1868) he had bought </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Once a Week,</span><span class="font1"> which proved a&nbsp;losing venture for him, but which brought him into touch with&nbsp;Walter Besant, a contributor [see Besant’s preface to the&nbsp;Library Edition (1887) of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ready-money Mortiboy].</span><span class="font1"> There&nbsp;ensued a close friendship and a literary partnership between&nbsp;the two men which lasted ten years until Rice’s death, and&nbsp;resulted in a large number of successful novels.
