                <p><label>ROBERT GUISCARD</label> [i.e. “the resourceful”] (c. 1015-1085), the most
                    remarkable of the Norman adventurers who conquered southern Italy. From 1016 to
                    1030 the Normans were pure mercenaries, serving either Greeks or Lombards, and
                    then Sergius of Naples, by installing the leader Rainulf in the fortress of
                    Aversa in 1030, gave them their first pied-à-terre and they began an organized
                    conquest of the land. In 1030 there arrived William and Drogo, the two eldest
                    sons of Tancred of Hauteville, a petty noble of Coutanccs in Normandy. The two
                    joined in the organized attempt to wrest Apulia from the Greeks, who by 1040 had
                    lost most of that province. In 1042 Melfi was chosen as the Norman capital, and
                    in September of that year the Normans elected as their count William “Iron Arm,”
                    who was succeeded in turn by his brothers Drogo, “ comes Normannorum totius
                    Apuliae et Calabriae,” and Humfrey, who arrived about 1044. In 1046 arrived
                    Robert, the sixth son of Tancred of Hauteville. His tall stature, blonde
                    colouring and powerful voice are strikingly described by Anna Comnena.</p>
               <p>Guiscard soon rose to distinction. The Lombards turned against their allies and
                    Leo IX. determined to expel the Norman freebooters. The army which he led
                    towards Apulia in 1053 was, however, overthrown at Civitate on the Fortore by
                    the Normans united under Humfrey, Guiscard and Richard of Aversa. In 1057 Robert
                    succeeded Humfrey as count of Apulia and, in company with Roger his youngest
                    brother, carried on the conquest of Apulia and Calabria, while Richard conquered
                    the principality of Capua. The Papacy, foreseeing the breach with the emperor
                    over investitures, now resolved to recognize the Normans and secure them as
                    allies. Therefore at Melfi, on the 23rd of August 1059, Nicholas II. invested
                    Robert with Apulia, Calabria, and Sicily, and Richard with Capua. Guiscard “ by
                    Grace of God and St Peter duke of Apulia and Calabria and future lord of Sicily
                    ” agreed to hold by annual rent of the Holy See and to maintain its cause. In
                    the next twenty years he made an amazing series of conquests. Invading Sicily
                    with Roger, the brothers captured Messina (io6r) and Palermo (1072). Bari was
                    reduced (April 1071) and the Greeks finally ousted from southern Italy. The
                    territory of Salerno was already Robert’s; in December 1076 he took the city,
                    expelling its Lombard prince Gisulf, whose sister Sikelgaita he had married. The
                    Norman attacks on Benevento, a papal fief, alarmed and angered Gregory VII., but
                    pressed hard by the emperor, Henry IV., he turned again to the Normans, and at
                    Ceprano (June 1080) reinvested Robert, securing him also in the southern
                    Abruzzi, but reserving Salerno. Guiscard’s last enterprise was his attack on the
                    Greek Empire, a rallying ground for his rebel vassals. He</p>

               <p>contemplated seizing the throne of the Basileus and took up the cause of Michael
                    VII., who had been deposed in 1078 and to whose son his daughter had been
                    betrothed. He sailed with 16,000 men against the empire in May 1081, and by
                    February 1082 had occupied Corfu and Durazzo, defeating the emperor Alexis
                    before the latter (October 1081). He was, however, recalled to the aid of
                    Gregory VII., besieged in San Angelo by Henry IV. (June 1083). Marching north
                    with 36,000 men he entered Rome and forced Henry to retire, but an émeute of the
                    citizens led to a three days’ sack of the city (May 1084), after which Guiscard
                    escorted the pope to Rome. His son Bohemund, for a time master of Thessaly, had
                    now lost the Greek conquests. Robert, returning to restore them, occupied Corfu
                    and Kephalonia, but died of fever in the latter on the 15th of July 1085, in his
                    70th year. He was buried'in S. Trinità at Vcnosa. Guiscard was succeeded by
                    Roger “ Borsa,” his son by Sikelgaita; Bohemund, his son by an earlier Norman
                    wife Alberada, being set aside. At his death Robert was duke of Apulia and
                    Calabria, prince of Salerno and suzerain of Sicily. His successes had been due
                    not only to his great qualities but to the “ entente ” with the Papal See. He
                    created and enforced a strong ducal power which, however, was met by many
                    baronial revolts, one being in 1078, when he demanded from the Apulian vassals
                    an “ aid ” on the betrothal of his daughter. In conquering such wide territories
                    he had little time to organize them internally. In the history of the Norman
                    kingdom of Italy Guiscard remains essentially the hero and founder, as his
                    nephew Roger II. is the statesman and organizer.</p>
