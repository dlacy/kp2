        <p><span class="font2">their joint bended backwards. This joint, which, when the animal
                lies, is covered with a remarkable fold&nbsp;of the ſkin, appears when he ſtands.
                The tail is thin,&nbsp;and proportionally ſhort ; that of the rhinoceros ſo often
                mentioned, exceeded not 16 or 17 inches in length.&nbsp;It turns a little thicker at
                the extremity, which is garniſhed with ſome ſhort, thick, hard hairs. The
                form&nbsp;of the penis is very extraordinary. It is contained in a&nbsp;prepuce or
                ſheath like that of the horſe ; and the ſirſt&nbsp;thing that appears in the time of
                erection is a fecond&nbsp;prepuce, of a ſſeſh-colour, from which there iffues
                a&nbsp;hollow tube, in the form of a funnel cut and bordered&nbsp;fomewhat like a
                flower-de-luce, and conſtitutes tlie glans&nbsp;and extremity of the penis. This
                anomalous glans is&nbsp;of à paler ſſeſh-colour than the ſecond prepuce. Tn
                the&nbsp;moſt vigorous erection, tlie penis extends not above&nbsp;eight inches out
                of the body ; and it is eaſily procured&nbsp;by rubbing the animal witli a liandſul
                of ſtraw wlien lie&nbsp;lies at his eaſe. The direction of this organ is
                not&nbsp;ſtraiglit, but bended backward. Hence lie throws out&nbsp;his urine behind
                ; and from this circumſtance, it may be&nbsp;inferred that the male covers not the
                female, but that&nbsp;they unite with their cruppers to each other. The female
                organs are ſituated like thoſe of the cow ; and ſhe&nbsp;exactly reſembles the male
                in ſigure and groffneſs of&nbsp;body. The ſkin is ſo thick and impenetrable, that
                when&nbsp;a man lays hold of any of the folds, he would imagine&nbsp;he is touching
                a wooden plank of half an inch thick @@(b).&nbsp;when tanned, Dr Grew remarks, it is
                exceffively hard,&nbsp;and thicker than the hide of any other terreſtrial animal. It
                is everywhere covered more or leſs with in-eruſtations in the form of galls or
                tuberoſities, which are&nbsp;pretty ſmall on the top of the neck and back, but
                become larger on the ſides. The largeſt are on the ſhoul-ders and crupper, are ſtill
                pretty large on the thighs&nbsp;and legs, upon which they are ſpread all round,
                and&nbsp;even on thc feet. But between the folds thc ſkin is&nbsp;penetrable,
                delicate, and as ſoft to the touch as ſilk,&nbsp;while the external part of the fold
                is equally hard with&nbsp;the reſt. This tender ſkin between the folds is of
                a&nbsp;light fleſh-colour ; and the ſkin of the belly is nearly of&nbsp;the ſame
                colour and conſiſtence. Theſe galls or tubero-ſities ſhould not be compared, as fome
                authors have done,&nbsp;to ſcales. They are only ſtmple indurations of the
                ſkin,&nbsp;without any regularity in their ſigure or ſymmetry in&nbsp;their
                reſpective poſitions. The flexibility of the ſkin&nbsp;in the folds enables the
                rhinoceros to move with facility&nbsp;his head, neck, and members. The whole body,
                except at the joints, is inflexible, and reſembles a coat of&nbsp;mail. Dr Parſons
                remarks, that this animal liſtened&nbsp;with a deep and long continued attention to
                any&nbsp;kind of noiſe ; and that, though he was ſſeeping,</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">eating, or obeying any other preffing, demands of nature, he raifed
                his head, aud liſtened till the noiſe ceaſed.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">Theſe animals never affemble or march together in troops like
                elephants. Being of a more ſolitary and ſa-vage diſpoſition, they are more difficult
                to hunt and to&nbsp;overcome. They never attack men, however, except&nbsp;when they
                are provoked, when they are very furious&nbsp;and formidable ; but as they fee only
                before them,<sub>;</sub> and</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">not very ſharply, and as they turn with great difficulty, they may be
                eaſily avoided. The ſkin of theſe animals is&nbsp;ſo extremely hard as to reſiſt
                ſabres, lances, javelins, and&nbsp;even muſket balls, the only penetrable parts
                being the&nbsp;belly, the eyes, and about the ears. Hence the hunters&nbsp;generally
                attack them wlien they lie down to ſleep.—&nbsp;Their ſleſh is conſidered as
                excellent hy the Indians and&nbsp;Africans, but eſpecially by the Hottentots ; and
                if&nbsp;they were trained when young, they might be rendered,&nbsp;domeſtic, in
                which caſe they would multiply more eaſtly&nbsp;than the elephant. They inhabit
                Bengal, Siam, Col-chin-China, Quangſi in China, the iſles of Java and·&nbsp;Sumatra,
                Congo, Angola, Ethiopia, and the country&nbsp;as low as the Cape. They love ſhady
                foreſts, the neigh-bourhood of rivers, and marſhy places. They wallow&nbsp;in the
                mire like hogs, and are ſaid by that means to give&nbsp;ſhelter in the folds of
                their ſkins to ſcorpions, centipedes,&nbsp;and other infects. This is denied by
                Buffon and Ed-wards, though the ſurgeon of the Shafteſhury had ob-ſerved in a
                rhinoceros, newly taken after having welter-ed in the mud, ſeveral infects concealed
                under the ply&nbsp;of the ſkin. This carries with it every appearance
                of&nbsp;probability ; for as the creature welters in mud, it is&nbsp;impoffible for
                it to do ſo without bringing up with it&nbsp;ſome of the infects which live in that
                mud ; and when&nbsp;this is the caſe, it ſurely cannot be unnatural to
                ſuppoſe&nbsp;that they would ſhelter themſelves under the plaits of&nbsp;the ſkin.
                Mr Bruce had an opportunity of examining&nbsp;the ſkin of a rhinoceros before his
                muddy covering had&nbsp;been ſcraped off, and ſaw under it ſeveral very
                large&nbsp;worms, but not of the carnivorous kind. He ſaw like-wiſe ſeveral ſmaller
                animals reſembling car-wigs, which&nbsp;he took to be young fcolopendræ ; and,
                though he&nbsp;ſearched no farther, we muſt certainly conſlder this as&nbsp;a proof
                of what the ſurgeon of the Shafteſhury re-lated. Mr Bruce ſuppoſes, too, that they
                welter in&nbsp;mire, partly in order to ſereen themſelves by a caſe of&nbsp;mud from
                the attacks of that miſchievous fly which in-feſts the animals of Abyffinia to filch
                a degree. &quot; The&nbsp;time of the fly (ſays he) being in the rainy ſeaſon,
                the&nbsp;whole black earth turns into mire.- In the night, when&nbsp;the fly is at
                reſt, the rhinoceros chooſes a convenient&nbsp;place, and there, rolling himſelf in
                tlie mud, he clothes&nbsp;himſelf with a kind of caſe, which defends him
                againſt&nbsp;his enemy the following day. The wrinkles and plaits&nbsp;of his ſkin
                ſerve to keep this muddy plaſter ſirm up-on him, all but about his hips, ſhoulders,
                and legs,,&nbsp;where it cracks and falls off by motion, and leaves
                hime&nbsp;expoſed in thoſe places to the attacks of the fly. The&nbsp;itching and
                pain which follow occaſion him to rub him-ſelf in thoſe parts againſt the rougheſt
                trees ; and this&nbsp;is at leaſt one cauſe of the puſtules or tubercles
                whichi&nbsp;we ſee upon theſe places, both on the elephant and rhino-ceros.” They
                bring forth only one young at </span><span class="font1">a </span><span
                class="font2">time,,&nbsp;about which they are very ſolicitous- They are ſaid
                to&nbsp;confort with tygers ; a ſtory founded merely on their&nbsp;common attachment
                t© the ſides of rivers, by which,&nbsp;means they are often found near each other.
                Their ſkin,,&nbsp;fleſh, hoofs, teeth, and even dung, are uſed in India
                medicinally. The horn, eſpecially that of a virgin rhino-·&nbsp;ceros, is
                conſidered as an antidote againſt poiſon. Every</span></p>
