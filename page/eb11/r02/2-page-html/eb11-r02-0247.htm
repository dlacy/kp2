<p><span class="font2">was no more heard of—this being the sequel of the abduction by Don John of Austria, son of Philip IV., of the painter’s&nbsp;beautiful only daughter Maria Rosa. But these assertions&nbsp;have not availed to displace the earlier and well-authenticated&nbsp;statement that Ribera died peaceably and wealthy in Naples&nbsp;in 1656. His own signature on his pictures is constantly&nbsp;“ Jusepe de Ribera, Espafiol.” His daughter, so far from&nbsp;being disgraced by an abduction, married a Spanish nobIeman&nbsp;who became a minister of the viceroy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The pictorial· style of Spagnoletto is extremely powerful. In bis earlier style, founded (as we have seen) sometimes on&nbsp;Caravaggio and sometimes on the wholly diverse method of&nbsp;Correggio, the study of Spanish and Venetian masters can&nbsp;likewise be traced. Along with his massive and predominating&nbsp;shadows, he retained from first to last great strength of local&nbsp;colouring. His forms, though ordinary and partly gross, are&nbsp;correct; the impression of his works gloomy and startling. He&nbsp;delighted in subjects of horror. Salvator Rosa and Luca&nbsp;Giordano were his most distinguished pupils; also Giovanni Do,&nbsp;Enrico Fiammingo, Michelangelo Fracanzani, and Aniello&nbsp;Falcone, who was the first considerable painter of battle-pieces.&nbsp;Among Ribera’s principal works should be named “ St Januarius&nbsp;Emerging from the Furnace,” in the cathedral of Naples; the&nbsp;“ Descent from the Cross,” in the Neapolitan Certosa, generally&nbsp;regarded as his masterpiece; the “ Adoration of the Shepherds ”&nbsp;(a Iatc work, 1650), now in the Louvre; the “ Martyrdom of&nbsp;St Bartholomew,” in the museum of Madrid; the “ Pietà,” in&nbsp;the sacristy of S. Martino, Naples. His mythologie subjects&nbsp;are generally unpleasant—such as the “ Silenus,” in the Studj&nbsp;Gallery of Naples, and “ Venus Lamenting over Adonis,” in&nbsp;the Corsini Gallery of Rome. The Louvre contains altogether&nbsp;twenty-five of his paintings; the National Gallery, London,&nbsp;two—one of them, a “ Peità,” being an excellent though not&nbsp;exactly a leading specimen. He executed several fine male&nbsp;portraits; among others his own likeness, now in the collection&nbsp;at Alton Towers. He also produced twenty-six etchings, ably&nbsp;treated. For the use of his pupils, he drew a number of elementary designs, which in 1650 were etched by Francisco&nbsp;Fernandez, and which continued much in vogue for a long&nbsp;while among Spanish and French painters and students.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RIBOT<sub>1</sub> ALEXANDRE FÉLIX JOSEPH (1842- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;), French</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">statesman, was born at St Omer on 7th February 1842. After a brilliant career at the university of Paris, where he was&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">lauréat</span><span class="font2"> of the faculty of law, he rapidly made his mark at the&nbsp;bar. He was secretary of the conference of advocates and one&nbsp;of the founders of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Société de législation comparée.</span><span class="font2"> During&nbsp;1875 and 1876 he was successively director of criminal affairs&nbsp;and secretary-general at the ministry of justice. In 1877 he&nbsp;made his entry into political life by the conspicuous part he&nbsp;played on the committee of legal resistance during the Broglie&nbsp;ministry, and in the following year he was returned to the&nbsp;chamber as a moderate republican member for Boulogne, in&nbsp;his native department of Pas-de-Calais. His impassioned yet&nbsp;reasoned eloquence gave him an influence which was increased&nbsp;by his articles in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Parlement</span><span class="font2"> in which he opposed violent&nbsp;measures against the unauthorized congregations. He devoted&nbsp;himself especially to financial questions, and in 1882 was&nbsp;reporter of the budget. He became one of the most prominent&nbsp;republican opponents of the Radical party, distinguishing&nbsp;himself by his attacks on the short-lived Gambetta ministry.&nbsp;He refused to vote the credits demanded by the Ferry cabinet&nbsp;for the Tongking expedition, and shared with M. Clémenceau&nbsp;in the overthrow of the ministry in 1885. At the general&nbsp;election of that year he was one of the victims of the Republican&nbsp;rout in the Pas-de-Calais, and did not re-enter the chamber&nbsp;till 1887. After 1889 he sat for St Omer. His fear of the&nbsp;Boulangist movement converted him to the policy of “ Republican Concentration,” and he entered office in 1890 as&nbsp;foreign minister in the Freycinet cabinet. He had an intimate&nbsp;acquaintance and sympathy with English institutions, and two&nbsp;of his published works—an address, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Biographie de Lord Erskine&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">(1866), and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Élude sur Facte du $ avril 1873 pour F établissement&nbsp;.d'une cour suprême de justice en Angleterre</span><span class="font2"> (1874)—deal with&nbsp;English questions; he also gave a fresh and highly important&nbsp;direction to French policy by the understanding with Russia,&nbsp;which was declared to· the world by the visit of the French&nbsp;fleet to Cronstadt in 1891, and which subsequently ripened&nbsp;into a formal treaty of alliance. He retained bis post in the&nbsp;Loubet ministry (February-November 1892), and on its defeat·&nbsp;became himself president of the council, retaining the direction&nbsp;of foreign affairs. The government resigned in March 1893 on&nbsp;the refusal of the chamber to accept the Senate’s amendments’&nbsp;to the budget. On the election of Félix Faure as president of&nbsp;the Republic in January 1895, M. Ribot again became premier-and minister of finance. On the 10th of June he was able to&nbsp;make the first official announcement of a definite alliance with&nbsp;Russia. On the 30th of October the government was defeated&nbsp;on the question of the Chemin de fer du Sud, and resigned&nbsp;office. The real reason of its fall was the mismanagement of&nbsp;the Madagascar expedition, the .cost of which in men and&nbsp;money exceeded all expectations, and the alarming social&nbsp;conditions at home, as indicated by- the strike at Carmaux.&nbsp;After the fall of the Méline ministry in 1898 M. Ribot tried in&nbsp;vain to form a cabinet of “ conciliation.” He was elected, at&nbsp;the end of 1898, president of the important commission on&nbsp;education, in which he advocated the adoption of a modern&nbsp;system of education. The policy of the Waldeck-Rousscau&nbsp;ministry on the religious teaching congregations broke up the&nbsp;Republican party, and M. Ribot was among the scceders;&nbsp;but at the general election of 1902, though he himself secured&nbsp;re-election, his policy suffered a severe check. He actively&nbsp;opposed the policy of the Combes ministry and denounced the&nbsp;alliance with M. Jaurès, and on the 13th of January 1905 he&nbsp;was one of the leaders of the opposition which brought about&nbsp;the fall of the cabinet. Although he had been most violent&nbsp;;in denouncing the anti-clerical policy of the Combes cabinet,&nbsp;he now announced his willingness to· recognize a new régime to&nbsp;replace the Concordat, and gave the government his support&nbsp;in the establishment of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Associations Cultuedes</span><span class="font2">, while he&nbsp;secured some mitigation of the severities attending the separation. He was re-elected deputy for St Omer in 1906. In the&nbsp;same year he became a member of the French Academy in&nbsp;succession to the duc d'Audiffret-Pasquier; he was already a&nbsp;member of the Academy of Moral and Political Science. In&nbsp;justification of his policy in opposition he published in 190$&nbsp;two volumes of his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Discours politiques.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RIBOT, THÉODULE (1823-1891), French painter, was bom at Breteuil, in Eure, in 1823, and died at Bois ColomBes, near&nbsp;Paris, in September 1891. A pupil nominally of Glaize, but&nbsp;more really of Ribera, of the great Flemings .and of Chardin,&nbsp;Théodule Ribot had yet conspicuously his own noble and&nbsp;personal vision, his own intensity of feeling and rich sobriety&nbsp;of performance. Beginning to work seriously at art when&nbsp;he was no longer extremely young, and dying before he was&nbsp;extremely oId, Ribot crowded into some thirty or thirty-five&nbsp;years of active practice very varied achievements; and he&nbsp;worked in at least three mediums, oil paint, pencil or crayon&nbsp;draughtsmanship and the needle of the etcher. His drawings&nbsp;were sometimes “ complete in themselves,” and sometimes&nbsp;fragmentary but powerful preparations for painted canvases.&nbsp;The etchings, of which there are only about a couple of dozen,&nbsp;are of the middle period of his practice; they show a diversity&nbsp;of method as well as of theme; the work in the w'ell-nigh&nbsp;Velazquez-Iike “ Prière ”—a group of girl children—contrasting strongly with that process almost of outline alone, w'hich&nbsp;he employed in the brilliant little group of prints which record&nbsp;his vision of the character and humours of cooks and kitchen-boys. In etching, the method varied with the theme—not&nbsp;with the period. It is quite otherwise W’ith the paintings.&nbsp;Here the earlier work, irrespective of its subject, is the drier</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
