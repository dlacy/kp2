The governments of provinces, and all public honours, were bellowed upon ſuch as were remarkable for their attachment to Pompey and their enmity to Cæſar. The latter, however, was by no means wanting in what concerned his own intereſt. Three of the tribunes who had been his friends were driven out of Rome, and arrived in his camp diſguiſed like Haves. Cæſar ſhowed them to his army in this ignominious habit ; and, ſetting forth the iniquity of the ſenate and patricians, exhorted his men to ſtand by their general under whom they had ſerved ſo long with ſucceſs ; and finding by their acclamations that he could depend on them, he reſolved to begin hoſtilities immediately.</p><p>The firſt deſign of Cæſar was to make himſelf maſter of Ariminum, a city bordering upon Ciſalpine Gaul, and conſequently a part of his province ; but as this would be looked upon as a declaration of war, he reſolved to keep his deſign as private as poſſible. At that time he himſelf was at Ravenna, from whence he ſent a detachment towards the Rubicon, deſiring the officer who commanded it to wait for him on the banks of that river. The next day he aſſiſted at a ſhow of gladiators, and made a great entertainment. Towards the cloſe of the day he roſe from table, deſiring his gueſts to ſtay till he came back, which he ſaid would be very ſoon ; but, inſtead of returning to the company, he immediately ſet out for the Rubicon, having left orders to ſome of his moſt intimate friends to follow him through different roads, to avoid being obſerved. Having arrived at the Rubicon, which parted Ciſalpine Gaul from Italy, the ſucceeding misfortunes of the empire occurred to his mind, and made him heſitate. Turning then to Aſinius Pollio, “ If I do not croſs the river (ſaid he),</p><p>I am undone ; and if I do croſs it, how many calamities ſhall I by this means bring upon Rome !” Having thus ſpoken, he muſed a few minutes ; and then crying out, ** The die is caſt,” he threw himſelf into the river, and croſſing it, marched with all poſſible ſpeed to Ariminum, which he reached and ſurpriſed before daybreak- From thence, as he had but one legion with him, he diſpatched orders to the formidable army he had left in Gaul to croſs the mountains and join him.</p><p>The activity of Cæſar ſtruck the oppoſite party with the greateſt terror ; and indeed not without reaſon, for they had been extremely negligent in making preparations againſt ſuch a formidable opponent. Pompey himſelf, no leſs alarmed than the reſt, left Rome with a deſicrn to retire to Capua, where he had two legions whom he had formerly draughted out of Cæſar’s army. He communicated his intended flight to the ſenate ; but at the ſame time acquainted them, that if any magiſtrate or ſenator refuſed to follow him, he ſhould be treated as a friend to Cæſar and an enemy to his country. In the mean time Cæſar, having raiſed new troops in Ciſalpine Gaul, ſent Marc Antony with a detachment to ſeize Aretium, and ſome other officers to ſecure Piſaurum and Fanum, while he himſelf marched at the head of the thirteenth legion to Auximum, which opened its gates to him. From Auximum he advanced into Pi-cenum, where he was joined by the twelfth legion ſrom Tranſalpine Gaul. As Picenum readily ſubmitted to him, he led his forces againſt Corfinium, the capital of the Peligni, which Domitus Ahenobarbus defended with thirty cohorts. But Cæſar no ſooner inveſted it, than the garriſon betrayed their commander, and delivered him up with many ſenators, who had taken refuge in the place, to Cæſar, who granted them their lives and liberty. Domitius, fearing the reſentment of the cortqueror, had ordered one of his ſlaves, whom he uſed as a phyſician, to give him a doſe of poiſon. When he came to experience the humanity of the conqueror, he lamented his misfortune, and blamed the haſtineſs of his own reſolution. But his phyſician, who had only given him a ſleeping draught, comforted him, and received his liberty as a reward for his affection.</p><p>Pompey, thinking himſelf no longer ſafe at Capua after the reduction of Corfinium, retired to Brundu-ſium, with a deſign to carry the war into the eaſt, where all the governors were his creatures. Cæſar followed him cloſe ; and arriving with his army before Brunduſium, inveſted the place on the land-ſide, and undertook to ſhut up the port by a ſtaccado of his own invention. But, before the work was completed, the fleet which had conveyed the two conſuls with thirty cohorts to Dyrrhachium being returned, Pompey reſolved to make liis eſcape, which he conducted with all the experience and dexterity of a great officer. He kept his departure very ſecret ; but, at the ſame time, made all neceſſary preparations for the facilitating of it. In the firſt place, he walled up the gates, then dug deep and wide ditches croſs all the ſtreets, except only thoſe two that led to the port ; in the ditches he planted iharp pointed ſtakes, covering them with hurdles and earth. After theſe precautions, he gave expreſs orders that all the citizens ſhould keep within doors, leſt they ſhould betray his deſign to the enemy ; and then, in the ſpace of three days, embarked all his troops, except the light-armed infantry, whom he had placed on the walls ; and theſe likewiſe, on a ſignal given, abandoning their poſts, repaired with great expedition to the ſhips. Cæſar, perceiving the walls unguarded, ordered his men to ſcale them, and make what haſte they could after the enemy. In the heat of the purſuit, they would have fallen into the ditches which Pompey had prepared for them, had not the Brunduſians warned them of the danger, and, by many windings and turnings, led them to the haven, where they ſound all the fleet under ſail, except two veſſels, which had run aground in going out of the harbour. Theſe Cæſar took, made the ſoldiers on board priſoners, and brought them aſhore.</p><p>Cæſar, ſeeing himſelf, by the flight of his rival, mat ter of all Italy from the Alps to the ſea, was deſirous to follow and attack him before he was joined by the ſupplies which he expected from Aſia. But being deſtitute of ſhipping, he reſolved to. go firſt to Rome, and ſettle ſome ſort of government there ; and then paſs in-to Spain, to drive from thence Pompey’s troops, who had taken poſſeſſion of that great continent, Under the command of Afranius and Petreius. Before he left Brunduſium, he ſent Scribonius Curio with three legions into Sicily, and ordered Q<hi rend="smallcaps"><hi rend="sub">λ</hi></hi>  Valerius, one of his lieutenants, to get together what ſhips he could, and croſs over with one legion into Sardinia. Cato, who commanded in Sicily, upon the firſt news of Curio’s landing there, abandoned the iſland, and retired to the camp of the conſuls at Dyrrhachium ; and Valerius no ſooner appeared with his ſmall fleet off Sardinia,</p><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
