Since 1870 the cathedral has been restored, a handsome marketplace with offices for the municipality erected, the barracks rebuilt and fortified, and several of the streets macadamized. San José is the seat of the national bank (founded in 1873) and of a university, to which a medical school and a museum are attached. The population is estimated at from 20,000 to 25,000. As a city it dates from the latter half of the 18th century ; it became the capital after the destruction of Cartago by earthquake in 1841.</p><p>SAN JOSÉ, a city of the United States, capital of Santa Clara county, California, lies 40 miles south-east of San Francisco and 8 miles from the southern end of San Francisco Bay, in the heart of the beautiful Santa Clara Valley. It is at this point that the railways from the two sides of the bay meet. The main part of the city occupies a gently rising plateau between the Coyote and Guadalupe rivers. Among the principal buildings are a fine courthouse, a theatre, a city-hall, two markets, a music-hall, the State normal school, the Methodist “ university of the Pacific,” and a number of large colleges and schools. Besides three public parks in the city San José possesses a tract of 400 acres in Penitencia Canon, 7 miles east, reserved for a similar purpose. The Lick Observatory (founded in 1884 on the top of Mount Hamilton) is 12 miles distant, and the Almaden quicksilver mines about 14 miles. The population of the city was 9089 in 1870, and 12,567 (township 18,103) in 1880.</p><p>Founded by the Spanish missionaries in 1777, San José remained a small village of adobe huts till the annexation of the country to the United States. The first session of the legislature of California was held in the town in 1849-50.</p><p>SAN JUAN BAUTISTA. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Porto Rico.</hi></p><p>SAN JUAN DE LA FRONTERA, the capital of a province of the Argentine Republic, is situated 2310 feet above the sea in a great bend of the Rio de San Juan, 95 miles north of Mendoza and 730 miles from Buenos Ayres, with which it is about to be connected by rail (1886). It is mostly built of sun-dried bricks, has a cathedral, several churches and schools, two banks, and a botanical garden, and carries on a considerable trade with Chili by the Patos and Uspallata passes. Population estimated at 20,000 (1881).</p><p>San Juan was founded in 1561 by Captain Castillo on a site 4 miles to the north, which had to be abandoned owing to inundations and is now called Pueblo Viejo. From 1776 to 1820 the city was in the government of Mendoza. President Sarmiento bestowed special attention on this his native town and gave his name to its principal school, famous throughout the republic for its excellent equipment.</p><p>SAN JUAN DEL NORTE. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Greytown.</hi></p><p>SAN JUAN (or HARO) ISLANDS, an archipelago (San Juan, Orcas, Shaw, Lopez, Blakely, Cypress, &amp;c.) lying between Vancouver Island and the mainland of North America, which were for many years the subject of dispute between the British and the United States Governments, and were finally assigned to the latter country by the arbitration of the emperor of Germany (21st October 1872). Geographically the cluster certainly belongs to the mainland, from which it is separated by Rosario Channel, generally much under 50 fathoms in depth, while Haro Strait, separating it from Vancouver Island, has depths ranging from 100 to 190 fathoms. In 1873 the islands, formerly considered part of Whatcom county, Washington Territory, were made the separate county of San Juan. Of the total area of 200 square miles, about 60 are in San</p><p>Juan, 60 in Orcas, and 30 in Lopez. The population was 554 in 1870 and 948 in 1880.</p><p>See <hi rend="italic">Papers relating to the Treaty of Washington,</hi> vol. v., 1872, and the map in Petermann’s <hi rend="italic">Mittheilungen,</hi> 1873.</p><p>SANKT JOHANN. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Saarbrücken.</hi></p><p>SANKT PÖLTEN, a small town, and the seat of a bishop, in Lower Austria, is situated on the Treisen, a tributary of the Danube, 61 miles west of Vienna by rail. It contains an interesting old abbey church, founded in 1030 and restored in 1266 and again at the beginning of the 18th century. There are several religious educational institutions in the town, and a military academy for engineers. The inhabitants, 10,015 in number, carry on some trade, and the manufacture of iron wire, paper, weapons, &amp;c. The name is said to be a corruption of Traisma ad S. Hippolytum, from a convent that formerly stood here. The history of the bishopric has been written in two volumes by Kerschbaumer (Vienna, 1875-6).</p><p>SAN LUCAR DE BARRAMEDA, a town of Spain, in the province of Cadiz, and 27 miles by sea from that city, in a bare, sandy, and undulating country, on the left bank of the Guadalquivir, not far from its mouth. It stands partly on the flat bank of the river and partly on the rising ground behind, the summit of which is crowned by an old Moorish castle. There is an old parish church dating from the 14th century. The other buildings have no special interest, and the place as a whole is dull and lifeless, having lost much of the commercial importance it formerly possessed. It is now chiefly dependent on the trade in its wines, which is still considerable. Many of the inhabitants are employed in agriculture and fishing. The population within the municipal boundaries was 21,918 in 1877.</p><p>SAN LUIS POTOSI, a city of Mexico, capital of the state of the same name, is situated at a height of 6200 feet on the eastern edge of the great plain of Anahuac, in a valley running north and south, 160 miles north-west of Queretaro. It is a great centre for the “ diligence ” traffic, and in 1885 was connected by rail with Tampico, a promising harbour on the Gulf of Mexico. The city proper, which has a rather imposing Oriental appearance, is laid out with great regularity; the streets are well-paved, and the houses, usually two stories in height, are frequently fine specimens of old Spanish architecture. But suburbs of wretched hovels spread over a considerable area. Among the conspicuous buildings are the cathedral, the Government house, with a front in rose-coloured stone, the city-hall, the mint, the churches of El Carmen, San Francisco, &amp;c., and the recently erected “ American ” hotel, which, with tramways, telephones, and electric light, is a symptom of the Occidentalizing that is rapidly taking place in the inland cities of Mexico. The Instituto Cientifico is a kind of university for the teaching of law, medicine, and the exact sciences. Plaza Hidalgo takes its name from the statue to the martyr of Mexican independence. A considerable trade is carried on in cattle, hides, and tallow. The population is stated at 30,000, or with the suburbs 60,000.</p><p>Founded in 1586, San Luis Potosi has played an important part in the Mexican civil wars. In 1863 it was the seat of the national government under Juarez, and after being occupied by Bazaine was recovered by Juarez in 1867.</p><p>SAN MARINO, the smallest independent republic in Europe, has an area of 33 square miles (Strelbitsky), lies between the provinces of Forlì and Pesaro-Urbino, and consists of part of the eastern spurs of the Apennines. Monte Titano, the central and culminating summit, has three peaks (M. Guaita, Cucco, and Gista), the three <hi rend="italic">Penne </hi>of San Marino—a name evidently identical with the Celtic Penn or Benn, but translated by the canting heraldry of the republic’s coat of arms as three “ feathers.” The two</p></body></text></TEI>
