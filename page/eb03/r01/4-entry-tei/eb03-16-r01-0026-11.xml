<p><label>REAUMUR</label>
(Rene Antoine Ferchault, Sieur de), a perſon diſtinguiſhed for his laborious τefearches into natural knowledge, was born at Rochelle in 1683, of a family belonging to the law. After having ſiniſhed his early ſtudies in the place of his birth, he began a courſe ' of philoſophy at Poitiers, and of civil law at Bourges ; but ſoon relinquiſhed the latter, to apply himſelf, according tαlιis taſte, to mathematics, phyſics, and∙natu-ral hiſtory. Being come to Paris, he was received into thé Academy of Sciences in 1708. From that hour he wàs wholly employed in.natural hiſtory, to which his.in-</p>

<p>clination particularly led him, and his inquiries were not confined to any one part of it. His memoirs, his ob-ſervations, his diſcoveries on the formation of ſhells, ſpiders, muſcles, the marine-flea, the berry which affords tbe purple colour, and on the cauſe of the n,umbnefs of the torpedo, excited the curioſity of the public, and early procured our author the character of an able, curious, and entertaining naturaliſt:. Filled with zeal for the welfare and advantage of ſoeiety, and the progreſs and perfection of arts, he endeavoured in all his τe-ſearches to promote the public good. We were indebt-ed to him for the difcovery of the Turquois mines in Languedoc. Fie alſo found out a ſubſtance, which is. uſed to give falfe ſtones a colour, which is obtained from a certain ſiſh called in the French <hi rend="italic">dble</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Ablete *</hi> on account of its whiteneſs, and which is the <hi rend="italic">Bleak</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Blay</hi> of our writers fi. His experiments on the art of turning iron into ſteel obtained him a penſion of 12,oco livres ; and this reward was be continued to the Academy to ſupport the expence which might accrue in this art.</p><p>He continued his inquiries on the art of making tin andporcelain£, and endeavoured to render our thermome-ters more uſeful than thoſe of former times : he compoſed a curious hiſtory of rivers where gold duſt is found in F rance ; and gave ſo ſimple and eaſy a detail of the art of gathering this duſt, that perſons have been employed for that purpofe.</p><p>He alſs made curious and important obfervations on tbe nature of flints, on the banks of foſſil ſhells, from whence is obtained in Touraine an excellent manure for land ; as likewiſe on birds and their preiervation·, on their method of budding neſts ; on infects ; and a great num-ber of other ſubjects, not leſs curious than uſeful.</p><p>He imagined at ſirſt, that a certain varniſh would keep eggs freſh ; but the waſte of time and money, &amp;c. ſhowed him the.inconveniences of ſuch a proceſs. He afterwards adopted the method practiſed for time imme-morial in Greece and the iſlands of the Archipelago, which is to ſteep or immerſe eggs in oil, or melted tat ; by this means, not being expofed to the air or to froſt, they are well preſerved, and contract no bad ſmell. An-other experiment ſtill more important, made by our au-thor, was to introduce into France the art of hatching fowl and birds, as practiſed in Egypt, without covering the eggs. Active, ſedulous, and attentive, he was ear-ly in his ſtudy, often at ſix in the morning. Exact in his experiments and obfervations, he let no circumftance efcape him. His writings muſt be of great uſe to future philoſophers. In ſociety, he was diſtinguiſhed through life for his modeſt and agreeable behaviour. His probity, benevolence, goodnefs oſ heart, and other ami-able qualities, as well natural as acquired, endeared him to his countrymen. He di d in the 76th year of his age, on the 18th of october 1757, and left this world -filled with ſentiments of piety. His death was the conſequence of a fall, which happened at the caſtle of Barnardiere on the Maine, where he went to pafs his vacation. He bequeathed to the Academy of Sciences his manuſcripts ajjd all his natural productions. His works are, 1. A very great number of memoirs and «bſervations on different parts of natural hiſtory ; they are printed in the collections of the Academy of Sciences. ≤. A large work printed feparately in 6 vols in 4to, in-titled, A Natural Hiſtory of Infects. This important</p><p>work contain? a defcription of vaſt numbers of câterpil-lers, moths⅛ gall infects, flies with two and four wings, lady-birds, and thoſe ephεmeron flies which live only in that form a few hou∣∙s ; and laſtly, of thofe ſingular and wonderful infects, which are called <hi rend="italic">polypes,</hi> which being cut .into ſeveral pieces, each piece lives, grows, and be-comes an infect, and affords to our eyes a great number of prodigies*. The works of M. de Reaumur are exact, cui ious, intereſting, and very ingenious. They are written with much candour, clearncſs, and elegance ; but it muſt be ackowledged his manner is ſomewhat too dif-fuſe. But we muſt not deceive the rçader; he often raiſes our expectations, and does' not give us all the ſa-tisfaction we prdmiſe ourfelves from his writings. .Hιa method of raiſing poultry, in particular, rather disappoints us. He ſpared neither care, time, nor expence, to render it practicable : he flattered himſelf and his countrymen with the greateſt hopes ; but notwithſtaſid-ing his aſſiduons induſtry, and vaſt charges, it proved abortive. The late M∙ l’Advocat recommended him tq obtain better information from Egypt on the ſuhject <hi rend="sub">i</hi> j arid if poſſible to procure a perſon verſed in the art to inſtruct him in it ; but his death prevented the completion of the ſcheme. If the native of Egypt had arrived, ſhowed M. de. Reaumur a better method than his own, and practiſed it with ſucceſs, as iu. his country, the community would have been benefited ; on the other hand, he would have ſeen, had it failed, that the climate of France was not proper for fuch experiments. M∙ Maillet, conſul at Cairo, to whom Monſieur the re-gent had written to obtain the art, offered to ſend over a native of Egypt, if the government would pay the expence of his voyage, and allow him a penfion of 1500 livres. M. Maillet rightly judged, whey he preferred this method of proceeding. M. de Reaumur was not ignorant of the defign ; but he flattered himſelf, that his efforts would be ſucceſsful without further aid, and thought he ſhould acquire ſome honour. He certainly had great talents, induſtry, ſagacity, and every other requiſite which are neceſſary in ſuch attempts ; but it is morally impoſſible that a fingle man, in a different, cli, mate, can attain ſuch knowledge in an art as thoſe who Live in a more favourable country, and have had the experience oſ. many ages to profit by : however M. dc Reaumur may have been unſucceſsſul, poſterity is in-debted to him ſor his repeated trials. He has removed ſome difficulties in the road, and thoſe that travel ſt may diſcover what he only ſaw at a diſtance.</p>
