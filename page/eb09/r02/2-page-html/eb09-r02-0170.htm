<p><span class="font0">to see how far he could be trained as an artist. We may suppose this to have been towards 1533, when Titian was&nbsp;already fifty-six years of age. Ridolfi is our authority for&nbsp;saying that Tintoret had only been ten days in the studio&nbsp;when Titian sent him home once and for all. The reason,&nbsp;according to the same writer, is that the great master observed some very spirited drawings, which he learned to&nbsp;be the production of Tintoret ; and it is inferred that he&nbsp;became at once jealous of so promising a scholar. This,&nbsp;however, is mere conjecture ; and perhaps it may be fairer&nbsp;to suppose that the drawings exhibited so much independence of manner that Titian judged that young Robusti,&nbsp;although he might become a painter, would never be properly a pupil. From this time forward the two always&nbsp;remained upon distant terms,—Robusti being indeed a professed and ardent admirer of Titian, but never a friend,&nbsp;and Titian and his adherents turning the cold shoulder to&nbsp;Robusti. Active disparagement also was not wanting, but&nbsp;it passed disdainfully unnoticed by Tintoret. The latter&nbsp;sought for no further teaching, but studied on his own&nbsp;account with laborious zeal ; he lived poorly, collecting&nbsp;casts, bas-reliefs, &amp;c., and practising by their aid. His&nbsp;noble conception of art and his high personal ambition&nbsp;were evidenced in the inscription which he placed over his&nbsp;studio,—“Il disegno di Michelangelo ed il colorito di&nbsp;Tiziano ” (Michelangelo’s design and Titian’s colour).&nbsp;He studied more especially from models of Buonarroti’s&nbsp;Dawn, Noon, Twilight, and Night, and became expert in&nbsp;modelling in wax and clay,—a method (practised likewise&nbsp;by Titian) which afterwards stood him in good stead in&nbsp;working out the arrangement of his pictures. The models&nbsp;were sometimes taken from dead subjects dissected or&nbsp;studied in anatomy schools; some were draped, others&nbsp;nude, and Robusti was wont to suspend them in a wooden&nbsp;or cardboard box, with an aperture for a candle. Now&nbsp;and afterwards he very frequently worked by night as well&nbsp;as by day. The young painter Schiavone, four years&nbsp;Robusti’s junior, was much in his company. Tintoret&nbsp;helped Schiavone gratis in wall-paintings ; and in many&nbsp;subsequent instances he worked also for nothing, and thus&nbsp;succeeded in obtaining commissions. The two earliest&nbsp;mural paintings of Robusti—done, like others, for next to no&nbsp;pay—are said to have been Belshazzar’s Feast and a Cavalry&nbsp;Fight, both long since perished. Such, indeed, may be&nbsp;said to have been the fate of all his frescos, early or later.&nbsp;The first work of his which attracted some considerable&nbsp;notice was a portrait-group of himself and his brother—the&nbsp;latter playing a guitar—with a nocturnal effect ; this also&nbsp;is lost. It was followed by some historical subject, which&nbsp;Titian was candid enough to praise. One of Tintoret’s&nbsp;early pictures still extant is in the church of the Carmine&nbsp;in Venice, the Presentation of Jesus in the Temple; also&nbsp;in S. Benedetto are the Annunciation and Christ with the&nbsp;Woman of Samaria. For the Scuola della Trinità (the&nbsp;scuole or schools of Venice were more in the nature of&nbsp;hospitals or charitable foundations than of educational institutions) he painted four subjects from Genesis. Two of&nbsp;these, now in the Venetian Academy, are Adam and Eve&nbsp;and the Death of Abel, both noble works of high mastery,&nbsp;which leave us in no doubt that Robusti was by this time&nbsp;a consummate painter,—one of the few who have attained&nbsp;to the highest eminence by dire study of their own, unseconded by any training from some senior proficient.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Towards 1546 Robusti painted for the church of S. Maria dell’ Orto three of his leading works—the Worship&nbsp;of the Golden Calf, the Presentation of the Virgin in the&nbsp;Temple, and the Last Judgment—now shamefully repainted ; and he settled down in a house hard by the&nbsp;church. It is a Gothic edifice, looking over the lagoon of&nbsp;Murano to the Alps, built in the Fondamenta de’ Mori,&nbsp;still standing, but let out cheap to artisans. In 1548 he&nbsp;was commissioned for four pictures in the Scuola di S.&nbsp;Marco—the Finding of the Body of St Mark in Alexandria&nbsp;(now in the church of the Angeli, Murano), the Saint’s&nbsp;Body brought to Venice, a Votary of the Saint delivered&nbsp;by invoking him from an Unclean Spirit (these two are in&nbsp;the library of the royal palace, Venice), and the highly&nbsp;and justly celebrated Miracle of the Slave. This last,&nbsp;which forms at present one of the chief glories of the&nbsp;Venetian Academy, represents the legend of a Christian&nbsp;slave or captive who was to be tortured as a punishment for&nbsp;some acts of devotion to the evangelist, but was saved by&nbsp;the miraculous intervention of the latter, who shattered the&nbsp;bone-breaking and blinding implements which were about&nbsp;to be applied. These four works were greeted with signal&nbsp;and general applause, including that of Titian’s intimate,&nbsp;the too potent Pietro Aretino, with whom Tintoret, one of&nbsp;the few men who scorned to curry favour with him, w<sup>r</sup>as&nbsp;mostly in disrepute. It is said, however, that Tintoret at&nbsp;one time painted a ceiling in Pietro’s house ; at another&nbsp;time, being invited to do his portrait, he attended, and at&nbsp;once proceeded to take his sitter’s measure with a pistol&nbsp;(or else a stiletto), as a significant hint that he was not&nbsp;exactly the man to be trifled with. The painter having&nbsp;now executed the four works in the Scuola di S. Marco,&nbsp;his straits and obscure endurances were over. He married&nbsp;Faustina de’ Vescovi, daughter of a Venetian nobleman.&nbsp;She appears to have been a careful housewife, and one who&nbsp;both would and could have her way with her not too tractable husband. Faustina bore him several children, probably two sons and five daughters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The next conspicuous event in the professional life of Tintoret is his enormous labour and profuse self-development on the walls and ceilings of the Scuola di S. Rocco,&nbsp;a building which may now almost be regarded as a shrine&nbsp;reared by Robusti to his own genius. The building had&nbsp;been begun in 1525 by the Lombardi, and was very deficient in light, so as to be particularly ill-suited for any&nbsp;great scheme of pictorial adornment. The painting of its&nbsp;interior was commenced in 1560. In that year five principal painters, including Tintoret and Paul Veronese, were&nbsp;invited to send in trial-designs for the centre-piece in the&nbsp;smaller hall, named Saia dell’ Albergo, the subject being&nbsp;S. Rocco received into Heaven. Tintoret produced not a&nbsp;sketch but a picture, and got it inserted into its oval.&nbsp;The competitors remonstrated, not unnaturally ; but the&nbsp;artist, who knew how to play his own game, made a free&nbsp;gift of the picture to the saint, and, as a bye-law of the&nbsp;foundation prohibited the rejection of any gift, it was retained </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">in situ,—</span><span class="font0">Tintoret furnishing gratis the other decorations of the same ceiling. In 1565 he resumed work at&nbsp;the scuola, painting the magnificent Crucifixion, for which&nbsp;a sum of 250 ducats was paid. In 1576 he presented&nbsp;gratis another centre-piece,—that for the ceiling of the&nbsp;great hall, representing the Plague of Serpents ; and in the&nbsp;following year he completed this ceiling with pictures of&nbsp;the Paschal Feast and Moses striking the Rock,—accepting&nbsp;whatever pittance the confraternity chose to pay. Robusti&nbsp;next launched out into the painting of the entire scuola&nbsp;and of the adjacent church of S. Rocco. He offered in&nbsp;November 1577 to execute the works at the rate of 100&nbsp;ducats per annum, three pictures being due in each year.&nbsp;This proposal was accepted and was punctually fulfilled,&nbsp;the painter’s death alone preventing the execution of some&nbsp;of the ceiling-subjects. The whole sum paid for the scuola&nbsp;throughout was 2447 ducats. Disregarding some minor&nbsp;performances, the scuola and church contain fifty-two&nbsp;memorable paintings, which may be described as vast suggestive sketches, with the mastery, but not the deliberate&nbsp;precision, of finished pictures, and adapted for being</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
