<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">period of investigation, despite a few observations by V agner and others, practically opens with Kdlliker’s fundamental observation&nbsp;(1841) that the head of each spermatozoon arose from the metamorphosis of a seminal cell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">In 1844 Haeckel described in </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Helix</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> the cells destined to become spermatozoa as arising on the surface of an epithelial cell of the&nbsp;germ follicle. In a more elaborate paper </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(Z. JV. Z.,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> 1856) Kolliker&nbsp;compared the process of spermatogenesis in the Bull, Dog, and Babbit&nbsp;with considerable detail, distinguishing in all cases the lining of&nbsp;the tubule into two kinds of cells,—the outer having large nuclei&nbsp;and nucleoli, and undergoing rapid multiplication, while the thick&nbsp;inner layer of smaller cells was becoming differentiated into the&nbsp;true sperm-cells, which might be either unicellular or multicellular&nbsp;“cysts.” He also described the origin of the head of the spermatozoon (and indeed also that of its tail) from the nucleus of this&nbsp;parent cell, and the breaking loose of the spermatozoon from its&nbsp;parent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Henle (1865) showed that the tail was developed from a portion of the protoplasm, thus preparing for the comparison with ciliated&nbsp;epithelial ,cells soon afterwards instituted by Schweigger-Seidel.&nbsp;Sertoli (1865) described certain “ramified cells” in the seminal&nbsp;tubules, and Merkel (1871) regarded these as forming a framework&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(Stiitzzellen)</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> for other cells from which the spermatozoa developed.&nbsp;In the same year, however, appeared the important researches of&nbsp;Yon Ebner, whose views will be understood by the aid of fig. 4.&nbsp;He described the large cells just mentioned as provided with a&nbsp;large and well-defined nucleus and nucleolus, and as being confluent at their base with each other, so forming a protoplasmic&nbsp;layer (</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Keimnetz</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">), but stretching forwards into the lumen of the&nbsp;duct as irregular prolongations ; these become lobed or fingered,&nbsp;each lobe independently developing a nucleus, the large primitive&nbsp;nucleus remaining unchanged. To the whole prolongation with&nbsp;its lobes he applies the term </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">spermatoblast.</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> From each lobe a&nbsp;spermatozoon develops, the nucleus lengthening to form the main&nbsp;portion of the head, while a thin film of the protoplasm elongates&nbsp;into the cilium or tail. The young spermatozoa at first press</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">downwards into the body of the spermatoblast, so as to form bundles, but, when ultimately liberated, curl themselves up to roll&nbsp;down the seminal tubule, the more or less branched stump of the&nbsp;spermatoblast alone remaining along with the smaller cells of the&nbsp;tubules, which, according to him, take no part in the process, but&nbsp;merely perform nutritive or mechanical functions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">A vigorous controversy at once arose, but Merkel claimed these spermatoblasts as being simply his “Stiitzzellen,” and described&nbsp;the spermatozoa as arising from the small round cells, and as being&nbsp;only secondarily received into cavities of the former, a view which&nbsp;Henle also adopted. Sertoli also regarded Ebner’s spermatoblasts as his “ramified cells,” and ascribed all spermatogenetic&nbsp;functions to the round cells, which he distinguished in their&nbsp;youngest state as “germinative,” and later as “seminiferous” cells,&nbsp;which then divided to form “ nematoblasts, ” these directly&nbsp;developing into spermatozoa. Blumberg (1873) attempted to&nbsp;reconcile the disputants by ascribing spermatogenetic functions&nbsp;both to the spermatoblasts and to the round cells. Neumann,&nbsp;while supporting Von Ebner in the main, describes his spermatoblasts as not processes of the nutritive network (“Keimnetz”), but&nbsp;as modified from the ordinary epithelium of the seminal tubule, and&nbsp;disputed the existence of Merkel’s framework altogether ; and this&nbsp;essential confirmation of Yon Ebner’s view was supported by&nbsp;Mihalkovicz, Landois, and others. In a later paper he attempted&nbsp;to show that the lobes of Von Ebner’s spermatoblasts might&nbsp;become separated off as the small round cells, and might then&nbsp;cither break up or develop into spermatozoa. Krause (1876), while&nbsp;otherwise supporting Von Ebner, graphically described the spermatoblasts as ciliated cells with ramified and even anastomosing&nbsp;processes, so doing away with any connective-tissue system&nbsp;altogether. Sertoli, however, continued to support his own view&nbsp;with greater elaborateness than ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Semper’s well-known researches (1875) on the urinogenital system of Elasmobranclis included an important contribution on&nbsp;spermatogenesis. He described an invagination of the germinal&nbsp;epithelium or of the primitive ova into the subjacent stroma, where&nbsp;they form a primitive follicle, which again comes into relation&nbsp;with the incipient tubule. The central cell of the follicle undergoes&nbsp;mucous degeneration and becomes absorbed, leaving a cavity lined&nbsp;by a single layer of epithelial cells, which divide rapidly, becoming&nbsp;cylindrical, with large round nuclei. These divide into a </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> covercell ” and a “ mother-cell ” ; the nucleus of the latter divides&nbsp;repeatedly until about sixty sperm nuclei are formed, w<sup>r</sup>hich&nbsp;elongate to form the heads of the spermatozoa. As these develop&nbsp;they come to lie in a bunch, lying into the cavity of the follicle,&nbsp;their expulsion being effected by the swelling of the nucleus of the&nbsp;cover-cell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">An important series of researches by Von La Valette St George on spermatogenesis among Vertebrates was meanwhile in progress.&nbsp;In his final paper (1878) he describes the seminal tubules as containing tw<sup>T</sup>o distinct types of cell. One kind, resembling young&nbsp;ovules, which he terms primitive seminal cells or </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">spermatogonia,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">divide into a mass or </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">spermalogemma</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> of small cells </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(spermatocytes).</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> These spermatocytes may either </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(a)</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> all develop into&nbsp;spermatozoa (Mammals), or (</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">b</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">) a single spermatocyte may become&nbsp;modified as a basilar cell (Plagiostome Fishes), or (c) a number may&nbsp;form an envelope or cyst around the others (Amphibians and&nbsp;Fishes). The second kind of primitive cells he terms “follicle-cells, ” and regards as non-essential; these are united into a loose&nbsp;tissue and envelop the spermatogonia and spermatogemma.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">In this view we have a marked divergence from both preceding theories, as the author does not hesitate to point out. He regards&nbsp;Von Ebner’s “Keimnetz” and “ spermatoblasts” as confounding&nbsp;both his follicle cells with their included sperrnatogernmre, and&nbsp;interprets Neumann’s figures confirmatory of Von Ebner in the&nbsp;same way. Merkel’s “ Stiitzzellen ” he identifies as his “ follicle-cells ” altered by reagents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The subsequent researches of Helman (1880), Krause, and Nussbaum among Vertebrates need only be mentioned as essentially confirmatory of the observations of La Valette. Meyer’s careful&nbsp;observations (1880) also led him to the same general view', with the&nbsp;important difference, suggested by one of the preceding authors,&nbsp;that the “ follicle cells ” of La Valette were not inert as he supposed,&nbsp;but the earliest stages of his spermatogonia and spermatogemma;.&nbsp;Klein’s views (1881) have perhaps most relation to those of Sertoli.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Some important work was meanw'hile being done among Invertebrates. In 1877 F. E. Scliultze described spermatogenesis in the Sponge </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Halisarca,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">—a germinal cell, analogous to that which gives&nbsp;rise to an ovum, becoming covered by an epithelium, and dividing into a multitude of segments, each of which becomes drawn&nbsp;out iuto a spermatozoon. In 1844 Meckel had described the spermatozoa of the Snail as arising superficially from a mother-cell,&nbsp;and this view had been confirmed by various authors. In 1879&nbsp;Duval described in the same animal the spermatocytes as arising&nbsp;by the endogenous division of a mother-cell, and subsequently&nbsp;coming to its surface, and Hallez described an essentially similar&nbsp;process in some Planarians. Graff, how'ever, found in other species&nbsp;that no remnant survived, but that the whole of the spermatogonia&nbsp;became converted into spermatocytes. In 1880 Blomfield investigated the process in the Earthw׳orm, his results resembling rather&nbsp;those of Von Ebner (fig. 4) than those of La Valette. Strongly emphasizing, however, the importance of the nutritive basal cell or&nbsp;spermatoblast of Von Ebner, he proposed yet another nomenclature.&nbsp;In a subsequent paper (1882) he describes the process in the Snail and&nbsp;the Frog. The former agrees substantially with the Worm, but in&nbsp;the Frog a hollow spermatogemma arises; each of its cells elongates&nbsp;to form a spermatozoon ; these while still immature arrange themselves in bundles round one of the more superficial cells, which&nbsp;“become blastophoral corpuscles,”—a view' which recalls Merkel’s&nbsp;explanation of Von Ebner’s spermatoblasts, mentioned above, viz.,&nbsp;that the spermatozoa only became temporarily lodged in their&nbsp;recesses after completing their development.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">In this respect the view of Renson (1882) is especially interesting. He describes the follicular cells of La Valette as segmenting into</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
