<p><span class="font1">On the 29th of April 1483, supported by the duke of Buckingham, he intercepted his nephew at Stony Stratford and arrested Lord Rivers and Richard Grey, the little king’s half-brother.&nbsp;It was in Richard’s charge that Edward was brought to London&nbsp;On the 4th of May. Richard was recognized as protector, the&nbsp;Woodville faction was overthrown, and the queen with her&nbsp;younger children took sanctuary at Westminster. For the&nbsp;time the government was carried on in Edward’s name, and the&nbsp;22nd of June was appointed for his coronation. Richard was&nbsp;nevertheless gathering forces and concerting with his friends.&nbsp;In the council there was a party, of whom Hastings and Bishop&nbsp;Morton were the chief, which was loyal to the boy-king. On the&nbsp;13th of June came the famous scene when Richard appeared&nbsp;suddenly in the council baring his withered arm and accusing&nbsp;Jane Shore and the queen of sorcery; Hastings, Morton and&nbsp;Stanley were arrested and the first-named at once beheaded.&nbsp;A few days later, probably on the 25th of June, Rivers and Grey&nbsp;were executed at Pontefract. On the 22nd of June Dr Shaw&nbsp;was put up to preach at Paul’s Cross against the legitimacy of&nbsp;the children of Edward IV. On the 25th a sort of parliament&nbsp;was convened at which Edward’s marriage was declared invalid&nbsp;on the ground of his precontract with Eleanor Talbot, and&nbsp;Richard rightful king. Richard, who was not present, accepted&nbsp;the crown with feigned reluctance, and from the following day&nbsp;began his formal reign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">On the 6th of July Richard was crowned at Westminster, and immediately afterwards made a royal progress through the&nbsp;Midlands, on which he was well received. But in spite of its&nbsp;apparent success the usurpation was not popular. Richard’s&nbsp;position could not be secure whilst his nephews lived. There&nbsp;seems to be no reasonable doubt that early in August Edward V.&nbsp;and his brother Richard (whom Elizabeth Woodville had been&nbsp;forced to surrender) were murdered by their uncle’s orders in&nbsp;the Tower. Attempts have been made to clear Richard’s&nbsp;memory. But the report of the princes’ death was believed in&nbsp;England at the time, “ for which cause king Richard lost the&nbsp;hearts of the people ” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{Chronicles of London,</span><span class="font1"> 191), and it was&nbsp;referred to as a definite fact before the French states-general&nbsp;in January 1484. The general, if vague, dissatisfaction found&nbsp;its expression in Buckingham’s rebellion. Richard, however,&nbsp;was fortunate, and the movement collapsed. He met his only&nbsp;parliament in January 1484 with some show of triumph, and&nbsp;deserves credit for the wise intent of its legislation. He could&nbsp;not, however, stay the undercurrent of disaffection, and his&nbsp;ministers, Lovell and Catesby, were unpopular. His position&nbsp;was weakened by the death of his only legitimate son in April&nbsp;1484. His queen died also a year later (March 16, 1485), and&nbsp;public opinion was scandalized by the rumour that Richard&nbsp;intended to marry his own niece, Elizabeth of York. Thus the&nbsp;feeling in favour of his rival Henry Tudor strengthened. Henry&nbsp;landed at Milford Haven on the 7th of August 1485, and it was&nbsp;with dark forebodings that Richard met him at Bosworth on the&nbsp;22nd. The defection of the Stanleys decided the day. Richard&nbsp;was killed fighting, courageous at all events. After the battle&nbsp;his body was carried to Leicester, trussed across a horse’s back,&nbsp;and buried without honour in the church of the Greyfriars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Richard was not the villain that his enemies depicted. He had good qualities, both as a man and a ruler, and showed a&nbsp;sound judgment of political needs. Still it is impossible to&nbsp;acquit him of the crime, the popular belief in which was the&nbsp;chief cause of his ruin. He was not a monster; but a typical&nbsp;man in an age of strange contradictions of character, of culture&nbsp;combined with cruelty, and of an emotional temper that was&nbsp;capable of high ends, though unscrupulous of means. Tradition&nbsp;represents Richard as deformed. It seems clear that he had&nbsp;some physical defect, though not so great as has been alleged.&nbsp;John Stow told Buck that old men who remembered Richard&nbsp;described him as in bodily form comely enough. Extant&nbsp;portraits show an intellectual face characteristic of the early&nbsp;Renaissance, but do not indicate any deformity.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RICHARD, FRANÇOIS MARIE BENJAMIN (1819-1908), archbishop of Paris, French prelate, was born at Nantes on the&nbsp;1st of March 1819. Educated at the seminary of St Sulpice&nbsp;he became successively vicar-general of Nantes, bishop of&nbsp;Belley, and in 1875 coadjutor of Paris. In 1886 the death of&nbsp;Archbishop Guibert was followed by Mgr. Richard’s appointment to the see of Paris, and in 1889 he received a cardinal’s&nbsp;hat. In January 1900 the trial of the Assumptionist Fathers&nbsp;resulted in the dissolution of their society as an illegal association. Next day an official visit of the archbishop to the Fathers&nbsp;was noted by government as an act of a political character,&nbsp;and Mgr. Richard was officially censured. His attitude was in&nbsp;general exceedingly moderate, he had no share in the extremist&nbsp;policy of the Ultramontanes, and throughout the struggle over&nbsp;the law of Associations and the law of Separations he maintained&nbsp;his reasonable temper. He presided in September 1906 over&nbsp;an assembly of bishops and archbishops at his palace in the&nbsp;rue de Grenelle, a few days after the papal encyclical forbidding&nbsp;French Catholics to form associations for public worship, but&nbsp;it was then too late for conciliation. In December he gave up&nbsp;the archiepiscopal palace to the government authorities. He&nbsp;was then an old man of nearly ninety, and his “ eviction ”&nbsp;evoked great sympathy. Cardinal Richard died on the 29th&nbsp;of January 1908.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RICHARD, HENRY (1812-1888), WeIsh politician, was the son of the Rev. Ebenezer Richard (1781-1837), a Calvinistic&nbsp;Methodist minister, and was born on the 3rd of April 1812.&nbsp;Educated at Llangeitho grammar school, he also studied at a&nbsp;college at Highbury, and in 1835 he became minister of a Congregational church in the Old Kent Road, London, a position&nbsp;which he retained for fifteen years. Richard is chiefly known&nbsp;as an advocate of peace and international arbitration. In&nbsp;1848 he became secretary of the Peace Society, and in this&nbsp;capacity he helped to organize a series of congresses in the&nbsp;capitals of Europe, and was partly instrumental in securing the&nbsp;insertion of a declaration in favour of arbitration in the treaty&nbsp;of Paris in 1856. He resigned this post in 1885. In 1868 Richard&nbsp;was elected member of parliament for the Merthyr boroughs, and&nbsp;he remained in the House of Commons until his death at Treborth,&nbsp;near Bangor, on the 20th of August 1888. In parliament he&nbsp;was a leading member of the party which advocated the removal&nbsp;of Nonconformist grievances and the disestablishment of the&nbsp;church in Wales; in 1877 he was chairman of the Congregational&nbsp;Union of England and Wales. Among Richard’s writings may&nbsp;be mentioned: </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Defensive War</span><span class="font1"> (1846, and again 1890); </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Memoirs&nbsp;of Joseph Sturge</span><span class="font1"> (1864); </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Letters on the Social and Political&nbsp;Condition of the Principality of Wales</span><span class="font1"> (1866, and again 1884);&nbsp;and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Recent Progress of International Arbitration</span><span class="font1"> (1884). He&nbsp;also prepared some of the material for the fife of his friend and&nbsp;associate, Richard Cobden, which was written by Mr John,&nbsp;now Lord, Morley; and he did some journalistic work in the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Morning Star</span><span class="font1"> and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Evening Star.</span></p>
