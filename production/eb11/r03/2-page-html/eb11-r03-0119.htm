<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">the Reign of the Emperor Charles the Fifth</span><span class="font1"> occupied ten consecutive years of labour. It appeared in three volumes quarto in 1769. In 1777 he published his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">History of America</span><span class="font1"> and in&nbsp;1791 his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Disquisition concerning the Knowledge which the Ancients&nbsp;had of India,</span><span class="font1"> which concluded his historical labours and appeared only two years before his death, which occurred near&nbsp;Edinburgh on the nth of June 1793. His fame had long been&nbsp;European, and he left no rival in the field of historical composition save Gibbon alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For an adequate appreciation of Robertson’s position in British literature, and more especially of his rank as an historian,&nbsp;we have to consider the country and the age in which he was&nbsp;born and his own personal qualities and limits. Considering&nbsp;the small size and poverty of the country, Scotland had made&nbsp;a more than creditable figure in literature in the great age of&nbsp;the Reformation and the Renaissance, and Scottish contributions to British literature in the last half of the 18th century&nbsp;were distinctly superior to those produced in the southern&nbsp;portion of the island.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Of the three great British historians of the 18th century two were Scotsmen. The exact place of Robertson with regard to&nbsp;his two friends Hume and Gibbon, and to such historians as the&nbsp;rest of Europe had to offer, presents a question of some nicety,&nbsp;because it is complicated by extraneous considerations, so to&nbsp;speak, which should not weigh in an abstract estimate, but&nbsp;cannot be excluded in a concrete and practical one. If we&nbsp;regard only Robertson’s potential historic power, the question&nbsp;is not so much whether he was equal to either of his two friends&nbsp;as whether he was not superior to both. The man who wrote&nbsp;the review of the state of Europe prefixed to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">History of&nbsp;Charles</span><span class="font1"> F., or even the first book of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">History of Scotland,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">showed that he had a wider and more synthetic conception of&nbsp;history than either the author of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Decline and Fall</span><span class="font1"> or the&nbsp;author of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">History of England.</span><span class="font1"> These two portions of&nbsp;Robertson’s work, with all their shortcomings in the eye of&nbsp;modern criticism, have a distinctive value which time cannot&nbsp;take away. He was one of the first to see the importance of&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">general ideas</span><span class="font1"> in history. He saw that the immediate narrative&nbsp;of events with which he was occupied needed a background of&nbsp;broad and connected generalizations, referring to the social state&nbsp;of which the detailed history formed a part. But he did more&nbsp;than this. In the appendix to the view of Europe called&nbsp;“ Proofs and Illustrations ” he enters into the difficult and&nbsp;obscure question of land tenure in Frankish times, and of the&nbsp;origin of the feudal system, with a sagacity and knowledge&nbsp;which distinctly advanced the comprehension of this period&nbsp;beyond the point at which it had been left by Du Bos, Montesquieu and Mably. He was well acquainted with the original&nbsp;documents,—many of them, we may conjecture, not easy to&nbsp;procure in Scotland. It must have been a genuine aptitude&nbsp;for historical research of a scientific kind which led Robertson&nbsp;to undertake the labour of these austere disquisitions of which&nbsp;there were not many in his day who saw the importance. Gibbon,&nbsp;so superior to him for wide reading and scholarship, has pointedly&nbsp;avoided them. Robertson’s views are now out of date. But&nbsp;he deserves the honour of a pioneer in one of the most obscure&nbsp;if also important lines of inquiry connected with European&nbsp;history. On the other hand, it must be admitted that he showed&nbsp;himself only too tame a follower of Voltaire in his general&nbsp;appreciation of the middle ages, which he regarded with the&nbsp;mingled ignorance and prejudice common in the 18th century.&nbsp;In this particular he was not at all in advance of his age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The neglect and gradual oblivion which have overtaken the greater part of Robertson’s historical work are owing to no&nbsp;fault of his. He had not and could not have the requisite&nbsp;materials: they were not published or accessible? Justice&nbsp;requires that we should estimate his performance in view of the&nbsp;means at his command, and few critics would hesitate to subscribe to the verdict of Buckle, “ that what he effected with his&nbsp;materials was wonderful.” His style is singularly clear, harmonious and persuasive. The most serious reproach made&nbsp;against it is that it is correct to a fault and lacks idiomatic vigour,&nbsp;and the charge is not without foundation. But there can be&nbsp;no doubt that, if Robertson’s writings are less read than they&nbsp;formerly were, the fact is to be attributed to no defects of style&nbsp;but to the growth of knowledge and to the immense extension&nbsp;of historical research which has inevitably superseded his&nbsp;initiatory and meritorious labours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">By his wife, Mary Nisbet, whom he married in 1751, Robertson left three sons: William (1753-1835), who in 1805 was raised to the Scottish bench as Lord Robertson; James, who&nbsp;became a general in the British army; and David, who in 1799&nbsp;married Margaret, sister of Colonel Donald Macdonald and&nbsp;heiress of Kinloch-Moidart, whose surname he assumed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There are lives of Robertson by Dugald Stewart (Edinburgh, 1801 and 1802), prefixed to most of the collective editions of his&nbsp;works; by George Glcig, bishop of Brechin (Edinburgh, 1812); and&nbsp;by Lord Brougham in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lives of Men of Letters,</span><span class="font1"> &amp;c. (1845-1846).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROBERTSON, WILLIAM BRUCE (1820-1886), Scottish divine, was born at Greenhill, St Ninians, StirUngshire, on&nbsp;the 24th of May 1820, and was educated at Glasgow University&nbsp;and at the Secession Theological Hall, Edinburgh, where he&nbsp;made the acquaintance of Thomas de Quincey, and on his recommendation went to HaUe and studied under Tholuck. After&nbsp;travelling in Italy and Switzerland he was licensed to preach&nbsp;by the presbytery of Stirling and Falkirk in 1843, and was soon&nbsp;after ordained at the Secession (after 1847, the United Presbyterian) Church in Irvine, Ayrshire. In this charge he remained&nbsp;for 35 years, exercising from his pulpit a truly magnetic influence, not so discernible in his published sermons. From&nbsp;1871 his health failed, in spite of several visits to Florence and&nbsp;the Riviera. He resigned his charge in 1878 and died at Bridge&nbsp;ofAUan'on the 27th of June 1886.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">He wrote many hymns, among them a version of “ Dies Irae several of them, together with letters, &amp;c., are t«&gt; ix found Jnlhe&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font1"> by James Brown. A volume containing Robert* un V Jntures&nbsp;on Martin Luther and other subjects was published in Ÿ892.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROBERVAL, GILLES PERSONNE (or </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Personier)</span><span class="font1"> DE (1602-1675), French mathematician, was born at Roberval,&nbsp;near Beauvais, on the 8th of August 1602. His name was&nbsp;OriginaUy Gilles Personne, that of Roberval, by which he is&nbsp;known, being taken from the place of his birth. Like René&nbsp;Descartes, he was present at the siege of La Rochelle in 1627.&nbsp;In the same year he went to Paris, where he was appointed to&nbsp;the chair of philosophy in the Gervais CoUege in 1631, and two&nbsp;years later to the chair of mathematics in the Royal CoUege of&nbsp;France. A condition of tenure attached to this chair was that the&nbsp;holder should propose mathematical questions for solution, and&nbsp;should resign in favour of any person who solved them better than&nbsp;himself; but, notwithstanding this, Roberval was able to keep&nbsp;the chair till his death, which occurred at Paris on the 27th of&nbsp;October 1675.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Roberval was one of those mathematicians who, just before the invention of the infinitesimal calculus, occupied their attention&nbsp;with problems which are only soluble, or can be most easily solved,&nbsp;by some method involving limits or infinitesimals, and in the&nbsp;solution of which accordingly the calculus is always now employed.&nbsp;Thus he devoted some attention to the quadrature of surfaces and&nbsp;the cubature of solids, which he accomplished, in some of the&nbsp;simpler cases, by an original method which ne called the “ Method of&nbsp;Indivisibles but he lost much of the credit of the discovery as he&nbsp;kept his method for his own use,while Bonaventura Cavalieri published&nbsp;a similar method which he himself had invented. Another of Rober-val’s discoveries was a very general method of drawing tangents, by&nbsp;considering a curve as described by a moving point whose motion&nbsp;is the resultant of several simpler motions. (See Infinitesimal&nbsp;Calculus.) He also discovered a method of deriving one curve&nbsp;from another, by means of which finite areas can be obtained&nbsp;equal to the areas between certain curves and their asymptotes.&nbsp;To these curves, which were also applied to effect some quadratures,&nbsp;Evangelista Torricelli gave the name of “ Robervallian lines.”&nbsp;Between Roberval and Descartes there existed a feeling of ill-will,&nbsp;owing to the jealousy aroused in the mind of the former by the&nbsp;criticism which Descartes offered to some of the methods employed&nbsp;by him and by Pierre de Fermat; and this led him to criticize and&nbsp;oppose the analytical methods which Descartes introduced into&nbsp;geometry about this time. As results of RobervaPs labours outside the department of pure mathematics may be noted a wjork&nbsp;on the system of the universe, in which he supports the Concrnican&nbsp;system and attributes a mutual attraction to all particles of matter:</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
