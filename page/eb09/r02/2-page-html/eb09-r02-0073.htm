<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">στάσα δpικi∣.</span><span class="font1"> The distinction between justice and equity (τJ δίκαιον aud τδ </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ιπιtικls)</span><span class="font1"> is noticed. Equity is “a kind of justice,&nbsp;but goes beyond the written law,” as in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ethics</span><span class="font1"> (v. 10)&nbsp;equity is said to be a corrective of the law, where the latter fails&nbsp;through generality,—i. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.,</span><span class="font1"> through the lawmaker’s inability to&nbsp;frame a general rule which should precisely fit the circumstances&nbsp;of every particular case. True to his conception of a method,&nbsp;Aristotle next applies “the topic of degree” to injustice,—as, in&nbsp;an earlier chapter </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Rhet.,</span><span class="font1"> i. 7) he had applied it to the idea of&nbsp;“ good. ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The analysis of the three branches of rhetoric—deliberative, epideictic, forensic—is now finished. In the closing chapter of&nbsp;his first book, Aristotle briefly considers and dismisses the “ inartificial proofs,”—the means of persuasion, that is, which arise from&nbsp;matters external to the art itself, though the art uses them. These,&nbsp;having regard to the actual circumstances of his time and country,&nbsp;lie declares to be five : (1) laws ; (2) witnesses ; (3) evidence given&nbsp;under torture—</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">β0σavos ; </span><span class="font1">(4) documents ; (5) oaths, meaning&nbsp;chiefly treaties between states. With regard to (3) it may be remarked that the rhetorical theory of torture in the ancient world&nbsp;was, that a person uuder torture will tell the truth because it is&nbsp;his interest to do so. This is stated, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font1"> in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rhetorica ad&nbsp;Alexandnιm,</span><span class="font0"> XV. § </span><span class="font1">1. Among the Attic orators, Isæus gives his&nbsp;emphatic adhesion to this view (Or., viii. § 12). On the other&nbsp;hand, the common-sense view of the matter is very well put by&nbsp;another Attic orator, Antiphon, in his speech </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">De Cæde Herodis&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(§§31-33), when he remarks that “in the torturers is the hope&nbsp;of the tortured.” “So long, then,” Antiphon proceeds, “as the&nbsp;slave felt that his prospects in slandering λvere hopeful, he was&nbsp;obstinate in the calumny ; but, when he saw that he was to die,&nbsp;then at last he told the truth, and said that he had been persuaded by the persecutors to slander me.” It would have been&nbsp;interesting if Aristotle had given some indication of his view on&nbsp;this, his third, </span><span class="font0">⅛τ∈χvos </span><span class="font1">πiστσ ; but he simply accepts it as a fact&nbsp;of his day, and, taking it along with the rest, gives a number of&nbsp;general arguments which may be used on either side, according as&nbsp;the particular Sτ∈χvos τriστts is for us or against us. Here the&nbsp;first book ends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">At the beginning of the second book, Aristotle returns to the “artificial proofs” (evτ∈χvoi </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">πiσταs)—</span><span class="font1">those which rhetoric itself&nbsp;provides. Of these, the logical proof has already been in part&nbsp;discussed (i. 2). He therefore turns to the “ ethical ” proof. The&nbsp;speaker’s character may be so indicated by his speech as to prepossess the hearers ; and this result depends chiefly on three&nbsp;things. He should make them feel that he possesses (1) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">φρόνησα&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">—intelligence ; (2) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ipeτi∣—</span><span class="font1">virtue ; and (3) eυvotα—good-will to&nbsp;them. Aristotle then proceeds to furnish the speaker with the&nbsp;materials for seeming intelligent and good, referring for these to&nbsp;his previous analysis of the virtues (i. 9). As to the means of&nbsp;seeming friendly, these will be furnished by an analysis of the&nbsp;affections </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(πάθη).</span><span class="font1"> Here we are already on the boundary line&nbsp;between the “ethical proof” and the third of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">evτeχvοι πiστeα,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">the “emotional proof.” In regard to each affection (παθos), we&nbsp;have to see (1) what it is ; (2) what things predispose men to it ;&nbsp;(3) the objects and conditions of its manifestation. The next ten&nbsp;chapters of the second book (2-11) are accordingly devoted to an&nbsp;analysis of those emotions which it is most important for the&nbsp;rhetorician to understand :—viz. (1) anger, and its opposite, mildness ; (2) love and hatred ; (3) fear and boldness ; (4) compassion,&nbsp;envy, emulation ; (5) shame and shamelessness ; (6) gratitude&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(χαpts) ; </span><span class="font1">(7) righteous indignation (ve<sub>i</sub>ueσts). But, in appealing to&nbsp;these various emotions, the speaker must have regard to the general&nbsp;character of his audience, according, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font1"> as they are young or&nbsp;old, rich or poor, &amp;c. Hence it is necessary to know the characteristics of the various periods and conditions of life. Aristotle&nbsp;therefore delineates the chief traits of the young, of the old, and&nbsp;of men in their prime ; of the well-born, the rich, and the powerful. With regard to the well-born, he makes a remark which seems&nbsp;equally true of the rich : “ the possessor of good birth is the more&nbsp;ambitious ; for all men, when they have got anything, are wont&nbsp;to add to the heap” (ch. 12-17). The analysis of the “ethical”&nbsp;and the ‘ ‘ emotional ” proof is now finished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">After a concise retrospect, Aristotle passes to the treatment of a subject barely indicated in the first book (ch. 2). The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">κοινοί τόποι,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">or “universal commonplaces,” applicable to all materials, are&nbsp;mainly four :—(1) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">τό δυνατόν</span><span class="font1"> and τό </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">αδύνατον—</span><span class="font1">possibility and&nbsp;impossibility ; (2) τό </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">yeγοv0i</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">τb μiλλοv—</span><span class="font1">past and future ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;τό </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">αtiξeιv κal μeιουv</span><span class="font1"> (or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">μeyeθοs</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">μικροτηs)—</span><span class="font1">great and small ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;τό </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">μάλλον καί ήττον—</span><span class="font1">greater and less. Aristotle means that&nbsp;all subjects whatsoever admit of arguments into which these ideas&nbsp;enter. The first comes into play when we argue, “since this is&nbsp;possible, that must be so also ” ; the second, when we say, “ if this&nbsp;has been, that has been also,” or “if this is to happen, that will&nbsp;happen also.” For the third and fourth of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">κοινοί τόποι,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">magnitude and degree, we are referred back to bk. i. ch. 7 and 8,&nbsp;where they have already been handled. The second book is completed by a sort of appendix, intended to supplement the sketch of&nbsp;the “logical proof” given in bk. i. ch. 2. The “example,&quot; or&nbsp;rhetorical induction, had been rather cursorily treated there, and&nbsp;is now illustrated more fully (ii. 20). There are two kinds of&nbsp;“example”—the historical (τδ </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">πρayμaτa λiytιv)</span><span class="font1"> and the artificial&nbsp;(τό </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">αυτόν ποιeιv).</span><span class="font1"> The artificial example, again, has two species—&nbsp;—(1) comparison, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">παραβολή,—</span><span class="font1">as when Socrates said that magistrates ought not to be chosen by lot, for this is like choosing&nbsp;athletes by lot, rather than for athletic power ; (2) fiction, or fable&nbsp;in the special sense—</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">λοyοι</span><span class="font1"> ; as when Stesichorus warned the people&nbsp;of Himera against establishing a despot by telling them the fable&nbsp;of the horse who asked the man to help him against a deer. If&nbsp;you have no arguments of a logical kind (enthymemes), says&nbsp;Aristotle, the “ example ” must do duty as proof ; if you have&nbsp;enthymemes, it can serve as illustration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The use of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">yvωμaι,</span><span class="font1"> or general moral sentiments, next claims attention (ch. 21). These are of two classes—those which are self-evident, and those which, not being so obviously true, require&nbsp;some confirmatory comment </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(eπιλοyοi),</span><span class="font1"> as when Medea says that&nbsp;no sensible man should allow his children to be exquisitely&nbsp;educated, because it makes them fastidious and unpopular. Such&nbsp;maxims with an “epilogue” are, in fact, virtually enthymemes.&nbsp;Apropos of yrω<sub>j</sub>uαt, Aristotle remarks that spurious generalization&nbsp;is particularly useful in the utterance of bitter complaint (e.g.,&nbsp;“ frailty, thy name is woman ”). Then it is often effective to&nbsp;controvert received maxims, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font1"> “It is not well to ‘know&nbsp;oneself’ ; for if this man had known himself, he would never have&nbsp;become a general” (ch. 21).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Some precepts on the enthymeme follow. The rhetorical reasoner must not have too many links in the chain of his argument ; and&nbsp;he must omit those propositions which his hearers can easily&nbsp;supply. Also, it is highly important to know the special topics&nbsp;(∈fδr∕) from which enthymemes can be drawn in each subject. The&nbsp;enthymeme is either (1) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">δeικτ∣κ0v,</span><span class="font1"> demonstrative, establishing a&nbsp;point, or (2) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">tλeyκτικ0v,</span><span class="font1"> refutative, destroying a position by a&nbsp;comparison of conflicting statements (τό </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">τa avομολοyουμeva συva-yeιv).</span><span class="font1"> Aristotle now gives (ii. 23) an enumeration of classes or&nbsp;heads of argument </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(evθυμημaτικοl τόποι)</span><span class="font1"> from which enthymemes&nbsp;can be constructed. These apply nominally to all three branches&nbsp;of rhetoric, but in fact chiefly to the deliberative and the forensic.&nbsp;The demonstrative enthymeme is almost exclusively treated, since&nbsp;the refutative form can, of course, be inferred from the other. A&nbsp;chapter (24), answering to the treatise on fallacies in logic (π∈pl&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">σοφιστικών eλeyχωv),</span><span class="font1"> is devoted to the fallacious </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(φaιv0μevοv)&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">enthymeme, of which ten “topics” are explained and illustrated.&nbsp;Another chapter is given to the two general types of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">λύσα,</span><span class="font1"> or&nbsp;refutation (ch. 25), viz., (1) direct counter-argument-(τδ </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">avτισυλ∙&nbsp;λοyιζισθaι),</span><span class="font1"> opposing one enthymeme to another ; (2) objection to&nbsp;a particular point in the adversary’s case (τό </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">όνίστασθαι).</span><span class="font1"> The&nbsp;second book then concludes with some supplementary remarks,&nbsp;meant, seemingly, to correct errors made by previous writers on&nbsp;rhetoric (ch. 26).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In his first two books Aristotle has thus dealt with invention </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(eυpeσa)—</span><span class="font1">the discovery of means of persuasion. In the third book&nbsp;he deals with expression and arrangement (λe'ξιs and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">τaξιs).</span><span class="font1"> The&nbsp;subject is prepared by some remarks on the art of delivery </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(ύπόκρισa),&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">which Aristotle defines as the management of the voice. “ It is&nbsp;the art of knowing how to use the voice for the expression of each&nbsp;feeling, of knowing when it should be loud, low, or moderate, of&nbsp;managing its pitch—shrill, deep, or middle—and of adapting the&nbsp;cadences to the theme.” Aristotle says nothing on gesture or play&nbsp;of feature, which Cicero and Quintilian recognize as important.&nbsp;He includes them by implication, however, in saying that the art&nbsp;of delivery, whenever it is reduced to method, “ will perform the&nbsp;function of the actor's art,” adding that “the dramatic faculty is&nbsp;less a matter of art than of nature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But verbal expression, at least, is clearly in the province of art, and to that he now turns. He deals first with diction </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(λόξα)</span><span class="font1"> in&nbsp;the proper sense, as concerned with the choice of words and phrases.&nbsp;The first excellence of diction is clearness </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(σaφhveιa),</span><span class="font1"> which is&nbsp;attained by using words in their proper sense </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(κύρια).</span><span class="font1"> Next, the&nbsp;diction must be “neither too low nor too grand, but suitable to the&nbsp;subject.” In prose </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Gv τοls ψιλο7s λόγοα)</span><span class="font1"> there is less scope for&nbsp;ornament than in poetry, though in the latter, too, much depends&nbsp;on the speaker or the theme. And here Aristotle remarks that&nbsp;Euripides was the first poet who produced a happy illusion by taking&nbsp;his words from the language of daily life (e<sup>,</sup>κ </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">τηs eιωθυias διaλtκτου).&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">With a view to adorning prose, and giving it “distinction” (the&nbsp;term which best represents Aristotle’s phrase </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ξtvοv</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ξevικbv ποιtιv),&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">nothing is more important than the judicious use of metaphor.&nbsp;Aristotle admits that “the art of metaphor cannot be taught” ;&nbsp;but he gives some sensible hints on the subject, and on the use of&nbsp;epithets. The poet Simonides, he tells us, when the winner of a&nbsp;mule race offered him a small fee, declined to write an ode on “halfasses,” but, when the price was raised, sang “Hail, daughters of&nbsp;windswift steeds.&quot; Tno perceptions which made the best Greek&nbsp;prose so good are illustrated by Aristotle’s next chapter (iii. 3) on&nbsp;ψυχρά, “frigidities,” “faults of style.” He traces these to four</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
