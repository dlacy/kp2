<p><label>ROCHESTER</label>
John Wilmot, Earl of (1647-1680), born in Oxfordshire in 1647, was one of the un worthies of the reign of the “ merry monarch, scandalous and poor,”</p><p>“ Who never said a foolish thing Nor ever did a wise one.”</p>

<p>Rochester is the author of both these imperishable descriptions of Charles IL, and by them and his poem “ Upon Nothing,” and his death-bed conversation with Bishop Burnet he is now chiefly known. His poetry has hardly had a fair chance against that of his contemporaries, for owing to his scandalous character, which was probably worse than the time only in respect of his ostentatious defiance of proprieties, all kinds of indecencies were fathered upon him and inserted in unauthorized editions of his works. This has ensured his exclusion from decent libraries, an edition issued in 1691 by friends careful of his memory having been pushed out of sight by these more piquant publications. His letters to his wife and his son show that the real man was much better than the public estimate of him, which he invited by his occasional daring breaches of decorum and morality. Some of his lyrics are very pretty, full of ingenious fancy and musical rhythm, but wit and intellect are more marked in his writing than the free flow of lyrical sentiment. For wit, versatility, and intense vitality of intellect this strangely wasted life stood high above the level of its age. In his youth Rochester distinguished himself in the Dutch wars by acts of signal personal bravery ; his alleged cowardice afterwards in street brawls and personal quarrels looks rather like daringly contemptuous cynicism. Rochester had a taste for the humours of low life, and is said to have haunted the low quarters of the town in various disguises, on one occasion personating a mountebank on Tower Hill. He died on 26th July 1680, at the early age of thirty-three, and the common account is that his constitution was undermined and exhausted by profligate excesses.</p>
