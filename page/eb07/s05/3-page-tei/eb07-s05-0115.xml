There are scarcely any estates so large as to create a decided political preponderance, and there is a larger number of proprietors occupying their own lands, of a value of from L.100 to L.400 per annum, than in any other county. Except in the heavy clay districts, the farms are generally large ; and the tenants being possessed of ample capitals, the agricultural business is admirably conducted. There are neither mines nor mineral springs in this county. In the summer season sea-bathing attracts a considerable portion of company to the shore at Lowestoffe, Southwold, and some other spots, where every accommodation for such parties is provided.</p><p>Among the antiquities stand first the remains of the ancient Roman castle at Burgh, on the banks of the Yare. It is said to have been the ancient Garianonum, erected by Publius Ostorius Scapula, in the reign of the emperor Claudius. The walls, which are still standing, enclose a space 612 feet in length and 320 in breadth ; they are fourteen feet in height and nine in thickness. The whole ground plan, including the wall, is more than five acres, and is capable of containing a cohort and a half; having been built to keep in subjection the Sceni, a people inhabiting Suffolk, Norfolk, Huntingdonshire, and Cambridgeshire. The most remarkable of the Saxon antiquities are the monastery at Bury St Edmund’s, that of Framlingham, and several ancient churches.</p><p>The following peers derive their titles from places in this county : Marquis Cornwallis ; Earls of Suffolk, Orford, Euston, and Stradbrooke ; and Barons Rendlesham and Worlingham. The county has been formed into two divisions, the eastern and western, for the purpose of electing members to parliament, each division returning two. The elections for the eastern part arc held at Ipswich ; and the other polling places are Needham, Woodbridge, Framlingham, Saxmundham, Beccles, and Halesworth. The elections for the western part are held at Bury St Edmund’s ; and the other polling places are Wickham Brook, Lavenharn, Stowmarket, Botesdale, Mildenhall, and Hadleigh. By the reform act the boroughs of Dunwich, Alborough, and Orford, which had each returned two members, have been disfranchised ; and Eye, which likewise returned two, now returns only one. Ipswich, Bury St Edmund’s, and Sudbury return two members as before.</p><p>The most remarkable seats among a very great number belonging to noblemen and gentlemen in this county are, Euston Hall, Duke of Grafton; Broom IIall, Sir E. Kerrison ; Ickworth, Marquis of Bristol ; Henham, Lord Stradbrooke ; Worlingham Hall, Lord Gosfordl ; Boston Hall, Sir H. E. Banbury ; Rendlesham, Lord Rendlesham ; Benacre, Sir Thomas Gooch ; Haveningham Hall, Lord Huntingfield ; Sotterly Park, Miles Barm, Esq. ; Flinton Hall, Alexander Adair, Esq. ; Redgrove Hall, Admiral Wilson ; Woolverston Park, Charles Berners, Esq. ; Long Melford, Sir Hyde Parker; Shrubland Park, Sir William Middleton ; and Tendring Hall, Sir Joseph Rowley.@@<hi rend="superscript">1</hi></p><p>SUFFRAGAN, an appellation given to simple bishops with regard to archbishops, ou whom they depend, and to whom appeals lie from the bishops’ courts. The same name is likewise given to a bishop who is occasionally appointed to assist the diocesan.</p><p>SUFFRAGE denotes a vote given in an assembly where something is deliberated on, or where a person is elected to an office or benefice.</p><p>SUGAR, a solid sweet substance, obtained from the juice of the sugar-cane ; or, according to chemists, an essential salt, capable of crystallization, of a sweet and agreeable flavour, and contained in a greater or less quantity in almost every species of vegetables, but most abundant in the sugar-cane.</p><p>As the sugar-cane is the principal production of the West Indies, and the great source of their riches ; as it is so important in a commercial view, from the employment which it gives to seamen, and the wealth which it opens for merchants, and besides is now become a necessary of life ; it may justly be esteemed one of the most valuable plants in the world. From the few remains of the Grecian and Roman authors which have survived the ravages of time, we can find no proofs that the juice of the sugar-cane was known at a very early period. There can however be no doubt, that in those countries where it was indigenous, its value was not long concealed. It is not improbable that it was known to the ancient Jews; for there is some reason to suppose, that the Hebrew word nap. which frequently occurs in the Old Testament, and by our translators is rendered sometimes <hi rend="italic">calamus,</hi> and sometimes <hi rend="italic">sweet cane, </hi>does in fact mean the sugar-cane. The first passage in which we have observed it mentioned is Exodus, xxx. 23, where Moses is commanded to make an ointment with myrrh, cinnamon, kené, and cassia. Now the kené does not appear to have been a native of Egypt, nor of Judea ; for in Jeremiah, vi. 20, it is mentioned as coming from a far country. “ To what purpose cometh there to me incense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far country ?” This is not true of the calamus aromaticus, which grows spontaneously in the Levant, as well as in many parts of Europe. If the cinnamon mentioned in the passage of Exodus quoted above was true cinnamon, it must have come from the East Indies, the only country in the world from which cinnamon is obtained. There is no difficulty therefore in supposing that the sugar-cane was exported from the same country. If any credit be due to etymology, it confirms the opinion that kené denotes the sugar-cane ; for the Latin word <hi rend="italic">canna,</hi> and the English word <hi rend="italic">cane,</hi> are evidently derived from it. It is also a curious fact, that שנך <hi rend="italic">sachaτ</hi> or <hi rend="italic">slicker,</hi> in Hebrew signifies <hi rend="italic">inebriation,</hi> from which the Greek w ord <hi rend="italic">σάχχαϑ</hi> or <hi rend="italic">σαχχάϑιοv sugar,</hi> is undoubtedly to be traced.</p><p>The sugar-cane was first made known to the western parts of the world by the conquests of Alexander the Great. Strabo (lib. xv.) relates that Nearchus, his admiral, found it in the East Indies in the year 325 before Christ. It is evidently alluded to in a fragment of Theophrastus, preserved in Photius. Varro, who lived <hi rend="smallcaps">a.</hi> c. 68, describes it in a fragment quoted by Isidorus,@@<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> as a fluid pressed from reeds of a large size, which was sweeter than honey.@@<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> Dioscorides, about the year 35 before Christ, says "that there is a kind of honey called <hi rend="italic">saccharon,</hi> which is found in India and Arabia Felix. It has the appearance of salt, and is brittle when chewed. If dissolved in water, it is beneficial to the bowels, and stomachic; is useful in diseases of the bladder and kidneys ; and when sprinkled on the eye, removes those substances that obscure the sight." This is the first account we have of its medicinal qualities. Galen often prescribed it as a medicine. Lucan (lib. iii. v. 237) relates, that an oriental nation in alliance wills Pompey used the juice of the cane as a common drink.</p><p>Quique bibunt tenera dulces ab arundine succos.</p><p>Pliny says it was produced in Arabia and India, but that the best came from the latter country. It is also mentioned by Arrian, in his Periplus of the Red Sea, by the name of <hi rend="italic">σάχχαϑι (sacchari),</hi> as an article of commerce from India to the Red Sea.
