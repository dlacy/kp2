<p><span class="font1">ancient aristocracy of Rome, gave it a special character and left it at the mercy of the people. Then the popes, by the&nbsp;bestowal of lucrative offices, rich benefices and vast estates,&nbsp;and, above all, by raising many nobles to the purple, introduced&nbsp;new blood into the Roman aristocracy, and endued it with&nbsp;increasing strength and vitality. Always divided, always&nbsp;turbulent, this irrepressible body was a continual source of&nbsp;discord and civil war, of permanent confusion and turmoil.&nbsp;Amidst all these difficulties the commune struggled on, but never&nbsp;succeeded in preserving a regular course or administration for&nbsp;long. What with continual warfare, attacks on the Capitol&nbsp;and consequent slaughter, pillage and incendiarism, it is no&nbsp;wonder that so few original documents are left to illustrate the&nbsp;history of the Roman Republic. Nor have chroniclers and historians done much to supply this want, since, in treating of&nbsp;Roman affairs, their attention is mainly devoted to the pope&nbsp;and the emperor. Nevertheless, we will attempt to connect&nbsp;in due order all the facts gleaned from former writers and published records.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The removal of the seat of the empire to Constantinople effected a radical change in the political situation of Rome;&nbsp;nor was this change neutralized by the formation of the weak&nbsp;Western empire soon to be shattered by the Germanic invasions.&nbsp;But we still find Roman laws and institutions; and no sign&nbsp;is yet manifest of the rise of a medieval municipality. The&nbsp;earliest germ of this new type of municipality is seen during&nbsp;the barbarian invasions. Of these we need only enumerate the&nbsp;four most important—those of the Goths, Byzantines (who,&nbsp;however, were not mere barbarians but civilized and corrupt),&nbsp;Lombards and Franks. The Gothic rule merely superimposed&nbsp;upon the Roman social order a Teutonic stratum, that never&nbsp;penetrated beneath its surface. The Goths always&nbsp;remained a conquering army; according to the&nbsp;German custom, they took possession of one-third of&nbsp;the vanquished territory, but, while forbidding the Romans&nbsp;to bear arms, left their local administration intact. The senate,&nbsp;the curiae, the principal magistrates, both provincial and&nbsp;municipal, the prefect of the city, and the Roman judges&nbsp;enforcing the enactments of the Roman law, were all preserved.&nbsp;Already, under the empire, the civil power had been separated&nbsp;from the military, and this separation was maintained. Hence&nbsp;there was no visible change in the constitution of the state.&nbsp;Only, now there were conquered and conquerors. All real and&nbsp;effective power was on the side of brute force, and the Goths&nbsp;alone bore arms. In every province they had their </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">comites,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">or heads of the army, who had judicial power over their countrymen, especially in criminal cases. Here, then, was a combination of civil and military jurisdiction altogether contrary to&nbsp;Roman ideas. Nor can it be denied that the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">comiles,</span><span class="font1"> as chiefs&nbsp;of the armed force, necessarily exerted a direct or indirect&nbsp;influence on the civil and administrative power of the provinces,&nbsp;and especially upon the collection of the imposts. The civil&nbsp;arm, being virtually subordinate to the military, suffered unavoidable change. Notwithstanding the praise lavished on&nbsp;Theodoric, the kingdom founded by him in Italy had no solid&nbsp;basis. It was composed of two nations differing in race and&nbsp;traditions and even in religion, since the Goths were Arians and&nbsp;the Romans Catholics. The latter were sunk in degeneracy&nbsp;and corruption; their institutions were old and decrepit. It&nbsp;was necessary to infuse new life into the worn-out body. This&nbsp;was difficult, perhaps impossible; and at any rate Theodoric&nbsp;never attempted the task. Little wonder then if the Gothic&nbsp;kingdom succumbed to the Byzantine armies from Constanti</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">nople.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The wars of Bclisarius and Narses against the Goths lasted twenty years (535-55 </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.),</span><span class="font1"> caused terrible slaughter and&nbsp;devastation in Italy, and finally subjected her to&nbsp;Constantinople. In place of a Gothic king she was&nbsp;now ruled by a Greek patrician, afterwards entitled&nbsp;the exarch, who had his seat of government at Ravenna&nbsp;as lieutenant of the empire. In the chief provincial&nbsp;cities the ruling counts were replaced by dukes, subordinate to the exarch; and the smaller towns were governed&nbsp;by military tribunes. Instead of dukes, we sometimes find&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">magistri militum,</span><span class="font1"> apparently of higher rank. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">praefcctus&nbsp;praetorio</span><span class="font1"> of Italy, likewise a dependent of the exarch, was at&nbsp;the head of the civil administration. The pragmatic sanction&nbsp;(554), promulgating the Justinian code, again separated the&nbsp;civil from the military power, which was no longer allowed to&nbsp;intervene in the settlement of private disputes, and, by conferring&nbsp;on the bishops the superintendence of and authority over the&nbsp;provincial and municipal government, soon led to the increase&nbsp;of the power of the church, which had already considerable&nbsp;influence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The new organization outwardly resembled that of the Goths: one army had been replaced by another, the counts by dukes;&nbsp;there was an exarch instead of a king; the civil and military&nbsp;jurisdictions were more exactly defined. But the army was&nbsp;not, like that of the Goths, a conquering nation in arms; it was&nbsp;a Graeco-Roman army, and did not hold a third of the territory&nbsp;which was now probably added to the possessions of the state&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{fisc}.</span><span class="font1"> The soldiery took its pay from Constantinople, whence&nbsp;all instructions and appointments of superior officers likewise&nbsp;proceeded. In Rome we find a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">magister militum</span><span class="font1"> at the head of&nbsp;the troops. The Roman senate still existed, but was reduced&nbsp;to a shadow. Theodoric had left it intact until he suspected it&nbsp;of hostile designs and dealings with the Byzantines, but then&nbsp;began to persecute it, as was proved by the wretched fate of&nbsp;Boetius and Symmachus. Nevertheless the senate survived,&nbsp;added the functions of a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">curia</span><span class="font1"> or municipal council to those of&nbsp;a governmental assembly, and took part -in the election of&nbsp;the pope—already one of the chief affairs of Rome. So many&nbsp;senators, however, were slaughtered during the Byzantine War&nbsp;that it was commonly believed to be extinct. The pragmatic&nbsp;sanction, conferring on senate and pope the superintendence of&nbsp;weights and measures in Italy, might seem a convincing proof to&nbsp;the contrary, although, in the general chaos, now that Rome&nbsp;was a mere provincial city, constantly exposed to attack, we&nbsp;may imagine to what the senate was reduced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">All Roman institutions were altered and decayed; but their original features were still to be traced, and no heterogeneous&nbsp;element had been introduced into them. The first dawn of a&nbsp;completely new epoch can only be dated from the invasion of&nbsp;the Lombards (568-72). Their conquest of a large&nbsp;portion of Italy was accompanied by the harshest&nbsp;oppression. They abolished all ancient laws and&nbsp;institutions, and not only seized a third of the land,&nbsp;but reduced the inhabitants almost to slavery. But, in the&nbsp;unsubdued parts of the country—namely, in Ravenna, Rome&nbsp;and the maritime cities—a very different state of things prevailed. The necessity for self-defence and the distance of the&nbsp;empire, now too worn out to render any assistance, compelled&nbsp;the inhabitants to depend solely on their own strength. Thus,&nbsp;certain maritime cities, such as Naples, Amalfi, Pisa and Venice,&nbsp;soon attained to a greater or less degree of liberty and independence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This is the moment in which ancient society seems to disappear completely and a new one begins to rise. Ancient customs&nbsp;disappear, Christian processions take the place of the ancient&nbsp;games, ancient temples are transformed into churches and&nbsp;dedicated to new saints. If Roman tradition in Italy can ever&nbsp;be said to have been completely broken, this could only be&nbsp;during the Longobard domination. It is certain, however, that&nbsp;soon the elements of ancient culture began to revive once more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A special state of things now arose in Rome. We behold the rapid growth of the papal power and the continual increase&nbsp;of its moral and political influence. This had already&nbsp;begun under Leo I., and been further promoted by the&nbsp;pragmatic sanction. Not only the superintendence&nbsp;but often the nomination of public functionaries and judges was&nbsp;now in the hands of the popes. And the accession to St Peter’s&nbsp;chair of a man of real genius in the person of Gregory I.,&nbsp;surnamed the Great, marked the beginning of a new&nbsp;era. By force of individual character, as well as by historic</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
