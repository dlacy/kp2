<p><span class="font0">considerable influence in his circle. David was destined ' for the same line of business as his father ; and received,&nbsp;partly in England, and partly at a school in Holland, where&nbsp;he resided two years, such an education as is usually given&nbsp;to young men intended for the mercantile profession. Classical learning formed no part of his early instruction. He&nbsp;began to be confidentially employed by his father, in the&nbsp;business of the Stock Exchange, when he was only fourteen&nbsp;years of age. Neither then, however, nor at any subsequent period, was he wholly engrossed by the combinations&nbsp;and details of his arduous and difficult profession. From&nbsp;his earliest years he evinced a taste for abstract and general&nbsp;reasoning ; and manifested that determination to probe&nbsp;every subject of interest to the bottom, and to form bis&nbsp;opinion upon it according to the unbiassed conviction of his&nbsp;mind, which was always one of the distinguishing features&nbsp;of his character.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Mr Ricardo’s freedom and independence of mind did not accord with the prejudices of his father, who had been accustomed to subscribe, without investigation, to the opinions&nbsp;of his ancestors, on all questions connected with religion&nbsp;and politics, and who was desirous that his children should&nbsp;do the same. But this system of passive obedience, and&nbsp;blind submission to the dictates of authority, was quite repugnant to the principles of young Ricardo, who, at the same&nbsp;time that he never failed to testify the sincerest affection&nbsp;and respect for his father, found reason to differ from him&nbsp;on many important points, and to become a convert to the&nbsp;Christian faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Not long after this event, and shortly after he attained the age of majority, Mr Ricardo formed a union, productive of unalloyed domestic happiness, with Miss Wilkinson.&nbsp;Having, in consequence of this conduct, been entirely separated from his father, he was thrown wholly on his ow<sup>r</sup>n&nbsp;resources, and commenced business for himself. At this&nbsp;important epoch of his history, the oldest and most respectable members of the Stock Exchange gave a striking proof&nbsp;of the esteem entertained by them for his talents and the&nbsp;integrity of his character, by voluntarily coming forward to&nbsp;support and assist him in his undertakings. His success&nbsp;exceeded the most sanguine expectations of his friends, and&nbsp;in a few years he realized an ample fortune.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ The talent for obtaining wealth,” says a near relation of Mr Ricardo’s, from whose interesting account of his life we&nbsp;have borrowed these particulars, “ is not held in much estimation ; but perhaps in nothing did Mr Ricardo more evince&nbsp;his extraordinary powers, than he did in his business. His&nbsp;complete knowledge of all its intricacies; his surprising&nbsp;quickness at figures and calculation ; his capability of getting through, without any apparent exertion, the immense&nbsp;transactions in which he was concerned ; his coolness and&nbsp;judgment, combined certainly with (for him) a fortunate&nbsp;tissue of public events, enabled him to leave all his contemporaries at the Stock Exchange far behind, and to raise&nbsp;himself infinitely higher, not only in fortune, but in general&nbsp;character and estimation, than any man had ever done before in that house. Such was the impression which these&nbsp;qualities had made on his competitors, that several of the&nbsp;most discerning among them, long before he had emerged&nbsp;into public notoriety, prognosticated, in their admiration,&nbsp;that he would live to fill some of the highest stations in the&nbsp;state.” @@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0">According as his solicitude about his success in life declined, Mr Ricardo began to devote a greater portion of his time to scientific and literary pursuits. When about&nbsp;twenty-five years of age, he began to study some branches&nbsp;of mathematical science, and made considerable progress in&nbsp;chemistry and mineralogy. He fitted up a laboratory,&nbsp;formed a collection of minerals, and was one of the original&nbsp;members of the Geological Society. It is known, however,&nbsp;that he never entered warmly into the investigation of these&nbsp;sciences. Thcy were not adapted to the peculiar cast of&nbsp;his mind ; and he abandoned them entirely, as soon as his&nbsp;attention was directed to the more congenial study of political economy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Mr Ricardo is stated to have first become acquainted with the “Wealth of Nations” in 1799, while on a visit to Bath,&nbsp;where he had accompanied Mrs Ricardo for the benefit of&nbsp;her health. He was highly gratified by its perusal ; and it&nbsp;is most probable that the inquiries about which it is conversant continued henceforth to occupy a considerable share&nbsp;of his attention, though it was not till a later period that he&nbsp;became so exclusively occupied with their study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Mr Ricardo first came before the public as an author in 1809. The rise in the market-price of bullion, and the fall&nbsp;of the exchange that had taken place that year, had excited a good deal of attention. Mr Ricardo applied himself to&nbsp;the consideration of the subject; and the studies in which he&nbsp;had been latterly engaged, combined with the experience&nbsp;which he had derived from the vast extent of his moneyed&nbsp;transactions, enabled him not only to perceive the true&nbsp;cause of the phenomena in question, but to trace and exhibit its practical bearing and real effect. When Mr Ricardo&nbsp;began this investigation, he had no intention of laying the&nbsp;result of his researches before the public. But having&nbsp;shown his manuscript to Mr Perry, then proprietor and editor of the Morning Chronicle, he was prevailed upon by&nbsp;him, though not without considerable difficulty, to consent&nbsp;to its publication, in the shape of letters, in that journal.&nbsp;The first of these letters appeared on the 6th of September,&nbsp;1809. They made a considerable impression, and elicited&nbsp;various answers. This success, and the increasing interest&nbsp;of the subject, induced Mr Ricardo to commit his opinions&nbsp;upon it to the judgment of the public, in a more enlarged&nbsp;and systematic form, in the celebrated tract entitled “ The&nbsp;High Price of Bullion a Proof of the Depreciation of Bank&nbsp;Notes.” This tract led the way in the far-famed bullion&nbsp;controversy. It issued from the press several months previously to the appointment of the bullion committee ; and&nbsp;is believed to have had no inconsiderable effect in forwarding that important measure. In this tract Mr Ricardo&nbsp;showed that redundancy and deficiency of currency are&nbsp;only </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">relative</span><span class="font0"> terms ; and that so long as the currency of a&nbsp;particular country consists exclusively of gold and silver&nbsp;coins, or of paper convertible into them, it is impossible&nbsp;that its value should either rise above or fall below the&nbsp;value of the currencies of other countries, by a greater sum&nbsp;than will suffice to defray the expense of importing foreign&nbsp;coin or bullion if the currency be deficient, or of exporting a portion of the existing supply if it be redundant.&nbsp;But when a country issues an inconvertible paper-money,&nbsp;as was then the case with England, it cannot be exported&nbsp;to other countries in the event of its becoming relatively&nbsp;redundant at home ; and whenever, therefore, the exchange&nbsp;with foreign states is depressed below, or the price of bullion rises above, its mint price, more than the expense of&nbsp;sending coins abroad, it is a conclusive proof that too much&nbsp;paper has been issued, and that its value is </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">depreciated from&nbsp;excess.</span><span class="font0"> The principles which pervade the Report of the&nbsp;bullion committee are substantially the same with those&nbsp;which pervade Mr Ricardo’s pamphlet ; but the more comprehensive and popular manner in which they are illustrated in the Report, and their being recommended by a&nbsp;committee composed of some of the ablest members of the&nbsp;House of Commons, gave them a weight and authority&nbsp;which they could not otherwise have obtained. And though</span></p><div>
