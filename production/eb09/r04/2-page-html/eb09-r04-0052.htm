The gradual break up of tho military republic of these&nbsp;sturdy freebooters has already been described.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The foundation of the Little Russian literature (written, as opposed to tho oral) was laid by Ivan Kotliarevski (1769-1838),&nbsp;whose travesty of part of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Æneid</span><span class="font0"> enjoys great popularity among&nbsp;some of his countrymen. Others, however, object to it as tending&nbsp;to bring the language or dialect into ridicule. A truly national&nbsp;poet appeared in Taras Shevchenko, born at the village of Kirilovka&nbsp;in the government of Kieff, in the condition of a serf. The strange&nbsp;adventures of his early life he has told us in his autobiography.&nbsp;He did not get his freedom till some time after he had reached&nbsp;manhood, when he was purchased from his master by the generous efforts of the poet Zhukovski and others. Besides poetry,&nbsp;he occupied himself with painting with considerable success. He&nbsp;unfortunately became obnoxious to the Government, and was&nbsp;punished with exile to Siberia from 1847 to 1857. He did not&nbsp;long survive his return, dying in 1861, aged forty-six. No one&nbsp;has described with greater vigour than Shevchenko the old days of&nbsp;the Ukraine. In his youth he listened to the village traditions&nbsp;handed down by the priests, and he has faithfully reproduced&nbsp;them. The old times of Nalivaiko, Doroshenko, and others live&nbsp;over again. Like Gogol he is too fond of describing scenes of&nbsp;bloodshed. In the powerful poem entitled </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Haidamak</span><span class="font0"> we have a&nbsp;graphic picture of tho horrors enacted by Gonta and his followers&nbsp;at Uman. The sketches are almost too realistic. Like Burns&nbsp;with the old Scottish songs, so Shevchenko has reproduced&nbsp;admirably the spirit of the lays of the Ukraine. All those familiar&nbsp;with his works will remember the charming little lyrics with which&nbsp;they are interspersed. The funeral of the poet was a vast public&nbsp;procession ; a great cairn, surmounted with a cross, was raised&nbsp;over his remains, where he lies buried near Kanioff on tho banks&nbsp;of tho Dnieper. His grave has been styled the “ Mecca of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">South Russian Revolutionists.” He is the great national poet of the Southern Russians. A complete edition of his works, with&nbsp;interesting biographical notices—one contributed by the novelist&nbsp;Turgenieff—appeared at Prague in 1876. Besides the national&nbsp;songs, excellent collections of the South Russian folk-tales have&nbsp;appeared, edited by Dragomanoff, Rudchenko, and others. Many of&nbsp;these are still recited by the “ tchumaki” or wandering pedlars. A&nbsp;valuable work is the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Zapiski o Yuzhuoi Rossii</span><span class="font0"> (“Papers on Southern&nbsp;Russia”), published at St Petersburg in 1857 by Panteleimon Kulish.&nbsp;After he got into trouble (with Kostomaroff and Shevchenko) for&nbsp;his political views, the late works of this author show him to&nbsp;have undergone a complete change. Other writers using the Little&nbsp;Russian language are Marko-Vovchok (that is, Madame Eugenia&nbsp;JIarkovich), and Yuri Fedkovieh, who employs a dialect of Buko-vina. Fedkovich, like Shevchenko, sprang from a peasant family,&nbsp;and served as a soldier in the Austrian army against the French&nbsp;during the Italian campaign. Naturally we find his poems filled&nbsp;with descriptions of life in the camp. Like the Croat Preradovid,&nbsp;ho began writing poetry in the German language, till he was turned&nbsp;into more natural paths by some patriotic friends. A collection&nbsp;of songs of Bukovina was published at Kieff in 1875 by Lona-chevski. At the present time Eugene Zelechowski continues his&nbsp;valuable </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dictionary of Little Russian,</span><span class="font0"> of which about one half has&nbsp;appeared. This promises to be a very useful book, for up to the&nbsp;present time students have been obliged to rest satisfied with&nbsp;the scanty publications of Levchenko, Piskunoff, and Verchratzki.&nbsp;There is a good grammar by Osadtza, a pupil of Miklosich.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the White Russian dialect are to be found only a few songs, with the exception of portions of the Scriptures and some legal&nbsp;documents. A valuablo dictionary was published a short time ago&nbsp;by Nosovich, but this is one of the most neglected of the Russian&nbsp;dialects, as the part in which it is spoken is one of the dreariest&nbsp;of the empire. Collections of White Russian songs have been&nbsp;published by Sheiu and others. For details regarding this and the&nbsp;other Russian dialects see Slavs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(W. R. M.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RUSTCHUK (RusCuk), a city of Bulgaria, Turkey in Europe, on the south bank of the Danube, opposite&nbsp;Giurgevo, at the point where the river receives the waters&nbsp;of the Lorn, a fine stream from the northern slopes of the&nbsp;Balkans. Since 1867 it has been connected by rail (139&nbsp;miles) with Varna. The town was nearly destroyed by the&nbsp;Russian bombardment from Giurgevo in 1877, and the&nbsp;military works have since been dismantled in terms of the&nbsp;treaty of Berlin. Its position on the river frontier of&nbsp;Turkey long made it a place of strategic importance.&nbsp;In 1871 the population was about 23,000 (10,800 Turks,&nbsp;7700 Bulgarians, 1000 Jews, 800 Armenians, 500 Gipsies,&nbsp;800 Wallachians and Serbs, 400 Western Europeans), and&nbsp;in 1881 it was returned as 26,163.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the time of the Romans Rustchuk was one of the fortified points along the line of the Danube. In the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Tabula Peutingemana&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">it appears as Prisca, in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Antonine Itinerary</span><span class="font0"> as Serantaprista, in&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Notitia</span><span class="font0"> as Seragintaprista, and in Ptolemy as Priste Polis.&nbsp;Destroyed by the barbarian invasion, the town recovered its&nbsp;importance only in comparatively modem times. In 1810 it was&nbsp;captured by the Russians, and on his departure next year Kutusoff&nbsp;destroyed tho fortifications. In 1828-29 and again in 1853-54 it&nbsp;played a part in the Russo-Turkish War, and in 1877, as already&nbsp;mentioned, it was nearly destroyed.</span></p>
