<p><span class="font0">depoſitions of the Po and other rivers muſt raiſe the ground; and yet the rivers muſt ſtill flow overall. We&nbsp;muſt conclude that the ſurface of the Adriatic is by no&nbsp;means level, and that it ſlopes like a river from the Lagoons of Venice to the eaſtward. In all probability it&nbsp;even ſlopes conſiderably outwards from the ſhore. This&nbsp;will not hinder the alternations of ebb and flow tide, as&nbsp;will be ſhown in its proper place. The whole ſhores&nbsp;of this gulph exhibit moſt uncommon appearances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The laſt general obſervations which we ſhall make in this place is, that the ſurface of a river is not flat, conſidered athwart the ſtream, but convex : this is owing&nbsp;to its motion. Suppoſe a canal of ſtagnant water ; its&nbsp;ſurface would be a perfect level. But ſuppoſe it poſſible by any means to give the middle waters a motion&nbsp;in the direction of its length, they muſt drag along&nbsp;with them the waters immediately contiguous. Theſe&nbsp;will move leſs ſwiftly, and will in like manner drag the&nbsp;waters without them ; and thus the water at the ſides&nbsp;being abſtracted, the depth muſt be leſs, and the general ſurface muſt be convex acroſs. The fact in a running ſtream is ſimilar to this ; the ſide waters are withheld by the ſides, and every filament is moving more&nbsp;ſlowly than the one next it towards the middle of the&nbsp;river, but falter than the adjoining filament on the land&nbsp;ſide. This alone muſt produce a convexity of ſurface.&nbsp;But beſides this, it is demonſtrable that the preſſure of&nbsp;a running ſtream is diminiſhed by its motion, and the&nbsp;diminution is proportional to the height which would&nbsp;produce the velocity with which it is gliding paſt the&nbsp;adjoining filament. This convexity muſt in all caſes be&nbsp;very ſmall. Few rivers have the .velocity nearly equal&nbsp;to eight feet </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">per</span><span class="font0"> ſecond, and this requires a height of&nbsp;one foot only. An author quoted by Mr Buffon ſays,&nbsp;that he has obſerved on the river Aveiron an elevation&nbsp;of three feet in the middle during floods; but we ſuſpect&nbsp;ſome error in the obſervation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">§ 4. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Of the Windings of Rivers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rivers are ſeldom ſtraight in their courſe. Formed by the hand of nature, they are accommodated to every&nbsp;change of circumſtance. They wind around what they&nbsp;cannot get over., and work their way to either ſide according as the reſiſtance of the oppoſite bank makes a&nbsp;ſtraight courſe more difficult ; and this ſeemingly fortuitous rambling diſtributes them more uniformly over the&nbsp;ſurface of a country, and makes them every where more&nbsp;at hand, to receive the numberleſs rills and rivulets&nbsp;which collect the waters of our ſprings and the ſuper-fluities of our ſhowers, and to comfort our habitations&nbsp;with the many advantages which cultivation and ſociety&nbsp;can derive ſrom their preſence. In their feeble beginnings the ſmalleſt inequality of ſlope or conſiſtency is&nbsp;enough to turn them aſide and make them ramble&nbsp;through every field, giving drink to our herds and fertility to our ſoil. The more we follow nature into.the&nbsp;minutiæ of her operations, the more muſt we admire&nbsp;the inexhauſtible fertility of her reſources, and the ſim-ρlicity of the means by which ſhe produces the moſt&nbsp;important and beneficial effects. By thus twiſting the&nbsp;courſe of our rivers into 10,coo ſhapes, ſhe keeps them&nbsp;long amidſt our fields, and thus compenſates for the declivity of the ſurface, which' otherwiſe would tumble&nbsp;them with great rapidity into the ocean, loaded with&nbsp;the beſt and richeſt of our ſoil. Without this, the</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">ſhowers of heaven would have little influence in ſupply-ing the waſte of inceſſant evaporation. But as things are, the rains are kept ſlowly trickling along the ſlo-ping ſides of our hills and ſteeps, winding round every&nbsp;clod, nay every plant, which lengthens their courſe, diminiſhes their Hope, checks their ſpeed, and thus prevents them from quickly bruſhing off from every part&nbsp;of the ſurface the lighteſt and beſt of the ſoil. The&nbsp;flatteſt of our holm lands would be too ſteep, and the&nbsp;rivers would ſhoot along through our ſineſt meadows,&nbsp;hurrying every thing away with them, and would be&nbsp;unfit for the purpofes of inland conveyance, if the inequalities of ſoil did not make them change this headlong&nbsp;courſe for the more beautiful meanders which we obſerve in the courſe of the ſmall rivers winding through&nbsp;our meadows. Thoſe rivers are in general the ſtraight-eſt in their courſe which are the moſt rapid, and which&nbsp;roll along the greateſt bodies of water ; ſuch are the&nbsp;Rhone, the Po, the Danube. The ſmaller rivers continue more devious in their progreſs, till they approach&nbsp;the ſea, and have gathered ſtrength from all their tributary ſtreams.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Every thing aims at an equilibrium, and this directs even the ramblings of rivers. It is of importance to&nbsp;underſtand the relation between the force of a river and&nbsp;the reſiſtance which the ſoil oppoſes to thoſe deviations&nbsp;from a rectilineal courſe ; for it may frequently happen&nbsp;that the general procedure of nature may be inconſiſtent&nbsp;with our local purpoſes. Man was ſet down on thia&nbsp;globe, and the taſlc of cultivating it was given him&nbsp;by nature, and his chief enjoyment ſeems to be to&nbsp;ſtruggle with the elements. He muſt not find things&nbsp;to his mind, but he muſt mould them to his own fancy.&nbsp;Yet even this ſeeming anomaly is one of nature’s moſt&nbsp;beneficent laws; and his exertions muſt ſtill be made&nbsp;in conformity with the general train of the operations&nbsp;of mechanical nature : and when we have any work&nbsp;to undertake relative to the courſe of rivers, we muſt&nbsp;be careful not to thw<sup>τ</sup>art their general rules, otherwiſe&nbsp;we ſhall be ſooner or later puniſhed for their infraction. Things will be brought back to tſheir former&nbsp;ſtate, if our operations are inconſiſtent with that equilibrium which is conſtantly aimed at, or ſome new ſtate&nbsp;of things which is equivalent will be ſoon induced.-If a well regulated river has been improperly deepen&nbsp;ed in ſome place, to anſwer ſome particular purpoſe&nbsp;of our own, or if its breadth has been improperly augmented, we ſhall ſoon ſee a depoſition of mud or fand&nbsp;choak up our ſancied improvements ; becauſe, as we&nbsp;have enlarged the ſection without increaſing the ſlope&nbsp;or the ſupply, the velocity muſt diminiſh, and floating&nbsp;matters muſt be depoſited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is true, we frequently fee permanent channels where the forms are extremely different from that&nbsp;which the waters would dig for themſelves in an uniform ſoil, and which approaches a good deal to the&nbsp;trapezium deſcribed formerly. We ſee a greater breadth&nbsp;frequently compenſate for a want of depth ; but all ſuch&nbsp;deviations are a ſort of conſtraint, or rather are indications of inequality of foil. Such irregular forms are&nbsp;the wOrks of nature ; and if they are permanent, the&nbsp;equilibrium is obtained. Commonly the bottom is&nbsp;harder than the ſides, conſiſting of the coarſeſt of the&nbsp;fand and of gravel; and therefore the neceſſary ſection&nbsp;can be obtained only by increaſing the width.
