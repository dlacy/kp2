<p><span class="font0">powerful a protector, not only conducted him home, but watched by turns all night at his door. Next&nbsp;morning by break of day, Gracchus having aſſembled his friends, led them from his houſe, and poſted&nbsp;one half oi them in the'comitium, while he went up&nbsp;himſelf with the other to the capitol. As ſoon as he&nbsp;appeared, the people ſaluted him with loud acclamations of joy.- But ſcarce was he placed in his tribunal,&nbsp;when Fulvius Flaccus a ſenator, and friend to Gracchus, breaking through the crowd, came up to him,&nbsp;and gave him notice, that the ſenators, who were aſſembled in the temple of Faith, which almoſt touched&nbsp;that of Jupiter Capitolinus, had conſpired againſt his&nbsp;liſe, and were reſolved to attack him openly on his&nbsp;very tribunal. Hereupon Gracchus tucked up his&nbsp;robe, as it were, to prepare for a battle ; and, after&nbsp;his example, ſome of his party, ſeizing the ſtaves of&nbsp;the apparitors, prepared to defend themſelves, and to&nbsp;repel force by force. Theſe preparations terrified the&nbsp;other tribunes ; who immediately abandoned their&nbsp;places in a cowardly manner, and mixed with the&nbsp;crowd ; while the prieſts ran to ſhut the gates of the&nbsp;temple, for fear of its being profaned. On the other&nbsp;hand, the fi iends of Gracchus, who were diſperſed by&nbsp;parties in different places, cried out, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">11'e are ready :&nbsp;IVhat mu ft we do ?</span><span class="font0"> Gracchus, whoſe voice could not&nbsp;be heard by all his adherents on account of the tumult, the clamours, and the confuſed cries of the different parties, put his hand to his head ; which was&nbsp;the ſignal agreed on to prepare for battle. But ſome&nbsp;of his enemies, putting a malicious conſtruction upon&nbsp;that geſture, immediately flew to. the ſenate, and told&nbsp;the fathers, that the ſeditious tribune had called for&nbsp;the crown to be put upon his head. Hereupon the&nbsp;ſenators, fancying they already ſaw the king oi Perga-mus’s diadem on the tribune’s head, and the royal&nbsp;mantle on his ſhoulders, reſolved to give the conſul&nbsp;leave to arm his legions, treat the friends of Gracchus&nbsp;as enemies, and turn the comitium into a field of&nbsp;battle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But the conſul Mutius Scævola, who was a prudent-and moderate man, refuſed to be the inſtrument of their raſh revenge, and to diſhonour his contulate&nbsp;with the maſſacre of a diſarmed people. As Calpur-r.ius Piſo, the other conſul, was then in Sicily, the&nbsp;moſt turbulent among the ſenators cried out, “ Since&nbsp;one of our conſuls is abſent, and the other betrays&nbsp;the republic, let us do ourſelves juſtice ; let us immediately go and demoliſh with our own bands this idol&nbsp;of the people.” Scipio Naſica, who had been all&nbsp;along ſor violent meaſures, inveighed bitterly againſt&nbsp;the conſul for refuſing to ſuccour the republic in her&nbsp;greateſt diſtreſs. Scipio Naſica was the great grandſon of Cneius Scipio, the uncle of the firſt Africanus,&nbsp;and conſequently couſin to the Gracchi by their mother Cornelia. But nevertheleſs not one of the ſenators&nbsp;betrayed a more irreconcileable hatred againſt the tribune than he. When the prudent conſul refuſed to arm&nbsp;his legions, and put the adherents of Gracchus to death&nbsp;contrary to the uſual forms of juſtice, he ſet no bounds&nbsp;to his fury, but, riſing up from his place, cried out like&nbsp;a madman, “ Since our conſul betrays us, let thoſe who&nbsp;love the republic follow me.” Having uttered theſe&nbsp;words, he immediately walked out of the temple, attended by a great number of ſenators.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Naſica threw his robe over his ſhoulders, and having covered his head with it, advanced with his followers&nbsp;into the crowd, where he was joined by a company of&nbsp;the clients and friends of the patricians, armed with&nbsp;ſtaves and clubs. Theſe, falling indifferently upon all&nbsp;who ſtood in their way, diſperſed the crowd. Many of&nbsp;Gracchus’s party took to their heels ; and in that tumult all the feats being overturned and broken, Naſica,&nbsp;armed with the leg of a broken bench, knocked down&nbsp;all who oppoſed him, and at length reached Gracchus.&nbsp;One of his party ſeized the tribune by the lappet of his&nbsp;robe : but he, quitting his gown, fled in his tunic ; and&nbsp;as he was in that hurry of ſpirits, which is inſeparabie&nbsp;ſrom ſear, leaping over the broken benches, he had the&nbsp;misfortune to flip and fall. As he was getting up again,&nbsp;he received a blow on the head, which ſtunned him :&nbsp;then his adverſaries ruſhing in upon him, with repeated&nbsp;blows put an end to his life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rome was by his death delivered, according to Cicero, from a domeſtic enemy, who was more formidable to lier than even, that Numantia, which had firſt kindled&nbsp;his reſentments. Perhaps no man was ever born with&nbsp;greater talents, or more capable of aggrandizing himſelf, and doing honour to his country. But his great&nbsp;mind, his manly courage, his lively, eaſy, and powerful eloquence, were, ſays Cicero, like a ſword in the&nbsp;hands of a madman. Gracchus ab uſed them, not in&nbsp;ſupporting an unjuſt cauſe, but in conducting a good&nbsp;one with too much violence. He went ſo far as to&nbsp;make ſome believe that he had really ſomething in view beſides the intereſt of the people whom he pre-·&nbsp;tended to relieve; and therefore ſome hiſtorians have,&nbsp;repreſented him as a tyrant. But the moſt judicious,&nbsp;writers clear him from this imputation, and aſeribe his&nbsp;firſt deſign of reviving, the Licinian law to an eager deſire of being revenged on the ſenators for the affront&nbsp;they had very unjuſtly put upon him, and the conſul&nbsp;Mancinus, as we have hinted above. The law he attempted to revive had an air of juſtice, which gave a&nbsp;fonction to his revenge, without calling any blemiſh on&nbsp;his reputation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The death of Gracchus did not pul an end to the tumult. Above 300 of the tribune’s friends loſt their lives in the fray ; and their bodies were thrown, with&nbsp;that of Gracchus, into the Tiber. Nay, the ſenate&nbsp;carried their revenge beyond the fatal day which had&nbsp;ſtained the Capitol with Roman blood. They ſought&nbsp;for all the friends of the late tribune, and without any&nbsp;form of law aſſaſſinated ſome, and forced others into,&nbsp;baniſhment. Caius Billiua, one of the moſt zealous defenders of the people, was ſeized by his enemies, and&nbsp;ſhut up in a caſk with ſnakes and vipers, where he mi-ſerably periſhed. Though the laws prohibited any citizen to take away the life of another before he had&nbsp;been legally condemned, Naſica and his followers were&nbsp;acquitted by the ſenate, who enacted a decree, juſtify-ing all the cruelties committed againſt Gracchus and&nbsp;his adherents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Theſe diſturbances were for a ſhort time interrupted by </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font0">revolt of the ſlaves in Sicily, occaſioned by the&nbsp;cruelty of their maſters ; but they being ſoon reduced,&nbsp;the conteſts about the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sempronian law,</span><span class="font0"> as it was called,&nbsp;again took place.
