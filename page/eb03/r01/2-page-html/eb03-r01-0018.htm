<p><span class="font0">The difference between raiſins dried in the fun and </span><span class="font1">thoſc dried in ovens, is very obvious : the former are&nbsp;ſweat and pleaſant, but the latter have a latent acidity&nbsp;with the ſweetneſs that renders them much leſs agreeable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The cpmmon way of drying grapes for raiſins, is to tie two or three bunches of them together while yet on&nbsp;the vine, aud dip them into a hot lixivium of wood-aſhes, with a little of the oil of olives in it. This diſ-poſes them to ſhrink and wrinkle ; and after this they&nbsp;are left on the vine three or four days ſeparated on&nbsp;ſticks in an horizontal ſituation, and then dried in the&nbsp;fun at leiſure, after being cut from the tree. The ſineſt&nbsp;aud beſt raiſins are thoſe called in ſome places </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Damaſ-tus</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tube roifins ;</span><span class="font1"> which are diſtinguiſhed from the&nbsp;others by their ſize and figure : they are flat and&nbsp;wrinkled on the ſurface, foft and juicy within, and near&nbsp;an inch long ; and, when freſh and growing on the&nbsp;bunch, are of the ſize and ſhape of </span><span class="font0">a </span><span class="font1">large olive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The raiſins of the ſun, and jar-raiſins, are all dried by the heat of the ſun ; and theſe are the ſorts uſed in&nbsp;medicine. However, all the kinds have much the ſame&nbsp;virtues : they are all nutritive and balſamic ; they are&nbsp;allowed to be attenuant, are ſaid to be good in nephritic complaints, and are an ingredient in pectoral decoc-tions : in which caſes, as alſo in all others where aſtrin-gency is not required of them, they ſhould have the&nbsp;ſtones carefully taken oκt.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RALEIGH (Sir walter), fourth fon of walter Raleigh, Eſq; of Fardel, in the pariſh of Cornwood in&nbsp;Devonſhire, was born in 1552 at Hayes, in the pariſh&nbsp;of Budley, a farm belonging to his father. About the&nbsp;year 1568, he was ſent to </span><span class="font0">Οπεί </span><span class="font1">college in oxford,&nbsp;where he continued but a ſhort time ; for in the following year he embarked for France, being one of the&nbsp;hundred volunteers, commanded by Henry Champer-non, who, with other Engliſh troops, were ſent by&nbsp;queen Eliſabeth to aſſiſt the queen of Navarre in defending the Proteſtants. In this ſervice he continued&nbsp;for five or ſix years ; after which he returned to Lon-don, and probably reſided in the Middle Temple. But&nbsp;his entcrpriſing genius would not ſuffer him to remain&nbsp;long in a ſtate of inactivity In 1577 or 1578, he&nbsp;embarked for the Low Countries with the troops ſent.&nbsp;by the queen to aſſiſt the Dutch againſt the Spaniards,&nbsp;and probably ſhared the glory of the deciſive victory&nbsp;over Don John of Auſtria in 1578. </span><span class="font0">Οη </span><span class="font1">his return to&nbsp;England, a new enterprife engaged his attention. His&nbsp;half-brother, Sir Humphrey Gilbert, having obtained a&nbsp;patent to plant and inhabit ſome parts of North America, Mr Raleigh embarked in this adventure ; but,&nbsp;meeting with a Spaniſh fleet, after a fraart engagement&nbsp;they returned, without ſucceſs, in 1579.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The following year, the king of Spain, </span><span class="font0">in </span><span class="font1">conjunc-tion with the pope, having projected a total couqneſt of the Engliſh dominions, ſent troops to Ireland to aſſiſt the Deſmonds in the Munſter rebellion. Raleigh&nbsp;obtained a captain’s commiſſion under Lord Grey of&nbsp;wilton, then deputy of Ireland, and embarked ſor that&nbsp;kingdom ; where, by his conduct and refolution, he was&nbsp;principally inſtrumental in putting an end to the rebellious attempt. He returned to England ; and attract-ed the notice of queen Eliſabeth, owing, as we are&nbsp;told in Naunton’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Fragmenta Regalia,</span><span class="font1"> to the following&nbsp;accidental piece of gallantry. The queen, as ſhe was&nbsp;one day taking a walk, being ſtopped by a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">plajhy</span><span class="font1"> place&nbsp;in the road, our gallant young ſoldier took off his new&nbsp;pluſh mantle, and ſpread it on the ground. Her ma∙&nbsp;jeſty trod gently over the fair foot-cloth, ſurpriſed and&nbsp;pleaſed with the adventure. He was a handſome man,&nbsp;and remarkable for his gentility of addreſs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The queen admitted him to her court, and employed him firſt as an attendant on the French ambaſſador Si-mier on his return home, and afterward to cſcort the&nbsp;duke of Anjou to Antwerp. During this excurſion he&nbsp;became perſonally known to the prince of orange ;&nbsp;from whom, at his return, he brought ſpecial acknowledgments to the queen, who now frequently converſed&nbsp;with him. But the inactive life of a courtier did not&nbsp;fuit the enterpriſing ſpirit of Mr Raleigh In the ycar&nbsp;1583, he embarked with h.is brother, Sir Humphrey&nbsp;Gilbert, on a ſecond expedition to Newfoundland, in a&nbsp;ſhip called the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rat'eigh,</span><span class="font1"> which he built at his own ex-pence ; but was obliged to return on account of an in-fectiυus diſtemper on board. He was, however, ſo&nbsp;little affected by this diſappointment, that he now laid&nbsp;before the queen and council a propoſal for exploring&nbsp;the continent of North America; and in 1584 obtained&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">a </span><span class="font1">patent empowering him to poſſeſs ſnch countries as hc&nbsp;ſhould diſcover in that part of the globe. Accordingly&nbsp;Mr Raleigh fitted out two ſhips at his own expence,&nbsp;which ſailed ip the month of April, and returned to&nbsp;England about the middle </span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font1">September, reporting that&nbsp;they had diſcovered and taken poſſeſſion of a fine country called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Windangocoa,</span><span class="font1"> to which the queen gave the&nbsp;name of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Virginia.</span><span class="font1"> About this time he was elected&nbsp;knight of the ſhire for the county of Devon, and ſoon&nbsp;aſter received the honour of knighthood ; and to enable him t® carry on his deſigns abroad, the queen&nbsp;granted him a patent for licenſing the venders of wine&nbsp;throughout the kingdom. In 1 ,85 he ſent a fleet of&nbsp;ſeven ſhips to virginia, commanded by his relation Sir&nbsp;Richard Greenville, who left a colony at Roanah of 107&nbsp;perſons, under the government of Mr Lane; and by the&nbsp;eſtabliſhment of this colony he firſt imported tobacco into&nbsp;England. See Nicotiana. In the ſame year Sir walter Raleigh obtained a grant of 12,000 acres bf the&nbsp;forfeited lands in the county of Corke in Ireland.—&nbsp;About the ſame time he was made ſeneſchal of the&nbsp;duchy of Cornwall, and warden of the {tanneries ; and&nbsp;grew into fuch favour w.th the queen, that even Lei-ccſter was jealous of his influence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In 1587, he ſent another colony of 150 men to vir-ginia, with a governor, Mr John white, and 12 aſſiſtants.
