 a large iſland in the South Sea, and one of the moſt conſiderable of thoſe of Solomon, being about 250 miles in circumference. W. Long. 130. 0. S.

The triumph of theſe laſted but a few months. The remains of that numerous body, which were left for the defence of the iſland, ſurrendered without reſiſtance to 160 French, who had embarked in 1651, from St Chriſtopher’s, to make themſelves maſters of the iſland.</p><p>Theſe new inhabitants loſt no time in making themſelves acquainted with a country ſo much diſputed. On a ſoil, in other reſpects excellent, they found only one river of a moderate ſize, which, gliding gently almoſt on a level with the ſea through a flat country, furniſhed only a brackiſh water. Two or three ſprings, which they found in the innermoſt parts of the iſland, made but feeble amends for this defect. The wells were for the moſt part dry. The conſtruction of reſervoirs required time. Nor was the climate more inviting to the new inhabitants. The iſland being flat, and covered with old trees, ſcarce afforded an opportunity for the winds to carry off the poiſonous vapours with which its moraſſes clogged the atmoſphere. There was but one remedy for this inconvenience; which was to burn the woods. The French ſet fire to them without delay; and, getting on board their ſhips, became ſpectators from the ſea, for ſeveral months, of the conflagration they had raiſed in the iſland. As ſon as the flames were extinguiſhed, they went on ſhore again.</p><p>They found the ſoil fertile beyond belief. Tobacco, cotton, arnotto, indigo, and ſugar, flouriſhed equally in it. So rapid was the progreſs of this colony, that in 11 years from its commencement there were upon it 822 white perſons, with a proportionable number of ſlaves. It was rapidly advancing to proſperity, when ſuch obſtacles were thrown in the way of its activity as made it decline again. This decay was as ſudden as its rife. In 1696 there were no more than 147 men, with their wives and children, and 623 blacks remaining; and theſe were tranſported to St Domingo.</p><p>Some obſcure individuals, ſome writers unacquainted with the views of government, with their ſecret nego</p><p>tiations, with the character of their miniſters, with the intereſts of the protectors and the protected, who flatter themſelves that they can diſcern the reaſon of events amongſt a multitude of important or frivolous cauſes, which may have equally occaſioned them; who do not conceive, that among all theſe cauſes the moſt natural may poſſibly be the fartheſt from the truth; who after having read the news, or journal of the day, with profound attention, decide as peremptorily as if they had been placed all their lifetime at the helm of the ſtate, and had aſſiſted at the council of kings; who are never more deceived than in thoſe circumſtance in which they diſplay ſome ſhare of penetration; writers as abſurd in the praiſes as in the blame which they beſtow upon nations, in the favourable or unfavourable opinion they form of miniſterial operations: theſe idle dreamers, in a word, who think they are perſons of importance, becauſe their attention is always engaged on matters of conſequence, being convinced that courts are always governed in their deciſions by the moſt comprehenſive views of profound policy, have ſuppoſed that the court of Verſailles had neglected Santa Cruz, merely becauſe they wiſhed to abandon the ſmall iſlands in order to unite all their ſtrength, induſtry, and population, in the large ones; but this is a miſtaken notion. This determination aroſe from the farmers of the revenue, who found that the contraband trade of Santa Cruz with St Thomas was detrimental to their intereſts. The ſpirit of finance hath in all times been injurious to commerce; it hath deſtroyed the ſource from whence it ſprang. Santa Cruz continued without inhabitants, and without cultivation, till 1733, when it was sold by France to Denmark for 30,7501. Soon after the Danes built there the fortreſs of Chriſtianſtadt. Then it was that this northern power ſeemed likely to take deep root in America. Unfortunately, ſhe laid her plantations under the yoke of excluſive privileges. lnduſtrious people of all ſects, particularly Moravians, ſtrove in vain to overcome this great difficulty. Many attempts were made to reconcile the interests of the coloniſts and their oppreſſors, but without ſucceſs. The two parties kept up a continual ſtruggte of animoſity, not of induſtry. At length the government, with a moderation not to be expected from its conſtitution, purchaſed, in 1754, the privileges and effects of the company. The price was fixed at L. 412,500, part of which was paid in ready money, and the remainder in bills upon the treaſury, bearing intereſt. From this time the navigation to the iſlands was opened to all the ſubjects of the Daniſh dominions. Of 345 plantations, which were ſeen at Santa Cruz, 150 were covered with ſugar canes, and every habitation is limited to 3000 Daniſh feet in length, and 2000 in breadth. It is inhabited by 2136 white men, by 22,244 ſlaves, and by 155 freedmen.</p><p><hi rend="italic">SANTA Cruz,</hi> in Teneriff.

This archbiſhop hath likewiſe, as metropolitan, a fort of inſpection over the dioceſes of Quito, of Panama, of Caraccas, of St Martha, and of Carthagena.
