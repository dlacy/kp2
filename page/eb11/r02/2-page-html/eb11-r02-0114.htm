The&nbsp;splenial is absent&nbsp;in chameleons;&nbsp;near the vanishing point in some&nbsp;of the Agamidae.&nbsp;The coronoid is&nbsp;always present,&nbsp;for the insertion&nbsp;of masseter&nbsp;muscles.

<p><span class="font1">The snakes’</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">skull shows many peculiarities, and&nbsp;most of the bones&nbsp;of the cranial capsule fuse together without sutures. The&nbsp;occipital condyle is triple, the lateral occipitals and the basioccipital taking equal share in its composition; the basioccipital&nbsp;is excluded from the foramen magnum ; frequently one common&nbsp;epiphysial pad covers this tripartite condyle. The supra-occipital is likewise excluded from the margin of the foramen&nbsp;magnum by the lateral occipitals. The basisphenoid is prolonged&nbsp;forwards into a long presphenoidal rostrum, on the upper surface of which the trabeculae cranii, which persist as cartilages,&nbsp;extend forwards to blend with the median ethmoidal cartilage.&nbsp;There are no ali- and no orbitosphenoids, their places being&nbsp;taken by downward extensions of the frontal bones, which&nbsp;descend to this sphenoidal rostrum and then turn inwards&nbsp;to meet together on the floor of the cranial cavity. There is&nbsp;consequently no interorbital septum. The parietals also descend laterally, but unite with the basisphenoid by suture. On&nbsp;the base of the skull we note various processes for the insertion&nbsp;of ventral cervicooccipital muscles, much used during the&nbsp;act of vigorous striking. Boidae have a long sphenoidal ridge&nbsp;and thick basipterygoid processes; others have one or more&nbsp;median knobs or crests, and the Viperidae have a very prominent and large ridge. The parietals fuse together into an&nbsp;unpaired mass whence arises mostly a strong median crest&nbsp;which projects a little beyond the occiput; there is no parietal&nbsp;or pineal foramen. There are paired frontaIs, postfrontals,&nbsp;prefrontaIs and</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">nasals; the latter</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">are said to coössify</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">widcIy separated</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">from them, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">often from each other, in the Colubridae and Viperidae. The premaxillary is single·, and only in Glauconiidae connected&nbsp;with the maxillaries; in the others it is but loosely connected&nbsp;with the ethmoidal end of the skull, for instance, with the&nbsp;turbinals, which are osseous and well developed in pythons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The whole appendicular apparatus is most loosely attached to the skull, at least in the typical snakes, and since they do not&nbsp;chew their prey but only hook it in, so to speak, during the act&nbsp;of swallowing, the whole apparatus is as movable as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The whole palatal apparatus shows many modifications, but the maxillaries, palatines and pterygoids always remain widely&nbsp;asunder, and from the mid-line. Some of the modifications,&nbsp;so far as they are used for taxonomic purposes, are mentioned&nbsp;in the article </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Snakes: </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Classification.</span><span class="font1"> In the majority of snakes&nbsp;the maxillaries form the borders of the mouth, and they are but&nbsp;loosely attached to the other bones, to their palatine processes,&nbsp;to the palatines, and with their posterior ends, by the ectopterygoids to the pterygoids. In the Viperidae the maxillaries are&nbsp;much shortened and articulate extensively with the prefrontals;&nbsp;they can be erected, or rather pushed forwards, by the ectopterygoids (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Snakes)</span><span class="font1"> ; they are not connected with the palatines.&nbsp;The pterygoids diverge posteriorly and articulate loosely with&nbsp;the quadrates; in the original condition the articulation is near&nbsp;the distal end of the quadrate, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font1"> in Boidae, and the pterygoids&nbsp;may form an additional attachment with the mandibles; in the&nbsp;Viperidae the pterygoids are somewhat shortened and are attached&nbsp;to about the middle of the quadrate shafts; in the Amblycepha-lidae they are still shorter and do not reach these bones. The&nbsp;ectopterygoids are lost by the burrowing Typhlopidae and Glau-coniidae. The quadrate is always extremely movable; besides&nbsp;being in a most curious way connected with the outer end of the&nbsp;columellar rod (see below, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ear),</span><span class="font1"> it is suspended from the skull&nbsp;by the squamosal. The squamoso-quadrate connexion is very&nbsp;loose; that of the squamosal with the skull varies much. In&nbsp;the majority of snakes it slides quite freely upon the parietal;&nbsp;it is much longer than the quadrate in the boas, much shorter&nbsp;than the elongated and slender quadrate in most of the poisonous&nbsp;snakes. Lastly, in most of the ancient burrowing snakes, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.&nbsp;Typhlops, Glaucoma, Ilysia</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Uropeltis,</span><span class="font1"> the squamosal has&nbsp;worked its way into the cranial wall so that the quadrate, itseIf&nbsp;also much shortened, rests directly upon the cranium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Vertebral Column.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The vertebrae of all reptiles are gastrocentrous, that is to say, the centra or bodies of the vertebrae are formed by the originally&nbsp;paired, interventral cartilages, while the basiventrals are reduced,&nbsp;persisting either as so-called intercentra or wedge-bones, or as&nbsp;intervertebral pads, or disappearing altogether; the basidorsal&nbsp;elements form the neural arch. At the earlier stages of development the gastrocentrous vertebrae behave in the same way as&nbsp;in the Urodela, except that the interdorsal pair of elements is&nbsp;suppressed from the beginning (the very elements which in</span></p>
