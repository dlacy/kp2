<p><label>RICINA</label>
an ancient town of Picenum, Italy, 3 m. N.W. of the modern Macerata, on the banks of the river Potenza, in a fertile valley. It was probably a <hi rend="italic">municipium</hi> until it was refounded by Pertinax and Septimius Severus, after which it bore the name Colonia Helvia Ricina Pertinax. The site is now deserted, but considerable ruins of a theatre and remains of baths and other buildings (all in brickwork of the imperial period) still exist; also the fragments of an ancient bridge over the Potenza.</p>
