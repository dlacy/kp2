That a reconciliation should be made, upon fair, can did, and equitable terms, by engaging each of the par ties tq temper their zeal with moderation, to abate re csprocaliy the rigour of their pretensions, and remit something of their respective claims. The third expe dsent was most generally approved of, being peculiarly agreeable to all who had at heart the welfare of the empire; nor did the pope seem to look upon it either with averi ion or contempt. Various conferences there fore were held between persons eminent sor piety and learning on both sides j and nothing was omitted that might have the least tendency to calm the animosities and heal the divisions which reigned between the con. tending parties. But the differences were too great to admit of a reconciliation; and therefore the votaries of Rome had recourse to the powerful arguments of imperial 
edicts, 
and the force of the secular arm. On the 19th of.november, a severe decree was issued out by the express order of the emperor (during the absence 
of 
the Hessian and saxon princes, who were the chief supporters of the Protestant cause), in which everything was manisestly adapted to deject the friends of religious liberty, excepting only a faint and dubious promise of engaging the pope to assemble a general council about six months after the separation of the diet. In this de créé the dignity and excellence of the Popish religion were extolled beyond measure, a new degree of severity and force was added to that which had been published at Worms against Luther aijd his adherents, the changes which had been introduced into the doctrine and discipline of the Protestant churches were severely eensured, and a solemn order was addressed to the princes, cities, and Rates, who had thrown off the Papal yoke, to return to their allegiance to Rome, on pain of incurring the indignation and vengeance of the emperor as the patron and protector of the church. Of this formidable decree thc ejector of ßaxonyand confederated princeswere nosooner informed, than they assembled in order to deliberate on the measures proper to be taken in such a crisis. In the years 1530 and 1531 they met, sirst at smalcald, and afterwards at Frankfurt, where they formed a solemn alliance and confederacy, with the intention of defending vigorously their religion and liberties against the dangers and encroachments with which they were threa tened by the edict of Augshurg, without attempting, however, any thing offensive against the votaries of Rome; and into this confederacy they invited the kings of England, France, Denmark, cleaving no means unemployed that might corroborate and cement this itrt portant alliance, 
This confederacy was 
at 
sirst opposed by Luther, from an apprehension of the calamities and troubles which it might produce j but at last, perceiving the necessity of it, he consented;; he uncharitably, as well as imprudently, refused to comprehend in it the followers of Zuinglius among thc swiss, together with 
the 
German states and cities who had adopted the sentiments 

and confession of Bucer. In the invitation addressed 
to 
Henry VIII of England, whom the confederate princes were 
willing 
to declare the head and protector of 
their 
league, the following things, among 
others, were expressly stipulated : That the 
king shauld 
encourage, promote, and maintain, the true doctrine of Christ as it was contained in the confession of Augse ' burg, and deiend the same at the next general council : that he should not agree to any council summoned bv the bishop of Rome, but protest against it; and neither submit to its decrees, nor suffer them to be respected in his dominions; that he should never allow the Roman pontiff to have any preeminence or jurisdiction in his dominions; that he should advance 100, 000 crowns for the use of the confederacy, and double that sum if it became necessary: : which articles the confederate piinces were equally obliged to observe on their part. 
I o these demands the king replied, that he would main tain and promote the true doctrine of Christ; but, at the same time, as thesprue ground of that doctrine lay only in the holy scriptures, he would not accept at any one’s hand what should he his own faith, or that of hls kingdom j and therefore desired that they would send over two learned men to confer with him, in order to promote a religious union between him and the conse derates. However, he declared himself of their opinion with 1 egard to the meeting of a free general council, and promised to join with them in all such councils for the defence of the true doctrine; hut thought the regula tion of the ceremonial part of religion, being a matter of indifference, ought to be left to the choice of each sovereign for his own dominions. After this the king gave them a second answer more full and satisfactory; but ai tel the execution of queen Anne, this negotiation came to nothing. On the one hand, the king grew cold when he perceived that the confederates were no longer of use to him in supporting the validity of hia marriage, and, on the other hand, the German princes became sensible that they could never succeed with. Henry unless they allowed him an absolute dictatorship in matters of religion. 
while everything thus tended to an open war between the two opposite parties, the elector Palatine, and the elector of Mentz, offered their mediation, and en deavouied to procure a reconclhatlon. 
I 
he emperor himself, for various reasons, was at this time inclined to peace : for, on the one hand, he stood in need of succours against the Turks, which the Protestant princes resused to grant as long as the edicts of worms and Augshurg remained in force; and, on the other, the election of his brother Ferdinand to the dignity of king of the Romans, which had been carried by a majority of votes at the diet of Cologne in 1531, was by the same plinces contested, as bemg contrary to the funda mental laws of the empire. In consequence of all this, after many negotiations and projects of reconciliation, a treaty of peace was concluded at Nuremberg in 1532, between the emperor and the Protestant princes, on the following conditions; <w'z. That the latter should fur r.ish a subsidy for carrying on the war against the Turks, and acknowledge Ferdinand lawful king of the Romans; and that the emperor on lus part should abrogate and annul the edicts of worms and Augshurg, and allow the Lutherans the free and undisturbed exercise of their religious doctrine and discipline, until a rule of faith was fixed either in the free general council that was to be assembled in the space of six months, or in a diet of the empire.
