<p><span class="font1">ROTA, COURT OF, one of the departments of the medieval papal organization, existing alongside the Dataria, the Poeniten-tiaria, the two Signaturas (S. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Gratiae</span><span class="font1"> and 5. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Juslitiae),</span><span class="font1"> and other&nbsp;bureaus. The Rota was the supreme court of Christendom.&nbsp;It consisted of twelve members, three from Rome, two from&nbsp;Spain, one each from Bologna, Ferrara, Venice, Milan, Germany,&nbsp;France, and (alternately) Tuscany or Perugia. It declined&nbsp;in importance when the Signitura Justitiae was set above it as&nbsp;the court of appeal for Italy, and more so as the geographical&nbsp;jurisdiction of the pope was gradually lessened. After the&nbsp;Council of Trent the old arrangements were replaced by the&nbsp;Congregations, permanent committees of cardinals which deal&nbsp;with definite branches of business. The Rota, however, was&nbsp;restored to its functions as supreme court of appeal by Pope&nbsp;Pius X. in 1908 (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Curia Romana).</span></p>

In his&nbsp;published papers he dealt with metamorphism and crystalline&nbsp;schists, discussed the origin of serpentine, and wrote on Vesuvian&nbsp;rocks and on Ponza Island. His separate works included </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Der&nbsp;Vesuv und die Umgebung von Neapel</span><span class="font1"> (1857); </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Beiträge zur&nbsp;Petrographie der plutonischen Gesteine</span><span class="font1"> (1869^84); </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Allgemeine&nbsp;und chemische Geologie</span><span class="font1"> (3 vols., 1879-93); and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">die Erdbeben&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(1882).

<p><span class="font1">ROTHE, RICHARD (1799-1867), Lutheran theologian, was born at Posen on the 28th of January 1799. He studied theology&nbsp;in the universities of Heidelberg and Berlin (1817-20) under&nbsp;Karl Daub (1765-1836), Schleiermacher and Neander, the&nbsp;philosophers and historians Georg Hegel, Friedrich Creuzer&nbsp;(1771-1858) and F. C. Schlosser (1776-1861) exercising a&nbsp;considerable influence in shaping his thought. From 1820 to&nbsp;1822 he was in the clerical seminary at Wittenberg. In the&nbsp;autumn of 1823 he was appointed chaplain to the Prussian&nbsp;embassy in Rome, of which Baron Bunsen was the head. This&nbsp;post he exchanged in 1828 for a professorship in the Wittenberg theological seminary, of which in 1832 he became also&nbsp;second director and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ephorus,</span><span class="font1"> and hence in 1837 he removed to&nbsp;Heidelberg as professor and director of a new clerical seminary;&nbsp;in 1849 he accepted an invitation to Bonn as professor and&nbsp;university preacher, but in 1854 he returned to Heidelberg&nbsp;as professor of theology, and afterwards became member of the&nbsp;Oberkirchenrath, a position he held until his death on the&nbsp;20th of August 1867. As a youth Rothe had a bent towards&nbsp;a supernatural mysticism; his chosen authors were those of&nbsp;the romantic school, and Ñovális remained throughout his life&nbsp;a special favourite. In Berlin and Wittenberg he came under&nbsp;the influence of Pietism as represented by such men as Rudolf&nbsp;Stier (1800-1862) and Friedrich Tholuck, though Tholuck&nbsp;pronounced him a “ very modem Christian.” He afterwards&nbsp;confessed that, though he had been a sincere, he was never&nbsp;a happy, Pietist. In Rome, under the broadening influence&nbsp;of classical and ecclesiastical art, he learned to look at Christianity in its human and universálistic aspects, and began&nbsp;to develop his great idea, the inseparable relation of religion and&nbsp;morals. He began then, and particularly after the revolution&nbsp;of July 1830, likewise to give a more definite form to his peculiar&nbsp;view of the relations of church and state. He thus became&nbsp;out of harmony with the pietistic thought and life of Wittenberg. His removal to Heidelberg and the publication of his&nbsp;first important work, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Die Anfänge der christlichen Kirche und&nbsp;ihrer Verfassung</span><span class="font1"> (1837), coincide with the attainment of the&nbsp;principal theological positions with which his name is associated. During the middle period of his career (1837-61) he led&nbsp;the life of a scholastic recluse. During the last six years of&nbsp;his life he came forward as the advocate of a free theology and&nbsp;of the Protestantenverein.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rothe was one of the most profound and influential of modern German theologians. Like Schleiermacher he combined with the&nbsp;keenest logical faculty an intensely religious spirit, while his philosophical tendencies were in sympathy, rather with Hegel than with&nbsp;Schleiermacher, and theosophic mysticism was more congenial to&nbsp;him than the abstractions of. Spinoza, to whom Schleiermacher&nbsp;owed so much. He classed himself among the theosophists, and&nbsp;claimed to be a convinced and happy supernaturalist in a scientific&nbsp;age. His system, though it may seem to contain doubtful or even&nbsp;fantastic elements, is in its general outlines a noble massive whole,&nbsp;constructed by a profound, comprehensive, fearless and logical&nbsp;mind. A peculiarity of his thought was the realistic nature of his&nbsp;spiritualism: his abstractions are all real existences; his spiritual&nbsp;entities are real and corporeal; his truth is actual being. Hence&nbsp;Rothe, unlike Schleiermacher, lavs great stress, for instance, on&nbsp;the personality of God, on the reality of the worlds of good and evil&nbsp;spirits, and on the visible second coming of Christ. Hence his&nbsp;religious feeling and theological speculation demanded their realization in a kingdom of God coextensive with man’s nature, terrestrial&nbsp;history and human society; and thus his theological system became&nbsp;a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Theologische Ethik,</span><span class="font1"> as he entitled one of his books (3 vols., 1845-1848). It is on this work that Rothe's permanent reputation as a&nbsp;theologian and ethical writer will rest. The first edition remained&nbsp;twelve years out of print before the second (5 vols., 1867-71)&nbsp;appeared. It was the author’s purpose to rewrite the whole, but&nbsp;he died when he had completed the first two volumes. The remainder was reprinted from the first edition by Professor Heinrich&nbsp;Holtzmann, with the addition of some notes and emendations left&nbsp;by the author.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Theologische Ethik</span><span class="font1"> begins with a general sketch of the author’s system of speculative theology in. its two divisions, theology proper&nbsp;and cosmology, cosmology falling into the two subdivisions of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Physik&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(the world of nature) and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ethik</span><span class="font1"> (the wprld of spirit). It is the last&nbsp;subdivision with which the body of the work is.occupied. After&nbsp;an analysis of the religious consciousness, which yields the doctrine&nbsp;of an absolute ¿personal and spiritual God, Rothe proceeds to deduce&nbsp;from his idea of God the process and history of creative development, which is eternally proceeding and bringing forth, as its&nbsp;unending purpose, worlds of spirits, partially self-creative and&nbsp;sharing the absolute personality of the Creator. Rothe regards the&nbsp;natural man as the consummation of the development of physical&nbsp;nature, and obtains spirit as the personal attainment, with divine&nbsp;help, of those beings in whom the further creative process of moral&nbsp;development is. carried on. His theory leaves the natural man,&nbsp;without hesitation, to be developed by the natural processes of&nbsp;animal evolution. The attainment of. the higher stage of development is the moral and religious vocation of man; this higher.stage&nbsp;is self-determination, the performance of every human function as&nbsp;a voluntary and intelligent agent, or as a person, having as its&nbsp;cosmical effect the subjection of all material to spiritual existences.&nbsp;This personal process of spiritualization is the continuation of the&nbsp;eternal divine work of creation. Thus the. moral life and the&nbsp;religious life coincide, and when normal are identical; both have&nbsp;the same aim and. are occupied with the same task, the accomplishment of the spiritualization of the world. “ Piety, that it may&nbsp;become truth and reality,, demands morality as its fulfilment, as&nbsp;the only concrete, element in which the idea of fellowship with God&nbsp;is realized; morality, that it may find its perfect unfolding, requires&nbsp;the aid of piety, in the light of which alone it can comprehend its&nbsp;own idea in all its breadth and depth.” The process of human&nbsp;development Rothe regards as necessarily taking an abnormal&nbsp;form and passing through the phase of sin. This abnormal condition necessitates a fresh creative act, that of salvation, which&nbsp;was, however, from the .first, part of the divine plan. As a preparation for this salvation supernatural revelation was required&nbsp;for the purifying and revivification of the religious consciousness,&nbsp;and the Saviour Himself had to appear in human history as a fresh&nbsp;miraculous creation, born of a woman but not begotten by a man.&nbsp;In consequence of His supernatural birth the Saviour, or the&nbsp;second Adam, was free from original sin. By His own moral and&nbsp;religious development Hfe made possible a relation of perfect fellowship between God and man, which was the new and highest stage&nbsp;of the divine creation of mankind. This stage of development&nbsp;inaugurated by the Saviour is attained by means of His kingdom or&nbsp;the community of salvation, which is both moral and religious, and&nbsp;in the first instance and temporarily only religious—that is, a&nbsp;church.. As men reach the full development of their nature, and&nbsp;appropriate the perfection of the Saviour, the separation between</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
