<p><span class="font1">RABANUS MAURUS. See </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Hrabanus Maurus. </span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RABAT </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">(Ribát), Rbát,</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Arbát,</span><span class="font1"> also known as </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">New</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sallee,</span><span class="font1"> a city of Morocco, on the coast of the Atlantic, 130 miles south of Cape Spartel at the mouth of the&nbsp;Bú Raḳraḳ, which separates it from Sallee proper on the&nbsp;northern bank. It is a commercial town of about 26,000&nbsp;to 30,000 inhabitants, occupying a rocky plateau and surrounded by massive but dilapidated walls, strengthened&nbsp;by three forts on the seaward side. The old citadel, overhanging the mouth of the river, is still, though partially in&nbsp;ruins, an imposing building, with huge arched gateways,&nbsp;square towers, and masses of rich red-brown masonry ; and&nbsp;to the south of the town lies a modern palace defended by&nbsp;earthworks after the European fashion. The conspicuous&nbsp;feature in the view from the sea is the Hasan tower, a&nbsp;beautiful square-built minaret 180 feet high, which stands&nbsp;at an elevation of about 65 feet above the sea to the west&nbsp;of the walled town, and in the midst of gardens and orchards whose vegetation partly hides the ruined columns&nbsp;of the ancient mosque to which it was attached. It is&nbsp;constructed of soft reddish-brown stone, and each side is&nbsp;adorned with a different design. At one time the Bú&nbsp;Raḳraḳ afforded a much better harbour than it does now :&nbsp;the roadstead is quite unprotected, and there is a dangerous bar at the mouth of the river. Rabát trades with Fez&nbsp;and the interior of Morocco, with the neighbouring coast-towns and Gibraltar, and with Marseilles, Manchester,&nbsp;and London. The principal articles of export are wool,&nbsp;hides, and wax, and the products of that local manufacture of leather, carpets, mats, woollen and cotton stuffs,&nbsp;pottery, and circular brass trays which makes Rabát the&nbsp;greatest industrial centre in Morocco. Cotton goods and&nbsp;loaf-sugar are first among the imports. The average value&nbsp;of the exports in the ten years 1872 to 1881 was £47,236,&nbsp;and of the imports £73,945. In 1883 the figures were&nbsp;£39,596 and £50,222 respectively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Sallee (Salá), on the north side of the river, is also enclosed with walls. Much of the interior, however, is&nbsp;vacant and the houses are mean; and, unlike their neighbours of Rabát, the inhabitants (about 30,000) down to&nbsp;quite recent times distinguished themselves by particular&nbsp;hostility to Christians, who were thus prevented from&nbsp;entering their gates. To the north a ruined aqueduct&nbsp;extends for miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rabát was founded by Yak'úb al-Manṣúr (ob. 1306) ; but Sallee was then an ancient city, and on the scarped hills to the west of&nbsp;Rabát stand the ruins of Sala, a Roman colony. Sheila, as the&nbsp;place is now called, was the seat of the mausoleum of the Bení-Merín dynasty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RABBA, a town of Nupi or Nufi, on the bank of the Kworra (Niger), opposite the island of Zagozhi, in 9º 6' N. lat., and 200 miles above the confluence of the Kworra&nbsp;and the Binue. At the time of Lander’s visit in 1830 it&nbsp;was a place of 40,000 inhabitants and one of the most&nbsp;important markets in the country. In 1851 Dr Barth&nbsp;reported it “in ruins,” and in 1867 Rohlfs found it with&nbsp;only 500 inhabitants. A mission station, established there&nbsp;in 1857 by the Church Missionary Society, was afterwards&nbsp;withdrawn. The town has latterly somewhat recovered&nbsp;its position.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RABBĀH—</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i.e., </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rab Abbah bar Naḥmani</span><span class="font1">—was of the house of Eli, on whom the curse rested that none&nbsp;of them should reach a high age (1 Sam. ii. 33). Like&nbsp;Rābā, he tried to remove this curse (T. B., </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rosh Has-shanah,</span><span class="font1"> 18a ; see </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rābā).</span><span class="font1"> He was twenty-two years head&nbsp;of the academy of Pumbadithā, from which he fled in&nbsp;the year 330, pursued by a troop of the Persian king&nbsp;(Shápúr IL), and perished miserably in a jungle (T. B.,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bobo Metṣ‛io,</span><span class="font1"> leaf 86a).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rabbāh, owing to his great dialectic powers, to which no difficulty seemed difficult, was called 'Oker Harim, “uprooter of mountains.”@@<sup>1</sup> This title was applied to him when the selection&nbsp;as “ head ” lay between him and his friend, fellow-pupil, and successor, Rab Yoseph, “the Blind,” to whom is commonly, but by&nbsp;mistake, ascribed the authorship of certain Targumim. This latter&nbsp;doctor was, owing to his vast but mere reproductive powers, called&nbsp;Sinai, the mountain from which the letter of the Law was given&nbsp;(T. B., </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Berakhoth,</span><span class="font0"> 64a).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(S. M. S.-S.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RABBI. See </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rab.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RABBIT. This animal, one of the best known and most frequently seen of all wild British mammals, is, with&nbsp;the hare, a member of the Rodent genus </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lepus,</span><span class="font1"> which&nbsp;contains about twenty-five other species spread over the&nbsp;greater part of the world, and whose more important&nbsp;characters have already been referred to (see </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Hare,</span><span class="font1"> vol.&nbsp;xi. p. 476, and </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Mammalia,</span><span class="font1"> vol. xv. p. 421).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The rabbit </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Lepus cuniculus),</span><span class="font1"> speaking for the present of the wild race only, is distinguished from the hare&nbsp;externally by its smaller size, shorter ears and feet, by&nbsp;the absence or reduction of the black patch at the tip of&nbsp;the ears so characteristic of the hare, and by its greyer&nbsp;colour. The skull is very similar to that of the hare (see&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Mammalia,</span><span class="font1"> fig. 99), but is smaller and lighter, and has&nbsp;a slenderer muzzle and a longer and narrower palate.&nbsp;Besides these characters, however, the rabbit is sharply</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">separated from the hare by the fact that it brings forth its young naked, blind, and helpless; to compensate for&nbsp;this, it digs a deep burrow in the earth in which they are&nbsp;born and reared, while the young of the hare are born&nbsp;fully clothed with fur, and able to take care of themselves&nbsp;in the mere shallow depression or “ form ” in which they&nbsp;are born. The weight of the rabbit is from 2| to 3 lb,&nbsp;although individuals perfectly wild have been recorded&nbsp;up to more than 5. Its general habits are too well known&nbsp;to need a detailed description here. It breeds from four&nbsp;to eight times a year, bringing forth each time from three&nbsp;to eight young. Its period of gestation is about thirty&nbsp;days, and it is able to bear when six months old. It&nbsp;attains to an age of about seven or eight years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The geographical distribution of the rabbit presents many most interesting peculiarities. It is believed to&nbsp;be originally a native of the western half of the Mediterranean basin only, and still abounds in Spain, Sardinia,&nbsp;southern Italy and Sicily, Greece, Tunis, and Algeria;&nbsp;and many of the islands adjoining these countries are&nbsp;quite overrun with it. Thence it has spread, partly by&nbsp;man’s agency, northwards throughout temperate western&nbsp;Europe, increasing rapidly wherever it gains a footing;&nbsp;and this extension is still going on, as is shown by the</span></p>
