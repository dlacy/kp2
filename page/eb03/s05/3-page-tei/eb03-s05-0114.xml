It has been obſerved in the introduction, that abbreviations are only to be employed by proficients in this art ; becauſe expedition is not the firſt, though the ultimate, object in view : and that an eaſy legibility is of the utmoſt conſequence to the learner ; which, however, cannot be preſerved, if he adopts too ſoon thoſe very rules which in time will afford him the greateſt eaſe when applied with judgement.</p><p>The following ſhort and practical rules will be found, we hope, fully adequatc to every purpoſe for which they were intended, and are far ſuperior in the facility of their application to any which we have ſeen.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Rule</hi> I. The uſual abbreviations in long-hand are always to be followed; as Mr for Maſter, M. D. for Doctor of Physic, and Abp. for Archbiſhop, &amp;c.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Rule</hi> II. Subſtantives, adjectives, verbs, and participles, when the senſe will direct to the meaning, are to be expressed by their initial conſonant with the distinguiſhing marks exhibited in Plate CCCCLXXXΠ. viz. a ſubſtantive muſt have the dot exactly over its initial conſonant ; an adjective muſt have a dot under it ; a verb is to be expreſſed by a comma over its initial conſonant; and a participle by a comma under @@<hi rend="smallcaps">(m).</hi> Theſe being the four principal parts of ſpeech will be sufficient  ; and an adept will never be at a loss to know when he can with ſafety apply this rule to them.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Rule</hi> III. To render the writing more legible, the laſt letter oſ the word may be joined to the firſt, and the proper mark applied.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Rule</hi> IV. The conſtituent or radical part of words, eſpecially if they are long, will often ſerve for the whole, or ſometimes the firſt syllable ; as, we ought to moderate our <hi rend="italic">ex.</hi> by our <hi rend="italic">circum. ;</hi> a man’s <hi rend="italic">man.</hi> commonly ſhape his <hi rend="italic">for.	∙</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Rule</hi> V. All long words without exception may have their prepoſitions or terminations expreſſed by the incipient conſonant of ſuch preposition or termination.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Rule</hi> VI. When there is a great dependence between the parts oſ a ſentence, the initial letter will often ſuffice ; as L. is the capital of Great <hi rend="italic">B.</hi> ; the eldeſt S. of the king of Great <hi rend="italic">B</hi> is ſtyled prince of W<hi rend="italic">.</hi> Every one, it is preſumed, will allow this to be perfectly legible in long-hand, then why may it not in ſtenography ?</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Rule</hi> VII. The terminations <hi rend="italic">ness</hi> and <hi rend="italic">leſs</hi> may be omitted; as f<hi rend="italic">aithfulneſs</hi> is only to be written <hi rend="italic">faithful ; forwardness, forward ; heedless, heed ; stubbornness, stubborn, &amp;c.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Rule</hi> VIII. The ſecond and third perſons of verbs, ending in <hi rend="italic">eth</hi> and <hi rend="italic">est,</hi> may be expressed by s <hi rend="smallcaps">;</hi> as, he <hi rend="italic">loves,</hi> thou <hi rend="italic">teaches ;</hi> inſtead of he <hi rend="italic">loveth,</hi> thou <hi rend="italic">teachest : </hi>or even without <hi rend="italic">s ;</hi> as, he <hi rend="italic">love, &amp;c.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Rule</hi> IX. Words may often be entirely omitted, and yet no ambiguity enſue ; as, <hi rend="italic">In beginning God created</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic"> heaven and earth, for</hi> In <hi rend="italic">the</hi> beginning God created <hi rend="italic">the</hi> heaven and <hi rend="italic">the</hi> earth.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Rule</hi> X. When there is an immediate repetition of a ſentence or word, a line is to be drawn under the ſentence or word to be repeated ; as, Amen, Amen, is to written Am<hi rend="italic">en ;</hi> but if any words intervene before a word or sentence is to be repeated, the line muſt be drawn as before, and a <hi rend="smallcaps">λ</hi> or mark of omiſſion placed where the repetition ſhould begin ; as, <hi rend="italic">Is it just</hi><hi rend="italic underline"> the </hi><hi rend="italic">innocents should be</hi> condemned <hi rend="smallcaps">λ</hi> reviled ?</p><p><hi rend="italic">The </hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps">Contents</hi><hi rend="italic"> of the </hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps">Stenographic Plates.</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">Fabricius's Reply to Pyrrhus.</hi></p><p>As to my poverty, you have indeed, Sir, been rightly informed. @@My whole eſtate conſiſts in a houſe of but mean appearance, and a little ſpot of ground, from which by my own labour I draw my ſupport. But if by any means you have been persuaded to think, that this poverty makes me leſs considered in my country, or in any degree unhappy, you are extremely deceived. I have no reaſon to complain of fortune, ſhe ſupplies me with all that nature requires ; and if I am without ſuperfluities, I am alſo free from the desire of them. With theſe I conseſs I ſhould be more able to ſuccour the neceſſitous, the only advantage for which the wealthy are to be envied ; but as ſmall as my poſſeſſions are, I can ſtill contribute ſomething to the ſupport of the ſtate and the aſſiſtance of my friends. With regard to honours, my country places me, poor as I am, upon a level with the richeſt : for Rome knows no qualifications for great employments but virtue and ability. She appoints me to officiate in the moſt auguſt ceremonies of religion ; ſhe entruſts me with the command of her armies ; ſhe confides to my care the moſt important negotiations. My poverty does not leſſen the weight and influence of my counsels in the ſenate ; the Roman people honour me for that very poverty which you consider as a diſgrace ; they know the many opportunities I have had in war to enrich myſelf without incurring cenſure ; they are convinced of my disintereſted zeal for their proſperity ; and if I have any thing to complain of in the return they make, it is only the exceſs of their applauſe. What value then can I ſet upon your gold and silver ! What king can add any thing to my fortune ! Always attentive to diſcharge the duties incumbent on me, I have a mind free from ſelf-reproach, and I have an honeſt fame. <hi rend="italic">Dodsley's Preceptor.</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">Letter to a Friend against waste of Time.</hi></p><p>Converſe often with yourſelf, and neither laviſh your time, nor ſuffer others to rob you of it. Many of our hours are ſtolen from us, and others paſs inſensibly away ; but of both theſe loſſes the moſt ſhameful is that which happens through our own neglect.
