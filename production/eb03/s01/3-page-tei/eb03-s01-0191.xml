It is related by the Engliſh hiſtorians, that, on the ſide of their countrymen, there were killed one knight, one eſquire, and 12 foot-ſoldiers. Nor will this appear altogether incredible, when we remember, that the Engliſh ranks remained unbroken, annd that their archers, at a ſecure diſtance, inceſſantly annnoyed the Scottiſh infantry.</p><p>According to capitulation, the town and caſtle of Berwick ſurrendered. The Engliſh king took twelve hoſtages, for ſecuring the fidelity of the citizens of Berwick.</p><p>Thus was the whole of Scotland reduced under the ſubjection of Baliol, excepting a few fortreſſes; ſo that it became neceſſary to provide for the ſafety of the young king and queen. Accordingly, they were conveyed to France, where they were honourablyy entertained. Meanwhile, Baliol employed himſelf in making new conceſſions to his liege-lord Edward; and in 1334 the work of ſubmiſſion was completed by a ſolemn inſtrument drawn up by Baliol, in which he ſurrendered great part of the Scottiſh dominions, to be for ever annexed to the crown of England. In this inſtrument Baliol ſaid, that “he had formerly become bound to make a grant to Edward of lands on the marches, to the amount of <hi rend="italic">two thouſand-pound lands</hi>; that the Scottiſh parliament had ratified his obligation; and that he had accordingly ſurrendered Berwick and its territory; and now, for completely diſcharging his obligation, he made an abſolute ſurrender to the Engliſh crown of the foreſts of Jedburgh, Selkirk, and Ettrick; of the counties of Roxburgh, Peebles, and Dumnfries; together with the county of Edinburgh, and the conſtabularies of Linlithgow and. Haddington.” This extraordinary ſurrender was made with ſo much precipitation, that Baliol forgot to except his own private eſtate out of it. This, however, was generouſly restored to him by Edward; who proclaimed, that, “having already received ſatisfaction in full, he had too much reverence for <hi rend="smallcaps">God,</hi> juſtice, and good faith to man, to allow the ceſſion to be prejudicial to the private rights of the king of Scots.” At the ſame time, Baliol preſented himſelf before his liege-lord; did homage, and ſwore fealty, “for the whole kingdom of Scotland and the iſles adjacent.”</p><p>A quarrel now aroſe among the diſinherited lords, to whom this revolution had been owing, which produced the worſt conſequences to the intereſt of Baliol. The brother of Alexander de Moubray died, leaving daughters, but no iſſue-male. Moubray having claimed a preference to the daughters of his brother, Baliol countenanced his ſuit, and, as it appears, put him in poſſeſſion of the inheritance. Henry de Beaumont earl of Buchan, and David de Strathbolgie or Haſtings, earl of Athol, eſpouſed the cauſe of the heirs-general; but perceiving that their ſolicitations were not heard, they left the court in diſguſt, and retired to their castles about the end of Auguſt 1334. Baliol ſon perceived his error in offending theſe two powerful lords; and in order to regain their favour, diſmiſſed Moubbray, and conferred on David de Strathbolgie the whole eſtates of the young Steward of Scotland. Thus he alienated the affections of Moubray, and added to the power of the earl of Athol, who was by far too powerful before.</p><p>About this time Sir Andrew Murray of Bothhwell, having regained his freedom, began to aſſemble the friends of liberty, and was immediately joined by Moubray. In a moment every thing was in confuſion. Geffrey de Moubray, governor of Roxburgh, revolted; Henry de Beaumont was beſieged in his caſtle of Dundarg by Murray and Moubray, and forced to ſurrender, but obtained liberty to depart into England. Richard Talbot, endeavouring to paſs into England with a body of troops, was defeated and taken priſoner by Sir William Keith of Galſton. The Steward of Scotland, who had lain concealed in the iſle of Bute ever ſince the battle of Halidon, now paſſed over to the caſtle of Dunbarton, which was one of the few forts remaining to king David. With the aſſiſtance of Dougal Campbell of Lochow, he made himſelf maſter of the caſtle of Dunoon in Cowal. His tenants of the iſle of Bute attacked and flew Alan de Lile the governor, and preſented his head to their maſter. John the ſon of Gilbert, governor of the caſtle of Bute, was made priſoner in the action. He ordered the garriſon to surrender, and attached himſelf to the Scottiſh intereſt. Encouraged by theſe ſucceſſes, the Steward entered his ancient inheritance of Renfrew, and compelled the inhabitants to acknowledge the ſovereignty of David. Godfrey de Roſs, the governor of Ayrſhire, ſubmitted to the Steward. The earl of Moray returned from France, whither he had fled after the battle of Halidon, and was acknowdedged regent along with the Steward. The earl, having raiſed a body of troops, marched againſt the earl of Athol, compelled him to retire into Lochaber, and at laſt to ſurrender; after which he embraced the party of the conquerors. Baliol was now obliged to retire again into England, in order to ſolicit aſſiſtance from Edward; and this was readily granted. Edward himſelf took the field at a very unfavourable ſeaſon for military enterpriſes. His army was divided into two parts. With the one Edward wasted Lothian, while Baliol did the like in Amandale with the other; and, in the mean time, Patrick earl of March, notwithſtanding the unfavourable poſture of affairs, renounced the allegiance he had ſworn to England. His motive for this was, that though the kings of England had maintained him in an independency dangerous to Scotland, he was aſſured that they would never permit him to become formidable in a country which they themſelves poſſeffed.</p><p>The year 1335 is remarkable for the ſiege of Locheven caſtle by the Engliſh, under John de Strivelin. This fort was built on a ſmall iſland, and very difficult of acceſs. The Engliſh commander erected a fort in the cemetery of Kinroſs; and at the lower end of the take, from whence runs the ſtream called <hi rend="italic">the Water of Leven,</hi> he raiſed a ſtrong and lofty bulwark, by means of which he hoped to lay the iſland under water, and oblige the garriſon to ſurrender. But four of the Scots ſoldiers, having found means to approach the bulwark undiſcovered, pierced it ſo dexterouſly, that the waters, ruſhing out with a prodigious force, overflowed part of the Engliſh camp; and the garriſon, ſallying out during the confuſion occaſioned by this unexpected inundation, ſtormed and plundered the fort at Kinroſs. At this time the Engliſh commander,·with many of his ſoldiers, happened to be abſent at Dunfermline, celebrating the feſtival of St Margaret. On his return, he ſwore that he would never deſiſt till</p></body></text></TEI>
