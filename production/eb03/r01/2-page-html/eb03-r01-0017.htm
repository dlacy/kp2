<p><span class="font2">have an account of a rainbow, which muſt have been formed by the exhalations from the city of London,&nbsp;when the ſun had been ſet 20 minutes, and conſequently the centre of the bow was above the horizon. The&nbsp;colours were the fame-as in the common rainbow, but&nbsp;fainter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It has often been made a fubject of inquiry among the curious how there came to be no rainbow before the&nbsp;flood, which is thought by ſome to have been the caſe&nbsp;from its being made a ſign of the covenant which theDei-fy was pleafed to make with man after that event. Mr&nbsp;whitehurſt, in his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Inquiry into the Original State and&nbsp;Formation if the Earth,</span><span class="font2"> p∙ 173, &amp;c. endeavours to eſtabliſh it as a matter of great probability at leaſt, that the&nbsp;antediluvian atmoſphere was ſo uniformly temperate as&nbsp;never to be ſubject to ſtorms, tempeſts, or rain, and of&nbsp;courſe it could never exhibit a rainbow. For our own&nbsp;part, we cannot ſee how the earth at that period could do&nbsp;without rain any more than at preſent ; and it appears&nbsp;to us from Scripture equally probable that the rainbow&nbsp;was ſeen before the flood as after it. It was then, how-ever, made a token of a certain covenant ; and it would&nbsp;unqueſtionably do equally well for that purpoſe if it had&nbsp;exiſted before as if it had not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Lunar Rainbow.</span><span class="font2"> The moon ſometimes alſo exhi-bits the phenomenon of an iris or rainbow by the re-fraction of her rays in drops of rain in the night-time. This phenomenon is very rare. In the Philofophical&nbsp;Tranſactions for 1783, however, we have an account of&nbsp;three feen in one year, and all in the fame place, communicated in two letters by Marmaduke Tunſtall, Efq.&nbsp;The firſt was ſeen 27th February 1782, at Greta&nbsp;Bridge, Yorkſhire, between ſeven and eight at night,&nbsp;and appeared “ in tolerably diſtinct colours, fimilar to a&nbsp;ſolar one, but mare faint : the orange colour ſeemed to&nbsp;predominate. It happened at full moon ; at which time&nbsp;alone they are ſaid to have been always ſeen. Though&nbsp;Ariſtotle is faid to have obſerved two, and ſome others&nbsp;have been ſeen by Suellius, &amp;c. I can only ſind two de-ſcribed with any accuracy ; viz. one by Plot, in his Hiſtory of oxfordſhire, ſeen by him in 1675, though&nbsp;without colours ; the other ſeen by a Derbyſhire gen-tleman at Glapwell, near Cheſterſield, deſcribed by Tho-reſhy, and inferted in N<sup>j</sup> 3 31. of the Philofophical Tranſ-actions : this was about Chriſtmas, 1710, and ſaid to&nbsp;have had all the colours of the Iris Solaris. The night&nbsp;was windy ; and though there was then a drizzling rain&nbsp;and dark cloud, in which the rainbow was reflected, it&nbsp;proved afterwards a light froſt.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Two others were afterwards ſeen by Mr Tunſtall ; one on July the 30fb, about 11 o’clock, which laſted&nbsp;about a quarter of an hour, without colours. The other,&nbsp;which appeared on Friday october 18. was &quot; perhaps&nbsp;the moſt extraordinary one of the kind ever ſeen. It&nbsp;was firſt viſible about nine o’clock, and continued, tho’&nbsp;with very different degrees of briſliancy, till paſt two.&nbsp;At firſt, though a ſtrongly marked bow, it was without&nbsp;colours; but afterwards they were very conſpicuous&nbsp;and vivid in the ſame form as in the folar, though faint-cr ; the red, green, and purple, were moſt diſtinguiſhable. About twelve it was the moſt ſplendid in ap-pearance ; its arc was confiderably a ſmaller ſegment of&nbsp;a circle than a folar ; its ſouth-eaſt limb firſt began to&nbsp;fail, and a conſiderable time before its final extinction :&nbsp;the wind was very high, nearly due weſt, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">moſt </span><span class="font2">part of</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2">the time, accompanied with a drizzling rain. It is </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font2">ſingular circumſtance, that three of theſe phenomena&nbsp;ſhould have been ſeen in ſo ſhort a time in one place, as&nbsp;they have been eſteemed ever ſince the time of Ariſtotle,&nbsp;who is ſaid to have been the firſt obſerver of them,&nbsp;and ſaw only two in 50 years, and ſince by Plot and&nbsp;Thoreſhy, almoſt the only two Engliſh authors who&nbsp;have fpoke of them, to be exceeding rare. They ſeem&nbsp;evidently to be occaſioned by a refraction in a cloud or&nbsp;turbid atmoſphere, and in general are indications of&nbsp;ſtormy and rainy weather : ſo bad a ſeaſon as the late&nbsp;ſummer having, I believe, ſeldom occurred in EngIand.&nbsp;Thoreſhy, indeed, fays, the one he obſerved was ſuc-ceeded by ſeveral days of fine ſerene weather. Ûne&nbsp;particular, rather fingular, in the ſecond, viz. of July&nbsp;the 30th, was its being ſix days after the full of thc&nbsp;moon; and the laſt, though of </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ſo </span><span class="font2">long a duration, was&nbsp;three days before the full : that </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font2">the 27th of February was exactly at the full, which ufed to be judged the&nbsp;only time they could be ſeen, though in the Encyclo-pedia there is an account that weidler obſerved one in&nbsp;1719, in the ſirſt quarter of the moon, with faint co-lours, and in very calm weather. No lunar iris, I ever&nbsp;heard or read of, laſted near ſo long as that on the 18th&nbsp;inſtant, either with or without colours.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the Gentleman’s Magazine for Auguſt 1788 we have an account of a lunar rainbow by a correſpondent&nbsp;who faw it. &quot; Οη Sunday evening the 17th of Auguſt (fays he), after two days, on both of which, par-ticularly the former, there had been a great deal of&nbsp;rain, together with lightning and thunder, juſt as the&nbsp;clocks were ſtriking nine, 23 hours after full moon,&nbsp;looking through my window, I was ſtruck with the appearance of ſomething in the ſky, which ſeemed like a&nbsp;rainbβw. Having never ſeen a rainbow by night, I&nbsp;thought it a very extraordinary phenomenon, and ha-ſtened to a place where there were no buildings to ob-ſtruct my view of the hemifphere : here I found that&nbsp;the phenomenon was no other than a lunar rainbow ;&nbsp;the moon was truly ‘ walking in brightneſs,’ brilliant&nbsp;as ſhe could be ; not a cloud was to be ſeen near her ;&nbsp;and over-againſt her, toward the north-weſt, or perhaps&nbsp;rather more to the north, was a rainbow, a vaſt arch,&nbsp;perfect in all its parts, not interrupted or broken as&nbsp;rainbows frequently are, but unremittedly viſible from&nbsp;one horizon to the other. In order to give ſome idea&nbsp;of its extent, it is neceſſary to ſay, that as I ſtood to-ward the weſtern extremity of the pariſh of Stoke&nbsp;Newington, it ſeemed to take its riſe from the weſt of&nbsp;Hampſtead, and to the end, perhaps, in the river Lea,,&nbsp;the eaſtern boundary of Tottenham ; its colour was&nbsp;white, cloudy, or greyiſh, but a part of its weſtern leg&nbsp;ſeemed to exhibit tints of a faint fickly green. I continued viewing it for ſome time, till it began to rain&nbsp;and at length the rain increafing, and the iky growing&nbsp;more hazy, I returned home about a quarter or 20 minutes paſt nine, and in ten minutes came out again ; but&nbsp;by that time all was over, the moon was darkened by&nbsp;clouds, and the rainbow of courſe vaniſhed.”</span></p>
