<p><span class="font2">consequently the smallest in area of the six South Welsh counties. Nearly the whole surface of Radnorshire is hilly or&nbsp;undulating, whilst the centre is occupied by the mountainous&nbsp;tract known as Radnor Forest, of which the highest point&nbsp;attains an elevation of 2163 ft. Towards the S. and S. E. the&nbsp;hills are less lofty, and the valleys broaden out into considerable&nbsp;plains abounding in rivulets. The hills for the most part&nbsp;present smooth, rounded outlines, and are covered with heather,&nbsp;bracken and short grass, though tracts of boggy soil in the&nbsp;uplands are not uncommon. There are rich pastures and&nbsp;numerous woods in the valleys of the Wye and Teme. The&nbsp;Wye Valley has long been celebrated for its beauty, while&nbsp;Radnor Forest and the wild district of Cwmdauddwr present&nbsp;striking views of primeval and unspoiled scenery. Radnorshire is well supplied with water, its principal river being the&nbsp;Wye (Gwy), which, after crossing the N. W. corner of the&nbsp;county, forms its boundary from Rhayader onward to the&nbsp;English border. Salmon, trout and grayling are plentiful,&nbsp;and the Wye is consequently much frequented by anglers; as&nbsp;are also its tributaries—the Elan (which has been utilized for&nbsp;the great Birmingham reservoirs) the Ithon, the Edw or Edwy,&nbsp;the Lug, the Arrow and the Somergil. The Teme, which&nbsp;divides Radnor from Shropshire on the N. E., is a tributary of&nbsp;the Severn. All these streams are clear and rapid, and abound&nbsp;in fish. In the numerous rocky ravines of the mountainous&nbsp;districts are found many waterfalls, of which the most celebrated&nbsp;is “ Water-break-its-Neck, ” to the W. of New Radnor. Omitting the artificially constructed reservoirs in the valleys of the&nbsp;Elan and Claerwen, the lakes of Radnorshire arc represented&nbsp;only by a few pools of which Llynbychlyn near Painscastle is&nbsp;the largest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Geology. —</span><span class="font1">Ordovician rocks occupy most of the western side of the county, they are succeeded eastward by the Silurian formations,&nbsp;the Llandovery, Wenlock and Ludlow beds in the order here given.&nbsp;East of New Radnor an inlier of Wenlock rocks is surrounded by&nbsp;Ludlow beds; while at Old Radnor a ridge of very ancient rocks&nbsp;appears. In the south-east of the county Old Red Sandstone&nbsp;rests upon the Silurian. Between Llandrindod, where there are&nbsp;saline, sulphurous and chalybeate wells, and Builth, is a disturbed&nbsp;area of Ordovician strata with masses of andesitic and diabasic&nbsp;igneous rocks. In the vicinity of Rhayader the strata have been&nbsp;classed as the Rhayader pale shales (Tarannon), the Caban group&nbsp;(Upper Llandovery), the Gwastaden group (Lower Llandovery);&nbsp;these rest upon shales of Bala age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Climate and Industries. —</span><span class="font1">The climate of Radnorshire is bracing, if somewhat bleak, and the rainfall is not so heavy as in the neigh-bouring counties of Montgomery and Brecknock, but thick drizzling&nbsp;mists are of constant occurrence. The winters are often very&nbsp;severe, and deep snowfalls are. not uncommon. Good hay and&nbsp;tolerable crops of cereals are raised in the valleys, and the margin&nbsp;of cultivation has risen considerably since 1880. The extensive&nbsp;upland tracts, which still cover over one-third of the total area of&nbsp;the county, afford pasturage for mountain ponies and for large&nbsp;flocks of sheep. The quality of the wool of Radnorshire has long&nbsp;been celebrated, and also the delicacy of the Welsh mutton of the&nbsp;small sheep that are bred in this county. The most important&nbsp;sheep fairs are held at Rhayader, which also contains some woollen&nbsp;factories. There are practically no mining industries, nor are the&nbsp;quarries of great value. The valley of the Wye is rich in medicinal&nbsp;springs, and the saline, sulphur and chalybeate waters </span><span class="font2">of </span><span class="font1">Llandrindod have long been famous and profitable, and are growing in&nbsp;popular esteem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Communications. </span><span class="font1">—The Central Wales branch of the London &amp; North-Western railway enters the county at Knighton, traverses&nbsp;it by way of Llandrindod and passes into Brecknock at Builth&nbsp;Road Junction on the Wye. The Cambrian railway, after passing&nbsp;through the N. W. corner of the county to Rhayader, follows the&nbsp;course of the Wye, by way of Builth and Hay. Two small branch&nbsp;lines connect New Radnor and Presteign with the system of the&nbsp;Great Western.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Population and Administration.—</span><span class="font2">The area </span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font2">Radnorshire is 301,164 acres, and the population in 1891 was 21,791, while in&nbsp;1901 it had risen to 23, 362; an increase chiefly due to the&nbsp;immigration of outside labourers to the Elan Valley waterworks.&nbsp;There is no existing municipal borough, although New Radnor,&nbsp;now a mere village with 405 inhabitants (1901), was incorporated&nbsp;in 1561 and its municipal privileges were not formally abolished&nbsp;till 1883. The chief towns are Presteign (pop. 1245);&nbsp;Llandrindod (1827); Knighton (2139), and Rhayader (1215);</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">all, except Rhayader, being urban districts. Radnorshire is included in the South Wales circuit, and assizes are held at&nbsp;Presteign, which ranks as the county town. There is no existing parliamentary borough, and the whole county returns&nbsp;one member to parliament. Ecclesiastically, Radnorshire is&nbsp;divided into 46 parishes, of which 38 lie in the diocese of&nbsp;St Davids, and 8 in that of Hereford.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">History. —</span><span class="font2">The wild district of Maesyfed (a name of which the derivation is much disputed), corresponding substantially with&nbsp;the modern Radnorshire, originally formed part of the territory&nbsp;of the Silures, who were vanquished by the Romans. Christianity seems to have been introduced into this barren region&nbsp;during the 5th and 6th centuries by itinerant Celtic missionaries,&nbsp;notably by St David, St Padarn and St Cynllo. Towards the&nbsp;close of the 9th century Maesyfed was absorbed into the middle&nbsp;kingdom of Powys, and in the 10th century it was included in the&nbsp;realm of Elystan Glodrudd, prince of Fferlys, or Feryllwg, who&nbsp;ruled over all land lying between the Wye and Severn. In the&nbsp;reign of William the Conqueror, the Normans began to penetrate&nbsp;into Maesyfed, where, according to Domesday Book, the king&nbsp;already laid claim to Radenoure, or Radnor (a name of doubtful&nbsp;meaning), in the lordship of Melenith (Moelynaidd), which was&nbsp;subsequently bestowed on the Mortimer family, when castles&nbsp;were erected at Old Radnor (Penygraig), New Radnor and&nbsp;Cefnllys. Later, the Norman invaders forced their λvay up the&nbsp;Wye Ýalley, the de Breos family, lords of Elvel (Elfael), building fortresses at Painscastle and at Colwyn or Maud’s Castle.&nbsp;In 1188 Archbishop Baldwin, accompanied by Ranulf de Glanville and Giraldus Cambrensis, entered Wales for the purpose of&nbsp;preaching the Third Crusade, and was met in full state at New&nbsp;Radnor by the Lord Rhys, prince of South Wales. The Wye&nbsp;Valley long formed one of the debatable districts between&nbsp;Welsh and Normans, and in 1282 Llewelyn ap Griffith, prince of&nbsp;Wales, was at Aberedw shortly before his death in a skirmish&nbsp;near Builth. After the annexation of Wales by Edward I., the&nbsp;district of Maesyfed remained under the immediate jurisdiction&nbsp;of the Lords-Marchers, represented by the great families of&nbsp;Mortimer and Todeney. During the summer of 1402 Owen&nbsp;Glendower entered the Marches and raided the lands of the&nbsp;young Edward Mortimer, earl of March, whilst the royal troops&nbsp;were severely defeated at the battle of Bryn Glâs near Pilleth.&nbsp;By the Act of Union (1536) Maesyfed was erected out of the&nbsp;suppressed lordships into an English shire on the usual model.&nbsp;For administrative purposes it was now divided into six hundreds,&nbsp;and assizes were ordained to be held in alternate years at&nbsp;Presteign and New Radnor. The newly created county was&nbsp;likewise privileged to return two members to parliament; one&nbsp;for the county, and one for the united boroughs of New Radnor,&nbsp;Rhayader, Knighton, Cefnllys and Knucklas (Cnwclas). The&nbsp;parliamentary district of the Radnor boroughs was, however,&nbsp;disfranchised and merged in the county representation under&nbsp;the act of 1885. The shire of Radnor with its immense tracts&nbsp;of sheep-walk, its absence of large towns and its sparse rural&nbsp;population has always been reckoned the poorest and least&nbsp;important of the Welsh counties, nor since its creation under&nbsp;Henry VIII. has it ever played a prominent part in the national&nbsp;life of Wales. During the Commonwealth the local clergy were&nbsp;made to suffer severely under the drastic administration of&nbsp;Vavasor Powell (1617-1670), himself a Radnorshire man as&nbsp;a native of Knucklas. Of recent years the rise of Llandrindod&nbsp;as a fashionable watering-place and the construction of the&nbsp;Birmingham reservoirs in the Elan Valley have tended to&nbsp;increase the material prosperity of the county.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Among the leading families of Radnorshire, may be mentioned Lewis of Harpton Court; Baskerville of Clyro; Thomas&nbsp;(formerly Jones) of Pencerrig; Lewis-Lloyd of Nantgwyllt;&nbsp;Gwynne of Llanelwedd, and Prickard of Dderw.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Antiquities. —</span><span class="font2">Radnorshire contains numerous memorials of early British times, of which the entrenchment called Crug-y-buddair in the parish of Beguildy is specially worthy of note.&nbsp;Of Roman remains, the most important arc those of the fortified&nbsp;camp at Cwm near Llandrindod, which is believed to be identical</span></p>
