Similarly there were old dances called “ rounds,” in which the&nbsp;dancers stood in a circle or ring. They were popular in the&nbsp;16th and 17th centuries. Later the name was also applied to&nbsp;country dances where the dancers stood in two lines. For&nbsp;the “ round ” in music see Canon. A complaint or remonstrance signed by a number of persons is commonly known as&nbsp;a “ round robin ”; properly such a document should have the&nbsp;signatures arranged in a circle, the idea being that thus the&nbsp;order in which the complainants signed should be unknown.&nbsp;In the 16th century “ round robin ” was a name of mockery&nbsp;given to the Eucharist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROUNDERS,‘an English ball game, probably dating from the 18th century, but not attaining to any popularity before&nbsp;1800. It was the immediate ancestor of Baseball (g.t&gt;.). Up to&nbsp;the year 1889 no special code of rules existed, but the game was&nbsp;played on the green, the field being marked out in a regular&nbsp;pentagon by five bases about 15 or 20 yds. apart, called respectively </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">home-base</span><span class="font0"> (at which the striker stood), </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">1st base, 2nd base,&nbsp;3rd base,</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">4th base.</span><span class="font0"> The feeder, or bowler, stood in the&nbsp;middle of the pentagon and tossed the ball, which was softer&nbsp;than a cricket ball, to the striker, who with a round club, often&nbsp;a cricket stump, endeavoured to hit it as far out of the reach of&nbsp;the fielders as possible, a run being scored when the striker&nbsp;made the circuit of the bases without being put out. Almost&nbsp;any number of players could form a side, and the batsman&nbsp;would be retired when a batted ball was caught on the fly or&nbsp;first bounce, or when he was struck by having the ball thrown&nbsp;at him while running between bases. Rounders in its primitive&nbsp;form was more of a romp than a regular game, but it experienced&nbsp;a revival in Scotland and the north of England about the year&nbsp;1889, when two governing bodies were formed, the National&nbsp;Rounders Association of Liverpool and Vicinity and the Scottish Rounders Association. These, with the later Gloucester&nbsp;Rounders Association, drew up the rules now recognized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A hard ball similar to that used in baseball was adopted, and the rule by which a runner could be put out by hitting him with a&nbsp;thrown ball abandoned.. The bat must not exceed 3 J in. in diameter&nbsp;nor 35 in. in length. The game is similar to baseball, but there are&nbsp;several important differences, the most radical being that the ball&nbsp;may be hit in any direction, as at cricket. The original pentagon&nbsp;has been discarded in favour of an elongated diamond, the home-base being at one end and 1st, 2nd and 3rd bases at the other&nbsp;points, while the 4th base is situated on the line of 3rd base towards&nbsp;home and 17 yds. from the former, the sides of the diamond being&nbsp;22 yds. in length. The bowler stands in a space marked off in the&nbsp;centre of the diamond and tosses the ball to the batsman, who must&nbsp;hit at every “ good ” ball, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font0"> one that is straight over the home-base and between head and knee. Two bad balls score one for the&nbsp;batsman. If the latter hits the ball he. must run to 1st base and&nbsp;then 2nd, and so on round to home again, resting at any base; but&nbsp;he may be put out if the batted ball be caught on the fly or first&nbsp;bounce or the backstop (wicket-keeper in cricket) catch a ball&nbsp;struck at but not hit, or the batsman be touched with a ball while&nbsp;running between bases. Ten players constitute a side and three&nbsp;innings a piece are played, every player batting once in each innings.&nbsp;Each base made counts one. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">backstop</span><span class="font0"> is placed directly behind&nbsp;the batsman, and behind the backstop are placed </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">1st cover</span><span class="font0"> (right),&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">longstop.</span><span class="font0">(middle), and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">4th cover</span><span class="font0"> (left). The 25/,. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">2nd</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">3rd</span><span class="font0"> basemen&nbsp;are stationed at the bases, while behind them in the field are placed&nbsp;the.2nd </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">cover</span><span class="font0"> (right), </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">centre cover</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">3rd cover</span><span class="font0"> (left). The bases are&nbsp;designated by. light wooden posts. An umpire presides over the&nbsp;game. A variation of rounders is </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Fieldball,</span><span class="font0"> invented in 1888, a&nbsp;combination of rounders and cricket, a wicket being placed in front&nbsp;of the backstop, and the four bases arranged in a circle 25 yds.&nbsp;distant from each other. The bat and ball are similar to those&nbsp;used in baseball. Another variation is called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Baseball Rounders,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">which was invented in 1889 and is practically the same as baseball.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROUNDHEAD, a term applied to the adherents of the parliamentary party in England during the great Civil War. Some of the Puritans, but by no means all, wore the hair closely&nbsp;cropped round the head, and there was thus an obvious contrast&nbsp;between them and the men of fashion with their long ringlets.&nbsp;“ Roundhead ” appears to have been first used as a term of&nbsp;derision towards the end of 1641 when the debates in parliament on the Bishops Exclusion Bill were causing riots at Westminster. One authority says of the crowd which gathered&nbsp;there: “ They had the hair of their heads very few of them&nbsp;longer than their ears, whereupon it came to pass that those&nbsp;who usually with their cries attended at Westminster were&nbsp;by a nickname called Roundheads.” John Rush worth </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Historical Collections)</span><span class="font0"> is more precise. According to him the&nbsp;word was first used on the 27th of December 1641 by a disbanded officer named David Hide, who during a riot is reported&nbsp;to have drawn his sword and said he would “ cut the throat&nbsp;of those round-headed dogs that bawled against bishops.”&nbsp;Clarendon </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Hislory of the Rebellion,</span><span class="font0"> iv. 121) remarks on the&nbsp;matter: “ and from those contestations the two terms of&nbsp;* Roundhead ’ and * Cavalier * grew to be received in discourse, . . . they who were looked upon as servants to the&nbsp;king being then called * Cavaliers/ and the other of the rabble&nbsp;contemned and despised under the name of * Roundheads.’ ”&nbsp;Baxter ascribes the origin of the term to a remark made by&nbsp;Queen Henrietta Maria at the trial of Strafford; referring to&nbsp;Pym, she asked who the roundheaded man was. The name&nbsp;remained in use until after the revolution of 1688.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Roundhead was also&quot;used during the Civil War as the name of a weapon. This is described as having “ an head about a quarter of&nbsp;a yard long, a staffe of two yards long put into their head, twelve&nbsp;iron pikes round about, and one in the end to stop with.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROUNDSMAN SYSTEM (sometimes termed the billet, or ticket, or item system), in the English poor law, a plan by&nbsp;which the parish paid the occupiers of property to employ&nbsp;the applicants for relief at a rate of wages fixed by the parish.&nbsp;It depended not on the services, but on the wants of the&nbsp;applicants, the employer being repaid out of the poor rate&nbsp;all that he advanced in wages beyond a certain sum. According to this plan the parish in general made some agreement&nbsp;with a farmer to sell to him the labour of one or more paupers&nbsp;at a certain price, paying to the pauper out of the parish funds&nbsp;the difference between that price and the allowance which&nbsp;the scale, according to the price of bread and the number of&nbsp;his family, awarded to him. It received the local name of&nbsp;billet or ticket system from the ticket signed by the overseer&nbsp;which the pauper in general carried to the farmer as a warrant&nbsp;for his being employed, and afterwards took back to the overseer, signed by the farmer, as a proof that he had fulfilled&nbsp;the conditions of relief. In other cases the parish contracted&nbsp;with a person to have some work performed for him by the&nbsp;paupers at a given price, the parish paying the paupers. In&nbsp;many places the roundsman system was carried out by means&nbsp;of an auction, all the unemployed men being put up to sale&nbsp;periodically, sometimes monthly or weekly, at prices varying&nbsp;according to the time of year, the old and infirm selling for&nbsp;less than the~ able-bodied. The roundsman system disappeared&nbsp;on the reform of the poor law in 1834.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROUND TABLE, THE, in the Arthurian Romance (g.tf.), the table round which, in order to avoid quarrels as to precedence,&nbsp;King Arthur’s knights are seated, and so applied collectively&nbsp;to the knights themselves as the title of a mythical order of&nbsp;chivalry. The origin of the Round Table is obscure. Geoffrey&nbsp;of Monmouth makes no mention of it, and the earliest record&nbsp;is that of Wace, much expanded by his translator, Layamon,&nbsp;who gives a picturesque detailed description of the fight for&nbsp;precedence which took place at Arthur’s board on a certain&nbsp;Yuletide day, and the slaughter which ensued. For this&nbsp;slaughter Arthur took summary vengeance, slaying all the&nbsp;kinsfolk of the man who started the fight, and cutting off the&nbsp;noses of his women-folk. For the future avoidance of any&nbsp;such scenes a cunning workman of Cornwall offered to make&nbsp;a table which should seat 1600 knights and more, and at which&nbsp;all should be equal. Arthur accepted this offer, and the result&nbsp;was the Round Table, peace and harmony. Wace does not&nbsp;mention the number of knights.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">These versions of the pseudo-chronicles practically ascribe the foundation to Arthur; the romances, however, differ.&nbsp;In these either Merlin made the tabic for Uther Pendragon,</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
