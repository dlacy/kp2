the ancient royal reſidence of the kings of Persia, built by Darius Hyſtaſpis, according to Pliny ; though he probably only reſtored it, being a very ancient city, founded by Tithonus father of Memnon. It was in compaſs 120 ſtadia, of an oblong quadrangular form, with a citadel called <hi rend="italic">Memnοneum.</hi> In ſcripture it is called <hi rend="italic">Suſan,</hi> the royal citadel, from the great number of lilies growing in that diſtrict (Athenaeus) ; situate on the river Uhlai, or Eulæus (Daniel) : and the Spaniards call at this day a lily <hi rend="italic">aſuſena</hi> (Pinedo). Suſa was the winter, as Ecbatana was the ſummer, reſidence of the kings of Persia, (Xenophon, Strabo, Plutarch). Here the kings kept their treaſure, (Herodotus.) Now called <hi rend="italic">Tuster.</hi></p></div></body></text></TEI>
