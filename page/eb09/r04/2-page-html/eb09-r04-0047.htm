<p><span class="font1">Sigismund Augustus. From his retreat he commenced a correspondence with Ivan, in which he reproached him for&nbsp;his many cruelties. Ivan in his answer declared that he&nbsp;was quite justified in taking the lives of his slaves, if he&nbsp;thought it right to do so. While living in Lithuania,&nbsp;Kurbski appeared as the defender of the Greek faith,&nbsp;which was being undermined by the Jesuits. He died in&nbsp;exile in 1583. Kurbski was a fluent writer, but Bestu-zheff Riumin thinks that his hatred of Ivan led him to&nbsp;exaggerate, and he regrets that Karamzin should have&nbsp;followed him so closely. Besides the answers of Ivan to&nbsp;Kurbski, there is his letter to Cosmas, and the brotherhood of the Cyrillian monastery on the White Lake (Bielo&nbsp;Ozero), in which he reproaches them for the self-indulgent&nbsp;lives they are leading. Other works of the 16th century&nbsp;are the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Stepennaya Kniga,</span><span class="font1"> or “Book of Degrees ” (“ or Pedigrees”), in which historical events are grouped under the&nbsp;reigns of the grand-dukes, whose pedigrees are also given ;&nbsp;and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Life of the Czar Eeodor Ivanovich</span><span class="font1"> (1584-1598),&nbsp;written by the patriarch Job. To the beginning of the&nbsp;17th century belongs the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chronograph</span><span class="font1"> of Sergius Kubasoff&nbsp;of Tobolsk. His work extends from the creation of the&nbsp;world to the accession of Michael Romanoff, and contains&nbsp;interesting accounts of such of the inembers of the Russian&nbsp;royal family as Kubasoff had himself seen. Something&nbsp;of the same kind must have been the journal of Prince&nbsp;Mstislavski, which he showed the English ambassador&nbsp;Jerome Horsey, but which is now lost. @@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">To the time of the first Romanoffs belongs the story of the siege of Azoff, a prose poem, which tells us, in an&nbsp;inflated style, how in 1637 a body of Cossacks triumphantly repelled the attacks of the Turks. They had&nbsp;seized this town, which they were anxious to hand over to&nbsp;the czar Michael, but circumstances were not ripe for it.&nbsp;There is also an account of the siege of the Troitza&nbsp;monastery by the Poles during the “Smutnoye Vremya,” or&nbsp;Period of Troubles, as it is called,—that which deals with&nbsp;the adventures of the false Demetrius and the Polish&nbsp;invasion which followed. But all these are surpassed by&nbsp;the work on Russia of Gregory Karpoff Kotoshikhin. He&nbsp;served in the ambassador’s office </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(posolski prikaz),</span><span class="font1"> and&nbsp;when called upon to give information against his colleagues fled to Poland about 1664. Thence he passed into&nbsp;Sweden and wrote his account of Russia at the request of&nbsp;Count Delagardie, the chancellor of that country. He&nbsp;was executed about 1669 for slaying in a quarrel the&nbsp;master of the house in which he lived. The manuscript&nbsp;was found by Prof. Solovieff (not the eminent historian&nbsp;lately deceased) at Upsala and printed in 1840. A new&nbsp;edition has recently appeared, and Prof. Grote has collected some fresh facts about the author’s life, but we&nbsp;have no space here for a minute examination of them.&nbsp;The picture which Kotoshikhin draws of his native country&nbsp;is a sad one : ignorance, cruelty, and superstition are&nbsp;seen everywhere rampant. His work is of great importance, since it is from his description, and the facts we&nbsp;gather from the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Domostroi,</span><span class="font1"> that we can reconstruct the&nbsp;Old Russia of the time before Peter the Great, as in our&nbsp;days the valuable labours of M. Zabielin have done in&nbsp;his work on Russian domestic life. Perhaps, as an exile&nbsp;from his country, Kotoshikhin has allowed himself to write&nbsp;too bitterly. A curious work is the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Uriadnik Sokol-nichia Puti</span><span class="font1"> (“ Directions for Falconry”), which was written&nbsp;for the use of the emperor Alexis, who, like many Russians</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">of old time, was much addicted to this pastime. The Serb, Yuri Krizhanich, who wrote in Russian, was the first Pan-slavist, anticipating Kollar by one hundred and fifty years&nbsp;or more. He wrote a critical Servian grammar (with&nbsp;comparison of the Russian, Polish, Croatian, and White&nbsp;Russian), which was edited from the manuscripts by&nbsp;Bodianski in 1848. For his time he had a very good&nbsp;insight into Slavonic philology. His Panslavism, however, sometimes took a form by no means practical. He&nbsp;went so far as to maintain that a common Slavonic&nbsp;language might be made for all the peoples of that race,—&nbsp;an impossible project which has been the dream of many&nbsp;enthusiasts. From some unexplained cause he was banished to Siberia, and finished his grammar at Tobolsk.&nbsp;He also wrote a work on the Russian empire, which&nbsp;was edited by Beszonoff in 1860. In it he shows himself a widely-read man, and with very extensive Western&nbsp;culture. The picture drawn, as in the corresponding&nbsp;production of Kotoshikhin, is a very gloomy one. The&nbsp;great remedy suggested by the Serb is education. To&nbsp;this period belongs the life of the patriarch Nikon by&nbsp;Shusherin. The struggles of Nikon with the czar, and&nbsp;his emendations of the sacred books, which led to a&nbsp;great schism in Russia, are well known. They have been&nbsp;made familiar to Englishmen by the eloquent pages of&nbsp;Dean Stanley. @@<sup>2</sup> At Aloscow may be seen the portrait&nbsp;of this celebrated divine and his tomb ; his robes, which&nbsp;have been preserved, show him to have been a man of 7&nbsp;feet in stature. The mistakes which had crept into the&nbsp;translation of the Scriptures, from the blunders of generations of copyists, were frequently of a ludicrous character;&nbsp;still, a large number of the people preferred retaining them,&nbsp;and from this revision may be dated the rise of the&nbsp;Raskolniks (Dissenters) or Staro-obriadtzi (those who&nbsp;adhere to the old ritual). With the name of Simeon&nbsp;Polotzki (1628-1680) the old period of Russian literature&nbsp;may be closed. He was tutor to the czar Feodor, son of&nbsp;Alexis, and may be said in a way to have helped to&nbsp;introduce the culture of the West into Russia, as he was&nbsp;educated at Kieff, then a portion of Polish territory.&nbsp;Polotzki came to Moscow about 1664. He wrote religious&nbsp;works </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Vienetz Vierî,</span><span class="font1"> “The Garland of Faith,”) and&nbsp;composed poems and religious dramas </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(The Prodigal Son,&nbsp;Nebuchadnezzar,</span><span class="font1"> &amp;c.). He has left us some droll verses on&nbsp;the czar’s new palace of Kolomenskoe, which are very&nbsp;curious doggerel. The artificial lions that roared, moved&nbsp;their eyes, and walked especially delighted him. Alexis&nbsp;had probably ordered something to be constructed resembling the machinery we find mentioned in the Byzantine&nbsp;writers. There does not seem to be any ground for the&nbsp;assertion (often met with even in Russian writers) that&nbsp;Sophia, the sister of Peter the Great, was acquainted with&nbsp;French, and translated some of the plays of Moliere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">And now all things were to be changed as if by an enchanter’s wand. Russia was to leave her martyrologies&nbsp;and historical stories and fragmentary chronicles, and to -adopt the forms of literature in use in the West. One of&nbsp;the chief helpers of Peter the Great in the education of&nbsp;the people was Feofane (Theophanes) Procopovich, who&nbsp;advocated the cause of science, and attacked unsparingly&nbsp;the superstitions then prevalent ; the cause of conservatism&nbsp;was defended by Stephen Yavorski. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rock of Faith&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">of the latter was written to refute the Lutherans and&nbsp;Calvinists. Another remarkable writer of the times of&nbsp;Peter the Great was Pososhkoff, who produced a valuable&nbsp;work on </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Poverty and Riches,</span><span class="font1"> a kind of treatise on political&nbsp;economy. Antiokh Kantemir (1708-1744), son of a&nbsp;former hospodar of Moldavia, wrote some clever satires&nbsp;still read ; they are imitated from Boileau. He also</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
