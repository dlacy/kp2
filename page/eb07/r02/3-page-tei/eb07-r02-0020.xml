appreciating the share which each co-operating circumstance has had in producing the very intricate and complicated effect. It adds some weight to the principles on which he has proceeded in this analysis of the mechanism of hydraulic motion, and must give us great confidence in a theory so fairly established on a very copious induction. The author offers it only as a rational and well-founded probability. To this character it is certainly entitled ; for the suppositions made in it are agreeable to the most distant notions we can form of these internal motions. And it must always be remembered, that the investigation of the formula, although it be rendered somewhat more perspicuous by thus having recourse to those motions, has no dcpendence on the truth of the principles. For it is, in fact, nothing but a classification of experiments, which are grouped together by some one circumstance of slope, velocity, form of section, &amp;c. in order to discover the law of the changes which are induced by a variation of the circumstances which do not resemble. The procedure is precisely similar to that of the astronomer when he deduces the elements of an orbit from a multitude of observations. This was the task of the Chevalier du Buat; and he candidly and modestly informs us, that the finding out analytical forms of expression which would exhibit those changes, was the work of Mr Benezech de St Honore, an officer of engineers, and his colleague in the experimental course. It does honour to his skill and address ; and we think the w-hole both a pretty and instructive specimen of the method of discovering the laws of nature in the midst of complicated phenomena. Daniel Bernoulli first gave the rules of this method, and they have been greatly improved by Lambert, Condorcet, and De la Grange. Mr Coulomb has given some excellent examples of their application to the discovery of the laws of friction, of magnetical and electrical attraction, &amp;c. But this present work is the most perspicuous and familiar of them all. It is the empirical method of generalising natural phenomena, and of deducing general rules, of which we can give no other demonstration but that they are faithful representations of matters of fact. We hope that others, encouraged by the success of Du Buat, will follow this example, w here public utility is preferred to a display of mathematical knowledge.</p><p>Although the author may not have hit upon the precise <hi rend="italic">modus operandi,</hi>  we agree with him in thinking that nature seems to act in a way not unlike what is here supposed. At any rate, the range of experiments is so extensive, and so multifarious, that few cases can occur which are not included among them. The experiments will always retain their value (as we presume that they are faithfully narrated), whatever may become of the theory ; and we are confident that the formula will give an answer to any question to which it may be applicable, infinitely preferable to the vague guess of the most sagacious and experienced engineer.</p><p>We must however observe, that as the experiments on pipes were all made with scrupulous care in the contrivance and execution of the apparatus, excepting only those of Mr Couplet on the main pipes at Versailles, we may presume that the formula gives the greatest velocities which can be expected. In ordinary works, where joints are rough or leaky, where drops of solder hang in the inside, where cocks intervene with deficient water-ways, where pipes have awkward bendings, contractions, or enlargements, and where they may contain sand or air, we should reckon on a smaller velocity than what results from our calculation ; and we presume that an undertaker may with confidence promise four fifths of this quantity without any risk of disappointing his employer. We imagine that the actual performance of canals will be much nearer to the formula.</p><p>We have made inquiry after works of this kind executed in Britain, that we might compare them with the formula. But all our canals are locked and without motion ; and we have only learned by an accidental information from Mr Watt, that a canal in his neighbourhood, which is eighteen feet wide at the surface, and seven feet at the bottom, and four feet deep, and has a slope of one inch in a quarter of a mile, runs with the velocity of seventeen inches per second at the surface, ten at the bottom, and fourteen in the middle. If we compute the motion of this canal by our formula, we shall find the mean velocity to be 13¼.</p><p>No river in the world has had its motion so much scrutinized as the Po about the end of the last century. It had been a subject of 100 years’ continual litigation between the inhabitants of the Bolognese and theFerrarese, whether the waters of the Rheno should be thrown into the Tronco de Venezia or Po Grande. This occasioned very numerous measures to be taken of its sections and declivity, and the quantities of water which it contained in its different states of fulness. But, unfortunately, the long-established methods of measuring waters which were in force in Lombardy, made no account of the velocity ; and not all the entreaties of Castelli, Grandi, and other moderns, could prevail on the visitors in this process to deviate from the established methods. We have therefore no minute accounts of its velocity, though there are many rough estimates to be met with in that valuable collection published at Flo</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
