Ir is of a duſky or dark grey co-lour, with many ſmall Paining cryſtals, having a granular texture, and acquiring an oc'nry cruſt by expoſure to the air. The ſpecific gravity is 2748. It becomes magnetic by being heated in an open fire. In a ſtrong fire it melts without addition, but with morc difficulty than baſaltes. It was analyſed by Dr withering, who found that 100 parts of it contain 47.5 of ſihceous earth, 32.5 of argil, and 20 of iron.</hi></p><p>RAGMAN’s roll, Rectius Ragimund’s rol!, fo called from one Ragimund a legate in Scotland, who calling before him all the beneſiced clergymen in that kingdom, cauſed them on oath to give in <hi rend="italic">the true value</hi>  of their benefices ; according to which they were afterwards taxed by the court of Rome; and this roll, among other records, being taken from the Scots by Edward I. was redelivered to them in the beginning of the reign of Edward III.</p><p>RAGOUT, or Ragoo, a fauce, or feafoning, in-tended to rouſe the appetite .when loſt or languiihing.</p><p>This term is alſo uſed for any high-feafoned diſh pre-pared of fleſh, fiſh, greens, or the like : by ſtewing them with bacon, ſalt, pepper, cloves, and the like ingredients, we have ragouts of celery, of endive, aſparagiis, cock’s combs, giblets, craw-fiſh, &amp;c.</p><p>The ancients had a ragout called <hi rend="italic">garum,</hi>  made of the putrified guts of a certain fiſh kept till it diſſolved into a mere fanies, which was thought ſuch a dainty, that, according to Pliny, its price equalled that of the richeſt perfumes.</p><p>RAGSTONE, a genus of ſtones belonging to the •claſs of filiceous earths. It is of a grey colour ; the texture obſcurely laminar, or rather, fibrous ; but the laminæ or fibres confiſt of a congeries of grains of a quartzy appearance, coarſe and rough. The ſpeciſic gravity is 2729 ; it eſſerveſces with acids, and ſtrikes lire with ſteel. Mr Kirwan found it to contain a portion of mild calareous earth, and a ſmall proportion of iron. It is uſed’tis a whetſtone for coarſe cutting took. It is found about Newcaſtle, and many other parts of Eng-land, where there are large rocks of it in the hills.</p><p>RAGULED, or Ragged, in heraldry, jagged or knotted. This term is applied to a croſs formed of the trunks of two trees without their branches, of which they ſhow only the ſtumps. <hi rend="italic">Raguled</hi>  differs from <hi rend="italic">indented,</hi>  in that the latter is regular, the former not.</p><p>RAGUSA, an ancient town of Sicily, in the Val-di-Noto, near the river Maulo, 12 miles north of Mυ-dica.

It is about two miles in circumference, is pretty well built, and ſtrong by ſituation, having an inaeceſ-</hi>fible mountain on the land-ſide, and on the fide cf the ſea a ſtrong fort. It has -an archbiſhop’s ſee and a republic, and has a doge like that of Venice, but he con tinues a month only in his office. It carries on a con-ſiderable trade with the Turks, and is 60 miles north-weſt cf Scutari, and Ho north of Brindiſi. E. Long. 18. 10. N.

Some of the rajas are ſaid to preferve their independen-cy, efpecially in the mountainous parts ; but moſt of them pay an annual tribute to the Mogul.

There are five fpiracula below towards the peak ; the body compreffed ; and the mouth is ſituated under the head. The moſt remarkable ſpecies are,</p><p>I. The batis, or ſkate : this ſpecies is the thinncſt in proportion to its bulk of any of the genus, and alſo the largeſt, fome weighing near 200 pounds. The noſe, though not long, is ſharp pointed ; above the eyes is a fet of ſhort ſpines: the upper part is of a pale brown, fometimes ſtreaked with black : tbe lower part is white, marked with great numbers of minute black, ſpots. The jaws are covered with ſmall granulated but ſharp-pointed teeth. The tail is of a moderate length : near the end are two fins : along the top of it is one row of ſpines, and on the edges are irregularly diſperſed a few others, which makes us imagine with Mr Ray, that in thia reſpect theſe fiſh vary, ſome having one, others more orders of ſpines on the tail. It is remarked, that in the males of this ſpecies thc fins arc full of fpines. Skates generate in March and April ; at which time they ſwim near the ſurface of the water, ſeveral of the males purſuing one female. They adhcre ſo faſt together in coition, that the fiſher-men frequently draw up both together, though only one has taken the bait. The females begin to caſt their <hi rend="italic">purſes,</hi>  as the ſiſhermen call them (the bags in which the young are included) in May, and continue doing it till September. In october they are exceedingly poor and thin ; but in November they begin to improve, and grow gradually better till May, when they are in the higheſt perfection. The males go ſooner out of ſeaſon than the females.</p><p>2. The oxyrinchus, or ſharp-noſed ray, in length near feven feet, and breadth five feet two inches ; when juſt brought on ſhore, it makes a remarkable fnorting noiſe·. The noſe is very long, narrow, and ſharp-pointed, not unlike the end of a ſpontoon. The body is ſmooth, and very thin in proportion to the fize ; the upper part aſh-coloured, ſpotted with numerous white ſpots, and a few black ones. The tail is thick ; towards the end are two ſmall fins ; on each fide is a row of ſmall ſpines, with another row in the middle, which runs ſome way up the back. The lower part of the fiſn is quite white. The mouth is very large, and furniſhed with numbers of ſmall ſharp teeth bending inwards. This ſiſh has been ſuppoled to be the <hi rend="italic">los</hi>  of the anci-3</p></body></text></TEI>
