<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">practising that doctrine. So they are founded by indi- | viduals—founded, not instituted or organized, for that as&nbsp;a rule is done by the generation which follows that of the&nbsp;founder—and not always by one single person, but in&nbsp;some cases by a body of priests or teachers. This fundamental doctrine and the system based on it are considered&nbsp;by the adherents to be a divine revelation, and he who&nbsp;first revealed it, or is thought to have revealed it, is considered as an inspired prophet or a son of God. Nay, even&nbsp;if the primitive teaching had an atheistic tendency, as in&nbsp;the case of Buddhism, it is this real or mythical teacher&nbsp;whom they not only revere, but worship as their supreme&nbsp;deity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">We now come to the subdivisions of each of the two principal categories. And here we cannot silently pass by&nbsp;the classification of the least advanced religions proposed&nbsp;by Prof. Pfleiderer (</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Religionsphilosophie auf geschichtlicher&nbsp;Grundlage,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> 2d ed. 1884, vol. ii.), which supersedes the&nbsp;complete classification of religions given by him in an&nbsp;earlier work </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Die Religion, ihr Wesen und ihre Geschichte).&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The latter was based on his conception of religion as the&nbsp;fusion of dependence and liberty, but has now been abandoned by the author.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">According to Pfleiderer the original religion must have been a kind of indistinct, chaotic naturism, being an&nbsp;adoration of the natural phenomena as living powers;&nbsp;and, as primitive man cannot have had consciousness of&nbsp;his superiority over the animals, nor of his personality and&nbsp;his spiritual nature, he could not conceive these divine&nbsp;powers as personal, or spiritual, or anthropomorphic, but&nbsp;only as living beings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Then from this primitive naturism sprang :—(1) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">anthropomorphic polytheism,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> which is decidedly an advance on mythopoeic naturism, as it brings the personal gods into&nbsp;relation with the moral life of man, but at the same time&nbsp;has its drawback since it attributes all human passions,&nbsp;faults, and sins to the gods; (2) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">spiritism (animism),&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">combined with a primitive idolatry, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">fetichism,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> each of&nbsp;them not an advance but rather a depravation of religion,&nbsp;caused by the decadence of civilization, which inevitably&nbsp;followed the dispersion and isolation of tribes previously&nbsp;united; (3) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">henotheism,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> not the henotheism of Max&nbsp;Müller, or of Hartmann, or of Asmus, but a practical&nbsp;henotheism, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> the adoration of one God above others as&nbsp;the specific tribal god or as the lord over a particular&nbsp;people, a national or relative monotheism, like that of the&nbsp;ancient Israelites, the worship of an absolute sovereign&nbsp;who exacts passive obedience. This practical monotheism&nbsp;is totally different from the theoretical monotheism, to&nbsp;which the Aryans, with their monistic speculative idea&nbsp;of the godhead, are much nearer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Passing by the primitive naturism, which is only a matter of speculation, we are bound to admit the real existence of the other three classes specified by Pfleiderer. Only&nbsp;the order in which they are arranged must be changed.&nbsp;For, if spiritism or animism sprang from a primitive not&nbsp;yet animistic naturism, at the same time with, though&nbsp;under different circumstances from, anthropomorphic polytheism and henotheism, how then shall we explain so&nbsp;many traces and remains of a previous animistic belief in&nbsp;each of the latter religious developments 1 They too must&nbsp;have gone through an animistic stage. And, on the other&nbsp;hand, some traces even of anthropomorphic mythology are&nbsp;not totally wanting in the animistic religions of uncivilized&nbsp;tribes and barbarous nations,—though, of course, in this&nbsp;mythology manlike beings still stand on the same level&nbsp;as, if not much lower than, those having the shape of&nbsp;animals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The different stages of religious development have been characterized by C. P. Tiele </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Outlines of the History of</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Religion,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> § 3) as follows :—</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(a)</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> a period in which animism generally prevailed, still represented by the so-called nature&nbsp;religions (in the narrower sense), or rather by the polydae-monistic magical tribal religions; </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(b)</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> polytheistic national&nbsp;religions resting on a traditional doctrine ; </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(c)</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> nomistic (or,&nbsp;as Prof. Carlo Puini proposes to call them, nomothetic)&nbsp;religions, or religious communities founded on a law or&nbsp;sacred writing and subduing polytheism more or less completely by pantheism or monotheism; </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(d)</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> universal or&nbsp;world-religions, which start from principles and maxims.&nbsp;Though in general maintaining this division, at least for&nbsp;practical use, if we wish to draw up a morphological classification of religions, we shall have to modify and to complete it, and to arrange the different stages under the two&nbsp;principal categories of nature religions and ethical religions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Nature Religions.</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">—1. To the philosophy of religion we leave the solution of the difficult problem,—What may&nbsp;have been the state of religion before the oldest religion&nbsp;known to us sprang into being, and even before that&nbsp;animistic stage of development which we know only by&nbsp;its survivals in the higher and its ruins in the still&nbsp;existing lower religions'? Certain it is that the oldest&nbsp;religions must have contained the germs of all the later&nbsp;growth, and, though perhaps more thoroughly naturistic&nbsp;than the most naturistic now known, must have shown&nbsp;some faint traces at least of awakening moral feelings.&nbsp;Man, we think, in that primitive stage, must have regarded&nbsp;the natural phenomena on which his life and welfare&nbsp;depend as living beings, endowed with superhuman&nbsp;magical power; and his imagination, as yet uncontrolled&nbsp;by observation and reasoning, must frequently have given&nbsp;them the shape of frightful animals, monsters, portentous&nbsp;mythical beings, some of which still survive in the later&nbsp;mythologies. Perhaps the best name for this first stage of&nbsp;religious development might be the “polyzoic” stage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following naturistic stages are to be classified&nbsp;under three distinct heads :—</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(a)</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> polydaemonistic magical&nbsp;religions under the influence of animism; </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(b)</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> purified&nbsp;magical religions, in which animistic ideas still play a&nbsp;prominent part, but which have grown up to a therian-thropic polytheism; </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(c)</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> religions in which the powers of&nbsp;nature are worshipped as manlike though superhuman and&nbsp;semi-ethical beings, or anthropomorphic polytheism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Animism, which exercises a prominent influence on&nbsp;the religions of the first stage </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(a)</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> mentioned above, is a&nbsp;system by which man, having become conscious of the&nbsp;superiority of the spirit over the body and of its relative&nbsp;independence, tries to account for the phenomena of&nbsp;nature, which he, not having the slightest scientific&nbsp;knowledge either of nature or of mind, is unable to&nbsp;explain otherwise. It is not itself a religion, but a sort&nbsp;of primitive philosophy, which not only controls religion,&nbsp;but rules the whole life of man in the childhood of the&nbsp;world. All things living and moving, or startling him by&nbsp;something strange and extraordinary, and of which he&nbsp;does not know the natural causes, he ascribes to the&nbsp;working of mighty spirits, moving freely through earth&nbsp;and air, and, now of their own accord now under compulsion, taking up their abode either temporarily or&nbsp;permanently in some living or some lifeless object. Only&nbsp;the powerful among these spirits, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">“</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> those on which man&nbsp;feels himself dependent, and before which he stands in&nbsp;awe, acquire the rank of divine beings,” and either as&nbsp;invisible or as embodied spirits become objects of worship&nbsp;(spiritism and fetichism). As the principal characteristics&nbsp;of those religions we have to consider—(1) a confused&nbsp;and indeterminate polydaemonistic mythology, though&nbsp;some spirits, especially those directing heavenly phenomena, are held to be more powerful than the others, and&nbsp;the supreme spirit of heaven is generally the mightiest of</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
