Hewasworsted in the first engagement, and the Goths succeeded in takingPhilippopolis; but Decius having recruited his forces, defeated them, and reduced them to the utmost distress. It was his aim to inflict upon them such an overthrow as should deter them from renewing their invasions of the empire. A battle was fought, in which the Goths, animated with the terrible energy and courage of despair, and being skilfully posted on the edge of a morass, resisted all the efforts of the Roman forces to break them ; and young Decius having fallen, the emperor, eager to revenge the death of his son, plunged furiously into the morass, sunk struggling into its absorbing depth, and disappeared. The Roman army suffered an immense loss, but the Goths were in no condition to prosecute their victory.</p><p>Gallus was proclaimed emperor by the surviving army, andhaving immediately concluded adishonourable peace with the Goths, hastened to Rome to enjoy the gratifications of unrestrained indulgence. His son Voluscan he created Cæsar, and contrived to get the son of Decius into his power, and put him to death. His conduct excited a general indignation against him ; and at length Æmilianus, commander of the forces in Mœsia, raised the standard of revolt against him. A battle was fought, in which Gallus was defeated and slain, his son sharing his fate. In three months, Æmilianus himself was deposed and killed, the army declaring in favour of Valerianus, general of the army stationed in Gaul.</p><p>Of Valerian, who had been distinguished by his virtues while in a private station, great expectations were formed. Having appointed his son Gallienus to be his associate in the empire, he left; him to defend it against the incursions of the Goths and Germans, and marched to the East to oppose the Persian king Sapor, or Shah Pur. Valerian was defeated and taken prisoner by the Persians, who treated him with great and contemptuous cruelty. His degenerate son Gallienus made no effort to obtain his release, being apparently more satisfied to reign alone.</p><p>The captivity of Valerian, and the accession of the feeble Gallienus, seemed to be the signal for a universal assault upon the defenceless empire. It was invaded on all sides by the hostile barbarians, who seemed to vie with each other in striving for the honour of being the destroyers of Rome. Several victories over the Germans were gained by the generals of Gallienus ; but each army resolving to make its own general emperor, a period of hopeless and helpless anarchy ensued, which threatened the immediate disruption of the empire. The host of competitors which thus sprung up in all quarters, is known by the designation of “ the thirty tyrants,” though not actually amounting to so many. The very number of these contending rivals impeded the success of any, no one being possessed of sufficient power to strike a decisive blow. At length Gallienus was killed while besieging Aureolus, one of the usurpers, in Milan.</p><p>He was succeeded by Marcus Aurelius Claudius, a man of great courage, skill, and virtue, capable of upholding the tottering state of tlle empire. He soon defeated Aureolus, then overcame the Germans, and next routed the Goths in a great battle at Nissa. His attention was next directed to the affairs of the East ; but while making preparations for his march thither, he was seized by a pestilential disease, of which he died at Sirmium, after having reigned two years.</p><p>A feeble attempt to obtain the imperial power was made by the brother of Claudius, which terminated after the lapse of seventeen days, by the unfortunate victim of ambition becoming his own executioner. The army now made choice of Aurelian, a native of Sirmium, the son of a peasant of that country, and raised to high military rank and fame by his own surpassing merits. It was reserved for this distinguished man to show what could be accomplished by an imperial hero. The hopes of the Goths had revived on the death of</p><p>Claudius, and they had renewed their invasion. They were met by Aurelian, and a bloody battle was fought, to which night, not victory on either side, gave a temporary suspension. Wearied with mutual slaughter, both parties were averse from renewing the undecided combat, and a treaty was formed, by which Aurelian consented to relinquish that part of Dacia which lay beyond the Danube, and to make the river the boundary ofhis empire in that direction. The Goths furnished a body of cavalry as auxiliaries to the Romans, and engaged to abstain from future invasion. By this treaty, Aurelian strengthened the Roman empire in that quarter, obtaining a well-defined boundary, and leaving to the enemy a devastated region, no longer worth defending.</p><p>The Alemanni, in the mean time, had entered the Roman dominions, and laid waste the country along the Po. Aurelian marched rapidly against them, inflicted on them several sanguinary defeats, and freed Italy from the terrors of the barbarian invaders. The Vandals also sunk before his matchless valour and conduct ; and having now secured the western part of the empire, he directed his arms against the east, to encounter a female antagonist.</p><p>This was the justly celebrated Zenobia (Zeinab) queen of Palmyra, widow of Odenathus, who had been one of the numerous claimants of imperial honours during the reign of Gallienus, and to whom that easy monarch had been willing to grant the title ofhis colleague. Palmyra, or Tad-mor, is stated in the Bible to have been built by Solomon. The situation of that beautiful spot, a green island in the midst of a sandy ocean, and almost equidistant between the Euphrates and the Phœnician coast, pointed it out to the wisest of kings as a suitable place for commercial enterprise, and admirably adapted to promote his great idea of changing the line of intercourse between the east and the west, from the Red Sea to the Euphrates, and rendering Palestine, not Egypt, the great emporium of nations. After the decline of the kingdom of Israel, this idea seems to have been relinquished ; but still Palmyra continued to form an excellent intermediate station between the Euphrates and Asia Minor, for the caravans employed in the Indian and Arabian trade. It thus grew in wealth, if not in political power or importance, yielding ready obedience to the great dominant empires, each in its turn, and seeking nothing from them but protection. From the Parthians it seems to have suffered no injury ; but the revolution which gave central Asia to the Sasanide dynasty, involved Palmyra in thc general warfare. Odenathus, said by some to have been an Arab Emir, was one of the most considerable of the inhabitants of Palmyra. Irritated by the insults of the Persians, and instigated by his high-spirited wife, Zenobia, he headed his countrymen in their resistance to the plundering bands of the Persian king, successively defeated them, and acquired sufficient power not only to rescue Palmyra, but even to carry the war into the enemy’s country, and to advance to the gates of Ctesiphon. In a short time all Mesopotamia and Syria owned his sway, and he was acknowledged as colleague by Gallienus. Odenathus having been cut off by private treachery, the falling sceptre of Palmyra was immediately seized by Zenobia, who wielded it with no timid or feeble hand. For the space of six years did she maintain her sway, and even added Egypt to her dominions, justifying the proud title she had assumed, Queen of the East. Such was the woman against whom Aurelian thought it no disgrace to lead in person his Roman legions.</p><p>The result was what might have been anticipated. Zenobia was defeated in two successive and bravely-contested battles ; Palmyra was besieged, and after a gallant resistance, its own resources being exhausted, it was compelled to capitulate, and Zenobia was taken prisoner while attempting to make her escape into Persia.
