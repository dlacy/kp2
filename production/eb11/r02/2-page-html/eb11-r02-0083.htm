<p><span class="font0">I. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vegetative Propagation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The simplest case of vegetative multiplication is afforded by unicellular plants. When the cell which constitutes the&nbsp;body of the plant has attained its limit of size it gives rise to&nbsp;two either by division or gemmation; the two cells then grow,&nbsp;and at the same time become separated from each other, so&nbsp;that eventually two new distinct individuals are produced,&nbsp;■each of which precisely resembles the original organism. A&nbsp;.good example of this is to be found in the germination of the&nbsp;yeast plant. This mode of multiplication is simply the result&nbsp;Of the ordinary processes of growth. All plant-cells grow and&nbsp;divide at some time or other of their life; but whereas in °&nbsp;multicellular plant the products of division remain coherent, and&nbsp;-add to the number of the cells of which the plant consists, in&nbsp;a unicellular plant they separate and constitute new individuals.&nbsp;In more highly organized plants vegetative propagation may&nbsp;be effected by the separation of the different parts of the&nbsp;body from each other, each such part developing the missing&nbsp;members and thus constituting a new individual. This takes&nbsp;place spontaneously in rhizomatous plants, in which the main&nbsp;stem gradually dies away from behind forwards; the lateral&nbsp;branches thus become isolated and constitute new individuals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The remarkable regenerative capacity of plant-members is largely made use of for the artificial propagation of plants.&nbsp;A branch removed from a parent-plant will, under appropriate&nbsp;conditions, develop roots, and so constitute a new plant; this&nbsp;is the theory of propagation by “ cuttings.” A portion of a&nbsp;root will similarly develop one or more shoots, and thus give&nbsp;rise to a new plant. An isolated leaf will, in many cases, produce&nbsp;a shoot and a root, that is, a new plant; it is in this way that&nbsp;new begonias, for instance, are propagated. The production of&nbsp;plants from leaves occurs also in nature, as, for instance, in&nbsp;certain so-called “ viviparous ” plants, of which </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bryophyllum&nbsp;Calycinum</span><span class="font1"> (Crassulaceae) and many ferns </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">[N ephr odium (Lastraea)&nbsp;Filix-mas, Asplenium (Athyrium) Filix-foemina</span><span class="font1"> and other&nbsp;species of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are examples. But it is in the mosses,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">■9f all plants, that the capacity for vegetative propagation is most widely diffused. Any part of a moss, whether it be the&nbsp;stem, the leaves, the rhizoids, or the sporogonium, is capable,&nbsp;under appropriate conditions, of giving rise to filamentous&nbsp;protonema, on which new moss-plants are then developed as&nbsp;lateral buds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In a large number of plants provision is made for vegetative propagation by the development of more or less highly specialized&nbsp;organs. In lichens, for instance, there are the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">soredia,</span><span class="font1"> which&nbsp;are minute buds of the thallus containing both algal and fungal&nbsp;•elements; these are set free on the surface in large numbers,&nbsp;and each grows into a thallus. In the Characeae there are the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bulbils</span><span class="font1"> or “ starch-stars ” of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chara Stelligera,</span><span class="font1"> which are underground nodes, and the branches with naked base and the pro-embryonic branches found by Pringsheim on old nodes of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chara&nbsp;fragilis.</span><span class="font1"> In the mosses small tuberous bulbils frequently occur&nbsp;■on the rhizoids, and in many instances </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Bryum annotinum,&nbsp;Aulacomnion androgynum, Tetraphis pellucida,</span><span class="font1"> &amp;c.) stalked&nbsp;fusiform or lenticular multicellular bodies containing chlorophyll,&nbsp;termed </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gemmae,</span><span class="font1"> are produced on the shoots, either in the axils&nbsp;of the leaves or in special receptacles at the summit of the stem.&nbsp;Gemmae of this kind are produced in vast numbers in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Marchantia&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lunularia</span><span class="font1"> among the liverworts. Similar gemmae are also&nbsp;produced by the prothallia of ferns. In some ferns (e.g. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Nephro-Iepis tuberosa</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">undulata)</span><span class="font1"> the buds borne on the leaves or in&nbsp;their axils become swollen and filled with nutritive materials,&nbsp;■constituting </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bulbils</span><span class="font1"> which fall off and give rise to new plants.&nbsp;This conversion of buds into bulbils, which subserve vegetative&nbsp;multiplication, occurs also occasionally among Phanerogams,&nbsp;as for instance in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lilium bulbiferum,</span><span class="font1"> species of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Poa, Polygonum&nbsp;viviparum,</span><span class="font1"> &amp;c. But many other adaptations of the same kind&nbsp;■occur among Phanerogams. Bulbous plants, for instance,&nbsp;produce each year at least one bulb or corm from which a new&nbsp;plant is produced in the succeeding year. In the potato, tubers&nbsp;are developed from subterranean shoots, each of which in the&nbsp;following year gives rise to a new individual. In the dahlia,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Thladiantha dnbia,</span><span class="font1"> &amp;c., tuberous swellings are found on the&nbsp;roots, from each of which a new individual may spring.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">IL </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">True Reproduction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This is effected by cells formed by the proper reproductive organs. These cells are of two principal kinds. There are,&nbsp;first, those cells each of which is capable of developing by itself&nbsp;into a new organism: these are the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">asexual</span><span class="font1"> reproductive cells,&nbsp;known generally as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">spores.</span><span class="font1"> Secondly, there are the cells which&nbsp;are incapable of independent germination; it is not until these&nbsp;cells have fused together in pairs that a new organism can be&nbsp;developed: these are the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sexual</span><span class="font1"> reproductive cells or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gametes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In some exceptional cases the normal mode of reproduction, sexual or asexual, does not take place: instead, the new organism&nbsp;is developed vegetatively from the parent. When sexual&nbsp;reproduction is suppressed the case is one of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">apogamy*,</span><span class="font1"> when&nbsp;asexual reproduction by spores is suppressed the case is one of&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">apospory.</span><span class="font1"> (Apogamy and apospory are discussed below in the&nbsp;section on </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Abnormalities of Reproduction.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Asexual Reproduction.—</span><span class="font1">Reproduction by means of some kind of spore (using the term in its widest sense, so as to include&nbsp;all asexually produced reproductive cells) is common to nearly&nbsp;all families of plants; it is wanting in certain Algae (Conjugatae,&nbsp;Fucaceae, Characeae), and in certain fungi </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(e.g.</span><span class="font1"> some Perono-sporeae). The structure of a spore is essentially this: it consists&nbsp;of a nucleated mass of protoplasm, enclosing, starch or oil as reserve nutritive material, usually invested by a cell-wall. In those&nbsp;cases in which the spore is capable of germinating immediately&nbsp;on its development the cell-wall is a single delicate membrane&nbsp;consisting of cellulose; but in those cases in which the spore&nbsp;may or must pass through a period of quiescence before germination the wall becomes thickened and may consist of two layers,&nbsp;an inner, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">endospore,</span><span class="font1"> which is delicate and consists of cellulose,&nbsp;and an outer, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">exospore,</span><span class="font1"> which is thick and rigid, frequently&nbsp;darkly coloured and beset externally with spines or bosses, and&nbsp;which consists of cutin. In some few cases among the fungi,&nbsp;multicellular or septate spores arc produced; these approximate&nbsp;somewhat to the gemmae mentioned above as highly specialized&nbsp;organs for vegetative propagation. In some cases, particularly&nbsp;among the algae, and also in some fungi (Peronosporeae,&nbsp;SaproIegnieae. Chytridiaceae, and the Myxomycetes), spores are&nbsp;produced which are usually destitute of any cell-wall, and are&nbsp;further peculiar in that they are motile, and are therefore termed&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">zoospores',</span><span class="font1"> they move sometimes in an amoeboid manner by the&nbsp;protrusion of pseudopodia, but more frequently they are provided&nbsp;with one, two, or many delicate vibratile protoplasmic filaments,&nbsp;termed </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">cilia,</span><span class="font1"> by the lashing of which the spore is propelled&nbsp;through the water. The zoospore eventually comes to rest,&nbsp;withdraws its cilia, surrounds itself with a cell-wall, and then&nbsp;germinates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the simplest case a single spore is developed from the cell of the unicellular plant, the protoplasm of which surrounds&nbsp;itself with the characteristic thick wall. This occurs only in&nbsp;plants of low organization such as the Schizophyta.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In other cases the contents of the cell undergo division, each portion of the protoplasm constituting a spore. Examples of&nbsp;this are afforded, among unicellular plants, by yeaçt and the&nbsp;Protococcaceae; and in multicellular plants by the Pandorineae,&nbsp;Confervaceae, Ulvaceae, &amp;c., where any cell of the body may&nbsp;produce spores.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In such cases the spore-producing cell may be regarded as a rudimentary reproductive organ of the nature of a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sporangium.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">In more highly organized plants special organs are differentiated&nbsp;for the production of spores. In the majority of cases the&nbsp;special organ is a sporangium, that is, a capsule in the interior&nbsp;of which the spores are developed; but in many fungi the&nbsp;spores are formed by abstriction from an organ termed a&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sporophore.</span><span class="font1"> In the Thallophyta the sporangium is commonly&nbsp;a single cell. In the Bryophyta it is a multicellular capsule.&nbsp;In the Pteridophyta the sporangium is multicellular, but simple&nbsp;in structure, and this is true also of the Phanerogams.</span></p>
