<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">This rule, again, will be modified by the position of the town or the district whence the traffic is to be derived, especially if the&nbsp;railway lies on the natural surface and adjoins a public road,&nbsp;whether crossing on the level or otherwise. This last condition is&nbsp;the most frequent one ; and, as some portion at least of the traffic&nbsp;must be expected to depart from the platform opposite to the offices,&nbsp;provision must be made for crossing with the least amount of&nbsp;danger to the public. When the passengers are numerous in both&nbsp;directions, over-bridges, as before stated, are objectionable; and&nbsp;in a surface-station an archway under the line is frequently impracticable. Some good authorities have adopted the plan of making&nbsp;the trains take up and set down the passengers at one platform&nbsp;only, when the platform may be made rather more than double the&nbsp;length of a single train, having crossings in the centre to communicate with both lines of rails, thus placing the trains when&nbsp;standing on the platform upon a loop-siding distinct from those&nbsp;lines. This system offers great convenience to the public when&nbsp;there is much first-class traffic and a large quantity of baggage ;&nbsp;and it is especially applicable when the station partakes of the&nbsp;character of a terminus, or is used as a receiver from branch or&nbsp;neighbouring lines, offering, as it does, great facilities for making&nbsp;up and receiving trains which may run over a portion only of the&nbsp;main lines, as well as for attaching and detaching the carriages&nbsp;intended or used for branch traffic,&nbsp;i The buildings and yards in junction stations may be placed in&nbsp;the fork between the two double lines of railway forming the&nbsp;junction, or beyond the point of junction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Locomotive stations comprise two departments,—the running : and the constructing and repairing of engines and tenders. The&nbsp;chief locomotive station of the Midland Railway at Derby may be&nbsp;taken as an example. It is contiguous to the passenger station,&nbsp;and is in communication with the main line by a number of&nbsp;sidings branching off at the north end of that station, near the&nbsp;bridge over the Derby Canal. The area of ground enclosed is&nbsp;about 80 acres, of which 12 are covered by buildings. The walls&nbsp;of the erecting shops are 284 feet high ; those of the fitting and&nbsp;other shops are 20. The tools are 693 in number. The number&nbsp;of locomotives housed at Derby station (1885) is 289. There is&nbsp;room in the erecting shops for seventy-one locomotives. The&nbsp;workshops are capable of turning out 120 engines per year—say,&nbsp;thirty new engines with tenders, and ninety engines with new&nbsp;boilers, cylinders, and other working parts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The carriage and waggon works of the Midland Railway at Derby are situated about half a mile south of the passenger&nbsp;station, with which they are connected by a double line of way&nbsp;branching out from the south end of the station. The works&nbsp;were built in 1875-76, on an enclosed piece of land 67 acres in&nbsp;extent, of which 19| are covered by buildings. There are 15J&nbsp;miles of single way within the enclosure. The workshops are&nbsp;built in blocks, separated by open spaces of at least 70 feet in&nbsp;width. They consist principally of seven large shops, of red brick,&nbsp;the walls being of a uniform height of 21 feet; four on the west&nbsp;side are devoted to the preparation of timber and the building and&nbsp;painting of carriages and waggons, and three on the east side to&nbsp;the manipulation of various metals, comprising the foundry and&nbsp;iron stores, the smithy and the machine and fitting shop. Each&nbsp;block of building is entirely surrounded by a 7-inch water-main&nbsp;continually charged with water at a pressure sufficient to throw a&nbsp;jet over the ridge of the roof of any of these buildings. Vehicular&nbsp;communication is carried on between the shops on the east and&nbsp;the west side of the works by means of traversing tables, the rails&nbsp;for which are laid the entire distance across the shops from north&nbsp;to south, and intersect the nine principal lines of sidings flanking&nbsp;the shops. Both steam-power and horse-power are used for moving the traversers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The saw-mill is 320 feet long and 200 wide. In the cellar underneath all the main shafting, pulleys, and belting are placed.&nbsp;About a hundred loads of oak logs are converted into plank or&nbsp;scantling weekly. There are in all about a hundred machines for&nbsp;sawing and working wood. Outside the saw-mill are large crosscutting saw-benches, with circular saws 6 feet in diameter, by which&nbsp;logs of deal are cut to the required length before being taken into&nbsp;the mill. The waggon-shop is 320 feet long and 200 wide. The&nbsp;carriage building and finishing shop is 384 by 200 feet wide. In&nbsp;the panel-shed fitted with louvre ventilators, mahogany panel&nbsp;boards, maple boards, &amp;c., are stored for about two years, to be&nbsp;thoroughly dried and seasoned before being used in vehicles. The&nbsp;painting and trimming shop is 384 by 300 feet. It has seventeen&nbsp;lines of rails, each capable of holding ten ordinary vehicles. From&nbsp;the commencement to the finish, twenty-five distinct operations—&nbsp;pruning, filling up, rubbing down, painting, varnishing—are performed on a passenger carriage. Young girls and women—the&nbsp;children and widows of the company’s servants who have lost their&nbsp;lives by accident in the service—are employed on the light work of&nbsp;sewing, stuffing of cushions and backs of carriages, french-polishing,&nbsp;washing and dyeing, cleaning and lacquering light brass-work and&nbsp;gilding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The foundries, iron and brass, are 200 feet long by 90 wide. Two thousand tons of iron castings are turned out annually. There&nbsp;are the bar-iron stores 200 by 45 feet, the general stores 150 by 90&nbsp;feet, and the mess-room 45 by 70 feet, providing accommodation&nbsp;for 500 workmen ; also two smiths’ shops, one of them 22</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">6</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> by 200&nbsp;feet, the other 140 by 200 feet; the machine and fitting shop, 400&nbsp;by 225 feet; and the coal-waggon repairing shop, 350 by 300 feet.&nbsp;The carriage and waggon works just noticed are capable of turning&nbsp;out seven new carriages and eighty new waggons weekly. All the&nbsp;building of railway carriages for the Midland Railway is done at&nbsp;their works, and 80 per cent, of the new waggons are built here.&nbsp;Eighty per cent, of the carriages and 20 per cent, of the waggons&nbsp;are repaired here. The machinery of all kinds laid down for carrying on the business of the carriage and waggon works comprises&nbsp;500 machine tools, 9 steam-engines, 1 gas-engine, 15 stationary&nbsp;boilers, 4 warming boilers, 3 steam traversers, 2 steam cranes, 2&nbsp;steam travelling cranes, with a number of hydraulic cranes and&nbsp;overhead cranes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">One of the engine houses or sheds for engines on duty, at Gorton station, on the Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire railway, is&nbsp;shown in fig. 21. It is a rotunda of 150 feet in diameter inside,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">and is capable of holding seventeen engines with their tenders, leaving the entrance and exit lines clear. The advantage of this&nbsp;arrangement over the ordinary polygonal engine-house is in the&nbsp;absence of pillars for supporting the roof, of which there are twelve&nbsp;for a twelve-sided polygon; in this building there is but one column,&nbsp;at the centre. To the left of the entrance is a furnace for holding&nbsp;live fuel, from which the engines are lighted ; and there are two&nbsp;lines of rail across the central turn-table, on one of which the&nbsp;engines enter and on the other depart. Between the rails of each&nbsp;radiating line a pit is constructed to afford access below the engines&nbsp;for inspection. The roof is of wrought-iron, surmounted by a louvre&nbsp;for ventilation, which is glazed to admit light freely. In the&nbsp;engine-shed of the North-Eastern Railway at Newcastle five ordinary engine-house rotundas have been replaced by a single rectangular building 450 by 280 feet with five turn-tables. This&nbsp;shed has berths for ninety engines, and the extra space enclosed by&nbsp;the rectangular building as against separate rotundas is used for&nbsp;executing minor repairs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Station Fittings</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">.—The use of switches and crossings is to form a Jink of communication between one line of rails and another.&nbsp;They are either constructed with ordinary rails or with rails&nbsp;specially rolled, and are carried in cast-iron chairs spiked down to&nbsp;sleepers. The switch-rails are movable, and when worked independently are moved by rods to which heavy weights are attached,&nbsp;—the function of the weights being to retain the points in one&nbsp;position, and to act as a self-acting adjustment in restoring them to&nbsp;their normal position after they have been shifted for the passage&nbsp;of a vehicle or a train. &quot;When only one of the terminal rails is&nbsp;movable it is called a single switch and is used only on sidings or&nbsp;branch lines of rail. The double switches, being more perfect in</span></p>
