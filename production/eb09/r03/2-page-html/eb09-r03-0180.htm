<p><span class="font0">universal recognition through the magnificent frescos at Manchester. Though not one of the pre-Raphaelite&nbsp;brotherhood, he had been a contributor to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Germ.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">Rossetti was deeply impressed with the power and fecundity of design displayed by Mr Brown’s cartoons exhibited&nbsp;in Westminster Hall, and when he himself began serious&nbsp;work as a painter he thought of Brown as the one man&nbsp;from whom he would willingly receive practical guidance,&nbsp;and wrote to him at random. He became Brown’s pupil ;&nbsp;but only once or twice, as in Found and Dr Johnson&nbsp;at the Mitre, did Rossetti try his hand at such realistic&nbsp;subjects as Brown loved, and then with a success&nbsp;that is very surprising if we consider how entirely his&nbsp;artistic energy had worked in very different lines. Found,&nbsp;begun in 1853, still remains unfinished. A countryman&nbsp;entering London in the early morning is accidentally&nbsp;or fatally encountered at the foot of the bridge by his&nbsp;rustic sweetheart, who, having gone to London, has been,&nbsp;in the most pathetic and terrible sense of the word,&nbsp;“ lost.” At sight of her lover the girl falls fainting at his&nbsp;feet. The expression of shame and horror on her still&nbsp;beautiful face as she cowers against the wall, and the&nbsp;expression of pity and grief on the man’s as he clasps her&nbsp;hands and tries to raise her are unsurpassed and perhaps&nbsp;for sheer power unequalled in modern dramatic art.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Many circumstances—for instance, the beginning of such grand designs as Magdalene at the Door of Simon the&nbsp;Pharisee, “ Aspectâ Medusa,” the Boat of Love, &amp;c.,—interfered with the completion of Found. With the exception&nbsp;of the Boat of Love, Dante’s Dream (1870) was perhaps&nbsp;Rossetti’s most ambitious design in purely imaginative art.&nbsp;From the painting of this picture to his death Rossetti&nbsp;never satisfactorily completed a large and elaborate design&nbsp;—not because his faculty of invention was ever exhausted ;&nbsp;in the very year of his death his brain was teeming with&nbsp;ideas as restlessly as when he designed Found and the&nbsp;Boat of Love. But the truth is that he wanted to write&nbsp;more poetry ; and those wonderful half-lengths of women&nbsp;for which, late in life, he became so famous were not only&nbsp;beautiful and satisfying but comparatively easy of achievement ; moreover purchasers were keen to commission&nbsp;them. Among those half-lengths, however, will be found&nbsp;some of his greatest works. Chief among them (if it is&nbsp;not Proserpine) is the marvellous crayon design Pandora&nbsp;in the possession of the present writer. In it is seen at&nbsp;its highest Rossetti’s unique faculty of treating classical&nbsp;legend in the true romantic spirit. The grand and sombre&nbsp;beauty of Pandora’s face, the mysterious haunting sadness&nbsp;in her deep blue-grey eyes as she tries in vain to reclose&nbsp;the fatal box from which are still escaping the smoke and&nbsp;flames that shape themselves as they curl over her head&nbsp;into shadowy spirit faces, grey with agony, between&nbsp;tortured wings of sullen fire, are in the highest romantic&nbsp;mood. And if the Proserpine does not equal this design&nbsp;in elaborate allegorical richness it has perhaps the still&nbsp;higher merit of suggesting lofty tragedy by the simplest&nbsp;means. By sheer force of facial expression, a woman&nbsp;clasping a pomegranate renders a tragic situation as fully&nbsp;as though the canvas had been crowded with figures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But we must turn to his poetry. “The Blessed Damozel ” was written so early as 1848.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“ Sister Helen ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">was produced in its original form in 1850 or 1851. The translations from the early Italian poets also began as far&nbsp;back as 1845 or 184G, and may have been mainly completed by 1849. Materials for the volume of original&nbsp;poetry (1870) accumulated slowly, and these having been&nbsp;somewhat widely read in manuscript had a very great&nbsp;influence upon our poetic literature long before their&nbsp;appearance in print ; but this is not the place for criticizing them in detail. All that we can here say is that in&nbsp;poetry no less than in art what makes Rossetti so important a figure is the position he took up with regard to the&nbsp;Renascence of Wonder—to that modern revival of what is&nbsp;called the “romantic” spirit, that spirit without which&nbsp;English poetry, as the present writer has on a former&nbsp;occasion said when discussing the romantic movement, can&nbsp;scarcely hold an original place at all when challenged in&nbsp;a court of universal criticism. The Renascence of Wonder&nbsp;culminates in Rossetti’s poetry as it culminates in his painting. The poet who should go beyond Rossetti would pass&nbsp;out of the realm of poetry into pure mysticism, as certain&nbsp;of his sonnets show. Fine as are these sonnets, it is in&nbsp;his romantic ballads that Rossetti (notwithstanding a&nbsp;certain ruggedness of movement) shows his greatest&nbsp;strength. In this opinion (which is not the general one)&nbsp;we agree with Dr Hueffer. “ Sister Helen,” “ The Blessed&nbsp;Damozel,” “Staff and Scrip,” “Eden Bower,” “Troy&nbsp;Town,” “ Rose Mary,” as representing the modern revival&nbsp;of the true romantic spirit, take a place quite apart from&nbsp;the other poetry of our time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">By the modern revival of the romantic spirit in English poetry we mean something much more than the&nbsp;revival, at the close of the last century, of natural language,&nbsp;the change discussed by Wordsworth in his famous Preface, and by Coleridge in his comments thereon—that&nbsp;change of diction and of poetic methods which is commonly supposed to have arisen with Cowper, or, if not&nbsp;with Cowper, with Burns. The truth is that Wordsworth&nbsp;and Coleridge were too near the great changes in question,&nbsp;and they themselves took too active a part in those&nbsp;changes, to hold the historical view of what the changes&nbsp;really were. Important as was the change in poetic&nbsp;methods which they so admirably practised and discussed,&nbsp;important as was the revival of natural language, which&nbsp;then set in, it was not nearly so important as that other&nbsp;revival which had begun earlier and of which it was the&nbsp;outcome—the revival of the romantic spirit, the Renascence of Wonder, even beneath the weight of 18th-century diction, the first movement of which no one&nbsp;has yet been able clearly and decisively to point out,&nbsp;but which is certainly English, and neither German nor&nbsp;French in its origin, and can be traced through Chatterton,&nbsp;Macpherson, and the Percy Ballads. ∙</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As a mere question of methods, a reaction against the poetic diction of Pope and his followers was inevitable.&nbsp;But, in discussing the romantic temper in relation to&nbsp;the overthrow of the bastard classicism and didactic&nbsp;materialism of the 18 th century, we must, as we have&nbsp;just seen in discussing Rossetti’s pictures, go deeper than&nbsp;mere artistic methods in poetry. When closely examined&nbsp;it is in method only that the poetry of Cowper is&nbsp;different from the ratiocinative and unromantic poetry&nbsp;of Dryden and Pope and their followers. Pope treated&nbsp;prose subjects in the ratiocinative—that is to say,&nbsp;the prose—temper, but in a highly artificial diction&nbsp;which people agreed to call poetic. Cowper treated prose&nbsp;subjects too—treated them in the same prose temper, but&nbsp;used natural language, a noble thing to do, no doubt—&nbsp;but this was only a part (and by no means the chief part)&nbsp;of the great work achieved by English poetry at the close&nbsp;of last century. That period, to be sure, freed us from&nbsp;the poetic diction of Pope ; but it gave us something more&nbsp;precious still—it gave us entire freedom, from the hard&nbsp;rhetorical materialism imported from France ; it gave a&nbsp;new seeing to our eyes, which were opened once more to&nbsp;the mystery and the wonder of the universe and the&nbsp;romance of man’s destiny ; it revived in short the romantic&nbsp;spirit, but the romantic spirit enriched by all the clarity&nbsp;and sanity that the renascence of classicism was able to&nbsp;lend.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
