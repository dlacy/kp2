                <p><label>SADLER (or Sadleir), SIR RALPH</label> (1507-1587), English statesman, the
                    son of Henry Sadler, steward of the manor of Cilney, near Great Hadham,
                    Hertfordshire, was born at Hackney, Middlesex, in 1507. While a child he was
                    placed in the family of Thomas Cromwell, afterwards earl of Essex, whose
                    secretary he eventually became. Between 1525 and 1529 his patron’s letters are
                    full of Sadler’s name in connexion with Cardinal Wolsey’s suppression of the
                    monasteries; this probably brought him under the king’s notice, for in 1536 he
                    was made gentleman of the privy chamber, and from that time was continually
                    employed by Henry VIII. In r537 Sadler went first to Scotland to try to
                    reconcile Margaret to her son King James V., and then to France on the same
                    mission to James himself. He seems to have been successful, and was again in
                    Scotland in. 1540 trying to induce the king to follow his uncle’s ecclesiastical
                    policy. In or about January 1540, he was made secretary of state along with Sir
                    Thomas Wriothesly, and was knighted, probably about the same time. On James V.’s
                    death Sadler again went to Scotland (March 1543) to negotiate a marriage between
                    prince Edward and his cousin Mary; he was unsuccessful, but still retained
                    Henry’s confidence. On Henry’s death in 1547, Sadler was by his will made one of
                    the councillors to the sixteen noblemen entrusted with the young king’s
                    guardianship. In the same year he was appointed treasurer to the army sent to
                    Scotland, and for his services in rallying the repulsed cavalry at the battle of
                    Musselburgh or Pinkie, he was created a knight-banneret. He also received many
                    grants of land, including the manor of Standon in Hertfordshire, where he built
                    a magnificent house in 1546. When Mary ascended the throne he retired, living
                    quietly till Elizabeth’s accession. He issued the writs for the privy council
                    meeting at Hatfield on the 20th of November 1558, and during the first year of
                    the queen’s reign he once more became a privy councillor. He sat in the
                    parliament of January 1558-1559 as member for Hertford, which he had already
                    represented in 1541, 1542 and-1553. Not long afterwards his strong Protestant
                    sympathies and his acquaintance with Scotch affairs induced Elizabeth to send
                    him (1559) to Scotland, ostensibly to settle the border disputes, but in reality
                    to secure a union with the Protestant party there, and he was largely
                    instrumental in bringing about the treaty of Leith, July 6th, 1560. In 1568
                    Sadler was appointed chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, and in the same year
                    was one of the English Commissioners employed in treating on the matters arising
                    from the flight of the Queen of Scots. From this time he seems to have been
                    continually engaged as a discreet and trusty servant in connexion with Mary’s
                    captivity, and was frequently sent with messages to her. On the 25th of August
                    1584, when, owing to the imputations made by his countess, George 6th earl of
                    Shrewsbury was allowed to resign his guardianship of the Queen, Sadler was
                    appointed to succeed him. In September Mary was removed from Sheffield to
                    Wing-field and thence early in 1585 to Tutbury. In April, Sadler, after numerous
                    petitions on his part, was permitted to resign his distasteful charge. He is
                    said by some to have been sent to Scotland to announce to James VI. his mother’s
                    death, but this is not corroborated by the state papers. On the 30th of March
                    1587 Sadler died at Standon, and was buried in the church there. He had married
                    about 1534 Elizabeth Mitchell,</p>

                <p>whose first husband Matthew Barre had deserted her and was believed to be dead.
                    Barre, however, re-appeared a few years later, and Sadler then obtained an act
                    of parliament legitimatizing his children. Sadler was not a brilliant statesman,
                    but a most faithful and intelligent servant. His letters, particularly those on
                    Scottish affairs, are most interesting.</p>
