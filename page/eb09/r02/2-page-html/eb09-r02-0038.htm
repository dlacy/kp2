<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Normal Respiration.—</span><span class="font1">If the naked body of a person asleep or in perfect inactivity be carefully watched, it will&nbsp;be found that the anterior and lateral walls of the chest&nbsp;move rhythmically up and down, while air passes into and&nbsp;out of the nostrils (and mouth also if this be open) in&nbsp;correspondence with the movement. If we look more&nbsp;closely we shall find that with every uprising of the chest&nbsp;walls the membranous intercostal portions sink slightly as&nbsp;if sucked in, while at the same time the flexible walls of&nbsp;the abdomen bulge as if protruded by some internal force.&nbsp;If respiration be in the slightest degree hurried these&nbsp;motions become so marked as to escape the attention of&nbsp;no one. The elevation of the chest walls is called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">inspiration,</span><span class="font1"> their depression </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">expiration.</span><span class="font1"> Inspiration is slightly&nbsp;shorter than expiration, and usually there is a slight pause&nbsp;or momentary inaction of the chest between expiration&nbsp;and the following inspiration. Apparatuses for measuring&nbsp;the excursion of a given point of the chest wall during&nbsp;respiration are called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">thoracometers</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">stethometers.</span><span class="font1"> Apparatuses for recording the movements of the chest are called&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">stethographs</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pneumographs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Frequency of Respiration.—</span><span class="font1">The frequency of respiration during perfect rest of the body is 16 to 24 per minute, the&nbsp;pulse rate being usually four times the rate of respiration ;&nbsp;but the respiratory rhythm varies in various conditions of&nbsp;life. The following are the means of many observations&nbsp;made by Quetelet : at the age of one year the number of&nbsp;respirations is 44 per minute; at 5 years, 26 ; from 15 to&nbsp;20 years, 20; from 25 to 30, 16; from 30 to 50, 18<sup>,</sup>l.&nbsp;Muscular exertion always increases the frequency of respiration. The higher the temperature of the environment the&nbsp;more frequent is the respiration. Bert has shown that with&nbsp;higher atmospheric pressures than the normal the frequency&nbsp;of respiration is diminished while the depth of each inspiration is increased. The frequency of respiration diminishes&nbsp;until dinner time, reaches its maximum within an hour of&nbsp;feeding, and thereafter falls again ; if dinner is omitted, no&nbsp;rise of frequency occurs. The respiratory act can be interrupted at any stage, reversed, quickened, slowed, and variously modified at will, so long as respiration is not stopped&nbsp;entirely for more than a short space of time ; beyond this&nbsp;limit the will is incapable of suppressing respiration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Depth of Respiration.—</span><span class="font1">The depth of respiration is measured by the quantity of air inspired or expired in the&nbsp;act ; but the deepest expiration possible does not suffice to&nbsp;expel all the air the lungs contain. The following measurements have been ascertained, and are here classified according to the convenient terminology proposed by Hutchinson.&nbsp;(1) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Residual air,</span><span class="font1"> the volume of air remaining in the chest&nbsp;after the most complete expiratory effort, ranges from 100&nbsp;to 130 cubic inches. (2) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Reserve</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">supplemental air,</span><span class="font1"> the&nbsp;volume of air which can be expelled from the chest after&nbsp;an ordinary quiet expiration, measures about 100 cubic&nbsp;inches. (3) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tidal air,</span><span class="font1"> the volume of air taken in and&nbsp;given out at each ordinary respiration may be stated at&nbsp;about 20 cubic inches. (4) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Complemental air,</span><span class="font1"> the volume&nbsp;of air that can be forcibly inspired over and above what&nbsp;is taken in at a normal inspiration, ranges from about&nbsp;100 to 130 cubic inches. By </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">vital capacity,</span><span class="font1"> which once&nbsp;had an exaggerated importance attached to it, is meant the&nbsp;quantity of air which can be expelled from the lungs by&nbsp;the deepest possible expiration after the deepest possible&nbsp;inspiration ; it obviously includes the complemental, tidal,&nbsp;and reserve airs, and measures about 230 cubic inches in&nbsp;the Englishman of average height, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font1"> 5 feet 8 inches&nbsp;(Hutchinson). It varies according to the height, body&nbsp;weight, age, sex, position of the body, and condition as&nbsp;to health of the subject of observation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Vital capacity is estimated by means of a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">spirometer,</span><span class="font0"> a graduated gasometer into which air may be blown from the lungs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The residual air, which for obvious reasons cannot be actually measured, may be estimated in the following way (Harless,&nbsp;Gréhant). At the end of ordinary expiration, apply the mouth&nbsp;to a mouth-piece communicating with a vessel filled with pure&nbsp;hydrogen, and breathe into and out of this vessel half a dozen&nbsp;times—until, in fact, there is reason to suppose that the air in the&nbsp;lungs at the time of the experiment has become evenly mixed with&nbsp;hydrogen. Then ascertain by analysis the proportion of hydrogen&nbsp;to expired air in the vessel and estimate the amount of the air&nbsp;which the lungs contained by the following formula</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">υ</span><span class="font0"> : V </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">+v≈ρ</span><span class="font0"> : 100; </span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">r(100-</span><span class="font0">p).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">P</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">where V=volume of air in the lungs at the time of experiment, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">υ= </span><span class="font0">volume of the vessel containing hydrogen, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">p=</span><span class="font0"> proportion of air to&nbsp;hydrogen in the vessel at the end of the experiment. V, then, is&nbsp;the volume of air in the lungs after an </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ordinary</span><span class="font0"> expiration; that&nbsp;is, it includes the residual and the reserve air ; if we subtract from&nbsp;this the amount of reserve air ascertained by direct measurement,&nbsp;we obtain the 100-130 cubic inches which Hutchinson arrived at&nbsp;by a study of the dead body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Volume of Respiration.—</span><span class="font1">It is clear that the ventilation of the lungs in ordinary breathing does not merely depend on&nbsp;the quantity of air inspired at each breath, but also on the&nbsp;number of inspirations in a given time. If these two values&nbsp;be multiplied together we get what might be called the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">volume</span><span class="font1"> of respiration </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(^Athmungsgrösse,</span><span class="font1"> Rosenthal) in contradistinction to depth of respiration and frequency of respiration. Various instruments have been devised to measure&nbsp;the volume of respiration, all more or less faulty for the&nbsp;reason that they compel respiration under somewhat abnormal conditions (Rosenthal, Gad, Panum, Hering). From&nbsp;the data obtained we may conclude that the respiratory&nbsp;volume per minute in man is about 366 cubic inches (6000&nbsp;cubic centim.). In connexion with this subject it may be&nbsp;stated that, after a single ordinary inspiration of hydrogen&nbsp;gas, 6-10 respirations of ordinary air must occur before&nbsp;the expired air ceases to contain some trace of hydrogen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Types of Respiration.—</span><span class="font1">The visible characters of respiration in man vary considerably according to age and sex. In men, while there is a moderate degree of upheaval of the&nbsp;chest, there is a considerable although not preponderating&nbsp;degree of excursion of the abdominal walls. In women&nbsp;the chest movements are decidedly most marked, the excursion of the abdominal walls being comparatively small.&nbsp;Hence we may distinguish two types of respiration, the&nbsp;costal and the abdominal, according to the preponderance&nbsp;of movement of one or the other part of the body wall.&nbsp;In forced respiration the type is costal in both sexes, and&nbsp;so it is also in sleep. The cause of this difference between&nbsp;men and women has been variously ascribed (a) to constriction of the chest by corsets in women, (δ) to a natural&nbsp;adaptation to the needs of childbearing in women, and (c)&nbsp;to the greater relative flexibility of the ribs in women permitting a wider displacement under the action of he&nbsp;inspiratory muscles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Certain Concomitants of Normal Respiration.—</span><span class="font1">If the ear be placed against the chest wall during ordinary&nbsp;respiration we can hear with every inspiration a sighing&nbsp;or rustling sound, called “vesicular,” which is probably caused by the expansion of the air vesicles ; and&nbsp;with every expiration a sound of a much softer sighing&nbsp;character. In children the inspiratory rustle is sharper&nbsp;and more pronounced than in adults. If a stethoscope be&nbsp;placed over the trachea, bronchi, or larynx, so that the&nbsp;sounds generated there may be separately communicated&nbsp;to the ear, there is heard a harsh to-and-fro sound during inspiration and expiration which has received the&nbsp;name of “ bronchial.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In healthy breathing the mouth should be closed and the ingoing current should all pass through the nose.&nbsp;When this happens the nostrils become slightly expanded&nbsp;with each inspiration, probably by the action of the M.</span></p>
