<p><span class="font0">our houses. We must keep up their waters for the purposes of navigation, or supply their places by canals; we must drain our fens, and defend them when drained; we&nbsp;must understand their motions, and their mode of secret,&nbsp;slow, but unceasing action, that our bridges, our wharfs,&nbsp;our dikes, may not become heaps of ruins, ignorant how&nbsp;to proceed in these daily recurring cases, how often do we&nbsp;see projects of high expectation and heavy expense fail of&nbsp;their object, leaving the state burdened with works not&nbsp;only useless, but frequently hurtful?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This has long been a most interesting subject of study in Italy, where the fertility of their fields is not more indebted to their rich soil and happy climate, than to their&nbsp;numerous derivations from the rivers which traverse them;&nbsp;and in Holland and Flanders, where their very existence&nbsp;requires unceasing attention to the waters, which are every&nbsp;moment ready to swallow up the inhabitants, and where&nbsp;the inhabitants, having once subdued this formidable enemy, have made those very waters their indefatigable drudges,&nbsp;transporting through every corner of the country the materials of an extensive commerce.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Such having been our incessant occupations with moving waters, we should expect, that while the operative artists&nbsp;are continually furnishing facts and experiments, the man&nbsp;of speculative and scientific curiosity, excited by the importance of the subject, would ere now have made considerable progress in the science; and that the professional engineer would be daily acting from established principle,&nbsp;and be seldom disappointed in his expectations. Unfortunately, the reverse of this is nearly the true state of the&nbsp;case: each engineer is obliged to collect the greatest part&nbsp;of his knowledge from his own experience, and by many&nbsp;dear-bought lessons, to direct his future operations, in&nbsp;which he still proceeds with anxiety and hesitation; for&nbsp;we have not yet acquired principles of theory, and experiments have not yet been collected and published by which&nbsp;an empirical practice might be safely formed. Many experiments of inestimable value are daily made; but they&nbsp;remain with their authors, who seldom have either leisure,&nbsp;ability, or generosity, to add them to the public stock.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The motion of waters has been really so little investigated as yet, that hydraulics may still be called a new study. We have merely skimmed over a few common notions concerning the motions of water; and the mathematicians of&nbsp;the first order seem to have contented themselves with&nbsp;such views as allowed them to entertain themselves with&nbsp;elegant applications of calculus. This, however, has not&nbsp;been their fault. They rarely had opportunity of doing&nbsp;more, for want of a knowledge of facts. They have made&nbsp;excellent use of the few which have been given them; but&nbsp;it required much labour, great variety of opportunity, and&nbsp;great expense, to learn the multiplicity of things which are&nbsp;combined even in the simplest cases of water in motion.&nbsp;These are seldom the lot of the mathematician; and he&nbsp;is without blame when he enjoys the pleasures within his&nbsp;reach, and cultivates the science of geometry in its most&nbsp;abstracted form. Here he makes a progress which is the&nbsp;boast of human reason, being almost insured from error&nbsp;by the intellectual simplicity of his subject. But when we&nbsp;turn our attention to material objects, and, without knowing either the size and shape of the elementary particles,&nbsp;or the laws which nature has prescribed for their action,&nbsp;presume to foresee their effects, calculate their exertions,&nbsp;direct their actions, what must be their consequence? Nature shows her independence with respect to our notions,&nbsp;and, always faithful to the laws which are enjoined, and of&nbsp;which we are ignorant, she never fails to thwart our views,&nbsp;to disconcert our projects, and render useless all our efforts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To wish to know the nature of the elements is vain, and our gross organs are insufficient for the study. To sup</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">pose what we do not know, and to fancy shapes and sizes at will, is to raise phantoms, and will produce a system, but&nbsp;will not prove a foundation for any science. But to interrogate Nature herself, study the laws which she so faithfully observes, catch her, as we say, in the fact, and thus&nbsp;wrest from her the secret; this is the only way to become&nbsp;her master, and it is the only procedure consistent with&nbsp;good sense. And we see that soon after Kepler detected&nbsp;the laws of the planetary motions, when Galileo discovered&nbsp;the uniform acceleration of gravity, when Paschal discovered the pressure of the atmosphere, and Newton discovered&nbsp;the laws of attraction and the track of a ray of light; astronomy, mechanics, hydrostatics, chemistry, optics, quickly&nbsp;became bodies of sound doctrine, and the deductions from&nbsp;their respective theories were found fair representations of&nbsp;the phenomena of nature. Whenever a man has discovered&nbsp;a law of nature, he has laid the foundation of a science, and&nbsp;he has given us a new mean of subjecting to our service&nbsp;some element hitherto independent; and so long as groups&nbsp;of natural operations follow a route which appears to us&nbsp;whimsical, and will not admit our calculations, we may be&nbsp;assured that we are ignorant of the principle which connects them all, and regulates their procedure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This is remarkably the case with several phenomena in the motions of fluids, and particularly in the motion of water&nbsp;in a bed or conduit of any kind. Although the first geniuses of Europe have for this century past turned much of&nbsp;their attention to this subject, we are almost ignorant of&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">general laws</span><span class="font0"> which may be observed in their motions.&nbsp;We have been able to select very few points of resemblance, and every case remains nearly an individual. About&nbsp;one hundred and fifty years ago we discovered, by experience only, the quantity and velocity of water issuing from&nbsp;a small orifice, and, after much labour, have extended this&nbsp;to any orifice; and this is almost the whole of our confidential knowledge. But as to the uniform course of the&nbsp;streams which water the face of the earth, and the maxims&nbsp;which will certainly regulate this agreeably to our wishes,&nbsp;we are in a manner totally ignorant. Who can pretend to&nbsp;say what is the velocity of a river of which you tell him&nbsp;the breadth, the depth, and the declivity? Who can say&nbsp;what swell will be produced in different parts of its course,&nbsp;if a dam or weir of given dimensions be made in it, or a&nbsp;bridge be thrown across it; or how much its waters will be&nbsp;raised by turning another stream into it, or sunk by taking&nbsp;off a branch to drive a mill? Who can say with confidence&nbsp;what must be the dimensions or slope of this branch, in order to furnish the water that is wanted, or the dimensions&nbsp;and slope of a canal which shall effectually drain a fenny&nbsp;district? Who can say what form will cause or will prevent the undermining of banks, the forming of elbows, the&nbsp;pooling of the bed, or the deposition of sands? Yet these&nbsp;are the most important questions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The causes of this ignorance are the want or uncertainty of our principles; the falsity of our only theory, which is belied by experience; and the small number of proper&nbsp;observations or experiments, and difficulty of making such&nbsp;as shall be serviceable. We have, it is true, made a few&nbsp;experiments on the efflux of water from small orifices, and&nbsp;from them we have deduced a sort of theory, dependent on&nbsp;the fall of heavy bodies and the laws of hydrostatic pressure. Hydrostatics is indeed founded on very simple principles, which give a very good account of the laws of the&nbsp;quiescent equilibrium of fluids, in consequence of gravity&nbsp;and perfect fluidity. But by what train of reasoning can&nbsp;we connect these with the phenomena of the uniform motion of the waters of a river or open stream, which can derive its motion only from the slope of its surface, and the&nbsp;modifications of this motion or its velocity only from the&nbsp;width and depth of the stream? These are the only circumstances which can distinguish a portion of a river from</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
