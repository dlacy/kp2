<pb xml:id="eb11-23-r03-0471" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0504.jp2"/><p>appointed by the Edinburgh town council sole regent of the “town’s college” (“Academia Jacobi Sexti,” afterwards the university of Edinburgh), and three years later he received from the same source the title of “ principal, or first master,” and was engaged in lecturing on philosophy. When the staff of the young college was increased by the appointment of additional regents, he assumed with consent of the presbytery the office of professor of theology. From 1587 he also preached regularly in the East Kirk every Sunday at 7 a.m., and in 1596 he accepted one of the eight ministerial charges of the city. He took a prominent part in the somewhat troubled church politics of the day, and distinguished himself by gentleness and tact, as well as ability. He was appointed on several occasions to committees of presbytery and assembly on pressing ecclesiastical business. He was elected moderator of the General Assembly held at Dundee in May 1597. In 1598 he was translated to the parish church of the Upper Tolbooth, Edinburgh, and immediately thereafter to that of the Grey Friars (then known as the Magdalen Church). He died at Edinburgh on the 8th of February 1599.</p><p>Rollock wrote Commentaries on the Epistles tc the Ephesians (1590) and Thessalonians (1598) and Hebrews (1605), the book of Daniel (1591), the Gospel of St John (1599) and some of the Psalms (1598) ; an analysis of the Epistle to the Romans (1594), and Galatians (1602); also <hi rend="italic">Questions and Answers on the Covenant of God</hi> (1596), and a <hi rend="italic">Treatise on Effectxcal Calling</hi> (1597).
