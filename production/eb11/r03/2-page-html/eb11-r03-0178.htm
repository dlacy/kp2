From 1862 to 1867 he also held the&nbsp;position of Drummond professor of political economy at&nbsp;Oxford. During that period he published (in 1866) the first two&nbsp;volumes of his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">History of Agriculture and Prices in England,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">dealing with the period 1259-1400, a minute and masterly&nbsp;record of the subject, and the work upon which his reputation&nbsp;mainly rests. Two more volumes (1401-1582) were published&nbsp;in 1882, a fifth and sixth (1583-1702) in 1887, and he left&nbsp;hehind him at his death copious materials for a seventh and&nbsp;eighth. In 1868 he published a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Manual of Political Economy,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">and in 1869 an edition of Adam Smith’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Wealth of Nations.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">In 1875 collected and edited the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Protests of the Lords.</span><span class="font1"> An&nbsp;intimate acquaintance with Cobden and John Bright led&nbsp;Rogers to take an active part in politics: he represented&nbsp;Southwark in parliament from 1880 to 1885, and Bermondsey&nbsp;from 1885-86, as an advanced Liberal. In 1888, on the&nbsp;death of Professor Bonamy Price, who had succeeded him at&nbsp;Oxford as professor of political economy, he was re-elected to&nbsp;the post, and held it till his death. Previously (in 1883) he&nbsp;had been appointed lecturer in political economy at Worcester&nbsp;College, Oxford. His latter years were mainly spent at Oxford,&nbsp;where he died on the 12th of October 1890. He was celebrated&nbsp;as a caustic wit and humqrist. Of his miscellaneous economic&nbsp;and historical writings, which were numerous, the most noteworthy is his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Six Centuries of Work and Wages,</span><span class="font1"> published in&nbsp;1884. As an economist, Thorold Rogers did much to promote&nbsp;the historical study of his subject. He was, however, apt to&nbsp;be guided too frequently by political prejudice, and the value&nbsp;of his work suffered from his aggressively contentious spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROGERS, JOHN (1627-c. 1665), English preacher, second son of Nehemiah Rogers, a royalist and Anglican clergyman,&nbsp;was born at Messing in Essex, and became a servitor and student&nbsp;of medicine at King’s College, Cambridge. When still a youth&nbsp;the violence of his religious despair led him to attempt suicide&nbsp;and ended in his joining the extreme sect of the Puritans.&nbsp;Deprived of his home in 1642, he walked to Cambridge, and&nbsp;found the college establishment hroken up; he nearly starved,&nbsp;but obtained in 1643 a scholastic post in Lord BrudenePs&nbsp;house in Huntingdonshire, and subsequently at St Neot’s free&nbsp;school. He became known as a preacher, received Presbyterian&nbsp;ordination in 1647, married a daughter of Sir Robert Payne&nbsp;of Midloe in Huntingdonshire, and obtained the living of&nbsp;Purleigh in Essex. Subsequently he came to London, joined&nbsp;the Independents, became lecturer at St Thomas Apostle’s, and&nbsp;attracted attention by the violence of his political sermons.&nbsp;He was appointed preacher to Christ Church Cathedral in Dublin&nbsp;by the parliament in 1651, and while there served in the field,&nbsp;returning in 1652 to St Thomas Apostle’s on account of religious&nbsp;dissensions. In 1653 his parishioners at Purleigh, where he&nbsp;had hitherto managed to retain the living, successfully proceeded against him for non-residence. In the quarrel between&nbsp;the army and the parliament Rogers had naturally sided with&nbsp;the former, and he was one of the first to join the Fifth Monarchy movement. He approved of the expulsion of the Long&nbsp;Parliament, and addressed two letters to Cromwell on the&nbsp;subject of the new government to be inaugurated, but the&nbsp;establishment of the Protectorate at once threw the Fifth&nbsp;Monarchy men into antagonism. Rogers addressed a warning&nbsp;letter to Cromwell, and boldly attacked him from the pulpit&nbsp;on the 9th of January 1654. Thereupon his house was searched&nbsp;and his papers seized, and Rogers then issued another denunciation against Cromwell, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Me ne, Tekel, Perez: a Letter lamenting&nbsp;over Oliver Lord Cromwell.</span><span class="font1"> On the 28th 'of March, on which&nbsp;day he had proclaimed a fast for the sins of the rulers, he&nbsp;preached a violent sermon against the protector, which occasioned his arrest in July. He confronted Cromwell with great&nbsp;courage when brought before him on the 5th of February 1655,&nbsp;and was imprisoned successively at Windsor and in the Isle of&nbsp;Wight, heing released in January 1657. He returned to London,&nbsp;and, being suspected of a conspiracy, was again imprisoned&nbsp;by Cromwell in the Tower from the 3rd of February 1658 till&nbsp;the 16th of April. On the protector’s death and the downfall&nbsp;of Richard Cromwell, the ideals of the Fifth Monarchy men&nbsp;seemed nearer realization, but Rogers was engaged in political&nbsp;controversy with Prynne and became a source of embarrassment to his own faction, which endeavoured to get rid of him&nbsp;by appointing him “ to preach the gospel ” in Ireland. On&nbsp;the outbreak of Sir George Booth’s royalist insurrection, however, he hecame chaplain in Charles Fairfax’s regiment, and&nbsp;served throughout the campaign. He obtained a lectureship at&nbsp;Shrewsbury in Octoher and was in Dublin in January 1660, being&nbsp;imprisoned there hy order of the army faction and released subsequently by the parliament. At the Restoration he withdrew to&nbsp;Holland, studied medicine at Leiden and Utrecht, and obtained&nbsp;from the latter university the degree of M.D. in 1662. He returned&nbsp;to England the same year and resided at Bermondsey, was&nbsp;admitted to the degree of M.D. at Oxford in 1664, and is supposed,&nbsp;in the absence of further record, to have died soon afterwards.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">ROGERS, JOHN </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(c.</span><span class="font1"> 1500-1555), English Protestant martyr, was born in the parish of Aston, near Birmingham, and was&nbsp;educated at Pembroke Hall, Cambridge, where he graduated&nbsp;B.A. in 1526. Six years later he was rector of Holy Trinity,&nbsp;Queenhithe, London, and in 1534 went to Antwerp as chaplain&nbsp;to the English merchants. Here he met Wilbam Tyndale,&nbsp;under whose influence he abandoned the Roman Catholic faith,&nbsp;and married an Antwerp lady. After Tyndale’s death Rogers&nbsp;pushed on with his predecessor’s English version of the Old&nbsp;Testament, which he used as far as 2 Chronicles, employing&nbsp;Coverdale’s translation (1535) for the remainder and for the&nbsp;Apocrypha. Tyndale’s New Testament had been published&nbsp;in 1526. The complete Bible was put out under the pseudonym&nbsp;of Thomas Matthew in 1537; it was printed in Antwerp, and&nbsp;Richard Grafton published the sheets and got leave to sell the&nbsp;edition (1500 copies) in England. Rogers had little to do with&nbsp;the translation, hut he contributed some valuable prefaces and&nbsp;marginal notes. His work was largely used by those who&nbsp;prepared the Great Bible (1539-40), out of which in turn came&nbsp;the Bishop’s Bihle (1568) and the Authorized Version of 1611.&nbsp;After taking charge of a Protestant congregation in Wittenberg&nbsp;for some years, Rogers returned to England in 1548, where&nbsp;he published a translation of Melanchthon’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Considerations of&nbsp;the Augsburg Interim.</span><span class="font1"> In 1550 he was presented to the crown&nbsp;livings of St Margaret Moyses and St Sepulchre in London,&nbsp;and in 1551 was made a prebendary of St Paul’s, where the dean&nbsp;and chapter soon appointed him divinity lecturer. He courageously denounced the greed shown by certain courtiers with&nbsp;reference to the property of the suppressed monasteries, and&nbsp;defended himself before the privy council. He also declined&nbsp;to wear the prescribed vestments, donning instead a simple&nbsp;round cap. On the accession of Mary he preached at Paul’s&nbsp;Cross commending the “ true doctrine taught in King Edward’s&nbsp;days,” and warning his hearers against “ pestilent Popery,&nbsp;idolatry and superstition.” Ten days after (16th August 1553),&nbsp;he was summoned before the council and bidden to keep within&nbsp;his own house. His emoluments were taken away and his&nbsp;prebend was filled in October. In January 1554 Bonner, the&nbsp;new bishop of London, sent him to Newgate, where he lay with</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
