Nay, ſuch was the general hatred of this unfortunate miniſter, that the ſoldiers quartered in the cities of Italy no ſooner heard of his death, than they murdered the wives and children of the barbarians whom Stilicho had taken into the ſervice of Honorius. The enraged huſhands went over to Alaric, who made a new demand of money ; which not being readily ſent, he laid ſiege to Rome, and would have taken it, had not the emperor complied with his demand. The ranſom of the city was 5000 pounds of gold, 30,000 of ſilver, 40c. o ſilk garments, 3000 ſhins dyed purple, and 3000 pounds of pepper. On this occaſion the heathen temples were ſtripped of their remaining ornaments, and among others of the ſtatue of Valour ; which the pagans did not fail to interpret as a preſage of the ſpeedy ruin of the ſtate.</p><p>Alaric having received this treaſure, departed ſor a ſhort time : but ſoon after he again blocked up the city with a numerous army ; and again an accommodation with Honorius was ſet on foot. However, for ſome reaſons which do not clearly appear, the treaty was broken off, Rome was a third time beſieged, and at laſt taken and plundered. Alaric, when upqn the point of breaking into the city, addreſſing his ſoldiers, told them, that all the wealth in it was theirs, and therefore he gave them full liberty to ſeize it ; but at the ſame time he ſtrictly enjoined them to ſhed the blood of none but ſuch as they ſhould find in arms ; and above all, to ſpare thoſe 5vh0 ſhould take ſanctuary in the holy places, eſpecially in the churches of the apoſtles St Peter and St Paul ; which he named, becauſe they w<hi rend="sup">τ</hi>ere moſt ſpacious, and conſequently capable of affording an aſylum to great numbers of people. Having given theſe orders, he abandoned the city to his Goths, who treated it no better, according to St Jerome, than the Greeks are ſaid to have treated ancient Troy ; for after having plundered it for the ſpace of three, or, as others will have it, of ſix days, they ſet fire to it in ſeveral places ; ſo that the ſtately palace of Salluſt, and many other magnificent buildings, were reduced to aſhes ; nay, Procopius writes, that there was not in the whole city one houſe left entire ; and both St Jerome and Philoſtorgius aſſert, that the great metropolis of the empire was reduced to an heap of aſhes and ruins. Though many of the Goths, purſuant to the orders of their general, refrained from ſhedding the blood of ſuch as made no reſiſtance ; yet others, more cruel and blood-thirſty, maſſacred all they met : ſo that the ſtreets in ſome quarters of the city were ſeen covered with dead bodies, and ſwimming. in blood. However, not the leaſt injury was offered to thoſe who fled to the churches ; nay, the Goths themſelves conveyed thither, as to places of ſafety, ſuch as they were deſirous ſhould be ſpared. Many of the ſtatues of the gods that had been leſt entire by</p><p>the emperors is excellent pieces of art, were on this occaſion deſtroyed, either by the Goths, who, though moſtly Arians, were zealous Chriſtians, or by a dreadful ſtorm of thunder and lightning which fell at the ſame time upon the city, as if it had been ſent on purpoſe to complete with them the deſtruction of idolatry, and aboliſh the ſmall remains of pagan ſuperſtition. However, notwithſtanding theſe accountε, ſome affirm that</p><lb/><p>the city ſuffered very little at this time, not ſo much as when it was taken by Charles V.</p><p>Alaric did not long ſurvive the taking of Rome, being cut off by a violent fit of ſickneſs in the neighbourhood of Rhegium. After his death the affairs of Honorius ſeemed a little to revive by the defeat and death of Conſtantine and ſome other uſurpers ; but the provinces of Gaul, Britain, and Spain, were now<hi rend="sup">r</hi> almoſt entirely occupied by barbarians ; in which ſtate they continued till the death of Honorius, which happened in the year 423, after an unfortunate reign of 28 years.</p><p>After ſome uſurpations which took place on the death of Honorius, his nephew Valentinian III. was declared emperor of the weſt, and his mother Placidia regent during his minority. He was ſcarce ſeated on the throne, when the empire was attacked by the Huns under the celebrated Attila. The Romans, however, wretched and degenerate as they were, had they been unanimous, would even yet have been ſuperior to their enemies. The empreſs then had two celebrated generals, Bonifacius and Aetius ; who by their union might have ſaved the empire : but unhappily, through the treachery of Aetius, Bonifacius was obliged to revolt ; and a civil war enſued, in which he loſt his life. Aetius, however, notwithſtanding his treachery, was pardoned, and put at the head of the forces of the empire. He defended it againſt Attila with great ſpirit and ſucceſs, notwithſtanding the deplorable ſituation of affairs, till he was murdered by Valentinian with his own hand, on a ſuſpicion that he aſpired to the empire. But in the mean time the provinces, except Italy itſelf, were totally over·run by the barbarians. Genſeric king of the Vandals ravaged Africa and Sicily ; the Goths, Suevians, Burgundians, &amp;c. had taken poſſeſſion of Gaul and Spain ; and the Britons were oppreſſed by the Scots and Pict⅞, ſo that they were obliged to call in the Saxons to their aſſiſtance, as is related under the article England. In the year 455, Valentinian was murdered by one Maximus, whoſe wife he had raviſhed. Maximus immediately aſſumed the empire ; but felt ſuch violent anxieties, that he deſigned to reſign it and fly out of Italy, in order to enjoy the quiet of a private liſe. However, being diſſuaded from this by his friends, and his own wife dying ſoon after, he forced the empreſs Eudoxia to marry him. Eudoxia, who had tenderly loved Valentinian, provoked beyond meaſure at being married to his murderer, invited Genſeric king of the Vandals into Italy. This proved a moſt fatal ſeheme : for Genſeric immediately appeared before Rome ; a violent tumult enſued, in which Maximus loſt his liſe ; and the city was taken and plundered by Genſeric, who carried off what had been left by the Goths. A veſſel was loaded with coſtly ſtatues ; half the covering of the capitol, which was of braſs plated over with gold ; ſacred veſſels enriched with precious ſtones ; and thoſe which had been taken by Titus out of the temple of Jeruſalem ; all of which were loſt with</p><p>the veſſel in its paſſage to Africa.</p><p>Nothing could now be more deplorable than the ſtate</p><p>of the Roman affairs : nevertheleſs, the empire continued to exiſt for ſome years longer ; and even ſeemed to revive for a little under Marjoriar&gt;us, who was declared emperor in 458. He was a man of great courage, and poſſeſſed of many other excellent qualities. He</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
