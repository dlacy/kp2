<p><span class="font2">silver, ivory, bronze and marble, mostly the production of the best Greek artists, which adorned this magnificent group of buildings,&nbsp;must have made it the chief glory of this splendid city. This&nbsp;temple was begun by Augustus in 36 </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.,@@1 </span><span class="font2">after his Sicilian victory&nbsp;over Sextus Pompeius, and dedicated on the 9th of October 28 </span><span class="font1">B.c<sup>@@2 </sup></span><span class="font2">A glowing account of the splendours of these buildings is given&nbsp;by Propertius (ii. 2, iii. 31). Inside the cclla were statues of Apollo&nbsp;between Latona and Diana by Scopas, Cephisodotus and Timothcus&nbsp;respectively (Piin. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">II.N.</span><span class="font2"> xxxvi. 24, ,25, 32); beneath the base of&nbsp;the group were preserved the Sibylline books. The pediment had&nbsp;sculpture by Bupalus and Archermus of Chios (Piin. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">II.N.</span><span class="font2"> xxxvi.&nbsp;13), and on the apex was Apollo in a quadriga of gilt bronze.. The&nbsp;double door was covered with ivory reliefs of the death of the Niobids&nbsp;and the defeat of the Gauls at Delphi. The Ancyran inscription&nbsp;records that Augustus melted down eighty silver statues of himself&nbsp;and with the money “ offered golden gifts ” to this temple, dedicating them both in his own name and in the names of the original&nbsp;donors of the statues.<sup>@@3 </sup>The Sibylline books were preserved under&nbsp;the statue of Apollo (Suet. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Aug.</span><span class="font2"> 31); and within the cella were&nbsp;vases, tripods and statues of gold and silver, with a collection of&nbsp;engraved gems dedicated by Marcellus (see Piin. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">H.N.</span><span class="font2"> xxxvii. 11,&nbsp;xxxiv. 14). In the, porticus was a large library, with separate&nbsp;departments for Latin and Greek literature,@@<sup>4</sup> and a large hall where&nbsp;the senate occasionally met (Tac. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ann.</span><span class="font2"> ii. 37). Round the porticus,&nbsp;between the Numidian marble columns, were statues of the fifty&nbsp;Danaids, and opposite them their fifty bridegrooms on horseback&nbsp;(see Schol. on Pers. ii. 56). In the centre, before the steps of the&nbsp;temple, stood an altar surrounded by four oxen, the work of Myron&nbsp;(Prop. iii. 31, 5). In the centre of the,Palatine stood the palace&nbsp;of Augustus, built in the years following 36 </span><span class="font1">B.c., </span><span class="font2">and renewed&nbsp;after a fire in </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">A.D. </span><span class="font2">3. It contained a small temple of Vesta&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">{C.I.L.</span><span class="font2"> i. p. 317), dedicated on the 28th of April 12 </span><span class="font1">B.c., </span><span class="font2">when&nbsp;Augustus was elected </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">poniifex maximus.</span><span class="font2"> Augustus’s building&nbsp;was completely transformed by later emperors, but the name&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">domus Augustana</span><span class="font2"> was retained in official use. The Area .Apollinis&nbsp;and its group of buildings suffered in the fire of Nero, and were&nbsp;restored by Domi tian. The whole was finally destroyed in the&nbsp;great fire of 363 (Ammian. xxiii. 3, 3), but the Sibylline books were&nbsp;saved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To the north-west of the Area Palatina stood the Domus Tiberiana, a palace built by Tiberius on substructures of concrete which cro^yn the&nbsp;north-west slope of the hill and form a platform nowoccu pied&nbsp;by the Farnese gardens, overlooking the Clivus Victoriae.&nbsp;Caligula is said to have added to this palace on the side&nbsp;towards the Forum, making the temple of Castor into a&nbsp;vestibule, and to have connected it with the Capitol by a bridge whose&nbsp;piers were found by the temple of Augustus and the Basilica Julia;&nbsp;but this was destroyed after his death. At a later time the palace&nbsp;was extended so as to include the northern angle of the Palatine,&nbsp;which had once been covered with private houses. Among these&nbsp;were the dwellings of Q. Lutatius Catulus, Q. Hortensius, Scaurus,&nbsp;Crassus (Piin. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">II.N.</span><span class="font2"> xxxvi. 3, 24), whose house was afterwards&nbsp;bought by Cicero.<sup>@@5</sup> Many other wealthy Romans had houses on&nbsp;this part of the Palatine. The part now existing is little more than&nbsp;the gigantic substructure built to raise the principal rooms to the&nbsp;level of the top of the hill. The lowest parts of these face the Nova&nbsp;Via, opposite the Atrium Vestae, and many,storeys of, small vaulted&nbsp;rooms built in mixed brick and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">opus reticulatum</span><span class="font2"> rise one above&nbsp;the other to the higher levels.<sup>@@6</sup> The palace extends over the Clivus&nbsp;Victoriae, supported on lofty arches so as to leave the road unblocked; many travertine or marble stairs lead to the upper rooms,&nbsp;some starting from the Nova Via, others from the Clivus Victoriae.&nbsp;A large, proportion of these substructures consist of dark rooms,&nbsp;some with no means .of lighting, others with scanty borrowed light.&nbsp;Many small rooms and stairs scarcely 2 ft. wide can only have been&nbsp;used by* slaves. The ground floors on the,Nova Via and the Clivus&nbsp;Victoriae appear to have , been shops, judging from their wide&nbsp;openings, with travertine sills, grooved for the wooden fronts with&nbsp;narrow doors, which Roman shops seem always to have had—very&nbsp;like those now used in the East. The upper and principal rooms&nbsp;were ,once richly decorated with marble linings, columns and&nbsp;mosaics; but little of these now remains. The upper part of&nbsp;the palace, that above the. Clivus Victoriae, is faced wholly&nbsp;with brickwork, no </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">opus reticulatum</span><span class="font2"> being used as in the lower&nbsp;portions by the Nova Via. This marks a difference of date,&nbsp;and this is confirmed by the occurrence of brick stamps of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">2nd century </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2">The next great addition to the buildings of the Palatine was the magnificent suite of state apartments built by Domitian, over&nbsp;a deep natural valley running across the hill (see Plan).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The valley was filled up and the level of the new palace raised to a considerable height above the natural soil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Remains of a house, decorated with painting and rich marbles, exist under Domitian's peristyle, partly destroyed by the foundations&nbsp;of cast concrete which cut right through it. The floor of this house&nbsp;shows the original level, far below that of the Flavian palace. This&nbsp;building is connected with the palace of Caligula by a brandy&nbsp;subterranean passage leading into the earlier crypto-porticus. </span><span class="font1">ft&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">consists of a block of state-rooms,, in the- centre of which is a large&nbsp;open peristyle, with columns of oriental marble, at one end of which&nbsp;is the grand triclinium with magnificent paving of opus sectile in&nbsp;red and green basalt and coloured marbles, a piece of which is well&nbsp;preserved; next to the triclinium, on to whicn it opens with large&nbsp;windows, is a nymphaeum or room with marble-lined, fountain&nbsp;and recesses for plants and statues. On the opposite side of the&nbsp;peristyle is a large throne-room, the walls of which were adorned&nbsp;with rows of pavonazzetto and giallo columns and large marble&nbsp;niches, in which were colossal statues of porphyry and basalt; at&nbsp;one side of this is the basilica, with central nave and apse and narrow&nbsp;aisles, over which were galleries. The apse, in which was the&nbsp;emperor’s throne, is screened off by open marble cancelli, a part of&nbsp;which still exists. It is of great interest as showing the origin of&nbsp;the Christian basilica (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Basilica).<sup>@@7</sup> </span><span class="font2">On the other side of the&nbsp;throne-room is the lararium, with altar and pedestal for a statue;&nbsp;next to this is the grand staircase, which led to the upper rooms,&nbsp;now destroyed. The whole building, both floor and walls, was&nbsp;covered with the richest oriental marbles. Outside were colonnades&nbsp;or porticus,— on one side of cipollino, on the other of travertine,&nbsp;the latter stuccoed and painted. The magnificence of the whole,&nbsp;crowded with fine Greek sculpture and covered with polished&nbsp;marbles of the most brilliant colours, is difficult now to realize; a&nbsp;glowing description is given by, Statius </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">{Silv.</span><span class="font2"> iv. 11, 18; see also&nbsp;Plut. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Poplic.</span><span class="font2"> 15, and Mart. viii. 36). Doors were arranged in&nbsp;the throne-room and basilica so that the emperor could slip out&nbsp;unobserved and reach by a staircase (g on Plan) the crypto-porticus&nbsp;which communicates with Caligula’s palace. The vault of this&nbsp;passage was covered with mosaic of mixed marble and glass, a few&nbsp;fragments of which still remain; its walls were lined with rich&nbsp;marbles; it was lighted by a series of windows in the springing of&nbsp;the vault. This, as well as the Flavian palace, appears to have&nbsp;suffered more than once,from fire, and in many places important restorations of the time of Severus, and some as late as&nbsp;the 4th century, are evident. In 1720-28 extensive excavations&nbsp;were made here for the Farnese duke of Parma, and an immense&nbsp;quantity of statues and marble architectural fragments were discovered, many of which are now at Naples and elsewhere. Among&nbsp;them were sixteen beautiful fluted columns of pavonazzetto and&nbsp;giallo, fragments of the basalt statues, and an immense door-sill&nbsp;of Pentelic marble, now used for the high altar of the Pantheon;&nbsp;these all came from the throne-room. The excavations were carried&nbsp;on by Bianchini, wfio published a book on the subject.<sup>@@8</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the middle of the slopes of the Palatine, towards the Circus Maximus, are considerable remains of buildings set against the early&nbsp;wall and covering one of its projecting spurs, consisting&nbsp;in a series of rooms with a long Corinthian colonnade.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The rooms were partly marble-lined and partly decorated with painted stucco, on which are incised a number of&nbsp;interesting inscriptions and rude drawings. Here, in 1856, was&nbsp;found the celebrated caricature of the Crucified Christ, now in the&nbsp;Museo Kircheriano.<sup>@@9</sup> The inscription </span><span class="font1">CORINTHVS . EXIT. DE .&nbsp;PEDAGOGIO </span><span class="font2">suggests that this building was at one time used as&nbsp;a school, perhaps tor the imperial slaves.<sup>@@10</sup> A number of soldiers*&nbsp;names also occur, e.g. </span><span class="font1">HILAR VS . MI. V . D . N. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">{Hilarus miles&nbsp;vestitor dominl nostn</span><span class="font2"> ?); some are in mixed Latin and Greek&nbsp;characters. After one pair of names is inscribed </span><span class="font1">PEREG, </span><span class="font2">showing&nbsp;that they belonged to the corps called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">frumentarii</span><span class="font2"> stationed in, the&nbsp;Castra Peregrinorum on the Caelian. Most of these inscriptions&nbsp;appear to bt, as early as the ,1st century </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">A.D.<sup>@@11</sup> </span><span class="font2">These interesting&nbsp;graffiti have in great part perished during the last few years. Some&nbsp;inscriptions found in the larger rooms seem to indicate that the&nbsp;imperial wardrobe found a place in them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To the south of the Flavian state-rooms, on the side of the hill overlooking the Circus, was a building with a central peristyle&nbsp;(“ Palace of Domitian ” on Plan), which was excavated in 1775 and</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
