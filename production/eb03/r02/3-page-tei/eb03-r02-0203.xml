Before he ſet out for Rome, he gave his ſon Titus the command of the army that was to lay ſiege to Jeruſalem ; while he himſelſ went forward, and was met many miles from Rome by all the ſenate, and near half the inhabitants, who gave the ſincereſt teſtimonies of their joy, in having an emperor of ſuch great and experienced virtues. Nor did he in the leaſt diſappoint their expectations; being equally aſſiduous in rewarding merit, and pardoning his adverſaries ; in reforming the manners of the citizens, and ſetting them the beſt example in his own.</p><p>In the mean time, Titus carried on the war againſt the Jews with vigour, which ended in the terrible deſtruction of the city, mentioned under the article Jews. After which his ſoldiers would have crowned Titus as conqueror ; but he refuſed the honour, alleging that he was only an inſtrument in the hand of Heaven, that manifeſtly declared its wrath againſt the Jews. At Rome, however, all mouths were filled with the praiſes of the conqueror, who had not only ſhowed himſelf an excellent general, but a courageous combatant : his return, therefore,, in triumph, which he did with his father, was marked with all the magnificence and joy that was in the power of men to expreſs. All things that were eſteemed valuable or beautiful among men were brought to adorn this great occaſion. Among the rich ſpoils were expoſed vaſt quantities of gold taken out of the temple ; but the book of their law was not the feaſt remarkable amongſt the magnificent profuſion. A triumphal arch was erected upon this occaſion, on which were deſcribed all the victories of Titus over the Jews, which remains almoſt entire to this very day. Veſpaſian likewiſe built a temple to Peace, wherein were depoſited moſt of the Jewiſh ſpoils ; and having now calmed all the commotions in every part of the empire, he ſhut up the temple of Janus, which had been open about five or ſix years.</p><p>Veſpaſian having thus given ſecurity and peace to the empire, reſolved to correct numberleſs abuſes which had grown up under the tyranny of his predeceſtbrs. To effect this with greater eaſe, he joined Titus with him in the conſulſhip and tribunitial power, and in ſome meaſure admitted him a partner in all the higheſt offices of the ſtate. He began with reſtraining the licentiouſneſs of the army, and forcing them back to their priſtine diſcipline. He abridged the proceſſes that had been carried to an unreaſonable length in the courts of juſtice. He took care to rebuild ſuch parts of the city as had ſuffered in the late commotions ; particularly the Capitol, which had been lately burnt ; and which he now reſtored to more than former magnificence. He likewiſe built a famous amphitheatre, the ruins of which are to this day an evidence of its ancient grandeur. The other ruinous cities of the empire alſo ſhared his paternal care ; he improved ſuch as were declining, adorned others, and built many anew. In ſuch acts as theſe he paſſed a long reign of clemency and moderation ; ſo that it is ſaid, no man ſuffered by an unjuſt or a ſevere decree during his adminiſtration.</p><p>Julius Sabinus ſeem§ to be the only perſon who was treated with greater rigour than was uſual with this emperor, &gt;Sabinus was commander of a ſmall army in Gaul, and had declared himſelf emperor upon the death of Vitellius. However, his army was ſhortly after overcome by Veſpaſian’s general, and he himſelf compelled to ſeek ſafety by flight. He for ſome time wandered through the Roman provinces, without being diſcovered: but finding the purſuit every day become cloſer, he was obliged to hide himſelf in a cave ; in which hs remained concealed for no leſs than nine years, attended all the time by his ſaithful wife Empona, who provided proviſions for hi.a by day, and repaired to him by night. However, ſhe was at laſt diſcovered in the performance of this pious.office, and Sabinus was taken priſoner and carried to Rome. Great interceſſion was made to the emperor in his behalf : Empona herſelf appearing with her two children, and imploring her huſ-band’s pardon. However, neither her tears nor intrea-ties could prevail ; Sabinus had been too dangerous a rival for mercy ſo that, though ſhe and her children were ſpared, her huſhand ſuffered by the executioner.</p><p>But this ſeems to be the only inſtance in which he reſented paſt offences. He cauſed the daughter of Vitellius, his avowed enemy, to be married into a noble family, and he himſelf provided her a ſuitable fortune. One of Nero’s ſervants coming to beg ſor pardon for having once rudely thruſt him out of the palace, and inſulted him when in office, Veſpaſian only took his revenge by ſerving him juſt in the ſame manner. When any plots or conſpiracies were formed againſt him, he diſdained to puniſh the guilty, ſaying, That they de-ferved rather his contempt for their ignorance, than his reſentment ; as they ſeemed to envy him a dignity of which he daily experienced the uneaſineſs. His liberality towards the encouragement of arts and learning, was not leſs than his clemency. He ſettled a conſtant ſalary of 100,000 ſeſterces upon the teachers of rhetoric. He was particularly favourable to Joſephus, the Jewiſh hiſtorian. Quintilian the orator, and Pliny the naturaliſt, flouriſhed in his reign, and were highly eſteemed by him. He was no leſs an encourager of all other excellencies in art ; and invited the greateſt maſters and artificers from all parts of the world, making them conſiderable preſents, as he found occaſion.</p><p>Yet all his numerous acts of generoſity and magnificence could not preſerve his character from the imputation of rapacity and avarice. He revived many obſo-lete methods of taxation ; and even bought and ſold commodities himſelf, in order to increaſe his fortune» He is charged with advancing the moſt avaricious governors to the provinces, in order to ſhare their plunder on their return to Rome. He deſeended to ſome very unuſual and diſhonourable impoſts, even to the laying a tax upon urine. When his ſon Titus remonſtrated againſt the meanneſs of ſuch a tax, Veſpaſian taking a piece of money, demanded if the ſmell offended him ; and then added, that this very money was produced by urine. Butin excuſe for. this, we muſt obſerve, that the exchequer, when Veſpaſian came to the throne,, was ſo much exhauſted, that he informed the ſenate that it would require a ſupply of three hundred millions (of our money) to re-eſtabliſh the commonwealth» This neceſſity muſt naturally produce more numerous and heavy taxations than the empire had hitherto expe* rienced ; but while the provinces were thus obliged to</p></body></text></TEI>
