<p><span class="font0">the very slow carriage of heavy goods on canals. But this is not a fair comparison, as speed must be taken into account&nbsp;as well as price; and we have no hesitation in saying that&nbsp;upon well managed and economically-conducted railroads,&nbsp;goods of every kind can be carried, with proper precautions,&nbsp;quite as cheap as by any canal, and with three times the&nbsp;speed at least. A great deal remains yet to be done in this&nbsp;department of locomotive transit, and the question cannot&nbsp;be decided on any railway with certainty, till it has been&nbsp;some time in operation, and the mode of working and maintaining it, and of economising the locomotive power expenses, are reduced to a well regulated system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Many doubts were entertained, at an early period of the railway system, as to the performance of engines when snow&nbsp;lay on the rails to a depth which on the common roads interrupted the ordinary communications of the country ; they&nbsp;have however completely triumphed over this difficulty ; a&nbsp;striking proof of which took place on the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway; where the possibility of working the engines,&nbsp;under the above unfavourable circumstances, was put to&nbsp;the test on December 20,1836, in the deep cutting through&nbsp;the Cowran hills, where the snow had accumulated to the&nbsp;depth of four or five feet, when the Hercules engine came&nbsp;down on the morning of the above day. Numbers of the&nbsp;country people assembled to see how it would act in such&nbsp;an emergency, and to render any assistance which might be&nbsp;necessary. On arriving at the spot, however, the engine&nbsp;dashed right into the drift, clearing its way through, apparently without any difficulty ; the snow at the same time&nbsp;flying over the top of the engine chimney, like foam from&nbsp;the broken waves of a violent sea; and notwithstanding&nbsp;this and other similar obstructions, the train came down&nbsp;from Greenhead, twenty miles, in one hour and a quarter, and&nbsp;their times of arrival were properly kept up, whilst all the&nbsp;communications by the ordinary roads were more or less&nbsp;seriously obstructed, if not entirely cut off.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Hence any of the so often proposed plans for sweeping or scraping the rails will rarely be found necessary, much&nbsp;less the plan seriously proposed and patented so late as 1831,&nbsp;of making the rails hollow and filling them with hot water&nbsp;in winter. In the extreme case of rain succeeded by frost,&nbsp;thus forming a coat of ice upon the rails, it will generally&nbsp;be found sufficient to place a waggon, or any other empty&nbsp;light vehicle in front of the engine, which will break up the&nbsp;ice sufficiently to allow of the necessary adhesion. The&nbsp;effect of severe frosts on the road itself will be found of infinitely more consequence, and is an additional reason why&nbsp;drainage should be scrupulously attended to in countries&nbsp;where much cold is experienced. The manner in which&nbsp;frosts acts on common roads, is sufficient evidence of what&nbsp;may be expected on a railroad, if the water is not most carefully carried off from the ballasting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In America, for instance, where railways were first laid down on blocks, similar to the way they are constructed in&nbsp;England, it was found that their severe winters completely&nbsp;disorganised them ; splitting the blocks, throwing the rails&nbsp;out of guage, and even twisting them so as to render them&nbsp;unfit for the passage of the engines, and obliging the trains&nbsp;to travel at a reduced speed. From these causes, and as it&nbsp;was found necessary to relay the road after each winter,&nbsp;blocks have in a great measure been abandoned, longitudinal and cross sleepers being generally substituted, and laid&nbsp;on broken stones filled into trenches ; but the evil is yet&nbsp;only partially remedied. It may, however, in all cases, be&nbsp;set down as a general rule, that where timber can be obtained cheap, it should be used in preference to blocks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The difference, however, is necessarily so great between Iherailroadsin that country and this, as very much to preclude&nbsp;comparison. Some of theirs are constructed of plate rails&nbsp;2½ inches wide, by half an inch thick, and weighing from&nbsp;IOto 17lbs. per yard; their curves and inclinations are</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">such, from the nature of the country, as to render cross ties more frequently required than they are in English railroads. '&nbsp;Continuous stone bearings have also been tried in America ;&nbsp;also piles at three feet distance, as supports to the rails, which&nbsp;are spiked down to them without the intervention of any&nbsp;chairs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Several of their railroads are carried across valleys by means of wooden trestles, well braced together, and assisted&nbsp;by piles; the lower ends of which in soft ground are often left&nbsp;square instead of being pointed, as a means of affording additional stability. These sort of roads are in several cases&nbsp;carried over valleys of such a depth, as to occasion no small&nbsp;surprise to those only acquainted with the substantial embankments of England and most other parts of Europe. It&nbsp;must be confessed, however, that the Americans, in the expense of their railways, beat the old country hollow ; and&nbsp;there are many things which we should be glad to see copied from them ; we may instance their guards in the front&nbsp;of the engine to remove obstacles from the road, and their&nbsp;long and high carriages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Some of their lines are worked by horses at the rate of 15 miles per hour ; and on the locomotive lines, where the&nbsp;curves are bad, the driving wheels are placed next the fire&nbsp;box, and the front part of the engine is supported on a four-wheeled truck, to which it is attached by a vertical pivot,&nbsp;while the weight rests on friction rollers ; this management&nbsp;admits of a motion by which the wheels areinagreatmeasure&nbsp;assisted in their passage round the curves, which in some&nbsp;cases have not more than 300 feet radius, whilst in others&nbsp;they have gradients of 1 in 110, and inclined planes rising&nbsp;1 in 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Another striking departure from the method of constructing these w'orks commonly adopted in England, has been introduced by Mr. J. K. Brunel on the Great Western Railway, with a view to an increase in speed, and also to obtain a more solid road, on embankments particularly. Instead&nbsp;ofresting the supports of the rails, that is to say, the stone&nbsp;or wood bearings, whether longitudinal or transverse, on the&nbsp;ballasting, where the repairs to the railroad consist in continually packing more ballast under the bearings, as they&nbsp;subside through the weights passing over them, or from the&nbsp;various other causes which affect them, Mr. Brunel has&nbsp;fixed his bearings at certain points, so that they cannot rise&nbsp;up nor go down, whereas in the usual mode of construction, it&nbsp;has only been attempted to prevent them from going down.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The guage of the Great Western Railway is 7 feet 2½ inches from centre to centre of the rails, and the width be-1&nbsp;tween the two lines is 6 feet. The mode of construction'&nbsp;is as follows. (See Plate CCCCXX.) At every 15 feet in<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>length along the railway, beech piles are driven into the&nbsp;ground, at 15 feet distance apart, transversely ; they are&nbsp;driven from 8 to 10 feet in cuttings, and in embankments,&nbsp;they are in general sufficiently long to go about the same&nbsp;depth into the original ground on which the embankment&nbsp;stands. These piles are formed to the proper length, and&nbsp;driven in, without any being cut off their heads, which are&nbsp;nearly level with the top of the ballasting, and when this&nbsp;cannot be effected, they are drawn and redriven. They do&nbsp;not stand in the middle of each line of rails, as will be seen&nbsp;by referring to the above measures and the plate, but are&nbsp;nearer each outside rail of the tw o lines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Tothesepilesdoubleand single transverse ties, or sleepers, sometimes called transoms, are attached as follows : A square&nbsp;shoulder is cut, 1½ inches into the pile, on one side for the&nbsp;single ties, and on both sides for the double ones ; the single&nbsp;ties are 6 inches broad, and 9 inches deep ; the double ties&nbsp;are 6 inches broad, and 7 inches deep. They are made of&nbsp;American pine, and when let into the shoulders of the piles,&nbsp;they are securely bolted to them ; the double ties are 13&nbsp;inches, and the single ones 9 inches below the line of rails.&nbsp;On these are laid longitudinal timbers, 15 inches broad, and</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
