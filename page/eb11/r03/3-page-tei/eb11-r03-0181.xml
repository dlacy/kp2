Here he took his place at once among the leaders of the revolutionary party. His influence saved the town-hall from pillage on 19th September. On the 24th a <hi rend="italic">commission administrative</hi>  was formed, of which Rogier became president. The energetic measures of this body and of its successor, the <hi rend="italic">gouvernement provisoire, soon</hi>  freed the greater part of the country from the Dutch troops. Rogier was sent in October to suppress an outbreak among the colliers of Hainaut, and then as delegate of the provisional government to Antwerp, where the citadel still held out for Holland. He succeeded in arranging an armistice, and then, in the exercise of the absolute power with which he was invested, reorganized the entire administration of the city. He sat for Liège in the National Congress, voted for the establishment of a hereditary monarchy, and induced the congress to adopt the principle of an elective second chamber. In the long-drawn debates on the bestowal of the crown he ranged himself on the side of Louis Philippe : he first supported the candidature of Otto of Bavaria, and on his rejection declared for the duc de Nemours. Finally, when Louis Philippe declined the crown on behalf of his son, Rogier voted with the majority for Leopold of Saxe-Coburg. In June 1831 he was appointed governor of the province of Antwerp, a post rendered exceptionally difficult by the continued presence of Dutch troops in the citadel. In October 1832 he was made minister of the interior in the Goblet-Devaux cabinet. In the following June he intervened in a quarrel in the chamber of deputies between Devaux and the Opposition leader, Alexandre Gendebien, claimed a prior right to give satisfaction, and fought a duel, in which he was severely wounded. During his term of office he carried, in the teeth of violent opposition, a law that established in Belgium the first railways on the continent of Europe, and thus laid the foundation of her industrial development. Owing to dissensions in the cabinet, he retired in 1834, together with Lebeau, and resumed the governorship of Antwerp. On Lebeau’s return to power in 1840, Rogier became minister of public works and education. The proposals that he made in the latter capacity were defeated by the determined opposition of the Clerical party, andon the resignation of the ministry in 1841, Rogier gave his support to a compromise on the subject of education, which passed into law in 1842. He led the Liberal party in Opposition till 1847, when he formed a cabinet in which he held the ministry of the interior. He at once embarked on a programme of political and economic reform. He took effective steps to remedy the industrial distress caused by the decay of the Flemish linen trade. The limits of the franchise were •extended; and as the result of the liberal policy of the government Belgium alone escaped the revolutionary wave that spread over the Continent in 1848. He passed a law in 1850 organizing secondary education under the control of the State, and giving the clergy only the right of religious instruction. The Clerical party, though unable to defeat this measure, succeeded in shaking the position of the cabinet; and it was finally undermined, after Prince Louis Napoleon’s <hi rend="italic">coup P état</hi>  of 1851, by the hostility of the French government, which found its political exiles welcomed by the liberal cabinet at Brussels. Rogier retired in October 1852, but was brought back into office by the liberal reaction of 1857. He again became president of the council and minister of the interior in a cabinet of which Frère-Orban was the most conspicuous member. The first important measure passed by the ministry was one for the fortification of Antwerp. In i860 the fear of French designs on the independence of Belgium led to a movement of reconciliation with Holland, and inspired Rogier to write the only one of his numerous poems that is likely to survive, his national anthem, “ La Nouvelle Brabançonne.” Some of the ministers resigning in 1861, on the question of recognizing the kingdom of Italy, the cabinet was reconstructed, and Rogier exchanged the ministry of the interior for that of foreign affairs. In this capacity he achieved a diplomatic triumph in freeing the navigation of the Scheldt, and thus enabling Antwerp to become the second port on the mainland of Europe. Defeated at</p><p>Dinant, he sat for Tournai from 1863 till his death. His younger and more energetic colleague, Frere-Orban, gradually overshadowed his chief, and in 1868 Rogier finally retired from power. He continued, however, to take part in public life, and was elected president of the extraordinary session of the chamber of representatives in 1878. From this timb his age, his devoted patriotism and the unassuming simplicity of his life made him the idol of all classes. The fiftieth anniversary of the kingdom of Belgium in 1880, and two years later that of his entry into parliament, were the occasion of demonstrations in his honour. He died at Brussels on the 27th of May 1885, and his remains were accorded a public funeral.</p><p>See T. Juste, <hi rend="italic">Charles Regier, 1800-1885, d’après des documents inédits</hi>  (Verviers, 1885).</p><p>ROGUE, a word which came into use about the middle of the 16th century as a slang or “ cant ” term for a vagrant vagabond, answering to the modern “ tramp,” and was adopted into English legal phraseology together with “ vagabond ” in the Statute of Elizabeth 1572, “ rogue and vagabond ” and “ incorrigible rogue ” remaining as legal terms for certain classes of persons amenable to the law under the V agrancy Acts (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Vagrancy).</hi>  The act of Elizabeth defined “ rogues, vagabonds and sturdy beggars ” as including “ idle persons going about and using subtle craft and unlawful games and all persons whole and mighty in body, but having neither land nor master, nor able to give an account how they get their living and all common labourers using loitering and refusing to work for the wages commonly given ” (Sir G. Nicholls’ <hi rend="italic">History of the English Poor Law,</hi>  ed. 1898 by H. G. Willink, vol, i. 159). The word has now the general meaning of a knave or rascal, though also used (by meiosis) as a term of playful or tender banter and in various special applications <hi rend="italic">(e.g.</hi>  a “ rogue ” elephant, one who has been driven out by the herd and lives a solitary life, becoming very savage and destructive. Gardeners also apply the word to a plant which does not come true from seed, showing some variation from the type).</p><p>The derivation of the word has been much disputed. It has usually been referred to Fr. <hi rend="italic">rogue,</hi>  meaning proud, arrogant, which is variously derived from the Icelandic <hi rend="italic">hroke,</hi>  rook, long-winded talker, or Breton <hi rend="italic">rok,</hi>  proud, haughty; cf. Irish and Gaelic <hi rend="italic">rucas, </hi>pride. The <hi rend="italic">New English Dictionary,</hi>  however, rejects this derivation, and considers possible a connexion with another early “ cant ” word “ roger,” a begging vagabond pretending to be a poor university scholar.</p><p>ROHAN, the name of one of the most illustrious of the feudal families of France, derived from that of a small town in Morbihan, Brittany. The family appears to have sprung from the viscounts of Porhoet, and claims connexion with the ancient sovereigns of Brittany. Since the 12th century it held an important place in the history of Brittany, and strengthened its position by alliances with the greatest houses in France. It was divided into several branches, the eldest of which, that of the viscounts of Rohan, became extinct in 1527. Of the younger branches the most famous is that of Guéménée, from which sprang the branches of Montbazon, Soubise and Gie. The seigneurs of Frontenay, an offshoot of this last branch, inherited by marriage the property of the eldest branch of the house. Hercule de Rohan, duc de Montbazon (1568-1654) served Henry III. and Henry IV. against the League, and was made by Henry IV. governor of Paris and the Isle of France, and master of the hounds. His grandson, Louis de Rohan-Guéménée, the chevalier de Rohan, who was notorious for his dissolute life, conspired with the Dutch against Louis XIV. and was beheaded in Paris in 1674. In the 18th century the Soubise branch furnished several prelates, cardinals and bishops of Strassburg, among others the famous cardinal de Rohan, the hero of the affair of the diamond necklace. The seigneurs of Gie, a branch founded by Pierre de Rohan (i453~ 1513), a cadet of the branch of Guéménée and marshal of France, were conspicuous on the Protestant side during the wars of religion.
