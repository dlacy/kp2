<p><span class="font1">position had all the more inducement to devote themselves to the conscientious study and regular practice of the law. This was</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">f</span><span class="font1">jreatly encouraged by the action of Augustus in creating a class of icensed or patented jurists, privileged to give answers to questions&nbsp;submitted to them by the judges, and that </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ex auctoritate principis,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">and still more so, perhaps, by Hadrian’s reorganization of the imperial privy council, wherein a large proportion of the seats were&nbsp;assigned to jurists of distinction. With several of the emperors&nbsp;lawyers were amongst their most intimate and trusted friends.&nbsp;Again and again the office of privtorian prefect, the highest next&nbsp;the throne, was filled by them ; Papinian, Ulpian, and Paul all&nbsp;held it in the reigns of Septimius Severus and Alexander. Jurisprudence, therefore, was not merely an honourable and lucrative&nbsp;profession under the new arrangements, but a passport to places of&nbsp;eminence in the state ; and till the death of Alexander the ranks&nbsp;of the jurists never failed to be recruited by men of position and&nbsp;accomplishment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Extension of Citizenship to the Empire generally. —</span><span class="font1">It must have been between the years 212 and 217 that Caracalla published his&nbsp;constitution conferring citizenship on all the free inhabitants of the&nbsp;empire. Far-reaching as were its consequences, the primary purpose was purely fiscaL Augustus had imposed a tax of five per&nbsp;cent, on inheritances and bequests, except where the whole succession was worth less than 100,000 sesterces or the heir or legatee&nbsp;was a near kinsman of the deceased. It was continued by his successors, and was very profitable, thanks to the propensity of the&nbsp;well-to-do classes for single blessedness, followed by testamentary&nbsp;distribution of their fortunes amongst their friends. But it affected&nbsp;only the successions of Roman citizens, so that the great mass of&nbsp;the provincials escaped it. Caracalla, being needy, not only increased it temporarily to ten per cent., but widened the area of its&nbsp;operation by elevating all his free subjects to the rank of citizens.&nbsp;The words of Ulpian are very inclusive,—“in urbe Romano qui&nbsp;sunt . . . cives Romani effecti sunt ”; but there is considerable&nbsp;diversity of opinion as to their meaning, caused by the fact that&nbsp;peregrins are still mentioned by some of Caracalla’s successors.&nbsp;Limit the constitution, however, as we may, there can be no question of its immense importance. By conferring citizenship on the&nbsp;provincial peregrins it subjected them in all their relations to the&nbsp;law of Rome, and qualified them for taking part in many transactions both </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">inter vivos</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">mortis causa</span><span class="font1"> which previously had&nbsp;been incompetent for them. It did away with the necessity for&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus gentium</span><span class="font1"> as a separate positive system. Its principles and&nbsp;its doctrines, it is true, survived, and were expanded and elaborated as freely and successfully as ever ; but they were so dealt with&nbsp;as part and parcel of the civil law of Rome, which had ceased to&nbsp;be Italian and become imperial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Legislation of Comitia and Senate.—</span><span class="font1">Augustus, clinging as much as possible to the form of republican institutions, thought it ex-</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">f</span><span class="font1">iedient not to break with the old practice of submitting his legis-ative proposals to the vote of the comitia of the tribes. Some of them were far from insignificant. Besides various measures for&nbsp;the amendment of the criminal law, three groups of enactments of&nbsp;considerable importance owed their authorship to him, the first to&nbsp;improve domestic morality and encourage fruitful marriage, the&nbsp;second to abate the evils that had arisen from the too lavish admission of liberated slaves to the privileges of citizenship, and the&nbsp;third to regulate procedure in public prosecutions and private&nbsp;litigations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The first group included the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lex Julia de adultcriis coercendis</span><span class="font1"> of</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">736 and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lex Julia et Papia Poppaea,—</span><span class="font1">the latter a voluminous matrimonial code, which for two or three centuries exercised such&nbsp;an influence as to be regarded as one of the sources of Roman law&nbsp;almost quite as much as the XII. Tables or Julian’s consolidated&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Edict.</span><span class="font1"> It was often spoken of as the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lex Caducaria,</span><span class="font1"> one of its&nbsp;most remarkable provisions being that unmarried persons (within&nbsp;certain ages and under certain qualifications) should forfeit entirely&nbsp;anything to which they were entitled under a testament, and that&nbsp;married but childless persons should forfeit one-half, the lapsed&nbsp;provisions </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(caduca')</span><span class="font1"> going to the other persons named in the will&nbsp;who were qualified in terms of the statute, and failing them to the&nbsp;fisc. However well intended, the language of Juvenal and others&nbsp;raises doubts whether the law did not really do more harm than&nbsp;good. By the Christian emperors many of its provisions were&nbsp;repealed, while others fell into disuse ; and in tne Justinianian&nbsp;books hardly a trace is left of its distinctive features.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The second group included the zElia-Sentian law of the year 4 a.d., the Fufia-Caninian law of the year 8, and the Junia-Norban&nbsp;law of the year 19,—the last passed in the reign of Tiberius, but was&nbsp;probably planned by Augustus. The JElia-Sentian law regulated&nbsp;the matter of manumission, with the result that a manumittee&nbsp;might on that event, and according to circumstances minutely&nbsp;described, become (1) either a citizen, or (2) a freedman with the&nbsp;possibility of attaining citizenship by a process indicated in the&nbsp;statute, or (3) a freedman who, because of his bad character, was&nbsp;forbidden to reside within a hundred miles of Rome and denied the&nbsp;hope of ever becoming a citizen </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(libertus dediticius).</span><span class="font1"> The Junian</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font1">law was passed in order to define more precisely the status in the meantime of those freedmen who had a potentiality of citizenship.&nbsp;It did so by assimilating them to the colonial Latins, denying to&nbsp;them the rights of a citizen proper so far as concerned family and&nbsp;succession, but conceding to them all the patrimonial rights of a&nbsp;citizen and the fullest power of dealing with their belongings so&nbsp;long as not </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">mortis causa</span><span class="font1"> and to the prejudice of their patrons.&nbsp;This was the Junian Latinity so prominent in the pages of Gaius,&nbsp;but of which our limits exclude any detailed description.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The third group of enactments referred to included the two </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Leges Juliac judiciariae, of</span><span class="font1"> which we know but little. That regulating&nbsp;procedure in private litigations is the same that is mentioned by&nbsp;Gaius as having completed the work of the Æbutian law in substituting the formular system for that </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">per legis actiones.</span><span class="font1"> It must&nbsp;have been a somewhat comprehensive statute, as a passage in the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vatican Fragments</span><span class="font1"> refers to a provision of its 27th section ; and&nbsp;our ignorance of its contents therefore, beyond one or two trifling&nbsp;details, is the more to be regretted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">From the time of Tiberius onwards it was the senate that did the work of legislation, for the simple reason that the comitia were&nbsp;no longer fit for it. And very active it seems to have been. This&nbsp;may have been due to some extent to the fact that so many professional jurists, aware from their practice of the points in which&nbsp;the law required amendment, possessed seats in the imperial&nbsp;council, where the drafts of the senatusconsults were prepared. It&nbsp;was the senatusconsults that were the principal statutory factors of&nbsp;what was called by both emperors and jurists the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus novum,—</span><span class="font1">law&nbsp;that departed often very widely from the principles of the old </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus&nbsp;civile,</span><span class="font1"> that was much more in accordance with those of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Edict,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">and that to a great extent might have been introduced through its&nbsp;means had not the authority of the prætors been overshadowed by&nbsp;that of the prince. In the end of the 2d and the beginning of&nbsp;the 3d century the supremacy of the latter in the senate became&nbsp;rather too pronounced, men quoting the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">oratio</span><span class="font1"> in which he had&nbsp;submitted to it a project of law instead of the resolution which&nbsp;gave it legislative effect. No doubt it must have been carefully&nbsp;considered beforehand in the imperial council, and rarely stood in&nbsp;need of further discussion ; but the ignoring of the formal act that&nbsp;followed it tended unduly to emphasize the share borne in it by the&nbsp;sovereign, and made it all the easier for the emperors after Alexander&nbsp;Severus to dispense altogether with the time-honoured practice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Consolidated Edictum Perpetuum. —</span><span class="font1">The edicts of the prætors, which had attained very considerable proportions before the fall of&nbsp;the republic, certainly received some additions in the early empire.&nbsp;But those magistrates did not long enjoy the same independence&nbsp;as of old ; there was a greater </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">imperium</span><span class="font1"> than theirs in the state,&nbsp;before which they hesitated to lay hands on the law with the boldness of their predecessors. They continued as before to publish&nbsp;annually at entry on office the edicts that had been handed down&nbsp;to them through generations ; but their own additions were soon&nbsp;limited to mere amendments rendered necessary by the provisions&nbsp;of some senatusconsult that affected the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus honorarium.</span><span class="font1"> They&nbsp;ceased to be that </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">viva vox juris civilis</span><span class="font1"> which they had been in the&nbsp;time of Cicero ; the emperor, if any one, was now entitled to the&nbsp;epithet ; the annual edict had lost its </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">raison d'être.</span><span class="font1"> Hadrian was&nbsp;of opinion that the time had come for writing its “explicit,” and&nbsp;giving it another and a more enduring and authoritative shape,—&nbsp;for so fashioning and so sanctioning it that it might be received&nbsp;as law, and not merely as edict, throughout the length and breadth&nbsp;of the empire. He accordingly commissioned Salvius Julianus,&nbsp;urban prætor at the time, to revise it, with a view to its approval&nbsp;by the senate as part of the statute law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The révisai, unfortunately, like the XII. Tables, is no longer extant. It is only a very slight account we have of the revision,—&nbsp;a line or two in Eutropius and Aurelius Victor, and a few lines in&nbsp;two of Justinian’s prefaces to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Digest.</span><span class="font1"> We may assume, from&nbsp;what is said there, that there were both abridgment and rearrangement of the edicts of the urban prætor ; but the question remains&nbsp;how far Julian consolidated with them those of the peregrin prætor&nbsp;and other officials who had contributed to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus honorarium.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">Those of the curule ædiles, we are told, were included ; Justinian&nbsp;says that they formed the last part of Julian’s work, and may have&nbsp;been a sort of appendix. There is reason to believe that so much&nbsp;of the edicts of the provincial governors as differed from those of&nbsp;the prætors were also incorporated in it, and that the edicts of the&nbsp;peregrin prætors, in so far as they contained available matter not&nbsp;embodied in those of their urban colleagues or the provincial&nbsp;governors, were dealt with in the same way. The consolidation&nbsp;got the name of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Edictum Perpetuum</span><span class="font1"> in a sense somewhat different&nbsp;from that formerly imputed to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">édicta perpétua</span><span class="font1"> as distinguished from&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">edicta repentina,</span><span class="font1"> and, after approval by Hadrian,' seems to have&nbsp;been formally sanctioned by senatusconsult. It was thus a closed&nbsp;chapter so far as the prætors were concerned ; for, though it may&nbsp;have continued for a time to hold its place on their album with its&nbsp;formularies of actions, they had no longer any power to alter or&nbsp;make additions to it. It liad ceased to be a mere efflux of their&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">imperium</span><span class="font1"> and had become matter of statute ; and its interpréta-</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
