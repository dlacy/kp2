<p><span class="font0">superintendent begins to pass through the haul. A rope attached to the capstan is passed through the nippers, and&nbsp;attached to the end of the haul. The haul is then coiled&nbsp;gradually into the kettle, and the capstan is moved round.&nbsp;The haul is thus drawn slowly through the tar, and the&nbsp;superfluous tar squeezed out of it as it passes through the&nbsp;nippers, the superintendent regulating the weight on the&nbsp;lever, so as to produce the required pressure ; and the end&nbsp;of the haul, as it comes from the capstan, is coiled away, or&nbsp;reeled upon large reels. In this operation the heat of the&nbsp;tar is the most important point to be attended to. If it be&nbsp;too hot, the yarn will be charred ; and if too cold, it will be&nbsp;black, whereas yam intended to be made into ropes should&nbsp;be of a bright-brown colour. The proper heat is indicated,&nbsp;as was before stated, by a scum closing over the surface of&nbsp;the tar, which takes place at</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">about 212° Fahrenheit. If</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">this scum do not rise, the tar</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">is too cold ; and if there be</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">an appearance of ebullition,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">the tar is too hot.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">The yam is now ready for</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">the next operation, which is</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">the making of the strands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This comes under the head</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">of laying. The place where</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">this and the subsequent</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">operations are carried on is</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">termed the laying-walk ; it is generally part of the alley of which the spinning-walk forms a portion, and it may be&nbsp;of such a width as to allow of many ropes being made at&nbsp;one time. The fixtures of this walk consist of tackle-boards and wheels for twisting strands, and stakes and stake-heads for supporting them. The tackle-board for twisting&nbsp;large strands is fixed at the head, and is represented in fig.&nbsp;6 ; </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">aa</span><span class="font0"> strong upright posts, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">bb</span><span class="font0"> a plank pierced with holes&nbsp;corresponding to the</span></p>

Corresponding to every twisting apparatus, at the head&nbsp;there is a row of bearers&nbsp;or stake-hcads for sup</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font0">porting the strands when twisting, and extending from the top to the bottom of the walk. These&nbsp;are represented in fig. 9, where </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">aa</span><span class="font0"> is an&nbsp;upright post, called the stake, firmly&nbsp;fixed, and standing four feet above&nbsp;the ground ; and ύ the stake-head, let&nbsp;through a mortise in the upright at a.&nbsp;foot below the head of the post. In&nbsp;the stake-head there are upright pins,&nbsp;between which the strands are laid,&nbsp;as seen by the drawing. There are&nbsp;also posts at the head and foot for fastening the yarns to when run out for laying. As twisting&nbsp;the strands shortens them, it is necessary to provide at the&nbsp;foot moveable machines for communicating twist. These&nbsp;are called sledges; the largest are formed as in fig. 10, and&nbsp;the smaller sizes as in fig. 11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In fig. 10, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">aa</span><span class="font0"> corresponds to the tackle-board, and is called a breast-board ; it is bolted to the uprights </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">bb,</span><span class="font0"> which again are firmly fixed and stayed to the frame </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">cccc.</span><span class="font0"> The&nbsp;part of the frame behind the uprights is called the tail of&nbsp;the sledge, and on it are laid weights to afford pressure&nbsp;enough to keep the strands stretched. These weights consist of old tar-barrels filled with clay, and are called press-barrels. In laying large ropes, sufficient pressure cannot be&nbsp;obtained by the barrels ; and in that case a double block&nbsp;and tackle is used, one end being fastened to a strong bolt&nbsp;behind the sledge, and the other to the tail of the sledge,&nbsp;and with the tackle-fall a turn or two is taken round a&nbsp;post. The smaller sledges (fig. 11) have only one upright&nbsp;post, to which some one of the wheels, similar to fig. 8, is&nbsp;fixed ; and they have likewise two trucks to run on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Of the smaller implements used, the first are the tops (fig. 12) for laying the strands into&nbsp;a rope. These consist of conical&nbsp;blocks of wood, of different sizes,&nbsp;having three equidistant grooves&nbsp;along their surface, and pins through&nbsp;them laterally, serving for handles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A piece of soft rope is attached to each handle of the top by its bight,&nbsp;and the ends are used to wrap round&nbsp;the rope in the process of laying.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">These ropes are called tails. When the top is very large, it requires to&nbsp;be supported on a sledge, as shown in fig. 13 ; and in that</span></p>
