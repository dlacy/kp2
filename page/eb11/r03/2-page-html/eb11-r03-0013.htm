<p><span class="font0">set to work. And thus originated his first novel of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pamela; or. Virtue Rewarded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But not forthwith, as is sometimes supposed. Proceeding with the compilation of his model letter-writer, and seeking,&nbsp;in his own words, “ to instruct handsome girls, who were obliged&nbsp;to go out on service . . . how to avoid the snares that might be&nbsp;laid against their virtue ”—a danger which appears to have&nbsp;always abnormally preoccupied him—he came to recollect a&nbsp;story he had heard twenty years earlier, and had often proposed&nbsp;to other persons for fictitious treatment. It occurred to him&nbsp;that it would make a book of itself, and might moreover be told&nbsp;wholly in the fashion most congenial to himself, namely, by&nbsp;letters. Thereupon, with some domestic encouragement, he&nbsp;completed it in a couple of months, between the 10th of November 1739 and the 10th of January 1740. In November 1740&nbsp;it was issued by Messrs Rivington &amp; Osbom, who, a few weeks&nbsp;afterwards (January 1741), also published the model letter-writer under the title of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Letters written to and for Particular&nbsp;Friends, on the most Important Occasions.</span><span class="font0"> Both books were&nbsp;anonymous. The letter-writer was noticed in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Gentleman’s&nbsp;Magazine</span><span class="font0"> for January, which also contains a brief announcement as to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pamela,</span><span class="font0"> already rapidly making its way without&nbsp;waiting for the reviewers. A second edition, it was stated, was&nbsp;expected; and such was its popularity, that not to have read it&nbsp;was judged “ as great a sign of want of curiosity as not to have&nbsp;seen the French and Italian dancers ”—</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Le.</span><span class="font0"> Mme Chateauneuf&nbsp;and the Fausans, who were then delighting the town. In&nbsp;February a second edition duly appeared, followed by a third&nbsp;in March and a fourth in May. At public gardens ladies held&nbsp;up the book to show they had got it; Dr Benjamin Slocock of&nbsp;Southwark openly commended it from the pulpit; Pope praised&nbsp;it; and at Slough, when the heroine triumphed, the enraptured&nbsp;villagers rang the church bells for joy. The other volume of&nbsp;“ familiar letters”’ consequently fell into the background in the&nbsp;estimation of its author, who, though it went into several&nbsp;editions during his lifetime, never acknowledged it. Yet it&nbsp;scarcely deserves to be wholly neglected, as it contains many&nbsp;useful details and much shrewd criticism of lower middle-class&nbsp;life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For the exceptional success of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pamela</span><span class="font0"> there was the obvious excuse of novelty. People were tired of the old “ mouthy ”&nbsp;romances about impossible people doing impossible things.&nbsp;Here was a real-life story, which might happen to any one—a&nbsp;story which aroused curiosity and arrested attention—which&nbsp;was not exclusively about “ high life,” and which had, in&nbsp;addition, a moral purpose, since it was avowedly “ published in&nbsp;order to cultivate the principles of virtue and religion in the&nbsp;minds of the youth of both sexes.” Whether it had exactly&nbsp;this effect, or owed its good fortune chiefly to this proclamation,&nbsp;may be doubted. The heroine in humble life who resists the&nbsp;licentious advances of her master until he is forced to marry her,&nbsp;does not entirely convince us that her watchful prudence and&nbsp;keen eye for the main chance have not, in the long run, quite as&nbsp;much to do with her successful defence as her boasted innocence&nbsp;and purity. Nor is the book without passages which more than&nbsp;smack of an unpleasant pruriency. Nevertheless, in its extraordinary gift of minute analysis; in its intimate knowledge of&nbsp;feminine character; in the cumulative power of its shuffling,&nbsp;loose-shod style, and, above all, in the unquestionable earnestness and sincerity of the writer, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pamela</span><span class="font0"> had qualities&nbsp;which—particularly in a dead season of letters—sufficiently&nbsp;account for its favourable reception by the contemporary&nbsp;public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Such a popularity, of course, was not without its drawbacks. That it would lead to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Anti-Pamelas,</span><span class="font0"> censures of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pamela</span><span class="font0"> and all the spawn of pamphlets which spring round&nbsp;the track of a sudden success, was to be anticipated. One of&nbsp;the results to which its rather sickly morality gave rise was&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Joseph Andrews</span><span class="font0"> (1742) of Fielding </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">{q.υ.}.</span><span class="font0"> But there are&nbsp;two other works prompted by </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pamela</span><span class="font0"> which need brief notice&nbsp;here. One is the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Apology for the Life of Mrs Shamela Andrews,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">a clever and very gross piece of raillery which appeared in</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">April 1741, and by which Fielding is supposed to have preluded to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Joseph Andrews.</span><span class="font0"> Fielding’s own works contain no reference to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Shamela.</span><span class="font0"> But Richardson in his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Correspondence,</span><span class="font0"> both printed and unprinted, roundly attributes it to the&nbsp;writer who was to be his rival; and it is also assigned to Fielding by other contemporaries </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">{Hist. MSS. Commn.,</span><span class="font0"> Rept. 12,&nbsp;App. Pt. IX. p. 204). All that can be said is, that Fielding’s&nbsp;authorship cannot be proved. If it could, it would go far&nbsp;to justify the after animosity of Richardson to Fielding—&nbsp;much farther, indeed, than what Richardson described as&nbsp;the “lewd and ungenerous engraftment ” of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Joseph Andrews.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">The second noteworthy result of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pamda</span><span class="font0"> was </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pamela’s Conduct in High Life</span><span class="font0"> (September 1741), a spurious sequel by John&nbsp;Kelly of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Universal Spectator.</span><span class="font0"> Richardson tried to prevent&nbsp;its appearance, and, having failed, set about two volumes of&nbsp;his own, which followed in December, and professed to depict&nbsp;his heroine “ in her exalted condition.” But the public interest in Pamela had practically ceased with her marriage, and&nbsp;the author’s continuation, like other continuations—particularly continuations prompted by extraneous circumstances —&nbsp;attracted no permanent attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">About 1744 we begin to hear something of the progress of Richardson’s second and greatest novel, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Clarissa; or,&nbsp;the History of a Young Lady,</span><span class="font0"> usually miscalled </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Clarissa Har-lowe.</span><span class="font0"> The first edition was in seven volumes, two of which&nbsp;came out in November 1747, two more in April 1748 and&nbsp;the last three in December. Upon the title-page of this, of&nbsp;which the mission was as edifying as that of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pamela,</span><span class="font0"> its object&nbsp;was defined as showing the distresses that may attend the&nbsp;misconduct both of parents and children in relation to&nbsp;marriage. Virtue, in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Clarissa,</span><span class="font0"> is not “ rewarded,” but hunted&nbsp;down and outraged. The heroine, no longer an opportunist&nbsp;servant-girl, is a most pure, refined and beautiful young&nbsp;woman, invested with every attribute to attract and charm,&nbsp;while her pursuer, Lovelace, the libertine hero of the book—&nbsp;a personage of singular dash and vivacity, in spite of his worthlessness—is drawn with extraordinary tenacity of power.&nbsp;The wronged Clarissa eventually dies of grief, and her coldblooded betrayer, whom strict justice would have hanged, is&nbsp;considerately killed in a duel by her soldier cousin. Of the&nbsp;genius of the story there can be no doubt. Nor is there any&nbsp;doubt as to the ability shown in the delineation of the two chief&nbsp;characters, to whom the rest are merely subordinate. The&nbsp;chief drawbacks of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Clarissa</span><span class="font0"> are its merciless prolixity (seven&nbsp;volumes, which only cover eleven months); the fact that&nbsp;(like </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pamela}</span><span class="font0"> it is told by letters; and a certain haunting and&nbsp;uneasy feeling that many of the heroine’s obstacles are only&nbsp;molehills which should have been readily surmounted. As to&nbsp;its success, accentuated as this was by its piecemeal method&nbsp;of publication, there has never been any question. Clarissa’s&nbsp;sorrows set all England sobbing, and her fame and her fate&nbsp;spread rapidly to the Continent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Between </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Clarissa</span><span class="font0"> and Richardson’s next work appeared the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Tom Jones</span><span class="font0"> of Fielding—a rival by no means welcome to the&nbsp;elder writer, although a rival who generously (and perhaps&nbsp;penitently) acknowledged </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Clarissa’s</span><span class="font0"> rare merits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ Pectus inaniter angit Irritat, mulcet, falsis terroribus implet</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Ut Magus,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Fielding had written in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Jacobite’s Journal.</span><span class="font0"> But even this could not console Richardson for the popularity of the&nbsp;“ spurious brat ” whom Fielding had made his hero, and his&nbsp;next effort was the depicting of a genuine fine gentleman—&nbsp;a task to which he was incited by a chorus of feminine worshippers. In the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History of Sir Charles Grandison, “</span><span class="font0"> by the&nbsp;Editor of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pamela</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Clarissa</span><span class="font0"> ” (for he still preserved the&nbsp;fiction of anonymity), he essayed to draw a perfect model&nbsp;of manly character and conduct In the pattern presented&nbsp;there is, however, too much buckram, too much ceremonial—&nbsp;in plain words, too much priggishness—to make him the desired exemplar of propriety </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">in excel sis.</span><span class="font0"> Yet he is not entirely&nbsp;a failure, still less is he to be regarded as no more than “ the</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
