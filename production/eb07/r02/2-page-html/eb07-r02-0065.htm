<p><span class="font0">son then eminent in his profession. From school he was sent to the university of St Andrews, where his progress was&nbsp;so rapid, that he was made professor of philosophy soon&nbsp;after he took the degree of A. M.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The magistrates of Edinburgh having petitioned the king to found a university in that city, they obtained a charter,&nbsp;by which they were allowed all the privileges of a university, which was built in 1582, and Mr Rollock was chosen&nbsp;principal and professor of divinity. He was soon famous&nbsp;in the university on account of his lectures, and among his&nbsp;countrymen at large for his persuasive mode of preaching.&nbsp;In the year 1593, Rollock and others were appointed by&nbsp;parliament to confer with the popish lords ; and in the following year he was one of those made choice of by the&nbsp;General Assembly to present his majesty with a paper entitled “ The dangers which, through the impunity of excommunicated papists, traffickers with the Spaniards, and&nbsp;other enemies of the religion and state, are imminent to the&nbsp;true religion professed within this realm, his majesty’s person, crown, and liberty of this our native country.” Their&nbsp;zeal against popery was carried to excess, and they seem&nbsp;to have been of opinion, that it was incumbent on the civil&nbsp;magistrate to punish idolatry with death. In the year 1595,&nbsp;he was empowered, along with others, to visit the different&nbsp;universities in Scotland, with a view to inquire into the&nbsp;doctrine and practice of the different masters, the discipline&nbsp;adopted by them, and the state of their rents and living,&nbsp;which they were ordered to report to the next General Assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">He was chosen moderator of the General Assembly in the year 1597, at which period he was fortunate enough to obtain the redress of several glaring abuses. The greater part&nbsp;of his life was spent in conducting the affairs of the church,&nbsp;yet Spotswood assures us that he would rather have' preferred retirement and study. Indeed the feebleness of his&nbsp;constitution was not equal to the hurry and bustle of public life, and it led him to prefer the retirement of study.&nbsp;He was very much affected with the stone, the pains of&nbsp;which he bore with the fortitude and resignation of a Christian. He died at Edinburgh on the last day of February&nbsp;1598, in the forty-third year of his age. Short as his life&nbsp;was, he published many works, of which the following is a&nbsp;catalogue. A Commentary on the first book of Beza’s&nbsp;Questions ; on St Paul’s Epistle to the Ephesians ; on the&nbsp;prophet Daniel ; a Logical Analysis of St Paul’s Epistle to&nbsp;the Romans ; some Questions and Answers concerning the&nbsp;Covenant of Grace and the Sacraments ; a Treatise of Effectual Calling ; a Commentary on the Epistles of Paul to the&nbsp;Thessalonians and Philemon ; on fifteen select Psalms ; on&nbsp;the Gospel of St John, with a Harmony of the four Evangelists upon theDeath, Resurrection, and Ascension of Jesus&nbsp;Christ ; certain Sermons on several places of St Paul’s&nbsp;Epistles ; a Commentary on the Epistle to the Colossians ;&nbsp;a Logical Analysis of the Epistle to the Hebrews ; of the&nbsp;Epistle to the Galatians ; a Commentary upon t he first two&nbsp;chapters of the first Epistle of St Peter ; a Treatise of Justification, and another of Excommunication. AH these,&nbsp;except the Sermons, were written in Latin. Of the pious&nbsp;and learned author, a more particular account may be found&nbsp;in a volume printed under the subsequent title : “ De Vita&nbsp;et Morte Roberti Rollok, Academiæ Edinburgenæ Primarii, Narrationes, auctoribus Georgio Robertson et Henrico&nbsp;Charteris.” Edinb. 1826, 4 to. Robertson’s biographical&nbsp;tract was originally published in 1599. That of Charteris&nbsp;was printed from a manuscript in the public library of the&nbsp;university.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">ROMAN CATHOLICS Under the head History (Ecclesiastical) will be found an account of the rise&nbsp;and progress of that religious system which, before tbe sixteenth century, held undisputed sway in what was called&nbsp;the Christian world. Under the head Reformation is&nbsp;given a history of the successful struggles made by sevetal&nbsp;of the states of Europe to deliver themselves from priestly&nbsp;domination ; and for a view of the theological tenets of the&nbsp;Roman Catholics, we may refer to the articles Pope, Popery, Purgatory, &amp;c. It only remains that we shortly&nbsp;notice the extent to which the Roman Catholic faith prevails&nbsp;in the world at the present day, and the political state of its&nbsp;adherents in our own country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There is no country where popery is the established reli gion, in the same sense in which the Churches of England&nbsp;and Scotland are the established religion of Britain. The&nbsp;Catholic clergy everywhere claim </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">independent,</span><span class="font0"> if not supreme authority, and never form any political alliance with&nbsp;the state. In some countries, however, popery is not only&nbsp;the religion of the government, but also exclusively, or almost exclusively, of the people ; and to that extent it may&nbsp;be called the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">established religion</span><span class="font0"> of the state. In others,&nbsp;the people are divided between the catholic and the protestant faith, and both are recognised by the government.&nbsp;The cruelty and oppression which have been perpetrated by&nbsp;religious zealots, ambitious priests, and crafty rulers, under&nbsp;the sacred name of religion, have given occasion to the infidel&nbsp;and the scoffer to cast on Christianity itself the reproach&nbsp;which is due only to fanaticism and bigotry. Tothisreproach&nbsp;both Catholic and Protestant are liable ; but there can be no&nbsp;doubt, that in the efforts,of the Church of Rome to maintain&nbsp;its ancient dominion over the human mind, it has been more&nbsp;unscrupulous in the use of persecution than the Protestant&nbsp;powers. Happily, however, the fierceness of persecution has&nbsp;now greatly abated in catholic countries ; and, on the other&nbsp;hand, Catholics are tolerated in every protestant state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In France the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Charte</span><span class="font0"> gives freedom of worship to all religions; butabout 14-15ths of the people belong to the Catholic Church, the small remainder being Protestants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In Switzerland, outer Appenzell, almost the whole of Berne, Basel, Schaffhausen, Vaud, and Neufchatel, the greater part&nbsp;of Glarus, Grisons, Aargau, Thurgau, and Geneva, and the&nbsp;minority in Friburg, Soleure, and St. Gall, profess Calvinism.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Catholicism</span><span class="font0"> is professed exclusively in Lucerne, Uri, Schwitz,&nbsp;Unterwald, Zug, inner Appenzell, Fessin, and Valais ; by&nbsp;the majority in Friburg, Soleure, and St. Gall ; and by the&nbsp;minority in theother cantons. About 12-20ths of the Swiss&nbsp;are Protestant; the remainder Catholics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In Belgium all religions are freely professed; butcatho-licism is the religion of almost the entire nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In Holland all religions are professed with equal freedom ; but Calvinism is the religion of the state. The Catholics&nbsp;are comparatively few.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In Germany catholicism and protestantism are so mixed, that it is scarcely possible to assign them definite limits, or&nbsp;approximate to their relative numbers. Protestantism,&nbsp;however, prevails mostly in the northern and south-western&nbsp;parts of the country; popery in the south-east, south, and&nbsp;west. Their numbers are not far from being equal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the Austrian empire popery is the dominant religion, and professed by the great majority of the inhabitants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In Prussia protestantism is the government religion ; but the professors of all religions enjoy freedom of worship, and&nbsp;almost equal rights. Lutheranism is professed by the great&nbsp;majority in East Prussia, Brandenburg, Pomerania, and&nbsp;Saxony; popery in the Westphalian and Rhenish provinces,&nbsp;and the grand-duchy of Posen. Silesiaand West Prussia are&nbsp;almost equally divided.</span></p>
