<p><label>ROPE-WALKING</label>
the art of walking, dancing and performing tricks of equilibrium on a rope or wire stretched between two supports. It has been popular with most Asiatic and European peoples from the beginning of history. Before the middle of the 19th century a rope was invariably used, and was stretched as tightly as possible, on which account the art was called <hi rend="italic">Tight-rope Walking.</hi> About the year 1875 the <hi rend="italic">slack wire,</hi> stretched loosely from support to support, was introduced, and is now more commonly used. The performer is often aided in keeping his balance by a Chinese umbrella or a long pole.</p>
