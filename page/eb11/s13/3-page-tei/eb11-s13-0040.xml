J. B. Plant in (1625-1697), of Vaud, wrote his topography of Switzerland, <hi rend="italic">Helvetia antiqua et nova</hi> (1656), in Latin, but his <hi rend="italic">Abrégé de l'histoire générale de la Suisse</hi> (1666) in French, while Georges de Montmollin (1628- 1703) of Neuchâtel wrote, besides various works as to local history, <hi rend="italic">Mémoires</hi> of his times which have a certain historical value.</p><p>But the 17th century in the Suisse Romande pales before the glories of the 18th century, which forms its golden age, and was in a large degree due to the influence of French refugees who, with their families, flocked thither after the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes (1685) and settled down there for the rest of their lives. Such was Louis Bourguet (1678-1743), who, besides his geological works, founded two periodicals which in different ways did much to stimulate the intellectual life of the Suisse Romande; these were the <hi rend="italic">Bibliothèque italique</hi> (1729-1734), which aimed at making more widely known the results of ltalian research, and the Mercarr <hi rend="italic">suisse</hi> which, first issued in 1732, lasted till, 1784, under different names (from 1738 onwards the literary section bore the name of <hi rend="italic">Journal helvétique),</hi> and secured contributions from most of the lead- ing writers of the Suisse Romande of the day, such as Firmin Abauzit. (1679-1767), Abraham Ruchat (1678-1750), and others. Ruchat is now best remembered as the author (under the pen-name of Gottlieb Kypseler) of an excellent guide-book to Switzerland, the <hi rend="italic">Délices de la Suisse,</hi> which first appeared in 1714 and passed through many editions, the latest being issued in 1778; but his <hi rend="italic">Histoire de la Reformation de la Suisse (1727-1728)</hi> was much esteemed in his day. Another Vaudois historian and antiquary was Charles Guillaume Loys de Bochat (1695-1754) whose <hi rend="italic">Mémoires critiques sur divers points de l'ancienne histoire de la Suisse</hi> (1747- 1749) still form a treasure-house for archaeologists. Yet a third Lausanne man was J. P. de Crousaz (1663-1750; <hi rend="italic">q.υ.),</hi> who intro- duced there the philosophy of Descartes, and was, by his books, the master of Gibbon in logic. A French refugee at Lausanne, Jean Barbeyrac ( 1674-1744), published in 1712 the <hi rend="italic">Droit de la nature et des gens,</hi> a translation of Puffendorf’s treatise, with a striking preface of his own. A precursor of Montesquieu and of Rousseau was Jean Jacques Burlamaqui (1694-1750) in his <hi rend="italic">Principes du droit naturel et politique</hi> (1747 and 1751, issued together in 1763), while the celebrated international lawyer, Eméric de Vattel (1714- 1767), was a native of Neuchâtel by birth and descent, and, though he spent most of his life at foreign courts, died at Neuchâtel, not so very long after the publication of his famous <hi rend="italic">Droit des gens</hi> (1758).</p><p>The year 1754 is a great date in the literary history of the Suisse Romande, for in that year Rousseau came back for good to Geneva, and Voltaire, established himself at Ferney, while in 1753 Gibbon had begun his first residence (which lasted till 1758) in Lausanne. The earlier writers mentioned above had then nearly all disappeared, and a more brilliant set took their place. But Rousseau (<hi rend="italic">q.v</hi>.), though a Genevese, belongs rather to European than to Swiss literature, as do later Jacques Necker (<hi rend="italic">q.v</hi>.) and his daughter, Madame de Staël (<hi rend="italic">q.v.</hi>), Benjamin Constant <hi rend="italic">(q.υ.)</hi> and Sismondi (<hi rend="italic">q</hi>.<hi rend="italic">v</hi>.). Madame de Chamère (1740-1805) was Dutch by birth, but married to a native of Neuchâtel. Among her earlier works were two novels. <hi rend="italic">Le Mari sentimental</hi> (1783), and the <hi rend="italic">Lettres de Mistress Henley </hi>(1784), both of which had a great vogue in their day and paint, from her own experience, the sad results of an unsuitable marriage. More celebrated by reason of the liveliness and acuteness with which the manners of a little provincial town are described are her <hi rend="italic">Lettres de Lausanne</hi> (1871), and her <hi rend="italic">Lettres neuchâteloises</hi> (1784), particularly the second part of a story of the former, entitled <hi rend="italic">Caliste,</hi> and published in 1788, for, according to Sainte-Beuve, it was a sort of foreshadowing of the more famous <hi rend="italic">Corinne</hi> (1807) of Madame de Staël. P. H. Mallet (<hi rend="italic">q</hi>.<hi rend="italic">v</hi>.), a Genevese, who held a chair at Copenhagen, devoted himself to making known to the educated world the history and antiquities of Scandinavia. But more characteristic of Geneva were the efforts of a group of <hi rend="italic">men</hi> to spread the cause of natural science by personal investigations in the higher Alps, then but little known. Possibly their interest in such matters had been stimulated by the scientific and psychological speculations of Charles Bonnet (q.v.). The chief of this school was H. B. de Saussure <hi rend="italic">(q.υ.)</hi> one of the founders of geology and meteorology, while his Alpine ascents (undertaken in the cause of science) opened a new world even to non-scientific travellers. The brothers De Luc (q.ν.) devoted themselves mainly to questions of physics in the Alps, while Senebier <hi rend="italic">(q.v.),</hi> the biographer of Saussure, was more known as a physiologist than as a physicist, though he wrote on many branches of natural science, which in those days was not yet highly specialized. On the other hand Marc Théodore Bourrit (q.ν.), the contemporary of these three men, was rather a curious and inquisitive traveller than a scientific investigator, and charms us even now by his genial simplicity as contrasted with the austerity and gravity of the three writers we have mentioned. Philippe Cyriaque Bridel (1757-1845), best known as the “doyen Bridel,” was the earliest of the Vaudois poets by virtue of his <hi rend="italic">Poésies helvé- tiennes</hi> (1782). But he is better known as the painter of the scenery and people among whom he worked as pastor at Basd, at Château d’Oex, and at Montreux successively. His <hi rend="italic">Course de Bâle à Bienne par les vallées du Jura</hi> appeared in 1802, while descriptions of his travels, as well as of the manners of the natives, local history, and in short everything that could stimulate national sentiment, were issued in a senes of periodicals from 1783 to 1831 under the successive titles of <hi rend="italic">Étrennes helvetiennes</hi> and of <hi rend="italic">Conservateur suisse.</hi> His patriotic aim met with great success, while his impressions of his mountain wanderings are fresh and unspoilt by any straining after effect. He was the first writer of the Suisse Romande to undertake such wanderings, so that, with obvious differences, he may be re- garded not merely as the forerunner, but as the inspirer and model of later Vaudois travellers and climbers in the Alps, such as Rodolphe Töpffer <hi rend="italic">(q.v),</hi> of E. Rambert <hi rend="italic">(q.v.),</hi> and of the last-named’s most brilliant pupil, Émile Javelle (1844-1883), whose articles were collected in 1886 by the pious care of his friends under the title of <hi rend="italic">Souvenirs d'un alpiniste.</hi> As a poet. Juste Olivier (<hi rend="italic">q</hi>.<hi rend="italic">v</hi>.) surpassed Bridel. Nor can we wonder that with the advance of knowledge Bridel's history is found to be more picturesque than scientific. Two Vaudois, Charles Monπard (1790-1865) and Louis Vulliemin (1797-1879) carried out their great scheme of translating (1837- 1840) J. von Muller’s Swiss history with its continuation by Hottin- ger, and then completed it (1841-1851) down to 1815. This gigantic task did not, however, hinder the two friends from making many solid contributions to Swiss historical learning. Later in date were Alexandre Daguet (1816-1894) who wrote an excellent history of Switzerland, while Jean Joseph Hisely (1800-1866), Albert Rilliet (1809-1883), and Pierre Vaucher (1833-1898), all devoted much labour to studying the many problems offered by the early authentic history (from 1291 onwards) of the Swiss Confederation. A different type of history is the work of an honest but partisan writer, the Genevese Jules Henri Merle d’Aubigné (1794-1872), entitled <hi rend="italic">Histoire de la reformation au temps de Calvin</hi> (1835-1878). The Vaudois noble Frédéric Gingins-la-Sarra (1790-1863) represents yet another type of historian, devoting himself mainly to the medieval history of Vaud, but occasionally going beyond the number- less authentic documents brought to light by him, and trying to make them prove more than they can fairly be expected to tell us. Jean Antoine Petit-Senn (1792-1870) was a thorough Genevese and a biting satirist, a pensive poet, the “ Genevese La. Bruyère,” as he liked to be called, but was not fully appreciated till after his death, when his widely scattered writings were brought together. Alexandre Vinet. (q.v.), the theologian, and H. F. Amiel <hi rend="italic">(q.v.), </hi>the philosopher, in a fashion balance each other, and need only be mentioned here. Jean Jacques, Porchat (1800-1864) was one of the most prominent among the minor poets of the region, very French owing to his long residence in Paris, and best remembered probably by his fables, first published in 1837 under the title of <hi rend="italic">Glanures d'Esope</hi> (reissued in 1854 as <hi rend="italic">Fables et paraboles),</hi> though in his day his stories for the young were much appreciated. Urbain Olivier (181o-1888), a younger brother of the poet, wrote many tales of rural life in Vaud, while the Genevese novelist Victor Cherbuliez (1829-1899, <hi rend="italic">q.v.)</hi> was perhaps the most brilliant of a brilliant family. Fribourg has produced the local novelist Pierre Sciobéret (1830-1876) and the Bohemian poet Étienne Eggis (1830-1867), and Neuchâtel Auguste Bachelin (1830-1890) whose best novel was <hi rend="italic">Jean Louis,</hi> a tale of which the scene is laid in the old-fashioned little village of St Blaise. Another Neuchâtel writer, Alice de Chambrier, the poetess, died young, as did the Genevese poet Louis Duchosal, both showing in their short lives more promise than performance. Madame de Gasparin’s (1813— 1894) best tale is <hi rend="italic">Horizons prochains</hi> (1857), a very vivid story of rural life in the Vaudois Jura, remarkable for the virile imagination of its descriptions.</p><p>Edouard Rod (q.v.) the novelist, and Marc Monnier <hi rend="italic">(q.υ.),</hi> critic, poet, dramatist and novelist, are the most prominent figures in the recent literature of the Suisse Romande. Amongst lesser stars we may mention in the department of belles-lettres (novelists, poets or critics) Charles Du Bois-Melly, “T. Combe (the pen name of Mlle Adèle Huguenin), Samuel Cornut, Louis Favre, Philippe Godet, Oscar Huguenin, Philippe Monnier, Noëlle Roger, Virgile Rossel, Paul Seippel and Gaspard Vallette. The chief literary organ of the Suisse Romande is the <hi rend="italic">Bibliothèque universelle,</hi> which in 1816 took that title in lieu of <hi rend="italic">Bibliothèque britannique </hi>(founded in 1796), and in 1861 added that of <hi rend="italic">Revue suisse,</hi> which it then absorbed. Amongst historians the first place is due to one of the most learned men whom Switzerland has ever produced, and whose services to the history of the Valais were very great, and abbé Jean premaud (1823-1897) of Fribourg. The principal contemporary historians are Victor van Berchcm, Francis De Crue, Camille Favre, Henri Fazy, B. de Mandrot, Berthold van Muyden and Édouard Rott.</p><p><hi rend="italic">c.	Italian Branch.—</hi>Italian Switzerland is best known by its artists, while its literature is naturally subject to strong Italian influences, and not to any of a strictly Swiss nature, Stefano Franscini (1796-1857) did much for his native land, especially in educational matters, while his chief published work (1835) was one that gave a general account of the canton. But, this is not so thorough and good as a later book by Luigi Lavizzari (1814-1875), entitled <hi rend="italic">Escursioni nel cantone Ticino</hi> (1863), which is very complete from all points of view.
