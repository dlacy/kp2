<p><label>RABBA</label>
a town of British West Africa, in the province of Nupe, Northern Nigeria, on the left bank of the Niger, in 9° <hi rend="italic">6'</hi> N., and 200 m. above the confluence of the Niger and the Benue. At the time of Richard Lander’s visit in 1830 it was a place of 40,000 inhabitants and one of the most important markets in the country. In 1867 Gerhard Rohlfs found it with only 500 inhabitants. The town has somewhat recovered its position since the establishment of British rule in 1902.</p>
