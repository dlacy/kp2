an island in the Grecian archipelago, classed among the Cyclades, anciently called Syros. The south-west point of the island is north-east from Serpho-Poulo about five leagues, and the summit of its high land, which is towards the east, is in longitude 24° 55' 13" east, and latitude 37° 28' 56" north. It is three leagues long from north to south, and about one league and a half in breadth. It is mountainous and destitute of wood ; but being well watered and well cultivated, produces barley, wine, figs, cotton, olives, and a small portion of wheat. There is a good harbour on the eastern side, very secure for vessels of an easy draught, and where two or three frigates might find shelter. The land has a very picturesque appearance from this harbour, near to which is the town, reaching half way down the side of a conical hill. The whole inhabitants are calculated to be about 2000, mostly adhering to the Roman Catholic church.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
