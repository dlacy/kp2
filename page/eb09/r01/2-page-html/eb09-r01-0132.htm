<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">C16menges deplores in the strongest terms the state of the church in his day,—a condition of appalling degeneracy,&nbsp;which he ascribes mainly to the increase in wealth and&nbsp;luxury that had followed upon the development of a&nbsp;worldly spirit in its midst. His strictures leave no order&nbsp;or degree of either the ecclesiastical or the monastic life&nbsp;untouched,—the overwhelming ostentation of the Curia;&nbsp;the pride and rapacity of the cardinals, their immorality&nbsp;and addiction to simony ; the prevalence of the same vices&nbsp;among the episcopal order, filled with beardless youths,&nbsp;who, scarcely liberated from the dread of the schoolmaster’s ferule, hastened to assume the pastoral office;&nbsp;the lower clergy in general so sunk in vice and sloth that&nbsp;scarcely one in a thousand (“ vix inter mille unus ”) was to&nbsp;be found living a godly and sober life; the nunneries, which&nbsp;he declares were brothels rather than sanctuaries (“ non dico&nbsp;Dei sanctuaria, sed Veneris execranda prostibula ”). We&nbsp;can feel no surprise at finding that in the 16th century&nbsp;Clement VII. thought it necessary to place this burning&nbsp;diatribe by a great doctor of the church in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Index Ex-</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">purgatorius.</span><span class="font1"> </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">A few years later we find the evils to which&nbsp;Clemenges called attention emphasized by one of the most&nbsp;eminent ecclesiastics of the age, — the cardinal Julian&nbsp;Cesarini, when he was endeavouring to dissuade Pope&nbsp;Eugenius IV. from his design of dissolving the council of&nbsp;Basel (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Popedom, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">vol. xix. </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">p. 502). </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">In this letter he&nbsp;affirms that so strongly is popular feeling stirred against&nbsp;the clergy by their neglect of their duties and scandalously&nbsp;immoral lives that there is reason to fear that, if some&nbsp;remedy be pot devised, the whole fabric of the Roman&nbsp;Church may be overturned.@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The complete failure of these successive efforts to bring about any comprehensive measure of church reform is a&nbsp;familiar fact in European history. And not only were the&nbsp;evils which it was sought to abolish suffered to continue&nbsp;with but little abatement, but dissent even from the recognized discipline of the church was placed under a ban, and&nbsp;made, in common with dissent from doctrine, an offence&nbsp;punishable with the severest penalties. The mediaeval&nbsp;theory of the Roman hierarchy had indeed been reaffirmed&nbsp;by Eugenius IV. and his successors with a success which&nbsp;seemed almost to preclude the possibility of its ever being&nbsp;again challenged. But the main point here to be noted is&nbsp;that in none of these several efforts in the direction of&nbsp;reform, whether resulting from conciliar or popular action,&nbsp;was the doctrine of the church once called in question.&nbsp;The fate that overtook John Huss and Jerome of Prague&nbsp;appears to have been very generally regarded as a necessary example of just rigour in the suppression of heresy.&nbsp;We find, accordingly, that, when in the following century&nbsp;it was sought to associate the efforts of the reformers in&nbsp;the direction of doctrinal change with the efforts of a party&nbsp;within the church itself in the direction of disciplinary&nbsp;reform, the defenders of the traditional Catholic faith&nbsp;challenged the assumed precedent and altogether denied&nbsp;the parallel. “ It is,” wrote Bossuet in the 17th cen<sup>+</sup>ury,&nbsp;“an obvious illusion; for among all the passages which they&nbsp;adduce there is not one in which those teachers have ever&nbsp;dreamed of changing the belief of the church, of amending&nbsp;its worship, which consisted chiefly in the sacrifice of the&nbsp;mass, or of overthrowing the authority of her prelates and&nbsp;especially that of the pope, all which was the primary&nbsp;design of this new reformation of which Luther was the&nbsp;architect.” @@<sup>2</sup> It is not easy to gainsay the reasonableness&nbsp;of Bossuet’s criticism. It was the fundamental theory of&nbsp;' the Reformation that it involved the setting aside of the&nbsp;development given in mediaeval times to the doctrines and&nbsp;teaching of the early church, and proposed to substitute&nbsp;for these a totally different interpretation, which rejected&nbsp;the successive decisions of councils and popes as arbitrary&nbsp;and erroneous. Such a theory, however, necessarily imposed on the Reformers the task of proving the validity of&nbsp;their own position, by showing that their repudiation of a&nbsp;practice and of precedents which had been accepted for&nbsp;so many centuries was justified by an appeal to yet more&nbsp;ancient and unquestionable authority. If indeed they&nbsp;failed in so doing, they must look forward to sinking in&nbsp;the estimation of Christendom to the level of heretics,&nbsp;and be prepared to stand before posterity in the same&nbsp;category as the Arians, the Albigenses, the Lollards, and&nbsp;the Hussites, and those other sects which, by their unwarranted assertion of the right of private interpretation,&nbsp;had provoked and incurred the formal condemnation of&nbsp;the church. It is not within the scope of this article to&nbsp;attempt to estimate the justice of the theological arguments by which the Reformers sought to vindicate their&nbsp;position; but there is good reason for concluding that the&nbsp;argumentative powers and personal influence of Luther&nbsp;and Calvin would have failed, just as the efforts of preceding reformers had failed, in effecting the desired result,&nbsp;had not the conditions and circumstances of the age been&nbsp;such as to lend new force to the arguments which they&nbsp;urged in favour of a fundamental change in the standpoint&nbsp;of religious faith.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>@@@1</sup> “ Dissolutio cleri Alemanniæ, ex qua laici supra modum irritantur adversus statum ecclesiasticurn . . . inclinatus est arbor ut cadat, nec&nbsp;potest diutius persistere.” See Æn. Sylvius, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Opera</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> (ed. 1551), pp. 66,&nbsp;70.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@@@<sup>2</sup> </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Œuvres</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1865), ii. 303.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The most notable feature in connexion with traditional belief which challenges our attention at the commencement of the 16th century is the manner in which the&nbsp;popedom was becoming less and less in harmony with the&nbsp;spirit of the age, and with those new forces which were&nbsp;now developing in the midst of Teutonism. The intolerance of the church in the repression of heresy had become&nbsp;more pronounced and was pressing with increasing rigour&nbsp;on free thought, when, owing to the influences of the&nbsp;New Learning, that thought was everywhere on the point&nbsp;of seeking to break through the traditional trammels;&nbsp;the corruption of the Curia and of both the regular and the&nbsp;secular clergy, the extension of the temporal power of the&nbsp;pontiffs in Italy, and the extortion of their emissaries in&nbsp;other countries had reached a climax just as, owing to the&nbsp;more independent spirit generated by the consolidation of&nbsp;the nationalities, the ruler and the people in each kingdom&nbsp;or principality were becoming increasingly impatient of&nbsp;the existence of such abuses. A brief consideration of&nbsp;these several features becomes, accordingly, quite indispensable, if we wish rightly to comprehend the forces at&nbsp;work in Europe at the time when the Reformers arose to&nbsp;combine them and give them more definite direction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Not a few, and some very memorable, efforts had been made before the 16th century to bring about a reformation&nbsp;of doctrine, but these had almost invariably been promptly&nbsp;visited with the censure of the church. Long after the&nbsp;“ heresies ” of the 4th century had died away and after the&nbsp;controversies of the turbulent 9th century—such as those&nbsp;on the Eucharist between Paschasius Radbertus and&nbsp;Ratramnus, and on predestination between John Scotus&nbsp;Erigena and Gottschalk—had been silenced by the decisions&nbsp;of the pontiffs, we find movements arising, which, however much they differ in other characteristics, all attest&nbsp;the existence of a widespread desire among large sections&nbsp;of the community to revert to a simpler form of i־eligious&nbsp;belief and practice. The Paulicians (or Manichaeans of&nbsp;the East), the Albigenses (or Manichaeans of the West),&nbsp;the Waldenses, the Cathari, and the Leonists (or Poor&nbsp;Men of Lyons)—sects which made their appearance mainly&nbsp;in the 12th and 13th centuries, and for the most part&nbsp;in Switzerland, Languedoc, and northern France—the</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
