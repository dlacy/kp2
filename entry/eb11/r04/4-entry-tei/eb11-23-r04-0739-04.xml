                <p><label>ROSS, SIR HEW DALRYMPLE</label> (1779-1868), British soldier, entered the
                    Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, in 1793, and passed out into the Royal
                    Artillery two years later. With the Royal Horse Artillery he saw active service
                    during the Irish rebellion of 1798, and after eleven years’ service was promoted
                    captain and appointed to command “ A ” troop R.H.A. (afterwards famous as the
                    “ Chestnut Troop ”). In 1809 the troop landed at Lisbon
                    and at once set out to join Wellington’s army, reaching the front two days after
                    Talavera. Ross’s guns were attached to the Light Division, and, with Craufurd,
                    took part in the actions on the Coa and the battle of Busaco. When Masséna began
                    his famous retreat from the lines of Torres Vedras, Ross’s troop was amongst the
                    foremost in the pursuit; at Redinha and Pombal, at Sabugal and Fuentes d’Onor,
                    the “ Chestnuts ” earned great distinction, and in December 1811 their commander
                    received a brevet-majority for his services. He was present at Ciudad Rodrigo
                    and Badajoz, at the Salamanca forts and the battle of Salamanca, still attached
                    to the Light Division. In the campaign of Vittoria, Ross’s guns were continually
                    with the most advanced troops, and after Vittoria they captured the only piece
                    of artillery that remained to the defeated French. A further brevet-promotion
                    and a good service reward came to Ross for his part in the campaign. At Vera in
                    the Pyrenees Ross’s troop was one of the three which played a decisive part in
                    the action, and Vera remains a classical example of the action of horse
                    artillery. “ A ” troop was engaged at St Pierre and Orthez,
                    and at the conclusion of peace returned to England. It was engaged at Waterloo,
                    and though half its guns were disabled the remainder</p>

               <p>took part in the pursuit of the French. Ross received, besides the Peninsular
                    and Waterloo medals, the K.C.B., the Portuguese order of the Tower and Sword and
                    the Russian St Anne. He had commanded the troop for nineteen years when he at
                    last received a regimental lieutenant-colonelcy. As officer commanding Royal
                    Artillery in the Northern District, with delegated command over all the forces
                    of the four northern counties, Sir Hew Ross had for nearly sixteen years to deal
                    with continually threatened civil disorder, and bore himself as well as on the
                    field of battle. From 1840 to 1858, when he retired, he practically directed, in
                    one post or another, all the artillery services of the British army, and when in
                    1854 the test of war came, the artillery took the field in a far better
                    condition than the rest of Lord Raglan’s army. Much of the present efficiency of
                    the “ Royal Regiment ” is directly traceable to the influence of Sir Hew Ross,
                    to whom it owes the institution of the School of Gunnery at Shoeburyness and the
                    establishment of the Royal Artillery Institution at Woolwich. Major-general in
                    1841 and lieut.-general in 1851, he became general in 1854, and died, a
                    field-marshal and G.C.B., in 1868.</p>
