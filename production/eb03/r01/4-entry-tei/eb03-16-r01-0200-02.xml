(Jan de), an eminent hiſtory and portrait painter, born at Dunkirk in 1610. He had the good fortune to be a diſciple of Vandyke, was the ſirſt performer, in his ſohool, and was ſo attached to his mailer that he followed him to London, where it is thought he continued as long as he lived. In fheſe ^kingdoms he is moſtly known by the name of <hi rend="italic">Lang Jan.</hi> He died in 1678 : and it is imagined that the ſcarcity of his works is occaſioned by ſo many of them being imputed to Vandyke ; a circumſtance which, .if true, is beyond any tiling that could be ſaid in his •praiſe.</p>
