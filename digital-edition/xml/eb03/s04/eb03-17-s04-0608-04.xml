 in botany; a genus of plants belonging to the claſs of <hi rend="italic">icoſandria,</hi> and to the order of <hi rend="italic">trigynia.</hi> The calyx is quinqueſid ; the petals are five ; the berry is below the flower, ſoft and containing three ſeeds. There are three ſpecies ; the aucuparia, domeſtica, and hebrida.</p><p>1. The <hi rend="italic">aucuparia,</hi> mountain-aſh, quicken-tree, quick- beam, or roan-tree, riſes with a ſtraight upright ſtem and regular branching head, twenty or thirty feet high or more, covered with a ſmooth greyiſh brown bark; pinnated leaves of eight or ten pair of long, narrow, ſerrated folioles, and an odd one, ſmooth on both ſides ; and large umbellate cluſters of white flowers at the ſides</p><p>and ends of the branches, ſucceeded by cluſters of fine red berries, ripe in autumn and winter. There is a variety with yellow ſtriped leaves. This ſpecies grows wild in many parts of this iſland in mountainous places, woods, and hedge-rows, often growing to the ſize of timber; and is admitted into moſt ornamental plantations, for the beauty of its growth, foliage, flowers, and fruit ; the latter, in particular, being produced in numerous red large bunches all over the tree, exhibit a fine appearance in autumn and winter, till devoured by the birds, eſpecially the blackbird and thruſh, which are ſo allured by this fruit as to flock from all parts and feed on it voraciouſly.—In the iſland of Jura the juice of the berries is employed as an acid for punch. It is probable that this tree was in high eſteem with the Druids; for it is more abundant than any other tree in the neighbourhood of thoſe Druidical circles of ſtones, ſo common in North Britain. It is ſtill believed by ſome perſons, that a branch of this tree can defend them from enchantment or witchcraft. Even the cattle are ſuppoſed to be preſerved by it from danger. The dairy-maid drives them to the ſummer paſtures with a rod of the roan-tree, and drives them home again with the ſame. In Strathſpey, we are told, a hoop is made of the wood of this tree on the 1st of May, and all the ſheep and lambs are made to paſs through it.</p><p>2. The <hi rend="italic">domestica,</hi> or cultivated ſervice-tree, with eatable fruit, grows with an upright ſtem, branching 30 or 40 feet high or more, having a browniſh bark, and the young ſhoots in ſummer covered with a mealy down ; pinnated leaves of eight or ten pair of broadiſh deeply ſerrated lobes and an odd one, downy underneath, and large umbellate cluſters of white flowers at the ſides and ends of the branches, ſucceeded by bunches of large, fleſhy, edible red fruit, of various ſhapes and ſizes. This tree is a native of the ſouthern warm parts of Europe, where its fruit is uſed at table as a deſert, and it is cultivated here in many of our gardens, both as a fruit-tree and as an ornament to diverſify hardy plantations.</p><p>3. The <hi rend="italic">hebrida,</hi> or mongrel ſervice tree oſ Gothland, grows twenty or thirty feet high ; it has half-pinnated leaves, very downy underneath ; and cluſters of white flowers, ſucceeded by bunches of round reddiſh berries in autumn.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
