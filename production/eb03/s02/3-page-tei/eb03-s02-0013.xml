            <p>Kerr, a man of ſome conſequence. Two of the chiefs of the Scotch borderers were
                Cockburn of Kenderlaw, and Adam Scot, commonly called <hi rend="italic">king oſ the
                    thieves. </hi>Both of them were barons; and had been ſo inured to the practice,
                that they thought there was no crime in robbing: they therefore appeared publicly in
                Edinburgh; where James ordered them to be apprehended, tried, and hanged. He next
                proceeded with great firmneſs againſt many noblemen and principal gentlemen, who
                were only ſuſpected oſ being diſaffected to the late peace. All of them had behaved
                with great loyalty, and ſome of them had done him the moſt important ſervices. Of
                this number were the earl of Hume, the lord Maxwell, with the barons of Buccleugh,
                Farniherſt, Polwart, Johnſton, and Mark Kerr. Though we know nothing particularly of
                what was laid to the charge of thoſe noblemen and gentlemen, yet ſo zealous was
                James for the impartial adminiſtration of juſtice, that he ordered them all, with
                many other chief gentlemen of the borders, to be ſent to priſon; where they lay till
                they entered into recognizances themſelves, and found bail for their good
                behaviour.</p>
            <p>Of all the party of the Douglaſſes, none of any note excepting Alexander Drummond of
                Carnock was ſuffered to return home, at the earneſt requeſt of the ambaſſadors and
                the treaſurer Barton. This lenity was of very little conſequence; for James having
                appointed the earl oſ Murray to be ſole warden of the Scotch marches, with power to
                treat with the earl of Northumberland, their conferences had broken off on account
                of freſh violences happening every day; and ſome information he had received from
                them, had prevailed with James to impriſon the noblemen and gentlemen we have
                already mentioned. He now reſolved to attempt in perſen what his predeceſſors and he
                had ſo often failed in by their deputies. As he was known to be violently addicted
                to hunting, he ſummoned his nobility, even on the north oſ the Forth, to attend him
                with their horſes and dogs; which they did in ſuch numbers, that his hunting retinue
                conſiſted of above 8000 perſons, two-thirds of whom were well armed. This
                preparation gave no ſuſpicion to the borderers, as great hunting-matches in thoſe
                days commonly conſiſted of ſome thouſands; and James having ſet out upon his
                diverſion, is ſaid to have killed 540 deer. Among the other gentlemen who had been
                ſummoned to attend him, was John Armſtrong of Gilnockhall. He was the head of a
                numerous clan, who lived with great pomp and ſplendour upon the contributions under
                which they laid the Engliſh on the borders. He was himſelf always attended by
                twenty- ſix gentlemen on norſeback, well mounted and armed, as his body-guards.
                Having received the king’s invitation, he was fond of diſplaying his magnificence to
                his ſovereign; and attiring himſelf and his guard more pompouſly than uſual, they
                preſented themſelves before James, from whom they expected ſome particular mark of
                diſtinction for their ſervices againſt the Engliſh, and for the remarkable
                protection they had always given to their countrymen the Scots. On their firſt
                appearance, James, not knowing who he was, returned Armſtrong’s ſalute, imagining
                him to be ſome great no</p>
            <p>bleman; but upon hearing his name, he ordered him and his followers to be immediately
                apprehended, and ſentenced them to be hanged upon the ſpot. It is ſaid that James,
                turning to his attendants, aſked them, pointing at Armſtrong, "What does that knave
                want that a king ſhould have, but a crown and a ſword oſ honour?” Armſtrong begged
                hard for his life; and offered to ſerve the king in the field with forty horſemen,
                beſides making him large preſents of jewels and money, with many other tempting
                offers. Finding the king inexorable, “Fool that I am (ſaid he) to look for warm
                water under ice, by aſking grace of a graceleſs face and then he and his followers
                ſubmitted to their fate. Thoſe and ſome other executions of the ſame kind reſtored
                peace to the borders.</p>
            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Hitherto</hi> we have conſidered only the civil tranſactions of
                Scotland; but henceforth religion will claim a conſiderable ſhare of the hiſtorian’s
                attention. The opinions of Luther had been propagated in. Britain ſoon after his
                preaching in 1517. They had for ſome years inſenlibly gained ground; and, at the
                time the contentions began between James and his nobility, were become formidable to
                the eſtabliſhed religion. We have ſeen how James eſcaped from the hands of his
                nobles by means of the archbiſhop of St. Andrew’s. To the clergy, therefore, he was
                naturally favourable; and as they of neceſſity oppoſed the reformation, James became
                a zealous perſecutor of the reformed. On the other hand, the nobility having already
                oppoſed the king and clergy in civil affairs, did ſo likewiſe in thoſe of religion.
                The clergy finding themſelves unequal in argument, had recourſe to more violent
                methods. Rigorous inquiſitions were made after heretics, and fires were everywhere
                prepared for them.</p>
            <p>The firſt perſon who was called upon to ſuffer for the reformed religion was Patrick
                Hamilton, abbot of Ferne. At an early period of life he had been appointed to this
                abbacy; and having imbibed a favourable idea of the doctrines of Luther, he had
                travelled into Germany, where, becoming acquainted with the moſt eminent reformers,
                he was fully confirmed in their opinions. Upon his return to Scotland, he ventured
                to expoſe the corruptions of the church, and to inſiſt oa tire advantages of the
                tenets which he had embraced. A conduct ſo bold, and the avidity with which his
                diſcourſes were received by the people, gave an alarm to tha clergy. Under the
                pretence of a religious and friendly conference, he was ſeduced to St Andrew’s by
                Alexander Campbell, a dominican friar, who was inſtructed to remonſtrate with him on
                the ſubject of the reformation. The converſations they held only ſerved to eſtabliſh
                the abbot more firmly in his ſentiments, and to inflame his zeal to propagate them.
                The archbiſhop of St Andrew’s, the archbiſhop of Glaſgow, and other dignitaries of
                the church, conſtituting a court, called him to appear before them.</p>
            <p>The abbot neither loſt his courage nor renounced his opinions. He was convicted
                accordingly of heretical pravity, delivered over to the ſecular arm, and executed in
                the year 1527 @@<hi rend="smallcaps">(n).</hi> This reformer had not attained</p>
            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">@@@ (n)</hi> His tenets were of the following import, and are
                enumerated in the ſentence pronounced againſt him. <pb n="14"></pb>“Man hath no
                free-will. Man is in ſin ſo long as he liveth. Children, incontinent after their
                baptiſme, are ſinners. All Chriſtians, that be worthie to be called Chriſtians, do
                know that they are in grace. No man is juſtified by works, but by faith only. Good
                works make not a good man, but a good man doth make good works. And faith, hope, and
                charity, are ſo knit, that he that hath the one hath the reſt; and he that wanteth
                the one of them wanteth the reft.” <hi rend="italic">Keith, Hist, of the Church and
                    State of Scotland, Appendix,</hi> p. 3.</p>
