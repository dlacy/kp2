<p><span class="font0">short races of from 50 to 75 yds. during the numerous indoor meetings held in winter-time offers excellent training in starting and getting rapidly into full stride.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The best time for the eighth mile (220 yds.), a distance often run in America, is 21 1/5 secs., made in 1896 on a straightaway&nbsp;track by B. J. Wefers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The quarter-mile (440 yds.) is almost always run on a curved track, and hence a quick start is important, for should&nbsp;the runner who has the advantage of the inside position allow&nbsp;himself to be outrun in the distance to the first turn, one of his&nbsp;opponents is likely to cut in and deprive him of it, while on the&nbsp;other hand a runner on the outside must actually outrun the&nbsp;inside man in order to be on even terms after the turn. The&nbsp;element of strategy, unknown in straight sprints, thus enters&nbsp;into the quarter. Speed is, of course, the chief requisite for a&nbsp;quarter-miler, but a certain amount of staying power is also&nbsp;necessary. The standard time for the quarter is 50 secs.,&nbsp;which means an average speed of 11.3 secs. for each 100 yds.&nbsp;round the course. That of M.W. Long of Columbia University,&nbsp;who made the record, 47 secs., in 1900, was on that occasion&nbsp;10.68 secs. for each hundred yards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The system of “ relay races,” usually run by four men each going a quarter of the distance, is a popular variety. The&nbsp;favourite distance is a mile, each man running a quarter at top&nbsp;speed. This method of racing was introduced in the United&nbsp;States about the year 1890 on the model of the Massachusetts&nbsp;firemen’s &quot;bean-pot” races, and has since become very popular&nbsp;there. The old method was for the men running the second&nbsp;quarter of the course to wait on the mark for the first relay&nbsp;men to arrive, and then, snatching small flags from their hands,&nbsp;to continue the race, handing over the flags to the third relay&nbsp;upon completing their quarter. The flags, being cumbersome,&nbsp;were afterwards abandoned, and the new runners are now&nbsp;required only to touch the persons of the preceding contestants.&nbsp;The I m. record, 3 min. 21 2/5 secs., was made in 1898 by&nbsp;B. J. Wefers, M. W. Long, T. E. Burke and H. S. Lyons of the&nbsp;New York Athletic Club.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Middle-Distance Running.—</span><span class="font0">The chief middle distances are 600 yds., 660 yds., 880 yds. (half-mile) and 1000 yds., but of&nbsp;these the half-mile is the only one commonly recognized in&nbsp;championship sports. Endurance is more important at these&nbsp;distances, though speed is essential, and the element of strategy&nbsp;increases. An element unknown to sprinting enters into middle-and long-distance runs, namely that of pace-making; even&nbsp;when the real race is between two individuals at least one other&nbsp;runner on each side takes part in the contest, in order to “ make&nbsp;the pace ” for his principal. Emilio Lunghi (U.S.A.) holds&nbsp;the half-mile world’s record of 1 min. 52 4/5 secs., made in 1909.&nbsp;J. F. K. Cross of Oxford University ran the half-mile at Oxford&nbsp;in 1888 in 1 min. 54 2/5 secs. The record for 1000 yds., 2 min.&nbsp;13 secs., was made by L. E. Myers (U.S.A.). The distance of&nbsp;three-quarters of a mile is seldom run now at large meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Long-Distance Running.—</span><span class="font0">This includes all flat races of 1 m. or more, as well as steeplechasing, hare-and-hounds, and other&nbsp;forms of cross-country running. Great Britain has always been&nbsp;the home of long-distance running, different forms of crosscountry racing having been popular all over the kingdom for&nbsp;centuries. In England at the championship meeting the&nbsp;distance events on the flat are the 1 m., 4 m. and 10 m.&nbsp;races, and in the inter-university sports the r m. and&nbsp;3 m. ; in America the distances are 1 m., 2 m. and 5 m.;&nbsp;but any and all of these distances are often included&nbsp;in important British and American programmes. Hard&nbsp;daily training is necessary for a distance runner. Good pacemaking and strategy in general are of great importance. The&nbsp;runner must learn to “ run to the watch,” </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font0"> to cover the&nbsp;different portions of the distance in a certain time, in order to&nbsp;be placed most advantageously for the finish. The mile race&nbsp;requires speed as well as stamina. Most champion milers are&nbsp;capable of doing the half under 2 min. The record for&nbsp;the mile, made in 1886 at Lillie Bridge by W. G. George, as a&nbsp;professional, is 4 min., 12 3/4 secs.; the amateur record is 4 min.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">secs., made by T. P. Conneff in America, J. Binks, holding the British amateur record with 4 min. 16 4/5 secs., made at&nbsp;Stamford Bridge in 1902. The longer-distance races require&nbsp;more stamina than speed, and a careful husbanding of strength.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">In addition to the records for the above-mentioned distances, Shrubb held in 1908 the records for 6, 7, 8, 9 and Iim., and also for&nbsp;the greatest distance covered in 1 h., namely, 11 m. 1316 yds.&nbsp;Hc won the 4 m. and the 10 m. British championship 1901-4 inclusive,&nbsp;and the </span><span class="font1">I </span><span class="font0">m. championship 1903. and 1904; also the French 1 m.&nbsp;and 3 m. championship 1902-4 inclusive. Shrubb was moreover&nbsp;a first-rate cross-country runner also; he won the British 10 m.&nbsp;cross-country championship 1901-4 inclusive, and the international&nbsp;8 m. cross-country championship 1902-4. In 1863 a full-blooded&nbsp;Seneca Indian, L. Bennet, known as “Deerfoot,&quot; ran 12 m. in&nbsp;1 h. 2 m. 2 1/2 secs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Real </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">cross-country running</span><span class="font0"> is a fast jog over hill and dale. It may take the form of a race from the gymnasium or clubhouse across the fields to a given spot and back again, passing&nbsp;certain objects or buildings; of a practice run behind the coach&nbsp;preparatory to a long-distance race on the track ; or of a paper-chase, or hare-and-hounds, the “ hares,” two or three in number,&nbsp;starting a few minutes before the “ hounds,” and leaving a trail&nbsp;of scraps of paper dropped from bags, which must be followed&nbsp;by the “ hounds.” In Great Britain the standard distance is&nbsp;10 m., but in America it is somewhat less, the distance for&nbsp;the intercollegiate championship race being 6J m.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;·</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Steeplechasing vivas</span><span class="font0"> originally only a cross-country run over a course plentifully provided with natural obstacles, such as&nbsp;brooks, ditches, fences and hedges; but at the present day the&nbsp;steeplechase takes place in the inner enclosure of an athletic&nbsp;field and the obstacles are artificial. They are placed about&nbsp;70 or 80 yds. apart, and consist of hurdles, a stone wall about&nbsp;3 ft. high and 2 or 3 ft. broad, and a water-jump, a ditch about&nbsp;6 ft. broad filled with water and guarded by a wall or fence&nbsp;covered with thick furze or other thick shrubbery. Steeplechase courses differ widely, but the usual distance both in&nbsp;Great Britain and America is 2 m. The time necessary to&nbsp;cover this distance varies according to the difficulties of the&nbsp;course, but a few seconds under 11 min. is considered very&nbsp;fast time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Team-racing</span><span class="font0"> is a favourite form of distance running, each team consisting of 10 men and the distance usually 4 m., the standard&nbsp;of the modern Olympic Games. Different systems of scoring are&nbsp;in vogue, but the usual one allows the winner ten points, the second&nbsp;to arrive, nine, and so on, the tenth arrival scoring one. The team&nbsp;aggregating the highest number of points wins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Among modern distance events the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Marathon Run</span><span class="font0"> of about 40 kilometres (2a m. 1500 yds.) is the most important. It&nbsp;was introduced in the first revived Olympic Games at Athens in 1896&nbsp;(see Athletic Sports) in memory of the famous Greek runner who&nbsp;was said to have brought the news of the battle of Marathon in&nbsp;Athens, dropping dead when his task was finished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RUODLIEB, a romance in Latin verse by an unknown German poet who flourished about 1030; he was almost certainly a&nbsp;monk of the Bavarian abbey of Tegernsee. The poem is one&nbsp;of the earh'est German romances of knightly adventure, and&nbsp;its vivid picture of feudal manners gives it a certain value as an&nbsp;historical document. The poet was probably an eye-witness&nbsp;of the episode (11. 4231-5221) which represents the meeting of&nbsp;the emperor Henry II. with Robert of France on the banks</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
