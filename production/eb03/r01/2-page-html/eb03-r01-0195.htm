<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Iiſhed, the </span><span class="font1">Châtelet, being the Γecond court in that city, was retained for the purpoſe of trying thoſe per-fons who had become moſt obnoxious by their attach-ment to the royal cauſe. This court had the lpirit to&nbsp;acquit the Baron de Bezenval, Marſhal Broglio, and&nbsp;the Prince de Lambeſq. But having incurred much&nbsp;popular odium c∙n this account, they were guilty of the&nbsp;unworthy meanneſs of condemning to death the Marquis de Favres, for a pretended conſpiracy </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(of </span><span class="font1">which&nbsp;no tolerable proof was ever brought) to maffacre La&nbsp;Fayette, Bailly, and Neckar, and to convey the King&nbsp;to Peronne.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">During the whole of this winter the King had been very ſtrictly watched by numerous guards placed around&nbsp;his palace, infomuch that the other nations of Europe&nbsp;conſidered him as in a ſtate of captivity. To do away&nbsp;this impreffion, if poffible, and to make their king appear a voluntary agent in the meaſures that had lately&nbsp;been adopted, was now regarded as a matter of ſome&nbsp;importance. Every effort was therefore made to prevail with him to come to the Affembly ſuddenly, and,&nbsp;as it were, of his own voluntary motion, there to declare his adherence to the meafures which had lately&nbsp;been adopted. For ſome time he refilled this propo-ſal ; but at length, on the 4tl1 of February, he did&nbsp;ſuddenly appear in the National Affembly, where he&nbsp;complained of the attempts that had been made to ſhake&nbsp;the new conſtitution. He declared his wiſh &quot; that it&nbsp;ſhould be univerſally known that the monarch and the&nbsp;reprefentatives of the nation were united, and their&nbsp;wiſhes were the fame ; that he would defend the conſtitutional liberty of the ſtate; that, in conjunction with&nbsp;the Queen, he would early form the ſentiments of his&nbsp;foil fυι that new order of things which the circumſtan-ces of the empire had introduced.” This declaration&nbsp;diſpirited the ariſtocratic party in no ſmall degree, and&nbsp;increaſed that unhappy tendency of looking for aid&nbsp;from foreign countries which they had always been too&nbsp;apt to indulge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Ο11 the 13th of February, monaſtic eſtabhſhments were ſuppreffed, and their lands conſiſcated ; but the&nbsp;preſent friars and nuns were allowed penſtons for their&nbsp;ſubſtſtenee, and to continue the obſervance of their mo-naſtic vows, if they thought fit. we may obſerve here,&nbsp;that, in conſequence of the evacuation of the monaſte-ries, it is probable that about this time the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Breton</span><span class="font1"> committee began to affume the appellation of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(facobiη&nbsp;Club,</span><span class="font1"> from the hall belonging to the Jacobin friars at&nbsp;Paris, in which their meetings were now held.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">An event occurred at this time which tended in no ſmall degree to increafe the odium under which the old&nbsp;government already laboured. This was the publication&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Red Book,</span><span class="font1"> or-lift of penſions and donations granted by the crown. In conſequence of the moſt preffing&nbsp;inftances, it had been communicated by M. Neckar to&nbsp;a committee of the Affembly, after many intreaties,&nbsp;and the moſt ſolemn promiſes of ſecrecy. ft aſtorded,&nbsp;however, too ſtriking an advantage to thc popular party&nbsp;not to be made uſe of, and in a few days M. Neckar,&nbsp;to his no ſmall ſurpriſe, ſaw this regiſter publicly fold&nbsp;by every bookſeller in Paris. He ought not, indeed,&nbsp;to have been ſurpriſed ; and the giving up of this lift is&nbsp;one of the many proofs which the tranſactions of that&nbsp;period afford of his great unfitneſs for the office which&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">he held, with much indignation, however, he de</span><span class="font1">manded why the committee had publiſhed it without&nbsp;the permiſſion of the Affembly or the King ? But he&nbsp;was told by the committee, that &quot; as to the Affembly,&nbsp;they were ſufe of its approbation ; and as to the King,&nbsp;they were not his reprefentatives.” To give an idea of ~ħ&nbsp;the effect of this publication, it is only neceſſiiry to re-P?&nbsp;mark, that, under the ſhort adminiſtration of M. Ca-lonne, thc two brothers of the King had received from&nbsp;the public treaſury, independent of their legitimate in-come, nearly two millions ſteiling, and that L. 600,000&nbsp;had been granted to an individual, becauie he was the&nbsp;liuſhand of Madame de Polignac. M. Neckar’s oppoſition to this publication tended in no ſmall degree to&nbsp;injure his popularity, and the reft of the miniſtry began to lofe the confidence of the public. Indeed, at&nbsp;this time, fertile cauſes of alarm prevailed on all ſides.&nbsp;T&lt;he clergy were attempting to revive in the provinces&nbsp;the ancient animoſities between the Roman Catholics&nbsp;and the Protεftants, aſcribing the late decrees of the&nbsp;Affembly to the latter. The German Princes who poſ-ſtffed property in the north of France were complaining loudly of the violation oſ their rights by the aboli-tiυn of the feudal ſyſtem, although the National Affembly had voted to them a compenſation. The moſt&nbsp;melancholy intelligence was received from their colonies&nbsp;in the well Indies. In regulating theſe, the Affembly&nbsp;had not recognized the right of the free negroes to enjoy the fame privileges with other citizens ; at the&nbsp;fame time, they did not go the length of denying theſe&nbsp;privileges. This uncertain conduct produced infinite&nbsp;calamities. The whites contended with thoſe commonly called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">people oſ colour.</span><span class="font1"> Theſe again ſometimes Hood&nbsp;in oppoſition to the free negroes, or to the ſiaves ; and&nbsp;hence it ſometimes happened that no leſs than three ho-ſtile affemblies were held at the fame time in the fame&nbsp;colony, which made war upon each other with the moſt</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">inveterate fury. Each party found protectors in the National Affembly of the parent ſtate. Thoſe who&nbsp;favoured or oppoſed the exiſtence of diſtinctions at&nbsp;home, in general followed out the fame principle with&nbsp;regard to the colonies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Οη the 14th of May, M. de Montmorency communicated to the National Affembly the preparations for war in which England and Spain were engaged. This&nbsp;brought forward the conſtitutional queſtion, “ who&nbsp;ought to poffeſs the power of declaring peace and war ?&nbsp;The Count Clermont Tonnerre, Meffrs<sup>,</sup>&lt;de Serent, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">VÎ-</span><span class="font1">rieu, and Dupont, ſupported the royal prerogative ;&nbsp;while on the other fide, the excluſive right of the legiſia-tive body to exerciſe this important prerogative was&nbsp;ſupported by Meſtrs d’Aiguillon, Garatjun. Freteau,&nbsp;Jellot, Charles Lameth, Sillery, Pction, Robeſpierre,&nbsp;&amp;c. M. Petion propoſed a decree “ that the French&nbsp;nation renounced for ever all idea of conqueſt, and confined itſelf entirely to defenſive war;” which was paffed&nbsp;with univerſal acclamation. The Count de Mirabeau&nbsp;at length ſucceſsfully propoſed that peace and war ſhould.&nbsp;be declared by the king and the legiſlative body in conjunction ; and the decree that was paffed on the ſubject&nbsp;is a ſtrange farrago of contradictions and abſurdities. It&nbsp;enjoined the King· to &quot; guard the Rate from external&nbsp;attacks.” But how could this be done, without repelling any attack that might be made upon it ? This,&nbsp;however, he could not do, without previouſly informing the National Affembly j ⅛nd if th»t body chanced.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
