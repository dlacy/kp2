Against these confederate nations the Romans were led by consuls of unusual ability ; among whom the skill of Fabius Maximus, and the self-devoting patriotism of Decius, rendered them conspicuous. After many gallant exploits, Decius, imitating the heroic deed ofhis father, devoted himselfto the deities of death for his country’s sake, and purchased victory at the expense of a consul’s life. After numerous vicissitudes of fortune, which we cannot afford space to specify, victory declared for Rome. The Samnites lost their skilful general Pontius, and the Romans, under the command of Curius Dentatus, were enabled to dictate terms to their subdued antagonists.</p><p>The Tarentines, and other states in southern Italy, had aided the Samnites, and were now afraid that Rome would take vengeance on them for their interference. They procured the assistance of the Gauls, in order to avert the war from their own territories. This expedient was crowned wlth but partial and temporary success. The Gauls were finally vanquished by Dentatus and Fabricius ; and preparations were made for waging war against the Tarentines. Alarmed at the near approach of that vengeance which they had thus doubly provoked, the Tarentines applied for aid to the famous Pyrrhus king of Epirus. This brave and skilful, but rash and impolitic warrior, being desirous of emulating Alexander the Great, listened readily to the invitation of the Tarentines, cherishing a secret hope of conquering all Italy, and founding a western empire. He at first sent his favourite and political adviser Cineas to Tarentum, and soon afterwards followed in person, at the head of a large army, bringing with him also several elephants trained to war, the first time that such animals had been seen in Europe.</p><p>The first care of Pyrrhus was to increase his army, by the aid of as many auxiliary forces as he could procure, and to train them to the same discipline as his own. The Tarentines had expected him to bear all the toils and perils of the war, and to allow them to enjoy the pleasures of peaceful and luxurious indulgence. They soon found, however, greatly to their dissatisfaction, that their protector was resolved to be also their master ; but their murmurs he suppressed without the slightest compunction. In the mean time P. Valerius Laevinus, the consul, at the head of a strong army, began to ravage the country of the Lucanians, who were in alliance with the Tarentines. This induced Pyrrhus to march against him, although his Italian allies had not joined him. A battle was fought on the banks of the Siris ; and after an obstinate and bloody struggle, Pyrrhus obtained the victory, chiefly by means of his personal daring, his Thessalian cavalry, and his elephants, the Roman cavalry not being able to withstand the sight of these huge animals. But so desperate was the conflict, and so many of his best troops did Pyrrhus lose, that when his officers congratulated him on the victory, he exclaimed, “ Another sucb victory, and I am undone !”</p><p>Soon after this encounter, Pyrrhus devastated the territories of the countries in alliance with Rome. He laid siege to Capua, surprised Fregellae, and invested Præneste, having advanced even within sight of Rome. Finding however that his march was producing no impression, he avoided an engagement offered him by Laevinus, and returned to Tarentum. What he had now learned of the Romans, convinced him that there was little prospect of an easy conquest over them ; and he was very willing to enter into negotiations for a peace upon equal and honourable terms, his only stipulation being for an amnesty to the Tarentines, the Greek cities in Italy, and those states which had entered into an alliance with him. The senate seemed at first inclined to accept of these conditions ; but they were dissuaded by Appius Claudius, who caused himself to be carried to the senate-house, blind as he was, that he might do his utmost to prevent a peace on any terms, except the immediate and unconditional departure of Pyrrhus from Italy. With this answer Cineas was obliged to depart from Rome, and both parties prepared for the renewal of hostilities. The consuls, P. Sulpicius and P. Decius, marched into Apulia, and were met by Pyrrhus near a little town called Asculum. There another battle was fought, which terminated in favour of the Romans, Pyrrhus finding it expedient to retire to Tarentum, and the Romans being in no condition to pursue, so obstinate had been the struggle, and so exhausted were both armies.</p><p>Pyrrhus, tired of a contest with such invincible foes, readily accepted an invitation from the Syracusans to assist them against the Carthaginians ; and he passed over with a great part of his troops to Sicily. In that island he was at first successful ; but fortune again began to frown upon him, and he was induced to relinquish his hopeless enterprise, and return to the aid of the Tarentines, who were nearly overpowered by the Romans. On his arrival, he recruited his army to the utmost of his power among the Samnites, Lucanians, and Bruttians, and prepared fbr a decisive effort. Nor were the Romans slack in their preparations : they sent the two consuls, Curius Dentatus and Cornelius Lentulus, at the head of two consular armies, the one into Lucania, the other into Samnium. Pyrrhus hastened to encounter Dentatus when separated from his colleague ; and another desperate engagement took place near Beneventum. Pyrrhus bad advanced incautiously in the hope of surprising the consul ; and failing in this attempt, was obliged to risk a battle in a disadvantageous position, and where his phalanx had not proper room for its ponderous evolutions. The superiority of the legion over the phalanx, and of the soldier who fights for his country over the mercenary, were soon apparent. The elephants were scared by torches and driven back on the army of Pyrrhus ; the phalanx was forced into a crowded confusion where it could not act, and from which it could not extricate itself ; and in' spite of the utmost skill and fierce valour of Pyrrhus himself, he sustained a complete rout, and fled with the wreck of his army to Tarentum. Thence he soon afterwards departed for Greece, leaving under the command of Milo, a small garrison in Tarentum, which shortly surrendered to the Romans. The Samnites were defeated with great slaughter, soon after the</p><p>departure of Pyrrhus ; and the Lucanians and Bruttians were also compelled to yield to the Roman arms. At the conclusion of this great war, Rome had established her supremacy over all the countries in Italy, from the northern frontiers of Etruria to the Sicilian straits, and from the Tyrrhenian sea to the Adriatic.</p><p>It cannot be doubted that the Roman arms triumphed in the Samnite, Latin, Etrurian, and Tarentine wars, very greatly in consequence of that cessation of civil dissensions which the Licinian laws had produced, and the corresponding accession of strength thereby gained. Yet even during these wars, there remained one grievance to be removed, and which was removed. The cruelty of a usurer towards one of his debtors, a youth of great personal elegance, excited the indignation of the people to such a degree, that the senate found it necessary to repeal the laws which gave creditors power over the persons of their debtors ; and to enact, that thenceforth no person should be fettered and confined, except after conviction of a crime, and in order to punishment ; and that for money due, the goods of a debtor should alone be answerable, and not his person. This enactment completed the charter of personal liberty to the Roman commons ; but, as will afterwards be seen, it ultimately gave rise to consequences perhaps more fatal to public liberty.</p><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
