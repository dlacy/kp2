In the midſt of this proceſſion is borne a triumphal arch ; and on the top an apple-tree covered with fruit, which ſeveral little boys incloſed in the machine endeavour to gather. The lawyers and laity carry branches of willow; the guards and the fpec∙∙ tutors proſtrate themſelves on the ground while the proceſſion halts ; and after the ceremony, the patriarch preſents a purſe of ιoo rubles to the czar, who perhaps invites him to dine at his table. During the ſeaſon of Eaſter, the whole empire is filled with mirth and rejoicing : which, however, never fails to degenerate into heat and debauchery ; even the ladies may indulge themſelves with ſtrong liquors to intoxication wfithout ſcandal. When a lady ſends to inquire concerning the health of her gueſts whom ſhe entertained over-night, the uſual reply is, “ I thank your miſtreſs for her good cheer : by my troth, I was ſo merry that I don’t remember how I got home.”</p><p>During theſe carnivals, a great number of people, in reeling home drunk, fall down and periſh among the fnow. It is even dangerous to relieve a perſon thus overtaken ; for, ſhould he die, the perſon who endeavoured to aſſiſt him is called before the judge, and generally pays dear for his charity.</p><p>The Muſcovite priel⅛ uſe exorciſms at the adminiſtration of baptiſm. They plunge the child three times ever head and ears in water, and give it the ſacrament of the Lord’s Supper in one ſpecies, until it hath attained the age of ſeven; after which the child is indulged with it in both kinds. They likewiſe adminiſter the ſacrament to dying perſons, together with extreme unction ; and if this be neglected, the body is denied Chriſtian burial. Soon as the perſon expires, the body is depoli-ted in a coffin, with a lunehion of bread, a pair of ſhoes, ſome few pieces of money, and a certificate ſigned by the pariſh-prieſt, and directed to St Nicholas, who is one of their great patrons. They likewiſe hold St Andrew in great veneration, and ridſeulouſly pretend they were converted by him to Chriſtianity. But next to St Nicholas, they adore St Anthony of Padua, who is ſuppoſed to have ſailed upon a mill-ſtone through the Mediterranean and Atlantic, and over the lakes Ladoga and Onega, as far as Novogorod. Every houſe is furniſhed with an image of St Nicholas, carved in the moſt rude and fantaſtic manner ; and when it becomes old and worm-eaten, the owner either throws it into the river with a few pieces of coin, faying, “ Adieu, brother or returns it to the maker, who accommodates him with a new image for a proper conſideration. The good women are very careful in adorning their private St Nicholaſes with rich clothes and jewels ; but on any emergency, theſe are relumed, and the faint left as naked as he came from the hand of the carpenter.</p><p>There are monalteries in Ruſſia ; but neither the monks nor the nuns are ſubject to ſevere reſtrictions. The friare are either horſe-jockeys, or trade in hops, wheat, and other commodities ; the ſiſters are at liberty to go abroad when they pleaſe, and indulge themſelves in all manner of freedoms.</p><p>Heretofore liberty of conſcience was denied, and every convicted heretic was committed to the flames ; but ſince the reign of Peter, all religions and ſects are tolerated throughout the empire. Roman Catholics, Lutherans, Calvim’ſts, Armenians, Jews, and Mahometans, enjoy the free exerciſe of their reſpective forms</p><p>of worſhip ; though it was not without great difficulty, and by dint of extraordinary ſolicitation from different powers, that the Romiſh religion was allowed. Peter knowing the dangerous tenets of a religion that might ſet the ſpiritual power of the pope at variance with the temporal power of the emperor, and being well acquainted with the meddling genius of its profeffors, held out for ſome time againſt the interceſſion of Germany, France, and Poland; and though at length he yielded to their joint interpoſition, he would by no means luffer any Jeſuit to enter his dominions.</p><p>The government of Ruſſia is mere deſpotiſm. The whole empire is ruled by the arbitrary will and plea-ι ſure of the ſovereign, who is ſtyled the <hi rend="italic">evar</hi>  or <hi rend="italic">tvcιr,</hi>  a title which is probably a corruption of Cæfar. Heretofore he was ſtyled <hi rend="italic">grand duke oſ Muſcovy :</hi>  but ſince the reign of Peter, he is dignified with the appellation of <hi rend="italic">emperor oſ Ruſſia ;</hi>  and the preſent ſovereign is ſtyled <hi rend="italic">empreſs oſ all the Ruſias.</hi>  The emperor is abſolute lord, not only of all the eſtates in the empire, but alſo of the lives of his ſubjects; the greateſt noblemen call themſelves his <hi rend="italic">flaves,</hi>  and execute his commands with the moſt implicit obedience. The common people revere him as ſomething ſupernatural ; they never mention his n⅛nc, or any thing immediately belonging to him, without marks of the moſt profound reſpect and awful veneration. A man aſking a carpenter at work upon one of the czar’s warehouſes, what the place was intended ſor ? anſwered, “ None but God and the czar knows.”</p><p>The nobility of Ruſſia were formerly rich and powerful, and ruled deſpoticqjly over their inferiors : but we have ſeen how the father of Peter the Great contrived to ſtrip them of their privileges, and they are now venal dependants on the court. They ſtill retain the titles of their anceſtors, though many of them are in the moſt abject poverty and contempt.</p><p>All the peaſants in the empire are conſidered as immediate ilaves belonging to the czar, to the bσyars, or to the monaſteries. The value of eſtates is computed, not by the extent or quality of the land, but from the number of thoſe peaſants, who may be fold, alienated, or given away, at the pleaſure of their maſters. The number of theſe huſhandmen, whether living in villages or in the open country, being known, the czar, by requiring a certain proportion of each lord or proprietor, can raiſe 3c0,0c0 men in leſs than 40 days.</p><p>The adminiſtration is managed by a grand council, called <hi rend="italic">dumnοy boyaren<hi rend="sub">i</hi></hi>  or “ council of the boyars,” who are the grandees of the empire, and act as privy counſellors. To this are ſubſervient ſix inferior chambers and courts of judicature, provided each with a prelident. The firſt regulates every thing relating to ambaſſadors and foreign negociations ; the ſecond takes cognizance of military affairs ; the third manages the public revenues of the empire ; the bufineſs of the fourth is to encourage, protect, and improve trade and commerce. The two laſt hear and determine in all cauſes, whether civil or criminal.</p><p>Peter divided the empire into the eight governments of Moſcow, Archangel, Afoph, Caſan, Aſtracan, Chioff and the Ukraine, Siberia, Livonia, comprehending Ingria, Pleſcow, and Novogorod, Smolenſko, and Ve-ronitz, The governors or waivodes were veſted with power to diſpoſe of all employments civil and military, and receive the revenues.
