 or the <hi rend="italic">Sugar-Cane,</hi> in botany: A genus of the digynia order, belonging to the triandria claſs of plants; and in the natural method ranking under the 4th order, <hi rend="italic">Grαmina.</hi> There is no calyx, but a long down; the corolla is bivalved. There is but one ſpecies of this genus, viz. the officina. It is a native of Africa, the Eaſt Indies, and of Brazil; from whence it was introduced into our Weft India iſlands ſoon after they were ſettled. The ſugar-cane is the glory and the pride of thoſe iſlands. It amply rewards the induſtrious planter, enriches the Britiſh merchant, gives bread to thouſands of manufacturers and ſeamen, and brings an immenſe revenue to the crown. For the proceſs of making ſugar, ſee <hi rend="smallcaps">Sugar.</hi></p><p>Sugar, formerly a luxury, is now become one of the neceſſaries of life. In crop-time every negro on the plantations, and every animal, even the dogs, grow fat. This ſufficiently points out the nouriſhing and healthy qualities of ſugar. It has been alleged, that the eating of ſugar ſpoils the colour of, and corrupts, the teeth: this, however, proves to be a miſtake, for no people on the earth have finer teeth than the negroes in Jamaica. Dr Alſton, formerly professor of botany and materia medica at Edinburgh, endeavoured to obviate this vulgar opinion: he had a fine ſet of teeth, which he aſcribed ſolely to his eating great quantities of ſugar. Externally too it is often uſeful: mixed with the pulp of roaſted oranges, and applied to putrid or ill-diſpoſed ulcers, it proves a powerful corrector.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
