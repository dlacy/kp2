                    appointed superintended single-handed the administration of justice,&nbsp;alike

                    a single magistrate,&nbsp;and a second praetor was created. The date is
                    generally&nbsp;assumed to have been about the year 242 b.c.; Pomponius&nbsp;says
                    distinctly that the creation of the new office was rendered&nbsp;necessary by
