The present stairs are modern. The two chambers are vividly described by Sallust (C⅛f., 55). The entrance to the upper prison was on the left of the stairs leading up from the Forum to the Clivus Argentarius, the road to the Porta Ratumena (see Plate VL ). Lentulns and the Catiline conspirators, as well as Jugurtha and other prisoners of importance, were killed or starved to death in this fearful dungeon, which is called <hi rend="italic"><hi rend="smallcaps">to </hi></hi><hi rend="italic">βάραθρον</hi>  by Plutarch <hi rend="italic">(Marius,</hi>  xii.). According to a doubtful tradition of the Catholic Church St Peter and St Paul were imprisoned in the Tullianum. The name Mamertine prison is of mediæval origin. The front wall of the prison was restored in the reign of Tiberius 22 A.D., and bears this inscription on a projecting string-course—C. VIBIVS . C . F. RVFINVS . M. COCCEIV[S NERV A] COS. EX. S.

Till the construction of the great cloacæ it was, at least in wet seasons, marshy ground, in which were several pools of water. In early times it was bounded on two sides by rows of shops and houses, dating from the time of the first Tarquin (Liv., i. 35). The shops on the south-west side facing the Sacra Via, where the Basilica Julia afterwards was built, were occupied by the Tabernæ Veteres.@@<hi rend="sup">3</hi> The shops on the northern side, being occupied by silversmiths, were called Tabernæ Argentariæ (see Liv., xxvi. 27, xl. 51), and in later times, when rebuilt after a fire, were called Tabernæ Novæ.@@<hi rend="sup">4</hi> An altar to Saturn (Dionys., i. 34, vi. 1), traditionally set up by the companions of Hercules, and an altar to Vulcan, both at the end towards the Capitol, with the temple of Vesta and the Regia at the opposite end, were among the earliest monuments grouped around the Forum. The Lacus Curtius vanished, as Varro says (Z.Z., v. 148-149), probably with other stagnant pools, when the cloacæ were constructed (Liv., i. 38, 56).@@<hi rend="sup">5</hi> Another pool, the Lacus Servilius, near the Basilica Julia, was preserved in some form or other till the imperial period. Under Sulla it was used as a place to expose the heads of many senators murdered in his proscriptions (Cic.,<hi rend="italic">Rose. Am.,</hi>  32; Seneca, <hi rend="italic">De Prov.,</hi>  3). The Vulcanal or Hephæsteum was an open area, so called from the early altar to Vulcan, and was (like the Comitium) a place of public meeting, at least during the regal period.@@<hi rend="sup">6</hi>  It was raised above the Comitium, and probably was a space levelled on the lower slope of the Capitoline Hill behind the arch of Severus ; but its exact form and position are very doubtful. It was probably much encroached upon when the temple of Concord was enlarged in the reign of Augustus.</p><p>Plate VIL gives a carefully measured plan of the Forum, showing the most recent discoveries.</p><p><hi rend="italic">References to Numbers in Plate (VII.) of Forwn Romanum.<hi rend="sup">7 </hi></hi>1, 1.

The marshy battle-field of the early inhabitants of the capitol and Palatine became, when the ground was drained by the great cloacæ, under a united rule the most convenient site for political meetings, for commercial transactions, and for the pageants of rich men’s funerals, <hi rend="italic">ludi scenici,</hi>  and gladiatorial games.@@<hi rend="sup">8</hi>  For these purposes a central space, though but a small one, was kept clear of buildings ; but it was gradually occupied in a somewhat inconvenient manner by an ever-accumulating crowd of statues and other honorary monuments. On three sides the limits of this open space are marked by paved roads, faced by the stately buildings which gradually took the place of the simple wooden tabernæ and porticus @@<hi rend="sup">9</hi>  of early times. This central space was essentially the meeting-place of the plebs, or the Comitia Tributa, while the patricians, the Comitia Curiata, met on the Comitium, which adjoined the Forum. The Comitium@@<hi rend="sup">10</hi>  was a level space in front of the Curia ; the construction of both is ascribed to Tullus Hostilius. For the position of the Comitium and the Curia@@<hi rend="sup">11</hi>  see plan of Forum (Plate VII.). Varro (Z.7λ,v. 155-156) gives the following account of the buildings which were grouped along the northern angle of the Forum.</p><p>“ Comitium ab eo quod coibant eo comitiis curiatis et Iitium causa. Curiæ duorum generum, nam et ubi curarent sacerdotes res divinas, ut Curiæ Veteres, et ubi senatus humanas, ut Curia Hostilia, quod primum ædificavit Hostilius rex. Ante hanc Rostra, quojus loci id vocabulum, quod ex hostibus capta fixa sunt rostra. Sub dextra hujus a Comitio locus substructus, ubi nationum subsistèrent Iegati qui ad senatum essent missi. Is Græcostasis appel-Iatus a parte ut multa. Senaculum supra Græcostasim, ubi Ædis Concordiæ et Basilica Opimia. Senaculum vocatum, ubi senatus, aut ubi seniores consistèrent.”</p><p>The Curia or senate-house passed through many vicissitudes. At first called Curia Hostilia from its founder Tullus Hostilius (Liv., i. 30), it lasted till 52 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi>  when it was burnt at the funeral of Clodius, and was then rebuilt by the son of Sulla, and from his gens called Curia Cornelia (Dion Cass., xl. 50 ; Plin., <hi rend="italic">H.N.,</hi>  xxxiv. 12). It was again rebuilt by Augustus (29 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi>  under the name of the Curia Julia, as recorded in the inscription of Ancyra (see Angora)—CVRiAM. <hi rend="smallcaps">et . continens</hi>  . Ei. <hi rend="smallcaps">chalcidicvm ... feci. </hi>Little is known about the adjoining buildings called the Athenæum and Chalcidicum ; Dion Cassius (Ii. 22) mentions the group. In the reign of Domitian the Curia Julia was again rebuilt (Prosp. Aquit., p. 571), and lastly by Diocletian. There is strong evidence to show that the existing church of S. Adriano is the Curia of Diocletian, though of course much altered, and with its floor raised about 20 feet above the old level. Fig. 12 shows the front existing towards the Forum, omitting later windows and doors. As late as the time of Du Perac ( <hi rend="italic">Vesiigj di Roma)</hi>  the old entrance and level were preserved. He gives a drawing@@<hi rend="sup">12</hi>  of it with steps descending to the doorway. The ancient bronze doors now at the end of the nave of the Lateran basilica originally belonged to this building, and were removed thence by Alexander Λ II. Fig. 12 is derived from actual measurements of the part above ground, while the lower part, now buried, is derived from Du Perac’s drawing and from the bronze doors at the Lateran, which give the size of the opening,</p><p>@@@    Consules suffecti for 22 a.d.</p><p>@@@2    See Tac., <hi rend="italic">Ηist.,</hi>  iii. 74, 85 ; Suet., <hi rend="italic">Vit.,</hi>  17.</p><p>@@@    See Livy (xliv. 16), who mentions a house of P.
