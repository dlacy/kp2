<p><span class="font1">condottiere, taking a prominent part in the Lombard wars following on the death of Galeazzo Maria Visconti, and&nbsp;held rule for some time in Brescia and Bergamo. He&nbsp;left three natural sons, who were declared legitimate by&nbsp;Pope Martin V. The eldest, Galeotto (1411-32), was an&nbsp;ascetic, gave little or no attention to public business, and,&nbsp;dying early, bequeathed the state to his brother Sigismondo&nbsp;Pa∙ndolfo. The third son, Novello Malatesta (1418-65),&nbsp;ruled over Cesena.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Sigismondo (1417-68) is the personage to whom Rimini owes its renown during the Renaissance, of which indeed&nbsp;he was one of the strangest and most original representatives. He was born in Brescia, and when called to the&nbsp;succession, at the age of fifteen, had already given proofs&nbsp;of valour in the field. Of a robust and handsome person,&nbsp;he was a daring soldier and an astute politician. His&nbsp;knowledge of antiquity was so profound as to excite the&nbsp;admiration of all the learned men with whom he discoursed,&nbsp;even when, as in the case of Pius II., they chanced to be&nbsp;his personal enemies. A captain of renown and a skilful&nbsp;military engineer, he was also a generous patron of the&nbsp;fine arts and of letters. To him is due the erection of&nbsp;the church of St Francis, or temple of the Malatesta, one&nbsp;of the rarest gems of the Renaissance and the greatest of&nbsp;Rimini’s treasures. Sigismondo devoted enormous sums&nbsp;of money and much time and care to this building, giving&nbsp;it so original a stamp and one so thoroughly expressive&nbsp;of his own mind and character that, to a great extent, it&nbsp;may be considered his work. But he too was a man&nbsp;devoid of all faith and conscience, of all respect human&nbsp;or divine. Of so dissolute a life that, although married,&nbsp;he had children by several mistresses at the same time,&nbsp;he gave vent to all his passions with a ferocity that was&nbsp;bestial rather than human. And—as the crowning contradiction of his strange nature—from his youth to the&nbsp;day of his death he remained the devoted lover of the&nbsp;woman for whose sake he became a poet, whom he finally&nbsp;made his wife? and whom he exalted in every way, even&nbsp;to the point of rendering her almost divine honours.&nbsp;Yet this love never availed to check his excesses. The&nbsp;blood in his veins resembled that of the Borgia ; and&nbsp;of him, as of that iniquitous race, tradition has added&nbsp;much to the evil recorded by history, and truth and falsehood have been so subtly mingled that it is often difficult, sometimes impossible, to distinguish the one from&nbsp;the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">On assuming power in 1432 Sigismondo was already affianced to the daughter of Count Carmagnola, but when&nbsp;that famous leader was arraigned as a traitor by the&nbsp;Venetians, and ignominiously put to death, he promptly&nbsp;withdrew from his engagement, under the pretext that it&nbsp;was impossible to marry the child of a criminal. In fact&nbsp;he aimed at a higher alliance, for he espoused Ginevra&nbsp;d’Este, daughter of the duke of Ferrara, and his entry into&nbsp;Rimini with his bride in 1434 was celebrated by splendid&nbsp;festivities. In 1437 a son was born to him, but died&nbsp;within the year, and in 1440 the young mother followed&nbsp;it to the grave. Every one declared that she died by&nbsp;poison administered by her husband. This, however, was&nbsp;never proved. The duke of Ferrara remained his friend,&nbsp;nor is it known what motive Sigismondo could have for&nbsp;wishing to get rid of his wife. Two years afterwards he&nbsp;married Polissena, daughter of the famous coudottiere&nbsp;Francesco Sforza, who in 1443 bore him a son named&nbsp;Galeotto Roberto. But by this time he was already madly&nbsp;in love with Isotta degli Atti, and this was the passion&nbsp;that endured to his death. The lady succeeded in gaining&nbsp;an absolute ascendency over him, which increased with&nbsp;time. She bore him several children, but this did not&nbsp;prevent his having others by different concubines. Nor&nbsp;was this the sum of his excesses. He presently conceived&nbsp;a frantic passion for a German lady, the wife of a certain&nbsp;Borbona, who repulsed his advances. Thereupon he&nbsp;planned an ambuscade on the road to Fano in order&nbsp;to seize her by force. The lady arrived escorted by&nbsp;armed men, but Sigismondo attacked her so furiously that&nbsp;she was killed in the struggle, and it is said that he then&nbsp;wreaked his lust on her corpse (19th December 1448).&nbsp;Such being the nature of the man, it is not astonishing&nbsp;that, as his ardour for Isotta increased, he should have&nbsp;little scruple in ridding himself of his second wife. On&nbsp;the 1st June 1450 Polissena died by strangling, and on the&nbsp;30th of the same month Isotta’s offspring were legitimated&nbsp;by Nicholas V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is only just to record that, although Malatesta’s intrigue with Isotta had long been notorious to all, and he&nbsp;had never sought to conceal it, no one ever accused her of&nbsp;either direct or indirect complicity in her lover’s crimes.&nbsp;Isotta’s history, however, is a strange one, and opens up&nbsp;many curious questions. She was of noble birth and&nbsp;seems to have attracted Sigismondo’s notice as early as&nbsp;1438, for at the age of twenty he produced verses of&nbsp;some merit in praise of her charms. She was indeed&nbsp;widely celebrated for her beauty and intellect, culture,&nbsp;firmness, and prudence ; and even Pope Pius II. proclaimed&nbsp;her worthy to be greatly loved. When Sigismondo was&nbsp;absent she governed Rimini wisely and well, and proved&nbsp;herself a match for the statesmen with whom she had to&nbsp;deal. The leading poets of the court dedicated to her&nbsp;a collection of verses entitled </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Isottæi,</span><span class="font1"> styled her their&nbsp;mistress and the chosen of Apollo. Artists of renown&nbsp;perpetuated her features on canvas, on marble, and on&nbsp;many exquisite medals, one of which has a closed book&nbsp;graven on the reverse, with the inscription “ Elegiæ ” in&nbsp;allusion to poems she was said to have written. Nevertheless M. Yriarte, in his well-known book on the&nbsp;Malatesta and Rimini, asserts that there is documentary&nbsp;evidence to prove that Isotta was unable to sign her own&nbsp;name. He has arrived at this conclusion on the strength&nbsp;of certain documents found in the archives of Siena.&nbsp;These consist mainly of two letters addressed to Malatesta&nbsp;in 1454, when he was encamped near Siena, and both&nbsp;written and signed by the same hand. The first, signed&nbsp;Isotta, gives him news of his children, affectionately&nbsp;reproaches him with having betrayed her for the daughter&nbsp;of one Messer Galeazzo, and winds up by saying that she&nbsp;cannot be happy until he fulfils his often renewed promise,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font1">, to make her his wife. The second, bearing the same&nbsp;date, is signed with the initials of another woman : “ De&nbsp;la V. S. serva” (Your Highness’s servant) “S. de M.”—&nbsp;probably one of the Malatesta. This correspondent says&nbsp;that she had already written to him that day, by command&nbsp;of Isotta, who had gone with her to see Messer Galeazzo’s&nbsp;daughter, and freely vented her just indignation. Therefore&nbsp;M. Yriarte maintains that, had Isotta been able to write&nbsp;herself, she would not have employed another to speak of&nbsp;her love and jealousy and of the desired marriage. He&nbsp;feels assured that Isotta must have been altogether&nbsp;illiterate, since even the signature was written by another.</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>1&nbsp;</sup>But, as the second letter proves that Isotta went with&nbsp;her confidant to vent her rage on her rival, it is plain&nbsp;that she had no secrets from that friend. It is also&nbsp;possible that S. de M. (particularly if a Malatesta) had</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">@@@<sup>1</sup> The two letters are dated respectively 20th and 21st December ; but this must be an error, inasmuch as the second begins thus—&nbsp;“To-day Madonna Isotta made me write to you.” The year is not&nbsp;given, but it must have been 1454, since it was then, as we shall&nbsp;presently see, that the Sienese seized the papers of their general&nbsp;Malatesta, who, after betraying them, had hastily fled from the camp.&nbsp;Thus these letters, and other Malatestian documents, came to be preserved among the archives of Siena where they are still to be seen.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
