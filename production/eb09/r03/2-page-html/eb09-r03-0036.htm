<p><span class="font1">sensibility of the Italian temperament. These influences were certainly much less operative in the first century of&nbsp;the empire. The imitative impulse, which had much of&nbsp;the character of a creative impulse, and had resulted in&nbsp;the appropriation of the forms of poetry suited to the&nbsp;Roman and Italian character and of the metres suited to&nbsp;the genius of the Latin language, no longer stimulated to&nbsp;artistic effort. The great sources of Greek poetry were&nbsp;no longer regarded, as they were by Lucretius and Virgil,&nbsp;as “integri” and “sancti fontes,” and approached in a&nbsp;spirit at once of daring adventure and reverential enthusiasm.@@<sup>1</sup> We have the testimony of two men of the shrewdest&nbsp;common sense and the most masculine understanding—&nbsp;Martial and Juvenal—to the stale and lifeless character of&nbsp;the art of the Silver Age, which sought to reproduce in the&nbsp;form of epics, tragedies, and elegies the bright fancies of&nbsp;the Greek mythology.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The idea of Rome, owing to the antagonism between the policy of the Government and the sympathies of the&nbsp;class by which literature was favoured and cultivated,&nbsp;could no longer be an inspiring motive, as it had been in&nbsp;the literature of the republic and of the Augustan age.&nbsp;The spirit of Rome appears only as animating the protest&nbsp;of Lucan, the satire of Persius and Juvenal, the sombre&nbsp;picture which Tacitus paints of the annals of the empire.&nbsp;Oratory is no longer an independent voice appealing to&nbsp;sentiments of Roman dignity, but the weapon of the&nbsp;“delatores,” wielded for their own advancement and the&nbsp;destruction of that class which, even in their degeneracy,&nbsp;retained most sympathy with the national traditions.&nbsp;Roman history was no longer a record of national glory,&nbsp;stimulating the patriotism arid flattering the pride of all&nbsp;Roman citizens, but a personal eulogy or a personal invective, according as servility to a present or hatred of a&nbsp;recent ruler was the motive which animated it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The charm of Italian scenes still remained the same, but the fresh and inspiring feeling of nature as a great&nbsp;power in the world, a great restorative influence on human&nbsp;life, gave place to the mere sensuous gratification derived&nbsp;from the luxurious and artificial beauty of the country&nbsp;villa. The idealizing poetry of passion, which found a&nbsp;genuine voice in Catullus and the elegiac poets, could not&nbsp;prolong itself through the exhausting licence of successive&nbsp;generations. The vigorous vitality which gives interest&nbsp;to the personality of Catullus, Propertius, and Ovid no&nbsp;longer characterizes their successors. The pathos of natural&nbsp;affection is occasionally recognized in Statius and more&nbsp;rarely in Martial, but it has not the depth of tenderness&nbsp;found in Lucretius and Virgil. Human life is altogether&nbsp;shallower, has the same capacity for neither joy nor sorrow.&nbsp;The wealth and luxury of succeeding generations, the&nbsp;monotonous routine of life, the separation of the educated&nbsp;class from the higher work of the world, have produced&nbsp;their enervating and paralysing effect on the mainsprings&nbsp;of poetic and imaginative feeling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">New elements, however, appear in the literature of this period. As the result of the severance from the active&nbsp;' interests of life, a new interest is awakened in the inner&nbsp;life of the individual. The extreme immorality of the age&nbsp;not only affords abundant material to the satirist but&nbsp;deepens the consciousness of moral evil in purer and more&nbsp;thoughtful minds. To these causes we attribute the pathological observation of Seneca and Tacitus, the new sense&nbsp;of purity in Persius called out by contrast with the impurity around him, the glowing if somewhat sensational&nbsp;exaggeration of Juvenal, the vivid characterization of&nbsp;Martial. The literature of no time presents so powerfully</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@1 </sup>Contrast with the “ juvat Íntegros accedere fontes ” and the “ sanctos ausus recludere fontes ” of the older poets the first line of&nbsp;Persius’s prologue “ nec fonte labra prolui caballino.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">the contrast between moral good and evil. In this respect it is truly representative of the life of the age. Another&nbsp;new element is the influence of a new race. In the two&nbsp;preceding periods the rapid diffusion of literary culture&nbsp;following the Social War and the first Civil War was seen&nbsp;to awaken into new life the elements of original genius&nbsp;in Italy and Cisalpine Gaul. In the first century of the&nbsp;empire a similar result was produced by the diffusion of&nbsp;that culture in the Latinized districts of Spain. The&nbsp;fervid temperament of a fresh and vigorous race, which&nbsp;received the Latin discipline just as Latium had two or&nbsp;three centuries previously received the Greek discipline,&nbsp;revealed itself in the writings of the Senecas, Lucan,&nbsp;Quintilian, Martial, and others, who in their own time&nbsp;added literary distinction to the Spanish towns from which&nbsp;they came. This new cosmopolitan element introduced&nbsp;into Roman literature draws into greater prominence the&nbsp;characteristics of the last great representatives of the&nbsp;genuine Roman and Italian spirit,—Tacitus and Juvenal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">On the whole this century shows, in form, language, and substance, the beginning of literary decay. But it is&nbsp;still capable of producing men of original force; it still&nbsp;maintains the traditions of a happier time; it is still alive&nbsp;to the value of literary culture, and endeavours by minute&nbsp;attention to style to produce new effects. Though it was&nbsp;not one of the great eras in the annals of literature, yet&nbsp;the century which produced Martial, Juvenal, and Tacitus&nbsp;cannot be pronounced barren in literary originality, nor&nbsp;that which produced Seneca and Quintilian in culture and&nbsp;literary taste.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This fourth period is itself subdivided into three divisions :—(1) that extending from the accession of Tiberius to the death of Nero, 68,—the only important part of it&nbsp;being the Neronian age, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">54 to</span><span class="font1"> 68; (2) the Flavian era,&nbsp;from the death of Nero to the death of Domitian, 96;&nbsp;(3) the period included in the reigns of Nerva and Trajan&nbsp;and part of the reign of Hadrian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(1) For a generation after the death of Augustus no new original literary force appeared. The later poetry of&nbsp;the Augustan age had ended in trifling dilettanteism, for&nbsp;the continuance of which the atmosphere of the court was&nbsp;no longer favourable. The class by which literature was&nbsp;encouraged had become both enervated and terrorized.&nbsp;The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Fables</span><span class="font1"> of Phsedrus, the Pierian freedman, a work&nbsp;of no kind of national significance and representative in&nbsp;its morality only of the spirit of cosmopolitan individualism, is the chief poetical product of the time. Velleius&nbsp;Paterculus and Valerius Maximus are the most important&nbsp;prose-writers. The traditional culture was still, however,&nbsp;maintained, and the age was rich in grammarians and&nbsp;rhetoricians. The new profession of the “ delator ” must&nbsp;have given a stimulus to oratory. A high ideal of culture,&nbsp;literary as well as practical, was realized in Germanicus,&nbsp;which seems to have been transmitted to his daughter&nbsp;Agrippina, whose patronage of Seneca had important&nbsp;results in the next generation. The reign of Claudius&nbsp;was a time in which antiquarian learning, grammatical&nbsp;studies, and jurisprudence were cultivated, but no important additions were made to literature. A fresh impulse&nbsp;was given to letters on the accession of Nero, and this&nbsp;was partly due to the theatrical and artistic tastes of the&nbsp;young emperor. Four writers of the Neronian age still&nbsp;possess considerable interest,—Seneca, Lucan, Persius,&nbsp;and Petronius. The first three represent the spirit of&nbsp;their age by exhibiting the power of the Stoic philosophy&nbsp;as a moral, political, and religious force; the last is the&nbsp;most cynical exponent of the depravity of the time.&nbsp;Seneca (d. 65) is less than Persius a pure Stoic, and more&nbsp;of a moralist and pathological observer of man’s inner life.&nbsp;He makes the commonplaces of a cosmopolitan philosophy</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
