<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">occupations and the limitations of the Middle Ages, for this reason mainly that what we call mediaeval was to a very&nbsp;large extent Teutonic. But on the Spanish peninsula, in&nbsp;the masterpieces of Velazquez, Cervantes, Camoens,&nbsp;Calderon, we emerge into an atmosphere of art, definitely&nbsp;national, distinctly modern, where solid natural forms&nbsp;stand before us realistically modelled, with light and&nbsp;shadow on their rounded outlines, and where the airiest&nbsp;creatures of the fancy take shape and weave a dance of&nbsp;rhythmic, light, incomparable intricacy. The Spanish&nbsp;Renaissance would in itself suffice, if other witnesses were&nbsp;wanting, to prove how inaccurate is the theory that limits&nbsp;this movement to the revival of learning. Touched by&nbsp;Italian influences, enriched and fortified by the new&nbsp;learning, Spanish genius walked firmly forward on its own&nbsp;path. It was only crushed by forces generated in the&nbsp;nation that produced it, by the Inquisition and by despotic&nbsp;Catholic absolutism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">In the history of the Renaissance, Spain and Portugal represent the exploration of the ocean and the colonization&nbsp;of the other hemisphere. The voyages of Columbus and&nbsp;Vespucci to America, the rounding of the Cape by Diaz and&nbsp;the discovery of the sea road to India by Vasco da Gama,&nbsp;Cortes’s conquest of Mexico and Pizarro’s conquest of Peru,&nbsp;marked a new era for the human race and inaugurated the&nbsp;modern age more decisively than any other series of events&nbsp;has done. It has recently been maintained that modern&nbsp;European history is chiefly an affair of competition between&nbsp;confederated states for the possession of lands revealed by&nbsp;Columbus and Da Gama. Without challenging or adopting this speculation, it may be safely affirmed that nothing&nbsp;so pregnant of results has happened as this exploration of&nbsp;the globe. To say that it displaced the centre of gravity&nbsp;in politics and commerce, substituting the ocean for the&nbsp;Mediterranean, dethroning Italy from her seat of central&nbsp;importance in traffic, depressing the eastern and elevating&nbsp;the western powers of Europe, opening a path for Anglo-Saxon expansiveness, forcing philosophers and statesmen to&nbsp;regard the Occidental nations as a single group in counterpoise to other groups of nations, the European community&nbsp;as one unit correlated to other units of humanity upon&nbsp;this planet, is truth enough to vindicate the vast significance of these discoveries. The Renaissance, far from&nbsp;being the re-birth of antiquity with its civilization confined&nbsp;to the Mediterranean, with its Hercules’ Pillars beyond&nbsp;which lay Cimmerian darkness, was thus effectively the&nbsp;entrance upon a quite incalculably wider stage of life, in&nbsp;which mankind at large has since enacted one great drama,&nbsp;■i While Spanish navies were exploring the ocean, and&nbsp;Spanish paladins were overturning empires, Charles V.&nbsp;headed the reaction of Catholicism against reform.&nbsp;Stronger as king of Spain than as emperor, for the empire&nbsp;was little but a name, he lent the weight of his authority&nbsp;to that system of coercion and repression which enslaved&nbsp;Italy, desolated Germany with war, and drowned the Low&nbsp;Countries in blood. Philip II., with full approval of the&nbsp;Spanish nation, pursued the same policy in an even&nbsp;stricter spirit. He was powerfully assisted by two institutions, in which the national character of Spain expressed&nbsp;itself, the Inquisition and the Society of Jesus. Of the former&nbsp;it is not needful to speak here. But we have to observe&nbsp;that the last great phenomenon of the Spanish Renaissance&nbsp;was Ignatius Loyola, who organized the militia by means&nbsp;of which the church worked her Counter-Reformation.&nbsp;His motto, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Perinde ac cadaver</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">, expressed that recognition&nbsp;of absolutism which papacy and monarchy demanded for&nbsp;their consolidation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The logical order of an essay which attempts to show how Renaissance was correlated to Reformation and&nbsp;Counter-Reformation has necessitated the treatment of</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Italy, Germany, and Spain in succession; for these three 1 nations were the three main agents in the triple process to *&nbsp;be analysed. It was due to their specific qualities, and to<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>the diverse circumstances of their external development,<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>that the re-birth of Europe took this form of duplex action&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> on the lines of intellectual and moral progress, followed by&nbsp;reaction against mental freedom. We have now to speak&nbsp;of France, which earliest absorbed the influence of the&nbsp;Italian revival, and of England, which received it latest.&nbsp;The Renaissance may be said to have begun in France&nbsp;with Charles VIII.’s expedition to Naples, and to have continued until the extinction of the house of Valois. Louis&nbsp;XII. and Francis I. spent a considerable portion of their&nbsp;reigns in the attempt to secure possession of the Italian&nbsp;provinces they claimed. Henry II.’s queen was Catherine&nbsp;of the Medicean family ; and her children, Charles IX. and&nbsp;Henry III., were Italianated Frenchmen. Thus the connexion between France and Italy during the period 1494-1589 was continuous. The French passed to and fro&nbsp;across the Alps on military and peaceful expeditions.&nbsp;Italians came to France as courtiers, ambassadors, men of&nbsp;business, captains, and artists. French society assumed&nbsp;a strong Italian colouring, nor were the manners of the&nbsp;court very different from those of an Italian city, except&nbsp;that externally they remained ruder and less polished.&nbsp;The relation between the crown and its great feudatories,&nbsp;the military bias of the aristocracy, and the marked&nbsp;distinction between classes which survived from the Middle&nbsp;Ages, rendered France in many vital points unlike Italy.&nbsp;Yet the annals of that age, and the anecdotes retailed by&nbsp;Brantome, prove that the royalty and nobility of France&nbsp;had been largely Italianized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">It is said that Louis XII. brought Fra Giocondo of Verona back with him to France, and founded a school of&nbsp;architects. But we need not have recourse to this legend&nbsp;for the explanation of such Italian influences as were already&nbsp;noticeable in the Renaissance buildings on the Loire.&nbsp;Without determining the French style, Italian intercourse&nbsp;helped to stimulate its formation and development. There&nbsp;are students of the 15th century in France who resent&nbsp;this intrusion of the Italian Renaissance. But they forget&nbsp;that France was bound by inexorable laws of human&nbsp;evolution to obey the impulse which communicated itself to&nbsp;every form of art in Europe. In the school of Fontainebleau,&nbsp;under the patronage of Francis I., that Italian influence&nbsp;made itself distinctly felt; yet a true French manner had&nbsp;been already formed, which, when it was subsequently&nbsp;applied at Paris, preserved a marked national quality.&nbsp;The characteristic of the style developed by Bullant, De&nbsp;1’Orme, and Lescot, in the royal or princely palaces of&nbsp;Chenonceaux, Chambord, Anet, Ecouen, Fontainebleau,&nbsp;the Louvre, and elsewhere, is a blending of capricious&nbsp;fancy and inventive richness of decoration with purity of&nbsp;<sup>!</sup> outline and a large sense of the beauty of extended masses.&nbsp;Beginning with the older castles of Touraine, and passing&nbsp;onward to the Tuileries, we trace the passage from the&nbsp;mediaeval fortress to the modern pleasure house, and note&nbsp;how architecture obeyed the special demands of that new&nbsp;phenomenon of Renaissance civilization, the court. In the&nbsp;general distribution of parts these monumental buildings&nbsp;express the peculiar conditions which French society&nbsp;assumed under the influence of Francis I. and Diane de&nbsp;Poitiers. In details of execution and harmonic combinations they illustrate the precision, logic, lucidity, and&nbsp;cheerful spirit of the national genius. Here, as in&nbsp;Lombardy, a feeling for serene beauty derived from study&nbsp;of the antique has not interrupted the evolution of a style&nbsp;indigenous to France and eminently characteristic of the&nbsp;French temperament.</span></p>
