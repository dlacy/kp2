<p><span class="font0">character and conduct ; and for a writer of great candour and discernment, it was scarcely possible to satisfy either&nbsp;the Papists or the Protestants. The Life of Leo, with&nbsp;the omission of the documents contained in the appendix, was speedily reprinted at Philadelphia ; but the sale&nbsp;was not there so rapid as that of his former work. A German translation, by Professor Glaser, was published at Leipzig in three volumes octavo, which successively appeared in&nbsp;1806, 1807, and 1808. A preface, notes, and disquisitions,&nbsp;were contributed by Henke. In 1808 a French translation, by P. F. Henry, was published at Paris, and a corrected edition appeared in 1813. An Italian version was&nbsp;subsequently undertaken by Count Luigi Bossi, who began&nbsp;by translating from the French. This work extended to&nbsp;twelve volumes octavo, published at Milan in 1816 and&nbsp;1817. He added a variety of notes and documents illustrative of the text, together with numerous engravings of&nbsp;portraits and medals. The sovereign pontiff, Leo XII., inserted this translation in the catalogue of prohibited books,&nbsp;but in spite of his denunciation, 2800 copies of it have&nbsp;been dispersed in Italy, where the name of the elegant&nbsp;author continues to be held in no common estimation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Soon after the appearance of his great work, he was suddenly induced to place himself in a new sphere of action. “ Although from a very early period of life Mr Roscoe had&nbsp;taken a deep interest in public affairs, and had manifested,&nbsp;not only by his writings, but also by the part he had taken&nbsp;in promoting public meetings in Liverpool, the strong desire he felt to render himself useful to the country, he had&nbsp;yet never entertained the idea that he should be called upon&nbsp;to fill the responsible situation of a representative of the&nbsp;people. It was therefore with the greatest surprise that,&nbsp;on the eve of the general election in 1806, he received a&nbsp;requisition from a number of the most respectable burgesses of Liverpool, requesting him to come forward as a&nbsp;candidate for the representation of his native town.” This&nbsp;requisition he received on the 30th of October ; he issued&nbsp;his address to the electors on the following day, and the&nbsp;election commenced on tlιe first of November. His two&nbsp;opponents were General Gascoigne and General Tarleton ;&nbsp;of whom the former had represented the borough for ten,&nbsp;and the latter for sixteen years. They were both Tories,&nbsp;but with this difference, that Tarleton was a deserter from&nbsp;the Whigs. They were both supported by the corporation ;&nbsp;but after a very strenuous contest of seven days, the election terminated in favour of Roscoe, who had nearly two&nbsp;hundred votes over Tarleton, and thirteen over Gascoigne.&nbsp;During the progress of the election, he had uniformly been&nbsp;the popular candidate ; his success was hailed with the most&nbsp;enthusiastic rejoicings; and he was chaired through a greater&nbsp;concourse of people than the town had probably ever beheld on any former occasion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Of the House of Commons he was not a silent member. He took a respectable share in various debates ; and he had&nbsp;the high satisfaction of raising his voice in favour of the&nbsp;abolition of the slave-trade. He likewise made a judicious&nbsp;speech in support of Romilly’s bill for subjecting real estates to debts of simple contract. The unhappy and inveterate prejudices of the king led to the dissolution of the&nbsp;ministry in the spring of 1807. On the 15th of April, Mr&nbsp;Littleton moved a resolution, expressing the regret of the&nbsp;house at the recent change in his majesty’s councils ; and&nbsp;Mr Roscoe then spoke with manly indignation against the&nbsp;conduct of Canning, who, in a previous debate, had thought&nbsp;proper to threaten the house, that if its members did not&nbsp;vote according to the will of the ministry, his majesty would&nbsp;be advised to appeal to the people, or, in other words, to&nbsp;dissolve his parliament. The parliament was dissolved, and&nbsp;the senseless cry of “ No Popery,” and “ the Church in&nbsp;danger,” resounded from one end of the island to the other.&nbsp;It was the peculiar infelicity and infatuation of the old</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">king’s administration, that he was uniformly averse from employing men who supported the principles which had&nbsp;placed his family on the British throne.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Mr Roscoe returned to Liverpool in the month of May, and, on approaching the town, was received by a numerous&nbsp;procession of friends, partly on horseback, and partly on&nbsp;foot. Their progress was speedily obstructed by large bodies of men, chiefly consisting of the crews of vessels recently engaged in the slave-trade, armed with bludgeons&nbsp;and other weapons, and disposed along the range of streets.&nbsp;The procession moved with difficulty, and not without danger. Many personal injuries were sustained on both sides ;&nbsp;and if great forbearance had not been displayed towards the&nbsp;ruffianly assailants, the most fatal consequences might have&nbsp;ensued. When he reached the bank, and attempted to address the crowd, the clamour was so loud and unceasing&nbsp;that he found it impossible to obtain a hearing. He had&nbsp;honourably given a vote against the traffic in human flesh,&nbsp;and by that craft most of the disorderly multitude had their&nbsp;living. Disgusted at such a display of popular violence, he&nbsp;speedily declared his resolution of declining to offer himself&nbsp;as a candidate at the ensuing election ; but he was nominated without his own consent, and the contest was protracted till the seventh day, when it terminated by the return of the two generals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Although he thus ceased to be a member of parliament, he did not cease to take an interest in public affairs. In&nbsp;1808 he published “ Considerations on the Causes, Objects,&nbsp;and Consequences of the present War, and on the Expediency or the Danger of Peace with France.” This was an&nbsp;able as well as a seasonable publication ; but we cannot add,&nbsp;that it produced any extensive or speedy effects. The war,&nbsp;which had been carried on at such an enormous expense of&nbsp;blood and treasure, was profitable to an immense multitude&nbsp;of individuals : it served to extend the patronage and influence of the ministry ; loans, contracts, and other contingencies, enriched one class of their adherents ; an immense&nbsp;field of employment and promotion was opened in the army&nbsp;and navy ; while another class of men, who were specially&nbsp;bound to act as messengers of peace, were too generally&nbsp;disposed to keep in the onward path of preferment by&nbsp;preaching in favour of “ this just and necessary war.” The&nbsp;real object of the war was a matter so extremely doubtful,&nbsp;that it. was not unusual to hear a variety of objects specified by different individuals all equally fervent in the same&nbsp;cause. By one great personage, the hopeful project of&nbsp;restoring the Bourbons was doubtless contemplated as the&nbsp;great and paramount object. Roscoe's tract was published&nbsp;in January, and a fourth edition was sent to press before&nbsp;the end of that month. It was speedily followed by “ Remarks on the Proposals made to Great Britain for opening&nbsp;Négociations for Peace, in the year 1807.” The several&nbsp;tracts which he had published on such topics, were in 1810&nbsp;collected into a volume bearing the title of “ Occasional&nbsp;Tracts relative to the War.” This collection, which includes several tracts that have not been enumerated, remains a monument of his wisdom, in the midst of the general phrensy which then prevailed. In 1812 he published&nbsp;“ A Review of the Speeches of the Right Hon. George&nbsp;Canning on the late Election for Liverpool, so far as they&nbsp;relate to the Questions of Peace and Reform.” Roscoe was&nbsp;an able and enlightened advocate of parliamentary reform,&nbsp;as of all other attempts to improve the general welfare.&nbsp;During this general election, some of the inhabitants entertained a plan of returning him free of expense. He&nbsp;was likewise solicited to allow his friends to put him in nomination at Westminster ; but he had no inclination to resume his seat in the House of Commons. Some of the&nbsp;electors of Leicester, where any opposition to the prevalent corruption was nearly hopeless, nominated him as a&nbsp;candidate without his previous knowledge ; and, under</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
