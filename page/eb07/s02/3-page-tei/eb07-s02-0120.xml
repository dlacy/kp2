The inhabitants are chiefly Hindus, the number of Mahommedan families not exceeding sixty or seventy, and most of these being petty shopkeepers. The Hindu inhabitants are chiefly the descendants of emigrants from the Doab and province of Oude. Serinagur is the seat of an inconsiderable trade, the most profitable branch of which consists of a traffic in silver and specie, which is carried on to a considerable amount by the leading persons in the town, who are agents of the great banking-houses at Najibabad and in the Doab, and who are employed in the sale of merchandise and coins. The other articles of trade are the produce of the hills, consisting of coarse hempen cloth, hemp, lead, copper, drugs, gums, wool, and a sort of flannel made of wool. From Bootan are imported cow-tails, musk, saffron, borax, salt, drugs of different kinds, and a few shawls that are sent circuitously from Cashmere. Hawks are also brought from the hills. The articles received in exchange are coarse cotton and woollen cloths, silk, spices, Lahore salt, sugar, and tobacco. The air of Serinagur is unfavourable to strangers, on which account many of the merchants forsake it during the rainy season. Long. 79. 18. E. Lat. 30. 11. N.</p><p>SERINGAPATAM, a celebrated city of Hindustan, in the province of Mysore, of which it is the capital. Its situation is remarkable, being at the upper end of an island four miles in length by one and a half in breadth, formed by the Cavery, which is here a large and rapid river, having a broad channel, that is, however, impeded by rocks and fragments of granite. The proper name of this city is Siri Runge Patan, or the city of Sri Ranga, corrupted in common language into Patana. It has been known as a fortress from a very early period ; the fort is situated at the west end of the island ; its area is about a mile, and it is an immense mass of building, unfinished, and its defences injudiciously constructed. The fortifications exhibit the long straight walls and square bastions of the Hindus ; and the glacis is in many parts so high that it sheltered the assailants. The suburbs occupy the middle and highest part of the island, and are about half a mile square. The streets are, like those of most eastern towns, narrow and confused ; nor are there any public buildings which are noted for elegance or splendour in the eyes of Europeans. They have all a mean appearance. Hyder’s palace, named the Lolbang, which was finished in 1780, when he was occupied in the wars of the Carnatic, and to which he never returned, is situatcd at the east end of the island. It is two stories in height, and, according to Lord Valentia, by whom it was visited, it is by no means an inelegant building, though mud is the material of which it is constructed. The ground-floor was very public, and seems to have been occupied by the attendants. Above are excellent apartments, and balconies opening into courts in which the sultan usually sat and gave audience. It was prettily painted, but, owing to the want of windows, was too gloomy for a European habitation, and has accordingly been altered and improved by the British residents. It is situated in a garden, which was beautiful, but was destroyed during the siege of the city. Adjoining to this building is the tomb of Hyder, where now rests all that was royal of this Mussulman dynasty, namely, Hyder, his wife, and Tippoo, under tombs of black marble elevated about eighteen inches from the ground, and covered with rich cloths, which have a canopy over them. The whole building, with its dome, its brilliantly polished black marble columns, and its mosque annexed, has a handsome effect. In the verandah are buried several of the family ; and on the outside, upon an elevated platform which goes round the whole building, are the tombs of several faithful servants. The British government allow 2000 pagodas annually to the Moulahs for reading the Koran, and for musicians to perform the nobut. The palace in the city</p><p>is a very large building, surrounded by a massy and lofty wall of stone and mud, and of a mean appearance. All the buildings arc now converted to very different uses from those for which they were originally intended. Hyder’s palace is the residence of a surgeon ; his seraglio is converted into a European hospital ; and Tippoo’s seraglio has become a barrack for artillery. His private abode is occupied by the resident, and his public apartments by European troops. There is a palace built by Tippoo near the town, which was the residence of General Wellesley. The upper floor consists of one central room, with four others at the corners, and verandahs below them, all very curiously painted ; a verandah below covers each side, on the walls of which is painted the famous battle with Colonel Baillie. Other paintings adorn the walls, in which Hyder and Tippoo are represented as conquerors, and subject princes are painted below.</p><p>In 1610, Seringapatam was taken from the fallen dynasty of Bijanagur by the rajah of Wadeyar, and made the capital of Mysore. The town was increased and the fortifications improved by his successors. But it was Hyder and his son Tippoo who took pleasure in strengthening and embellishing this the capital of their dominions. It was then that it arrived at that degree of splendour and strength which attracted the cupidity and afterwards foiled the attempts of the neighbouring powers. It was afterwards besieged by the Mahrattas and by the nizam’s troops, and was rescued from their attacks by Hyder consenting to pay large sums of money for its security. In 1800, according to a register of the houses, the fort or city contained 4130 houses and 5900 families, and the suburbs 2216 houses and 3336 families. Estimating five pcrsons to each house, the city and suburbs will be found to contain 31,895 persons, independently of a strong garrison and its numerous followers. During the reign of Tippoo, the island of Seringapatam was estimated to contain 150,000 inhabitants. They were greatly diminished during the siege, and after the storming of the place; but many have since been attracted to the rajah's residence at the city of Mysore, and many Mahommedans who originally came from the Carnatic have returned, after the destruction of Hyder’s dynasty. the manufactures of Seringapatam and its vicinity were never considerable, and principally consisted of military stores and camp equipage. Timber sells here at a high price, being brought principally by land-carriage from the Western Ghauts. Bread is also dear, which compels the Europeans to subsist upon rice. Good vegetables and excellent meat are, however, to be had in abundance. In February 1792, Seringapatam was invested by a formidable British force, amounting to 400,000, including followers of every description. Tippoo had not the means of withstanding this numerous host ; and his intrenched camp being stormed with great loss, he was compelled to yield to the humiliating terms imposed upon him by his conquerors, to relinquish half his dominions, and to pay to them the sum of three and a half millions. In 1799, war being again declared by the British against Tippoo, an immense force, under General Harris, advanced against the capital, which was invested by the British and the nizam’s forces on the l4th of April, and was stormed, with a great slaughter of the garrison, in the afternoon of the 4th of May. Tippoo himself was killed under a gateway, by a party, it is supposed, of the twelfth regiment of foot, but by whom is not known, no individual having ever appeared to claim the honour ; nor was it discovered who obtained possession of his valuable necklace of pearls. The British have ever since retained possession of the island, which now forms one of the collectorships under the Madras presidency. The travelling distance from Madras is 200 miles, from Hyderabad 406, from Poonah 525, from Bombay 622, from Nagpoor 727, from Calcutta 1170, and from Delhi 1321 miles. Long. 76. 51. E. Lat. 12. 26.
