<p><span class="font1">to imitate. Meanwhile, that there shall be no clashing of conceptions to inhibit the tendency of the idea of an acquired&nbsp;“ grace ” to realize itself in action, is secured by the complete&nbsp;unanimity of public opinion, dominated as it is by an inveterate&nbsp;custom. To appreciate the consecrating effect of religion on&nbsp;primitive life we have only to look to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">churinga</span><span class="font1">-worship&nbsp;of the Central Australians (as described by Spencer and Gillen&nbsp;in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Native Tribes of Central Australia</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Northern&nbsp;Tribes of Central Australia).</span><span class="font1"> Contact with these repositories&nbsp;of mystic'influence “makes them glad” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Nat. Tr.</span><span class="font1"> 165); it&nbsp;likewise makes them “ good,” so that they are no longer greedy&nbsp;or selfish </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(North. Tr.</span><span class="font1"> 266); it endows them with second sight&nbsp;(ibid.); it gives them confidence and success in war </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Nat. Tr.</span><span class="font1"> 135);&nbsp;in fact, there is no end to its “strengthening” effects (ibid.</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">n</span><span class="font1">.).&nbsp;Or, again, we may note the earnestness and solemnity that&nbsp;characterize all their sacred ceremonies. The inwardness&nbsp;of primitive religion is, however, non-existent for those who&nbsp;observe it as uninitiated strangers; whilst, again, it evaporates&nbsp;as soon as native custom breaks down under pressure of&nbsp;civilization, when only fragments of meaningless superstition&nbsp;survive: wherefore do travesties of primitive religion abound.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It remains to consider shortly the consecration of life in relation to particular categories and departments. (1) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Education.</span><span class="font1"> Almost every tribe has its initiation ceremonies, and in&nbsp;many tribes adult life may almost be described as a continuous&nbsp;initiation. The object of these rites is primarily to impart&nbsp;mystic virtue to the novice, such virtue, in the eyes of the&nbsp;primitive man, being always something more than social usefulness, amounting as it does to a share in the tribal luck by&nbsp;means of association with all it holds sacred. Incidentally&nbsp;the candidate is trained to perform his duties as a tribesman,&nbsp;but religion presides over the course, demanding earnest&nbsp;endeavour of an impressionable age. (2) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Government.</span><span class="font1"> Where&nbsp;society is most primitive it is most democratic, as in Australia,&nbsp;and magico-religious powers are possessed by the whole body&nbsp;of fully initiated males, age, however, conferring increase of&nbsp;sacred lore and consequently of authority; whilst even at&nbsp;this stage the experts tend to form an inner circle of rulers.&nbsp;The man with </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">mana</span><span class="font1"> is bound to come to the top, both because&nbsp;his gifts give him a start and because his success is taken as a&nbsp;sign that he has the gift. A decisive “ moment ” in the evolution of chief ship is the recognition of hereditary </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">mana,</span><span class="font1"> bound&nbsp;up as this is with the handing on of ceremonies and cult-objects.&nbsp;Invested, as society grows more complex, with a sanctity increasingly superior to that of the layman,, the priest-king&nbsp;becomes the representative of the community as repository&nbsp;of its luck, whilst, as controller of all sacred forces that bear&nbsp;thereon, he is, as Dr Frazer puts it, “ dynamical centre of the&nbsp;universe” (The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Bough</span><span class="font1"> (2nd ed.), i. 233). Only when the&nbsp;holy man’s duty to preserve his holiness binds him hand and foot&nbsp;in a network of taboos does his temporal power tend to devolve&nbsp;on a deputy. (3) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pood-supply.</span><span class="font1"> In accordance with the&nbsp;principle of Renovation (see above), the root-idea of the application of religion to economics is not the extorting of boons&nbsp;from an unwilling nature, but rather the stimulation of the&nbsp;sources of life, so that all beings alike may increase and multiply.&nbsp;(4) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Food-taking.</span><span class="font1"> Meanwhile, the primitive meal is always more&nbsp;or less of a sacrament, and there are many food-taboos, the&nbsp;significance of which is, however, not so much that certain&nbsp;foods are unclean and poisonous as that they are of special&nbsp;virtue and must be partaken of solemnly and with circumspection. (s) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Kinship.</span><span class="font1"> It is hard to say whether the unit&nbsp;of primitive society is the tribe or the group of kinsmen. Both&nbsp;are forms of union that are consolidated by means of religious&nbsp;usages. Thus in Australia the initiation ceremonies, concerned&nbsp;as they partly are with marriage, always an affair between&nbsp;the kin-groups, are tribal, whilst the totemic rites are the prime&nbsp;concern of the members of the totem clans. The significance&nbsp;of a common name and a common blood is immensely enhanced&nbsp;by its association with mystic rights and duties, and the pulse&nbsp;of brotherhood beats faster. (6) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Family.</span><span class="font1"> Side by side&nbsp;with the kin there is-always found the domestic group, but&nbsp;the latter institution develops fully only as the former weakens,&nbsp;so that the one comes largely to inherit the functions of the&nbsp;other, whilst the tribe too in its turn hands over certain interests.&nbsp;Thus in process of time birth-rites, marriage-rites, funeral-rites, not to mention subordinate ceremonies such as those&nbsp;of name-giving and food-taking, become domestic sacraments.&nbsp;(7) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sex.</span><span class="font1"> Woman, for certain physiological reasons, is always&nbsp;for primitive peoples hedged round with sanctity, whilst man&nbsp;does all he can to inspire awe of his powers in woman by keeping religion largely in his own hands. Theresult, so far as&nbsp;woman is concerned, is that, in company with those males&nbsp;who are endowed with sacredness in a more than ordinary&nbsp;degree, she tends as a sex to lose in freedom as much as she&nbsp;gains in respect. (8) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Personality.</span><span class="font1"> Every one has his modicum&nbsp;of innate </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">mana,</span><span class="font1"> or at least may develop it in himself by communicating with powers that can be brought into answering&nbsp;relation by the proper means. Nagualism, or the acquisition&nbsp;of a mystic guardian, is a widely distributed custom, the essence&nbsp;of which probably consists in the procuring of a personal name&nbsp;having potency. The exceptional man is recognized as having&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">mana</span><span class="font1"> in a special degree, and a belief thus held at once by&nbsp;others and by himself is bound to stimulate his individuality.&nbsp;The primitive community is not so custom-bound that personality has no chance to make itself felt, and the leader of&nbsp;men possessed of an inner fund of inspiration is the wonderworker who encourages all forms </span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font1">social advance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Psychology of the Primitive Attitude towards the Sacred.—</span><span class="font1">We are on firmer ground when simply describing the phenomena of&nbsp;primitive religion than when seeking to account for these in&nbsp;terms of natural law—in whatever sense the conception of&nbsp;natural law be applicable to the facts of the mental life of man.&nbsp;One thing is certain, namely, that savages stand on virtually&nbsp;one footing with the civilized as regards the type of explanation&nbsp;appropriate to their beliefs and practices. We have no right to&nbsp;refer to “ instincts ” in the case of primitive man, any more&nbsp;at any rate than we have in our own case. A child of civilized&nbsp;parents brought up from the first amongst savages is a savage,&nbsp;neither more nor less. Though race may count for something&nbsp;in the matter of mental endowment—and at least it would seem&nbsp;to involve differences in weight of brain—it clearly counts for&nbsp;much less than does </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">milieu,</span><span class="font1"> to wit, that social environment of&nbsp;ideas and institutions which depends so largely for its effectiveness&nbsp;on mechanical means of tradition, such as the art of writing.&nbsp;The outstanding feature of the mental life of savages known to&nbsp;psychologists as “ primitive credulity ” is doubtless chiefly due&nbsp;to sheer want of diversity of suggestiveness in their intellectual&nbsp;surroundings. Their notions stick fast because there are no&nbsp;competing notions to dislodge them. Society suffers a sort of&nbsp;perpetual obsession, and remains self-hypnotized as it were&nbsp;within a magic circle of traditional views. A rigid orthodoxy&nbsp;is sustained by means of purblind imitation assisted by no little&nbsp;persecution. Such changes as occur come about, not in consequence of a new direction taken by conscious policy, but rather&nbsp;in the way that fashions in dress alter amongst ourselves, by&nbsp;subconscious, hardly purposive drifting. The crowd rather&nbsp;than the individual is the thinking unit. A proof is the&nbsp;mysterious rapid extinction of savages the moment that their&nbsp;group-life is broken up; they are individually so many lost&nbsp;sheep, without self-reliance or initiative. And the thinking&nbsp;power of a crowd—that is, a mob, not a deliberative assembly—&nbsp;is of a very low order, emotion of a “ panicky ” type driving it&nbsp;hither and thither like a rudderless ship. However, as the&nbsp;students of mob-psychology have shown, every crowd tends to&nbsp;have its </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">meneur,</span><span class="font1"> its mob-leader, the man who sets the cheering&nbsp;or starts the running-away. So too, then, with the primitive&nbsp;society. Grossly ignorant of all that falls outside “ the daily&nbsp;round, the common task,” they are full of panicky fears in regard&nbsp;to this unknown, and the primary attitude of society towards&nbsp;it is sheer avoidance, taboo. But the mysterious has another&nbsp;face. To the mob the mob-leader is mysterious in his power&nbsp;of bringing luck and salvation; to himself also he is a wonder,&nbsp;since he wills, and lo ! things happen accordingly. He has</span></p>
