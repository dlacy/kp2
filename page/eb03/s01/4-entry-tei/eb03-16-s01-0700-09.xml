or <hi rend="smallcaps">Schirauz,</hi> a large and famous town of Perſia, capital of Farſiſtan, is three miles in length from eaſt to weſt, but not ſo much in breadth. It is ſeated at the north-weſt end of a ſpacious plain ſurrounded with very high hills, under one of which the town ſtands. The houſes are built of bricks dried in the ſun; the roofs are flat and terraced. There are 15 handſome moſques, tiled with ſtones of a bluiſh green colour, and lined within with black poliſhed marble. There are many large and beautiful gardens, ſurrounded with walls fourteen feet high, and four thick. They contain various kinds of very fine trees, with fruits almoſt of every kind, beſides various beautiful flowers. The wines of Schiras are not only the beſt in Perſia, but, as ſome think, in the whole world. The women are much addicted to gallantry, and Schiras is called <hi rend="italic">an earthly ρaradise</hi> by ſome. The ruins of the famous Perſepolis are 30 miles to the north-eaſt of this place. E.
