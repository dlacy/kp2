or <hi rend="smallcaps">Sincellus,</hi> an ancient officer in the family of the patriarchs and other prelates of the eastern church. The word, in the corrupt Greek, <hi rend="italic">συγχελλος</hi>, signifies a person who lies in the chamber with another ; a <hi rend="italic">chamber-fellow,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">chum.</hi> The syncellus was an ecclesiastic, who lived with the patriarch of Constantinople, to be a witness of his conduct; whence it is that the syncellus was also called the <hi rend="italic">patriarch's eye,</hi> because his business was to observe and watch. The other prelates had also their syn- celli, who were clerks living in the house with them, and even lying in the same chamber, to be witnesses of the purity of their manners. The office afterwards degenerated into a mere dignity ; and there were made syncelli of churches. At last, it became a title of honour, and was bestowed by the emperor on the prelates themselves ; whom they called <hi rend="italic">pontifical syncelli,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">syncelli Augustales.</hi></p></div></body></text></TEI>
