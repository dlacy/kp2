or <hi rend="smallcaps">Sanhedrin,</hi> from the Greek word Συνεδριον, which ſigniſies a council or aſſembly of perſons fitting together, was the name whereby the Jews called the great council of the nation, aſſembled in an apartment of the temple of Jeruſalem to determine the moſt important affairs both of their church and ſtate. This council conſiſted of ſeventy ſenators. The room they met in was a rotunda, half of which was built without the temple, and half within; that is, one ſemicircle was within the compaſs of the temple; the other ſemicircle, they tell us, was built without, for the ſenators to fit in; it being unlawful for any one to ſit down in the temple. The Naſi, or prince of the ſanhedrim, ſat upon a throne at the end of the hall, having his deputy at his right hand, and his ſub-deputy on his left. The other ſenators were ranged in order on each fide.</p><p>The rabbins pretend, that the ſanhedrim has always ſubſiſted in their nation from the time of Moſes down to the deſtruction of the temple by the Romans. They date the eſtabliſhment of it from what happened in the wilderneſſs, ſome time after the people departed from Sinai (Numb. xi. 16. ), in the year of the world 2514. Moſes, being diſcouraged by the continual murmurings of the Iſraelites, addreſſed himſelf to God, and deſired to be relieved, at leaſt, from ſome part of the burden of the government. Then the Lord ſaid to him, “Gather unto me 70 men of the elders of Iſrael, whom thou knoweſt to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them unto the tabernacle of the congregation, that they may ſtand there with thee: And I will come down and talk with thee there; and I will take of the ſpirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they ſhall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear it not thyſelf alone. ” The Lord, therefore, poured out his ſpirit upon theſe men, who began at that time to prophecy, and have not ceaſed from that time. The ſanhedrim was compoſed of 70 counſellors, or rather 72, fix out</p><p>of each tribe; and Moſes, as preſident, made up the number 73. To prove the uninterrupted ſucceſſion of the judges of the ſanhedrim, there is nothing unattempted by the partiſans of this opinion. They find a proof where others cannot ſo much as perceive any appearance or ſhadow of it. Grotius may be conſulted in many places of his Commentaries, and in his firſt book <hi rend="italic">De jure belli &amp; pacis,</hi> c. 3. art. 20. and <hi rend="italic">Selden de Synedriis veterum Hebraeorum.</hi> Alſo, Calmet’s Diſſertation concerning the polity of the ancient Hebrews, printed before his Comment upon the Book of Numbers.</p><p>As to the perſonal qualifications of the judges of this bench, their birth was to be untainted. They were often taken from the race of the prieſts or Levites, or out of the number of the inferior judges, or from the leſſer ſanhedrim, which conſiſted only of 23 judges. — They were to be ſkilful in the law, as well traditional as written. They were obliged to ſtudy magic, divination, fortune-telling, phyſic, aſtrology, arithmetic, and languages. The Jews ſay, they were to know to the number of 70 tongues; that is, they were to know all the tongues, for the Hebrews acknowledged but 70 in all, and perhaps this is too great a number. Eunuchs were excluded from the ſanhedrim, becauſe of their cruelty, uſurers, decrepid perſons, players at games of chance, ſuch as had any bodily deformities, thoſe that had brought up pigeons to decoy others to their pigeon- houſes, and thoſe that made a gain of their fruits in the ſabbatical year. Some alſo exclude the high-prieſt and the king, becauſe of their too great power; but others will have it, that the kings always preſided in the ſanhedrim, while there were any kings in Iſrael. — Laſtly, it was required, that the members of the ſanhedrim ſhould be of a mature age, a handſome perſon, and of conſiderable fortune. We ſpeak now according to the notions of the rabbins, without pretending to warrant their opinions.</p><p>The authority of the great ſanhedrim was vaſtly extenſive. This council decided ſuch cauſes as were brought before it by way of appeal from the inferior courts. The king, the high-prieſt, the prophets, were under its juriſdiction. If the king offended againſt the law, for example, if he married above 18 wives, if he kept too many horſes, if he hoarded up too much gold and ſilver, the ſanhedrim had him ſtripped and whipped in their preſence. But whipping, they ſay, among the Hebrews was not at all ignominious; and the king bore this correction by way of penance, and himſelf made choice of the perſon that was to exerciſe this difcipline over him. Alſo, the general affairs of the nation were brought before the ſanhedrim. The right of judging in capital caſes belonged to this court, and this ſentence could not be pronounced in any other place, but in the hall called <hi rend="italic">Laſchat-haggazith,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">hall paved with ſstones,</hi> ſuppoſed by ſome to be the ΛιϴοςωדϬ, or <hi rend="italic">pavement,</hi> mentioned in John xix. 13. From whence it came to paſs, that the Jews were forced to quit this hall when the power of life and death was taken out of their hands, 40 years before the deſtruction of their temple, and three years before the death of Jeſus Chriſt. In the time of Moſes this council was held at the door of the tabernacle of the teſtimony. As ſoon as the people were in poſſeſſion of the land of promiſe, the ſanhedrim followed the tabernacle. It was kept ſucceſ-<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0657.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0651"/>
ſively at Gilgal, at Shiloh, at Kirjath-jearim, at Nob, at Gibeon in the houſe of Obed-edom; and laſtly, it was fettled at Jeruſalem, till the Babyloniſh captivity. During the captivity it was kept up at Babylon. After the return from Babylon, it continued at Jeruſalem to the time of the Sicarii, or Aſſaſſins. Then finding that theſe profligate wretches, whoſe number increaſed every day, ſometimes eſcaped puniſhment by the favour of the preſident or judges, it was removed to Hanoth, which were certain abodes ſituated, as the rabbins tell us, upon the mountain of the temple. From thence they came down into the city of Jeruſalem, withdrawing themſelves by degrees from the temple. Afterwards they removed to J amnia, thence to Jericho, to Uzzah, to Sepharvaim, to Bethſanim, to Sephoris, laſt of all to Tiberias, where they continued to the time of their utter extinction. And this is the account the Jews themſelves give us of the ſanhedrim.</p><p>But the learned do not agree with them in all this. Father Petau fixes the beginning of the ſanhedrim not till Gabinius was governor of Judea, who, according to Joſephus, erected tribunals in the five principal cities of Judea; at Jeruſalem, at Gadara, at Amathus, at Jericho, and at Sephora or Sephoris, a city of Galilee. Grotius places the origin of the ſanhedrim under Moſes, as the rabbins do; but he makes it determine at the beginning of Herod’s reign. Mr Baſnage at firſt thought that the ſanhedrim began under Gabinius; but afterwards he places it under Judas Maccabaeus, or under his brother Jonathan. We ſee indeed, under Jonathan Maccabaeus, (1 Macc. xii. 6. ), in the year 3860, that the ſenate with the high-prieſt ſent an embaſſy to the Romans. The rabbins ſay, that Alexander Janneus, king of the Jews, of the race of the Aſmonaeans, appeared before the ſanhedrim, and claimed a right oſ ſitting there, whether the ſenators would or not. Joſephus informs us, that when Herod was but yet governor of Galilee, he was ſummoned before the ſenate, where he appeared. It muſt be therefore acknowledged, that the ſanhedrim was in being before the reign of Herod. It was in being afterwards, as we find from the Goſpel and from the Acts. Jeſus Chriſt in St Matthew (v. 22. ) diſtinguiſhes two tribunals. — “Whoſoever is angry with his brother without a cauſe ſhall be in danger of the judgment. ” This, they ſay, is the tribunal of the 23 judges. “And whoſoever ſhall ſay to his brother Raca, ſhall be in danger of the council; ” that is, of the great ſanhedrim, which had the right of life and death, at leaſt generally, and before this right was taken away by the Romans. Some think that the juriſdiction of the council of 23 extended to life and death alſo; but it is certain that the ſanhedrim was ſuperior to this council. See alſo Mark xiii. 9. xiv. 55. XV. 1.; Luke xxii. 52, 66.; John xi. 47.; Act3 iv. 15. V. 21. where mention is made of the ſynedrion, or ſanhedrim.</p><p>From all this it may be concluded, that the origin of the ſanhedrim is involved in uncertainty; for the council of the 70 elders eſtabliſhed by Moſes was not what the Hebrews underſtand by the name of ſanhedrim. Beſides, we cannot perceive that this eſtabliſhment ſubſiſted either under Joſhua, the judges, or the kings. We find nothing of it after the captivity, till the time of Jonathan Maccabæus. The tribunals erected by Gabinius were very different from the ſanhedrim, which was the</p><p>ſupreme court of judicature, and fixed at Jeruſalem; whereas Gabinius eſtabliſhed five at five different cities. Laſtly, it is certain that this ſenate was in being in the time of Jeſus Chriſt; but the Jews themſelves inform us that they had no longer then the power of life and death (John xviii. 31. )</p></div></body></text></TEI>
