<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">History.—</span><span class="font1">Its situation on the,Roman way from the Kentish ports to London, as well as its strategical position on the bend of the river&nbsp;Medway, gave Rochester (Durobrivae, Hrofescester or Hrobicester,&nbsp;Roffa) an early importance. It was a walled Romano-British town&nbsp;(though of no great size), and the original bridge across the Medway&nbsp;probably dated from that period. The church of St Andrew was&nbsp;founded by King Æthelbert, who also ,made Rochester a bishop’s&nbsp;see. Rochester was a royal borough in the time, of William I.,&nbsp;who raised a castle here, probably on Boley Hill. Richard I.&nbsp;granted the citizens quittance of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">passagium</span><span class="font1"> from crusaders in the&nbsp;town of Rochester. In 1227 Henry </span><span class="font0">111. </span><span class="font1">granted them the city&nbsp;at a fee farm rent of £25; he also ,granted them a gild merchant,&nbsp;the right to be impleaded only within the city walls, and other&nbsp;liberties. These charters were confirmed by subsequent sovereigns&nbsp;down to Henry VI., who in 1446 incorporated the city by the title&nbsp;of the bailiff and citizens, and granted them the power of admiralty&nbsp;and many privileges. Edward IV. by his charter of 1461 altered&nbsp;the style of incorporation to the mayor and citizens. Charters&nbsp;were granted in successive reigns down to Charles I., whose charter&nbsp;of 1629 remained the governing charter until 1835. A fair on&nbsp;the 18th, 19th and 20th of May was granted to the citizens by&nbsp;Henry Vf., and another fair was formerly held in December by&nbsp;prescription. At the present time fairs are held on the 18th of&nbsp;May and the 26th, 27th and 28th of August. A <sup>11</sup> formarket ” was&nbsp;granted in the second charter of Henry Iff.; the market days were&nbsp;formerly Tuesday and Friday. Corn and cattle markets are now&nbsp;held on Tuesday.</span></p>
