<p><span class="font0">REHER, a town and district of Hindustan, in the province of Delhi. The town has much declined in consequence of&nbsp;the seat of government having been removed to Nijibabad.&nbsp;It is eighty miles north-north-west from Bareily. Long.&nbsp;104. 35. E. Lat. 57. N. The district is situated between&nbsp;the twenty-eighth and twenty-ninth degrees of north latitude. It formerly constituted the northern limit of Kut-taher or Rohilcund, and was ceded to the British by the&nbsp;nabob of Oude in the year 1801. Both town and district&nbsp;are now included in the collectorship of Bareily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">REICHENBACH, one of the three provincial governments of Pmssia, into which the province of Silesia is divided. It is composed of the southern part of the ancient lower Silesia, with the addition of the principality of Mun-Sterberg and the county of Glatz. It is bounded on the&nbsp;north-east by Breslau, on the north-west by Leignitz, on&nbsp;the south-east by Oppeln and the Austrian province of Moravia, and on the south-west by Bohemia. In extent it&nbsp;is 2640 square miles, comprehending thirty-six cities and&nbsp;towns, and 905 villages, besides many hamlets. The population, according to the census of 1817, was 644,025,&nbsp;and had increased, at the enumeration of 1826, to 713,936,&nbsp;of which the Catholics and the Protestants were nearly equal&nbsp;in number. Divided into thirteen circles, it is the most&nbsp;densely peopled of any portion of the kingdom of Pmssia,&nbsp;and the great district in which was carried on that large&nbsp;manufacture of linen for which Silesia was long celebrated.&nbsp;It is generally a hilly, and in some parts a mountainous district ; and the soil, not being of great fertility, scarcely produces sufficient com for the consumption of the inhabitants.&nbsp;The capital is the city of the same name, and stands on the&nbsp;river Peilau. It is surrounded with double walls and ditches,&nbsp;and contains two Catholic and three Lutheran churches, 460&nbsp;houses, with 4350 inhabitants. It has considerable manufactories of linens and woollens, and some of cottons, besides several breweries and distilleries. Long. 16. 31. 7. E.&nbsp;Lat. 50. 59. 15. N.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">REICHENBERG, a city of the Austrian kingdom of Bohemia, in the circle of Buntzlau. It is situated on the&nbsp;river Neisse, and has a cathedral church, a palace, and 1200&nbsp;houses, inhabited by between thirteen and fourteen thousand persons, occupied in various branches of manufacture,&nbsp;but chiefly woollen cloth, for which it forms the chief market in an extensive district.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">REID, Dr Thomas, a distinguished philosopher, and in some measure the founder of a school, was the son of Lewis&nbsp;Reid, minister of the parish of Strachan, in the county of&nbsp;Kincardine, Scotland. His mother, the daughter of Mr&nbsp;Gregory of Kinnairdie, in Banffshire, was one of twenty-nine children, and sister to David, James, and Charles Gregory, who were at the same period professors of astronomy&nbsp;or mathematics in the universities of Oxford, Edinburgh,&nbsp;and St Andrews.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Dr Reid was born at the parsonage-house of Strachan in April 1710, and received the elementary parts of his&nbsp;education at the parish-school of Kincardine O’Neil. The&nbsp;parochial schools of Scotland are said to have been much&nbsp;superior at that period to what they are at present, and&nbsp;young men went from them well furnished with philological learning to the different universities. The early progress of young Reid must have been very extraordinary,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">VOL. xιx.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">since he was qualified to profit by the lectures of the professors at the age of twelve. He soon gave very striking' proofs that he inherited the genius of his mother’s family,&nbsp;and was conspicuous amongst the students of mathematics,&nbsp;in a college where that science has always been cultivated&nbsp;with zeal and success. He continued longer at the university than the usual term of years, having been appointed&nbsp;to the office of librarian, a situation which was every way&nbsp;agreeable to him, as it gave him ample opportunities of gratifying his passion for study. About this time he became&nbsp;intimately attached to John Stewart, afterwards professor of&nbsp;mathematics in Marischal College, a connection which greatly strengthened his predilection for mathematical studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">He resigned the office of librarian in the year 1736, and accompanied Mr Stewart to England, when they paid a&nbsp;visit to London, Oxford, and Cambridge, and were introduced to several persons of the first literary distinction. On&nbsp;account of his relation to Dr David Gregory, he had ready&nbsp;access to the celebrated Martin Folkes, whose house might&nbsp;be said to contain many of the most interesting objects to&nbsp;be met with in the metropolis. He saw Dr Bentley at&nbsp;Cambridge, with whose erudition he was much delighted,&nbsp;as well as amused with his vanity ; and he also conversed&nbsp;frequently with Saunderson, the blind mathematician. Dr&nbsp;Reid in his philosophical speculations refers to this gentleman’s blindness, as a singular phenomenon in the history of&nbsp;the human mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Dr Reid maintained an uninterrupted friendship with the learned and amiable Mr Stewart until the year 1766, at&nbsp;which time the latter was carried off by a malignant fever.&nbsp;The circumstances attending the death of this excellent&nbsp;man deeply wounded the sensibility of Dr Reid ; for his&nbsp;wife and daughter were carried ofl' by the same disorder,&nbsp;and buried with him in the same grave.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The King’s College of Aberdeen presented Dr Reid to the living of New Machar in the year 1737 ; but such was the&nbsp;zeal of the people against the law of patronage at that time,&nbsp;that he not only met with violent opposition, but was also&nbsp;exposed to personal danger. But his attention to the duties of his office was so exemplary, his temper so mild and&nbsp;forbearing, and his spirit of humanity so active, that in a&nbsp;short time he subdued their prejudices ; and when at last&nbsp;called in the course of Providence to a different situation,&nbsp;the very people who had been guilty of gross and indecent&nbsp;outrages against him followed him, on his departure, with&nbsp;their benedictions and tears.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the year 1740, he married Elizabeth, daughter of his uncle, Dr George Reid, physician in London, after which his&nbsp;popularity at New Machar very much increased. Her manners were so accommodating, and so numerous were her&nbsp;kind offices to the sick and the indigent, that the departure&nbsp;of the family from the neighbourhood was looked upon as&nbsp;a general misfortune. The manner in which several old&nbsp;men were accustomed to speak upon the subject is worthy&nbsp;of being kept in remembrance. “ We fought,” said they,&nbsp;“ against Dr Reid when he came, and we would have fought&nbsp;for him when he went away.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The greater part of his time during his residence at New Machar was devoted to the most intense study, particularly&nbsp;directing his attention to the laws of external perception,&nbsp;and of the other principles which constitute the basis of human knowledge. He unbended his mind by the amusements of gardening and botany, of which he was extremely&nbsp;fond, even in old age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The professors of King’s College, in the year 1752, made choice of Dr Reid to be professor of philosophy, originating wholly from the high opinion they were led to entertain of his talents and erudition. We are not acquainted&nbsp;with the particular plan which he adopted and pursued in&nbsp;the course of his lectures ; but his department at that period comprehended mathematics and physic, logic and</span></p><h1><a name="caption1"></a><span class="font2">o</span></h1><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
