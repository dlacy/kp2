He was adopted from the old French story of Huon de Bordeaux, just as the Oberon of the latter had his origin in the Elberich of the Heldenhuch. The original composition of Pereeforest has been assigned without reason to the 13th century, and it is possible that some insignificant portion of the romance may have been written in the 14th ; but the probability is that David Aubert was the real author of the extant work, and that he wrote it at the court of Burgundy about 1450. It would be difficult to imagine a work more absurd, heterogeneous, and wearying in its immensity than this. The very “variety” for which Dunlop praises it merely indicates the mass of multifarious and incongruous incidents, unconnected and uninteresting, of which it is full. Antiquaries, however, find it useful for the history of those knightly sports called tournaments, immense numbers of which are described in minute detail. Arthur of Little Britain must have been considered a very interesting romance when Lord Berners translated it into English, but we cannot discover its attractiveness. It is a dull inartistic composition, with scarcely any distinctiveness in the drawing of its personages.</p><p>A great number of poetic and prose compositions, beginning with chansons and fabliaux in the 12th and 13th centuries, form a large portion of the literature of Arthurian romance ; but in most instances they deal only with episodes, and are better described in the articles relating to the literature to which they belong than they could be, or ought to be, here. Some of them may, however, be mentioned briefly in chronological succession. In the 12th century —that is, between 1170 and 1200—Arnaud Daniel the troubadour wrote a poem, now quite lost, on Lancelot and Guinevere ; Chrestien de Troyes the trouvère wrote one entitled the Charrette, i.e., in reference to Lancelot’s unknightly mode upon one occasion of hurrying to the rescue of Guinevere in a cart for want of a horse ; this story was continued by Godefroi de Leigni. Chrestien wrote another poem on (Peredur) Perceval, which was continued by three other hands, in which Perceval remains the achiever of the Grail-quest. He also wrote Eree et Enide, a poem which contains the same substance as the Welsh story of Geraint in the Mabinogion, and which never appeared in any of the Arthurian romances ; and the Chevalier au Lyon, which is similarly identical with the Lady of the Fountain in the Mabinogion. Owen or Ywain, the Chevalier au Lyon, is a prominent Round Table knight in the romances, but his story is not incorporated in them. Hartmann von der Aue translated Chrestien’s poem into German verse before 1200 ; in English it appeared as Twain and Gawain in the 14th century ; another English poem, ∕S⅛'r Gawaine and the Green Knight, was written about 1360, as well as a Scottish Golagrus and Gawaine, in the 14th century. A poem, dated 1212, containing Le Roman de Joseph JA∣imathix, has been published by Francisque Michel, and is supposed by many to be Robert de Borron’s original work. Its substance is the same as the first part of the prose Petit Graal, which Hucher has published as Borron’s real original. About the same time, or a few years earlier, Ulrich von Zatzikhoven translated Arnaud Daniel’s Lancelot into German verse ; the lost Perceval in verse of Guyot de Provins and Wolfram von Eschenbach’s metrical German version of it (in which he miscalls the trouvère “ Kiot der Provenzal ”) have already been mentioned. There is an early German poem called Wigalois, composed by Wirnt of Grafenberg (i.c., Gui, son of Gawain), evidently derived soon after 1200 from a French original, Gui Galeis or Giglan, which is lost. On Gawain himself there are two French poems by Raoul and Renault or Raoul de Beaujeu, of the 13th century ; and one of Chrestien de Troyes’s chansons (before 1200) celebrates Cliges, a nephew of Gawain. A French poem on Merlin dates from about 1300. There is a Petit Tristan or Brun de la Montagne, written in verse in the 14th century. The French poems of Marie de France, written in England early in the 13th century, contain lays of Lanνal and of Chevrc-feuille (on Tristan), which are professedly Arthurian subjects. Of the English works on the Round Table romances the chief are the metrical History of the Grail, translated early in the 15th century by Henry Lonelich, and published from a MS. by ’the Roxburghe Club, and Sir Thomas Malory’s Morte Arthur. An English prose romance of Merlin was written about 1450, and a metrical Arthour and Merlin is probably fifty or sixty years older. A further Life of Arthur in English verse is supposed to have been composed about 1428. There is a metrical version of Renault de Beaujeu’s Giglan, probably of the latter part of the 14th century. Two poems both entitled Morte Arthur exist, one written about 1390, which especially treats of King Arthur, and another belonging to the middle of the 15th century, of which the story of Lancelot is the subject-matter ; and there is a Scottish Lancelot of the Laik in verse, which was composed late in that century. A romance of the Seint Graal, in verse, written about 1350, was probably a translation of Robert de Borron’s Joseph d'Arirnathix. Between 1838 and 1849 Lady Charlotte</p><p>Guest printed and translated the Mabinogion (Children’s Stories) from the Welsh MS. known as the Llyfr Coeh o Hergest, transcribed late in the 14th century, and now preserved at Oxford, in the library of Jesus College. At first it was believed that these stories, so far as they agreed with the narratives of the printed French romances, were copies of the original legends used by Walter Map and the Borrons ; but there can be little doubt that only those portions which are not found in the romances are of independent Celtic or Cambrian origin, while the remainder was derived from the French stories or poems of the 13th and 14th centuries.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Bibliographical List of Earliest Editions of chief Round Table Romances.—</hi><hi rend="italic">Ραrlzifαl und Τiturel,</hi>  in German verse, 2 vols, fol., 1477.
