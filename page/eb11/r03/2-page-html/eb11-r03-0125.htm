            <p><span class="font1">consisted of a mantle, surcoat and hood. The robes of the Garter
                    were originally of blue woollen stuff, the surcoat and&nbsp;hood being powdered
                    with garters embroidered in silk and&nbsp;gold. In the time of Henry VI. the
                    mantle was first made of&nbsp;velvet, and between the time of Elizabeth and of
                    Charles I. it&nbsp;seems to have been sometimes purple in colour. The
                    surcoat&nbsp;varied in colour from year to year; in the reign of the
                    founder&nbsp;alone, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
                    >e.g.,</span><span class="font1"> it was first blue, then black (possibly as a
                    sign of&nbsp;mourning for the plague), then “ sanguine in grain.” The
                    hood&nbsp;was made of the same material as the surcoat, and when hats&nbsp;began
                    to be worn, was carried hanging over the shouIder. The&nbsp;number of garters
                    embroidered on the surcoat and hood came&nbsp;to be fixed by rank, but after
                    Henry VI. the surcoat seems to&nbsp;have been made of plain velvet. Robes were
                    sometimes granted&nbsp;to ladies in the early days (see Beltz, p. ccxxi., for a
                    list of those&nbsp;ladies), in which case the robe and hood were of the colour
                    of&nbsp;the surcoat worn by the knights that year, and powdered
                    with&nbsp;garters. The last lady to receive the robes was
                    Margaret,&nbsp;countess of Richmond, in 1488. At the present day the
                    mantle&nbsp;is of dark blue velvet, of the same colour as the rihbon,
                    lined&nbsp;with this taffeta, and with the star embroidered on the
                    left&nbsp;shoulder, the hood and surcoat of crimson velvet lined with&nbsp;white
                    taffeta, and with these are worn a doublet and trunk-hose of white satin and a
                    plumed hat (see Lawrence-Archer,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1"

                    coronation of Henry IV. were green with furred hoods, and a&nbsp;white silk cord
                    hanging from the left shoulder.@@3 In the various&nbsp;accounts of later creations
                    of knights of the Bath quoted by&nbsp;Anstis, the costume worn before the
                    ceremonial bath seems to&nbsp;have been a priest-like garment of russet or grey,
                    with a girdle&nbsp;and hood; after the bath, was put on a red surcoat and
                    mantle,&nbsp;the latter with a lace of white silk, from which hung a pair
                    of&nbsp;white gloves; and the final costume was a blue (later a
                    purple)&nbsp;velvet or satin gown, with hood furred with miniver (later
                    lined&nbsp;with sarcenet), and the white cord hanging from the
                    shoulder,&nbsp;until it should be removed by the sovereign or a lady for
                    some&nbsp;deed of valour. The mantle in the present day is of
                    crimson&nbsp;velvet lined with white over a white satin under-coat
                    and&nbsp;trunk-hose, and a plumed hat and white boots with red tops&nbsp;are
                    worn. The mantle of the Thistle is of dark green velvet&nbsp;over surcoat,
                    &amp;c., of cloth of silver; that of St Patrick azure,&nbsp;with doublet and
                    trunk-hose of white satin; that of St&nbsp;Michael and St George of Saxon blue
                    satin lined with scarlet;&nbsp;and that of the Star of India of light blue satin
                    lined with&nbsp;white.</span></p>

                    Robes.—</span><span class="font1">It is frequently stated that judicial robes
                    had their origin in the dress of ecclesiastics.&nbsp;But though ecclesiastics in
                    early days frequently acted as&nbsp;judges, and though, as Fortescue says, the
                    serjeant’s long&nbsp;robe was “ ad instar sacerdotis,” judicial robes more
                    probably&nbsp;arose from the ordinary civilian dress of the early 14th
                    century.&nbsp;The chief argument for the ecclesiastical origin has been
                    found&nbsp;in the coif </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"

                    at&nbsp;their creation are decked,” which is said to have been used
                    by&nbsp;ecclesiastics to hide the tonsure when in court. This view
                    is&nbsp;disposed of by Pulling </span><span class="font1"

                    in&nbsp;the 13th century, which survived as the distinguishing mark&nbsp;of men
