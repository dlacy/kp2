<p><span class="font2">Britain. Rio Tinto was probably first exploited by the Carthaginians; vestiges of later Roman workings may still be seen. After the Moorish conquest, in 711, it was neglected until 1725,&nbsp;when the mines were leased to a Swede named Wolters. Their&nbsp;modern importance dates from 1S72, when a syndicate of London&nbsp;and Bremen capitalists purchased them from the Spanish&nbsp;government for nearly £4,000,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RIOU, EDWARD (1758 ?-i8oi), British sailor, entered the navy at an early age. In 1780 he was promoted lieutenant,&nbsp;and nine years later he was in command of the “ Guardian ” when&nbsp;that vessel, crowded with convicts, struck a hidden rock off the&nbsp;African coast. Riou, after parting with as many of his men as&nbsp;the boats would hold, not only successfully navigated his halfsinking ship 400 leagues to the Cape of Good Hope, but&nbsp;kept order amongst the panic-stricken convicts, an achievement&nbsp;which had few parallels in naval annals, and won Lieutenant&nbsp;Riou’s immediate promotion. He did not long remain a commander and in 1791 he was posted. Under Sir John Jervis he&nbsp;was present at the operations about Alartinique and Guadeloupe&nbsp;in 1794, andin the “Amazon” he accompanied the expedition under&nbsp;Sir Hyde Parker to the Baltic in 1801. His frigate led the way&nbsp;through the Channel at Copenhagen, and in the battle he was&nbsp;attached as commodore of a light squadron to Nelson’s division.&nbsp;Through the grounding of three ships of the line, Riou and his&nbsp;frigates found themselves opposed to the full force of the great&nbsp;Trekroner battery. Early in the fight he was wounded, but refused&nbsp;to leave the deck, and, as he was sitting on a gun-carriage and&nbsp;directing his men’s fire, he was cut in two by a cannon ball.&nbsp;Nelson, who had not known him before this expedition, had&nbsp;conceived a great affection for Riou, and spoke of his loss as&nbsp;“ irreparable.” Brenton, the naval historian, declared that he&nbsp;had all the qualities of a perfect officer. Parliament commemorated the memory of the “ gallant good Riou ” by a&nbsp;memorial in St-Paul’s Cathedral.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RIOUW, </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rhiouw</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bintang,</span><span class="font2"> an archipelago of the Dutch East Indies, E. of Sumatra,'and separated from the Alalay&nbsp;Peninsula by the Straits of Singapore. With the Lingga,&nbsp;Karimon, Tambelan, Anambas and Natuna Islands, to the N.E.,&nbsp;E. and S., and the territory of Indragiri in Sumatra, it forms the&nbsp;Dutch residency of Riouw and dependencies. The seat of&nbsp;government is at Tanjong Pinang, a small port of 40Ô0 inhabitants (including 160 Europeans and about 2000 Chinese), on the&nbsp;S.W. coast of the chief island, Bintang or Riouw. The total area&nbsp;of the residency is about 17,550 sq. m., and its population (1905)&nbsp;112,216, of whom considerably over a quarter are Chinese.&nbsp;These cultivate gambicr and pepper successfully in Bintang, and&nbsp;there is a considerable trade in wood. Bintang has an area of&nbsp;about 440 sq m., and is surrounded by many rocks and small&nbsp;islands, making navigation dangerous. The soil is not fertile,&nbsp;and much of it is swampy. There is an assistant residency of&nbsp;Lingga, to which belongs the island of Singkep, where extensive&nbsp;tin-deposits are worked. Geologically the Riouw and Lingga&nbsp;Islands are appendages of the Malay Peninsula, not of Sumatra.&nbsp;Bintang is mentioned by AIarco Polo under the name of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pentam,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">which is not far from the genuine Malay name </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bentän,</span><span class="font2"> said to&nbsp;mean a half-moon. After the Portuguese conquest of AIalacca&nbsp;(1511), the expelled Alahommedan dynasty took up its residence&nbsp;on Bintang, where it long fostered piracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RIPLEY, GEORGE (1802-1880), American critic and man of letters, was bom at Greenfield, Massachusetts, on the 3rd of&nbsp;October 1802. He graduated first in his class at Harvard in&nbsp;1823. From 1826 to 1840 he was pastor of a Unitarian church&nbsp;in Boston, subsequently retiring from the active ministry altogether. It was during those years that there grew up in New&nbsp;England that form of thought or philosophy known as Transcendentalism. Ripley was prominent, if not the leader, in all&nbsp;practical manifestations of the movement; and it was largely&nbsp;by his earnestness and practical energy that certain of its more&nbsp;tangible results were brought about. The first meeting of the&nbsp;Transcendental Club was held at his house in September 1836.&nbsp;He was a founder and a chief supporter of the magazine, the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Diol,</span><span class="font2"> which was the organ of the school from 1841 to 1844. AIost&nbsp;important of all, however, he was the originator of “ The Brook&nbsp;Farm Institute of Education and Agriculture.” Until the&nbsp;abandonment of this experiment in 1847, Riplcy was its leader,&nbsp;cheerfully taking upon himself all kinds of tasks, teaching&nbsp;mathematics and philosophy in the school, milking cows and&nbsp;attending to other bucolic duties, and after June 1845 editing&nbsp;the weekly </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Harbinger,</span><span class="font2"> an organ of “ association,” which he&nbsp;continued to edit in New York from 1847 until it was discontinued in 1849. The failure of Brook Farm </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.)</span><span class="font2"> left Ripley&nbsp;poor and feeling keenly the defeat of his project; but the event&nbsp;forced him at last to devote himself to that career of literary labour&nbsp;in which the real success of his life was achieved. In 1849 he&nbsp;joined the staff of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">New York Tribune,</span><span class="font2"> and in a short time&nbsp;became its literary editor. This position, which, through his&nbsp;steadiness, scholarly conservatism and freedom from caprice&nbsp;as a critic, soon became one of great influence, he held until his&nbsp;death in New York Cityon the 4th of July 1880.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During the greater part of the time of his connexion with the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tribune,</span><span class="font2"> Ripley was also an adviser of a prominent publishing&nbsp;house, an occasional contributor to the magazines, and a co-operator in several literary undertakings. The chief of these&nbsp;was the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">American Cyclopaedia,</span><span class="font2"> which as the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">New American&nbsp;Cyclopaedia</span><span class="font2">—so named to distinguish it from Francis Lieber’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopaedia Americana—was</span><span class="font2"> issued, under the editorship of&nbsp;Ripley and Charles A. Dana, in 1857-63, a revised edition, with&nbsp;the word “ new ” dropped from the title, being issued under the&nbsp;same editorship in 1873-76. He also issued, in translation, a&nbsp;series of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Specimens of Foreign Standard Literature</span><span class="font2"> (14 vols.,&nbsp;1838-42). Ripley was twice married, first in 1827 to AIiss&nbsp;Sophia Willard Dana (d. 1861), a daughter of Francis Dana&nbsp;and a conspicuous figure at Brook Farm; and second, in&nbsp;1865, to a young German widow, Alrs Augusta Schloss-berger, who survived him and subsequently married Alphonse&nbsp;Pinede.</span></p>

The Robinson family was&nbsp;descended from an eminent Hamburg merchant, William&nbsp;Robinson (1522-1616), who represented York in parliament&nbsp;in Elizabeth’s reign. His great-grandson was in 1660 created&nbsp;a baronet. Thomas Robinson, ist Baron Grantham (1695-1770), son of a later holder of the baronetcy, was created a&nbsp;peer in 1761, having been an indefatigable diplomatist plenipotentiary at the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, and secretary of&nbsp;state. The 2nd. Baron Grantham (1738-1786), ambassador&nbsp;at Aladrid, and foreign secretary under Lord Shelburne, had&nbsp;two sons. The elder of these, succeeding as 3rd Baron&nbsp;Grantham (1781-1859), became in 1833 2nd Earl dc Grey,&nbsp;in right of his maternal aunt, and assumed the surname of dc&nbsp;Grey; he was lord-lieu tenant of Ireland (1841-44). The&nbsp;younger, Frederick John (1782-1859), created Viscount Goderich in 1827 and earl of Ripon in 1833, was the well-known&nbsp;“ Prosperity Robinson ” who was chancellor of the exchequer&nbsp;from 1823 to 1827; as Lord Goderich he became prime&nbsp;minister (and a peculiarly weak one) from August 1827 to&nbsp;January 1828, colonial secretary in 1831 and 1832, lord privy</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
