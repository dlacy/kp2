Thomas, the author of that w'ell-known and important work the <hi rend="italic">Fadera,</hi> was born in the north of England, and educated at the grammar-school of Northallerton. He was admitted a scholar at Cambridge, then became a member of Gray’s Inn, and at length was appointed historiographer to King William in place of Mr Shadwell.

For a critic he was certainly not well qualified, for he wanted candour ; nor is his judgment much to be relied on, who could condemn Shakspeare with such rigid severity.

The whole were reprinted at the Hague in ten vols., 1739. They were abridged by Rapin in French, and inserted in Le Clerc’s <hi rend="italic">Bibliothèque,</hi> a translation of which was made by Stephen Whatley, and printed in four vols. 8vo, 1731. Rymer died on the Hth of December 1713, and was buried in the parish church of St Clement Danes. Some specimens of his poetry are preserved in the first volume of Mr Nichol's Select Collection Of Miscellaneous Poems, 1780.</p>
