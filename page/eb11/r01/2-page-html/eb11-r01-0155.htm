<p><span class="font1">RATRAMNUS (d. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">c.</span><span class="font1"> 868), a theological controversialist of the second half of the 9th century, was a monk of the Benedictine&nbsp;abbey of Corbie near Amiens, but beyond this fact very little&nbsp;of his history has been preserved. He is best known by his&nbsp;treatise on the Eucharist </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(De corpore et sanguine Domini liber),&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">in which he controverted the doctrine of transubstantiation&nbsp;as taught in a similar work by his contemporary Radbcrtus&nbsp;Paschasius. Ratramnus sought in a way to reconcile science&nbsp;and religion, whereas Radbertus emphasized the miraculous.&nbsp;Ratramnus’s views failed to find acceptance; their author was&nbsp;soon forgotten, and, when the book was condemned at the&nbsp;synod of Vercelli in 1050, it was described as having been&nbsp;written by Johannes Scotus Erigena at the command of Charle-magne. In the Reformation it again saw the light; it was&nbsp;published in 1532 and immediately translated. In the controversy about election, when appealed to by Charles the Bald,&nbsp;Ratramnus wrote two books </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">De praedestinatione Dei,</span><span class="font1"> in which&nbsp;he maintained the doctrine of a twofold predestination; nor&nbsp;did the fate of Gottschalk deter him from supporting his view&nbsp;against Hincmar as to the orthodoxy of the expression “ trina&nbsp;Deitas. ’’ Ratramnus perhaps won most glory in his own day&nbsp;by his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Contra Graecorum opposita,</span><span class="font1"> in four books (868), a valued&nbsp;contribution to the controversy between the Eastern and&nbsp;Western Churches which had been raised by the publication&nbsp;of the encyclical letter of Photius in 867. An edition of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">De&nbsp;corpore et sanguine Domini</span><span class="font1"> was published at Oxford in 1859.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RATTAZZI, URBANO (1808-1873), Italian statesman, was born on the 29th of June 1808 at Alessandria, and from 1838&nbsp;practised at the bar. In 1848 he was sent to the chamber of&nbsp;deputies in Turin as representative of his native town. By&nbsp;his debating powers he contributed to the defeat of the Balbo&nbsp;ministry, and for a short time held the portfolio of public instruction; afterwards, in the Gioberti cabinet, he became&nbsp;minister of the interior, and on the retirement of the last-named&nbsp;in 1849 he became practically the head of the government.&nbsp;The defeat at Novara compelled the resignation of Rattazzi&nbsp;in March 1849. His election as president of the chamber in&nbsp;1852 was one of the earliest results of the so-called “ connubio ”&nbsp;with Cavour, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i. e.</span><span class="font1"> the union of the moderate men of the Right&nbsp;and of the Left; and having become minister of justice in 1853&nbsp;he carried a number of measures of reform, including that for&nbsp;the suppression of certain of the monastic orders. During a&nbsp;momentary reaction of public opinion he resigned office in 1858,&nbsp;but again entered the cabinet under La Marmora in 1859 as&nbsp;minister of the interior. In consequence of the negotiations&nbsp;for the cession of Nice and Savoy he again retired in January&nbsp;i860. He was entrusted with the formation of a new ministry&nbsp;in March 1862, but in consequence of his policy of repression&nbsp;towards Garibaldi at Aspromonte he was driven from office&nbsp;in the following December. He was again prime minister in&nbsp;1867, from April to October. He died at Frosinone on the 5th&nbsp;of June 1873. His wife, whom he married in 1863, was a remarkable woman. She was the daughter of Sir Thomas Wyse, British&nbsp;plenipotentiary at Athens, and Laetitia Bonaparte, niece of&nbsp;Napoleon I. Born in Ireland in 1833, she was educated in Paris,&nbsp;and in 1848 married a rich Alsatian named Solms; but the prince-president refused to recognize her, and in 1852 she was expelled&nbsp;from Paris. Her husband died soon after; and calling herself the&nbsp;Princesse Marie de Solms, she spent her time in various fashionable places and dabbled in literature, Eugène Sue and François&nbsp;Ponsard being prominent in her court of admirers. She published </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Les Chants de l'exilée</span><span class="font1"> (1859) and some novels. After&nbsp;Rattazzi’s death, she married (1877) a Spaniard named Rute;&nbsp;she died in February 1902.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RATTLESNAKE. Rattlesnakes are a small group of the sub-family of pit-vipers </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Crotalinae,</span><span class="font1"> see Snakes; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Viperidae),&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">characterised by a tail which terminates in a chain of horny,&nbsp;loosely connected rings, the so-called “rattle.” The “pit’’&nbsp;by which the family is distinguished from the ordinary vipers&nbsp;is a deep depression in the integument of the sides of the snout,&nbsp;between the nostrils and the eye; its physiological function&nbsp;is unknown. The rattle is a complicated and highly specialized&nbsp;organ, developed from the simple conical scale or epidermal&nbsp;spine, which in the majority of snakes forms the termination&nbsp;of the general integument of the tail. The bone by which the&nbsp;root of the rattle is supported consists of the last caudal vcrte-brae, from three to eight in number, which are enlarged, dilated,&nbsp;compressed and coalesced (fig. 1, a). This bone is covered&nbsp;with thick and vascular cutis, transversely divided by two&nbsp;constrictions into three portions, of which the proximal is&nbsp;larger than the median, and the median much larger than the&nbsp;distal. This cuticular portion constitutes the matrix of a horny&nbsp;epidermoid covering which closely fits the shape of the underlying soft part and is the beginning of the rattle, as it appears&nbsp;in young rattlesnakes before they have shed their skin for the&nbsp;first time. When the period of a renewal of the skin approaches&nbsp;a new covering of the extremity of the tail is formed below&nbsp;the old one, but the latter, instead of being cast off with the&nbsp;remainder of the epidermis, is retained by the posterior swelling&nbsp;of the end of the tail, forming now the first loose joint of the&nbsp;rattle. This process is repeated on succeeding moultings—&nbsp;the new joints being always larger than the old ones as long as&nbsp;the snake grows. Perfect rattles therefore taper towards the&nbsp;point, but generally the oldest (terminal) joints wear away in&nbsp;time and are lost. As rattlesnakes shed their skins more than&nbsp;once every year, the number of joints of the rattle does not&nbsp;indicate the age of the animal but the number of exuviations&nbsp;which it has undergone. The largest rattle in the British&nbsp;Museum has twenty-one joints. The rattle consists thus of&nbsp;a variable number of dry, hard, homy cup-shaped joints,&nbsp;each of which loosely grasps a portion of the preceding, and all&nbsp;of which are capable of being shaken against each other. If the&nbsp;interspaces between the joints are filled with water, as often&nbsp;happens in wet weather, no noise can be produced. The motor&nbsp;power lies in the lateral muscles of the tail, by which a vibratory&nbsp;motion is communicated to the rattle, the noise produced being&nbsp;similar to that of a child’s rattle and perceptible at a distance&nbsp;of from 10 to 20 yds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The habit of agitating the tail is not peculiar to the rattlesnake, but has been observed in other venomous and innocuous snakes&nbsp;with the ordinary tail, under the influence of fear or anger. It&nbsp;is significant that the tip of such snakes is sometimes rather&nbsp;conspicuously coloured and covered with peculiarly modified</span></p><div style="border-right:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
