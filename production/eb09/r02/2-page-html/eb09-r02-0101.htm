<p><span class="font0">was made between the two kings, and Philip used the opportunity to separate Henry from his son. In November&nbsp;1188 Richard did homage to Philip for his French provinces, and the latter demanded that Henry should&nbsp;acknowledge him as heir. Henry hesitated, and Richard&nbsp;openly joined Philip. In the spring of 1189 the allies&nbsp;overran Maine and Touraine, and forced Henry, in a&nbsp;meeting at Colombières, to submit to their demands.&nbsp;Two days later Henry died at Chinon (July G, 1189), and&nbsp;Richard became king of England.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Richard’s reign falls into two equal divisions—the one comprising his crusade and captivity, the other his wars&nbsp;against Philip in France. On his father’s death he was&nbsp;at once acknowledged as duke of Normandy and count of&nbsp;Anjou. On September 3, 1189, he was crowned with great&nbsp;pomp at Westminster. This is the first English coronation of which we have a full account, and the formalities&nbsp;then adopted have been followed with little alteration&nbsp;ever since. Richard at once set to work to collect funds&nbsp;for the crusade. He sold ecclesiastical and temporal&nbsp;offices, released the king of Scotland from the vassalage to&nbsp;which Henry II. had subjected him ; and, having by these&nbsp;means and by taxation collected a large sum of money, he&nbsp;crossed to Calais on December 12. Soon afterwards he&nbsp;met Philip at St Remy and made a treaty with him for a&nbsp;joint crusade. On June 27, 1190, the two armies assembled&nbsp;at Vezelai, whence they marched together as far as Lyons.&nbsp;There Philip took the route to Genoa, while Richard went&nbsp;by Marseilles. Visiting Naples on the way, he landed at&nbsp;Messina on September 23, where he found the French&nbsp;army and his own fleet awaiting him. The two kings&nbsp;remained in Sicily during the winter. William IL, king&nbsp;of Sicily, husband of Richard’s sister Joanna, had died&nbsp;shortly before, and Tancred, nephew of William, had seized&nbsp;the throne. During the negotiations for the recovery of&nbsp;Joanna and her dowry, disturbances broke out which&nbsp;ended in Richard’s forcing his way into Messina at the&nbsp;head of his army. His real enemy was, however, not&nbsp;Tancred, but Philip. The natural jealousy of the two&nbsp;kings grew into mutual hatred during their stay in Sicily,&nbsp;and Tancred informed Richard of French intrigues. In&nbsp;March 1191 Richard made a treaty with Tancred, and&nbsp;recognized him as king of Sicily. At the same time he&nbsp;repudiated Alice, Philip’s sister, and betrothed himself to&nbsp;Berengaria of Navarre. Philip was the first to leave&nbsp;Sicily. He arrived at Acre early in April. On April 10&nbsp;Richard set sail, and a month later reached Cyprus, where&nbsp;he married Berengaria (May 12). He then proceeded to&nbsp;conquer Cyprus, took Isaac Comnenus and his daughter&nbsp;prisoners, and set out again for the Holy Land, reaching&nbsp;Acre on June 8. Guy of Lusignan, who claimed the&nbsp;throne of Jerusalem, had besieged that fortress since 1189,&nbsp;but the Christian army was itself hemmed in by the forces&nbsp;of Saladin. Richard’s arrival encouraged the besiegers,&nbsp;and on July 11 Acre surrendered. The two kings now&nbsp;settled the dispute between Guy of Lusignan and Conrad&nbsp;of Montferrat about the throne of Jerusalem and on&nbsp;August· 3 Philip left the Holy Land. Saladin having&nbsp;failed to fulfil the terms on which Acre had surrendered,&nbsp;Richard ordered the massacre in cold blood of some three&nbsp;thousand Mohammedan prisoners. Soon afterwards he&nbsp;set out for Jaffa, and on the way thither won the battle&nbsp;cf Arsuf. Having rebuilt Jaffa, he started for Jerusalem.&nbsp;About Christmas 1191 he arrived at Beit-nûba, within sight&nbsp;of the Holy City, but, owing to the reluctance or desertion&nbsp;of his French allies, he found it impossible to besiege it,&nbsp;and therefore withdrew to the coast. In April 1192, at&nbsp;the instance of his followers, he recognized Conrad as king&nbsp;of Jerusalem, indemnifying Guy with the crown of&nbsp;Cyprus. The murder of Conrad immediately afterwards&nbsp;was laid, probably without sufficient ground, to the charge&nbsp;of Richard, who conferred the vacant throne on Henry,&nbsp;count of Champagne. Bad news from England now&nbsp;made him anxious to go home, but he resolved on one&nbsp;more attempt to save Jerusalem. He set out on June 4,&nbsp;arrived again within sight of the city, and again retired&nbsp;without venturing to attack. Jaffa, which had been&nbsp;taken by Saladin, was retaken on August 1. This was&nbsp;Richard’s last exploit in the East. On September 1 he&nbsp;made a three years’ truce with Saladin, on the basis of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">status quo</span><span class="font0"> ; and on October 9 he sailed for home, leaving&nbsp;behind him a name long remembered by the Saracens,&nbsp;but, beyond the capture of Acre, having accomplished&nbsp;none of the objects with which he set out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Fearing to go through France, Richard sailed up the Adriatic, and made his way on foot, as a pilgrim and&nbsp;almost alone, to Erdburg near Vienna. Here he was discovered (December 21, 1192) by Leopold, duke of Austria,&nbsp;of whom, while at Ascalon, he had made a bitter enemy.&nbsp;After being confined for some time at Dürrenstein on the&nbsp;Danube, he was surrendered in March 1193 to the&nbsp;emperor Henry VI., who imprisoned him first at Trifels&nbsp;and afterwards at Worms. Legend was already rife about&nbsp;him, but the story of his discovery by Blondel only dates&nbsp;from the following century, and is of French origin. In&nbsp;order to liberate himself, Richard resigned his crown to&nbsp;Henry VI. as overlord of Christendom, promised to pay a&nbsp;yearly tribute, and received back the crown as a vassal of&nbsp;the emperor. At Easter a diet was held at Spires, at&nbsp;which Richard was charged with various misdoings,—the&nbsp;recognition of Tancred, the conquest of Cyprus, the&nbsp;murder of Conrad, even with the betrayal of the Holy&nbsp;Land to Saladin. He defended himself eloquently, and&nbsp;the charges were dropped. Shortly afterwards a treaty&nbsp;was made at Worms (July 29) for Richard’s release on&nbsp;payment of a ransom of 150,000 marks, with other conditions. Great efforts were made in England to collect the&nbsp;money, two-thirds of which was paid over to Henry,&nbsp;hostages being given for the rest. Philip and John were&nbsp;able, however, by offers of money and other means, to&nbsp;induce the emperor to detain Richard till the following&nbsp;spring. At length he was liberated. On March 13,&nbsp;1194, he set foot again in England. He found his&nbsp;dominions in great confusion owing to the intrigues of&nbsp;Philip and John. He rapidly made himself master of the&nbsp;castles which held out for John, and on April 17, 1194, he&nbsp;was crowned a second time. He then collected more&nbsp;money from the impoverished country for the rest of his&nbsp;ransom and for an expedition to France, and on May 12&nbsp;left England again never to return. Philip retired before&nbsp;him; John submitted and was pardoned. For the&nbsp;remaining five years of his reign Richard kept up an&nbsp;intermittent struggle with Philip, a struggle marked by no&nbsp;great battles, and interrupted only by fruitless negotiations&nbsp;and truces which were never kept. Neither party was&nbsp;strong enough to inflict a severe blow upon the other. In&nbsp;the autumn of 1198 the war went decidedly against Philip,&nbsp;but in January 1199 a peace for five years was made,&nbsp;each side retaining what it held. Shortly afterwards&nbsp;Richard, while besieging the castle of Chaluz near Limoges,&nbsp;which was held against him by one of his vassals, was&nbsp;wounded by an arrow. He died on April 6, 1199, and&nbsp;was buried at Fontevraud. His brother John succeeded&nbsp;him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In person Richard was tall, muscular, ruddy, with light brown hair. He was lavish, generous, and fearless ; a&nbsp;skilful commander, but incapable of extensive combinations or far-reaching plans ; more religious than his father&nbsp;or brothers, but equally vicious ; a bad husband and a bad&nbsp;son, with much of the ferocity that characterized his race ;</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
