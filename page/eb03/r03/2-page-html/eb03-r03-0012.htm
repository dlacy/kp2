<p><span class="font1"><sup>-</sup> while the perſon who has it is preſent ; but as ſoon as he is gone, they will return with redoubled vigour to the&nbsp;field and tear up every thing before them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The beſt remedy the farmer has is to watch well the time of the corn’s being in the condition in which they&nbsp;feed upon it ; and as this laſts only a few days, he&nbsp;ſhould keep a boy in conſtant pay to watch the field&nbsp;from day-break till the duſk of the evening. Every&nbsp;time they ſettle upon the ground to ſly over it, the boy&nbsp;is to holloa, and throw up a dead rook into the air :&nbsp;this will always make them riſe ; and by degrees they&nbsp;will be ſo tired of this conſtant diſturbance, that they&nbsp;will ſeek out other places of preying, and will leave the&nbsp;ground even before the time of the corn’s being unfit&nbsp;for them. The reaſon of their riling at the toſſing up&nbsp;of their dead fellow creature is, that they are a bird&nbsp;extremely apprehenſive of danger, and they are always&nbsp;alarmed when one of their comrades riſes. They take&nbsp;this for the riſing of an out-bird, and all fly off at the&nbsp;fignal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROOKE (Sir George), a gallant naval commander, born of an ancient and honourable family in Kent, in&nbsp;1650. His merit raiſed him by regular ſteps to be&nbsp;vice-admiral of the blue: in which ſtation he ſerved in&nbsp;the-battle of La Hogue, on the 22d of May 1692 ;&nbsp;when it was owing to his vigorous behaviour, that the&nbsp;laſt ſtroke was given on that important day, which threw&nbsp;the French entirely into confulion. But the next day&nbsp;he obtained ſtill more glory ; for he had orders to go&nbsp;into La Hogue, and burn the enemy’s ſhips as they&nbsp;lay there. There were 13 large men of war, which&nbsp;had crowded as far up as poſſible ; and the tranſports,&nbsp;tenders, and ammunition ſhips, were diſpoſed in ſuch a&nbsp;manner that it was thought impoſſible to burn them.&nbsp;Beſides, the French camp was in fight, with all the&nbsp;French and Iriſh troops that were to have been employed in the invaſion of England; and ſeveral batteries&nbsp;were raiſed on the coaſt, well provided with heavy artillery. The vice-admiral made the neceſſary preparations for obeying his orders, but found it impoſſible to&nbsp;carry in the ſhips of hisſtquadron : he therefore ordered his&nbsp;light 'frigates to ply in cjoſe to the ihore ; and having&nbsp;manned out all his boats, went himſelf to give directions for the attack, burnt that very night fix three-deck-ſhips, and the next day ſix more, from 76 to 60&nbsp;guns, together with moſt of the tranſports and ammunition veſſels ; and this under the fire of all the batteries&nbsp;iuſt mentioned, and in light of all the French and Iriſh&nbsp;troops : yet this bold action colt the lives of no more&nbsp;than ten men. The vice-admiral’s behaviour on this&nbsp;occaſſion appeared ſo great to King William, that having no opportunity at that time of promoting him, he&nbsp;fettled a penſion of 1000 l. per annum on him for life ;&nbsp;and afterwards going to Portſmouth to view the fleet,&nbsp;went on board Mr Rooke’s ſhip, dined with him, and&nbsp;then conferred on him the honour of knighthood, he&nbsp;having a little before made him vice-admiral of the&nbsp;red.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In conſequer.ce of other ſervices he was in 1694 raiſed to the rank of admiral of the blue : towards the cloſe of the next year, he was admiral of the white ;&nbsp;and was alſo appointed admiral and commander in chief&nbsp;in the Mediterranean.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">During King William’s reign, Sir George was twice elected member for Portſmouth ; and upon the acceſ-ſion of Queen Anne in 1702, he was conſtituted vice-admiral and lieutenant of the admiralty of England, as&nbsp;alſo lieutenant of the fleets and ſeas of this kingdom.<sub>&nbsp;</sub>Upon the declaration of war againſt France, he was&nbsp;ordered to command a fleet ſent againſt Cadiz, the&nbsp;duke of Ormond having the command of the land forces. On his paſſage home, receiving an account that&nbsp;the galleons, under the eſcort of a ſtrong French ſquadron, were got into the harbour of Vigo, he reſolved&nbsp;to attack them ; and on the 11th of October came before the harbour of Rondondello, where the French&nbsp;commander had neglected nothing neceſſary for putting&nbsp;the place into the beſt poſture of defence. But not-withſtanding this, a detachment of 15 Engliſh and 10&nbsp;Dutch men of war, of the line of battle, with all the&nbsp;fire-ſhips, were ordered in ; the frigates and bomb-veſſels followed ; the great ſhips moved after ahem, and&nbsp;the army landed near Rondondello. The whole ſervice&nbsp;was performed under Sir George’s directions, with admirable conduct and bravery; for, in ſhort, all the ſhips&nbsp;were deſtroyed or taken, prodigious damage done to the&nbsp;enemy, and vaſt wealth acquired by the allies. For&nbsp;this action Sir George received the thanks of the Houſe&nbsp;of Commons, a day of thankſgiving was appointed both&nbsp;by the queen and the ſtates-general, and Sir George&nbsp;was promoted to a ſeat in the privy-council ; yet, not-withſtanding this, the Houſe of Lords reſolved to inquire into his conduct at Cadiz. But he ſo fully juſtiſied himſelf, that a vote was paſſed, approving his behaviour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the ſpring of the year 1704, Sir George commanded the ſhips of war which convoyed King Cha. III. of Spain to Liſhon. In July, he attacked Gibraltar ;&nbsp;when, by the bravery of the Engliſh ſeamen, the place&nbsp;was taken on the 24th, though the town was extremely&nbsp;ſtrong, well furniſhed with ammunition, and had 100&nbsp;guns mounted, all facing the ſea and the narrow paſſes&nbsp;to the land: An action which was conceived and executed in leſs than a week ; though it has fince endured&nbsp;ſieges of many months continuance, and more than once&nbsp;baffled the united forces of France and Spain. This&nbsp;brave officer being at laſt obliged, by the prevalence of&nbsp;party-ſpirit, to quit the ſervice of his country, retired&nbsp;to his ſeat in Kent ; where he ſpent the remainder of&nbsp;his days as a private gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">He was thrice married ; and by his ſecond lady Mrs Luttrell left one ſon. He died January 24. 1708-9,&nbsp;in his 58th year, and was buried in Canterbury cathedral, where a monument is erected to his memory. In&nbsp;his private life he was a good huſhand and a kind maſter, lived hoſpitably towards his neighbours, and left&nbsp;behind him a moderate fortune; ſo moderate, that when&nbsp;he came to make his will, it ſurpriſed thoſe who were&nbsp;preſent : but Sir George aſſigned the reaſon in a few&nbsp;words, “ I do not leave much (ſaid he), but what I&nbsp;leave was honeſtly gotten ; it never coſt a ſailor a tear,&nbsp;or the nation a farthing.”</span></p>
