<p><span class="font0">potassium sulphate, enveloped in paper beneath a photographic plate. A weak photographic effect was obtained. This was&nbsp;shown to be due to a penetrating radiation capable of passing&nbsp;through sheets of matter opaque to ordinary light. Further&nbsp;investigation showed that this photographic action was ex-hibited by all compounds of uranium and by the metal itself,&nbsp;and had nothing to do with phosphorescence. It was shown&nbsp;equally if the uranium were kept in darkness and did not&nbsp;vary appreciably with time. Becquerel showed that the&nbsp;rays from uranium like X rays were capable of discharging&nbsp;a body whether positively or negatively electrified. A&nbsp;uranium compound brought close to the charged plate of a&nbsp;gold leaf electroscope causes a rapid collapse of the gold leaves.&nbsp;This property of uranium, and also of the radioactive bodies&nbsp;in general, has supplied a delicate and quantitative method&nbsp;of accurate comparison of the intensity of the radiations from&nbsp;substances under varying conditions. A modified form of&nbsp;gold leaf electroscope has come into general use for comparison&nbsp;of the radioactivity of substances. Rutherford (2) made a&nbsp;systematic examination of the discharging effect produced by&nbsp;the rays from uranium and showed that it was due to the pro-duction of charged carriers or ions in the volume of the gas&nbsp;through which the radiations pass. In an electric field, the&nbsp;positive ions travel to the negative electrode and vice versa,&nbsp;thus causing a discharge of the electrified body. If a suffi-ciently strong field is used, the ions are all swept to the electrodes&nbsp;before appreciable loss of their number can occur by recombination. The rate of discharge then reaches a steady maximum&nbsp;value which is not altered by a large increase in voltage. This&nbsp;maximum current through the gas is called the saturation&nbsp;current. The ions produced in gases by the rays from uranium&nbsp;and other radioactive substances are in general identical with&nbsp;those produced by X rays, and the mechanism of conductivity&nbsp;of the gas is very similar in both cases (see Conduction,&nbsp;Electric: § </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Through Gases</span><span class="font0">)</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Some time after Becquerel’s discovery, Mme Curie (3) made a systematic examination or the electric method of a large&nbsp;number of chemical elements and their compounds to test&nbsp;whether they possessed the “ radioactive ” property of uranium.&nbsp;Only one other element, thorium, was found to show this effect&nbsp;to a degree comparable with that of uranium—a result inde-pendently observed by Schmidt. Mme Curie examined the&nbsp;activity of the various compounds of uranium and found that&nbsp;their radioactivity was an atomic property, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i. e.</span><span class="font0"> the activity was&nbsp;proportional to the amount of the element uranium present,&nbsp;and was independent of its combination with other sub-stances. In testing the activity of the minerals containing&nbsp;uranium, Mme Curie found that the activity was always four&nbsp;to five times as great as that to be expected from their content&nbsp;of uranium. If the radioactivity were an atomic phenomenon,&nbsp;this could only be explained by the presence in these minerals&nbsp;of another substance more active than uranium itself. Relying&nbsp;on this hypothesis, Mme Curie made a chemical examination&nbsp;of uranium minerals in order to try to separate this new radio-active substance. In these experiments, the Austrian Government generously provided Mme Curie with a ton of the residues&nbsp;from the State manufactory of uranium at Joachimstahl,&nbsp;Bohemia. At that place there are extensive deposits of pitch-blende or uranite which are mined for the uranium. After&nbsp;separation of the latter, the residues are three to five times as&nbsp;radioactive weight for weight as the uranium. From this&nbsp;residue Mme Curie separated a substance far more radio-active than uranium, which she called polonium in honour of&nbsp;the country of her birth. This substance is usually separated&nbsp;with bismuth in the mineral, but by special methods can be&nbsp;partly separated from it. A further examination revealed the&nbsp;presence of a second radioactive substance which is normally&nbsp;separated with the barium, to which the name “ radium ”&nbsp;was given. This name was happily chosen, for in the pure&nbsp;state radium bromide has a very great activity—about two&nbsp;million times as great as an equal weight of uranium. By&nbsp;means of successive fractionations of the chloride, the radium&nbsp;was gradually concentrated, until finally the radium was&nbsp;obtained so that the barium lines showed very faintly. The&nbsp;atomic weight was found by Mme Curie to be 225. In a&nbsp;recent redetermination, using a larger quantity of 0∙4 grams of&nbsp;pure radium chloride, Mme Curie (4) found the atomic weight&nbsp;to be 226∙2. Thorpe (5) using a smaller quantity obtained a&nbsp;value 227. The spectrum of the purified sample of radium&nbsp;chloride obtained by Mme Curie was first examined by&nbsp;Demarçay. It was found to have a characteristic spark&nbsp;spectrum of bright lines analogous in many respects to the&nbsp;spectra of the alkaline earths. Giesel (6) found that pure&nbsp;radium bromide gives a brilliant carmine colour to the bunsen&nbsp;flame. The flame spectrum shows two broad bright bands in&nbsp;the orange-red. There is also a line in the blue-green and two&nbsp;weak lines in the violet. Giesel (7) has taken an active part in&nbsp;the preparation of pure radium compounds, and was the first&nbsp;to place preparations of pure radium bromide on the market.&nbsp;He found that the separation of radium from the barium mixed&nbsp;with it proceeded much more rapidly if the crystallizations&nbsp;were carried out using thebromide instead of the chloride.&nbsp;He states that six to eight crystallizations are sufficient for an&nbsp;almost complete separation. From the chemical point of view&nbsp;radium possesses all the characteristic properties of a new&nbsp;element. It has a definite atomic weight, a well-marked and&nbsp;characteristic spectrum, and distinct chemical properties.&nbsp;Its comparative ease of separation and great activity has&nbsp;attracted much attention to this substance, although we shall&nbsp;see that very similar radioactive properties are possessed by a&nbsp;large number of distinct substances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Radium emits three distinct types of radiation, known as the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">α</span><span class="font0">, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ß</span><span class="font0"> and γ rays, of which an account will be given later. It&nbsp;produces in addition a radioactive emanation or gas which is&nbsp;about 100,000 times as active weight for weight as radium&nbsp;itself. The emanation released from 10 milligrams of pure&nbsp;radium bromide causes a glass tube into which it is introduced&nbsp;to phosphoresce brightly. A brilliant luminosity is produced&nbsp;in phosphorescent substances like zinc sulphide, willemite and&nbsp;barium platino-cyanide when introduced into a tube containing&nbsp;the emanation. The radium emanation, a more detailed account&nbsp;of which will be given later, has proved of the greatest utility&nbsp;in radioactive experiments. The property of radium of pro-ducing the emanation has been utilized as a very delicate and&nbsp;certain method, not only of detection but of estimation of small&nbsp;quantities of radium. This “ emanation method ” depends&nbsp;upon the introduction of the emanation, liberated from a substance by boiling or heating, into a suitable electroscope. The&nbsp;rate of discharge of the electroscope due to the emanation affords&nbsp;a quantitative measure of the amount of radium present. In&nbsp;this way, it is not difficult to determine with certainty the</span></p>
