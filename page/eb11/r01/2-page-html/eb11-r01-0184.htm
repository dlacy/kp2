<p><span class="font1">The two principal forms of rebab with which we are concerned as prototypes of European instruments of the middle ages are:&nbsp;(1) the long and narrow boat-shaped rebab, which may be traced&nbsp;back to Persia in the 8th century b.c., and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">is</span><span class="font1"> still in use in that&nbsp;country; and (2) the lute-shaped rebab, with rudimentary neck&nbsp;consisting of the gradual narrowing of the body, which has the&nbsp;outline of a longitudinal section of a pear. This variety became&nbsp;very popular in medieval Europe under the names of rebec, gigue,&nbsp;geige and lyra; the archetype has been traced back to 1000 b.c.&nbsp;The most characteristic feature in the construction of the rebab,&nbsp;and of all instruments derived from it, was the body, composed&nbsp;of a back originally scooped out of a solid piece of wood, to which&nbsp;was glued without the intermediary of ribs (an important structural feature of the violin) a flat sound-board of parchment or thin&nbsp;wood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rebab-esh-sha’er,</span><span class="font1"> or “ poet’s rebab,” had a body consisting of an almost rectangular box covered with parchment and supported on an iron foot; the instrument was held like the modern&nbsp;violoncello. No evidence has yet been brought forward that the&nbsp;rebab-esh-sha'er was in use among the Arabs who conquered Spain&nbsp;in the 8th century; if the instrument was indeed ever introduced&nbsp;into Spain it has left no trace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The bowed instruments of the middle ages fall naturally into two distinct classes, according to the principles observed in construction. One is the type’ having a body formed on the model&nbsp;of a Greek or a Roman cithara, from which it was evolved by&nbsp;the addition of a neck and finger-board (see Guitar and </span><span class="font0">GUITAR-FIDDLE). </span><span class="font1">Instruments of this type were at all times recognized&nbsp;as superior and belonging to the realm of art, whereas type 2,&nbsp;derived from the Eastern rebab, never attained to any artistic&nbsp;development, and at the time when the first type had nearly&nbsp;reached its apogee the second was placed beyond the pale of art.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">According to Al-Farabi, the rebab had either one string, two strings or four, obtained by doubling these two; they were tuned&nbsp;most often in minor thirds or in major thirds.@@<sup>1</sup> The Arab scholar&nbsp;Ash-Shakandi, who flourished in Spain about </span><span class="font0">A.D. </span><span class="font1">1200, states&nbsp;that the rebab had been known for centuries in Spain, but was&nbsp;not mentioned on account of its want of artistic merit. Juan&nbsp;Ruiz, archipreste de Hita, in his enumeration@@<sup>2</sup> of the musical&nbsp;instruments in use in his day (14th century), mentions two rebabs,&nbsp;and speaks of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">il ravé gritador con su alta noia</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">il rabé morisco;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">the “ shrill rebab ” (or rather rebec) “ with its high note ” is thus&nbsp;quoted somewhat contemptuously already in the 14th century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The history of the origin of the rebab had until now not gone back beyond the 7th century </span><span class="font0">A.D., </span><span class="font1">and has been a matter of conjecture founded on the word </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rubāb</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rūbab,</span><span class="font1"> which is of Persian&nbsp;origin, and on the statement that the Arabs themselves declare&nbsp;they obtained the instrument from the Persians. Recent archaeological discoveries, however, provide abundant evidence of arche-types of both pear-shaped and boat-shaped rebabs in high antiquity.&nbsp;We have at present no clue to the name of the archetype, but it&nbsp;is clear that the el-Oud or lute of the Arabs and the wide pear-shaped rebab were practically one and the same instrument, until&nbsp;che advent of the bow, which had probably also been made known&nbsp;to the Arabs through the Persians, since their word for the bow,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">kamān,</span><span class="font1"> is borrowed from the Persian, but at what date is unknown.&nbsp;Al-Farabi does not mention the bow,@@3 and his chapter on the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rabâba</span><span class="font1"> does not deal with the construction of the instrument so&nbsp;much as with the production of sound and the divisions of the&nbsp;scale.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As far as is known at present, the archetype of the rebab and lute family is the instrument shown in fig. 1. The terra-cotta&nbsp;figure of the musician discovered in Egypt (1905-6) by Professor&nbsp;Flinders Petrie during the course of excavations in the cemetery&nbsp;of Goshen@@<sup>4</sup> is Greek work of the post-Mycenaean age; it was</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">found in surroundings assigned to the XXth Dynasty (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">c.</span><span class="font1">1000 b.c.), and shows the earliest pear-shaped instrument yet discovered.&nbsp;This statuette clearly establishes the origin of the instruments&nbsp;named by some </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lyra,@@5</span><span class="font1"> by others (including the present writer)&nbsp;rebab or rebec, common all over western Europe from the 11th&nbsp;century, whose main characteristic is an almost entire absence&nbsp;of neck. Two terra-cotta statuettes of musicians playing upon&nbsp;ancient Persian rebabs (see fig. 2) have been excavated from the Tell at Suza@@6 amongst objects referred to the reign of Shutruk-Nakhounta, who was king of Elam </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">c</span><span class="font1">. 789 b.c. The pear-shaped&nbsp;instrument, wide at the base and elongated to form a neck, with&nbsp;the head bent back at right angles and the strings plucked by&nbsp;the fingers,—the lute of the 6th century </span><span class="font0">A.D.,—</span><span class="font1">is seen first on a&nbsp;frieze from Afghanistan, forming one of the risers of steps to the&nbsp;tope of Jamal-Garhi. These sculptures, preserved at the British&nbsp;Museum, are assigned to the 2nd or 3rd century, and are said to&nbsp;show traces of classical influence. The same instrument is found&nbsp;engraved on a Sassanian silver dish in the British Museum,@@<sup>7</sup> of&nbsp;workmanship assigned to a period not later than the 7th century&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">A.D., </span><span class="font1">but probably earlier, as well as on other dishes of similar&nbsp;origin; one in the Hermitage, St Petersburg, was found at Irbit&nbsp;in 1880, on which Eros is depicted playing the lute and riding on a&nbsp;lion.@@<sup>8</sup> A third, found at Perm, forms part of Count Stroganov's&nbsp;collection.@@9</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Excavations carried out in ancient Khotan@@<sup>10</sup> or Ilchi (Turkestan, on the caravan route to Kashgar) have brought to light further&nbsp;evidence of the ubiquity of the rebab type in Asia. In addition&nbsp;to the two principal types of rebab (fig. 3) mentioned above there&nbsp;is also to be found the spoon-shaped instrument with no neck and&nbsp;large round head (fig. 4), sometimes seen in European medieval&nbsp;sculptures and MSS. of the 11th and 12th centuries.@@<sup>11</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The pear-shaped rebab or lute appears also among the celebrated paintings in the Buddhist cave temples of Ajanta,@@12 assigned to&nbsp;the 6th century </span><span class="font0">A.D. </span><span class="font1">A later example at the British Museum,&nbsp;a fragment of a dish found at Rhajes or Ray,@@13 in northern Persia,</span></p>
