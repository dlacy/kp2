a town in the hundred of the same name in the county of Dorset, 111 miles from London. It stands on the river Stour, and had once a considerable trade in making flannels, baize, and blankets; but of late it has declined. The buildings are indifferent, but it has a fine church, lately repaired. The market is held on Thursday. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 1406, in 1811 to 1461, in 1821 to 1612, and in 1831 to 1831.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
