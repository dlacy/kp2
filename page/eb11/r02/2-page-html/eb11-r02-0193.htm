<p><span class="font0">For the English Rhaetic see L. Richardson, “ Tne Rhaetic Rocks of North-west Gloucestershire,” </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Proc.

<p><span class="font1">RHAMNUS PURSHIANA, or Californian buckthorn, a plant the bark of which is used in medicine under the name of cascara&nbsp;sagrada. An active principle anthra-gluco-sagradin has been&nbsp;isolated by Tschirch. The preparations of it contained in the&nbsp;British pharmacopoeia are: (1) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Extractum Cascaraesagradae&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(extractum rhamni purshianae, United States pharmacopoeia),&nbsp;dose 2 to 8 grs.; (2) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Extractum cascarae sagradae liquidum,</span><span class="font1"> dose&nbsp;I to i fl. dr. From the latter is prepared </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">syrupus cascarae&nbsp;Orornaticus,</span><span class="font1"> dose | to 2 fl. dr. In this preparation the bitter&nbsp;taste of the cascara sagrada is disguised by the addition of&nbsp;tincture of orange, cinnamon water and syrup. In the United&nbsp;States pharmacopoeial prcparation </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Fluid extractum rhamni&nbsp;purshianae aromaticum,</span><span class="font1"> does 10 to 30 minims, the taste is&nbsp;similarly obscured. Cascara sagrada is one of the most useful&nbsp;of all laxatives, since not only does it empty the bowel of faecal&nbsp;matter, but it acts as a tonic to the intestine and tends to prevent future constipation. It is largely used in the treatment&nbsp;of chronic constipation. A single full dose of the liquid extract&nbsp;may be taken at bedtime, or divided doses, 10 to 15 minims,&nbsp;three times a day before meals. When a strong purgative is&nbsp;required some drug other than cascara sagrada should be&nbsp;employed, but its use in gradually decreasing doses is indicated&nbsp;after evacuation has been effected by podophyllin or rhubarb.&nbsp;Cascara sagrada is the principal constituent of most of thc&nbsp;proprietary laxatives on the market.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RHAMPSINÏTUS, a Greek corruption of Ra-messu-pa-neter, the popular name of Rameses III., king of Egypt of the XXth&nbsp;Dynasty. He is well known in connexion with tjie story of&nbsp;his treasure house told by Herodotus (ii. 121), which greatly&nbsp;resembles that of Agamedes and Trophonius. (See Egypt,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">History.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RHANKAVËS (commonly also Rhangabe), ALEXANDROS RHIZOS (1810-1892), Greek savant, poet and statesman, was born&nbsp;at Constantinople of a Phanariot family on the 25th of December&nbsp;1810. He was educated at Odessa and the military school at&nbsp;Munich. Having served as an officer of artillery in the Bavarian&nbsp;army, he returned to Greece, where he held several high educational and administrative appointments. He subsequently&nbsp;became ambassador at Washington (1867), Paris (1868), and&nbsp;Berlin (1874-1886), and was one of the Greek plenipotentiaries&nbsp;at the congress of 1878. After his recall he lived at Athens,&nbsp;where he died on the 29th of June 1892. He was the chief&nbsp;representative of a school of literary men whose object was to&nbsp;restore as far as possible the ancient classical language. Of&nbsp;his various works, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hellenic Antiquities</span><span class="font1"> (1842-1855, of great&nbsp;value for epigraphical purposes), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Archaeologia</span><span class="font1"> (1865-1866), an&nbsp;illustrated </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Archaeological Lexicon</span><span class="font1"> (1888-1891),· and a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">History&nbsp;of Modern Greek Literature</span><span class="font1"> (1877) are of the most interest to&nbsp;scholars. He wrote also the following dramatic pieces: </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The&nbsp;Marriage of Kutrules</span><span class="font1"> (comedy), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dukas</span><span class="font1"> (tragedy), the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Thirty&nbsp;Tyrants, The Eve</span><span class="font1"> (of the Greek revolution); the romances,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Prince of Morea, Leila,</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Notary of Argostoli',</span><span class="font1"> and&nbsp;translated portions of Dante, Schiller, Lessing, Goethe and&nbsp;Shakespeare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A complete edition of his philological works in nineteen volumes was published at Athens (1874-1890), and his ‘A ΐτομνημορεύματα (Memoirs)&nbsp;appeared posthumously in 1894-1895.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RHAPSODIST (Gk. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rhapsodos),</span><span class="font1"> originally an epic poet who recited his own poetry; then, one who recited the poems&nbsp;of others (see Homer).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RHATANY or KRAMERIA ROOT, in medicine, the dried root either of Para rhatany or of Peruvian rhatany. The&nbsp;action of rhatany is due to the rhatania-tannic acid, and resembles that of tannic acid, being a powerful astringent. An&nbsp;infusion is used as a gargle for relaxed throats; and lozenges,&nbsp;particularly those containing rhatany and cocaine, are useful&nbsp;in similar cases. Like tannic acid, the powdered extract may&nbsp;be applied </span><span class="font0">as </span><span class="font1">a local haemostatic. All preparations of rhatany&nbsp;taken internally are powerful astringents in diarrhoea and&nbsp;intestinal haemorrhage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RHAYADER </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Rhaiadr-Gwy),</span><span class="font1"> a market town of Radnorshire, Wales, situated amid wild and beautiful scenery on the left&nbsp;bank of the Wye, about ij m. above its confluence with the&nbsp;Elan, Pop. (1901) 1215. Rhayader is a station on the&nbsp;Cambrian railway. A stone bridge over the Wye connects&nbsp;the town with the village and parish church of Cwmdauddwr.&nbsp;Rhayader has for some centuries been an important centre for&nbsp;Welsh mutton and wool, and its sheep fairs are largely attended&nbsp;by drovers and buyers from all parts. Near Rhayader are the&nbsp;large reservoirs constructed (1895) by the corporation of&nbsp;Birmingham in the Elan and Claerwen valleys.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rhayader, built close to the Falls of the Wye (whence its name), owes its early importance to the castle erected here by Prince Rhys&nbsp;'ap Griffith ol South Wales, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">c.</span><span class="font0"> 1178, in order to check the English&nbsp;advance up the Wye Valley. Seized by the invaders, castle and&nbsp;town were later retaken in 1231 by Prince Llewelyn ap Iorwerth,&nbsp;who burned the fortress and slew its garrison. Scarcely a trace of&nbsp;the castle exists, although its site near St Clement’s church is locally&nbsp;known as Tower Hill. With the erection of Maesyfed into the shire&nbsp;of Radnor in 1536 Rhayader was named as assize-town for the&nbsp;newly formed county in conjunction with New Radnor; but in 1542,&nbsp;on account of a local riot, the town was deprived of this privilege in&nbsp;favour of Presteign. Rhayader constituted one οί the group of&nbsp;boroughs comprising the Radnor parliamentary district until the&nbsp;Redistribution Act of 1885.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RHEA, a goddess of the Greeks known in mythology as the daughter of Uranus and Gaia, the sister and consort of Kronos,&nbsp;and the mother of Zeus. In Homer she is the mother of&nbsp;the gods, though not a universal mother like Cybele, the&nbsp;Phrygian Great Mother, with whom she was later identified.&nbsp;The original seat of her worship was in Crete. There, according&nbsp;to legend, she saved the new-born Zeus, her sixth child, from&nbsp;being devoured by Kronos by substituting a stone for him and&nbsp;entrusting the infant god to the care of her attendants the Curetes&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.).</span><span class="font1"> These attendants afterwards ’ became the bodyguard&nbsp;of Zeus and the priests of Rhea, and performed ceremonies in&nbsp;her honour. In historic times the resemblances between Rhea&nbsp;and the Asiatic Great Mother, Phrygian Cybele, were so noticeable that the Greeks accounted for them by regarding the latter&nbsp;as only their own Rhea, who had deserted her original home&nbsp;in Crete and fled to the mountain wilds of Asia Minor to escape&nbsp;the persecution of Kronos (Strabo 469, 12). The reverse view&nbsp;was also held (Virgil, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Aen.</span><span class="font1"> iii. m), and it is probably true&nbsp;that a stock of Asiatic origin formed part of the primitive&nbsp;population of Crete and brought with them the worship of&nbsp;the Asiatic Great Mother, who became the Cretan Rhea. (See&nbsp;Great Mother of the Gods.)</span><span class="font0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(G. </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sn.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RHEA, the name given in 1752 by P. H. G. Mohring@@<sup>1</sup> to a South American bird which, though long before known and&nbsp;described by the eärlier writers—Nieremberg, AIarcgrav and&nbsp;Piso (the last of whom has a recognizable but rude figure of&nbsp;it)—had been without any distinctive scientific appellation.&nbsp;Adopted a few years later by Al. J. Brisson, the name has since&nbsp;passed into general use, especially among English authors, for&nbsp;what their predecessors had called the American ostrich; but&nbsp;on the European continent the bird is commonly called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Nandu,@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"> &nbsp;</span><span class="font1">a word corrupted from a name it is said to have borne among&nbsp;the aboriginal inhabitants of Brazil, where the Portuguese&nbsp;settlers called it </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ema</span><span class="font1"> (see Emeu). The resemblance of the rhea&nbsp;to the ostrich </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.)</span><span class="font1"> was at once perceived, but the differences&nbsp;between them are also very evident. The former, for instance,&nbsp;has three instead of two toes on each foot, it has no apparent&nbsp;tail, its wings are far better developed, and when folded cover&nbsp;the body, and its head and neck are clothed with feathers, while&nbsp;internal distinctions of still deeper significance have since been</span></p><div>
