<p><span class="font0">provements in the manufacture of hempen rope or cordage. The improvements consist in impregnating the yarns with tannin, by steeping them in an infusion of oak-bark,&nbsp;catechu, sumach, or valonia, previous to their being twisted&nbsp;into cordage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">1832. February 1st, Mr James Lang, flax-dresser, Greenock, obtained a patent for such improvements in the construction of the gill spreading or drawing heads, and roving or spinning frames, as adapted them for the spinning of rope-yarns. Fig. 14 shows a side view, and fig. 15 a top&nbsp;view, of the first drawing or spreading machine ; and fig. 16</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">is a diagram illustrative of its mode of action. The same letters refer to the same parts in all the figures. Here α is a&nbsp;portion of a board called the spreading-board. Over the surface of this board an endless band of leather travels, in the&nbsp;direction indicated by the arrow; and on this band the hemp&nbsp;to be operated upon is spread. By the motion of the band&nbsp;the hemp is carried forward until it is taken hold of by the&nbsp;feeding rollers </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">bb,</span><span class="font0"> by the motion of which it is carried onwards to be acted on by the gills or travelling hackles </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ccc ;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and the gills are fixed to slips of brass screwed to bars which&nbsp;extend across the machine, as seen in fig. 15. These bars&nbsp;pass through grooves formed in the links of an endless&nbsp;chain, by the motion of which they are carried round ; and&nbsp;their ends move in peculiarly formed slits in the framing&nbsp;of the machine, by which they are confined to their proper&nbsp;course. By the gills being made to move faster than the&nbsp;surfaces of the feeding rollers, they pass through the hemp&nbsp;many times in the course of its passage across the space in&nbsp;which it is acted on by them, and they are thus enabled to&nbsp;split and straighten the fibres. The hemp now passes between the drawing rollers </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ee,</span><span class="font0"> the surfaces of which can be&nbsp;made to move from forty to sixty times faster than those of&nbsp;the feeding rollers, according to the material to be acted</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font0">on. By them the hemp is drawn into a sliver of a certain state of fineness, and this sliver, after passing through the&nbsp;delivering rollers, falls into the can </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">g.</span><span class="font0"> When a certain quantity of sliver is delivered into the can, a bell is rung by the&nbsp;machinery ; the filled can is then removed by the attendant,&nbsp;and an empty one substituted. The filled cans are then&nbsp;conveyed to the second drawing machine, which differs from&nbsp;the first chiefly in being smaller, in having no spreading-board, and in having a double set of rollers and gills in the&nbsp;width, as will be seen by the top view, fig. 17. The cans&nbsp;containing the slivers from the first drawing machine are&nbsp;placed at the end of this, in such number as may be required, and many slivers are then passed together through each&nbsp;set of feeding rollers. After having been acted on by the&nbsp;gills and the drawing rollers, the slivers may be delivered separately, or they may be combined, as shown in the drawing, by passing through a tray previous to entering the last&nbsp;pair of delivering rollers. The slivers, after having been&nbsp;subjected to a third drawing, in a machine the parts of&nbsp;which are still finer than those </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ot</span><span class="font0"> the second machine, are&nbsp;carried to the roving or spinning machine. This machine&nbsp;has feeding rollers, gills, and drawing rollers similar to the&nbsp;drawing machines ; but the parts are still finer than those&nbsp;of the last machine. In fig. 18 the spinning apparatus is&nbsp;shown. The slivers, on leaving the drawing rollers, pass into the trumpet-mouthed tubes </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">aa.</span><span class="font0"> The upper part of these&nbsp;tubes is in two halves, one of which is fixed to the cross&nbsp;rail of the machine, while the other is pressed against it by&nbsp;means of a spring, in such a manner as gently to compress&nbsp;the sliver on entering the tube. The bottom of the tube is&nbsp;set into another tube serving as a socket, and into this last&nbsp;tube discs of felt or cloth are put, through which a slit is&nbsp;made for the reception of the thread, which is thus com-</span></p>
