a town of England, in the county of Huntingdonſhire, 75 miles from London, ſouth-weſt of Yaxley, on the Roman highway from Caſtor to Huntingdon, called <hi rend="italic">Ermine-street,</hi> ſome parts of which, in this neighbourhood, appear ſtill paved with ſtone. This place is famous for cheeſe which is called <hi rend="italic">English Parmesan,</hi> and is brought to table full of mites or maggots. For making Stilton cheeſe, we have the following receipt in the firſt volume of the <hi rend="italic">Repοsitοry of Arts and Manufactures :</hi></p><p>“ Take the night’s cream, and put it to the morning’s new milk, with the rennet ; when the curd is come, it is not to be broken, as is done with other cheeſes, but take it out with a ſoil diſh altogether, and place it in a ſieve to drain gradually ; and as it drains, keep gradually preſſing it till it becomes firm and dry ; then place it in a wooden hoop ; afterwards to be kept dry on boards, turned frequently, with cloth binders round it, which are to be tightened as occasion requires, and changed every day until the cheeſe become firm enough to ſupport itſelf; after the cloth is taken off, the cheeſe is rubbed every day all over, for two or three months, with a bruſh ; and if the weather be damp or moiſt twice a-day ; and even before the cloth is taken off, the top and bottom are well rubbed every day.”</p></div></body></text></TEI>
