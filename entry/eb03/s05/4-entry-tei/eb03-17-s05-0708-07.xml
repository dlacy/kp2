in eccleſiaſtical law, is an injury done by one clerk or incumbent to another, in taking the fruits of his benefice without any right thereunto, but under a pretended title. It is remedied by a decree to account for the profits ſo taken. This injury, when the jus <hi rend="italic">patronatus,</hi> or right of advowſon, doth not come in debate, is cognizable in the ſpiritual court ; as if a patron firſt preſents A to a benefice, who is inſtituted and inducted thereto ; and then, upon pretence of a vacancy, the ſame patron preſents B to the same living, and he alſo obtains inſtitution and induction. Now if A diſputes the fact of the vacancy, then that clerk who is kept out of the profits of the living, whichever it be, may ſue the other in the ſpiritual court for ſpoliation, or taking the profits of his benefice. And it ſhall there be tried, whether the living were or were not vacant ; upon which the validity of the second clerk’s pretentions muſt depend. But if the right of patronage comes at all into diſpute, as if one patron preſented A, and another patron preſented B, there the eccleſiaſtical court hath no cognizance, provided the tithes ſued for amount to a fourth part of the value of the living, but may be prohibited at the inſtance of the patron by the king’s writ of <hi rend="italic">indicavit,</hi> So alio iſ a clerk, without any colour of title, ejects another from his parſonage, this injury muſt be redreſſed in the temporal courts : for it depends upon no queſtion determinable by the ſpiritual law (as plurality of benefices or no plurality, vacancy or no vacancy), but is merely a civil injury.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
