<p><span class="font1">and above all light were the aims of these studies. IIis mother was a frequent model, and we can trace in her features the strong&nbsp;likeness to her son, especially in the portraits of himself at an&nbsp;advanced age. In the collection of Rembrandt’s works at&nbsp;Amsterdam in 1898 were shown three portraits of his father, who&nbsp;died about 1632; nine arc catalogued altogether. The last&nbsp;portrait of his mother is that of the Vienna Museum, painted the&nbsp;year before her death in 1640. One of his sisters also frequently&nbsp;sat to him, and Bode suggests that she must have accompanied&nbsp;him to Amsterdam and kept house for him till he married.&nbsp;This conjecture rests on the number of portraits of the same&nbsp;young woman painted in the early years of hisstay in Amsterdam&nbsp;and before he met his bride. Then, again, in the many portraits&nbsp;of himself painted in his early life we can see with what zeal he&nbsp;set himself to master every form of expression, now grave, now&nbsp;gay—how thoroughly he learned to model the human face not&nbsp;from the outside but from the inner man. Dr Bode gives fifty&nbsp;'as the number of the portraits of himself (perhaps sixty is nearer&nbsp;the actual number), most of them painted in youth and in old&nbsp;age, the times when he had leisure for such work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rembrandt’s earliest pictures were painted at Leiden, from 1627 to 1631. Bode mentions about nine pictures as known to&nbsp;belong to these years, chiefly paintings of single figures, as&nbsp;“ St Paul in Prison ” and “ St Jerome but now and then&nbsp;compositions of several, as “ Samson in Prison ” and “ Presentation in the Temple.” The prevailing tone of all these pictures&nbsp;is a greenish grey, the effect being somewhat cold and heavy.&nbsp;•The gallery at Cassel gives us a typical example of his studies&nbsp;•of the heads of old men, firm and hard in workmanship and full&nbsp;of detail, the effects of light and shade being carefully thought&nbsp;out. His work was now attracting the attention of lovers of&nbsp;art in the great city of Amsterdam; and, urged by their calls,&nbsp;he removed about 1631 to live and die there. At one bound&nbsp;he leaped into the position of the first portrait painter of the&nbsp;city, and received numerous commissions. During the early&nbsp;years of his residence there are at least forty known portraits&nbsp;from his hand, firm and solid in manner and staid in expression.&nbsp;It has been remarked that the fantasy in which he indulged&nbsp;through life was reserved only for the portraits of himself and&nbsp;his immediate connexions. The excellent painter Thomas dc&nbsp;Keyser was then in the height of his power, and his influence&nbsp;is to be traced in some of Rembrandt’s smaller portraits. Pupils&nbsp;also now flocked to his house in the Bloemgracht, among them&nbsp;.Gerard Douw, who was nearly of his own age. The first&nbsp;important work executed by Rembrandt in Amsterdam is&nbsp;“ Simeon in the Temple,” of the Hague Museum, a fine early&nbsp;example of his treatment of light and shade and of his subtle&nbsp;colour. The concentrated light falls on the principal figure,&nbsp;while the background is full of mystery. The surface is smooth&nbsp;and enamel-like, and all the details are carefully wrought out,&nbsp;while the action of light on the mantle of Simeon shows how&nbsp;soon he had felt the magical effect of the play of colour. In the&nbsp;life-sized “ Lesson in Anatomy ” of 1632 we have the first of&nbsp;the great portrait subjects—Tulp the anatomist, the early&nbsp;friend of Rembrandt, discoursing to his seven associates, who&nbsp;are ranged with eager heads round the foreshortened body.&nbsp;The subject had been treated in former years by the Mierevelts,&nbsp;A. Pietersen and others, for the Hall of the Surgeons. But it&nbsp;was reserved for Rembrandt to make it a great picture by the&nbsp;grouping of the expressive portraits and by the completeness&nbsp;of the conception. The colour is quiet and the handling of the&nbsp;brush timid and precise, while the light and shade are somewhat&nbsp;harsh and abrupt. But it is a marvellous picture for a young&nbsp;man of twenty-five, and it is generally accepted as marking a&nbsp;new departure in the career of the painter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">About 700 pictures are known to have come from Rembrandt’s own hand. It is impossible to notice more than the prominent&nbsp;works. Besides Jhe Pellicorne family portraits of 1632 now in thë&quot;&nbsp;Wallace Collection, we have the Caligraphist Coppenol of the&nbsp;Cassel Gallery, interesting in the first place as an early example of&nbsp;Rembrandt’s method of giving permanent interest to a portrait by&nbsp;converting it into a picture. He invests it with a sense of life by&nbsp;a momentary expression as Coppenol raises his head towards the&nbsp;spectator while he is mending a quill. The same motive is to be&nbsp;found in the “Shipbuilder,” 1633 (Buckingham Palace), who looks&nbsp;up from his work with a sense of interruption at the approach of&nbsp;his wife. Coppenol was painted thrice and etched twice by the&nbsp;artist, the last of whose portrait etchings (1661) was </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font0"> Coppenol&nbsp;of large size. The two small pictures of “ The Philosopher ” of the&nbsp;Louvre date from 1633, delicate in execution and full of mysterious&nbsp;effect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The year 1634 is especially remarkable as that of Rembrandt’s marriage with Saskia van Uylenborch, a beautiful, fair-haired&nbsp;Frisian maiden of good connexions. Till her death in 1642 she&nbsp;was the centre of his life and art, and lives for us in many a canvas&nbsp;as well as in her own portraits. On her the painter lavished his&nbsp;magical power, painting her as the Queen of Artemisia or Bath-sheba, and as the wife of Samson—always proud of her long fair&nbsp;locks, and covering her with pearls and gold as precious in their&nbsp;play of colour as those of the Indies. A joyous pair we see them&nbsp;in the Dresden Gallery, Saskia sitting on his knee while he&nbsp;laughs gaily, or promenading together in a fine picture of 1636, or&nbsp;putting the last touches of ornament to her toilette, for thus Bode&nbsp;interprets the so-called “ Burgomaster Pancras and his Wife.”&nbsp;These were his happy days when he painted himself in his&nbsp;exuberant fantasy, and adorned himself, at least in his portraits,&nbsp;in scarfs and feathers and gold chains. Saskia brought him a&nbsp;marriage portion of forty thousand guilders, a large sum for&nbsp;those times, and she brought him also a large circle of good&nbsp;friends in Amsterdam. She bore him four children, Rumbartus&nbsp;and two girls, successively named Cornelia after his beloved&nbsp;mother, all of whom died in infancy, and Titus, named after&nbsp;Titia a sister of Saskia. We have several noble portraits of&nbsp;Saskia, a good type of the beauty of Holland, all painted with&nbsp;the utmost love and care, at Cassel (1633), at Dresden (1641),&nbsp;and a posthumous one (1643) at BerHn. But the greatest in&nbsp;workmanship and most pathetic in expression seems to us,&nbsp;though it is decried by Bode, that of Antwerp (1641), in which&nbsp;it is impossible not to trace declining health and to find a melancholy presage of her death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">One of Rembrandt’s greatest portraits of 1634 is the superb full-length of Martin Daey, which, with that of Madame Daey, painted according to Vosmaer some years later, formed one of the ornaments&nbsp;of the Van Loon collection at Amsterdam. Both now belong to&nbsp;Baron Gustave de Rothschild. From the firm detailed execution&nbsp;of this portrait one turns with wonder to the broader handling of the&nbsp;“ Old Woman ” (Françoise van Wasserhoven), aged eighty-three,&nbsp;in the National Gallery, of the same year, remarkable for the effect&nbsp;of reflected light and still more for the sympathetic rendering of&nbsp;character.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The life of Samson supplied many subjects in these early days. The so-called “ Count of Gueldres threatening his Father-in-law ”&nbsp;of the Berlin Gallery has been restored to its. proper signification&nbsp;by M. Kolloff, who finds it to be Samson. It is forced and violent&nbsp;in its action. The greatest of this series, and one of the prominent pictures of Rembrandt’s work, is the “ Marriage of Samson,”&nbsp;of the Dresden Gallery, painted in 1638. Here Rembrandt gives&nbsp;the rein to his imagination and makes the scene live before us.&nbsp;Except the bride (Saskia), who sits calm and grand on a dais in the&nbsp;centre of the feast, with the full light again playing on her flowing&nbsp;locks and wealth of jewels, all is animated and full of bustle. Samson, evidently a Rembrandt of fantasy, leans over a chair propounding his riddle to the Philistine lords. In execution it is a&nbsp;great advance on former subject pictures; it is bolder in manner,&nbsp;and we have here signs of his approaching love of warmer tones of&nbsp;red and yellow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The story of Susannah also occupied him in these early y’ears, and he returned to the subject in 1641 and 1653. “ The Bather ”&nbsp;of the National Gallery may be another interpretation of the same&nbsp;theme.. In all of these pictures the woman is coarse in type and&nbsp;lumpy in form, though the modelling is soft and round, the effect&nbsp;which Rembrandt always strove to gain. Beauty of form was&nbsp;outside his art. But the so-called “ Danae ” (1636) at St Petersburg is a sufficient reply to those who deny his ability ever to appreciate the beauty of the nude female form. It glows with colour&nbsp;and life, and the blood seems to pulsate under the warm skin. In&nbsp;the picturesque story of Tobit Rembrandt found much to interest&nbsp;him, as we see in\he beautiful small picture of the d’Arenberg&nbsp;Collection at Brussels. Sight is being restored to the aged Tobias,&nbsp;while with infinite tenderness his wife holds the old man’s hand&nbsp;caressingly. The momentary action is complete, and the picture&nbsp;goes straight to the heart. In the Berlin Gallery he paints the&nbsp;anxiety of the parents as they wait the return of their son. Tn&nbsp;1637 he painted the fine picture now in the Louvre of the “ Flight&nbsp;of the Angel and the same subject is grandly treated by him,</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
