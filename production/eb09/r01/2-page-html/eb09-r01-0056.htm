<p><span class="font1">by a central bolt or pivot to the frame of the engine, so that the fore-wheels can swing to the curves of the line. On the Metropolitan, Metropolitan District, and North London Railways entirely,&nbsp;and on many large railway systems partially, where sharp curves&nbsp;are frequent, bogie-engines are employed, and with great advantage in facilitating traction. Another device for the same purpose&nbsp;is the use of radial axles,—that is, axles either at the forepart or&nbsp;the back of the engine, which by their axle-boxes slide laterally&nbsp;between circularly formed guides on entering and on leaving curved&nbsp;parts of the way, and so maintain a radial position at right angles&nbsp;to the line of rails.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">American practice, many years since, arrived at two leading types of locomotive for passenger and for goods traffic. The&nbsp;passenger locomotive has eight wheels, of which four in front are&nbsp;framed in a bogie, and the four wheels behind are coupled drivers.&nbsp;This is the type to which English practice has been approximating.&nbsp;The tender is carried on eight wheels, disposed under two trucks&nbsp;or bogies, fore and aft. Goods locomotives are made with eight&nbsp;wheels and with ten wheels, of which, in each case, the leading&nbsp;pair of wheels are connected with a swing bolster and radius bar,&nbsp;to conform laterally and radially to curves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As the speed increases a more than proportional increase in the engine-power is necessary to draw a given train. Thus, if an engine&nbsp;and tender, weighing together 40 tons and exerting a given tractive&nbsp;force, takes, say, forty loaded carriages, weighing 360 tons, at&nbsp;20 miles per hour on a level, the loads which it could take if it&nbsp;exerted the same tractive power at higher speeds would be only as&nbsp;follows :—</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>

<p><span class="font1">The influence of gradients also is very important. If an engine and tender, weighing together 40 tons, is capable of drawing a&nbsp;maximum train of, say, forty-two loaded carriages, weighing 420&nbsp;tons, at 20 miles per hour on a level, it would only draw the&nbsp;following loads at the same speed on the following inclines :—</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>

<p><span class="font1">This is the reason why the older railways were made nearly level at an enormous cost,—the elder Stephenson’s policy being to incur&nbsp;a large expenditure in construction in order to avoid otherwise&nbsp;heavy inclines and heavy expenses. The ruling gradient of the&nbsp;Liverpool and Manchester Railway was fixed at 1 in 900, excepting,&nbsp;of course, the inevitable inclines at Rainhill summit, for working&nbsp;which special provision was made ; that of the next great line, the&nbsp;London and Birmingham, was fixed at 1 in 330 ; on the Great&nbsp;Western Railway, one of the earliest made lines, the ruling inclination is 1 in 1320 for the greater part of the way. Locke, as already&nbsp;explained, initiated the system of cheaply constructed railways, as&nbsp;the facilities for increasing the power of locomotives became betteι<sup>-</sup>understood ; he constructed lines with long steep gradients, some&nbsp;of them 1 in 70, 1 in 75, 1 in 80. The Great Northern Railway,&nbsp;of comparatively recent origin, was constructed on a ruling gradient&nbsp;of 1 in 200 ; and, in general, the more recently made lines have&nbsp;the steepest gradients. Steep railways are generally also lines of&nbsp;frequent curves, which is another cause of loss of locomotive power.&nbsp;Moreover, the ruling speeds, as they may be called, have in the&nbsp;course of years increased. Thus in every way more powerful&nbsp;engines are now needed than in the early days of railways.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The fundamental characteristics of English practice are fairly represented by a few types of locomotives. Take first an express&nbsp;passenger locomotive, which stands on a wheel base—the distance&nbsp;apart of the centres of the extreme axles—of 15 feet 4 inches. The&nbsp;cylinders are inside and are 16 inches in diameter, with a slide of&nbsp;22 inches. The driving-wheels are 7 feet in diameter. The firegrate has an area of 18 square feet, and the heating surface of the&nbsp;fire-box and flue-tubes taken together is 1339 square feet. The&nbsp;total weight of the engine in working order is 28 tons 6 cwt., of&nbsp;which nearly 12 tons are driving weight,—the weight at the driving-wheels. The tender stands on three pairs of wheels and weighs&nbsp;about 16 tons, with, in addition, 1780 gallons or 8 tons of water&nbsp;when filled, and 3 tons of coal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The “ Lady of the Lake ” is an express passenger locomotive, one of a class which was designed by Mr John Ramsbottom with special&nbsp;regard to the running of express trains on the northern division&nbsp;of the London and North-Western Railway. The cylinders are&nbsp;“outside”; they are 16 inches in diameter, with 24 inches of&nbsp;stroke, and the driving-wheels are 7 feet 7 inches in diameter. The&nbsp;fire-grate has an area of 15 square feet, and there is over 1000 square</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">feet of heating surface. The engine weighs 27 tons in working order and the tender 17⅜, together 44⅜ tons. The tender is fitted&nbsp;with Mr Ramsbottom’s apparatus for picking up feed-water whilst&nbsp;running : a scoop is let down from the bottom of the tender and&nbsp;dips into water contained in a long open trough, laid between the&nbsp;rails, from which it is scooped up into the tanks. The minimum&nbsp;speed at which this operation can be effected is 22 miles per hour.&nbsp;By the aid of the water-lifter this express engine has been enabled&nbsp;to run the whole distance from Holyhead to London—264 miles—&nbsp;in one continuous run, at an average speed of 42 miles per hour,&nbsp;taking a train of eight or nine carriages, and consuming 27 lb of&nbsp;coal as fuel per mile run.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">An express passenger locomotive having 18-inch cylinders and four-coupled driving-wheels, 7 feet in diameter, with a four-wheel&nbsp;bogie in front under the smoke - box, was designed by Mr T. W.&nbsp;Johnson for the traffic of the Midland Railway. The engine stands&nbsp;on eight wheels, forming a base 21⅜ feet long. It weighs about&nbsp;42 tons in working order, and with the tender, including coal and&nbsp;water, about 68 tons. The average load taken by engines of this&nbsp;class is fourteen carriages at the time-bill speed of 50 miles per&nbsp;hour, over gradients of from 1 in 120 to 1 in 130, with a consumption of 28 lb of coal per mile run. The engine can take as a maximum load seventeen carriages between Manchester and Derby, over&nbsp;ruling gradients of 1 in 90 and 1 in 100 for 10 miles, at a speed up&nbsp;the inclines of 35 miles per hour, and on levels and falling gradients&nbsp;at 50 miles per hour. The carriages weigh, with passengers, 11&nbsp;tons each, making up a train of the gross weight of 187 tons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The express passenger engines on the Great Northern Railway (fig. 40), designed by Mr Patrick Stirling, have outside cylinders, 18</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">inches in diameter, and a single pair of 8-feet driving-wheels. It is one of the most recent developments of the single-wheel engine. It&nbsp;is placed on eight wheels, of which the first four are framed in a&nbsp;bogie, or truck, pivoted on a centre under the smoke-box. The&nbsp;cylinders are placed outside, and between the wheels of the bogie&nbsp;at each side. They are 18 inches in diameter, with a stroke of&nbsp;28 inches,—dimensions which, taken together, exceed in magnitude those of any other engine for English passenger-traffic. The&nbsp;driving-wheels are 8 feet 1 inch in diameter and the bogie-wheels&nbsp;3 feet 11 inches. The engine weighs 38 tons in working order, the&nbsp;distribution of the weight being as follows :—</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>

<p><span class="font1">The pivot of the bogie is 6 inches nearer the hind than the front axle,—these being 6⅜ feet apart. By this disposition the' bogie&nbsp;appears to lead better than if the pivot were, as usual, equidistant&nbsp;between the axles. The working pressure in the boiler is 140 lb per&nbsp;square inch. There are 217 brass flue-tubes, l-9/16 inches in diameter,&nbsp;presenting a heating surface for evaporation of upwards of 1000&nbsp;square feet. There is in all 1165 square feet of surface, and there&nbsp;is 17'6 square feet of grate surface. Mr Stirling, on the question&nbsp;of single-wheel </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">versus</span><span class="font1"> coupled wheels for passenger locomotives,&nbsp;states that he constructed two classes of engines,—one class with&nbsp;four 6</span><span class="font0">½</span><span class="font1">-feet wheels coupled, the other with a single pair of 7-feet&nbsp;driving-wheels. The boilers of the two classes were alike ; also&nbsp;the cylinders, which were 17 inches in diameter, with 24 inches of&nbsp;stroke. The pressure in the boilers was 140 lb. With like trains&nbsp;the single-wheel engine had the better of it ; in fact, it generally&nbsp;beat the coupled engine in time, running from King’s Cross to&nbsp;Potter’s Bar, a distance of nearly 13 miles, nearly all uphill, the&nbsp;gradients varying from 1 in 105 for 2 miles to 1 in 200. Engines&nbsp;of the class of the 8-feet-wheel engine travel between King’s Cross&nbsp;and Leeds or York. The steepest gradients on the route are met&nbsp;with on leaving Leeds, ascending 1 in 50, besides the gradient 1&nbsp;in 105 leaving King’s Cross. Trains of from sixteen to twenty-two carriages are taken from King’s Cross station with ease ; and&nbsp;on several occasions twenty-eight carriages have been taken, and&nbsp;time has been kept. On one occasion a distance of 15 miles in</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
