<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The founder of modern philosophy describesι the subject of our present inquiry as being “ that science which we call&nbsp;Rhetoric or Art of Eloquence ; a science excellent, and excellently well laboured.” But Bacon’s praise of the science&nbsp;itself, and of its ancient cultivators, has been fair from commanding universal assent. The prejudice with which rhetorical studies are regarded by so many, has, it must be&nbsp;confessed, been fostered, if not generated, by the fault of&nbsp;some of its students and expositors. Rhetoricians, like&nbsp;teachers of the kindred science logic, have too often claimed for their art the possession of powers which do not belong to it: their systems of precepts have become most&nbsp;ponderous, and their pretensions most extravagant, in times&nbsp;when eloquence was sunk in the deepest decay ; and in the&nbsp;rhetorical writings of the lower empire and the dark ages,&nbsp;it seems to be implicitly assumed that every man who submits to learn and practise certain prescribed rules, will attain skill in speech and writing, as certainly as he would,&nbsp;by an industrious apprenticeship, acquire the mastery of a&nbsp;mechanical trade. Accordingly, in more than one period,&nbsp;and in none perhaps more decidedly than in our own, the&nbsp;very name of Rhetoric has been put under the ban of the&nbsp;empire of literature ; and the sentence has been justified by&nbsp;misrepresentations both of the purposes of the art, and of&nbsp;the works which result from it. Its rules have been described as a scheme of petty sophistical artifices, designed to aid&nbsp;in smuggling falsehood into the mind under the disguise&nbsp;of logical quibbles or oratorical ornaments ; and, the worst&nbsp;declamations of the worst declaimers being exhibited as&nbsp;adequate specimens, rhetorical composition has been defined to be, that which possesses the forms of eloquence&nbsp;without its spirit. We hear truth, good taste, and eloquence, severally spoken of as the antitheses of rhetoric.&nbsp;Words, to use Mirabeau’s paradox, are things; and the&nbsp;subject which we are now to consider is not the only&nbsp;one, nor by any means the most important, in which infinite mischief has been done by the attaching of contemptible associations to terms of neutral meaning, and by&nbsp;the affixing of odious names to objects in themselves innocent or useful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The truth is, that the uses of rhetoric, as well as of all the other arts or sciences which, in different departments,&nbsp;aim at the training of the human mind for exertions in&nbsp;which it is itself its own instrument, are principally negative. Neither in reasoning nor in oratory can any scheme&nbsp;of rules, logical or rhetorical, nor any study of models however profound, nor any practice however long and intelligent, enable the intellect to perform, even moderately well,&nbsp;a task for which it has an inherent incapacity ; and if excellence be the end in view, it will assuredly never be&nbsp;reached, either with the observance of rules or independently of them, unless genius be present to give the primary impulse, and to sustain the mind in its course. Logic,&nbsp;strictly speaking, does not teach us how to reason, but only&nbsp;how to avoid violations of those essential principles on which&nbsp;all reasoning is founded. In like manner, a legitimate system of rhetoric would teach, not what eloquence </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">is,</span><span class="font0"> but&nbsp;what it is </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">not ;</span><span class="font0"> it would disclaim all purpose of qualifying its&nbsp;students to compound an eloquent discourse by rule, as a&nbsp;medicine is compounded after a prescription ; and it would&nbsp;occupy itself mainly in discovering, by the immediate study&nbsp;of the mind itself, and by critical examination of the works&nbsp;of genius, those guiding and universal laws of human intellect which the student of eloquence </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">must not</span><span class="font0"> disobey, if he&nbsp;wishes to attain, in any shape, the end which he pursues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It must be that such principles exist : if we apprehend rightly what eloquence is, we may reasonably hope to discover at least some of them ; and even if we could discover&nbsp;them all,—which no sound thinker has ever yet pretended&nbsp;to do,—the speaker or writer would still retain ample space&nbsp;for the exertion of his natural powers, which indeed would&nbsp;act with redoubled ease and vigour from his distinct knowledge of the limits of their domain. A chart does not teach&nbsp;the mariner how to navigate his vessel ; but it may fare&nbsp;hardly with him if he wants one in a narrow sea, with whose&nbsp;soundings he is imperfectly acquainted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is designed, in this paper, not to present a dissertation having any claim to be considered as a complete exposition&nbsp;of the subject in any of its sections, but simply to sketch&nbsp;in outline a plan of rhetorical studies, which the student&nbsp;may not find altogether useless as a clue when he attempts&nbsp;to master the details under the guidance of more ambitious&nbsp;works ; and it may be well to state at the outset the view&nbsp;which, in common with those who have thought most deeply on the matter, we entertain as to the means by which&nbsp;rhetoric is qualified to execute the very important task&nbsp;which it undertakes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the first place, then, we hold that the systematic view of the principles and rules of eloquence which rhetorical&nbsp;treatises usually offer, must peremptorily be embraced, as&nbsp;an essential part, in the studies of every one who would&nbsp;become really eloquent in speech or in writing. But this&nbsp;proposition must be understood with two cautions. First,&nbsp;in regard to many particulars indispensable towards the&nbsp;attainment of eloquence, every sound scheme of rhetorical&nbsp;precepts, abandoning all claim to primary discovery, contents itself with informing or reminding the student, that&nbsp;he must seek for knowledge elsewhere, from reflection on&nbsp;the phenomena of his own mind, from the best works in&nbsp;philosophy, and from an observation of the world and of&nbsp;human nature. This is true, not merely as to the matter&nbsp;on which eloquence may employ itself, as to which, however, it is true universally ; but also as to most of the instruments which the art uses. Secondly, and more particularly, the real usefulness of rhetoric rests, not on its&nbsp;special rules, but on its general principles. As soon as a&nbsp;rule diverts the student’s attention from the principle, it&nbsp;for him ceases to be an aid, and becomes a positive hindrance. As soon as a treatise on rhetoric has impressed&nbsp;on the student’s mind distinctly and indelibly the great&nbsp;principles on which eloquence is founded, it has given him&nbsp;a talisman to guard him against all seductions into error, and&nbsp;even against the very mistakes which may be inculcated in&nbsp;the book itself. Systems of rhetoric aid effectually in the&nbsp;attainment of eloquence, only so far as they teach the student to reflect on its principles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But, further, we have called systematic rhetoric a part only of the studies leading towards eloquence. It is in&nbsp;truth a part which, by itself, is insufficient for the attainment&nbsp;of the end ; for we must add to it a critical acquaintance&nbsp;with the best models of literature, extending over as many&nbsp;of its departments as possible, but especially minute in&nbsp;that which the student chiefly designs to cultivate. What&nbsp;is here meant is a study of literary works, not for the&nbsp;knowledge which they contain, but as models ; a study directed towards an analysis of the mode in which they communicate knowledge, and of the conformity or disagreement&nbsp;of that mode with the laws of eloquence. Such a study&nbsp;may be said to bear towards the systematic portion of rhe-</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
