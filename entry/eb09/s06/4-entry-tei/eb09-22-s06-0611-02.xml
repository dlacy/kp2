<hi rend="smallcaps">John M‘Douall</hi> (1818-1866), a South-Australian explorer, was born in England in 1818 and arrived in the colony about 1839. He accompanied Captain Sturt’s 1844-45 expedition as draughtsman, and between 1858 and 1862 he made six expeditions into the interior, the last of which brought him on July 24 to the shores of the Indian</p><p>Ocean at Port Darwin, the first to have crossed the island continent from south to north. It was this transcontinental expedition which led to the territorial rights, and, in defiance of geographical position, the name of South Australia being extended over so much of central and north Australia. Stuart was rewarded with £3000 and a grant of 1000 square miles of grazing country in the interior rent free for seven years. His name is perpetuated by Central Mount Stuart. He died in England June 5, 1866.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
