They are excellent eating, and are much sought after for bait. They are captured by small meshed seines, as well as by digging in the sand. The eggs of sand-eels are small, heavier than sea-water and slightly adhesive: they are scattered among the grains of sand in which the fishes live, and the larvae and young at various stages of growth may be taken with the row-net in sandy bays in summer.</p><p>Sand-eels are common in the N. Atlantic; a species scarcely distinct from the European common sand-launce occurs on the Pacific side of N. America, another on the E. coast of S. Africa. On the British coasts three species are found: the greater sand-eel (<hi rend="italic">Ammodytes lanceolatus</hi>)<hi rend="italic">,</hi> distinguished by a tooth-like bicuspid prominence on the vomer; the common sand-launce (<hi rend="italic">A</hi>. <hi rend="italic">tobianus</hi>)<hi rend="italic">, </hi>from 5 to 7 in. long, with unarmed vomer, even dorsal fin, and with the integuments folded; and the southern sand-launce (<hi rend="italic">A. siculus</hi>)<hi rend="italic">, </hi>with unarmed vomer, smooth skin, and with the margins of the dorsal and anal fins undulated. The last species is common in the Mediterranean, but local farther N.

He was educated at Perth and St Andrews University, and joined the 33rd Bengal Infantry in 1856. When that regiment was disarmed at Phillour by General Nicholson during the Mutiny in 1857, he took part in the final capture of Lucknow as adjutant of the 11th Bengal Lancers. After the suppression of the Mutiny he was appointed to the Punjab Commission by Sir John Lawrence. In 1866 he was appointed district officer of Dera Ghazi Khan, and there first showed his capacity in dealing with the Baluch tribes. He was the first to break through the close-border system of Lord Lawrence, by extending British influence to the independent tribes beyond the border. In his’ hands this policy worked admirably, owing to his tact in managing the tribesmen and his genius for control. In 1876 he negotiated the treaty with the khan of Kalat, which subsequently governed the relations between Kalat and the Indian govern- ment; and in 1877 he was made agent to the governor-general in Baluchistan, an office which he held till his death. During the second Afghan War in 1878 his influence over the tribesmen was of the utmost importance, since it enabled him to keep intact the line of communications with Kandahar, and to control the tribes after the British disaster at Maiwand. For these services he was made K.C.S.I. in 1879. In 1889 he occupied the Zhob valley, a strategic advantage which opened the Gomal Pass through the Waziri country to caravan traffic. Sandeman’s system was not so well suited to the Pathan as to his Baluch neighbour. But in Baluchistan he was a pioneer, a pacificator and a successful administrator, who converted that country from a state of complete anarchy into a province as orderly as any in British India. He died at Bela, the capital of Las Bela state, on the 29th of January 1892, and there he lies buried under a handsome tomb.</p><p>See T. H.

He was educated at the “ Gymnasium Carolinum ” in the neighbouring capital Neustrelitz, and the universities of Berlin and Halle, where he took the degree of <hi rend="italic">doctor philosophiae.</hi> From 1842 to 1852 he conducted with success the school at Altstrelitz.</p><p>In 1852 he subjected Grimm’s <hi rend="italic">Deutsches Wörterbuch</hi> to a rigorous examination, and as a result published his dictionary of the German language, <hi rend="italic">Wörterbuch der deutschen Sprache</hi> (3 vols., 1859-1865). This was followed by his <hi rend="italic">Ergänzungswörterbuch der deutschen Sprache </hi>(1878-1885). Among others of his works in the same field are <hi rend="italic">Fremdwörterbuch</hi> (Leipzig, 1871; 2nd ed., 1891), <hi rend="italic">Wörterbuch der Hauptschwierigkeiten in der deutschen Sprache</hi> (1872; 22nd ed., 1892) and <hi rend="italic">Lehrbuch der deutschen Sprache für Schulen</hi> (8th ed., 1888). Sanders laid down his views in his <hi rend="italic">Katechismus der deutschen</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">Orthographie</hi> (1856; 4th ed., 1878), and was an active member of the orthographical conference in Berlin in 1876. He published a translation in verse of the <hi rend="italic">Song of Songs </hi>(1866), and wrote some poems for the young, <hi rend="italic">Heitere Kinderwelt</hi> (1868). In 1887 he founded the <hi rend="italic">Zeitschrift für die deutsche Sprache,</hi> which he conducted almost down to his death at Altstrelitz on the 11th of March 1897.</p><p>See Friedrich Diisel, <hi rend="italic">Daniel Sanders</hi> (1886; 2nd ed., 1890); A. Segert-Stein, <hi rend="italic">Daniel Sanders, ein Gedenkbuch</hi> (1897).</p><p>SANDERS, NICHOLAS (c. 1530-1581), Roman Catholic agent and historian, born about 1530 at Charlwood, Surrey, was a son of William Sanders, once sheriff of Surrey, who was descended from the Sanders of Sanderstead. . Educated at Winchester and New College, Oxford, he was elected fellow in 1548 and graduated B.C.L. in 1551. The family had strong Catholic leanings, and two of Nicholas’s sisters, who must have been much older than he was, became nuns of Sion convent before its dissolution. Nicholas was selected to deliver the oration at the reception of Cardinal Pole’s visitors by the university in 1557, and soon after Elizabeth’s accession he went to Rome where he was befriended by Pole’s confidant, Cardinal Morone; he also owed much to the generosity of Sir Francis Englefield (<hi rend="italic">q.v.</hi>)<hi rend="smallcaps">. </hi>He was ordained priest at Rome, and was, even before the end of 1550, mentioned as a likely candidate for the cardinal’s hat. For the next few years he was employed by Cardinal Hosius, the learned Polish prelate, in his efforts to check the spread of heresy in Poland, Lithuania and Prussia. In 1565, like many other English exiles, he made his headquarters at Louvain, and after a visit to the Imperial Diet at Augsburg in 1566, in attendance upon Commendone, who had been largely instrumental in the reconciliation of England with Rome in Mary’s reign, he threw himself into the literary controversy between Bishop Jewel (<hi rend="italic">q.v.</hi>) and Harding. His <hi rend="italic">De υisibili Monorchia Εcclesiae,</hi> published in 1571, contains the first narrative of the sufferings of the English Roman Catholics. Its extreme papalism and its strenuous defence of Pius V.’s bull excommunicating and deposing Elizabeth marked out Sanders for the enmity of the English government, and he retaliated with lifelong efforts to procure the deposition of Elizabeth and restoration of Roman Catholicism.</p><p>His expectations of the cardinalate were disappointed by Pius V.’s death in 1572, and Sanders spent the next few years at Madrid trying to embroil Philip II., who gave him a pension of 300 ducats, in open war with Elizabeth. “ The state of Christendom, he wrote, “ dependeth upon the stout assailing of England.” His ardent zeal was sorely tried by Philip’s cautious temperament; and Sir Thomas Stukeley’s projected Irish expedition, which Sanders was to have accompanied with the blessings and assistance of the pope, was diverted to Morocco where Stukeley was killed at the battle of Al Kasr al Kebir in 1578. Sanders, however, found his opportunity in the following year, when a force of Spaniards and Italians was de- spatched to Smerwick to assist James Fitzmaurice and his Geraldines in stirring up an Irish rebellion. The Spaniards were, however, annihilated by Lord Grey in 1580, and after nearly two years of wandering in Irish woods and bogs Sanders died of cold and starva- tion in the spring of 1581. The English exiles were disgusted at the waste of such material: “ Our Sanders," they exclaimed, “ is more to us than the whole of Ireland.” His writings have been the basis of all Roman Catholic histories of the English Reformation. The most important was his <hi rend="italic">De Origine ac Progressu schismatis Anglicani, </hi>which was continued after 1558 by Edward Rishton, and printed at Cologne in 1585; it has been often re-edited and translated, the best English edition being that by David Lewis (London, 1877). Its statements earned Sanders the nickname of Dr Slanders in England; but a considerable number of the “ slanders “ have been confirmed by corroborative evidence, and others, <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi> his story that Ann Boleyn was Henry VIII.'s own daughter, were simply borrowed by Sanders from earlier writers. It is not a more untrustworthy account than a vehement controversialist engaged in a life and death struggle might be expected to write of his theological antagonists.</p><p>See Lewis’s <hi rend="italic">Introduction</hi> (1877); <hi rend="italic">Calendars of Irish, Foreign and Spanish State Papers, and of the Carew MSS.;</hi> Knox’s <hi rend="italic">Letters of Cardinal Allen;</hi> T.
