<p><span class="font1">bury and of the liberties of the English church. He claimed authority in Wales and Scotland, and he refused to consecrate&nbsp;Thurstan as archbishop of York because the latter prelate&nbsp;declined to profess obedience to the archbishop of Canterbury.&nbsp;This step involved him in a quarrel with the Papacy, and he&nbsp;visited Rome, but was unable to obtain an interview with pope&nbsp;Paschal IL, who had left the city. In spite of peremptory&nbsp;orders from Paschal’s successors, Gelasius II. and Calixtus II.,&nbsp;the archbishop still refused to consecrate Thurstan, and the&nbsp;dispute was unsettled when he died on the 20th of October 1122.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RALPH DE GUADER, earl of Norfolk (fl. 1070), was the son of a Norman who had held high positions in East Anglia,&nbsp;perhaps that of earl, in the reign of Edward the Confessor&nbsp;(</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">c.</span><span class="font1"> 1055). His son Ralph fought on the Norman side at Hastings,&nbsp;and was made earl of Norfolk by William the Conqueror. In&nbsp;1075 the king’s refusal to sanction his marriage with the sister&nbsp;of Roger, earl of Hereford, caused the two earls to revolt. They&nbsp;were easily defeated, though Ralph sent to Denmark for ships&nbsp;and went there himself to fetch them. Ralph forfeited his&nbsp;English lands, and took refuge in Brittany on his wife’s estate.&nbsp;In 1076, having plotted against Duke Hoel of Brittany, he was&nbsp;besieged at Dol, and the Conqueror came to Hoel’s aid; but&nbsp;Ralph finally made his peace. Both he and his wife took part&nbsp;in the first crusade (1099), and died on the road to Palestine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RALPH OF COGGESHALL (d. after 1227), English chronicler, was at first a monk and afterwards sixth abbot (1207-1218) of&nbsp;Coggeshall, an Essex foundation of the Cistercian order. Ralph&nbsp;himself tells us these facts; and that his resignation of the&nbsp;abbacy was made against the wishes of the brethren, in consequence of his bad health. ' He took up and continued a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chronicon&nbsp;Anglicanum</span><span class="font1"> belonging to his house; the original work begins&nbsp;at 1066, his own share at 1187. He hoped to reach the year&nbsp;1227, but his autograph copy breaks off three years earlier.&nbsp;Ralph makes no pretensions to be a literary artist. Where he&nbsp;had a written authority before him he was content to reproduce&nbsp;even the phraseology of his original. At other times he strings&nbsp;together in chronological order, without any links of connexion,&nbsp;the anecdotes which he gathered from chance visitors. Unlike&nbsp;“ Benedictus ’’ and Roger of Hoveden, he makes little use of&nbsp;documents; only three letters are quoted in his work. On&nbsp;the other hand, the corrections and erasures of the autograph&nbsp;show that he took pains to verify his details; and his informants are sometimes worthy of exceptional confidence. Thus&nbsp;he vouches Richard’s chaplain Anselm for the story of the&nbsp;king’s capture by Leopold of Austria. The tone of the chronicle&nbsp;is usually dispassionate; but the original text contained some&nbsp;personal strictures upon Prince John, which are reproduced&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">in </span><span class="font1">Roger of Wendover. The admiration with which Ralph&nbsp;regarded Henry II. is attested by his edition of Ralph Niger’s&nbsp;chronicle; here, under the year 1161, he replies to the intemperate criticisms of the original author. On Richard I.&nbsp;the abbot passes a judicious verdict, admitting the great&nbsp;qualities of that king, but arguing that his character degenerated. Towards John alone Ralph is uniformly hostile; as a&nbsp;Cistercian and an adherent of the Mandeville family he could&nbsp;hardly be otherwise. Ralph refers in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chrοnicοn </span><span class="font1">(</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">s.a.</span><span class="font1"> 1091)&nbsp;to a book of visions and miracles which he had compiled, but&nbsp;this is no longer extant. He also wrote a continuation of&nbsp;Niger’s chronicle, extending from 1162 to 1178 (printed in R.&nbsp;Anstruther’s edition of Niger, London, 1851), and short annals&nbsp;from 1066 to 1223.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The autograph manuscript of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chrοnicon Anglicanum</span><span class="font0"> is to be found in the British Museum (Cotton, Vespasian D.

<p><span class="font1">RAM, PIERRE FRANÇOIS XAVIER DE (1804-1865), Belgian churchman and historian, was bom at Louvain in&nbsp;1804. He took orders early, and was appointed professor of&nbsp;poetry at the seminary of Malines, and archiviste of the diocese.&nbsp;During the years immediately before the revolution of 1830,&nbsp;Ram, who was much influenced by Lamennais, was active in&nbsp;bringing about a coalition of Liberals and Catholics against the&nbsp;Dutch government established by the Powers on the fall of&nbsp;Napoleon, and in endeavouring to give a democratic character&nbsp;to the policy of his church. He declined to stand as a member&nbsp;of the Belgian assembly, and applied himself wholly to teaching&nbsp;and to editing or composing historical books. As professor of&nbsp;philosophy at Malines he succeeded in bringing about the&nbsp;foundation of the Catholic university, which was transferred to&nbsp;Louvain in 1834. He was rector of the university till his death&nbsp;in 1865.</span></p>

The butting propensities&nbsp;of the ram have given rise to the many transferred senses of the&nbsp;word, chief and earliest of which is that of a battering imple-ment used before the days of cannon for beating in the gates&nbsp;and breaching the walls of fortified places (see Battering&nbsp;Ram). Many technical uses of the term have been developed&nbsp;from this, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font1"> the weight of a pile-driving machine, the piston&nbsp;of a hydraulic press and other machines or portions of machines&nbsp;worked by water power (see Hydraulics).

<p><span class="font1">RAMADÃN, the month of the Mahommedan year in which absolute fasting from dawn to sunset is required. The law&nbsp;is laid down in Koran ii. 179-184, and is as follows: A fast&nbsp;had always been a part of religion. In Islam it was to fall&nbsp;in this month because in it the Koran was revealed, and it&nbsp;was holier than the others. It was to hegin when the new&nbsp;moon was actually seen, and last until sight of the next new .&nbsp;moon; to extend each day from the time when a white thread&nbsp;could be distinguished from a black one and until nightfall;&nbsp;to be absolute in that time as to food, drink, women. The&nbsp;daytime should be passed, by preference, in retreat </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(i 'tikāf)&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">in the mosque in pious exercises; during the night all otherwise lawful things to be lawful. The sick and those on a&nbsp;journey might be excused, but should fast thereafter an&nbsp;equivalent number of days. Unexcused breaking of the fast&nbsp;might be atoned for by feeding of the poor. The last ten days&nbsp;of the month are regarded as especially sacred; these Mahomet&nbsp;himself used to pass in retreat. In the course of them falls the&nbsp;“ Night of Decree,” or “ of Power ” (Koran xc. 1), but its&nbsp;exact date is not known. On it intercourse between heaven&nbsp;and earth is peculiarly open, and many wonders take place.&nbsp;Fasting in Ramaḍān is reckoned one of the five pillars, or&nbsp;absolute requirements, of Islam. It is followed by the Lesser&nbsp;Festival, the first three days of the month Shauwal (see&nbsp;Bairam). Naturally, during it all the activities of life are&nbsp;reduced to a minimum, and those who can afford it turn night&nbsp;into day as much as possible.</span></p>
