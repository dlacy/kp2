In his diſeourſes he would probably have been too laviſh of his wit, if he had not been cautioned againſt it by a judicious courtier. “ Continue (ſaid he) to preach as you do. We will hear you with pleaſure as long as you reaſon wiſh us ; but avoid wit. We value the wit contained in two verſes of a ſong more than all that is contained in moſt of the fermons in Lent.”</p><p>Relpectιng the delivery of fermons, he entertained an opinion quite oppoſite to the eſtabliſhed practice of his countrymen. In France it was cuſtomary not to read fermons from ſhe pulpit, but to recite them from τnemoιy. TTιis he conſidered as a laborious taſk not compenſated by any advantages. On the contrary, he was of opinion that reading fermons was preferable.— The preacher, wuſh his diſcourſe before him, could read it w<hi rend="sup">r</hi>ith eaſe, free from that timidity and embar-raſſment which frequently attends the act of recollection ; and he would fave a conſiderable time which is •uſually ſpent in committing it to memory. In theſe ſentiment» many will not be diſpoſed to acquieſce : but, «without pretending to determine the queſtion, it may be aſſerted, that a ſermon, whether read Or recited, if ſpoken in a ſerious manner, and with proper inflections and tones of voice, will produce all ſhe effects, for wſhich a ſermon is calculated.</p><p>De la Rue died at Paris on ſhe 27th of May 1725, at the age of 82.</p><p>He w<hi rend="sup">r</hi>as as amiable in ſociety as he w<hi rend="sup">,</hi>as venerable in the pulpit.

He charmed his ſuperiors by his wit, and his inferiors by his affability. Though living ainidſt ſhe buſtle of the world, he was always prepared for the ſo-iitude cf the cloſet and the retreat of the cloiſter.
