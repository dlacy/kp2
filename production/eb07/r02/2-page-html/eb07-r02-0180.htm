<p><span class="font3">halls, in the midst of which some aged trees have taken root in the soft green turf which now supplies the place of&nbsp;the pavement of costly marble and rich mosaic. One of&nbsp;these halls, the famous Cella Soleares, held 1600 seats of&nbsp;polished marble,</span><span class="font2">@@</span><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> and was entirely covered witll a flat roof&nbsp;of stone, supported by cancellated work of brass or copper,&nbsp;which, from the resemblance to the lacing of a sandal, is&nbsp;supposed to have given the hall its designation. On the&nbsp;western side of the ruins there are the remains of a rotondo,&nbsp;and a great number of smaller divisions of all sizes and&nbsp;forms. This enormous fabric was adorned with an immense number of statues and paintings. The celebrated&nbsp;Farnese Hercules, the Glycon, the bull, now in the museum at Naples, the Torso Belvidere, the Flora, the Cal-lypigean Venus, together with many other statues, columns, bas reliefs, &amp;c., were all found in these ruins. The&nbsp;thermae and palace of Titus were built with the materials, and on the site of the buildings and pleasure grounds,&nbsp;of Nero’s golden house. They were finished or enlarged&nbsp;by Trajan, and afterwards repaired and embellished by Hadrian. They appear to have been of remarkable extent&nbsp;and magnificence. Part of the theatre of one of the temples, and of one of the great halls, still remains above, and&nbsp;many vaults and long galleries under ground. Some of&nbsp;these subterraneous apartments are curiously painted, and&nbsp;the ceiling of one of them contains some most exquisite&nbsp;specimens of paintings in arabesque, which afforded a model to the genius of Raphael, and enabled him to restore an&nbsp;art which had been lost for so many centuries.</span><span class="font2">@@</span><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> In the&nbsp;time of Leo X. some excavations were made, and the famous group of the Laocoon was discovered in one of the&nbsp;halls, and several pillars of granite, alabaster, and porphyry,&nbsp;have since been found in various partial researches. In&nbsp;another part of the Esquiline Hill stand the Sette Salle,&nbsp;nine halls of one hundred feet in length, by fifteen in&nbsp;breadth, and twenty in depth, which have evidently been&nbsp;immense reservoirs of water, to supply the baths of Titus,&nbsp;and occasionally the enormous arena of the Coliseum, when&nbsp;naval engagements were represented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The thermae </span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font3">Diocletian, which are scattered over the summit of the Quirinal and Viminal hills, are said to&nbsp;have surpassed all the thermae of ancient Rome in extent&nbsp;and splendour. One of the circular halls has been converted into a granary, another into the church of St. Bernard. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">xystum penacotheca,</span><span class="font3"> or great covered hall of&nbsp;the thermae, has been transformed into the church of St.&nbsp;Maria degli angeli, and still retains much of its original&nbsp;grandeur. It is 350 feet in length, 80 in breadth, and 90&nbsp;in height. It was paved and incrusted with the finest marble by Benedict XIV. The vaulted roof is supported by&nbsp;sixteen Corinthian columns, eight of which are ancient, and&nbsp;are formed of one vast piece of Egyptian granite. This&nbsp;noble edifice is adorned with a variety of paintings ; among&nbsp;others, with the martyrdom of St. Sebastian, by Domeni-chino ; and the circular vestibule contains the monuments&nbsp;of Salvator Rosa and Carlo Maratti.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Seven bridges formerly conducted over the Tiber to the Janiculum and the Vatican Mount. Three of these, the&nbsp;Pons Sublicius, the Pons Palatinus, and the Pons Triumphalis, were long ago destroyed. Those which now remain are the Bridges of the Island, the Ponte Sisto, and&nbsp;the Ponte San Angelo. Out of Rome there is only one&nbsp;bridge over the Tiber, the famous Milvian or Æmilian&nbsp;bridge, now corrupted into Ponte Molle. Here the ambassadors of the Allobroges were seized by the vigilance of&nbsp;Cicero ;</span><span class="font2">@@<sup>3</sup></span><span class="font3"> and here was fought the eventful battle in which&nbsp;Constantine defeated Maxentius. About three miles from</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font3">Rome, the Anio, now the Te verone, is crossed by the Ponte Lamentano, formerly the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pons Nomentanus,</span><span class="font3"> beyond which&nbsp;rises the broad green height of Monte Sagro, the famous </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mons&nbsp;Sacer,</span><span class="font3"> to which the Roman army and people twice retired&nbsp;from the tyranny of the Patricians.</span><span class="font2">@@</span><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> The Ponte Salario,&nbsp;a very singular and picturesque structure, which also crosses&nbsp;the Anio, about three miles beyond the gate of the same&nbsp;name, was the scene of thc celebrated combat between&nbsp;Manlius Torquatus and the gigantic Gaul.</span><span class="font2">@@</span><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> The ground&nbsp;on the other side of it is supposed to be that on which Hannibal encamped during the few days he remained before&nbsp;Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Rome contains the ruins of a number of triumphal arches. The most important of these are the arches of Titus, of&nbsp;Septimius Severus, and of Constantine. The arch of Titus&nbsp;is the oldest triumphal arch now existing in Rome. It is&nbsp;peculiarly rich in sculpture. The interior is decorated with&nbsp;two fine bas reliefs, representing on one side Titus in his&nbsp;car of triumph, and, on the other, the spoils of the temple&nbsp;of Jerusalem and the captive Jews. It was greatly mutilated, but has been recently restored. The arch of Severus,&nbsp;though more entire, is much less beautiful. The arch of&nbsp;Constantine is thought by far the most noble of the triumphal arches of Rome, but its columns, its beautiful sculptured medallions and bas reliefs, have evidently been pilfered from one of the triumphal arches of Trajan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Of all the stupendous aqueducts of ancient Rome, two alone remain even in ruins, the Martian and the Claudian. The&nbsp;former, which was built by Quintus Martius Rex the prætor,&nbsp;125 years </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">b. c.,</span><span class="font3"> conveyed to Rome three different waters in&nbsp;three distinct channels; the latter was built by the emperor&nbsp;Claudius, and conveyed two waters to Rome, the aqua&nbsp;Claudia, and the Anio vetus. The first was conveyed a&nbsp;distance of thirty-five, the last of sixty-two miles. There&nbsp;is reason to believe that the aqueducts were destroyed by&nbsp;Totila, but notwithstanding their destruction, Rome is still&nbsp;tlle city in the world the best supplied with water, three&nbsp;popes having conducted to it three noble streams.</span><span class="font2">@@</span><span class="font3"><sup>6</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Rome alone, of all the cities of the world, boasts those sublime monuments of antiquity, the obelisks of Egypt.</span><span class="font2">@@<sup>7</sup></span><span class="font3">&nbsp;The most important of these are the obelisk that stands in&nbsp;the Piazza del Popolo ; it was the first ever seen in Rome,&nbsp;and was brought from Egypt by Augustus, and placed in&nbsp;the Circus Maximus, where it served as the gnomon of a&nbsp;dial ; the obelisk in the grand piazza of St. Peter’s, brought&nbsp;from Egypt by Caligula ; the obelisk in front of the Lateran church, the largest of them all, transported from Egypt&nbsp;by Constantius ; the obelisk mentioned by Pliny, which&nbsp;was brought to Rome by Augustus, and erected in the&nbsp;Campus Martius; it now stands on Monte Citorio; and the&nbsp;obelisk which stood in the circus of Sallust, and now crowns&nbsp;the lofty summit of the Pincian hill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Roman tombs were distinguished by their impressive grandeur and magnificence. All along the long line of the Appian way are the mouldering remains of the ruined and blackening sepulchres,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“ Where Cæsars, heroes, peasants, hermits lie,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Blended in dust together.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But among the immense number of proud sepulchres of the most distinguished Romans which crowded that “ Queen&nbsp;of ways,” all, with a very few exceptions, are unknown.&nbsp;About sixty years ago the tomb of the Scipios was brought&nbsp;to light, but “ the Scipios tomb contains no ashes now.”&nbsp;Exactly on the opposite side of the road to it is the sepulchre of the Maniglia family. The tomb of Cecilia Metella,&nbsp;tile daughter of Metellus, and “ the wealthiest Roman’s</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
