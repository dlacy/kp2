<p><span class="font0">Professor Angelo Mosso was led by observation of'the beneficial effects of carbon dioxide at low atmospheric pressure to attribute mountain sickness to lack of carbon dioxide, a condition&nbsp;which he designated by the word “ acapnia. ” When impure&nbsp;air is vitiated, not only by deficiency of oxygen, but also by&nbsp;carbon dioxide, the carbon dioxide causes panting, which not&nbsp;only gives warning of any danger, but prevents the alveolar&nbsp;oxygen percentage from falling in the way it would do if the&nbsp;carbon dioxide were absent. In this way the carbon dioxide&nbsp;greatly lessens the danger. To give instances, air progressively&nbsp;and very highly vitiated by respiration is much less likely to&nbsp;cause danger if the carbon dioxide is not artificially absorbed,&nbsp;and not nearly so dangerous as the great diminution of atmospheric pressure (and consequently of oxygen pressure) which&nbsp;occurs in a very high balloon ascent. Indeed the dangers of&nbsp;a very high balloon ascent are notorious, and a number of&nbsp;deaths or very narrow escapes are on record.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Just as oxygen forms a dissociable compound with the haemoglobin of the blood, so does carbon dioxide form dissociable compounds. One of* these compounds appears to be&nbsp;with haemoglobin itself, and another is sodium bicarbonate,&nbsp;which is far more easily dissociated in the blood than in a&nbsp;simple watery solution, owing to the presence of proteid and&nbsp;possibly other substances which act as weak acids and thus&nbsp;help the dissociation process. The whole of the carbon dioxide can therefore be removed from the blood by a vacuum&nbsp;pump, just as pie whole of the oxygen can. Venous blood&nbsp;contains roughly speaking about 40 volumes of carbon dioxide per 100 of blood, and arterial blood about 34 volumes.&nbsp;Of this carbon dioxide only about 3 volumes can be in free solution, the rest being loosely combined. The conveyance of carbon&nbsp;dioxide from the blood to the lungs is thus readily intelligible,&nbsp;as well as the fact that any increase or diminution of the pressure of carbon dioxide in thc alveolar air will naturally lead&nbsp;to a damming back or increased liberation of carbon dioxide&nbsp;from the blood, and that by forced breathing carbon dioxide&nbsp;can be washed out of the blood to such an extent that a prolonged cessation of natural breathing </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(apnoea)</span><span class="font0"> follows, since&nbsp;even in the venous blood the partial pressure of carbon dioxide has become too low to excite the Tespiratoiy<sup>r</sup> centre.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It will be evident from the foregoing that in order to supply efficiently the respiratory requirements of the tissues not only&nbsp;must the breathing, but also the circulation, be suitably regulated. In hard muscular work the consumption of oxygen&nbsp;and output of carbon dioxide may be increased eight or ten&nbsp;times beyond those of rest. Unless, therefore, the blood&nbsp;supply to the active tissues were correspondingly increased,&nbsp;deficiency of oxygen would at once arise, since the amount&nbsp;of oxygen carried by a given volume of the arterial blood is&nbsp;very limited, as already explained. It is known that the&nbsp;supply of blood to each organ is always increased during its&nbsp;activity. This increase can, for instance, readily be seen&nbsp;and measured in the case of contracting muscles or secreting&nbsp;glands; and the volume and frequency of the pulse are greatly&nbsp;increased during muscular work. But while it is evident&nbsp;enough that the flow of blood through the body is determined&nbsp;in accordance with the metabolic activities of each tissue,&nbsp;our knowledge is as yet very scanty as to the means by which&nbsp;this determination is brought about. Probably, however,&nbsp;carbon dioxide may be nearly as important a factor in the&nbsp;regulation of the circulation as in that of breathing. Just as&nbsp;the rate of breathing was formerly. supposed to determine,&nbsp;and not to be determined by, the fundamental metabolic&nbsp;processes of the body, so the circulation was supposed to be&nbsp;another independent determining factor; and under the&nbsp;influence of these mechanistic conceptions the direction of&nbsp;investigation into the phenomena of respiration and circulation has been largely diverted to side issues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Since the circulation, no less than the breathing, is concerned in the supply of oxygen to and removal of carbon dioxide from the tissues, it can readily be understood that&nbsp;defective circulation, such as occurs, for instance, in uncompensated valvular affections of the heart, may affect the&nbsp;breathing and hinder the normal respiratory exchange. Conversely, also, defects in the aeration or oxygen-carrying power&nbsp;of the blood may be compensated for by increase in the circulation. For instance, in the very common condition known&nbsp;as anaemia, where the percentage of haemoglobin, and consequently the oxygen-carrying power of the blood, is often&nbsp;reduced to a third or less, the respiratory disturbances may&nbsp;be so slight that the patient is going about his or her ordinary&nbsp;work. A miner suffering from the now well-known “ worm-disease,” or ankylostomiasis </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.),</span><span class="font0"> may be working underground, or a housemaid suffering from chlorosis may be doing&nbsp;her work, with only a third of the normal oxygen-carrying&nbsp;power of the blood. There seems to be no doubt that in such&nbsp;cases an increased rate of blood circulation compensates for the&nbsp;diminished oxygen-carrying power of the blood. It is well&nbsp;known that at high altitudes a gradual process of adaptation&nbsp;to the low pressure occurs, and the shortness of breath and&nbsp;other symptoms experienced for the first few days gradually&nbsp;become less and less. This adaptation is partly, at least,&nbsp;due to a marked increase in the percentage of haemoglobin in&nbsp;the blood, though probably circulatory and perhaps other compensatory changes are also involved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In connexion with respiration the action of certain poisons is of great interest. One of these, carbon monoxide, is of very&nbsp;common occurrence, and causes numerous cases of poisoning.&nbsp;Like oxygen, it has the property of combining with the haemoglobin of the blood, but its affinity for haemoglobin is far more&nbsp;strong than that of oxygen. In presence of air containing as&nbsp;little as -05% of carbon monoxide, the haemoglobin will become&nbsp;about equally shared between oxygen and carbon monoxide,&nbsp;so that, since air contains 20.9% of oxygen, the affinity of&nbsp;carbon monoxide for haemoglobin may be regarded as about&nbsp;400 times greater than that of oxygen. The blood of a person&nbsp;breathing even a small percentage of carbon monoxide may&nbsp;thus become gradually saturated to a dangerous extent, since&nbsp;the haemoglobin engaged by the carbon monoxide is for the&nbsp;time useless as an oxygen-carrier. Air containing more than&nbsp;about 0.1% of carbon monoxide is thus more or less dangerous&nbsp;if breathed for long; but the blood completely recovers in the&nbsp;course of a few hours if pure air is again breathed. The&nbsp;poisonous action of carbon monoxide can be abolished by placing&nbsp;the animal exposed to it in oxygen at an excess pressure of&nbsp;about an atmosphere. The reason for this is that, in consequence&nbsp;of the increased partial pressure of the oxygen, the amount of&nbsp;this gas in free solution in the blood is greatly increased in&nbsp;accordance with Dalton’s law, and becomes sufficient to supply&nbsp;the tissues with oxygen quite independently of the haemoglobin.&nbsp;Even at ordinary atmospheric pressure the extra oxygen&nbsp;dissolved in the blood when pure oxygen is breathed is of considerable importance. Carbon-monoxide poisoning is the chief&nbsp;cause of death in colliery explosions and fires, and the sole cause&nbsp;in poisoning by fighting gas and fuel gas of various kinds. Its&nbsp;presence in dangerous proportions may be readily detected with&nbsp;the help of a small bird, mouse or other small warm-blooded&nbsp;animal. In such animals the respiratory exchange is so rapid&nbsp;that symptoms of carbon-monoxide poisoning are shown far&nbsp;more quickly than in man. The small animal can thus be employed in mines, &amp;c., to indicate danger from carbon monoxide.&nbsp;A lamp is useless for this purpose. There are various other&nbsp;poisons, such as nitrites, chlorates, dinitrobenzol, &amp;c., which&nbsp;act by disabling the haemoglobin, and so cutting off the oxygen&nbsp;supply to the tissues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Between the air in the air-cells of the lungs and the blood of the lung capillaries there intervenes nothing but a layer of&nbsp;very thin, flattened cells, and until recently it was very generally&nbsp;believed that it was by diffusion alone that oxygen passes inwards&nbsp;and carbonic acid outwards through this layer. Similar simple&nbsp;physical explanations of processes of secretion and absorption&nbsp;through living cells have, however, turned out to be incorrect in&nbsp;the case of other organs. It is known, moreover, that in the&nbsp;case of the swimming-bladder of fishes oxygen is secreted into</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
