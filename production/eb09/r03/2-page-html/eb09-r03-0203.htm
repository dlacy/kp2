<p><span class="font0">the Turks and Poles. Near Ribnik and elsewhere were salt-mines which supplied all the wants of the Transdanubian provinces ; there&nbsp;were considerable copper mines at Maidan ; and iron was worked&nbsp;near Tirgovist. The Gipsy community was bound to bring fifteen&nbsp;pounds weight of gold from the washings of the ArgLsh. The boiars&nbsp;were many of them wealthy, but the common people were so ground&nbsp;down with taxation that “ of their ancient Roman valour only the&nbsp;name remained.” To avoid the extortion of their rulers numbers&nbsp;had emigrated to Transylvania and even to the Turkish provinces.&nbsp;The principal Walachian city was Bucharest (Bucurest), containing&nbsp;a population of about 50,000 ; but, except for two large “bans” or&nbsp;merchants’ halls built by Brancovan and his predecessor, and the&nbsp;recently-erected palace, which had a marble staircase and a fine&nbsp;garden, the houses were of wood. The other principal towns were&nbsp;Tirgovist, the old capital, Cernetz, Fokshani, supplied by Brancovan&nbsp;with an aqueduct, Ploiesti, Ghierghitza, Rusi di Vede, and Krajova,&nbsp;the capital of the banat of that name, where a fine han had also been&nbsp;built. At Cimpulungu was a great annual fair. The dress of the&nbsp;men was thoroughly Turkish except for their lambskin caps, that of&nbsp;the women half-Greek half-Turkish. The houses were scrupulously&nbsp;clean and strewn with sweet herbs. Del Chiaro notices the great&nbsp;imitative capacity of the race, both artistic and mechanical. A&nbsp;Walachian in Venice had copied several of the pictures there with&nbsp;great skill ; the copper-plates and wood engravings for the new&nbsp;press were executed by native hands. The Walachians imitated&nbsp;every kind of Turkish and European manufacture ; and, though the&nbsp;boiars imported finer glass from Venice and Bohemia, a glass&nbsp;manufactory had been established near Tirgovist which produced&nbsp;a better quality than the Polish. From the Bucharest press, besides&nbsp;a variety of ecclesiastical books, there were issued in the Rouman&nbsp;tongue a translation of a French work entitled “The Maximsof&nbsp;the Orientals” and “The Romance of Alexander the Great.” In&nbsp;1700 Brancovan had a map of the country made and a copperplate engraving of it executed at Padua.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The prosperity of Walachia, however, under its “Golden Bey,” as Brancovan was known at Stamboul, only increased the Turkish&nbsp;exactions. In 1701 the tribute was increased to 80,500 purses of&nbsp;500 florins each. In 1703 the voivode was summoned in person to&nbsp;Adrianople, and again must resort to extraordinary means to&nbsp;mollify the Divan. Shortly after, the Walachians were called on to&nbsp;supply masons, carpenters, and other workmen for the fortification&nbsp;of Bender, and, though these and other demands were punctually&nbsp;met and the increased tribute regularly paid, the sultan finally&nbsp;resolved on the removal of his too prosperous vassal. Brancovan&nbsp;was accused of secret correspondence with the emperor, the czar,&nbsp;the king of Poland, and the Venetian republic, of betraying the&nbsp;Porte’s secrets, of preferring Tirgovist to Bucharest as a residence, of&nbsp;acquiring lands and palaces in Transylvania, of keeping agents at&nbsp;Venice and Vienna, in both of which cities he had invested large&nbsp;sums, and of striking gold coins with his effigy, one of which, with&nbsp;the legend Constantinvs bλssaraba de brancovan d. g. voevoda&nbsp;et princep8 valachiæ transalpine·;, and having on the reverse&nbsp;the crowned shield of Walachia containing a raven holding a cross&nbsp;in its beak between a moon and a star, is engraved by Del Chiaro.&nbsp;They were of 2, 3, and 10 ducats weight. A capidji pasha arrived&nbsp;at BucharestonApril4, 1714, and proclaimed Brancovan “mazil,”&nbsp;i.β., deposed. He was conducted to Constantinople and beheaded,&nbsp;together with his four sons. A scion of the rival Cantacuzcnian&nbsp;family was elected by the pasha’s orders, and he, after exhausting&nbsp;the principality for the benefit of the Divan, was in turn deposed&nbsp;and executed in 1716.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">From this period onwards the Porte introduced a new system with regard to its Walachian vassals. The line of national princes ceases.&nbsp;The office of voivode or Iiospodar was sold to the highest bidder at&nbsp;Stamboul, to be farmed out from a purely mercenary point of view.&nbsp;The princes who now succeeded one another in rapid succession were&nbsp;mostly Greeks from the Fanar quarter of Constantinople who had&nbsp;served the palace in the quality of dragoman, or held some other&nbsp;court appointment. They were nominated by imperial firman&nbsp;without a shadow of free election, and were deposed and transferred&nbsp;from one principality to another, executed or reappointed, like so&nbsp;many pashas. Like pashas they rarely held their office more than&nbsp;three years, it being the natural policy of the Porte to multiply&nbsp;such lucrative nominations. The same Iiospodar was often&nbsp;reappointed again and again as he succeeded in raising the sum&nbsp;necessary to buy back his title. Constantine Mavrocordato was in&nbsp;this way Iiospodar of Walachia at six different times, and paid on&nbsp;one occasion as much as a million lion-dollars for the office. The&nbsp;princes thus imposed on the country were generally men of intelligence and culture. Nicholas Mavrocordato, the first of the series,&nbsp;was himself the author of a Greek work on duties, and maintained at his court Demeter Prokopios of Aloschopolis, who wrote a&nbsp;review of Greek literature during the 17th and beginning of the 18th&nbsp;centuries. Constantine Alavrocordato was the author of really&nbsp;liberal reforms. He introduced an “urbarium” for the peasants,&nbsp;Iimitingthe days of “angaria,” or forced labour for the landlord, to&nbsp;twenty-four, and in 1747 decreed the abolition of serfdom. But&nbsp;the new system could not but be productive of grinding oppression,&nbsp;and the swarms of “hungry Greekliugs” who accompanied the&nbsp;Fanariote rulers from Stamboul made their rule doubly hateful.&nbsp;Numbers of the peasantry emigrated, and the population rapidly&nbsp;diminished. In 1745 the number of tax-paying families, which a&nbsp;few years before had amounted to 147,000, had sunk to 70,000.&nbsp;Yet the taxes were continually on the increase, and the hospodar&nbsp;Scarlatii Ghika (1758-61), though he tried to win some popularity&nbsp;by the removal of Turkish settlers and the abolition of the&nbsp;“ vakarit,” or tax on cattle and homes, which was peculiarly hateful&nbsp;to the peasantry, raised the total amount of taxation to 25,000,000&nbsp;lion-dollars. The Turks meantime maintained their iron grip on&nbsp;the country by holding on the Walachian bank of the Danube the&nbsp;fortresses of Giurgevo, Turnul, and Orsova, with the surrounding&nbsp;districts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But the tide of Ottoman dominion was ebbing fast. Already, by the peace of Passarovitz (Pojarevatz) in 1718, the banat of Krajova&nbsp;had been ceded to the emperor, though by the peace of Belgrade&nbsp;in 1739 it was recovered by the Porte for its Walachian vassal. In&nbsp;1769 the Russian general Romanzoif occupied the principality, the&nbsp;bishops and clergy took an oath of fidelity to the empress Catherine,&nbsp;and a deputation of boiars followed. The liberties of the country&nbsp;were guaranteed, taxation reformed, and in 1772 the negotiations at&nbsp;Fokshani between Rqssia and the Porte broke down because the&nbsp;czarina’s representatives insisted on the sultan’s recognition of&nbsp;the independence of Walachia and AIoldavia under an European&nbsp;guarantee. By the treaty of Kutshuk Kaimardji, concluded in&nbsp;1774, Russia consented to hand back the principalities to the&nbsp;sultan, but by Art. xvi. several stipulations were made in favour&nbsp;of the Walachians and AIoldaviaus. The people of the principalities were to enjoy all the privileges that they had possessed&nbsp;under AIahomet IV.; they were to bo freed from tribute for two&nbsp;years, as some compensation for the ruinous effects of the last war ;&nbsp;they were to pay a moderate tribute ; the agents of Walachia and&nbsp;AIoldavia at Constantinople were to enjoy the rights of nations, and&nbsp;the Russian minister at the Porte should on occasion watch over the&nbsp;interests of the principalities. The stipulations of the treaty of&nbsp;Kutshuk Kaimardji, though deficient in precision (the Walachians,&nbsp;for instance, had no authentic record of the privileges enjoyed under&nbsp;AIahomet IV.), formed the basis of the future liberties in both principalities ; and, as from this period onwards Walachian history is&nbsp;closely connected with that of AIoldavia, it may be convenient&nbsp;before continuing this review to turn to the earlier history of the&nbsp;sister, principality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Moldavia.—</span><span class="font0">The mention of Vlachs on the borders of Galicia in 1160 (Nie. Chon., p. 171) gives just ground for believing that a&nbsp;Rouman population existed in AIoldavia at least as early as the first&nbsp;half of the 12th century. Under the successive domination, how’-ever, of Petchenegs, Cumans, and Tatars, it occupied as yet a subordinate position. It was not till 1352 that tho Tatars, already&nbsp;weakened by Polish assaults on the Podolian side, were expelled from&nbsp;this Cumanian region by tho Transylvanian voivode Andreas&nbsp;Laszkovich. It is in fact to the period immediately succeeding this&nbsp;event that the first establishment of an independent Rouman state&nbsp;in AIoldavia is referred by the concurrent testimony of AIoldavian,&nbsp;Russian, and Hungarian sources.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">According to the native traditional account, as first given by tho AIoldavian chroniclers of the 17th and 18th centuries (Grigorie&nbsp;Urechie and AIiron Costin), Dragoshthe son of Bogdan, the founder&nbsp;of the new principality, emigrated with his followers towards the&nbsp;end of the 14th century from the Hungarian district of AIarmaros&nbsp;in the North Carpathians. The story is related with various&nbsp;fabulous accompaniments. From the aurochs </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">{zimbru),</span><span class="font0"> in pursuit&nbsp;of which Dragosh first arrived on the banks of the AIolda, is derived&nbsp;the ox-head of the AIoldavian national arms, and from his favourite&nbsp;hound who perished in the waters the name of the river. From&nbsp;the Hungarian and Russian sources, which are somewhat more&nbsp;precise, the date of the arrival of Dragioeh, who otherwise appears&nbsp;as Bogdan, in AIoldavia appears to have been 1359, and his departure from AIarmaros was carried out in defiance of his Hungarian&nbsp;suzerain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the agreement arrived at between King Louis of Hungary and the emperor Charles IV. in 1372, the voivodate of AIoldavia was&nbsp;recognized as a dependency of the crow<sup>τ</sup>n of St Stephen. The overlordship over the country was, however, contested by the king of&nbsp;Poland, and their rival claims were a continual source of dispute&nbsp;betw<sup>,</sup>een the two kingdoms. In 1412 a remarkable agreement was&nbsp;arrived at between Sigismund, in his quality of king of Hungaι∙y, and&nbsp;King Jagietto of Poland, by which both parties consented to postpone&nbsp;the question of suzerainship in AIoldavia. Should, however, the&nbsp;Turks invade the country, the Polish and Hungarian forces were to&nbsp;unite in expelling them, the voivode was to be deposed, and the&nbsp;AIoldavian territories divided between the allies. During the first&nbsp;half of the 15th century Polish influence was preponderant, and it&nbsp;was customary for the voivodes of AIoldavia to do homage to tho&nbsp;king of Poland at Kameniec or Snyatin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1456 the voivode Peter, alarmed at the progress of the Turks,</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
