Particular rights are ſuch as belong to certain individuals or orders of men, and not to others. The rights of kings, of mailers, of huſhands, of wives, and, in ſhort, all the rights which originate in fociety, are particular. General rights are thoſe which belong to the ſpecies collectively. Such are our rights to the vegetable produce of the earth, and to the fleſh of animals for food, though about the origin of this latter right there has been much diverfity of opinion, which we have noticed in another place. (See Theology, Parti, ſect. 2d). If the vegetable produce of the earth be included under the general rights of mankind, it is plain that he is guilty of wrong who leaves any conſiderable portion of land waſte merely for his own amuſement : he is leſſening the common llock of proviſion which Providence intended to diſtribute among the ſpecies. On this principle it would not be eaſy to vindicate certain regulations· re -ſpecting game, as well as ſome other monopolies which are protected by the municipal laws of moſt countries. Mr Paley, by juſt reaſoning, has eſtabliſhed this conclu-fion, “ that nothing ought to be ‘made excluſive property which can be conveniently enjoyed in common.” An equal diviſion of land, however, the dream of ſome viſionary reformers, would be injurious to the general rights of mankind, as it may be demonſtrated, that it would leſſen the common ſtock of proviſions, by laying every man under the neceſſity of being his own weaver, tailor, ſhoemaker, ſmith, and carpenter, as well as ploughman, miller, and baker. Among the general rights of mankind is the right of <hi rend="italic">neceſſity ;</hi>  by which a man may uſe or deſtroy his neighbour’s property when it is abſolutely neceſſary for his own preſervation. It is on this principle that goods are thrown overboard to ſave the ſhip, and houſes pulled down to ſtop the pro-greſs of a fire. In ſuch caſes, however, at leaſt in the laſt,reſtitution ought to be made when it is in our power; but this reſtitution will not extend to the original value of the property deſtroyed, but only to what it was worth at the time of deſtroying it, which, conſidering its danger, might be very little.</p><p>RIGHTEOUSNESS, means juſtice, honeſty, virtue, goodneſs, and amongſt Chriſtiahs is of exactly the ſame import w-ith holineſs, without which, we are told, no man ſhall ſee the Lord. The doctrine of the fall, and of redemption through Jeſus Chriſt, has occaſioned much deputation, and given riſe to many ſingular notions in the world. The haughty philoſopher, diſſatis-fied with myſteries, and with the humiliating doctrine of atonement by a crucified Saviour, has made a religion for himſelf, which ſhe calls <hi rend="italic">rational Chriſtiaηity ; </hi>and the enthuſiaſt, by extracting doctrines ſrom Scripture which are not contained in it, and which are repugnant to its ſpirit, has given too much counténance to this preſumption. The doctrine of imputed righte-ouſneſs, by which the merit of Chriſt is ſaid to be imputed to us, appears to be of this number ; and though it has been held by many good, and by ſome learned men, it is certainly in general unfriendly to virtue, as will be readily allowed by all who have converſed with the more ignorant ſort of Methodiſts in England Or Se-</p><lb/><p>ceders in Scotland. That ſt does not follow ſrom the doctrine of the atonement, and conſequently that it has no foundation in Scripture, will appear elſewhere. See Theology.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Bill cſ Rights,</hi>  in law’, is a declaration delivered by the lords and commons to the prince and princeſs of Orange, 13 th February 1688 ; and afterwards enacted in parliament, when they became king and queen. It ſets forth, that king James did, by the aſſiſtance of divers evil counſellors, endeavour to ſubvert the laws and liberties of this kingdom, by exerciſing a power of dif∙ penſing with and ſuſpending of laws ; by levying money ſor the uſe of the crown by pretence of prerogative without conſent of parliament ; by proſecuting thoſe who petitioned the king, and diſcouraging petitions by railing and keeping a ftanding army in time of peace ; by violatingſtlie freedom of election of members» to ſerve in parliament ; by violent proſecutions in the court of king’s bench ; and cauſing partial and corrupt jurors to be returned on trials, exceſſive bail to be taken, exceſſive fines to be impoſed, and cruel puniſh-rnents inflicted ; all which were declared to be illegal. And the declaration concludes in theſe remarkable words : “ And they do claim, demand,' and in-ſiſt upon, all and ſingular the premiſes, as their undoubted rights and liberties.” And the act of parliament itſelf (1 W. &amp; M. ſtat. 2. cap. 2.) recognizes “ all and ſingular the rights and liberties, afferted and claimed in the ſaid declaration, to be the true, ancient, indubitable rights of the people of this kingdom.” See LIBERTY.</p><p>RIGIDITY, in phyſics, denotes a brittle hard-, neſs. It is oppoſed to ductility, malleability, and ſoft-</p><p>neſs.</p><p>RIGOLL, or Regals, a kind of muſical infiniment, conſiſting of ſeveral ſticks bound together, only ſeparated by beads. It is tolerably harmonious, being well ſtruck with a ball at the end of a ſtick. Such is the account which Graſſineau gives of this inſtrument. Skinner, upon the authority of an old Engliſh dictionary, represents it as a clavichord, or claricord ; poſſibly founding his opinion on the nature of the office of the tuner of the régals, who ſtill fubſiſts in the eſtabliſh-ment of the king’s chapel at St James’s, and whoſe bu-ſineſs is to keep the organ of the chapel royal in tune ; and not knowing that ſuch wind inſtruments as the organ need frequent tuning, as well as the clavichord and other ſtringed inſtruments. Sir Henry Spelman derives the word <hi rend="italic">rigoll</hi>  from the Italian <hi rend="italic">Pιgabello,</hi>  a muſical inſtrument, anciently uſed in churches inſtead of the organ. Walther, in his description of the regal, makes it to be a reed-work in an organ, with metal and alſo wooden pipes and bellows adapted to it. And he adds,, that the name of it is ſuppoſed to be own ng to its having been preſented by the inventor to ſome king.— From an account of the regal uſed in Germany, and other parts of Europe, it appears to conſiſt of pipes and keys on one ſide, and the bellows and wind-cheſt on the other. We may add, that Lord Bacon (Nat. Hilt, cent. ii. §. 102,) diſtinguiſhes between the regal and organ, in a manner which ſhows them to be inſtruments of the ſame claſs. Upon the whole, there is reaſon tα conclude, that the regal orrigoll was a pneumatic, and not a ſtringed inſtrument.</p><p>Merſennus relates, that the Flemings invented an in» ſtrugient, <hi rend="italic">les regales de bois,</hi>  conſiſting of 17 cylindrical</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
