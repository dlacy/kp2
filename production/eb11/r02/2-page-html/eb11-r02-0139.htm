<p><span class="font1">themselves in the modern democratic republics of Europe and America. It is a form of government not much more like the&nbsp;republic of antiquity and the middle ages than the French </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sansculottes</span><span class="font1"> was like Harmodius and Aristogeiton, whom he admired&nbsp;for being what they most decidedly were not—believers in&nbsp;equality and fraternity. But it does, subject to the imperfections of human nature, set up a government in which all,&nbsp;theoretically at least, have a voice in what concerns all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">REPUBLICAN PARTY. Of the three important American parties which have called themselves Republican,@@<sup>1</sup> this article&nbsp;deals only with that one which was organized during the years&nbsp;1854 to 1856 and has been in control of the government of the&nbsp;United States during the larger portion of the half century&nbsp;since the presidential election of i860</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Origin and Character.—</span><span class="font1">Sectionalism, the movement which tended to break the Union into two separate republics, one&nbsp;based on free labour, the other on that of slaves, had gained&nbsp;before the middle of the 19th century such headway as to&nbsp;compel a reconstruction of the party system. The beginning&nbsp;of this reconstruction was heralded by the rise of the Liberty&nbsp;party </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.),</span><span class="font1"> in 1840, its completion by the disruption in i860&nbsp;of the Democratic party along sectional lines, and the election&nbsp;of Abraham Lincoln by a sectional vote.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The event which determined the date of the birth of the Republican party was the repeal by the Kansas-Nebraska Bill of&nbsp;1854 of that provision of the Compromise of 1820 which excluded&nbsp;slavery from national territory N. of the geographical line 36° 30'&nbsp;and the formal substitution in that bill of “ squatter ” for national&nbsp;sovereignty, in deciding the question of slavery in the Territories.&nbsp;The enactment of this bill introduced a new and highly critical&nbsp;stage in the relations between North and South. Down to&nbsp;1850 the differences of the two sections over slavery had always&nbsp;been arranged by mutual concessions. In 1854 this expedient was set aside. Without giving anything in return, Douglas&nbsp;and his supporters took from the free-labour section an invaluable barrier against the extension of slavery: and through the&nbsp;doctrine of “ squatter sovereignty ” denied to Congress the&nbsp;power to erect such barriers in the future. But this only hastened a crisis that could not have been greatly delayed. Calhoun had already discerned the true source and deadly nature&nbsp;of the growing sectional estrangement, and Lincoln was soon&nbsp;to utter the prophetic words: “ This government cannot&nbsp;endure permanently, half slave and half free.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The immediate result of the agitation over the repeal was to convince a large number—which soon became a majority—&nbsp;of the best citizens of the North, irrespective of party, that the&nbsp;restriction of slavery was essential to the well-being both of the&nbsp;North and of the Union as a whole. In order to give effect&nbsp;to this conviction it was necessary to form a new party. The&nbsp;agitation which prepared the way for its rise began in Congress&nbsp;during the debates on the Kansas-Nebraska Bill, and spread&nbsp;thence throughout the North. The West was more quickly&nbsp;responsive than the East. But everywhere large elements&nbsp;of the existing parties came together and agreed to unite in&nbsp;resisting the extension of slavery. Before the discussion of&nbsp;the repeal in Congress had reached its later stages, a mass&nbsp;meeting of Whigs, Democrats and Free Soilers at Ripon, Wisconsin, resolved that if the Kansas-Nebraska Bill should pass:&nbsp;“ They would throw old party organizations to the winds and&nbsp;organize a new party on the sole issue of the non-extension&nbsp;of slavery.” The name Republican was formally adopted at&nbsp;a state convention of the new party held at Jackson, Michigan,&nbsp;on the 6th of July 1854, and by other Western state conventions on the 13th of the same month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The great majority of the new party had been either Whigs or Democrats. In two cardinal points they were agreed,&nbsp;namely, opposition to slavery and belief in the national, as&nbsp;opposed to the federative, nature of the Union. In other&nbsp;points there was at the beginning much disagreement. Fortunately the issues on which there was agreement overshadowed&nbsp;all others long enough to bring about a fusing of the two elements. It was the union of the Whig who believed in making&nbsp;government strong and its </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">sphere .wide,</span><span class="font1"> with the Democrat&nbsp;who believed in thc people an3 the {people’s control of government, that made the Republican party both efficient and popular.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">@@@<sup>1</sup>The party organized by Thomas Jefferson; the National Republicans, 1824-1834; and the Republican party of the present.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">History.—</span><span class="font1">Before its advent to power, from 1854 to i860, the tasks of the Republican party were three: to propagate&nbsp;the doctrine of slavery restriction by Congressional action; to&nbsp;oppose the extension of slavery under the operation of the&nbsp;doctrine of squatter sovereignty; and to obtain control of&nbsp;the Federal government. In each it was successful. Throughout the North and under such leaders as Seward, Lincoln, Chase,&nbsp;Sumner, Henry Ward Beecher and Horace Greeley, all thc&nbsp;resources of the press, the platform, the pulpit and (an institution then powerful but now forgotten) the Iyceum or citizens’&nbsp;debating club, were fully enlisted in the propaganda. Other&nbsp;events that turned to the advantage of the Republicans were&nbsp;the brutal assault upon Charles Sumner in thc Senate Chamber&nbsp;in 1856, the Ostend Manifesto, advising in the interest of&nbsp;slavery the acquisition of Cuba by force if Spain should refuse&nbsp;to sell, the enforcement—sometimes brutal and always hateful&nbsp;—of the Fugitive Slave Law </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.),</span><span class="font1"> and the quarrel of Douglas&nbsp;with the administration and the South over the application of&nbsp;Squattersovereignty to Kansas. On the other hand, the decision&nbsp;of the Supreme Court in the case of Dred Scott, which the Republicans refused to accept as good law, and the raid of John&nbsp;Brown at Harper’s Ferry, which they condemned,’brought them&nbsp;into serious embarrassment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the prosecution of the third task, the attainment of office, the party followed wise counsels and was fortunate. In its&nbsp;first national platform, that of 1856, the party affirmed its&nbsp;adherence to the principles of Washington and Jefferson,&nbsp;denied the constitutional right'of Congress or a Territory to&nbsp;establish slavery, and declared that it was “ both the right and&nbsp;duty of Congress to prohibit in the Territories those twin relics&nbsp;of barbarism, polygamy and slavery.” At the close of the&nbsp;resolutions there was a demand for government aid to a Pacific&nbsp;railway and for the improvement of rivers and harbours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The platform of i860 was morè comprehensive. It added to the planks of the first, an arraignment of the administration&nbsp;and the Dred Scott decision, and demands for a protective&nbsp;tariff and a homestead act. Although the popular vote for&nbsp;Abraham Lincoln was more than a half-million greater than&nbsp;that for John C. Frémont, the party’s candidate in 1856, nevertheless it was the disruption of the Democratic party that made&nbsp;the Republican triumph possible. On the other hand, the&nbsp;Republican party was the strongest member of the new party&nbsp;system as reorganized on the sectional principle. Moreover,&nbsp;in character and purpose, as well as numerical strength, it was&nbsp;better qualified than its rivals to meet the impending crisis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The War Period, 1861-1865.—</span><span class="font1">Between the election of Mr Lincoln in November i860, and his inauguration on the following&nbsp;4th of March, seven of the slave-holding states seceded, formed&nbsp;a Confederacy and withdrew their representatives from the&nbsp;national legislature. All attempts to arrange a compromise&nbsp;failed. The vacillation of President Buchanan, and the position&nbsp;taken in his annual message that the national government had&nbsp;no right to coerce a seceding state, gave strong support to the&nbsp;disunion movement. These events forced upon the Republican&nbsp;party a change of policy. Hitherto its efforts had been directed&nbsp;chiefly to excluding slavery from the Territories. Now thc&nbsp;first duty was to save the Union from disruption.. In order to&nbsp;do this it was necessary to unite the North, and to bring to&nbsp;the support of the Union a large proportion of those border&nbsp;slave states, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee&nbsp;and Missouri, in which there was considerable Union sentiment.&nbsp;Hence the party laid aside completely the earlier issue of slavery&nbsp;restriction and accepted as the sole issue of the hour the maintenance of the Union. Indeed, in order to secure more easily&nbsp;the co-operation of loyal Democrats, it even gave up its own&nbsp;name for a time and called itself the Union party.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
