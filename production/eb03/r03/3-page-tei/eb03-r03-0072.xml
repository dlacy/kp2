There was lately diſcovered, almoſt under the market place, a ſubterra-neous chapel of one Roſia, a Saxon Lady : it has ſeveral altars and images cut out of the chalky ſides, and is in form of a ſugar-loaf, having no entrance but at the top.</p><p>RUBBER <hi rend="italic">(India}.</hi>  See Caoutchouc.</p><p>RUBENS (Sir Peter Raul), the moſt eminent of the Flemiſh painters, was born in 15 77 ; but whether at Antwerp or Cologne it is not eaſy to determine. His father, who was a counſellor in the ſenate of Antwerp, had been forced by the civil wars to ſeek refuge in Cologne, and during his reſidence there Rubens is commonly ſaid to have been born.</p><p>The genius of Rubens, wlſtch began to unfold itſelf in his earlieſt years, was cultivated with peculiar care, and embelliſhed with every branch of claſſical and polite literature.</p><p>He ſoon diſcovered a ſtrong inclination for deſigning; and uſed to amuſe himſelf with that employment in his leiſure hours, while the reſt of his time was devoted to other ſtudies. His mother, perceiving the bias of her ſon, permitted him to attend the inſtructions of Tobias· Verhaecht a painter of architecture and landſcape. He next became the pupil of Adam Van Oort, but lie ſoon found that the abilities of this maſter were inſuſſicient to anſwer his elevated ideas. His ſurly temper too was</p><p>diſguſtful to Rubens, whoſe natural diſpoſition was model! and amiable. .</p><p>Anxious to find an artiſt whoſe genius and diſpofi. tſens were congenial with his own, he became the di-ſeiple of Octavio Van Veen, generally known by the name of Otho Venius, a painter of ſingular merit, and who was not only ſldlled in the principles of his art, but alſo diſtinguiſhed for learning and other accompliſh-ments. Between the maſter and ſeholar a remarkable ſimilarſty appeared in temper and inclination ; indeed, iιι the whole turn of their »finds. It was this congeniality of ſentiments which animated Rubens with that ardent paſſion for the art of painting which at length determined him to purſue it as a proſeſſion. From this time he gave up his whole mind to it ; and ſo ſucceſsful were his exertions, that he ſoon equalled his maſter.</p><p>In order to arrive at that perfection which he already beheld in idea, it became requifite to ſtudy the productions of the moſt eminent artiſts. For this purpoſe he travelled through Italy, viſiting the moſt valuable collections of paintings and antique ſtatues with which that country abounds.</p><p>Sandrart, who was intimately acquainted with Rubens, informs us, that he was recommended in the moſt honourable manner to the duke of Mantua by the archduke Albert, who had witneſſed his talents in the finiſh-ing of ſome fine paintings deſigned for his own palace. At Mantua he was received by the duke with the moſt flattering marks of diſtinction, and had'opportunities of improving himſelf which he did not neglect. Here he carefully ſtudied the works of Julio Romano. He next viſited Rome, where he had an opportunity of examining the productions of Raphael. The paintings of Titian and Paolo Veroneſe called him to Venice, where he accompliſhed himſelf in the art of colouring.</p><p>He continued in Italy ſeven years. At length receiving intelligence that his mother was taken ill, he haſtened to Antwerp ∙. but hi's filial affection was not gratified with a light of her; ſhe died before his arrival. He married ſoon after ; but his wife dying at the end' of four years, he retired from Antwerp for ſome time,, and endeavoured to ſoothe his melancholy by a journey to Holland. At Utrecht he viſited Hurtort, for whom he had a great value.    »</p><p>The tame of Rubens was now ſpread over Europe. He was invited by Mary of Medicis queen of. Henry IV. of France to Râris, where he painted the galleries in the palace of Luxemburg. Theſe form a ſeries of' paintings which delineate the hiſtory of Mary ; and af-foι d a convincing proof how well qualified he was to excel in allegorical and emblematical compo tions. While at Paris he became acquainted with the duke of Buckingham, who was-ſo taken with his great talents and accompliſhments, that he judged him well qualified to explain to Iſabella, the wife oſ Albeit the archduke, the cauſe of the nriſunderſtanding which had taken place between the courts of England and Spain. In this employment Rubens, acquitted himſelf with ſuch propriety, that Iſabella appointed him envoy' to the king oſ Spain, with a commiſſion to propoſe terms of peace, and to bring back the inſtructions of that monarch. Philip was no leſs captivated with Rubens; He conferred on him the honour of knighthood, and made him ſecretary to his privy council. Rubens</p><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
