<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">be founded under the title of rhetoric, from which men like Chrysoloras and Guarino, Filelfo and Politian,&nbsp;expounded orally to hundreds of eager students from every&nbsp;town of Italy and every nation in Europe their accumulated knowledge of antiquity. One mass of Greek and&nbsp;Roman erudition, including history and metaphysics, law&nbsp;and science, civic institutions and the art of war, mythology&nbsp;and magistracies, metrical systems and oratory, agriculture&nbsp;and astronomy, domestic manners and religious rites,&nbsp;grammar and philology, biography and numismatics,&nbsp;formed the miscellaneous subject matter of this so-styled&nbsp;rhetoric. Notes taken at these lectures supplied· young&nbsp;scholars ־with hints for further exploration; and a certain&nbsp;tradition of treating antique authors for the display of&nbsp;general learning, as well as for the elucidation of their&nbsp;texts, came into vogue, which has determined the method&nbsp;of scholarship for the last three centuries in Europe. The&nbsp;lack of printed books in the first period of the Revival, and&nbsp;the comparative rarity of Greek erudition among students,&nbsp;combined with the intense enthusiasm aroused for the new&nbsp;gospel of the classics, gave special value to the personal&nbsp;teaching of these professors. They journeyed from city to&nbsp;city, attracted by promises of higher pay, and allured by&nbsp;ever-growing laurels of popular fame. Each large town&nbsp;established its public study, academy, or university, similar&nbsp;institutions under varying designations, for the exposition&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">litterse humaniores.</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> The humanists, or professors of&nbsp;that branch of knowledge, became a class of the highest&nbsp;dignity. They were found in the chanceries of the&nbsp;republics, in the papal curia, in the council chambers of&nbsp;princes, at the headquarters of condottieri, wherever&nbsp;business had to be transacted, speeches to be made, and&nbsp;the work of secretaries to be performed. Furthermore,&nbsp;they undertook the charge of private education, opening&nbsp;schools which displaced the mediaeval system of instruction,&nbsp;and taking engagements as tutors in the families of&nbsp;despots, noblemen, and wealthy merchants. The academy&nbsp;established by Yittorino da Feltre at Mantua under the&nbsp;protection of Gian Francesco Gonzaga for the training of&nbsp;pupils of both sexes, might be chosen as the type of this&nbsp;Italian method. His scholars, who were lodged in appropriate buildings, met daily to hear the master read and&nbsp;comment on the classics. They learned portions of the&nbsp;best authors by heart, exercised themselves in translation&nbsp;from one language to another, and practised composition&nbsp;in prose and verse. It was Yittorino’s care to see that,&nbsp;while their memories were duly stored ־with words and&nbsp;facts, their judgment should be formed by critical analysis,&nbsp;attention to style, and comparison of the authors of a&nbsp;decadent age with those who were acknowledged classics.&nbsp;During the hours of recreation suitable physical exercises,&nbsp;as fencing, riding, and gymnastics, were conducted under&nbsp;qualified trainers. From this sketch it will be seen how&nbsp;closely the educational system which came into England&nbsp;during the reigns of the Tudors, and which has prevailed&nbsp;until the present time, was modelled upon the Italian&nbsp;type. English youths who spend their time at Eton&nbsp;between athletic sports and Latin verses, and who take&nbsp;an Ireland with a first class in “ Greats ” at Oxford, are&nbsp;pursuing the same course of physical and mental discipline&nbsp;as the princes of Gonzaga or Montefeltro in the 15 th&nbsp;century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">1</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> The humanists effected a deeply penetrating change</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">;· in social manners. Through their influence as tutors, professors, orators, and courtiers, society was permeated&nbsp;by a fresh ideal of culture. To be a gentleman in Italy&nbsp;meant at this epoch to be a man acquainted with the&nbsp;rudiments at least of scholarship, refined in diction,&nbsp;capable of corresponding or of speaking in choice phrasesj&nbsp;open to the beauty of the arts, intelligently interested in&nbsp;archaeology, taking for his models of conduct the great&nbsp;men of antiquity rather than the saints of the church.&nbsp;He was also expected to prove himself an adept in&nbsp;physical exercises and in the courteous observances which&nbsp;survived from chivalry. The type is set before us by&nbsp;Castiglione in that book upon the courtier which went&nbsp;the round of Europe in the 16 th century. It is further&nbsp;emphasized in a famous passage of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Orlando Innamorato&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">where Boiardo compares the Italian ideal of an accomplished gentleman with the coarser type admired by&nbsp;nations of the north. To this point the awakened&nbsp;intelligence of the Renaissance, instructed by humanism,&nbsp;polished by the fine arts, expanding in genial conditions&nbsp;of diffused wealth, had brought the Italians at a period&nbsp;when the rest of Europe was comparatively barbarous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">This picture has undoubtedly a darker side. Humanism, in its revolt against the Middle Ages, was, as we have seen already, mundane, pagan, irreligious, positive.&nbsp;The Renaissance can, after all, be regarded only as a&nbsp;period of transition, in which much of the good of the&nbsp;past was sacrificed while some of the evil was retained, and&nbsp;neither the bad nor the good of the future was brought&nbsp;clearly into fact. Beneath the surface of brilliant social&nbsp;culture lurked gross appetites and savage passions,&nbsp;unrestrained by mediaeval piety, untutored by modern&nbsp;experience. Italian society exhibited an almost unexampled spectacle of literary, artistic, and courtly refinement&nbsp;crossed by brutalities of lust, treasons, poisonings, assassinations, violence. A succession of worldly pontiffs&nbsp;brought the church into flagrant discord with the principles&nbsp;of Christianity. Steeped in pagan learning, emulous of&nbsp;imitating the manners of the ancients, used to think and&nbsp;feel in harmony with Ovid and Theocritus, and at the&nbsp;same time rendered cynical by the corruption of papal&nbsp;Rome, the educated classes lost their grasp upon morality.&nbsp;Political honesty ceased almost to have a name in Italy.&nbsp;The Christian virtues were scorned by the foremost actors&nbsp;and the ablest thinkers of the time, while the antique&nbsp;virtues were themes for rhetoric rather than moving-springs of conduct. This is apparent to all students of&nbsp;Machiavelli and Guicciardini, the profoundest analysts of&nbsp;their age, the bitterest satirists of its vices, but themselves&nbsp;infected with its incapacity for moral goodness. Not&nbsp;only were the Italians vitiated; but they had also become&nbsp;impotent for action and resistance. At the height of the&nbsp;Renaissance the five great powers in the peninsula formed&nbsp;a confederation of independent but mutually attractive&nbsp;and repellent states. Equilibrium was maintained by&nbsp;diplomacy, in which the humanists played a foremost part,&nbsp;casting a network of intrigue over the nation which&nbsp;helped in no small measure to stimulate intelligence and&nbsp;create a common medium of culture, but which accustomed&nbsp;statesmen to believe that everything could be achieved by&nbsp;wire-pulling. Wars were conducted on a showy system&nbsp;by means of mercenaries, who played a safe game in the&nbsp;field and developed a system of bloodless campaigns.&nbsp;Meanwhile the people grew up unused to arms. When&nbsp;Italy between the years 1494 and 1530 became the battlefield of French, German, and Spanish forces, it was seen&nbsp;to what a point of helplessness the political, moral, and&nbsp;social conditions of the Renaissance had brought the&nbsp;nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">It was needful to study at some length the main phenomena of the Renaissance in Italy, because the history of that phase of evolution in the other Western races turns&nbsp;almost entirely upon points in which they either adhered&nbsp;to or diverged from the type established there. Speaking&nbsp;broadly, what France, Germany, Spain, and England&nbsp;assimilated from Italy at this epoch was in the first place&nbsp;the new learning, as it was then called. This implied the</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
