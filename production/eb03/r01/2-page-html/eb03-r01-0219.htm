<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">tſoua ln the eauſe of republicaniſm. No </span><span class="font0">regard, how-<sup>1</sup> ever, has been paid to it by the </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">convention, </span><span class="font0">which has declared itſelf permanent, nor indeed does it ſeem poſ-ſible to carry it into execution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">we have mentioned that Condé was inveſted from the beginning of April. It did not yield till thc loth&nbsp;of July, when the garriſon was ſo much reduced by famine and diſeafe, that out of 4000 men, of which it&nbsp;originally conſiſted, only 1500 were ſit for ſervice. The&nbsp;eyes of all Europe were in the mean time ſaxed upon&nbsp;the ſiege of Valenciennes. Colonel Moncrieff had contended, that batteries ought immediately to be placed&nbsp;under the walls without approaching it by regular pa-rallels ; but the Imperial engineer Mr Ferraris afferted,&nbsp;that the work of the great Vanban muſt be treated with&nbsp;more reſpect ; and his opinion was adopted by the&nbsp;council of war. The trenches were opened on the&nbsp;14th of June. Few ſallies were attempted by the gar-riſon, on account of the ſmallneſs of their number.&nbsp;The inhabitants at ſirſt wiſhed to furrender ; but the&nbsp;violence of the bombardment prevented their affem-bling or giving much trouble on that head to General&nbsp;Ferrand the governor. Much of the labour of the&nbsp;ſiege conſiſted of mines and countermines. Some of&nbsp;theſe having been ſucceſsfully ſprung by the allies, tlie&nbsp;town was ſurrendered on the 27th of July by capitula-tion to the Duke of York, wlio took poſſeffion of it in&nbsp;behalf of the emperor of Germany. The ſiege of&nbsp;Mentz was at the ſame time going on. It ſuſſered&nbsp;much from famine. At laſſ, after an unſucceſsful at-tempt by the French army on the Rhine for its relief,&nbsp;Mentz ſurrendered on the 2 2d of July.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">At the termination of the ſiege of Valenciennes it is ſaid that the allied powers were at a loſs how to pro-ceed next. The Auſtrian commanders are faid to have&nbsp;preſented two plans : The ſirſt was to penetrate to Pa-ris by the affiſtance of the rivers which fall into the&nbsp;Seine ; the other was to take advantage of the conſter-nation occaſioned·by the ſurrender of Valenciennes, and&nbsp;with 50,000 light troops to penetrate ſuddenly to Paris,&nbsp;while a debarkation ſhould be made ©n the coaſt of&nbsp;Brittany to affiſt thc royaliſts. The propoſal of the&nbsp;Britiſh miniſtry was, however, adopted, which was, to&nbsp;divide the grand army, and to attack </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">weſt </span><span class="font0">Flanders,&nbsp;beginning with the ſiege of Dunkirk. This determination proved ruinous to the allies. The French found&nbsp;means to vanquiſh in detail that army, which they&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> could not encounter when united.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is ſaid that the Duke of York was in fecret cor-reſpondence with Omeron the governor of Dunkirk ; but he was removed before any advantage could be taken of his treachery. On the 24th of Auguſt the&nbsp;Duke of York attacked and drove the French outpoſts&nbsp;into the town, after an action in which the Auſtrian&nbsp;General Dalton was killed. A naval armament was&nbsp;expected from Great Britain to co-operate in the ſiege,&nbsp;but ſt did not arrive. In the mean time, a ſtrong re-publican force menaced the covering army of the allies,&nbsp;wliich was commanded by General Freytag. He was&nbsp;foon attacked and totally routed. The ſiege was raiſed. The Britiſh loſt their heavy cannon and baggage,&nbsp;with ſeveral thouſand men; and the convention, belie-ving that their General Houchard could have cut off&nbsp;the Duke of York’s retreat, tried and executed him for&nbsp;this neglect of duty,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Prince Cobourg and General Clairfait in the mean time unſucceſsſully attempted to beſiege Cambray and&nbsp;Boucliain. (Queſnoy was, however, taken by General&nbsp;Clairfait on the 1 ith of September ; and here finally&nbsp;terminated for the preſent campaign the ſucceſs of the&nbsp;allies in the Netherlands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A conſiderable part of the French army of the north took a ſtrong poſition near Manbeuge, where&nbsp;they were blockaded by Prince Cobourg v but upon&nbsp;the 15th and 16th of October he was repeatedly at-tacked by the French troops under General Jourdan,&nbsp;who ſucceeded Houchard. 'I he French had now re-covered their vigour. They brought into the held a&nbsp;formidable train of artillery, in which were many 24&nbsp;pounders. Commiffioners from the convention harangued the ſoldiers, threatened the fearful, and applauded the brave. Crowds of women, without conſuſion, went through the ranks, diſtributing ſpirituous li-quors in abundance, and carrying off the wounded,&nbsp;'i'he attacks were repeated and terrible on both ſides ;&nbsp;but the Auſtrians had conſiderably the diſadvantage,&nbsp;and Prince Cobourg retired during the night. 3 he&nbsp;French now menaced maritime Flanders. They took&nbsp;Furnes and beſieged Nieuport. A detachment of&nbsp;Britiſh troops ready to fail to the weſt Indies were&nbsp;haſtily ſent to Oſtesd, and prevented for the preſent&nbsp;the farther progreſs of the French.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Such was the multiplicity of the events that now oc-curred in France, that it is difficult to ſtate the out-lines of them with any tolerable perſpicuity. we have already mentioned the extenſive diſſenſions that occurred throughout the republic in conſequence of the tri-umph of the Mountain party on the 3 iſt of May. The&nbsp;department of Calvades was ſirſt inarms againſt the&nbsp;convention under the command of General Felix wimp-fen ; but before the end of July the infurrection was&nbsp;quieted, after a few flight ſkirmiſhes. But the fœdera-liſm of the cities of Marfeilles, Lyons, and Toulon, ſtill&nbsp;remained. Lyons was attacked on the 8th oſ Auguſt&nbsp;by the conventional troops. Several actions followed,&nbsp;which were attended with great loſs both on the part&nbsp;of the affailants and of the beſieged. The city was re-duced almoſt to ruins ; but it held out during the&nbsp;whole month of September. The beſieging General&nbsp;Kellerman was removed from his command, on account&nbsp;of his ſuppoſed inactivity ; and the city ſurrendered on&nbsp;the 8th of October to General Doppet, a man who had&nbsp;lately been a phylieian. Such was the rage of party&nbsp;zeal at this time, that the walls and public buildings of&nbsp;Lyons were ordered to be deſtroyed, and its name&nbsp;changed to that of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ville Affranchie.</span><span class="font0"> Many hundreds&nbsp;of its citizens were dragged to the ſcaffold 011 account&nbsp;of their alleged treaſonable reſiftance to the convention.&nbsp;The victorious party, wearied by the flow operation of&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">guillotine,</span><span class="font0"> at laſt deſtroyed their priſoners in multitudes, by firing grape-ſhot upon them. Such indeed&nbsp;was the unrelenting character of the Mountain at this&nbsp;time, not only here but through the whole republic,&nbsp;that tliey tliemſelves pretended not to excuſe it, but&nbsp;declared that terror was with them </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">the order of the&nbsp;day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the end of July General Cartaux was ſent againſt Marfeilles. In the beginning of Auguſt he gained&nbsp;ſome ſucceffes over the advanced fœderalift troops. On&nbsp;the 24th he took the town of Aix, and the Marſellois</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
