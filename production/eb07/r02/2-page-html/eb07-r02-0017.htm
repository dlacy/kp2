<p><span class="font2">great, and deviate the more from this quantity as Vs is smaller, we may represent the velocities by the ordinates&nbsp;of another curve PGT, which approaches very near to the&nbsp;hyperbola, at a great distance from A along AB ; but separates from it when the abscissæ are smaller: so that&nbsp;if AQ represents that value of Vs (which we have seen&nbsp;may become less than unity) which corresponds to an infinite velocity, the line QO may be the asymptote of the&nbsp;new curve. Its ordinates are equal to while those of the</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">To express X, therefore, as some function of V i so as to answer these conditions, we see in general that X must be&nbsp;less than </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vs.</span><span class="font2"> And it must not be equal to any power of</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">√ S</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vs</span><span class="font2"> whose index is less than unity, because then -~- would</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">differ so much the more from unity as√sis greater. Nor must it be any multiple of Vi, such as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">q Vs,</span><span class="font2"> for the same&nbsp;reason. If we make X = Vi — K, K being a constant&nbsp;quantity, we may answer the first condition pretty well.&nbsp;But K must be very small, that X may not become equal&nbsp;to nothing, except in some exceedingly small value of Vi.&nbsp;Now the experiments will not admit of this, because the</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">ratio --— does not increase sufficiently to correspond</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">with the velocities which we observe in certain slopes, unless we make K greater than unity, which again is inconsistent with other experiments. We learn from such canvassing that it will not do to make K a constant quantity. If we should make it any fractionary power of Vi, it would&nbsp;make X = 0, that is, nothing, when </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">s</span><span class="font2"> is =: 1, which is also</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font2">contrary to experience. It would seem, therefore, that nothing will answer for K but some power of Vs which has&nbsp;a variable index. The logarithm of Vs has this property.&nbsp;We may therefore try to make X = Vs — log. V s. Ac-cordingly, if we try the equation V =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_,</span></p>
    <p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">we</span><span class="font2"> shall find a very great agreement with the experiments till the declivity becomes considerable, or about <sub>5</sub><sup>1</sup><sub>l</sub>τ, which&nbsp;is much greater than any river. But it will not agree with&nbsp;the velocities observed in some mill-courses, and in pipes&nbsp;of a still greater declivity, and gives a velocity that is too&nbsp;small ; and in vertical pipes the velocity is not above one&nbsp;half of the true one. We shall get rid of most of these incongruities if we make K consist of the hyperbolic logarithm of Vs augmented by a small quantity ; and by trying&nbsp;various values for this constant quantity, and comparing the&nbsp;results with experiment, we may hit on one sufficiently exact for all practical purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Du Buat, after repeated trials, found that he would have a very great conformity with experiment by making&nbsp;K = log. V s + 1∙6, and that the velocities exhibited in&nbsp;his experiments would be very well represented by the for-</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">There is a circumstance which our author seems to have overlooked on this occasion, and which is undoubtedly of&nbsp;great effect in these motions, viz. the mutual adhesion of&nbsp;the particles of water. This causes the water which is descending (in a vertical pipe, for example) to drag more water after it, and thus greatly increases its velocity. We&nbsp;have seen an experiment in which the water issued from&nbsp;the bottom of a reservoir through a long vertical pipe having a very gentle taper. It was fifteen feet long, one inch&nbsp;diameter at the upper end, and two inches at the lower.&nbsp;The depth of the water in the reservoir was exactly one&nbsp;foot ; in a minute there were discharged </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">2f<sub>5</sub></span><span class="font2"> cubic feet of&nbsp;water. It must therefore have issued through the hole in&nbsp;the bottom of the reservoir with the velocity of 8∙85 feet&nbsp;per second. And yet we know that this head of water&nbsp;could not make it pass through the hole with a velocity&nbsp;greater than 6∙56 feet per second. This increase must&nbsp;therefore have arisen from the cause we have mentioned,&nbsp;and is a proof of the great intensity of this force. We doubt&nbsp;not but that the discharge might have been much more increased by proper contrivances ; and we know many instances in water-pipes where this effect is produced in a&nbsp;very great degree·</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The following case is very distinct. Water is brought into the town of Dunbar, in the county of Haddington,&nbsp;from a spring at the distance of about 3200 yards. It is&nbsp;conveyed along the first 1100 yards in a pipe of two inches&nbsp;diameter, and the declivity is 12 feet 9 inches ; from thence&nbsp;the water flows in a pipe of 1½ diameter, with a declivity&nbsp;of 44 feet three inches, making in all 57 feet. When the&nbsp;work was carried as far as the two-inch pipe reached, the&nbsp;discharge was found to be 27 Scotch pints, of 103½ cubic&nbsp;inches each, in a minute. When it was brought into the&nbsp;town, the discharge was 28. Here it is plain that the descent along the second stretch of the pipe could derive no&nbsp;impulsion from the first- This was only able to supply 27&nbsp;pints, and to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">deliver</span><span class="font2"> it into a pipe of equal bore. It was&nbsp;not equivalent to the forcing it into a smaller pipe, and almost doubling its velocity. It must therefore have been&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">dragged</span><span class="font2"> into this smaller pipe by the weight of what was&nbsp;descending along it, and this water was exerting a force&nbsp;equivalent to a head of 16 inches, increasing the velocity&nbsp;from 14 to about 28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It must be observed, that if this formula be just, there can be no declivity so small that a current of water will not</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
