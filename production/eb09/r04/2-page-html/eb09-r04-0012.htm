        <p><span class="font1">The finances of the empire are in a most unsatisfactory condition.
                Although the revenue has doubled since 18δ6, and had reached&nbsp;697,980,983
                roubles (£69,798,098) @@<sup>1</sup> in 1883, the expenditure, which&nbsp;was
                estimated at 721,337,844 roubles the same year, is always in&nbsp;excess of the
                income. The national debt is rapidly augmented both&nbsp;by loans and by issues of
                paper money so depreciated as to be worth&nbsp;only about 60 to 63 per cent, of its
                nominal value. On January 1,&nbsp;1884, no less than 1,085,000,000 paper roubles
                were in circulation ;&nbsp;and the national debt, the paper-money included, reached
                about&nbsp;£578,000,000, inclusive of the railway debt. The great defect
                of&nbsp;Russian finance is that its direct taxes are chiefly paid by
                the&nbsp;peasantry (91 per cent, of the whole), and the revenue is chiefly
                based&nbsp;on excise duties (direct taxes, 136,105,320 roubles ; excise duties
                on&nbsp;spirits, 250,291,380 ; duties on tobacco and sugar, 28,569,500 ;&nbsp;import
                duties, 101,053,000). Of the yearly revenue no less than&nbsp;436,000,000 roubles
                are spent in interest and sinking fund on the&nbsp;debt, and for war purposes.

        <p><span class="font1">The zemstvos, which have an aggregate yearly income of about thirty
                million roubles, have also a yearly deficit of from three to&nbsp;five million
                roubles. The municipalities had in 1882 an income of&nbsp;only 40,076,748 roubles,
                there being only nine cities which had a&nbsp;budget of more than 500,000 roubles,
                and five above one million.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The Russian army has been completely reorganized since the Crimean
                War, and compulsory military service was introduced in&nbsp;1874. In 1884 the
                strength of the army on a peace footing was&nbsp;532,764 men serving with the
                colours, 68,786 reserve troops,&nbsp;55,599 Cossacks and irregulars, 72,626 local,
                depot, and instruction&nbsp;troops, 27,468 officers, 129,736 horses, and 1844 guns.
                On a war&nbsp;footing there were 986,000 in the active army, 563,373 in
                the&nbsp;reserve, 148,057 Cossacksand irregulars, 178,450 local, depôt,
                and&nbsp;instruction troops, 41,551 officers, 366,354 horses, and 3778
                guns;&nbsp;that is, about 1,300,000 men in field, to which number
                1,000,000&nbsp;untrained militia could be added in case of need. These
                high&nbsp;figures, ought, however, to be much reduced on account of
                the&nbsp;deficiencies of mobilization.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The irregular troops consist of ten </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">voiskos—</span><span class="font1">Don, Kubafi, Terek,
                Astrakhan, Orenburg, Ural, West Siberia, Semiryetchensk, Transbaikalia, and Amur.
                All the men of these voiskos between sixteen&nbsp;and forty-one years of age are
                bound to be ready for service in turn&nbsp;in time of peace, and to equip themselves
                at their own expense,&nbsp;train and artillery being provided by Government. In
                their twofold&nbsp;capacity as peasant settlers and a military force, these men
                have&nbsp;contributed much to the conquest of Asia.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Since 1878 compulsory military service has been introduced in
                Finland. The Finnish troops (nine battalions of 4833 riflemen)&nbsp;must bo
                employed, as a rule, for the defence of their own country.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Notwithstanding large recent outlays, the Russian navy is by no means
                adapted to the exigencies of modern warfare ; much stress is&nbsp;therefore laid on
                the good organization of the torpedo flotilla. The&nbsp;navy consists of 358
                vessels, of 196,575 tons, carrying 24,500 men&nbsp;and 671 guns. Only 40 of these
                are armoured ships, the remainder&nbsp;being unarmoured frigates, corvettes, and
                cruisers, or torpedo boats&nbsp;(119), while a great number are mere transports and
                small craft.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The extensive frontier is defended by many fortresses, chiefly on the
                west. Poland to the west of the Vistula remains quite unprotected, fortifications
                being only now in course of construction in the&nbsp;south-west ; but the Vistula is
                defended by the first-class fortresses&nbsp;of Modlin (Novogeorgievsk), Warsaw, and
                Ivangorod, with Brest-Litovsk in the rear. For protecting this line in rear new
                fortifications are being erected. The space between Poland and the Diina&nbsp;is
                protected only by the citadel of Vilna and the marshes of the&nbsp;Pripet. The
                second line of fortresses has been erected on the Diina&nbsp;and Dnieper,—Riga,
                Diinaburg, Vitebsk, Bobruisk, and Kieffi&nbsp;The south-western frontier is under
                the protection of the advanced&nbsp;works of Bendery and Akerman, while the Black
                Sea coast is&nbsp;defended by Kinburn and Otchakoff at the entrances of the
                Dnieper&nbsp;and the Bug, Sebastopol in the Crimea, batteries at Odessa
                and&nbsp;Nikolaieff, and a series of minor fortifications. Formidable defensive
                works have been erected on the Baltic at Dünamünde, Reval,&nbsp;Narva, Cronstadt,
                Wiborg, Frederikshamn, Rohtensalm, Sveaborg,&nbsp;Hangoudd, and in the Aland
                Islands. A great number of minor&nbsp;forts are scattered throughout Caucasia,
                Transcaucasia, and&nbsp;Turkestan ; but the Pacific coast has only earth-works at

            <p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Pakt II.—European
                    Russia—Geography.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font1">The administrative boundaries of European Russia, apart from
                    Finland and Poland, broadly coincide on the whole with the&nbsp;natural limits
                    of the East-Europcan plains, where they suddenly&nbsp;take, eastward of the
                    Baltic Sea, a great extension towards the&nbsp;north. In the north it is bounded
                    by the Arctic Ocean ; the&nbsp;islands of Nova Zembla, Kolguefl', and Vaigatch
                    also belong to it,&nbsp;but the Kara Sea is reckoned to Siberia. To the east it
                    has the&nbsp;Asiatic dominions of the empire, Siberia and the Kirghiz
                    Steppe,&nbsp;from both of which it is separated by the Ural Mountains,
                    the&nbsp;Ural river, and the Caspian—the administrative boundary, however,
                    Partly extending into Asia on the Siberian slope of the Urals.&nbsp;To the south
                    it has the Black Sea and Caucasia, being separated&nbsp;from the latter by the
                    double valley of the two Manytches—a&nbsp;channel which in Post-Pliocene times
                    connected the Sea of Azoff&nbsp;with the Caspian. The western boundary is purely
                    conventional :&nbsp;it crosses first the peninsula of Kola from the Varanger
                    Fiord to&nbsp;the northern extremity of the Gulf of Bothnia, making an
                    arbitrary&nbsp;deflexion towards the west ; thence it runs to the Kurische
                    Haff&nbsp;in the southern Baltic, and thence to the mouth of the
                    Danube,&nbsp;taking a great circular sweep to the west to embrace Poland,
                    and&nbsp;separating Russia from Prussia, Austrian Galicia, and
                Roumania.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font1">Of this immense frontier line less than one-half is bordered by
                    seas—nearly all of them inland seas. For it is a special feature
                    of&nbsp;Russia—a feature which has impressed a special character on
                    its&nbsp;history—that she has no free outlet to the high seas except on
                    the&nbsp;ice-bound shores of the Arctic Ocean. Even the White Sea is&nbsp;merely
                    a ramified gulf of that ocean. Another warmer gulf of&nbsp;the Arctic Ocean—the
                    Varanger Fiord—separated from Russia by&nbsp;the uninhabitable plateaus of the
                    peninsula of Kola, has been&nbsp;abandoned to Norway. The deep indentations of
                    the Gulf of&nbsp;Bothnia and Finland wash the shores of Finnish territory, and
                    it&nbsp;is only at the very head of the latter gulf that the Russians
                    happen&nbsp;to have taken a firm foothold by erecting their capital on
                    the&nbsp;marshes at the mouth of the Neva. The Gulf of Riga and
                    the&nbsp;south-eastern Baltic belong also to territory which is not
                    inhabited&nbsp;by Slavonians, but by Finnish stems, and by Germans. It is
                    only&nbsp;very recently, within the last hundred years, that the
                    Russians&nbsp;definitively took possession of the northern shores of the Black
                    Sea&nbsp;and the Sea of Azoff. The eastern coast of the Black Sea
                    belongs&nbsp;properly to Transcaucasia, a great chain of mountains
                    separating&nbsp;it from Russia. But even this sea is an inland one, the only
                    outlet&nbsp;of which, the Bosphorus, is in foreign hands, while the Caspian
                    is&nbsp;but an immense shallow lake, bordered mostly by deserts,
                    and&nbsp;possessing more importance as a link between Russia and
                    her&nbsp;colonies than as a channel for intercourse with other
                countries.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font1">The great territory occupied by European Russia—1600 miles in
                    length from north to south, and nearly as much from west to east&nbsp;—is on the
                    whole a broad elevated plain, ranging between 500 and&nbsp;900 feet above
                    sea-level, deeply cut into by river-valleys, and&nbsp;bounded on all sides by
                    broad hilly swellings or mountains :—the&nbsp;lake plateaus of Finland and the
                    Maanselka heights in the northwest ; the Baltic coast-ridge and spurs of the
                    Carpathians in the&nbsp;west, with a broad depression between the two, occupied
                    by Poland ;&nbsp;the Crimean and Caucasian mountains in the south ; and the
                    broad&nbsp;but moderately high swelling of the Ural Mountains in the
                    east.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font1">From a central plateau which comprises Tver, Moscow, Smolensk,
                    and Kursk, and projects eastwards towards Samara, attaining an&nbsp;average
                    height of 800 to 900 feet above the sea, the surface gently&nbsp;slopes in all
                    directions to a level of from 300 to 500 feet. Then it&nbsp;again gently rises
                    as it approaches the hilly tracts enclosing the&nbsp;great plain. This central
                    swelling may be considered a continuation towards the east-north-east of the
                    great line of upheavals of&nbsp;western Europe ; the heights of Finland would
                    then appear as&nbsp;continuations of the Scanian plateaus, and the northern
                    mountains&nbsp;of Finland as continuations of the Kjolen, while the other
                    great&nbsp;line of upheaval of the old continent, which runs north-west
                    and&nbsp;south-east, would be represented in Russia by the Caucasus in
                    the&nbsp;south and the Timan ridge of the Petchora basin in the
                north.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font1">The hilly aspects of several parts of the central plateau are not
                    due to foldings of the strata, which for the most part appear to
                    be&nbsp;horizontal, but chiefly to the excavating action of rivers,
                    whose&nbsp;valleys arc deeply dug out in the plateau, especially on
                    its&nbsp;borders. The round flattened summits of the Valdai plateau do&nbsp;not
                    rise above 1100 feet, and they present the appearance of&nbsp;mountains only in
                    consequence of the depth of the valleys—the&nbsp;levels of the rivers which flow
                    towards the depression of Lake&nbsp;Peipus being only from 200 to 250 feet above
                    the sea. The case is&nbsp;Similar with the plateaus of Livonia, &quot;Wendish
                    Switzerland,”&nbsp;and Kovno, which do not exceed 1000 feet at their highest
                    points ;&nbsp;so also with the eastern spurs of the Baltic coast-ridge
                    between&nbsp;Grodno and Minsk. The same elevation is reached by a very
                    few&nbsp;flat summits of the plateau about Kursk, and farther east on
                    the&nbsp;Volga about Kamysnin, where the valleys are excavated in
                    the&nbsp;plateau to a depth of from 800 to 900 feet, giving quite a
                    hilly&nbsp;aspect to the country. It is only in the south-west, where
