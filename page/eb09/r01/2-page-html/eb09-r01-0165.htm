<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">powerful impulse of Fichte, and then gravitated, on grounds of religious feeling, towards Jacobi, whom he in&nbsp;turn deserted for the so-called “ rational idealism </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">”</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> of&nbsp;Bardili.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Reinlioldls historical importance belongs entirely to his earlier activity. The development of the Kantian standpoint contained&nbsp;in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Xew Theory of the Human Faculty of Ideas</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1789), and in&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Fundament ties philosophischcn Wissens</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1791), was called by&nbsp;its author “Elcrnentarphilosophie.” Endeavouring to buildup&nbsp;the system out of simpler elements, Reinhold starts from the mere&nbsp;fact of consciousness of the existence of mental states (“Yorstel-lungeu ” or ideas). Every idea carries with it the reference to a&nbsp;subject, whose idea it is, and to an object, of which it is the idea.&nbsp;This double reference explains why every idea consists, as Kant&nbsp;maintained, of “form” and “matter.” In its “form ”lies the&nbsp;reference to the subject, iu its “matter” the reference to an&nbsp;object. Hence, too, we see why the thing-in-itself, though necessarily existent, is at the same time necessarily unknowable, seeing&nbsp;that all knowledge implies a subject-derived element. The rest of&nbsp;Reinhold’s emendations to Kant are little more than suggested&nbsp;improvements in terminology.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">REISIvE, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Johaxx Jacob </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(1716-1774), scholar and physician, was born 25th December 1716, in the little&nbsp;town of Zorbig in Electoral Saxony. From the Waisen-haus at Halle he passed in 1733 to the university of&nbsp;Leipsic, and there spent five years. He lived alone without teacher or friend, heard no lectures, but studied continually without order or aim. He tried to find his own&nbsp;way in Greek literature, to which German schools then&nbsp;gave little attention; but, as he had not mastered the&nbsp;grammar, he soon found this a sore task and took up&nbsp;Arabic. He was very poor, having almost nothing beyond&nbsp;his allowance, which for the five years was only two&nbsp;hundred thalers. But everything of which he could cheat&nbsp;his appetite was spent on Arabic books, and when he had&nbsp;read all that was then printed he thirsted for manuscripts,&nbsp;and in March 1738 started on foot for Hamburg, joyous&nbsp;though totally unprovided, on his way to Leyden and the&nbsp;treasures of the Warnerianum. At Hamburg he got some&nbsp;money and letters of recommendation from the Hebraist&nbsp;Wolf, and took ship to Amsterdam. Here D’Orville, to&nbsp;whom he had an introduction, proposed to retain him as his&nbsp;amanuensis at a salary of six hundred guilders. Reiske&nbsp;refused, though he thought the offer very generous; he did&nbsp;not want money, he wanted manuscripts. But when he&nbsp;reached Leyden (6th June 1738) he found that the lectures&nbsp;were over for the term and that the MSS. were not open to&nbsp;him. His money too was gone, and he passed a miserable&nbsp;summer. By and by things mended : D’Orville and A.&nbsp;Schultens helped him to private teaching and reading for&nbsp;the press, by which he was able to live, and his great power&nbsp;of work enabled him still to find time enough for his own&nbsp;studies. He heard the lectures of A. Schultens, and&nbsp;practised himself in Arabic with his son J. J. Schultens.&nbsp;Through Schultens too he got at Arabic MSS., and was&nbsp;even allowed </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sub rosa</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> to take them home with him.&nbsp;Ultimately he seems to have got free access to the collection, which he recatalogued—the work of almost a whole&nbsp;summer, for which the curators rewarded him with nine&nbsp;guilders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">In spite of his hardships Reiske’s first years in Leyden were not unhappy, till he got into serious trouble by introducing divers emendations of his own into the second&nbsp;edition of Burmann’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Petronius,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> which he had to see&nbsp;through the press. His patrons withdrew from him, and&nbsp;his chance of perhaps becoming professor was gone.&nbsp;D’Orville indeed soon came round, for he could not do&nbsp;without Reiske, who did work of which his patron, after&nbsp;dressing it up in his own style, took the credit. But A.&nbsp;Schultens was never the same as before to him; Reiske&nbsp;indeed was too independent, and hurt him by his open&nbsp;criticisms of his master’s way of making Arabic mainly a&nbsp;handmaid of Hebrew. Reiske, however, himself admits that</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Schultens, though he had reason to complain of his scholar’s want of respect towards him, always behaved honourably&nbsp;to him. In 1742 by Schultens’s ■advice Reiske took up&nbsp;medicine as a study by which he might hope to live if&nbsp;he could not do so by philology, and at medicine he worked&nbsp;hard for four years, still continuing the tasks that brought&nbsp;him bread as well as his Greek and Arabic studies. In&nbsp;1746 he graduated as M.D., the fees being remitted at&nbsp;Schultens’s intercession. It was Schultens too who conquered the difficulties opposed to his graduation at the&nbsp;last moment by the faculty of theology on the ground that&nbsp;some of his theses had a materialistic ring. On June 10,&nbsp;1746, he left Holland and settled in Leipsic, where he&nbsp;hoped to get medical practice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">But his shy proud nature was not fitted to gain patients, and the Leipsic doctors would not recommend one who&nbsp;was not a Leipsic graduate. In 1747 an Arabic dedication&nbsp;to the electoral prince of Saxony got him the title of&nbsp;professor, but did not better his circumstances. Neither&nbsp;the faculty of arts nor that of medicine was willing to&nbsp;admit him among them, and he never delivered a course of&nbsp;lectures. He had still to go on doing literary task-work, but&nbsp;his labour was much worse paid in Leipsic than in Leyden.&nbsp;Still he could have lived and sent his old mother, as his&nbsp;custom was, a yearly present of a piece of leather to be&nbsp;sold in retail if he had been a better manager. But, careless for the morrow, he was always printing at his own&nbsp;cost great books which found no buyers. And so for many&nbsp;years he lived in such misery that he often clid not know&nbsp;where to find bread to still his hunger. His academical&nbsp;colleagues were hostile; and Ernesti, under a show of friendship, secretly hindered his promotion. His slashing and&nbsp;unsparing reviews made bad blood with the pillars of the&nbsp;university.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">At length in 1758 the magistrates, of Leipsic rescued him from his misery by giving him the rectorate of St&nbsp;Nicolai, and, though he still made no way with the leading&nbsp;men of the university and suffered from the hostility of&nbsp;men like Ruhnken and J. D. Michaelis, he was compensated&nbsp;for this by the esteem of Frederick the Great, of Lessing,&nbsp;Karsten Niebuhr, and many foreign scholars. The last&nbsp;decade of his life was made cheerful by his marriage with&nbsp;Ernestine Müller, who shared all his interests and learned&nbsp;Greek to help him with collations. In proof of his&nbsp;gratitude her portrait stands beside his in the first volume&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Oratores Grseci.</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> Reiske died August 14, 1774,&nbsp;and his MS. remains passed, through Lessing’s mediation,&nbsp;to the Danish minister Suhm, and are now in the Copenhagen library.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Reiske certainly surpassed all his predecessors in the range and quality of his knowledge of Arabic literature. It was the history,&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">realia</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> of the literature, that always interested him ; he did not&nbsp;care for Arabic poetry as such, and the then much praised Hariri&nbsp;seemed to him a grammatical pedant. He read the poets for their&nbsp;bearing on history, and cared less for their verses than for such&nbsp;scholia as supplied historical notices. Thus for example the&nbsp;scholia on Jarir furnished him with a remarkable notice of the&nbsp;prevalence of Buddhist doctrine and asceticism in 'Irak under the&nbsp;Omayyads. In the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Adnotationcs Historicx</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> to his Abulfeda (</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Abulf'.&nbsp;Annalcs Moslcmici,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> 5 vols., Copenhagen, 1789-91) he collected a&nbsp;veritable treasure of sound and original research ; he knew the&nbsp;Byzantine writers as thoroughly as the Arabic authors, and was&nbsp;alike at home in modern works of travel in all languages and&nbsp;in ancient and medieval authorities. He was interested too in&nbsp;numismatics, and his letters on Arabic coinage (in Eichhorn’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Repertorium,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> vols. ix.-xi.) form, according to De Sacy, the basis&nbsp;of that branch of study. To comprehensive knowledge and very&nbsp;wide reading he added a sound historical judgment. He was&nbsp;not, like Schultens, deceived by the pretended antiquity of the&nbsp;Yemenite Kasidas.@@<sup>1</sup> Errors no doubt he made, as in the attempt&nbsp;to ascertain the date of the breach of the dam of Marib.</span></p>
