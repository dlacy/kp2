But the marble trophies now set at the top of the Capitoline steps bear a quarry&nbsp;mark which shows them to be of the time of Domitian : it consists&nbsp;of the following inscription, now not visible, as it is cut o the&nbsp;under part—IMP.

<p><span class="font1">The Circus Maximus (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Circus)</span><span class="font1"> occupied the Vallis Murcia<sup>@@2 </sup>between the Palatine and the Aventine. Its first rows of seats,&nbsp;which were of wood, are said to have been made under&nbsp;the Tarquins (Liv. i. 26, 35; Dionys. iii. .68). Permanent carceres were set up in 329 </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.</span><span class="font1"> and restored in 174 </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(Liv. viii. 20, xli. 27). In the reign of Julius Caesar it was rebuilt&nbsp;with (for the first time) lower seats of stone (Plin. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">H.N.</span><span class="font1"> xxxvi. 102),&nbsp;the upper being still of wood (Suet. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Caes.</span><span class="font1"> 39) ; Dionysius (iii. 68)&nbsp;describes it as it was after this rebuilding. 11 was further ornamented&nbsp;with marble by Augustus, Claudius and other emperors. The&nbsp;wooden part was burnt in the great fire of Nero, and again under&nbsp;Domitian; it was considerably enlarged by Trajan, and lastly&nbsp;it was restored by Constantine. In its later state it had a marble&nbsp;façade with three external tiers of arches with engaged columns,&nbsp;and (inside) sloping tiers of marble seats, supported on concrete&nbsp;raking vaults (Plin. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Paneg.</span><span class="font1"> 51). A great part of these vaults&nbsp;existed in the 16th century, and is shown by Du Perac. It is said&nbsp;by Pliny </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(H.N.</span><span class="font1"> xxxvi. 102)—if the text be not corrupt—to have&nbsp;held 250,000 spectators, while the Regionary Catalogues give the&nbsp;number of seats as 485,000; but Huelsen has shown </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Bull. Comm.&nbsp;Arch.,</span><span class="font1"> 1894, 421 ff.) that the figures are much exaggerated and must,&nbsp;moreover, be interpreted, not of the number of spectators, but of&nbsp;the length of the tiers expressed in feet. The end with the carceres&nbsp;was near the church of S. Maria in Cosmedin.<sup>@@3</sup> Some of its substructures, with remains of very early tufa structures on the Palatine&nbsp;side, still exist below the church of S. Anastasia (see Plan of Palatine).&nbsp;The obelisk now in the Piazza del Popolo.was set on the spina by&nbsp;Augustus, and that now in the Lateran piazza by Constantius II.&nbsp;The Circus Flaminius in the Campus Martius was built, in 221 </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">by the C. Flaminius Nepos who was killed at the Trasimene Lake&nbsp;in 217 B.C.; remains of the structure existed until the 16th century,&nbsp;when they were destroyed to build the Palazzo Mattei. In the&nbsp;middle ages its long open space was used as a rope-walk, hence the&nbsp;name of the church called S. Caterina dei Funàri, which occupies&nbsp;part of its site.<sup>@@4</sup> The circus of Caligula and Nero was at the foot&nbsp;of the Vatican Hill (Plin. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">H.N.</span><span class="font1"> xxxvi. 74). The modern sacristy of&nbsp;St Peter’s stands over part of its site. The obelisk on its spina remained standing </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">in situ</span><span class="font1"> till it was moved by Fontana<sup>@@5</sup> for Sixtus V.&nbsp;to its present site in the centre of the piazza. The great stadium,&nbsp;foundations of which exist under most of the houses of the Piazza&nbsp;Navona (Agonalis), and especially below S. Agnese, is that built&nbsp;by Domitian and restored by Severus Alexander. That it was a&nbsp;stadium and not a circus is shown by the fact that its starting end&nbsp;is at right angles to the sides and not set diagonally, as was always&nbsp;the case with the carceres of a circus; nor is there any trace of&nbsp;foundations of a spina. The.best, preserved circus is that built&nbsp;by Maxentius in honour of his deified son Romulus, by the Via&nbsp;Appia, 2 m. outside the walls of Rome. It was attributed to&nbsp;Caracalla till 1825, when an inscription recording its true dedication</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">-was found.<sup>@@6</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The first permanent naumachia was that constructed by Augustus between the foot of the Janiculan hill and the Tiber. The naumachia&nbsp;of Domitian was pulled down and the materials used to restore the&nbsp;Circus Maximus (Suet. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dorn.</span><span class="font1"> 5) ; it was perhaps restored by Trajan,&nbsp;for the remains of a naumachia built of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">opus reticulatum</span><span class="font1"> mixed with&nbsp;brick have been discovered.near the mausoleum of Hadrian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The first stone theatre in Rome was that built by Pompey in 55-52 </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.</span><span class="font1"> (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Theatre: </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Roman);</span><span class="font1"> it contained a temple to Venus&nbsp;Victrix, and in front of it was a great porticus, called&nbsp;Hecatostylum from its hundred columns. This is shown&nbsp;on the marble plan.<sup>@@7</sup> Considerable remains of the foundations&nbsp;exist between the Piazza dei Satiri, which occupies the site of the</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">scena, and the Via.de* Giubbonari and Via del Paradiso. Adjoining this was the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">porticus Pompeiana,</span><span class="font1"> which contained the curia of&nbsp;Pompey, where Caesar was murdered, after which it was walled&nbsp;up. The colossal statue, popularly supposed to be that of Pompey,&nbsp;at the feet of which Caesar died,<sup>@@8 </sup>now in the Palazzo Spada, was found&nbsp;in 1553 near the theatre. This theatre was restored by Augustus&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Mon. Anc.</span><span class="font1"> 4, 9); in the reign of Tiberius it was burnt, and its&nbsp;rebuilding was completed by Caligula. The scena was again burnt&nbsp;in </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font1"> 80, and restored by Titus. According to Pliny </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(H.N.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">xxxvi. 115), it held 40,000 spectators; the Regionary. Catalogues&nbsp;give the number 17,580. Huelsen estimates its capacity at 9000-10,000 spectators. In 1864 the colossal gilt bronze statue of Hercules,&nbsp;now in the Vatican, was found near the site of the theatre of Pompey,&nbsp;carefully concealed underground.. The theatre of Marcellus is much&nbsp;more perfect; complete foundations of the cunei exist under the&nbsp;Palazzo Savelli, and part of the external arcade is well preserved.&nbsp;This is built, of travertine, in two orders, Tuscan and Ionic, with&nbsp;delicate details, very superior to. those of the Colosseum, the arcade&nbsp;of which is very similar to this in general design. This theatre&nbsp;was. begun, by J. Caesar, and finished by Augustus in 13 B.c., who&nbsp;dedicated it in the name of his nephew Marcellus.<sup>@@9</sup> It was restored&nbsp;by Vespasian (Suet. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vesp.</span><span class="font1"> 19). Foundations also of the theatre&nbsp;dedicated by Cornelius Balbus in 13 B.c. (Suet. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Aug.</span><span class="font1"> 29; Dio&nbsp;Cass. liv. 25) exist under the.Monte dei Cenci; and in the Via.dei&nbsp;Calderari there is a small portion of the external arcade of a porticus&nbsp;(Plan, No. 42); the lower storey has travertine arches with engaged&nbsp;columns, and the upper has brick-faced pilasters. This has been supposed to be the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Crypta Balbi</span><span class="font1"> mentioned in the Regionary Catalogues,&nbsp;but is more probably the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Porticus Minucia,</span><span class="font1"> built in no </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.</span><span class="font1"> An&nbsp;interesting account o.l the temporary theatre of M. Aemilius Scaurus,&nbsp;erected in 58 B.c., is given by Pliny </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(H.N.</span><span class="font1"> xxxvi. 5, 113). The&nbsp;same writer mentions an almost incredible building, which consisted&nbsp;ot two wooden theatres made to revolve on pivots, so that the two&nbsp;together made an amphitheatre; this was erected by C. Curio in&nbsp;50 </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(H.N.</span><span class="font1"> xxxvi. 116).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The first stone amphitheatre in Rome was that built by Statilius Taurus in the reign of Augustus. (For the Colosseum and&nbsp;the Amphitheatrum Castrense, see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Amphitheatre;</span><span class="font1"> for&nbsp;the Baths, see that article.)</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">The earliest triumphal arches were the two erected by L. Stertinius (196 </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.)</span><span class="font1"> in the Forum Boarium and in the Circus Maximus, out&nbsp;of spoils gained in Spain.<sup>@@10</sup> In the later years of the&nbsp;empire there were nearly forty in Rome. The arch&nbsp;of Titus and Vespasian on the Sum ma Sacra Via was erected by&nbsp;Domitian to commemorate the conquest of Judaea by Titus in his&nbsp;father’s reign. Reliefs inside the arch represent the triumphal&nbsp;procession—Titus in a chariot, and on the other side soldiers bearing&nbsp;the golden candlestick, trumpets and table of prothesis, taken from&nbsp;the Jewish temple. The central part only of this monument is&nbsp;original; the sides were restored in 1823.<sup>@@11</sup> Another arch in honour&nbsp;of'Titus .had previously been built </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">(a.d.</span><span class="font1"> 80) in the Circus. Maximus;&nbsp;its inscription is given in the Einsiedeln MS. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(C.I.L.</span><span class="font1"> vi. 944). A&nbsp;plain travertine arch, near the supposed palace of Commodus on&nbsp;the Caelian is inscribed with the names of the Consul Publius&nbsp;Cornelius Dolabella </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">(a.d. io)</span><span class="font1"> and of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ihzflamen martialis,</span><span class="font1"> C.

The so-called arch of Drusus by the Porta Appia also carries the specus of&nbsp;an aqueduct—that built by Caracalla to supply his great thermae.&nbsp;Its composite capitals show, however, that it is later than the time&nbsp;of Drusus, and it was very possibly the work of Trajan. Adjoining&nbsp;the church of S. Giorgio in Velabro a rich though coarsely, decorated&nbsp;marble gateway with fiat lintel still exists—built, as its inscription&nbsp;records, in honour of Severus and his sons by the argentarii (bankers&nbsp;and silversmiths) and other merchants of the Forum Boarium in 204.&nbsp;It formed an entrance from the Forum Boarium into the Velabrum.&nbsp;The figure of Geta in the reliefs and his name have been erased by&nbsp;Caracalla; the sculpture is poor both in design and execution (see&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bull.
