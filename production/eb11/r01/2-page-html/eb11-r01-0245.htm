<p><span class="font2">is desired to cool. One end (generally the bottom) of the coils is connected to the liquid pipe from the condenser and the other end&nbsp;to the suction of the compressor.&nbsp;Liquid from the condenser is admitted&nbsp; to the coils through an adjustable regulating valve, and by&nbsp;taking heat from the substance outside&nbsp; is evaporated, the vapour being&nbsp;continually drawn off by the compressor&nbsp; and discharged under increased&nbsp;pressure into the condenser. The&nbsp;condenser is constructed of coils like&nbsp;the refrigerator, the cooling water being contained in a tank; frequently&nbsp;, however, a series of open coils is employed, the cooling&nbsp;water falling over the coils into a collecting tray below, and this&nbsp;form is perhaps the most convenient for ordinary use as it affords&nbsp;great facilities for inspection and painting. The compressor may&nbsp;be driven by a steam engine or in any other convenient manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The pressure in the condenser varies according to the temperature of the cooling water, and that in the refrigerator is dependent&nbsp;upon the temperature to which the outside substance is cooled.&nbsp;In an ammonia machine copper and copper alloys must be avoided,&nbsp;but for carbonic acid they are not objectionable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The compression of ammonia is sometimes carried out on what is known as the Linde or “ wet ” system, and sometimes on the&nbsp;“ dry ” system. When wet compression is used the  regulating&nbsp;valve is opened to such an extent that a little more liquid is passed&nbsp;than can be evaporated in the refrigerator. This liquid enters the&nbsp;compressor with the vapour, and is evaporated there, the heat&nbsp;taken up preventing the rise in temperature during compression&nbsp;which would otherwise take place. The compressed vapour is discharged&nbsp; at a temperature but little above that of the cooling water.&nbsp;With dry compression, vapour alone is drawn into the compressor,&nbsp;and the temperature rises to as much as 180 or 200 degrees. Wet&nbsp;compression theoretically is not quite so efficient as dry compression,&nbsp;but it possesses practical advantages in keeping the working parts&nbsp;of the compressor cool, and it also greatly facilitates the regulation&nbsp;of the liquid, and ensures the full duty of the machine being continuously&nbsp; performed. Very exact comparative trials have been made&nbsp;by Professor M. Schroeter and others with compression machines&nbsp;using sulphur dioxide and ammonia. The results are published in&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vergleichende Versuche an Kältemaschinen,</span><span class="font2"> by Schroeter, Munich,&nbsp;1890, and in Nos. 32 and 51 of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bayerisches Industrie und Gewerbeblatt,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">1892.

<p><span class="font3">The principle of the absorption process is chemical or physical rather than mechanical; it depends on the fact that many&nbsp;vapours of low boiling-point are readily absorbed in&nbsp;water, and can be separated again by the application&nbsp;of heat. In its simplest form an absorption machine&nbsp;consists of two iron vessels connected together by a bent pipe.&nbsp;One of these contains a mixture of ammonia and water, which&nbsp;on the application of heat gives off a mixed vapour containing&nbsp;a large proportion of ammonia, a liquid containing but little&nbsp;ammonia being left behind. In the second vessel, which is&nbsp;placed in cold water, the vapour rich in ammonia is condensed&nbsp;under pressure. To produce refrigeration the operation is&nbsp;reversed. On allowing the weak liquor to cool to normal&nbsp;temperature, it becomes greedy of ammonia (at 60° F. at&nbsp;atmospheric pressure water will absorb about 760 times its own&nbsp;volume of ammonia vapour), and this produces an evaporation&nbsp;from the liquid in the vessel previously used as a condenser.&nbsp;This liquid, containing a large proportion of ammonia, gives off&nbsp;vapour at a low temperature, and therefore becomes a refrigerator&nbsp;abstracting heat from water or any surrounding body. When&nbsp;the ammonia is evaporated the operation as described must&nbsp;be again commenced. Such an apparatus is not much used now.&nbsp;Larger and more elaborate machines were made by F. P. E.&nbsp;Carré in France; but no very high degree of perfection was&nbsp;arrived at, owing to the impossibility of getting an anhydrous&nbsp;product of distillation. In 1867 Rees Reece, taking advantage&nbsp;of the fact that two vapours of different boiling-points, when&nbsp;mixed, can be separated by means of fractional condensation,&nbsp;brought out an absorption machine in which the distillate was&nbsp;very nearly anhydrous. By means of vessels termed the&nbsp;analyser and the rectifier, the bulk of the water was condensed&nbsp;at a comparatively high temperature and run back to the&nbsp;generator, while the ammonia passed into a condenser, and there&nbsp;assumed the liquid form under the pressure produced by the&nbsp;heat in the generator and the cooling action of water circulating&nbsp;outside the condenser tubes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Fig. 4 is a diagram of an absorption apparatus. The ammonia vapour given off in the refrigerator is absorbed by a cold weak&nbsp;solution of ammonia and</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">water in the absorber, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">the strong liquor is pumped</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">back into the generator</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">through an interchanger</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">through which also the weak</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">hot liquor from the generator</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">passes on its way to the</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">absorber. In this way the</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">condenser. From the con-</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">denser it passes into the refrigerator through a regulating valve in the usual manner. The process is continuous, and is identical with that&nbsp;of the compression machine, with the exception of the return from&nbsp;the temperature T<sub>1</sub> to the temperature T<sub>2</sub>, which is brought about&nbsp;by the direct application of heat instead of by means of mechanical compression. With the same temperature range, however, the&nbsp;same amount of heat has to be acquired in both cases, though from&nbsp;the nature of the process the actual amount of heat demanded from&nbsp;the steam is much greater in the absorption system than in the&nbsp;compression. This is chiefly due to the fact that in the former&nbsp;the heat of vaporization acquired in the refrigerator is rejected in&nbsp;the absorber, so that the whole heat of vaporization has to be&nbsp;supplied again by the steam in the generator. In the latter the&nbsp;vapour passes direct from the refrigerator to the pump; and power&nbsp;has to be expended merely in raising the temperature to a sufficient&nbsp;degree to enable condensation to occur at the temperature of the&nbsp;cooling water. On the other hand, a great advantage is gained in&nbsp;the absorption machine by using the direct heat of the steam,&nbsp;without first converting it into mechanical work, for in this way its&nbsp;latent heat of vaporization pan be utilized by condensing the&nbsp;steam in the coils and letting it escape in the form of water. Each&nbsp;pound of steam can thus be made to give up some 950 units of&nbsp;heat; while in a good steam engine only about 200 units are utilized&nbsp;in the steam cylinder per pound of steam, and in addition allowance&nbsp;has to be made for mechanical inefficiency. In the absorption&nbsp;machine the cooling water has to take up about twice as much&nbsp;heat as in the compression system, owing to the ammonia being&nbsp;twice liquefied—namely, once in the absorber and once in the&nbsp;condenser. It is usual to pass the cooling water first through the&nbsp;condenser and then through the absorber.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The absorption machine is not so economical as the compression; but an actual comparison between the two systems is difficult to make. Information on this head is given in papers read by Dr.&nbsp;Linde and by Professor J. A. Ewing before the Society of Arts&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Journal of the Society of Arts,</span><span class="font2"> vol. xlii., 1894, p. 322, and Howard&nbsp;Lectures, January, February and March 1897).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">An absorption apparatus as applied to the cooling of liquids consists of a generator containing coils to which steam is supplied&nbsp;at suitable pressure, an analyser, a rectifier, a condenser either of&nbsp;the submerged or open type, a refrigerator in which the nearly&nbsp;anhydrous ammonia obtained in the condenser is allowed to evaporate, an absorber through which the weak liquor from the generator&nbsp; continually flows and absorbs the anhydrous vapour produced&nbsp;in the refrigerator, and a pump for forcing the strong liquor produced&nbsp;in the absorber back through an economizer into the analyser&nbsp;where, meeting with steam from the generator, the ammonia gas&nbsp;is again driven off, the process being thus carried on continuously.&nbsp;Sometimes an additional vessel is employed for heating liquor by&nbsp;means of the exhaust steam from the engine driving the ammonia&nbsp;pump. Absorption machines are also made without a pump for&nbsp;returning the strong liquor to the generator. In these cases they&nbsp;work intermittently. In some machines the same vessel is used&nbsp;alternately as a venerator and absorber, while in others, in order</span></p>
