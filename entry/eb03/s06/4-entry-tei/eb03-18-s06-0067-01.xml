a Greek writer, according to ſome, flouriſhed in the 11th century, under the reign of the Emperor Alexius Comnenus ; according to others, before the 10th century. He wrote in Greek an Hiſtorical and Geographical Dictionary or Lexicon ; a work which, though not always ſtrictly accurate, is nevertheleſs of great importance, as it contains many things taken from the ancients that are nowhere elſe to be found. The beſt edition of Suidas is that of Kuiſter, in Greek and Latin, with notes, printed in 3 vols fol. which has been much improved by Toup.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Lapis</hi> SUILLUS.
