<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">we meet with the first indications of a reformation of doctrine. During the years 1511-14 Erasmus had filled&nbsp;the post of Lady Margaret professor of divinity at Cambridge, and the publication of his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Novum Instrumentum&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">in 1516 was directly the outcome of his labours during&nbsp;that period. Thomas Bilney, the martyr, a member of&nbsp;Trinity Hall and one of the most eminent of the Reformers,&nbsp;expressly attributes his conversion to the influence of&nbsp;Erasmus’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">New Testament.</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> Around Bilney there gathered&nbsp;a little band of Cambridge scholars,—Shaxton, Crome,&nbsp;Skip, Rogers, Lambert, Heynes, Taverner, Parker, and&nbsp;others. It was their custom to meet together at an&nbsp;inn known by the sign of the “White Horse.” In the&nbsp;first instance, their attention was chiefly given to the&nbsp;Scriptures themselves, but subsequently to the writings of&nbsp;Luther. The inn then began to be styled “ Germany ”&nbsp;by their enemies; and such would appear to be the first&nbsp;commencement of the Reformation in England. That&nbsp;commencement was illustrated by an incident which not a&nbsp;little resembles the better-known incident associated with&nbsp;the career of Luther. On the appearance of the papal&nbsp;proclamation of indulgences in 1517 a copy had been&nbsp;affixed to the gate of the common schools in the university.&nbsp;The same night a young Norman student, of the name of&nbsp;Peter de Valence, wrote over the proclamation a few Latin&nbsp;words denouncing the theory of indulgences as a superstition. He was forthwith summoned to appear before the&nbsp;vice-chancellor in order to account for his conduct, and on&nbsp;failing to do so was formally excommunicated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">In the month of January 1519 the emperor Maximilian I. died, and the imperial dignity, declined by Frederick of&nbsp;Saxony, descended to Charles V. Of the three monarchs&nbsp;who had aspired to this supreme honour Henry VIII. was&nbsp;now in his twenty-ninth year, Francis I. in his twenty-sixth,&nbsp;and Charles V. in his nineteenth. The English monarch,&nbsp;at this time both zealous and devout, was eager to give&nbsp;some proof of his loyalty to the Catholic Church, and had&nbsp;he occupied the place of Charles the career of Luther would&nbsp;probably have been soon arrested. The great Reformer&nbsp;owed his safety at this critical period mainly to the armed&nbsp;chivalry of Germany, which rallied ominously to his support.&nbsp;On no occasion was its presence more sensibly felt than at&nbsp;the diet of Worms (May 1521). The memorable edict (see&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Luther), </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">signed on the same day as that on which the&nbsp;pope and the young emperor concluded their compact for&nbsp;the reconquest of Milan from the French, marks the crowning triumph of the policy of Leo and Alexander. But&nbsp;Charles, who looked upon Luther as a means of bringing&nbsp;pressure to bear upon the pontiff which might prove useful&nbsp;in a future emergency, was determined not to surrender&nbsp;the bold professor, for the present, to his enemies. To&nbsp;Henry, who was influenced by no such secular considerations, Luther’s contumacy appeared to call for authoritative rebuke in every land; and in July 1521 he produced,&nbsp;in reply to the treatise on </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Babylonian Captivity,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> his&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Defence of the Sacraments.</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> The book passed rapidly&nbsp;through several editions, was translated into German, and,&nbsp;to quote the expression of Cochlseus, “ filled the whole&nbsp;Christian world with joy and admiration.” Such an effort&nbsp;from such a quarter called for distinguished recognition.&nbsp;Francis was already styled the eldest son of the church.&nbsp;The imperial dignity presupposed a not less conspicuous&nbsp;fidelity. The titles of “ Most Christian ” or “ Most Catholic ” could not accordingly be vouchsafed to the English&nbsp;monarch. He was therefore rewarded with the newly-coined title of “ Defender of the Faith.” Sir Thomas More&nbsp;and Bishop Fisher both imitated their royal master’s example&nbsp;by also compiling a tractate in reply to Luther; but the&nbsp;Reformer, in his rejoinder to the royal polemic, called its&nbsp;author a fool and designated him the “Pharaoh of England.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The death of Leo X. in 1521 was coincident with an im- ] portant crisis in Italian history. Milan had been wrested </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">]&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">from the French by the allied papal and imperial forces, ־&nbsp;and the realization of that scheme of national unity and&nbsp;independence for which he and his predecessor had laboured&nbsp;seemed no longer a dream of the future. In the midst of&nbsp;his exultation—partly, it is said, as the result of it—Leo&nbsp;died, and seldom in the annals of the pa!&gt;acy had an election to the office been attended with equal interest and&nbsp;excitement. Wolsey eventually was out-manoeuvred by the&nbsp;imperial party, and the emperor’s former preceptor, the&nbsp;irreproachable, austere, and rigidly devout Adrian (VI.) of&nbsp;Utrecht (1522-1523) succeeded to the papal chair. After&nbsp;a few months’ tenure of the office he too gave place to&nbsp;another, and the house of Medici was again represented in&nbsp;the person of Clement VII. (1523-1534). In this election&nbsp;Wolsey was again a candidate, and a second time he had&nbsp;reason to believe that he owed his defeat to the emperor,&nbsp;an injury which he never forghve. In not a few respects&nbsp;Clement was admirably qualified to cope with the difficulties by which he found himself surrounded. He had&nbsp;been at once the most trusted and the ablest of Leo’s&nbsp;advisers; his attainments and experience were such as in&nbsp;every way corresponded to the requirements of his office,&nbsp;for, while well versed in philosophy and theology, he had&nbsp;also mastered the political and ecclesiastical questions of&nbsp;the day, and his clear perception enabled him to grasp the&nbsp;essential features of his policy with remarkable skill and&nbsp;promptitude. His position, however, was one of extreme&nbsp;perplexity, alike in its diplomatic and its theological relations. To no power had he and his house rendered greater&nbsp;services than to Spain; ever since, indeed, the pontificate&nbsp;of Alexander VI., the papacy had, often without designing&nbsp;it, been the instrument of imperial aggrandizement. With&nbsp;the accession of Clement, however, these relations are to&nbsp;be seen assuming a new phase. The election of Charles&nbsp;V. as emperor awoke in the proud representative of the&nbsp;great house of the Medici the sense of a new danger;&nbsp;and the prospect of Milan, Naples, and the empire being&nbsp;concentrated in a single hand was one which no Italian&nbsp;potentate could be expected to contemplate with equanimity. The retreat of Bourbon from Italy, on the other&nbsp;hand, had caused the Curia to look with altered sentiments&nbsp;on the policy of France; and if Clement’s advice and good&nbsp;wishes could have availed aught the great disaster at Pavia&nbsp;would have been averted. The emperor ־was far from&nbsp;unaware how little he had throughout been indebted to&nbsp;Clement’s good offices, and before he led his army into&nbsp;Italy had been heard to avow his intention of avenging&nbsp;himself “on that poltroon the pope.” “Some day or&nbsp;other,” he added, “perhaps Martin Luther may become&nbsp;a man of worth.” The battle of Pavia (February 1525)&nbsp;followed, and its results seemed to threaten the overthrow&nbsp;of that balance of power which it was the aim of the chief&nbsp;leaders of the new nationalities to maintain; both Wolsey&nbsp;and Clement VII. alike now regarded with dismay the&nbsp;proportions which the power of Spain was assuming. “ It&nbsp;is no trivial question, no single state, that is concerned in&nbsp;the coming contest,” exclaimed Clement’s minister; “ this&nbsp;war will decide the freedom or the eternal slavery of Italy.”&nbsp;In July 1526 the papal troops had already entered&nbsp;Lombardy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Such were the circumstances under which the Clementine League (22d May 1526) was formed, with the general assent of the Italian states, but with the usual disregard of&nbsp;the state of opinion north of the Alps. But it was hardly&nbsp;reasonable to expect that Ferdinand of Austria would be&nbsp;solicitous to uphold the papal interests in Germany when&nbsp;the imperial interests were being thus vigorously assailed&nbsp;in Italy.
