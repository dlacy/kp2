<p><span class="font0">proper meaſures to prevent their being ſurpriſed and overwhelmed by a ſuperior force ; but, before the hor-rors of war commenced, the great reformer Luther died&nbsp;in peace at Ayſelben, the place of his nativity, in 1546.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The emperor and the pope had mutually reſolved on the deſtruction of all who ſhonld dare to oppoſe the&nbsp;council of Trent. The meeting of it was to ſerve as a&nbsp;ſignal for taking up arms ; and accordingly its deliberations were fcarcely begun in 1546, when the Proteſtants perceived undoubted ſigns of the approaching&nbsp;ftorm, and a formidable union betwixt the emperor&nbsp;and pope, which threatened to cruſh and overwhelm&nbsp;them at once. This year indeed there had been a new&nbsp;conference at Ratiſbon upon the old fubject of accom-modating differences in religion ; but from the manner&nbsp;in which the debates were carried on, it plainly ap-peared that theſe differences could only be decided in&nbsp;the field of battle. The council of Trent, in the mean&nbsp;time, promulgated their decrees ; while the reformed&nbsp;princes, in the diet of Ratiſhon, proteſted againſt&nbsp;their authority, and were on that account profcribed&nbsp;By the emperor, who raiſed an army to reduce them to&nbsp;obedience. See </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Father Paul’s Hiftory oſ the Council oſ&nbsp;Trent,</span><span class="font0"> and our articles Paul (Father), and Trent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The elector of Saxony and the landgrave of Hefle led their forces into Bavaria againſt the emperor, and&nbsp;cannonaded his camp at Ingoldſtalt. It was ſuppoſed&nbsp;that this would bring on an engagement, which would&nbsp;probably have been advantageous to the cauſe of the&nbsp;reformed ; but this was prevented, chiefly by the per-ſidy of Maurice duke of Saxony, who invaded the dominions of his uncle. Diviſions were alſo fomented&nbsp;among the confederate princes, by the diffimulation of&nbsp;the emperor ; and France failed in paying the ſubſidy&nbsp;which had been promiſed by its monarch : all which&nbsp;ſo diſcouraged the heads of the Proteſtant party, that&nbsp;their army ſoon diſperſed, and the elector of Saxony&nbsp;was obliged to direct his march homewards. But he&nbsp;was purſued by the emperor, who made ſeveral forced&nbsp;marches, with a view to deſtroy his enemy before he&nbsp;ſhould have time to recover his vigour. The two armies met near Muhlberg, on the Elbe, on the 24th of&nbsp;April 1547 ; and, after a bloody action, the elector&nbsp;was entirely defeated, and himſelf taken priſoner.—&nbsp;Maurice, who had ſo baſely betrayed him, was now&nbsp;declared elector of Saxony ; and by his intreaties Philip landgrave of Heſſe, the other chief of the Prote-ſtants, was perſuaded to throw himfelf on the mercy of&nbsp;the emperor, and to implore his pardon. To this he&nbsp;conſented, relying on the promiſe of Charles for obtaining forgiveneſs, and being reſtored to liberty ; but, not-withſtanding theſe expectations, he was unjuſtly detained priſoner, by a fcandalous violation of the moſt ſolemn convention. It is faid that the emperor retracted his promiſe, and deluded this unhappy prince by&nbsp;the ambiguity of two German words. Hiſtory in-deed can ſcarce afford a parallel to the perfidious,&nbsp;mean-ſpirited, and deſpotic behaviour of the emperor&nbsp;in the preſent caſe. After having received in pub-lic the humble ſubmiſſion of the prince on his knees,&nbsp;and after having ſet him at liberty by a ſolemn&nbsp;treaty, he had him arreſted anew without any reafon,&nbsp;nay, without any pretence, and kept him cloſe priſoner for ſeveral years, when Maurice remonſtrated&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">againſt this new confinement, the emperor anfwered<sub>i</sub> .</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">that he had never promiſed that the </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">landgrave fhould </span><span class="font0">not be impriſoned anew, but only that he ſhould be&nbsp;exempted from perpetual imprifonment ; and, to ſupport this aſſertion, he produced the treaty, in which&nbsp;his miniſters had perſidioufly foiſted </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ewiger gefangnis,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">which ſigniſies a &quot; perpetual prifon,” inſtead of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">einiger&nbsp;gsfuιgnis,</span><span class="font0"> which ſigniſies &quot; any prifon.” This, however, is conteſted by ſome hiſtorians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The affairs of the Proteſtants now ſeemed to be de-ſperate. In the diet of Augſhurg, which was ſoon after called, the emperor required the Proteſtants to&nbsp;leave the deciſion of theſe religious diſputes to the&nbsp;wiſdom of the council which was to meet at Trent.&nbsp;The greateſt part of the members conſented to this&nbsp;propoſal, being convinced by the powerful argument&nbsp;of an imperial army, which was at hand to diſpel the&nbsp;darkneſs from the eyes of ſuch as might otherwiſe&nbsp;have been blind to the force of Charles’s reaſoning.&nbsp;However, this general ſubmiffion did not produce the&nbsp;effect which was expected from it. A plague which&nbsp;broke out, or was ſaid to do ſo, in the city, cauſed the&nbsp;greateſt part of the biſhops to retire to Bologna ; by&nbsp;which means the council was in effect diſſolved, nor&nbsp;could all the intreaties and remonſtrances of the emperor prevail upon the pope to re-aſſemble it without&nbsp;delay. During this interval, therefore, the emperor&nbsp;judged it neceſſary to fall upon ſome method of ac-commodating the religious differences, and maintaining peace until the council ſo long expected ſhould be&nbsp;finally obtained, with this view he ordered Julius&nbsp;Pelugius bilhop of Naumberg, Michael Sidonius, a&nbsp;creature of the pope, and John Agricola, a native&nbsp;of Ayſelben, to draw up a formulary which might&nbsp;ſerve as a rule of faith and worſhip, till the council&nbsp;ſhould be affembled : but as this was only a temporary&nbsp;expedient, and had not the force of a permanent or&nbsp;perpetual inſtitution, it thence obtained the name of&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Interim.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This project of Charles was formed partly with </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font0">deſign to vent his reſentment againſt the pope, and&nbsp;partly to anſwer other political purpoſes. It contain-ed all the eſſential doctrines of the church of Rome,&nbsp;though conſiderably foftened by the artful terms which&nbsp;were employed, and which were quite different from&nbsp;thoſe employed before and after this period by the&nbsp;council of Trent. There was even an affected ambiguity in many oſ the expreffiυns, which made them&nbsp;ſufceptible of different ſenſes, and applicable to the&nbsp;ſentiments of both communions. The conſequence&nbsp;of all this was, that the imperial creed was reprobated&nbsp;by both parties. However, it was promulgated with&nbsp;great ſolemnity by the emperor at Augſhurg. The&nbsp;elector of Mentz, without even afl&lt;ing the opinion of&nbsp;the princes preſent, gave a ſanction </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Λ,ο</span><span class="font0"> this formula,&nbsp;as if he had been commiffioned to repreſent the whole&nbsp;diet- Many kept ſilence through fear, and that ſilence&nbsp;was interpreted as a tacit conſent. Some had the&nbsp;courage to oppoſe it, and theſe were reduced by force&nbsp;of arms ; and the moſt deplorable ſcenes of bloodſhed&nbsp;and violence were acted throughout the whole empire.&nbsp;Maurice, elector of Saxony, who had hitherto kept&nbsp;neutral, now affembled the whole of his nobility and&nbsp;clergy, in order to deliberate on this critical affair.&nbsp;At the head of the latter was Melancthon, whoſe word&nbsp;was </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">reſpected as a law </span><span class="font0">among </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">the Proteſtants. </span><span class="font0">But</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
