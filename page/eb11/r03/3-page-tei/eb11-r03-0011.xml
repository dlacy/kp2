Araceae, native in South Africa, to which the “ arum lily ” belongs. They are all greenhouse herbaceous plants of handsome appearance, with thick underground stems and large, more or less fleshy, long-stalked, arrow-shaped leaves and white or yellow flower spathes. They are readily propagated by division of the shoot, also by seed. Water should be given abundantly at all times, and the soil for potting should be rich and retentive. Potting is best effected in spring, and from the end of June to the end of August they should be plunged in a sunny spot out of doors. They will not withstand frost, and should be wintered in a warm greenhouse. They flower throughout the year.</p><p>RICHARDS, ALFRED BATE (1820-1876), English journalist, was born in Worcestershire on the 17th of February 1820, and was educated at Westminster School and Exeter College, Oxford. After taking his degree in 1841 he published, anonymously, <hi rend="italic">Oxford Unmasked,</hi>  a denunciation of abuses in the university. Between 1845 and 1848 he wrote several dramas and some poetry, and in the latter year became editor of a weekly newspaper, the <hi rend="italic">British Army Despatch.</hi>  His temperament was strongly Imperialist; he opposed Cobden and the Manchester school of politicians, and in a volume entitled <hi rend="italic">Britain Redeemed and Canada Preserved</hi>  predicted, thirty years before the event, the construction of the Canadian Pacific railway. In 1855 he was appointed the first editor of the London <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph,</hi>  and through the medium of that journal strongly urged the formation of volunteer rifle corps. The National and Constitutional Defence Association was established in 1858 to carry out the idea. Richards himself raised a regiment of a thousand working men in London, becoming major and subsequently colonel of the corps. In 1870 he was appointed editor of the London <hi rend="italic">Morning Advertiser,</hi>  and retained this position till his death on the 12th of June 1876.</p><p>RICHARDS, HENRY BRINLEY (1819-1865), English pianist and composer, was born at Carmarthen, and educated at the Royal Academy of Music in London, where later he was <hi rend="bold">a </hi>professor. He took much interest in Welsh music and in the Eisteddfod gatherings. He was a prolific composer, but is perhaps principally remembered for writing the song “ God bless the Prince of Wales ” (1862), which has been adopted as an English national anthem.</p><p>RICHARDS, WILLIAM TROST (1833-1905), American marine painter, was born at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on the 14th of November 1833. He was a pupil of Paul Weber in his native city, and lived much in France, Italy and London. He was a member of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, and of the American Water Colour Society. Examples of his work are in the collections of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Philadelphia, Penn.; the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, the Corcoran Art Gallery, Washington, D.C., and the Schaube Gallery, Hamburg. He died at Newport, Rhode Island, on the 8th of November 1905. His daughter <hi rend="smallcaps">Anna</hi>  M. <hi rend="smallcaps">Richards</hi>  (b. 1870), figure and landscape painter, was a pupil of John La Farge and Benjamin Constant.</p><p>RICHARDSON, GEORGE, English 18th-century architect and designer. The dates of birth and death of this distinguished contemporary and rival of the brothers Adam are not ascertained, but he is conjectured to have been bom about 1736 and to have died in 1817. Richardson spent three years— from 1760 to 1763—travelling in Dalmatia and Istria, in the south of France and in Italy. During that period he imbibed' the inspiration of a lifetime, and acquired the material for its practical application. He soon began to show remarkable skill in adapting classical ideals to the uses of his time, and in 1765 he won a premium offered, by the Society of Arts for a design of a street in the classical manner. Richardson’s work is so closely allied to that of the brothers Adam that it is often difficult to distinguish between them, and if it possessed less freedom and variety, and bore to a smaller extent the impress of an original mind, it was in the main exceedingly admirable and satisfying. Richardson was an especially successful designer of ceilings and chimneypieces. He published in 1776 a <hi rend="italic">Book of Ceilings in the Style of the Antique Grotesque.</hi>  Many of its drawings are of exquisite taste. Nor is his fireplace work, as represented by his <hi rend="italic">Collection of Chimneypieces Ornamented in the Style of the Etruscan, Greek and Roman Architecture</hi>  (1781), less attractive. Richardson’s chimneypieces are still to be found in considerable numbers in town and country houses. They are mostly of marble, but examples in wood are not uncommon. He made extensive use of coloured marbles, and the effect is constantly that of the sumptuous balancing the austere. Like the Adams, Richardson often worked with composition enrichments, and his <hi rend="italic">New Designs in Architecture</hi>  (1792) contains many drawings of interior friezes and columns to be executed either in this medium or painted to suit the wall hangings. His versatility was considerable, as the titles of his works, a dozen in number, suggest. For many years he exhibited at the Royal Academy as well as in the Galleries of the Society of Arts. Why such a man should have fallen into penury in his old age we have no means of ascertaining, but we know that his necessities were relieved by Nollekens.</p><p>His principal works in addition to those already mentioned were; in chronological order; <hi rend="italic">Aedes Pernbrochianae</hi>  (1774); <hi rend="italic">Jconology </hi>(2 vols.), with plates by Bartolozzi and other engravers (1778-1779) ; <hi rend="italic">New Designs in Architecture</hi>  (1792); <hi rend="italic">Original Designs for Country Seats or Villas</hi>  (1795); <hi rend="italic">The New Vitruvius Britannicus<hi rend="sub">i</hi></hi>  a sequel to Colin Campbell’s <hi rend="italic">Vitruvius Britanniens,</hi>  2 vols. (1802); <hi rend="italic">Ornaments in the Grecian, Roman and Etruscan Tastes</hi>  (1816). He also published volumes dealing with vases and tripods, antique friezes and other architectural and decorative details.</p><p>RICHARDSON, HENRY HOBSON (1838-1886), American architect, was born-in the parish of St James, Louisiana, on the 29th of September 1838, of a rich family, his mother being a granddaughter of the famous Dr Priestley, the English dissenting refugee and man of science. He was graduated from Harvard University in 1859, and going immediately to Paris to study architecture, entered the École des Beaux-Arts. The Civil War, which broke out in the United States while he was in the school, prevented his return to Louisiana, and stripped his family of their possessions, so that Richardson provided for his own support by working in the offices of practising architects in Paris, till the fall of 1865. Coming back, he established himself in New York, where he soon made his <hi rend="bold">way </hi>into practice as an architect. In 1878 he moved to Boston, where he passed the remaining years of his life, designing there most of the work that made his reputation. He had married in 1867 Miss Julia Gorham Hayden of Boston; he died on the 27th of April 1886, not yet forty-eight years old.</p><p>Richardson’s career was short, and the number of his works was small indeed compared with the attention they attracted and the influence he left behind him. The most important and characteristic are: Trinity church and the so-called Brattle Square church, in Boston; the alterations in the State Capitol at Albany; the county buildings at Pittsburg; town halls at Albany, Springfield and North Easton; town libraries at Woburn, North Easton, Quincy, Burlington and Malden; Sever Hall and Austin Hall at Harvard University; the Chamber of Commerce at Cincinnati. Trinity church, the Pittsburg buildings and the Capitol at Albany were works of great importance, which have had a strong influence on men</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
