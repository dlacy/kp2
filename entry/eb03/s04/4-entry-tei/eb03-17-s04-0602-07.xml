one of the ſeven wiſe men of Greece, was born at Salamis, of Athenian parents, who were deſcended from Codrus. His father leaving little patrimony, he had recourſe to merchandiſe for his ſubſiſtence. He had, however, a greater thirſt after knowledge and fame than after riches, and made his mercantile voyages ſubſervient to the increaſe of his intellectual treaſures. He very early cultivated the art of poetry, and applied himſelf to the ſtudy of moral and civil wiſdom. When the Athenians, tired out with a long and troubleſome war with the Megarenſians, for the recovery of the iſle of Salamis, prohibited any one, under pain of death, to propoſe the renewal of their claim to that iſland, Solon thinking the prohibition diſhonourable to the ſtate, and finding many of the younger citizens deſirous to revive the war, feigned himſelf mad, and took care to have the report of his insanity ſpread thro’ the city. In the mean time he compoſed an elegy adapted to the ſtate of public affairs, which he committed to memory. Every thing being thus prepared, he ſallied forth into the market-place with the kind of cap on his head which was commonly worn by ſick perſons, and, aſcending the herald’s ſtand, he delivered, to a numerous crowd, his lamentation for the deſertion of Salamis. The verſes were heard with general applauſe ; and Piſiſtratus ſeconded his advice, and urged the people to renew the war. The decree was immediately repealed ; the claim to Salamis was reſumed ; and the conduct of the war was committed to Solon and Piſiſtratus, who, by means of a ſtratagem, defeated the Megarenſians, and recovered Salamis.</p><p>His popularity was extended through Greece in conſequence of a ſucceſsful alliance which he formed among the states in defence of the temple at Delphos againſt the Cirrhæans. When diſſenſions had ariſen at Athens between the rich creditors and their poor debtors, Solon was created archon, with the united powers of ſupreme legiſlator and magiſtrate. He ſoon reſtored harmony between the rich and poor : He cancelled the debts which had proved the occaſion of ſo much oppreſſion ; and ordained that in future no creditor ſhould be allowed to ſeize the body of the debtor for his ſecurity : He made a new diſtribution of the people, inſtituted new courts of judicature, and framed a judicious code of laws, which afterwards became the baſis of the laws of the twelve tables in Rome. Among his criminal laws are many wiſe and excellent regulations ; but the code is neceſſarily defective with reſpect to thoſe principles which muſt be derived ſrom the knowledge of the true God, and of pure morality, as the certain foundations of national happineſs. Two of them in particular were very exceptionable ; the permiſſion of a voluntary exile to perſons that had been guilty of premeditated murder, and the appointment of a less ſevere puniſhment for a rape than ſor ſeduction. Thoſe who wish to see accurately ſtated the comparative excellence of the laws of Moſes, of Lycurgus, and Solon, may consult Prize Diſſertations relative to Natural and Revealed Religion by Teyler’s Theological Society, Vol. IX.</p><p>The interview which Solon is ſaid to have had with<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0609.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s04-0603"/>
Crœsus king of Lydia, the ſolid remarks of the ſage after ſurveying the monarch’s wealth, the recollection of thoſe remarks by Croeſus when doomed to die, and the noble conduct of Cyrus on that occaſion, are known to every ſchoolboy. Solon died in the iſland of Cyprus, about the 80th year of his age. Statues were erected to his memory both at Athens and Salamis. His thirſt after knowledge continued to the laſt : “ I grow old (ſaid he) learning many things.” Among the apothegms and precepts which have been aſcribed to Solon, are the following : Laws are like cobwebs, that entangle the weak, but are broken through by the ſtrong. He who has learned to obey, will know how to command. In all things let reaſon be your guide. Diligently contemplate excellent things. In every thing that you do, conſider the end.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
