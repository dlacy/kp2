He made companions of his tame goats and cats, often dancing and singing with them. Though he conſtantly performed his devotions at ſtated hours, and read aloud ; yet, when be was taken off the iſland, his language, from diſuſe of converſation, was become ſcarcely intelligible. In this ſolitude he continued four years and four months ; during which time only two incidents happened which he thought worth relating, the occurrences of every day being in his circumſtances nearly ſimilar. The one was, that, purſuing a goat eagerly, he caught it juſt on the edge of a precipice, which was covered with buſhes, ſo that he did not perceive it, and he fell over to the bottom, where he lay (according to captain Roger’s account) 24 hours ſenſeleſs; but, as he related to Sir R. Steele, he computed, by the alteration of the moon, that he had lain three days. When he came to himself, he found the goat lying under him dead. It was with great difficulty that he could crawl to his habitation, whence he was unable to ſtir for ten days, and did not recover of his bruiſes for a long time. The other event was the arrival of a ſhip, which he at firſt ſuppoſed to be French : and ſuch is the natural love of ſociety in the human mind, that he was eager to abandon his ſolitary felicity, and ſurrender himſelf to them, although enemies ; but upon their landing, approaching them, he found them to be Spaniards, of whom he had too great a dread to truſt himſelf in their hands. They were by this time ſo near that it required all his agility to eſcape, which he effected by climbing into a thick tree, being ſhot at ſeveral times as he ran off. Fortunately the Spaniards did not diſcover him, though they ſtayed ſome time under the tree where he was hid, and killed ſome goats juſt by. In this ſolitude Selkirk remained until the 2d of February 1709, when he ſaw two ſhipe come into the bay, and knew them to be Engliſh. He immediately lighted a fire as a ſignal ; and on their coming on ſhore, found they were the Duke captain Rogers, and the Ducheſs captain Courtney, two privateers from Briſtol. He gave them the beſt entertainment he could afford ; and, as they had been a long time at ſea without freſh proviſions, the goats which he caught were highly acceptable. His habitation conſiſting of two huts, one to ſleep in, the other to dreſs his food in, was ſo obſcurely ſituated, and ſo difficult of acceſs, that only one of the ſhip’s officers would accompany him to it. Dampier, who was pilot on board the Huke, and knew Selkirk very well, told captain Rogers, that, when on board the Cinque-Ports, he was the beſt ſeaman on board that veſſel ; upon  which captain Rogers appointed him maſter’s mate of the Huke. After a fortnight’s ſtay at Juan Fernandes, the ſhips proceeded on their cruize againſt the Spaniards ; plundered a town on the coaſt of Peru ; took a Manilla ſhip off California ; and returned by way of the Eaſt Indies to England, where they arrived the 1ſt of October 1711 ; Selkirk having been abſent eight years, more than half of which time he had ſpent alone in the iſland. The public curioſity being excited respecting him, he was induced to put his papers into the hands of Defoe, to arrange and form them into a regular narrative. Theſe papers muſt have been drawn up after he left Juan Fernandes, as he had no means of recording his tranſactions there. Captain Cooke remarks, as an extraordinary circumſtance, that he had</p><p>contrived to keep an account of the days of the week and month : but this might be done, as Defoe makes Robinſon Cruſoe do, by cutting notches in a poſt, or many other methods. From this account of Selkirk, Defoe took the idea of writing a more extenſive work, the romance of Robinſon Cruſoe, and very diſhoneſtly defrauded the original proprietor of his ſhare of the profits. Of the time or place or manner of this extraordinary man’s death we have received no account ; but in 1792 the cheſt and muſket which Selkirk had with him on the iſland were in the poſſeſſion of his grandnephew, John Selkirk weaver in Largo, where doubtless they are at preſent.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Selkirk,</hi> the capital of the county of the same name, is a ſmall town pleaſantly situated on a riſing ground, and enjoys an extenſive proſpect in all directions, eſpecially up and down the river Etterick. It is remarkable for nothing but thoſe plaintive airs produced in its neighbourhood, the natural ſimplicity of which are the pride of Scotland and the admiration of ſtrangers. W. Long. 2. 46. N. Lat. 55. 26.</p><p>SELKIRKSHIRE, called alſo the Sheriffdom<hi rend="italic"> of Etterick Fοrest,</hi> a county of Scotland, extending about 20 miles in length from eaſt to weſt, and about 12 in breadth from ſouth to north. It borders on the north with part of Tweeddale and Mid-Lothian ; on the ſouth and eaſt with Teviotdale ; and on the weſt with Annandale. This county was formerly reſerved by the Scottiſh princes for the pleaſure of the chace, and where they had houſes for the reception of their train. At that time the face of the country was covered with woods, in which there were great numbers of red and fallow deer, whence it had the name of <hi rend="italic">Etterick Forest. </hi>The woods, however, are now almoſt entirely cut down, and the county is chiefly ſupported by the breed of ſheep. They are generally sold into the ſouth, but ſometimes into the Highlands, about the month of March, where they are kept during ſummer ; and after being improved by the mountain-grass, are returned into the Lowlands in the beginning of winter.</p><p>This county, though not very populous at preſent, was once the nurſe of heroes, who were juſtly accounted the bulwark of their native foil, being ever ready to brave danger and death in its defence. Of this we have a memorable proof in the pathetic lamentations of their wives and daughters for the diſaſter of the field of Flowden, “ where their brave foreſters were a’ wed away.”@@ The rivers Etterick and Yarrow unite a little above the town of Selkirk, and terminate in the Tweed. For five miles above its junction with the Etterick, the Tweed is ſtill adorned with w∞ds, and leads the pleaſed imagination to contemplate what this country muſt have been in former times. The Yarrow, for about five miles above its junction with Etterick, exhibits nature in a bold and ſtriking aſpect. Its native woods ſtill remain, through which the ſtream has cut its turbid courle, deeply ingulphed amidſt rugged rocks. Here, certainly in a flood, flood the deſcriptive Thomſon when he ſaw it</p><p>“ Work and boil, and foam and thunder through.”</p><p>Upon a peninſula, cut out by the surrounding ſtream, in the middle of this fantaſtically wild ſcene <hi rend="italic">of</hi> grandeur and beauty, ſtands the caſtle of Newark, which has been ſuppoſed by many to be the birth-place of Mary Scot the flower of Yarrow; but this we believe to be a miſtake.</p><p>@@@[mu] Statistical Account of Scotland, vol. 2.</p></body></text></TEI>
