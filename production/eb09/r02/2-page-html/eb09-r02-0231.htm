<p><span class="font1">and children ; and, as private holdings increased in extent, it was not unusual for the patron or his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gens</span><span class="font1"> to give him&nbsp;during pleasure a plot of land to cultivate for himself.&nbsp;The patron had, moreover, to assist him in his transactions&nbsp;with third parties, obtain redress for him for his injuries,&nbsp;and represent him before the tribunals when he became&nbsp;involved in litigation. The client, on the other hand, had&nbsp;to maintain his patron’s interests by every means in his&nbsp;power. But the advantage must have been chiefly on&nbsp;the side of the client, who, without becoming a citizen,&nbsp;obtained directly the protection of his patron and his&nbsp;clan, and indirectly that of the state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The plebeians, as distinguished from the clients, must be regarded as a heterogeneous mass of non-gentile freemen,&nbsp;small probably in numbers at first, but augmenting with&nbsp;ever greater rapidity, who had of choice or compulsion&nbsp;made Rome their domicile, but declined to subject themselves to a patron. That there was any general cohesion&nbsp;amongst them before the time of Servius there is not the&nbsp;slightest reason to believe. They were of different races,&nbsp;settling in Rome from different motives, practising in many&nbsp;matters different customs. The bulk of them, however,&nbsp;λvere undoubtedly Latins, with traditions and customs&nbsp;much the same as those of the greater number of the&nbsp;patrician houses ; and this it was that in time caused the&nbsp;triumph of Latinism and the predominance of the masterful spirit in thejws </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Quintium.</span><span class="font1"> But by the ruling caste&nbsp;those traditions and customs were simply ignored; till&nbsp;the time of Servius what protection the plebeians got was&nbsp;simply of the grace of the kings, whose policy it was to&nbsp;conciliate them as a body that in time might be a valuable&nbsp;auxiliary against the pretensions of the patricians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Regulatives of Public and Private Order.—</span><span class="font1">We look in vain for, and it would be absurd to expect, any definite&nbsp;system of law in those early times. What passed for it&nbsp;was a composite of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">fas, jus,</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">boni mores,</span><span class="font1"> whose several&nbsp;limits and characteristics it is extremely difficult to define.&nbsp;This may to some extent be accounted for by the fact that&nbsp;much of what was originally within the domain of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">fas,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">once it had come to be enforced by secular tribunals, and&nbsp;thus had the sanction of human authority, was no longer&nbsp;distinguishable from </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus</span><span class="font1"> ; while it may be that others of&nbsp;its behests, once pontifical punishments for their contravention had gone into desuetude, sank to nothing higher than&nbsp;precepts of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">boni mores.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">By </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">fas</span><span class="font1"> was understood the will of the gods, the laws given by heaven for men on earth, much of it regulative&nbsp;of ceremonial, but a by no means insignificant part embodying rules of conduct. It appears to have had a wider&nbsp;range than </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus.</span><span class="font1"> There were few of its commands, prohibitions, or precepts that were addressed to men as citizens&nbsp;of any particular state ; all mankind came within its scope.&nbsp;It forbade that a war should be undertaken without the&nbsp;prescribed fetial ceremonial, and required that faith should&nbsp;be kept even with an enemy when a promise had been&nbsp;made to him under sanction of an oath. It enjoined&nbsp;hospitality to foreigners, because the stranger guest was&nbsp;presumed, equally with his entertainer, to be an object of&nbsp;solicitude to a higher power. It punished murder, for it&nbsp;was the taking of a god-given life ; the sale of a wife by&nbsp;her husband, for she had become his partner in all things&nbsp;human and divine; the lifting of a hand against a parent,&nbsp;for it was subversive of the first bond of society and religion,—the reverence due by a child to those to whom he&nbsp;owed his existence ; incestuous connexions, for they defiled&nbsp;the altar ; the false oath and the broken vow, for they were&nbsp;an insult to the divinities invoked ; the displacement of a&nbsp;boundary or a landmark, not so much because the act was&nbsp;provocative of feud, as because the march-stone itself, as&nbsp;the guarantee of peaceful neighbourhood, was under the&nbsp;guardianship of the gods. When an offence against any&nbsp;of these rules or prohibitions was inexpiable, the punishment was usually what is called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sacratio capitis,</span><span class="font1"> excommunication and outlawry of the offender. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">homo sacer&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">was in every sense of the word an outcast,—one with&nbsp;whom it was pollution to associate, who dared take no&nbsp;part in any of the institutions of the state, civil or religious, whose life the gods would not accept as a sacrifice,&nbsp;but whom, nevertheless, any one might put to death with&nbsp;impunity as no longer god-protected. The precepts of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">fas</span><span class="font1"> therefore were not mere exhortations to a blameless&nbsp;life, but closely approached to laws, whose violation was&nbsp;visited with punishments none the less effective that they&nbsp;were religious rather than civil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Recent philology derives the word </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus</span><span class="font1"> from the Sanscrit </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ju,</span><span class="font1"> to “join, bind, or unite,” from which some deduce as its&nbsp;signification “that which binds,” “the bond of society,”&nbsp;others “that which is regular, orderly, or fitting.” The&nbsp;latest inquirer (M. Bréal) identifies it with the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jos, jaos,</span><span class="font1"> or&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jaus</span><span class="font1"> of the Vedas, and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jaes</span><span class="font1"> of the Zend-Avesta,—words&nbsp;whose exact meaning is controverted, but which he interprets as “ the divine will.” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Jubeo</span><span class="font1"> is generally allowed to be&nbsp;a contraction of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus hibeo,</span><span class="font1"> “ hold or take as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus</span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">.” If Bréal’s&nbsp;definition can be adopted we obtain a very significant interpretation of the words addressed by the presiding magistrate&nbsp;to the assembled comitia in asking them whether they&nbsp;assented to a law proposed by him,— </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Velitis, jubeatis,&nbsp;Quintes,</span><span class="font1"> &amp;c., “Is it your pleasure, Quirites, and do you&nbsp;hold it as the divine will, that,” and so on. As legislation&nbsp;by the comitia of the curies and centuries was regarded as&nbsp;a divine office, and their vote might be nullified by the&nbsp;fathers on the ground that there had been a defect in the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">auspicia,</span><span class="font1"> and the will of the gods consequently not clearly&nbsp;ascertained, this explanation of Bréal’s seems not without&nbsp;support,—</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">vox populi vox dei.</span><span class="font1"> If it be right, then the only&nbsp;difference between </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">fas</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus</span><span class="font1"> was that the will of the&nbsp;gods, which both embodied, was in the one declared by&nbsp;inspired and in the other by merely human agency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus</span><span class="font1"> might be the result either of traditional and inveterate custom </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(jus monbus constitutum)</span><span class="font1"> or of statute&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(lex).</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>1</sup></span><span class="font1"> We look in vain for any legislative enactment&nbsp;establishing such an institution, for example, as the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">patna&nbsp;potestas,</span><span class="font1"> or fixing the rules of succession on death.&nbsp;Statute may have regulated some of their details; but&nbsp;they had taken shape and consistency before Rome had its&nbsp;beginning. It can well be believed, however, that in the&nbsp;outset the customs in observance may have been far from&nbsp;uniform, that not only those of the different races but&nbsp;those also of the different </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gentes</span><span class="font1"> may at first have varied&nbsp;in some respects, but undergoing a gradual approximation,&nbsp;and in course of time consolidating into a general </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus&nbsp;Quintium.</span><span class="font1"> That the bulk of the law was customary is&nbsp;universally admitted. But Pomponius speaks of certain&nbsp;laws enacted by the comitia of the curies, which he calls&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">leges regiαe</span><span class="font1"> and which, he says, were collected by one Sext.&nbsp;Papirius in the reign of one of the Tarquins, under the&nbsp;name of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Jus Papirianum.</span><span class="font1"> The opinion of the best authorities is that it is a mistake to attribute these so-called&nbsp;“ royal laws ” to that assembly. According to the testimony of the old writers it had very little share in the work</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">@@@<sup>1</sup> There is controversy about the etymology of the word </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">lex.</span><span class="font0"> It was used by the jurists in two distinct senses—(1) as meaning a comitial enactment (Gai., i. 3), and hence was occasionally called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">lex publica&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(Gai., ii. 104, iii. 174) ; (2) as meaning an obligation, restriction, condition, declaration, or what not, expressly incorporated in a private&nbsp;deed </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(lex private),</span><span class="font0"> as in the phrases </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">lex mancipii, lex contractus, lex&nbsp;testementi,</span><span class="font0"> &amp;c.
