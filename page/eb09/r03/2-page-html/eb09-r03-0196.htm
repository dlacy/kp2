<p><span class="font0">guinary siege ; he proposed making it one of his Continental residences, but it was never completed. It was in Philip Augustus’s castle that Joan of Arc was imprisoned and tried, and one of the&nbsp;public squares was the place where she was burned alive in 1431.&nbsp;From that year began a series of attempts on the part of the French&nbsp;to recapture the town. Rieardville in 1432 and Xaintrailles in 143G&nbsp;failed in spite of the secret Connivanceof the inhabitants. In 1449&nbsp;a stronger and better-planned expedition was successful, and Somerset, the English commander, was obliged, in order to secure an&nbsp;honourable capitulation, to surrender the principal fortified places&nbsp;in Normandy. The English rule, though badly supported by the&nbsp;citizens, had not been without its influence on the prosperity of&nbsp;Rouen. It was then that the present church of St Ouen was continued and almost completed ; the foundation was laid in 1311,&nbsp;but the choir alone had been constructed in the 14th century. In&nbsp;spite of the juxtaposition of the second and third or “radiant” and&nbsp;“flamboyant” styles of Gothic, the building taken altogether presents in its general lines the most perfect unity—a unity which even&nbsp;the modern addition of a façade with two bell towers has failed to&nbsp;mar, though no regard was had to the original plans. St Ouen is&nbsp;the largest church erected in France during the War of the Hundred&nbsp;Years ; in length (450 feet) it exceeds the cathedral. The central&nbsp;tower, not unlike the Butter Tower, with which it is contemporary,&nbsp;is 265 feet high ; the two new towers with their spires are somewhat lower. Apart from its enormous dimensions and the richness&nbsp;of its southern portal, St Ouen has nothing that need long detain the visitor ; its style is cold and formal ; the interior, bare&nbsp;and stripped of its ancient stained glass, was further despoiled in&nbsp;1562 and in 1791 of its artistic treasures and of almost all its old&nbsp;church-furniture. The organ dates from 1630, and the rather&nbsp;handsome roodscreen from the 18th century. The close of the 15th&nbsp;century and the first half of the 16th—the reigns of Charles&nbsp;VIII., Louis XII., Francis I.; and Henry IL, and the episcopates&nbsp;of Cardinal Estoutteville (1453-1483), Cardinal Georges d’Amboise&nbsp;(1494-1510), and his nephew of the same name (1511-50)—rendered&nbsp;Rouen for nearly a hundred years the metropolis of art and taste&nbsp;in France ; and it was one of the first towns where the splendours&nbsp;of the Renaissance burst forth. At this time the church of St&nbsp;Maclou was erected, a building that can hardly be brought into&nbsp;comparison with the cathedral and St Ouen, but is justly celebrated for the value and variety of its artistic treasures, such as&nbsp;the carved work of the principal doors, partly executed by Jean&nbsp;Goujon, the beautiful stained glass, and an organ-loft reached by&nbsp;an open-work staircase. The spire, 285 feet high, is a structure&nbsp;of the present century. Beside the church is the old parish&nbsp;cemetery, called the Aitre of Saint Maclou, surrounded by charming&nbsp;Renaissance galleries and famous for its </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">danse macabre</span><span class="font0"> formed by a&nbsp;series of sculptured groups. Other churches of the same period—St&nbsp;Godard, St Patrice, St Vincent—are no less interesting from the profusion of their architectural details than from their magnificent 16th-century stained-glass windows. There are two glass windows in St&nbsp;Godard, and a regular collection in St Patrice ; but the latter, though&nbsp;the most famous, are in the eyes of connoisseurs of less worth than&nbsp;the stained glass in St Vincent, due to two incomparable artists of&nbsp;Beauvais, Engrand and Jean Le Prince,—the two principal subjects&nbsp;treated by them being the Gifts of Mercy and the Glorification of&nbsp;the Virgin. St Godard contains, besides, old frescos worthy of&nbsp;note. The church of St Laurent, no longer used for worship, and&nbsp;the tower of St André are both of 16th-century origin. At the same&nbsp;period the cathedral received great embellishments, the central flèche&nbsp;was erected, and the portals were decorated with new sculptures.&nbsp;Georges d’Amboise, the virtuous minister of Louis XII., chose the&nbsp;chapel of the Virgin for his place of burial ; he caused his mausoleum,&nbsp;constructed after the plans of the architect Roland Ie Roux, to be&nbsp;composed entirely of marble, as well as his statue, which he ordered&nbsp;from Jean Goujon. Georges d’Amboise the second was, according&nbsp;to his desire, interred in his uncle’s tomb, but his statue is of much&nbsp;less value. Near this tomb are two others erected for the lords of&nbsp;Brézé ; both are very remarkable ; the oldest belongs to tho Gothic&nbsp;style ; the other, the tomb of Diana of Poitiers’s husband, is a&nbsp;Renaissance structure of the time of Henry IL, but, contrary to&nbsp;what was long believed, contains nothing from the hand of Jean&nbsp;Goujon. Under Louis XIL the archbishops of Rouen also rebuilt&nbsp;their palace at the side of the cathedral ; but in spite of the richness of its architecture this lordly mansion cannot compete with&nbsp;the “palace of justice” begun in the same year, 1499, when the&nbsp;exchequer of Normandy, which had been established at Rouen in&nbsp;1302, was erected into a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">parlement,</span><span class="font0"> though the title was not adopted&nbsp;till 1515. This sumptuous building is in the Gothic style; but&nbsp;the Hôtel de Bourgtheroulde, which dates from the time of Francis&nbsp;I., is Undisguisedly of the Renaissance, and is justly celebrated&nbsp;for its bas-reliefs, the subjects of which are borrowed from two&nbsp;quite different orders of things—the allegories from Petrarch’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Triumphs,</span><span class="font0"> and the interview of the Field of the Cloth of Gold&nbsp;between Henry VIII. and Francis I. Many other secular Renaissance buildings in Rouen bear witness to the great commercial&nbsp;prosperity of its citizens and to their keen appreciation of the&nbsp;arts : —numerous private houses in stone and especially in wood ;&nbsp;the gate of the great clock ; and a unique structure, the “ fierte ”&nbsp;of St Romain, a sort of pulpit from which every year a person&nbsp;condemned to death raised before the people the shrine or fierte&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Jeretrnm)</span><span class="font0"> of St Romain, and then received pardon and liberty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This splendour of the arts began to decline during the wars of religion ; in 1562 the town was sacked by the Protestants, which&nbsp;did not prevent the League from obtaining so firm a footing there&nbsp;that Henry IV., after having vainly besieged it, did not obtain&nbsp;entrance till long after his abjuration. To the 18th century belong&nbsp;the exchange and the claustral buildings of the abbey of St 0uen,&nbsp;transformed into an hôtel de ville. Much more important works&nbsp;have been executed in recent times, but in great part at the expense&nbsp;of the historic and picturesque features of the town. On the other&nbsp;hand, handsome structures of various kinds have been erected in&nbsp;the interests of public utility or embellishment—churches, civil&nbsp;and military establishments, fountains, statues, &amp;c. ; and many old&nbsp;buildings have been carefully restored or completed. Rouen, moreover, has recently been provided with museums of antiquities, of&nbsp;fine arts, of ceramic art, of natural history, and of industry,—the&nbsp;first two being very important. During the Franco-German War&nbsp;the city was occupied by the invaders from 5th December 1870 to&nbsp;22d July 1871, and had to submit to heavy requisitions. Among&nbsp;the famous men born at Rouen are the brothers Corneille, Fontenelle, the journalists Arrnand Carrel and De Villemessant, the&nbsp;composer Boieldieu, the painters Jouvenet, Restout, and Géricault,&nbsp;the architect Blondel, Dulong the physicist, and La Salle the&nbsp;American explorer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A.

<p><span class="font1">ROUGE. This name is applied to various colouring substances of a brilliant carmine tint, especially when used&nbsp;as cosmetics. The least harmful of these preparations are&nbsp;such as have for their basis carthamine, obtained from the&nbsp;safflower </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Garthamus tiηctorius).</span><span class="font1"> The Chinese prepare a&nbsp;rouge, said to be from safflower, which, spread on the cards&nbsp;on which it is sold, has a brilliant metallic green lustre, but&nbsp;when moistened and applied to the skin assumes a delicate&nbsp;carmine tint. Jeweller’s rouge for polishing gold and silver&nbsp;plate is a fine red oxide of iron prepared by calcination&nbsp;from sulphate of iron (green vitriol).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROUGET DE LISLE, </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Claude Joseph</span><span class="font1"> (1760-1836), one of the most noteworthy of those authors whom a&nbsp;single short piece of work has made famous, was born on&nbsp;IOth May 1760, at Lons-le-Saunier. He entered the&nbsp;army as an engineer and attained the rank of captain.&nbsp;He wrote complimentary verses pretty early, and appears&nbsp;to have been a good musician. The song which has immortalized him, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Marseillaise,</span><span class="font1"> was composed at Strasburg,&nbsp;where Rouget de Lisle was quartered in April 1792, and&nbsp;he is said to have composed both the words and the music&nbsp;in a fit of patriotic excitement after a public dinner. The&nbsp;piece was at first called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ghant de Varmee du Rhin,</span><span class="font1"> and only&nbsp;received its name of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Marseillaise</span><span class="font1"> from its adoption by the&nbsp;Provençal volunteers whom Barbaroux introduced into&nbsp;Paris, and who were prominent, in the storming of the&nbsp;Tuileries. The author himself was unfavourably affected&nbsp;by that very event. He was a moderate republican, and&nbsp;was cashiered and thrown into prison; but the counterrevolution set him at liberty. Little is recorded of his&nbsp;later years, and he received no pension or other mark of&nbsp;favour till the accession of Louis Philippe. He died at&nbsp;Choisy on the 26th June 1836.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Marseillaise</span><span class="font0"> (of which as usually given six-sevenths only are Rouget’s) is so well known that no elaborate criticism of it is&nbsp;necessary. The extraordinarily stirring character of the air and&nbsp;its ingenious adaptation to the words serve to disguise the alternate&nbsp;poverty and bombast of the words themselves. As poetry the&nbsp;sixth stanza alone has much merit. Rouget de Lisle λvrote a few&nbsp;other songs of the same kind, and set a good many of others’ writing&nbsp;to music. He also produced a play or two and some translations.&nbsp;But his chief literary monument is a slender and rather rare little&nbsp;volume entitled </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Essais en Vers et en Prose</span><span class="font0"> (Paris, 1796). This&nbsp;contains the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Marseillaise,</span><span class="font0"> a prose tale of the sentimental kind&nbsp;called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Adelaide et Monville,</span><span class="font0"> and a collection of occasional poems&nbsp;of various styles and dates, from which the author’s poetic faculty&nbsp;can be fairly judged. It is humble enough. Rouget was a mere&nbsp;follower of standard models, imitating by turns J. B. Rousseau,&nbsp;La Fontaine, and Voltaire, and exaggerating the artificial language&nbsp;of his time. In </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Tœm et Lucy,</span><span class="font0"> which turns on a romantic story of</span></p>
