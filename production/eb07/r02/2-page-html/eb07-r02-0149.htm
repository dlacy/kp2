<p><span class="font0">sioned by his invectives against the dissolute and infamous Clodius, and the unprincipled and tyrannical Antony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Soon after the formation of this blood-cemented compact, Octavius and Antony prepared to wage war against Brutus&nbsp;and Cassius, who had combined their forces, and were in&nbsp;Macedonia. The rival armies met near Philippi ; and two&nbsp;separate battles were fought before the victory was decided.&nbsp;In the first, the division commanded by Cassius was defeated ; and he, thinking the battle lost, slew himself in despair.&nbsp;Brutus, however, had been victorious with his division ; and&nbsp;the two antagonist armies, rallying each on its unbroken&nbsp;half, remained ready for another trial of strength. This took&nbsp;place within about twenty days after the first, and on nearly&nbsp;the same ground. The struggle was fierce, obstinate, and&nbsp;bloody ; but at length the troops of Brutus gave way, fled,&nbsp;and were scattered in total rout and dismay. Brutus, disdaining to survive this, the last convulsive effort of the republic, fell on his own sword, and died. The conduct of&nbsp;Octavius and Antony, after their victory, bore a greater&nbsp;resemblance to that of Sylla and Marius, than of Cæsar,&nbsp;whose memory they would have more honoured by imitating&nbsp;his clemency, than by a bloody revenge of his death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The utter ruin of the republican party was followed by a period of disgraceful intrigues, jarrings, and contests, amoyg&nbsp;the usurpers, and their corrupt friends and followers. Antony traversed Greece, and part of Asia, luxuriating in the&nbsp;pomp, the homage, the flatteries, and the voluptuousness of&nbsp;the East. At one time he meditated a war against the Parthians, to redeem the fame of Rome, which had been tarnished by the defeat of Crassus ; but meeting with Cleopatra, he abandoned his dreams of glory, and resigned himself&nbsp;to the debasing delights of loose licentiousness, beneath the&nbsp;syren spell of tllis abandoned beauty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Octavius, on the other hand, returned to Italy, and prosecuted his deep-laid schemes for securing the sole possession of despotic power. He was repeatedly disturbed by the intrigues and the violence of Lucius, the brother, and Fulvia, the wife, of Antony ; but at last, the rupture having come&nbsp;to an open war, they were defeated ; their chief strength,&nbsp;Perusia, was taken, and Octavius secured in the undisturbed&nbsp;command of Italy. The tidings of this contest drew Antony&nbsp;from Egypt, and a war between him and Octavius seemed&nbsp;on the point of breaking out. At this juncture Fulvia died ;&nbsp;and instead of a war, a new alliance was formed between the&nbsp;jealous triumvirs, Antony receiving in marriage Octavia,&nbsp;the sister of Octavius. In this new division of the Roman&nbsp;dominions, Sextus Pompey was admitted to a participation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But their hollow agreement was of no long duration. New jealousies arose between Octavius and Lepidus, and new&nbsp;wars with Pompey. Being defeated by Octavius, Sextus&nbsp;Pompey fled to Asia, and was there slain by one of Antony’s&nbsp;lieutenants. Lepidus was soon afterwards deprived of his&nbsp;share in the triumvirate ; and Antony and Octavius divided&nbsp;the whole power between them. Little cordiality subsisted&nbsp;between these partners, or rather rivals ; but a decided quarrel was delayed in consequence of their distance from each&nbsp;other, and the different regions in which they sought for an&nbsp;extension of fame and dominion. Antony was still desirous&nbsp;of triumphing over the Parthians, but he met with little&nbsp;success, except where his troops were led by Ventidius.&nbsp;Octavius 'found employment for his legions in Dalmatia and&nbsp;Pannonia, into which the arms of Rome had scarcely before&nbsp;penetrated. At length the conduct of Antony thoroughly&nbsp;disgusted all his friends at Rome. Octavia set out for the&nbsp;East, hoping to recall her husband to some sense of his duty&nbsp;to Rome, to her, and to himself; but the infatuated man,&nbsp;unable to break through the fascinations of Cleopatra, refused to see Octavia, ordered her to return home, and even&nbsp;sent her a divorce. This insult Octavius could not brook.&nbsp;Antony was deprived of his consulship by a decree of tlle&nbsp;senate, and both parties prepared for another war.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">Mutual jealousy had long anticipated such a contest, and they were both in readiness at once to rush to the arbitration of arms. The forces of Antony were the more numerous ; those of Octavius the better disciplined, and led&nbsp;by generals of great skill and judgment. Their armaments,&nbsp;both military and naval, came within sight of each other on&nbsp;the opposite sides of the entrance to the gulf of Ambrasia&nbsp;in Epirus. For some time they remained comparatively&nbsp;inactive, watching each other’s movements. At length the&nbsp;two hostile fleets met off the promontory of Actium, that of&nbsp;Octavius led by Agriopa, that of Antony by himself and&nbsp;Cleopatra. The battle began, in sight of the land forces on&nbsp;either side, and was continued with equal courage and fortune, till Cleopatra, terrified by the dreadful scene, turned&nbsp;her galley and fled, followed by sixty of the Egyptian vessels, and soon after by Antony himself. The deserted fleet&nbsp;of Antony maintained a brave resistance for some hours after&nbsp;his flight ; but at length was completely overpowered and&nbsp;destroyed, three hundred ships being sunk or taken, and the&nbsp;whole strand covered with wrecks, and the bodies of the&nbsp;dead. For several days the army of Antony could not believe that he had deserted them ; and remained in anxious&nbsp;expectation of his arrival, to renovate his fortunes on a more&nbsp;stable element. When at last assured of his flight, they&nbsp;entered into terms witll the victor, who was now undisputed&nbsp;lord of both sea and land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">After this fatal battle, Antony continued his flight to Egypt, a prey at once to shame and to ungovernable τage.&nbsp;For some time he refused to see Cleopatra, whom he accused&nbsp;of having caused his overthrow. But having exhausted his&nbsp;wrath, he returned to the embrace of the ensnaring syren,&nbsp;and again gave himself up to the excesses of voluptuous enjoyment. Meanwhile, the cautious Octavius was drawing&nbsp;his toils closer around his victim. The defences of Egypt&nbsp;were taken or surrendered ; and in a short time Antony was&nbsp;reduced to such straits, that he could neither fight nor fly.&nbsp;Hemmed in, deserted by bis own troops, suspicious of the&nbsp;Egyptians, distracted by jealousy and rage, he lost all self-control, bursting into tierce gusts of frantic passion, then&nbsp;sinking into the stupor of despair. Even Cleopatra became&nbsp;alarmed with these storms of the furious madman, and caused&nbsp;a report to be spread that she was dead. This report roused&nbsp;the Roman in the heart of Antony ; and having nothing now&nbsp;on earth to love, and the path of ambition being closed, he&nbsp;threw himself on his own sword, but failed to inflict a wound&nbsp;immediately mortal. While struggling in the agonies of&nbsp;death, he was told that Cleopatra was still alive. Somewhat&nbsp;reviving at this intelligence, he caused himselfto be carried&nbsp;into the presence of Cleopatra, where, calling for a draught&nbsp;of wine, and fixing his eyes on the fascinating woman, for&nbsp;whose sake he had lost the world, he expired.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Octavius was now left without a rival, sole master of the Roman world. On seeing the body of Antony he betrayed some emotion ; but gave orders that the utmost attention&nbsp;should be paid to Cleopatra, and especially that she should&nbsp;be prevented from dying by her own hand, as he was anxious that she should adorn his triumphat Rome. She seems to&nbsp;have cherished the hope of gaining the same influence over&nbsp;him that she had enjoyed over Cæsar and Antony ; but the&nbsp;cold and passionless temper of Octavius was proof against&nbsp;her blandishments. Disappointed in this expectation, and&nbsp;dreading the disgrace of being led in captivity to adorn the&nbsp;triumph </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font0"> her conqueror, she eluded the vigilance of her&nbsp;Roman guards, and having imbibed poison, either from the&nbsp;bite of an asp, or from the point of an envenomed needle,&nbsp;death rescued her from that indignity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Egypt was then reduced to the form of a Roman province ; and its immense wealth was transported to Rome to replenish the exhausted treasury, and to pay the troops&nbsp;by whom the conquest was thus achieved. Soon after his&nbsp;return to Rome, Octavius received from the senate the ap-</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
