                <p><label>ROBERT OF COURTENAY</label> (d. 1228), emperor of Romania, or
                    Constantinople, was a younger son of the emperor Peter of Courtenay, and was
                    descended from the French king, Louis VI., while his mother Yolande was a sister
                    of Baldwin and Henry of Flanders, the first and second emperors of
                    Constantinople. When it became known in France that Peter of Courtenay was dead,
                    his eldest son, Philip, marquess of Namur, renounced the succession to the Latin
                    empire of Constantinople in favour of his brother Robert, who set out to take
                    possession of his distracted inheritance, which was then ruled by Conon of
                    Bethune as regent. Crowned emperor on the 25th of March 1221, Robert, who was
                    surrounded by enemies, appealed Ior help to the pope and to the king of France;
                    but meanwhile his lands were falling into the hands of the Greeks. Some little
                    aid was sent from western Europe, but soon Robert was compelled to make peace
                    with his chief foe, John Ducas Vataces, emperor of Nicaea, who was confirmed in
                    all his conquests. Robert promised to marry Eudoxia, daughter of the late
                    emperor of Nicaea, Theodore Lascaris I., a lady to whom he had been betrothed on
                    a former occasion; however, he soon repudiated this engagement, and married a
                    French lady, already the fiancee of a Burgundian gentleman. Heading a
                    conspiracy, the Burgundian drove Robert from Constantinople, and early in 1228
                    the emperor died in Achaia.</p>
