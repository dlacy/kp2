                <p><label>RABELAIS</label> (Francis), a French writer famous ſor his facetiouſneſs,
                    was born at Chinonin Touraine about the year 1483. . He was ſirſt a Francifcan⅛
                    friar ; but quitting his religious hablt ſtudied phyſic at Montpelier, where he
                    took his doctor’s degree. It is ſaid, that the chancellor du Pratt ha ing
                    aboliſhed the privileges of the faculty of phyſic atv Montpelier by a decree of
                    the parliament, Rabelais h ad the addreſs to make him revoke what he had don e ;
                    and that thofe who were madc doctors of that univerſity wore Rabelais’s robe,
                    which is there held in great veneration. Some time after, he came to Rome, in
                    quality of phyſician in ordinary to Cardinal John du Bellay archbiſhop of Paris.
                    Rabelais is ſaid to have uſed the freedom to jeer Pope Paul III. to his face. He
                    had quitted his religious connections for the ſake of leading a life more
                    agreeable to his taſte ; but renewed them on a ſecond journey to Rome, when he
                    obtained, in 1536, a brief to qualify him for holding eccleſiaſtical benefices ;
                    and, by the intereſt of his friend Cardinal John du Bellay, he was received as a
                    ſecular canon in the abbey of St Maur near Paris. His profound knowledge in
                    phyſic rendered him doubly uſeful ; he being as ready, and at leaſt as well
                    qualified, to prefcribe for the body as for the foul : but as he was a man of
                    wit and humour, many ridiculous things are laid to his charge, of which he was
                    quite innocent. He publiſhed ſeveral things ; but his chief performance is a
                    ſtrange incoherent romance, called the <hi rend="italic">IIfiory oſ Gargantua
                        and Pantagruel,</hi> being a ſatire upon prieſts, popes, fools, and knaves
                    of all kinds. This work contains a wild, irregular profuſion of wit, learning,
                    obſcenſty, low conceits, and arrant nonſenſe ; hence the ſhrewd-neſs of his
                    ſatire, in ſome places where he is to be underſtood, gains him credit ſor thoſe
                    where no meaning is diſcoverable. Some alluſions may undoubtedly have been ſo
                    temporary and local as to be now quite loſt : but it is too much to conclude
                    thus in favour of every unintelligible rhapſody ; for we are not without Engliſh
                    writers of great talents, whoſe ſportive geniufes have betrayed them into
                    puerilities, no leſs incoherent at</p>

                <p>the times of writing than thoſe of Rabelais appear above two centuries after. He
                    died about 1553.</p>
