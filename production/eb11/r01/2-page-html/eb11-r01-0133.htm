<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Clematis (q.v.),</span><span class="font0"> characterized by its shrubby, often climbing habit, opposite leaves and the&nbsp;valνate, not imbricate as in the other tribes,&nbsp;aestivation of the sepals. The usually four&nbsp;sepals are whοrled and petaloid, the numerous&nbsp;stamens and carpels are spirally arranged; the&nbsp;flowers are visited by insects for the sake of the&nbsp;abundant pollen. The fruit consists of numerous achenes which are generally prolonged into the long feathery style,&nbsp;whence the popular name of the British species, old man's beard&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Clematis vitalba).</span><span class="font0"> The genus, which contains about 170 species,&nbsp;has a wide distribution, but is rarer in the tropics than in temperate</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">regions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Special articles will be found on the more important genera of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ranunculaceae, e.g. Aconitum, Adonis, Anemone, Baneberry (Actaea),&nbsp;Clematis, Columbine, Hellebore, Ranunculus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RANUNCULUS, familiarly known as “ buttercup,’’ or crowfoot, a characteristic type of the botanical order Ranunculaceae. The Lat. name, which means a little frog or tadpole (dim. of&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rana,</span><span class="font1"> frog), was also given to a medicinal plant, which has&nbsp;been identified by some with the crowfoot. The Ranunculi&nbsp;are more or less acrid herbs, sometimes with fleshy root-fibres,&nbsp;or with the base of the stem dilated into a kind of tuber (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">R.</span><span class="font1">&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bulbosus).</span><span class="font1"> They have tufted or alternate leaves, dilated into&nbsp;a sheath at the base, and very generally, but not universally,&nbsp;deeply divided above. The flowers are solitary, or in loose&nbsp;cymes, and are remarkable for the number and distinctness&nbsp;(freedom from union) of their parts. Thus there are five&nbsp;sepals, as many petals, and numerous spirally arranged stamens&nbsp;and carpels. The petals have a little pit or honey-gland at&nbsp;the base, which is interesting as foreshadowing the more fully&nbsp;developed tubular petals of the nearly allied genera </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Aconitum&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Helleborus.</span><span class="font1"> The fruit is a head of “ achenes ”—dry, one-seeded fruits. The genus contains a large number of species&nbsp;(about 250) and occurs in most temperate countries in the&nbsp;northern and southern hemispheres, extending into arctic&nbsp;and antarctic regions, and appearing on the higher mountains&nbsp;in the tropics. About twenty species are natives of Great&nbsp;Britain. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">R. acris, R. repens, R. bulbosus,</span><span class="font1"> are the common&nbsp;buttercups. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">R</span><span class="font1">. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">arυensis,</span><span class="font1"> found in cornfields, has smaller pale&nbsp;yellow flowers and the achenes covered with stout spines.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">R. Lingua,</span><span class="font1"> spearwort, and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">R. Flammula,</span><span class="font1"> lesser spearwort,&nbsp;grow in marshes, ditches and wet places. R</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">.</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ficaria</span><span class="font1"> is the&nbsp;pilewort or lesser celandine, an early spring flower in pastures&nbsp;and waste places, characterized by having heart-shaped entire&nbsp;leaves and clusters of club-shaped roots. The section&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Batrachium</span><span class="font1"> comprises the water-buttercups, denizens of pools&nbsp;and streams, which vary greatly in the character of the foliage&nbsp;according as it is submersed, floating or aerial, and when&nbsp;submersed varying in accordance with the depth and strength&nbsp;of the current. The ranunculus of the florist is a cultivated&nbsp;form of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">R</span><span class="font1">. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">asiaticus,</span><span class="font1"> a native of the Levant, remarkable for&nbsp;the range of colour of the flowers (yellow to purplish black)&nbsp;and for the regularity with which the stamens and pistils are&nbsp;replaced by petals forming double flowers. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">R. asiaticus</span><span class="font1"> is one&nbsp;of the older florists’ flowers, which has sported into numberless&nbsp;varieties, but was formerly held in much greater esteem than&nbsp;it is at the present time. According to the canons of the florists,&nbsp;the flowers, to be perfect, should be of the form of two-thirds&nbsp;of a ball, the outline forming a perfect circle, with the centre&nbsp;close, the petals smooth-edged, the colour dense, and the&nbsp;marking uniform.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The ranunculus requires a strong and moist soil, with a fourth of rotten dung. The soil should be from 18 in. to 2 ft. deep, and at&nbsp;about 5 in. below the surface there should be placed a stratum&nbsp;6 or 8 in. thick of two-year-old rotten cow-dung, mixed with earth,&nbsp;the earth above this stratum, where the roots are to be placed, being&nbsp;perfectly free from fresh dung. The tubers are planted in rows 5 or&nbsp;6 in. apart, and 3 or 4 in. apart in the rows, the turban sorts in October,&nbsp;the more choice varieties in February. They should be so close&nbsp;that the foliage may cover the surface of the bed. The autumn-planted roots must be sheltered from severe frost. The plants when&nbsp;in flower should be screened from hot sunshine with an awning;&nbsp;when the leaves wither, the roots are to be taken up, dried, and&nbsp;stored. The ranunculus is readily propagated from seed obtained&nbsp;from semi-double sorts, which are often of themselves very beautiful&nbsp;flowers. It is generally sown in boxes in autumn or spring. The&nbsp;young plants thus raised flower often in the second, and always in&nbsp;the third year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The turban varieties, which are very showy for the borders, are of a few positive colours, as scarlet, yellow, brown, carmine, and&nbsp;white. The florists’ varieties have been bred from the Persian&nbsp;type, which is more delicate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Other species known in gardens are </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">R. aconitifοlius</span><span class="font0"> (white bachelor’s buttons), with leaves recalling aconite, and white flowers; the&nbsp;double-flowered form is known in gardens as fair maids of France&nbsp;or fair maids of Kent. A double-flowered form of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">R</span><span class="font0">. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">acris</span><span class="font0"> is grown&nbsp;under the name yellow bachelor’s buttons. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">R. bulbosus</span><span class="font0"> also has&nbsp;a pretty double-flowered variety. Of dwarfer interesting plants&nbsp;there are </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">R. alpestris,</span><span class="font0"> 4 in., white; </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">R</span><span class="font0">. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">gramineus,</span><span class="font0"> 6 to 10 in., yellow;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">R</span><span class="font0">. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">parnassifolius,</span><span class="font0"> 6 in., white; and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">R</span><span class="font0">. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rutaefolius,</span><span class="font0"> 4 to 6 in., white&nbsp;with orange centre. Of the taller kinds mention may be made of&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">R</span><span class="font0">. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">cortusaefolius,</span><span class="font0"> a fine buttercup, 3-5 ft. high, from Teneriffe, and&nbsp;hardy in the mildest parts of Britain; and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">R. hyalli,</span><span class="font0"> known as the&nbsp;New Zealand water lily. It is a handsome species, 2 to 4 ft. high,&nbsp;with large peltate leaves often a foot in diameter, and with waxy&nbsp;white flowers about 4 in. across. It is not quite hardy, and even&nbsp;under the best conditions is a difficult plant to grow well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RAO, SIR DINKAR (1819-1896), Indian statesman, was born in Ratnagiri district, Bombay, on the 20th of December&nbsp;1819, being a Chitpaνan Brahmin. At fifteen he entered the&nbsp;service of the Gwalior state, in which his ancestors had served.&nbsp;Rapidly promoted to the responsible charge of a division, he&nbsp;displayed unusual talents in reorganizing the police and revenue&nbsp;departments, and in reducing chaos to order. In 1851 Dinkar&nbsp;Rao became dewan. The events which led to the British&nbsp;victories of Maharajpur and Panniar in 1844 had filled the&nbsp;state with mutinous soldiery, ruined the finances, and weakened&nbsp;authority. With a strong hand the dewan suppressed disorder,&nbsp;abolished ruinous imposts, executed public works, and by a&nbsp;reduction of salaries, including his own, turned a deficit into a&nbsp;surplus. When the contingent mutinied in 1857, he never&nbsp;wavered in loyalty; and although the state troops also mutinied&nbsp;in June 1858 on the approach of Tantia Topi, he adhered to&nbsp;the British cause, retiring with Maharaja Sindhia to the Agra&nbsp;fort. After the restoration of order he remained minister&nbsp;until December 1859. In 1873 he was appointed guardian to&nbsp;the minor Rana of Dholpur, but soon afterwards he resigned,&nbsp;owing to ill-health. In 1875 the viceroy selected him as a&nbsp;commissioner, with the Maharajas Sindhia and Jaipur, and&nbsp;three British colleagues, to try the Gaekwar of Baroda on a&nbsp;charge of attempting to poison the British resident. He also&nbsp;served in the legislative council of India, and was frequently&nbsp;consulted by viceroys on difficult questions. An estate was&nbsp;conferred upon him, with the hereditary title of Raja, for his&nbsp;eminent services, and the decoration of K.C.S.I. He died on&nbsp;the 9th of January 1896. No Indian statesman of the 19th&nbsp;century gained a higher reputation, yet he only commenced&nbsp;the study of English at the age of forty, and was never able to&nbsp;converse fluently in it; his orthodoxy resented social reforms;&nbsp;he kept aloof from the Indian Congress, and he had received no&nbsp;training in British administration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RAO, SIR T. MADHAVA (1828-1891), Indian statesman, was born at Combaconum in Madras in 1828. Madhava Rao created a&nbsp;new type of minister adapted to the modern requirements of a&nbsp;progressive native state, and he grafted it upon the old stock.&nbsp;He linked the past with the present, using the advantages of&nbsp;heredity, tradition and conservatism to effect reforms in the&nbsp;public administration and in Indian society. Sprung from a&nbsp;Mahratta Brahmin stock long settled at Tanjore, the son of a&nbsp;dewan of Travancore, he was educated in the strictest tenets of&nbsp;his sacred caste. But he readily imbibed the new spirit of the&nbsp;age. To mathematics, science and astronomy he added a study&nbsp;of English philosophy and international law, and a taste for art</span></p>
