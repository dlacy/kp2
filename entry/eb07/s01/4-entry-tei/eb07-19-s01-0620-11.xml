a large city of Turkey in Europe, the capital of a province of the same name, and anciently Thessalonica. It is situated on a bay formed by the two capes of the Great and Little Burnu. It is of a triangular shape, the base of which is on the sea-shore. The walls of brick, on a stone foundation, are of an unusual thickness, and defended by bastions at the appropriate points. The appearance of the city from without is magnificent, from the number of minarets, cupolas, and lofty buildings ; but the interior is found with narrow and crooked streets, disgusting public squares, and low, ill-built houses, resembling barracks ; but<pb facs="chi.28490931-1526160593_Page_676.jpf" xml:id="eb07-19-s01-0621"/>
still a considerable degree of cleanliness is observable everywhere. The quays are covered with sheds ; and the nume- , rous buyers and sellers who are congregated near them, and near the ships, present a striking picture of animation and bustle, and seem to confirm what is asserted by the natives, that Salonica is the first trading city of the Levant. The inhabitants are calculated, for they are not ascertained, to be between sixty and seventy thousand, of whom one half are Turks, one quarter Greeks, one fifth Jews, and the remainder Franks of all the several European nations, each of which have resident consuls. The manufactures are extensive, yielding cotton and silk goods, turkey leather, carpets, tobacco, and snuff, and the small articles of gold, silver, copper, steel, and iron ; these, and many raw materials, such as raw silk, cotton, wool, corn, oil, honey, wax, with opium and other drugs, form the exports. Although the excellence and security of the haven naturally creates great maritime commerce, yet that by land with Austria and Germany is very extensive, and at one period conveyed vast quantities of colonial wares to great distances in the interior of Europe, as long as Bonaparteâ€™s continental system was in force, and is still a valuable branch of the trade of this city. This place has institutions for education, and especially the Jews have an institution in which it is said there are more than a hundred tutors and a thousand pupils. The Greeks have several elementary schools, but none for the higher branches of learning. There are few remains of antiquity except the Hippodrome, which is of marble, and highly ornamented with most valuable sculpture. There is also a rotunda built in resemblance of that in Rome, and the remains of two triumphal arches built by Augustus and Constantine. In 1313 this city was ceded for a valuable consideration by the Greek emperors to the Venetians, who retained it ten years, and it fell under the Turks with Constantinople. Long. 22. 25. 25. E.
