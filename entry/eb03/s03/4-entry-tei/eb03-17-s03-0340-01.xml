(Dr fhomas), known to the learned world by his travels to Barbary and the Levant, was born at Kendal in Weſtmoreland about the year 1692. He was appointed chaplain to the Lngliſh conſul at Algiers, in which ſtation he continued for ſeveral years ; and from thence took proper opportunities of travelling into different parts. He returned in 1733 ; was elected fellow of the Royal Society ; and published the account of his travels at Oxford, folio, 1738. In 1740 he was nominated principal of St Edmond-hall, which he raiſed from a ruinous ſtate by his munificence ; and was regius professor of Greek at Oxford until his death, which happened in 1751. Dr Clayton, Bp. of Clogher, having attacked theſe Travels in his Description of the Eaſt, Dr Shaw publiſhed a ſupplement by way of vindication, which is incorporated into the second, edition of his Travels, prepared by himſelf, and published in 4to, 1757.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
