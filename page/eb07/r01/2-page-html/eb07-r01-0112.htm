<p><span class="font0">If it be a duty to send the gospel to all nations, it cannot cease to be a duty because we have been unsuccessful in our efforts. The want of success should merely lead us&nbsp;to reconsider the means to be employed. Hume remarks,&nbsp;that, prior to experience, we do not know whether or not&nbsp;the throwing of a pebble against the sky may not produce&nbsp;the ruin of the world. Some with regard to missions seem&nbsp;equally to overlook the proportion between cause and effect, and expect that any efforts, however ill directed,&nbsp;should be crowned with immediate success ; whilst others&nbsp;seem to suppose that no efforts can be successful, that the&nbsp;Orientals never change their opinions, and that they will&nbsp;continue steadfast to the same errors and the same idols&nbsp;which they have worshipped ever since the earliest dawn of&nbsp;history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But history itself might inform us that all nations have already changed their opinions. In China all modes of&nbsp;superstition are comparatively recent, the oldest, as far as&nbsp;they exist in that country, not being prior to Confucius, at&nbsp;least in their present form. If we look for aboriginal rites&nbsp;in India, we can only trace some broken remains of them&nbsp;amongst the barbarians of the remoter hills, or in the depth&nbsp;of the undisturbed forest. Where are the idols of the countries to the west of the Indus ? They are with the idols of&nbsp;Hamath, Arphad, and Sepharvaim. The beautiful deities&nbsp;of Greece are mingling their dust with the monster gods&nbsp;of the East, in irretrievable and indiscriminate confusion.&nbsp;Whatever obstacles may exist to the spread of Christianity,&nbsp;we cannot reckon amongst them, as of most importance, the&nbsp;obstinate tenacity with which men cleave to their previous&nbsp;opinions. No one need despair of converts since the orphan of Mecca has planted his victorious standards over the&nbsp;ruins of the thrones of Chosroes and Constantine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Not only are religious opinions continually changing, but all religions at this present moment, with the exception of&nbsp;Christianity, are in a state of continuous decay ; and not&nbsp;merely decaying themselves, but imparting their caducity&nbsp;to the states which uphold them ; and so forcible and rapid&nbsp;is that decline, that it counterbalances both the tendency&nbsp;of society to improve, and of the numbers of mankind to&nbsp;increase. On the contrary, wherever Christianity exists,&nbsp;even in its lowest form, there is an augmentation of the&nbsp;numbers of mankind and an improvement in their condition, so that the balance between Christianity and the unchristianized portions of the world is continually changing ;&nbsp;and whilst Christendom is filling with inhabitants, even to a&nbsp;dread, on the part of some, of an overflow, barbarous tribes&nbsp;are almost disappearing, and the Moslems are decreasing,&nbsp;and the far East is stationary, so that there is a provision&nbsp;making, even without the intention of Europe, for Europeans spreading their augmenting numbers over the remotest shores of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Independently of colonization, the new intercommunity of nations will efface ancient prejudices and national peculiarities. This has already taken place in Europe itself.&nbsp;The former French, were they to rise from the dead, must&nbsp;take their descendants for Englishmen ; and the ancient&nbsp;English might have equal difficulty in recognising their descendants, though, like all insular nations, less subject to&nbsp;change from the influx of foreign manners. Increasing intercourse has its effects upon the remotest districts. Individual originality and national peculiarity have, from continual attrition, lost their salient points, and are wearing&nbsp;away. The same causes which have operated in Europe&nbsp;will operate on a greater scale, though more slowly, on the&nbsp;world at large. The Moslems are forsaking their creed, and,&nbsp;what is still harder, their dress ; and Hindu rajahs quote&nbsp;Shakspeare, and read the Elegant Extracts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But the loss of old principles would merely produce demoralization, if no new ones were supplied. We are communicating to all the w<sup>,</sup>orld our vices and our diseases ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">shall we withhold the remedies with which we are combating, and, we trust, successfully struggling against both? W<sup>τ</sup>e are sending out missionaries of evil, the convict and the&nbsp;runaway, who are adding to the atrocities of savage warfare and of savage life. Their vices spread even faster than&nbsp;themselves, and reach to tribes which the white man has&nbsp;not visited ; and in a still more rapid and wider circle the&nbsp;diseases which are generated amidst the corruption and&nbsp;misery of European society, are spreading desolation and&nbsp;death in recesses where the name of Europe has scarcely&nbsp;been heard. It would be but common charity to send out&nbsp;physicians to these distant tribes, if they could be reached,&nbsp;to combat, with European remedies, diseases originated in&nbsp;Europe ; and it would be most unchristian neglect not to&nbsp;send out the physicians of the soul to apply healing remedies to those moral diseases, the contagion of which, as a&nbsp;nation, we have been so instrumental in extending.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Protestantmissionsare only in their commencement, therefore we have not the means to judge fairly of their success. Success in missions also must be distinguished into two&nbsp;kinds ; the gaining nominal, and the making real converts.&nbsp;We may compare </span><span class="font1">tlle </span><span class="font0">success of the gospel abroad with its&nbsp;results at home. The promised results are great and unconfined ; the real results comparatively small and limited.&nbsp;Multitudes of nominal Christians in our land pay just as&nbsp;much regard to the precepts of the gospel, in all the real&nbsp;business of life, as they do to the injunctions of the Koran.&nbsp;If we number those who are really living under tlle influence of the gospel, success in proportion to tlle number&nbsp;of those who proclaim it may be found to be fully as great&nbsp;abroad as at home. Each missionary effort will be found&nbsp;to have had nearly as much success, and of the same kind&nbsp;and value, as they originally proposed to themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The success of the Jesuits cannot be compared to that of any Protestant mission. Their aim was entirely different.&nbsp;What they asked of their converts, was not so much to embrace opinions, as to submit to rites ; and if they became&nbsp;outwardly Christian, they hoped partly to influence them,&nbsp;and still more their children, whose training would necessarily be placed in their hands. They attempted, and they&nbsp;succeeded in gaining the consideration, and in some degree&nbsp;tlle favour, of the higher classes, for their European attainments, by their politic habits of insinuation. It was not&nbsp;for their interest that the higher classes should become immediate converts. Whilst these retained their ancient superstition, they could afford the Jesuits a more effectual protection. As soon as the more powerful left their ancient&nbsp;belief, instead of helps they became hindrances to the&nbsp;mission, by the jealousies which they inspired, as the natural heads of a new and rising sect. Thus the influence&nbsp;which the Jesuits had acquired amongst the wise and powerful, and which had forwarded their cause at first, contributed to overthrow it ; for the political dexterity which had&nbsp;gained them friends necessarily raised up to them enemies&nbsp;in a still greater proportion. We cannot, on the whole,&nbsp;regret that the attempts of the Jesuits were not more successful. The experiment of Christianizing Paganism had&nbsp;already been attempted, on a large scale, in </span><span class="font1">tlle </span><span class="font0">Roman&nbsp;empire, under the successors of Constantine ; and the result was, as Mr Coleridge justly expresses it, “ Paganized Christianity.” The success of the Jesuits in China&nbsp;would have ended in attaching a new load of Pagan opinions and observances to that degenerate form of Christianity which was already labouring under an intolerable&nbsp;burden of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Dutch, the lowest in character perhaps of Protestant missions, appeared to have that measure of success which they aimed at. Numbers, under their routine of superficial teaching, assumed the outward form of Christianity, which was all that could reasonably have been expected&nbsp;from their efforts. In many later instances the success has</span></p>
