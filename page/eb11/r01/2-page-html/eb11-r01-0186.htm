<p><span class="font1">poem by Juan Ruiz, archipreste de Hita,@@<sup>1</sup> containing an enumeration of the musical instruments of his day, includes </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">el rave gritador con su alta nota</span><span class="font1"> (the shrill rebec with its high note) and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">el rabé&nbsp;morisco.</span><span class="font1"> By a process of deduction we have no difficulty in identi-fying the long, narrow, boat-shaped instrument as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">el rabé morisco,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">since the instrument has survived almost unchanged among the&nbsp;Arabs of the present day@@<sup>2</sup> from the 13th century, and probably&nbsp;from the early centuries of our era. The shrill rebec (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">el ravé&nbsp;gritador)</span><span class="font1"> with thinner strings was the pear-shaped instrument. In&nbsp;the magnificent MS. known as the Cantigas di Santa Maria, assigned&nbsp;to the 13th century,@@3 there are three of those boat-shaped rebecs&nbsp;played with a bow and one twanged by the fingers; they have&nbsp;finger-boards and two strings, and are held like the violoncello.&nbsp;Rebabs of this type, but without bows, were in use in ancient&nbsp;Persia, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">c.</span><span class="font1"> 789 b.c., as is demonstrated by some little terra-cotta&nbsp;figures of musicians unearthed in a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">tell</span><span class="font1"> at Suza.@@<sup>4</sup> Two of the&nbsp;instruments, held, however, like the violin, are unmistakably the&nbsp;archetypes of this rebec.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The rebec did not escape the general tendency so noticeable in Europe from the 12th to the 15th century towards the ornamentation&nbsp;of musical instruments with grotesque heads. The socket of the&nbsp;chaunter of the bagpipe, the heads of the cittern and ghittern, the&nbsp;mandoline and the rebec, were all alike decorated with grotesque&nbsp;human or animal heads, which in England became proverbial as&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">cittern-heads.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The boat-shaped rebec survived as the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sordino</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pochette.@@5</span><span class="font1"> an instrument widely used by dancing masters until the 19th century,&nbsp;when it was abandoned for the kit, a diminutive violin. The&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pochette,</span><span class="font1"> as its name in French and also in German </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Taschengeige)&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">indicates, was small enough to be carried in the pocket; it measured&nbsp;from 15 to 18 in. and was played with a correspondingly small bow.&nbsp;The 15th- and 16th-century rebec or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">geige,</span><span class="font1"> as the pear-shaped variety&nbsp;was called in Germany (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gigue</span><span class="font1"> in France), is figured by Sebastian&nbsp;Virdung;@@6 there were three strings tuned to G, D, A, and it had a&nbsp;finger-board cut in one piece with the sound-board in some cases&nbsp;and forming a step. Some writers consider that the addition of&nbsp;the finger-board constituted the difference between the geige and&nbsp;the rebec. Facts hardly support this theory, since the lyra teutonica&nbsp;in the 9th or 11th century already had a finger-board, and Farabi,&nbsp;the Arabic scholar of the 10th century, who was equally familiar&nbsp;with the Greek, Persian and Arabic musical systems, distinctly&nbsp;states that the rebab was also known as the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lyra.</span><span class="font1"> The modern&nbsp;Greek rebec with three strings is to this day played by rustic&nbsp;musicians under the name of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lyra.</span><span class="font1"> Moreover, in Germany, bowed&nbsp;instruments of all kinds were at first known as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">geige,</span><span class="font1"> in contradistinction to those whose strings were plucked, classed together as&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">cytharas</span><span class="font1"> or some word derived from it, the most modem example&nbsp;of which is the zither. With the rise of the viols and later of the&nbsp;violin, which represent the most perfect type of construction for&nbsp;stringed instruments, the rebec tribe, inferior in every respect and&nbsp;without artistic merit, was gradually relegated beyond the pale,@@<sup>7&nbsp;</sup>and by the 18th century had fallen into disuse except in certain&nbsp;rural districts, where for outdoor music, their shrill, penetrating tone&nbsp;continues to endear them to itinerant and village musicians.

<p><span class="font2">REBECCA RIOTS, the name given to some disturbances which occurred in 1843 in the counties of Pembroke, Carmarthen,&nbsp;Glamorgan, Cardigan and Radnor, after a slight outbreak of the&nbsp;same nature four years previously. During a period of exceptional distress the rioting was caused mainly by the heavy&nbsp;charges at the toll-gates on the public roads in South Wales, and&nbsp;the rioters took as their motto the words in Genesis xxiv. 60,&nbsp;“ And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou art our&nbsp;sister, be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let thy&nbsp;seed possess the gate of those which hate them.” Many of the&nbsp;rioters were disguised as women and were on horseback; each&nbsp;band was led by a captain called “ Rebecca,’’ his followers being&nbsp;known as “ her daughters.” They destroyed not only the gates&nbsp;but also the toll-houses, and the work was carried out suddenly&nbsp;and at night, but usually without violence to the toll-keepers,&nbsp;who were allowed to depart with their belongings. Emboldened&nbsp;by success, a large band of rioters marched into the town of&nbsp;Carmarthen on the 10th of June and attacked the workhouse, but&nbsp;on this occasion they were dispersed by a troop of cavalry which&nbsp;had hurried from Cardiff. The Rebeccaites soon became more&nbsp;violent and dangerous. They turned their attention to other&nbsp;grievances, real or fancied, connected with the system of land-holding, the administration of justice and other matters, and&nbsp;a state of terrorism quickly prevailed in the district. Under&nbsp;these circumstances the government despatched a large number&nbsp;of soldiers and a strong body of London police to South Wales,&nbsp;and the disorder was soon at an end. In October a commission&nbsp;was sent down to inquire into the causes of the riots. It was&nbsp;found that the grievances had a genuine basis; measures of&nbsp;relief were introduced, and South Wales was relieved from the&nbsp;burden of toll-gates, while the few rioters who were captured were&nbsp;only lightly punished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">REBELLION, the act or continuance in act of a rebel or rebels (Lat. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">rebellio, rebellis,</span><span class="font2"> a compound of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">re-,</span><span class="font2"> against, and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">bellum,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">war). A rebel is one who engages in armed resistance to the&nbsp;government to which he owes allegiance. For the distinction&nbsp;between Civil War and Rebellion, see War, Laws</span><span class="font0"> of. </span><span class="font2">Where&nbsp;individuals as distinguished from groups of men are concerned&nbsp;the character of rebel is easier to determine. That the alleged&nbsp;act of war was done by order of another cannot be in principle an&nbsp;excuse for a subject or citizen of any state taking arms against&nbsp;it. Under the rules of war adopted at the Hague in 1907,&nbsp;moreover, any excuse for doing so is removed by the provision&nbsp;that a belligerent is forbidden to compel nationals of the hostile&nbsp;party to take part in operations of war against their own&nbsp;country, “ even if they were in the belligerent’s service before&nbsp;the commencement of the war ” (art. 123). In the case of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">R. ν.&nbsp;Louw,</span><span class="font2"> known as the “ Calvinia Flogging case ” (Supreme Court&nbsp;of the Cape Colony, Feb. 18,1904), the question of the validity of&nbsp;the excuse of acting under orders contrary to allegiance was&nbsp;discussed in an uncertain spirit, and in a previous case, the Moritz&nbsp;case, tried before the Treason Court at Mafeking (Nov. 7, 1901),&nbsp;the court held that insurgent nationals “ who had joined the&nbsp;burghers must be placed on the same footing as burghers fighting&nbsp;against us.” There may be special circumstances operating&nbsp;to qualify the application of a principle, but the above stated&nbsp;principle, as such, must be regarded as the only legal basis of&nbsp;argument on the subject.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(T. Ba.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">REBUS (Lat. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">rebus, “</span><span class="font2"> by things ”), </span><span class="font0">a </span><span class="font2">sort of riddle consisting of the representation of some sentence or thing by means of&nbsp;pictures or words, or a combination of both. Rebuses first&nbsp;became popular in France, where they were at first called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">rébus&nbsp;de Picardie,</span><span class="font2"> that province, according to G. Menage (1613-1692),&nbsp;having been the scene of their origin, which he found in the&nbsp;satires written by the students and young clerks on the foibles of&nbsp;the day under the title “ </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">De rebus quae gerunlur.&quot;</span><span class="font2"> Camden&nbsp;mentions an instance of this kind of wit in a gallant who expressed his love to a woman named Rose Hill by painting in the&nbsp;border of his gown a rose, a hill, an eye, a loaf and a well; this,&nbsp;in the style of the rebus, reads “ Rose Hill I love well.’’ This&nbsp;kind of wit was happily ridiculed by Ben Jonson in the humorous&nbsp;description of Abel Drugger’s device in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Alchemist</span><span class="font2"> and by</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
