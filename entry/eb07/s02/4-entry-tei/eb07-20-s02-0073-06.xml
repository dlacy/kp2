a district in the Balaghaut ceded territories, situated principally between the fourteenth and fifteenth degrees of north latitude. It lies immediately within the Eastern Ghauts. It is a rocky and mountainous region, indifferently cultivated, but interspersed with fertile valleys. The chief river is the Pennar, and the principal town is Odegherry. The fortress of Sedhout, the capital of the above district, was taken by Meer Jumla about the year 1650. At this period Sedhout and the adjoining district were celebrated for their diamond mines, which, however, are no longer worked.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
