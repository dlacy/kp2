R 
or r 
, 
a liquid consonant, being the 17th letter of our alphabet. Its sound is formed by a guttural extrusion of the breath vibrated through the mouth, with a sort of quivering motion of the tongue drawn from the teeth, and canulated with the tip a little ele vated towards the palate. In Greek words it is fre quently aspirated with an 
h 
after it, as in 
rhapsody, rhetoric, ice. 
otherwise it is always followed by a vowel at the beginning of words and syllables. 
In the notes of the ancients, R. or RO. signisies 
Roma; 
R. C 
Romana civitas; 
R. G. C 
rei gerendœ caofa; 
R. F. E. D. 
recte factum et dictum;

and R. R. R. F. F. F.

Used as a numeral, R anciently stood for 80; and with a dash over it, thus R, for 80, 000; but the Greek 
r 
, 
p, with a small mark over it, signified 100; with the same mark under it, it denoted 1000 X 100; thus ç 
signisied 100, coo. In the Hebrew numeration i denoted 230 : and with two horizontal points over it 1000 X 200; thus u = 200, 000. 
In the prescriptions of physicians, R or Ç» stands for 
recipe, i. 
e. "take.”
