<p><span class="font1">infinite </span><span class="font0">variety of circumſtances, a powerful obſtacle to the practice of moral virtues, to the progreſs of truth,&nbsp;and a weight which prevents them from riſing to that&nbsp;degree of knowledge and perfection of which human nature is capable. They multiply without ceaſing the&nbsp;occaſions of vice, by the facility which they give to ſa-tisfy a multitude of irregular paſſions, and to turn at&nbsp;length thoſe who are attached to them from the&nbsp;road of virtue, and from the deſire of inquiring after&nbsp;truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is this which Seneca means to expreſs, when he ſays, “ that riches in a vaſt number of caſes have been&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">a </span><span class="font0">great obſtacle to philoſophy ; and that, to enjoy freedom of mind neceſſary for ſtudy, a man muſt live in&nbsp;poverty, or as if he were poor. Everyman (adds he)&nbsp;who wiſhes to lead a pleaſant, tranquil, and ſecure life,&nbsp;muſt avoid, as much as poſſible, the deceitfulneſs of&nbsp;riches, which are a bait with which we allow ourſelves&nbsp;to be taken as in a ſnare, without afterwards having&nbsp;the power to extricate ourſelves, being ſo much the&nbsp;more unhappy, that we believe we poſſeſs them, while,&nbsp;on the contrary, they tyrrannize over us.” </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Senec. Epiſt. 17.</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Epiſt.</span><span class="font1"> 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ The wiſe man (ſays the ſame author in another place) does not love riches to exceſs, but he would not&nbsp;.choofe wholly to diveſt himſelf of them ; he does not&nbsp;receive them into his ſoul, but into his houſe ; he is&nbsp;careful of them, and employs them for the purpoſe of&nbsp;opening a wide field for virtue, and of making it appear in all its ſplendor. Who can doubt that a wiſe&nbsp;man has not more occaſions of diſplaying the elevation&nbsp;and greatneſs of his mind when he is poſſeſſed of riches&nbsp;than when he labours under indigence, ſince, in the laſt&nbsp;condition, he can exerciſe only one virtue, namely, resignation ; whereas, riches give him an opportunity of&nbsp;diſplaying, in their greateſt luſtre, the virtues of temperance, liberality, diligence, regularity, and magnificence. There is no occaſion, then, to prohibit philosophers from the uſe of wealth, or to condemn wiſdom&nbsp;to poverty. The philoſopher may poſſeſs the greateſt&nbsp;riches, provided he has not employed force or ſhed&nbsp;blood in acquiring them ; provided he has not gained&nbsp;them by unjuſt or illegal means ; in a word, provided&nbsp;the uſe which he makes of them be as pure as the&nbsp;ſource from which they were derived, and no perſon&nbsp;(the envious excepted) regretting his poſſeſſion ; he will&nbsp;not refuſe the kindneſsof fortune, and will enjoy, without ſhame or pride, the wealth acquired by honeſt&nbsp;means ; he will have more reaſon to glory, if, after ex-poſinghis riches to the view of the whole world,&nbsp;he can deſire any perſon to carry away the reward&nbsp;of treachery or the fruits of oppreſſion. If, after&nbsp;theſe words, his riches continue undiminiſhed, this man&nbsp;is truly great, and worthy to be rich. If he has not&nbsp;allowed to enter into his poſſeſſion the ſinalleſt piece of&nbsp;money gained by unwarrantable means, neither will he&nbsp;refuſe the greateſt riches, which are the bleſſings of fortune, and the huit of virtue : if he can be rich, he will&nbsp;chooſe to be ſo, and he ſhall have riches ; but he will&nbsp;regard them as bleſſings of uncertain poſſeſſion, and of&nbsp;which he may be every moment deprived ; he will not&nbsp;permit them to be a load to himſelf or to others ; he&nbsp;will give them to the good, or to thoſe whom he would&nbsp;make good ; but he will give them with the niceſt wiſ-dom, taking care always to diſtribute them to the moil&nbsp;worthy, and to thoſe who remember </span><span class="font1">that </span><span class="font0">they muſt&nbsp;give an account, as well of the wealth which they receive from heaven, as of the purpoſes to which it is ap∙&nbsp;plied.” </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Senec. de Vita Beata.,</span><span class="font0"> cap. 21, 22, &amp; 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RICHLIEU (John Armand du Pleſſis de), cardinal of Richlieu and Fronſac, biſhop of Lucon, &amp;c. was born at Paris in 1585. He was of excellent parts ;&nbsp;and at the age of 2 2 had the addref3 to obtain a diſpen ∙&nbsp;ſation to enjoy the biſhopric of Lucon in 1607. Returning into France, he applied himſelf in a particular&nbsp;manner to the function of preaching ; and his reputation this way procured him the office of almoner to the&nbsp;queen Mary de Medicis. His abilities in the management of affairs advanced him to be ſecretary of ſtate in&nbsp;1616 ; aftd the king ſoon gave him the preference to all&nbsp;his other ſecretaries. The death of the marquis&nbsp;d’Ancre having produced a revolution in ſtate affairs,&nbsp;Richlieu retired to Avignon ; where he employed himſelf in compoſing books of controverſy and piety. The&nbsp;king having recalled him to court, he was made a cardinal in 1622 ; and, two years after, firſt miniſter of ſtate,&nbsp;and grand maſter of the navigation. In 1626, the iſle&nbsp;of Rhée was preſerved by his care, and Rochelle taken,&nbsp;having ſtopped up the haven by that famous dyke which&nbsp;he ordered to be made there. He accompanied the king&nbsp;to the ſiege of Cazal, and contributed not a little to&nbsp;the raiſing of it in 1629. He alſo obliged the Huguenots to the peace at Akts, which proved the ruin of&nbsp;that party ; he took Pamerol, and ſuccoured Cazal be-ſieged by Spinola. In the mean time the nobles found&nbsp;fault with his conduct, and perſuaded the king to diſ-card him. The cardinal, for his part, was unmoved&nbsp;with it ; and by his reaſonings overthrew what was&nbsp;thought to be determined againſt him ; ſo that, inſtead&nbsp;of being diſgraced, he from that moment became more&nbsp;powerful than ever. He puniſhed all his enemies in the&nbsp;ſame manner as they would have had him ſuffer ; and&nbsp;the day which produced this event, ſo glorious to cardinal Richlieu, was called the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">day of dupes.</span><span class="font0"> This able&nbsp;miniſter had from thenceforwards an aſcendancy over the&nbsp;king’s mind ; and he now reſolved to humble the exceſſive pride of the houſe of Auſtria. For that purpoſe&nbsp;he concluded a treaty with Guſtaphus Adolphus king&nbsp;of Sweden, for carrying the war into the heart of Germany. He alſo entered into a league with the duke of&nbsp;Bavaria ; ſecured Lorrain ; railed a part of the princes&nbsp;of the empire againſt the emperor ; treated with the&nbsp;Dutch to continue the war againſt Spain ; favoured the&nbsp;Catalans and Portugueſe till they ſhook off the Spaniſh&nbsp;yoke ; and, in ſhort, took ſo many different meaſures,&nbsp;that he accompliſhed his deſign ; and after having carried on the war with ſucceſs, was thinking of concluding&nbsp;it by a peace, when he died at Paris on the 4th of December 1642, aged 58. He was interred in the Sorbonne, where a magnificent mauſoleum is erected to his&nbsp;memory. This great politician made the arts and ſciences&nbsp;flouriſh; formed the botanical garden at Paris, called the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">kings garden ;</span><span class="font0"> founded the French academy ; eſtabliſh-ed the royal printingſhouſe ; erected the palace afterwards&nbsp;called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Le Palais Royal,</span><span class="font0"> which he preſented to the king;&nbsp;and rebuilt the Sorbonne with a magnificence that appears truly royal. Beſides his books of controverſy and&nbsp;piety, there go under the name of this miniſter, A&nbsp;Journal, in </span><span class="font1">2 </span><span class="font0">vols 12mo ; and a Political Teſtament, in&nbsp;12mo ; all treating of politics and </span><span class="font1">ſtate </span><span class="font0">affairs.
