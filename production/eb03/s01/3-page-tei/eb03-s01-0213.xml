He coloured his contumacy with the ſpecious pretext, that his brother's fate, and thoſe of his two kinſmen, ſufficiently inſtructed him never to truſt to James or his miniſters; that he had gone too far to think now of receding; and that kings, when once offended, as James had been, never pardoned in good earneſt. Such were the chief reaſons, with others of leſs conſequence, which Drummond has put into the mouth of Douglas at this time. James, after his expedition into Annandale, found the ſeaſon too far advanced to continue his operations; and returning to Edinburgh, he marched northwards to Angus, to reduce the earl of Crawford, who was the ſecond rebel of power in the kingdom. That nobleman had hitherto deferred throwing himſelf at the king’s feet, and had reſumed his arms, in the manner related, only in hopes that better terms might be obtained from James for himſelf and his party. Perceiving that the earl of Douglas’s obſtinacy had cooled ſome other lords of the confederacy, and had put an end to all hopes of a treaty, he reſolved to make a merit of breaking the confederacy, by being the firſt to ſubmit. James having arrived in Angus, was continuing his march through the country, when the earl and ſome of his chief followers fell on their knees before him on the road, bareheaded and barefooted. Their dreary looks, their ſuppliant poſtures, and the tears which ſtreamed abundantly from the earl, were expreſſive of the moſt abject contrition; which was followed by a penitential ſpeech made by the earl, acknowledging his crimes, and imploring forgiveneſs.</p><p>James was then attended by his chief counſellois, particularly biſhop Kennedy, who, he reſolved, ſhould have ſome ſhare in the favour he meant to extend to the earl. He aſked their advice; which proving to be on the merciful ſide, James promiſed to the earl and his followers reſtitution of all their eſtates and honours, and full pardon for all that had paffed. The earl, as a grateful retribution for this favour, before the king left Angus, joined him with a noble troop of his friends and followers; and, attending him to the north, was extremely active in foppreſſing all the remains of the rebellion there.</p><p>The ſubmiſſion of the earl of Crawford was followed by that of the earl of Douglas; which, however, continued only for a ſhort time. This powerful nobleman ſoon reſumed his rebellious practices; and, in the year 1454, raiſed an army to fight againſt the king. The king erected his ſtandard at St Andrew’s; marched from thence to Falkland; and ordered all the forces of Fife, Angus, and Strathern, with thoſe of the northern parts, to rendezvous by a certain day at Stirling; which they did to the number of 30,000. Douglas aſſembled his forces, which amounted to 40,000, ſome ſay 60,000 men, on the ſouth ſide of the river Carron, about half way between Stirling and Abercorn. However, notwithſtanding this ſuperiority of force, the earl did not think it proper to fight his ſovereign. Biſhop Kennedy, the prelate of St Andrew’s, had adviſed the king to divide his enemies by offering them pardon ſeparately; and ſo good an effect had this, that in a few days the earl found himſelf deſerted by all his numerous army, excepting about 100 of his neareſt friends and domeſtics, with whom he retired towards England. His</p><p>friends had indeed adviſed him to come to a battle immediately ; but the earl, for reaſons now unknown, refuſed. However, in his journey ſouthward, he railed a conſiderable body of forces, confiding of his own tenants, of outlaws, robbers, and borderers, with whom he renewed his depredations on the loyal ſubjects of the king. He was oppoſed by the earl of Angus, who, though of the name of Douglas, continued firm in the royal cauſe. An engagement enſued at Ancrammuir; where Douglas was entirely defeated, and he himſelf with great difficulty eſcaped to an adjacent wood. What his fate was after this battle does not appear; but it is certain that his eſtates were afterwards forfeited to the king.</p><p>The reſt of the reign of James II. was ſpent in making proper regulations for the good of his people. In 1460 he was killed at the ſiege of Roxburgh caſtle, by the burſting of a cannon, to which he was too near when it was diſcharged. This ſiege he had undertaken in favour of the queen of England, who, after loſing ſeveral battles, and being reduced to diſtreſs, was obliged to apply to James for relief. The nobility who were preſent concealed his death, for fear of diſcouraging the ſoldiers; and in a few hours after, the queen appeared in the camp, and preſented her young ſon, James III. as their king.</p><p>James III. was not quite ſeven years of age at his acceſſion to the crown. The adminiſtration naturally devolved on his mother; who puſhed the ſiege of Roxburgh caſtle with ſo much vigour, that the garriſon was obliged to capitulate in a few days; after which the army ravaged the country, and took and diſmantled the caſtle of Wark.—In 1466, negociations were begun for a marriage between the young king and Margaret princeſs of Denmark; and, in 1468, the following conditions were ſtipulated. 1. That the annual rent hitherto paid for the northern Iſles of Orkney and Shetland ſhould be for ever remitted and extinguiſhed. 2. That king Chriſtiern, then king of Denmark, ſhould give 60,000 florins of gold for his daughter’s portion, whereof 10,000 ſhould be paid before her departure from Denmark; and that the iſlands of Orkney ſhould be made over to the crown of Scotland, by way of pledge for the remainder; with this expreſs proviſo, that they ſhould return to that of Norway after complete payment of the whole ſum. 3. That king James ſhould, in caſe of his dying before the ſaid Margaret his ſρouſe, leave her in poſſeſſion of the palace of Linlithgow and caſtle of Down in Menteith, with all their appurtenances, and the third part of the ordinary revenues of the crown, to be enjoyed by her during life, in caſe ſhe ſhould chooſe to reſide in Scotland 4. But if ſhe rather choſe to return to Denmark, that in lieu of the ſaid liferent, palace, and caſtle, ſhe ſhould accept of 120,000 florins of the Rhine; from which ſum the 50,000 due for the remainder of her portion being deduced and allowed, the iſlands of Orkney ſhould be reannexed to the crown of Norway as before.</p><p>When theſe articles were agreed upon, Chriſtiern found himſelf unable to fulfil his part of them. Being at that time engaged in an unſucceſsful war with Sweden, he could not advance the 10,000 florins which he had promiſed to pay down as part of his daughter’s fortune. He was therefore obliged to apply to the plenipotentiaries to accept of 2000, and to take a farther</p></body></text></TEI>
