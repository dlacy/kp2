 in botany: A genus of plants belonging to the order of dodecagynia, and to the claſs of dodecandria ; and in the natural method ranking under the 13th order, <hi rend="italic">Succulentae.</hi> The calyx is divided into 12 parts ; the petals are 12, and the capſules<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0269.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0263"/>
12, containing many ſeeds. There are 12 ſpecies ; the arboreum, canarienſe, glutinoſum, glanduloſum, tectorum, globiſerum, villoſum, tortuoſum, arachnoideum, montanum, ſedeforme, and menanthes. Linnæus has only eight of theſe. The tectorum alone is a native of Britain. The ſtalk is about a foot high ; the radical leaves are thick, oval, pointed, fringed, and ſpreading in a roſe ; thoſe on the item are imbricated and membranous : the flowers are pale red and ſeſſile, and grow on curved terminal bunches. It is frequent on the tops of houfes, and flowers in July.</p><p>The following chemical deſcription of this ſpecies is given by Lewis : “ The leaves of houſe-leek, of no remarkable ſmell, diſcover to the taſte a mild ſubacid auſterſty : their expreſſed juice, of a pale yellowiſh hue when filtered, yields on inſpiſſation a deep yellow, tenacious, mucilaginous maſs, conliderably acidulous and acerb : from whence it may be preſumed, that this herb has ſome claim to the refrigerant and reſtringent virtues that have been aſcribed to it. It is obſervable that the filtered juice, on the addition of an equal quantity of rectified spirit of wine, forms a light white coagulum, like cream of fine pomatum, of a weak but penetrating taſte : this, freed from the fluid part, and expoſed to the air, almoſt totally exhales. From this experiment ſt is concluded by ſome, that houſe-leek contains a volatile alkaline ſalt : but the juice coagulates in the ſame manner with volatile alkalis themſelves, as alſo with fixed alkalis : Acids produce no coagulation.”</p></div></body></text></TEI>
