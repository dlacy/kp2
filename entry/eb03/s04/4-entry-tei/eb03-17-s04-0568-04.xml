a number of rational and moral beings, united for their common preſervation and happineſs.</p><p>There are ſhoals of fiſhes, herds of quadrupeds, and flocks of birds. But till obſervation enable us to determine with greater certainty, how far the inferior animals are able to look through a ſeries of means to the end which theſe are calculated to produce, how far their conduct may be influenced by the hope of reward and the fear of punishment, and whether they are at all capable of moral diſtinctions—we cannot with propriety apply to them the term <hi rend="italic">Society.</hi> We call crows, and beavers, and ſeveral other ſpecies oſ animals, <hi rend="italic">gregarious ;</hi> but it is hardly good Engliſh to ſay that they are <hi rend="italic">ſocial.</hi></p><p>It is only human ſociety, then, that can become the ſubject of our preſent inveſtigation. The phenomena which it preſents are highly worthy of our notice.</p><p>Such are the advantages which each individual evidently derives from living in a ſocial ſtate ; and ſo helpleſs does any human being appear in a solitary ſtate, that we are naturally led to conclude, that if there ever was a period at which mankind were ſolitary beings, that period could not be of long duration ; for their aversion to ſolitude and love of society would ſoon induce them to enter into ſocial union. Such is the opinion which we are led to conceive, when we compare our own condition as members of civilized and enlightened society with that of the brutes around us, or with that of ſavages in the earlier and ruder periods of ſocial life. When we hear of Indians wandering naked through the woods, deſtitute of arts, unskilled in agriculture, ſcarce capable oſ moral diſtinctions, void of all religious ſentiments, or poſſeſſed with the moſt abſurd notions concerning ſuperior powers, and procuring means of ſubſiſtence in a manner equally precarious with that of the beaſts of prey—we look down with pity on their condition, or turn from it with horror. When we view the order of cultivated ſociety, and conſider our inſtitutions, arts, and manners—we rejoice over our ſuperior wiſdom and happineſs.</p><p>Man in a civilized ſtate appears a being of a ſuperior order to man in a ſavage ſtate ; yet ſome philoſophers tell us, that it is only he who, having been educated in ſociety. has been taught to depend upon others, that can be helpleſs or miſerable when placed in a ſolitarv ſtate. They view the ſavage who exerts himſelf with intrepidity to ſupply his wants, or bears them with fortitude, as the greateſt hero, and poſſeſſing the greateſt happineſs. And therefore if we agree with them, that the propenſities of nature may have prompted men to<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0575.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s04-0569"/>
enter into facial union, though they may have hoped to enjoy ſuperior ſecurity and happineſs by engaging to protect and ſupport each other, we muſt conclude that the Author of the univerſe has deſtined man to attain greater dignity and happineſs in a ſavage and ſolitary than in a facial ſtate ; and therefore that thoſe diſpofitions and views which lead us to ſociety are fallacious and inimical to our real intereſt.</p><p>Whatever be the ſuppoſed advantages of a ſolſtary ſtate, certain it is that mankind, at the earlieſt periods, were united in ſociety. Various theories have been formed concerning the circumſtances and principles which gave riſe to this union : but we have elſewhere ſhown, that the greater part of them are founded in error; that they suppoſe the original ſtate of man to have been that of savages ; and that ſuch a ſuppoſition is contradicted by the moſt authentic records of antiquity. For though the records oſ the earlier ages are generally obſcure, fabulous, and imperfect ; yet happily there is <hi rend="italic">one</hi> free ſrom the imperfections of the reſt, and of undoubted authenticity, to which we may ſafely have recourſe @@*. This record is the Pentateuch of Moſes, which preſents us with a genuine account of the origin of man and of ſociety, perfectly conſonant to what we have laid down in the article referred to (ſee <hi rend="smallcaps">Savage).</hi> According to Moſes, the firſt ſociety was that of a huſband and wife united in the bonds of marriage : the firſt government that of a father and husband, the maſter of his family. Men lived together under the patriarchal form of government while they employed themſelves chiefly in tending flocks and herds. Children in ſuch circumſtances cannot ſoon riſe to an equality with their parents, where a man’s importance depends on his property, not on his abilities. When flocks and herds are the chief articles of property, the ſon can only obtain theſe from his father; in general therefore the ſon muſt be entirely dependent on the father for the means of ſubsiſtence If the parent during his life bestow on his children any part of his property, he may do it on ſuch conditions as ſhall make their dependence upon him continue till the period of his death. When the community are by this event deprived of their head, inſtead of continuing in a ſtate of union, and ſelecting ſome one from among themſelves whom they may inveſt with the authority of a parent, they ſeparate into ſo many diſtinct tribes, each ſubjected to the authority of a different lord, the maſter of the family, and the proprietor of all the flocks and herds belonging to it. Such was the ſtate of the firſt ſocieties which the narrative of Moſes exhibits to our attention.</p><p>Thoſe philoſophers who have made ſociety, in its various ſtages between rudeneſs and refinement, the ſubject of their ſpeculations, have generally conſidered mankind, in whatever region of the globe, and under whatever climate, as proceeding uniformly through certain regular gradations from one extreme to the other. They regard them, firſt, as gaining a precarious ſubſiſtence by gathering the ſpontaneous fruits of the earth, preying on the inhabitants of the waters, if placed on the ſea ſhore, or along the banks of large rivers ; or hunting wild beaſts, if in a situation where theſe are to be found in abundance, without foreſight or induſtry to provide for future wants when the preſent call of appetite is gratified. Next, they ſay, man riſes to the ſhepherd ſtate, and next to that of husbandmen, when thev tarn their</p><p>attention from the management of flocks to the cultivation of the ground. Next, theſe husbandmen improve their powers, and better their condition, by becoming artizans and merchants ; and the beginning of this period is the boundary between barbarity and civilization.</p><p>Theſe are the ſtages through which they who have employed themſelves on the natural hiſtory of ſociety have generally conducted mankind in their progreſs from rudeneſs to refinement : but they ſeem to have overlooked the manner in which mankind were at firſt eſtabliſhed on this earth; for the circumſtances in which the parents of the human race were originally placed ; for the degree of knowledge communicated to them ; and for the inſtruction which they muſt have been capable of communicating to their posterity. They rather appear to conſider the inhabitants of every different region of the globe as aborigines, ſpringing at firſt from the ground, or dropped on the ſpot which they inhabit ; no leſs ignorant than infants of the nature and relations of the objects around them, and of the purpoſes which they may accompliſh by the exerciſe of their organs and faculties.</p><p>The abſurdity of this theory has been fully demonſtrated in another place : and if we agree to receive the Moſaic account of the original eſtabliſhment of mankind, we ſhall be led to view the phenomena of facial life in a light very different. We muſt firſt allow, that though many of the rudeſt tribes are found in the ſtate of <hi rend="italic">hunters</hi> or fis <hi rend="italic">hers ;</hi> yet the hunting or fiſhing ſtate cannot have been invariably the primary form of ſociety. Notwithſtanding the powers with which we are endowed, we are in a great meaſure the creatures of circumſtances. Physical cauſes exert, though indirectly, a mighty influence in forming the character and directing the exertions of the human race. From the information of Moſes we gather, that the firſt ſocieties of men lived under the patriarchal form of government, and employed themſelves in the cultivation of the ground and the management of flocks. And as we know that mankind, being ſubjected to the influence both of physical and moral cauſes, are no leſs liable to degeneracy than capable of improvement ; we may eaſily conceive, that though deſcending all from the ſame original pair, and though enlightened with much traditionary knowledge relative to the arts of life, the order of ſociety, moral distinctions, and religious obligations; yet as they were gradually, and by various accidents, diſperſed over the earth, being removed to situations in which the arts with which they were acquainted could but little avail them, where induſtry was overpowered, or indolence encouraged by the ſeverity or the profusion of nature, they might degenerate and fall into a condition almoſt as humble and precarious as that of the brutal tribes. Other moral cauſes might also concur to debaſe or elevate the human character in that early period. The particular character of the original ſettlers in any region, the manner in which they were connected with one another, and the arts which they were beſt qualified to exerciſe, with various other cauſes of a ſimilar nature, would have conſiderable influence in determining the character of the ſociety.</p><p>When laying aside the ſpirit of theory and ſyſtem, we ſet ourfelves, with due humility, to trace facts, and to liſten to evidence, though our diſcoveries may be@@@[m]* See Scripture, n⁰7- 35.<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0576.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s04-0570"/>
fewer than we ſhould otherwiſe fancy them ; yet the knowledge which we thus acquire will be more uſeful and ſolid, and our ſpeculations more conſiſtent with the ſpirit of true philoſophy. Here, though we learn from the information of the ſacred writings, that the firſt family of mankind was not cruelly expoſed in this world, as children whom the inhumanity of their parents induces them to deſert ; yet we are not, in conſequence of admitting this fact, laid under any neceſſity of denying or explaining away any of the other phenomena which occur to our obſervation when tracing the natural hiſtory of ſociety. Tradition may be corrupted ; arts and ſciences may be loſt ; the ſublimeſt religious doctrines may be debated into abſurdity.</p><p>If then we are deſirous of ſurveying ſociety in its rudeſt form, we muſt look, not to the earlieſt period of its exiſtence, but to thoſe diſtricts of the globe where external circumſtances concur to drive them into a ſtate of ſtupidity and wretchedneſs. Thus in many places of the happy clime oſ Asia, which a variety of ancient records concur with the ſacred writings in repreſentiug as the firſt peopled quarter of the globe, we cannot trace the form of ſociety backwards beyond the ſhepherd ſtate. In that ſtate indeed the bonds which connect ſociety extend not to a wide range of individuals, and men remain for a long period in diſtinct families ; but yet that ſtate is highly favourable to knowledge, to happineſs, and to virtue. Again, the torrid and the frozen regions of the earth, though probably peopled at a later period, and by tribes ſprung from the ſame ſtock with the ſhepherds of Aſia, have yet exhibited mankind in a much lower ſtate. It is in the parched deſerts of Africa and the wilds of America that human beings have been found in a condition approaching the neareſt to that of the brutes.</p><p>We may therefore with ſome propriety deſert the order of time, and take a view of the different ſtages through which philoſophers have conſidered mankind as advancing, beginning with that of rudeneſs, though we have ſhown . that it cannot have been the firſt in the progrefs.</p><p>Where the human ſpecies are found in the loweſt and rudeſt ſtate, their rational and moral powers are very faintly diſplayed ; but their external ſenſes are acute, and their bodily organs active and vigorous. Hunting and fiſhing are then their chief employments on which they depend for ſupport. During that portion of their time which is not ſpent in theſe purſuits, they are ſunk in liſtleſs indolence. Deſtſtute of foreſight, they are rouſed to active exertion only by the preſſure of immediate neceſſity or the urgent calls of appetite. Accuſtomed to endure the ſeverity of the elements, and but ſcantily provided with the means of ſubſiſtence, they acquire habits of reſignation and fortitude, which are beheld with aſtoniſhment by thoſe who enjoy the plenty and indulgence of cultivated life. But in this ſtate of want and depreſſion, when the powers and posſeſſions of every individual are ſcarce sufficient for his own ſupport, when even the calls of appetite are repreſſed becauſe they cannot always be gratified, and the more refined paſſions, which either originate from ſuch as are merely animal, or are intimately connected with them, have not yet been felt—in this ſtate all the milder affections are unknown ; or if the breaſt is at all ſenſible to their impulse, it is extremely feeble. husband and</p><p>wife, parent and child, brother and brother, are united by the weakeſt ties. Want and misfortune are not pitied. Why indeed ſhould they, where they cannot be relieved ? It is impoſſible to determine how far beings in this condition can be capable of moral diſtinctions. One thing certain is, that in no ſtate are the human race entirely incapable of theſe. If we liſten, however, to the relations of reſpectable travellers, we muſt admit that human beings have ſometimes been found in that abject ſtate where no proper ideas of subordination, government, or diſtinction of ranks, could be formed. No diſtinct notions of Deity can be here entertained. Beings in ſo humble a condition cannot look through the order of the univerſe and the harmony of nature to that Eternal Wiſdom and Goodneſs which contrived, and that Almighty Power which brought into exiſtence, the ſyſtem of things. Of arts they muſt be almoſt totally deſtitute. They may uſe ſome inſtruments for fiſhing or the chace ; but theſe muſt be extremely rude and ſimple. If they be acquainted with any means to ſhelter them from the inclemency of the elements, both their houſes and clothing will be awkward and inconvenient.</p><p>But human beings have net been often found in ſo rude a ſtate as this. Even thoſe tribes which we denominate ſavage, are for the moſt part farther removed from mere animal life. They generally appear united under ſome ſpecies of government, exerciſing the powers of reaſon, capable of morality, though that morality be not always very refined ; diſplaying ſome degree of ſocial virtues, and acting under the influence of religious ſentiments. Thoſe who may be conſidered as but one degree higher in the ſcale than the ſtupid and wretched beings whoſe condition we have ſurveyed, are to be found ſtill in the hunting and fiſhing ſtate ; but they are farther advanced towards ſocial life, and are become more ſenſible to the impulſe of ſocial affection. By unavoidable intercourſe in their employments, a few individual hunters or fiſhers contract a certain elegree of fondneſs for each other’s company, and are led to take ſome part in each other’s joys and ſorrows ; and when the ſocial affections thus generated (ſee <hi rend="smallcaps">Passion)</hi> begin to exert themſelves, all the other powers of the mind are at the fame time called forth, and the circumſtances oſ the little ſociety are immediately improved. We behold its members in a more comfortable condition, and find reaſon to view the human character with more complacency and reſpect. Huts are now built, more commodious clothes are faſhioned, inſtruments for the annoyance of wild beaſts and even of enemies are contrived ; in ſhort, arts, and science, and ſocial order, and religious ſentiments, and ceremonies, now make their appearance in the riſing ſociety, and ſerve to characterize it by the particular form which diſtinguiſhes each of them. But though ſocial order is no longer unknown nor unobſerved, yet the form of government is ſtill extremely ſimple, and its ties are but looſe and feeble. It will perhaps bear ſome reſemblance to the patriarchal ; only all its members are on a more equal footing, and at the ſame time leſs cloſely connected than in the ſhepherd ſtate, to which that form of government ſeems almoſt peculiar. The old men arc treated with veneration ; but the young are not entirely ſubject to them. They may liſten reſpectfully to their advice ; but they do not submit to their arbitrary<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0577.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s04-0571"/>
commands. Where mankind are in the ſtate of hunters and fiſhers, where the means of ſubſiſtence are precariouſly acquired, and prudent foreſight does not prompt to accumulate much proviſion for the future, no individual can acquire comparative wealth. As ſoon as the ſon is grown up, he ceaſes to be dependent on his father, as well as on the ſociety in general. Difference of experience therefore constitutes the only diſtinction between the young and the old ; and if the old have experience, the young have ſtrength and activity. Here, then, neither age nor property can give riſe to any ſtriking diſtinction of ranks. All who have attained to manhood, and are not diſabled by unuſual deficiency of ſtrength or agility, or by the infirmities of old age, are on an equal footing ; or if any one posseſs a pre-eminence over the reſt, he owes it to ſuperior addreſs or fortitude. The whole tribe deliberate ; the old give their advice ; each individual of the aſſembly receives or rejects it at his pleaſure (for the whole body think not of exerciſing any compulſatory power over the will of individuals) ; and the warrior who is moſt diſtinguiſhed for ſtrength, addreſs, and valour, leads out the youth of the tribe to the chace or againſt the enemy. War, which in the former ſtage did not prevail, as they who were ſtrangers to social ſentiments were, at the ſame time, ſcarce capable of being enemies, now firſt begins to depopulate the thinly inhabited regions where thoſe hunters and fiſhers purſue their prey. They are ſcattered, poſſibly in ſcanty and ſeparate tribes, over an immenſe tract of country ; but they know no medium between the affection which brethren of the ſame tribe bear to each other and the hatred of enemies. Though thinly ſcattered over the earth, yet the hunting parties of different tribes will ſometimes meet as they range the foreſts ; and when they meet, they will naturally view each other with a jealous eye ; for the ſucceſs of the one party in the chace may cauſe the other to be unſucceſsful ; and while the one ſnatches the prey, the other muſt return home to all the pangs of famine. Inveterate hoſtility will therefore long prevail among neighbouring tribes in the hunting ſtate.</p><p>If we find them not incapable of social order, we may naturally expect that their conduct will be influenced by ſome ſentiments of religion. They have at this period ideas of ſuperior beings. They alio practiſe certain ceremonies to recommend them to thoſe beings ; but both their ſentiments and ceremonies are ſuperſtitious and abſurd.</p><p>We have elſewhere ſhown (ſee <hi rend="smallcaps">Polytheism)</hi> how ſavage tribes have probably degenerated from the pure worſhip of the one true God to the adoration of a multitude of imaginary divinities in heaven, earth, and hell. We have traced this idolatrous worſhip from that of the heavenly bodies, through all the gradations of daemon-worſhip, hero-worſhip, and ſtatue-worſhip, to that wonderful inſtance of abſurd ſuperſtition which induced the inhabitants of some countries to fall proſtrate in adoration before the vileſt reptiles. But though we are convinced that the heavenly bodies have by all idolaters been conſidered as their firſt and greateſt gods, we pretend not that the progreſs through the other ſtages of polytheiſm has been everywhere in the very ſame order. It is indeed impoſſible to exhibit under one general view an account of arts, manners, and religious ſentiments, which may apply to ſome certain pe</p><p>riod in the hiſtory oſ every nation, The characters and circumſtances of nations are ſcarce leſs various and anomalous than thoſe of individuals. Among many of the American tribes among the ancient inhabitants of the foreſts of Germany, whoſe manners have been ſo accurately delineated by the maſterly pen of Tacitus, and in ſome of the iſlands ſcattered over the ſouthern ocean, religion, arts, and government, have been found in that ſtate which we have deſcribed as characterizing the ſecond ſtage of focial life. But neither can we pretend that all thoſe simple and rude societies have been deſcribed by hiſtorians and travellers as agreeing preciſely in their arts, manners, and religious ſentiments ; or that the difference of circumſtances always enables us to account in a ſatisfactory manner for the diſtinction of their characters. There is a variety of acts in the hiſtory of the early periods of ſociety, which no ingenuity, no induſtry however painful, can reduce under general heads. Here, as well as when we attempt to philosophize on the phenomena of the material world, we find reaſon to confeſs that our powers are weak, and our obſervation confined within a narrow ſphere.</p><p>But we may now carry our views a little forward, and ſurvey human liſe as approaching ſomewhat nearer to a civilized and enlightened ſtate. As property is acquired, inequality and ſubordination of ranks neceſſarily follow : and when men are no longer equal, the many are ſoon subjected to the will of the few. But what gives riſe to theſe new phenomena is, that after having often ſuffered from the precariouſneſs of the hunting and fiſhing ſtate, men begin to extend their cares beyond the preſent moment, and to think of providing ſome ſupply for future wants. When they are enabled to provide ſuch a ſupply, either by purſuing tire chace with new eagerneſs and perſeverance, by gathering the ſpontaneous fruits of the earth, or by breeding tame animals—theſe acquiſitions are at firſt the property of the whole ſociety, and diſtributed from a common ſtore to each individual according to his wants : But as various reasons will ſoon concur to convince the community, that by this mode of diſtribution, induſtry and activity are treated with injuſtice, while negligence and indolence receive more than their due, each individual will in a ſhort time become his own ſteward, and a community of goods will be aboliſhed. As ſoon as diſtinct ideas of property are formed, it muſt be unequally diſtributed ; and as ſoon as property is unequally diſtributed, there ariſes an inequality of ranks. Here we have the origin oſ the depreſſion oſ the female ſex in rude ages, of the tyrannical authority exerciſed by parents over their children, and perhaps of slavery, The women cannot diſplay the ſame perſeverance, or activity, or addreſs, as the men in pursuing the chace. They are therefore left at home ; and from that moment are no longer equals, but ſlaves and dependants, who muſt ſubſiſt by the bounty of the males, and muſt therefore ſubmit with implicit obedience to all their capricious commands. Even before the era of property, the female ſex were viewed as inferiors ; but till that period they were not reduced to a ſtate of abject slavery,</p><p>In this period of ſociety new notions are formed of the relative duties. Men now become citizens, maſters, and ſervants ; husbands, parents, &amp; c. It is impoſſible to enumerate all the various modes of government which take place among the tribes who have advanced<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0578.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s04-0572"/>
to this ſtage ; but one thing certain is, that the authority of the few over the many is now firſt eſtabliſhed, and that the riſe of property firſt introduces inequality of ranks. In one place, we ſhall perhaps find the community ſubjected during this period to the will of a ſingle person ; in another, power may be lodged in the hands of a number of chiefs; and in a third, every individual may have a voice in creating public officers, and in enacting laws for the ſupport of public order. But as no code of laws is formed during this period, juſtice is not very impartially administered, nor are the rights of individuals very faithfully guarded. Many actions, which will afterwards be considered as heinously immoral, are now conſidered as praiſe-worthy or indifferent. This is the age of hero-worſhip, and of houſehold and tutelary gods; for it is in this ſtage oſ ſociety that the invention of arts, which gave rise to that worſhip, contributes moſt cotiſpicuouſly to the public good. War, too, which we conſidered as beginning firſt to ravage the earth during the former period, and which is another cauſe of the deification of dead men, will ſtill prevail in this age, and be carried on with no leſs ferocity than before, though in a mote syſtematic form.</p><p>The prevalence of war, and the means by which ſubſiſtence is procured, cannot but have conſiderable influence on the character and ſentiments of ſocieties and individuals. The hunter and the warrior are characters in many reſpects different from the ſhepherd and the husbandman. Such, in point of government, arts, and manners, religious and moral ſentiments, were ſeveral of the German tribes deſcribed by Tacitus ; and the Britons whoſe character has been ſketched by the pen of Cæsar : ſuch, too, were the Romans in the early period of their hiſtory; ſuch too the inhabitants oſ Aſia Minor about the time of the ſiege of Troy, as well as the Greeks whom Homer celebrates as the deſtroyers of the Trojan ſtate ; the northern tribes alſo, who poured thro’ Aſia, Africa, and Europe, and overthrew the Roman empire, appear to have been of a nearly similar character. lt ſeems to be a general opinion among thoſe who have directed their attention to the hiſtory of ſociety, that, in the ſcale aſccnding from the loweſt condition of human beings to the moſt civilized and enlightened ſtate of ſociety, the ſhepherd ſtate is the next in order above the hunting ; and that as mankind improve in knowledge and in moral ſentiments, and as the foreſts are gradually depopulated of their inhabitants, inſtead oſ deſtroying the inferior animals, men become their guardians and protectors. But we cannot unreſervedly ſubſcribe to this opinion : we believe, that in the ſhepherd ſtate ſocieties have been ſometimes found superior to the moſt poliſhed tribes of hunters ; but upon viewing the annals of mankind in early ages, we obſerve that there is often no inconſiderable reſemblance even between hunters and ſhepherds in point oſ the improvement of the rational faculties and the moral ſenſe ; and we are therefore led to think, that theſe two states are ſometimes parallel : for inſtance, ſeveral of the. American tribes, who ſtill procure their ſubsiſtence by hunting, appear to be nearly in the ſtate which we have deſcribed as the third ſtage in the progreſs of ſociety ; and the ancient ſhepherds of Aſia do not appear to have, been much more cultivated and refined. We even believe that men have ſometimes turned their attention from hunting to agriculture without paſſing through</p><p>any intermediate ſtate. Let us remember, that much depends upon local circumstances, and ſomewhat urn doubtedly on original inſpiration and traditionary inſtruction. In this period oſ ſociety the ſtate of the arts well deferves our attention. We ſhall find, that the shepherds and the hunters are in that reſpect on a pretty equal footing. Whether we examine the records of ancient hiſtory, or view the iſlands ſcattered through the South Sea, or range the wilds of America, or ſurvey the ſnowy waſtes of Lapland and the frozen coaſt of Greenland ſtill we find the uſeſul arts in this period, though known and cultivated, in a very rude ſtate; and the fine arts, or ſuch as are cultivated merely to pleaſe the fancy or to gratify caprice, diſplaying an odd and fantaſtic, not a true or natural, taſte ; yet this is the period in which eloquence ſhines with the trueſt luſtre : all is metaphor or glowing ſentiment. Languages are not yet copious ; and therefore ſpeech is figurative, expreſſive, and forcible. The tones and geſtures of nature, not being yet laid aside, as they generally are, from regard to decorum, in more poliſhed ages, give a degree of force and expreſſion to the harangues of the ruſtic or ſavage orator, which the molt laborious ſtudy of the rules of rhetoric and elocution could not enable even a more poliſhed orator to diſplay.</p><p>But let us advance a little farther, and contemplate our ſpecies in a new light, where they will appear with greater dignity and amiableness of character. Let us view them as husbandmen, artizans, and legiſlators. Whatever circumſtances might turn the attention of any people from hunting to agriculture, or cauſe the herdsman to yoke his oxen for the cultivation of the ground, certain it is that this change in the occupation would produce an happy change on the character and circumſtances of men ; it would oblige them to exert a more regular and perſevering induſtry. The hunter is like one of thoſe birds that are deſcribed as paſſing the winter in a torpid ſtate. The ſhepherd’s life is extremely indolent. Neither of theſe is very favourable to refinement. But different is the condition of the husbandman. His labours ſucceed each other in regular rotation through the year. Each ſeaſon with him has its proper employments : he therefore muſt exert active perſevering induſtry ; and in this ſtate we often find the virtues of rude and poliſhed ages united. This is the period where barbariſm ends and civilization begins. Nations have exiſted for ages in the hunting or the ſhepherd ſtate, fixed as by a kind of ſtagnation, without advancihg farther. But ſcarce any inſtances occur in the hiſtory of mankind of thoſe who once reached the ſtate of husbandmen, remaining long in that condition without rising to a more civilized and poliſhed ſtate. Where a people turn their attention in any considerable degree to the objects of agriculture, a diſtinction of occupations naturally ariſes among them. The husbandman is ſo cloſely employed thro’ the ſeveral ſeaſons of the year in the labours of the field, that he has no longer leiſure to exerciſe all the rude arts known among his countrymen. He has not time to ſaſhion the inſtruments of husbandry, to prepare his clothes, to build his houſe, to manufacture houſehold utensils, or to tend thoſe tame animals which he continues to rear. Thoſe different departments therefore now begin to employ different perſons ; each of whom<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0579.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s04-0573"/>
dedicates his whole time and attention to his own occupation. The manufacture of cloth is for a conſiderable time managed excluſively by the women ; but ſmiths and joiners ariſe from among the men. Metals begin now to be conſidered as valuable materials. The intercourſe of mankind is now placed on a new footing. Before, every individual practiſed all the arts that were known, as far as was neceſſary for ſupplying himſelf with the conveniences of life. Now he confines himſelf to one or to a few of them ; and, in order to obtain a neceſſary ſupply of the productions of those arts which he does not cultivate himſelf, he gives in exchange a part of the productions of his own labours. Here we have the origin of commerce.</p><p>After continuing perhaps for ſome time in this ſtate, as arts and diſtinctions multiply in ſociety, the exchange of one commodity for another is found troubleſome and inconvenient. It is ingeniouſly contrived to adopt a medium of commerce, which being eſtimated not by its intrinſic value, but by a certain nominal value which it receives from the agreement of the ſociety among whom it is uſed, ſerves to render the exchange of property, which is ſo neceſſary for the purpoſes of ſocial life, eaſy and expeditious. Wherever metals have been known, they appear to have been adopted as the medium of commerce almoſt as ſoon as ſuch a medium began to be uſed : and this is one important purpoſe for which they ſerve ; but they have ſtill more important uſes. Almoſt all the neceſſary arts depend on them. Where the metals are known, agriculture practiſed, and the neceſſary arts diſtributed among different orders of artiſans—civilization and refinement, if not obſtructed by ſome accidental circumſtances, advance with a rapid progreſs. With regard to the firſt applying of the precious metals as the medium of commerce, we may obſerve, that this was probably not accompliſhed by means of a formal contract. They might be firſt uſed as ornaments ; and the love of ornament, which prevails among rude as much as among civilized nations, would render every one willing to receive them in exchange for ſuch articles as he could ſpare. Such might be the change produced on ſociety with regard to the neceſſaiy arts by the origin of agriculture. As ſoon as ornament and amuſement are thought of, the fine arts begin to be cultivated. In their origin therefore they are not long poſterior to the neceſſary and uſeful arts. They appear long before men reach the comfortable and reſpectable condition of husbandmen ; but ſo rude is their character at their firſt origin, that our <hi rend="italic">Dilettanti</hi> would probably view their productions of that period with unſpeakable contempt and diſguft. But in the period of ſociety which we now conſider, they have aſpired to an higher character ; yet poetry is now perhaps leſs generally cultivated than during the ſhepherd ſtate. Agriculture, conſidered by itſelf, is not directly favourable either to refinement of manners or to the fine arts. The converſation of ſhepherds is generally ſuppoſed to be far more elegant thän that of husbandmen ; but though the direct and immediate effects of this condition of life be not favourable to the fine arts, yet indirectly it has a ſtrong tendency to promote their improvement. Its immediate influence is extremely favourable to the neceſſary and uſeful arts ; and theſe are no leſs favourable to the fine arts.</p><p>One of the nobleſt changes which the introduction of the arts by agriculture produces on the form and circumſtances of ſociety, is the introduction of regular government and laws. In tracing the hiſtory of ancient nations, we ſcarce ever find laws introduced at an earlier period. Minos, Solon, and Lycurgus, do not appear to have formed codes of wisdom and juſtice for regulating the manners of their countrymen, till after the Cretans, the Athenians, and even the Lacedemonians, had made ſome progreſs in agriculture and the uſeſul arts.</p><p>Religion, under all its various forms, has in every ſtage of ſociety a mighty influence on the ſentiments and conduct of men (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Religion)</hi>; and the arts cultivated in ſociety have on the other hand ſome influence on the ſyſtem of religious belief. One happy effect which will reſult from the invention of arts, though perhaps not immediately, will be, to render the character of the deities more benevolent and amiable, and the rites of their worſhip more mild and humane.</p><p>The female ſex in this period generally find the yoke of their ſlavery ſomewhat lightened. Men now become easier in their circumſtances; the ſocial affections aſſume ſtronger influence over the mind ; plenty, and ſecurity, and eaſe, at once communicate both delicacy and keen- neſs to the ſenſual deſires. All theſe circumſtances concur to make men relax in ſome degree that tyrannic ſway by which they before depressed the ſofter ſex. The foundation of that empire, where beauty triumphs over both wiſdom and ſtrength, now begins to be laid. Such are the effects which hiſtory warrants us to attribute to agriculture and the arts ; and ſuch the outlines of the character of that which we reckon the fourth ſtage in the progreſs of ſociety from rudeneſs to refinement.</p><p>Let us advance one ſtep farther. We have not yet ſurveyed mankind in their moſt poliſhed and cultivated ſtate. Society is rude at the period when the arts firſt begin to ſhow themſelves, in compariſon of that ſtate to which it is raiſed by the induſtrious cultivation of them. The neighbouring commonwealths of Athens and Lacedemon afford us a happy opportunity of comparing this with the former ſtage in the progreſs of ſociety. The chief effect produced by the inſtitutions of; Lycurgus ſeems to have been, to fix the manners of his countrymen for a conſiderable period in that ſtate to which they had attained in his days. Spartan virtue has been admired and extolled in the language of enthuſiaſm ; but in the ſame manner has the character and the condition of the ſavage inhabitants of the wilds of America, been preferred by ſome philoſophers, to the virtues and the enjoyments of ſocial life in the moſt poliſhed and enlightened ſtate. The Spartans in the days of Lycurgus had begun to cultivate the ground, and were not unacquainted with the uſeful arts. They muſt ſoon have advanced farther had not Lycurgus ariſen, and by effecting the eſtabliſhment of a code oſ laws, the tendency of which appears to have been in many particulars directly oppoſite to the deſigns of nature, retarded their progreſs towards complete civilization and refinement. The hiſtory of the Lacedemonians, therefore, while the laws of Lycurgus continued in force, exhibits the manners and character of a people in that which we have denominated the fourth ſtage in the progreſs of ſociety. But if we turn our eyes to their<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0580.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s04-0574"/>
neighbours the Athenians, we behold in their hiſtory the natural progreſs of opinions, arts, and manners. The uſeful arts are firſt cultivated with ſuch ſteady induſtry, as to raiſe the community to opulence, and to furniſh them with articles for commerce with foreign nations. The uſeful arts cannot be raiſed to this height of improvement without leading men to the purſuit of ſcience. Commerce with foreign nations, ſkill in the uſeful arts, and a taſte for ſcience, mutually aid each other, and conſpire to promote the improvement of the fine arts. Hence magnificent buildings, noble ſtatues, paintings expreſſive of life, action, and paſſion ; and poems in which imagination adds new grace and ſublimity to nature, and gives the appearances of ſocial life more irreſistible power over the affections of the heart. Hence are moral diſtinctions more carefully ſtudied, and the rights of every individual and every order in ſociety better underſtood and more accurately defined. Moral ſcience is generally the firſt ſcientiſic purſuit which strongly attracts the attention of men. Lawgivers appear before geometricians and aſtronomers. Some particular circumſtances may cauſe theſe ſciences to be cultivated at a very early period. In Egypt the overflowing of the Nile cauſed geometry to be early cultivated. Cauſes no leſs favourable to the ſtudy of aſtronomy; concurred to recommend that ſcience to the attention of the Chaldeans long before they had attained the height of refinement. But, in general, we find, that the laws of morality are underſtood, and the principles of morals inquired into, before men make any conſiderable progreſs in phyſical ſcience, or even proſecute it with any degree of keenneſs. Accordingly, when we view the ſtate of literature in this period (for it is now become an object of ſo much importance as to force itſelf on our attention), we perceive that poetry, hiſtory, and morals, are the branches chiefly cultivated. Arts are generally caſual inventions, and long practiſed before rules and principles on which they are founded assume the form of ſcience. But morality, if considered as an art, is that art which men have ſooneſt and moſt conſtantly occaſion to practiſe. Beſides, we are ſo conſtituted by the wiſdom of nature, that human actions, and the events which befal human beings, have more powerful influence than any other object to engage and fix our attention. Hence we are enabled to explain why morality, and thoſe branches of literature more immediately connected with it, are almoſt always cultivated in preference to phyſical ſcience. Though poetry, hiſtory, and morals, be puiſued with no ſmall eagerneſs and ſucceſs in that period of fociety which we now conſider, we need not therefore be greatly ſurpriſed that natural philoſophy is neither very generally nor very ſucceſsfully cultivated. Were we to conſider each particular in that happy change which is now produced on the circumſtances of mankind, we ſhould be led into a too minute and perhaps unimportant detail. This is the period when human virtue and human abilities ſhine with moſt ſplendour. Rudeneſs, ferocity, and barbariſm, are now banished. Luxury has made her appearance ; but as yet ſhe is the friend and the benefactreſs of ſociety. Commerce has ſtimulated and rewarded induſtry, but has not yet contracted the heart and debaſed the character. Wealth is not yet become the ſole object of pursuit. The charms of ſocial intercourſe are known and reliſhed ; but domeſtic duties are not yet deſerted</p><p>for public amuſements. The female ſex acquire new influence, and contribute much to refine and poliſh the manners of their lords. Religion now affumes a milder and more pleaſing form ; ſplendid rites, magnificent temples, pompous ſacriſices, and gay feſtivals, give even ſuperſtition an influence favourable to the happineſs of mankind. The gloomy notions and barbarous rites of former periods fall into diſuſe. The ſyſtem of theology produced in formel ages ſtill remains : but only the mild and amiable qualities of the deities are celebrated ; and none but the gay, humane, and laughing divinities, are worſhipped. Philoſophy alſo teaches men to diſcard ſuch parts of their religion as are unfriendly to good morals, and have any tendency to call forth or cheriſh unſocial ſentiments in the heart. War (for in this period of ſociety enough of cauſes will ariſe to arm one nation againſt another)—war, however, no longer retains its former ferocity ; nations no longer ſtrive to extirpate one another ; to procure redress for real or imaginary injuries ; to humble, not to deſtroy, is now its object. Priſoners are no longer murdered in cold blood, ſubjected to horrid and excruciating tortures, or condemned to hopeleſs ſlavery. They are ranſomed or exchanged ; they return to their country, and again ſight under its banners. In this period the arts of government are likewiſe better underſtood, and practiſed ſo as to contribute moſt to the intereſts of ſociety. Whether monarchy, or democracy, or ariſtocracy, be the eſtabliſhed form, the rights of individuals and of ſociety are in general reſpected. The intereſts of ſociety are ſo well underſtood, that the few, in order to preſerve their influence over the many, find it necessary to act rather as the faithful ſervants than the imperious lords of the public. Though the liberties of a nation in this ſtate be not accurately defined by law, nor their property guaranteed to them by any legal inſtitutions, yet their governors dare not violate their liberties, nor deprive them wantonly of their properties. This is truly the golden age of ſociety : every trace of barbariſm is entirely effaced ; and vicious luxury has not yet begun to ſap the virtue and the happineſs of the community. Men live not in liſtleſs indolence ; but the induſtry in which they are engaged is not of ſuch a nature as to overpower their ſtrength or exhauſt their ſpirits. The ſocial affections have now the ſtrongeſt influence on mens ſentiments and conduct.</p><p>But human affairs are ſcarce ever ſtationary. The circumstances of mankind are almoſt always changing, either growing better or worſe. Their manners are ever in the ſame fluctuating ſtate. They either advance towards perfection or degenerate. Scarce have they attained that happy period in which we have juſt contemplated them, when they begin to decline till they perhaps fall back into a ſtate nearly as low as that from which we suppoſe them to have emerged. Inſtances of this unhappy degeneracy occur more than once in the hiſtory of mankind ; and we may finiſh this ſhort ſketch of the hiſtory of ſociety by mentioning in what manner this degeneracy takes place. Perhaps, ſtrictly ſpeaking, every thing but the simple neceſſaries of life may be denominated luxury : For a long time, however, the welfare of ſociety is beſt promoted, while its members aspire after ſomething more than the mere necessaries of life. As long as theſe ſuperfluitſes are to be obtained only by active and honeſt exertion ; as long<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0581.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s04-0575"/>
as they only engage the leiſure hours, without becoming the chief objects of purſuit—the employment which they give to the faculties is favourable both to the virtue and the happineſs of the human race.</p><p>The period arrives, however, when luxury is no longer ſerviceable to the intereſts of nations ; when ſhe is no longer a graceful, elegant, active form, but a languid, overgrown, and bloated carcaſe. It is the love of luxury, which contributed ſo much to the civilization of ſociety, that now brings on its decline. Arts are cultivated and improved, and commerce extended, till enormous opulence be acquired : the effect of opulence is to awake the fancy, to conceive ideas of new and capricious wants, and to inflame the breaſt with new deſires. Here we have the origin of that ſelfiſhneſs which, operating in conjunction with caprice and the violence of unbridled paſſions, contributes ſo much to the corruption of virtuous manners. Selfiſhneſs, caprice, indolence, effeminacy, all join to looſen the bonds of ſociety, to bring on the degeneracy both of the uſeful and the fine arts, to baniſh at once the mild and the auſtere virtues, to deſtroy civil order and ſubordination, and to introduce in their room anarchy or deſpotiſm.</p><p>Scarce could we have found an example oſ the beautiful form of ſociety which we laſt attempted to deſcribe. Never, at leaſt, has any nation continued long to enjoy ſuch happy circumſtances, or to diſplay ſo amiable and reſpectable a character. But when we ſpeak of the declining ſtate of ſociety, we have no difficulty in finding inſtances to which we may refer. Hiſtory tells of the Affyrians, the Egyptians, and the Persians, all of them once flouriſhing nations, but brought low by luxury and an unhappy corruption of manners. The Greeks, the Romans, and the Arabians, owed their fall to the ſame cauſes ; and we know not if a ſimilar fate does not now threaten many of thoſe nations who have long made a diſtinguiſhed figure in the ſyſtem of Europe. The Portngueſe, the Venetians, and the Spaniards, have already fallen ; and what is the preſent ſtate of our neighbours the French ? They have long been a people deſtitute of religion, corrupted in morals, unſteady in conduct, and ſlaves to pleaſure and public amuſements. Among them luxury had arrived at its higheſt pitch ; and the conſequence has been, that after capriciouſly ſhaking off the yoke of deſpotiſm, they have eſtabliſhed, or rather ſet up (for eſtabliſhed it cannot be), a motely kind of government, which, in the courſe of a few years, has exhibited ſcenes of tyranny and oppreſſion, to which we doubt if the annals of the world can furniſh any parallel. Yet this is the people whoſe manners the other nations of Europe were ambitious to imitate. May thoſe nations take warning in time, and avoid the rocks upon which they have ſplit.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Thus</hi> have we viewed the ſeveral ſtages in which ſociety appears in its progreſs from rudeneſs to refinement and decay. The intelligent reader will perceive, that the various and anomalous phenomena which occur in the natural hiſtory of ſociety, cannot easily be solved ; becauſe the neceſſary information cannot be obtained. Others have been well accounted for by the reſearches of curious philoſophical inquirers. Local circumſtances, the influence of climate, the intercourſe of nations in different ſtates of civilization, have been taken notice of, as cauſes ſerving to accelerate or retard</p><p>the progreſs of arts and manners. But our proper busineſs here was merely to mark the gradations between barbariſm and refinement : and as the painter who is to exhibit a ſeries of portraits repreſenting the human form in infancy, puerility, youth, and manhood, will not think of delineating all that variety of figures and faces which each of thoſe periods of life affords, and will find himſelf unable to repreſent in any ſingle figure all diverſities of form and features ; ſo we have not once thought of deſcribing particularly under this article, all the various national characters reducible to any one of thoſe divisions under which we have viewed the progreſs of ſociety, nor have found it poſſible to comprehend under one conſiſtent view, all the particulars which may be gathered from the remains of antiquity, from the relations of later travellers, and the general records of hiſtory concerning the progreſſive character of mankind in various regions, and under the influence of various accidents and circumſtances. This indeed would have even been improper, as all that information appears under other articles in this Work.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
