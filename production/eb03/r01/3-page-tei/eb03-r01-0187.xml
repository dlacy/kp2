All verfailles was fpeedily in an uproar. M. Neckar had repeatedly folicited his diſmiſſion, and the report of this had increaſed the po-pular clamour. The court was in conſternation. The king probably diſcovered, with no great fatisfaction, that his miniſter was more popular than himſelf. At fix o’clock in the evening the queen fent for M. Nec-kar. when he returned from the palace, he affined the crowd that waited for him that he would not abandon them ; upon which they retired ſatisſied. At the ſame time the news of the royal ſeſſion had thrown the city of Paris into violent agitation. The peace of that ca-pital was at this time endangered by a variety of cauſes. A dreadful famine raged through the land, which in a great city is uſually moſt ſeverely felt. This prepared the minds of men for receiving unfavourable impreſ-fions of their political ſtate. Every effort was more-over made to diſorganize the government, and produce a diſlike to the ancient order of things. The preſs poured forth innumerable publications, filled with new and feducing, though generally impracticable, theories of liberty. Theſe were diſtributed^r«/z'j· among the bulk of the people of Paris, and diſperſed in the fame manner through the provinces. Philip duke of Ογ-leans (preſumptive heir to the crown failing the children and brothers of the king) is with good reaſon believed to have ſupplied this expence out of his more than royal revenues. In the gardens of the Palais Royale at Paris, which belonged to him, an immenſe multitude was daily aſſembled, liſtening from morning to night to orators who deſcanted upon the moſt violent ſubjects of popular politics. Many of theſe orators were fuſpected to be in his pay. It was even believed that his money found its way into the pockets of ſome of the moſt diſtinguiſhed leaders in the national aſſem-bly.</p><p>But the government was, if poſſible, ſtill more dan-gerouſly aſſaulted by the methods now generally uſed to ſeduce the military. Every officer of the French army belonged to the order of the nobles ; and from that quarter, therefore, it might have been imagined that there was little danger. But this very circumſtance became the means of diforganizing that great engine of deſpotiſm. As the ſoldiers could not avoid imbibing ſome of the new opinions, their own officers became the firſt objects of their jealouſy ; eſpecially in conſequence of that impolitic edict of Louis XVI. which required every officer to produce proofs of four degrees of nobi-Iity ; and thus inſulted, by avowedly excluding the pri-vate men from promotion. Perhaps with a view to what might happen, the inſtructions to the deputies of the <hi rend="italic">tiers eta(</hi>  had recommended an increaſe of the p y of the ſoldiers. And now at Paris every art was uſed to gain them to the popular cauſe. They were con-ducted to the Palais Royal, and were there careſſed and flattered by the populace, while they liſtened to the po-pular harangues. Theſe arts were ſucceſsful. Οη the 23d of June they firſt refuſed to fire on the mob in a riot. Some of them were on the 30th reported to be</p><p>in confinement for this offence ; a crowd inſtantly col-lected, and reſcued them, the dragoons that were brought to ſupprefs the tumult grounding their arms : a deputation of the citizens folicited of the aſſembly the pardon of the priſoners. The aſſembly applied to the king, who pardoned them accordingly.</p><p>All theſe events, together with the tumultuous ſtate of the capital, which was daily increafing, made it neceſſary for the king to call out the military force to reſtore, if poſſible, the public peace. 'Γhat his intentions were pure, the then ſtate of affairs will permit no man but a democrate to doubt ; but the ariſtocracy, with the Count d’Artois at their head, were bringing forward other meaſures, which ultimately contributed to the ruin of themſelves, the king, and the kingdom. Crowds of ſoldiers were collected from all parts of the kingdom around Paris and verfailles. It was obſerved,</p><p>. that theſe confiſted chiefly of foreign mercenaries. Camps were traced out. Marſhal Broglio, a tried ve-teran, was ſent for and placed at the head of the army. The king was ſuppoſed to have entirely yielded to new counſels, and every thing bore the appearance of a deſperate effort to reſtore the energy of the ancient government. This is the moſt important period of the French revolution ; yet the ſpecific deſigns oſ the leading actors have never been clearly underſtood. It was rumoured at the time, that Paris was to be ſubdued by a liege and bombardment ; that the aſſembly was to be diſſolved, and its leaders put to death. Theſe are in</p><p>credible exaggerations ; but the criſis of French liberty was univerſally regarded as at hand, and alſo the exiſtence of the national aſſembly as an independent body ; or at leaſt upon any other footing than that propoſed by the king on the 23d of June.</p><p>An able and eloquent addreſs to the king againſt the aſſemblage of foreign troops in their neighbourhood was brought forward by Mirabeau, and voted by the aſſembly. The king properly replied, that the ſtate of the capital was the cauſe of aſſembling the troops, and offered to transfer the ſtates-general to Noyons or Soiſ-fons. " we will neither remove (exclaimed Mirabeau) to Noyons· nor to Soiſſons ; we will not place ourſelves between two hoſtile armies, that which is beſieging Pa-ris and that which may fall upon us from Flanders or Alſace ; we have not aſked permiſſion to run away from the troops ; we have defined that the troops-ſhould be ‘ removed from the capital.”</p><p>Ί hirty-five thouland men were now ſtationed in the neighbourhood of Paris and verfailles. The poſts were occupied which commanded the city, and camps were marked out for a greater force. The Count d’Artois and his party regarded their plans as ripe for execu-tion ; and M. Neckar received a letter from the king, requiring him to quit the kingdom in 24 hours. That popular (a) miniſter took the route of Bruſſels on the following day, when his departure was made public. In his diſmiffion the popular, or as it was now called the <hi rend="italic">democratic,</hi>  party thought they faw the refolution ■ adopted to accompliſh their ruin. The affembly again addrefled the throne ; they requeſted anew the removal</p><lb/><p><hi rend="smallcaps">(a)</hi>  Popular he certainly was ; but he either had not fortitude and talents to execute his own plans, or acted a bafe part .to. his amiable maſter.
