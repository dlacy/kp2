            <p>This was long ago recognized by Schweglcr (see his <hi rend="italic">Romische
                    Geschichte,</hi> passim) on the sufficient ground of the great
                religious cleavage between the two orders. Such jealousy of mutual contact in
                religious matters as is apparent all through the history of the city very rarely, if
                ever, springs from any other source than a real difference of race. This point was
                developed by Professor W. Ridgeway in his <hi rend="italic">Who were the
                    Romans?</hi> (London, 1908), where he points out (a) that the deities tended by
                the three greater or patrician flamens, namely, Dialis, Martialis, Quirinalis, were
                all closely connected with the Sabines; <hi rend="italic">(b) </hi>further, that the
                patrician form of marriage, the highly religious ceremony called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Conjarreatio,</hi> differed entirely from the other forms, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Usus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Coemptio,</hi> which there is reason to
                attribute to a plebeian origin; (c) that the arms, especially the round shield,
                carried by the first class in the originally military constitution of Servius
                Tullius (sec below), arc characteristic of the warriors of Central Europe in the
                Early Iron and Bronze Age, whereas those of the remaining classes can be shown to
                have been in general use during the immediately preceding period in the
                Mediterranean lands.</p>
            <p>For other archaeological evidence separating the patricians from the plebeians, and
                connecting the patricians closely with the Sabines the reader must be referred to
                Ridgeway’s essay. It is, however, well to make special mention here of the
                tradition, which is given by Livy (ii. 16. 4), and is undated but not the
                less probable for being a non-annalistic tradition, preserved in the <hi
                    rend="italic">gens</hi> itself, of the prompt welcome given to the Sabine
                Appius Claudius, the founder of the haughtiest of all the Roman noble families, by
                the patricians of Rome and his immediate admission to all their political
                privileges. Ridgeway points out that this implies, at that early time, a substantial
                identity of race.</p>
            <p>On the linguistic side of the question it is well to mention for clearness’ sake that
                this Safine or patrician class marked its ascendancy all over Central and Southern
                Italy, from the 6th century b.c. onwards, by its preference for forming ethnic names
                with the suffix <hi rend="italic">-no-</hi> which it frequently imposed also upon
                the communities whom it brought under its influence. <hi rend="italic">Sabini</hi>
                (earlier <hi rend="italic">Safini), Romani, Latini, Sidicini,
                    Aricini, Marrucini,</hi> and the like are all names formed in this way
                (see further Sabini).</p>
            <p>2.    It may also now be regarded as certain that what we may call the Lower or
                Earlier Stratum (or Strata) of population in Rome, themselves spoke a language which
                was as truly Indo-European as the language of their Safine conquerors. In
                the article Volsci will be found evidence for the conclusion that the language of
                what has been there entitled the Co-Folk was not less certainly Indo-European, and
                in some respects probably a less modified form of Indo-European, than that of the
                Safincs. A number of the names formed with the <hi rend="italic">-co-</hi> suffix
                and with the <hi rend="italic">-ati-</hi> suffix (which is frequent in the same
                districts) contain unmistakably Indo-European words such as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Graviscae, Marica, dea Marica, Volsci, Casinates, Soracte, Interamnites,
                    Auxumates. </hi>The fusion of this earlier population with the patricians is
                far easier to imagine when it is recognized that the two parties spoke kindred
                though by no means identical languages. It is the essentially Indo-European
                character of the early inhabitants of the Latin plain which has led many scholars to
                doubt that there was any racial distinction at all between patricians and plebeians,
                but the increase of knowledge of the dialects spoken in the different regions of
                Italy has now enabled us to judge this question with very much fuller evidence.</p>
            <p>3.    There arises, however, the important question or questions as to the origin, or
                at least the ethnic connexions of this earlier stratum. The task of the historic
                inquirer will not be completely performed until at least some further progress has
                been made in connecting this earlier population of the western coast of Italy, on
                the one hand, with one or more of the early races (see Siculi, Veneti, Liguria,
                Pelasgians) whom tradition declares to have once inhabited the soil of Latium; and
                on the other, with the people or peoples whom archaeological research reveals to us
                as having left behind them different strata of remains, all earlier than the Iron or
                Roman Age, both in</p>
            <p>Latium and in other parts of Italy. Professor Ridgeway has taken a short way with
                these problems which may prove to be the true one; he classes together as Ligurian
                all prc-Safine inhabitants of Italy save such elements as, like the Etruscans, can
                be shown to have invaded it over sea (see Etruria, <hi rend="italic">§
                    Language).</hi> This is one of the most promising fields of investigation now
                open to scholars, but in view of the confused and mutilated shape in which the
                traditions current in ancient times have come down to us, it demands an exceedingly
                careful scrutiny of the archaeological and the linguistic evidence, and exceedingly
                cautious judgment in combining them. The point of outstanding importance is to
                determine whether the earb’er Indo-European population is to be regarded as having
                been in Italy from the beginning of human habitation. Archaeologists generally like
                W. Helbig <hi rend="italic">(Die Italiker der Poebene)</hi> and more recently B.
                Modestov <hi rend="italic">(Introduction &amp; I’histoire romaine, </hi>Paris, 1907)
                have been inclined to regard the Ligurians as the most primitive population of
                Italy, but to distinguish them sharply from the people who built the Lake Settlement
                and Pile Dwellings, which appear (with important variations of type):—(1) in the
                western half of the valley of the Po; (2) in the eastern half of the same; (3) in
                Picenum; (4) in Latium; and (5) as far south as Tarentum. One of the most
                important points in the identification is the question of the method of burial
                employed at different epochs by the different communities. (See the works already
                cited, with that of O. Montelius, <hi rend="italic">La Civilisation primitive en
                    Italie.)</hi></p>
            <p>The <hi rend="italic">populus Romanns</hi> was, we are told, divided into three
                tribes, Ramnes, Tities and Luceres,@@ and into thirty curiae. The three names, as
                Schulze has shown <hi rend="italic">(Lat. Eigennamen,</hi> p. 580), are neither more
                nor less than the names of three Etruscan <hi rend="italic">gentes</hi> (whether or
                not derived from Safine or Latin originals), and the tradition is a striking result
                of the Etruscan domination in the 6th century b.c.<hi rend="smallcaps">@@</hi> which
                we shall shortly consider.</p>
            <p>Of far greater importance is the division into <hi rend="italic">curiae.</hi> In
                Cicero’s time there were still curies, curial festivals and curiate assemblies, and
                modern authors are unquestionably right in regarding the curia as the keystone of
                the primitive political system. It was a primitive association held together by
                participation in common <hi rend="italic">sacra,</hi> and possessing common
                festivals, common priests and a common chapel, hall and hearth. As separate
                associations the curiae were probably older than the Roman state, but,@@however this
                may be, it is certain that of this state when formed they constituted the only
                effective political subdivisions. The members of the thirty curiae form the<hi
                    rend="italic">populus Romanns,</hi> and the earliest known condition of Roman
                citizenship is the <hi rend="italic">communio sacrorum,</hi> partnership in the
                curial <hi rend="italic">sacra.</hi> Below the curia there was no further political
                division, for there is no reason to believe that the curia was ever formally
                subdivided into a fixed number of <hi rend="italic">gentes </hi>and families.@@</p>
            <p>At their head was the <hi rend="italic">rex,</hi> the ruler of the united people. The
                Roman “ king ” is not simply either the hereditary and patriarchal chief of a clan,
                the priestly head of a community bound together by common <hi rend="italic"
                    >sacra,</hi> but the elected magistrate of a state, but a mixture of all
                three.@@5 In</p>
            <p>@@@The tradition connecting the Ramnes with Romulus and the Tities with Tatius is as
                old as Ennius (Varro,<hi rend="italic">L.L.</hi> v. 55). The best authorities on the
                question, earlier than Schulze’s epoch-making treatise, are Schwegler i. 505, and
                Volquardsen, <hi rend="italic">Rhein. Mus. </hi>xxxiii. 538.</p>
            <p>@@@ They are traditionally connected only with the senateof 300 <hi rend="italic"
                    >patres,</hi> with the primitive legion of 3000, with the vestal virgins,
                and with the augurs (Varro, <hi rend="italic">L.L.</hi> v. 81, 89, 91; Livy x. 6;
                Festus 344; Mommsen i. 41, 74, 75; Genz, <hi rend="italic">Patncisch. Rom,</hi>
                90).</p>
            <p>@@@It is possible that, the curiae were originally connected with separate
                localities; cf. such names as Foriensis, Veliensis (Fest. 174; Gilbert i. 213).</p>
            <p>@@@Niebuhr’s supposition of ten<hi rend="italic">gentes</hi> in each curia has
                nothing in. its favour but the confused statement of Dionysius as to the
