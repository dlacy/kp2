His experiments to this purpoſe were made with balls a very little heavier than water, ſo as to deſcend very flowly ; and they were made with his uſual care and accuracy, and may be depended on.</p><p>In thc expcriments made with bodies floating on the ſurface of water, there is an addition to the reſiſtance ariſing from the inertia of the water. The water heaps up a little on the anterior ſurface of the floating body, and is depreffed behind it. Hence ariſes a hydroſtatical preffure, acting in concert with the true reſiſtance. A ſimilar thing is obſerved in the reſiſtance of air, which is condenſed before the body and rarefied behind it, and thus an additional refiſtance is produced by. the unbalanced elaſticity of the air ; and alſo becauſe the air, which is <hi rend="italic">actually</hi>  diſplaced, is denſer than common air. Theſe circumſtances cauſe the refiſtances to increaſe faſter than the ſquares of the velocities : but, even independent of this, there is an additional refiſtance arifing from the tendency to rarefaction behind a very ſwift body ; becaufe the preffure of the ſurrounding fluid can only make the ſiuid fill the ſpace left with a determined velocity.</p><p>we have had occaſion to ſpeak of this circumſtance more particularly under Gunnery and Pneumatics, when co.nſidering very rapid motions. Mr Robins had remarked that the velocity at which the obſerved reſiſtance of the air began to increaſe ſo prodigioufly, was that of about noo or 1200 feet per ſecond, and that this was the velocity with which air would-ruſh into a void. He concluded, that when the velocity was great-er than this, the ball was expofed to the additional re-fiſtance ariſing from the unbalanced ſtatical preffure of the air, and that this conſtant quantity behoved to be added to the reſiſtance ariſing from the air's inertia in all greater velocities. This is very reaſonable : But he imagined that in ſmaller velocities there was no ſuch unbalanced preffure. But this cannot be the caſe : for although in ſmaller velocities the air will ftill fill up the fpace behind the body, it will not fill it up .with air of the fâme denſity. This would be to ſuppoſe the motion of the air into the deſerted place to be inſtantane-ous. There muſt therefore be a rarefaction behind the body, and a preffure backward ; ariſing from unbalan-ced elafticity, independent of the condenſation on the anterior part. The condenſation and rarefaction are cauſed by the ſame thing, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi>  the limited elafticity of the air. were this infinitely great, the ſmalleſt ∙conden-fation before the body would be inſtantly diffuſed over the whole air, and ſo would the rarefaction, ſo that no preffure of unbalanced elaſticity would be obſerved; but the elaſticity is fuch as to propagate the condenfation with the velocity of found only, z. <hi rend="italic">e.</hi>  the velocity of 1142 feet per ſecond. Therefore this additional re-ſiſtance does not commence preciſely at this velocity, but is ſenſible in all ſmaller velocities, as is very juſtly obſerved by Euler. But we are not yet able to aſcer-tain the law of its increaſe, although it is a problem which ſeems ſuſceptible of a tolerably accurate ſolu-tion.</p><p>Preciſely fimilar to this is the reſiſtance to the mo-tion of floating bodies, ariſing from the accumulation or gorging up of the water on their anterior furface, and its depreſſion behind them, were the gravity of the water infinite, while its inertia remains the fame, the wave raiſed up at the prow of a ſhip would be inſtantly diſſuſed over the whole ocean, and it would therefore be infinitely ſmall, as alſo the depreſſion be-hind the poop. But this wave requires time for its diſſufion ; and while it is not diſſuſed, it acts byſhydrofe-tieal preſſure. AVe are equally unable to alcertain the law of variation of this part of the reſiſtance, the me-chaniſm of waves being but very imperfectly under-ſtood. The height of the wave in the experiments of the French academy could not be meaſured with ſuffi-cient preciſion (being only obſerved <hi rend="italic">en pafiant)</hi>  tor afcertaining its relation to the velocity. The Chev. Buat attempted it in his experiments, butwithoutſucceſs. Thia muſt evidently make a part of the reſiſtance in all velo-cities : and it ſtill remains an undecided queſtion, "what relation it bears to the velocities?” when the ſolid body is wholly buried in the ſiuid, this accumulation doea not take place, or at leaſt not in the ſame way : It</p><p>may, however, be obſerved. Every perſon may recol-lect, that in a very ſwift running ſtream a large ſtone at the bottom will produce a ſmall ſwell above it ; un-leſs it lies very deep, a nice eye may ſtill obſerve it. The water, on arriving at the obſtacle, glides paſt it in every direction, and is deflected on all hands; and therefore what paſſes over it is alſo deflected upwards, and cauſes the water over it to riſe above its level. The nearer that the body is to the ſurface, the greater will be the perpendicular riſe of the water, but it will be leſs diſſuſed; and it is uncertain whether the <hi rend="italic">whole</hi>  elevation will be greater or leſs. By the whole elevation we mean the area of a perpendicular ſection of the ele-vation by a plane perpendicular to the direction of the ſtream. we are rather diſpoſed to think that this area will be greateſt when the body is near the ſurface. D’Ulloa has attempted to conſider this ſubject ſcienti-fically ; and is of a very different opinion, which he confirms by the ſingle experiment to he mentioned by and by. Mean time, it is evident, that if the water which glides paſt the body cannot fall in behind it with ſuſſicient velocity for filling up the ſpace behind, there muſt be a void there ; and thus a hydroſtatical preſſure muſt be ſuperadded to the reſiſtance ariſing from the inertia of the water. All muſt have obſerved, that if the end of a ſtick held in the hand be drawn ſlowly through the water, the water will fill the place left by the ſtick, and there will be no curled wave : but .if the motion be very rapid, a hollow trough or gutter is left behind, and is not ſilled up till at ſome diſtance from the ſtick, and the wave which forms its fides is very much broken and curled. The writer of this article has often looked into the water from the poop of a ſecond rate man of war when ſhe was failing 11 miles per hour, which is a velocity of 16 feet per ſecond nearly ; and he not only obſerved that the back of the rudder was naked for about two feet below the load water-line, but alſo that the trough or wake made by the ſhip was filled up with water which was broken and foaming to a conſiderable depth, and to a confiderable diſtance from the veſſel: There muſt therefore have been</p></body></text></TEI>
