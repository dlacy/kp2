<p><span class="font1">it is perhaps permissible to suspect that he hankered for the principality of Tripoli and the renewal of hostilities with&nbsp;Bohemund. As at Antioch, so at Jerusalem, he fell into strife&nbsp;with the new ruler; and it was only with difficulty that Godfrey&nbsp;was able to secure from him the possession of the Tower of&nbsp;David, which he had originally occupied. The grasping nature&nbsp;of Raymund again appeared after the battle of Ascalon, when&nbsp;his eagerness to occupy Ascalon for himself prevented it from&nbsp;being occupied at all; while Godfrey also blamed him for the&nbsp;failure of his army to capture Arsuf. It almost seems as if the&nbsp;count could not appear without becoming a centre of storms;&nbsp;and when he went north, in the winter of 1099-1100, his first&nbsp;act was one of hostility against Bohemund, from whom he&nbsp;helped to wrest Laodicea. From Laodicea he went to Constantinople, where he fraternized with Alexius, the great enemy&nbsp;of his own enemy Bohemund. Joining in the ill-fated Crusade&nbsp;which followed in the wake of the First, he was successful in&nbsp;escaping from the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">débâcle,</span><span class="font1"> and returning to Constantinople. In&nbsp;1102 he came by sea from Constantinople to Antioch, where he&nbsp;was imprisoned by Tancred, regent of Antioch during the captivity of Bohemund, and only dismissed upon promising not&nbsp;to attempt any conquests in the country between Antioch and&nbsp;Acre. He broke his promise, attacking and capturing Tortosa,&nbsp;and beginning to build a castle for the reduction of Tripoli (on&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mons Peregrinus</span><span class="font1">)</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">.</span><span class="font1"> In this policy he was aided by Alexius,&nbsp;who was naturally willing to see the erection of a tributary&nbsp;county of Tripoli to the south of Bohemund’s principality. In&nbsp;1105 Raymund died. He was succeeded by his nephew William,&nbsp;who in 1109, with the aid of Baldwin I., captured the town&nbsp;and definitely established the county of Tripoli. William was&nbsp;ousted in the same year by Raymund’s eldest son Bertrand;&nbsp;and the county continued in the possession of his house during&nbsp;the 12th century.@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Raymund of Toulouse represents the Provençal element in the first Crusade, as Bohemund represents the Norman, and&nbsp;Godfrey and Baldwin the Lotharingian. Religiosity, obstinacy&nbsp;and greed seem curiously blended in his composition. The first&nbsp;quality appears in the episode of the Lance, and in his renuncia-tion of the advocacy of Jerusalem: the second appears in the&nbsp;whole of his attitude to Bohemund: the third appears again&nbsp;and again, whenever the progress of the Crusades brought any&nbsp;new conquest. If in temperament he is the least attractive&nbsp;among the princes of the first Crusade, he was yet one of its&nbsp;foremost leaders, and he left his mark upon history in the&nbsp;foundation of the county of Tripoli.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Raymund of Agiles, a clerk in the Provençal army, gives the history of the first Crusade from his master’s point of view. For&nbsp;a modem account of Count Raymund’s part in the crusading&nbsp;movement, one may refer to Röhricht’s works (see Crusades).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(E. Br.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RAYMUND OF TRIPOLI, the most famous of the descendants of Raymund of Toulouse, was a great-grandson of his eldest son&nbsp;Bertrand: his mother was Hodierna, a daughter of Baldwin II.,&nbsp;and through her he was closely connected with the kings of&nbsp;Jerusalem. He became count of Tripoli in 1152, on the&nbsp;assassination of his father. In 1164 he was captured by Nur-eddin, and was only released in 1172 after a captivity of eight&nbsp;years. In 1174 he claimed the regency on behalf of Baldwin IV.&nbsp;(at once a minor and a leper), in virtue of his close relationship;&nbsp;and the claim was acknowledged. After two years the regency&nbsp;seems to have passed to Reginald of Châtillon; but Raymund,&nbsp;who had married the heiress of the county of Tiberias, continued&nbsp;to figure in the affairs of the kingdom. His great ability procured him enemies; for two years, 1180-1182, Baldwin IV. was&nbsp;induced by evil advisers to exclude him from his territories.&nbsp;But as Saladin grew more threatening, Raymund grew more&nbsp;indispensable; and in 1184 he became regent for Baldwin V.,&nbsp;on condition that, if the king died before his majority, his&nbsp;successor should be determined by the great powers of the West.&nbsp;Raymund conducted the regency with skill, securing a truce from</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">Saladin in 1185; but when Baldwin V. died, in 1186, all went wrong. Raymund summoned an assembly of the barons to&nbsp;Naplous to deliberate on the situation; but while they deliberated, the supporters of Guy de Lusignan (the husband of Baldwin&nbsp;IV.'s sister, Sibylla) acted, and had him crowned, in defiance&nbsp;of the stipulation under which Raymund had become regent.&nbsp;The rest of the barons came over to Guy; and Raymund, left in&nbsp;isolation, retired to Tiberias and negotiated a truce for himself&nbsp;with Saladĩn. His ambiguous position led contemporaries to&nbsp;accuse him of treasonable correspondence with Saladin; but his&nbsp;loyalty to the Christian cause was nobly shown in 1187, when&nbsp;he reconciled himself to Guy, and aided him in the battle of&nbsp;Hattin, which was engaged, however, ĩn the teeth of his earnest&nbsp;advice. He escaped from the battle wounded, and ultimately&nbsp;retired to Tripoli, where he died (1187).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the corrupt society of the latter days of the kingdom of Jerusalem, Raymund showed himself at least as disinterested as&nbsp;any other man, and certainly more capable than the rest of his&nbsp;contemporaries. He might have saved Jerusalem, if Jerusalem&nbsp;could have been saved; but his was the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">vox clamantis in deserto.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">“He is worthy of the throne,&quot; wrote a contemporary Arabic&nbsp;chronicler: “ he seems destined for it by nature, who has given&nbsp;him pre-eminent wisdom and courage.’’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(E. Br.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RAYNAL, GUILLAUME THOMAS FRANÇOIS (1713-1796), French writer, was born at Saint-Geniez in Rouergue on the&nbsp;12th of April 1713. He was educated at the Jesuit school of&nbsp;Pézenas, and received priest’s orders, but he was dismissed for&nbsp;unexplained reasons from the parish of Saint-Sulpice, Paris,&nbsp;to which he was attached, and thenceforward he devoted&nbsp;himself to society and literature. The Abbé Raynal wrote for&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mercure de France,</span><span class="font1"> and compiled a series of popular but&nbsp;superficial works, which he published and sold himself. These—&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">L'Histoire du stathoudérat</span><span class="font1"> (The Hague, 1748), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">L'Histoire du&nbsp;parlement d’Angleterre</span><span class="font1"> (London, 1748), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Anecdotes historiques&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(Amsterdam, 3 vols., 1753)—gained for him access to the salons&nbsp;of Mme. Geoffrin, Helvétius, and the baron d’Holbach. He had&nbsp;the assistance of various members of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">philosophe</span><span class="font1"> coteries in&nbsp;his most important work, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">L’Histoire philosophique et politique&nbsp;des établissements et du commerce des Européens dans les deux&nbsp;Indes</span><span class="font1"> (Amsterdam, 4 vols., 1770). Diderot indeed is credited&nbsp;with a third of this work, which was characterized by Voltaire&nbsp;as “ du réchauffe avec de la declamation.” The other chief&nbsp;collaborators were Pechméja, Holbach, Paulze, the farmer-general of taxes, the Abbé Martin, and Alexandre Deleyre. To&nbsp;this piecemeal method of composition, in which narrative&nbsp;alternated with tirades on political and social questions, was&nbsp;added the further disadvantage of the lack of exact information,&nbsp;which, owing to the dearth of documents, could only have been&nbsp;gained by personal investigation. The “philosophic’’ decla-mations perhaps constituted its chief interest for the general&nbsp;public, and its significance as a contribution to democratic&nbsp;propaganda. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Histoire</span><span class="font1"> went through many editions, being&nbsp;revised and augmented from time to time by Raynal; it was&nbsp;translated into the principal European languages, and appeared&nbsp;in various abridgments. Its introduction into France was&nbsp;forbidden in 1779; the book was burned by the public executioner, and an order was given for the arrest of the author, whose&nbsp;name had not appeared in the first edition, but was printed on&nbsp;the title page of the Geneva edition of 1780. Raynal escaped&nbsp;to Spa, and thence to Berlin, where he was coolly received by&nbsp;Frederick the Great, ĩn spite of his connexion with the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">philosophe&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">party. At St Petersburg he met with a more cordial reception&nbsp;from Catherine II., and in 1787 he was permitted to return to&nbsp;France, though not to Paris. He showed generosity in assigning&nbsp;a considerable income to be divided annually among the peasant&nbsp;proprietors of upper Guienne. He was elected by Marseilles to&nbsp;the States-general, but refused to sit on the score of age. Raynal&nbsp;now realized the impossibility of a peaceful revolution, and, in&nbsp;terror of the proceedings for which the writings of himself and&nbsp;his friends had prepared the way, he sent to the Constituent&nbsp;Assembly an address, which was read on the 31st of May 1791,&nbsp;deprecating the violence of its reforms. This address is said</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
