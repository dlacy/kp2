a county of England. Its name is contracted from <hi rend="italic">Southfolk,</hi> ſo called from its ſituation in regard to Norfolk. It is bounded on the west by Cambridgeſhire ; on the ſouth by Effex, from which it is parted by the river Stour ; on the eaſt by the German Ocean ; and on the north by Norfolk, separated from it by the Lesser Ouſe and the Waveney@@. From west to eaſt it is 52 miles in length, about 20 at a medium in breadth, and 196 in circumference. It contains 22 hundreds, 29 market towns, 575 pariſhes, upwards of 34,000 houſes, and more than 200,000 inhabitants. The whole is divided into two parts, viz. the Liberty of St Edmund, and the Geldable ; the former of which contain the west parts of the county, and the other the eaſt ; and there is a grand jury for each at the aſſizes. The air is reckoned as wholeſome and pleaſant as any in the kingdom, nor is it otherwiſe upon the ſea coaſt, which is dry and ſandy, and free from salt marſhes. The soil, except to the west and upon the ſea-coaſt, is very rich, being a compound of clay and marle. Towards the ſea there are large-heaths and tracts of sand ; but theſe produce hemp, rye, and peaſe, and ſeed great flocks of ſheep. About Newmarket the soil is much the ſame ; but in high Suffolk or the woodlands, beſides wood, there are very rich paſtures, where abundance of cattle are fed. In other parts of the county, as about Bury, there is plenty of corn. As this county is noted for the richneſs of its paſtures, so is it for butter and cheeſe, eſpecially the former, which is ſaid to be remarkably good ; ſo that being packed up in firkins, it is ſold for all uſes both by sea and land, and conveyed to many parts of England, eſpecially to London. The inland parts of the county are well ſupplied with wood for fuel, and thoſe upon the ſea-coaſt with coals from New- caſtle. The manufactures of the county are chiefly woollen and linen cloth. It lies in the diocese of Norwich, has two archdeacons, viz. of Sedbury and Suffolk ; gives title of earl to a branch of the Howards ; sends two members to parliament for the county, and two for each of the following places, Ipſwich, Dunwich, Orford, Aldborough, Sudbury, Eye, and St Edmund’s-Bury. The county is extremely well watered by the following rivers, which either traverſe its borders, or run acroſs into the German Ocean, viz. the Lesser Ouſe, the Waveney, the Blithe, the Deben, the Orwell or Gipping, and the Stour.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
