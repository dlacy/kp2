<p><span class="font1">innovations. The conservatives refused to ratify the recess, which was not published, but the Protestant states declared&nbsp;that they would accept the emperor’s word of honour, and&nbsp;furnished him with troops for repelling the Mahommedans. The&nbsp;fact that the conservative princes, especially the dukes of&nbsp;Bavaria, were opposed to any strengthening of the emperor’s&nbsp;power, and were in some cases hereditary enemies of the house&nbsp;of Habsburg, served to protect the Protestant princes. In&nbsp;1534 the Schmalkaldic League succeeded in restoring the&nbsp;banished duke of Württemberg, who declared himself in favour&nbsp;of the Lutheran reformation, and thus added another to the&nbsp;list of German Protestant states. In 1539 George of Saxony died,&nbsp;and was succeeded by his brother Henry, who also accepted the&nbsp;new faith, and in the same year the new elector of Brandenburg&nbsp;became a Protestant. Indeed, there was reason to believe at&nbsp;this time that the archbishops of Mainz, Trier and Cologne, as&nbsp;well as some other bishops, were planning the secularization of&nbsp;their principalities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">To the north, Lutheran influence had spread into Denmark; Sweden and Norway were also brought within its sphere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Christian II. of Denmark, a nephew of the elector of Saxony, came to the throne in 1513, bent on bringing&nbsp;Sweden and Norway, over which he nominally ruled in&nbsp;accordance with the terms of the Union of Kalmar&nbsp;(1397), completely under his control. In order to do&nbsp;this it was necessary to reduce the power of the nobility&nbsp;and clergy, privileged classes exempt from taxation and rivals&nbsp;of the royal power. Denmark had suffered from all the abuses&nbsp;of papal provisions, and the nuncio of Leo X. had been forced&nbsp;in 1518 to flee from the king’s wrath. Christian II. set up a&nbsp;supreme court for ecclesiastical matters, and seemed about to&nbsp;adopt a policy similar to that later pursued by Henry VIII. of&nbsp;England, when his work was broken off by a revolt which&nbsp;compelled him to leave the country. Lutheranism continued&nbsp;to make rapid progress, and Christian’s successor permitted&nbsp;the clergy to marry, appropriated the annates and protected&nbsp;the Lutherans. Finally Christian III., an ardent Lutheran,&nbsp;ascended the throne in 1536; with the sanction of the diet he&nbsp;severed, in 1537, all connexion with the pope, introducing the&nbsp;Lutheran system of Church government and accepting the&nbsp;Augsburg Confession.@@<sup>1</sup> Norway was included in the changes,&nbsp;but Sweden had won its independence of Denmark, under&nbsp;Gustavus Vasa, who, in 1523, was proclaimed king. He used&nbsp;the Lutheran theories as an excuse for overthrowing the ecclesiastical&nbsp; aristocracy, which had been insolently powerful in&nbsp;Sweden. In 1527, supported by the diet, he carried his measures&nbsp;for secularizing such portions of the Church property as he&nbsp;thought fit, and for subjecting the Church to the royal power&nbsp;(Ordinances of Vesteräs); but many of the old religious cere monies&nbsp; and practices were permitted to continue, and it was not&nbsp;until 1592 that Lutheranism was officially sanctioned by the Swedish synod.@@<sup>2</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Charles V., finding that his efforts to check the spread of the religious schism were unsuccessful, resorted once more to&nbsp;conferences between Roman Catholic and Lutheran&nbsp;theologians, but it became apparent that no permanent&nbsp;compromise was possible. The emperor then succeeded&nbsp;in disrupting the Schmalkaldic League by winning over, on&nbsp;purely political grounds, Philip of Hesse and young Maurice&nbsp;of Saxony, whose father, Henry, had died after a very brief&nbsp;reign. Charles V. had always exhibited the greatest confidence&nbsp;in the proposed general council, the summoning of which had&nbsp;hitherto been frustrated by the popes, and at last, in 1545,&nbsp;the council was summoned to meet at Trent, which lay conveniently upon the confines of Italy and Germany (see Trent,&nbsp;Council of). The Dominicans and, later, members of the&nbsp;newly born Order of Jesus, were conspicuous, among the</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">theological deputies, while the Protestants, though invited, refused to attend. It was clear from the first that the decisions&nbsp;of the council would be uncompromising in character, and that&nbsp;the Protestants would certainly refuse to be bound by its decrees.&nbsp;And so it fell out. The very first anathemas of the council were&nbsp;directed against those innovations which the Protestants had&nbsp;most at heart. The emperor had now tried threats, conferences&nbsp;and a general council, and all had failed to unify the Church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Maurice of Saxony, without surrendering his religious beliefs, had become the political friend of the emperor, who had&nbsp;promised him the neighbouring electorate of Saxony. John Frederick, the elector, was defeated at Mühlberg, April 1547, and taken prisoner. Philip of Hesse&nbsp;also surrendered, and Charles tried once more to&nbsp;establish a basis of agreement. Three theologians, including&nbsp; a conservative Lutheran, were chosen to draft&nbsp;the so-called “ Augsburg Interim.” This reaffirmed the seven&nbsp;sacraments, transubstantiation and the invocation of saints,&nbsp;and declared the pope head of the Church, but adopted&nbsp;Luther’s doctrine of justification by faith in a conditional&nbsp;way, as well as the marriage of priests, and considerably&nbsp;modified the theory and practice of the Mass. For four&nbsp;years Charles, backed by the Spanish troops, made efforts to&nbsp;force the Protestant towns to observe the Interim, but with&nbsp;little success. He rapidly grew extremely unpopular, and in&nbsp;1552 Maurice of Saxony turned upon him and attempted to&nbsp;capture him at Innsbruck. Charles escaped, but Maurice&nbsp;became for the moment leader of the German princes who&nbsp;gathered at Passau (August 1552) to discuss the situation. The&nbsp;settlement, however, was deferred for the meeting of the diet,&nbsp;which took place at Augsburg, 1555. There was a general&nbsp;anxiety to conclude a peace—“ </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">beständiger, beharrlicher, unbedingter, für und für ewig währender.”</span><span class="font1"> There was no other&nbsp;way but to legalize the new faith in Germany, but only those&nbsp;were to be tolerated who accepted the Augsburg Confession.&nbsp;This excluded, of course, not only the Zwinglians and Anabaptists, but the ever-increasing Calvinistic or “ Reformed ”&nbsp;Church. The principle </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">cujus regio ejus religio</span><span class="font1"> was adopted,&nbsp;according to which each secular ruler might choose between the&nbsp;old faith and the Lutheran. His decision was to bind all his subjects, but a subject professing another religion from his prince&nbsp;was to be permitted to leave the country. The ecclesiastical&nbsp;rulers, however, were to lose their possessions if they abandoned&nbsp;the old faith.@@<sup>3</sup> Freedom of conscience was thus established for&nbsp;princes alone, and their power became supreme in religious as&nbsp;well as secular matters. The Church and the civil government&nbsp;had been closely associated with one another for centuries, and&nbsp;the old system was perpetuated in the Protestant states.&nbsp;Scarcely any one dreamed that individual subjects could safely be&nbsp;left to believe what they would, and permitted, so long as they&nbsp;did not violate the law of the land, freely to select and practise&nbsp;such religious rites as afforded them help and comfort.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">During the three or four years which followed the signing of the Augsburg Confession in 1530 and the formation of the&nbsp;Schmalkaldic League, England, while bitterly denouncing and burning Lutheran heretics in the name&nbsp;of the Holy Catholic Church, was herself engaged in&nbsp;severing the bonds which had for well-nigh a thousand&nbsp;years bound her to the Apostolic See. An independent national Church was formed in 1534, which continued, however, for a time to adhere to all&nbsp;the characteristic beliefs of the medieval Catholic Church,&nbsp;excepting alone the headship of the pope. The circumstances&nbsp; which led to the English schism are dealt with&nbsp;elsewhere (see England, Church of), and need be reviewed&nbsp;here only in the briefest manner. There was some heresy&nbsp;in England during the opening decades of the 16th century,&nbsp;survivals of the Lollardy which now and then brought a victim&nbsp;to the stake. There was also the old discontent among the&nbsp;orthodox in regard to the Church’s exactions, bad clerics and</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
