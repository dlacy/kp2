a town of the hundred of Shamwell, in the lathe of Aylesford and county of Kent, twenty-nine miles from London. It stands on the river Medway, over which is a bridge connecting it with Rochester, so as in appearance to make it merely a suburb to that city. It consists of a single long street. The church is a fine old building, which formerly belonged to the Knights Templars, who had a palace near this town. The ruins of it are still visible on the banks of the river.
