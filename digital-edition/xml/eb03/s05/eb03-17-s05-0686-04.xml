(Dr John), an eminent divine, was born in Kent in 1630, and educated at Cambridge. He was choſen fellow of his college, and took a doctor’s degree in 1663. In 1667 he was choſen maſter of Corpus Chriſti College, and preferred to the deanery of Ely in 1677. He died on the 20th of May 1695. His works are, 1. The Righteous Ruler ; a ſermon on Proverbs xxix. <hi rend="italic">2.</hi> preached June 28. 1600. 2. A Diſcourſe concerning Prodigies, wherein the vanity of preſages by them is reprehended, and their true and proper ends asſerted and<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0693.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s05-0687"/>
vindicated. To this excellent work was afterwards added, A Diſcourſe concerning vulgar prophecies, wherein the vanity of receiving them as the certain indications of any future event is expoſed ; and ſome marks of diſtinction between true and pretended prophets are laid down. 3. A Latin Diſſertation concerning Urim and Thummim. 4. His famous treatiſe <hi rend="italic">De legibus Hebraeorum ritualibus et earum rationibus.</hi> The intention of this book, as he informs us himſelf, was to vindicate the Deity from the imputation of acting from arbitrary and fantaſtical motives. It has been highly and juſtly esteemed both for the elegance of ſtile and the uncommon erudition and found ſenſe which it diſplays. It has, however, (that part of it particularly which endeavours to deduce ſome of the Jewiſh ceremonies from the practices of their heathen neighbours), alarmed many persons, as if inch a doctrine, if it could be proved, would derogate from the Divine wiſdom, and undermine revelation. But this is ſo far from being the case, that Dr Spencer’s attempt, whether ſucceſsful or not, deferves the gratitude of Christians, becauſe it has a tendency to throw light on an important and difficult ſubject.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
