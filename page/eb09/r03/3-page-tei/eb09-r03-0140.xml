There has been much controveι<hi rend="sup">-</hi>sy as to the site of this temple and that of Juno Moneta on the Arx ; but there is an overwhelming mass of evidence to show that the Capitolium is the peak where the Palazzo Caflarelli stands, and that the church of Ara Cceli occupies the Arx. Livy (xxxv. 21) mentions the fall of a mass of rock from the Capitolium into the Vicus Jugarius, which passes close under the Caffarelli summit, ami is not near the opposite peak. Moreover, extensive substructions of tufa and peperino have been exposed on the eastern peak, the form of which appears to fit this nearly square triple temple, and in 1875 a fragment of a fluted column was found, of such great size that it could only have belonged to the temple of Jupiter. Its actual limits have not been clearly made out, and therefore the truth of Dionysius’s description (iv. 61) cannot be proved.@@<hi rend="sup">2</hi>  The temple is represented on many coins, both republican and imperial ; these show that the central cella was that of Jupiter, that of Minerva on his right, and of Juno on his left. The door was covered with gold reliefs, which were stolen by Stilicho (c. 390 ; Zosim., v. 38), and the gilt bronze tiles (Plin., xxxiii. 18) on the roof were partly stripped off by Genseric in 455 (Procop.,<hi rend="italic">De Belk Vanrl.,</hi>  i. 5), and the rest by Pope Honorius I. in 630 (Marliano, <hi rend="italic">Topogr.,</hi>  ii. 1). Till 1348, when the steps up to Ara Cceliwere built, there was no access to the Capitol from the back ; hence the three ascents to it mentioned by Livy (iii. 7, v. 26-28) and Tacitus <hi rend="italic">OHisk,</hi>  iii. 71-72) were all from the inside of the Servian circuit. Even on this inner side it was defended by a wall, the gates in which are called ‘<hi rend="sup">i</hi>Capitolii fores” by Tacitus. Part of the outer wall at the top of the tufa rock, which is cut into a smooth cliff, is visible from the modern Vicolo della Rupe Tarpeia ; this cliff is traditionally called the Tarpeian rock, but that must have been on the other side towards the Forum, from whence it was visible, as is clearly stated by Dionysius (vii. 35, viii. 78).@@<hi rend="sup">3</hi>  Another piece of the ancient wall has recently been exposed, about half-way up the slope from the Forum to the Arx. It is built of soft yellow tufa blocks, five courses of which still remain in the existing fragment. The large temple of Juno Moneta (“the Adviser”) on the Arx, built by Camillus in 384 b.c., was used as the mint ; hence <hi rend="italic">monxta</hi>  = “money ” (Liv., vi. 20).</p><p>A large number of other temples and smaller shrines stood on the Capitoline Hill, a word used broadly to include both the Capitolium and the Arx.@@<hi rend="sup">4</hi> Among these were the temple of Honos and Virtus, built by Marius, and the temple of Fides, founded by Numa, and rebuilt during the First Punic War. Both these were large enough to hold meetings of the Senate. The temple of Jupiter Tonans@@<hi rend="sup">5</hi> was built by Augustus (Suet.,<hi rend="italic">Aug.,</hi>  29), near the great temple of Jupiter. Other shrines existed to Venus Victrix, Ops, Jupiter Custos, and Concord—the last under the Arx (Liv., xxii. 33)—and many others, as well as a triumphal arch in honour of Nero, and a crowd of statues and other works of art (see Plin., <hi rend="italic">H.H.,</hi>  xxxiii. 4; xxxiv. 17, 18, 19; xxxv. 36, 45; xxxvi. 5, 8), so that the whole hill must have been a mass of architectural and artistic magnificence, the spoils of the whole Hellenic world.</p><p>The so-called Tabularium occupies the central part of the side towards the Forum ; it is set on the tufa rock, which is cut away to receive its lower story. It derives its name from an inscription found there in the 15th century, quoted by Poggio (see Gruter, <hi rend="italic">Dιscr.,</hi>  170, 6); but that name was given to many buildings in Rome (Liv., iii. 55, xliii. 16), and there is no reason to suppose that this specially was known as <hi rend="italic">the</hi>  Tabularium (comp. Virg., <hi rend="italic">Geor.,</hi>  ii. 501). Catulus, who was also the dedicator of the great temple of Jupiter (Tac., <hi rend="italic">Hisk,</hi>  iii. 72 ; Dion Cass., xliii. 14), was consul in 78 b.c., but part of this building is probably much earlier in date. Its outer walls are of peperino, its inner ones of tufa or concrete ; the Doric arcade has capitals and architrave of travertine.@@<hi rend="sup">6</hi>  A road paved with basalt passes through the building along this arcade, entered at one end from the Clivus Capitolinus, and at the other probably from the Gradus Monetæ, a flight of steps leading from the temple of Concord and the Forum up to the temple of Juno Moneta on the Arx (see Plate VII.). The entrance</p><lb/><p>from the Clivus Capitolinus is by a wide flat arch of peperino most beautifully jointed ; the other end wall has been mostly destroyed. The back of this building overlooked the Asylum or depression between the two peaks. From this higher level a long steep staircase of sixty-four steps descends towards the Forum ; the doorway at the foot of these stairs has a flat arch, with a circular relieving arch over it ; it was completely blocked up by the temple of Vespasian (see fig. 1). This was probably the door where the Vitellian rioters broke into the Capitolium (Tac., <hi rend="italic">HiM.,</hi>  iii. 71).@@<hi rend="sup">7</hi>  Great damage was done to this building by the additions of Boniface VIIL and Nicholas V., as well as by its being used as a salt store, by which the walls were much corroded.@@<hi rend="sup">8</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">The Imperial Fora.</hi></p><p>The Forum Julium (see fig. 18), with its central temple of Venus Genitrix, was begun in 49 B.c. after the battle of Rharsalia bj&gt; Julius and completed by Augustus.@@<hi rend="sup">9</hi> Being built on a crowded site it was somewhat cramped, and the ground cost nearly a hundred million sesterces.@@<hi rend="sup">10</hi> Part of its circuit wall, with remains of five arches, exists in the Via Marmorella ; and behind is a row of small vaulted rooms, probably shops or offices.@@<hi rend="sup">11</hi> The arches are flat, slightly cambered, with travertine springers and keys ; the rest, with the circular relieving arch over, is of tufa ; it was once lined with slabs of marble, the holes for which exist. Foundations of the circuit wall exist under the houses towards S. Adriano, but the whole plan has not been made out. Palladio<hi rend="italic">{Areh.,</hi>  iv. 31) describes excavations made here, and the discovery of remains of a fine temple, probably that of Venus Genitrix.@@<hi rend="sup">12</hi></p><p>The forum of Augustus (see fig. 18) adjoined that of Julius on its north-east side ; it contains the temple of Mars Ultor, built to</p><p>commemorate the vengeance taken on Cæsar’s murderers at Philippi, 42 B.c.
