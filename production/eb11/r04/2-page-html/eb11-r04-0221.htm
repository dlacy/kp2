In 1801 Rose left&nbsp;office with Pitt, but returned 'with him to power in 1804, when&nbsp;he was made vice-president of the committee on trade and&nbsp;joint paymaster-general. He resigned these offices a few days&nbsp;after Pitt’s death in 1806, but he served as vice-president of&nbsp;the committee on trade and treasurer of the navy under the&nbsp;duke of Portland and Spencer Perceval from 1807 to 1812.&nbsp;He was again treasurer of the navy under Lord Liverpool,&nbsp;and he was still member of parliament for Christchurch, a&nbsp;seat which he had held since 1790, when he died at Cuffnells,&nbsp;in Hampshire, on the 13th of January 1818. Rose was an&nbsp;able and conscientious public servant, although he and his&nbsp;two sons drew a large amount of money from sinecures, a&nbsp;fact referred to by William Cobbett in his “ A New Year’s Gift&nbsp;to old George Rose.” He wrote several books on economic&nbsp;subjects, and his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Diaries and Correspondence,</span><span class="font0"> edited by the&nbsp;Rev. L. V. Harcourt, was published in i860.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">His elder son, Sir George Henry Rose (1771-1855), was in parliament from 1794 to 1813, and again from 1818 to 1844,&nbsp;and in the meantime he was British minister at Munich and at&nbsp;Berlin; in 1818 he succeeded his father as clerk of the parliaments. He was the father of Baron Strathnairn (9.V.). The&nbsp;second son was the poet William Stewart Rose (?.v.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROSE, HUGH JAMES (1795-1838), English divine, was born at Little Horsted in Sussex on the 9th of June 1795, and&nbsp;was educated at Uckfield school and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. in 1817, but missed a fellowship. Taking orders, he was appointed to Buxted, Sussex,&nbsp;in 1819, and to the vicarage of Horsham in 1821. He had&nbsp;already attained some repute as a critic, which was enhanced&nbsp;when, after travelling in Germany, he delivered as select&nbsp;preacher at Cambridge, four addresses against rationalism,&nbsp;published in 1825 as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The State of the Protestant Religion in&nbsp;Germany.</span><span class="font0"> The book was severely criticized in Germany, and&nbsp;in England by E. B. Pusey. In 1827 Rose was collated to the&nbsp;prebend of Middleton; in 1830 he accepted the rectory of&nbsp;Hadleigh, Suffolk, and in 1833 that of Fairsted, Essex, and in&nbsp;1835 the perpetual curacy of St Thomas’s, Southwark. In&nbsp;1833-1834 he was professor of divinity at Durham, a post which&nbsp;ill-health forced him to resign. In 1836 he became editor of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopaedia Metropolitan,</span><span class="font0"> and he projected the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">New General&nbsp;Biographical Dictionary,</span><span class="font0"> a scheme carried through by his&nbsp;brother Henry John Rose (1800-1873). He was appointed&nbsp;principal of King’s College, London, in October 1836, but he was&nbsp;attacked by influenza, and after two years of ill-health he died&nbsp;at Florence on the 22nd of December 1838. Rose was a high-churchman, who to propagate his views in 1832 founded the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">British Magazine</span><span class="font0"> and so came into touch with the leaders of the&nbsp;Oxford movement. Out of a conference at his rectory in&nbsp;Hadleigh came the Association of Friends of the Church, formed&nbsp;by R. H. Froude and Wm. Palmer.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">ROSE, WILLIAM STEWART (1775-1843), English poet and translator, second son of George Rose (g.f.), was born in 1775.&nbsp;He was educated at Eton College, and in 1796 was returned&nbsp;to parliament for the borough of Christchurch. In 1800 he&nbsp;accepted the Chiltern hundreds on his appointment as reading&nbsp;clerk of the House of Lords and clerk of the private committees.&nbsp;His first work, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">A Naval History of the Late War,</span><span class="font0"> was undertaken&nbsp;at his father’s wish, but he only completed one volume. He&nbsp;produced a free version of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Amadis de Gaul</span><span class="font0"> from the French&nbsp;text of Herberay des Essarts in 1803, followed by a translation&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Partlnopex de Blois</span><span class="font0"> (1807) after Le Grand d’Aussy.&nbsp;With </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Part&amp;nopex</span><span class="font0"> he printed his ballad of “ The Red King,”&nbsp;and in 1810 appeared </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Crusade of King Louis</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">King&nbsp;Edward the Martyr.</span><span class="font0"> In 1814 he made a prolonged journey&nbsp;through Italy and eastern Europe, spending the year 1817&nbsp;at Venice, where he married a Venetian lady. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Court and&nbsp;Parliament of Bees,</span><span class="font0"> a translation of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Animali Parlanti</span><span class="font0"> of&nbsp;Casti, and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Letters from the North of Italy, addressed to Henry</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hallam, Esq.,</span><span class="font0"> appeared in 1819. In the same year the publisher Murray offered him £2000 for a translation of Ariosto (T. Moore,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Diary,</span><span class="font0"> 14th of April 1819). He had already written an abridged&nbsp;version of Berni’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rifacimento</span><span class="font0"> of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Orlando Inamorato</span><span class="font0"> of&nbsp;Boiardo, and had begun his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Orlando Furioso translated into&nbsp;English Verse</span><span class="font0"> which appeared in two parts in 1823 and 1831.&nbsp;This, which has become the standard English version, is a close&nbsp;rendering in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ottava rima</span><span class="font0"> of the original. Rose retired from&nbsp;his official position in 1824. He suffered from paralysis in his&nbsp;later years, and at Abbotsford, where he was an honoured&nbsp;guest, rooms were specially fitted up on the ground floor for&nbsp;his use. His last works were </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">An Epistle to the Right Honourable&nbsp;John Hookham Frere</span><span class="font0"> (1834), in verse, and a volume of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rhymes&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(1837) (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Quarterly Review,</span><span class="font0"> July 1836 and April 1837). He&nbsp;died on the 30th of April 1843.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROSE </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">{Rosa}.</span><span class="font0"> The rose has for all ages been the favourite flower, and as such it has a place in general literature that no&nbsp;other plant can rival. In most cases the rose of the poets and&nbsp;the rose of the botanist are one and the same in kind, but&nbsp;popular usage has attached the name rose to a variety of plants&nbsp;whose kinship to the true plant no botanist would for a moment&nbsp;admit. In this place we shall employ the word in its strict&nbsp;botanical significance, and in commenting on it treat it solely&nbsp;from the botanical point of view. The rose gives its name to&nbsp;the order Rosaceae, of which it may be considered the type.&nbsp;The genus consists of species varying in number, according to&nbsp;the diverse opinions of botanists of opposite schools, from thirty&nbsp;to one hundred and eighty, or even two hundred and fifty,&nbsp;exclusive of the many hundreds of mere garden varieties.&nbsp;While the lowest estimate is doubtless too low, the highest&nbsp;is enormously too large, but in any case the wide discrepancies&nbsp;above alluded to illustrate very forcibly the extreme variability&nbsp;of the plants, their adaptability to various conditions, and consequently their wide dispersion over the globe, the facility with&nbsp;which they are cultivated, and the readiness 'with which new&nbsp;varieties are continually being produced in gardens by the&nbsp;art of the hybridizer or the careful selection of the raiser. The&nbsp;species are natives of all parts of the northern hemisphere, but&nbsp;are scantily represented in the tropics unless at considerable&nbsp;elevations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">They are erect or climbing shrubs, never herbs or trees, generally more or less copiously provided with straight or hooked prickles&nbsp;of various shapes and with glandular hairs, as in the sweet-brier&nbsp;or in the moss-rose of gardens. The prickles serve the purpose of&nbsp;enabling the shrub to sustain itself amid other vegetation. The&nbsp;viscid hairs which are specially frequent on the flower stalks or in&nbsp;the neighbourhood of the flower serve to arrest the progress of&nbsp;undesirable visitants, while the perfume emitted by the glands in&nbsp;question may co-operate with the fragrance and colour of the&nbsp;flower to attract those insects whose presence is desirable. The&nbsp;leaves are invariably alternate, provided with stipules, and unequally&nbsp;pinnate, the leaflets varying in number from one (as in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">R. simplici-folia</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">berberi folia}</span><span class="font0"> to 11 and even 15, the odd leaflet always being&nbsp;at the apex, the others in pairs. The flowers are solitary or in loose&nbsp;cymes (eluster-roses) produced on the ends of the snoots. The&nbsp;flower-stalk expands into a vase- or urn-shaped dilatation, called&nbsp;the receptacle or receptacular tube, which ultimately becomes&nbsp;fleshy and encloses in its cavity the numerous carpels or fruits.&nbsp;From the edge of the urn or “ hip !’ proceed five sepals, often more&nbsp;or less compound like the leaves and overlapping in the bud.&nbsp;Within the sepals are five petals, generally broad or roundish in outline, with a very short stalk or none at all, and of very various shades&nbsp;of white, yellow or red. The very numerous stamens originate slightly&nbsp;above the sepals and petals; each has a slender filament and a small&nbsp;two-celled anther. The inner portion of the receptacular tube whence&nbsp;the stamens spring is thick and fleshy, and is occasionally spoken of as&nbsp;the “ disk but, as in this case it does not represent any separate&nbsp;organ, it is better </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font0"> avoid the use of the term. The carpels are&nbsp;very numerous, ultimately hard in texture, covered with hairs, and&nbsp;each provided with a long style and button-like stigma. The carpels are concealed within the receptacular tube and only the stigmas&nbsp;as a rule protrude from its mouth. Each carpel contains one ovule.&nbsp;The so-called fruit is merely the receptacular tube, which, as&nbsp;previously mentioned, becomes fleshy and brightly coloured as an&nbsp;attraction to birds, which devour the hips and thus secure the&nbsp;dispersion of the seed. The dry one-seeaed fruits (achenes) are&nbsp;densely packed inside the hip, and are covered with stiff hairs which&nbsp;cling to the bird’s beak. The stamens are in whorls, and, according&nbsp;to Payer, they originate in pairs one on each side of the base of</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
