Lisuarte then consents to the marriage of his daughter with Amadis on the Firm Island, whose&nbsp;wonders are brought to an end by Oriana entering a&nbsp;certain magic chamber,—a feat only to be accomplished&nbsp;by the fairest and most faithful of women.</span><span class="font1">@@</span><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Amadis</span><span class="font2"> is one of the best of the romances and contains many passages of much beauty and even tenderness. The boyish attachment between the Child of the&nbsp;Sea and Oriana is well told. The princess is weak and&nbsp;jealous, and not altogether a pleasing character. Amadis&nbsp;is a fine creation and is well distinguished from his brother&nbsp;Galaor. Both are brave, but the elder is grave and the&nbsp;younger gay. Amadis is the type of a constant lover ; his&nbsp;brother is more changeful. A modern reader may be&nbsp;wearied by the intolerable length of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Amadis</span><span class="font2"> and by&nbsp;the continual recurrence of similar adventures all ending&nbsp;in the same way. But these repetitions seemed no fault&nbsp;to readers whose tastes were easily satisfied and to whom&nbsp;such fictions came as an entirely new source of delight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The continuations are inferior to their prototype and become more full of complicated incidents and strange adventures as they&nbsp;proceed. The characters alter : for instance, the Urganda of the&nbsp;first four books is a fairy like Morgan la Fay, but subsequently she&nbsp;develops into an enchantress of a more Eastern and malignant&nbsp;nature like her rivals Zirfea and Melia. Besides his redaction of&nbsp;the Amadis, Montalvo composed about 1485 an original work, about&nbsp;one-third as long, giving the history of a son of the hero, called&nbsp;Esplandian. In order that it might share in the popularity of the&nbsp;father’s achievements, it came forth as Quinto Libro dl Amadis de&nbsp;Gaula, o las Sergas del Cavallero Espla'ndiane). The curate justly&nbsp;decreed that “ the merits of the father must not be imputed to the&nbsp;son ” when he cast the volume on the bonfire in Don Quixote’s&nbsp;courtyard. Although perhaps the best of the continuations, it is&nbsp;not equal to the original. We read that before marriage Oriana&nbsp;bore a child to Amadis, and in order to hide her shame the boy&nbsp;is sent to a distant country. While those in charge of him are&nbsp;passing through a forest a lioness carries him off, but a hermit&nbsp;meets and rebukes the animal, which subsequently suckles the&nbsp;young Esplandian. When he grows up the lioness continues her&nbsp;care and accompanies him to the chase. King Lisuarte one day&nbsp;witnesses this, which is the cause of Oriana recognizing her son&nbsp;by certain marks on his body. He is brought up at the court of&nbsp;Lisuarte and receives knighthood. He then begins his adventures&nbsp;under the title of the Black Knight (from his armour), and sails&nbsp;for Turkey, where most of his exploits take place. The Christians&nbsp;are assisted by the enchantress Urganda and the infidels by her rival&nbsp;Melia. Amadis, Galaor, Esplandian, and the knights being in&nbsp;great danger of death, Urganda saves them by putting them all&nbsp;to sleep on the Firm Island until Lisuarte, son of Esplandian, could&nbsp;obtain possession of a certain magic sword. The romance was first&nbsp;printed in 1510, and five editions appeared before the end of the&nbsp;century. This was soon followed by other similar romances, each&nbsp;with an illegitimate descendant of Amadis for a hero, with a son&nbsp;who performs exploits still more wonderful than those of his father,&nbsp;—a perpetual succession of heroes. At the end of the Esplandian&nbsp;Montalvo speaks of wilting another book to carry on the history&nbsp;still further. This caused some one, believed to be Paez de Ribera,&nbsp;to bring out El Sexto Libro, en que se cuentan los Grandes Hechos&nbsp;de Florisando, nephew of Amadis, taken from an Italian source.&nbsp;This was translated into English and Italian, but not into French.&nbsp;The Septimo Libro, en el qual se trata de los Grandes Hechos en armas&nbsp;de Lisuarte de Grecia y Perion de Gaula, deals with the life of the&nbsp;son of Esplandian and Leonorina. The other character is Perion,&nbsp;son of Amadis and Oriana, and the type of the fickle lover, as&nbsp;opposed to Lisuarte, who is more like Amadis. The book commences with the voyage of Perion from England to Ireland, but&nbsp;a lady in a boat with a crew of four monkeys separates him from&nbsp;his followers. He goes to Trebizond and falls in love with Gricileria,&nbsp;daughter of the emperor. When Lisuarte is a prisoner in charge of&nbsp;the king of the Giants’ Isle, Gradaffile, the daughter of the latter,&nbsp;escapes with him to Constantinople, where after many combats&nbsp;he obtains the magic sword and enables Amadis and the knights&nbsp;to escape from the magic sleep in the Firm Island (see Esq)landian&nbsp;above). Lisuarte eventually marries Onoloria, sister of Gricileria.&nbsp;The work continues Florisand and is attributed to Feliciano de&nbsp;Silva.

<p><span class="font1">Lisuarte de Grecia y de la Muerte del Rey Amodie, pretended that his work was taken from the Greek. It also is a continuation of&nbsp;Florisand and was not translated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We now come to Dibro Noveno, que es la Chronica del Principe y Cavallero de la Ardixnte Espada, Amadis de Grecia, a continuation&nbsp;of the seventh and not of the eighth book, and more full of marvels&nbsp;than any of its predecessors. Amadis of Greece, the son of Lisuarte and Onoloria, is carried off by pirates when an infant and sold&nbsp;to a Moorish king. He derived his name from the figure of a flaming sword upon his breast. The exploits commence, like those in&nbsp;the Esplandian, at the Forbidden Mountain, and the family history&nbsp;concludes, as in the same romance, with the enchantment by Zirfea&nbsp;of all the heroes and princesses in the Tower of the Universe in&nbsp;order to prevent their death at a fated moment. Feliciano de Silva&nbsp;is the reputed author. Stimulated by the success of his two&nbsp;anonymous productions, the same writer continued the series with&nbsp;four more parts, of which the Cοronica de los Valientes Caballeros D.&nbsp;Florisel de Niquea y el Fuerte Anaxartes forms the tenth book and&nbsp;contains the first two parts. Genealogically the romance is a continuation of Lisuarte and Amadis de Grecia. Florisel is the son of&nbsp;the latter person and the princess of Niquea. In these fictions a&nbsp;new character is introduced, Darinel, a kind of comic shepherd,&nbsp;in love with the heroine Sylvia, daughter of Lisuarte and Onoloria,&nbsp;through whom Florisel becomes acquainted with the heroine. All&nbsp;three go to the relief of Anastarax, who is confined by enchantment&nbsp;in a fiery prison. But the achievement of the exploit is reserved&nbsp;for the Amazon Alastraxerea, whose adventures occupy a great&nbsp;portion of the tale, which culminates in the siege of Constantinople&nbsp;by all the potentates of western Europe in consequence of Florisel&nbsp;having carried off Helena, princess of Apollonia. Among other&nbsp;new characters are the enchantress Armida and the “strong”&nbsp;Anaxartes, who marries young Oriana, sister of Florisel. The&nbsp;amount of bloodshed throughout the work is only equalled by the&nbsp;number of marriages. The third part of Florisel forms the eleventh&nbsp;book of Amadis and is known as Chronica de Don Florisel de Niquea,&nbsp;en la quell se trata de D. Rogel de Grecia y el Segundo Agesilao.&nbsp;Rogel is the son of Florisel and Helena, and brother of Agesilao&nbsp;the Second, so called to distinguish him from Agesilao of Colchos.&nbsp;A few years later Feliciano de Silva published the fourth part of&nbsp;Don Florisel, in two books, the second of which treats of the loves&nbsp;of Rogel of Greece and Archisidea, and of Agesilao and Diana,&nbsp;daughter of Queen Sidonia. The author in his preface implies&nbsp;that the work was intended as an allegorical celebration of the&nbsp;military and domestic virtues of Charles V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The hero of La Dozena Parte que tracta de los grandes Hechos en Armas del Caυ. Don Silνes de la Selva, was the son of Amadis of&nbsp;Greece and Finistea. Born on a desert island, Don Silvio first distinguishes himself at the siege of Constantinople described in the&nbsp;tenth book. The Greek empresses and princesses having been&nbsp;carried off by enchantment, he accompanies the knights who go in&nbsp;search of them. The ladies are rescued, but during their absence&nbsp;have become mothers, among others of Spheramond, son of Rogel,&nbsp;and Amadis of Astre, son of Agesilao. Feliciano de Silva sometimes passes for the author, who was really Pedro de Lujan. The&nbsp;work is in two parts, which in French make the thirteenth and&nbsp;fourteenth books. Lepolemo ό el Caballero de la Cruz and Leandro&nbsp;el Bel are considered to make the thirteenth and fourteenth books.&nbsp;From a unique first edition (1521) of Lepolemo discovered a few&nbsp;years since it appears that it professed to be a translation by Alonso&nbsp;de Salazar. The hero was the son of the emperor Maximilian and&nbsp;was carried away in infancy to the East. N. Antonio speaks of&nbsp;a certain romance composed by a Portuguese, entitled Penalνa,&nbsp;the last of the line of the original Amadis. It is supposed to have&nbsp;dealt with the last exploits and death of Lisuarte of Greece, but if&nbsp;it existed at all no printed copy has ever yet been seen. The&nbsp;other Spanish romances usually appended to the Amadis series are&nbsp;mentioned in the bibliographical list below.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the French series more and more liberties are taken with the original as the work proceeds. As shown in the table below, the&nbsp;numbers of the books do not tally. The fifteenth, entirely due to&nbsp;Antoine Tyron, describes the feats of Sferamond (so called from&nbsp;a birthmark representing a globe) of Greece and Amadis d’Astre.&nbsp;The sixteenth to the twenty-first books continue the adventures of&nbsp;Sferamond and were translated from the Italian of Mambrino Roseo&nbsp;by Gabriel Chappuys. Duplicate versions from the Italian were&nbsp;made by Nicolas de Montreux of the sixteenth, by Jacques Chariot&nbsp;of the nineteenth, and by Jean Bovion of the twentieth books.&nbsp;The twenty-second to the twenty-fourth books, devoted to Fulgoran,&nbsp;Safiraman, and Hercules d’Astre, continue and form a new conclusion&nbsp;of the French Amadis. Only one edition appeared (Paris, 1615, 3&nbsp;vols. 8vo), now extremely rare. The naive and pure style of tho&nbsp;earliest of the series degenerates into an uninteresting succession&nbsp;of coarse and obscene incidents. In the twenty-third book we are&nbsp;taken for the first time to America. Flores de Grèce (1552) is considered to form the twenty-fifth book. Genealogically it would be&nbsp;the sixth, as the hero is the second son of Esplandian. In the 16th&nbsp;century the French Amadis library extended to 30 vols, of various</span></p>
