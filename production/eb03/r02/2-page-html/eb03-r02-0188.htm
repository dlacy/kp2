<p><span class="font0">every part of his life incapable of </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">conducting </span><span class="font0">himſelf. Not that he was entirely deſtitute of underſtanding,&nbsp;ſince he had made a tolerable proficiency in the Greek&nbsp;and Latin languages, and even wrote an hiſtory of his&nbsp;own time ; which, however deſtitute of other merit,&nbsp;was not contemptible in point of ſtyle. Nevertheleſs,&nbsp;with this ſhare of erudition, he was unable to advance&nbsp;himſelf in the ſtate, and ſeemed utterly neglected until he was placed all at once at the head of affairs.&nbsp;The commencement of his reign gave the moſt promiſing hopes oi an happy continuance. He began by&nbsp;paſſing an act of oblivion for all former words and actions, and diſannulled all the cruel edicts of Caligula.&nbsp;He forbade all perſons, upon ſevere penalties, to ſacriſice to him as they had done to Caligula ; was arduous in hearing and examining complaints ; and frequently adminiſtered juſtice in perſon ; tempering by&nbsp;his mildneſs the ſeverity of the law. We are told of&nbsp;his bringing a woman to acknowledge her ſon, by ad&nbsp;judging her to marry him. The tribunes of the people&nbsp;coming one day to attend hh when he was on his tribunal. he courteouſly excuſed himſelſ for not having&nbsp;room for them to fit down. By this deportment he ſo&nbsp;much gained the affections of the people, that upon a&nbsp;vague report of his being ſlain by ſurpriſe, they ran&nbsp;about the ſtreets in the utmoſt rage and conſternation,&nbsp;with horrid imprecations againſt all ſuch as were ac-ceſſary to his death ; nor could they be appeaſed, until&nbsp;they were aſſured, with certainty, of his ſafety. He&nbsp;•took a more than ordinary care that Ro&quot;me ſhould be&nbsp;continually ſupplied with corn and proviſions, ſecuring&nbsp;the merchants againſt pirates. He was not leſs affi-duous in his buildings, in which he excelled almoſt all&nbsp;that went before him. He conſtructed a wonderful&nbsp;aqu</span><span class="font1">æ</span><span class="font0">duct, called after his own name, much ſurpafling&nbsp;any other in Rome, either for w<sup>r</sup>orkroanffιip or plentiful ſupply. It-brought water from 40 miles diſtance,&nbsp;through great mountains, and over deep valleys ; being&nbsp;built on ſtately arches, and furniſhing the higheſt parts&nbsp;of the city. He made alſo an haven at Oſtia ; a work&nbsp;of ſuch immenſe expence, that his ſucceffors were unable&nbsp;to maintain it. But his greateſt work of all was the&nbsp;draining of the lake Fucinus, which was the largeſt in&nbsp;Italy, and bringing its water into the Tiber, in order to&nbsp;ſtrengthen the current of that river. For effecting this,&nbsp;among other vaſt difficulties, he mined through a mountain of ſtone three miles broad, and kept 30,000 men&nbsp;eu∣ployed for 11 years together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To this ſolicitude for-the internal advantages of the ſtate, he added that of a watchful guardianſhip over&nbsp;the provinces. He reſtored Judea to Herod Agrippa,&nbsp;which Caligula had taken from Herod Antipas, his&nbsp;uncle, the man who had put John the Baptiſt to death,&nbsp;and who was baniſhed by order of the preſent emperor.&nbsp;Claudius alſo reſtored ſuch princes to their kingdoms&nbsp;as had been unjuſtly diſpoſſeſſed by his predeceſſors ;&nbsp;but deprived the Lycians and Rhodians of their liberty, for having promoted inſurrections, and crucified ſome&nbsp;citizens of Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">He even undertook to gratify the people by foreign conqueſt. The Britons, who had, for near too years,&nbsp;been left in ſole pofſeſfion of their own iſland, began&nbsp;to ſeek the mediation of Rome, to quell their inteſtine&nbsp;commotions. The principal man who deſired to ſubject his native country to the Roman dominion, was</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">one Bericus, who, by many arguments, perſuaded the emperor to make a deſcent upon the iſland, m.ιgnify-ing the advantages that would attend the conqneſt of&nbsp;it. In purſuance of his advice, therefore, Plautius the&nbsp;praetor was ordered to paſs over into Gaul, and make&nbsp;preparations for this great expedition. At firſt, indeed,&nbsp;his ſoldiers ſeemed backward to embark ; declaring,&nbsp;that they were unwilling to make war beyond the limits of the w<sup>r</sup>orld, for ſo they judged Britain to be.&nbsp;However, they were at laſt perſuaded to go ; and the&nbsp;Britons, under the conduct of their king Cynobelinus,&nbsp;were ſeveral times overthrown. And theſe ſucceſſes ſoon&nbsp;after induced Claudius to go into Britain in perſon,&nbsp;upon pretence that the natives were ſtill ſeditious, and&nbsp;had not delivered up ſome Roman fugitives who had&nbsp;taken ſhelter among them ; but for a particular account&nbsp;of the exploits of the Romans in this iſland, ſee the article England.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But though Claudius gave in the beginning of his reign the higheſt hopes of an happy continuance, he&nbsp;ſoon be fan to leſſen his care for the public, and to&nbsp;commit to his favourites all the concerns of the empire.&nbsp;This weak prince was unable to act but under the direction of others. The chief of his directors was his&nbsp;wiſe Meſſalina : whoſe name is almoſt become a common appellation to women of abandoned characters.&nbsp;However, ſhe was not leſs remarkable for her cruelties&nbsp;than her luſts ; as by her intrigues ſhe deſtroyed many&nbsp;of the moſt illuſtrious families of Rome. Subordinate&nbsp;to her were the emperor’s'ſreedmen ; Pallas, the trea-ſurer ; Narciſſus, the ſecretary of ſtate ; and Calliſtus,&nbsp;the maſter of the requeſts. Theſe entirely governed&nbsp;Claudius; ſo that he was only left the.fatigues of ceremony, while they were poſſeſſed of all the power of&nbsp;the ſtate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It would be tedious to enumerate the various cruelties which theſe inſidious adviſers obliged the feeble emperor to commit : thoſe againſt his own family will&nbsp;ſuſfice. Appius Silanus, a perſon of great merit, who&nbsp;had been married to the emperor’s mother-in-law, was&nbsp;put to death upon the ſuggeſtions of Meſſalina. After&nbsp;him lie flew both his ſons-in-law, Silanus and Pompey,&nbsp;and his two nieces the Livias, one the daughter of&nbsp;Druſus, the other of Germanicus ; and all without permitting them to plead in their defence, or even without affigning any cauſe for his diſpleaſure. Great&nbsp;numbers of others fell a ſacriſice to the jealouſy of Meſ-ſalina and her minions ; who bore ſo great a ſway in&nbsp;the ſtate, that all offices, dignities, and governments,&nbsp;were entirely at their diſpoſal. Every thing was put&nbsp;to ſale : they took money for pardons and penalties ;&nbsp;and accumulated, by theſe means, ſuch vaſt ſums, that&nbsp;the wealth of Crœfus was conſidered as nothing in compariſon. One day, the emperor complaining that his&nbsp;exchequer was exhauſted, he was ludicrouſly told, that&nbsp;it might be ſufficiently repleniſlied if his two ſreedmen&nbsp;would take him into partnerſhip. Still, however, during ſuch corruption, he regarded his favourites with&nbsp;the higheſt eſteem, and even ſolicited the ſenate to&nbsp;grant them peculiar marks of their approbation. Theſe&nbsp;diſorders in the miniſters of government did not fail to&nbsp;produce conſpiracies againſt the emperor. Statius Corvinus and Gallus Affinius formed a conſpiracy againſt&nbsp;him Two knights, whoſe names are not told us, privately combined to aſſaſſinate him. But the revolt</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
