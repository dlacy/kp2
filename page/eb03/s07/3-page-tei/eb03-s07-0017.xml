Cold ſubſtances applied to the perinæum are perhaps of greater ſervice than any thing else, as cloths wet with vinegar and cold water, or with a ſtrong ſolution of ſaccharum ſaturni in vinegar ; but the best method of applying cold is to daſh water immediately from the fountain upon the anus and perinæum. When it ariſes from the irritation of ſtones in the bladder, opiates and mucilaginous liquors plentifully uſed frequently give great relief. When incontinence of urine is owing to a laceration of parts in performing the operation of lithotomy, the diſeaſe is nearly of the ſame nature as that from the cauſe first mentioned, and therefore the same remedies are of ſervice. When theſe remedies fail in either of the caſes, compreſſion of the urethra prevents any inconvenience ariſing from the constant dripping of the urine; and for this purpoſe an inſtrument termed <hi rend="italic">jugum penis </hi>(fig. 90.) is applied to the penis ; or, to press against the urethra of the female, peſſaries (fig. 91. a and b) are contrived, which are made in ſuch a way as to be introduced into the vagina, and there to preſs upon the urethra. They are sometimes made of sponge, but thoſe of ivory or wood well poliſhed are more generally preferred. A ſmall bottle made of elaſtic gum, and open at both ends for the paſſage of the menſtrual diſeharge, anſwers the purpoſe equally well. Certain caſes however occur where preſſure upon the urethra is improper, eſpecially where there is a constant deſire to paſs water ; and here much relief is obtained from the use of receivers, which are now suited to both ſexes. Fig. 92 . repreſents one for the male, and fig. 93. one for the female.</p><p>We ſhall here treat only of that ſpecies of ſuppreſſion of urine where the urine is collected in the bladder, but from ſome obſtructing cauſe is prevented from being diſcharged. It ariſes from a variety of cauſes.</p><p>When it ariſes from a want of tone in the body of the bladder, it is often connected with palſy of the lower extremities; it is frequently owing alſo to retaining urine too long. The catheter, in this caſe, is commonly an effectual remedy, and ought to be employed as ſoon as the ſuppreſſion is evidently formed, and repeated from time to time, till the tone of the ſyſtem is recovered by the uſe of proper remedies. The method of introducing the catheter is the ſame with that already directed for founding for the stone. Fig. 94. a catheter for the male, fig. 95. one for the female.</p><p>When the affection ariſes from ſpaſm about the neck of the bladder, opiates, warm water thrown into the rectum, and afterwards the warm bath, are the best means of producing relief. When it proceeds from ſcirrhus of the prostate gland, or from other tumors, or from obstructions of the urethra in conſequence of gonorrhoea, the treatment to be afterwards deſcribed will be found beſt ſuited for ſuch complaints. When the ſuppression ariſes from the preſſure of the uterus in the latter months of pregnancy, change of poſture is ſometimes found to have ſome effect ; but if this fail, immediate relief can commonly be given by the introduction of the catheter, which in women is for the moſt part readily done.</p><p>Suppreſſion of urine from inflammation affecting the neck of the bladder is one of the moſt alarming varieties of the diſeaſe, as it produces pain, and ſuch a degree of ſwelling in the parts as to render the introduction of the catheter inadmiſſible. It may ariſe from the matter in gonorrhoea paſſing backwards along the courſe of the urethra. An improper uſe of injections has likewiſe frequently produced this ſpecies of the diſeaſe. The treatment is nearly the ſame as for inflammatory complaints in other parts of the body. Blood-letting ſhould be employed, and particularly leeches ſhould be applied to the perinæum. Opiates ought to be given in large doſes. Injections of warm water ſhould be frequently thrown up the rectum, and the whole body ſhould be immerſed in the warm bath. If theſe means be properly uſed, they will very ſeldom fail of ſucceſs ; but when they do not prove effectual, when the bladder becomes painfully diſtended, and when every attempt to introduce the catheter has failed, nothing is to be depended upon but a puncture made into the body of the bladder, in order to diſcharge the water contained in it.</p><p>Various methods have been propoſed for effecting this operation. Puncturing the bladder above the pubes has been recommended by many respectable authors. The following is the method of doing it : A lancet-pointed trocar, about two inches long, is to be at once introduced through the integuments, about an inch and half above the pubes, into the body of the bladder. The stilette is to be removed as ſoon as the water begins to flow through a groove formed in it, and the urine allowed to flow through the canula, which is ſecured to the body by means of a bandage. A cork is to be fitted to the canula, that the urine may paſs off at intervals only. The canula is to be retained till the cauſe which produced the obstruction is fo far removed that the patient can diſcharge the urine in the natural way. It ought to be removed every three or four days, and cleared from the sordes which adheres to it, otherwiſe it ſoon becomes covered with a calculous cruſt, which renders the extraction exceedingly difficult. On theſe occaſions a firm probe, of sufficient length, ought to be paſſed through it into the bladder, upon which it may again be eaſily returned as ſoon as it is properly cleaned.</p><p>This method of puncturing the bladder is not altogether free from objections: the bladder being ſuſpended for a long time on the canula, its tone is ſometimes destroyed ; and if it happen to slip off the canula, the operation muſt be repeated ; beſides, the urine may be diffuſed in the ſurrounding cellular ſubſtance.</p><p>When the bladder is to be punctured from the perinæum, the trocar, which ought to be longer than the one for punic turing above the pubes, is to be introduced at a little diſtance from the rapha perinaei, and then paſſed into the body of the bladder, a little to the upper and outside of the proſtate gland, carrying the point of the instrument a little upwards, to avoid wounding the ends of the ureter or feminal veſſels. Puncturing from the anus, or the vagina in females, are attended with ſo many inconveniences that they ought never to be attempted.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Chap.</hi> XXIX. <hi rend="italic">Diſeaſes of the Penis.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> I. <hi rend="italic">Of Obſtructions of the Urethra.</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic smallcaps">Ob</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">structions</hi> of the urethra frequently occur after repeated or ſevere attacks of the venereal diſeaſe. They may be owing to caruncles or fleſhy excreſcences in the urethra ; to tumors in the lining membrane, or parts contiguous to the urethra, in conſequence of inflammation; to ſpaſmodic affections of the urethra ; or to ſtrictures properly ſo called.</p><p>Till of late years almoſt every inſtance of obstruction in the urethra has been attributed to caruncles, but their occurrence is much less frequent than was formerly imagined. They are rarely found except near the point of the urethra. They are conſidered to be nearly of the ſame nature with the warts which grow upon the prepuce or root of the glans in venereal caſes. Tumors obſtructing the passage in the urine may be occaſioned either immediately by inflammation, or in conſequened of old sores within the ure</p></body></text></TEI>
