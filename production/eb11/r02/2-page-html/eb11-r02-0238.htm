<p><span class="font1">into the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">vitrophyres,</span><span class="font1"> the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">felsophyres</span><span class="font1"> and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">granophyres,</span><span class="font1"> but this is not now in use, and the Iast of these terms has obtained a&nbsp;signification quite different from that originally assigned to it.&nbsp;Mixtures of the different kinds occur; thus a vitreous rhyolite&nbsp;has often felsitic areas in its ground-mass, and in the same&nbsp;lava flow some parts may be vitreous while others are felsitic.&nbsp;The vitreous rhyolites are identical in most respects with the&nbsp;obsidians, from which they can only be separated in an artificial&nbsp;classification; and in their glassy base the banded or eutaxitic,&nbsp;Spherulitic and perlitic structures of pure obsidians are very&nbsp;frequentIy present (see </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Obsidian; Perlite).</span><span class="font1"> The felso-Hparites or Hparites with stony ground-mass are especially&nbsp;common among the pre-Tertiary igneous rocks (see </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Quartz-porphyry),</span><span class="font1"> as Hparite glass is unstable and experiences&nbsp;devitrification in course of time. Many of these felsites have&nbsp;fluxion banding, SpheruHtes and even perHtic cracks, which are&nbsp;strong evidence that they were originally glassy. In other&nbsp;cases a hyaloHparite, obsidian, or pitchstone becomes felsitic&nbsp;along its borders and joint planes, or even along perlitic cracks,&nbsp;and we may assume that the once fibrous rock has changed into&nbsp;felsite under the action of percolating moisture or even by&nbsp;atmospheric decomposition. In many rhyolites the felsite&nbsp;is original and represents an incipieitt crystallization of the&nbsp;vitreous material which took place before the rock was yet cold.&nbsp;The felsite in turn is Hable to change; it becomes a fine mosaic of&nbsp;quartz and alkaH felspar; and in this way a matrix of the third&nbsp;type, the microcrystalHne, may develop. This is proved by&nbsp;the occurrence of the remains of Spherulitic and perHtic structures&nbsp;in rocks which are no longer felsitic or glassy. Many microcrystalHne rhyoHtes have a ground-mass in which much felsitic&nbsp;matter occurs; but as this tends to recrystallize in course of&nbsp;time, the older rocks of this group show least of it. Whilst no&nbsp;quartz-bearing rhyoHtes are known to have been erupted in&nbsp;recent years, Lacroix proved that portions of the “ dome ”&nbsp;which rose as a great tower or column out of the crater of Mont&nbsp;Pelée after the eruption in 1906 contained small crystals of quartz&nbsp;in the ground-mass. The rock was an acid andesite, and it&nbsp;was ascribed by Lacroix to the action of steam retained in the&nbsp;rock under considerable pressure. The microcrystalHne ground-mass of rhyoHtes is never micrographie as in the porphyries&nbsp;(granophyres); on the other hand it is often micropoikilitic,&nbsp;consisting of small felspars, often sub-rectangular, embedded in&nbsp;Httle rounded or irregular plates of quartz.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The ground-mass of rhyoHtes is Hable to other changes, of which the most important are silicification, kaoHnization&nbsp;and Sericitization. Among the older rocks of this group it is&nbsp;the exception to find that secondary quartz has not been deposited in some parts of them. Often indeed the matrix is&nbsp;completely replaced by silica in the form of finely crystaHine&nbsp;quartz or chalcedony; and these rocks on analysis prove to&nbsp;contain over 90% of silica. In the recent rhyoHtes of Hungary,&nbsp;New Zealand, &amp;c., the deposit of coarse opal in portions of the&nbsp;rock is a very common phenomenon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">KaoHnization may be due to weathering, and the stony dulI appearance of the matrix of many microcrystalHne rhyoHtes&nbsp;is a consequence of the decomposed state of the felspar grains&nbsp;in them; it is even more typically developed by fumarole&nbsp;action, which replaces the felspars with soft, cloudy white&nbsp;products which belong to a mineral of the kaoHn group. Seri-citization, or the development of fine white mica after felspar,&nbsp;is usuaUy associated with shearing, and is commonest in the&nbsp;older rhyoHtes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Vesicular structure is very common in rhyoHtes; in fact the pumiceous obsidians have this character in greater perfection than any other rocks (see </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Pumice);</span><span class="font1"> but even the felso-rhyoHtes are very often vesicular. The cavities are usuaUy&nbsp;lined with opal and tridymite; in the older rocks they may&nbsp;be fiUed with agate and chalcedony. The “ mill-stone&nbsp;porphyries,” extensiveIy used in Germany for grinding corn,&nbsp;are porous rhyoHtes; the abundance of quartz makes them&nbsp;hard, and their rough surfaces render them pecuHarly suitable&nbsp;for this purpose. In some of them the cavities are partly&nbsp;secondary. These rocks are obtained in the Odenwald, Thur-ingerwald and Fichtelgebirge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In. Britain a pale grey Tertiary rhyolite occurs at Tardree, Antrim (the only British rock containing tridymite), and in Skye.&nbsp;Felsitic'rhyolites occur among the Old Red rocks of Scotland (Pent-land Hills, Lome, &amp;c.), in Devonshire, and in large numbers in North&nbsp;Walcs<sub>l</sub> The Carnarvonshire rhyoHtes are often much altered and&nbsp;silicified; many of them have a nodular structure which is very&nbsp;conspicuous on weathered surfaces. The spheroids may be two&nbsp;or three inches in diameter; some of them are built up of concentric shells. Rhyolites are also known from Fishguard, Malvern,&nbsp;Westmorland and Co. Waterford. One of the oldest volcanic&nbsp;rocks of Britain (pre-Cambrian, Uriconian) is the Spherulitic&nbsp;rhyolite of the Lea Rock near Wellington in Shropshire. It shows&nbsp;bright red spheralites in great numbers and is probably an obsidian&nbsp;completely aevitrified. Perlitic structure is also visible in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In other parts of Europe rhyolites have a fairly wide distribution though they are not very numerous. In Hungary (Hlinik, &amp;c.)&nbsp;there are many well-known examples of this class. They extend&nbsp;along the margin of the Carpathians and are found also in Siebenbürgen. In Italy they occur in the Eugancan Hills and in the&nbsp;Lipari Islands; the latter being the principal source of pumice at&nbsp;the present day. Rhyolites of Recent age occur in Iceland&nbsp;(Myvatn, &amp;c.), where they are characterized by the frequent absence&nbsp;of quartz, and the presence of much plagioclase and pyroxene.&nbsp;Some of these rocks have been called trachyte-obsidians, but they&nbsp;seem to be rhyolites which contain an exceptionally large amount&nbsp;of soda. The older rhyolites, which are generally called quartz-porphyries in Germany, are mostly of Permian or Carboniferous&nbsp;age and are numerous in the Vosges, Odenwald, Thuringerwald, &amp;c.&nbsp;They are often accompanied by basic rocks (melaphyres). Permian&nbsp;rhyolites occur also at Lugano in Italy. RhyoHtes are known also&nbsp;in Asia Minor and the Caucasus, in New Zealand, Colorado, Nevada&nbsp;and other parts of western North America. In the Yellowstone&nbsp;National Park there is a well-known cliff of obsidian which shows&nbsp;remarkably perfect columnar jointing. Some of the rhyolites of&nbsp;Nevada are exceedingly rich in porphyritic minerals, so that they&nbsp;appear at first sight to be. holocry Stalline rocks, since the ground-mass is scanty and inconspicuous. To this type the name nevadite&nbsp;has been given, but it is rare and local in its distribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">in the island of Pantellaria, which lies to the south-west of Sicily, there are rocks of rhyolitic affinities which present so many unusual&nbsp;features that they have been designated pantellarites. They&nbsp;contain less silica and alumina and more alkalis and iron than do&nbsp;ordinary rhyolites. Their felspars are of the anorthoclase group,&nbsp;being rich in soda together with potash, and are very variable&nbsp;in crystalline development. Aeginne-augite and forms of soda-amphibole are also characteristic of these rocks: dark brown&nbsp;aenigmatite or cossyrite often occur in them. Quartz is not very&nbsp;plentiful ; other ingredients are olivine, arfvedsonite and tridymite.&nbsp;The ground-mass varies much, being sometimes quite vitreous,&nbsp;at other times a glass filled with swarms of microliths, while in&nbsp;certain pantellarites it is a microcrystalHne aggregate of quartz&nbsp;and alkali felspar. The absence of plagioclase and biotite are&nbsp;marked distinctions between these rocks and the rhyolites, together&nbsp;with the scarcity of quartz and the prevalence of soda-bearing&nbsp;pyroxenes and amphiboles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Among the Palaeozoic volcanic rocks of Germany there is a group of lavas, the quartz-keratophyres, which are of acid composition&nbsp;and rich in alkali felspar. Their dominant alkali is soda: hence&nbsp;their felspars are albite and Cryptoperthite, not sanidine as in&nbsp;rhyolites. Quartz occurs sometimes as corroded phenocrysts,&nbsp;but is.often scarce even in the ground-mass. Porphyritic biotite&nbsp;or augite are very rare, but occur in the matrix along with felspars&nbsp;and quartz. Micropegmatite is not infrequent in these rocks, and&nbsp;they may be. silicified like the rhyolites. As quartz-keratophyres&nbsp;mostly occur in districts where there has been a good deal of folding,&nbsp;they are often crushed and more or less sericitized. They are best&nbsp;known from the Devonian rocks of Westphalia and the Harz,&nbsp;but are also found in. Queensland, and similar rocks have been&nbsp;described (as soda-f el sites) from Ireland. The rocks which they&nbsp;accompany are usually diabases and spilites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The other group of rhyolitic rocks rich in alkali felspars and soda pyroxenes and amphiboles are the comendites. They are often&nbsp;porphyritic, with crystals of quartz, sanidine, microperthite or&nbsp;albite: the ground-mass is microcrystalHne or rarely micrographie,&nbsp;and often filled with spongy growths of aegirine and riebeckite.&nbsp;They are known from the recent eruptive districts of East Africa,&nbsp;from Sardinia and Texas, and very similar rocks occur as intrusive&nbsp;masses which may be grouped with the porphyries.</span></p>
