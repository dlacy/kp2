<p><span class="font1">as enable the workman, with an easy stoop, to swing the scythe blade along the ground, the cutting edge being slightly elevated to&nbsp;keep it clear of the inequalities of the surface. The grain-reaping&nbsp;scythe is similar, but provided with a cradle or short gathering rake&nbsp;attached to the heel and following the direction of the blade for&nbsp;about 12 in. The object of this attachment is to gather the&nbsp;stalks as they are cut and lay them in regular swaths against&nbsp;the line of still-standing corn. The reaping scythe, instead of a&nbsp;long sned, has frequently two helves, the right hand branching&nbsp;from the left or main helve and the two handles placed about 2 ft.&nbsp;apart. The best scythe blades are made from rolled sheets of&nbsp;steel, riveted to a back frame of iron, which gives strength and&nbsp;rigidity to the blade. On the continent of Europe it is still common&nbsp;to mould and hammer the whole blade out of a single piece of steel,&nbsp;but such scythes are difficult to keep keen of edge. There is a great&nbsp;demand for scythes in Russia, chiefly supplied from the German&nbsp;empire and Austria. The principal manufacturing centre of scythes&nbsp;and sickles in the United Kingdom is Sheffield.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It was not until the beginning of the 19th century that any attempt was made to invent a reaping machine on anything like&nbsp;the lines that have been adopted since. In 1826 the Rev.&nbsp;Patrick Bell of Carmylie in Fifeshirc brought out the first succcss-ful machine. He had worked at the making of it when a young&nbsp;man on his father’s farm, and the principle he adopted, that of a&nbsp;series of scissors fastened on the “ knife-board,&quot; was followed&nbsp;for a long time. There had been many trials during the thirty&nbsp;or forty years before his time both in this country and in America,&nbsp;but his invention was the first practical success.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">After many modifications, however, the present or recent form of the common reaper was evolved by C. H. McCormick in&nbsp;America in 1831. A truck or carriage is carried on two travelling&nbsp;wheels some 30 to 36 in. high, with spuds or teeth on the&nbsp;circumference to make them “ bite ’’ the ground and thus give&nbsp;motion to the machinery without skidding; two horses are&nbsp;yoked in front with a pole between, with martingale and&nbsp;surcingle belts as part of their harness, to ease the backing of the&nbsp;machine by the horses; the knife-board is fixed out at right&nbsp;angles to the side of the carriage and in front, while the knives&nbsp;consist of a series of triangular “sections’’ on a bar which&nbsp;travels backwards and forwards in slots in the “ fingers,’’ as the&nbsp;dividing teeth are called. The motion was given to the knives&nbsp;by a connecting rod and crank driven by suitable gearing from&nbsp;the truck wheels. The cutting was thus done by a straight&nbsp;shearing action and not by clipping like scissors as in Bell’s&nbsp;machine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There were many modifications tried before the favourite form was ultimately adopted: thus the horses were yoked&nbsp;behind the truck or carriage of the machine so that they pushed&nbsp;it before them; a revolving web of cloth was placed behind the&nbsp;knives so as to deliver the cut corn in a continuous swathe at&nbsp;the side; revolving “ sails ” or “ rakes ” pushed the standing&nbsp;grain against the knives as the machine advanced—some of&nbsp;which arrangements have been revived in our modem string-binders—and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the early days—from about 1860 to 1870—machines were fitted with a tilting board behind the cutting bar which caught&nbsp;the com as it fell, and it was held there until enough for a sheaf&nbsp;was gathered, when the load was “ tilted ” off by a suitable rake&nbsp;handled by a man who sat and worked the tilting board simultaneously with his foot and dropped the com, to be lifted and&nbsp;tied into a sheaf by hand afterwards. The same machine was&nbsp;generally used for mowing (grass) by an interchange of parts,&nbsp;and the “ combined ’’ reaper and mower was in common use in&nbsp;the ’seventies and ’eighties. Later, various devices were adopted&nbsp;to do the tilting or sheafing mechanically, and the self end-delivery and self side-delivery have long been in use whereby&nbsp;through the adoption of revolving rakes on frames the sheaf-lots&nbsp;are delivered in sizes ready for tying up by hand. The subse-quent tying or binding was done variously in different parts of&nbsp;the country. In the south of England it was customary for&nbsp;five men to make bands, lift the sheaf-lot, place in the band and&nbsp;tic, and leave the sheaf lying on the ground to be set up afterwards, the gang of five being expected to keep up on a reaper&nbsp;cutting round the four sides of a field. In the north and in&nbsp;Scotland the cutting was only done on one side at a time, the&nbsp;machine riding back empty, and three boys made the bands&nbsp;(“ straps ’’), three women lifted the lots and laid them on the&nbsp;bands, and three men bound the sheaves and set up in stooks.&nbsp;Thus three gangs of three each were required to keep a machine&nbsp;going, and only about five acres per day could be reaped in this&nbsp;way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The development of the modern binder to reduce all this labour has been a very gradual process. There was no great&nbsp;difficulty in cutting the corn and delivering the stuff, but the&nbsp;tying of it into sheaves was the problem to be solved. As early&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">as </span><span class="font2">1858 Marsh in America designed and carried out an arrangement whereby the cut grain crop was caught on revolving webs&nbsp;of canvas and carried up on to a table, where two men stood&nbsp;who made bands of its own material and bound it into sheaves&nbsp;as it fell in front of them, dropping the sheaves off on to* the&nbsp;ground as made, while the machine travelled along. The&nbsp;invention of a tying apparatus was the next advance, and in the&nbsp;’seventies the American firm of Walter A. Wood &amp; Co. brought&nbsp;out an arrangement for tying the sheaves up with wire. So&nbsp;slow and expensive had been the process of evolution, however,&nbsp;that it was reported at the time that the above firm had spent&nbsp;£ 20,000 in invention and experiment before they had even a&nbsp;wire-binder fit to put on the market.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Binding with string, however, was the aim of&nbsp;all, and it was reserved&nbsp;for J. F. Appleby, an&nbsp;English inventor, to hit&nbsp;on the arrangement now&nbsp;in use, or whiςh was the&nbsp;prototype of all the knot-ters now to be met with&nbsp;in different varieties of the string-binder throughout the&nbsp;world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">While the string-binder is now in universal use in Great Britain, the British Colonies, America and all countries where&nbsp;farming and farm work are advanced, and hand labour is only&nbsp;followed where peasant-farming or small farming obtains, it&nbsp;must be noted that in certain regions the system of reaping or&nbsp;harvesting of corn crops has developed a good deal beyond&nbsp;this. In Australia and some of the hotter districts in the west&nbsp;of the United States the “ stripper ’’ is in use, an implement&nbsp;which carries long grooved teeth which are passed through the&nbsp;standing grain crop and strip off the heads, leaving the straw&nbsp;standing. The heads are passed backwards to a thrashing&nbsp;(rubbing) arrangement, which separates the com from the&nbsp;chobs, chaff, &amp;c., and the grain is sacked up straight away. The&nbsp;sacks are dropped off the machine as the work proceeds and are&nbsp;picked up by wagon for transport afterwards. It is a significant&nbsp;fact that strippers worked by hand, though pushed through&nbsp;the crop by oxen, were in use on the plains of Gaul in the first</span></p>
