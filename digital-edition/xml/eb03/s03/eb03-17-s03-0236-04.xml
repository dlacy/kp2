an officer who, by his maſter’s orders, writes letters, diſpatches, and other inſtruments, which he renders authentic by his ſignet. Of theſe there are ſeveral kinds; as, 1. Secretaries of ſtate, who are officers that have under their management and direction the moſt important affairs of the kingdom, and are obliged conſtantly to attend on the king: they receive and diſpatch whatever comes to their hands, either from the crown, the church, the army, private grants, pardons, diſpenſations, &amp;c. as likewiſe petitions to the ſovereign, which, when read, are returned to them; all which they diſpatch according to the king’s direction. They have authority to commit perſons for treaſon, and other offences againſt the ſtate, as conſervators of the peace at common law, or as juſtices of the peace throughout the kingdom. They are members of the privy-council, which is ſeldom or never held without one of them being preſent. As to the buſineſs and correſpondence in all parts of this kingdom, it is managed by either of the ſecretaries without any diſtinction; but with reſpect to foreign affairs, the buſineſs is divided into two provinces or departments, the ſouthern and the northern, comprehending all the kingdoms and ſtates that have any intercourſe with Great Britain; each ſecretary receiving all letters and addreſſes from, and making all diſpatches to, the ſeveral princes and ſtates comprehended in his province. Ireland and the Plantations are under the direction of the elder ſecretary, who has the ſouthern province, which alio comprehends France, Italy, Switzerland, Spain, Portugal, and Turkey; the northern province includes the Low Coun-<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0243.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0237"/>
tries, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Poland, and Muſcovy. Each of the ſecretaries has an apartment in all the royal houſes, both for their own accommodation and their officers; they have alſo a table at the king’s charge, or elfe board-wages. The two ſecretaries for Britain have each two under ſecretaries, and one chief clerk; with an uncertain number of other clerks and tranſlators, all wholly depending on them. To the ſecretaries of ſtate belong the cuſtody of that ſeal properly called the ſignet, and the direction of two other offices, one called the <hi rend="italic">paper-office,</hi> and the other the <hi rend="italic">ſignet office.</hi> In addition to theſe, there is at preſent (1795) a ſecretary for the war department, whoſe office muſt be temporary. 2. Secretary of an embaſſy, a perſon attending an ambaſſador, for writing diſpatches relating to the negociation. There is a great difference between the ſecretary of an embaſſy and the ambaſſador’s ſecretary; the laſt being a domeſtic or menial of the ambaſſador, and the firſt a fervant or miniſter of the prince. 3. The ſecretary of war, an officer of the war-office, who has two chief clerks under him, the laſt of which is the ſecretary’s meſſenger. There are alſo ſecretaries in moſt of the other offices.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
