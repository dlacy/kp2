The tide, which flows a little above Stirling, renders it navigable to that town for vessels of 70 tons. Below Stirling the river winds in a remarkable manner across its valley, making so little progress, that, following its course to Alloa, the distance from Stirling Bridge is about 16 miles, while in a direct line it is scarcely seven. These windings are called the <hi rend="italic">Links</hi> of the Forth. Two miles above Alloa it receives the Devon from the north-east. Below Alloa it expands into the large estuary called the Firth of Forth, which washes the north-eastern side of the county, till it meets with Linlithgowshire, a little to the south of Grangemouth. Next in importance, and the only other stream worthy of particular notice, is the Carron, which, rising in the interior, pursues an easterly course, and joins the Firth of Forth at Grangemouth. It is navigable for vessels of 200 tons as far as the village of Carron Shore, the shipping place of the Carron Company, nearly two miles from its confluence with the Forth. Besides Lochlomond, of which the greater part is in Dunbartonshire, several small pieces of water occur in different parts, none of them remarkable. Salmon are caught in the Forth, and also in Lochlomond, and in 1839 the fishery afforded a revenue of L.650 a year to the town of Stirling. Formerly the salmon-fishings were let as high as L.1400, part of which belonged to another proprietor.</p><p>The valued rent of Stirlingshire is L.108,509. 3s. 3d. Scots, and the real rent of the lands and houses in 1815 was L.218,761. sterling. In 1811 the number of estates was 117, of which 109 were below L.500 Scots, and only nine above L.2000 of valuation, thus indicating that the landed property was much divided ; and not a fourth of the whole was entailed, a smaller proportion than in most parts of Scotland. The estates of the duke of Montrose, Lord Dundas, Sir Charles Edmonstonc, Mr Forbes of Callendar, Mr Murray of Polmaise, the principal proprietors, are rented at from L.6000 to L.14,000, and several others are worth from L.1000 to L.4000 a year ; but the greater number are below L.1000. Some of the proprietors have increased the value of their estates by means of embankments on the Firth of Forth. Several hundred acres, many <hi rend="italic">of</hi> them worth as high a rent as any in the county, have thus been reclaimed and brought into cultivation, and a great deal more may be gained in the same manner. All the small proprietors, and most of the great ones, reside upon their estates ; and several of the latter occupy considerable farms of their own, which they have improved, and continue to cιdtivate in a very judicious manner. There is accordingly a great number of seats over all the lower parts of the county. Before the union between Scotland and England, considerable tracts were granted to the retainers and dependants, or the tenants, of the principal proprietors, and their heirs, for ever ; subject only to the payment of the rent of those times, which is now very trifling. These are called <hi rend="italic">feuars</hi> or <hi rend="italic">portioned.,</hi> and in some parishes, especially Denny, form a pretty numerous class.</p><p>There is a good deal of both natural and planted wood in Stirlingshire, about 13,000 acres of the former, and 10,000 of the latter ; and much of the former, in the state of coppice, has long yielded a regular income to the proprietors, little if at all inferior to the average rent of the arable land. The Buchanan woods, belonging to the duke of Montrose, seem to be under very regular management, being divided into twenty-four <hi rend="italic">hags</hi> or portions, of which one is cut every year. About twenty-five years ago, this produced from L.16 to L.24 the Scots acre, after leaving a number of <hi rend="italic">reserves</hi> to stand for timber. Every acre gives at a medium about one ton and a half of bark, which, during the late war, sold at L.18; and the small timber generally pays expenses. This does not now hold true, as bark does not bring above L.7. Much of the land on which this wood grows is of little value for any other purpose ; not worth half a crown an acre. On the same estate, and also in other parts of the county, extensive plantations have been formed within the last seventy years.</p><p>The mountainous parts of Stirlingshire are occupied with sheep of the black-faced or heath breed, but of late years many Cheviot and other breeds have been introduced ; and the lower bills by Highland cattle ; and there the farms are necessarily of considerable extent. The arable land, how ever, is for the most part divided into small farms, especially the Carse lands on the Forth, where the general size does not exceed from 40 to 100 or perhaps 120 acres.</p><p>The agriculture of this county, which a few years ago was in a very inferior condition, is now ( 1840) in the highest state of improvement. Stirlingshire farmers and farm-servants are anxiously sought after in every part of the united kingdom. Landed proprietors even in East Lothian and Berwickshire, where farming had long been managed in a very spirited manner, and with decided success, have latterly confessed that an inoculation of Stirlingshire farming would prove highly beneficial to the agriculture of those counties. For the attainment of this confessed superiority, Stirlingshire is indebted to a variety of favourable circumstances, to which we shall now shortly advert in quite a practical manner, as the theory has already been submitted to our readers in the article upon <hi rend="smallcaps">Agriculture.</hi> Among these circumstances may be chiefly noticed the Deanston or thorough-draining system, the subsoil or deep ploughing system, and the encouragement given to both by many of the landed proprietors. But before proceeding to state these circumstances, we may premise, that had not the farmers in this county been morally prepared to admit innovation, and to follow’ good example, these improvements, like many others equally beneficial in various departments of practical knowledge, must have fallen to the ground, to be again resuscitated and pressed upon public attention in more auspicious times. It is therefore to the zeal and indefatigable industry, stimulated by enlarged notions alike of public and private interest, and exercised by Stirlingshire formers, that we and the whole empire have to congratulate ourselves upon those immense improvements in agriculture, which are enabling a small, and, generally speaking, a sterile country, to support a rapidly increasing population, while at the same time we regret to add, that those very farmers are, notwithstanding these improvements, scarcely able to maintain their position, in consequence of the depreciated and still depreciating value of the products of arable husbandry.</p><p>This admirable system, which was either invented by Mr Smith of the Deanston Works, or by him carried to the highest state of perfection, consists in running longitudinal cuts or drains to the depth of three feet, or at least two and a half, parallel to the ridges of the field, taking care that at the lower extremity they all terminate in a main drain running at right angles to the other drains, and which must at least be six or twelve inches deeper than the longitudinal or proper drains for the field. This cross drain is technically called the “ main and, besides its greater depth, it should otherwise be more capacious, that it may with ease carry off the accumulated w aters of the whole or greater part of the field. When the farm is drained wholly at the expense of the farmer, the main is frequently left open, although he incurs a considerable loss of ground, and some expense annually for clearing it out. The best mode of covering is to form an arch both below and above, or, in other words, make a cylinder of it. The building may be either with or without mortar ; but with mortar it is much more durable, and leaves a smoother run for the water. The drain or main is sometimes covered with flag-stones, and soil to the depth of eighteen inches laid over all, bringing it to the level of the field; and so nothing is lost, but something gained. It must however be confessed that this pro</p></body></text></TEI>
