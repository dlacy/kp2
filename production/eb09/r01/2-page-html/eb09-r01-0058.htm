At 60 miles per hour the required tractive force is about&nbsp;45 lb for 1 ton of gross weight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Carriages and Waggons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">is </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The common varieties of vehicle employed in railway traffic are as follows :—(1) Passenger-train stock : first-class carriage, second-class carriage, third-class carriage, composite carriage, luggage&nbsp;brake-van, horse-box, carriage-truck. To these may be added the&nbsp;mail - carriage or travelling post-office. (2) Goods-train stock:&nbsp;platform-waggon, open or box waggon, high-sided round-end waggon, covered goods - waggon, cattle - waggon, sheep - waggon, coal-waggon, coke-waggon, brake-van. Besides these there are other&nbsp;waggons specially designed for special traffic, as gunpowder, salt,&nbsp;and lime, also ballast-waggons, for the private use of the engineer’s&nbsp;department. Carriages are usually made of the same external&nbsp;length, width, and height. The under works of the stock may&nbsp;thus be identical in construction, and an economical uniformity of&nbsp;working and wearing parts is secured. Uniformity of waggons is&nbsp;still more important than in the case of carnages, as their total&nbsp;number and cost are much greater, and the supervision with which&nbsp;they are favoured is less minute ; besides, the cost of maintenance&nbsp;is less than where many varieties of waggon exist on the same line. ·&nbsp;But, whatever may be the upper works, the under works of the&nbsp;whole of the waggon stock should be entirely uniform. One of the&nbsp;greatest evils of railway engineering has been want of uniformity&nbsp;in stock, partly due to different companies not arranging to have&nbsp;stock suitable for joint use on each other’s lines and partly to&nbsp;inevitable changes of plan to meet the growing wants of traffic.&nbsp;Another source of mischief was the separation of the duties of&nbsp;engine and of carriage and waggon superintendence. The carriage&nbsp;superintendent, aiming at the utmost economy of maintenance in&nbsp;his department, continually added to the quantity and weight of&nbsp;material employed in the construction of the carrying stock, as the&nbsp;remedy for the observed failure of weak parts ; and thus the stock,&nbsp;particularly waggons, was increased in strength rather by adding&nbsp;to the mass of matter than by studying to throw the same weight&nbsp;of timber and iron into superior combinations. Meantime the&nbsp;heavy trains, handed over to the locomotive department, led to&nbsp;the construction of heavier and more powerful locomotives, when&nbsp;the maximum was quickly reached, and strongly evinced by the&nbsp;damage done to the permanent way. It was found, moreover,&nbsp;that the older carriages suffered most in cases of collision ; hence&nbsp;there was an additional inducement to add to the size and weight&nbsp;of carriages. But this line of development has been mainly determined by the demands of the public for greater convenience, speed,&nbsp;and safety, and from the growth of traffic, involving greater length&nbsp;and weight of trains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The early first-class carriages weighed 3£ tons, the bodies or upper parts being 15 feet long, 6| feet wide, and 4 feet 9 inches&nbsp;high, divided into three compartments, to hold six passengers&nbsp;each, or eighteen in all. They now weigh from 8 to 13 tons each,&nbsp;and are from 20 to 30 feet in length and from 8 to 8^ feet wide.&nbsp;Carriages have until recent years been placed almost all on four&nbsp;wheels ; but six wheels on three axles are now generally in use.&nbsp;A modern first-class carriage, 28 to 30 feet long with four compartments, gives 7 to 7i feet of total length for each compartment, as&nbsp;against 5 feet in the early carriages. Second and third class&nbsp;carriages, in length from 28 to 31 feet, are divided into five compartments, each from 5 feet 7 inches to 6 feet 2 inches long.&nbsp;Saloon carriages are occasionally used, so called because two or&nbsp;more of the ordinary compartments are merged in one. Second-class carriages originally were destitute of cushioning, hard and&nbsp;square, on the nearly obsolete policy of making them uncomfortable in the hope of inducing passengers to travel first class. The&nbsp;London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway Company in 1857-58&nbsp;were the first to supply comfortably padded seats in their second-class carriages, and the receipts of that company were in 1858&nbsp;materially augmented in consequence. Third-class carriages have&nbsp;been improved, under the stimulating example of the Midland&nbsp;Railway Company, who abandoned their second-class carriages,&nbsp;and raised their third-class stock to an equality with the second-class vehicles of other lines. But there are yet lines of railway&nbsp;on which the third-class carriages are little better than obsolete&nbsp;first and second class carriages converted into third-class.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Passenger luggage brake-vans are made open (for the most part) inside for passengers’ luggage. They are fitted with a dog-box or&nbsp;small enclosure from side to side with doors at both ends, and&nbsp;with projecting sides, glazed, to accommodate the guard and afford&nbsp;a view<sup>r</sup> of the train from end to end. A pair of doors are placed in&nbsp;each side for luggage. In some designs a separate compartment is&nbsp;partitioned off for the guard, in other cases a compartment of a&nbsp;passenger carriage is allotted for luggage and for the guard. The&nbsp;luggage van is fitted with a powerful brake; it should be fitted&nbsp;with three pairs of wheels. Horse-boxes are constructed to carry&nbsp;three horses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The long double-bogie passenger-car universally in use in the United States, originally introduced by Ross &quot;VVinans on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, is distinguished essentially from the&nbsp;carriages on British railways by the longitudinal passage in the&nbsp;centre of the body, reaching from end to end of the car, with seats&nbsp;at each side, and admitting of the free passage of the conductor&nbsp;throughout the train. The absence of doors at the sides permits&nbsp;of the enlargement of the body laterally. These cars are also distinguished by the use of two four-wheeled bogies or trucks on which&nbsp;the body is carried, and to which it is pivoted, allowing the car&nbsp;to pass with facility over quick curves. There is generally but one&nbsp;class of travellers; yet for the long journeys Pullman and other sleeping cars have come into use, at extra fares. From the Atlantic cities&nbsp;to the West there is a special “immigrant” class, as also over the&nbsp;Pacific railroads; and between the chief Western cities and the seaboard of late years a second-class system has been begun: passengers&nbsp;are usually carried in smoking cars at rates but little lower than first-class fares, which on these lines are about Id. per mile. Refreshment cars are also attached to trains. Ordinary passenger cars are&nbsp;9| to 10 feet wide and 44$ in length of body, or 49 feet over the&nbsp;extreme platforms. They are about 7$ feet high at the sides, inside&nbsp;the body, and nearly 10 feet high at the centre. The car is entered&nbsp;by steps at the ends. The middle passage is about 2 feet vdde.&nbsp;On each side there are fourteen seats, placed transversely, each 38&nbsp;inches wide and holding two persons. The backs of the seats,&nbsp;which do not rise more than 34 inches above the floor, are mounted&nbsp;on swivels, by which the seat is made reversible. A window is&nbsp;placed next each seat, having a movable glass and a Venetian blind.&nbsp;The cars are heated by stoves or steam heaters, burning coal, and&nbsp;are lighted by oil-lamps or candles, on some lines by compressed&nbsp;coal-gas. Each car is provided with a water-closet and a supply of&nbsp;iced v<sup>r</sup>ater, and a vendor of books, papers, and cigars patrols the&nbsp;cars. There is a cord of communication with the engine-driver.&nbsp;The car, complete, weighs from 17 to 20 tons, and sleeping cars&nbsp;about one-half more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The form of goods truck generally used for some years after the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway in 1829 was&nbsp;simply a platform about 10 feet long, on four wheels, with sides&nbsp;varying from 4 to 10 inches in height, weighing from 2£ to 3|&nbsp;tons. Many such waggons were employed for transporting heavy&nbsp;rough goods of 2 tons weight. The general unfitness of this style&nbsp;of waggon led to the adoption of portable sides and ends, which&nbsp;consisted of open crib-rails dropped into staples ; and to these&nbsp;was added the costly tarpauling or sheet to cover the goods and&nbsp;bind them down. The waggon thus appointed, 13 or 14 feet in&nbsp;length and weighing about 3£ tons, was fit to carry 4 or 5 tons&nbsp;of ordinary goods. But loose or removable parts of waggons are&nbsp;liable to be lost or get out of order, and are costly to maintain,&nbsp;while a new tarpauling may be spoiled on the first day of using it&nbsp;by injury from projecting angles of goods under cover. Crib-rails&nbsp;and tarpaulings, therefore, have been to some extent superseded&nbsp;by built covered waggons from 14 to 16 feet long and </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">7\</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> feet wide,&nbsp;with sliding or hinged doors and roofs, so that with the crane-chairs a bale of goods, however heavy, can be deposited at or&nbsp;moved from any part of the interior of the waggon, and the goods&nbsp;may be pei’fectly enclosed and protected from damage by fire,&nbsp;wind, or rain. Covered waggons weigh from 4 to 6| tons, and&nbsp;they can carry, according to their dimensions, from 6 to 8 tons&nbsp;of goods. The cost of maintenance of ordinary open waggons is&nbsp;said to amount to from 7 to 10 per cent of the first cost, whilst&nbsp;that of covered waggons is said to be only 4 per cent. It may&nbsp;be stated generally that waggons if properly made will carry&nbsp;60 per cent, more than their own weight of goods, but that ill-designed badly-made waggons will carry no more than their&nbsp;own weight of goods. The great demand for weight in waggons&nbsp;arose, as much as from anything else, from the absence of sprin״-buffers at the ends, which exposed them daily to rude and trying&nbsp;collisions. By and by buffing-springs were introduced at one end&nbsp;of the waggon, the other being left “ dead, ” and at length, cheap&nbsp;and convenient buffers having been devised, springs came to be&nbsp;placed at both ends of new stock. &quot;Waggons, as formerly made,&nbsp;were .in long trains likewise subjected to violent shocks in starting&nbsp;into motion, and therefore the draw-bars also were placed upon&nbsp;springs. Some companies have gone further and placed the guard&nbsp;or side chains upon springs. Thus the waggon has come to be&nbsp;defended by springs at all points, and there is no doubt that the&nbsp;extra cost so incurred has been amply covered by savings on repairs&nbsp;and diminished breakages of goods. Spiral springs for buffing and&nbsp;drawing, made of round or of oval steel, fixed externally to the&nbsp;ends of waggons, have been much employed ; but laminated springs,&nbsp;placed under the floor, are taking their place. Broad-gauge (7-feet&nbsp;gauge) waggons have been constructed sufficiently strong to carry&nbsp;20 tons of load on six wheels; but they were not generally made&nbsp;to carry more than 10 tons. Even 10 tons is considered in some&nbsp;quarters to be excessive as a maximum waggon-load on the ordinary&nbsp;or 4 feet 8£ inch gauge. On the Midland Railway, for instance,&nbsp;the standard coal - waggon is constructed to carry 8 tons. The</span></p>
