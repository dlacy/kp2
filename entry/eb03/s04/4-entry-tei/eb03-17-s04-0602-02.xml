(Antonio de), an ingenious Spaniſh writer, of an ancient and illuſtrious family, born at Piacenza in Old Caſtile, in 1610. He was intended for the law ; but his inclination toward poetry prevailed, and he cultivated it with great ſucceſs. Philip IV. of Spain made him one of his ſecretaries ; and after his death the queen-regent appointed him hiſtoriographer of the Indies, a place of great profit and honour : his Hiſtory of the Conqueſt of Mexico ſhows that ſhe could not have named a fitter perſon. He is better known by this hiſtory at leaſt abroad, than by his poetry and dramatic writings, though in theſe he was alſo diſtinguiſhed. He turned prieſt at 57 years of age, and died in 1686.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
