a market-town of Worcestershire, England, stands on an eminence on the south bank of the Stour, and on the Great Western Railway, on the borders of Staffordshire, 4 miles south-west of Dudley and 10 west of Birmingham. A branch canal connects the town with the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal. The Stour is crossed by a railway viaduct erected in 1882 at a cost of &amp;lt;£13,835. The town possesses a corn exchange, a mechanics’ institute, an Edward VI. grammar school, a Government school of art, and a blue-coat or hospital school. The manufacture of glass was established in 1556 by emigrants from Hungary, the place where they erected their manufactory being still known as Hungary Hill. Valuable fire-clay is obtained in the neighbourhood, and a great variety of fine bricks are made. There are also large iron and leather works. The town was originally called Bedcote, a name which the manor still retains. The population of the urban sanitary district (area 450 acres) in 1871 was 9376, and in 1881 it was 9757.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
