Her husband, François of Orleans-Longueville, marquis de Rothelin, died in 1548, and in watching her son’s interests in Neuchâtel she was brought into contact with the reformers in Switzerland. She then embraced Protestantism and turned her château at Blandy, in Brie, into a refuge for Huguenots. In 1567 she underwent a term of imprisonment at the Louvre for harbouring Protestants.</p>
