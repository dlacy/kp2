or <hi rend="smallcaps">Stonehaven,</hi> a ſmall town in the county of Kincardine, in Scotland, 15 miles ſouth from Aberdeen. It was built in the time of Charles II. and ſtands at the foot of ſome high cliffs, in a ſmall bay, with a rocky bottom, opening a little in one part, ſo that ſmall veſſels may find admittance, but only at high water. A pier laps over this harbour from the north side to ſecure them after their entrance. The town contains about 800 inhabitants. The manufactures are sail-cloths and Oſnaburghs, knit worſted and thread stockings.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
