<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Christian Rome </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">From the 4th to the 12th Century</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The era of church building in Rome may be said to begin with the reign of Constantine and the peace of the church.&nbsp;Before then Christian worship was conducted with various&nbsp;degrees of secrecy either in private houses or in the catacombs&nbsp;(g.ti.), according as the reigning emperor viewed the sect with&nbsp;tolerance or dislike. The type of church which in the beginning&nbsp;of the 4th century was adopted with certain modifications from&nbsp;the pagan basilica, though varying much in size, had little&nbsp;or no variety in its general form and arrangement. One fixed&nbsp;model was strictly adhered to for many centuries, and, in spite&nbsp;of numberless alterations and additions, can be traced in nearly&nbsp;all the ancient churches of Rome. It is fully described and&nbsp;illustrated in the article Basilica.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The walls of these early churches were mostly built of concrete, faced with brick, left structurally quite plain, and decorated only&nbsp;with painted stucco or glass mosaics—especially (internally) in the apse and on the face of its arch, and (externally)&nbsp;on the east or entrance wall, the top of which was often&nbsp;built in an overhanging curve to keep off the rain. The windows&nbsp;were plain, with semicircular arches, and were filled with pierced&nbsp;marble screens, or in some cases with slabs of translucent alabaster;&nbsp;the latter was the case at S. Lorenzo fuori le Mura, and examples&nbsp;of the former still exist in the very early church formed in the rooms&nbsp;of some thermae on the Esquilme (possibly those of Trajan), below&nbsp;the 6th-century church of S. Martino ai Monti. Almost the only&nbsp;bit of external architectural ornament was the eaves cornice,&nbsp;frequently (as at the last-named church) formed of marble cornices&nbsp;stolen from earlier classical buildings. Internally the nave columns,&nbsp;with their capitals and bases, were usually taken from some classical&nbsp;building, and some churches are perfect museums of fine sculptured&nbsp;caps and rich marble shafts of every material and design.<sup>@@1</sup> At first&nbsp;thè nave had no arches, the columns supporting a horizontal&nbsp;entablature, as in old St Peter’s, S. Clemente, and S. Maria Maggiore,&nbsp;but afterwards, in order to widen the intercolumniation, simple&nbsp;round arches of narrow span were introduced, thus requiring fewer&nbsp;columns. The roof was of the simple tie-beam and kingpost construction, left open, but decorated with painting or metal plates.&nbsp;The floor was paved either with coarse mosaic of large tesserae (as&nbsp;at S. Pudentiana) or with slabs of marble stripped from ancient&nbsp;■buildings. A later development of this plan added a small apse&nbsp;containing an altar at the end of each aisle, as in S. Maria in Cosmedin</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">and S. Pietro in Vincoli.<sup>@@2</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The type of church above described was used as a model for by far the majority of early churches not only in Rome, but also in&nbsp;England, France, Germany, and other Western countries.&nbsp;Another form was, however, occasionally used in Rome,&nbsp;which appears to have been derived from the round temple&nbsp;of pagan times. This is a circular building, usually domed and&nbsp;surrounded with one or more rings of pillared aisles. To this class&nbsp;belong the combined church and mausoleum of Costanza'(see fig. 14)&nbsp;and that of SS. Marcellinus and Petrus, both built by Constantine,&nbsp;the former to hold the tomb of his daughters Constantia (or Con-stantina) and Helena, the latter that of his mother Helena. The&nbsp;latter is on the Via Labicana, about 2 m. outside Rome; it is a&nbsp;circular domed building, now known as the Torre Pignattara, from&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pignatte</span><span class="font1"> or amphorae built into the concrete dome to lighten it.&nbsp;The mausoleum of S. Costanza, close by S. Agnese fuori, is also&nbsp;domed, with circular aisle, or rather ambulatory, the vault of the&nbsp;latter decorated with mosaic of classical style (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Mosaic,</span><span class="font1"> voi.&nbsp;xviii. p. 885). The red porphyry sarcophagi, sculptured richly with&nbsp;reliefs, from these mausolea are now in the Vatican. On a much&nbsp;larger scale is the church of S. Stefano Rotondo on the Coelian, built&nbsp;by Pope Simplicius (468-482), with a double ring of pillared aisles,&nbsp;the outer one of which was pulled down and a new enclosure wall&nbsp;built by Nicholas V. Other round churches are S. Teodoro (by the&nbsp;Vicus Tuscus), restored in the 8th century, and S. Bernardo, which</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">is one of the domed halls of Diocletian’s thermae, consecrated as a church in 1598.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Though the apses and classical columns of the naves in these churches were built at the dates indicated, yet in many cases it is&nbsp;difficult to trace the existence of the ancient walls; the alterations&nbsp;and additions of many centuries have frequently almost wholly&nbsp;concealed the original structure. Except at S. Clemente, the&nbsp;early choir, placed as shown in fig. 26, has invariably been destroyed;&nbsp;the side walls have often been broken through by .the addition of&nbsp;rows of chapels.; and the whole church, both within and without,&nbsp;has been overlaid with the most incongruous architectural features&nbsp;in stucco or stone. The open roof is usually concealed either by a&nbsp;wooden panelled ceiling or by a stucco vault. The throne <sup>@@4</sup> and&nbsp;marble benches in the apse have usually given place to more modern&nbsp;wooden fittings, to suit the later position of the choir, which has&nbsp;always been transferred from the nave to the apse. In many cases&nbsp;the mosaics of the apse and. the columns of the. nave are the only&nbsp;visible remains of the once simple and stately original church.<sup>@@5</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">From 1200 to 1450; and the Papal Palaces</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The 10th and nth centuries in Rome were extraordinarily barren in the production of all branches of the fine arts, even&nbsp;that of architecture; and it was not till the end of&nbsp;the 12th that any important revival began. The 13th&nbsp;century was, however, one of great artistic activity,&nbsp;when an immense number of beautiful works, especially in&nbsp;marble enriched with mosaic, were produced in Rome. This&nbsp;revival, though on different lines, was very similar to the rather&nbsp;later one which took place at Pisa (see Pisano), and, like that,&nbsp;was in great part due to the great artistic talents of one family,—&nbsp;the Cosmati,<sup>@@6</sup> which, for four or five generations, produced&nbsp;skilful architects, sculptors and mosaicists.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
