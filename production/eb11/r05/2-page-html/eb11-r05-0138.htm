<p><span class="font0">It is this political rather than religious spirit which also underlies the repressive attitude of the government, and of the&nbsp;Orthodox Church as the organ of the government,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ktidu.**</span><span class="font0"> towards the various dissident sects </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Raskolniki,</span><span class="font0"> from&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">raskol,</span><span class="font0"> schism), which for more than two centuries past&nbsp;have played an important part in the popular life of Russia,&nbsp;and, since the political developments of the end of the 19th&nbsp;and early years of the 20th century, have tended to do so more&nbsp;and more. To understand the problem of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Raskolniki</span><span class="font0"> it is&nbsp;necessary to bear two things in mind: the fundamental principle&nbsp;of Eastern Orthodoxy as distinct from Western Catholicism,&nbsp;and the practical identification in Russia of the National Church&nbsp;with the National State. The very basis of Orthodoxy is that&nbsp;the Church is by Christ’s ordinance unalterable, that its traditional forms, every one of which is a vehicle of saving grace,&nbsp;were established in the beginning by Christ and his apostles,&nbsp;and that consequently nothing may be added or altered. The&nbsp;trouble began early in the 17th century with the attempt, made&nbsp;in connexion with the printing of the liturgical books, to emend&nbsp;certain ritual details in which there was proved to have been&nbsp;a departure from primitive usage;@@<sup>1</sup> it came to a head under&nbsp;the patriarch Nikon (#.:&gt;.). Under his influence a synod&nbsp;endorsed the changes in 1654; one bishop alone, Paul of&nbsp;Colomna, dissented, and he was deposed, knouted and kept&nbsp;in prison till he died mad. In 1656 the synod anathematized&nbsp;the adherents of the old forms, and the anathema was confirmed&nbsp;by those of 1666 and 1667. To the conservatives, known&nbsp;subsequently as Old Ritualists or Old Believers, this marked&nbsp;the beginning of the reign of Antichrist (was not 666 the number&nbsp;of the Beast?); but they continued the struggle, conservative&nbsp;opposition to the Westernizing policy of the tsars, which was&nbsp;held responsible for the introduction of Polish luxury and Latin&nbsp;heresy, giving it a political as well as a religious character.&nbsp;The rising of the Strelitsi in 1682 all but gave them the victory;&nbsp;the crushing of the rising relegated them definitely to the status&nbsp;of schismatics. They were placed in still completer antagonism&nbsp;to the established Orthodox Church by the innovations of&nbsp;Peter the Great. The Muscovite tsars had pursued them with&nbsp;fire and sword. The Russian emperors, having established themselves as heads of the Church and the Holy Synod as a state&nbsp;department, were not likely willingly to tolerate their existence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Raskol</span><span class="font0"> was threatened with extinction by the gradual dying out of its priests, which led to a further schism within&nbsp;itself, into the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Popovshchina</span><span class="font0"> (with priests) and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bezpopovsh-china</span><span class="font0"> (without priests). The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Popovsti,</span><span class="font0"> who were served by&nbsp;priests converted from the Orthodox Church, made their headquarters in the island of Werka, in a tributary of the Dnieper,&nbsp;in Poland (1695), and after its destruction by the government&nbsp;in 1735 and again in 1764, at Starodubye in the government of&nbsp;Chernigov, whence their doctrine spread in the country of the&nbsp;Don. In 1771 their headquarters were fixed at Moscow, in the&nbsp;Rogoshkiy cemetery assigned to them during the plague;&nbsp;here they had a monastery, seminary and consistory, until they&nbsp;were ejected by the emperor Nicholas I. In 1832 priests were&nbsp;forbidden to join them, and they had to apply to a deposed&nbsp;Bosnian metropolitan, who became their chief bishop, establishing his see in the monastery of Belokrinitsa in Bukovina.&nbsp;In 1862 the synod of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Popovshchina</span><span class="font0"> passed a circular letter&nbsp;making advances to the government with a view to a compromise, which was arranged on the basis of the Old Believers&nbsp;consenting to accept the ministrations of Orthodox priests on&nbsp;condition that they should use the unrevised books. This led&nbsp;to a further schism into three sections: those who recognize&nbsp;the metropolitan and the compromise </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Edinovyertsi),</span><span class="font0"> those&nbsp;who recognize the metropolitan but repudiate the compromise,&nbsp;those who repudiate both </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Bieglopopovtsi).</span><span class="font0"> There had already&nbsp;been other schisms on such questions as the right way to swing&nbsp;a censer and the legality of self-immolation for the Lord’s sake.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bezpopovtsi,</span><span class="font0"> known also as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pomoranye,</span><span class="font0"> because they are mainly found in the sparsely populated country near the White&nbsp;Sea, are in some ways more remarkable. They reject the&nbsp;ministration of priests altogether, since in the time of Antichrist&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(i.e.</span><span class="font0"> the heretic tsar) the only sacrament that remains is baptism.&nbsp;They therefore elect elders, who expound the Scriptures, baptize&nbsp;and hear confessions. They are, however, in no sense evangelicals in the Western sense; for they observe rigorous fasts,&nbsp;reverence icons, and believe implicitly in the efficacy of the&nbsp;multiplication of crossings, bowings and prostrations. They&nbsp;have, moreover, thrown* off from time to time a number of&nbsp;extravagant offshoots. Such are the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Philip povsti,</span><span class="font0"> founded&nbsp;by one Philip (who burned himself alive for Christ’s sake in&nbsp;1743), who have exalted self-immolation into a principle; the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Stranniki</span><span class="font0"> (pilgrims) and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Byeguni</span><span class="font0"> (runners), who interpret&nbsp;Matt. x. 37 fL literally, and reject legal marriage; the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Nyetovsti&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(denyers), who deny the necessity for common worship, since&nbsp;there are no priests; the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Molchalyniki</span><span class="font0"> (mutes), whom no&nbsp;torture can persuade to utter a word.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@1 </sup>The most important alterations were the repetition twice, instead of three times, of the “ Alleluiah ” at the Eucharist, and the&nbsp;making the sign of the cross with two fingers instead of three.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font0">Closely akin to these, though not derived from the Old Believers, are certain mystic sects which deny the efficacy&nbsp;of the sacraments altogether. Of these the most remarkable&nbsp;arc the so-called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Khlysti (“ flagellants,”</span><span class="font0"> from </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">klyesat, <sup>u</sup></span><span class="font0"> to strike,&nbsp;lash,” but possibly a corruption of Khristi, “ Christs ”). They&nbsp;originated in 1645, when, according to their belief, God the&nbsp;Father descended in a chariot of fire on Mount Gorodim, in the&nbsp;province of Vladimir, and took up his abode in a peasant named&nbsp;Daniel Philippov, who chose another peasant, named Ivan&nbsp;Suslov, for his son, the Christ. Suslov selected a “ mother of&nbsp;God ” and twelve apostles. Though twice crucified and once&nbsp;flayed by order of the tsar, he always rose again, and did not die&nbsp;till 1716. Suslov chose a successor in one Prokopiy Lupkin,&nbsp;and since then—in the belief of the sect—every generation,&nbsp;even every community, has had its Christ and its “ mother of&nbsp;God,” who are worshipped by reason of the Divine Spirit dwelling in them. It is the duty of all believers to strive to become&nbsp;one or other of these by subduing the flesh, which is the product&nbsp;of Evil, and all motions of the will. Each community is presided over by an “ angel,” or prophet, and a prophetess, whose&nbsp;word is law. All alike are subject to the twelve commandments issued by the “ Sabaoth,” that is to say Daniel Philippov. These include the prohibition of alcoholic drink, of fleshly&nbsp;sins and of marriage, and the inculcation of faith in the Holy&nbsp;Ghost and complete surrender to his influence. At their prayer-meetings the Khlysti dance to the accompaniment of hymns,&nbsp;the dance gradually developing into a wild dervish-like spinning&nbsp;which is kept up till they drop, foaming at the mouth and prophesying. Perhaps the most remarkable fact about this sect is&nbsp;that it is secret, and that its members ostensibly belong to the&nbsp;Orthodox Church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">An offshoot of the Khlysti is the more celebrated secret sect of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Skoptsi (skopets,</span><span class="font0"> a eunuch), which represents an extreme&nbsp;ascetic reaction from the promiscuous immorality of some&nbsp;(by no means all) of the Khlysti. Their idea of attaining salvation is self-mutilation according to the counsel of perfection&nbsp;implied in Matt. xix. 12 and xviii. 8, 9. The “ royal seal ” is&nbsp;complete self-castration; partial mutilation is known as the&nbsp;“ second purity.” In the case of women the mutilation usually&nbsp;takes the form of amputation of the breasts. This horrible&nbsp;sect, which was founded by one Selivanov in the last quarter of&nbsp;the 18th century, seems to have a morbid attraction for people&nbsp;of all classes in Russia, and all the efforts of the government&nbsp;have not succeeded in stamping it out (see Skoptsi).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Closer akin to certain Western forms of dissidence from traditional Catholicism, though of native growth, are the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Molo-kani,</span><span class="font0"> so called popularly because they continue to drink milk&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(moloko)</span><span class="font0"> during fasts. Their origin is unknown, but they are&nbsp;officially mentioned as early as 1765. They style themselves&nbsp;“ truly spiritual Christians,” and in their rejection of the sacraments, their indifference to outward forms, and their insistence&nbsp;on the spiritual interpretation of the Bible (“ the letter killeth ”),&nbsp;they are closely akin to the Quakers, whom they resemble also&nbsp;in their inoffensive mode of life and the practice of mutual help.</span></p>
