N.N.W. by rail. Pop. (1901) 28,550. San Severo lies at the foot of the spurs of Monte Gargano, 292 ft. above sea-level. It is the see of a bishop (since 1580), and has some remains of its old fortifications. San Severo dates from the middle ages. It was laid in ruins by Frederick II., and in 1053 was the scene of a victory by Robert Guiscard over the papal troops under Leo IX. In 1799 the town was taken by the French and again almost entirely destroyed. The over-lordship was held in succession by the Benedictines of the abbey of Torre Maggiore, the Knights Templars, the crown of Naples and the Sangro family (commendatories of Torre Maggiore). In 1627, 1828 and 1851 the town suffered from earthquakes.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
