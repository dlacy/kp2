<p><span class="font0">The almost incredibly bad state of the roads in England towards the latter part of the 17th century appears from the&nbsp;accounts cited by Macaulay </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Hist. c.</span><span class="font0"> iii.). It was due&nbsp;chiefly to the state of the law, which compelled each&nbsp;parish to maintain its own roads by statute labour, but&nbsp;the establishment of turnpike trusts and the maintenance of roads by tolls do not appear to have effected&nbsp;any great improvement. At the time of Arthur Young’s six&nbsp;months’ tour in 1770 the roads would seem to have been almost&nbsp;as bad as ever, and it is doubtful if there was much improvement&nbsp;up to the beginning of the 19th century. The turnpike roads&nbsp;were generally managed by ignorant and incompetent men until&nbsp;Telford and McAdam brought scientific principles and regular&nbsp;system to their construction and repair. The name of Telford&nbsp;is associated with a pitched foundation, which he did not always&nbsp;use, but which closely resembled that which had been long in use&nbsp;in France, and the name of McAdam often characterizes roads&nbsp;on which all his precepts are disregarded. Both insisted on&nbsp;thorough drainage and on the use of carefully prepared materials,&nbsp;and adopted a uniform cross section of moderate curvature&nbsp;instead of the exaggerated roundness given before; but, while&nbsp;Telford paid particular attention to a foundation for the broken&nbsp;stone, AIcAdam disregarded it, contending that the subsoil,&nbsp;however bad, would carry any weight if made dry by drainage&nbsp;and kept dry by an impervious covering. AIcAdam was engaged&nbsp;more with the repair of old roads than with the construction of&nbsp;new ones, and, though it is not possible to agree with all his&nbsp;doctrines, the improvement which he effected in road management and maintenance was great and lasting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Construction of Roads,</span><span class="font0">—A road should be as short as possible between two points to be connected, but straightness must&nbsp;often be sacrificed to avoid difficulties and expense&nbsp;and to secure good gradients. The latter should be&nbsp;as easy as practicable, having regard to the country to be&nbsp;traversed, and it is desirable that there should be a ruling&nbsp;gradient than which none should be steeper. On the level macadamized road in ordinary repair the force which the horse has&nbsp;to put forth to draw a load may be taken as one-thirtieth of&nbsp;the load. But in going uphill the horse has also to lift the&nbsp;load, and the additional force to be put forth on this account&nbsp;is very nearly equal to the load drawn, divided by the rate&nbsp;of gradient. Thus on a gradient of 1 in 30 the force spent in&nbsp;lifting is one-thirtieth of the load, and in ascending a horse has&nbsp;to exert twice the force required to draw the load on a level.&nbsp;In descending, on the other hand, on such a gradient, the&nbsp;vehicle, when once started, would just move of itself without&nbsp;pressing on the horse. A horse can without difficulty exert&nbsp;twice his usual force for a time, and can therefore ascend&nbsp;gradients of 1 in 30 on a macadamized surface without sensible&nbsp;diminution of speed, and can trot freely down them. These&nbsp;considerations have led to 1 in 30 being generally considered&nbsp;as the ruling gradient to be aimed at on first-class roads, though&nbsp;r in 40 has been advocated. Telford adopted 1 in 30 as the&nbsp;ruling gradient on the Holyhead road through North Wales,&nbsp;and there are only two gradients steeper, in places where they&nbsp;were unavoidable. All unnecessary rises and falls should be&nbsp;avoided, but a dead level is unfavourable for drainage, and on&nbsp;this account 1 in 100 to 1 in 150 is the flattest gradient that&nbsp;is desirable. Such slight rises and falls are probably rather&nbsp;favourable than otherwise to ease of draught by horses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In transverse section, roads in the United Kingdom generally consist of a carriage-way, with spaces on each side, on one or&nbsp;both of which there may be a footpath, and fences and&nbsp;ditches. The width of the carriage-way may be from&nbsp;15t., which allows of the easy passage of two vehicles,&nbsp;to 30 or 50 ft. for roads of importance near towns. The side&nbsp;spaces may be from 4 or 5 to 8 or 10 ft. wide; wide sides give&nbsp;the sun and air access to the road, and tend to keep it dry, and&nbsp;also afford space for the deposit of road materials and scrapings.&nbsp;In cuttings or on embankments the transverse section has of&nbsp;course to be modified. The road surface should have just&nbsp;enough convexity to throw the wet off freely, and a very moderate amount is sufficient when a good surface is maintained. On&nbsp;a too convex road the traffic keeps to the middle, and wears&nbsp;ruts which retain the water, so that the surface is not so dry&nbsp;as with a flatter section which allows the traffic to distribute&nbsp;itself over the whole width. Telford used a cross section&nbsp;differing slightly from an arc of a circle in being more convex&nbsp;in the middle than at the sides. J. Walker recommended two&nbsp;straight lines joined in the middle of the road by a curve, and&nbsp;inclined about 1 in 24 towards the sides, the objection to which&nbsp;is that the flat sides are liable to wear hollow. On the whole&nbsp;a curve of the form of a flat ellipse is the best; the rise in the&nbsp;curve from the sides to the centre need not exceed one-fortieth&nbsp;of the width, and one-sixtieth is generally enough on well-kept&nbsp;roads. It is generally best to obtain the requisite convexity&nbsp;by rounding the formation surface or seat of the road and giving&nbsp;a uniform thickness to the coating of stone, but often, especially&nbsp;in country roads where the traffic is not very heavy and keeps&nbsp;mainly to the centre, the formation is made level and the&nbsp;convexity is obtained by using more road material at the centre&nbsp;than the sides. When there is not a kerb there should be a&nbsp;“ shouldering ” of sods and earth on each side to keep the&nbsp;road materials in place, and to form with the finished surface&nbsp;the water tables or side channels in which the surface drainage&nbsp;is collected, to be conveyed by outlets at frequent intervals&nbsp;to the side ditches. The outlets are open cuts through the&nbsp;sides or drains beneath the footpaths. The side ditches should&nbsp;be deep enough thoroughly to drain the foundation of the&nbsp;road, and cross or mitre drains under the road communicating&nbsp;with the side ditches may be required in wet soil. A thorough&nbsp;drainage of the subsoil is of the greatest importance, and it is&nbsp;economical in the end to go to considerable expense to secure&nbsp;it. In a cutting, or where there are no side ditches, the surface&nbsp;water may be taken off by gratings and under drains beneath&nbsp;the side channels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Macadam Roads,</span><span class="font0">—The thickness to be given to a road made altogether of broken stone will depend on the traffic it is intended for. On a good well-drained soil a thickness of 6 in.&nbsp;will make an excellent road for ordinary traffic, and McAdam’s&nbsp;opinion that 10 in. of well-consolidated material was sufficient&nbsp;to carry the heaviest traffic on any substratum if properly&nbsp;drained has proved to be generally correct. In a new road the&nbsp;loss of thickness during consolidation must be allowed for,&nbsp;and the materials should be laid about one-half thicker than the&nbsp;coating is intended to be. When the materials are not rolled,&nbsp;a thickness of 3 to 6 in. should be laid first, and when that has&nbsp;partly consolidated under the traffic other coats may be added&nbsp;to make up the full thickness. There is great wear and waste&nbsp;of the materials in consolidating if they arc laid too thickly at&nbsp;once. Inferior material is sometimes used in the lower part of&nbsp;the road coating, especially when the surface is to be of granite&nbsp;or other hard expensive stone. Thus flints or gravel may be&nbsp;used for the lower 5 or 6 in. of a road to be coated with 3 or&nbsp;4 in. of granite. Telford covered the broken stone of new roads&nbsp;with r j in. of gravel to act as a binding material. AIcAdam&nbsp;absolutely interdicted the use of any binding material, leaving&nbsp;the broken stone to work in and unite by its own angles under&nbsp;the traffic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If the ideas of the inventor arc strictly followed, macadam, when the fine network of joints is thinly masked with hardened&nbsp;mud worn from the stone, comes near to a perfect surface.&nbsp;But stones that will pass through a ring of a given size may&nbsp;be twice as much in length, and unless their form is about that&nbsp;of a cube not exceeding 1} in. on its longest side, they cannot&nbsp;be rammed or rolled into the regular mosaic characteristic of&nbsp;the true macadam. The best modern roads are of hand-broken stone dressed slightly on the· surface with stone chips,&nbsp;while the mass of the road-metal is kept free from any kind of&nbsp;binding. Some roadmakers, however, have found the large&nbsp;irregularly shaped stones from the machine so difficult to consolidate that they have had to reconsider the question of binding.&nbsp;The engineer of Central Park, New York, found that, with the&nbsp;greatest care and attention to rolling, such stones would not</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
