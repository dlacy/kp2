<p><span class="font1">REINACH<sub>r</sub>JOSEPH (1856- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;), French author and politician,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">was born in Paris on the 30th of September 1856. After leaving the Lycée Condorcet he studied for the bar, being&nbsp;called in 1887. He attracted the attention of Gambetta by&nbsp;articles on Balkan politics published in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Revue bleue,</span><span class="font1"> and&nbsp;joined the staff of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">République française.</span><span class="font1"> In Gambetta<sup>i</sup>S&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">grand ministère</span><span class="font1"> M. Reinach was his secretary, and drew up the&nbsp;case for a partial revision of the constitution and for the electoral&nbsp;method known as the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">scrutin de liste.</span><span class="font1"> In the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">République&nbsp;française</span><span class="font1"> he waged a steady war against General Boulanger&nbsp;which brought him three duels, one with Edmond Magnier and&nbsp;two with Paul Déroulède. Between 1889 and 1898 he sat&nbsp;for the Chamber of Deputies for Digne. As member of the&nbsp;army commission, reporter of the budgets of the ministries of&nbsp;the interior and of agriculture he brought forward bills for the&nbsp;better treatment of the insane, for the establishment of a&nbsp;colonial ministry, for the taxation of alcohol, and for the reparation of judicial errors. He advocated complete freedom of the&nbsp;theatre and the press, the abolition of public executions, and&nbsp;denounced political corruption of all kinds. He was indirectly&nbsp;implicated in the Panama scandals through his father-in-law,&nbsp;Baron de Reinach, though he made restitution as soon as he&nbsp;learned that he was benefiting by fraud. But he is best known&nbsp;as the champion of Captain Dreyfus. At the time of the&nbsp;original trial he attempted to secure a public hearing of the&nbsp;case, and in 1897 he allied himself with Scheurer-Kestner to&nbsp;demand its revision. He denounced in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Siècle</span><span class="font1"> the Henry&nbsp;forgery, and Esterhazy'S complicity. His articles in the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Siècle</span><span class="font1"> aroused the fury of the anti-Dreyfusard party, especially&nbsp;as he was himself a Jew and therefore open to the charge of&nbsp;having undertaken to defend the innocence of Dreyfus on racial&nbsp;grounds. He lost his seat in the Chamber of Deputies, and,&nbsp;having refused to fight Henri Rochefort, eventually brought&nbsp;an action for libel against him.. Finally, the “ affaire ” being&nbsp;terminated and Dreyfus pardoned, he undertook to write the&nbsp;history of the case, the first four volumes of which appeared in&nbsp;1901. This was completed in 1905. In 1906 M. Reinach was&nbsp;re-elected for Digne. In that year he became member of the&nbsp;commission of the national archives, and next year of the&nbsp;council on prisons. Reinach was a voluminous writer on&nbsp;political subjects. On Gambetta he published three volumes&nbsp;in 1884, and he also edited his speeches. For the criticisms of&nbsp;the anti-Dreyfusard press see Henri Dutrait-Croyon, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Joseph&nbsp;Reinach, historien</span><span class="font1"> (Paris, 1905), a violent criticism in detail of&nbsp;Reinach<sup>i</sup>S history of the “ affaire.”</span></p>

R.</span><span class="font0"> (Angers, 1903).

Pottier,.and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Antiquités nationales</span><span class="font0"> were crowned by&nbsp;the Academy of Inscriptions.

<p><span class="font1">A younger brother, Theodore Reinach (i860- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;), also</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">had a brilliant career as a scholar. He pleaded at the Parisian bar in 1881-86, but eventually gave himself up to the study&nbsp;of numismatics. He wrote important works on the ancient&nbsp;kingdoms of Asia Minor—</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Trois royaumes de l'Asie Mineure,&nbsp;Cappadoce, Bithynie, Pont</span><span class="font1"> (1888), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mithridate Eupalor</span><span class="font1"> (1890);&nbsp;also a critical edition and translation with H.
