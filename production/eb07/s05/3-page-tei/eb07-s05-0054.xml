In one of the apartments, called the king’s room, the roof was covered with rich carvings in oak, which have been engraved and described in a work published in 1817, under the appellation of <hi rend="italic">Lucunar Strevelinense.</hi> The quaint appellation of James V. <hi rend="italic">the gudeman of Ballingeich,</hi> was derived from a hollow place immediately on the outside of the castle. Besides the places already noticed, the castle contains a large space, also surrounded by the exterior wall, in which magazines are built, called the Nether Baillery. The defences are the French, the Seven- Gun, and Queen Anne’s Batteries, with several pieces of ordnance here and there, amounting in all to twenty-six. On the south side of the castle is a piece of flat ground called the Valley, which was appropriated for tournaments. It is now used as a horse-market. There is an adjoining rock called the Ladies Hill, whence they viewed the sports below. From the castle not fewer than twelve battle-fields are seen. In 1831 the population of Stirling was 8556.	<hi rend="smallcaps">(d. d.)</hi></p><p>STIRLINGSHIRE, a county in Scotland, partly maritime, being situated at the upper extremity of the Firth of Forth, and lying between 52° 30' and 56° 17' north latitude, and between 3° 35' and 4° 40' west longitude, upon the isthmus between the Forth and Clyde. It is bounded on the north by the counties of Perth and Clackmannan, on the east by the Firth of Forth and Linlithgowshire, on the south chiefly by Dunbartonshire ; but at both the east and west extremities it is bounded for a few miles by Lanarkshire, and on the south-west and west by Dunbarton. Its length, upon the average of three measurements, is forty- two and a half miles ; and its breadth, upon the average of six measurements, thirteen and a half, although in one parallel it extends to eighteen miles ; and it contains 502 square miles, or 321,280 acres, divided into twenty-two entire parishes, with portions of other four which partly belong to the adjoining counties. The river and Firth of Forth is, for the most part, the boundary on the north, though parts of two parishes are on the north side of that river ; on the west it includes part of Lochlomond, and a narrow neck extends to the north-west, the east side of which touches Loch Katrine. Like many other of the Scotish counties, it is of a very irregular form ; yet most of its outline is well defined. Besides the Forth on the north and north-east, the Avon marks its separation from Linlithgowshire on the east and north-east, the Kelvin flows along a great part of the southern boundary, and the Endrick, before entering Lochlomond, divides it for some extent from Dunbartonshire on the west.</p><p>About two thirds of Stirlingshire consist of hills unfit for cultivation, but affording good pasturage for sheep, being chiefly covered with green herbage, though sometimes intermixed with heath. The principal chain of this description, called the Lennox Hills, but having other distinctive names, as Campsie Fells, Fintry Hills, runs across the county, from Dunbartonshire on the west, nearly to the town of Stirling on the north, but it seldom presents an elevation of more than 1500 feet. In other quarters, however, the elevation is greater ; Benlomond, on the north-west, on the banks of Lochlomond, being 3191 feet high ; and Bencleuch, in the parish of Alva, on the north side of the Forth, upwards of 2400 feet. On the north, and still more on the east of the Lennox Hills, the country is low ; the summit-level of the Forth and Clyde Canal, which passes through the south-eastern side, being only about 162 feet above the sea ; and much of the land along the Forth is a very rich plain, only a few feet higher than the water. Towards the western and southern extremities the surface is more varied, presenting tracts of heath, moss, and green pastures, intermixed with cultivated land ; the latter confined, for the most part, to the banks of the streams.</p><p>Stirlingshire has every variety of soil common in Scotland ; but that for which it is chiefly distinguished is the alluvial or <hi rend="italic">corse</hi> land on the Forth, which is computed to extend to about 40,000 English acres within this county, and twice as much more in the adjoining counties of Perth, Clackmannan, and Linlithgow, or in all to about 187 square miles ; certainly by far the richest tract in Scotland. It consists of the finest particles of earth, without stones ; in point of friability approaching to the character of loam ; in some places 30 feet deep, and seldom more than 25 feet above the level of the sea at high water ; and contains beds of shells, moss, and clay marl. In one instance, at the depth of 19 feet, there have been found in a stratum of moss the r∞ts of large trees, deers horns, and bones, while the superior strata were composed entirely of fine earth. In another instance, the skeleton of a whale, now in the museum of the university of Edinburgh, covered with four feet of soil, was found in a field, the surface of which is 18 feet above the present average level of the Forth, from which it was a mile distant.</p><p>Coal, limestone, ironstone, and sandstone, abound in this county. Coal has not been found to the north and west of the Lennox Hills, but prevails very generally along their southern base, from Baldernock on the west, to Denny, St Ninian’s, Falkirk, Larbert, and Airth, on the east ; and generally throughout all the eastern quarter, on both sides of the Forth and Clyde Canal. By means of the Union Canal carried from the city of Edinburgh to the Forth and Clyde Canal near Falkirk, these extensive coal-fields have been rendered of easy access to the metropolis, which already receives large supplies of coal from that quarter, at little more than two thirds of the price which the inhabitants formerly paid for this necessary article. Limestone abounds in the same quarters with the coal, and in many instances there is one stratum of it above and another below the coal, the former always of the best quality. Sandstone also frequently accompanies both, though it is found in other parts. At Kilsyth there is a quarry of white sandstone, which takes a fine polish, and has been often used in ornamental work. Ironstone is in great abundance throughout the coal district, and is wrought in several places to a considerable extent, chiefly for the use of the Carron Works. It is also found in the parish of Kilsyth, in balls from a quarter of an inch to a foot in diameter, which are richer in metal than the common stone. Copper has not been discovered in veins so rich as to encourage their working, though mines were formerly opened at one or two places. Veins of silver were discovered, about sixty years ago, in the parishes of Logic and Alva, on the northern extremity of the county, and for a few weeks the working was very successful, but was soon abandoned. Cobalt was found in the same quarter. There are indications of other minerals in different parts of the county. In connection with the minerals it may be noticed, that in the parish of Logie, near to the beautiful village of Bridge of Allan, the mineral springs of Airthrey were discovered some years ago, and recommended to public notice. They are now attracting a great many visitors, and Bridge of Allan is rapidly assuming the appearance of a handsome town.</p><p>Besides the Forth, the Avon, the Kelvin, and the Endrick, which, though having their sources in Stirlingshire, soon cease to belong to it exclusively, flowing for the most part on its boundaries, this district is well supplied with other streams, which traverse its interior. The Forth, however, is by far the most important. It rises from a spring on the northern side and near the summit of Benlomond. After a course of eight or ten miles, under the name of the Water of <hi rend="italic">Duckray,</hi> it passes into Perthshire, where it is called <hi rend="italic">Avendhu,</hi> or Black River ; and soon after, on returning to the borders of this county, it obtains the name of the Forth A few miles above Stirling it receives the Teith, and after-</p></body></text></TEI>
