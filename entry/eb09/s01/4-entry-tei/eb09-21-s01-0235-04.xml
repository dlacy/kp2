                <p><label>SALTPETRE</label>, or Nitrate of Potash (KNO<hi rend="sub">3</hi>), is a
                        salt obtained as a commercial product in three different ways. (1) It occurs
                        as an efflorescence on the surface or in the superficial stratum of the soil
                        in many parts of the world, but specially to a great extent in the Ganges
                        valley and other parts of India. (2) It is obtained in a semi-artificial
                        manner in nitraries or saltpetre plantations. These consist of heaps of
                        decomposing animal matter mixed with lime ashes, road scrapings, and other
                        rubbish covered over from rain, and from time to time damped with the
                        runnings from stables and other urine. Such heaps develop within them small
                        proportions of the salt and other nitrates, and are, in effect, artificial
                        imitations of the saltpetre-bearing soil of India. They were formerly very
                        common in Switzerland, France, Germany, and Sweden. (3) A large quantity of
                        saltpetre is now prepared from Chili saltpetre, the nitrate of soda, by
                        double decomposition of the soda salt with another salt of potash. See
                        Nitrogen, vol. xvii. p. 518, and Gunpowder, vol. xi. pp. 319, 323. Saltpetre
                        is of importance in numerous industries, among the most prominent of which
                        are gunpowder manufacture and pyrotechny. It is also used as an oxidizing
                        agent in glass-making and in metallurgical operations. In the curing of meat
                        it is extensively employed with common salt and sugar, and it also occupies
                        an important place in pharmacy.</p>
                <p>In the year 1884 337,708 cwt. of saltpetre was imported into the United Kingdom,
                    the estimated value being Â£306,113. Of this amount 200,065 cwt. came from Bengal
                    and British Burmah alone, and 78,545 cwt. of converted saltpetre came from
                    Germany. During each of the two years 1883 and 1884 the imports of Chili
                    saltpetre, under the name of cubic nitre, exceeded 2,000,000 cwt., nearly the
                    whole supply coming from Bolivia and Peru.</p>
