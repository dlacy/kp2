<p><label>REMINISCENCE</label>
(from Lat. <hi rend="italic">reminisci,</hi> to remember), the recognized translation of the Greek <hi rend="italic">ανάμνησή,</hi> which is used technically by Plato in his doctrine that the soul recovers knowledge of which it had direct intuition in a former incorporeal existence. The doctrine may be regarded as the poetical precursor of modern a priori theories of knowledge and of “ race-memory ” and the like. In common language “ reminiscence ” is synonymous with “ recollection.”</p>
