<p><label>RICH, RICHARD</label>
(fl. 1610), English soldier and adventurer, the author of <hi rend="italic">Newes from Virginia,</hi> sailed from England on the 2nd of June 1609 for Virginia, with Captain Christopher Newport and the three commissioners entrusted with the foundation of the new colony. In his verse pamphlet he relates the adventures undergone by the expedition, and describes the resources of the new country, with the advantages offered to colonists. The title runs: <hi rend="italic">Nesves from Virginia. The lost Plocke Triumphant. With the happy Arrivall of that famous and worthy Knight Sr. Thomas Gates; and the well-reputed and valiant Captaine Mr Christopher Newport, and others, into England. With the maner of their distresse in the Iland of Devils {otherwise catted Bermoothawes), where they remayned 42 weeks, and builded two Pynaces, in which they returned into Virginia.</hi> By R. Rich, Gent., one of the Voyage (1610).” The only known copy of this tract is in the Huth Library. A reprint edited by J. O.'Halliwell-Phillips appeared in 1865 (another ed., 1874). The adventures related by Rich are supposed to have been in Shakespeare’s mind when he wrote <hi rend="italic">The Tempest.</hi> Another tract by Rich mentioned in the Stationers* Register, <hi rend="italic">Good Speed to Virginia,</hi> is unknown.</p>
