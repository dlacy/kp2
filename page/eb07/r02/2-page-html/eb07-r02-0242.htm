<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rotation, in mechanical philosophy, denotes the motion of the different parts of a solid body about an axis, in contradistinction to t!fe progressive motion of the body in&nbsp;a straight line, or in an orbit about a distant centre, of&nbsp;which the rotation is absolutely independent, although both&nbsp;motions may take place simultaneously. Thus the planets&nbsp;have a progressive motion, or a motion of translation, in the&nbsp;orbits which they describe about the sun, while at the same&nbsp;time each revolves about an axis which passes through its&nbsp;centre of gravity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In consequence of this double motion of the planetary bodies, the two great problems in physical astronomy are,&nbsp;first, to determine the orbit described in space by each body&nbsp;under the influence of the sun’s attraction, but disturbed&nbsp;by the attraction of every other body in tlle system ; and,&nbsp;secondly, to determine the circumstances of the rotation&nbsp;of each body under the influence of the same disturbing&nbsp;forces. This last problem is not of less importance or difficulty than the first. In the case of the earth it includes&nbsp;the determination of the precession of the equinoxes and&nbsp;the nutation of the axis under the disturbing action of the&nbsp;sun and moon ; and its analysis has led to the discovery of&nbsp;two important facts connected with the physical constitution of the universe, namely, the invariability of the length&nbsp;of the day, and the permanence of tlle poles of rotation on&nbsp;the earth’s surface.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But tlle problem of determining the rotation of a solid body is not merely interesting in consequence of its forming a principal part of physical astronomy ; it is also one of&nbsp;the highest importance in practical mechanics ; for the principles to which we are led in considering the general theory of rotatory motion, enable us to determine the effect&nbsp;or performance of machines, and the proper relations and&nbsp;most advantageous disposition of their several parts, in order&nbsp;to accomplish the object in view with the smallest waste of&nbsp;force, and the least strain or injury to the machine itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In treating the subject, we shall first endeavour to demonstrate the fundamental propositions of rotatory motion in as elementary a manner as possible ; secondly, we shall&nbsp;show the methods of computing the inertia of bodies of different forms, and the properties of principal axes ; thirdly,&nbsp;we shall consider the motion of a body which revolves about&nbsp;a fixed axis, and the properties of the centres of gyration,&nbsp;percussion, and oscillation ; and, lastly, we shall give the&nbsp;general equations which determine the rotation of a body&nbsp;acted upon by any number of forces, and which is at liberty&nbsp;to move in any direction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a solid body, or system of material particles,&nbsp;so connected that their mutual distances remain invariable,&nbsp;turns round an axis, every particle describes a circle having&nbsp;its centre in the axis, and its plane perpendicular to the&nbsp;axis ; and at every instant of the motion the particle is in the&nbsp;direction of a tangent to the circle, or in a straight line perpendicular to its radius vector. In order, therefore, to ascertain the direction of the motion of any particle of the&nbsp;system, we have only to draw a straight line from the particle perpendicular to the axis of rotation. This line will&nbsp;lie in the plane of the circle, and be its radius vector ; and&nbsp;the perpendicular to the radius vector at its extremity gives&nbsp;the direction of the motion of the particle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the system is supposed to be invariable in form,&nbsp;every particle describes the circumference of a circle in&nbsp;precisely the same instant of time ; and as this is also true&nbsp;of any given portion of the circumference, it follows that&nbsp;the absolute velocities of the different particles are proportional to their distances from the axis of rotation. Hence,&nbsp;if </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">w</span><span class="font0"> denote tlle velocity of the particle whose radius vector&nbsp;or distance from the axis = 1, then </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rw</span><span class="font0"> is the velocity of&nbsp;the particle whose distance from the axis = r. The velocity denoted by to is called the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">angular velocity of</span><span class="font0"> the body ;&nbsp;and the rotations of different bodies are compared in respect of velocity by comparing their angular velocities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nature of the forces which connect the different&nbsp;particles or atoms of a solid body, and render it impossible&nbsp;for any single particle to change its position without a corresponding change in the positions of all the other particles,&nbsp;is very obscurely known ; but whatever their nature may be,&nbsp;there is one general fact or law, established by unexcepted experience, which affords a sufficient foundation for a dynamical theory, namely, that the forces by which the particles&nbsp;of a body act reciprocally on each other are equal. An immediate consequence of this law is, that when a solid body&nbsp;is in equilibrium between two external forces A and B,&nbsp;these forces are equal and opposite ; for the force A being&nbsp;in immediate equilibrium with the opposite forces exerted&nbsp;by that particle of tlle solid body to which it is applied,&nbsp;must therefore be equal and opposite to the force resulting&nbsp;from the combination of all the forces which connect that&nbsp;particle with the series of particles immediately adjoining.&nbsp;In like manner, the compound force by which this first series of particles acts on tllat to which the external force A&nbsp;is applied, is equal and opposite to the compound force&nbsp;which connects this first series with the next series, and so&nbsp;on until we come to the particle to which the external force&nbsp;B is immediately applied. And this particle being in equilibrium, the external force applied to it must be equal and&nbsp;opposite to the compound force exerted on it by the series&nbsp;of contiguous particles on that side ; therefore the two forces&nbsp;A and B are equal and opposite.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Hence it follows, that when any number of external forces are applied to a solid body, and it is in equilibrium&nbsp;between them, the forces are such as would be in equilibrium&nbsp;if they were all applied at one point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a body is maintained in equilibrium by the action&nbsp;of three forces, these forces lie in the same plane, and&nbsp;are either parallel, or meet in the same point. This follows immediately from the composition of forces ; for the&nbsp;forces being in equilibrium, any one of the three must be equal&nbsp;and opposite to the equivalent, or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">resultant,</span><span class="font0"> as it is termed,&nbsp;of the other two ; and this resultant is the diagonal of a parallelogram of which the other two </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">component</span><span class="font0"> forces are&nbsp;the sides. But the diagonal and sides of a parallelogram&nbsp;are in the same plane, therefore the third force is in the&nbsp;plane of the other two ; and, further, since it is equal and&nbsp;opposite to the resultant of the other two, it must be in the&nbsp;same straight line, and consequently pass through their&nbsp;point of concourse. These simple propositions are the&nbsp;foundation of the theory of statics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In applying these propositions to explain the motion&nbsp;of rotation, we must recollect a fundamental theorem in&nbsp;dynamics, that the force which produces any motion is equal&nbsp;and opposite to the force which would prevent it, if applied&nbsp;at the same point, and in the same straight line, or which&nbsp;would extinguish the motion in the same time in which we&nbsp;suppose it to be produced. The force therefore which,&nbsp;acting on any particle, causes the body to revolve about an&nbsp;axis with a given angular velocity, is equal to the force&nbsp;which, if applied at the same point in the opposite direction, would reduce the body to a state of rest in the same&nbsp;time as was necessary to produce the given velocity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only distinct notion we can form of the intensity of any moving force, is the quantity of motion which</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
