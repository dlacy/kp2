<p><span class="font0">First, then, Rhetoric is not a primary science. Its first principles are the phenomena and laws of the human mind,&nbsp;which it assumes as known to us from consciousness and&nbsp;observation, and as taught in rational systems of psychology, logic, and ethics. Aristotle, among the many instances in which he protested against errors that had&nbsp;arisen before his time, and have survived in spite of his remonstrances, was especially careful in determining the point&nbsp;at which rhetoric should commence its investigations. He&nbsp;lays it down as a fundamental principle, that the student of&nbsp;eloquence must prepare himself by an adequate acquaintance with three primary branches of knowledge which rhetoric cannot teach him ; the science of dialectics, the philosophy of human character and morals, and the philosophy&nbsp;of the passions. The Stagyrite’s requirement of skill in logic for one who desires to acquire skill in oratory, will seem&nbsp;unreasonable, not only to those who disdain the assistance&nbsp;of rules in every department of mental exertion, but to some&nbsp;who are disposed in certain matters to avail themselves of&nbsp;the aids which philosophy offers. If, however, we merely&nbsp;advise them to make themselves familiar, so far as they are&nbsp;not so already, with the principles and practice of reasoning,&nbsp;they cannot fairly consider the counsel as useless ; and if&nbsp;they admit the necessity of this study, we can only remind&nbsp;them further, that they must either be content to receive&nbsp;the syllogistic logic of Aristotle, as expounding justly the&nbsp;principles on which all reasoning is founded, or engage in&nbsp;that attempt at discovering a new system, which has baffled&nbsp;the human intellect for two thousand years. “ I cannot but&nbsp;consider him,” Says Whately, “ as undertaking a task of unnecessary difficulty, who endeavours, without studying logic,&nbsp;to become a thoroughly good argumentative writer.” That&nbsp;Aristotle’s other demands on the student are well founded,&nbsp;will be more readily admitted, how far soever men may disagree as to the mode in which these branches of knowledge&nbsp;may be best acquired. For those who aim principally at applying their acquaintance with human nature to the purpose&nbsp;here in view, the world is doubtless a better school than the&nbsp;closet of the metaphysician ; especially as metaphysical writers&nbsp;have, almost without exception, devoted themselves chiefly&nbsp;to those sections of their science which are least closely allied to active life. But the philosopher’s attention is nevertheless directed to many important points which the unsystematic observer is in danger of overlooking ; and no&nbsp;one will find cause to regret the time bestowed on a course&nbsp;of metaphysical study, when he proceeds to the task of convincing and persuading his fellow-men. Unfortunately,&nbsp;however, the falsity and extravagance of several very famous&nbsp;systems of ethics, make caution indispensable in regard to&nbsp;such studies. A disciple of Hobbes, who, in addressing&nbsp;himself to any body of men by speech or writing, should&nbsp;frame all his appeals to their feelings, on the assumption that&nbsp;a degrading selfishness was the ruling passion in every&nbsp;breast, would, if he should be within the reach of conviction, discover the best practical refutation of his master’s&nbsp;dogmas in his own utter failure ; and one whose mind is&nbsp;thoroughly attuned to the low key of Paley’s philosophy,&nbsp;would probably, although his heresy in morals is less dangerous, find the application of his creed to the purposes of&nbsp;eloquence scarcely less ineffectual.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But, secondly, there are certain other principles of rhetoric, constituting indeed its essence, which, though they touch the frontier of other mental sciences, are yet sub.&nbsp;Stantially distinct and peculiar. The two subjects of inquiry with which the Philosophy of Eloquence comes most&nbsp;nearly into contact are, on the one hand, Logic, and, on the&nbsp;other, the Philosophy of Poetry. We shall be easily able&nbsp;to distinguish the points at which it branches oft’ from both,&nbsp;if we keep firmly in view the main proposition, that the purpose of eloquence is the production of belief.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">And, first, as to logic. In the first place, this science is conversant about the three discursive operations of the&nbsp;mind, apprehension, judgment, and reasoning, and takes no&nbsp;cognizance of any others. Secondly, logic is strictly “ a&nbsp;formal science.” In regard to reasoning, which is its principal object, it guarantees, to use the words of a very distinguished living metaphysician, “ neither the premises nor the&nbsp;conclusion, but merely the consequence of the latter from&nbsp;the former.” Of the truth or falsehood of the propositions&nbsp;which form the logician’s premises, his science teaches him&nbsp;absolutely nothing. Here, then, are two barriers, by both&nbsp;of which logic, omnipotent w ithin its own domain, has that&nbsp;domain limited ; and beyond each of them lies a wide class&nbsp;of principles essentially affecting human belief. Let us&nbsp;even suppose that the human mind were biassed, in arriving at its conclusions, by no extra-logical operations of its&nbsp;own. Even on this supposition, logical rules would not&nbsp;teach us how’ to produce belief of any given proposition.&nbsp;For though they would enable us to discover premises from&nbsp;which the required conclusion might be logically inferred,&nbsp;they possess no machinery which would qualify us for judging whether those premises would command the belief of&nbsp;those whom we wished to convince. Logic could neither&nbsp;inform us whether our premises are absolutely true, nor&nbsp;(which is here the real subject of inquiry) whether they&nbsp;are likely to seem true to others. Therefore, even for producing conviction by pure reasoning, the discovery of arguments is a task, and one of unquestionable importance,&nbsp;which logic cannot perform ; and if rhetoric, or any other&nbsp;science, undertakes to lay down principles facilitating its&nbsp;execution, we shall do well to examine, at least candidly, its&nbsp;capacity for fulfilling its professions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But, in the next place, the mind of man is not so simply constituted, and his position in the system of nature has, as&nbsp;it were, fenced round his rational faculties with those powers&nbsp;which issue in action. The emotions pervade every operation of the mind, as the life-blood circulates through the&nbsp;body: within us and without, in the corporeal world and&nbsp;in the spiritual, in the past, the present, and the future, there&nbsp;is no object of thought which they do not touch, few, very&nbsp;few, which they do not colour and transmute. The argument which, if it could be presented pure to the reasoning&nbsp;faculties, would be fairly weighed, and calmly received or&nbsp;rejected, is sometimes disguised by passion, as completely&nbsp;as a landscape is by clouds, whose stormy piles we mistake&nbsp;for the distant mountains ; and in almost every case the&nbsp;conclusion or its proof, or both the one and the other, are&nbsp;seen through a medium more or less hazy, in which they&nbsp;present themselves as the objects of our bodily appetites,&nbsp;or our mental fears and desires, as instruments or hindrances&nbsp;of our affections, kind or malevolent, towards our fellow-men, or as falling under the jurisdiction of that supreme&nbsp;judge and monarch, the moral faculty, which sits enthroned&nbsp;in the inmost recesses of the heart, always able, when accurately informed, to confirm the decisions of reason, but,&nbsp;like other despots, often allowing its power to slumber, and&nbsp;often misled by faithless ministers. If we would command&nbsp;the belief of minds thus variously affected, it is manifest&nbsp;that other principles, besides those of logic, must aid us both&nbsp;in the discovery of arguments, and in their form and arrangement. 1. As to the discovery of arguments, we must&nbsp;always, both for protecting our own minds against error,&nbsp;and for qualifying us to deal with men of cold and unimaginative temper, aim at making ourselves masters of such&nbsp;premises as would probably command the belief of those&nbsp;on whose minds pure reasoning could fall directly, without&nbsp;being turned aside by intervening obstacles. We may always encounter some men whose minds, wdlen directed to&nbsp;certain objects, are more or less nearly in this position. 2.&nbsp;In regard to the same department of our business of conviction, we must endeavour to perform the far more diffi-</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
