It is ſιtuated on an eminence at the foot of the Alps near the river Po, in E. Long. 18. 27. N. Lat. 44. 35. It is ſubject to the king of Sardinia.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Saluzzo,</hi> the marquiſate of a province of Piedmont in Italy, bounded on the north by Dauphiny and the province of the Four Valleys, on the eaſt by thoſe of Saviglano and Foſſano, on the ſouth by that of Cona and the county of Nice, and on the weſt by Barcelonetta. It was ceded to the duke of Savoy in 1601.</p><p>SAMA, a town and fort in the hands of the Dutch on the Gold Coaſt of Africa, (lands on an eminence, the fort being watered by the pleaſant river of St George, that diſcharges itſelf into the ſea. The town contains above 200 houſes, which ſeem to form three diſtinct villages, one of which is immediately under the cannon of the Dutch fort St Sebaſtian. Des Marchais deems this town to be one of the largeſt on the whole coaſt, Barbot likewiſe agreeing with him in its ſituation, extent, and number of inhabitants. The ſole employment of the natives is fiſhing; a circumſtance which eaſily accounts for their poverty. The government of this place is republican, the magiſtrates having the ſupreme power, being ſubject to periodical changes, and under the authority of the king of Gavi, who ſeldom however interferes in the affairs of the ſtate. This prince reſides ſome leagues diſtant from the ſea, is rich, and much reſpected by his neighbours.</p><p>SAMANEANS, in antiquity, a kind of magi or philoſophers, have been confounded by ſome with the Bramins. They proceeded from Ariana, a province of Perſia, and the neighbouring countries, ſpread themſelves in India, and taught new doctrines.</p><p>The Bramins, before their arrival, it is ſaid, were in the higheſt period of their glory, were the only oracles of India, and their principal reſidence was on the banks of the Ganges, and in the adjacent mountains; while the Samaneans were fettled towards the Indus. Others  ſay, that the Bramins acquired all their knowledge from the Samaneans, beſore whoſe arrival it would be difficult to prove that the Bramins were the religious teachers of the Indians. The moſt celebrated and ancient of the Samanean doctors was Boutta, or Budda, who was born 683 years before Chriſt. His ſcholars paid him divine honours; and his doctrine, which conſiſted chiefly in the tranſmigration of fouls, and in the wor- ſhip of cows, was adopted not only in India, but alſo in Japan, China, Siam, and Tartary. It was propagated, according to M. de Sainte Croix, in Thibet, in the 8th century, and ſucceeded there the ancient religion of Zamolxis. The Samaneans, or Buddiſts, were entirely deſtroyed in India by the jealous rage of the Bramins, whoſe abſurd practices and fables they affected to treat with contempt; but ſeveral of their books are ſtill preſerved and reſpected on the coaſts of Malabar.</p><p>We are told, too, that ſeveral of the Bramin orders have adopted their manner of living, and openly profeſs the greateſt part of their doctrines. <hi rend="italic">L''Ezour Vedam, ou Ancien Comment du Vedam,</hi> publiſhed by M. de S.

It is like the trunk of a man’s body, without head or legs. Its greateſt length, from Cape Baliquaton, which, with the point of Manilla, makes the ſtrait of St Bernardino, in 13 degrees 30 minutes north latitude, extends to that of Guignan in 11 degrees towards the ſouth. The other two points, making the greateſt breadth of the iſland, are Cabo de Spirito Santo, or <hi rend="italic">Cape oſ the Holy Ghost,</hi> the high mountains of which are the firſt diſcovered by ſhips from New Spain; and that which lying oppoſite to Leyte weſtward, makes another ſtrait, ſcarce a ſtone’s throw over. The whole compaſs of the iſland is about 130 leagues. Between Guignan and Cape Spirito Santo is the port of Borognon, and not far from thence thoſe of Palapa and Catubig, and the little iſland of Bin, and the coaſt of Catarman. Veſſels from countries not yet diſcovered are very frequently caſt away on the before-mentioned coaſt of Palapa. Within the ſtraits of St Bernardino, and beyond Baliquaton, is the coaſt of Samar, on which are the villages of Ibatan, Bangahon, Cathalogan, Paranos, and Calviga. Then follows the ſtrait of St Juanillo, without which, ſtanding eaſtward, appears the point and little iſland of Guignan, where the compaſs of the iſland ends. It is mountainous and craggy, but fruitful in the few plains there are. The fruits there are much the ſame as that of <hi rend="smallcaps">Leyte</hi>; but there is one particular fort, called by the Spaniards <hi rend="italic">chicoy,</hi> and by the Chineſe, who put a great value on it, <hi rend="italic">ſeyzu</hi>, without kernels.</p><p>SAMARA, in botany; a genus of the monogynia order, belonging to the tetrandria claſs of plants.

This town was the capital of the kingdom of Sogdia in the time of Alexander the Great, when it was called <hi rend="italic">Maracanda.</hi> It was afterwards the capital of the empire of Tamerlane the Great. In the time of Jenghiz Khan, it was forced to yield to the arms of that cruel conqueror; by whom the garriſon, amounting to 30, 000 men, were butchered; 30, 000 of the inhabitants, with their wives and children, were preſented to his generals; the reft were permitted to live in the city, on paying a tribute of 300, 000 dinars or crowns of gold.</p><p>SAMARIA (anc. geog. ), one of the three larger Cisjordan diſtricts, ſituated in the middle between Galilee to the north and Judea to the ſouth, beginning at the village Ginaea, in the Campus Magnus, and ending at the toparchy called. <hi rend="italic">Acrοbatena</hi> (Joſephus).
