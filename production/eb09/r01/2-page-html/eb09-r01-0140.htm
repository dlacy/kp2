<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">emperor hacl been given to the publication of certain “ provisions ” in matters of faith which had filled the Lutheran party with alarm. At Gotha and again at Torgau the&nbsp;Protestant leaders began to concert measures for actively&nbsp;repelling the policy of coercion which they anticipated&nbsp;would shortly be commenced. When, however, the diet&nbsp;assembled at Spires in June they found their apprehensions dispelled in an unexpected manner by the newly-aroused animosity towards the Roman pontiff and his&nbsp;policy. Never had the electors shown themselves more&nbsp;unanimous in counsel or submitted with better grace to&nbsp;the contributions imposed upon them. It was even proposed that the recently issued provisions should be publicly&nbsp;burnt and the Bible adopted as the only rule of faith.&nbsp;However, it was finally resolved that the respective states&nbsp;should be declared to be at full liberty, in relation to all&nbsp;questions of belief raised by the edict of Worms (see&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Luther), </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“to conduct themselves as each should hereafter be ready to answer for towards God and the emperor,”&nbsp;—terms which virtually implied permission to proceed according to their own discretion. “ Such an enactment,” observes Ranke, “ containing as it does no mention whatever&nbsp;of the supreme pontiff, may be looked upon as the commencement of the Reformation properly so called, involving,&nbsp;in fact, the institution of a new church in Germany.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The effects of the concurrent action of religious and national sentiment thus brought about were soon to receive&nbsp;<sup>:</sup> a memorable illustration in Italy. The soldiers who made&nbsp;their way under the leadership of Frondsberg, Ferdinand’s&nbsp;lieutenant, across the Alps, in the snows of November&nbsp;1526, into the plains of Lombardy, and afterwards mingled&nbsp;with the Spanish forces which Bourbon led on to the assault&nbsp;on Rome, were almost entirely avowed supporters of&nbsp;Luther’s cause and full of fierce hatred of popery. Frondsberg himself loudly declared that as soon as he had taken&nbsp;Rome he would hang the pope. The Spaniards, notwithstanding their unshaken devotion to Catholicism, entered&nbsp;the city burning with the spirit of national antipathy, and&nbsp;eager to revenge the long series of wrongs and exactions&nbsp;which their countrymen had suffered at the hands of Italian&nbsp;ecclesiastics. Among the horrors which followed upon the&nbsp;capture of the capital (May 1527) nothing more completely&nbsp;shocked the sense of Latin Christendom than the savage&nbsp;contempt manifested by the German soldiery for everything&nbsp;that symbolized the Roman faith, their wanton destruction&nbsp;of relics and images, mock religious services, and especial&nbsp;brutality in the treatment of priests. Even their Spanish&nbsp;confederates, though equally merciless in their excesses,&nbsp;looked on with indignation as they saw them disguising&nbsp;themselves as cardinals and holding a mock consistory&nbsp;under the windows of St Angelo for the purpose of electing Luther as pope. But even the impressions thus produced were evanescent when compared with the constantly&nbsp;renewed and unavailing regret which filled the breast of&nbsp;the scholar and the churchman in after years, as he realized&nbsp;the irreparable losses inflicted upon art and learning, the&nbsp;destruction of unique manuscripts and ancient records.&nbsp;Nor can it be a matter of surprise that a sentiment of&nbsp;deep revenge should have arisen in Rome against the&nbsp;Lutheran destroyer, and that even the Swabian and the&nbsp;Spanish invader alike should have afterwards been solicitous in a manner to disguise their own responsibility, by&nbsp;professing to look upon the blow thus struck at the sanctity&nbsp;and inviolability of the sacred city as a direct judgment of&nbsp;God. For a time, though only for a few months, it was&nbsp;believed, even by politicians so shrewd and well informed&nbsp;as Wolsey, that the emperor himself was designing to aid&nbsp;the Reformation. The approach of the Turks, who had&nbsp;overrun Hungary, and the hostility of France demonstrated the urgent necessity of maintaining concord among&nbsp;his subjects in the empire; and it is possible that he may&nbsp;really have contemplated placing himself at the head of&nbsp;the Lutheran movement and keeping Clement VII. permanently a prisoner at Gaeta. But his Spanish blood, his&nbsp;education under Adrian of Utrecht, and the traditions of&nbsp;the imperial dignity proved too powerful a counterpoise,&nbsp;and Charles eventually not only deigned to lay before the&nbsp;courts of Europe a partial explanation and apology for&nbsp;the tragedy at Rome, but in a treaty (26th November&nbsp;1527) with the pontiff he entered upon an agreement for&nbsp;the adoption of a distinct anti-Reformation policy. It&nbsp;has been asserted that Clement also undertook on this&nbsp;occasion not to declare the marriage of Henry VIII. and&nbsp;Catherine illegal, but no such stipulation appears in the&nbsp;existing treaty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">In pursuance of his anti-imperial policy Wolsey did not fail to seek to turn to the best account the sensation&nbsp;caused by the triumph of the imperial arms. He enjoined&nbsp;the observance of a three days’ fast and the offering up&nbsp;of prayers in every church in England for the captive&nbsp;pontiff’s deliverance. He could not, however, but be&nbsp;conscious that his policy was regarded with but little&nbsp;favour by the nation at large. The young emperor was&nbsp;highly popular among the citizens of London, and the&nbsp;ancient amicable relations with the house of Burgundy&nbsp;and the actual important commercial relations with Flanders combined to render Spain in the eyes of Englishmen&nbsp;their natural ally, while France they still regarded as&nbsp;their hereditary foe. An expedient to which he had&nbsp;recourse about this time only served still further to fan&nbsp;this feeling. He had sought to render France, instead&nbsp;of the Low Countries, the main channel of the commerce&nbsp;between England and the Continent by making Calais&nbsp;the chief port for merchandise. The merchants of the&nbsp;Hanse towns took alarm; and, as it was in their vessels&nbsp;that Luther’s writings, which were now eagerly purchased&nbsp;in England, even at exorbitant prices, chiefly found their&nbsp;way across the Channel, the preachers of the Reformation&nbsp;found no difficulty in representing to their countrymen&nbsp;that an Anglo-French alliance could not fail to prove&nbsp;inimical to the gospel. On the other hand, the Catholic&nbsp;party both in England and in Germany, as soon as the&nbsp;project of the divorce became noised abroad, could not&nbsp;but recognize in Catherine the representative of the&nbsp;interests of the true church, while they looked upon the&nbsp;emperor as her champion, and upon Wolsey as a traitor&nbsp;to the cause of truth and justice. During the last five&nbsp;years the cardinal’s efforts to reform the clergy and&nbsp;repress the Reformation in England had been strenuous&nbsp;and constant. In the year 1521 he had enjoined all the&nbsp;bishops “ to take order that any books, written or printed,&nbsp;of Martin Luther’s heresies and errors should be brought&nbsp;in to the bishop of each diocese.” @@<sup>1</sup> The movement at&nbsp;Cambridge continued, however, to progress, and in 1523&nbsp;some of the bishops suggested the appointment of a visitation to the university “for trying who were the fautors&nbsp;of heresy there.” This proposition was not acted upon&nbsp;by Wolsey, who probably in his heart sympathized with&nbsp;the genuine spirit of learning developing in the university,&nbsp;and the matter was subsequently made the ground of an&nbsp;accusation against him by his enemies.@@<sup>2</sup> We find, accordingly, George Stafford, a member of Pembroke Hall,&nbsp;venturing in the following year to adopt the example set&nbsp;by Luther, of taking the Scriptures themselves, instead&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sentences</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> of Peter Lombard (the theological textbook of the universities), as the basis of a course of&nbsp;divinity lectures. In the following year William Tyndal&nbsp;published at Antwerp the first edition of his translation</span></p><div>
