A tract called the central mining district of Russia extends from the Oka to near the town of Kalouga, including portions of the governments OfNiznei-Novgorod<hi rend="sub">1</hi> Vladimir, Tambov, Riazan, and Kalouga. But it is for the most part a poor sandy district, containing iron ore ; and as the metal is manufactured in the localities where it is found, several extensive iron-works are situated at intervals along the line mentioned. The ore is described as occurring in regular beds, sixty feet below the surface. It is of several varieties, the lightest coloured producing the most iron. Few minerals occur in that large and sandy plain which we have noticed as forming the northern and central portion of Poland. The land, as in all the northern countries on our globe, is incrusted with a ferruginous deposit, and every marsh and every meadow contains iron in a greater or less proportion. The iron is of indifferent quality ; and the existing veins of lead, gold, and silver, which, it appears, were once productive, lie beyond the Russian territory. At Petrozavodsk, near Lake Onega, in Finland, there are iron-works, which, it is believed, are the largest in the north of Russia. Bog-iron ore abounds in the neighbourhood ; and for a long time this was the only kind smelted ; but thirteen different mines are now wrought. Vast quantities are obtained by simply dragging the lakes. Another great iron-work of the same description is situated four versts from St Petersburg, on the road to Riga. Finland also yields copper and tin, but only one mine of the former is wrought. Coal is found in very inconsiderable quantities in European Russia. There is a small mine worked at Tula, another at Bakhmout in the government of Ikaterinoslav, but neither seem to be of much utility. In Southern Poland and Cracow there are numerous beds of black bituminous coal, resembling that of Great Britain, some of which are thirty feet in thickness. These occur in the secondary formation. In the tertiary districts deposits of brown coal are met with, which also yields amber, the exudation of a dicotyledonous tree. Russia possesses a great treasure in the numerous salt-lakes and marshes of the Siberian steppes, and the country to the north of the Caspian Sea. There are also mines of salt dispersed throughout the empire, and from these sources immense quantities are annually obtained, the amount increasing indefinitely with the population. There is a tract of country called the Northern Salt District, which stretches in a line parallel with the Petersburg limestone, for a thousand versts. It makes its first appearance in the island of Oesel, and is w<hi rend="sup">τ</hi>orked in several parts of the south of Livonia. Quarries of gypsum are also situated in this great tract. A central salt district is described as existing in the course of the Volga. Along the course of the river Kama there is also a rich and extensive marl, salt, and gypsum tract, probably connected on the south with that of the Volga, and on the north with that<hi rend="italic">of</hi>  Vologda. The principal salt-works are in the neighbourhood of Solikamsk ; and the gypsum grottoes of Koungour, in the government of Perm, are of great size and magnificence. There are in Poland large mines of rock-salt, which annually yield immense supplies of the article. They form part of that enormous layer of fossil-salt which extends along the Carpathian Mountains, and is large enough to supply the consumption of all the nations of the earth for an indefinite period of time. Copper-sand is found throughout a vast tract of country extending over the governments of Perm, Viatka, and Oufa. It completely skirts the south and west sides of the Ural Mountains. The sand is of a dull red or green colour, and is usually worked for copper. It contains fossil-wood impregnated with the metal. But</p><p>it is in the Asiatic territory of Russia that the most abundant mines of copper are found, as well as those of gold, silver, platina, and other metals.</p><p>In a country of such vast dimensions, the soil must of course vary considerably in different situations. There is a vast tract of territory 65,000 geographical square leagues in extent, which possesses a peculiar and rather remarkable soil. Indeed, Ritter, in his <hi rend="italic">Erdhunde,</hi>  informs us that there is only one other place on the surface of the earth where any thing similar in soil has been discovered, and that is the north of Hindustan. It consists entirely of decomposed vegetable matter, and is deposited in a thick layer. It is situated in the south of Russia, stretching in a broad belt from Volhynia in a north-easterly direction, to the foot of the Ural chain, near Perm. It is prolonged on one side from this to the shores of the Black Sea ; and on the other it stretches from Perm to Orenburg, and thence to the Caspian Sea. All this vast tract, exceeding in extent France, Spain, and Prussiaunited, is covered throughout with a stratum of vegetable mould, which varies in thickness from three to five feet. It is so extremely productive as to stand in no need of manure. Its fertility is shown in the large returns of grain, especially rye, which it yields, and in the excellent breeds of cattle which are reared upon it. From the thinness of the population, this vegetable mould is far from being wholly laid out in corn -fields ; vast tracts still remaining unoccupied. The soils of the steppes which cover so large a portion of the surface of Russia we have already adverted to when describing these plains. What remains to be said regarding the soil of this country must be stated in reference to specific localities, a general description being impracticable.</p><p>The country between the Dniester and the Dnieper has a soil impregnated with nitre, a substance deleterious to vegetation ; yet, as soon as it is removed or diminished, wheat, millet, and the arbute melon, may be cultivated with great success. The mildest and most fruitful region in all the Russian empire is that continuation of valleys arranged in natural amphitheatres at the southern base of Taurida, along the coasts of the Black Sea. Proceeding eastward, we meet the government of Astracan, only part of the soil of which is fertile. This portion includes the low districts on the banks of the Volga, the Ural, and the Terek, and is by no means large ; but here vegetables attain an enormous size. The soil is impregnated with saline and bituminous substances. Higher up, the land on the Volga becomes sandy and unproductive. The soil of Little Russia and the Polish Ukraine is partly sandy and not very fruitful, partly very rich and fertile. A great part of Western Russia is sandy, and intersected by vast marshes and bogs. Large tracts are covered with immense forests, the retreat of the bear, wolf, and wild boar; whilst not an inconsiderable portion of this westerly territory ranks amongst the most fertile in the empire.</p><p>It thus appears, with regard to the soil of Russia, taking a summary view of it along with the climate, that from the forty-fourth to the fiftieth parallel of north latitude, comprising Bessarabia, Podolia, Kherson, Ikaterinoslav, and Taurida, it is for the most part low and level, little wooded, partly very fruitful, partly arid and unfruitful, and here and there impregnated with salt. The winters are short, with little snow; but in some parts the cold is severe. The spring is early and mild ; the summer is of long duration, with oppressive heat and little rain ; autumn follows late in the year. In the heat of summer a dangerous disease called <hi rend="italic">jassia</hi>  is generated ; it is fatal to the lower animals as well as to man. Violent whirlwinds are frequent. The south of Russia is subject to a north-easterly wind called <hi rend="italic">mitel,</hi>  often accompanied by snow, which is drifted with great violence, and much dreaded by the inhabitants.
