<p><span class="font3">product is not a single cell, but a fructification termed </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">cystocarp </span><span class="font3">(Red Algae), or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ascocarp</span><span class="font3"> (Ascomycetes) or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">aecidium</span><span class="font3"> (Uredincae),&nbsp;containing many spores </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(carpospores).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As a consequence of the diversity in the sexual organs and cells, in the details of the sexual act, and in the product of it, several&nbsp;modes of the sexual process have to be distinguished, which may be&nbsp;conveniently summarized as follows:—</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Isogamy:</span><span class="font2"> the sexual process consists in the fusion of either&nbsp;two similar sexual cells </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(isogametes),</span><span class="font2"> or two similar sexual organs&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(gametangia) : </span><span class="font2">it is termed conjugation, and the product is a&nbsp;.zygoj/we. Itsvarietiesare:—-</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(a)</span><span class="font2"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gametes ciliated and free-swimming </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(planogametes),</span><span class="font2"> set</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">free into the water where they meet and fuse: lower Green Algae (Protococcaceae, Pandorineae, most&nbsp;Siphonaceae and Confervaceae) ; some Brown Algae (Phaeo-sporeae) :</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(b)</span><span class="font2"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gametangia fuse in pairs, and a gamete is differentiated in</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">each: the gametes of each pair fuse, but are not set free and are not ciliated (the Conjugate Green Algae): or, no&nbsp;gametes are differentiated, the undifferentiated contents of the gametangia fusing (Mucorinae among the&nbsp;Fungi).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">II. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Oogamy:</span><span class="font2"> male and female organs distinct: thc protoplasm&nbsp;•of the female organ is differentiated into one or (rarely) more&nbsp;oospheres which usually remain enclosed in the female organ : the&nbsp;contents of the male organ are usually differentiated into one or&nbsp;more male cells: the process is fertilization, the product is an&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">oospore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(A) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sexual organs are unicellular (or coenocytic as in certain&nbsp;Siphonaceous Green Algae and in the Oomycetous Fungi); the&nbsp;female organ is an </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">oogonium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(a) </span><span class="font2">The male organ is an </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">antheridium</span><span class="font2"> giving rise to one or more free-swimming ciliated Spermatozoids:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The oogonium contains a single oosphere which is fertilized</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">in situ:</span><span class="font2"> higher Green Algae </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Volvox, Vaucheria, Oedogonium, Coleochaete,</span><span class="font2"> Characeae) ; some Brown&nbsp;Algae </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Tiiopteris)*,</span><span class="font2"> among the Fungi, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Monoblepharis,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">the only fungus known to have Spermatozoids:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(2)</span><span class="font2"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The oogonium produces </span><span class="font3">a </span><span class="font2">single oosphere which is extruded</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">and is IertilizedJn the water: </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Dictyota</span><span class="font2"> and some Fucaceae (Brown Algae) f</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The oogonium contains several oospheres which are fertilized</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">in situ : SPhaeroplea</span><span class="font2"> (Siphonaceous Green Alga) :</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The oogonium produces more than one oosphere (2-8) which</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">are extruded and are fertilized in the water: certain Brown Algae </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Pelvetia, Ascophyllum, Fucus) :</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(ß)</span><span class="font2"> The male organ is a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">pollinodium</span><span class="font2"> which applies itself closely to the oogonium : the amorphous male cell is not ciliated&nbsp;and is not set free :</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The oogonium contains a single oosphere which is fertilized</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">in situ :</span><span class="font2"> Peronosporaceae (Oomycetes) :</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The oogonium contains several oospheres; Saprolegnia-</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ceae: but it is debated whether or not fertilization actually takes place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(B) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The male and female organs are (as a rule) multicellular;&nbsp;the male organ is an </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">antheridium,</span><span class="font2"> the female an </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">archegonium:</span><span class="font2"> the&nbsp;archegonium always contains a single oosphere which is fertilized&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">in situ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(a) </span><span class="font2">Thc male cell is a free-swimming ciliated Spermatozoid: the antheridium produces more than one (usually very&nbsp;many) spermatozoïde, each of which is developed in a&nbsp;single cell: all Bryophyta (mosses, &amp;c.) and Pterido-phyta (ferns, &amp;c.) : thc only Phanerogams in which&nbsp;Spcrmatozoids have been observed are the gymno-Spermous species </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ginkgo biloba, Cycas revoluta, Zamia&nbsp;integrifolia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(ß)</span><span class="font2"> The male cell is amorphous and passes directly from the pollen-tube into the oosphere </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(siphonogamy)</span><span class="font2"> : all Phanerogams except the species just mentioned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It must be explained that in the angiospermous Phanerogams, thc male and female organs are so'reduced that each is represented&nbsp;by only a single cell : the male, by the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">generative celt,</span><span class="font2"> formed in the&nbsp;pollen-grain, which usually divides into two male cells : the female,&nbsp;by the oosphere. The gradual reduction can be traced through the&nbsp;Gymnosperms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Attention may here be drawn to the fact (see Angiosperms) that, in several cases, the second male cell has been seen to enter&nbsp;the cmbryo-sac from the pollen-tube, and its nucleus to fuse with&nbsp;thc definitive nucleus (endosperm-nucleus) or with one of the polar&nbsp;nuclei.. The significance of this remarkable observation is discussed in the section on the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Physiology of Reproduction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">III. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Carpogamy:</span><span class="font2"> the sexual organs are (as a rule) differentiated&nbsp;into male and female: the protoplasm of the unicellular or multicellular female organ (archicarp, procarp) is never differentiated&nbsp;into an oosphere: in many cases definite male cells, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">spermatia,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">are produced and are set free, but they are not ciliated, and frequently have a cell-wall: the process is </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">fertilization:</span><span class="font2"> the product&nbsp;is a fructification derived essentially from the female organ containing several (sometimes very many) spores </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(carpospores) :&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">characteristic of the Red Algae and of the Ascomycetous Fungi.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(A) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are definite male cells </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(spermatia) :</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(a) </span><span class="font2">Thc female organ is a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">procarp,</span><span class="font2"> consisting of an elongated, closed, receptive filament, the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">trichogyne,</span><span class="font2"> and of a basal</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fertile portion, the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Carpogonium:</span><span class="font2"> on fertilization the</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">latter grows and gives rise directly or indirectly to a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">cysto-</span><span class="font2">carp: the spermatia are each formed in a unicellular antheridium and have no cell-wall at first: they fuse&nbsp;with the tip of the trichogyne: Red Algae (Rhodophyceae&nbsp;or Florideae) :</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">G8) The female organ </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(archicarp)</span><span class="font2"> resembles the preceding: in fertilization the fertile portion </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(ascogonium)</span><span class="font2"> develops into&nbsp;an </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ascocarp</span><span class="font2"> containing one or more asci (sporangia) each&nbsp;containing usually eight </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ascospores:</span><span class="font2"> the spermatia are&nbsp;formed by abstriction from the filaments </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(sterigmata)&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">lining special receptacles, the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Spermogonia</span><span class="font2">, which are the&nbsp;male organs: certain Ascomycetous Fungi </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(e.g.</span><span class="font2"> Laboul-beniaceae, some Lichen-Fungi, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Polystigma).</span><span class="font2"> For the&nbsp;Uredineae, see </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Abnormalities of Reproduction,</span><span class="font2"> below).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(B) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no definite male cells : the more or less distinct&nbsp;male and female organs come into contact, and their undifferentiated contents fuse: the product is an </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ascocarp:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(a)</span><span class="font2"> The male and Jemale organs are obviously different : the female organ is an </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ascogonium,</span><span class="font2"> the male a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">pollinodium:&nbsp;e.g. Pyronema, Sphaerotheca</span><span class="font2"> (Ascomycetes) :</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(3) The male and female organs are quite similar: </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">e.g. Eremas-cus, Dipodascus</span><span class="font2"> (Ascomycetes).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It may be explained that carpogamy is the expression of sexual degeneration. In the cases last mentioned, when the sexual organs&nbsp;are quite similar, they have reverted to the condition of gametangia.&nbsp;Still further reduction is observable in other Ascomycetes in which&nbsp;one of the. sexual organs, presumably the male, is either much&nbsp;reduced or is altogether wanting. Again in the Tusts (Uredineae),&nbsp;there are spermatia, but they are functionless (see section on&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Abnormalities of Reproduction).</span><span class="font2"> In the highest Fungi, the Auto-basidiomycetes, no sexual organs have been discovered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Details of the Sexual Act.—</span><span class="font3">It has been already stated that the sexual act consists in the fusion of two masses of protoplasm,&nbsp;commonly cells, derived from two organs of opposite sex? but&nbsp;this is only the first stage in the process. The second stage is the&nbsp;fusion of the nuclei, which usually follows quickly upon the fusion&nbsp;of the cells; but nuclear fusion may be postponed so that the two&nbsp;sexual nuclei may be observed in the zygote, as “ conjugate ”&nbsp;nuclei, and even in the cells of the organism developed from the&nbsp;zygote </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(e.g.</span><span class="font3"> Uredineae). The result of nuclear fusion is that the&nbsp;nucleus of the zygote contains the double number of chromosomes—that is, if the number of chromosomes in each of the&nbsp;fusing sexual nuclei be </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">x,</span><span class="font3"> the number in the nucleus of the zygote&nbsp;will be </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">2x.</span><span class="font3"> Moreover, this double number persists in aU the&nbsp;cells of the organism developed from the zygote, until it is&nbsp;reduced to one-balf by meiosis preceding either the development&nbsp;of the spores, or, less commonly, the development of the sexual&nbsp;cells. But there is yet a third stage, which consists in thc&nbsp;temporary fusion of the chromosomes belonging to the two&nbsp;sexual nuclei. This always takes place as a preliminary to&nbsp;meiosis; it may be in the germinating zygote, or after many&nbsp;generations of cells have been formed from it. At the onset of&nbsp;meiosis the (2x) chromosomes are seen to be double, one of each&nbsp;pair having been derived from the male and the female cell&nbsp;respectively: the chromosomes of each pair then fuse so that&nbsp;their chromomeres unite along their length, constituting the&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">pseudo-chromosomes.</span><span class="font3"> The paired chromosomes separate and&nbsp;eventually go to form tbe two daughter-nuclei, one to each, which&nbsp;thus have half </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(x)</span><span class="font3"> the original number of chromosomes. The&nbsp;daughter-nuclei at once divide homotypically, retaining the&nbsp;reduced </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(x)</span><span class="font3"> number of chromosomes to form the four nuclei of a&nbsp;tetrad of spores (more rarely, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e.g. Fucus,</span><span class="font0"> of </span><span class="font3">sexual cells).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">III. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Lifc-history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It will have been gathered from the foregoing sections that plants generally arc capable of both sexual and asexual reproduction; and, further, that in different stages of their life-history&nbsp;they possess the diploid </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(ix)</span><span class="font3"> number of chromosomes in their&nbsp;nuclei, or the haploid (x) number. It may be at once stated&nbsp;that, in all plants in which sexual reproduction and true meiotic&nbsp;spore-formation exist, these two modes of reproduction are&nbsp;restricted to distinct forms of thc plant; the sexual form bears&nbsp;only thc sexual organs and is haploid; the asexual form only</span></p>
