<p><span class="font2">speculate, and at fifteen left home to study Buddhism in Tibet, where his criticisms on the Lama-worship gave much&nbsp;offence. After some years’ travel he returned, but, his anti-idolatrous sentiments obliging him to leave home, he lived&nbsp;at Benares until his father’s death in 1803. After this,&nbsp;he spent about ten years in the East India Company’s&nbsp;service, latterly as dewAn or head officer in the collection&nbsp;of revenues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During this period he first began to assemble his friends together for evening discussions on the absurdities of&nbsp;idolatry, and he also issued his first work, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tuhfat-al&nbsp;Muwalddddin</span><span class="font2"> (“A Gift to Monotheists ”). This treatise&nbsp;was in Persian, with an Arabic preface, and was a bold&nbsp;protest against superstition and priestcraft. These proceedings brought on him much hostility, and even persecution, and in 1814 he retired to Calcutta for greater&nbsp;safety. Here he soon established a little Friendly Society&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">{Atmiya Sabhd),</span><span class="font2"> which met weekly to read the Hindu&nbsp;Scriptures and to chant monotheistic hymns. In 1816 he&nbsp;translated the VedAnta into Bengali and Hindustani,&nbsp;following this by a series of translations from the Upani-shads into Bengali, Hindustani, and English, with introductions and comments of his own. These works he published at his own expense and disseminated widely among&nbsp;his countrymen. His writings excited much opposition&nbsp;and gave rise to numerous controversies, in which his&nbsp;ability, tact, and learning rendered him fully a match for&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">his</span><span class="font0"> </span><span class="font2">antagonists. But the deadliest blow which he inflicted&nbsp;upon Hindu superstition was his effective agitation against&nbsp;the rite of suttee, the burning of living widows on the&nbsp;funeral piles of their deceased husbands. In 1811 he had&nbsp;been a horrified witness of this sacrifice in his elder&nbsp;brother’s family, and had vowed never to rest until he&nbsp;had uprooted the custom. He exposed the hollow pretences of its advocates in elaborate pamphlets, both in&nbsp;Bengali and English, and pressed the matter in every&nbsp;possible way, till at last the tide of public feeling turned,&nbsp;and on December 4, 1829, Lord William Bentinck issued&nbsp;a regulation abolishing suttee throughout all the territories subject to Fort William. RAmmohun was an active&nbsp;politician and philanthropist. He built schoolhouses and&nbsp;established schools in which useful knowledge was gratuitously taught through the medium both of the English and&nbsp;the native languages. He wrote a suggestive Bengali grammar, of which he published one version in English (1826)&nbsp;and one in Bengali (1833). He wrote valuable pamphlets&nbsp;on Hindu law, and made strenuous exertions for the&nbsp;freedom of the native press; he also established (1822) and&nbsp;mainly conducted two native newspapers, the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sambad&nbsp;Kaumudi</span><span class="font2"> in Bengali, and (if rightly identified) the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mirat-al-Akhbar</span><span class="font2"> in Persian, and made them the means of diffusing&nbsp;much useful political information. Becoming interested in&nbsp;Christianity, he learned Hebrew and Greek in order to read&nbsp;the Bible in the original languages; and in 1820 he issued&nbsp;a selection from the four Gospels entitled </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Precepts of&nbsp;Jesus, the Guide to Peace and Happiness.</span><span class="font2"> This was&nbsp;attacked by the Baptist missionaries of Serampur, and a&nbsp;long controversy ensued, in which he published three&nbsp;remarkable </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Appeals to the Christian Public in Defence of&nbsp;the “ Precepts of Jesusfi</span><span class="font2"> He also wrote other theological&nbsp;tracts (sometimes under assumed names) in which he&nbsp;attacked both Hindu and Christian orthodoxy with a&nbsp;strong hand. But his personal relations with orthodox&nbsp;Christians were never unfriendly, and he rendered valuable&nbsp;assistance to Dr Duff in the latter’s educational schemes.&nbsp;He also warmly befriended a Unitarian Christian Mission&nbsp;which was started in Calcutta (1824) by Mr William&nbsp;Adam, formerly a Baptist missionary, who, in attempting&nbsp;to convert Rammohun to Trinitarianism, had himself been&nbsp;converted to the opposite view. This Unitarian Mission,&nbsp;though not a theological success, attracted considerable&nbsp;sympathy among the Hindu monotheists, whose Atmiya&nbsp;SabhA had then become extinct. At last Riimmohun felt&nbsp;able to re-embody his cherished ideal, and on August 20,&nbsp;1828, he opened the first “ BrAhmya Association” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">{Brahma&nbsp;Sabha)</span><span class="font2"> at a hired house. A suitable church building was&nbsp;then erected and placed in the hands of trustees, with a&nbsp;small endowment and a remarkable trust-deed by which&nbsp;the building was set apart “ for the worship and adoration&nbsp;of the Eternal, Unsearchable, and Immutable Being who&nbsp;is the Author and Preserver of the universe.” The new&nbsp;church was formally opened on the Ilth MAgh (January 23)&nbsp;1830, from which day the BrAhma SamAj dates its&nbsp;existence. Having now succeeded in his chief projects,&nbsp;RAmmohun resolved to visit England, and the king of&nbsp;Delhi appointed him his envoy thither on special business,&nbsp;and gave him the title of rAjA. He arrived in England on&nbsp;April 8, 1831, and was received with universal cordiality&nbsp;and respect. He watched with special anxiety the parliamentary discussions on the renewal of the East India&nbsp;Company’s charter, and gave much valuable evidence before&nbsp;the Board of Control on the condition of India. This he&nbsp;republished with additional suggestions </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">{Exposition of the&nbsp;Practical Operation of the Judicial and Revenue Systems of&nbsp;Indlid),</span><span class="font2"> and also reissued his important </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Essay on the Right&nbsp;of Hindus over Ancestral Property</span><span class="font2"> (1832). He visited&nbsp;France, and wished to visit America, but died unexpectedly&nbsp;of brain fever at Bristol, September 27, 1833.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">His Bengali and Sanskrit works were lately reissued in one volume, by RAjnArAin Bose and A. C. VedAntabAgish (Calcutta,&nbsp;1880), and bis English works will shortly be published in two&nbsp;volumes by Esbanchanilra Bose.

In&nbsp;1746, at the age of twenty, when an assistant in the office&nbsp;of Colonel Watson, deputy quartermaster-general in North&nbsp;Britain, he began the survey of the mainland of Scotland,&nbsp;the results of which were embodied in what is known as&nbsp;the “duke of Cumberland’s map.” In 1756 he obtained&nbsp;a lieutenancy in the 51st regiment, and proceeded with it&nbsp;to Germany, where his talents as a military draughtsman&nbsp;brought him to notice, and procured him rapid promotion.&nbsp;He ultimately reached the rank of major-general. In 1784,&nbsp;while deputy quartermaster-general at the Horse Guards,&nbsp;his services were called into request for conducting the&nbsp;observations for determining the relative positions of the&nbsp;French and English royal observatories. His measurement of a base line for that purpose on Hounslow Heath&nbsp;in 1784, which was destined to be the germ of all subsequent surveys of the Unitçd Kingdom, gained him the gold&nbsp;medal of the Royal Society of London. Owing to unforeseen delays, the triangulation for connecting the meridians&nbsp;of the two observatories was not carried out until 1787.&nbsp;He had completed his undertaking, and λvas finishing an&nbsp;account of it for the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Phil.

The royal household itself had,&nbsp;in its turn, groλvn out of an earlier and more primitive&nbsp;institution.
