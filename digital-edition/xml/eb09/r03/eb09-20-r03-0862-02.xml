<p><label>ROSTOFF</label>
on Lake Nero, a district town of Russia, in the government of Yaroslavl, and 35 miles by rail southwest of Yaroslavl, is probably the oldest town of northeastern Russia. Its present importance is due to its fair, which rapidly developed towards the close of last century, and still remains a market where prices of cotton wares are established preliminary to the great fair of Nijni-Nov-gorod, and where a brisk exchange in various kinds of raw materials and unmanufactured articles is carried on. The specialty of Rostoff is the production of a variety of kitchen-garden produce and apothecary’s herbs. Chicory and dried sweet peas are the principal objects of trade; in 1880 350,000 cwts., chiefly of kitchen-garden produce, were exported. Another industry formerly developed in consequence of the great influx of pilgrims—that of painting sacred pictures on a kind of enamel—still continues to flourish. The saddlery and linen manufactures, and the fishing, may likewise be mentioned. The population of Eostoff in 1883 was 12,500.</p><p>Rostoff was founded by the Slavonians in territory formerly occupied by the (Finnish) Meres, and it played so prominent a part in the history of that part of Russia that it used to be known as Rostoff the Great. From the beginning of the Ilth century to the 13th it was the chief town of the great Rostoff territory, which included large parts of the present governments of Yaroslavl, Vladimir, and Novgorod, and seems to have been a populous city. After the Mongolian invasion it rapidly declined, and in 1474 it was purchased by Ivan III. and annexed to the growing Moscow principality. It was repeatedly plundered by Tartars, Lithuanians, and Poles in the 15th, 16th, and 17th centuries. Its cathedral, built in 1231, still stands, notwithstanding numerous conflagrations ; some of the relics it contains are more than eight centuries old. Another church is of still older date, having been built in 1216. Each of its five monasteries has venerated relics of renowned Christian missionaries or Russian princes.</p>
