<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">REFORMATORY AXD INDUSTRIAL SCHOOLS. There exist two classes of schools for the reformation and&nbsp;industrial training of children in Great Britain and Ireland,&nbsp;both under state control when duly certified. Reformatory&nbsp;schools are for the better training of juvenile convicted&nbsp;offenders; industrial schools, in which industrial training&nbsp;is provided, are chiefly for vagrant and neglected children&nbsp;and children not convicted of theft. These schools are of&nbsp;modern but gradual growth, the result in part of humane&nbsp;endeavours to rescue children from evil courses already&nbsp;embarked on or likely to be their lot, in part of the conviction that, as a matter of social economy, the expenditure incurred in early restraint is less costly than the&nbsp;punishment of matured crime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">England and Scotland</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">.—The Acts of Parliament relating to reformatory and industrial schools in Great Britain were&nbsp;consolidated and amended in 1866; and these Acts (29 and&nbsp;30 Yict. cc. 117, 118), with local legislation and some extension and amendment, govern the two classes of schools&nbsp;at the present time. Both reformatory and industrial&nbsp;schools are certified by the home secretary upon the application of the managers, and upon a satisfactory inspection&nbsp;and report, and subject to a yearly visit by inspectors. In&nbsp;both classes industrial training is an essential feature, so&nbsp;as to engender industrious habits in the inmates and give&nbsp;them the means of earning an honest livelihood. Not&nbsp;only local circumstances but reasonable individual inclinations are taken into consideration. In rural districts the&nbsp;cultivation of the soil and in urban districts local trades&nbsp;are obvious sources of employment; the duties of a sailor&nbsp;are taught in training ships near the coast. Occupations&nbsp;that create a distaste for labour or that do not provide a&nbsp;permanent source of profitable labour for adults are avoided.&nbsp;The managers (often a committee of magistrates) make all&nbsp;necessary rules for the management and discipline of the&nbsp;schools, subject to the provisions of the legislature and&nbsp;the intervention of the secretary of state. They have the&nbsp;appointment of officers. Conformity to the rules and&nbsp;residence in the schools may be enforced by imprisonment,&nbsp;the application and limits of which vary somewhat in&nbsp;reformatory and industrial schools, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> such imprisonment&nbsp;for school offences is confined in industrial schools to&nbsp;children above ten, an age almost always exceeded in the&nbsp;inmates of reformatories. Attention is paid in both classes&nbsp;to religious convictions, and as far as possible a selection&nbsp;is made of a school conducted in accordance with the&nbsp;creed professed by the child or its responsible guardians.&nbsp;Children after eighteen months’ detention may be placed&nbsp;out on licence with trustworthy persons and with their&nbsp;own consent. The managers of a reformatory or of an industrial school may decline to receive the youthful offender&nbsp;in the one case and in the other the child proposed to be&nbsp;sent; but the reception of a child operates as an undertaking by the managers to educate, clothe, lodge, and feed&nbsp;him (or her) until he (or she) can be legally discharged&nbsp;or is removed. Reformatory and industrial schools are,&nbsp;hoAvever, essentially distinct in character and governed by&nbsp;distinct Acts of Parliament: a school cannot at the same&nbsp;time be both a certified industrial school and a certified&nbsp;reformatory school. The Middlesex Industrial School for&nbsp;juvenile offenders, established under local Acts, and in&nbsp;part a certified industrial school, is, however, somewhat&nbsp;exceptional in blending the treatment of both classes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Any offender under sixteen, convicted of an offence punishable with penal servitude or imprisonment and&nbsp;sentenced to be imprisoned for ten days or a longer tenn,&nbsp;may be sent to a certified reformatory school for not less&nbsp;than two and not more than five years. A youthful&nbsp;offender under ten cannot be sent to a reformatory school&nbsp;unless he has been previously charged with some crime</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">or offence punishable with penal servitude or imprisonment, or is sentenced in England by a judge of assize or court of&nbsp;general or quarter sessions or in Scotland by a circuit court&nbsp;of justiciary or a sheriff. Youthful offenders receiving a&nbsp;conditional pardon may now be sent to a certified reformatory school. Certified industrial schools receive any child&nbsp;apparently under fourteen </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">avIio </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">is brought by any person&nbsp;before justices as answering to any of the following descriptions :—if found begging or receiving alms (w׳hether&nbsp;actually or under the pretext of selling or offering for sale&nbsp;anything) or being in any street or public place for these&nbsp;purposes; if found wandering and not having any home&nbsp;or settled place of abode, or proper guardianship, or visible&nbsp;means of subsistence; if found destitute, either being an&nbsp;orphan or having a surviving parent who is undergoing&nbsp;penal servitude or imprisonment; if it frequents the company of reputed thieves; if lodging, living, or residing with&nbsp;common or reputed prostitutes, pr in a house resided in or&nbsp;frequented by prostitutes for the purpose of prostitution;&nbsp;if it frequents the company of prostitutes (43 and 44&nbsp;Yict. c. 15); where a parent or step-parent represents to&nbsp;the magistrates that he is unable to control a child and&nbsp;that he desires that the child be sent to an industrial&nbsp;school; where the guardians of the poor represent that a&nbsp;child maintained in a Avorkliouse or pauper school or poor-house is refractory or the child of a parent convicted of a&nbsp;crime or offence punishable with penal servitude or imprisonment, and that it is desirable that he be sent to an&nbsp;industrial school. To the above cases have to be added&nbsp;a child apparently under twelve </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">avIio </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">is charged with an&nbsp;offence punishable by imprisonment or a less punishment&nbsp;but has not been in England convicted of felony or in&nbsp;Scotland for theft; and the children of any woman convicted of a crime after a previous conviction, and under&nbsp;her care and control at the time of conviction for the last&nbsp;of such crimes, who have no visible means of subsistence&nbsp;or who are without proper guardianship (Prevention of&nbsp;Crimes Act, 1871).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">A prison authority (a term as regards industrial schools calculated to mislead, as the authority is in general the&nbsp;court of quarter sessions or school boards, and in Scotland&nbsp;commissioners of supply, magistrates of burghs, or county&nbsp;boards) may, with the approval of the secretary of state,&nbsp;establish or contribute toAvards the establishment, building&nbsp;(including borroAving money), or management (and in&nbsp;England may not only contribute to but undertake these&nbsp;matters) of reformatory or industrial schools, or toAvards&nbsp;the support of the inmates, and such authority may contract with the managers for the reception and maintenance&nbsp;of offenders or children. The treasury contributes toAA־ards&nbsp;the custody and maintenance of offenders in reformatory&nbsp;and of children in industrial schools on the recommendation&nbsp;of the secretary of state, the sum being limited as regards&nbsp;children in industrial schools, on the application of their&nbsp;parents or guardians, to 2s. per head per week. The guardians of the poor or the board of management of district&nbsp;pauper schools or parochial boards of a parish or combination may, with the consent in England of the local&nbsp;government, and in Scotland of the board of management,&nbsp;contribute towards the maintenance of children detained&nbsp;in industrial schools. A prison authority in England may&nbsp;contribute toAvards the ultimate disposal of an inmate of&nbsp;a certified industrial school. The parent or other person&nbsp;legally liable to maintain a youthful offender or child in&nbsp;a school is required (if able) to contribute not more than&nbsp;5s. per Aveek, recoverable summarily. The alleged Avant&nbsp;of diligent enforcement of this liability is a great source&nbsp;of complaint.</span></p>
