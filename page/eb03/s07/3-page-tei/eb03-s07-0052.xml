            <p>Ariſtotle ſays, that hogs in general live twenty years ; and adds, that both males
                and females are fertile till they arrive at the ape of fifteen. They can engender at
                the age of nine or twelve months ; but it is better to restrain them till they be
                eighteen months or two years. The firſt litter of the ſow is not numerous ; and,
                when only one year old, her pigs are weak, and even imperfect. She may be ſaid to be
                in ſeaſon at all times. Though full, ſhe ſolicits the approach of the male. This may
                be regarded as an exceſs among animals ; for almoſt every other ſpecies refuſe the
                male after conception. The ardour of the ſow, though almoſt perpetual, is however
                marked by paroxyſms and immoderate movements, which always terminate by her
                wallowing in the mire. She, at the same time, emits a thick whitiſh fluid. She goes
                four months with young ; brings forth in the beginning of the fifth ; and ſoon
                afterwards ſolicits the male, is impregnated a ſecond time, and of courſe brings
                forth twice a-year. The wild ſow, which every way reſembles the domeſtic kind,
                produces only once a-year. This difference in fertility is probably owing to want of
                nouriſhment, and the neceſſity of suckling her pigs much longer than the domeſtic
                ſow, which is never allowed to nurſe her young above fifteen days or three weeks.
                Only eight or nine of the litter are kept longer ; the reſt are fold. In fifteen
                days, pigs are excellent food.</p>
            <p>As theſe creatures, though exceedingly voracious, will feed almoſt on any thing, they
                are bred and kept everywhere, and are quickly and cheaply fatted. In miry and in
                marſhy grounds (From which they are not averſe) they devour worms, frogs, fern,
                ruſh, and sedge roots. In drier and in woody countries, they feed on hips, haws,
                ſloes, crabs, maſt, cheſnuts, acorns, &amp;c. and on this food they will grow fleſhy
                and fat. They are a kind of natural ſcavengers, will thrive on the traſh of an
                orchard, the outcaſts of the kitchen, the ſweepings of barns and granaries, the
                offals of a market, and moſt richly on the refuſe of a dairy. If near the sea, they
                will ſearch the ſhores for ſhell fiſh ; in the fields, they eat grass ; and in
                cities and large towns they are kept in great numbers, and ſupported chiefly by
                grains. It is evident that the facility of feeding them everywhere at a ſmall
                expence, is a national benefit, more eſpecially in a country where the people are
                accuſtomed to eat fleſh daily, and could not perhaps perform their daily labour if
                they did not. It is no less obſervable, that notwithſtanding this facility of
                feeding, and the multitudes of ſwine maintained, they ſeldom fail of coming to a
                good market. In no part of Europe is the management of theſe creatures better
                understood than in Britain. The time of farrowing is adjuſted to the nature of the
                farm, the food it can ſupply ; and the number of pigs sold and kept are in like
                manner adjuſted. New kinds of food, more wholeſome and nutritive than what were uſed
                formerly, have been introduced, ſuch as turnips, carrots, clover, &amp;c. They are
                in moſt places regularly managed and cloſely attended. Tuſſer, many years ſince,
                affirmed from his own experience, that a ſow might bring as much profit as a cow. In
                ſome counties, it is ſaid, a ſow dependent on a dairy hath produced, all expences
                deducted, about 10 l. in the ſpace of a year. It may be ſome ſatisfaction to the
                reader to know, that, on a nice calculation, the annual profits of a ſow in France
                are found to be between 50 and 60 livres.— In Britain, theſe animals in different
                counties are of very different ſizes. In Leiceſterſhire, Northamptonshire, and
                Pembrokeſhire, they are very large. In Hampshire, Wiltſhire, and wherever they can
                run in the woods, and feed on maſt and acorns, their fleſh is firmer and better. The
                Chineſe ſwine are common with us : they are ſmaller, blacker, and their legs ſhorter
                than ours : ſo that, when fat, their bellies literally touch the ground. They thrive
                exceedingly well with us, are very prolific, and their fleſh very fine and
                well-taſted.</p>
            <p>In conſidering the advantages derived from theſe creatures, it is to be obſerved,
                that the fleſh of all their different kinds, and at all ages, is looked upon as a
                very ſubſtantial and agreeable aliment; and of courſe, in their proper ſeaſons, the
                different sorts of proviſions thus ſupplied are all of them very ſaleable. The wild
                boar was eſteemed a prime delicacy amongſt the Romans, and the fleſh of the tame was
                much more in favour with our anceſtors than with us ; though <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >brawn</hi> has ſtill many admirers, is made in the greateſt perfection, and
                conſidered as a rarity peculiar to this country. Pork, though it might be wisely
                prohibited in ſome warm countries, is found by experience equally nutritive and
                ſalutary here. As ſuch it furniſhes a very large proportion of that food which is
                vended in our markets. It takes salt better, and keeps longer, than the fleſh of any
                other animal; and the conſumption of it is prodigious when pickled or ſalted, more
                eſpecially in our foreign garriſons and in the ſea-ſervice. Our bacon is differently
                cured, ſo as to render it acceptable to all palates ; and our hams are not at all
                inferior to thoſe of other countries. Freſh pork fells nearly as dear as beef ; the
                lard brings double or triple the price ; the blood, the inteſtines, the feet, and
                the tongue, are all prepared as food. The fat of the inteſtines and web, which
                differs from common lard, is employed for greaſing axles of wheels, and for many
                other purpoſes. Sieves are made of the ſkin ; and bruſhes, pencils, &amp;c. of the
                briſtles. The dung is reputed next in value to that of ſheep. Mr Worlidge @@*
                propoſes that ſwine ſhould be turned into a cloſe well- paled, and planted with
                greens, pulſe, and roots, on which they may feed, and by their trampling and their
                dung raiſe a great quantity of excellent soil. Mr Mortimer @@* aſſures us that ſome,
                on poor light ſhallow land in Staffordſhire, ſow a ſmall white pea, which they never
                reap, but turn in ſo many hogs to eat them as they think they will fat ; and there
                they lie day and night, and their dung will ſo enrich the land, that it will bring a
                good ſward upon it, and will graze many years afterwards. Our old huſbandmen had an
                ill opinion of this dung, as ſupposing it bred weeds, but it will probably not
                obtain much credit at present. In some places they waſh with hogs dung for want of
                ſoap ; which anſwers tolerably well, it the linen hangs long enough in the air to
                become thoroughly ſweet.</p>
            <p>The wild boar was formerly a native of our country, as appears from the laws of Hoel
                dda, who permitted his grand huntſman to chace that animal from the middle of
                November to the beginning of December. William the Conqueror puniſhed with the loss
                of their eyes any that were convicted of killing the wild boar, the flag, or the
                roebuck ; and Fitz-Stephen tells us, that the vaſt foreſt that in his time grew on
                the north side of London, was the retreat of ſtags, fallow-deer, wild boars, and
                bulls. Charles I. turned out wild boars in the New Foreſt, Hampſhire ; but they were
                deſtroyed in the civil wars.</p>
            <p>On the continent the wild boar is hunted with dogs, or killed by ſurpriſe during the
                night, when the moon ſhines. As he runs ſlowly, leaves a ſtrong odour behind him,
                and defends himſelf againſt the dogs, and often wounds them dangerouſly, fine
                hunting dogs are unneceſſafy, and would have their noſe ſpoiled, and acquire a habit
                of moving ſlowly by hunting him. Maſtiffs, with very little training, are
                ſufficient. The oldeſt, which are known by the tract of their ſect, ſhould only be
                attacked : A young boar of three years old is difficult to hunt down ; becauſe he
                runs very far without stopping. But the older boars do not run far, allow</p>
