<p><span class="font2">ties. He publiſhed many books, which Teiſſier eou-merates. Ramus’s merit in his oppoſition to Ariſtotle, and his firmneſs in undermining his authority, is unque-ſtionably great. But it has been doubted, and with&nbsp;much reaſon, whether he was equally ſucceſsful in his&nbsp;attempts after a new logical inſtitute. we have the&nbsp;following general outline of his plan in Dr Enfield’s&nbsp;Hiſtory of Philoſophy. “ Conſidering dialectics as the&nbsp;art of deducing concluſions from premiſes, he endeavours to improve this art, by uniting it with that of&nbsp;rhetoric. 0f the ſeveral branches ot rhetoric, he conſiders invention and diſpoſition as belonging equally to&nbsp;logic. Making Cicero his chief guide, he divides his&nbsp;treatiſe on dialectics into two parts, the firſt of which&nbsp;treats of the invention of arguments, the ſecond of&nbsp;judgments. Arguments he derives not only from what&nbsp;the Ariſtotelians call middle terms, but from any kind of&nbsp;propoſition, which, connected with another, may ſervc&nbsp;to prove any aſſertion. of theſe he enumerates various&nbsp;kinds. Judgments he divides into axioms, or ſelf-evi-dent propoſitions, and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">diant&gt;'ea,</span><span class="font2"> or deductions by means&nbsp;of a ſeries of arguments. Both theſe he divides into&nbsp;various claſſes ; and illuſtrates the whole by examples&nbsp;from the ancient orators and poets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">&quot; In the logic of Ramus, many things are borrowed from Ariſtotle, and only appear under new names ; and&nbsp;many others are derived from other Grecian ſources,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">particularly from the dialogues of Plato, and the logic of the Stoics. The author has the merit of turning&nbsp;the art of reaſoning from the futile ſpeculations of the&nbsp;fchools to forenſic and common uſe ; Rut his plan is&nbsp;defective in confining the whole dialectic art to the&nbsp;ſingle object σf diſputation, and in omitting many&nbsp;things, which reſpect the general culture of the underſtanding and the inveſtigation of truth. Notwithſtanding the defects of his ſyſtem, we cannot, however,&nbsp;ſubſcribe to the ſevere cenſure which has been paſſed&nbsp;upon Ramus by Lord Bacon and others ; for much&nbsp;is, we think, due to him for having with ſo much&nbsp;firmneſs and perſeverance aſſerted the natural freedom of the human underſtanding. The logic of Ramus obtained great authority in the ſchools of Germany, Great Britain, Holland, and France ; and long&nbsp;and violent conteſts aroſe between his followers and&nbsp;thoſe of the Stagyrite, till his fame vaniſhed before&nbsp;that of Deſcartes.”</span></p>
