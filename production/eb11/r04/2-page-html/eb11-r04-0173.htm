<p><span class="font2">Soon he was in the full tide of prosperity. He removed to Great Newport Street, near the residence of Sir Joshua, whose&nbsp;fame in portraiture he began to rival in such works as “ Sir&nbsp;George and Lady Warren ” and “ Mrs Yates as the Tragic&nbsp;Muse”; and his professional income rose to £1200 a year.&nbsp;But this marked increase in his popularity had the effect of&nbsp;enlarging his ambitions, and he became anxious to attempt&nbsp;subjects which required more experience than he possessed.&nbsp;Realizing as he did the need for more thorough knowledge, he&nbsp;was seized with a longing to study in Italy; and in the beginning of 1773 he started for Rome in company with Ozias'&nbsp;Humphrey, the miniature painter. On his arrival he separated&nbsp;himself from his fellow-traveller and his countrymen, and&nbsp;devoted himself to solitary study, raising a scaffold to examine&nbsp;the paintings in the Vatican, and giving much time to work&nbsp;from the undraped model, of which his painting of a “ Wood&nbsp;Nymph ” was a fine and graceful result. At Parma he concentrated himself upon the productions of Correggio, which&nbsp;fascinated him and greatly influenced his practice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In 1775 Romney returned to London, establishing himself in Cavendish Square, and resuming his extensive and lucrative&nbsp;employment as a portrait painter, which in 1785, according to&nbsp;the estimate of his pupil Robinson, yielded him an income of&nbsp;over £3600. The admiration of the town was divided between&nbsp;him and Reynolds. “ There are two factions in art,” said&nbsp;Lord Thurlow, <sup>a</sup> and I am of the Romney faction ”—and the&nbsp;remark, and the rivalry which it implied, caused much annoyance to Sir Joshua, who was accustomed to refer contemptuously to the younger painter as “the man in Cavendish Square.”&nbsp;Alter his return from Italy Romney formed two friendships&nbsp;which powerfully influenced his life. He became acquainted&nbsp;with Hayley, his future biographer, then in the zenith of his&nbsp;little-merited popularity as a poet. His influence on the&nbsp;painter seems to have been far from salutary. Weak himself,&nbsp;he flattered the weaknesses of Romney, encouraged his excessive and morbid sensibility, disturbed him with amateurish&nbsp;fancies and suggestions, and tempted him to expend on slight&nbsp;rapid sketches, and ill-considered, seldom-completed paintings&nbsp;of ideal and poetical subjects, talents which would have found&nbsp;fitter exercise in the steady pursuit of portraiture. About 1783&nbsp;Romney was introduced to Emma Hart, afterwards celebrated&nbsp;as Lady Hamilton, and she became the model from whom he&nbsp;worked incessantly. Her bewitching face smiles from numerous&nbsp;canvases; he painted her as a Magdalene and as a Joan of Arc,&nbsp;as a Circe, a Bacchante^ a Cassandra; and he has himself confessed that she was the inspirer of what was most beautiful in&nbsp;his art. But her fascinations seem to have been too much for&nbsp;the more than middle-aged painter, and they had their own&nbsp;share in aggravating that nervous restlessness and instability,&nbsp;inherent in his nature, which finally ruined both health and&nbsp;mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In 1786 Alderman Boydell started his great scheme of the Shakespeare Gallery, apparently at the suggestion of Romney.&nbsp;The painter at least entered heartily into the plan, and contributed his scene from the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tempest,</span><span class="font2"> and his “ Infant Shakespeare attended by the Passions,” the latter characterized by&nbsp;the Redgraves as one of the best of his subject pictures. Gradually he began to withdraw from portrait painting, to limit the&nbsp;hours devoted, to sitters, and to turn his thoughts to mighty&nbsp;schemes of the ideal subjects which he would execute. Already,&nbsp;in 1792, he had painted “ Milton and his Daughters,” which&nbsp;was followed by “ Newton making Experiments with the&nbsp;Prism.” He was to paint the Seven Ages, Visions of Adam&nbsp;with the Angel, “ six other subjects from Milton—three where&nbsp;Satan is the.hero, and three from Adam and Eve,—perhaps&nbsp;six of each.” Having planned and erected a large studio in&nbsp;Hamsptead, he removed thither in 1797, with the fine collection&nbsp;of casts from the antique which his friend Flaxman had gathered&nbsp;for him in Italy. But his health was now irremediably shattered, and the man was near his end. In the summer of 1799,&nbsp;suffering from great weakness of body and the profoundest&nbsp;depression of mind, he returned to the north, to Kendal, where&nbsp;his deserted but faithful and long-suffering wife received and&nbsp;tended him. He died on the 15th of November 1802.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The art of Romney, especially his figure subjects, suffered greatly from the waywardness and instability of the painter’s&nbsp;disposition, from his want of fixed purpose and sustained energy.&nbsp;He lacked the steadfast perseverance needful to the accomplishment of a great picture. Afflicted as he was throughout his&nbsp;life by an unreasonable timidity and by a self-consciousness&nbsp;which led him at one moment into assertive affectations and at&nbsp;another into exaggerated humility, he avoided the society of&nbsp;his brother artists and lost many opportunities of receiving&nbsp;that frank professional criticism which might have stimulated&nbsp;him to more serious effort. In unwholesome surroundings he&nbsp;steadily deteriorated. His imagination flashed and flickered&nbsp;fitfully upon him, like April sunshine. His fancy would be&nbsp;captivated by a subject, which was presently embodied in a&nbsp;sketch, but the toil of elaborating it into the finished completeness of a painting too frequently overtaxed his powers; he&nbsp;became embarrassed by technical difficulties which, through&nbsp;defective early training, he was unable to surmount, and the&nbsp;half-covered canvas would be turned to the wall. Even in the&nbsp;pictures he finished he was unable to keep to any consistent&nbsp;level of achievement. He produced some fine things, very&nbsp;personal in style and very skilful in handling; but much that&nbsp;he did seems too tentative and too plainly deficient in shrewdness of insight to deserve serious consideration. His colour,&nbsp;too, was often unpleasant, hot and monotonous, and his composition was apt to be stilted and artificial. It is in the best&nbsp;of his portraits that we feel the painter’s real ability. These,&nbsp;especially his female portraits, are full of grace, charm, distinction, and sweetness. When we examine his heads of Cowper&nbsp;and Wilkes, his delicate and dignified full-length of William&nbsp;Beckford, his “ Parson’s Daughter ” in the National Gallery,&nbsp;and his group of the Duchess of Gordon and her Son, we cannot deny his claim to rank as one of the notable portrait&nbsp;painters of 18th-century England.</span></p>

Sidney’s handsome face helped his advancement at court, but the favour in which he was held by the&nbsp;duchess of York, to whom he was master of the robes, led to&nbsp;his dismissal in 1666. His disgrace, however, was short-lived.&nbsp;He was promoted captain in 1667, and colonel in 1678. In&nbsp;1672 he was sent on a mission of congratulation to Louis XIV.,&nbsp;and in 1677 became master of the robes to Charles II. He&nbsp;entered parliament as member for Bramber in 1679, and became&nbsp;a close political ally of his nephew Sunderland, with whose wife&nbsp;he carried on an intrigue which caused considerable scandal.&nbsp;Sunderland made this intimacy a means to further his political&nbsp;ends, while Sidney’s social reputation and his apparent frivolity&nbsp;partly concealed his real capacity for intrigue. Sidney was sent&nbsp;by Sunderland and others in 1679 on a special mission to urge&nbsp;William of Orange to visit England, a task that he was able to&nbsp;discharge while acting as the official envoy of Charles II. at the&nbsp;Hague. He was recalled in 1682, but was again sent on a&nbsp;special mission to Holland in the year of the accession of James&nbsp;II. He returned to England in the spring of 1688, and set to&nbsp;work, at William’s desire, to obtain promises of support for the&nbsp;prince of Orange in the event of his landing. He was presently&nbsp;allowed to leave England on giving his word not to visit the</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
