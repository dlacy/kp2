<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">the navigation of rivers already kept up by weirs, which </span><span class="font0">gave a partial and interrupted navigation, it was uſual&nbsp;to avoid the great expence of the ſecond dam and gate,&nbsp;by making the lock altogether detached from the river, within land, and having its baſon parallel to </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font0">river, and communicating by one end with the river&nbsp;above the weir, and by the other end with the river below the weir, and having a flood-gate at each end.—&nbsp;This was a moſt ingenious thought ; and it was a prodigious improvement, free from all the inconveniences&nbsp;of currents, ice, &amp;c. &amp;c. It was called a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Schluſſel,</span><span class="font0"> or&nbsp;lock, with conſiderable propriety ; and this was the origin of the word </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">flume,</span><span class="font0"> and of our application of its&nbsp;tranſlation </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">lock.</span><span class="font0"> This practice being once introduced,&nbsp;it was not long before engineers found that a complete&nbsp;ſeparation of the navigation ſrom the bed of the river&nbsp;was not only the moſt perfect method for obtaining a&nbsp;ſure, eaſy, and uninterrupted navigation, but that it&nbsp;was in general the moſt ceconomical in its firſt conſtruction, and ſubject to no rifle of deterioration by the action of the current, which was here entirely removed.&nbsp;Locked canals, therefore, have almoſt entirely ſupplant-ed all attempts to improve the natural beds of rivers ;&nbsp;and this is hardly ever attempted except in the flat&nbsp;countries, where they can hardly he ſaid to differ from&nbsp;horizontal canals. We therefore cloſe with theſe obſervations this article, and reſerve what is yet to be ſaid&nbsp;on the conſtruction of canals and locks for the article&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">WATER-Works .</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">We beg leave, however, to detain the reader for </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font0">few moments. He cannot but have obſerved our&nbsp;anxiety to render this diſſertation worthy of his notice, by making it practically uſeful. We have on&nbsp;every occaſion appealed, from all theoretical deductions, however ſpecious and well ſupported, to fact&nbsp;and obſervation of thoſe ſpontaneous phenomena of nature which are continually paſſing in review before us&nbsp;in the motion of running waters. Reſting in this manner our whole doctrines on experiment, on the obſervation of what really happens, and what happens in a&nbsp;way which we cannot or do not fully explain, theſe&nbsp;ſpontaneous operations of nature came inſenſibly to acquire a particular value in our imagination. It has alſo&nbsp;happened in the courſe of our reflections on theſe ſub-jects, that theſe phenomena have frequently preſented&nbsp;themſelves to our view in groups, not leſs remarkable&nbsp;for the extent and the importance of their conſequences&nbsp;than for the ſimplicity, and frequently the ſeeming in-ſignificancy, nay frivolity, of the means employed.&nbsp;Our fancy has therefore been ſometimes warmed with&nbsp;the view of a ſomething ; an</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ens agit ans mo lern, et magno ſe corpore miſcens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This Iras ſometimes made us expreſs ourſelves in a way that is ſuſceptible of miſinterpretation, and may even&nbsp;lead into a miſtake of our meaning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We therefore find ourſelves obliged to declare, that by the term Nature, which we have ſo frequently&nbsp;uſed </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">con amore,</span><span class="font0"> we do not mean that indeſcribable&nbsp;idol which the ſelf-conceit and vanity of our neighbours&nbsp;in France have ſet up of late, and oſtentatiouſly ſtand&nbsp;on tiptoe to worſhip. This </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ens rationis,</span><span class="font0"> this creature&nbsp;of the imagination, has long been the object of cool&nbsp;contemplation in the cloſet of the philoſopher, and has&nbsp;ſhared his attention with many other play-things of his&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ever-working fancy. But ſhe has now become the ob</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">ject of a fincere 3nd fond idolatry, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">being held forth by </span><span class="font0">her zealous high-prieſts to the </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">reſined </span><span class="font0">vanity of man as&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font0">ſort of mirror, in which he may behold his own che-riſhed features, and admire a beauty of his own com-poſition, painted with the moſt delicate glow of humanity, and decked out with every ornament with </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">which&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">the courtly fancies of a Voltaire, a Diderot, a Mirabeau, could contrive, to ſmooth over or to hide all&nbsp;traçes of created imperfection. We leave this idol to&nbsp;the worſhip of her intoxicated and unfortunate votaries.&nbsp;The ſolemn farce in the church of Notre Dame at Paris&nbsp;was an adoration every way worthy of the Divinity ;&nbsp;and our horror in reading the deſcription of the ceremonial was not without ſome allay of pleaſure, when&nbsp;we ſaw among her moſt active prieſts an artiſt, whom&nbsp;we had ſeen a few years before the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rnackiηifte de l<sup>,</sup>opera&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">at St Peteιiburgh, and grand-maſter of the lodge </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">des&nbsp;Moujſes.</span><span class="font0"> We hope to be forgiven the pun, when </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">we&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">ſay that the ancient fabric which was that day profaned&nbsp;by the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">abomination of deſolation,</span><span class="font0"> was then in reality the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">temple de Notre Dame.</span><span class="font0"> Mr Brigonzi was, by his pro-ſeſſion, a fit ſucceſſor in the prieſthood to thoſe </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ſages de&nbsp;lα France</span><span class="font0"> (ſuch was the appellation that they gave each&nbsp;other), whom we have juſt now named ; and his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lours&nbsp;de Theatre,</span><span class="font0"> for which we have frequently admired his&nbsp;talents, were a very proper accompaniment to the fi-neffe and ruſe of theſe </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ſoi-diflant</span><span class="font0"> philoſophers, who,&nbsp;under the maik of the moſt reſined humanity, habitually practiſed arts of diſhoneſty which would have ruined the character of the meaneſt pedlar. No one will&nbsp;think that we expreſs ourſelves too ſtrongly who reflects&nbsp;on the many inſamous tricks played by Voltaire to his&nbsp;bookſellers. No one will think the charge too harſh,&nbsp;when he learns that Diderot, after having pretended to&nbsp;the poſſeſſion of an immenſe library, and ſold it to the&nbsp;empreſs of Ruſſia for an enormous ſum, had to ranſack&nbsp;the warehouſes of the bookſellers of Paris and throughout all Germany, in order to fill his ſhelves. As for&nbsp;Mirabeau, he ſurpaſſes eulogy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Moſt aſſiduous were thoſe apoſtles in ſpreading this fanaticiſm, of which they enjoyed the courtly profits : and we imagine that the employment was as&nbsp;agreeable as it was lucrative ; for we cannot ſuppoſe that Le Kain had more enjoyment, when faſci-nating his Pariſian audience in the character of Voltaire’s Mahomet, than its author felt in the ſide-box,&nbsp;when grinning to himſelf, and conſcious what a fordid&nbsp;and envious wretch he was, he found himſelf crowned&nbsp;by the firſt actreſs, and worſhipped by the audience as&nbsp;the apoſtle of philanthropy and univerſal benevolence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Such was the worſhip, ſſuch were the prieſts, of this Gallic idol; and, like their predeceſſors the Druids, they&nbsp;have made human ſacrifices a cuſtomary oblation at the&nbsp;ſhrine. We wonder at theſe things, and are ſurpriſed&nbsp;that any thing which can even be nicknamed </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ρhilofi-phy</span><span class="font0"> can produce ſuch effects. But the taſlc of this&nbsp;apoſtleſhip was as eaſy as it was agreeable. It was not&nbsp;the work of a day ; it was the completion of a ſtudied&nbsp;corruption of principles, which is now above a century&nbsp;old. We may ſay that it began under the clever but&nbsp;infamous Dubois; who from being the valet de chambre&nbsp;of an infirm biſhop, became cardinal, and ſovereign of&nbsp;the Gallic church, and almoſt of the ſtate. When objected to by the bigotted Louis XIV. (on a preſenta-tion for preferment) as a Janſeniſt, “ </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Oh qui ηon,<sup>,</sup>*&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">ſaid the duke of Orleans, “ </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Oh, Sire, qui non, il η<sup>,</sup>efl</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
