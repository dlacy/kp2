The earl of Marre reſigned the rich eſtate of that name to the lord Erſkine, who laid claim to it as his right; and received in recompenſe, after its erection into an earldom, the territory of Murray, which made an extenſive portion of the poſſeſſions of the carl of Huntley.</p><p>The lady Huntley haſtened to Aberdeen to throw herſelf at the feet of her ſovereign, to make the offer of the moſt humble ſubmiſſions on the part of her huſband, and to avert by every poſſible means the downfal of his greatneſs. But all acceſs to the queen was refuſed to her; and the earl of Huntley was ſummoned to appear in perſon before the privy council, to anſwer for his conduct, and to make a full reſignation of all his caſtles and fortreſſes. He did not preſent himſelf, and was declared to be in open rebellion. A new proclamation was circulated by the queen to collect together a ſufficient ſtrength to ſubdue the inſurgents. The command of her troops was given to the earl of Murray, who put them inſtantly into motion. Huntley advancing towards Abcrdeen to give them battle, was informed of their approach. He halted at Corrichie, ſolacing himſelf with the hope of a deciſive victory. The army of the queen was the moſt numerous; but there were ſeveral companies in it in whom little confidence could be placed. Theſe the earl of Murray poſted in the front of the battle, and commanded them to begin the attack. They recoiled upon him in diſorder, according to his expectation; but a reſolute band in whom he truſted, holding out their ſpears, obliged them to take a different courſe. Their confuſion and flight made Huntley conceive that the day was his own. He therefore ordered his ſoldiers to throw aſide their lances, and to ruſh upon the enemy ſword in hand. His command was obeyed, but with no precaution or diſcipline. When his men came to the place where the earl of Murray had ſtatroned himſelf, the points of the extended ſpears of his firm battalion put a termination to their progreſs. The panic communicated by this unexpected reſiſtance was improved by the vigour with which he preſſed the aſſailants. In their turn they took to flight. The companies of the queen’s army which had given way in the beginning of the conflict were now diſpoſed to atone for their miſconduct; and taking a ſhare in the battle, committed a ſignal ſlaughter upon the retainers of the earl of Huntley. This nobleman himſelf expired in the throng of the purſuit. His ſons Sir John Gordon and Adam Gordon were made priſoners, with the principal gentlemen who had aſſiſted him.</p><p>Mary, upon receiving the tidings of this ſucceſs, diſcovered neither joy nor ſorrow. The paſſions, however, of the earl of Murray and his party were not yet completely gratified. Sir John Gordon was brought immediately to trial, confeſſed his guilt, and was condemned to ſuffer as a traitor. The ſentence accordingly was executed, amidſt a multitude of ſpectators, whoſe feelings were deeply affected, while they conſidered his immature death, the manlineſs of his ſpirit, and the vigour of his form. Adam Gordon, upon account of his tender age, was pardoned; and fines were levied from the other captives of condition according to then wealth. The lord Gordon, after the battle of Corrichie, fled to his father-in-law the duke of Chatel-</p><p>herault, and put himſelf under his protection; but was delivered up by that nobleman, all whoſe endeavours in his favour were ineffectual. He was convicted of treaſon, and condemned; but the queen was ſatisfied with confining him in priſon. The dead body of the earl of Huntley was carried to Edinburgh, and kept without burial, till a charge of high treaſon was preferred againſt him before the three eſtates. An oſtentatious diſplay was made of his criminal enterpriſes, and a verdict of parliament pronounced his guilt. His eſtates, hereditary and moveable, were forfeited; his dignity, name, and memory, were pronounced to be extinct; his enſigns armorial were torn from the book of arms; and his poſterity were rendered unable to enjoy any offices, honour, or rank, within the realm.</p><p>While theſe ſcenes were tranſacting, Mary, who was ſincerely ſolicitous to eſtabliſh a ſecure amity between the two kingdoms, opened a negociation to effectuate an interview with Elizabeth. Secretary Maitland, whom ſhe employed in this buſineſs, met with a moſt gracious reception at the court of London. The city of York was appointed as the place where the two queens ſhould expreſs their mutual love and affection, and bind themſelves to each other in an indiſſoluble union; the day of their meeting was fixed; the faſhion and articles of their interview were adjuſted; and a ſafe-conduct into England was granted to the queen of Scots by Elizabeth. But in this advanced ſtate of the treaty it was unexpectedly interrupted. The diſturbances in France, the perſecution of the Proteſtants there, and the dangerous conſequence which threatened the reformed countries, ſeemed to require Elizabeth to be particularly upon her guard, and to watch with eagerneſs againſt the machinations of the adverſaries of her religion. Upon theſe pretences ſhe declined for a ſeaſon the projected interview; ſending to Mary with this apology Sir Henry Sidney, a miniſter of ability, whom ſhe inſtructed to dive into the ſecret views of the Scottiſh queen. This was a ſevere diſappointment to Mary; but it is reaſonable to believe, that Elizabeth acted in the negociation without ſincerity, and upon principles of policy. It was not her intereſt to admit into her kingdom a queen who had pretenſions to her crown, and who might ſtrengthen them; wſho might raiſe the expectations of her Roman Catholic ſubjects, and advance herſelf in their eſteem; and who far ſurpaſſed her in beauty, and in the bewitching allurement of converſation and behaviour.</p><p>Amidſt affairs of great moment, a matter of ſmaller conſequence, but which is intereſting in its circumſtances, deferves to be recorded. Chatelard, a gentleman of family in Dauphiny, and a relation of the chevalier de Bayard, had been introduced to queen Mary by the ſieur Damville, the heir of the houſe of Montmorency. Poliſhed manners, vivacity, attention to pleaſe, the talent of making verſes, and an agreeable figure, were recommendations to this man. In the court they drew attention to him. He made himſelf neceſtary in all parties of pleaſure at the palace. His aſſiduities drew to him the notice of the queen; and, at different times, ſhe did him the honour to dance with him. His complaiſance became gradually more familiar. He entertained her with his wit and good-humour; he made verſes upon her beauty and accompliſhments; and her politeneſs and condeſcenſion inſinuated</p></body></text></TEI>
