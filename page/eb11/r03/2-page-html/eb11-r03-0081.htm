<p><span class="font0">administration of the university library at Bonn, and by the eight years of labour which carried to success a work of infinite&nbsp;complexity, the famous </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Priscae Latinitatis Monumenta Epi-graphica</span><span class="font0"> (Bonn, 1862). This volume presents in admirable&nbsp;facsimile, with prefatory notices and indexes, the Latin inscriptions from the earliest times to the end of the republic.&nbsp;It forms an introductory volume to the Berlin </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Corpus Inscrip-tionum Latinarum,</span><span class="font0"> the excellence of which is largely due to the&nbsp;precept and example of Ritschl, though he had no hand in the&nbsp;later volumes. The results of RitschPs life are mainly gathered&nbsp;up in a long series of monographs, for the most part of the&nbsp;highest finish, and rich in ideas which have leavened the&nbsp;scholarship of the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As a scholar, RitschI was of the lineage of Bentley, to whom he looked up, like Hermann, with fervent admiration. His&nbsp;best efforts were spent in studying the languages and literatures&nbsp;of Greece and Rome, rather than the life of the Greeks and&nbsp;Romans. He was sometimes, but most unjustly, charged with&nbsp;taking a narrow view of “ Philologie.” That he keenly appreciated the importance of ancient institutions and ancient&nbsp;art both his published papers and the records of his lectures&nbsp;amply testify. He devoted himself for the most part to the&nbsp;study of ancient poetry, and in particular of the early Latin&nbsp;drama. This formed the centre from which his investigations&nbsp;radiated. Starting from this he ranged over the whole remains&nbsp;of pre-Ciceronian Latin, and not only analysed but augmented&nbsp;the sources from which our knowledge of it must come. Before&nbsp;Ritschl the acquaintance of scholars with early Latin was&nbsp;so dim and restricted that it would perhaps be hardly an&nbsp;exaggeration to call him its real discoverer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To the world in general Ritschl was best known as a student of Plautus. He cleared away the accretions of ages, and by&nbsp;efforts , of that real genius which goes hand in hand with labour,&nbsp;brought to light many of the true features of the original. It&nbsp;is infinitely to be regretted that RitschPs results were never&nbsp;combined to form that monumental edition of Plautus of which&nbsp;he dreamed in his earlier life. RitschPs examination of the&nbsp;Plautine MSS. was both laborious and brilliant, and greatly&nbsp;extended the knowledge of Plautus and of the ancient Latin&nbsp;drama. Of this, two striking examples may be cited. By&nbsp;the aid of the Ambrosian palimpsest he recovered the name&nbsp;T. Maccius Plautus, for the vulgate M. Accius, and proved it&nbsp;correct by strong extraneous arguments. On the margin of&nbsp;the Palatine MSS. the marks C and DV continually recur,&nbsp;and had been variously explained. Ritschl proved that they&nbsp;meant “ Canticum ” and “ Diverbium,” and hence showed&nbsp;that in the Roman comedy only the conversations in iambic&nbsp;senarii were not intended for the singing voice. Thus was&nbsp;brought into strong relief a fact without which there can be no&nbsp;true appreciation of Plautus, viz. that his plays were comic&nbsp;operas rather than comic dramas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In conjectural criticism Ritschl was inferior not only to his great predecessors but to some of his contemporaries. His&nbsp;imagination was in this field (but in this field only) hampered&nbsp;by erudition, and his judgment was unconsciously warped by&nbsp;the desire to find in his text illustrations of his discoveries.&nbsp;But still a fair proportion of his textual labours has stood the&nbsp;test of time, and he rendered immense service by his study of&nbsp;Plautine metres, a field in which little advance had been made&nbsp;since the time of Bentley. In this matter Ritschl was aided&nbsp;hy an accomplishment rare (as he himself lamented) in Germany</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">the art of writing Latin verse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In spite of the incompleteness, on many sides, of his work Ritschl must be assigned a place in the history of learning&nbsp;among a very select few. His studies are presented principally&nbsp;in his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Opuscula</span><span class="font0"> collected partly before and partly since his&nbsp;death. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Trinummus</span><span class="font0"> (twice edited) was the only specimen&nbsp;of his contemplated edition of Plautus which he completed.&nbsp;The edition has been continued by some of his pupils—Goetz,&nbsp;Loewe and others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The facts of RitschPs life may be best learned from the elaborate biography by Otto Ribbeck (Leipzig, 1879). An interesting and</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">discriminating estimate of RitschPs work is that by Lucian Mueller (Berlin, 18777.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(J. S. R.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RITSON, JOSEPH (1752-1803), English antiquary, was born at Stockton-on-Tees, of a Westmorland yeoman family,&nbsp;on the 2nd of October 1752. He was educated for the law,&nbsp;and settled in London as a conveyancer when twenty-two.&nbsp;IIe devoted his spare time to literature, and in 1782 published&nbsp;an attack on Warton’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History of English Poetry.</span><span class="font0"> The fierce&nbsp;and insulting tone of his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Observations,</span><span class="font0"> in which Warton was&nbsp;treated as a showy pretender, and charged with cheating and&nbsp;lying to cover his ignorance, made a great sensation in literary&nbsp;circles. In nearly all the small points with which he dealt&nbsp;Ritson was in the right, and his corrections have since been&nbsp;adopted, but the unjustly hitter language of his criticisms roused&nbsp;great anger at the time, much, it would appear, to Ritson’s&nbsp;delight. In 1783 Johnson and Stccvcns were assailed in the&nbsp;same bitter fashion as Warton for their text of Shakespeare.&nbsp;Bishop Percy was next subjected to a furious onslaught in the&nbsp;preface to a collection of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ancient Songs</span><span class="font0"> (printed 1787, dated&nbsp;1790, published 1792). The only thing that can be said in&nbsp;extenuation of Ritson’s Unmatchable acrimony is that he&nbsp;spared no pains himself to ensure accuracy in the texts of&nbsp;old songs, ballads and metrical romances which he edited.&nbsp;His collection of the Robin Hood ballads is perhaps his greatest&nbsp;single achievement. Scott, who admired his industry and '&nbsp;accuracy in spite of his temper, was almost the only man who&nbsp;could get on with him. On one occasion, when he called in&nbsp;Scott’s absence, he spoke so rudely to Mrs Scott that Leyden,&nbsp;who was present, threatened to “ thraw his mcck ” and throw&nbsp;him out of the window. Spelling was one of his eccentricities,&nbsp;his own name being an example: Ritson is short pronunciation&nbsp;for Richardson. As early as 1796 Ritson showed signs of&nbsp;mental collapse, and on the 10th of September 1803 he became&nbsp;completely insane, barricaded himself in his chambers at&nbsp;Gray’s Inn, made a bonfire of manuscripts,, and was finally&nbsp;forcibly removed to Hoxton, where he died on the 23 rd of the&nbsp;month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RITTENHOUSE, DAVID (1732-1796), American astronomer, was börn at Germantown, Pennsylvania, on the 8th of April&nbsp;1732. First a watchmaker and mechanician he afterwards&nbsp;hecame treasurer of Pennsylvania (1777-89), and from 1792 to&nbsp;1795 director of the U.S. mint (Philadelphia). He was largely&nbsp;occupied in 1763 and in 1779-86 in settling the boundaries of&nbsp;several of the states. He was a fellow of the Royal Society of&nbsp;London, and a member of the American Philosophical Society;&nbsp;and was elected president of the Iatter society in 1791. As an&nbsp;astronomer, Rittenhouse’s principal merit is that he introduced&nbsp;in 1786 the use of spider lines in the focus of a transit instrument.&nbsp;His priority with regard to this useful invention was acknowledged by E. Troughton, who brought spider lines into universal&nbsp;use in astronomical instruments (see von Zach’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Monatliche&nbsp;Correspondenz,</span><span class="font0"> vol. ii. p. 215), but Felice Fontana (1730-</span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sup>i</sup>S<sup>q</sup>SL</span><span class="font0"> professor of physics at the university of Pisa, and&nbsp;afterwards director of the museum at Florence, had already&nbsp;anticipated the invention in 1775, though no doubt this fact was&nbsp;unknown to Rittenhouse. His researches were published in&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Transactions of the American Philosophical Society</span><span class="font0"> (1785-1799). He died at Philadelphia on the 26th of June 1796.</span></p>
