<p><span class="font1">in Cantemir’s opinion superior to Tokay. The excellence of the Moldavian horses is attested by a Turkish proverb ; and annual&nbsp;droves of as many as 40,000 Moldavian oxen were sent across&nbsp;Poland to Dantzic. Moldavia proper was divided into the upper&nbsp;country or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Terra de sus,</span><span class="font1"> and the lower country, or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Terra de josu.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">Bessarabia had been detached from the rest of the principality and</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">!</span><span class="font1">)laced under the direct control of the seraskier. It was divided into our provinces:—that of Budzak, inhabited by the Nogai Tatars;&nbsp;that of Akierman or Cetatea Alba, the Greek Monkastron, a strongly&nbsp;fortified place ; and those of Ismaila and Kilia. The voivodes&nbsp;owed their nomination entirely to the Porte, and the great officers&nbsp;of the realm were appointed at their discretion. These were the&nbsp;Great Logothete </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Marele Logofetu)</span><span class="font1"> or chancellor ; the governor of&nbsp;Lower Moldavia—</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vomieulu de t'erra de jοsu∙,</span><span class="font1"> the governor of&nbsp;Upper Moldavia—</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vomiculu de t'erra de sus</span><span class="font1"> ; the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hahnan</span><span class="font1"> or&nbsp;commander in chief ; the high chamberlain—</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Marele Postelnicu ;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">the great </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Spathar,</span><span class="font1"> or Swordbearer ; the great cupbearer—</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Marele&nbsp;PahamieU</span><span class="font1"> ; and the treasurer, or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vistiernieu,</span><span class="font1"> who together formed&nbsp;the prince’s council and were known as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Boiari, de Svαhι.</span><span class="font1"> Below&nbsp;these were a number of subordinate officers who acted as their&nbsp;assessors and were'known as boiars of the Divan </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Boiαri de Divanu).&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">The high court of justice was formed by the prince, metropolitan,&nbsp;and boiars : the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Boiari de Svahi</span><span class="font1"> decided on the verdict ; the metropolitan declared the law ; and the prince pronounced sentence. The&nbsp;boiars were able to try minor cases in their own residences, but&nbsp;subject to the right of appeal to the prince’s tribunal. Of the&nbsp;character of the Moldavian people Cantemir does not give a very&nbsp;favourable account. Their best points were their hospitality and,&nbsp;in Lower Moldavia, their valour. They cared little for letters and&nbsp;were generally indolent, and their prejudice against mercantile&nbsp;pursuits left the commerce of the country in the hands of&nbsp;Armenians, Jews, Greeks, and Turks. The pure-blood Rouman&nbsp;population, noble and plebeian, inhabited the cities and towns or&nbsp;larger villages ; the peasantry were mostly of Little Russian and&nbsp;Hungarian race and were in a servile condition. There was a&nbsp;considerable Gipsy population, almost every boiar having several&nbsp;Zingar families in his possession ; these were mostly smiths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ι- From this period onwards the character of the Ottoman domination in Moldavia is in every respect analogous to that of Walachia, e The office of voivode or hospodar was farmed out by the Porte to&nbsp;a succession of wealthy Greeks from the Fanar quarter of Constantinople. All formality of election by the boiars was now&nbsp;dispensed with, and the princes received their caftan of office at&nbsp;Constantinople, where they were consecrated by the Greek patriarch.&nbsp;The system favoured Turkish extortion in two ways : the presence&nbsp;of the voivode’s family connexions at Stamboul gave the Porte so&nbsp;many hostages for his obedience ; on the other hand the princes&nbsp;themselves could not rely on any support due to family influence&nbsp;in AIoldavia itself. They were thus mere puppets of the Divan,&nbsp;and could be deposed and shifted with the same facility as so many&nbsp;pashas—an object of Turkish policy, as each change was a pretext&nbsp;for a new levy of “ backshish. ” The chief families that shared&nbsp;the office during this period were those of Mavrocordato, Ghika,&nbsp;Callimachi, Ypsilanti, and AIurusi. Although from the very&nbsp;conditions of their creation they regarded the country as a field&nbsp;for exploitations, they were themselves often men of education&nbsp;and ability, and unquestionably made some praiseworthy attempts&nbsp;to promote the general culture and wellbeing of their subjects.&nbsp;In this respect, even the Fanariote regime was preferable to mere&nbsp;pasha rule, while it had the further consequence of preserving&nbsp;intact the national form of administration and the historic offices&nbsp;of AIoldavia. Gregory Ghika (1774-1777), who himself spoke&nbsp;French and Italian, founded a school or “ gymnasium ” at Jassy,&nbsp;where Greek, Latin, and theology were taught in a fashion. He&nbsp;encouraged the settlement of German protestant colonists in the&nbsp;country, some of whom set up as watchmakers in Jassy, where they&nbsp;were further allowed to build an evangelical church. Carra, a Swiss&nbsp;who had been tutor to Prince Ghika’s children, and who published&nbsp;in 1781 an account of the actual state of the principalities, speaks&nbsp;of some of the boiare as possessing a taste for French literature and&nbsp;even for the works of Voltaire, a tendency actively combated by&nbsp;the patriarch of Constantinople.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Tlio Russo-Turkish War, which ended in the peace of Kutshuk Kaimardji, was fatal to the integrity of AIoldavian territory. The&nbsp;house of Austria, which had already annexed Galicia in 1772, profited by the situation to arrange with both contending parties for&nbsp;the peaceful cession of the Bukovina to the Hapsburg monarchy.&nbsp;This richly-wooded AIoldavian province, containing Suciava, the&nbsp;earliest seat of the voivodes, and Cernautii or Czernovitz, was in&nbsp;1774 occupied by Hapsburg troops with Russian connivance, and&nbsp;in 1777 Baron Thugut procured its formal cession from the sultan.&nbsp;The Bukovina is still an Austrian province.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Vαlαehian and Moldavian History from the Treaty of Kutshuk Kaimardji in</span><span class="font1"> 1774 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">to the Establishment of the Roumanian Kingdom.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">—The treaty of Kutshuk Kaimardji was hardly concluded when&nbsp;it was violated by the Porte, which refused to recognize the right&nbsp;of the Walachian boiars to elect their voivode, and nominated</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Alexander Ypsilanti, a creature of its own. In 1777 Constantine AIurusi was made voivode of Aloldavia in the same high-handed&nbsp;fashion. The Divan seemed intent on restoring the old system of&nbsp;government in its entirety, but in 1783 the Russian representative&nbsp;extracted from the sultan a hattisherif defining more precisely the&nbsp;liberties of the principalities and fixing the amount of the annual&nbsp;tribute—for AValachia 619 purses exclusive of the bairam and other&nbsp;presents amounting to 130,000 piasters, and for AIoldavia 135 purses&nbsp;and further gifts to the extent of 115,000 piasters. By the peace of&nbsp;Jassy in 1792 the Dniester was recognized as the Russian frontier,&nbsp;and the privileges of the principalities as specified in the hattisherif&nbsp;confirmed. In defiance of treaties, however, the Porte continued&nbsp;to change the Iiospodars almost yearly and to exact extraordinary&nbsp;installation presents. The revolt of Pasvan Oglu in Bulgaria was&nbsp;the cause of great injury to AValachia. The rebels ravaged Little&nbsp;AValachia in 1801-2, and their ravages were succeeded by those of&nbsp;the Turkish troops, who now swarmed over the country. Exaction&nbsp;followed exaction, and in 1802 Russia resolved to assert her treaty&nbsp;rights in favour of the oppressed inhabitants of the principalities.&nbsp;On the accession of Constantine Ypsilanti the Porte was constrained&nbsp;to issue a new hattisherif by which every prince was to hold his&nbsp;office for at least seven years, unless the Porte satisfied the Russian&nbsp;minister that there were good and sufficient grounds for his deposition. All irregular contributions were to cease, and all citizens,&nbsp;with the exception of the boiars and clergy, were to pay their share&nbsp;of the tribute. The Turkish troops then employed in the principalities were to be paid off, and one year’s tribute remitted for the&nbsp;purpose. The boiars were to be responsible for the maintenance of&nbsp;schools, hospitals, and roads ; they and the prince together for the&nbsp;militia. The number of Turkish merchants resident in the country&nbsp;was limited. Finally, the Iiospodars were to be amenable to representations made to them by the Russian envoy at Constantinople,&nbsp;to whom was entrusted the task of watching over the AValachian&nbsp;and AIoldavian liberties. This, it will be seen, was a veiled Russian&nbsp;protectorate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In 1804 the Serbs under Karageorge rose against the Turkish dominion, and were secretly aided by the AValachian voivode&nbsp;Ypsilanti. The Porte, instigated by Napoleon’s ambassador&nbsp;Sebastiani, resolved on Ypsilanti’s deposition, but the hospodar&nbsp;succeeded in escaping to St Petersburg. In the war that now ensued&nbsp;between the Russians and the Turks, the former were for a time&nbsp;successful, and even demanded that the Russian territory should&nbsp;extend to the Danube. In 1808 the Russians, then in occupation&nbsp;of the principalities, formed a governing committee consisting of&nbsp;the metropolitan, another bishop, and four or five boiars under&nbsp;the presidency of General Kusnikoff. The seat of the president&nbsp;was at Jassy, and General Engelhart was appointed as vice-president&nbsp;at Bucharest. By the peace of Bucharest, however, in 1812, the&nbsp;principalities were restored to the sultan under the former conditions, with the exception of Bessarabia, which was ceded to the&nbsp;czar. The Pruth thus became the Russian boundary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The growing solidarity between the two Rouman principalities received a striking illustration in 1816, when the AValachian and&nbsp;AIoldavian hospodars published together a code applicable to both&nbsp;countries, and which had been elaborated by a joint commission.&nbsp;The Greek movement was now beginning, and in 1821 Alexander&nbsp;Ypsilanti entered Aloldavia at the head of the Hetærists, and prevailed on the hospodar AIichael Sutzu to aid him in invading the&nbsp;Ottoman dominions. To secure AValachian help, Ypsilanti advanced&nbsp;on Bucharest, but the prince, Theodore Vladimirescu, who represented the national Rouman reaction against the Fanariotes,&nbsp;repulsed his overtures with the remark “ that his business was not&nbsp;to march against the Turks, but to clear the country of Fanariotes. ”&nbsp;Vladimirescu was slain by a Greek revolutionary agent, but&nbsp;Ypsilanti’s legion was totally routed by the Turks at Dragashani,&nbsp;and the result of his enterprise was a Turkish occupation of the&nbsp;principalities. In 1822 the Turkish troops, who had committed&nbsp;great excesses, were withdrawn on the combined representations of&nbsp;Russia, Austria, and Great Britain. The country, however, was&nbsp;again ravaged by the retiring troops, quarters of Jassy and Bucharest&nbsp;burnt, and the complete evacuation delayed till 1824, when the&nbsp;British Government again remonstrated with the Porte. By the&nbsp;convention of Akierman between the Russians and the Turks in&nbsp;1826 the privileges of the principalities were once more confirmed,&nbsp;and they were again ratified in 1829, under Russian guarantee, by&nbsp;the peace of Adrianople. By this peace all the towns on the left bank&nbsp;of the Danube were restored to the principalities, and the Porte&nbsp;undertook to refrain from fortifying any position on the AValachian&nbsp;side of the river. The principalities were to enjoy commercial freedom, and the right of establishing a quarantine cordon along the&nbsp;Danube or elsewhere. The internal constitution of the countries was&nbsp;to be regulated by an “Organic Law,” which was drawn up by assemblies of bishops and boiars at Jassyand Bucharest, acting, however,&nbsp;under Russian control. The Organic Law thus elaborated was by no&nbsp;means of a liberal character, and amongst other abuses maintained&nbsp;the feudal privileges of the boiars. It was ratified by the Porte in&nbsp;1834, and the Russian army of occupation thereupon withdrew.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
