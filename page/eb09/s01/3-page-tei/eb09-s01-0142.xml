In the breeding- season, while performing the amatory flights in which like all Sandpipers he indulges, the male Dunlin utters a most peculiar and far-sounding whistle, quite impossible to syllable, and somewhat resembling the continued ringing of a high-toned but yet musical bell. Next to the Dunlin and Knot the commonest British <hi rend="italic">Tringinae</hi> are the Sanderding, <hi rend="italic">Calidris arenaria</hi> (to be distinguished from every other bird of the group by wanting a hind toe), the Purple Sandpiper, <hi rend="italic">T. striata</hi> or <hi rend="italic">maritima,</hi> the Curlew-Sandpiper, <hi rend="italic">T. subarquata,</hi> and the Little and Temminck’s Stints, <hi rend="italic">T. minuta</hi> and <hi rend="italic">T. temmincki,</hi> but want of space forbids more than the record of their names; and for the same reason no notice can here be taken of the many other species, chiefly American, @@<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> belonging to this group. Two other birds, however, must be mentioned. These are the Broad-billed Sandpiper, <hi rend="italic">T. platyrhyricha,</hi> of the Old World, which seems to be more Snipe-like than any that are usually kept in this section, and the marvellous Spoon-billed Sandpiper, <hi rend="italic">Eurinorhynchus pygmaeus,</hi> whose true home has still to be discovered, according to the experience of Baron Nordenskjöld in the memorable voyage of the “Vega.”	<hi rend="smallcaps">(a. n.)</hi></p><p>SANDROCOTTUS <hi rend="smallcaps">(Chandragupta),</hi> founder of the Maurya kingdom in India. See <hi rend="smallcaps">India,</hi> vol. xii. p. 787, and <hi rend="smallcaps">Persia,</hi> vol. xviii. p. 586.</p><p>SANDUSKY, a city of the United States, the capital of Erie county, Ohio, lies at the mouth of Sandusky river, 210 miles by rail north-east of Cincinnati, and is handsomely built of limestone from the subjacent strata on ground rising gradually from the shore of Lake Erie. The court-house and the high school are both of considerable architectural note. Besides being the centre of a great vine-growing district, Sandusky has the largest freshwater fish market in the United States, is the seat of the State fish-hatchery (which annually puts about 3,000,000 young whitefish into the lake), and has attained a reputation for the manufacture of such wooden articles as handles, spokes, “bent work” for carriages, carpenters’ tools, &amp;c. The city is coextensive with Portland township. Its population was 13,000 in 1870 and 15,838 in 1880.</p><p>SANDWICH, an English borough, market-town, and Cinque Port, is situated in the east of Kent, opposite the Downs, on a branch of the South-Eastern Railway, and on the Stour, 2 miles from the sea, 12 miles east of Canterbury, and 4 north-west of Deal. The streets are narrow and the houses irregularly built. The old line of the walls on the land side is marked by a public walk. The Fishers’ Cate and a gateway called the Barbican are interesting; but the four principal gates were pulled down in the last century. St Clement’s church has a fine Norman central tower, and St Peter’s, said to date from the reign of King John, has interesting mediaeval monuments. The grammar school founded by Sir Roger Manwood in 1564 is now in abeyance. There are three ancient hospitals; St Bartholomew’s has a fine Early English chapel of the 12th</p><p>century. Until the beginning of the 16th century Sandwich was of considerable importance as a port, but after the filling up of the harbour with sand about the beginning of the 16th century it fell into decay. The principal industries of the town are market-gardening, tanning, wool-sorting, and brewing. Coal, timber, and iron are imported. Sandwich returned two members to parliament till 1880, and was merged in the St Augustine’s division of the county in 1885. The parliamentary borough, which included Deal and Walmer (area 2684 acres), had in 1881 a population of 15,655, while that of the municipal borough (area 706 acres) was 2846.</p><p>In the Norman survey Sandwich is described as a borough. It rose into importance on the decline of the <hi rend="italic">Portus Rutupensis,</hi> its name denoting the situation on the sands. The Danes frequently attacked it in the 10th and 11th centuries; and it was repeatedly plundered by the French in the 15th century. It was fortified by Edward VI. Sandwich was incorporated by Edward the Confessor, and received its last charter from Charles II.</p><p>SANDWICH, <hi rend="smallcaps">Edward Montagu, Earl of</hi> (1625— 1672), general and admiral, was the son of Sir Sidney Montagu, youngest brother of Edward Lord Montagu of Boughton, and was born 27th July 1625. In August 1643 he raised a regiment in the service of the Parliament, with which he specially distinguished himself at Marston Moor, Naseby, and the siege of Bristol. He was a member of the “Little Parliament” (1653), and one of the committee for regulating the customs. In November he was elected to the council of state. In the first Protectorate parliament he sat for Huntingdonshire. In January 1656 he succeeded Penn as admiral, and he was associated with Blake in his expedition to the Mediterranean in the same year. After the treaty with France against Spain in 1657 he held command of the fleet sent to prevent the relief of the three coast towns—Gravelines, Mardike, and Dunkirk—besieged by the French, and was successful in defeating an attempt by a great Spanish force to retake Mardike. After the death of Cromwell he was sent with a fleet to the North Sea to enter into negotiations with the Northern powers, but, communications having been opened with him on behalf of Charles II., he returned to England only to find that the conspiracy of Sir George Booth had miscarried, whereupon, after a lame explanation, he was dismissed from his command. At the Restoration, having commanded the fleet which conveyed the king to England, he was made Knight of the Garter, and soon afterwards elevated to the peerage as Baron Montagu of St Neots, Viscount Hinchinbroke, and Earl of Sandwich. During the war with the Dutch in 1664-65 he commanded the Blue squadron under the duke of York, and specially distinguished himself in the great battle of 3d June 1665. After his return to England he was sent to negotiate a peace between Spain and Portugal, and also a treaty of commerce with Spain. On a renewal of the war in 1672 he again commanded the Blue squadron under the duke of York, and during the fight in Southwold Bay, on the 28th May, his ship, the Royal James, was set on fire by the Dutch, when he leaped overboard and was drowned. His body was found a fortnight afterwards, and was interred in Henry VII.’s Chapel, Westminster Abbey.</p><p>Lord Sandwich’s translation of a Spanish work on the <hi rend="italic">Art of Metals</hi> by Alvaro Alonso Barba (1640) appeared in 1674. Several of his letters during the Spanish negotiations have been published in Arlington’s <hi rend="italic">Letters,</hi> and various letters to him by Cromwell will be found in Carlyle’s <hi rend="italic">Cromwell.</hi> See also <hi rend="italic">Original Letters and Negotiations of Sir Richard Fanshawe, the Earl of Sandwich, the Earl of Sunderland, and Sir William Godolphin, wherein Diverse Matters between the Three Crowns of England, Spain, and Portugal from 1603 to 1678 are set in a clear light.</hi></p><p>SANDWICH, <hi rend="smallcaps">John Montagu, Fourth Earl of </hi>(1718-1792), was born 3d November 1718, and succeeded</p><p><hi rend="superscript">@@@1</hi> A “Monograph of the <hi rend="italic">Tringeæ</hi> of North America” by Prof. Coues was published in the <hi rend="italic">Proceedings</hi> of the Philadelphia Academy for 1861 (pp. 190-205), but is of course new out of date. Schlegel’s list of " <hi rend="italic">Scolopaces</hi> ” in the <hi rend="italic">Muséum des Pays-Bas</hi> is the best general description we have, but that is only a few years later (1864), and requires much modification to be put on a level with the knowledge of the present day.
