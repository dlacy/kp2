The site of the ancient Marathesium is close by on the S. It is connected with the railway station of Ayassoluk by a diligence service. Before the opening of the Smyrna-Aidin railway its roadstead was frequented by vessels trading with the Anatolian coast, and it has often been proposed to connect it with the railway system by a branch line, and thus enable it to compete with Smyrna. In the absence of this the town is rapidly on the decline. The population is not over 7000. The trade is of merely local interest. (D. G. H.)</p></div></body></text></TEI>
