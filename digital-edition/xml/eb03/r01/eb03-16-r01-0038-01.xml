, the return or progreffive motion of a moving body, occaſioned by ſome obſtacle which hindered it from purſuing its former direction.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Circular Infirument of</hi> <hi rend="italic"><hi rend="smallcaps"> Rerlpction,</hi></hi> an inſtrument for meaſuring angles to a very great degree of accuracy. It was invented by the celebrated aſtronomer Mr To-bias Mayer of Gottingen, principally with a view to do away the errors of the diviſions of the limb ; and has fince been much improved by the Chevalier de Borda, and M J. H. de Magellan. This inſtrument is particularly applicable to the meaſuring of the diſtances of the heavenly bodies, and was ufed by the French in their part of the operation for determining the difference of meridians of Paris and Greenwich. For the deſcription, rectification, and uſe of this inſtrument, ſee the article Navigation, and <hi rend="italic">Mackay on the Longitude,</hi> vυl. i. p. 44.</p><p><hi rend="italic">REELECTION of the Rays of Light,</hi> in catoptrics, is their return, after approaching fo near the ſurface of bodies as to be thereby repelled or driven backwards.
