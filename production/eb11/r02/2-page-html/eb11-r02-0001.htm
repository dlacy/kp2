The ten who were executed at Charing Cross or Tyburn, London, in October 1660, were Thomas Harrison, John Jones, Adrian Scrope, John Carew, Thomas&nbsp;Scot, and Gregory Clement, who had signed the death-warrant;&nbsp;the preacher Hugh Peters; Francis Hacker and Daniel Axtel, who&nbsp;commanded the soldiers at the trial and the execution of the king;&nbsp;and John Cook, the solicitor who directed the prosecution. In&nbsp;January 1661 the bodies of Cromwell, lreton, ana Bradshaw were&nbsp;exhumed and hanged at Tyburn, but Pride’s does not appear to&nbsp;have been treated in this way. Of the nineteen or twenty regicides&nbsp;who had escaped and were living abroad, three, Sir John Barkstead,&nbsp;John Okey and Miles Corbet, were arrested in Holland and executed&nbsp;in London in April 1662; and one, John Lisle, was murdered at&nbsp;Lausanne. The last survivor of the regicides was probably Edmund&nbsp;Ludlow, who died at Vevey in 1692.</span></p>

During the battle, so runs the&nbsp;story, the dictator Postumius vowed a temple to Castor and&nbsp;Pollux, who were specially venerated in Tusculum, the chief&nbsp;city of the Latins (it being a Roman usage to invoke the aid of&nbsp;the gods of the enemy), who appeared during the battle, and&nbsp;b</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span class="font1">ought the news of the victo</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span class="font1">y to Rome, watering thei</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span class="font1"> ho</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span class="font1">ses&nbsp;at the sp</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span class="font1">ing of Juturna, close to which their temple in the&nbsp;Forum was erected.

<p><span class="font1">REGIMENT (from Late Latin </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">regimenlum,</span><span class="font1"> rule, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">regere,</span><span class="font1"> to rule, govern, direct), originally government, command or authority&nbsp;exercised over others, or the office of a ruler or sovereign; in this&nbsp;sense the word was common in the 16th century. The most&nbsp;familiar instance is the title of the tract of John Knox, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">First&nbsp;Blast of the Trumpet against the Monstrous Regiment of Women.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">The term as applied to a large body of troops dates from the&nbsp;French army of the 16th century. In the first instance it&nbsp;implied “ command,” as nowadays we speak of “ General A’s&nbsp;command,” meaning the whole number of troops under his&nbsp;command. The early regiments had no similarity in strength&nbsp;or organization, except that each was under one commander.&nbsp;With the regularization of armies the commands of all such&nbsp;superior officers were gradually reduced to uniformity, and a&nbsp;regiment came to be definitely a colonel’s command. In the&nbsp;British infantry the term has no tactical significance, as the&nbsp;number of battalions in a regiment is variable, and one at least&nbsp;is theoretically abroad at all times, while the reserve or territorial battalions serve under a different code to that governing&nbsp;the regular battalions. The whole corps of Royal Artillery&nbsp;is called “ the Royal Regiment of Artillery.” In the cavalry&nbsp;a regiment is tactically as well as administratively a unit of four&nbsp;squadrons. On the continent of Europe the regiment of infantry&nbsp;is always together under the command of its colonel, and consists&nbsp;of three or four battalions under majors or lieutenant-colonels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">REGINA, the capital city of the province of Saskatchewan, Canada, situated at 104° 36' W. and 50° 27' N., and 357 m. W.&nbsp;of Winnipeg. Pop. (1907) 9804. After the Canadian Pacific&nbsp;railway was completed in 1885, the necessity for a place of&nbsp;government on the railway line pressed itself upon the Dominion&nbsp;government. The North-West Territories were but little&nbsp;settled then, but a central position on the prairies was necessary,&nbsp;where the mounted police might be stationed and where the&nbsp;numerous Indian bands might be easily reached. The minister&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font1">the interior at Ottawa, afterwards Governor Dewdney, chose&nbsp;this spot, and for a number of years Regina was the seat of the&nbsp;Territorial government. The governor took up his abode on the&nbsp;adjoining plain, and the North-West Council met each year,&nbsp;with a show of constitutional government about it. On the&nbsp;formation of the province of Saskatchewan in 1905 the choice&nbsp;of capital was left to the first legislature of the province. Prince&nbsp;Albert, Moose Jaw and Saskatoon all advanced claims, but&nbsp;Regina was decided on as the capital. It probably doubled&nbsp;in population between 1905 and 1907. Its public buildings,&nbsp;churches and residences are worthy of a place of greater pretensions. It is the centre for a rich agricultural district, and&nbsp;for legislation, education, law and other public benefits. It&nbsp;remains the headquarters of the mounted police for the western&nbsp;provinces, and near it is an Indian industrial school of some&nbsp;note.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">REGINON, or Regino of Prüm, medieval chronicler, was born at Altripp near Spires, and was educated in the monastery&nbsp;of Prüm. Here he became a monk, and in 892, just after the&nbsp;monastery had been sacked by the Danes, he was chosen abbot.&nbsp;In 899, however, he was deprived of this position and he went&nbsp;to Trier, where he was appointed abbot of St Martin’s, a house&nbsp;which he reformed. He died in 915, and was buried in the abbey&nbsp;of St Maximin at Trier, his tomb being discovered there in 1581.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Reginon wrote a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chronicon,</span><span class="font0"> dedicated to Adalberon, bishop of Augsburg (d. 909), which deals with the history of the world from&nbsp;the commencement of the Christian era to 906, especially the&nbsp;history of affairs in Lorraine and the neighbourhood. The first book&nbsp;(to 741) consists mainly of extracts from Bede, Paulps Diaconus and&nbsp;other writers; of the second book (741-906) the latter part is&nbsp;original and valuable, although the chronology is at fault and the&nbsp;author relied chiefly upon tradition and hearsay for his information. The work was continued to 967 by a monk of Trier, possibly&nbsp;Adalbert, archbishop of Magdeburg (d. 981). The chronicle was&nbsp;first published at Mainz in 1521; another edition is in Band I.&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Monumental</span><span class="font0"> </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Germaniae historica.

In this they were much hindered by&nbsp;the lack of correct translations of Ptolemy’s works; and in&nbsp;1462 Regiomontanus accompanied Cardinal Bessarion to Italy&nbsp;in search of authentic manuscripts.
