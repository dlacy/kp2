It is the handſomeſt town of Sileſia, next to Breſlaw. The ſtreets are large, the church fine, and the houſes well built. The fortifications are not very conſiderable, and the royal palace is turned into a convent. All the magiſtrates are Roman Catholics; but moſt of the inhabitants are Proteſtants, who have a church without the town, as alſo a public ſchool and bells. It is ſeated on an eminence on the river Weiſtritz, 27 miles ſouth-eaſt of Lignitz, and 22 ſouth- weſt of Breſlaw. E. Long. 16. 48. N. Lat. 50. 46.</p><p>SCHWEINFURT, a very ſtrong, free, and imperial town of Germany, in Franconia, with a magnificent palace, where the ſenators meet, who are 12 in number. The environs are rich in cattle, corn, and wine; the inhabitants are Proteſtants, and not very rich. However, they carry on a large trade in woollen and linen cloth, gooſe-quills, and feathers. It is ſeated on the river Main, 27 miles north-eaſt of Wirtz- burg, and 22 well of Bamberg. E. Long. 10. 25. N. Lat. 50. 4.</p><p>SCHWENKFELDIA, in botany: A genus of the monogynia order, belonging to the pentandria claſs of plants; and in the natural method ranking with thoſe that are doubtful. The calyx is quinquefid; the corolla funnel-ſhaped; the ſtigma parted into five; the berry quinquelocular, with a number of feeds. Of this there are three ſpecies, viz. 1. Cinerea; 2, Aſpera; 3. Hiria. The two firſt are natives of Guiana, the other of Jamaica. The leaves of all of them are remarkably rough, and ſtick to the fingers or clothes.</p><p>SCHWENKIA, in botany; a genus of the monogynia order, belonging to the diandria claſs of plants. The corolla is almoſt equal, plaited at the throat, and glandulous; there are three barren ſtamina; the capſule bilocular and polyſpermous.</p><p>SCHWINBURG, a town of Denmark, on the eaſtern coaſt of the island of Fionia, over-againſt the islands of Arroa and Langeland. E. Long. 10. 55. N. Lat. 55. 8.</p><p>SCFIWITZ,. or <hi rend="smallcaps">Switz,</hi> a canton of Swisserland, which gives name to them all. It is bounded on the weſt by the lake of the four cantons, on the ſouth by the canton of Uri, on the eaſt by that of Glaris, and on the north by thoſe of Zurich and Zug. Its principal riches conſiſt in cattle, and the capital town is of the  ſame name. This is a large, handſome place, ſeated near the lake of the four cantons, in a pleaſant country among the mountains. E. Long. 8. 41. N. Lat. 47. 2.</p><p>SCIACCA, anciently called <hi rend="italic">Thermes Selinuntiae,</hi> in Sicily, derives its preſent denomination from the Arabic word <hi rend="italic">Scheich.</hi> It is a very ancient place, being mentioned in the account of the wars between the Greeks and Carthaginians, to the latter of whom it belonged. It is defended by ancient walls and the caſtle of Luna. It ſtands upon a very ſteep rock, hanging over the ſea, and excavated in every direction  into prodigious magazines, where the corn of the neighbouring territory is depoſited for exportation; there is no harbour, but a ſmall bay formed by a wooden pier, where lighters lie to load the corn which they carry out about a mile to ſhips to anchor.</p><p>The town is irregularly but ſubſtantially built, and contains 13,000 inhabitants, though Amico's Lexicon<hi rend="italic">. Topographicum</hi> ſays the laſt enumeration found only 9484. His accounts do not take in eccleſiaſtics, and ſeveral denominations of lay perſons.</p><p>SCIÆNA, in ichthyology, a genus belonging to the order of thoracici. The membrane of the gills has ſix rays; the opercula and whole head are ſcaly. There are five ſpecies.</p><p>SCIATICA, the <hi rend="smallcaps">hip-gout.</hi> See <hi rend="smallcaps">Medicine; n⁰</hi> 207.</p><p>SCIENCE, in philoſophy, denotes any doctrines deduced from ſelf-evident principles.</p><p>Sciences may be properly divided as follows, 1. The knowledge of things, their conſtitutions, properties, and operations: this, in a little more enlarged ſenſe of the word, maybe called φυσιχη, or <hi rend="italic">natural philoſophy; </hi>the end of which is ſpeculative truth. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Philosophy</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Physics.</hi>—2. The ſkill of rightly applying theſe powers, πϱαχτιη: The moſt conſiderable under this head is ethics, which is the ſeeking out thoſe rules and meaſures of human actions that lead to happiness, and the means to practiſe them (ſee <hi rend="smallcaps">Moral Philosophy)</hi>; and the next is mechanics, or the application of the powers of natural agents to the uſes of life (ſee <hi rend="smallcaps">Mechanics).</hi>—3. The doctrine of ſigns, ϲημειωτιχη; the moſt uſual of which being words, it is</p><p>aptly enough termed <hi rend="italic">logic.</hi> See <hi rend="smallcaps">Logic.</hi></p><p>This, ſays Mr Locke, ſeems to be the moſt general, as well as natural, diviſion of the objects of our underſtanding. For a man can employ his thoughts about nothing but either the contemplation of things themſelves for the diſcovery of truth; or about the things in his own power, which are his actions, for the attainment of his own ends; or the ſigns the mind makes uſe of both in the one and the other, and the right ordering of them for its clearer information, All which three, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> things as they are in themſelves know able, actions as they depend on us in order to happineſs, and the right uſe of ſigns in order to knowledge, being <hi rend="italic">toto caelo</hi> different, they ſeem to be the three great provinces of the intellectual world, wholly ſeparate and diſtinct one from another.</p><p>SCILLA, the <hi rend="smallcaps">squill,</hi> in botany: A genus of the monogynia order, belonging to the hexandria claſs of plants; and in the natural method ranking under the 10th order, <hi rend="italic">Coronaria.</hi> The corolla is hexapetalous and deciduous; the filaments filiform.</p><p>The moſt remarkable ſpecies is the maritima, or ſea- onion, whoſe roots are uſed in medicine. Of this there are two forts, one with a red, and the other with a white root; which are suppoſed to be accidental varieties, but the white are generally preferred for medicinal uſe. The roots are large, ſomewſhat oval-ſhaped, compoſed of many coats dying over each other like onions; and at the bottom come out ſeveral fibres. From the middle of the root ariſe ſeveral ſhining leaves, which continue green all the winter, and decay in the ſpring. Then the flower-ſtalk comes out, which riſes two feet high, and is naked half-way, terminating in a pyramidal thyrſe of flowers, which are white, compoſed of ſix petals, which ſpread open like the points of a ſtar. This grows naturally on the ſea-ſhores, and in the ditches, where the ſalt-water naturally flows with the tide, in moſt of the warm parts of Europe, ſo cannot be propagated in gardens; the froſt in winter al-</p></body></text></TEI>
