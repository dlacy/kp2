 in botany ; a genus of plants belonging to the class of <hi rend="italic">cryptogamia</hi> and order of <hi rend="italic">musci.</hi> The antheræ are globoſe ; the mouth entire and cloſed by an operculum ; the calyptra is wanting. There are three ſpecies, the paluſtre, alpinum, and arboreum, i. The sa <hi rend="italic">luſtre,</hi> common bog-moſs, grows on our bogs in wide patches, ſo as frequently to cover a large portion of their ſurface. The ſtalks are from two inches to two feet long, irregularly ſurrounded with numerous, conical, pendant branches, and terminated with a rosaceous cluſter of erect ſhort ones. It is generally believed, that the roots and decayed ſtalks of this mois conſtitute a principal part of that uſeful bituminous ſubſtance called p <hi rend="italic">eat,</hi> which is the chief fuel of the northern regions. —The L'apland matrons are well acquainted with this moſs. They dry and lay it in their cradle, to ſupply the place of bed, bolſter, and every covering ; and, being changed night and morning, it keeps the infant remarkably clean, dry, and warm. It is sufficiently soft of itſelf ; but the tender mother, not ſatisfied with this, frequently covers the moss with the downy hairs of the reindeer ; and by that means makes a moſt delicate neſt for the young babe. 2. The <hi rend="italic">alpinurn,</hi> green bog-moss. Its branches are ſubulate and erect; the antheræ are oval. It grows in mountain bogs in South Britain. 3 The <hi rend="italic">arboreum,</hi> creeping bog- moſs, is branched ; the antheræ are numerous, seſſile, hairy, and grow along the branches chiefly on one side. It is found on the trunks of trees.</p><p>Os SPHENOIDES, the ſeventh bone of the cranium or ſkull. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Anatomy,</hi> n⁰ 11.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
