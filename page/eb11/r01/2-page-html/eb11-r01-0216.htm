<p><span class="font1">The above discussion of spherical mirrors assumes that the mirror has such a small aperture that the reflected rays from any&nbsp;point unite in a point. This, however, no longer holds when the&nbsp;mirror has a wide aperture, and in general the reflected rays envelop&nbsp;a caustic </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.υ.,</span><span class="font1"> see also Aberration). The only mirror which can&nbsp;sharply reproduce an object-point as an image-point has for its&nbsp;section an ellipse, which is so placed that the object and image are&nbsp;at its foci. This follows from a property of the curve, viz. the sum&nbsp;of the focal distances is constant, and that the focal vectores are&nbsp;equally inclined to the normal </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">at</span><span class="font1"> the point. More important than&nbsp;the elliptical mirror, however, is the parabolic, which has the property of converting rays parallel to the axis into a </span></p>
<p><span class="font0">p</span><span class="font1">encil through its  focus; or, inversely, rays from a source placed at the focus are converted into a parallel beam; hence the use of this mirror in search-lights and similar devices.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">REFORMATION, THE. The Reformation, as commonly understood, means the religious and political revolution of the&nbsp;16th century, of which the immediate result was the partial disruption of the Western Catholic Church and the establishment&nbsp;of various national and territorial churches. These agreed&nbsp;in repudiating certain of the doctrines, rites and practices&nbsp;of the medieval Church, especially the sacrifice of the Mass&nbsp;and the headship of the bishop of Rome, and, whatever their&nbsp;officiaI designations, came generally to be known as “ Protestant.” In some cases they introduced new systems of&nbsp;ecclesiastical organization, and in all they sought to justify&nbsp;their innovations by an appeal from the Church’s tradition&nbsp;to the Scriptures. The conflicts between Catholics and Protestants speedily merged into the chronic political rivalries,&nbsp;domestic and foreign, which distracted the European states;&nbsp;and religious considerations played a very important part in&nbsp;diplomacy and war for at least a century and a half, from the&nbsp;diet of Augsburg in 1530 to the English revolution and the&nbsp;league of Augsburg, 1688-89. The terms “ Reformation ’’&nbsp;and “ Protestantism ” are inherited by the modern historian;&nbsp;they are not of his devising, and come to him laden with re-miniscences of all the exalted enthusiasms and bitter anti-pathies engendered by a period of fervid religious dissension.&nbsp;The unmeasured invective of Luther and Aleander has not&nbsp;ceased to re-echo, and the old issues are by no means dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The heat of controversy is, however, abating, and during the past thirty or forty years both Catholic and Protestant</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">investigators have been vying with one another in adding to our knowledge and in rectifying old mistakes; while an ever-increasing number of writers&nbsp;pledged to neither party are aiding in developing an&nbsp;idea of the scope and nature of the Reformation which&nbsp;differs radically from the traditional one. We now&nbsp;appreciate too thoroughly the intricacy of the medieval Church;&nbsp;its vast range of activity, secular as well as religious; the&nbsp;inextricable interweaving of the civil and ecclesiastical govem-ments; the slow and painful process of their divorce as the old&nbsp;ideas of the proper functions of the two institutions have changed&nbsp;in both Protestant and Catholic lands: we perceive all too&nbsp;clearly the limitations of the reformers, their distrust of reason&nbsp;and criticism—in short, we know too much about medieval&nbsp;institutions and the process of their disintegration longer to&nbsp;see in the Reformation an abrupt break in the general history&nbsp;of Europe. No one will, of course, question the importance&nbsp;of the schism which created the distinction between Protestants&nbsp;and Catholics, but it must always be remembered that the&nbsp;religious questions at issue comprised a relatively small part&nbsp;of the whole compass of human aspirations and conduct, even&nbsp;to those to whom religion was especially vital, while a large&nbsp;majority of the leaders in literature, art, science and public&nbsp;affairs went their way seemingly almost wholly unaffected by&nbsp;theological problems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">That the religious elements in the Reformation have been greatly overestimated from a modern point of view can hardly&nbsp;be questioned, and one of the most distinguished students&nbsp;of Church history has ventured the assertion that “ The motives,&nbsp;both remote and proximate, which led to the Lutheran revolt&nbsp;were largely secular rather than spiritual.” “ We may,”&nbsp;continues Mr H. C. Lea, “ dismiss the religious changes incident&nbsp;to the Reformation with the remark that they were not the&nbsp;object sought, but the means for attaining the object. The&nbsp;existing ecclesiastical system was the practical evolution of&nbsp;dogma, and the overthrow of dogma was the only way to obtain&nbsp;permanent relief from the intolerable abuses of that system ”&nbsp;(</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Cambridge Modern History</span><span class="font2">, i. 653). It would perhaps be nearer&nbsp;the truth to say that the secular and spiritual interests inter-minglçd and so permeated one another that it is almost impossible to distinguish them clearly even in thought, while in&nbsp;practice they were so bewilderingly confused that they were&nbsp;never separated, and were constantly mistaken for one another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The first step in clarifying the situation is to come to a full realization that the medieval Church was essentially an international </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">state,</span><span class="font2"> and that the character of the Protestant&nbsp;secession from it was largely determined by this fact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As Maitland suggests: “ We could frame no acceptable definition of a State which would not comprehend the Church. What has it not that a State should have ? It has laws, law givers, law courts,&nbsp;lawyers. It uses physical force to compel men to obey&nbsp;the laws. It keeps prisons. In the 13th century, though with&nbsp;squeamish phrases, it pronounced sentence of death. It is&nbsp;no voluntary society; if people are not born into it&nbsp;they are baptized into it when they cannot help them-seIves. If they attempt to leave they are guilty of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">crimen&nbsp;laesae majestatis</span><span class="font2">, and are likely to be burned. It is supported&nbsp;by involutary contributions, by tithe and tax ” (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Canon Law&nbsp;in the Church of England</span><span class="font2">, p. 100). The Church was not only&nbsp;organized like a modem bureaucracy, but performed many of&nbsp;the functions of a modern State. It dominated the intellectual&nbsp;and profoundly affected the social interests of western Europe.&nbsp;Its economic influence was multiform and incalculable, owing&nbsp;to its vast property, its system of taxation and its encouragement of monasticism. When Luther made his first great&nbsp;appeal to the German people in his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Address to the German&nbsp;Nobility</span><span class="font2">, he scarcely adverts to religious matters at all. He&nbsp;deals, on the contrary, almost exclusively with the social,&nbsp;financial, educational, industrial and general moral problems&nbsp;of the day. If Luther, who above all others had the religious&nbsp;issue ever before him, attacks the Church as a source of worldly&nbsp;disorder, it is not surprising that his contemporary Ulrich von&nbsp;Hutten should take a purely secular view of the issues involved.&nbsp;Moreover, in the fascinating collection of popular satires and&nbsp;ephemeral pamphlets made by Schade, one is constantly im-pressed with the absence of religious fervour, and the highly&nbsp;secular nature of the matters discussed. The same may be said&nbsp;of the various </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Gravamina,</span><span class="font2"> or lists of grievances against the&nbsp;papacy drafted from time to time by German diets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But not only is the character of the Reformation differently conceived from what it once was; our notions of the process&nbsp;of change are being greatly altered. Formerly,&nbsp;writers accounted for the Lutheran movement by so&nbsp;magnifying the horrors of the pre-existing regime&nbsp;that it appeared intolerable, and its abolition consequently inevitable. Protestant writers once contented themselves with a brief caricature of the Church,</span></p>
