Some of theſe worms have been divided into two, others into three or four pieces ; and ſome oſ theſe pieces, after having paſ-ied two or three months without any appearance of life or motion, have then begun to reproduce a head or tail or both. The reproduction of the anus, alter ſuch a flate of reſt, is no long work ; a few days do it : but it is otherwiſe with the head, that does not ſeem to per-form its functions in the divided pieces till about ſeven months after the ſeparation. ' It is to be obſerved, that in all theſe operations both on earth and water-worms, the hinder part ſuffers greatly more than the fore part in the cutting ; for it always twills itſelf about a long time, as iſ actuated by ſtrong convulſions ; whereas the head uſually crawls away without the appearance of any great uneaſineſs.</p><p>The reproduction of ſeveral parts of lobſters, crabs, &amp;c. makes alſo one of the great curioſities in natural hiſtory. That, in lieu of an organical part of an animal broken off, another ſhall rife perfectly like it, may ſeem inconſiſtent with the modern ſyſtem of generation, where the animal is ſuppoſed to be wholly formed in the egg. Yet has the matter of fact been well atteſted by the fiſhermen, and even by ſeveral virtuoſos who have taken the point into examination, particularly M. de Reaumur and M. Perrault, whoſe ſkill and exactneſs in things of this nature will hardly be queſtioned. The legs of lobſters, &amp;c. conſiſt each of five articulations : now, when any of the legs happen to break by any accident, as in walking, &amp;c. which frequently happens, the fracture is always found to be in a part near the fourth articulation ; and what they thus loſe is preciſe-ly reproduced ſome time afterwards ; that is, a part of a leg ſhoots out, confiſting of four articulations, the firſt whereof has two claws as before ; ſo that the loſs is entirely repaired.</p><p>If a lobſter’s leg be broken off by defign at the fourth or fifth articulation, what is thus broken off always comes again ; but it is not ſo if the fracture be made in the fiiſt, ſecond, or third articulation. In thoſe cafes, the reproduction is very rare if things continue as they are. But what is exceedingly ſurpriſing is, that they do not ; for, upon vifiting the lobſter maimed in theſe barren and unhappy articulations, at the end of two or three days, all the other articulations are found broken off to the fourth ; and it is ſuſpected they have performed the operation on themſelves, to make the réproduction of a leg certain.</p><p>The part reproduced is not only perfectly like that retrenched, but alſo, in a certain fpace of time, grows equal to it. Hence it is that we frequently ſee lobſters, which have their two big legs unequal, and that in all proportions. This ſhows the ſmaller leg to be a new one.</p><p>A part thus reproduced being broken, there is a ſe-cond reproduction. The ſummer, which is the only fεafon of the year when the lobſters eat, is the moſt favourable time for the reproduction. It is then performed in four or five weeks; whereas it takes up eight or nine months in any other ſeaſon. The ſmall legs are ſometimes reproduced, but more rarely, as well as more ſlowly, than the great ones : the horns do the ſame. The experiment is moſt eafily tried on the common crab.

Ογ reptiles are a genus of animals and infects, which, inſtead of feet, reſt on one part of the body, while they advance forward with the reſt. Such aie earthworms, ſnakes, caterpillars, &amp;c. Indeed, moſt of the claſs of reptiles have feet ; only thoſe very ſmall, and the legs remarkably ſhort in , proportion to the bulk of the body.</p><p>Natuiahſts obierve a world of artful contrivance for the motion of reptiles. Thus, particularly in the earth, woιm, Dr W ιllιs tells us, the whole body is only a chain of annular muſcles ; or, as Dr Derham ſays, it is only one continued ſpiral muſcle, the orbicular fibres where-ot being contracted, render each ring narrower and longer than before ; by which means it is enabled, like the worm of an augre, to bore its paffage into the earth. Its reptile motion might alſo be explained by a wire wound on a cylinder, which when Hipped off, and one end extended and held faſt, will bring the other near to it. So the earthworm having ſhot out or extended his body (which is with a wreathing), it takes hold by thele ſmall feet it hath, and ſo con-tιaCtS the hinder part of its body. Dr Tyſon adds, that when the forepart of the body is itretched out, and applied to a plane at a diſtance, the hind part relaxing and ſhortening is eafily drawn towards it as a centre.</p><p>Its feet are difpofed in a quadruple row the whole length of the worm, with which, as with ſo many hooks, it ſaſtens down fometimes this and ſometimes that part of the body to the plane, and at the ſame time ſtretch-es out or drags after it another.</p><p>The creeping of ſerpents is effected after a fomewhat different manner ; there being a difference in their ſtructure, in that theſe laſt have a campages of bones •articulated together.</p><p>I he body here is not drawn together, but as it were complicated ; part of it being applied on the rough ground, and the reſt ejaculated and ſhot from it, which being.ſet on the ground in its turn, brings the other after it. I he ſpine of the back variouſly wreathed has the. ſame effect in leaping, as the joints in the feet of other animals they make their leaps by means of muſcles, and extend the plicae or folds.
