<p><span class="font2">ſpectes, that we can recollect, a greater, than to that which is ſeen </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">in a </span><span class="font2">perfon who pretends to mimicry&nbsp;and courtly geſture, without poffeffing the advantages&nbsp;and talents they require ; and of which not many&nbsp;people, comparatively fpeaking, have any remarkable&nbsp;ſſiare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The inference of this is too obvious to need drawing out, aud we would particularly recommend it to tlie&nbsp;conſideration of thofe readers who think the common&nbsp;occuπ∙mces of a newſpaper, &amp;c. cannot be properly&nbsp;delivered without a good deal of elbow-room</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Although it is impoſſible to come to particulars in any directions of this kind, yet there is one article of&nbsp;our preſent ſnbject on which a ſerviceable remark may&nbsp;be made. Iu ordinary difcourſe, when we are parti-cularly preſſing and earneſt in what we ſay, the eye is&nbsp;naturally thrown upon thoſe to whom we addreſs our-ſelves : And in reading, a turn of this organ now and&nbsp;then upon the hearers, when any thing-very remark-able or intereſting falls in the way, has a good effect&nbsp;in gaining it a proper attention, &amp;c. But this ſſiould&nbsp;not be too frequently uſed ; for iffo, befides its having&nbsp;a tendency to confound the natural importance of different paffages, it may not be altogether agreeable to&nbsp;ſome to have their own reflections broken in upon by&nbsp;a ſignal, which might be interpreted to hint at their&nbsp;wanting regulation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">o∏e obſervation more, and then we ſſiall attempt to recapitulate the ſubſtance of this ſection in the form&nbsp;of a precept. Though it is, when ſtrictly examined,&nbsp;inconfiſtent, both in ſpeaking and reading, to imitate&nbsp;with action what we are deſcribing, yet as in any thing&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">comic</span><span class="font2"> ſuch a practice may ſuggeſt ideas that will </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">accord</span><span class="font2"> with thofe oſ the ſubject, it may there be now and&nbsp;then indulged in either of theſe articles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“ In a manner ſimilar to that directed with regard to tones, moderate your bodily expreſſions of the ſigns&nbsp;of the emotions. And in order to fupply, as it were,&nbsp;this deficiency, introduce into your carriage ſuch an&nbsp;eaſy gracefulnefs, as may be confiſtent with your acquirements in thefe particulars, and the neceffary dread&nbsp;which ſſiould ever be preſent of falling into any kind&nbsp;of affectation or grimace.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">V. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Paufes.</span><span class="font2"> Speech conſiſting of a ſucceſſion oſ di-ſtinct words, muſt naturally be liable (both from a&nbsp;kind of accident, and a difficulty there may be in be-g’fining certain founds or portions of phraſes immediately on the ending of certain others) to feveral fmalΓ&nbsp;intermiſſions of voice ; of which, as they can have no&nbsp;meaning, nothing farther need here be ſaid. There are,&nbsp;however, ſome pauſes, which the ſenſe neceffarily de-mands ; and to theſe the ſubſtance of this ſection is di-τected.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font2">The panics are in part to diſtinguiſſi the members of ſentences from one another, the terminations of complete periods, and to afford an opportunity for taking&nbsp;breath. Beſides this, they have a very graceful effect&nbsp;in the modulation, on the fame account they are ſo effential in muſic.—In both articles, like blank fpaces in&nbsp;pictures, they ſet off and render more conſpicuous what-foever they disjoin or terminate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">were language made up of nothing but ſſiort collo-quial ſentences, theſe paufes, though they might do no harm, and would generally be graceful, would however&nbsp;be ſuperſeded as to uſe by the completeneſs and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">nar-rownefs,</span><span class="font2"> as we may ſay, of the meaning. But in more&nbsp;diffuſe language, compofed of ſeveral detached ſentences, and which require fome degree of attention in&nbsp;order to take in the ſenfe, the intermiſſions of voice&nbsp;under conſideration are of the greateſt ſervice, by ſig-nifying to the mind the progrefs and completion of the&nbsp;whole paffage. Now, though in extenſive and differently formed periods there may be members whoſe&nbsp;completeneſs of fenſe might be conceived of various degrees, aud hence might ſeem to require </span><span class="font0">a </span><span class="font2">ſet of pauſes&nbsp;equally numerous ; yet, ſince the ſenſe does not altogether depend upon theſe intermiſſions, and their ratios to one another, if capable of being properly defined, could 'not be accurately obſerved, grammarians&nbsp;have ventured to conceive the whole claſs of pauſes as&nbsp;reducible to the four or five kinds now in ufe, and&nbsp;whoſe marks and ratios are well known (g) ; prefu-∙&nbsp;ming that under the eye of taſte ; and with the aſſiſt-ance of a particular to be next mentioned, they would&nbsp;not fail in all cafes to ſuggeſt intermiſſions of voice&nbsp;ſuitable to the ſenfe. But in many of theſe extenfive&nbsp;and complex periods, rounded with a kind of redundancy of matter, where the full ſenſe is long ſuſpended,&nbsp;and the final words are not very important, there would&nbsp;be fome hazard of a miſapprehenfion of the termina-tion, had we not more evident and infallible notice of&nbsp;it than that which is given by the paufe. This notice is the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">cadence,</span><span class="font2"> referred to in the ſection on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Modulation ;</span><span class="font2"> which, as is there obſerved, befides the orna-mental variety it affords, appears from theſe remarks&nbsp;to be a very neceffary and ſerviceable article in perſpi-cuous delivery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As this cadence naturally accompanies the end of every entire ſenfe, circumftanced as above-mentioned,&nbsp;it may ſometimes fall hefo∙re the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ſemicolon,</span><span class="font2"> but morè&nbsp;generally before the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">colon,</span><span class="font2"> as well as the period : For&nbsp;theſe marks are often found to terminate a complete&nbsp;ſenſe ; and in theſe cafes, the relation what follows has&nbsp;to what went before, is lignified to the mind by the relative ſſiortnefs of the ſtop, and the form of introducing the additional matter. Nor can any bad conſe-</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>

A practice, it. is imagined, too deſtructive of the intended preciſion of thefe typical notices to be much longer adopted.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
