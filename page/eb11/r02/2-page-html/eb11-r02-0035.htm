<p><span class="font4">drawn up by Tiele </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Ency. Bril.,</span><span class="font4"> 9th ed., voI. xx. p. 360) will show what diversified products are blended together. Why&nbsp;should philosophical Brahmanism, or the Buddhism which&nbsp;reacted against it, be associated with so undeveloped a form as&nbsp;the religion of the ancient Latin settlers in mid-Italy? And&nbsp;why, on the other hand, should the religions of the lower culture,&nbsp;which are practically of a common type, be separated genealogically into numerous independent families? (2) Whitney@@<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>found the most important distinction to lie between religions&nbsp;which were the collective product of the wisdom of the community, race-religions as they might be called, and those which&nbsp;proceeded from individual founders. But, as TieIe pointed&nbsp;out, the “ individual ” element cannot be eliminated from the&nbsp;“ race-religion,” where each myth has been first uttered, each&nbsp;rite first performed, by some single person. And the founder&nbsp;who enters history with an impressive personality can only do&nbsp;his work through the response made to him by the insight and&nbsp;feeling of his time. (3) Kuenen disengaged another characteristic, the scope and aim of any given religion; was it limited to&nbsp;a particular people, or could it be thrown open to the world?&nbsp;On this foundation the higher religions were classed as national&nbsp;or universal, the latter group being formerIy supposed to include&nbsp;Buddhism, Christianity and Mahommedanisra. Here, once&nbsp;more, the student is confronted with many qualifications. A&nbsp;missionary religion Uke Mithraism, which established itself all&nbsp;the way from Western Asia to the borders of Scotland, was&nbsp;certainly not “ national.” Judaism and Brahmanism both&nbsp;passed beyond the confines of race. The Confucian morality&nbsp;could be adopted without difficulty in Japan. In other&nbsp;words, there was either a definite tendency to expansion, or there&nbsp;was no impediment in the religion itself when circumstances&nbsp;promoted its transplantation. Further, there are elements of&nbsp;Islam, like the usages of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">hajj</span><span class="font4"> (or pilgrimage to the sacred&nbsp;places at Mecca), the dryness of its official doctrine and the&nbsp;limitations of its real character as indicated in the Wahhabi&nbsp;revival, which so impair its apparent Universalism that Kuenen&nbsp;found himself obliged to withdraw it from the highest rank&nbsp;of religions.@@<sup>2</sup> (4) Professor M. Jastrow, jun., starting from the&nbsp;relation of religion to life, distinguishes four groups, the religions&nbsp;of savages, the religions of primitive culture, the reUgions of&nbsp;advanced culture and the religions which emphasize as an ideal&nbsp;the coextensiveness of religion with life. It may, however, be&nbsp;doubted whether the fundamental assumption of such a scheme,&nbsp;viz. that in the life of the savage religion plays a comparatively&nbsp;small part, can be satisfactorily established. The evidence&nbsp;rather implies that, so far as the sanctions of relligion affect the&nbsp;savage at all, they affect him with unusual force. In the absence&nbsp;of other competing interests his religious beliefs and duties&nbsp;occupy a much larger share of his attention than the votaries&nbsp;of many higher faiths bestow on theirs; and though his ethical&nbsp;range may be very limited, yet the total influence of his religion&nbsp;in determining for him what he may do and what he may not,&nbsp;brings the greater part of conduct under its control. The savage&nbsp;who finds himself encompassed by taboos which he dare not&nbsp;break, lives up to his religion with a faithfulness which many&nbsp;professing Christians fail to reach. (5) There remains a broad&nbsp;distinction between reUgions that are in the main founded on&nbsp;the relation of man to the powers of Nature, and those based&nbsp;on ethical ideas, which partly corresponds to the philosophical&nbsp;division already cited. This enabled Professor Tiele to arrange&nbsp;the chief religions in certain groups, starting from the primitive&nbsp;conception of the common life of the objects of the surrounding&nbsp;scene:—@@<sup>3</sup></span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>

<p><span class="font4">7. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Revelation.—</span><span class="font4">The second group in this division practicaIly corresponds to the second stage recognized by Caird; but it&nbsp;rests upon a somewhat different basis, the conception of revelation addressed to the conscience in the form of religious law.&nbsp;Neither Taoism nor Confucianism, indeed, makes this claim.&nbsp;The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tao-teh-king,</span><span class="font4"> or book of aphorisms on “ the Tao and virtue ”&nbsp;ascribed to Lao Tsze, is wholly unlike such a. composition as&nbsp;Deuteronomy; and the disciples of Confucius carefully refrained&nbsp;from attributing to him any kind of supernatural inspiration&nbsp;in his conversations about social and personal morality. The&nbsp;sacred literatures of India and Israel, however, present many&nbsp;analogies, and emerge out of a wide range of phenomena which&nbsp;have their roots in the practices of the lower culture. The&nbsp;belief that the Powers controlling man’s life are </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">w</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">illin</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">g </span><span class="font4">upon&nbsp;occasion to disclose something of their purpose, has led to&nbsp;widespread rites of divination, which Plato described as the&nbsp;“ art of fellowship between gods and men,” and the Stoics&nbsp;defended on grounds of a priori religious expectation as well as&nbsp;of universal experience. Through the dream the living was put&nbsp;into communication with the dead, which sometimes embodied&nbsp;itself in peculiar and pathetic literary forms, such as the&nbsp;Icelandic dream-verses imparted by the spirits of those who had&nbsp;been lost at sea or overwhelmed by the snow; and a whole&nbsp;series of steps leads up from necromancy to prophecy and oracle,&nbsp;as the higher gods become the teachers of men. The gods of&nbsp;revelation are naturally not the highest, since they appear as the&nbsp;interpreters of one superior to themselves. The revealing&nbsp;agency may be only a voice like Aius Locutius, to which the&nbsp;Romans raised a temple; or, like Hermes, he may be the&nbsp;messenger of the gods; or, like Marduk, pre-eminently the god&nbsp;of oracles in Babylonia, he may be the son of Ea, the mighty&nbsp;deep encompassing the earth, source of all wisdom and culture.&nbsp;To Marduk the prophet-god Nabu in his turn became son, and&nbsp;his consort Tasbmit (“ causing to hear ”) was the personification&nbsp;of Revelation. Egyptian thought ascribed this function to&nbsp;Thoth, who played somewhat different parts in different systems,&nbsp;but emerges as the representative of the immanent intelligence</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
