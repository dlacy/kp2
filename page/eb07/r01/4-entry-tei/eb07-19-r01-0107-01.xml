or Ryegate, a market and borough town of the county of Surrey, in the hundred of its own name, twenty-two miles from London. It is situated in a pleasant valley at the foot of the Chalk Hills, upon a branch of the river Mole. It has a weekly market on Tuesday, and a monthly one for cattle on Wednesday. It is an ancient borough, and, until 1832, returned two members to parliament, but it now returns only one. The population of the borough amounted in 1801 to 923, in 1811 to 1128, in 1821 to 1323, and in 1831 to 1419; but the Foreign, a part of the parish now added to the borough, contained, in 1831, 1978 inhabitants, making in all a population of 3397.</p>
