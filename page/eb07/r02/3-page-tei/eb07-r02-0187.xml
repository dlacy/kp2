It has been defined to be “ a government administered by monks, who conduct the affairs of a nation by the rules of a convent, and apply the maxims of the twelfth century to the business of the nineteenth ;” and the apathy and timidity, the dread of independent thinking and of free inquiry which it manifests, fully justify the statement. Such is the dread of innovation, that even vaccination is not permitted in Rome. The press is held in rigid durance, and all the best works on mental philosophy are prohibited. As might have been expected, these restrictions have proved in the highest degree injurious to the prosperity of literature. The state of science in Rome is still less flourishing, for it has been the constant policy of the papal government from the days of Galileo to the present time, to discourage as much as possible the research after truth. Rome, therefore, has not one eminent man of science ; there are very few who take even any interest in the matter; nor is there a single museum of natural history, public or private, worth notice. The constitution of society, too, is so framed as to hold every man in the situation in which he is bom. However meritorious or enterprising he may be, he can scarcely ever expect by his own personal exertion to raise himself to a higher station, for there are barriers he can never pass.</p><p>The clergy constitute the nobility of Rome ; they form the court of the sovereign, and fill all civil offices as well as ecclesiastical. The persons styled Roman princes are few in number, and, with two or three exceptions, very poor, and totally destitute of power or authority.</p><p>The inhabitants of the papal states, with very few exceptions, profess the Romish faith. According to the official returns the number of Jews in Rome is 3700; of heretics and Turks, 201. The Jews are compelled to reside in one particular quarter of the city. There is now a Protestant place of worship in Rome, in which an English clergyman regularly officiates, but this is rather connived at than openly tolerated. Of late years there has been a considerable increase in the number of the clergy. In 1825 they amounted to 4938 ; in 1835, to 5273. According to the official statement, there were, in 1836, 37 bishops, 1468 priests, 2023 monks, 1384 nuns, and in houses of education, 698. There is thus in Rome one clergyman for every ten families ; but it is supposed that the real number considerably exceeds the official return. The state of morals, both among clergy and laity, is far from satisfactory.</p><p>The absence of statistical accounts makes it impossible to state what is the number of children in the schools of the Roman territory. According to the calculation of the government, it is about 1 in 50 of the population. A bull was issued on this subject by Pope Leo XII., which was followed by a “ Reglamento degli Studj,” erecting a board intended to have the general direction of the business of education, the control of all universities and schools, and consists of certain cardinals in official stations, and others, to be nominated by the pope. It established two primary universities, Rome and Bologna, and six secondary universities. The universities have four faculties, theology, law, medico-surgery, and philosophy. But of this Reglamento only a very small portion refers to public schools. They are placed almost entirely under the control of the bishop. The teachers are elected by the communal council, but the bishop must confirm the nomination, and he possesses a perpetual power of dismissal without reference to the local authorities. But the business of education is almost universally neglected. The elementary schools in Rome are 872 ; the number of masters, 482, and of scholars, 14,099 ; that is to say, in the infant schools, 4800; in the gratuitous elementary schools for boys, 2694 ; for girls, 287 ; in the schools where a small sum is paid for instruction, 2115 boys, and 1600 girls. Many parts of Rome, however, as Trasta-vere and the Borgo, are very ill supplied. Rome contains four ecclesiastical boarding-schools, two seminaries, seven ecclesiastical colleges, five secular colleges, two universities, nine gratuitous parish schools, and sixty regionary ; seven schools kept by monks, one for the deaf and dumb, five pious places of education for males, and fourteen for females.</p><p>Two banks for savings have lately been established, one in Rome, the other in Spoleto ; that of Rome has been very successful, and in six months has received 50,000 crowns in deposits. The Monte di Pietà of Rome has existed for nearly three centuries. It has passed through many vicissitudes, and has now a circulating capital of about 230,000 crowns advanced on about 200,000 pledges. It is proposed to associate this establishment with the savings bank, which is now attached to the lottery office.</p><table><row><cell cols="9" rows="1"><p><hi rend="italic">The following Table shews the Receipts and Expenditure of the Roman States.</hi></p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"/><cell cols="2" rows="1"><p>General Heads of Receipt.</p></cell><cell cols="3" rows="1"><p>Expenses of Administration.</p></cell><cell cols="3" rows="1"><p>State Expenses.</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>No.</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>Particular Heads.</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"/><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>No.</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>Particular Heads.</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"/><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>No.</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>Heads.</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"/></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="14"><p>1</p><p>2</p><p>3</p><p>4</p><p>5</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>Predial imposts, landed property,</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="7"><p>Crowns.</p><p>3,280.000 00</p><p>4,120,000 00</p><p>550,000 00 250,000 00</p><p>1,100,000 00</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="14"><p>1</p><p>2</p><p>3</p><p>4</p><p>5</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>Predial imposts, landed proper-</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="7"><p>Crowns,</p><p>760,000 00</p><p>460,000 00</p><p>90,000 00 150,000 00 760,000 00</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="14"><p>1</p><p>2</p><p>3</p><p>4</p><p>5</p><p>6</p><p>7</p><p>8</p><p>9</p><p>10 11</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>Sacred palaces, sacred college, ecclesiastical congregations, and di-</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="13"><p>crowns,</p><p>500,000 00 2,680,000 (X)</p><p>530,000 00 920,000,00</p><p>110,000 00</p><p>280,000 00</p><p>580,000 00 1,900,000 00</p><p>290,000 00</p><p>44,000 00</p><p>100,000 00</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="3"><p>Monopolies, customs, and taxes on consumption</p><p>Stamps and regis-</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="3"><p>Monopolies, customs, and taxes on consumption</p><p>Stamps and regis-</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"/></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>Expenses of state government......</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>Public instruction, fine arts, and</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"/><cell cols="1" rows="1"/><cell cols="1" rows="2"><p>Charities and acts of public benefi-</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"/><cell cols="1" rows="1"/></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="3"><p>Total of receipts</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="8"><p>Total admini-1 stration and ¼ charges........j</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="2"><p>Public works, cleaning and illumi-</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="3"><p>9,300,000 00 2,220,000 00</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="7"><p>2,220,000 00</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="3"><p>Troops of the line and carabineers Other military charges, health, and</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="5"/></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="4"><p>7,080,000 00</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>Public festivals, aud extra expenses</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"/></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>Total of expenses of the state</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>7,934,000 00</p></cell></row></table><p>Thus the net receipts exhibit 7,080,000 crowns, and the net expenditure 7,934,000 crowns, showing a deficit of 854,000 crowns.</p><lb/><p>The average cost of collection appears to be nearly one-fourth of the gross revenue.
