<p><span class="font2">Talmud (see Rashi) Rashbam (7.u) was utilized. Riph was not only a great Talmudist, but also a man of the&nbsp;greatest magnanimity and highest morality, as may be&nbsp;seen from the following two facts. When R. Yishak Ibn&nbsp;Albalia, who had been his bitterest enemy, lay at the&nbsp;point of death, he recommended his son to Riph, who&nbsp;received him with the greatest kindness, and at once&nbsp;adopted him as son.</span><span class="font1">@@</span><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> Again, when Riph himself was at&nbsp;the point of death he recommended to the congregation&nbsp;of Lucena for successor, not his own learned and virtuous&nbsp;son Ya'akob, but the yet more learned, though not more&nbsp;virtuous, R. Yoseph Ibn Migash,</span><span class="font1">@@</span><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> who became the teacher&nbsp;of the teachers of Maimonides (g.u).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Although Riph’s works which are known are only two, the editions of one of these and the commentaries thereon are very&nbsp;numerous ; we can only mention a few of them.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">RIPLEY, a well-built market town of Derbyshire, situated near the river Derwent and the Cromford Canal, and on a branch line of the Midland Railway 10 miles north&nbsp;of Derby and 10 south of Chesterfield. The principal&nbsp;public building is the market-hall erected in 1880. In&nbsp;the neighbourhood there are extensive collieries, and coke&nbsp;is largely manufactured. Besides the large concern of the&nbsp;Butterley Iron Company, which includes foundries, blast&nbsp;furnaces, and boiler works, the town possesses silk and&nbsp;cotton mills. The charter for the market was granted&nbsp;by Henry III. The population of the urban sanitary&nbsp;district (area 1211 acres) in 1871 was 5639, and in 1881&nbsp;it was 6087.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RIPLEY, GEORGE (1802-1880), critic and man of letters, was born at Greenfield, in western Massachusetts,&nbsp;on October 3, 1802. He was educated at local schools and&nbsp;at Harvard College, where he took his degree in 1823,&nbsp;ranking first in his class, and then studying theology was&nbsp;in 1826 ordained pastor of a Unitarian church in Boston.&nbsp;Here his success as a thoughtful preacher was marked ;&nbsp;but in 1840 he resigned his charge, and he subsequently&nbsp;retired from the active ministry altogether.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It was during those years that there grew up in New England that form of thought or philosophy known as&nbsp;Transcendentalism—a name, as Emerson said, “ given nobody knows by whom, or when it was applied.” Its&nbsp;growth was part of what Dr Holmes has termed the “intellectual or, if we may call it so, spiritual revival ” which&nbsp;during the period from 1820 to 1840 was so strongly&nbsp;marked in the New England “ churches, in politics, in&nbsp;philanthropy, in literature.” Ripley w<sup>τ</sup>as prominent, if&nbsp;not the leader, in all practical manifestations of the&nbsp;movement ; and it was by his earnestness and practical&nbsp;energy that certain of its more tangible results were&nbsp;directed. The first meeting of the Transcendental Club&nbsp;was held at his house in September 1836. He was&nbsp;a founder and a chief supporter of the famous magazine&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Dial,</span><span class="font2"> which was the organ of the school from 1840&nbsp;to 1844. Most important of all, however, he was the&nbsp;originator and conductor of an experiment which was the&nbsp;most interesting practical result of the thought and tendencies of the time,—the foundation of “ The Brook Farm&nbsp;Association for Education and Agriculture.” This project,&nbsp;in the words of its originator, was intended “ to insure a&nbsp;more natural union between intellectual and manual labour&nbsp;than now exists ; to combine the thinker and the worker,&nbsp;as far as possible, in the same individual ; to guarantee&nbsp;the highest mental freedom by providing all with labour&nbsp;adapted to their tastes and talents, an&lt;i securing to them&nbsp;the fruits of their industry ; to do away with the necessity&nbsp;of menial services by opening the benefits of education and&nbsp;the profits of labour to all; and thus to prepare a society of&nbsp;liberal, intelligent, and cultivated persons w<sup>τ</sup>hose relations&nbsp;with each other w<sup>τ</sup>ould permit a more simple and wholesome&nbsp;life than can be led amidst the pressure of our competitive&nbsp;institutions.” In short, its aim was to bring about the&nbsp;best conditions for an ideal civilization, reducing to a&nbsp;minimum the labour necessary for mere existence, and by&nbsp;this and by the simplicity of its social machinery saving&nbsp;the maximum of time for mental and spiritual education&nbsp;and development. At a time when Emerson could write&nbsp;to Carlyle, “ We are all a little wild here with numberless&nbsp;projects of social reform ; not a reading man but has a&nbsp;draft of a new community in his waistcoat pocket,”—the&nbsp;Brook Farm project certainly did not appear as impossible&nbsp;a scheme as many others that were in the air. At all&nbsp;events it enlisted the co-operation of men whose subsequent careers show them to have been something more than&nbsp;visionaries. The association bought a tract of land in&nbsp;West Roxbury, some ten miles from Boston, and with about&nbsp;twenty members actually began its enterprise in the&nbsp;summer of 1841.</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;">

<p><span class="font2">For three years the undertaking went on quietly and simply, subject to few outward troubles other than financial&nbsp;difficulties, the number of associates increasing to seventy&nbsp;or eighty. Pictures of the life they led have been preserved&nbsp;by many hands. It <sup>-</sup>was during this period that Hawthorne had his short experience of Brook Farm, of which&nbsp;so many suggestions appear in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rlithedale Romance,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">though his preface to later editions effectually disposed of&nbsp;the idea—which gave him great pain—that he had either&nbsp;drawn his characters from persons there, or had meant&nbsp;to give any actual description of the colony. Emerson,&nbsp;though he refused in a kind and characteristic letter to&nbsp;join in the undertaking, and though he afterwards wrote&nbsp;of Brook Farm with not uncharitable humour as·“a perpetual picnic, a French Revolution in small, an age of&nbsp;reason in a patty-pan,” yet spoke of the design as “ noble&nbsp;and generous,” and among its founders were many of his&nbsp;near friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In 1844 the growing need of a more scientific organization, and the influence which Fourier’s doctrines had gained in the minds of Ripley and many of his associates,&nbsp;combined to change the whole plan of the community.&nbsp;It was transformed, with the strong approval of all its chief&nbsp;members and the consent of the rest, into a Fourierist&nbsp;“phalanx” in 1845. There was an accession of new&nbsp;members, a momentary increase of prosperity, a brilliant&nbsp;new undertaking in the publication of a journal, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Harbinger,</span><span class="font2"> in which Ripley, Charles A. Dana, Francis G.&nbsp;Shaw, and John Dwight were the chief writers, and to&nbsp;which Lowell, Whittier, George William Curtis, Parke&nbsp;Godwin, Story, Channing, Higginson, Horace Greeley, and&nbsp;many more now and then contributed. But the individuality of the old Brook Farm was gone. The association&nbsp;was not rescued even from financial troubles by the&nbsp;change. With increasing difficulty it kept on till the&nbsp;spring of 1846, when a fire which destroyed its building&nbsp;or “ phalanstery ” brought losses which caused, or certainly&nbsp;gave the final ostensible reason for, its dissolution. Its&nbsp;failure left Ripley poor and feeling keenly the defeat of</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
