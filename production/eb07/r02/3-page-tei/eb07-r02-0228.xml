This homage to an individual personally unknown, was paid to him as “ the friend of peace, of reform, and of religious liberty.” In his printed address to the independcnt electors of this borough, he expressed his “ conviction that the great work, which must eventually produce the reformation and happiness of the people, was already begun.” An eventful period of twenty years served to evince how well he had discerned tile signs of the times.</p><p>The return of peace did not immediately produce all the benefits that were anticipated. The war-establishment, with its lavish profusion of expenditure, had long contributed to maintain an artificial state of things. When the war was at length brought to a termination, we were overwhelmed with an enormous national debt ; and under such burdens as this debt imposed, it was difficult for manufactures and trade to find a favourable channel. The banking-house with which Roscoe was connected did not escape the commercial pressure of that period. Great exertions were made by the partners to avert the crisis by which they were threatened ; but suspicions having been excited, large balances were suddenly withdrawn from the bank ; and after struggling for a few days in the vain hope of supporting their credit, they were, on the 25th of January 1816, reduced to the necessity of suspending their payments. A committee appointed by the creditors reported that, after the liquidation of the debts, there would remain a surplus of L.6l,l44. The bank was never shut; and the house was allowed six years for discharging all the debts, with interest. Roscoe undertook the management of its affairs, and exerted himself with surprising energy. One of the greatest trials which he sustained, was the necessity of parting with his library, pictures, and other works of art, the valuable and cherished accumulation of nearly half a century. The auction of his library, which was sold by Win-stanley of London, extended to fourteen days, commencing with the 19th of August 1816. It included rare and precious works in several departments, but was particularly rich in Italian literature. The sale of the books was immediately followed by that of the prints, which occupied eleven days, and, being divided into 1352 lots, produced the sum of L.1915. Is. The drawings, consisting of 610 lots, and the paintings, of 156, were sold for L.2825. 19s.</p><p>In the midst of these vicissitudes and trials, which he endured with exemplary fortitude, he still retained his love of literature. In the establishment of the Royal Institution of Liverpool, he lent his effective aid. A plan for such an institution had in 1813 been written by Dr Traill, now professor of medical jurisprudence in the university of Edinburgh. The scheme was at length brought towards maturity ; and, after an interval of four years, Mr Roscoe, as chairman of a committee, prepared an explanatory report. He was induced, though not without considerable difficulty, to compose and to deliver the inaugural address at the opening of the institution. The attendance was very numerous, and he received the most gratifying applause. On the ensuing day, he was requested by the committee to publish his discourse, and it accordingly appeared under the subsequent title : “ On the Origin and Vicissitudes of Literature, Science, and Art, and their Influence on the present State of Society : a Discourse delivered on the Opening of the Liverpool Royal Institution, 25th November 1817.” In 1819 he published his “ Observations on Penal Jurisprudence, and the Reformation of Offenders.” In 1822 appeared his “ Additional Observations” on the same subject ; and a third part followed in 1825. He afterwards published two tracts on the penitentiary discipline of the United States. In all his literary undertakings, he aimed at improving the morals and increasing the happiness of mankind.</p><p>In the mean time, the affairs of the bank had reached their final crisis. The partners found themselves unable to contend with the difficulties which beset and impeded their progress, and a commission of bankruptcy was issued in the year 1820, Having now withdrawn from business, he seems to have placed his chief reliance on the remuneration of his literary labours. Some of his friends privately raised the sum of L.2500, and vested it in trustees for the benefit of himself and his family. “ The office of communicating to him this kind and liberal act, on the part of his friends, was confided to Dr Traill, who by his judicious representations, and affectionate remonstrances, succeeded in removing from the mind of Mr Roscoe the objections which he felt to incur obligations of so serious a nature.” About this period, he found a pleasing employment in arranging and improving the library of Mr Coke, now earl of Leicester, and in preparing a catalogue of the numerous manuscripts. His visits to Holkham were rendered peculiarly pleasant ; and this gentleman, as we are informed, “ conferred upon him obligations of no ordinary nature.” His literary ardour was still unabated ; and in 1822 he published an octavo volume, under the title of “ Blustrations, Historical and Critical, of the Life of Lorenzo de’ Medici, called the Magnificent ; with an Appendix of original and other Documents.” An Italian version, exclusive of the appendix, was published at Florence by Pecchioli in the course of the following year. In 1822 he likewise published a “Memoir of Richard Roberts Jones of Aberdaron, in the county of Carnarvon, in North Wales, exhibiting a remarkable instance of a partial power and cultivation of intellect.” This extraordinary character, who was originally a fisher-lad, “ continues to display a love of learning and an extent of erudition seldom exhibited within the walls of schools or universities, united with a want of common sense amounting almost to idiocy, and a squalor and wretchedness of appearance of which a common mendicant would be ashamed.” At Allerton he had a conversation with Dr Parr on languages, oriental and occidental ; and on being afterwards asked his opinion of the learned stranger, he replied, “ He is less ignorant than most men.”</p><p>During this year he quitted his residence in Liverpool, and took a house in Lodge Lane, Toxteth Park, about a mile from the town. Two years afterwards he had the severe misfortune to lose the excellent and cherished partner of all his joys and sorrows. She died on the 24th of September 1824. This event was very deeply felt ; but the affectionate attention of his two daughters afforded some compensation of a loss which it was impossible to repair. In the early part of the year he had been elected an honorary associate of the Royal Society of Literature ; and after an interval of a few months he was appointed an associate of the first class. He thus became entitled to a pension of one hundred guineas ; but, on the death of the king, the annual grant from the privy purse was withheld by his successor. As its total amount was only a thousand pounds, this cannot but be considered as a miserable piece of economy. In 1827 the great gold medal of the society was awarded to him for his merits as an historian. From other learned associations he obtained various honours ; nor must we omit to state that, during the same year, he was elected a corresponding member of the Accademia della Crusca.</p><p>In the spring of 1821 he had been engaged by the London booksellers to undertake a new edition of the Works of Po∣&gt;e. It appeared in 1824, in ten volumes octavo. He contributed a copious and elegant life of the author, and to a selection of the notes of former editors added a few of his own. Of the character of Pope, both as a man and as a poet, he formed a more favourable estimate than either Dr Warton or Mr Bowles. Those who deny or reluctantly concede to Pope the name of a poet, seem to judge according to a very arbitrary standard. A few months after the</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
