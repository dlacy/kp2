        <p><span class="font0">During the season of love, in spring, the male alligator is a fierce
                and dangerous animal, and possibly its observation by different naturalists, at
                different seasons of the year,&nbsp;may account for the contradictions which pervade
                the recorded statements of its life and manners. When thus excited, no man dares to
                swim or wade among them, or, as&nbsp;Mr Audubon quietly observes, “ they are usually
                left alone&nbsp;at this season,” a delicate piece of attention, which, we&nbsp;doubt
                not, like other virtues, is its own reward. The female prepares her nest about the
                first of June, choosing a&nbsp;place about forty or fifty yards from the water, in
                some&nbsp;thick bramble or cane, where she gathers leaves, sticks,&nbsp;and rubbish
                of all kinds, carrying the materials in her&nbsp;mouth as a hog does straw. As soon
                as a proper nidus&nbsp;is formed, she lays about ten eggs, which she covers
                over&nbsp;with more rubbish and mud ; and proceeding in this manner, she deposits
                about fifty or sixty eggs in various layers.&nbsp;The whole is then covered up,
                matted, and tangled together with long grasses, in such a manner that it is
                extremely difficult to break it up. These eggs are in size like those&nbsp;of a
                goose, but of a longer form, and are protected rather&nbsp;by a parchment-like
                transparent substance than by shell.&nbsp;Though they are not eaten either by hogs
                or vultures, the&nbsp;female, now not only wary, but ferocious, watches near
                the&nbsp;spot, visiting the water from time to time for food. The&nbsp;nest is of
                course easily discovered, as she always goes and&nbsp;returns the same way, and soon
                forms a conspicuous path&nbsp;by the dragging of her giant form. According to Mr
                Audubon, to whom we stand indebted for these details, it is&nbsp;not the heat of the
                sun which hatches the eggs, but that of&nbsp;the nest itself,—a perfect hot-bed,
                from the mode of its formation. The young, as soon as excluded, force their
                way&nbsp;through the walls of their putrescent chambers, and issue&nbsp;forth all as
                beautiful and brisk as lizards. The female then&nbsp;leads them to the lake, or more
                frequently, for greater security, to some small detached bayou ; for now the
                males,&nbsp;their own ungentle fathers, will swallow them by hundreds,&nbsp;and the
                wood-ibis and sand-hill cranes devour them. @@<sup>1</sup></span></p>

                more especially the alligator of Guiana and Brazil. Its snout, though broad, has not
                the sides parallel, as&nbsp;in the preceding, and is more triangular in its shape.
                The&nbsp;lower edge of the orbits are very prominent, and a crest projecting between
                them gives the appearance whence their specific name is derived. Its colour is
                bluish-green above, and&nbsp;irregularly marbled green and yellow, more or less
                pale, below. Azara speaks of a red variety, which is the most savage&nbsp;of all. It
                acquires a great size. Cuvier has seen it fourteen&nbsp;feet long ; and in Surinam
                some have attained the length of&nbsp;twenty and twenty-four feet. In South America
                it extends&nbsp;as far as 32° south latitude, the same distance from
                the&nbsp;equator on the one side, as the preceding species reaches on&nbsp;the
                other. It cannot run half so swiftly as man, and rarely&nbsp;attacks him ; but when
                the eggs are plundered, the female&nbsp;defends them courageously. She lays,
                according to some,&nbsp;as many as sixty, and covers them with a few leaves or
                a&nbsp;little straw. It passes the night in water, as Herodotus states&nbsp;of the
                crocodile of the Nile, and during the day basks in the&nbsp;sun on the banks. It has
                been stated, that in certain places,&nbsp;when the morass is partially dried, the
                remaining water is&nbsp;so crowded with caymans that nothing is to be seen
                but&nbsp;their projecting backs.</span></p>

                also that he relates the following anecdote. “ One fine evening last year,&nbsp;as
                the people of Angustura, said its governor, were sauntering up and down here on the
                bank of the Oronoco, I was&nbsp;within twenty yards of this place, when I saw a
                large cayman rush out of the river, seize a man, and carry him&nbsp;down, before any
                body had it in his power to assist him.&nbsp;The screams of the poor fellow were
                terrible as the cayman&nbsp;was running off with him. He plunged into the river
                with&nbsp;his prey ; we instantly lost sight of him, and never saw or&nbsp;heard him
                more.” The negroes of South America sometimes&nbsp;eat the flesh, notwithstanding
                its fetid and musky smell.&nbsp;Azara tells us that they succeed in sticking it with
                an armed&nbsp;harpoon, and after fatiguing it in the water, null it out by&nbsp;main
                force and despatch it.</span></p>

                alligator.</span><span class="font0"> The muzzle in this species is somewhat longer
                and less depressed than in the preceding, and the margins of the orbits are&nbsp;not
                projecting. The character, however, which at once distinguishes it from all the
                other Crocodilidæ is, that the&nbsp;upper eyelid is wholly occupied with an osseous
                plate, divided&nbsp;into three pieces by sutures. None of its congeners
                have&nbsp;more than a small osseous particle near the inner angle. Its&nbsp;teeth
                are ½¾ on each side of each jaw. The interval between&nbsp;the two external toes is
                less palmated than in the other&nbsp;species, from which it may be concluded to be
                more terrestrial. This animal inhabits Cayenne, and exhibits considerable variation
                in its characters.</span></p>

        <p><span class="font0">The members of this family are characterised by a slender extensile
                tongue, terminated by two filaments, like that of many snakes. All the four legs
                have five toes, separate,&nbsp;of unequal size, especially the hinder ones, and
                furnished&nbsp;with nails. The scales on the abdomen, and those beneath&nbsp;the
                tail, are disposed in transverse parallel bands. A produced portion of the skin,
                longitudinally cleft, and closing&nbsp;by a sphincter, protects the eye, beneath the
                anterior angle&nbsp;of which there is the vestige of a third eyelid. The
                false&nbsp;ribs do not form an entire circle.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">The species of this family are numerous and diversified, and now
                constitute several generic groups. Like all other&nbsp;reptiles, they are much more
                abundant in sultry than in&nbsp;cold or temperate climates. “ I am positive,” says
                Mr&nbsp;Bruce, alluding to the lizard tribe in general, “ that I can
                say&nbsp;without exaggeration, that the number I saw one day, in the&nbsp;great
                court of the temple of the sun at Balbec, amounted&nbsp;to many thousands ; the
                ground, the walls, and stones of&nbsp;the ruined buildings were covered with them,
                and the various colours of which they consisted made a very extraordinary
                appearance, glittering under the sun, in which they&nbsp;lay sleeping and basking.”
                He adds, that the desert parts&nbsp;of Syria, bordering on Arabia Deserta, abound
                with these&nbsp;reptiles beyond the possibility of calculation.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">The genus Monitor of Cuvier contains the largest species, some of
                them almost approaching to the size of crocodiles. They have teeth on both jaws, but
                none upon the palate. The greater number have the tail compressed,&nbsp;which aids
                their aquatic propensities. Their vicinity to water brings them into the frequent
                neighbourhood of crocodiles and caymans, and they are said to give warning of
                the&nbsp;approach of these formidable reptiles by a shrill whistle.&nbsp;Hence
