We may obſerve by the way, that if we confider the whirling body as a ſyſtem of ſeveral bodies with rigid or inflexible connections, we may confider all the matter of each of theſe bodies as united in its centre of gyration, and the rotation of the whole will be the ſame ; for this does not</p><p>∕&gt; <hi rend="sup">r</hi>'</p><p>change the value of ~—·►</p><p>There is another way of making this correction of the motion of a machine, or allowing for the inertia of the machine itſelf, which is rather limpler than the one now given. We can ſuppoſe a quantity of matter collected at the point to which the moving force is applied, ſuch that its inertia will oppoſe the ſaine reſiſtance to rotation that the machine does in its natural form.

For while the body has its natural form, the whole force of gravity may be fuppoſed to be exerted on its centre of gravity. When the matter of the body is collected at O, the force of gravity is concentrated there alſo ; and if CG have the ſame inclination to the horizon in. the firſt caſe that CO has in the ſecond, the action of gravity will be applied in the ſame angle of inclination, and the two bodies will acquire the fame angular velocity ; that is, they will deſcend from this ſituation to the vertical ſituation (that is, through an equal angle) in the ſame time. Theſe two bodies will therefore oſcillate in equal times.
