Indeed, it is one of the strongest proofs of the redeeming genius which Mrs. Radcliffe has thrown into her tales, constructed, as they are, upon so unsatisfactory a plan, that they bear a second perusal at all ; or that having discovered in one or two cases the inadequate and puerile nature of what appeared at first so appalling and formidable, we still feel eager for the solution of the remaining mysteries, and can hardly persuade ourselves but that something strange and fearful does lurk, after all, within her deserted chambers, and beneath her faded tapestry.</p><p>It is the more to be regretted that Mrs. Radcliffe adopted this principle, because all the excellencies of her peculiar genius might have been displayed with equal effect, if she had chosen a more satisfactory plan of composition. Why she should have hesitated to admit of an actual spiritual agency, it is difficult to discover. Fear, when its object is something corporeal, is no doubt the basest and vulgarest of feelings. But when its source lies in the invisible, and when we shrink at the thoughts of the visionary and the eternal, it puts on the character of sublimity. Standing, as we do, on the confines of a dim eternity, which we believe but cannot see, the feeling which prompts us to a communion with the world of spirits, and yet makes us shrink and tremble at our own daring, exists to such an extent in all minds, and not the least in the most heroic, as to afford a basis on which high imagination may always operate with effect, so as to justify the artful use of the supernatural. We say the <hi rend="italic">artful</hi>  use, for every thing depends on the skill with which such machinery is used, the address of the preparation, and the judgment with which the accessories and the background are selected. Who feels the slightest symptom of awe when the shade of Amphiaraus appears before tlle assembled people to forbid the banns between Eriphyle and Alcmæon, or that of Ninus emerges in broad day from the tomb, in Voltaire’s <hi rend="italic">Semiramis?</hi>  Who does not,—at least in reading the play,—experience a pleasing thrill of fear, ¼dlen, in the depth of a December night, witll the sea moaning behind, and the bell then beating one, the majesty of buried Denmark advances with spectral stalk along the platform of Elsineur ? We grant there has been few successful attempts in modern times to keep up the interest of a story turning upon machinery avowedly supernatural, but we are far from thinking that such an attempt might not, even yet, in our days of illumination, be made by a man of genius, so as to move the pulses of terror with complete success.</p><p>But besides the actual field of the supernatural, there are many equivocal phenomena in our nature, lying within that debateable land where mind and body meet, such as dreams, omens, and presentiments, which admit of being referred by the mind, in an excited state, to supernatural causes, and which may be employed with powerful effect by writers of fiction, without the possession of that creative genius and knowledge of the human heart which are required to present the sheeted dead in a shape and garb of terror calculated to impress and awe the imagination. And such, in fact, is the diluted shape in which the supernatural is generally presented by our modern romance writers.</p><p>From all these sources of emotion, Mrs. Radcliffe has unfortunately excluded herself by her system of sufficient reason founded on natural causes. And yet it is wonderful what a magical power she exercises within the field to which she restricts herself. No one ever seems to have understood better the art of preparation, the attunement of the mind to the key of the supernatural, by a long train of half-heard sounds, and glimpses of sights, which the fancy, amidst night and silence, works up for itself into images of things which it fears to contemplate.</p><p>Like one that on a lonesome road Doth walk in fear and dread ;</p><p>And having once looked round*, walks on,</p><p>And turns no more his head,—</p><p>Because be knows a frightful fiend Doth close behind him tread.</p><p>And perhaps the strongest proof of her judgment is to be found in the economy and reserve with which she employs the talisman of terror. In her hands slight circumstances and half hints are made to produce all the effect of fearful witcheries or scenes of bloodshed and horror. The clang of a distant door, a footfall or a track of blood upon a staircase, a strain of music floating over a forest, a figure pacing a platform in silence, some wandering voice following us, “ with airy tongue that syllables men’s names,” through the passages of a decaying chateau, the heaving of the tapestry of a bed in somc deserted chamber, nay, at last a very rat behind the arras, become invested with a mysterious dignity, and work upon tlle imagination like spells. The disappearance of Ludovico, for instance, in the haunted apartment of Chateau Le Blanc, where he had undertaken to watch, prepared as it is by a train of little details which act upon the nerves, and by the masterly ghost story of <hi rend="italic">Bevys of Lancaster,</hi>  which he is represented as perusing, may be safely pointed out as a <hi rend="italic">coup de rnaitre</hi>  in the art of raising to its highest pitch, the feeling of curiosity and suspense.</p><p>Whether Mrs. Radcliffe possessed much power of painting character seems doubtful ; it is at least certain she has shown but little. In such calculations of probability, we can only use Sebastian’s words.—“ What <hi rend="italic">had been</hi>  is unknown, what <hi rend="italic">is,</hi>  appears.” She seems indeed to have borrowed a hint from Bayes, which like many other remarks of that worthy, have more good sense in them than was perhaps apparent to the noble parodist, and purposely to have “underwrit some parts in order to set off the rest in other words, she has systematicallykept the delineation of her characters subordinate to her main object, tlle maintenance of a mysterious curiosity, which never <hi rend="italic">is,</hi>  but always <hi rend="italic">is to be</hi>  gratified. Her tales, indeed, would have probably gained little by greater discrimination in this respect, if in truth the species of interest produced by the natural would not have rather interfered with that arising from the marvellous. For her object, it was sufficient that as the representatives of classes, rather than individuals, her personages should be sketched spiritedly but lightly ; that the straight-laced heroine in white satin, should be duly supported by the gossiping waiting woman in white muslin, and that the bandit chief of the Appenines, the hired robber, the scowling monk, or the chattering peasant should wear with a natural air the outward and conventional badges of their calling. The nearest approach she has made to character, is in her Schidoni, whoseoutward appearance is most picturesquely and impress-ingly described, while the inscrutable mystery which at first hangs over the inward man, the dark hints which are dropped concerning him by others, and the gradual revelation of his designs in his conversations with the Marchioness, powerfully stimulate our interest, and make us follow all his actions with an instinctive feeling of alarm. The misfortune is that even in this, the most finished of her portraits, the Schidoni of the second is really not the Schidoni of the first portion of the tale. When “ the father softens,” the confessor unfortunately can no longer “ remain fixed ;” when he ceases to be the mere evil spirit of the romance, puts on the look even of a guilty humanity, and turns out to be simply “ a bold bad man,” he loses bis identity, and with that his influence over the imagination.</p><p>Mrs. Radcliffe may claim the merit of being the first to</p></body></text></TEI>
