                <p><label>SCHRÖDER-DERIENT, WILHELMINE</label> (1804-1860), German operatic
                    singer, was born on the 6th of December 1804, in Hamburg, being the daughter of
                    the actress, Sophie Schröder (1781-1868). Her first impersonation was at the age
                    of fifteen as Aricia in Schiller’s translation of Racine’s <hi rend="italic"
                        >Phèdre,</hi> and in 1821 she was received with so much enthusiasm as Pamina
                    in Mozart’s <hi rend="italic">Zauberflöte</hi> that her future career in opera
                    was assured. In 1823 she married Karl Devrient, but was separated from him in
                    1828, afterwards making two other marriages. Meanwhile she had maintained her
                    popularity at Dresden and elsewhere. She made her first Paris appearance in
                    1830, and she sang in London in 1833 and 1837. As a singer she combined a rare
                    quality of tone with dramatic intensity of expression, which was as remarkable
                    on the concert platform as in opera. She died in Coburg on the 26th of January
                    1860.</p>
