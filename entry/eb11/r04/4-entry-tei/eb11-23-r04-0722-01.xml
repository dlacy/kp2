               <p>                   <label>ROSACEAE</label>, in botany, a large cosmopolitan family of seedbearing
                    plants belonging to the subclass Polypetalae of Dicotyledons and containing
                    about 90 genera with 2000 species. The plants vary widely in manner of growth.
                    Many are herbaceous, growing erect, as <hi rend="italic">Geum,</hi> or with
                    slender creeping stem, as in species of <hi rend="italic">Potentilla,</hi>
                    sometimes sending out long runners, as in strawberry; others are shrubby, as
                    raspberry, often associated with a scrambling habit, as in the brambles and
                    roses, while apple, cherry, pear, plum and other British fruit trees represent
                    the arborescent habit. Vegetative propagation takes place by means of runners,
                    which root at the apex and form a new plant, as in strawberry; by suckers
                    springing from the base of the shoot and rising to form new leafy shoots after
                    running for some distance beneath the soil, as in raspberry; or by shoots
                    produced from the roots, as in cherry or plum. The scrambling of the brambles
                    and roses is effected by means of prickles on the branches and leaf-stalks.</p>               <p>The leaves, which are arranged alternately, are simple, as in apple, cherry,
                    &amp;c., but more often compound, with leaflets palmately arranged, as in
                    strawberry and species of <hi rend="italic">Potentilla,</hi> or pinnately
                    arranged, as in the brambles, roses, mountain ash, &amp;c. A difference in this respect often occurs in one and the same genus,
                    as in <hi rend="italic">Pyrus,</hi> where apple (P. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Malus),</hi> and pear (P. <hi rend="italic">communis)</hi> have simple
                    leaves, whereas mountain ash or rowan (P. <hi rend="italic">aucuparia)</hi> has
                    pinnately compound leaves. In warm climates the leaves are often leathery and
                    evergreen. The leayes are stipulate, the stipules being sometimes small and ’
                    shortlived, as in <hi rend="italic">Pyms</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Prunus</hi>
                    (cherry, plum, &amp;c.), or more important structures adnate to the base of
                    the leaf-stalk, as in roses, brambles, &amp;c. The flowers, which are
                    regular, generally bisexual, and often showy, are sometimes borne singly, as in
                    some species of rose, or of the cloudberry <hi rend="italic">(Rubus
                        chamaemorus),</hi> or few or more together in a corymbose manner, as in some
                    roses, hawthorn and others. The inflorescence in agrimony is a raceme, in <hi
                        rend="italic">Poterium</hi> a dense-flowered spike, in <hi rend="italic"
                        >Spiraea</hi> a number of cymes arranged in a corymb. The parts of the
                    flowers are arranged on a 5-merous plan, with generally considerable increase in
                    the number of stamens and carpels. The shape of the thalamus or floral
                    receptacle, and the relative position and number of the stamens and carpels and
                    the character of the fruit, vary widely and form distinguishing</p>               <p>features of the different suborders, six of which may be recognized.</p>               <p>                   <hi rend="italic">Suborder</hi> J. <hi rend="italic">Spiraeoideae</hi> is
                    characterized by a fiat or slightly concave receptacle on which the carpels,
                    frequently five in number, form a central whorl; each ovary contains several
                    ovules, and the fruit is a follicle. There are five sepals, five petals and the
                    stamens vary from ten to indefinite. The plants are generally shrubs with simple
                    or compound leaves and racemes or panicles of numerous small white, rose or
                    purple flowers. This suborder, which is nearly allied to the order
                    Saxifragaceae, contains 17 genera, chiefly north temperate in distribution. The
                    largest is <hi rend="italic">Spiraea,</hi> numerous species of which are
                    cultivated in gardens; 5. <hi rend="italic">salicifolia</hi> occurs in
                    Britain.apparently wild in plantations, but is not indigenous. The native
                    British meadow-sweet (5. <hi rend="italic">Utmaria)</hi> and dropwort (5. <hi
                        rend="italic">Filipendula)</hi> have been placed in a separate genus, <hi
                        rend="italic">Vlmaria,</hi> and included in the Rosoideae on account of
                    their one-seeded fruit. <hi rend="italic">Quillaja saponaria</hi> is the Chilean
                    soap tree; the bark contains saponin.</p>               <p>                   <hi rend="italic">Suborder II. Pomoideae</hi> is characterized by a deep
                    cup-shaped receptacle with the inner wall of which the five or fewer carpels are
                    united (fig. 1, 3); the carpels are also united with each other, and each
                    contains generally two ovules. The fruit is made up of the large fleshy
                    receptacle surrounding the ripe ovaries, the endocarp of which is leathery, or
                    stony and contains one seed. The plants are shrubs or trees with simple or
                    pinnately compound leaves and white or rose-coloured often showy flowers, with
                    five sepals and petals and indefinite stamens. The 14 genera are distributed
                    through the north temperate zone, extending southwards in the New World to the
                    Andes of Peru and Chile. The largest genus, <hi rend="italic">Pyrus,</hi> with
                    about 50 species, includes apple (P. <hi rend="italic">Malus),</hi> pear (P. <hi
                        rend="italic">communis)</hi> (fig. 2), wild service (P. <hi rend="italic"
                        >torminalis),</hi> rowan or mountain-ash (P. <hi rend="italic"
                        >aucuparia),</hi> and white beam (P. <hi rend="italic">Aria). Mespilus</hi>
                    (medlar) and <hi rend="italic">Cotoneaster</hi> are also included. (See separate
                    articles for most of the above.)</p>               <p>                   <hi rend="italic">Suborder III. Rosoideae</hi> is characterized by the
                    receptacle being convex and swollen (fig. 1, 1), as in strawberry, or
                    cup-shaped, as in.rose (fig. 4), and bearing numerous carpels, each of which
                    contains one or two ovules, while the fruit is one-seeded and inde-hiscent. The
                    39 genera are grouped in tribes according to the form of the receptacle and of
                    the fruit. The Potentilleae bear the carpels on a large, rounded or convex
                    outgrowth of the receptacle.</p>               <p>In the large genus <hi rend="italic">Rubus</hi> (fig. 3) the ripe ovaries form
                    drupels upon the ary receptacle; the genus is almost cosmopolitan, but the
                    majority of species occur in the forest region of the north temperate zone and
                    in the mountains of tropical America. <hi rend="italic">R. fruticosus</hi> is
                    blackberry, <hi rend="italic">R. Idaeus,</hi> raspberry, and <hi rend="italic"
                        >R. Chamac-morus,</hi> cloudberry. In the flower of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Potentilla, Fragaria</hi> (strawberry) and a few allied genera an <hi
                        rend="italic">epicalyx</hi> is formed by stipular structures arising at the
                    base of the sepals. The fruits consist of numerous dry achenes borne in <hi
                        rend="italic">Fragaria</hi> on the much-enlarged</p>                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r04-0723" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0776.jp2"/>

                        >Geum</hi> (avens) and <hi rend="italic">Dryas</hi> (an arctic and alpine
                    genus) the style is persistent in the</p>               <p>fruit, forming a feathery appendage <hi rend="italic">(Dryas)</hi> or a barbed
                    awn (avens), either of which is of service in distributing the fruit. The
                    Poten-tilleae are chiefly north temperate, arctic and alpine plants.</p>               <p>                   <hi rend="italic">I</hi>
               </p>               <p>The Roseae comprise the large genus <hi rend="italic">Rosa,</hi> characterized
                    by a more or less urn-shaped torus (fig. 4) enclosing the
                    numerous carpels which form dry one-seeded fruits enveloped in the
                    bright-coloured fleshy torus. The numerous stamens surround the mouth of the
                    torus. The plants are shrubs bearing prickles on the stems and leaves; many
                    species have a scrambling habit resembling the brambles. The species of <hi
                        rend="italic">Rosa,</hi> like those of <hi rend="italic">Rubus,</hi> are
                    extremely variable, and a great number of subspecies, varieties and forms have
                    been described. The Sanguisorbeae are a reduced form of Rosoideae. The dry
                    one-seeded fruit is enclosed in the urn-shaped</p>               <p>torus, which, however, is dry and inconspicuous, and the number of carpels is
                    much reduced, sometimes to one (fies. 2. 5. 6). Petals are often wanting, as in
                        <hi rend="italic">Alchemilla</hi> (lady’s</p>               <p>mantle) and <hi rend="italic">Poterium,</hi> and the flowers</p>               <p>are often unisexual and frequently wind-</p>               <p>pollinated, as in salad burnet <hi rend="italic">(Poterium</hi>
               </p>               <p>                   <hi rend="italic">Sanguisorba),</hi> where the small flowers</p>               <p>are crowded in heads, the upper pistil</p>               <p>late, with protruding feathery stigmas,</p>               <p>and the lower staminate (or bisexual),</p>               <p>with exserted stamens. <hi rend="italic">Agrimonia</hi>
               </p>               <p>(agrimony) has a long spike of small</p>               <p>honeyless flowers with yellow petals; in</p>               <p>the fruit the torus becomes nard and</p>               <p>crowned by hooked bristles which ensure</p>               <p>the distribution of the enclosed achenes.</p>               <p>                   <hi rend="italic">Suborder IV. Neuradoideae</hi> contains only two genera of
                    desert-inhabiting herbs with yellow flowers; and the five to ten carpels are
                    united together and with the base of the cup-shaped torus, which enlarges to
                    form a dry covering round the one-seeded fruits.</p>               <p>                   <hi rend="italic">Suborder V. Prunoideae</hi> (fig. 7) is characterized by a
                    free solitary carpel with a terminal style and two pendulous ovules, and the
                    fruit a one-seeded drupe.</p>               <p>The torus, forms a cup from the edge of which spring the five sepals, five
                    alternating petals and the ten to indefinite stamens. The plants are deciduous
                    or evergreen trees or shrubs with simple leaves, often</p>               <p>with small caducous stipules, and racemes or umbels of generally showy, white or
                    pink flowers. There are five genera, the chief of which is <hi rend="italic"
                        >Prunus,</hi> to which belong the plum <hi rend="italic">(Prunus

                    through the north temperate zone, passing into the tropics.</p>               <p>                   <hi rend="italic">Suborder VI. Chrysobalanoideae</hi> resembles the last in
                    having a single free carpel and the fruit a drupe, but differs in having the
                    style basal, not terminal, and the ovules ascending, not pendulous; the flowers
                    are also frequently zygomurphic. The 12 genera are tropical evergreen trees or
                    shrubs, the great majority being. South American. The zygomorphic flowers
                    indicate an affinity with the closely allied order Leguminosae.</p>            </div>
