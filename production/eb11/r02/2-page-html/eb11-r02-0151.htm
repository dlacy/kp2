<p><span class="font1">alveolar air that regulates breathing. The pressure exercised by the carbon dioxide in the alveolar air is of course proportional to its percentage, multiplied by the total atmospheric&nbsp;pressure. It follows from this law that at a pressure of&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">6 </span><span class="font1">atmospheres i % of carbon dioxide in the inspired air would&nbsp;have the same violent effect as 6% at the normal pressure of&nbsp;i atmosphere. To take a concrete practical application, if a diver&nbsp;whose head was just below water were supplied with sufficient&nbsp;air to keep the carbon dioxide percentage in the air of his helmet&nbsp;down to 3 % at most, he would be quite comfortable. But if,&nbsp;with the same air supply as measured at surface, he went down&nbsp;to a depth of 170 ft., where the pressure is 6 atmospheres, he&nbsp;would at once experience great distress culminating in loss of&nbsp;consciousness, owing, not to the pressure of the water, which&nbsp;has trifling effects, but to the pressure of carbon dioxide in the&nbsp;air he was breathing. The air supply must be increased in&nbsp;proportion to the increase of pressure if these effects are to be&nbsp;avoided, and ignorance of this has led to the common failure&nbsp;of diving work at considerable depths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The foregoing facts enable us to understand the regulation of breathing under normal conditions. The pressure of carbon&nbsp;dioxide in the alveolar air evidently determines that of the&nbsp;carbon dioxide in the arterial blood, and the latter in its turn&nbsp;determines the carbon dioxide pressure in the respiratory centre,&nbsp;which is very richly supplied with blood. The centre itself is&nbsp;extremely sensitive to the slightest increase or diminution in&nbsp;carbon dioxide pressure; and thus it is that the alveolar carbon&nbsp;dioxide pressure is so important. That the stimulus of carbon&nbsp;dioxide is from the blood and not through nerves is proved by&nbsp;many experiments. The function of the vagus nerves in regulating the breathing is apparently to, as it were, guide the centre&nbsp;in the expenditure of each separate inspiratory or expiratory&nbsp;effort; for as soon as inspiration or expiration is completed the&nbsp;inspiratory or expiratory effort is cut short by impulse proceeding up the vagus nerve, and much waste of muscular work&nbsp;and risk of injury to the lungs is thereby prevented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Under ordinary conditions the regulation of carbon dioxide pressure in the alveolar air ensures at the same time a normal&nbsp;pressure of oxygen, since absorption of oxygen and giving off&nbsp;of carbon dioxide normally run parallel to one another. If,&nbsp;however, air containing abnormally little oxygen is breathed,&nbsp;the normal relation between oxygen and carbon dioxide in the&nbsp;alveolar air is disturbed. A similar state of affairs is brought&nbsp;about by any considerable diminution of atmospheric pressure.&nbsp;Not only does the partial pressure of oxygen in the inspired air&nbsp;fall, but this fall is proportionally much greater in the alveolar&nbsp;air; and the effects of want of oxygen depend on its partial&nbsp;pressure in the alveolar air. It has been known for long that&nbsp;any great deficiency in the proportion of oxygen in the air&nbsp;breathed increases the depth and frequency of the breathing;&nbsp;but this effect is not apparent until the percentage of oxygen&nbsp;or the barometric pressure is reduced by more than a third,&nbsp;which corresponds to a reduction of more than half in the&nbsp;alveolar oxygen pressure. In contrast with this an increase of&nbsp;a fiftieth in the alveolar carbon dioxide pressure has a marked&nbsp;effect on the breathing. Along with the increased breathing&nbsp;caused by deficiency of oxygen there is more or less blueness&nbsp;of the skin and abnormal effects of various kinds, such as partial&nbsp;loss of sensibility, memory and power of thinking. Long&nbsp;exposure often causes headache, nausea, sleeplessness, &amp;c.—&nbsp;a train of symptoms knowrn to mountaineers as “ mountain&nbsp;sickness.” That the primary cause of “ mountain sickness ” is&nbsp;lack of oxygen owing to the low atmospheric pressure there is&nbsp;not the slightest doubt. Lack of oxygen is thus not only an&nbsp;important, but also an abnormal form of stimulus to the respiratory centre, since it is accompanied by quite abnormal&nbsp;symptoms. A further analysis of the special effect of lack of&nbsp;oxygen on the respiratory centre has shown that this effect&nbsp;still depends on the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the&nbsp;alveolar air. The lack of oxygen appears, in fact, to have&nbsp;simply increased the sensitiveness of the centre to carbon&nbsp;dioxide, so that a lower partial pressure of carbon dioxide&nbsp;excites the centre, and the breathing is correspondingly increased.&nbsp;By prolonged forced breathing so much carbon dioxide is washed&nbsp;out of the body that the subsequent apnoea lasts until the&nbsp;oxygen in the alveolar air is nearly exhausted. The subject&nbsp;of the experiment becomes very blue in the face and is partially&nbsp;stupefied by want of oxygen before he has any desire to breathe.&nbsp;The probable explanation of these facts is that want of oxygen&nbsp;does not itself excite the centre, but that some substance—&nbsp;very probably lactic acid, which is known to be formed abundantly&nbsp;—is produced abnormally in the body during exposure to want&nbsp;of oxygen and aids the carbon dioxide in exciting the centre.&nbsp;Itis known that the blood becomes less alkaline at high altitudes,&nbsp;and that acids in general excite the centre. A person on a high&nbsp;mountain thus gets out of breath much more easily than at&nbsp;sea-level. The extra stimulus to the centre during work still&nbsp;comes from the extra carbon dioxide formed, but has a greater&nbsp;effect than usual on the breathing. If the extra stimulus came&nbsp;directly from want of oxygen the person on the mountain would&nbsp;probably turn blueand !Oseconsciousnessontheslightestexertion.&nbsp;By analysing the alveolar air it can be shown that after a time&nbsp;even a height of 5000 to 6000 ft., or a diminution of only a&nbsp;sixth in the barometric pressure, distinctly increases the sensitiveness of the respiratory centre to carbon dioxide, so that there&nbsp;seems to be a slow accumulation of acid in the blood. The&nbsp;effect also passes off very slowly on returning to normal pressure,&nbsp;although the lack of oxygen is at once removed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The blueness of the skin (“ cyanosis ”) produced by lack of oxygen is due to the fact that the haemoglobin of the red&nbsp;corpuscles is imperfectly saturated with oxygen. Haemoglobin which is fully saturated with oxygen has a bright red&nbsp;colour, contrasting with the blue colour which it assumes&nbsp;when deprived of oxygen. According to the existing evidence&nbsp;the saturation of the haemoglobin is practically complete&nbsp;under normal conditions in the lungs, or when thoroughly&nbsp;shaken at the body temperature and normal atmospheric&nbsp;pressure with air of the same composition as normal alveolar&nbsp;air. As the partial pressure of the oxygen in this air falls,&nbsp;however, the saturation of the haemoglobin becomes less&nbsp;and less complete, and the arterial blood assumes a more and&nbsp;more blue tinge, which imparts a blue or leaden colour to&nbsp;the skin, accompanied by the symptoms, already referred to,&nbsp;of lack of oxygen. Normal arteriaI blood in man yields&nbsp;about 19 volumes of physiologically available oxygen for&nbsp;each 100 volumes of blood. Of these 19 volumes about 18 j are&nbsp;loosely combined with the haemoglobin of the red corpuscles,&nbsp;the small remainder being in simple solution in the blood.&nbsp;Venous blood, on the other hand, yields only about 12 volumes.&nbsp;The combination of haemoglobin with oxygen is only stable&nbsp;in the presence of free oxygen at a pressure of about that in&nbsp;normal ah'eolar air. As this pressure falls the compound&nbsp;is progressively dissociated. From this it can be readily&nbsp;understood why the blood loses its oxygen in passing through&nbsp;the tissues, which are constantly absorbing free oxygen, and&nbsp;regains it in the lungs. The marked effects produced by&nbsp;abnormal deficiency in the pressure of oxygen in the alveolar&nbsp;air are also readily intelligible; for even although the arterial&nbsp;blood still contains sufficient oxygen to cover the normal&nbsp;difference between the oxygen content of arterial and that of&nbsp;venous blood, yet this oxygen is given off to the tissues less&nbsp;readily—</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font1"> at a lower pressure, and thus fails to supply their&nbsp;demands completely. It is evident also that in pure air at&nbsp;normal pressure increased ventilation of the lungs does not&nbsp;appreciably increase the supply of oxygen to the blood, whereas&nbsp;in air largely deprived of its oxygen, or at low pressure, the&nbsp;increased alveolar oxygen pressure produced by deep breathing helps greatly in saturating the blood with oxygen, and&nbsp;may thus relieve the symptoms of want of oxygen. Hence&nbsp;it is that the increased sensitiveness of the respiratory centre&nbsp;to carbon dioxide, and consequent increased depth of breathing, at high altitudes compensates to a large extent for deficiency in the oxygen pressure. Addition of carbon dioxide&nbsp;to the inspired air produces exactly the same result.
