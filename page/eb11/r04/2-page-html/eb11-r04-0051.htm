<p><span class="font0">This constitution has always been regarded as a signal proof of the lamentable condition into which jurisprudence had sunk in&nbsp;the beginning of the 5th century. Constantine, a hundred years&nbsp;earlier, had condemned the notes of Ulpian and Paul upon Papinian. There were no longer any living jurists to lay down the law&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(jura condere)</span><span class="font0">; and, if it was to be gathered from the writings of&nbsp;those who were dead, it was perhaps as well that the use of them&nbsp;should be regulated. The Valentinian law proceeded so far in the&nbsp;same direction. It made a selection of the jurisconsults of the&nbsp;past whose works alone were to be allowed to be cited,—Papinian,&nbsp;Paul, Ulpian and Modestine, the four latest patented counsel of&nbsp;any distinction; Gaius, ol authority previously only in the schools,&nbsp;but whose writings were now approved universally, notwithstand*&nbsp;ing that he had never possessed the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">jus respondendi',</span><span class="font0"> and all the&nbsp;earlier jurists whose dicta these five had accepted. But it went yet&nbsp;a step further, for it declared all of them, with the sole exception of&nbsp;Papinian, to be ol the same authority, and degraded the function of&nbsp;the judge in most cases—so far at least as a question of law was concerned—to. the purely arithmetical task of counting up the names&nbsp;which the industry of the advocates on either side had succeeded in&nbsp;adducing in support of these respective contentions. It is probable&nbsp;that, from the days of Hadrian down to Severus Alexander, when&nbsp;the emperor in his council had to frame a rescript or a decree, its tenor&nbsp;would be decided by the vote of the majority; but that was after&nbsp;argument and counter-argument, which must in many cases have&nbsp;modified first impressions. Taking the votes of dead men, who had&nbsp;not heard each other’s reasons for their opinions, was a very different&nbsp;process. It may have been necessary; but it can have been so&nbsp;only because a living jurisprudence had no existence,—because the&nbsp;constructive talent of the earlier Empire had entirely disappeared.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ii. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ante-Jtistinian Collections of Statutes and Jurisprudence,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Of cardinal importance for this period were the collections of imperial constitutions made prior to Justinian. There&nbsp;were three of these, viz. the Gregorian, the Hermogenian&nbsp;and the Theodosian Codes;<sup>@@1</sup> the first two being the work of&nbsp;private hands, though they afterwards received statutory&nbsp;sanction from Theodosius II., the third being due to that&nbsp;emperor himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Codex Gregorianus.—</span><span class="font0">This was a collection of imperial constitutions from Hadrian to Diocletian, made by a certain Gregorius about the&nbsp;end of the 3rd century (a. 295?),who,in Mommsen’s opinion<sup>@@2&nbsp;</sup>was at that time a professor at the law school of Beirut.&nbsp;Only fragments of it have come down to us, obtained&nbsp;chiefly from Alaric’s Breviary, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lex Romana Burgundionum,</span><span class="font0"> the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Consultatio,</span><span class="font0"> the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Collatio</span><span class="font0"> and the Vatican Fragments mentioned below;&nbsp;blit it was a work of considerable size, divided into books and titles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Codex Ilermogenianus<sup>@@3</sup> </span><span class="font0">This, like the Gregorian, was compiled ¡n the Eastern Empire, apparently at the end of the 3rd century,&nbsp;but at any rate not later than the year 324. As, however,&nbsp;it contains a constitution of the year 365 there must have&nbsp;been subsequent additions to it. Only fragmentary remains&nbsp;of it are extant, obtained from the same sources as the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Gregorian. Its author was a certain Hermogenianus (perhaps the jurist of that name cited in the Digest), and the work seems to have&nbsp;been intended as a sort of supplement to the Gregorian Code. It&nbsp;was a smaller work than the latter, being divided only into titles,&nbsp;and, unlike it, contains no pre-Diocletian constitutions. . It has,&nbsp;however, a great number of contemporary ones, issued by Diocletian&nbsp;especially during the years 293 and 294. It was from this work&nbsp;and that of Gregorius that Justinian obtained the constitutions&nbsp;contained in his Code for the period prior to Constantine, and from&nbsp;the language he uses about the two Codes it would seem that they&nbsp;had been regarded in the courts before his time as the only authoritative record of constitutions during the period covered by them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Codex Theodosianus.—</span><span class="font0">In the year 429 the emperor Theodosius nominated a commission of nine persons to collect the constitutions&nbsp;issued by the emperors from Constantine to his own reign.&nbsp;From the term soft he edict appoint! ng them he seems to have&nbsp;intended to initiate the preparation of a body of law which,&nbsp;if his scheme had been carried into execution, would have&nbsp;rendered that of Justinian unnecessary. In a constitution about ten&nbsp;years later he explains the motives that had actuated him: that he&nbsp;saw with concern the poverty-stricken state of jurisprudence and how&nbsp;few men therewerewho, notwithstanding the prizes that awaited them,&nbsp;were able to make themselves familiar with the whole range of law;&nbsp;and that he attributed it very much to the multitude of books and</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">the lar^e mass of statutes through which the law was dispersed, and which it was next to impossible for any ordinary mortal to master.&nbsp;His.scheme was eventually to compile one single code from materials&nbsp;derived alike from the writings of the jurists, the Gregorian and&nbsp;Hermogenian collections of rescripts, and the constitutions from&nbsp;the time of. Constantine downwards. His language leaves little&nbsp;doubt that it was his intention to have this general code carefully&nbsp;prepared, so as to make it a complete exponent of the existing&nbsp;law, which should take the place of everyth ing, statutory or jurisprudential, of an earlier date. The collection 01 constitutions which&nbsp;he directed his commissioners meantime to prepare, and which&nbsp;was to contain even those that were merely of historical interest&nbsp;(provided only it was made clear how later enactments had affected&nbsp;them), was to be the first step in the execution of his project. For&nbsp;some reason or other nothing followed upon this enactment, and in&nbsp;435 a new commission of sixteen persons was nominated to collect&nbsp;the constitutions, but nothing was said in their instructions about&nbsp;anything ulterior. They were directed, however, to deal with their&nbsp;material in a systematic way, as by arranging the constitutions&nbsp;chronologically under definite titles, separating, where necessary,&nbsp;any constitutions dealing with more than one matter into parts,&nbsp;so as to bring each matter under its proper title, and with power&nbsp;otherwise to make such omissions, additions and alterations as&nbsp;seemed good to .them for the same object. The work was completed&nbsp;in less than three years and published at Constantinople early in the&nbsp;yeai 438, with the declaration that it should take effect from the&nbsp;1st of January following, and a copy was sent to Valentinian, who&nbsp;notified it to the senate at Rome and ordained that it should come&nbsp;into force, in the West from the 12th of January 439. The arrangement is in sixteen books, subdivided into titles with rubrics in&nbsp;which the constitutions are as a rule (though not consistently)&nbsp;placed in chronological order. They cover the whole field of law,&nbsp;private and public, civil and criminal, fiscal and administrative,&nbsp;military and ecclesiastical. The private law is contained in the&nbsp;first five books. This code was usually called an later documents&nbsp;“ Theodosianus,’’ without </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">codex</span><span class="font0"> adjected. All constitutions since&nbsp;Constantine not contained in it were abrogated. The manuscripts&nbsp;in which it has come down to us are very defective, but many&nbsp;lacunae have been filled up from other sources, especially from&nbsp;Alaric’s Breviary. Unfortunately the lacunae are principally in&nbsp;the books relating to the private law.<sup>@@4</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Novellae Post-Theodosianae.—</span><span class="font0">The imperial constitutions subsequent to the publication of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Theodosianus</span><span class="font0"> got the name of Novels </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(novellae leges).</span><span class="font0"> There were three collections of these, all&nbsp;made in the Western Empire, and they are generally known&nbsp;as. post-Theodosian Novels. The first collection containing edicts of Theodosius himself, sent by him to&nbsp;Valentinian III. in 447, was published by the latter emperor&nbsp;in the following year. -The second collection contained in addition to&nbsp;edicts of Theodosius some edicts of Marcian and other emperors of&nbsp;the East, and also some of Valentinian, Majorian and other emperors&nbsp;of the West. The third collection was published in abridged form in&nbsp;Alaric's Breviary. These collections are not extant, but from Alaric’s&nbsp;Breviary, with additions from manuscript sources, modern editions&nbsp;of the Novels have been prepared.<sup>@@5 </sup>There was also a collection of&nbsp;constitutions, issued between the years 331 and 425, nearly all relating&nbsp;to church matters, first published by T. Sirmondus in 1631, and now&nbsp;known as the Sirmondian Constitutions.<sup>@@6</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Besides the collections of statutes just mentioned there were a number of juristic works of this period, containing both&nbsp;statute law </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(leges)</span><span class="font0"> and common law </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(jus)</span><span class="font0"> in combination,&nbsp;made by private individuals.
