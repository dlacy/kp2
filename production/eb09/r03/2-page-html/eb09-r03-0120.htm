                diamond dust. The former was&nbsp;obtained largely at Naxos ; diamond-dust drills

        <p><span class="font1">The style of architecture employed in ancient Rome may be said to
                have passed through three stages,—the Etruscan, the Greek, and&nbsp;the Roman.
                During the first few centuries of the existence of the&nbsp;city, both the methods
                of construction and the designs employed&nbsp;appear to have been purely Etruscan.
                The earliest temples were&nbsp;either simple cellæ without columns, as we see on the
                Palatine by&nbsp;the Scalæ Caci, or else, in the case of the grander temples, such
                as&nbsp;that of Capitoline Jupiter, the columns were very widely
                spaced&nbsp;(aræostyle), and consequently had entablatures of wooden beams.&nbsp;The
                architectural decorations were more generally in gilt bronze or&nbsp;painted
                terra-cotta than in stone, and the paintings or statues&nbsp;which decorated the
                buildings were usually the work of Etruscan&nbsp;artists.@@<sup>2</sup> The Greek
                influence is more obvious ; almost all the&nbsp;temples of the earlier imperial age
                are Greek, with certain modifications, not only in general design but in details and
                ornaments.&nbsp;Greek architects were largely employed ; and Roman
                architects&nbsp;such as Vitruvius and C. Mutius in the 1st century b.c.,
                Severus&nbsp;and Celer under Nero, and Rabirius under Domitian were Greek&nbsp;by
                education, and probably studied at Athens (see Vitr., vii., </span><span
                class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Præf. ;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1"

                style="font-style:italic;">Rome,</span><span class="font1"> p. 76).@@<sup>3</sup>
                The&nbsp;Romans, however, though quite devoid of artistic originality,
            were</span></p>

        <p><span class="font1">very able engineers, and this led to the development of a new and
                more purely Roman style, in which the restrictions imposed by the&nbsp;use of the
                stone lintel were put aside and large spaces were covered&nbsp;with vaults and domes
                cast in semifluid concrete, a method which&nbsp;had the enormous advantage of giving
                the arched form without the&nbsp;constant thrust at the springing which makes true
                arches or vaults&nbsp;of wide span so difficult to deal with. The enormous vaults of
                the&nbsp;great thermæ, the basilica of Constantine, and the like cover
                their&nbsp;spaces with one solid mass like a metal lid, giving the form but
                not&nbsp;the principle of the arch, and thus allowing the vault to be set
                on&nbsp;walls which would at once have been thrust apart had they
                been&nbsp;subjected to the immense leverage which a true arched vault constantly
                exerts on its imposts.@@<sup>4</sup> This is a very important point, and&nbsp;one
                which is usually overlooked, mainly owing to the Roman practice of facing their
                concrete with bricks, which (from an examination of the surface only) appear to be a
                principal item in the construction. The walls of the Pantheon, for example, are
                covered&nbsp;with tiers of brick arches, and many theories have been
                invented&nbsp;as to their use in distributing the weight of the walls. But a
                recognition of the fact that these walls are of concrete about 20 feet&nbsp;thick,
                while the brick facing averages scarcely 6 inches in thickness,&nbsp;clearly shows
                that these ‘ ‘ relieving arches ” have no more constructional use as far as concerns
                the pressure than if they were&nbsp;painted on the surface of the walls. Exactly the
                same reasons&nbsp;apply to the superficial use of brick in all arches and
                vaults.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">At first tufa only was used in opus quadratum, as we see in the
                so-called wall of Romulus. Next the harder peperino began to be&nbsp;worked : it is
                used, though sparingly, in the great Servian wall,&nbsp;and during the later
                republic appears to have been largely employed&nbsp;for exterior walls or points
                where there was heavy pressure, while&nbsp;other parts were built of tufa. Thirdly,
                travertine appears to have&nbsp;been introduced about the 2d century B. </span><span
                class="font0">c., </span><span class="font1">but was used at first for&nbsp;merely
                ornamental purposes, very much as marble was under the&nbsp;empire ; after about the
                middle of the 1st century a.d. travertine&nbsp;began to be largely used for the
                solid mass of walls, as in the temple&nbsp;of Vespasian and the</span></p>

                with' the travertine, it was cut so as to range&nbsp;with the irregular courses of
                the latter.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">It is an interesting point to note the manner in which the Roman
                builders mixed their different materials according to the&nbsp;weight they had to
