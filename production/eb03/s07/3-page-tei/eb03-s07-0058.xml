            <p>of Good Hope on the one fide, and from Karrjtſchetka to India and japan on the other.
                It is alſo found in all parts of North America, and in ſeveralof the Weft Indian
                Iſlands. In Europe it diſappears during the winter months. It appears generally a
                little after the vernal equinox ; but rather earlier in the ſouthern, and later in
                the northern latitudes. It adheres to the uſual ſeaſons with much regularity ; for
                though the months of February and^iarch ſhould be uncommonly mild, and April and May
                remarkably cold, it never deviates from its ordinary time. In the cold ſpring of
                '740 ſome appeared in France before the infects on which they feed had become
                numerous enough to iupport them, and great numbers died@@. In the mild and even warm
                ſpring of 1 7 74 they appeared no earlier than uſual. They remain in ſome warm
                countries the whole year. Kolben affures us that this is the cafe at the Cape of
                Good Hope ; but (he lays) they are more numerous in winter. Some birds of this
                ſpecies live, during winter, even in Europe ; for example, on the coaſt of Genoa,
                where they ſpend the ni;?ht in the open country on the orange ſhrubs.</p>
            <p>2. The <hi rend="italic">martins</hi> are alſo widely diffuſed through the old
                continent ; but the countries where they reſide or viſit have not been marked by
                naturaliſts with much attention. 3. The <hi rend="italic">sand martins</hi> are
                found in every part of Europe, and frequently ſpend the winter in Malta@@. Two birds
                of this ſpecies were ſeen in Perigord in France, on the 27th December 1775, when
                there was a ſoutherly wind, attended with a little rain@@. 4. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >ſvaiſt</hi> viſits the whole continent of Europe ; has alſo been obſerved at
                the Cape of Good Hope, and in Carolina in North America. 5. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >goat-ſuckers</hi> are not very common birds, yet are widely ſcattered They are
                found in every country between Sweden and Africa : they are found alſo in India. In
                April the ſouth-weſt wind brings them to Malta, and in autumn they repaſs in great
                numbers.</p>
            <p>Mr Markwick of Catsfield, near Battle in Suffex, has drawn up an accurate table,
                expreſſing the day of the month on which the birds, commonly called <hi
                    rend="italic">migratory,</hi> appeared in ſpring, and diſappeared in autumn, for
                16 years, from 1768 to 1783 incluſive.@@ The obſervations were made at Catsſield. From
                this table we ſhall extract the dates for five years, and add the very few
                obſervations which we have been able to collect reſpecting the time when the ſwallow
                appears and diſappears in other countries.</p>

            <p>Were tables of the ſame kind made in every different country, particularly within the
                torrid zone, it would be eaſy to determine the queſtion which we have been conſi-
                dering. To many, perhaps, it may not appear a matter of ſuch importance as to be
                worth the labour. We acknowledge it to be rather a curious than an important inquiry
                ; yet it is one which muſt be highly gratifying to every mind that can admire the
                wiſdom of the Great Architect of nature. The inſtinct of the ſwallow is indeed
                wonderful : it appears among us juſt at the time wſhen infects become numerous ; and
                it continues with us during the hot weather, in order to prevent them ſrom
                multiplying too much. It diſappears when theſe infects are no longer troubleſomc. It
                is never found in folitude ; it is the friend of man, and always takes up its
                reſidence with us, that it may protect our houſes and our ſtreets ſrom being annoyed
                with ſwarms of flies.</p>

            <p>SWAMMERDAM (John), a celebrated and learned natural philpſopher, was the ſon of John
                James Swammerdam, an apothecary and famous naturaliſt of Amſterdam, and was born in
                1637. His father intended him for the church, and with this view had him inſtructed
                in Latin and Greek ; but he, thinking himſelf unequal to ſo important a taſk,
                prevailed with his father to conſent to his applying himſelf to phyſic. As he was
                kept at home till he ſhould be properly qualified to engage in that ſtudy, he was
                frequently employed in cleaning his father’s curioſities, and putting every thing in
                its proper place. This inſpired our author with an early taſte for natural hiſtory ;
                ſo that, not content with the ſurvey of the curioſities his father had pur- chaſed,
                he ſoon began to make a collection of his own, which he compared with the accounts
                given of them by the beſt writers. When grown up, he ſeriouſly attended to his
                anatomical and medical ſtudies ; yet ſpent part of the day and the night in
                diſcovering, catching, and examining the flying infects proper to thole times, not
                only in the province <hi rend="superscript">, </hi>of Holland, but in thoſe of
                Guelderland and Utrecht.—- Thus initiated in natural hiſtory, he went to the
                univerſity of Leyden in 165Ί ; and in 1663 was admittcd a candidate of phyſic in
                that univerſity. His attention being now engaged by anatomy, he began to conſider
                how the parts of the body, prepared by diſſection, could be preſerved, and kept in
                confiant order for anatomical demonſtration ; and herein he lucceeded, as he had
                done before in his nice contrivances for diſſecting and managing the minuteſt
                infects. Our author afterwards made a journey into France, where he ſpent ſome time
                at Saumur, and wſhere he became acquainted with ſeveral learned men. In 1667 he
                returned to Leyden, and took his degree of Doctor of Phyſic. The next year the grand
                duke of Tuſeany being in Holland in order to fee the curioſities of the country,
                came to view thoſe of our author and his father ; and on this occalion Swammerdam
                made ſome anatomical diſſections of infects in the pre- ſence of that prince, who
                was ſtruck with admiration at our author’s great ſkill in managing them, eſpecially
                at his proving that the future butterfly lay with all its parts neatly folded up in
                a caterpillar, tty actually removing the integuments that covered the former, and
                extricating and exhibiting all its parts, however minute, with incredible ingenuity,
                by means of inſtruments of inconceivable ſineneſs. On this occafion the duke offered
                our author 12,000 florins for his ſhare of the collection, on condition of his
                removing them himſelf into Tuſcany, and coming to live at the court of Florence ;
                but Swammerdam, who hated a court life, declined his highnefs’s propoſal. Tn 1663,
                he publiſh- ed a General Hiſtory of Infects. About this time, his father began to
                take offence at his inconſiderately neglecting the practice of phyſic, which might
                have ſupported him in affluence ; and would neither ſupply him with money nor
                clothes. This reduced him to ſome. difficulties. In 1675 he
                publiſhed his Hiſtory of the Ephemeras ; and his father dying the ſame year,
                left him a fortune ſufficient for his ſup-</p>
