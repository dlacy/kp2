Unfortunately his religious&nbsp;opinions deprived him of his appointments and disqualified&nbsp;him for the rectorship, to which in 1719 he had been re-elected.&nbsp;It is said that the same reason prevented his election to the&nbsp;French Academy, though he was a member of the Academy&nbsp;of Inscriptions. Shortly before his death (14th December&nbsp;1741) he protested publicly against the acceptance of the bull&nbsp;Unigenitus.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">ROLLINAT<sub>9</sub> MAURICE (1853-1903), French poet, was born at Châteauroux in 1853. His father represented Indrein the&nbsp;National Assembly of 1848, and was a friend of George Sand,&nbsp;whose influence is very marked in young RollinatS first&nbsp;volume, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dans les brandes</span><span class="font1"> (1877). The volume, however*&nbsp;attracted little attention, and it was with his second publication, very different in manner, that he made his reputation.&nbsp;In </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Les Névroses,</span><span class="font1"> with the sub-title </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Les Ames, Les Luxures,&nbsp;Les Refuges, Les Spectres, Les Ténèbres,</span><span class="font1"> he showed himself&nbsp;as a disciple of Charles Baudelaire.

<p><span class="font1">ROLLING-MILL<sub>9</sub> a term which includes several types of machines used for producing the sectional forms (fig. 1) in&nbsp;which wrought iron and steel are required for the use of&nbsp;boiler-makers, platers and bridge-builders, and for constructional work generally. The production of wrought iron has&nbsp;been a diminishing industry for many years, while that of&nbsp;steel increases. Though the plant employed for both is alike&nbsp;in essential principles of design, the growth in the use of steel&nbsp;has revolutionized the practice, chiefly on account of the more&nbsp;massive dimensions in which steel sections are rolled. Iron&nbsp;sections are relatively small, and many are produced by piling,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font1"> by building up with small portions of malleable puddled&nbsp;metal. There is no limit in reason to the dimensions in which&nbsp;steel sections can be rolled, and they are never piled, however&nbsp;large, but always rolled from solid cast ingots.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When steel ingots are rolled into sectional forms the reduction in transverse dimensions is very great. The work begins at&nbsp;nearly a white heat, and continues until a low red is reached.&nbsp;Obviously the stresses to which the material is subjected are&nbsp;very severe. For this reason the process of reduction has&nbsp;to be effected very gradually, and especially so in those cases&nbsp;where reduction is being done in two .directions at right angles&nbsp;with each other, as in channel sections (fig. 6) and joist or&nbsp;beam sections (figs. 7 and 8).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It might be thought, since SteeI is always cast previously to rolling, that it might be cast at once into the sectional forms&nbsp;required. But sound results could not be obtained in this&nbsp;way, because the gases occluded in the metal form blow-holes&nbsp;which are sources of weakness. The material itself, even in&nbsp;the solid portions, is not homogeneous. By removing the head&nbsp;of the ingot where the blow-holes chiefly congregate and rolling&nbsp;the remainder at a white or red heat, the metal is improved&nbsp;by consolidation, and by the work done upon it. To this&nbsp;practice there is no exception.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rolling-mills are known as “ two-high,” or “ three-high,*<sup>1 </sup>according as two or three rolls are mounted one over the other</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(figs. 2 and 3). In the two-high type the two rolls revolve in opposite directions, so that an ingot, slab or bloom presented to the entering side is drawn in and between the rolls,&nbsp;which reduce its thickness. In the case of rolls which are&nbsp;two perfectly plain cylinders (plate-rolls) the shape produced&nbsp;is that of broad, long and flat plates or sheets. Several&nbsp;passages (passes) are required to effect the reduction required,&nbsp;because this must be gradual. To regulate the amount the&nbsp;top roll is set down bodily by means of screws pressing on its&nbsp;bearings which slide in the end supports (housings). In the&nbsp;case of plate-rolls, which are plain cylinders, this setting down&nbsp;must be equal at each end. The mass of the top roll is balanced,&nbsp;to avoid shock when a plate is entering. The rolls are made&nbsp;of cast iron, and are either </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">grain</span><span class="font1"> rolls or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chilled</span><span class="font1"> rolls. The&nbsp;first are formed from a tough strong grade of iron, the quality&nbsp;which is used for all the roughing down and general work.&nbsp;The second are made of a highly mottled iron, cast against&nbsp;a cold mould (chill) of cast iron, by which a steely surface is&nbsp;obtained. These are used for fine finishing, or for imparting&nbsp;a polished surface to a section already nearly reduced to size&nbsp;in grain rolls. In later heavier practice, rolls of cast steel&nbsp;and forged steel are becoming common. They are more&nbsp;costly than iron, but more durable and much lighter for equal&nbsp;strength. They are essential in armour plate rolls. The&nbsp;length of rolls should not exceed about four times their diameter,&nbsp;for otherwise they are liable to spring and produce plates&nbsp;thicker at the centre than towards the edges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">From this elementary design several types are derived. In the two-high mill it is clear that if the direction of the&nbsp;rotation of the rolls is always the same, then the plate being&nbsp;rolled must be taken back after each “ pass ” to the front&nbsp;of the rolls. Hence there is one “ lost pass ” for every reduction&nbsp;in thickness. This is the case in the “ pull-over ” mill, nearly&nbsp;obsolete. In the two-high reversing mill, introduced to avoid&nbsp;this “ lost pass,” as soon as a plate has gone through, the&nbsp;direction of rotation of the rolls is reversed, and the plate is&nbsp;rolled again on the backward journey, so avoiding the lost</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
