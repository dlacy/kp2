<p><span class="font0">Perhaps no two men of letters ever lived in closer friendship than Hemsterhuis and Ruhnken during the twenty-three years&nbsp;which passed from Ruhnken’s arrival in the Netherlands in&nbsp;1743 to the death of Hemsterhuis in 1766. A few years made it&nbsp;clear that Ruhnken and Valckenaer were the two pupils of the&nbsp;great master on whom his inheritance must devolve. As his&nbsp;reputation spread, many efforts were made to attract Ruhnken&nbsp;back to Germany, but after settling in Leiden, he only left&nbsp;the country once, when he spent a year in Paris, ransacking&nbsp;the public libraries (1755). For work achieved, this year of&nbsp;Ruhnken may compare even with the famous year which Ritschl&nbsp;spent in Italy. In 1757 Ruhnken was appointed lecturer in&nbsp;Greek, to assist Hemsterhuis, and in 1761 he succeeded Ouden-dorp, with the title of “ ordinary professor of history and eloquence,” but practically as Latin professor. This promotion&nbsp;drew on him the enmity of some native Netherlander, who&nbsp;deemed themselves (not without some show of reason) to possess&nbsp;stronger claims for a chair of Latin. The only defence made by&nbsp;Ruhnken was to publish works on Latin literature which eclipsed&nbsp;and silenced his rivals. In 1766 Valckenaer succeeded Hemsterhuis in the Greek chair. The intimacy between the two&nbsp;colleagues was only broken by Valckenaer’s death in 1785, and&nbsp;stood without strain the test of common candidature for the&nbsp;office (an important one at Leiden) of university librarian, in&nbsp;which Ruhnken was successful. Ruhnken’s later years were&nbsp;clouded by severe domestic misfortune, and by the political&nbsp;commotions which, after the outbreak of the war with England in 1780, troubled the Netherlands without ceasing, and&nbsp;threatened to extinguish the university of Leiden. He died in&nbsp;1798.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Personally, Ruhnken was as far as possible removed from being a recluse or a pedant. He had a well-knit and even handsome frame, attractive manners (though sometimes tinged&nbsp;with irony), and a nature simple and healthy, and open to impressions from all sides. Fond of society, he cared little tp what&nbsp;rank his associates belonged, if they were genuine men in whom&nbsp;he might find something to learn. His biographer even says&nbsp;of him in his early days that he knew how to sacrifice to the&nbsp;Sirens without proving traitor to the Muses. Life in the open&nbsp;air‘had a great attraction for him; he was fond of sport, and&nbsp;would sometimes devote to it two or three days in the week.&nbsp;In his bearing towards other scholars Ruhnken was generous&nbsp;and dignified, distributing literary aid with a free hand, and&nbsp;meeting onslaughts for the most part with a smile. In the&nbsp;records of learning he occupies an important position. He&nbsp;forms a principal link in the chain which connects Bentley with&nbsp;the modern scholarship of the Continent. The spirit and the&nbsp;aims of Hemsterhuis, the great reviver of Continental learning,&nbsp;were committed to his trust, and were faithfully maintained.&nbsp;He greatly widened the circle of those who valued taste and&nbsp;precision in classical scholarship. He powerfully aided the&nbsp;emancipation of Greek studies from theology; nor must it be&nbsp;forgotten that he first in modern times dared to think of rescuing&nbsp;Plato from the hands of the professed philosophers—men presumptuous enough to interpret the ancient sage with little or no&nbsp;knowledge of the language in which he wrote.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Ruhnktn’s principal works are editions of (1) Timaeus’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lexicon of Platonic Words, (2)</span><span class="font0"> Thalelaeus and other Greek commentators&nbsp;on Roman law, (3) Rutilius Lupus and other grammarians,&nbsp;(4) Velleius Paterculus, (5) the works of Muretus? He also occupied&nbsp;himself much with the history of Greek literature, particularly the&nbsp;oratorical literature, with the Homeric hymns, the scholia on Plato&nbsp;and the Greek and Roman grammarians and rhetoricians. A discovery famous in its time was that in the text of the work of Apsines&nbsp;on rhetoric a large piece of a work by Longinus was embedded.&nbsp;Modern views of the writings attributed to Longinus have lessened&nbsp;the interest of this discovery without, lessening its merit. The&nbsp;biography of Ruhnken was written by his great pupil, Wyttenbach,&nbsp;goon after his death.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(J. S. R.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RUHR, a river of Germany, an important right-bank tributary of the lower Rhine. It rises on the north side of the Winter-berg in the Sauerland, at a height of about 2000 ft. above the sea. It first takes a northerly and north-westerly course, and&nbsp;in a deep and well-wooded valley winds past the romantically&nbsp;situated town of Arnsberg. Shortly after reaching Neheim it&nbsp;bends to the south-west, courses through the mining district&nbsp;around Hagen, and receives from the left the waters of the Lenne.&nbsp;Hence in a tortuous course it works its way past Witten, Steele,&nbsp;Kettwig and Mülheim, and, after a course of 142 m., discharges&nbsp;itself into the Rhine at Ruhrort. From this place the Ruhr&nbsp;canal connects it with Duisburg. The river is navigable from&nbsp;Witten downwards (43 m.), by the aid of eleven locks; but&nbsp;navigation is often greatly impeded through dearth of water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RUHRORT, a town of Germany, in the Prussian Rhine province, situated at the junction of the Ruhr and the Rhine, in the midst&nbsp;of a productive coal district, 15 m. N. of Düsseldorf and 12 E.&nbsp;of Crefeld by rail. Ruhrort has the largest river harbour in&nbsp;Europe, with quays extending nearly 5 m. along the river, and&nbsp;it is the principal shipping port for the coal of the Westphalian&nbsp;coalfield, which is despatched in the fleet of steam-tugs and&nbsp;barges belonging to the port. The coal is sent principally to&nbsp;South Germany and the Netherlands. Grain and timber are also&nbsp;exported and iron ore is imported. In 1905 the port was entered&nbsp;and cleared by over 27.000 vessels of 7,418,063 tons. The&nbsp;industries of the town include large iron and steel works, shipbuilding yards and tanneries. Ruhrort has three Evangelical&nbsp;and three Roman Catholic churches, and several schools and&nbsp;public institutions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rurhort is first mentioned in 1379, and obtained civic rights in 1551. Having been in the possession of the counts of La Marek,&nbsp;it passed into that of Brandenburg in 1614. In 1905 it was&nbsp;united with Duisburg and Meiderich to form a single municipality, the joint population being 41,416.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RUIZ, JUAN (c. 1283-c. 1350), Spanish poet, was born probably at Alcala de Henares, and became arch-priest of Hita. Though&nbsp;he draws his physical portrait in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Libro de buen amor,</span><span class="font0"> he gives&nbsp;no exact biographical details. It may be inferred from his&nbsp;writings that he was not an exemplary priest, and one of the&nbsp;manuscript copies of his poems states that he was imprisoned&nbsp;by order of Gil Albornoz, archbishop of Toledo. It is not known&nbsp;whether he was sentenced for his irregularities of conduct, or on&nbsp;account of his satirical reflections on his ecclesiastical superiors.&nbsp;Nor is it possible to fix the precise date of his imprisonment.&nbsp;Albornoz nominally occupied the see of Toledo from 1337 to&nbsp;1368, but he fell into disgrace in 1351 and fled to Avignon.&nbsp;A consideration of these circumstances points to the probable&nbsp;conclusion that Ruiz was in prison from 1337 to 1350, but this is&nbsp;conjecture. What seems established is that he finished the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Libro de buen amor</span><span class="font0"> in 1343 while in gaol, and that he was no&nbsp;longer arch-priest of Hita in January 1351; it is assumed that&nbsp;he died shortly before the latter date.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Ruiz is by far the most eminent poet of medieval Spain. His natural gifts were supplemented by his varied culture; he clearly&nbsp;had a considerable knowledge of colloquial (and perhaps of&nbsp;literary) Arabic; his classical reading was apparently not extensive, but he knew by heart the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Disticha</span><span class="font0"> of Dionysius Cato, and&nbsp;admitsTiis indebtedness to Ovid and to the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">De Amore</span><span class="font0"> ascribed to&nbsp;Pamphilus; his references to Blanchefleur, to Tristan and to&nbsp;Yseult, indicate an acquaintance with French literature, and he&nbsp;utilizes the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">fabliaux</span><span class="font0"> with remarkable deftness; lastly, he adapts&nbsp;fables and apologues from Aesop, from Pedro Alfonso’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Disciplina&nbsp;clericalis,</span><span class="font0"> and from medieval bestiaries. All these heterogeneous&nbsp;materials are fused in the substance of his versified autobiography,&nbsp;into which he intercalates devout songs, parodies of epic or forensic&nbsp;formulae, and lyrical digressions on every aspect of life. Ruiz, in&nbsp;fact, offers a complete picture of picaresque society in Spain during&nbsp;the first half of the 14th century, and his impartial irony lends&nbsp;a deeper tone to his rich colouring. He knows the weaknesses&nbsp;of both clergy and laity, and he dwells with equal complacency&nbsp;on the amorous adventures of great ladies, on the perverse&nbsp;intrigues arranged by demure nuns behind their convent walls,&nbsp;and on the simpler instinctive animalism of country lasses and&nbsp;Moorish dancing-girls. In addition to the faculty of genial&nbsp;observation Ruiz has the gift of creating characters and presenting types of human nature: from his Don Furón is derived</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
