In 1593 he was studying under Peter Breughel, and afterwards he received instruction from Henry van Balen, the first master of Vandyke. He devoted himself to painting flowers, fruit, and subjects of still life, but afterwards turned to animal-painting, and executed with the greatest skill and spirit hunting pieces and combats of wild animals. His composition is rich and varied, his drawing correct and vigorous, his touch bold and thoroughly expressive of the different textures of the furs and skins of the animals represented. His excellence in this department excited the admiration of Rubens, who frequently employed him to paint animals, fruit, and still life in his own pictures, and he assisted Jordaens in a similar manner. In the lion and boar hunts which bear the name of Snyders the hand of Rubens sometimes appears. He was appointed principal painter to the archduke Albert, governor of the Low Countries, for whom he executed some of his finest works. One of these, a Stag-Hunt, was presented to Philip III., who commissioned the artist to paint several subjects of the chase, which are still preserved in Spain. Snyders died at Antwerp in 1657.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
