one of the chief British military cantonments in India, is situated in the native state of Haidarábád (Hyderabad) or the Nizam’s Dominions, in 17° 26' 30" N. lat. and 78° 33' E. long., 1830 feet above the level of the sea, and 6 miles north-east of Haidarábád city. Secunderábád is the largest military station in India and forms the headquarters of the Haidarábád subsidiary</p><p>force, which constitutes a division of the Madras army. The strength of the military force stationed at Secunderábád in 1883 was 5632, European troops numbering 2276 and native troops 3356. To the south-west of the cantonment there is a large reservoir or tank, known as the Husain Ságar, about 3 miles in circumference. Secunderábád town, which forms the cantonment bazaar, contains a population of over 30,000. Adjoining this cantonment to the north is the Boláram cantonment, one of the stations of the Haidarábád contingent, under the immediate command of the nizam ; and 2 miles to the south of Secunderábád cantonment are the lines of the Haidarábád reformed troops, also belonging to the nizam. During the mutiny (1857-58) both the subsidiary force and the Haidarábád contingent rendered good service.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
