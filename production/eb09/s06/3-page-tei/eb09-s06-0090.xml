This had a form very like the ordinary stereoscope, but, instead of lenses in the apertures to which the eyes are directed, it had “a pair of glass prisms having their faces inclined 15° and their refractive angles turned towards each other. . . . A pair of plate-glass prisms, their faces making with each other an angle of 12°, will bring two pictures, the corresponding points of which are 2<hi rend="superscript">1</hi>/<hi rend="subscript">2</hi> inches apart, to coincide at a distance of 12 inches, and a pair with an angle of 15° will occasion coincidence at 8 inches.”@@<hi rend="superscript">1</hi></p><p>The form of stereoscope generally used is that invented by Sir David Brewster, and is known as the refracting stereoscope. The arrangement is shown</p><p>diagrammatically in</p><p>fig. 4. Let the left eye</p><p>be at A and the right</p><p>at B ; let <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> be</p><p>the corresponding pic</p><p>tures for each eye, and</p><p><hi rend="italic">p</hi><hi rend="subscript">1</hi>, <hi rend="italic">p</hi><hi rend="subscript">2</hi>, two prisms of</p><p>glass. A prism refracts</p><p>rays of light so that</p><p>the object seen through</p><p>the prism appears to be</p><p>nearer to the refracting</p><p>edge ; the prism <hi rend="italic">p</hi><hi rend="subscript">1</hi></p><p>therefore refracts the</p><p>ray <hi rend="italic">ap</hi><hi rend="subscript">1</hi> in the direction</p><p><hi rend="italic">p</hi><hi rend="subscript">1</hi>A, as if it proceeded</p><p>from <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> The prism <hi rend="italic">p</hi><hi rend="subscript">2</hi></p><p>refracts the ray <hi rend="italic">bp</hi><hi rend="subscript">2</hi> so</p><p>that to the eye at B it</p><p>also appears to proceed</p><p>from <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> The effect of</p><p>this is that the object</p><p>really appears to be at <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> And as the points <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> combine to form the point <hi rend="italic">c</hi>, so <hi rend="italic">d</hi> and <hi rend="italic">e</hi> unite to form the point <hi rend="italic">f,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">g</hi> and <hi rend="italic">h</hi> to form the point</p><p><hi rend="italic">i</hi> (Weinhold). This</p><p>stereoscope consists</p><p>of a pyramidal box</p><p>blackened inside and</p><p>having a lid for the</p><p>admission of light (fig.</p><p>5). At the narrow</p><p>end of the box are</p><p>two tubes carrying</p><p>the lenses. The tubes</p><p>move up and down to</p><p>suit eyes of different</p><p>focal lengths, and</p><p>sometimes convex or</p><p>concave lenses are in</p><p>serted over the prisms</p><p>to meet the wants of</p><p>long-sighted or short</p><p>sighted persons. Fig. 6</p><p>shows the upper end of</p><p>the stereoscope, with</p><p>the lenses in position.</p><p>A. Stroh (without knowing that H. Grubb</p><p>had described the essentials of the apparatus in 1879) has recently invented a new form of stereoscope based on the well-known effects</p><p>of the persistence of vision. Two stereoscopic pictures are simultaneously projected by two lanterns on a screen so as to overlap, and disks having suitable slits</p><p>are rotated in front of the lan</p><p>terns and also in front of the</p><p>eyes of the observer, in such a</p><p>way that only one picture is</p><p>thrown on the screen at a time,</p><p>and also that the view of the</p><p>picture is seen with the right and left eyes alternately. Further, the connexion between the disks is so arranged that the time of obscuring the view of the observer’s right eye or left eye coincides with the time when the light is shut off from the right or left lantern, and thus the left eye sees the picture of the left lantern and the right eye that of the right lantern. The two eyes never see at the same time, and each eye views its picture after the other, but the impressions come so fast as to be fused in consciousness, and the result is, the image stands out “in solid relief” (<hi rend="italic">Proc. Roy. Soc.,</hi> No. 244, vol. xl., April 1, 1886).</p><p>During his researches into the physiology of vision, Wheatstone was led to study what he termed conversions of relief. Sometimes when we look at a geometrical figure such as a cube or rhomboid it may be imagined to represent one of two dissimilar figures. In fig. 7 the rhomboid AX is drawn so</p><p>that the solid angle A should be seen nearest, and</p><p>solid angle X farthest, and face ABCD foremost,</p><p>while XDC is behind. Look steadily and the posi</p><p>tion will change : X will appear nearest, solid angle</p><p>A farthest ; face ACDB will recede behind XDC.@@<hi rend="superscript">2</hi></p><p>The effects are most obvious when seen with one</p><p>eye, and “no illusion of this kind can take place</p><p>when an object of three dimensions is seen with</p><p>both eyes while the optic axes make a sensible angle</p><p>with each other, because the appearance of two dissimilar figures, one to each eye, prevents the possibility of mistake ” (Wheatstone). The conversion of a cameo into an intaglio and of an intaglio into a cameo is a well-known instance of this illusion. Wheatstone observed the conversion of relief exhibited by binocular pictures in the stereoscope when they are transposed, reflected, or inverted, and this led him to the invention of the <hi rend="italic">Pseudoscope,</hi> an instrιιment which conveys to the mind false perceptions of all external objects. “ Two rectangular prisms of flint glass, the faces of which are 1·2 inch square, are placed in a frame with their hypo- thenuses parallel and 2·1 inches from each other ; each prism has a motion on an axis corresponding with the angle nearest the eyes, that they may be adjusted so that their bases may have any inclination towards each other” (Wheatstone’s <hi rend="italic">Scientific Papers, </hi>p. 275). In fig. 8 there is a diagram of the</p><p>instrument. If a spherical surface be exa</p><p>mined with this instrument, it will appear</p><p>hollow ; whilst a hollow surface will appear</p><p>convex. It is remarkable, however, that</p><p>the converting powers of this instrument</p><p>are greatest where the new forms can be</p><p>conceived without effort. Thus a cameo</p><p>and an intaglio, a plaster cast in relief and</p><p>its mould, or any object similar in its op</p><p>posite reliefs is at once changed by the</p><p>pseudoscope into the converse form. As</p><p>pointed out by Dr Carpenter, by gazing we</p><p>can reverse the interior of a mask so as to</p><p>see the countenance stand out in relief; it</p><p>is more difficult to throw the features of a</p><p>bust into the shape of a mould ; whilst it</p><p>is impossible to effect any conversion upon</p><p>the features of the living face. “ The op</p><p>tical change is identically the same in its</p><p>nature in every one of these cases; and</p><p>there is nothing in the form of the features</p><p>which refuses to present a converse, this</p><p>converted shape being presented by the</p><p>mask ; but the mind, which will admit the</p><p>conception of the converted form when suggested by the inanimate mask or bust, is steeled by its previous experience against the notion that actual flesh and</p><p>blood can undergo such</p><p>a metamorphosis’’(Car</p><p>penter, <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Re</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">view,</hi> 1858, p. 460).</p><p>A little consideration will show that the pictures of objects placed at a great distance from the eye are practically if not wholly identical.
