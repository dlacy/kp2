<p><span class="font1">drawn from the pseudo-annalists, but the influence of Benoît was considerable. Another was the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Troilus</span><span class="font1"> of&nbsp;Albert of Stade (1249), a version of Dares, in verse,&nbsp;brought back to all its severity and affected realism. But&nbsp;these Latin works can only be associated indirectly with&nbsp;Benoît, who had closer imitators in Germany at an early&nbsp;period. Herbort von Fritslar reproduced the French text&nbsp;in his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lied von Troye</span><span class="font1"> (early 13th century), as did also&nbsp;Konrad von Whrtzburg (d. 1287) in his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ruch von Troye&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">of 40,000 verses. To the like source may be traced a&nbsp;poem of 30,000 verses on the same subject by Wolfram&nbsp;von Eschenbach, still unpublished. The Low Countries&nbsp;were not behind Germany. A dozen </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chansons de geste</span><span class="font1"> were&nbsp;translated into Flemish towards the middle of the 13th&nbsp;century ; and Jacob von Maerlant, an illustrious poet, reproduced Benoît, and did not omit to acknowledge the&nbsp;authorship. The fame of the romance travelled to the&nbsp;north, and in various forms the Norse or Icelandic </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tro-jumanna Saga</span><span class="font1"> acquired a distinctly local colour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In Italy Guido delle Colonne, a Sicilian, commenced in 1270 and finished in 1287 a prose </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hi stoma Trojana.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">Although Guido knew some Greek, he did not translate&nbsp;Dictys and Dares, as some MSS. affirm, but reproduced&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Roman de Troie</span><span class="font1"> of Benoît, and so closely as to copy&nbsp;the errors of the latter and to give the name of Peleus&nbsp;to Pelias, Jason’s uncle. As the debt was entirely unacknowledged, Benoît at last came to be considered the&nbsp;imitator of Guido. The original is generally abridged, and&nbsp;the vivacity and poetry of the Anglo-Norman trouvère&nbsp;disappear in a dry version. The immense popularity&nbsp;of Guido’s work is shown by the large number of existing MSS. The French Bibliothèque Nationale possesses&nbsp;eighteen codices of Guido to thirteen of Benoît, while at&nbsp;the British Museum the proportion is ten to two. Guido’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">History</span><span class="font1"> was translated into German about 1392 by Hans&nbsp;Mair of Nördlingen. Two Italian translations, by Antonio&nbsp;Cessi (1324) and by Bellebuoni (1333), are still preserved&nbsp;in MS. at Florence. The book passed the seas, and in the&nbsp;14th and the commencement of the 15th century four versions appeared in England and Scotland. The best known&nbsp;is the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Troy Book</span><span class="font1"> of Lydgate, who had both French and&nbsp;Latin texts before him. An earlier and anonymous rendering exists at Oxford. There is the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Gest Historiale of the&nbsp;Destruction of Troy</span><span class="font1"> (Early Eng. Text Soc., 1869), also an&nbsp;earlier Scottish version by Barbour. The invention of&nbsp;printing gave fresh impetus to the spread of Guido’s work.&nbsp;The first book printed in English was a translation by&nbsp;Caxton from the French of Raoul Lefèvre, issued by the&nbsp;foreign press of Caxton about 1474. Lefèvre’s own version&nbsp;appeared from the same press about the same time and&nbsp;was the first book printed in the French language. There&nbsp;were also translations into Italian, Spanish, High German,&nbsp;Low Saxon, Dutch, and Danish; Guido had even a Flemish&nbsp;and a Bohemian dress. But not one of these translators&nbsp;even suspected that the writer was only a feeble representative of an old trouvère.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Thus far we have only considered works more or less closely imitated from the original. Boccaccio, passing by&nbsp;the earlier tales, took one original incident from Benoît,&nbsp;the love of Troilus and the treachery of Briseida, and composed </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Filostrαto,</span><span class="font1"> a touching story. This was borrowed by&nbsp;Chaucer about 1360 for his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Poke of Troilus and Cresside,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">and also by Shakespeare for his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Troilus and Cressida&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(1609). One reason why the Round Table stories of the&nbsp;12th and 13th centuries had a never-ceasing charm for&nbsp;readers of the two following centuries was that they were&nbsp;constantly being re-edited to suit the changing taste. The&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Roman de Troie</span><span class="font1"> experienced the same fate. By the 13th&nbsp;century it was translated into prose and worked up in&nbsp;those enormous compilations, such as the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mer des Histoires,</span><span class="font1"> &amp;c., in which the Middle Ages studied antiquity.&nbsp;It reappeared in the religious dramas called Mysteries.&nbsp;Jacques Millet, who produced </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">La Destruction de Troie la&nbsp;Grande</span><span class="font1"> between 1452 and 1454, merely added vulgar realism to the original. Writers of chap-books borrowed the&nbsp;story, which is again found on the stage in Antoine de&nbsp;Montchrestien’s tragedy of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hector</span><span class="font1"> (1603)—a last echo of&nbsp;the influence of Benoît.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Although the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Troie</span><span class="font0"> reveals the greatest power of imagination, and was the most influential and important, of these adaptations&nbsp;of ancient classical stories, it was not the earliest of them. It&nbsp;was preceded by a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Roman J Eneas,</span><span class="font0"> written, like the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Roman de Troie,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">by an Anglo Norman at the court of Henry II., a contemporary&nbsp;of Giraldus Cambrensis and John of Salisbury. There is, indeed,&nbsp;every reason to believe that the author was Benoit de Sainte-More&nbsp;himself. The work is a tolerably close reproduction of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Æneid,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">some passages being faithfully translated and others elaborated.&nbsp;But the religious character of Virgil’s work is wanting, as well as&nbsp;the spirit of Roman greatness shadowed forth in the ancient epic.&nbsp;Long extracts from the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Eneas</span><span class="font0"> have been published by M. Pey&nbsp;(Paris, 1856), but it has not yet been printed in full. Soon after&nbsp;its appearance it was translated with great fidelity into German by&nbsp;Heinrich von Veldeke. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Roman de Thebes</span><span class="font0"> is an imitation of&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Thcbais</span><span class="font0"> of Statius, with the same general characteristics as the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Eneas.</span><span class="font0"> In each case the trouvère found a Latin model on which&nbsp;to superimpose an elaborate structure of his own. In each case&nbsp;also the original is abridged, while all polish is effaced, and the&nbsp;pagan marvels replaced by others more familiar to contemporary&nbsp;readers. The change is specially visible in matters of religion.&nbsp;Lydgate translated the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Thebes,</span><span class="font0"> and Chaucer used the romance in&nbsp;his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Canterbury Tales.</span><span class="font0"> It was composed after the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Troie</span><span class="font0"> by another&nbsp;pen than that of Benoit. Lucan’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pharsalia</span><span class="font0"> was the last of the&nbsp;great Roman epics to be appropriated. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Li Romanz de Julius Cesar&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">by Jacques de Forez, of which only one MS. exists, dated 1280, is&nbsp;from this source. It adheres to Lucan’s text with more fidelity&nbsp;than the other adaptations ; but the general intention is changed.&nbsp;While the classic poem ends in the middle of the 10th book, Jacques&nbsp;de Forez conducts Cæsar back to Rome. These romances—</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Eneas,&nbsp;Thebes,</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">J. Cesar—</span><span class="font0">are mere translations, and are, indeed, our&nbsp;first renderings of Virgil, Statius, and Lucan in modern dialects.&nbsp;But the trouvères rearranged and transformed their originals.&nbsp;Fairies, magic, and enchanters, the novel position of women, the&nbsp;sentiments of Christianity, and the spirit of chivalry are strangely&nbsp;at variance with the stories familiar to us in the language of imperial Rome. The influence of new ideas derived from the crusades&nbsp;and the East is plainly visible. Some of the marvels are found in&nbsp;William of Malmesbury, which indicates that they were of popular&nbsp;acceptation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is a remarkable fact that, while the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">origines</span><span class="font0"> of the pseudo-classical romances are earlier than any of the others, the prose recompositions are of later construction than almost all those we are about to consider. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Recueil des Histoires de Troyes, Hercule,&nbsp;Jason, Œdipus, Alexandre, Virgilizis,</span><span class="font0"> &amp;c., belong to the second&nbsp;half of the 15th century. They have little interest and intrinsic&nbsp;merit, but their immediate originals exercised an extraordinary influence on the literature of the Middle Ages, an influence which&nbsp;appears even in the romances of other cycles and in those composed&nbsp;in prose at an earlier date than those we are now discussing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Recueil des Histoires de Troyes</span><span class="font0"> was “composé par vénérable homme Raoul le Feure prestre chappellain de mon très redoubté&nbsp;seigneur monseigneur le duc Phelippe de Bourgoingne en l’an de&nbsp;grace 1461,” but probably printed in 1474 by Caxton or Colard&nbsp;Mansion at Bruges. It is in three books, of which the first deals&nbsp;with the story of Jupiter and Saturn, the origin of the Trojans,&nbsp;the feats of Perseus, and the first achievements of Hercules ; the&nbsp;second book is wholly taken up with the “prouesses du fort&nbsp;Herculez”; the third, “traictant de la generalle destruction de&nbsp;Troyes qui vint a l’ocasion du rauissement de dame Helaine,” is&nbsp;little else than a translation of that portion of Guido delle Colonne&nbsp;which relates to Priam and his sons. Two MSS. of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Recueil</span><span class="font0"> in&nbsp;the Bibliothèque Nationale wrongly attribute the work to Guillaume&nbsp;Fillastre, a voluminous author, and predecessor of Lefèvre as secretary to the duke. Another codex in the same library, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Histoire&nbsp;ancienne de Thèbes et de Troyes,</span><span class="font0"> is partly taken from Orosius.&nbsp;The Bibliothèque Nationale possesses an unpublished </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Histoire des&nbsp;Troyeηs et des Thebains jzιsquia la mort de Tumus, d'après Orose,&nbsp;Ovide et Raoul Lefebre</span><span class="font0"> (early 16th century), and the British Museum&nbsp;a Latin history of Troy dated 1403.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hercules.—</span><span class="font0">The end of the first and the whole of the second book of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Recueil</span><span class="font0"> are reproduced in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Les prouesses et vaillances du&nbsp;preux Hercule</span><span class="font0"> (Paris, 1500), -with the addition of a prologue and&nbsp;the genealogy of the champion. The character and adventures of&nbsp;Hercules were of a nature to attract the fancy of a romancist. His&nbsp;labours are represented as having been performed in honour of a&nbsp;Boeotian princess ; Pluto is a king dwelling in a dismal castle ; the</span></p>
