                Trajan’s&nbsp;ashes were buried in a gold urn under this column (Dion

                completed by Hadrian ; its foundations exist under the buildings&nbsp;at the
                north-east side of the modern piazza, and many of its granite&nbsp;columns have been
                found. This temple is shown on coins of&nbsp;Hadrian.@@<sup>3</sup> The architect of
                this magnificent group of buildings&nbsp;was Apollodorus of Damascus (Dion Cass.,
                Ixix. 4), who also designed many buildings in Rome during Hadrian’s

        <p><span class="font2">Besides the temples mentioned in previous sections remains of many
                others still exist in Rome. The circular temple by the&nbsp;Tiber in the Forum
                Boarium, formerly thought to be that of Vesta,&nbsp;may be the temple of Hercules
                mentioned by AIacrobius </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"

                11), and Livy (x. 23). Its design is&nbsp;similar to that of the temple of Vesta in
                the Forum (fig. 15), and,&nbsp;except the entablature and upper part of the cella,
                which are gone,&nbsp;it is well preserved (see Piale, </span><span class="font2"
                style="font-style:italic;">Tempiodi Vesta,</span><span class="font2"> 1817). The
                neighbouring Ionic temple, popularly called of Fortuna Virilis, is of&nbsp;special
                interest from its early date, probably the end of the 2d&nbsp;century b.c. The
                complete absence of marble and the very&nbsp;sparing use of travertine, combined
                with the simple purity of its&nbsp;design, are all proofs of its great antiquity. It
                has a prostyle&nbsp;tetrastyle portico of travertine, and a short cella of tufa
                with&nbsp;engaged columns ; the bases of these and of the angle columns&nbsp;are of
                travertine. The frieze has reliefs of ox skulls and garlands.&nbsp;The whole was
                originally stuccoed and painted so that the different&nbsp;stones used</span></p>

        <p><span class="font2">softer tufa. The dedication of this temple is doubtful ; on the whole
                it appears most probable that it is the temple to Fortuna (without&nbsp;any affix)

                marble plan. The Porticus Octaviæ,&nbsp;a large rectangular space enclosed by a
                double line of columns, was&nbsp;built in honour of Octavia by her brother Augustus
                on the site of&nbsp;the Porticus AIetelli, founded in 146 b.c. This must not be
                confounded with the neighbouring Porticus Octavia founded by Cn.&nbsp;Octavius, the
                conqueror of Perseus (Liv., xlv. 6, 42), in 168 B.c.,&nbsp;and rebuilt under the
                same name by Augustus, as is recorded in&nbsp;the Ancyræan inscription. The whole
                group was one of the most&nbsp;magnificent in Rome, and contained a large number of
                works of art&nbsp;by Phidias and other Greek sculptors. The existing portico,
                which&nbsp;was the main entrance into the porticus, is a restoration of the

        <p><span class="font2">The temple of Venus Felix and Roma Æterna on the Velia (see fig. 23)

                Greek marble at the ends, and probably&nbsp;twenty at the sides ; it had an outer
                colonnade round the peribolus&nbsp;of about 180 columns of polished granite and
                porphyry. Of these&nbsp;only a few fragments now exist ; for several centuries the
                whole&nbsp;area of this building was used as a quarry, while the residue of
                the&nbsp;marble was burnt into lime on the spot in kilns built of
                broken&nbsp;fragments of the porphyry columns. A considerable part of the&nbsp;two
                cellæ with their apses, set back to back, still exists ; in each&nbsp;apse was a
                colossal seated figure of the deity, and along the side&nbsp;walls of the cellæ were
                rows of porphyry columns and statues in&nbsp;niches. The vault is deeply coffered
                with stucco enrichments once&nbsp;painted and gilt. The roof was covered with tiles
                of gilt bronze,&nbsp;which were taken by Pope Honorius I. (625-638) to cover
                the&nbsp;basilica of St Peter’s. These were stolen by the Saracens during&nbsp;their
                sack of the Leonine city in 846. The emperor Hadrian himself designed this
