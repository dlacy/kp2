<p><span class="font0">were at this juncture governed by females ; the East by Pulcheria, in the name of her brother Theodosius II., and&nbsp;the West by Placidia, in the name of her son Valentinian&nbsp;III.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">While Rome was assailed on all sides by fierce barbarian nations, it was extremely necessary that either the sceptre&nbsp;should be swayed by a warlike monarch, or that men of&nbsp;military talents should occupy the chief places of trust and&nbsp;influence. The western empire was governed by a woman&nbsp;in the name of an infant ; but there were two men at the&nbsp;head of its armies equal to the burden of its support and&nbsp;defence, had they not been rendered foes by jealousy and&nbsp;intrigue. These were Bonifacius in Africa, and Ætius in&nbsp;Italy, both men of great abilities, but the latter envious and&nbsp;designing. In order to ruin his less cunning rival, Ætius&nbsp;wrote to Bonifacius to inform him that the empress Placidia wished his death, and meant to recall him from Africa&nbsp;for that purpose ; and at the same time he persuaded Placidia that Bonifacius meant to rebel, and advised her to recall him for the purpose of proving his obedience. When&nbsp;the order reached Bonifacius, it confirmed the fallacious&nbsp;statement of Ætius, and he refused to return ; this refusal&nbsp;convinced Placidia of his traitorous design, and she caused&nbsp;him to be proclaimed a traitor, thus driving him into rebellion. Bonifacius was well aware that he could not hope&nbsp;to contend successfully against the veteran troops of Rome,&nbsp;led by Ætius ; and he therefore had recourse to the aid of&nbsp;Genseric, king of the Vandals, at that time settled in Spain.&nbsp;This ambitious and daring barbarian immediately crossed&nbsp;the straits of Gibraltar, entered Africa, and commenced ε&nbsp;course of dreadful devastation. Bonifacius learned, when&nbsp;too late, how he had been deceived ; and he then attempted,&nbsp;but in vain, to check the progress of the savage invaders.&nbsp;He was defeated, the cities that opposed the Vandals were&nbsp;taken, and Africa was wrested from the power of Rome,&nbsp;and completely overrun by the barbarians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As the innocence of Bonifacius had been proved by the deceitful letters of Ætius, he was received on his return to&nbsp;Italy, with marks of favour by the empress. This roused&nbsp;the utmost wrath of Ætius, and a sort of civil war arose between the two rivals, in which Bonifacius was slain ; but&nbsp;the empress, who was now thoroughly acquainted with the&nbsp;treachery of Ætius, proclaimed him a traitor, and he fled&nbsp;to the Huns, with whom he had maintained a secret alliance. In a short time afterwards he returned to Italy, requesting re-admission to the councils of the empire, and&nbsp;supported in his requests by an army of sixty thousand barbarians. Placidia was obliged to accept his proffered assistance, to raise him to the dignity of a patrician, and to&nbsp;the command of the imperial armies, and consequently to&nbsp;the government of the empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">No sooner had Ætius secured this object of his ambition, than he resolved to recover the lost province of Africa ; and&nbsp;for this purpose, availing himself of the indignation which&nbsp;.he cruel and barbarous treatment of his sister by Genseric&nbsp;had excited in the mind of Theodoric, king of the Visigoths, he endeavoured to frame such a treaty with that monarch as should induce him to aid the Romans against the&nbsp;common foe. This politic design was however discovered&nbsp;by the crafty barbarian, Genseric, who defeated it by inducing the terrible Attila, king ofthe Huns, to invade the&nbsp;empire. For some time this powerful barbarian had ruled&nbsp;with despotic sway over the whole nation of the Huns, and&nbsp;kept both the courts of Rome and Constantinople in terror,&nbsp;levying a tribute from each, as the price of his temporary&nbsp;forbearance. The death of Theodosius II., and the accession of Marcian, the nominal husband of Pulcheria, infused&nbsp;a more determined spirit into the councils of the eastern&nbsp;empire ; and the fury of Attila might have been directed&nbsp;against it, rather than the west, had it not been for the intrigues of Genseric, who induced the fierce king of the</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">Huns to bend his course westward, and pour the torrent of his almost countless multitudes through Germany into&nbsp;Gaul. The haughty barbarian had also another pretext.&nbsp;The princess Honoria, daughter of Valentinian, is said to&nbsp;have offered him her hand ; and Attila, availing himself of&nbsp;the proffer, demanded her in marriage, together with a portion of the empire as her dowry, and advanced at the head&nbsp;of an immense army to enforce his demands. All opposition was in vain, till he reached Orleans in Gaul, which&nbsp;sustained a siege for some time, in the hope of succour from&nbsp;the confiderate forces of Ætius and Theodoric. At length&nbsp;the allied army appeared, when the Huns were actually&nbsp;forcing their way into the town, and Attila called them back,&nbsp;and retired into the plains around Chalons, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(in campis Cαtα∙&nbsp;launicis,)</span><span class="font0"> to obtain space for the evolutions of his mighty&nbsp;army. After a battle, fierce, varied, obstinate, and bloody,&nbsp;in which the nations from the Wolga to the Atlantic were&nbsp;engaged, Attila was beaten back to his camp, and the field,&nbsp;covered with the dead bodies of 162,000 slain, remained in&nbsp;the possession of Ætius, Theodoric having fallen in the&nbsp;battle. Attila retreated into Germany, still too formidable&nbsp;to be more than harassed on his march.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">During the following spring, he renewed his attempt, but now directed his course into Italy itself, and laid siege to&nbsp;Aquileia, which he took after a protracted and desperate&nbsp;resistance. Ætius could not induce the Visigoths to render him any assistance, and his own forces were unable to&nbsp;meet the vast armies ofthe Huns ; yet he continued to keep&nbsp;the field, and to impede the progress of the dreadful invader. His march was now to be directed against Rome,&nbsp;when he was prevented, partly by the offers of an embassy&nbsp;sent to him from the timid Valentinian, and partly in consequence of a superstitious feeling of apprehension for his&nbsp;own life, both friends and foes reminding him that Alaric&nbsp;had not long survived the taking of Rome. He consented&nbsp;to accept a large ransom and the princess Honoria, threatening to return filled with implacable vengeance, should the&nbsp;stipulations of the treaty not be fulfilled. Soon after his&nbsp;return to his almost imperial village, he fell a victim to intemperance, and died by the bursting of a blood-vessel, on&nbsp;the night after a feast held in honour of his own nuptial&nbsp;engagement with the fair Ildico. Thus perished the terrible Attila, a man of matchless energy of character, a barbarian surpassing all in the barbaric pride and cruelty in&nbsp;which he delighted ; who directed his ambassadors to say&nbsp;to the two emperors of Constantinople and Rome, “ Attila,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">my</span><span class="font0"> lord, and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">thy</span><span class="font0"> lord, commands thee to provide a palace&nbsp;for his immediate reception ;” who delighted in uttering the&nbsp;ferocious boast, that the grass never more grew on the spot&nbsp;once trodden by his horse ; and who actually adopted the&nbsp;appellation given to him by a trembling enemy, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Attila, the&nbsp;scourge of God</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Upon the death of Attila, the kingdom of the Huns was tom to pieces among his followers ; and Rome might have&nbsp;enjoyed safety, had not the jealousy and ingratitude of Valentinian led him to murder with his own hand the brave&nbsp;Ætius, the only person capable of protecting the empire.&nbsp;Not long afterwards, Valentinian himself was killed by the&nbsp;patrician Maximus, whose wife the weak and dissolute tyrant had violated, and who ascended tlle throne thus rendered vacant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Soon after his assumption of the imperial dignity, the wife of Maximus dicd ; and wishing to obtain a sanction for&nbsp;his elevation, he married Eudoxia, the widow of Valentinian, and sister of the eastern emperor. In some moment of&nbsp;strange imprudence, he told tlle empress that he had caused the murder of her first husband Valentinian ; and to&nbsp;revenge the deed, she privately invited Genseric, the Vandal conqueror of Africa, to invade Italy, and dethrone the&nbsp;usurper. Genseric had built and equipped a powerful fleet,&nbsp;which rendered him master of the sea, and put it in his</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
