<p><label>ROBERT</label>
bruce, king of Scotland, in 1306 ; ä renowned general, and the deliverer of his country from a ſtate of vaſſalage to the Engliſh. See Scotland.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Robert, king of France, ſurnamed the Wiſe and the Pious, came to the crown in 996, aſtet the death of Hugh Capet his father. He was crowned at Orleans, the place of his nativity, and afterwards at Rheims, after the impriſonment of Charles of Lorraine. He married Bertha his couſin, daughter of Conrad king of Burgundy ; but the marriage was declared null by Gregory V. ; and the king, if we can give credit to cardinal Peter Damien, was excommunicated. This anathema made ſuch a noiſe in France, that all the king’s courteſans, and even his very domeſtics, went away from him. Only two continued with him ; who were ſo deeply impreſſed with a ſenſe of horror at whatever the king touched, that they purified it with fire : this ſcruple they carried ſo ſar, as to the very plates on which he was ſerved with his meat, and the veſſels out of which he drank. The ſame cardinal reports, that as a puniſh-ment for this pretended inceſt, the queen was delivered of a monſter, which had the head and neck of a duck He adds, that Robert was ſo ſtruck with aſtoniſhment at this ſpecies of prodigy, that he lived apart from the queen. He contracted a ſecond marriage with Confiance, daughter of λVilliam count of Arles and Provence ; but the arrogant diſpoſition of this princeſs would have totally overturned the kingdom, and thrown it into confuſion, had not the wiſdom of the king prevented her from intermeddling with the affairs of the ſtate. He carefully concealed from her whatever acts of liberality he ſhowed to any of his domeſtics. “ Take care (ſaid he to them) that the queen don’t perceive it.”— Henry duke of Burgundy, brother of Hugh Capet, dying in 1002, without lawful iſſue, leſt his dukedom to his nephew the king of France. Robert in-veiled his ſecond ſon Henry with this dukedom, who afterwards coming to the crown, reſigned it in favour of Robert his cadet. This duke Robert was chief ot the firſt royal branch of the dukes of Burgundy, who fiouriſhed till 1361. This dukedom was then re united to the crown by king John, who gave it to his fourth ſon Philip the Bold, chief of the ſecond houſe of Burgundy, wl√dι was terminated in the perſon of Charles the Raih, who was ſlain in ∣477. King Robert was ſo much tſteemed for his wiſdom and nrudence, that</hi></p>

<p>he was offered the empire and kingdom of Italy, which, however, h.e declined to acςept. Hugh, called the <hi rend="italic">Great,</hi> whom he had had by Confiance, being dead, he cauſed his ſecond ſon Henry I. to be crowned at Rheims. He died at. Melun, July 20. 103i, at the age of 60. Robert was, according to the knowledge of the times, a wiſe prince. Helgand, friar of Fleury, relates, in his life of him, that, to prevent his ſubjects from falling into the crime of perjuιy, and incurring the penalties which followed thereon, he made them ſwear upon a ſhrine ſrom which the relics had been previouſly removed, as if intention did not conſtitute perjury ! and long after ſimilar reafoning was adopted. Robert built a gſeat number of churches, and procured a reſtitution to the clergy of the tithes and wealth which the lay-lords had made themſelves maſters of. The depredations were ſuch, that the laity poſſeſſed the eccleſiaſti-cal treaſurcs by hereditary titles ; they divided them among their children ; they even gave benefices as a dowry with their daughters, or leſt them to their foils as lawful inheritance. Although Robert was pious, and although he reſpected the clergy, yet it was evident that he oppoſed the biſhops with a firmneſs and reſolution of which, for many ages, they had had no examples. Lutherie archbiſhop of Sens had introduced into his dioceſe the cuſtom of proving by the euchariſt perſons accuſed as guilty of any crime. The king wrote to him in the following ſtrong terms : “ I ſwear (ſays he)'by the ſaith I owe to God, that if you do not put a ſtop to the groſs abuſe complained of, you ſhall be deprived of your prieſthood.” The prelate was forced to comply. He puniſhed, in j022, the Manichéens, canons of Oιleans, by burning them at the ſtake. There are, however, recorded of him ſome leſs ſevere actions, which it is right to mention. A dangerous conſpiracy againſt his perſon and government having been diſcovered, and the authors taken into cuſtody, he ſeized the moment when their judges had met to ſentcnce them to death, to cauſe an elegant iepaſt to be ſerved up to them. Next day they were admitted to the euchariſt. Then Robert told them, that he gave them their pardon, “ becauſe none of thoſe can die whom Jeſiis Chrill came to receive at his table ” One day when he was at prayers in the chapel, he perceived a thief, who had cut off the half of the fringe of his mantle, proceeding to take the remainder ; “ Friend (ſays he with a pleaſant countenance), be content with what you have already taken, the reſt will very well ſerve ſome other.” Robert cultivated, and was a patronizer of the ſciences. There are ſeveral hymns wrote by him, which ſtill continue to be ſung in the church. His reign was happy and tranquil. According to ſome authors, he inſtituted the order of the Star, commonly attributed to king John.</p><p><hi rend="italic">ROBERT of France,</hi> ſecond ſon of Louis VIII. and brother to St Louis, who erected in his favour Artois into a royal peerage in the year 1 237. It was during this time that the unlucky difference between pope Gregory IX. and the emperor Frederic II. took place. Gregory offered to St Louis the empire for Robert ; but the French nobleſſe, having met to deliberate on this propoſal, were of opinion that he ought to reject it. He gave the pope for anſwer : “ That Count Robert eſteemed himſelf ſufficiently honoured by being the brother of a king, who ſurpaſſed in dignity, in</p><p>ſtrength, in wealth, and in birth, all other monarch <hi rend="sup">1</hi> : in the world.” Robert accompanied St Louis into Egypt, and fought with more bravery than prudence at the battle of Maſſourc, on the 9th of February 12 ;o. In his purſuit of the cowards through a certain ſmall village, he was killed by ſtones, ſticks, and other things which they threw at him from the windows. He was an intrepid prince, but too paſſionate, dogmatical, and quarrelſome.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Robert</hi> II. <hi rend="italic">Count of Artois,</hi> ſon of the preceding, ſurnamed the G ood and the Noble, was at the expedition into Africa in 1270. He drove the rebels from Navarre in 1276. He brought a very powerful aſſiſt-ance to Charles I. king of Naples, of which kingdom he was regent during the captivity of Charles II. He defeated the Arragonians in Sicily in 1289, the Engliſh near Bayonne in 1296, and the Flemi.* at Fumes in 1298. But having in 1302 imprudently attempted to force theſe laſt, when encamped near Courtray, he received no leſs than 30 wounds ; and in that expedition loſt both his honour and his life. He was a brave, but paſſionate and fierce man, and good at nothing but pu-gililtic encounters. Mahaud his .daughter inherited the dukedom of Artois, and gave herſelf in marriage to Otho duke of Burgundy, by whom ſhe had two daughters, Jane wife of Philip the Long, and Blanche wife of Charles the Fair. Iu the mean time Philip, ſon of Robert II. had a ſon,</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Robep.t</hi> III. who diſputed the dukedom of Artois with Mahaud his aunt; but he loſt his fuit by two ſentences given in againſt him in 1302 and 1318. He wiſhed to revive the proceſs in 1329, under Philip of Valois, by means of pretended new titles, which were found to be falſe. Robert was condemned the third time, and baniſhed the kingdom in 133 1. Having found an aſylum with Edward III. king of England, he undertook to declare him king of France ; which proved the cauſe of thoſe long and cruel wars which diſtreſſed that kingdom. Robert was wounded at the ſiege of Vannes in 134.2, and died of his wound in England. John, ſon to Robert, and count of. Eu, was. taken priſoner at the battle of Poitiers in. 1356, and terminated his career in 1387. His ſon Philip If. high conſtable of France, carried on war in Africa and Hungary, and died in 1397, being a. priſoner of the Turks. He had a ſon named <hi rend="italic">Charles,</hi> who died in 1472, leaving no iſſue.</p><p><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="smallcaps"> Robert of Anjou,</hi></hi> ſurnamed the Wiſe, third ſon of Charles the Lame, ſucceeded his father in the kingdom of Naples in 1309, by the protection of the popes, and the will of the people, to the excluſion of Charobert ſon of his eldeſt brother. He aided the Roman pontiffs againſt the emperor Henry VII. and, after the death of that prince, was nominated in 1313 vicar of the empire in Italy, in temporal matters, unleſs a new emperor was elected. This title was given him by Clement V. in virtue of a right which he pretended to have to govern the empire during an interregnum. Robert reigned with glory 33 years, eight months, and died on the 19th of January 1343, aged 64. “ This</p><p>prince (ſays M. De Montigni) had not thoſe qualities which conſtitute heroes, but he had thoſe which make good kings. He was religious, affable, generous, kind, wiſe, prudent, and a zealous promoter of juſtice.” He was called the <hi rend="italic">Solomon</hi> of his age. He loved the poor,</p>

He uſed to ſay, that he would rather renounce his crown than his ſtudy. His court ſoon became the ſanctuary of the ſciences, which he encouraged equally by his example and his bounty. This prince was verſed in theology, juriſprudence, philoſo-phy, mathematics, and medicine. Bocace ſays, “ that ſince the days of Solomon we have not ſeen ſo wiſe a prince upon the throne.” For a great part of his life he had no taſte for poetry; he even deſpiſed it, as, in his opinion, unworthy of a man of learning. A con-verſation which he had with Petrarch, however, undeceived him ; he retained this poet at his court, and attempted himſelf to write ſome poems, which are ſtill extant. He was forced to engage a little in war, for which he poſſeſſed no great talents : alluding to which, may be ſeen on his tomb a wolf and a lamb drinking ôut of the ſame veſſd. Philip of Valois refrained from giving battle in 1339, by the repeated advice which this prince gave him, who was a great friend to France, both from inclination and intereſt. He deteſted quarrels among Chriſtian princes, and had ſtudied the ſci-ence of aſtrology, not ſo much to know the courſe of the ſtars, as to learn by this chimerical ſcience the hidden things of futurity. He believed that he read in the grand book of heaven a very great misfortune which would befal France if Philip hazarded a battle againſt the Engliſh.</p><p><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="smallcaps"> Robert the Firfl,</hi></hi> called the Magnificent, duke of</p><p>Normandy, ſecond ſon of Richard II. ſucceeded in 1 208 his brother Richard III. whom it is reported he poiſoned. He had early in his reign to ſuppreſs frequent rebellions of ſeveral of the great vaſſals. He re-eſtabliſhed in his eſtates Baudouin IV. count of Flanders, who had been unjuſtly ſtript of his poſſeſſions by his own ſon. He forced Canute king of Denmark, who was alſo king of England, to divide his poſſeſſions with his couſins Alfred and Edward. In the year 1035, he undertook barefooted a journey to the Holy Land ; on his return from which he died, being' poiſoned at Nice inBithynia, leaving as his ſucceſſor William his natural ſon, afterwards king of England, whom he had cauſed before his departure to be publicly acknowledged in an aſſembly of the ſtates of Normandy.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Robert,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Rupert,</hi> ſurnamed the Short and the</p><p>Mild, elector Palatine, ſon of Robert the Niggardly, was born in 1352, and elected emperor of Germany in 14co, after the depoſition of the cruel Wenceſlas. In order to gain the affection of the Germans, he wiſhed to reſtore Milanès to the empire, which Wenceſlas had taken from it ; but his attempts in this reſpect were unſucceſsful. His attachment to the anti-pope Gre-gory XII. entirely alienated the affections of the German princes. To ſuch a degree were they incenſed againſt him, that they entered into a conſpiracy to cut him off; but his death, which happened on the 18th of May 1410, being then 58 years old, put a ſtop to their machinations. Robert began to ſettle the ſovereignty of the German princes. The emperors had formerly retained in their own hands the power of life and death, within the territories of a great many of the nobles ; but he yielded them this right by his letters patent.— The chief fault imputed to this prince was an exceſs of</p><p>lenity. But, if we conſider the plots which he had to detect, the conſpiracies which he had to fruſtrate, the ſecret and powerful enemies he had to deal with ; if we inquire alſo into the commotions which the wicked ad-miniſtration of Wenceſlas had excited, the irruptions and devaſtations of plunderers and highway robbers, which the nobles countenanced, and the diſtreſſed ſituation in which he found Germany, we muſt without heſitation conclude, that his lenity indicated his prudence, in reſtoring by (low degrees the empire to its original tranquillity. Robert had his virtues, he loved his ſubjects, and governed them with wiſdom. Poſſeſſed of much political knowledge for the age in which he lived, he wanted nothing but talents for war to make him an accompliſhed prince. He was twice married. The name and rank of his firſt wiſe is unknown ; he had by her a fon, who died before him. His ſecond wife was Elizabeth, daughter of Frederic burgrave of Nuremberg, by whom he had five ſons and three daughters. The three daughters were, Margaret married to Charles duke of Lorrain ; Agnes to Adolphus duke of Cleves ; Elizabeth to Frederic duke of Auſtria. His ſons were, Louis the firſt of the electoral branch, which became extinct in 1559; John father of Chriſtopher king of Denmark ; Frederic who died without iſſue ; Otho count of Sintſheim ; laſtly, Stephen, from whom deſeended the elector, and the other counts palatine of the Rhine, who are extant at this day.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Robert</hi> (of Bavaria), prince palatine of the Rhine, and duke of Cumberland, the ſon of Frederic, elector palatine, by Elizabeth, daughter of James I. king of England, diſtinguiſhed himſelf by his valour as a general and admiral; firſt in the Dutch, and. then in the Engliſh ſervice. He was unſucceſsful in the cauſe of his uncle Charles I. againſt the parliament forces; but under Charles II. he defeated the Dutch fleet, and was made lord high admiral of England in 1673. This prince was a lover of the ſciences, and particularly ſkilful in chemiſtry. He died in 1682.</p>
