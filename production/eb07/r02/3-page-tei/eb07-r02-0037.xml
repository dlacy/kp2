The velocity of this element is √2G*, or √2G × <hi rend="italic">x^.</hi>  The discharge from it is <hi rend="italic">l</hi>  √2Ga^ da·, and the integral of this differential or D = <hi rend="italic">∕I</hi>√2G <hi rend="italic">x<hi rend="sup">ι</hi></hi>  d∙r</p><p>= ½Z√2G a-; +C. To determine the constant quantity C, observe that Du Buat found by experiment that 1F was in all cases ½ BF. Therefore D must be nothing when a∙ = ½Aj consequently C = — ½Z√2G(<hi rend="sub">i</hi>y)^, and the complete integral will be D =∣Z√2G [-J —</p><p>Now make <hi rend="italic">x — h,</hi>  and we have D=½Z√2G [A<hi rend="sup">i</hi>-(^)*] =⅝Z^2G [l-(½)<hi rend="sup">ι</hi>J A’.</p><p>But 1 —(½)<hi rend="sup">i</hi> = 0-64645, and § of this is 0∙43L Therefore, finally, D = 0∙43l Z √2G A<hi rend="sup">1</hi>.</p><p>If we now put 26∙49 or 26½ for √2G, or the velocity with which a head of water of one inch will impel the water over a weir, and multiply this by 0∙43l, we get the following quantity, 11-4172, or, in numbers of easy recollection, ll½, for the cubic inches of water per second, which runs over every inch of a wasteboard when the edge of it is one inch below the surface of the reservoir ; and this must be multiplied by A’, or by the square root of the cube of the head of water. Thus, let the edge of the wasteboard be four inches below the surface of the water. The cube of this is 64, of which the square root is eight. Therefore a wasteboard of this depth under the surface, and three feet long, will discharge every second 8 × 36 X 11½ cubic inches of water, or 1⅛ cubic feet, English measure.</p><p>The following comparisons will show how much this theory may be depended on. The first column shows the depth of the edge of the board under the surface, the second shows the discharge by theory, and the third the discharge actually observed. The length of the board was l8∙4 inches. The numbers in Du Buat’s experiments are here reduced to English measure.</p><p>D. D. Tlιeor. D.

The correspondence is undoubtedly very great. The greatest error is in the first, which may be attributed to a much smaller lateral contraction under so small a head of water.</p><p>But it must be remarked, that the calculation proceeds on two suppositions. The height FI is supposed ½ of BI ; and 2G is supposed 702. It is evident, that by increasing the one and diminishing the other, nearly the same answers may be produced, unless much greater variations of A be examined. Both of these quantities are matters of considerable uncertainty, particularly the first ; and it must be farther remarked, that this was not measured, but deduced from the uniformity of the experiments. We presume that Du Buat tried various values of G, till he found one which gave the <hi rend="italic">ratios</hi>  of discharge which he observed. We beg leave to observe, that in a set of numerous experiments which we had access to examine, BI was uniformly much less than ½ ; it was very nearly £ ; and the quantitv discharged was greater than what would result from Du Buat’s calculation. It was further observed that IF depended very much on the form of the wasteboard. When it was a very thin board of considerable depth, IF was very considerably greater than if the board was thick, or narrow, and set on the top of a broad dam-head, as in fig. 21.</p><p>It may be proper to give the formula a form which will correspond to any ratio which experience may discover between BF and IF. Thus, let IF be — BF. The formula</p><p><hi rend="italic">n</hi></p><p>will be D = ⅞ Z √2G (l —    <hi rend="sup">5</hi>)∕Λ</p><p>Meantime this theory of Du Buat is of great value to the practical engineer, who at present must content himself with a very vague conjecture, or take the calculation of the erroneous theory of Guglielmini. By that theory, the board of three feet, at the depth of four inches, should discharge nearly 3 J<hi rend="sub">j</hi> cubic feet per second, which is almost double of what it really delivers.</p><p>We presume, therefore, that the following table will be acceptable to practical engineers, who are not familiar with such computations. It contains, in the first column, the depth in English inches from the surface of the stagnant water of a reservoir to the edge of the wasteboard. The second column is the cubic feet of water discharged in a minute by every inch of the wasteboard.</p><p>Depth. Discharge.    Depth.

The following method is exact.</p><p>If they be odd quarters of an inch, look in the table for as many inches as the depth contains quarters, and take the eighth part of the answer. Thus, for 3¼ inches, take the eighth part of 23-419, which corresponds to 15 inches. This is 2-927.</p><p>If the wasteboard is not on the face of a dam, but in a running stream, we must augment the discharge by multiplying the section by the velocity of the stream. But this correction can seldom occur in practice ; because in this case the discharge is previously known, and it is A that we want, which is the object of the next problem.</p><p>We only beg leave to add, that the experiments which we mention as having been already made in this country, give a result somewhat greater than this table, viz. about</p><p>à. Therefore, having obtained the answer by this table, d to it its 16th part, and we apprehend that it will be extremely near the truth.</p><p>When, on the other hand, we know the discharge over a wasteboard, we can tell the depth of its edge under the surface of the stagnant water of the reservoir, because we have A = (∩τy) * <hi rend="sup">vel</hi>7 nearly.</p><p>We are now in a condition to solve the problem respecting a weir across a river.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Prob.
