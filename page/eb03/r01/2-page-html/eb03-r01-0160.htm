The gods themſelves and the&nbsp;fouls of men were in this fyſtem only modifications of&nbsp;matter (f). Man was compoſed of their four elements,&nbsp;Fire, Air, water, and Earth ; and upon diffolution,&nbsp;every part returned to the element from which it had&nbsp;come, as the water of a veffel ſwimming in the ſea&nbsp;unites with the ocean when the veffel is broken. This&nbsp;fyftem, it is plain, cannct poſſibly admit of any ſeparate&nbsp;confciouſneſs of exiſtence (c). The ſame may be&nbsp;foid of the ſyſtems of Deιnocrates and Epicurus, and all&nbsp;thoſe who undertook to explain things upon physical&nbsp;principles (∏)∙ The chief merit of the phyfical ſyſtems appears to be this : Abſurd as they were, it&nbsp;would ſeem from the whimſical and the almoſt childiſh&nbsp;reafoning of Lucretius, that they had a tendency to&nbsp;lead mankind ſrom extravagant hypotheſes to ſomething that was ſimilar to obſervation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">what Ariſtotle thought of the ſeparate exiſtence of the ſoul after death is not very certain. The ſoul lie&nbsp;calls an Ev7sλe^s∣α ; and if the reader can divine the meaning of the word, he perhaps can divine the meaning of&nbsp;the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Stagy rite,</span><span class="font2"> and will then be a better diviner than we.&nbsp;At other times he fays, that the ſoul is ſomething divine ; that it reſembles the element of the ſtars; that it&nbsp;is ſomething of a fiery nature ; that it is the vicegerent&nbsp;¢ff God in the body ; and that the acuteneſs of the&nbsp;ſenſes, the powers of the intellect, with the various&nbsp;kinds of appetites, and paſſions, depend entirely on the&nbsp;qualities of the blood (ι),</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Another opinion of very old date was that of the late ingenious Mr Hunter. According to him, the living&nbsp;principle reſides in the blood. This opinion, which is&nbsp;mentioned by Moſes, was adopted by Critias and others&nbsp;of the ancients. Harvey likewiſe embraced it. But Mr&nbsp;Hunter, who always wiſned to be thought an original,&nbsp;inclines to ſtand at the head of the opinion, and ſupports. it by experiments ſimilar to thoſe of the famed&nbsp;Taliacotius in mending noſes. Should any of our readers wiſti to extract the foul’s immortality from ſuch&nbsp;an opinion, we muſt refer them to the many reſources&nbsp;of ingenuity, ſophiſtry, and logic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Among the Jews, the belief of a future and feparate exiſtence for a long time was deemed no effential article of&nbsp;their creed. Some thought that the foul was a ſpark&nbsp;in the moving </span><span class="font0">cf </span><span class="font2">the heart ; ſome imagined </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">that it was&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">the breath, and that upon the diffolution of the body&nbsp;it naturally vaniſhed into ſoft air. The Sadducees denied the exiftence of either angel or lpirit. Many be-lieved the doctrine of ghoſts, and were accuſtomed to&nbsp;invoke them at the grave. It is hence that we hear&nbsp;the prophets complaining that they were leeking&nbsp;from the living God unto dead men. Some imagined&nbsp;that there was a pre-exiſttnce of ſouls; and, in the caſe&nbsp;of a blind man, aſked our Saviour, whether the man or&nbsp;his parents had finned that he was born blind ? others,&nbsp;inclined to a revolution, of ſoul and body, and thought&nbsp;that our Saviour was either Elias or one of the old&nbsp;prophets returned ; and a great many new-modelled;&nbsp;their opinion of the foul’s immortality according to certain paffages in Scripture. The inſpired mother of Samuel had ſaid, &quot; The Lordki!leth and maketh alive: he&nbsp;bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up.” Iſaiah&nbsp;had exclaimed, &quot; Thy dead ſhall live; together with my&nbsp;dead body ſhall they arife : Awake, and ſing, ye that&nbsp;dwell in the dull ; for thy dew is as the dew of herbs,,&nbsp;and the earth ſhall caſt out the dead.” Daniel had de-clared<sup>l</sup>, that many of them that ſleep in the duſt of the<sup>ι&nbsp;</sup>earth ſhall awake to everlaſting life, and ſome to ſharn¢&nbsp;and everlaſting contempt. In the viſion of the valley,&nbsp;of dry bones, Ezekiel had ſeen that &quot; at the word of&nbsp;the Lord” the bones came together, bone to his bone,&nbsp;the ſinews and the fleſh came upon them, and the ſkin&nbsp;covered them above, and the breath came into the bodies, and they lived, and ſtood upon their feet. And a.&nbsp;paffage of Job led them to ſuppoſe, that at ſome diſtant and future period a particular time, which wap called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">the lajl</span><span class="font2"> or the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Litter day,</span><span class="font2"> was appointed by heaven for&nbsp;the general refuιτection of all thoſe who are ſleeping in&nbsp;their graves. “ I know ( ſays Job) my Redeemer liveth,&nbsp;and that he ſhall ſtand at the latter day upon the earth;&nbsp;and though after my ſkin worms deſtroy this body, yet&nbsp;in my fleſh ſhall' I fee God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">whether theſe paflages were fairly interpreted agree-· ably to their true and original meaning, it is not here&nbsp;our buſineſs to inquire. It is ſuffieient for us to ob-ſerve, that from them many of the Jews inferred the&nbsp;reality of a general reſurrection (κ). In this perſua-ſion, Martha, ſpeaking of her brother Lazarus, ſays to&nbsp;our Lord, &quot; I know that he ſhall riſe again in the re-ſurrection at the laſt day.” This reſurrection appears</span></p><div>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">(g) Yet without regarding the inconſiſtency, many of the Stoics believed, that the foul continued ſeparate· long after death ; though all in general ſeemed to deny a future ſtate of rewards and puniſhments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">( h ) In his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Phyfical Coſmogony,</span><span class="font2"> Plato differed but little from the Stoics ; but he had a∩otlrer fort of coſmogony, in which all things appear to have ſprung from, and to be almoſt wholly compofed of, metaphyſical entities, as&nbsp;ideas of forms, numbers, and mathematical figures. Theſe kinds of notions were common both to him and Py-thagoras ; and were originally borrowed ſrom Egypt, where calculation and geometry were half deified. See&nbsp;Platonism.</span></p>
