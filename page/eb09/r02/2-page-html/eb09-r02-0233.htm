<p><span class="font1">The Roman jurists boasted that it was a right enjoyed by none but Roman citizens ; and it certainly was peculiar&nbsp;to them in this sense, that nowhere else, except among the&nbsp;Latin race from which they had sprung, did the paternal&nbsp;power attain such an intensity. The omnipotence of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias</span><span class="font1"> and the condition of utter subjection to him&nbsp;of his children </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">in potestate</span><span class="font1"> became greatly modified under&nbsp;the empire ; but originally the children, though in public&nbsp;life on an equality with the house father, in private life,&nbsp;and so long as the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">potestas</span><span class="font1"> lasted, λvere subordinated to him&nbsp;to such an extent as, according to the letter of the law, to&nbsp;be in his hands little better than his slaves. They could&nbsp;have nothing of their own : all they earned was his ; and,&nbsp;though it was quite common when they grew up for him&nbsp;to give them </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">peculia,</span><span class="font1"> “ cattle of their own,” to manage for&nbsp;their own benefit, these were only </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">de facto</span><span class="font1"> theirs, but </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">de&nbsp;jure</span><span class="font1"> his. For offences committed by them outside the&nbsp;family circle, for which he was not prepared to make&nbsp;amends, he had to surrender them to the injured party,&nbsp;just like slaves or animals that had done mischief. If his&nbsp;right to them was disputed he used the same action for&nbsp;its vindication that he employed for asserting his ownership of his field or his house : if they were stolen, he proceeded against the thief by an ordinary action of theft ; if&nbsp;for any reason he had to transfer them to a third party,&nbsp;it was by the same form of conveyance that he used for&nbsp;the transfer of things inanimate. Nor was this all ; for,&nbsp;according to the old formula recited in that sort of adoption known as adrogation, he had over them the power&nbsp;of life and death, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus vitae necisgue.</span><span class="font1"> This power was&nbsp;subject to certain restrictions during the infancy of a&nbsp;child ; but, when he had grown up, his father, in the&nbsp;exercise of his domestic jurisdiction, might visit his misconduct, not only in private but in public life, with such&nbsp;punishment as he thought fit, even banishment, slavery,&nbsp;or death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It might happen that a marriage was fruitless, or that a man saw all his sons go to the grave before him, and&nbsp;that the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias</span><span class="font1"> had thus to face the prospect of the&nbsp;extinction of his family and of his own descent to the&nbsp;tomb without posterity to make him blessed. To obviate&nbsp;so dire a misfortune he resorted to the practice of adoption, so common in India and Greece. If it was a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pater-familias</span><span class="font1"> that he adopted the process was called adrogation </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(gιdrogatio)</span><span class="font1"> ; if it was a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">filiusfamilias</span><span class="font1"> it was simply&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">adoptio.</span><span class="font1"> The latter, unknown probably in the earlier&nbsp;regal period, was a somewhat complicated conveyance of&nbsp;a son by his natural parent to his adopter, the purpose of&nbsp;course being expressed ; its effect was simply to transfer&nbsp;the child from the one family to the other. But the former&nbsp;was much more serious, for it involved the extinction of&nbsp;one family</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> that another might be perpetuated. It was&nbsp;therefore an affair of state. It had to be approved by the&nbsp;pontiffs, who probably had to satisfy themselves that there&nbsp;were brothers enough of the adrogatee to attend to the&nbsp;interests of the ancestors whose cult he was renouncing ;&nbsp;and on their favourable report it had to be sanctioned by&nbsp;a vote of the curies, as it involved the deprivation of his&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gens</span><span class="font1"> of their possible right of succession to him. The&nbsp;result was that the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">adrogatus,</span><span class="font1"> from being himself the head&nbsp;of a house, sank to the position of a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">filiusfamilias</span><span class="font1"> in the&nbsp;house of his adopting parent ; if he had had wife or children subject to him, they passed with him into his new&nbsp;family, and so did everything that belonged to him and&nbsp;that was capable of transmission from one person to&nbsp;another. The adopting parent acquired </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">potestas</span><span class="font1"> and power&nbsp;of life and death over the adopted child exactly as if he&nbsp;were the issue of his body ; while the latter enjoyed in his</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">new family the same rights exactly that he would have had if he had been born in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">manus</span><span class="font1"> and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">patria potestas</span><span class="font1"> represent the masterful aspects of the patrician’s domestic establishment. Its conjugal and parental ones, however, though not so prominent in the pages of the jurists, are not to be lost sight&nbsp;of. The Roman family in the early history of the law&nbsp;was governed as much by </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">fas</span><span class="font1"> as by </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus.</span><span class="font1"> It was an association hallowed by religion, and held together not by might&nbsp;merely but by conjugal affection, parental piety, and filial&nbsp;reverence. The purpose of marriage was to rear sons who&nbsp;might perpetuate the house and the family </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sacra.</span><span class="font1"> In&nbsp;entering into the relationship the wife renounced her rights&nbsp;and privileges as a member of her father’s house ; but it&nbsp;was that she might enter into a lifelong partnership with&nbsp;her husband, and be associated with him in all his family&nbsp;interests, sacred and civil. The husband was priest in the&nbsp;family, but wife and children alike assisted in its prayers,&nbsp;and took part in the sacrifices to its lares and penates.&nbsp;As the Greek called his wife the house-mistress, δeσ-7r0u'α,&nbsp;so did the Roman speak of his as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">materfamilias,</span><span class="font0">@@<sup>2</sup></span><span class="font1"> the&nbsp;house-mother. She was treated as her husband’s equal.&nbsp;As for their children, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">potestas</span><span class="font1"> was so tempered by the&nbsp;natural sense of parental duty on the one side and filial&nbsp;affection on the other that in daily life it was rarely felt&nbsp;as a grievance ; while the risk of an arbitrary exercise of&nbsp;the domestic jurisdiction, whether in the heat of passion&nbsp;or under the impulse of justifiable resentment, was guarded&nbsp;against by the rule which required the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias</span><span class="font1"> to&nbsp;consult in the first place the near kinsmen of his child,&nbsp;maternal as well as paternal. Even the incapacity of the&nbsp;subject members of the family to hold property of their&nbsp;own cannot in those times have been regarded as any&nbsp;serious hardship ; for, though the legal title to all their&nbsp;acquisitions was in the house-father, yet in truth they&nbsp;were acquired for and belonged to the family as a whole,&nbsp;and he was but a trustee to hold and administer them for&nbsp;the common benefit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In Greece the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">patria potestas</span><span class="font1"> never reached such dimensions as in Rome, and there it ceased, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">de facto</span><span class="font1"> at&nbsp;least, when a son had grown up to manhood and started&nbsp;a household of his own. But in Rome, unless the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias</span><span class="font1"> voluntarily put an end to it, it lasted as long as&nbsp;the latter lived and retained his status. The marriage of&nbsp;a son, unlike that of a daughter passing into the hand of&nbsp;a husband, did not release him from it, nor did his children&nbsp;become subject to him so long as he himself was </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">in&nbsp;potestate.</span><span class="font1"> On the contrary, his wife passed on marriage&nbsp;into the power of her father-in-law, and their children&nbsp;as they were born fell under that of their paternal grandfather ; and the latter was entitled to exercise over his&nbsp;daughters-in-law and grandchildren the same rights he&nbsp;had over his sons and unmarried daughters. But there&nbsp;was this difference, that, when the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias</span><span class="font1"> died, his&nbsp;sons and daughters who had remained </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">in potestate</span><span class="font1"> and&nbsp;his grandchildren by a predeceased son instantly became&nbsp;their own masters </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(sui juris),</span><span class="font1"> whereas grandchildren by&nbsp;a surviving son simply passed from the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">potestas</span><span class="font1"> of their&nbsp;grandfather into that of their father.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The acquisition of domestic independence by the death of the family head frequently involved the substitution of&nbsp;the guardianship of tutors </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(futela)</span><span class="font1"> for the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">potestas</span><span class="font1"> that&nbsp;had come to an end. This was so invariably in the case of&nbsp;females </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sui juris,</span><span class="font1"> no matter what their age : they remained&nbsp;under guardianship until they had passed by marriage </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">in&nbsp;maηum manti.</span><span class="font1"> It was only pupil males, however, who required tutors, and their office came to an end when puberty</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
