<p><span class="font0">town in Apulia, and were then actually beſieging it. The Roman general, hot ſuſpecting the ſtratagem that&nbsp;was laid againſt him, marched directly by the ſhorteſt&nbsp;road, which lay through the defiles, to relieve the city ;&nbsp;and was not undeceived till he ſaw his army ſurrounded,&nbsp;and blocked up on every ſide. Pontius thus having the&nbsp;Romans entirely in his power, firſt obliged the army to&nbsp;paſs under the yoke, having been previouſly ſtripped of&nbsp;all but their garments ; he then ſtipulated that they&nbsp;ſhould wholly quit the territories of the Samnites, and&nbsp;that they ſhould continue to live upon terms of former&nbsp;confederacy. The Romans were conſtrained to ſubmit&nbsp;to this ignominious treaty, and marched into Capua diſarmed and half naked. When the army arrived at&nbsp;Rome, the whole city was moſt ſurpriſingly afflicted at&nbsp;their ſhameful return ; nothing but grief and reſentment&nbsp;was to be ſeen, and the whole city was put into mourning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But this was a tranſitory calamity : the war was carried on as uſual for many years ; the power of the Samnites declining every day, while that of the Romans continually increaſed. Under the conduct of Papirius Curſor, who was at different times conſul and&nbsp;dictator, repeated triumphs were gained. Fabius Maximus alſo had his ſhare in the glory of conquering&nbsp;them ; and Decius, the ſon of that Decius whom we&nbsp;ſaw devoting himſelf for his country about 40 years before, followed the example of his father, and ruſhed&nbsp;into the midſt of the enemy, imagining that he could&nbsp;ſave the lives of his countrymen with the loſs of his&nbsp;own.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The ſucceſs of the Romans againſt the Samnites alarmed all Italy. The Tarentines in particular, who&nbsp;had long plotted underhand againſt the republic, now&nbsp;Openly declared themſelves ; and invited into Italy&nbsp;Pyrrhus king of Epirus, in hopes of being able by&nbsp;his means to ſubdue the Romans. The offer was readily accepted by that ambitious monarch, who had nothing leſs in view than the conqueſt of all Italy.—&nbsp;Their ambaſſadors carried magnificent preſents for the&nbsp;king, with inſtructions to acquaint him, that they only&nbsp;wanted a general of fame and experience ; and that, as&nbsp;for troops, they could themſelves furniſh a numerous&nbsp;army of 20,000 horſe and 350,000 foot, made up of&nbsp;Lucanians, Meſſapians, Samnites, and Tarentines. As&nbsp;ſoon as the news of this deputation were brought to the&nbsp;Roman camp, Æmilius, who had hitherto made war on&nbsp;the Tarentines but gently, in hopes of adjuſting matters by way of negociation, took other meaſures, and&nbsp;began to commit all ſorts of hoſtilities. He took cities, ſtormed caſtles, and laid the whole country waſte,&nbsp;burning and deſtroying all before him. The Tarentines brought their army into the field ; but Æmilius&nbsp;ſoon obliged them to take refuge within their walls.&nbsp;However, to induce them to lay aſide the deſign of receiving Pyrrhus, he uſed the priſoners he had taken&nbsp;with great moderation, and even ſent them back without ranſom. Theſe highly extolled the generoſity of&nbsp;the conſul, inſomuch that many of the inhabitants were&nbsp;brought over to the Roman party, and they all began&nbsp;to repent of their having rejected a peace and ſent for&nbsp;Pyrrhus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But, in the mean time, the Tarentine ambaſſadors arriving in Epirus, purſuant to the powers they had&nbsp;received, made an abſolute treaty with the kirg.j who</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">immediately ſent before him the famous Cyneas, with 3000 men, to take poſſeſſion of the citadel of Tarentum. This eloquent miniſter ſoon found means to&nbsp;depoſe Agis, whom the Tarentines had choſen to be&nbsp;their general and the governor of the city, though a&nbsp;fincere friend to the Romans. He likewiſe prevailed&nbsp;upon the Tarentines to deliver up the citadel into his&nbsp;hands ; which he no ſooner got poſſeſſion of, than he&nbsp;diſpatched meſſengers to Pyrrhus, ſoiicſting him to&nbsp;haften his departure for Italy. In the mean time, the&nbsp;conſul Æmilius, finding that he could not attempt anything with ſucceſs againſt the Tarentines this campaign,&nbsp;reſolved to put his troops into winter-quarters in A-pulia, which was not far from the territory of Tarentum, that was ſoon to become the ſeat of the war.&nbsp;As he was obliged to paſs through certain defiles, with&nbsp;the ſea on one ſide and high hills on the other, he&nbsp;was there attacked by the Tarentines and Epirots&nbsp;from great numbers of barks fraught with baliftæ (that&nbsp;is, engines for throwing ſtones of a vaſt weight), and&nbsp;from the hills, on which were poſted a great many archers and flingers. Hereupon Æmilius placed the Tarentine priſoners between him and the enemy ; which&nbsp;the Tarentines perceiving, ſoon left off moleſting the&nbsp;Romans, out of compaſſion to their own countrymen ;&nbsp;ſo that the Romans arrived ſafe in Apulia, and there&nbsp;took up their winter-quarters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The next year Æmilius was continued in the command of his own troops, with the title of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">proconſul;</span><span class="font0"> and was ordered to make war upon the Salentines, who had&nbsp;declared for the Tarentines. The preſent exigence of&nbsp;affairs obliged the Romans to enliſt the proletarii, who&nbsp;were the meaneſt of the people, and therefore by way&nbsp;of contempt called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">proletarii,</span><span class="font0"> as being thought incapable of doing the ſtate any other ſervice than that of&nbsp;peopling the city, and {locking the republic with ſubjects. Hitherto they had never been ſuffered to bear&nbsp;arms ; but were now, to their great ſatisfaction, enrolled as well as others. In the mean time Pyrrhus&nbsp;arrived at 'Γarentum, having narrowly eſeaped ſhip-wreck ; and being conducted into the city by his faithful Cyneas, was received there with loud acclamations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Tarentines, who were entirely devoted to their pleaſures, expected that he ſhould take all the fatigues&nbsp;of the war on himſelf, and expoſe only his Epirots to&nbsp;danger. And indeed Pyrrhus for ſome days diffembled&nbsp;his deſign, and ſuffered the Tarentines to indulge&nbsp;without reſtraint in their uſual diverſions. But his ſhips,&nbsp;which had been diſperſed all over the Ionian ſea, arriving one after another, and with them the troops&nbsp;which he had put on board at Epirus, he began to&nbsp;reform the diſorders that prevailed in tire city. The&nbsp;theatre was the place to which the idle Tarentines re-ſorted daily in great numbers, and where the incendiaries ſtirred up the people to ſedition with their harangues : he therefore cauſed it to be ſhut up, as he did&nbsp;likewiſe the public gardens, porticoes, and places of&nbsp;exerciſe, where the inhabitants uſed to.entertain themſelves with news, and ſpeak with great freedom of their&nbsp;governors, cenſuring their conduct, and ſettling the government according to their different humours, which&nbsp;occaſioned great diviſions, and rent the city into various&nbsp;factions. As they were a very voluptuous and indolent people, they ſpent whole days aι∙d nights in feaſts,&nbsp;maſquerades, plays, &amp;c. Theſe therefore Pyrrhus ab-</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
