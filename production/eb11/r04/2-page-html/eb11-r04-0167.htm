<p><span class="font0">another antipope, Benedict XIII. But a new jubilee was in* prospect for the year 1400, and this was always an efficacious&nbsp;means of bending the will of the Romans. Depending&nbsp;upon this and the assistance of Ladislaus, Boniface&nbsp;not only demanded full powers to nominate senators&nbsp;(none having been recently elected), but insisted on&nbsp;the suppression of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">banderesi.</span><span class="font0"> Both requests&nbsp;were granted; but, directly Angelo Alaleoni was made senator,&nbsp;a conspiracy was hatched for the re-establishment of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">banderesi.</span><span class="font0"> However, the pope felt sure of his strength; the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">plot was discovered and the conspirators were beheaded on the stairs of the Capitol. This proved the end of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">banderesi&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and of the liberties of Rome. The government ¡was again&nbsp;directed by an alien senator together with three conservators;&nbsp;but the latter were gradually deprived of their political&nbsp;attributes, and became mere civil officers. The militia, regions,&nbsp;gilds and other associations now rapidly lost all political&nbsp;importance, and before long were little more than empty names.&nbsp;Thus in 1398 the Romans submitted to the complete sway&nbsp;of the pope, and in July of the same year the senator chosen&nbsp;by him was Malatesta dei Malatesti of Rimini, one of a line of&nbsp;tyrants, a valiant soldier, who was also temporal vicar and&nbsp;captain-general of the church. Boniface continued to appoint&nbsp;foreign senators during the rest of his life; he fortified the&nbsp;castle of St Angelo, the Vatican and the Capitol; he stationed&nbsp;galleys at the mouth of the Tiber, and proved himself in all&nbsp;things a thoroughly temporal prince. He aggrandized all&nbsp;his kindred, especially his brother, and, with the aid of his&nbsp;senator, his armed force and the protection of Ladislaus,&nbsp;succeeded in keeping down all the surviving nobles. In 1400,&nbsp;however, these made an attempt to upset the government.&nbsp;Niccolo Colonna forced his way into the city with cries of&nbsp;“ Popolo, popolo! death to Boniface! ” But the Romans&nbsp;had grown deaf to the voice of liberty; they refused to rise,&nbsp;and the senator, a Venetian named Zaccaria Trevisan, behaved&nbsp;with much energy. Colonna and his men had to beat a swift&nbsp;retreat to Palestrina. A charge of high treason was immediately&nbsp;instituted against him, and thirty-one rebels were beheaded.&nbsp;The pope then proclaimed a crusade against all the Colonna,&nbsp;and sent a body of two thousand men and some of the Neapolitan&nbsp;soldiery to attack them. Several of their estates were seized&nbsp;and devastated, but Palestrina continued to hold out, and on&nbsp;the 7th of January 1401 the Colonna finally made submission&nbsp;to the pope. Nevertheless, they obtained advantageous terms,&nbsp;for Boniface left them their lands, appointed them vicars of&nbsp;other territories, and made similar agreements with the Gaetani&nbsp;and Orsini. In this way he became absolute master of Rome.&nbsp;One chronicler remarks that “ Romanis tanquam rigidus&nbsp;imperator dominabatur,” and the same tone is taken by&nbsp;others. But he did not succeed in putting an end to the&nbsp;schism of the church, which was still going on when he died&nbsp;in the Vatican on the 1st of October 1404.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Innocent VII. (1404-6) was the next pope. He too was a Neapolitan, and on his election the people again rose in revolt&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">an</span><span class="font0">d refused to acknowledge him unless he consented to resign&nbsp;the temporal power. But Ladislaus of Naples hastened to his&nbsp;help, and an agreement was made which, under the cover of apparent concessions, really riveted the people’s chains. Rome was&nbsp;recognized as the seat of the temporal and spiritual sovereignty&nbsp;of the pope, and the pope continued to appoint the senator.&nbsp;The people were to elect seven governors of the city, who were&nbsp;to swear fealty to the pope and carry on the government in&nbsp;conjunction with three other governors chosen by the pontiff&nbsp;or Ladislaus. The stipulations of Boniface IX. concerning&nbsp;ecclesiastical immunities were again confirmed. The barons&nbsp;were forbidden to place more than five lances each at the service&nbsp;of the people, and—which was the real gist of the covenant—&nbsp;the people were henceforth forbidden to make laws or statutes&nbsp;without the permission of the pope. The captain of the people,&nbsp;deprived of his political and judicial functions and reduced to&nbsp;a simple judge, was also to be chosen by the pope. But this&nbsp;treaty, drawn up on the 27th of October 1404, was not signed&nbsp;at the time, and many difficulties and disturbances arose when&nbsp;its terms were to be put into effect. The Romans nominated&nbsp;the seven governors, but, without waiting until the pope had&nbsp;chosen three more, placed the state in their hands, and styled&nbsp;them <sup>u</sup> governors of the liberty of the Roman Republic.” They&nbsp;were, in fact, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">banderesi</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">reformatori</span><span class="font0"> under a new name. But&nbsp;the attempt proved inefficacious, for, at the pope’s first threat&nbsp;of departure, the Romans made their submission, and the treaty&nbsp;of October was subscribed on the 15th of May 1405. Nevertheless, as it only bears the signatures of the “ seven governors&nbsp;of the liberty of the Roman Republic,” the pope would seem&nbsp;to have made some concessions. His position was by no means&nbsp;assured. Ladislaus was known to aspire to absolute dominion&nbsp;in Italy, and, although willing to aid in suppressing the republic,&nbsp;tried to prepare the way for his own designs, and frequently&nbsp;held out a helping hand to the vanquished. On the 6th of&nbsp;August fourteen influential citizens of Rome boldly presented&nbsp;themselves at the Vatican, and in a threatening manner called&nbsp;the pope to account for giving his whole attention to worldly&nbsp;things, instead of endeavouring to put a stop to the schisms of&nbsp;the church. But, on leaving his presence, they were attacked&nbsp;by Luigi Migliorati, the pope’s nephew, and notorious for his&nbsp;violence, who killed eleven of their number, including several&nbsp;heads of the regions and two of the governors. An insurrection&nbsp;ensued, and the pope and his nephew fled to Viterbo. The&nbsp;Colonna tried to profit by these events, and applied to Ladislaus, who, hoping that the moment had come to make himself&nbsp;master of Rome, sent the count of Troia thither with a troop&nbsp;of three thousand horse. But the people’, enraged by this&nbsp;treachery, and determined not to fall under the yoke of Naples,&nbsp;awoke for an instant to the memory of their past glories, and&nbsp;bravely repulsed the Colonna and the Neapolitans. And, on&nbsp;the speedy arrival of the Orsini with some of the papal troops,&nbsp;the people voluntarily restored the papal government, and,&nbsp;assembling the parliament, besought the pope to return on his&nbsp;own terms. Accordingly, after first naming Francesco Pancia-tichi of Pistoia to the senatorship, the pope came back on the&nbsp;13th of March 1406, bringing his whole curia with him, and also&nbsp;the murderer Migliorati, who, triumphing in impunity, became&nbsp;more arrogant than before. Here indeed was a proof that the&nbsp;Romans were no longer worthy of liberty! And now, by means&nbsp;of the Orsini, Innocent had only to reduce the Colonna and&nbsp;other nobles raised to power by Ladislaus; nor was this very&nbsp;difficult, seeing that the king, in his usual fashion, abandoned&nbsp;them to their fate, and, making terms with the pope, was named&nbsp;gonfalonier of the church and again protected her cause.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Innocent, dying in 1406, was succeeded by Gregory XII., a Venetian, who, as we shall presently see, resigned the chair&nbsp;in 1415. On his accession, finding his state firmly established,&nbsp;he seemed to be seriously bent on putting an end to the Great&nbsp;Schism, and for that purpose arranged a meeting with the&nbsp;antipope Benedict XIII. at the congress of Savona in 140S.&nbsp;But Gregory and Benedict only used the congress as a pretext&nbsp;for making war upon each other, and were urged on by Ladislaus, who hoped by weakening both to gain possession of Rome,&nbsp;where, although opposed by the Orsini, he had the support of&nbsp;the Colonna. Gregory, who had then fled from Rome, made&nbsp;a momentary attempt to win the popular favour by restoring,&nbsp;the government of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">bander esi\</span><span class="font0"> but Ladislaus marched into&nbsp;Rome in June 1408 and established a senator of his&nbsp;own. Meanwhile the two popes were continuing&nbsp;their shameful struggle, and the council of Pisa (March&nbsp;1409), in attempting to check it, only succeeded in raising up&nbsp;a third pontiff, first in the person of Alexander V. (1409-10),&nbsp;and then in the turbulent Baldassarc Cossa, who assumed the&nbsp;name of John XXIII. The latter began by sending a large&nbsp;contingent to assist Louis of Anjou against Ladislaus. But the&nbsp;enterprise failed, and, seeing himself deserted by all, Pope John&nbsp;next embraced the cause of his foe by naming him gonfalonier&nbsp;of the church. Thereupon Ladislaus concluded a sham peace,&nbsp;and then, seizing Rome, put it to the sack and established his&nbsp;own government there. Thus John, like the other two popes,</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
