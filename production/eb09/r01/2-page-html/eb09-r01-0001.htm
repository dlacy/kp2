        <p><span class="font6">R</span><span class="font4"> was written in Greek originally as P,
                following the Phoenician form ; sometimes, however, a triangle takes&nbsp;the place
                of the semicircle ; not unfrequently also a short&nbsp;stroke appears where we have
                the lower limb on the right&nbsp;hand ; the reason of this addition is not plain :
                it can hardly&nbsp;have been a diacritical mark to distinguish R from P (as&nbsp;G
                from C at Rome) because the latter symbol in Greece&nbsp;always kept its two
                vertical lines (Γ), the curved line&nbsp;(P) appearing first in the Roman
                alphabet.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font4">The sounds denoted by the same symbol </span><span class="font4"
                style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span class="font4"> differ considerably. First,
                there is the true consonantal </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;"
                >r—</span><span class="font4">our English </span><span class="font4"
                style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span class="font4"> in </span><span
                class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">reed,</span><span class="font4">
                &amp;c.—produced by raising the tip only&nbsp;of the tongue towards the front palate
                ; the voice escapes&nbsp;by this aperture, the side passages between the tongue
                and&nbsp;the palate being closed ; the mechanism, therefore, is just&nbsp;the
                opposite to that which produces </span><span class="font4"
                style="font-style:italic;">l</span><span class="font4"> (see letter
                L).&nbsp;Secondly, there is the vowel </span><span class="font4"
                style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span class="font4"> ; this is due to the
                space&nbsp;between the tip of the tongue and the palate being sufficiently great to
                allow the voice to escape without any&nbsp;friction ; the difference betλveen this
                and consonantal </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span
                class="font4"> is&nbsp;parallel to that between </span><span class="font4"
                style="font-style:italic;">u</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span
                class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">w,</span><span class="font4"> or between
                </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">i</span><span class="font4">
                and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">y.</span><span
                class="font4"> This&nbsp;vowel-sound, though not heard regularly in any
                modern&nbsp;language, is not unfrequent in several in certain combinations; for
                example, it is quite possible to articulate “father”&nbsp;as “fath-r,” where the
                </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span class="font4">
                alone forms a syllable and is therefore vocalic. This vowel-sound was a regular
                sound in Sanskrit, and was probably also heard in the parent language ;&nbsp;but in
                the derived languages (except Sanskrit) it became&nbsp;consonantal </span><span
                class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span class="font4"> with an
                independent vowel preceding or&nbsp;following; thus a presumed original “krd” ( =
                heart),&nbsp;where r denotes the vocalic r, gave in Sanskrit “hrd,” in&nbsp;Greek
                </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">κpaδdη,</span><span
                class="font4"> in Latin “ cor(d).” Thirdly, </span><span class="font4"
                style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span class="font4"> may denote&nbsp;a
                trill,—that is to say, a sound produced by the vibration&nbsp;of the tongue when
                laid loosely against the palate and set&nbsp;in motion by a strong current of breath
                or voice. When&nbsp;the point of the tongue is laid loosely in this way
                against&nbsp;the palate just behind the gums and made to trill as voice&nbsp;passes
                over it, we hear the Scotch and the French </span><span class="font4"
                style="font-style:italic;">r,</span><span class="font4"> each&nbsp;of which is a
                trill, not a consonantal </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;"
                >r.</span><span class="font4"> The same sound,&nbsp;but unvoiced, is heard in the
                French “ théâtre,” &amp;c., and is&nbsp;also the Welsh rA. A similar trill at the
                back part of the&nbsp;palate gives the Northumbrian “burr.”</span></p>

                influx of the Raab&nbsp;into a branch of the Danube, 70 miles to the
                south-east&nbsp;of Vienna. It is a well-built town, with a pleasant promenade laid
                out on the site of the old fortifications,&nbsp;and is the seat of a Roman Catholic
                bishop. The cathedral dates from the 12th century, but has recently
                been&nbsp;modernized ; the bishop’s palace is an imposing castellated&nbsp;edifice,
                with dungeons constructed by the Turks. The&nbsp;town possesses several other
                churches, two of which belong&nbsp;to the Protestants and one to the Greek Church,
                besides&nbsp;convents, schools, and an academy of jurisprudence. The&nbsp;theatre,
                on an island formed by the Danube and the Raab,&nbsp;is also a handsome building.
                The inhabitants, who numbered 20,980 in 1880, manufacture cloth and tobacco

                forces of the insurgent Hungarian noblesse were easily defeated here by Napoleon’s
                veterans ; and&nbsp;the attempts made to maintain the town against the Austrians
                in&nbsp;1848-49 were also fruitless. About 10 miles to the south-east of
                Raab&nbsp;is St Martinsberg, the oldest and wealthiest abbey in Hungary.</span></p>

                shrewish&nbsp;wife, he surpassed Job himself. He died as the first head&nbsp;of the
