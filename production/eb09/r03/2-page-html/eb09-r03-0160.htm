<p><span class="font1">course of the Revolution there; and in 1790 he published his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ThougJds on the Probable InJiuenxe of the Late Revolution in France upon Great Britain,</span><span class="font1"> a work of great power.&nbsp;His practice at the Chancery bar continued largely to increase, and in 1800 he was made a K. C. In 1798 he&nbsp;married the daughter of Francis Garbett of Knill Court,&nbsp;Herefordshire ; and in 1805 he was appointed chancellor&nbsp;of the county palatine of Durham. His great abilities&nbsp;were thoroughly recognized by the Whig party, to which&nbsp;he attached himself ; and in 1806, on the accession of&nbsp;the ministry of “All the Talents” to office, he was offered&nbsp;the post of solicitor-general, although he had never sat in&nbsp;the House of Commons. He accepted the office, and was&nbsp;knighted and brought into parliament for Queenborough.&nbsp;He went out of office with the Government, but remained&nbsp;in the House of Commons, sitting successively for&nbsp;Horsham, Wareham, and Arundel. It was now that&nbsp;Sir Samuel Romilly commenced the greatest labour of his&nbsp;life, his attempt to reform the criminal law of England,&nbsp;which was at once cruel and illogical. By statute law&nbsp;innumerable offences were punished by death, but, as such&nbsp;wholesale executions would be impossible, the larger&nbsp;number of those convicted and sentenced to death at&nbsp;every assizes were respited, after having heard the sentence of death solemnly passed upon them. This led&nbsp;to many acts of injustice, as the lives of the convicts&nbsp;depended on the caprice of the judges, while at the&nbsp;same time it made the whole system of punishments and&nbsp;of the criminal law ridiculous. Romilly saw this, and in&nbsp;1808 he managed to repeal the statute 8 Eliz. c. 4, which&nbsp;made it a capital offence to steal from the person. This&nbsp;success, however, raised opposition, and in the following&nbsp;year three bills repealing equally sanguinary statutes were&nbsp;thrown out by the House of Lords under the influence of&nbsp;Lord Ellenborough. Year after year the same influence&nbsp;prevailed, and Romilly saw his bills rejected ; but his&nbsp;patient efforts and his eloquence ensured victory eventually&nbsp;for his cause by opening the eyes of Englishmen to the&nbsp;barbarity of their criminal law. The only success he had&nbsp;was in securing the repeal, in 1812, of the statute 39 Eliz.&nbsp;c. 17, making it a capital offence for a soldier or a mariner&nbsp;to beg without a pass from a magistrate or his commanding officer. Sir Samuel Romilly’s efforts made his name&nbsp;famous not only in England but all over Europe, and on&nbsp;4th July 1818 he had the honour of being returned at&nbsp;the head of the poll for the city of Westminster. He&nbsp;did not long survive his triumph. On the 29th of October&nbsp;1818 Lady Romilly died in the Isle of Wight. Her&nbsp;husband’s grief was intense, and he committed suicide in&nbsp;a fit of temporary insanity on the 2d November. No man&nbsp;of his time was more loved than Sir Samuel Romilly ; his&nbsp;singularly sweet nature, his upright manliness, his eloquence, and his great efforts on behalf of humanity secured&nbsp;him permanent fame. His second son John rivalled his&nbsp;reputation as a lawyer, and after being appointed master&nbsp;of the rolls in 1851, an office which he held for twenty-two&nbsp;years, was raised to the peerage as Lord Romilly in 1866.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">ROMNEY, </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">George</span><span class="font1"> (1734-1802), historical and portrait painter, was born at Dalton-Ie-Furness, Lancashire, on&nbsp;December 26, 1734. His father was a builder and cabinetmaker of the place, and the son, having manifested a turn&nbsp;for mechanics, was instructed in the latter craft, showing&nbsp;considerable dexterity with his fingers, executing carvings&nbsp;of figures in wood, and constructing a violin, which he&nbsp;spent much time in playing. He was also busy with his&nbsp;pencil ; and, some of his sketches of the neighbouring&nbsp;rustics having attracted the attention of his father, he was&nbsp;at length induced to apprentice the boy, at the age of&nbsp;nineteen, to an itinerant painter of portraits and domestic&nbsp;subjects named Steele, an artist who had studied in Paris&nbsp;under Vanloo ; but the erratic habits of his instructor&nbsp;prevented Romney from making great progress in his art.&nbsp;In 1756 he impulsively married a young woman who had&nbsp;nursed him through a fever, and started as a portrait&nbsp;painter on his own account, travelling through the northern&nbsp;counties, executing likenesses at a couple of guineas, and&nbsp;producing a series of some twenty figure compositions,&nbsp;which were exhibited in Kendal, and afterwards disposed&nbsp;of by means of a lottery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Having, at the age of twenty-seven, saved about £100, he left a portion of the sum with his wife and family, and&nbsp;started to seek his fortune in London, never returning,&nbsp;except for two brief visits, till he came, a broken-down and&nbsp;aged man, to die. In London he rapidly rose into popular&nbsp;favour. His Death of General Wolfe was judged worthy&nbsp;of the second prize at the Society of Arts, but a word from&nbsp;Reynolds in praise of Mortimer’s Edward the Confessor&nbsp;led to the premium being awarded to that painter, while&nbsp;Romney had to content himself with a donation of £50,&nbsp;an incident which led to the subsequent coldness between&nbsp;him and the president which prevented him from exhibiting at the Academy or presenting himself for its honours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In 1764 he paid a brief visit to Paris, where he was befriended by Joseph Vernet ; and his portrait of Sir&nbsp;Joseph Yates, painted on his return, bears distinct traces&nbsp;of his study of the works of Rubens then in the Luxembourg&nbsp;Gallery. In 1766 he became a member of the Incorporated&nbsp;Society of Artists, and three years later he seems to have&nbsp;studied in their schools. Soon he was in the full tide of&nbsp;prosperity. He removed to Great Newport Street, near&nbsp;the residence of Sir Joshua, whose fame in portraiture he&nbsp;began to rival in such works as Sir George and Lady&nbsp;Warren, and Mrs Yates as the Tragic Muse ; and his&nbsp;professional income rose to £1200 a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But he was seized with a longing to study in Italy ; and in the beginning of 1773 he started for Rome in company&nbsp;with Ozias Humphrey the miniature painter. On his&nbsp;arrival he separated himself from his fellow traveller and&nbsp;his countrymen, and devoted himself to solitary study,&nbsp;raising a scaffold to examine the paintings in the Vatican,&nbsp;and giving much time to work from the undraped model, of&nbsp;which his painting of a Wood Nymph was a fine and graceful result. At Parma he concentrated himself upon the&nbsp;productions of Correggio, which powerfully fascinated him,&nbsp;and greatly influenced his practice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1775 Romney returned to London, establishing himself in Cavendish Square, and resuming his extensive and lucrative&nbsp;employment as a portrait-painter, which in 1785, according to the&nbsp;estimate of his pupil Robinson, yielded him an income of over&nbsp;£3600. The admiration of the town was divided between him and&nbsp;Reynolds. “There are two factions in art,” said Lord Thurlow<sub>1&nbsp;</sub>“and I am of the Ronmey faction,”—and the remark, and the&nbsp;rivalry which it implied, caused much annoyance to Sir Joshua,&nbsp;who was accustomed to refer contemptuously to the younger painter&nbsp;as “the man in Cavendish Square.” After his return from Italy&nbsp;Romney formed two friendships which powerfully influenced his&nbsp;life. He became acquainted with Hayley, his future biographer,&nbsp;then in the zenith of his little-merited popularity as a poet. His&nbsp;influence on the painter seems to have been far from salutary.&nbsp;Weak himself, he flattered the weaknesses of Romney, encouraged&nbsp;his excessive and morbid sensibility, disturbed him with amateurish&nbsp;fancies and suggestions, and tempted him to expend on slight rapid&nbsp;sketches, and ill-considered, seldom-completed paintings of ideal&nbsp;and poetical subjects, talents which would have found titter exercise in the steady pursuit of portraiture. About 1783 Romney&nbsp;was introduced to Emma Hart, afterwards celebrated as Lady&nbsp;Hamilton, and she became the model from whom he worked&nbsp;incessantly. Her bewitching face smiles from innumerable canvases ; he painted her as a Hagdalene and as a Joan of Arc, as a&nbsp;Circe, a Bacchante, a Cassandra, and he has himself confessed that&nbsp;she was the inspirer of what was most beautiful in his art.
