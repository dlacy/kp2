            <p><span class="font2">The Forum Romanum or Magnum, as it was called in late times to
                    distinguish it from the imperial fora, occupies a valley which&nbsp;extends from
                    the foot of the Capitoline hill to the north-west part&nbsp;of the Palatine.
                    Till the construction of the great cloacae it was,&nbsp;at least in wet seasons,
                    marshy ground, in which were several&nbsp;pools of water. In early times it was
                    bounded on two sides by&nbsp;rows of shops and houses, dating from the time of
                    the first&nbsp;Tarquín (Liv. i. 35). The shops on the south-west side
                    facing&nbsp;the Sacra Via, where the Basilica Julia afterwards was
                    built,&nbsp;were occupied by the Tabernae Vetcres.<sup>@@2</sup> The shops on
                    the&nbsp;northern side, being occupied by silversmiths, were
                    called&nbsp;Tabernae Argent ariae, and in later times, when rebuilt after
                    a&nbsp;fire, were called Tabernae Novae (sec Liv. xxvi. 27, xl.
                        51)<sup>@@3&nbsp;</sup>An altar to Saturn (Dionys. i. 34, vi. 1),
                    traditionally set up by&nbsp;the companions of Hercules, and an altar to Vulcan,
                    both at the&nbsp;end towards the Capitol, with the temple of Vesta and the
                    Regia&nbsp;at the opposite end, were among the earliest monuments
                    grouped&nbsp;around the Forum. The Lacus Curtius vanished, as Varro
                    says&nbsp;(£.£. v. 148-49), probably with other stagnant pools, when&nbsp;the
                    cloacae were constructed (Liv. i. 38, 56).<sup>@@4</sup> Another pool,&nbsp;the
                    Lacus Servilius, near the Basilica Julia, was preserved in&nbsp;some form or
                    other till the imperial period. Under Sulla it was&nbsp;used as a place to
                    expose the heads of many senators murdered&nbsp;in bis proscriptions (Cic.

                    Volcanal was an open area, so called from the early&nbsp;altar to Vulcan, and
                    was (like the Comitium) a place of public&nbsp;meeting, at least during the
                    regal period.<sup>@@5</sup> It was raised above&nbsp;the Comitium, and was a
                    space levelled en the lower slope of the&nbsp;Capitoline hill behind the arch of
                    Severus; the foundations of&nbsp;the altar were discovered in 1898. It was
                    probably much encroached upon when the temple of Concord was enlarged in
                    the&nbsp;reign of Augustus. Fig. 8 gives a carefully measured plan of
                    the&nbsp;Forum, showing the most recent discoveries.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font2">Unlike the fora of the emperors, each of which was surrounded by
                    a lofty wall and built at one time from one design, the architectural form of
                    the Forum Romanum was a slow growth. The&nbsp;marshy battlefield of the early
                    inhabitants of the Capitol and&nbsp;Palatine became, when the ground was drained
                    by the great cloacae,&nbsp;under a united rule the most convenient site for
                    political meetings,&nbsp;for commercial transactions, and for the pageants of

                    For these purposes&nbsp;a central space, though but a small one, was kept clear
                    of buildings;&nbsp;but it was gradually occupied in a somewhat inconvenient
                    manner by&nbsp;an ever-accumulating crowd of statues and other honorary
                    monuments. On three sides the limits of this open space are marked by&nbsp;paved
                    roads, faced by the stately buildings which gradually took&nbsp;the place of the
                    simple wooden tabernae and porticus of early times.&nbsp;The
                        Comitium<sup>@@7</sup> was a level space in front of the Curia; the

                    restored&nbsp;(Prosp. Aquit. p. 571), and it was finally rebuilt by
                    Diocletian.&nbsp;The existing church of S. Adriano is the Curia of Diocletian,
