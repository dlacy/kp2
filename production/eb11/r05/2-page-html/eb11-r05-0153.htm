<p><span class="font0">of various nationalities, was called together at Moscow to consider the needs of the empire and the means of satisfying&nbsp;them. The instructions for the guidance of the Assembly&nbsp;were prepared by the empress herself and were, as she frankly&nbsp;admitted, the result of “ pillaging the philosophers of the&nbsp;West,” especially Montesquieu and Beccaria. As many of the&nbsp;democratic principles frightened her more moderate and experienced advisers, she wisely refrained from immediately&nbsp;putting them into execution. After holding more than 200&nbsp;sittings the so-called Commission was dissolved without getting&nbsp;beyond the realm of theory and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">pia desiieria.</span><span class="font0"> Subsequently&nbsp;very important reforms were introduced, not by the vote of an&nbsp;assembly, but by the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">fiat</span><span class="font0"> of the autocratic power. The large&nbsp;territorial units .of administration created by Peter the&nbsp;Great were broken up into so-called “ governments ”&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(gubernii)</span><span class="font0"> and further subdivided into districts </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(uyezdy),&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and each government was confided to the care of a governor&nbsp;and a vice-governor assisted by a council. A certain amount&nbsp;of local self-government was entrusted to the nobles and the&nbsp;burghers, and the judicial administration was thoroughly&nbsp;reorganized in an enlightened ana humane spirit. The great&nbsp;estates of the Church, on which were settled about a million&nbsp;serfs, were secularized and assimilated with the state-domains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">At one moment the idea of emancipating all the serfs was entertained, but the project was speedily abandoned, because&nbsp;it would have alienated the nobles—the only class on which&nbsp;Catherine could rely for support. To conciliate them she&nbsp;greatly extended the area of serfage by making large grants&nbsp;of land and serfs to courtiers and public servants who had&nbsp;specially distinguished themselves. About education a great&nbsp;deal was spoken and written, and a certain amount of progress&nbsp;was effected. Whilst primary education was neglected, secondary schools were created in the principal towns and a&nbsp;Russian Academy was founded in St Petersburg. In the imperial&nbsp;court, so far as outward decorum and refinement were concerned, there was an immense improvement, and the upper&nbsp;section of the old Russian </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dvorianstvo</span><span class="font0"> became a noblesse with&nbsp;French aristocratic conceptions and ideals. A taste for French&nbsp;literature spread rapidly, and the poets and dramatists of Paris&nbsp;found clever imitators in St Petersburg.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">By such means Catherine made herself very popular in the upper ranks of society, but as a woman and a usurper who&nbsp;did little or nothing to lighten the burdens of the people she&nbsp;failed to gain the loyalty and devotion of the masses. In&nbsp;the first part of her reign popular discontent found expression&nbsp;in various forms, and on one occasion it produced a serious&nbsp;insurrection. In 1773 a Don Cossack called Pugachev, who&nbsp;was so uneducated that he could not even sign the manifestoes&nbsp;written for him, declared himself to be Peter III., and announced&nbsp;that he was going to St Petersburg to punish his faithless wife&nbsp;and place his son Paul on the throne. Many believed, or&nbsp;affected to believe, in the pretender, and .in a short time he&nbsp;gathered around him a large force of Cossacks, peasants, Tatars&nbsp;and Tchuvash, swept over the basin of the lower Volga, executed mercilessly the landed proprietors, seized and pillaged&nbsp;the town of Kazan, and kept the whole country in a state of&nbsp;alarm for more than a year. Finally, after a crushing defeat&nbsp;in which 2000 of the insurgents were killed and 6000 taken&nbsp;prisoners, he was betrayed by some of his followers and executed&nbsp;in Moscow. His name and exploits still live in the popular&nbsp;legends, and the insurrection is often referred to in revolutionary&nbsp;pamphlets as a laudable popular protest against tyrannical&nbsp;autocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In foreign affairs Catherine devoted her attention mainly to pushing forward the Russian frontier westwards and southwards, and as France was the traditional ally of&nbsp;Sweden, Poland and Turkey, she adopted at first&nbsp;the so-called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">système du Nord,</span><span class="font0"> that is to say, a close&nbsp;alliance with Prussia, England and Denmark against</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">France and Austria, who had buried their traditional enmity in the famous alliance of 1756. The first step westwards was&nbsp;taken in Courland, which lay between Russian territory and&nbsp;the Baltic coast. At the time of her accession the duchy was&nbsp;ruled by a son of the Polish king Augustus III., and he gave&nbsp;a pretext for aggression by refusing to allow Russian troops&nbsp;returning from the Seven Years’ War to pass through his&nbsp;territory. For this unfriendly act he was deposed and replaced&nbsp;by Biren, who had previously been duke of Courland (1737-40)&nbsp;and had since been an exile in Siberia and Yaroslav. Under&nbsp;Biren (1763-69) and his son and successor (1769-95), as&nbsp;nominees of Catherine, Courland was completely under Russian&nbsp;influence until 1795, when it was formally incorporated with&nbsp;the empire. The next country to feel the expansive tendencies&nbsp;of Russia was Poland, which had now very little&nbsp;power of resistance. Whilst Russia, Austria, Prussia&nbsp;and France were becoming powerful monarchies with centralized&nbsp;administration, Poland had remained a weak feudal republic with&nbsp;an elected king chosen under foreign influence and fettered&nbsp;by constitutional restrictions. All political authority was in&nbsp;the hands of turbulent nobles who quarrelled among themselves, who were always inclined to submit the questions at&nbsp;issue to the arbitrament of arms, and who did not scruple to&nbsp;invite foreign powers to intervene on their behalf. The middle&nbsp;classes, which were making other countries rich and powerful,&nbsp;existed only in an embryonic condition. Instead of a well-organized army of the modem type there was merely an&nbsp;undisciplined militia composed almost exclusively of irregular&nbsp;cavalry; and the national defences as a whole were so weak&nbsp;that, in the opinion of such a competent authority as Maurice&nbsp;of Saxony, the country might easily be conquered by a regular&nbsp;army of 48,000 men. Here was a tempting field for the&nbsp;application of Catherine’s aggressive policy, and if she had had&nbsp;to deal merely with the Poles she would have had an easy task.&nbsp;Unfortunately for the success of her schemes she had to reckon&nbsp;with stronger states which were anxious to check the Russian&nbsp;advance, and which were determined, in the event of aggression,&nbsp;to have it share of the plunder. Frederick the Great was at&nbsp;that moment impatient to extend and consolidate his kingdom&nbsp;by getting possession of the basin of the lower Vistula, which&nbsp;separated eastern Prussia from the rest of his dominions, while&nbsp;Austria had also claims on Polish territory and would certainly&nbsp;not submit to be excluded by her two rivals. In these circumstances Catherine hesitated to bring matters to a crisis,&nbsp;but her hand was forced by Frederick, and in 1772 the first&nbsp;partition of Poland took place without any very strenuous&nbsp;resistance on the part of the victim. This national disaster&nbsp;opened the eyes of many Polish patriots to the necessity of&nbsp;changing radically the old order of things, and an attempt was&nbsp;made by them to remove some of the more glaring absurdities&nbsp;of the existing constitution: the throne was declared to be&nbsp;hereditary, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">liberum veto</span><span class="font0"> by which any petty noble could&nbsp;annul the most important decision of the national assembly&nbsp;was abolished, the royal authority was greatly strengthened,&nbsp;and the towns were empowered to send deputies to the Diet&nbsp;(1791). Such salutary reforms were naturally unwelcome to&nbsp;the aggressive neighbours who wished to preserve the traditional&nbsp;anarchy in order to have new facilities for intervention, and&nbsp;as Russia had signed with the puppet-king in 1768 a treaty&nbsp;by which the constitution could not be modified without her&nbsp;consent, she had a plausible ground for protest. She waited,&nbsp;however, until a deputation of the malcontents, who regretted&nbsp;the loss of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">liberum veto</span><span class="font0"> and who were afraid that the party of&nbsp;reform might undertake the emancipation of the serfs, came&nbsp;to St Petersburg and asked for support in defence of the&nbsp;ancient liberties. Then an imperial manifesto reminding the&nbsp;Poles of the treaty of 1768 was issued and a large Russian force&nbsp;entered the Ukraine. This led to the second partition (1793),&nbsp;by which Russia obtained the eastern provinces with three&nbsp;millions of inhabitants. Even now the work of spoliation was&nbsp;not complete. When the patriots under Koscziusko made a&nbsp;desperate effort to recover the national independence the struggle&nbsp;produced a third partition (1795), by which the remainder of the&nbsp;kingdom was again divided between Russia, Prussia and Austria.&nbsp;Thus Poland disappeared for a time from the map of Europe.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
