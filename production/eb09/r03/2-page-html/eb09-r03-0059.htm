            <p><span class="font1">of the long struggle had come at last. The Carthaginian
                    government, despairing of being able to send further aid&nbsp;to their troops in
                    Sicily, authorized Hamilcar to treat for&nbsp;peace. His proposals were accepted
                    by Catulus, and the&nbsp;terms agreed upon between them were confirmed in
                    all&nbsp;essential points by the commissioners sent out from Rome.&nbsp;The
                    Carthaginians agreed to evacuate Sicily and the&nbsp;adjoining islands, to
                    restore all prisoners, and to pay an&nbsp;indemnity of 2300 talents.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font1">In its duration and its severity the First Punic War is justly
                    ranked by Polybius above all other wars of his own&nbsp;and preceding times,
                    though neither in the military talent&nbsp;displayed nor in the importance of
                    its results can it be&nbsp;compared with the war that followed. It was
                    distinguished by no military achievement comparable with&nbsp;Hannibal’s
                    invasion of Italy, and with the single exception of Hamilcar it produced no
                    general of the calibre of&nbsp;Hannibal or Scipio. It was in fact a struggle in
                    which&nbsp;both Rome and Carthage were serving an apprenticeship&nbsp;in a
                    warfare the conditions of which were unfamiliar to&nbsp;both. The Roman legions
                    were foes very unlike any&nbsp;against which the Carthaginian leaders had ever
                    led their&nbsp;motley array of mercenaries, while Rome was called upon&nbsp;for
                    the first time to fight a war across the sea, and to fight&nbsp;with ships
                    against the greatest naval power of the age.&nbsp;The novelty of these
                    conditions accounts for much of the&nbsp;vacillating and uncertain action
                    observable on both sides,&nbsp;and their effect in this direction was increased
                    by the&nbsp;evident doubts felt by both antagonists as to the lengths&nbsp;to
                    which the quarrel should be pushed. It is possible&nbsp;that Hamilcar had
                    already made up his mind that Rome&nbsp;must be attacked and crushed in Italy,
                    but his government attempted nothing more than raids upon the coast.&nbsp;There
                    are indications also that some in the Roman senate&nbsp;saw no end to the
                    struggle but in the destruction of&nbsp;Carthage; yet an invasion of Africa was
                    only once&nbsp;seriously attempted, and then only a halfhearted support&nbsp;was
                    given to the expedition. But these peculiarities in&nbsp;the war served to bring
                    out in the clearest relief the&nbsp;strength and the weakness of the two
                    contending states.&nbsp;The chief dangers for Carthage lay obviously in
                    the&nbsp;jealousy exhibited at home of her officers abroad, in
                    the&nbsp;difficulty of controlling her mercenary troops, and in
                    the&nbsp;ever-present possibility of disaffection among her subjects&nbsp;in
                    Libya,—dangers which even the genius of Hannibal&nbsp;failed finally to
                    surmount. Rome, on the other hand, was&nbsp;strong in the public spirit of her
                    citizens, the fidelity of&nbsp;her allies, the valour and discipline of her
                    legions. What&nbsp;she needed was a system which should make a better
                    use&nbsp;of her splendid materials than one under which her plans&nbsp;were
                    shaped from day to day by a divided senate, and&nbsp;executed by officers who
                    were changed every year, and by&nbsp;soldiers most of whom returned home at the
                    close of each&nbsp;summer’s campaign.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font1">The interval between the First and Second Punic Wars was employed
                    by both Rome and Carthage in strengthening their respective positions. Of the
                    islands lying off the&nbsp;coast of Italy, the most important, Sicily, had
                    fallen to&nbsp;Rome as the prize of the recent war. The eastern end of&nbsp;the
                    island was still left under the rule of King Hiero as&nbsp;the ally of Rome, but
                    the larger western portion became&nbsp;directly subject to Rome, and a temporary
                    arrangement&nbsp;seems to have been made for its government, either by&nbsp;one
                    of the two prætors, or possibly by a quæstor.@@<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>Sardinia and
                    Corsica had not been surrendered to Rome&nbsp;by the treaty of 241, but three
                    years later (238), on the&nbsp;invitation of the Carthaginian mercenaries
                    stationed in&nbsp;the islands, a Roman force occupied them ; Carthage
                    pro-</span></p></div><br clear="all" /><div>
            <p><span class="font1">tested, but, on the Romans threatening war, she gave way, and
                    Sardinia and Corsica were formally ceded to Rome,&nbsp;though it was some seven
                    or eight years before all resistance on the part of the natives themselves was
                    crushed,&nbsp;ln 227, however, the senate considered matters ripe for&nbsp;the
                    establishment of a separate and settled government,&nbsp;not only in Sardinia
                    and Corsica, but also in Sicily. In&nbsp;that year two additional prætors were
                    elected ; to one was&nbsp;assigned the charge of western Sicily, to the other
                    that of&nbsp;Sardinia and Corsica,@@<sup>2</sup> and thus the first stones of
                    the&nbsp;Roman provincial system were laid. Of at least equal&nbsp;importance
                    for the security of the peninsula was the subjugation of the Celtic tribes in
                    the valley of the Po.&nbsp;These, headed by the Boii and Insubres and assisted
                    by&nbsp;levies from the Celts to the westward, had in 225 alarmed&nbsp;the whole
                    of Italy by invading Etruria and penetrating&nbsp;to Clusium, only three days’
                    journey from Rome. Here,&nbsp;however, their courage seems to have failed them.
                    They&nbsp;retreated northward along the Etruscan coast, until at&nbsp;Telamon
                    their way was barred by the Roman legions,&nbsp;returning from Sardinia to the
                    defence of Rome, while a&nbsp;second consular army hung upon their rear.
                    Thus&nbsp;hemmed in, the Celts fought desperately, but were completely defeated
                    and the flower of their tribesmen slain.&nbsp;The Romans followed up their
                    success by invading the&nbsp;Celtic territory. The Boii were easily reduced to
                    submission. The Insubres, north of the Po, resisted more&nbsp;obstinately, but
                    by 222 the war was over, and all the&nbsp;tribes in the rich Po valley
                    acknowledged the supremacy&nbsp;of Rome. The conquered Celts were not enrolled
                    among&nbsp;the Italian allies of Rome, but were treated as subjects&nbsp;beyond
                    the frontier. Three colonies were founded to hold&nbsp;them in check—Placentia
                    and Cremona in the territory ol&nbsp;the Insubres, Mutina in that of the Boii ;
                    and the great&nbsp;northern road (Via Flaminia) was completed as far as
                    the&nbsp;Celtic border at Ariminum.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font1">On the Adriatic coast, where there was no Carthage tc be feared,
                    and no important adjacent islands to be annexed,&nbsp;the immediate interests of
                    Rome were limited to rendering&nbsp;the sea safe for Italian trade. It was with
                    this object&nbsp;that, in 229, the first Roman expedition crossed
                    the&nbsp;Adriatic, and inflicted severe chastisement on the
                    Illyriac&nbsp;pirates of the opposite coast.@@<sup>3</sup> But the results of
                    the&nbsp;expedition did not end here, for it was the means of establishing for
                    the first time direct political relations between&nbsp;Rome and the states of
                    Greece proper, to many of which&nbsp;the suppression of piracy in the Adriatic
                    was of as much&nbsp;importance as to Rome herself. Alliances were
                    concluded&nbsp;with Corcyra, Epidamnus, and Apollonia ; and
                    embassies&nbsp;explaining the reasons which had brought Roman troops&nbsp;into
                    Greece were sent to the Ætolians, the Achæans, and&nbsp;even to Athens and
                    Corinth. Everywhere they were well&nbsp;received, and the admission of the
                    Romans to the Isthmian&nbsp;games@@<sup>4</sup> (228) formally acknowledged them
                    as the natural&nbsp;allies of the free Greek states against both barbarian
                    tribes&nbsp;and foreign despots, a relationship which was destined to&nbsp;prove
                    as useful to Rome in the East as it had already&nbsp;proved itself to be in the
                    West.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font1">While Rome was thus fortifying herself on all sides, Carthage had
                    acquired a possession which promised to&nbsp;compensate her for the loss of
                    Sicily, Sardinia, and Corsica.&nbsp;The genius of her greatest citizen and
                    soldier, Hamilcar&nbsp;Barca, had appreciated the enormous value of the
                    Spanish&nbsp;peninsula, and conceived the scheme of founding there
                    a&nbsp;Carthaginian dominion which should not only add to the&nbsp;wealth of
                    Carthage, but supply her with troops, and with&nbsp;a base of operations for
                    that war of revenge with Rome on&nbsp;which his heart was set. The conquest of
                    southern and&nbsp;eastern Spain, begun by Hamilcar (236-228), and
