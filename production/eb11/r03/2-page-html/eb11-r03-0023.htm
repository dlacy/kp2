<p><span class="font2">James river, at the falls, visited the tract in September 1733, and decided to found there the town of Richmond, at the same&nbsp;time selecting and naming the present site of Petersburg. The&nbsp;name Richmond was suggested probably by the similarity of&nbsp;the site to that of Richmond on the Thames. The settlement&nbsp;was laid out in April 1737 by Major William Mayo </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(c.</span><span class="font2"> 1685-1744),&nbsp;and was incorporated as a town in 1742. The public records&nbsp;of the state were removed thither in 1777 from Williamsburg,&nbsp;and in May 1779 Richmond was made the capital. On the 5th&nbsp;of January 1781 the town was partly burned by a force of about&nbsp;800 British troops under Gen. Benedict Arnold, the 200 or 300&nbsp;Virginians offering little resistance, and much of the damage&nbsp;being done by Lieutenant-Colonel John G. Simcoe’s celebrated&nbsp;Rangers. Richmond was first chartered as a city in 1782, and&nbsp;in 1788 it was allowed a representative in the House of&nbsp;Delegates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The importance of Richmond during the Civil War was principally due to its having been made the capital of the&nbsp;Confederate States (by act of the Provisional Government on the&nbsp;Sth of May 1861). Its nearness to Washington, the material and&nbsp;manufacturing resources concentrated in it, and the moral importance attached to its possession by both sides, caused it to be&nbsp;regarded as the centre of gravity of the military operations in the&nbsp;east to which the greatest leaders and the finest armies were&nbsp;devoted from 1861 to 1865. (See </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">American Civil War.)</span><span class="font2"> The&nbsp;city’s system of defences, which began to take form in May&nbsp;1861, included a line of 17 heavy batteries, completely encircling&nbsp;it at an average distance of about </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">2</span><span class="font2"> m.; another line of smaller&nbsp;batteries and trenches, from about a mile (or less) to about&nbsp;2 m. beyond the heavy batteries and practically unbroken from&nbsp;the north bank of the James (west of the city) to about 1 m. west&nbsp;of that river (south of the city); and the outer works, approximately paralleling the inner line, at distances of from 2 to 3 m.&nbsp;from this line north and east of the city. There was much&nbsp;confusion and lawlessness in Richmond during the earlier stages&nbsp;of the war. The city’s police force was unable to cope with&nbsp;the situation created by the influx of soldiers, gamblers and&nbsp;adventurers, and on the 1st of March 1862 President Davis (by&nbsp;Authority of a secret Act of the Confederate Congress passed on&nbsp;the 2nd of February) declared martial law in the city and the&nbsp;country within a radius of 10 m., suspended the writ of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">habeas&nbsp;corpus,</span><span class="font2"> and appointed General John H. Winder (1800-1865) to&nbsp;enforce military rule. General Winder’s arbitrary exercise of&nbsp;his power was, however, resented so vigorously by the citizens&nbsp;that on the 19th of April the Confederate Congress materially&nbsp;modified the law under which he received these powers from&nbsp;the president. The opening of M'Clellan'S Peninsula Campaign&nbsp;(see </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Yorktown; Seven Days, &amp;c.)</span><span class="font2"> in 1862 caused great apprehension in Richmond, and in May 1862 some of the government&nbsp;records were packed up and preparations made to ship them to&nbsp;a place of safety. The approach of the &quot; Monitor ” and the&nbsp;Union gunboats up the James river caused a partial and&nbsp;temporary panic; President Davis appointed a day for prayer,&nbsp;and the families of some of the cabinet secretaries and many&nbsp;citizens fled the city precipitately; but confidence, restored by</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“ Bacon’s Rebellion,” was auditor-general of the colony from 1687 until his death, and was a member of the committee which founded&nbsp;the College of William and Mary. His residence, within the limits&nbsp;of the present city of Richmond, was preserved until about 1850.&nbsp;His son William (1674-1744), the founder of Richmond—and&nbsp;above referred to—was educated in England; returned to Virginia in 1696; succeeded his father as auditor-general of the colony,&nbsp;and was receiver-general in 1705-1716. In </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">1727 </span><span class="font2">he was appointed&nbsp;one of the commission (of which William Fitzwilliams and William&nbsp;Dandridge were the other members) to mark the boundary between&nbsp;North Carolina and Virginia, concerning which undertaking he&nbsp;wrote (probably in 1737) </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The History of the Dividing Line.</span><span class="font2"> This&nbsp;with his other publications, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">A Journey to the Land of Eden</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">A&nbsp;Progress to the Mines,</span><span class="font2"> was published at Petersburg, Va., in 1841,&nbsp;and again (New York, </span><span class="font0">1901</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">) </span><span class="font2">as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Writings of Colonel William&nbsp;Byrd of Westover in Virginia,</span><span class="font2"> edited by John S. Bassett, and including&nbsp;an extended sketch of the Byrd family. Concerning Byrd’s style as&nbsp;a writer, Professor Bassett says: “ It would behard to find before&nbsp;Franklin a better master of the art of writing clear, forceful and&nbsp;charming English.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">the checking of the fleet at Drewry’s Bluff (Fort Darling), about 8 m. below the city, on the 15th of May 1862, was increased by&nbsp;the battle of Fair Oaks and the Seven Days, after which the&nbsp;Army of the Potomac retreated. Unsuccessful attempts were&nbsp;made in February and March 1864 to free the Federal prisoners&nbsp;in Richmond by means of cavalry raids. The most important&nbsp;of these was that of General H. Judson Kilpatrick, a portion of&nbsp;whose force, under Col. Ulric Dahlgren (b. 1842), was annihilated, Dahlgren being killed (2nd March).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">General U. S. Grant began the final campaign against Richmond in May 1864 (see </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Wilderness</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Petersburg). </span><span class="font2">Sheridan’s cavalry, during the “ Richmond Raid,” carried the&nbsp;city’s outer defences (May 12), but found the river line too strong&nbsp;to be taken by assault and moved away. In June Grant’s&nbsp;army crossed the James and attacked Lee in Petersburg. Then&nbsp;followed many months of unintermittcnt pressure upon both&nbsp;Petersburg and Richmond. General Benjamin F. Butler&nbsp;captured the southern outer line of the Richmond defences on&nbsp;the 29th of September 1864. On the 2nd of April 1865 Petersburg&nbsp;fell. Richmond was evacuated that night, after the ironclads,&nbsp;the bridges and many of the military and tobacco store-houses&nbsp;had been set on fire by order of General R. S. Ewell, so that&nbsp;when the Federal troops, under General Godfrey Weitzel (1835-1884) entered the city on the following morning (3rd April) a&nbsp;serious conflagration was under way, which was not extinguished&nbsp;until about one-third of the city, including several of its historic&nbsp;buildings, had been destroyed. During the war the principal&nbsp;iron foundry of the Confederacy (Tredegar Iron Works) was in&nbsp;Richmond, and here most of the cannon used by the Confederate&nbsp;armies were cast. In 1910 the city of Manchester was annexed.</span></p>

In 1455 she married&nbsp;Edmund Tudor, earl of Richmond, who died in the following&nbsp;year; she then took for her husband Henry (d. 1482), son of&nbsp;Humphrey Stafford, duke of Buckingham, and later Thomas&nbsp;Stanley, afterwards earl of Derby. She was in constant communication with her son, the future king, during his exile in&nbsp;Brittany, and with her husband, Lord Stanley, aided him to&nbsp;gain the crown in 1485. The countess was very pious and&nbsp;charitable, and under the influence of her confessor, John Fisher,&nbsp;afterwards bishop of Rochester, she founded the Lady Margaret&nbsp;professorships of divinity at the universities of Oxford and&nbsp;Cambridge. She completed the foundation of Christ’s College,&nbsp;Cambridge, and after her death, in accordance with her wishes,&nbsp;much of her wealth was devoted to building and endowing&nbsp;St John’s College in the same university. She survived her son,&nbsp;whose title to the English throne was derived through her, and&nbsp;died on the 29th of June 1509. The countess translated some&nbsp;devotional books into English, and Fisher said of her, &quot; All&nbsp;England for her death had cause of weeping.” </span></p>
