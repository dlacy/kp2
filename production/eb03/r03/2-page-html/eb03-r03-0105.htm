<p><span class="font0">eſtimable value. In the midſt of this proceſſion is borne a triumphal arch ; and on the top an apple-tree&nbsp;covered with fruit, which ſeveral little boys incloſed&nbsp;in the machine endeavour to gather. The lawyers and&nbsp;laity carry branches of willow; the guards and the fpec∙∙&nbsp;tutors proſtrate themſelves on the ground while the&nbsp;proceſſion halts ; and after the ceremony, the patriarch&nbsp;preſents a purſe of ιoo rubles to the czar, who perhaps invites him to dine at his table. During the ſeaſon of Eaſter, the whole empire is filled with mirth and&nbsp;rejoicing : which, however, never fails to degenerate&nbsp;into heat and debauchery ; even the ladies may indulge&nbsp;themſelves with ſtrong liquors to intoxication wfithout&nbsp;ſcandal. When a lady ſends to inquire concerning the&nbsp;health of her gueſts whom ſhe entertained over-night,&nbsp;the uſual reply is, “ I thank your miſtreſs for her&nbsp;good cheer : by my troth, I was ſo merry that I don’t&nbsp;remember how I got home.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">During theſe carnivals, a great number of people, in reeling home drunk, fall down and periſh among the&nbsp;fnow. It is even dangerous to relieve a perſon thus&nbsp;overtaken ; for, ſhould he die, the perſon who endeavoured to aſſiſt him is called before the judge, and generally pays dear for his charity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Muſcovite priel⅛ uſe exorciſms at the adminiſtration of baptiſm. They plunge the child three times ever head and ears in water, and give it the ſacrament&nbsp;of the Lord’s Supper in one ſpecies, until it hath attained&nbsp;the age of ſeven; after which the child is indulged with&nbsp;it in both kinds. They likewiſe adminiſter the ſacrament&nbsp;to dying perſons, together with extreme unction ; and&nbsp;if this be neglected, the body is denied Chriſtian burial. Soon as the perſon expires, the body is depoli-ted in a coffin, with a lunehion of bread, a pair of ſhoes,&nbsp;ſome few pieces of money, and a certificate ſigned by&nbsp;the pariſh-prieſt, and directed to St Nicholas, who is&nbsp;one of their great patrons. They likewiſe hold St&nbsp;Andrew in great veneration, and ridſeulouſly pretend&nbsp;they were converted by him to Chriſtianity. But next&nbsp;to St Nicholas, they adore St Anthony of Padua, who&nbsp;is ſuppoſed to have ſailed upon a mill-ſtone through&nbsp;the Mediterranean and Atlantic, and over the lakes&nbsp;Ladoga and Onega, as far as Novogorod. Every houſe&nbsp;is furniſhed with an image of St Nicholas, carved in the&nbsp;moſt rude and fantaſtic manner ; and when it becomes&nbsp;old and worm-eaten, the owner either throws it into&nbsp;the river with a few pieces of coin, faying, “ Adieu,&nbsp;brother or returns it to the maker, who accommodates him with a new image for a proper conſideration.&nbsp;The good women are very careful in adorning their&nbsp;private St Nicholaſes with rich clothes and jewels ; but&nbsp;on any emergency, theſe are relumed, and the faint&nbsp;left as naked as he came from the hand of the carpenter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There are monalteries in Ruſſia ; but neither the monks nor the nuns are ſubject to ſevere reſtrictions.&nbsp;The friare are either horſe-jockeys, or trade in hops,&nbsp;wheat, and other commodities ; the ſiſters are at liberty&nbsp;to go abroad when they pleaſe, and indulge themſelves&nbsp;in all manner of freedoms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Heretofore liberty of conſcience was denied, and every convicted heretic was committed to the flames ;&nbsp;but ſince the reign of Peter, all religions and ſects are&nbsp;tolerated throughout the empire. Roman Catholics,&nbsp;Lutherans, Calvim’ſts, Armenians, Jews, and Maho</span><span class="font1">metans, </span><span class="font0">enjoy </span><span class="font1">the free exerciſe of their </span><span class="font0">reſpective </span><span class="font1">forms</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">of worſhip ; though it was not without </span><span class="font1">great difficulty, </span><span class="font0">and by dint of extraordinary ſolicitation from different&nbsp;powers, that the Romiſh religion was allowed. Peter&nbsp;knowing the dangerous tenets of a religion that might&nbsp;ſet the ſpiritual power of the pope at variance with the&nbsp;temporal power of the emperor, and being well acquainted with the meddling genius of its profeffors,&nbsp;held out for ſome time againſt the interceſſion of Germany, France, and Poland; and though at length he&nbsp;yielded to their joint interpoſition, he would by no means&nbsp;luffer any Jeſuit to enter his dominions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The government of Ruſſia is mere deſpotiſm. The whole empire is ruled by the arbitrary will and plea-ι&nbsp;ſure of the ſovereign, who is ſtyled the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">evar</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">tvcιr,</span><span class="font0"> a&nbsp;title which is probably a corruption of Cæfar. Heretofore he was ſtyled </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">grand duke oſ Muſcovy :</span><span class="font0"> but ſince&nbsp;the reign of Peter, he is dignified with the appellation&nbsp;of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">emperor oſ Ruſſia ;</span><span class="font0"> and the preſent ſovereign is ſtyled&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">empreſs oſ all the Ruſias.</span><span class="font0"> The emperor is abſolute&nbsp;lord, not only of all the eſtates in the empire, but alſo&nbsp;of the lives of his ſubjects; the greateſt noblemen&nbsp;call themſelves his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">flaves,</span><span class="font0"> and execute his commands&nbsp;with the moſt implicit obedience. The common people&nbsp;revere him as ſomething ſupernatural ; they never mention his n⅛nc, or any thing immediately belonging&nbsp;to him, without marks of the moſt profound reſpect&nbsp;and awful veneration. A man aſking a carpenter at&nbsp;work upon one of the czar’s warehouſes, what the&nbsp;place was intended ſor ? anſwered, “ None but God and&nbsp;the czar knows.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The nobility of Ruſſia were formerly rich and powerful, and ruled deſpoticqjly over their inferiors : but we have ſeen how the father of Peter the Great contrived&nbsp;to ſtrip them of their privileges, and they are now venal dependants on the court. They ſtill retain the titles&nbsp;of their anceſtors, though many of them are in the moſt&nbsp;abject poverty and contempt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">All the peaſants in the empire are conſidered as immediate ilaves belonging to the czar, to the bσyars, or to the monaſteries. The value of eſtates is computed,&nbsp;not by the extent or quality of the land, but from the&nbsp;number of thoſe peaſants, who may be fold, alienated,&nbsp;or given away, at the pleaſure of their maſters. The&nbsp;number of theſe huſhandmen, whether living in villages&nbsp;or in the open country, being known, the czar, by requiring a certain proportion of each lord or proprietor,&nbsp;can raiſe 3c0,0c0 men in leſs than 40 days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The adminiſtration is managed by a grand council, called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">dumnοy boyaren<sub>i</sub></span><span class="font0"> or “ council of the boyars,”&nbsp;who are the grandees of the empire, and act as privy&nbsp;counſellors. To this are ſubſervient ſix inferior chambers and courts of judicature, provided each with </span><span class="font1">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">prelident. The firſt regulates every thing relating to&nbsp;ambaſſadors and foreign negociations ; the ſecond takes&nbsp;cognizance of military affairs ; the third manages the&nbsp;public revenues of the empire ; the bufineſs of the fourth&nbsp;is to encourage, protect, and improve trade and commerce. The two laſt hear and determine in all cauſes,&nbsp;whether civil or criminal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Peter divided the empire into the eight governments of Moſcow, Archangel, Afoph, Caſan, Aſtracan, Chioff&nbsp;and the Ukraine, Siberia, Livonia, comprehending&nbsp;Ingria, Pleſcow, and Novogorod, Smolenſko, and Ve-ronitz, The governors or waivodes were veſted with&nbsp;power to diſpoſe of all employments civil and military, and receive the revenues.
