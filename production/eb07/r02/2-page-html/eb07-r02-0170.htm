<p><span class="font0">not himself assume the purple, but gave it to Eugenius, deeming it more safe to possess the power than the name&nbsp;of emperor. Theodosius once more prepared to avenge&nbsp;the murder of an emperor. He raised a powerful army,&nbsp;forced the passes of the Alps, encountered the army of the&nbsp;usurper, and inflicted on him a decisive overthrow. Eugenius was killed by his own defeated troops, and Arbogastes, fearing the just resentment of tlle victor, died by his&nbsp;own hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The whole Roman empire might have been once more reunited under one imperial sovereign, had Theodosius&nbsp;been ambitious of that sole dominion. But being perfectly persuaded of the necessity of an emperor in each&nbsp;of the imperial cities, he assigned to his younger son Honorius the sceptre of the western empire, and associated&nbsp;Arcadius, the elder, with himself in that ofthe east. Scarcely&nbsp;had he completed this arrangement, when his constitution,&nbsp;which had always been feeble, overtasked with the exertions of this campaign and the cares of state, yielded to the&nbsp;shock, and he expired, to the universal regret of the empire, which beheld the splendour of the Roman name passing&nbsp;away with him its last great emperor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Roman world now presented the miserable spectacle of two emperors of such imbecility as to be incapable of&nbsp;conducting the administration of public affairs, in a time of&nbsp;such peril and alarm as would have required the prudence&nbsp;of an Augustus joined to the martial skill and talents of a&nbsp;Cæsar. That Theodosius was not unaware of the feebleness of his two sons, may be conjectured from the fact of&nbsp;his assigning the care of at least the western empire to Stilicho, the master-general of the army. This able general&nbsp;seems to have been a Vandal by origin, but had by his courage and his great abilities raised himself to the highest&nbsp;military fame and station before the death of Theodosius ;&nbsp;and to him that prudent emperor entrusted the guardianship of the empire. In the east, the crafty and avaricious&nbsp;Rufinus enjoyed similar influence over the feeble Arcadius,&nbsp;but without equal merit to sanction his possession of that&nbsp;power. Stilicho governed by the inherent right of commanding genius ; Rufinus by the dark intrigues of a guileful and selfish nature. Stilicho seemed to regard himself&nbsp;as entitled to the supreme care of both empires ; and Rufinus endeavoured to secure his authority in the east by&nbsp;persuading Arcadius to marry his daughter. He was however frustrated by the eunuch Eutropius, a person still more&nbsp;crafty than himself, who induced the young emperor to share&nbsp;his throne with the beautiful and accomplished Eudoxia.&nbsp;In a short time afterwards, Rufinus was killed by the leader&nbsp;of a body of Gothic troops in the confidence of Stilicho,&nbsp;who did not however obtain the ascendancy over Arcadius,&nbsp;being supplanted by the intrigues of Eutropius.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the mean while, a dangerous war broke out in Africa, under the command of Gildo, brother of Firmus, who had&nbsp;been the leader of the last revolt. To suppress this insurrection, Stilicho sent Mascezel, the brother and deadly foe&nbsp;of Gildo. The Romans obtained the victory almost without&nbsp;bloodshed ; and Gildo terminated his days by his own act,&nbsp;in a dungeon into which he had been cast. Mascezel did&nbsp;not long enjoy his victory, having been drowned either&nbsp;by accident, or, as some allege, by the contrivance of&nbsp;Stilicho.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But the fiercest storm that had ever assailed the empire was now ready to burst upon it in its hour of weakness. The&nbsp;Goths had yielded to the arms, and especially to the policy&nbsp;of Theodosius. After the death of Fritigern and of Athan-ric, they had been for some time without a leader able to&nbsp;to combine them into one body. A leader of equal craft&nbsp;and courage now appeared in the famous Alaric, who having succeeded in establishing his authority over his countrymen, only waited for a fair pretext, and a favourable opportunity to put in practice a scheme of greater magnitude and</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">daring than had entered into the mind of any of Rome's assailants since the time of Hannibal. The corrupt and avaricious ministers of Arcadius soon afforded him a pretext sufficiently plausible, by withholding the subsidy paid to&nbsp;the Goths since the agreement with Theodosius. Not&nbsp;deeming the lands of Thrace worth his while, Alaric led&nbsp;his forces into Greece, passed the straits of Thermopylas&nbsp;without opposition, devastated its fairest lands, and plundered Athens, Corinth, Argos, and Sparta. The unwarlike&nbsp;emperor of the east and his effeminate courtiers did not dare&nbsp;to meet the warlike barbarian ; and Stilicho marched against&nbsp;them to rescue Greece from her rude plundererg. The&nbsp;great military genius of Stilicho was soon apparent in the&nbsp;advantage he obtained over the Goths, whom he at length&nbsp;succeeded in driving into a straitened position in Elis,&nbsp;whence it seemed impossible for them to escape. Taking&nbsp;advantage of the relaxation which' security had produced in&nbsp;his antagonists, Alaric forced the lines of circumvallation,&nbsp;crossed the narrow strait at the mouth of the gulph of Lepanto, and resumed his ravages in Epirus. Before Stilicho&nbsp;could again reach his enemy, he received information that&nbsp;the emperor of the east had concluded a peace with Alaric,&nbsp;and had even made him master-general of Illyricum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Stilicho yielded to the unwise policy of Arcadius, and returned to Italy ; but was very speedily recalled to march against his baffled but unvanquished foe. Resolved if possible to make himself master of the western empire, Alaric&nbsp;crossed the Julian Alps, and marched rapidly towards Milan,&nbsp;where Honorius held his court. Stilicho hastened to recruit&nbsp;his army and to defend the empire ; but before his preparations were complete, the swift march of Alaric compelled&nbsp;Honorius to fly from Milan. In his flight he was almost&nbsp;surrounded by the Goths, and took refuge in Asta, where&nbsp;he was immediately besieged. Stilicho hastened to the&nbsp;rescue of the emperor ; and gained a great, but not decisive victory over Alaric at Pollentia. Rallying the remains&nbsp;of his shattered army, Alaric quitted the scene of his defeat, and marched furiously to Rome, determined to wreak&nbsp;his vengeance on that proud city, or to perish at its gates.&nbsp;But Stilicho at the head of a chosen body of his army hastened with scarcely less swiftness to the relief of the threatened capital, and arrived in time to protect it from the rage&nbsp;of Alaric. He did not however deem it safe to force hi»&nbsp;antagonist to a battle, dreading perhaps the almost invincible energies of a brave enemy’s resolute despair ; and&nbsp;thought it preferable to purchase his retreat, though at the&nbsp;expense of a very large sum of money.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Though frustrated in this attempt, Alaric did not relinquish his intention of making himself master of the western empire. He retreated towards Gaul, and attempted to seize&nbsp;Verona, intending to retain it as an open door by which to&nbsp;invade Italy when he should be supported by the strength&nbsp;of Gaul. Stilicho being apprised of his intention, followed,&nbsp;beset, and brought him to an engagement at Verona, and&nbsp;inflicted on him a second great overthrow, but could not&nbsp;prevent his escape, with a spirit undismayed, and a resolution only confirmed of implacable hostility to Rome. After this deliverance, Honorius went to Rome to enjoy the&nbsp;honours of a triumph ; but tllis timid prince was not satisfied with a residence in any city which was exposed to the&nbsp;dangers of invasion. He therefore withdrew to Ravenna,&nbsp;a small fortified town on the banks of one of the mouths of&nbsp;the Po, deemed inpregnable from its situation ; and here he&nbsp;determined to fix his imperial residence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Another enemy now appeared to summon forth afresh the energies of the brave and indefatigable Stilicho. This&nbsp;was another combined host of roving nations, chiefly Vandals, Alani, Suevi, and Burgundians, under the command&nbsp;of Radagaisus. On their march a large body of this moving mass separated, and entered Gaul ; while the rest under their chief entered Italy and laid siege to Florence.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
