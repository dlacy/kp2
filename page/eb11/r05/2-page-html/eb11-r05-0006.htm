<p><span class="font0">The geographical distribution is cosmopolitan, as is the case with Protozoa and Protophyta of similar habits.

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History and Bibliography.—</span><span class="font0">As rotifers are common in ponds, the first workers with the microscope observed them repeatedly, the first&nbsp;record being that of John Harris in 1696, who found a Bdelloid in a&nbsp;gallipot that had been standing in his window. Leeuwenhoek found&nbsp;and described some tubicolous species; and during the 18th century a&nbsp;fair number of species were observed, figured and described with&nbsp;names. During this time the illusion of a wheel or wheels produced&nbsp;by the ciliary action of the disk had puzzled all observers. C. E.&nbsp;Ehrenberg included the Rotifers in his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Infusionsthiere,</span><span class="font0"> and described&nbsp;and figured with fair precision many of the genera and species.&nbsp;Dujardin gave a less detailed but more accurate account under the&nbsp;name of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Zoophytes Systolides.</span><span class="font0"> The next full work was a valuable&nbsp;compilation by W. C. Williamson (best known as a botanist) in&nbsp;Pritchard’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Infusoria,</span><span class="font0"> in 1861. Much work was done with the&nbsp;gradual introduction of improved methods during the last forty&nbsp;years of the century. The discovery and recognition of the males&nbsp;was made, however, at the close of the fifties. P. H. Gosse collected&nbsp;and described many species, and elucidated the structure of the&nbsp;mastax in 1856. Zoologists of the standing of Huxley, Claus and&nbsp;Leydig added to our knowledge of the anatomy and to the theory&nbsp;of their relations. But the monumental monograph of C. T.&nbsp;Hudson and Gosse containing a new classification, an illustrated&nbsp;description of all the then known species and much information&nbsp;on habits and structure, provided students with an easy access to&nbsp;the domain and stimulated many to work hard at the group. Of&nbsp;these new-comers we may cite C. F. Rousselet, who has found many&nbsp;new. species and many unknown males of known species, elucidated&nbsp;habits and faithfully kept record of the publications on the class&nbsp;in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Journal</span><span class="font0"> of the Royal Microscopical Society. He has moreover&nbsp;elaborated a method for preserving Rotifera for microscopic observation, so that the types ot each observer are now as readily available&nbsp;for comparison as the plant-specimens of the botanist’s herbarium.&nbsp;C. Zelinka has given us the most detailed anatomical accounts we&nbsp;possess for several Bdelloidaccae, and was the first to utilize modern&nbsp;methods of microscopic technique on a complete scale.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">ROTORUA, a town of Rotorua county, North Island, New Zealand. It lies in the midst of a remarkable volcanic district&nbsp;generally known as the Hot Spring district, or fancifully as the&nbsp;Wonderland, which covers an area of 660 sq. m. and extends&nbsp;160 m. from N.E. to S.W. from White Island, an active volcanic&nbsp;cone in the Bay of Plenty to the mountains of Tongariro,&nbsp;Ngaruhoe and Ruapehu in the interior of the island, S.W. of&nbsp;lake Taupo. Rotorua attracts many visitors on account of&nbsp;the beauty and scientific interest of the locality and the bathing&nbsp;in its various medicinal springs. It is a scattered township lying on the south-western shore of lake Rotorua, amid&nbsp;hills reaching 2600 ft. in the immediate neighbourhood, and&nbsp;much of the volcanic soil supports a rich growth of forest&nbsp;or “ bush.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The springs arc principally alkaline, alkaline and siliceous, acidic, or acidic and hepatic (sulphurous). The township includes the&nbsp;Maori village of Ohinemutu, an interesting collection of native&nbsp;dwellings, whose inmates constantly use the numerous rudely&nbsp;excavated baths which are fed by springs varying in temperature&nbsp;from 6o° F. to the boiling-point, and are in some cases used for&nbsp;cooking. In the vicinity, on the lake-shore, is the government&nbsp;sanatorium. Two miles south of Rotorua is another native village,&nbsp;Whakarewarewa, where there are geysers as well as hot . springs&nbsp;Four miles from Rotorua, near the centre of the lake, the island of&nbsp;Mokuia rises, to 1518 ft. It is. partly under , grass and partly&nbsp;wooded, and is inhabited by Maoris, by whom it is regarded as holy&nbsp;ground. A short channel connects lake Rotorua with lake Rotoiti&nbsp;to the N.E. At the eastern end steep cliffs rise from the water,&nbsp;and luxuriant vegetation covers the bills. Both this lake and the&nbsp;smaller ones to the east, Rotoehu and Rotoma, have deeply indented&nbsp;shores, and are set in exquisite scenery. The group is known&nbsp;collectively as the Cold Lakes. The waters of Rotoma are of a&nbsp;particularly vivid blue. . To the south of Rotoiti is Tikitere, a&nbsp;sombre valley abounding in mud volcanoes, springs and other active&nbsp;volcanic phenomena. Mount Tarawera (16 m. S.E. of Rotorua) is&nbsp;noted for the eruption of June 1886, which changed the outline of&nbsp;several lakes, destroyed the famous Pink and . White terraces on&nbsp;the adjoining lake Tarawera, and converted a region of great beauty&nbsp;into a desolate wilderness. A fissure was formed extending nearly&nbsp;9 m. along the axis of the disturbance, and the mission station&nbsp;of Wairoa (8 m. from Rotorua) on the western shore of the lake was&nbsp;overwhelmed. A line of craters is seen to the south-west. The&nbsp;large lakes Okataina, Kahahi and Rerewhakaitu lie respectively N.,&nbsp;W. and S.E. of lake Tarawera.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROTROU, JEAN DE (1609-1650), French tragic poet, was born on the 19th or 20th of August 1609, at Dreux in Normandy.&nbsp;Rotrou studied at Dreux and at Paris, and, though three years&nbsp;younger than Corneille, began play-writing before him. In&nbsp;1632 he became playwright • to the actors of the Hôtel de&nbsp;Bourgogne. With few exceptions, the only events recorded of&nbsp;his life are the successive appearances of his plays and his&nbsp;enrolment in 1635 in the band of five poets who had the duty&nbsp;of turning Richelieu’s dramatic ideas into shape. Rotrou’s&nbsp;own first piece, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">VHypocondriaque</span><span class="font0"> (pr. 1631), dedicated to the&nbsp;Comte de Soissons, seigneur of Dreux, appeared when he was&nbsp;only eighteen. In the same year he published a collection of&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Œuvres poétiques^</span><span class="font0"> including elegies, epistles and religious verse.&nbsp;His second piece, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">La Bague de l’oubli</span><span class="font0"> (pr. 1635), <sup>an</sup> adaptation&nbsp;in part from the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sortija del Olvido</span><span class="font0"> of Lope de Vega, was much&nbsp;more characteristic. It is the first of several plays in which&nbsp;Rotrou endeavoured to naturalize in France the romantic&nbsp;comedy which had flourished in Spain and England instead of&nbsp;the classical tragedy of Seneca and the classical comedy of&nbsp;Terence. Corneille had leanings in the same direction. Rotrou’s&nbsp;brilliant but hasty and unequal work showed throughout marks&nbsp;of a stronger adhesion to the Spanish model. In 1634, when he&nbsp;printed </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Cleagênor et Doristée</span><span class="font0"> (acted 1630), he said he was already&nbsp;the author of thirty pieces; but this applies no doubt to adaptations. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Diane</span><span class="font0"> (acted 1630; pr. 1633), </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Les Occasions perdues&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(acted 1631 ; pr. 1635), which won for him the favour of Richelieu,&nbsp;and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">VHeureuse Constance</span><span class="font0"> (acted 1631; pr. 1635), which was&nbsp;praised by Anne of Austria, succeeded each other rapidly&nbsp;and were all in the Spanish manner. In 1631 Rotrou imitated&nbsp;Plautus in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Les Menechmes</span><span class="font0"> (pr. 1636), and in 1634 Seneca in&nbsp;his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hercule mourant</span><span class="font0"> (pr. 1636). Comedies and tragi-comedies&nbsp;followed. Documents exist showing the sale of four pieces to&nbsp;Antoine de Sommarille for 750 </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">livres tournois</span><span class="font0"> in 1636, and in the&nbsp;next year he sold ten to the same bookseller. He spent much&nbsp;■ time at Le Mans with his patron, M. de Belin, who was one of the&nbsp;opponents of Corneille in the quarrel of the Cid. It has been&nbsp;generally assumed, partly because of a forged letter long accepted&nbsp;as Corneille’s, that Rotrou was his generous defender in this&nbsp;matter. He appears to have been no more than neutral, but&nbsp;is credited with an attempt at reconciliation between the parties&nbsp;in a pamphlet printed in 1637, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">L’lncognu et véritable amy de&nbsp;messieurs de Scudéry et Corneille.</span><span class="font0"> M. de Belin died in 1637,</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
