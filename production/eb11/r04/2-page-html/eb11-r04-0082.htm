One of the main roads up to&nbsp;the Palatine passes under the arched substructures of Severus, and&nbsp;near this, at the foot of the hill, at the south angle, Septimius&nbsp;Severus built an outlying part of his palace, a building of great&nbsp;splendour called the Septizodium,<sup>@@1</sup> or House of the Seven Planets.&nbsp;Part of the Septizodium existed as late ¿is the reign of Sixtus V.&nbsp;(1585-90), who destroyed it in order to use its marble decorations&nbsp;and columns in the new basilica of St Peter; drawings </span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font2">it are&nbsp;given by Du P6rac, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vestigj di Roma</span><span class="font2"> (1575), pi. 13, and in other works&nbsp;of that century.<sup>@@2</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The name Palatium seems to have originally denoted the southern height of the Palatine hill, while the summit overlooking the Vela-brum was called Cermalus, and the saddle connecting the&nbsp;Palatine and the Esquiline on which the temple of Venus&nbsp;and Rome and the arch of Titus now stand bore the&nbsp;name Velia.<sup>@@3</sup> It is evident that this was once higher than it is now;&nbsp;a great part of it was cut away when the level platform for the&nbsp;temple of Venus and Rome was formed. The foundations of part&nbsp;of Nero’s palace along the road between this temple and the&nbsp;Esquiline are exposed for about 20 to 30 ft. in height, showing a&nbsp;corresponding lowering of. the level here, and the bare tufa rock,&nbsp;cut to a flat surface, is visible on the site of Hadrian’s great temple;&nbsp;that the Velia was once much loftier is also indicated by the story</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">of the removal of Valerius Publicola’s dwelling.<sup>@@4</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The arch of Titus, erected in memory of that emperor’s subjugation of the Jews, but not completed until after his death, stands at the pcint where the Sacra Via crosses the Velia;&nbsp;it is possible that it once stood farther to the east and&nbsp;was removed to its present position when the temple of</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Venus and Rome was built. The well-known reliefs of the archway depict the Jewish triumph and the spoils of the Temple. In the&nbsp;middle ages the arch was converted into a fortress by the Frangipani;&nbsp;their additions were removed and the arch restored in its present&nbsp;shape in 1821.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">On the Velia and the adjoining Summa Sacra Via were the temples of the Lares and Penates which Augustus rebuilt.<sup>@@5</sup> The “ Aedes&nbsp;Larum ’’ is probably distinct from the “ Sacellum Larum ”&nbsp;mentioned by Tacitus G4ww. xii. 24) as one of the points&nbsp;in the line of the original pomerium. The temple of</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Jupiter Stator, traditionally vowed by Romulus during his repulse by the Sabines (Liv. i. 12), stood near the Porta Mugonia,&nbsp;and therefore near the road leading up to the Palatine&nbsp;Sacra Via.<sup>@@6</sup> To the south-east of the arch of Titus (see&nbsp;Plan) are the remains of a concrete podium which may&nbsp;have belonged to this temple in its latest form; and Comm. Boni&nbsp;discovered (in 1907) some early tufa walling close to the above-named arch in which he recognized the foundations of the earlv&nbsp;temple. Augustus rebuilt the. temple of Victory, which&nbsp;gave its name to the Clivus Victoriae; this temple stood&nbsp;on the site of a prehistoric altar (Dionys. i. 32), and was&nbsp;more than once rebuilt,—e.g. by L. Postumius, 294 B.c. (Liv. x. 33).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In 193 </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.</span><span class="font2"> an aedicula to Victory was built near it by M. Porcius Cato (Liv. xxxv. 9). Remains of the temple and a dedicatory&nbsp;inscription were found in 1728<sup>@@7 </sup>not far from the church of&nbsp;S. Teodoro; the. temple was of Parian marble, with Corinthian&nbsp;columns of Numidian giallo antico. The Sacra Via started at the&nbsp;Sacellum Streniae, an unknown point on the Esquiline, probably&nbsp;in the valley of the Colosseum (Varro, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">L.L. v.</span><span class="font2"> 47), in the quarter&nbsp;called Cerolia. Thence it probably (in later times) passed round&nbsp;part of the Colosseum to the slope leading up to the arch of Titus&nbsp;on the Velia; this piece of its course is lined on one side by remains&nbsp;of private houses, and farther back, against the cliff of the Palatine,&nbsp;are the substructures of the Area Apollinis. From the arch of&nbsp;Titus or Summa Sacra Via the original line of the road has been&nbsp;altered, probably when the temple of Venus and Rome was built&nbsp;by Hadrian. Its later course passed at a sharp angle from the arch</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2">of Titus to the front of Constantine’s basilica, and on past the temple of Faustina. It is uncertain, whether the continuation of&nbsp;this road to the arch of Severus was in later times called the Sacra&nbsp;Via or whether it rejoined its old line along the Basilica Julia by&nbsp;the cross-road in front of the Aedes Julii. Its original line past&nbsp;the temple of Vesta was completely built over in the 3rd and 4th&nbsp;centuries, and clumsily fitted pavements of marble and travertine&nbsp;occupy the place of the old basalt blocks.<sup>@@8</sup> The course of the&nbsp;Nova Via@@9(see Plan) along the north-east slope of the Palatine<sup>@@10&nbsp;</sup>was exposed in 1882-84. According to Varro (L.L. vi. 50) it was a&nbsp;very old road. It led up from tne Velabrum, probably winding&nbsp;along the slope of the Palatine, round the north angle above the&nbsp;church of S. Maria Antiqua. The rest of its course, gently ascending&nbsp;towards the arch of Titus, is now exposed, as arc also the stairs&nbsp;which connected it with the Clivus Victoriae at the northern angle&nbsp;of the Palatine; a continuation of these stairs led down to the&nbsp;Forum.<sup>@@11</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The extent of the once marshy Velabrum (Gr. féXos) is not known, though part of its site is indicated by the church of S. Giorgio in&nbsp;Velabro; Varro (L.L. vi. 24) says, “ extra urbem antiquam&nbsp;fuit, non longe a porta Romanula.” It was a district full of&nbsp;shops (Plaut. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Capt.</span><span class="font2"> 489; Hor. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sat.</span><span class="font2"> ii. 3, 30). The Vicus&nbsp;Tuscus on its course from the Forum to the Circus skirted the&nbsp;Velabrum (Dionys. v. 26), from which the goldsmiths’ arch was an&nbsp;entrance into the Forum Boarium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">From the S.W. end of the Velabrum the Clivus Victoriae rose in a gradual ascent along the slope of the Palatine and ultimately&nbsp;wound round the northern angle.</span></p>
