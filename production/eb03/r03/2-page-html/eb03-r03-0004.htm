<p><span class="font0">worfe. We have already ſeen, that when the weight of a ſquare yard of covering is given, </span><span class="font1">a </span><span class="font0">ſteeper roof&nbsp;requires ſtronger rafters, and that when the ſeantling of&nbsp;■the timbers is alſo given, tlιe relative ſtrength of a rafter&nbsp;is inverſely as its length. But there is now another circumſtance to be taken into the account, viz. the ſupport&nbsp;which one rafter leg gives to the other. The beſt form&nbsp;of a rafter will therefore be that in which the relative&nbsp;■ſtrength of the legs, and their mutual ſupport, give the&nbsp;greateſt product. Mr Muller, in his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Military Engineer,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">gives a determination of the beſt pitch of a roof, which&nbsp;has conſiderable ingenuity, and has been copied into&nbsp;many books of military education both in this iſland&nbsp;and on the continent. Deſcribe on the width A C,&nbsp;ſig. 13. the ſemicircle AFC, and biſect it by the radius&nbsp;F D. Produce the rafter A B to the circumference&nbsp;in E, join EC, and draw the perpendicular E G.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Now A B : AD = A C : A E, and AE = </span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:line-through;">Λ¾Δ<sup>c</sup>, </span><span class="font1">A 13</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">and AE is inverſely as AB, and may therefore repre-ſent its ſtrength in relation to the weight actually lying «η it.' Alſo the ſupport which CB gives to AB is as&nbsp;CE, becauſe CE is perpendicular to AB. Therefore&nbsp;the form which renders A E × E C a maximum ſeems&nbsp;to be that which has the greateſt ſtrength. But A C :</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">AE E C</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A E = E C : E G, and E G=—</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:line-through;">~ſſlg</span><span class="font0">—» <sup>an</sup>^ is therefore proportional to AE.EC. Now E G is a maximum when B is in F, and a ſquare pitch is in this reſpect&nbsp;the ſtrongeſt. But it is very doubtful whether this conſtruction is deduced from juſt principles. There is another ſtrain to which the leg A B is expoſed, which is&nbsp;not taken into the account. This ariſes from the curvature which it unavoidably acquires by the tranſverſe&nbsp;preſſure of its load. In this ſtate it is preſſed in its&nbsp;own direction by the abutment and load of the other&nbsp;leg. The relation between this ſtrain and the reſiſtance&nbsp;of the piece is not very diſtinctly known. Euler has&nbsp;given a diſſertation on this ſubject (which is of great&nbsp;importance, becauſe it affects poſts and pillars of all&nbsp;kinds ; and it is very well known that a poſt of ten feet&nbsp;long and fix inches ſquare will bear with great ſafety a&nbsp;weight which would cruſh a poſt of the ſame ſeantling&nbsp;and 20 feet long in a minute) ; but his determination&nbsp;has not been acquieſced in by the firſt mathematicians.&nbsp;Now it is in relation to theſe two ſtrains that the ſtrength&nbsp;of the rafter ſhould be adjuſted. The ſineneſs of the&nbsp;ſupport given by the other leg is of no conſequence, if&nbsp;its own ſtrength is inferior to the ſtrain. The force&nbsp;which tends to cruſh the leg A B, by compreſſing it in&nbsp;its curved ſtate, is to its weight as A B to B D, as is&nbsp;eaſily ſeen by the compoſition of forces; and its incurvation by this force has a relation to it, which is of intricate determination. It is contained in the properties&nbsp;demonſtrated by Bernoulli of the elaſtic curve. This&nbsp;determination alſo includes the relation between the curvature and the length of the piece. But the whole of&nbsp;this ſeemingly ſimple problem is of much more difficult&nbsp;inveſtigation than Mr Muller was aware of ; and his&nbsp;rules for the pitch of a roof, and for the ſally of a dock&nbsp;gate, which depends on the ſame principles, are of no&nbsp;value. He is, however, the firſt author who attempted&nbsp;to ſolve either of theſe problems on mechanical principles ſuſceptible of preciſe reaſoning. Belidor’s ſolu-⅞ions, in his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Architecture Hydraulique<sub>t</sub></span><span class="font1"> are below notice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Reaſqns of ’economy have made carpenters prefer a low pitch ; and although this does diminiſh the ſup-port given by the oppoſite leg falter than it increaſes&nbsp;the relative ſtrength of the other, this is not 9f material conſequence, becauſe the ſtrength remaining in the&nbsp;oppoſite leg is ſtill very great ; for the ſupporting leg&nbsp;is acting againſt compreſſion, in which caſe it is vaſtly&nbsp;ſtronger than the ſupported leg acting againſt a tranſverſe ſtrain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But a roof of this ſimplicity will not do in moſt caſes. There is no notice taken in its conſtruction of the thruſt&nbsp;which it exerts on the walls. Now this is the ſtrain&nbsp;which is the moſt hazardous of all. Our ordinary walls,&nbsp;inſtead of being able to reſiſt any conſiderable ſtrain&nbsp;preſſing them outwards, require, in general, ſome ties&nbsp;to keep them on foot. When a perſon thinks of the&nbsp;thinneſs and height of the walls of even a ſtrong houſe,&nbsp;he will be ſurpriſed that they are uot blown down by&nbsp;any ſtrong puff of wund. A wall of three feet thick,&nbsp;and 60 feet high, could not withſtand a wind blowing&nbsp;at the rate of 30 feet </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">per</span><span class="font0"> ſecond (in which caſe it acts&nbsp;with a force conſiderably exceeding two pounds on every&nbsp;ſquare foot), if it were not ſtiſſened by croſs walls, joiſts,&nbsp;and roof, which all help to tie the different parts of the&nbsp;building together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A carpenter is therefore exceedingly careful to avoid every horizontal thruſt, or to oppoſe them by other<sup>i&nbsp;</sup>forces. And this introduces another eſſential part into&nbsp;the conſtruction of a roof, namely the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">tie</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">beam</span><span class="font0"> A C,&nbsp;(<sup>fi</sup>ff∙ 14.), laid from wall to wall, binding the feet A&nbsp;and C of the rafters together. This is the ſole office qf&nbsp;the beam ; and it ſhould be conſidered in no other light&nbsp;than as a firing to prevent the roof from puffing out the&nbsp;walls. It is indeed uſed for carrying the ceiling of the&nbsp;apartments under it ; and it is even made to ſupport </span><span class="font1">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">flooring. But, conſidered as making part of a roof, it&nbsp;is merely a ſtring ; and the ſtrain which it w<sup>,</sup>ithftandp&nbsp;tends to tear its parts aſunder. It therefore acts with&nbsp;its whole abſolute force, and a very ſmall ſeantling would&nbsp;ſuffice if we could contrive to faſten it firmly enough to&nbsp;the foot of the rafter. If it is of oak, we may ſafely&nbsp;ſubject it to a ſtrain of three tons for every ſquare inch&nbsp;of its ſection. And fir will ſafely bear a ſtrain of two&nbsp;tons for every ſquare inch. But we are obliged to give&nbsp;the tie-beam much larger dimenſions, that we may be&nbsp;able to connect it with the foot of the rafter by a mor-tiſe and tenon. Iron ſtraps are alſo frequently added.&nbsp;By attending to this office of the tie-beam, the judicious carpenter is directed to the proper form of the mor-tiſe and tenon and of the ſtrap. We ſhall eonſider both&nbsp;of theſe in a proper place, after we become acquainted&nbsp;with the various ſtrains at the joints of a roof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Theſe large dimenſions of the tie-beam allow us to load it with the ceilings without any riſk, and even to&nbsp;lay floors on it with moderation and caution. But&nbsp;when it has a great bearing or ſpan, it is very apt to&nbsp;bend downwards in the middle, or, as the workmen term&nbsp;it, to ſway or ſwag ; and it requires a ſupport. The&nbsp;queſtion is, where to find this ſupport ? What fixed&nbsp;points can we find with which to connect the middle of&nbsp;the tie-beam ? Some ingenious carpenter thought of&nbsp;ſuſpending it from the ridge by a piece of timber B D&nbsp;(fig. 15.), called by our carpenters the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">kiηg-poft.</span><span class="font0"> It&nbsp;muſt be acknowledged that there was great ingenuity&nbsp;in this thought. It was alſo perfectly juſt.
