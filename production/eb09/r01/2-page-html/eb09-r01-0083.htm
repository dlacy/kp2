<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The town was first built in 1753 by Aloung-blioora, the founder of the Burmese monarchy. On the outbreak of the first Burmese&nbsp;War, in 1824, it was taken by the British, but subsequently restored&nbsp;to the native power. It was captured a second time in 1852 and&nbsp;passed along with the province of Pegu into the hands of the&nbsp;British. The town was destroyed by fire in 1850, and serious&nbsp;conflagrations occurred again in 1853 and 1855. Since the last&nbsp;devastation Rangoon has undergone considerable improvements;&nbsp;among the latest may be mentioned the construction of steam&nbsp;tramways in the principal thoroughfares and the establishment&nbsp;of a volunteer fire brigade.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">RANGPUR, a district of British India, in the lieutenant-governorship of Bengal, lying between 25° 3' and 26° 19' N. lat. and 88° 47' and 89° 56' E. long., is bounded&nbsp;on the N. by Jalpdiguri district and Kuch Behar state,&nbsp;on the E. by the Brahmaputra, separating it from Goalpara&nbsp;and Maimansinh, on the S. by Bogra, and on the W. by&nbsp;Dinajpur and JalpAiguri. The district is one vast plain ;&nbsp;the greater part of it, particularly towards the east, is inundated during the rains, and the remainder is traversed&nbsp;by a network of streams which frequently break through&nbsp;their sandy banks and ])lough for themselves new channels&nbsp;over the fields. Agricultural industry has taken full&nbsp;advantage of the natural fertility of the soil, which is&nbsp;composed of a sandy loam. The river system is constituted&nbsp;by the Brahmaputra and its tributaries, chief of which are&nbsp;the Tista, Dharla, Sankos, and Dudhkumar. There are&nbsp;no embankments or artificial canals in the district, nor&nbsp;does the alluvial soil produce any minerals. The climate&nbsp;of Rangpur is generally malarious owing to the numerous&nbsp;stagnant swamps and marshes filled with decaying vegetable matter. The average annual rainfall is 86 T 4 inches.&nbsp;The Northern Bengal State Railway cuts through the&nbsp;western half of the district from north to south, with a&nbsp;branch to Rangpur town.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">In 1881 the population was 2,097,964 (males 1,067,701, females 1,030,263); Hindus numbered 816,532, Mohammedans 1,279,605,&nbsp;and Christians 86. The population is for the most part rural; the&nbsp;only towns containing upwards of 10,000 inhabitants are </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rangpur,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">the capital (</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">q.v</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">.), Barakhatta (11,393), Bliogdabari (10,892), and&nbsp;Dimlah (10,503). The district contains an area of 3486 square&nbsp;miles, Sbout three-fourths being under continuous cultivation. The&nbsp;staple crops are rice, wheat, and other grains, oil-seeds, and jute ;&nbsp;among the miscellaneous crops are indigo, sugar-cane, betel-leaf,&nbsp;betel-nut, and mulberry for silkworms. Spare land capable of&nbsp;cultivation can hardly be said to exist,—even the patches of waste&nbsp;land yield a valuable tribute of reeds and cane. Of industries the&nbsp;chief is the manufacture of paper from jute fibre ; other products&nbsp;are striped cotton carpets, silk cloth woven from the cocoon of a&nbsp;worm fed on the castor-oil plant, baskets and mats, brass-ware,&nbsp;and ornaments carved in ivory and buffalo horn. In 1883-84 the&nbsp;gross revenue of Rangpur district was £165,165, of which the land-tax contributed £102,248.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The tract comprised within the district of Rangpur was formerly the western outpost of the ancient Hindu kingdom of Kamrup.&nbsp;The realm appears to have attained its greatest power and prosperity&nbsp;under Raja Nilambhar, who was treacherously overthrown by Husain&nbsp;Shah, king of Bengal, at the close of the 15tli century. On the&nbsp;conquest of the kingdom of Bengal about 1542 by the renowned&nbsp;Afghan Sher Shah, subsequently emperor of Delhi, Rangpur&nbsp;appears to have become incorporated with the empire. During&nbsp;the turbulent period which followed the death of Sher Shah it&nbsp;threw off allegiance to Delhi, but the country was re-annexed by&nbsp;Akbar in 1584, though it was not completely subjugated till the&nbsp;time of Aurangzeb, about 1661. Rangpur passed to the East&nbsp;India Company in 1765 under the firman of the emperor Shah&nbsp;Alam. Numerous changes have since taken place in the jurisdiction,&nbsp;in consequence of which the district area has been much diminished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">RANGPUR, principal town and administrative headquarters of the above district, is situated on the north bank of the Ghaghat river in 25° 44' N. lat. and 89° 17' E.&nbsp;long., and contains a population (1881) of 13,320.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">RANKINE, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">William John Macquorn </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(1820-1872), a descendant of old Scottish families, the Rankines of&nbsp;Garrick and the Cochranes of Dundonald by the father’s&nbsp;side, and the Grahames of Dougalston by the mother’s,</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">was born at Edinburgh in 1820, and completed his education in its university. He was trained as an engineer under Sir J. Macneill, working chiefly on surveys, harbours, and&nbsp;railroads, and was appointed in 1855 to the chair of civil&nbsp;engineering in Glasgow, vacant by the resignation of&nbsp;Lewis Gordon, whose work he had undertaken during the&nbsp;previous session.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">He was a voluminous writer on subjects directly connected with his chair, and, besides contributing almost weekly to the technical journals, such as the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Engineer,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">brought out a series of standard text-books on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Civil&nbsp;Engineering</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Steam-Engine and other Prime Movers,&nbsp;Machinery and Millwork,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Applied Mechanics.</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> These&nbsp;have passed through many editions, have done more for&nbsp;the advancement of their subjects than any works of&nbsp;modern date, and are still in the very highest rank of&nbsp;educational works. To these must be added his elaborate&nbsp;treatise on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Shipbuilding, Theoretical and Practical.</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> This&nbsp;how<sup>r</sup>ever, corresponded ־to but one phase of Rankine’s&nbsp;immense energy and many-sided character. He was an&nbsp;enthusiastic and most useful leader of the volunteer movement from its commencement, and a writer, composer, and&nbsp;singer of humorous and patriotic songs, some of which, as&nbsp;“The Three Foot Rule” and “They never shall have&nbsp;Gibraltar,” became well known far beyond the circle of&nbsp;his acquaintance. Rankine w<sup>T</sup>as the earliest of the three&nbsp;founders of the modern science of </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Thermodynamics </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.)</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> on&nbsp;the bases laid by Sadi Carnot and Joule respectively, and&nbsp;the author of the first formal treatise on the subject. His&nbsp;contributions to the theories of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Elasticity</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> and of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Waves</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> rank&nbsp;high among modern developments of mathematical physics,&nbsp;although they are mere units among the 150 scientific&nbsp;papers attached to his name in the Royal Society’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Catalogue.</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> The more important of these have been collected&nbsp;and reprinted in a handsome volume </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Rankine’s Scientific&nbsp;Papers,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> London, 1881), which contains a memoir of the&nbsp;author, written by Professor Tait. Rankine died in 1872.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">RANPUR, a native state of India, in the province of Orissa in the lieutenant-governorship of Bengal, situated&nbsp;on the western boundary of the British district of Puri,&nbsp;in about 20° N. lat. and 85° 20' E. long. The southwest part of the state is a region of hills, forest clad, and&nbsp;almost entirely uninhabited, which wall in its wdiole western&nbsp;side, except at a single point, where a pass leads into the&nbsp;adjoining state of Nayagarh. Its population in 1881 was&nbsp;36,539 (18,382 males, 18,157 females). The only town&nbsp;is the rfij&amp;’s place of residence, which consists of one long&nbsp;and wide street.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">RANUNCULUS. Familiarly known as “buttercups,” the species of this genus form the type of the order&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ranunculacese.</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> The plants are herbs, sometimes with fleshy&nbsp;root-fibres, or with the base of the stem dilated into a kind&nbsp;of tuber </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(R. bulbosus).</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> They have tufted or alternate&nbsp;leaves, dilated into a sheath at the base and very generally,&nbsp;but not universally, deeply divided above. The flowers are&nbsp;solitary, or in loose cymes, and are remarkable for the number and distinctness (freedom from union) of their parts.&nbsp;Thus there are five sepals, as many petals arranged in&nbsp;whorls, numerous stamens, and numerous carpels arranged&nbsp;in spires. The petals have a little pit or gland at the&nbsp;base, which is interesting as foreshadowing the more fully&nbsp;developed tubular petals of the nearly allied genera </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Aconi-tum</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Helleborus.</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> The presence of all the floral organs&nbsp;in a free condition induced A. P. de Candolle to place&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ranunculus</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> at the head of the vegetable kingdom, but at&nbsp;the present time the reverse opinion holds good, and&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ranunculus</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> with its numerous separate parts is supposed&nbsp;to occupy a lower status than a flower in which a greater&nbsp;amount of consolidation and differentiation takes place.&nbsp;The genus is large as to number of species, which occur in</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
