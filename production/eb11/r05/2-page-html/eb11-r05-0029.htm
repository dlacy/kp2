<p><span class="font0">the Amateur Rowing Association, a body which has control of all other amateur rowing in England. The Henley Stewards and&nbsp;the Amateur Rowing Association (or A.R.A.) are in complete&nbsp;harmony. Their rules are identically the same, but the&nbsp;Stewards being the older body are not subject to the A.R.A.,&nbsp;and in the improbable event of a difference occurring they&nbsp;would be entitled to act independently. The A.R.A. was&nbsp;formed in 1882 for the purpose of drawing up a definition of an&nbsp;“ amateur,” and for the purpose of having a body who could&nbsp;if necessary select a national representative crew to meet any&nbsp;foreign or colonial invaders. It has long since dropped the&nbsp;latter portion of its original programme, and the A.R.A. as at&nbsp;present constituted is an association to which all the principal&nbsp;amateur boat clubs are affiliated. Its objects are to maintain&nbsp;the standard of amateur oarsmanship and to promote the&nbsp;interests of boat racing. It is governed by a committee which&nbsp;occupies in the British rowing world a position not unlike that&nbsp;of the stewards of the Jockey Club in racing matters. The&nbsp;constitution and objects of the A.R.A. arc clearly defined in&nbsp;the rules, and their definition of an amateur is so much stricter&nbsp;than that of some other countries that it is advisable to set it&nbsp;out </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">in extenso.</span><span class="font0"> It is as follows:—</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">No person shall be considered an amateur oarsman, sculler or coxswain—</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who has ever rowed or steered in any race for a stake, money&nbsp;or entrance fee;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who has ever knowingly rowed or steered with or against a&nbsp;professional for any prize;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who has ever taught, pursued or assisted in the practice of&nbsp;athletic exercises of any kind for profit;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who has ever been employed in or about boats or in manual&nbsp;labour for money or wages;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is or has been by trade or employment for wages a&nbsp;mechanic, artisan or labourer, or engaged in any menial duty;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(6) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is disqualified as an amateur in any other branch of&nbsp;sport.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The rules of the A.R.A. also comprise the “ Laws of Boat Racing,” which govern the race from start to finish; and the&nbsp;“ Rules for Regattas,” which deal with a large number of&nbsp;matters such as the definition of the different classes of oarsmen,&nbsp;seniors, juniors and maidens, the making of entries, the powers&nbsp;of regatta committees, &amp;c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A large number of regattas are held under these rules in all parts of the country during the summer months. There are&nbsp;also several matches and other competitions rowed under&nbsp;special rules, the most important of these being the Wingfield&nbsp;Sculls (founded 1830), or amateur championship of the Thames,&nbsp;rowed in the month of July over the championship course from&nbsp;Putney to Mortlake (4I m.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If the number of entries at Henley Regatta, the extension of the sphere of influence of the A.R.A. and the public interest&nbsp;in the Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race, may be taken as&nbsp;tests, rowing has more than held its own among the various&nbsp;competing forms of recreation in the world of British amateur&nbsp;athletic sport.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rowing in the United States,—</span><span class="font0">The earliest record of a boat race in the United States is that of a contest in light barges in&nbsp;the year 1811 between the <sup>il</sup> Knicker-bocker ” of New York&nbsp;and the “ Invincible ” of Long Island, in which the former was&nbsp;successful. The evolution from racing in heavy pleasure boats&nbsp;to racing in specially constructed craft proceeded with great&nbsp;rapidity, and by the year 1834 a large number of small clubs&nbsp;in New York had combined, under the title of the Castle Garden&nbsp;Boat Club Association. In 1837 the first regatta took place at&nbsp;Poughkeepsie, the race being between “ six-oars ” for a prize&nbsp;of $200. In those days there was no real distinction in America&nbsp;between amateur and professional, and in spite of rules and&nbsp;definitions the distinction between one who is qualified as an&nbsp;amateur and one who is not has remained in America much less&nbsp;certain and precise than in the United Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Yale and Harvard Universities became centres of aquatic energy very early in the history of American rowing. The&nbsp;first racing boat at Yale, a six-oar, was bought in 1844, and in&nbsp;the following spring Harvard purchased an eight, and in 1852&nbsp;a race was rowed between a Harvard crew and three Yale crews at&nbsp;Lake Winnepesaukee, which resulted in a victory for the former.&nbsp;In 1859 Harvard again defeated Yale in a six-oared race, but&nbsp;on the following day at Worcester City Regatta the same crews&nbsp;entered for a prize and Yale defeated Harvard. In 1864 at a&nbsp;college regatta Yale defeated Harvard, but in 1866 Harvard&nbsp;with a very fine crew showed their superiority over all the other&nbsp;colleges. In 1869 Harvard sent a challenge to Oxford and&nbsp;Cambridge to row a four-oared match on the Thames from&nbsp;Putney to Mortlake. It was accepted by the former and the&nbsp;race was rowed on the 27th of August. The race aroused great&nbsp;public interest, and the banks of the river were crowded from&nbsp;end to end of the course. The crews were: </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Oxford</span><span class="font0">, F. Willan&nbsp;(bow), A. C. Yarborough, J. C. Tinne and S. Darbishire (stroke);&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Harvard</span><span class="font0">, J. S. Fay (bow), E. G. Lyman, W. H. Simmons and&nbsp;A. P. Loring (stroke). Harvard led at first, but Oxford eventually rowed them down and won by three lengths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The trip of the Harvard four to England aroused the rowing enthusiasm of other American universities such as Princeton,&nbsp;Cornell, Columbia and Pennsylvania, and during the next ten&nbsp;years considerable improvement was shown in American&nbsp;rowing. In 1875 <sup>110</sup> fewer than thirteen university or college&nbsp;crews competed in a race, in which Cornell finished first,&nbsp;Columbia second and Harvard third, the ships used being&nbsp;six-oars without coxswains. In 1876 the eight-oared match&nbsp;over a four-mile course between Harvard and Yale was instituted, and in 1878 a four from Columbia University went&nbsp;to Henley and won the Visitors Challenge Cup. In 1879 and&nbsp;1880 there were a very large number of intencollegiate matches&nbsp;and regattas, in several of which Columbia maintained the&nbsp;reputation which they had gained at Henley. In 1881 a&nbsp;Cornell four started at Henley for the Stewards Cup, but were&nbsp;easily beaten. During the next few years there was considerable difference of opinion between universities as to the correct&nbsp;style of stroke, and in 1882 a Yale crew, coached by Mr Davis,&nbsp;did some fine performances, rowing a very fast short stroke&nbsp;in a very long boat. They were, however, eventually beaten&nbsp;by Harvard after an exciting race, in which it is only fair to&nbsp;them to record that the erratic steering of their coxswain&nbsp;contributed in no small degree to their defeat. The next&nbsp;year, 1883, Yale tried an even faster and shorter stroke, but&nbsp;were easily beaten by Harvard, who rowed with great length&nbsp;and steadiness. This year saw the end of the very fast short&nbsp;stroke, and although the “ strokes ” of the various crews since&nbsp;that day have differed in minor degrees, they settled down&nbsp;to a longer steadier method of rowing which is spoken of in&nbsp;England as the “ American style.” It differs from that&nbsp;adopted by English oarsmen in that there is an absence of&nbsp;swing and body work, and in that the oarsmen appear to rely&nbsp;almost entirely upon their long slides and hard leg work. In&nbsp;the early nineties ” Cornell was almost always successful at&nbsp;home, and in 1895 they entered for the Grand 'Challenge Cup&nbsp;at Henley. Owing to a misunderstanding at the start the&nbsp;Leander crew were left at the post in the first heat, but on&nbsp;the next day Cornell suffered defeat at the hands of Trinity&nbsp;Hall. In 1S96 Yale entered at Henley under the tuition of&nbsp;Cook, but were somewhat easily beaten by Leander. The&nbsp;result of these two expeditions to Henley was an attempt to&nbsp;introduce the English style of rowing in America. The experiment was not altogether successful. Mr R. C. Lehmann, who&nbsp;had met with considerable success in England as a coach both&nbsp;at Oxford and Cambridge, went to Harvard for two seasons.&nbsp;The attempt to instruct the American oarsmen in the English&nbsp;methods of swing and body work, instead of the American&nbsp;stroke, resulted in their falling short of perfection in cither&nbsp;style, and they were beaten by Yale upon each occasion. Mr&nbsp;Lehmann’s visit, if it failed to give pace to the crews he coached,&nbsp;resulted, however, in improving the whole spirit of American&nbsp;college rowing. Mutual confidence and friendly rivalry took&nbsp;the place of the atmosphere of suspicion and almost of enmity&nbsp;which had at times existed between Harvard and Yale. In&nbsp;1895 an Inter-collegiate Rowing Association was formed by</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
