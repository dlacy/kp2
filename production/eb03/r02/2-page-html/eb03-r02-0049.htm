<p><span class="font0">Mr Buat therefore examined this by experiment, but found, that even with re ſpect to a pipe or channel which&nbsp;was uniform throughout, this was not true. We could&nbsp;give at once the final formula which he found to expreſs the velocity in every caſe whatever ; but this&nbsp;would be too empirical. The chief ſteps of his very ſa-gacious inveſtigation are inſtructive. We ſhall therefore mention them briefly, at leaſt as far as they tend&nbsp;to give us any collateral information ; and let it always&nbsp;be noted, that the inſtruction which they convey is not&nbsp;abſtract ſpeculation, but experimental truths, which&nbsp;muſt ever remain as an addition to our ltock of knowledge, although Mr Buat’s deductions from them ſhould&nbsp;prove falſe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">He found, in the firſt place, that in the fame channel the product of V and √7 increaſed as √ <sub>i</sub> increaſed ; that is, the velocities increaſed faſter than the ſquare roots of the ſlope, or the reſiſtances did not increaſe as fall as the ſquares of the velocities. We beg&nbsp;leave to refer our readers to what we ſaid on the reſiſt-ance of pipes to the motion of fluids through them, in&nbsp;the article Pneumatics, when ſpeaking of bellows.&nbsp;They will there ſee very<sup>7</sup> valid reaſons (we apprehend)&nbsp;for thinking that the reſiſtances muſt increaſe more Hourly than the ſquares of the velocities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It being found, then, that V √ <sub>s</sub> is not equal to a conſtant quantity </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span class="font0"> it becomes neceſſary to inve-ftigate ſome quantity depending on √<sup>,</sup> <sub>ιf</sub>, or, as it is&nbsp;called, ſome function of 5/ <sub>j</sub>, which ſhall render&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;"><sub>m</sub> g</span><span class="font0"> <sup>a</sup> conſtant quantity. Let X be this function&nbsp;of , ſo that we ſhall always have VX equal to the&nbsp;conſtant quantity </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">»ſ mg,</span><span class="font0"> or 2f-2<sup>2</sup>-∕ equal to the ac-</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Λ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">tual velocity V of a pipe or channel which is in train.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Mr Buat, after many trials and reflections, the chief of which will be mentioned by and by, found a value&nbsp;of X which correſponded with a vaſt variety of Hopes&nbsp;and velocities, from motions almoſt imperceptible, in a&nbsp;bed nearly horizontal, to the greateſt velocities which&nbsp;could be produced by gravity alone in a vertical pipe;&nbsp;and when he compared them together, he found a very&nbsp;diſcernible relation between the reſiſtances and the magnitude of the ſection : that is, that in two channel#&nbsp;which had the ſame ſlope, and the ſame propelling&nbsp;force, the velocity was greateſt in the channel which&nbsp;had the greateſt ſection relative to its border. This&nbsp;may reaſonably be expected. The reſiſtances' ariſe&nbsp;from the mutual action of the water and this border.&nbsp;The water immediately contiguous to it is retarded,&nbsp;and this retards the next, and ſo on. It is to be expected, therefore, that if the border, and the velocity,&nbsp;and the ſlope, be the ſame, the diminution of this velocity will be ſo much the leſs as it is to be ſhared among&nbsp;a greater number of particles ; that is, as the area of&nbsp;the ſection is greater in proportion to the extent of its&nbsp;border. The diminution of the general or medium velocity muſt be leſs· in a cylindrical pipe than in a ſquar-e&nbsp;one of the ſame area, becauſe the border of its ſection&nbsp;is leſs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It appears evident, that the reſiſtance of each particle is in the direct proportion of the whole reſiſtance, and&nbsp;the inverſe proportion of the number of particles which&nbsp;receive equal lhares of</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">-it. </span><span class="font0">It-is therefore directly as the</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">border, and inverſely as the ſection. Therefore in the V* . '</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">expreſſion — which we have given for the reſiſtance,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">the quantity </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">m</span><span class="font0"> cannot be conſtant, except in the ſame channel ; and in different channels it muſt vary&nbsp;along with the relation of the ſection to its border, becauſe the reſiſtances diminiſh in proportion as this relation increaſes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Without attempting to diſcover this relation by theoretical examination of the particular motions of the various filaments, Mr Buat endeavoured to diſcover it by a compariſon of experiments. But this required ſome&nbsp;manner of ſtating this proportion between the augmentation of the ſection and the augmentation of its border.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">His ſtatement is this : He reduces every ſection to a rectangular parallelogram of the ſame area, and&nbsp;having its baſe equal to the border unfolded into&nbsp;a ſtraight line. The product of this baſe by the height&nbsp;of the rectangle will be equal to the area of the lection. I herefore this height will be a repreſentative of&nbsp;this variable ratio of the ſection to its border (We do&nbsp;not mean that there is any ratio between a ſurface and&nbsp;a line : but the ratio of fection to ſection is different&nbsp;from that of border to border ; and it is the ratio of&nbsp;theſe ratios which is thus expreſſed by the height of&nbsp;this rectangle). If </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">S </span><span class="font0">be the ſection, and B the border,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1"> </span><span class="font0">is evidently a line equal to the height of this rectangle. Every ſection being in this manner reduced to&nbsp;a rectangle, the perpendicular height of it may be called&nbsp;the hydraulic mean depth of the ſection, and may be&nbsp;expreſſed by the ſymbol </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">d.</span><span class="font0"> (Buat calls it the mean radius), If the channel be a cylindrical pipe, or an open&nbsp;half cylinder, it is evident that </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">d</span><span class="font0"> is half the radius. If the&nbsp;ſection is a rectangle, wlioſe width is </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ιυ,</span><span class="font0"> and height</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;"> h, </span><span class="font0">the mean depth is , &amp;c. In general, if </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">q</span><span class="font0"> re-prefent the proportion of the breadth of a rectangular&nbsp;canal to its depth, that is, if y be made = -v , we ſhall</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">have </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">d —</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> —:—, or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">d ~---—.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Now, ſince the reſiſtancee muſt augment as the proportion of the border to the ſection augments, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">m</span><span class="font0"> in the ſor-</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Our author was aware, however, of a very ſpecious objection to the cloſe dependence of the reſiſtance on&nbsp;the extent of the border ;, and that it might be ſaid&nbsp;that a double border did not occaſion a double refill-ance, unleſs the preſſure on all the parts was the ſame.&nbsp;For it may be naturally (and it is generally) ſuppoſed,&nbsp;that the reſiſtance will be greater when the preſſure is&nbsp;greater. The friction or reſiſtance analogous to friction may therefore bè greater on an inch of the bottom&nbsp;than on an inch of the ſides ; but Mr. D’Alembert and&nbsp;many others have demonſtrated, that the paths of the&nbsp;filaments will be. the ſame whatever be the preſſures:</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
