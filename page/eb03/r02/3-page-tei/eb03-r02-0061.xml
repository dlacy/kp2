The brow or ſteep of the ridge gradually advances down the ſtream, and the whole ſet change their places, as repreſented by the dotted line <hi rend="italic">adbſ;</hi>  and after a certain time the particle which was depo-ſited at F is found in an unprotected ſituation, as it was in E, and it now makes another ſtep down the ſtream.</p><p>The Abbé Boſſut found, that when the velocity of the ſtream was juſt ſufficient for lifting the fand (and a ſmall exceſs hindered this operation altogether) a ridge advanced about 20 feet in a day.</p><p>Since the current carries off the moſt moveable matters of the channel, it leaves the bottom covered with the remaining coarſer fand, gravel, pebbles, and larger ſtones. To theſe are added many which come down the ſtream while it is more rapid, and alſo many which roll in from the ſides as the banks wear away. All theſe form a bottom much more ſolid and immoveable than a bottom of the medium foil would have been. But this does not always maintain the channel in a permanent form ; but frequently occaſions great changes, by obliging the current, in the event of any ſudden freſh or ſwell, to enlarge its bed, and even to change it altogether, by working to the right and to the leſt, ſince it cannot work downwards. It is generally from ſuch accumulation of gravel and pebbles in the bottom of the bed that rivers change their channels.</p><p>It remains to aſcertain, in abſolute meaſures, the force which a current really exerts in attempting to drag along with it the materials of its channel ; and which <hi rend="italic">will</hi>  produce this effect unleſs refilled by the inertia of theſe materials. It is therefore of practical importance to know this force.</p><p>Nor is it abſtruſe or difficult. For when a current is in train, the accelerating force is in equilibrio with the reſiſtance, and is therefore its immediate meaſure. Now this accelerating force is preciſely equal to the weight of the body of water in motion multiplied by the fraction which expreſſes the ſlope. The mean depth being equal to the quotient of the ſection divided by the border, the ſection is equal to the product of the mean depth multiplied by the border. Therefore, calling the border <hi rend="italic">b,</hi>  and the mean depth <hi rend="italic">cl,</hi>  we have the ſection <hi rend="italic">— db.</hi>  The body of water in· motion is therefore <hi rend="italic">db </hi><hi rend="smallcaps">j∙ (becauſe r was the ſlant length of a part whoſe difference of elevation is 1), and the accelerating force is </hi><hi rend="italic">db s × —,</hi>  or <hi rend="italic">db.</hi>  But if we would only conſi-</p><p>der this reſiſtance as correſponding to an unit of the length of the channel, we muſt divide the quantity <hi rend="italic">d b</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">db</hi></p><p>by j, and the reſiſtance is then —. And if we would <hi rend="italic">s</hi></p><p>conſider the reſiſtance only for an unit of the border, we muſt divide this expreſſion by <hi rend="italic">b</hi>  ; and thus this reſiſtance (taking an inch for the unit) will be expreſſed •for one ſquare inch of the bed by the weight of a bulk of water which has a ſquare inch for its baie, and J . <hi rend="sub">1</hi>  .</p><p>- for its height. And laſtly, if E be taken for any given ſuperſicial extent of the channel or bed, and F the</p><p>obſtruction which we cor.ſider as a ſort of friction, we EJ</p><p>ſhall have F = —-</p><p>j <hi rend="sup">,</hi>    ,</p><p>Thus, let it be required to determine in pounds the reſiſtance or friction on a ſquare yard of a channel whoſe current is in train, which is 10 feet wide, four feet deep, and has a ſlope of one foot in a mile.

But it will afford a moſt •agreeable object to a conſiderate and contemplative mind, to take it up in this very ſimple light ; and having conſidered the many ways in which the drenched ſurface might have been cleared of the ſuperfluous waters, to attend particularly to the very way which nature has followed. In following the troubled waters of a mountain torrent, or the pure ſtreams which trickle from their baſes, till he fees them ſwallowed up in the ocean, and in attending to the many varieties in their motions, he wilRbe delighted with obſerving how the ſimple laws of mechaniſm are made ſo fruitful in good conſequences, both by modifying the motions of the waters them-ſelves, and alſo by inducing new forms onthe ſurface of the earth, fitted for re-acting on the waters, and producing theſe very modifications of their motions which render them ſo beneficial. The permanent beds of rivers are by no means fortuitous gutters haſtily ſcooped out by daſhing torrents ; but both they and the vallevs through which they flow are the patient but unceaſing labours of nature, prompted by goodneſs and directed by wiſdom.</p><p>Whether we trace a river from the torrents whichcollect the ſuperfluous waters of heaven, or from the ſprings which diſcharge what would otherwiſe be condemned to perpetual inactivity, each feeder is but a little rill which could not ramble far from its ſcanty ſource among growing plants ami* abſorbent earth, without being fucked up and evaporated, did it not meet with other rills in its courſe. When united they form a body of water ſtill inconſiderable, but much more able, by its bulk, to overcome the little obſtacles to its motion ; and the rivulet then moves with greater ſpeed, as we have now learned. At the ſame time, the ſurface expoſed to evaporation and abſorption is dimi-niſhed by the union of the riils. Four equal rills have only the ſurface of two when united. Thus the portion which eſcapes arreſtment, and travels downward, is continually increaſing. This is a happy adjuſtment-to the other operations of nature. Were it otherwiſe, the lower and more valuable countries would be loaded wu'th the paſſing waters in addition to their own fur-' plus rains, and the immediate neighbourhood of the ſea would be almoſt covered by the drains of the interior</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
