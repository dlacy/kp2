        <p><span class="font2">R</span><span class="font1">THE twentieth letter in the Phoenician
                alphabet, the nineteenth in the numerical Greek, the seventeenth in
                the&nbsp;ordinary Greek and the Latin and (owing to the addition&nbsp;of J) the
                eighteenth in the English. Its earliest form in&nbsp;the Phoenician alphabet when
                written from right to left was&nbsp; █, thus resembling the symbol for D with one
                side of the&nbsp;triangle prolonged. In Aramaic and other Semitic scripts&nbsp;which
                were modified by opening the heads of the letters, the&nbsp;symbol in time became
                very much changed. Greek, however,&nbsp;maintained the original form with slight
                variations from place&nbsp;to place. Not infrequently in the Greek alphabets of
                Asia&nbsp;Minor and occasionally also in the West, R was written as D,&nbsp;thus
                introducing a confusion with D (q. v. ). Elsewhere a short&nbsp;tail was added, as
                occasionally in the island of Melos, in Attica&nbsp;and in western Greece, but
                nowhere does this seem to have&nbsp;been universal. The earliest Latin forms are
                exactly like&nbsp;the Greek. Thus in the very early inscriptions found in
                the&nbsp;Forum in 1899 R appears as █ (from right to left), p and&nbsp;D (from left
                to right). Later the forms R and R come in;&nbsp;sometimes the back is not quite
                connected in the middle to&nbsp;the upright, when the form R is produced. The name
                of the&nbsp;Semitic symbol is Rēsh; why it was called by the Greeks Rho&nbsp;(ῥῶ) is
                not clear. The h which accompanies r in the transliteration of Greek p, indicates
                that it was breathed, not voiced,&nbsp;in pronunciation. No consonant varies more in
                pronunciation&nbsp;than r. According to Brockelmann, the original Semitic r&nbsp;was
                probably a trilled </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
                >r</span><span class="font1">, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
                >i. e.</span><span class="font1"> an </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span class="font1"> produced by allowing the
                tip&nbsp;of the tongue to vibrate behind the teeth while the upper&nbsp;surface of
                the tongue is pressed against the sockets of the teeth.&nbsp;The ordinary English r
                is also produced against the sockets of&nbsp;the teeth, but without trilling;
                another r, also untrilled, which&nbsp;is found in various parts of the south of
                England, is produced&nbsp;by turning up the tip of the tongue behind the sockets of
                the&nbsp;teeth till the tongue acquires something of a spoon shape.&nbsp;This, which
                is also common in the languages of modern India,&nbsp;is called the cerebral or
                cacuminal r, the former term, which&nbsp;has no meaning in this connexion, being
                only a bad translation&nbsp;of a Sanscrit term. The common German r is produced
                by&nbsp;vibrations of the uvula at the end of the soft palate, and hence&nbsp;is
                called the uvular r. There are also many other varieties&nbsp;of this sound. In many
                languages r is able to form syllables&nbsp;by itself, in the same way that l, m, n
                may do, as in the English&nbsp;brittle (britl), written (ritn). In Europe r with
                this value is&nbsp;most conspicuous in Slavonic languages like Bohemian
                (Czech)&nbsp;and Croatian; in English r in this function is replaced by
                a&nbsp;genuine vowel in words like mother (moðð). This syllabic r is&nbsp;first
                recorded for Sanscrit, where it is common, but is replaced&nbsp;in the languages
                descended from Sanscrit by r and a vowel or&nbsp;by a vowel only, according to the
                position in which it occurs.&nbsp;Most philologists are of opinion that syllabic r
                existed also in the&nbsp;mother-tongue of the Indo-European languages. (P. Gi.

                himself entirely to authorship and wrote a number&nbsp;of novels and short stories;

                command of&nbsp;Zobeir’s forces in the Bahr-el-Ghazal. They persisted in
                slave-raiding, and denied the khedive’s authority, and Colonel C. G.&nbsp;Gordon
                sent against them Romolo Gessi Pasha. Gessi captured Suleiman and routed Rabah, who
                in July 1879 fled westward with some seven hundred Bazingirs (black slave
                soldiers).&nbsp;He made himself master of Kreich and Dar Banda, countries&nbsp;to

                (the mahdi) to join him at&nbsp;Omdurman, but did not do so. According to one
                account he&nbsp;learnt that the mahdi intended, had he gone to Omdurman,&nbsp;to put
                him to death. In 1891 Paul Crampel, a French explorer, was killed in Dar Banda by a
                chieftain tributary to&nbsp;Rabah, and Crampels stores, including 300 rifles, were
                sent&nbsp;to Rabah. With this reinforcement of arms he marched&nbsp;towards Wadai,
                but being stoutly opposed by the people of&nbsp;that country he turned west and
                established himself in Bagirmi, a state south-east of Lake Chad. In 1893 Rabah
                overthrew the sultan of Bornu. In his administration of the country&nbsp;he showed
                considerable ability and a sense of public needs. To&nbsp;the British, represented

                representatives&nbsp;at Yola and Ibi to supply him with gunpowder. Rabah
                then&nbsp;tried threats, and in 1896 all communication between him and&nbsp;the
                company ceased. Early in 1897 he began an advance&nbsp;in the direction of Kano, the
