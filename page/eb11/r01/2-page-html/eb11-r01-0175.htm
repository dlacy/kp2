<p><span class="font1">Reade was an amateur of the violin, and among his works is an essay on Cremona violins with the title, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">A Lost Art&nbsp;Revived.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It was characteristic of Reade’s open and combative nature that he admitted the public freely to the secrets of his method&nbsp;of composition. He spoke about his method in his prefaces;&nbsp;he introduced himself into one of his novels—“ Dr Rolfe ’’ in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">A&nbsp;Terrible Temptation;</span><span class="font1"> and by his will he left his workshop and his&nbsp;accumulation of materials open for inspection for two years after&nbsp;his death. He had collected an enormous mass of materials for&nbsp;his study of human nature, from personal observation, from&nbsp;newspapers, books of travel, blue-books of commissions of&nbsp;inquiry, from miscellaneous reading. This vast collection was&nbsp;classified and arranged in huge ledgers and notebooks. He had&nbsp;planned a great work on “ the wisdom and folly of nations,’’&nbsp;dealing with social, political and domestic details, and it was&nbsp;chiefly for this that his collection was destined, but in passing&nbsp;he found the materials useful as a store of incidents and suggestions. A collector of the kind was bound to be systematic,&nbsp;otherwise his collection would have fallen into confusion, and&nbsp;Reade’s collection contains many curiosities in classification&nbsp;and tabulation. On the value of this method for his art there&nbsp;has been much discussion, the prevalent opinion being that his&nbsp;imagination was overwhelmed and stifled by it. He himself&nbsp;maintained the contrary; and it must be admitted that a priori&nbsp;critics have not rightly understood the use that he made of his&nbsp;laboriously collected facts. He did not merely shovel the&nbsp;contents of his notebooks into his novels; they served rather&nbsp;as an atmosphere of reality in which he worked, so that his novels&nbsp;were like pictures painted in the open air. His imagination&nbsp;worked freely among them and was quickened rather than impeded by their suggestions of things suited to the purpose in&nbsp;hand; and it is probably to his close and constant contact with&nbsp;facts, acting on an imagination naturally fertile, that we owe&nbsp;his marvellous abundance of incident. Even in his novels of&nbsp;character there is no meditative and analytic stagnation; the&nbsp;development of character is shown through a rapid unceasing&nbsp;progression of significant facts. This rapidity of movement was&nbsp;perhaps partly the result of his dramatic studies; it was probably&nbsp;in writing for the stage that he learned the value of keeping the&nbsp;attention of his readers incessantly on the alert. The hankering&nbsp;after stage effect, while it saved him from dullness, often betrayed him into rough exaggeration, especially in his comic&nbsp;scenes. But the gravest defect in his work is a defect of temper.&nbsp;His view of human life, especially of the life of women, is almost&nbsp;brutal; his knowledge of frailties and vices is obtruded with&nbsp;repellent force; and he cannot, with all his skill as a story-teller,&nbsp;be numbered among the great artists who warm the heart and&nbsp;help to improve the conduct. But as a moral satirist, which&nbsp;was the function he professed over and above that of a storyteller, he did good service, both indirectly in his novels and&nbsp;directly in his own name.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">READING, a municipal, county and parliamentary borough and the county town of Berkshire, England, 36 m. W. by S.&nbsp;of London by the Great Western railway. Pop. (1901) 72,217.&nbsp;It is an important junction on the Great Western system, and&nbsp;has communication southward by a joint line of the South-Western and South-Eastern and Chatham companies. The&nbsp;Kennet and Avon canal, to Bath and Bristol, and the Thames,&nbsp;afford it extensive connexions by water. It lies in the flat&nbsp;valley of the Thames on the south (right) bank, where the&nbsp;Kennet joins the main river. The population more than&nbsp;doubled in the last thirty years of the 19th century, and the&nbsp;town is of modem appearance. All the ancient churches are&nbsp;much restored and in part rebuilt. Greyfriars church, formerly&nbsp;monastic, was completed early in the 14th century; and after&nbsp;the dissolution of the monasteries served successively as a town&nbsp;hall, a workhouse and a gaol, being restored to its proper use&nbsp;in 1864. St Mary’s is said to have been rebuilt in 1551 from&nbsp;the remains of a nunnery founded by Ælfthryth in expiation of&nbsp;the murder of her stepson Edward the Martyr. St Lawrence’s&nbsp;is a large Perpendicular building, and St Giles’s, in various styles,&nbsp;was much damaged during the siege of the town in 1643 by the&nbsp;parliamentary forces, and is almost wholly rebuilt. A Benedictine abbey was founded at Reading in 1121 by Henry I., and&nbsp;became one of the richest in England, with a church among&nbsp;the largest in the country. Its founder was buried here, but&nbsp;his monument was destroyed in the time of Edward VI. The&nbsp;church was the scene of John of Gaunt’s marriage to Blanche&nbsp;of Lancaster in r359. By Henry VIII. the abbey was converted&nbsp;into a royal palace, and was so used until its destruction during&nbsp;the civil wars of the 17th century. Little remains of the founda-tion; only a gateway and a fragment of the great hall, the&nbsp;meeting-place of several parliaments, are of importance. The&nbsp;greater part of the site is occupied by public gardens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The educational establishments are important. The site of an ancient hospice of St John is occupied by the University&nbsp;Extension College. It was opened in 1892, is affiliated to&nbsp;Oxford University, and has accommodation for 600 students,&nbsp;of both sexes, giving instruction in every main branch of higher&nbsp;university education, agriculture, &amp;c. The grammar school,&nbsp;founded in 1485, occupies modern buildings and ranks among&nbsp;the lesser public schools. Archbishop Laud was educated here,&nbsp;and became a generous benefactor of the school. There arc also&nbsp;a blue-coat school (1656), and other charitable schools of early&nbsp;foundation. The municipal museum, besides an art gallery and&nbsp;other exhibits, includes a fine collection of Romano-British&nbsp;relics from Silchester, the famous site not far distant in Hampshire. Besides the public grounds on the site of the abbey there&nbsp;may be mentioned Prospect Park of 131 acres, purchased by&nbsp;the Corporation, and Palmer Park, presented by a member&nbsp;of the firm of Huntley &amp; Palmer, together with extensive&nbsp;recreation grounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The industry for which Reading is chiefly famous is the biscuit manufacture, the principal establishment for which is that of&nbsp;Messrs Huntley &amp; Palmer, employing about 5000 hands. In&nbsp;the town and its vicinity are large seed warehouses and testing-grounds. There are also iron foundries, engineering works and&nbsp;factories for agricultural implements, and manufactures of tin&nbsp;boxes, sauces, velvet and silk, and sacking, together with river-side boat-building yards. Reading gives title to a suffragan&nbsp;bishopric in the diocese of Oxford. The parliamentary borough&nbsp;returns one member. The municipal borough is under a mayor,&nbsp;10 aldermen and 30 councillors. Area, 5876 acres.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Reading (Redinges, Rading, Redding) early became a place of importance. In 871 the Danes encamped here between the&nbsp;Thames and the Kennet, and in 1006 it was burned by Sweyn.&nbsp;It consisted of only thirty houses at the time of the Domesday&nbsp;Survey. There is some reason to think that a fortification&nbsp;existed there before the Conquest, and Stephen probably built a&nbsp;masonry castle which Henry II. destroyed. On the foundation&nbsp;of Reading abbey the town, hitherto demesne of the crown, was&nbsp;granted to the abbey by Henry I. Henceforth, until the 16th&nbsp;century, the chief feature of its history was the struggle as to&nbsp;rights and privileges. This was carried on between the abbey&nbsp;and the merchant gild which claimed to have existed in the time&nbsp;of the Confessor, and the chief officer of which was from the&nbsp;15th century styled warder or mayor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A 16th-century account of the gild merchant show’s that many trades were then carried on, but Leland says the town “ chiefly&nbsp;stondith by clothing.’’ The story of Thomas Cole, written by&nbsp;Deloney (d. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">c.</span><span class="font1"> 1600) and purporting to refer to the reign of&nbsp;Henry I., indicates that the industry was carried on at an early&nbsp;date. Archbishop Laud was the son of a Reading clothier.&nbsp;By the 17th century the trade was beginning to decline; the&nbsp;bequest of Kendrich “ the Phoenix of worthy Benefactors ”&nbsp;did h*ttle to revive it, and it was greatly injured by the Civil War.&nbsp;In the 18th century the chief trade was in malt. The first town&nbsp;charter is that given by Henry III. (1253) on behalf of the&nbsp;“ burgesses in the Gild Merchant,” which was confirmed and</span></p>
