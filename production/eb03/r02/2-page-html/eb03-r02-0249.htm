<p><span class="font0">fore the power of AB to withſtand the ſtrain to which it is really expoſed, is to the power of AF to reſiſt its&nbsp;ſtrain as AF to AB. If, therefore, a rafter AG of a&nbsp;certain ſcantling is juſt able to carry the roofing laid&nbsp;on it, a rafter AB of the ſame ſcantling, but more&nbsp;elevated, will be too weak in the proportion of AG to&nbsp;AB. Therefore ſteeper roofs require ſtouter rafters, in&nbsp;order that they may be equally able to carry a roofing&nbsp;of equal weight per ſquare yard. To be equally ſtrong,&nbsp;they muſt be made broader, or placed nearer to each&nbsp;other, in the proportion of their greater length, or they&nbsp;muſt be made deeper in the fubd&lt; plicate proportion of&nbsp;their length. The following eaſy conſtruction will enable the artiſt not ſamiliar with computation to proportion the depth of the rafter to the ſlope of the roof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Let the horizontal line </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">aſ</span><span class="font0"> (fig. 4.) be the proper depth of a beam whoſe length is half the width of the&nbsp;building ; that is, ſuch as would make it fit for carrying the intended tiling laid on a flat roof. Draw the&nbsp;vertical line </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ſ b,</span><span class="font0"> and the line a</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">b</span><span class="font0"> having the elevation of&nbsp;the rafter; make </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a g</span><span class="font0"> equal to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">aſ,</span><span class="font0"> and deſcribe the ſe-jnicircle </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">b dg</span><span class="font0"> ; draw </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a d</span><span class="font0"> perpendicular to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a b, a d</span><span class="font0"> is the&nbsp;required depth. The demonſtration is evident.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We have now treated in ſufficient detail what relates to the chief ſtrain on the component parts of a roof,&nbsp;namely, what' tends to break them tranſverſely ; and we&nbsp;have enlarged more on the ſubject than what the preſent occaſion indiſpenſably required, becauſe the propoſitions which we have demonſtrated are equally applicable, to all framings of carpentry, and are even of greater moment in many caſes, particularly in the conſtruction of machines. Theſe conſiſt of levers in various&nbsp;forms, which are ſtrained tranſverſely ; and ſimilar ſtrains&nbsp;frequently occur in many of the ſupporting and connecting parts. We ſhall give in the article Timber an&nbsp;account of the experiments which have been made by&nbsp;different naturaliſts, in order to aſeertain the abfolute&nbsp;ſtrength of ſome of the materials which are moſt generally framed together in buildings and engines. The&nbsp;houſe-carpenter will draw from them abſolute numbers,&nbsp;which he can apply to his particular purpoſes by&nbsp;means of the propoſitions which we have now eſtabliſhed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We proceed, in the next place, to conſider the other ſtrains to which the parts of roofs are expoſed, in conſequence of the ſupport which they mutually give each&nbsp;other, and the preiſures (or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">thruſts</span><span class="font0"> as they are called in&nbsp;the language of the houſe carpenter) which they exert&nbsp;on each other, and on the walls or piers of the building.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Let a beam or piece of timber AB (fig. 5.) be ſuſpended by two lines AC, BD ; or let it be ſupported by two props AE, BF, which are perfectly moveable&nbsp;round their remote extremities E,F, or let it reſt on the&nbsp;two poliſhed plains KAH, LBM. Moreover, let G&nbsp;be the centre of gravity of the beam, and let GN be a&nbsp;line through the centre of gravity perpendicular to the&nbsp;horizon. The beam will not be in equilibrio unleſs the&nbsp;vertical line GN either paſſes through P, the point in&nbsp;which the directions of the two lines AC, BD, or the&nbsp;directions of the two props EA, FD, or the perpendiculars to the two planes KAH, LBM interſect each&nbsp;other, or is parallel to theſe directions. For the ſupports given by the lines or props are unqueſtionably exerted in the direction of their lengths ; and it is as well</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">known in mechanics that the ſupports given by planes are exerted in a direction perpendicular to thoſe planes&nbsp;in the points of contact ; and we know that the weight&nbsp;of the beam acts in the ſame manner as if it were all&nbsp;accumulated in its centre of gravity G, and that it acts&nbsp;in the direction GN perpendicular to the horizon.&nbsp;Moreover, when a body is in equilibrio between three&nbsp;forces, they are acting in one plane, and their directions are either parallel or they paſs through one point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The ſupport given to the beam is therefore the ſame as if it were ſuſpended by two lines which are attached&nbsp;to the ſingle point P. We may alſo infer, that the&nbsp;points of ſuſpenſion C, D, the.points of ſupport E, F,&nbsp;the points of contact A, B, and the centre of gravity&nbsp;G, are all, in one vertical plane.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When this poſition of the beam is diſturbed by any external force, there muſt either be a motion of the&nbsp;points A and B round the centres of ſuſpenſion C and&nbsp;D, or of the props round theſe points of ſupport E and&nbsp;F, or a Aiding of the ends of the beam along the poliſhed planes GH and IK ; and in conſequence of theſe&nbsp;motions the centre of gravity G will go out of its place*&nbsp;and the vertical line GN will no longer paſs through&nbsp;the point where the directions of the ſupports interſect&nbsp;each other. If the centre of gravity riſes by this motion, the body will have a tendency to recover its former poſition, and it will require force to keep it away&nbsp;from it. In this caſe the equilibrium may be ſaid to&nbsp;be </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">fiable,</span><span class="font0"> or the body to have </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">fiabiliιy.</span><span class="font0"> But if the centre&nbsp;of gravity deſcends when the body is moved ſrom the&nbsp;poſition of equilibrium, it will tend to move ſtill farther;,&nbsp;and lo ſar will it be from recovering its former poſition,&nbsp;that it will now fall. This equilibrium may be called&nbsp;a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">tottering equilibrium.</span><span class="font0"> Theſe accidents depend on the&nbsp;ſituations of the points A, B, C, D, E, F ; and they&nbsp;may be determined by conſidering the ſubject geometrically. It does not much intereſt us at preſent ; it is.&nbsp;rarely that the equilibrium of ſuſpenſion is tottering, or&nbsp;that of props is ſtable. It is evident, that if the beam&nbsp;were ſuſpended by lines from the point P, it would&nbsp;have ſtability, for it would ſwing like a pendulum round&nbsp;P, and therefore would always tend towards the poſition of equilibrium. Hie interſection of the lines of&nbsp;ſupport would ſtill be at P, and the vertical line drawn&nbsp;through the centre of gravity, when in any other ſituation, would be on that ſide of P towards which this&nbsp;centre has been moved. Therefore, by the rules of&nbsp;pendulous bodies, it tends to come back. This would be&nbsp;more remarkably the caſe if the points of ſuſpenſion C&nbsp;and D be on the ſame ſide of the point P with the points&nbsp;of attachment A and B ; ſor in this caſe the new point of&nbsp;interſection of the lines of ſupport would ſhift to the&nbsp;oppoſite ſide, and be ſtill farther from the vertical line&nbsp;through the new poſition of the centre of gravity. But&nbsp;if the points of ſuſpenſion and of attachment are on oppoſite ſides of P, the new point of interſection may ſhift&nbsp;to the ſame ſide with the centre of gravity, and lie beyond the vertical line ; in this caſe the equilibrium is&nbsp;tottering. It is eaſy to perceive, too, that if the equilibrium of ſuſpenſion from the points C and D be ſtable,&nbsp;the equilibrium on the props AE and BF muſt be tottering. It is not neceſſary for our preſent purpoſe to&nbsp;engage more particularly in this diſcuſſion.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a><h4><span class="font1">It is plain that, with reſpect to the mere momentary equilibrium, there is no difference in the ſupport,by</span></h4></div><br clear="all"/>
