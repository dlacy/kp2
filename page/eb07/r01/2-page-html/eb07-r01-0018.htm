<p><span class="font0">When, therefore, the flying levels are complete for the three or four lines, as we have before directed, the engineer&nbsp;and manager, or secretary, should bring all their information&nbsp;together, and throwing it into one common stock, select&nbsp;that line out of the whole, which, on the fullest deliberation, appears to be the best with reference to its gradients,&nbsp;geology, commercial importance, and the facilities it affords&nbsp;for soundly and cheaply constructing the necessary works.&nbsp;This subject will of course require deep attention, and the&nbsp;reasons for the selection should be wτitten out in the fullest and clearest manner, for the inspection of any proprietor&nbsp;who may desire to see them, publicity always insuring confidence ; and in most cases, it would be best to submit vital&nbsp;points of this kind to a general meeting of the whole body,&nbsp;before proceeding to parliament to obtain an act of incorporation. This would entirely prevent any mistrust.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">That these matters require the greatest consideration, will be apparent from the difficulty, delay, and expense of&nbsp;obtaining acts of parliament for railways. The cost of that&nbsp;for the Liverpool and Manchester line, for instance, thirty&nbsp;miles, was about L∙900 per mile. That for the London and&nbsp;Birmingham, 112 miles, was L.72,869, or L.650, 12s. per&nbsp;mile ; and it is well known that the expense has reached&nbsp;L.1000 per mile on long lines, and that latterly, in every&nbsp;new session of parliament, there have been fresh difficulties&nbsp;thrown in the way of obtaining the necessary acts, till it is&nbsp;now nearly impossible to succeed at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• There are many very great hardships connected with 'obtaining an act of incorporation for a railway. Parlia-'ment requires that a plan and section of every part of the&nbsp;ground through which the intended line is to pass, shall be&nbsp;lodged with their clerk, and with the clerks of the peace in&nbsp;every county through which the railway goes. This is a&nbsp;very proper regulation, in order that every landholder may&nbsp;be able, by travelling a convenient distance, to have a personal inspection of a duly authorised document, so as to&nbsp;examine the nature and extent of the benefit, or tile inconvenience which it may occasion to his particular property ;&nbsp;but parliament should at the same time have given the railway companies the power of complying with this wholesome regulation, in the same way as road surveys are made&nbsp;in Ireland, by an order from two magistrates to enter any&nbsp;requisite grounds. This, however, is not done, and therefore it follows, as a necessary consequence, that the projectors of these undertakings, no matter how beneficial or important soever to the community at large, are left entirely&nbsp;at the mercy of the landholders, whether they can make&nbsp;their survey or not. We have ourselves known, that when&nbsp;decided opposition has been evinced to the undertaking,&nbsp;the engineers and surveyors have been put to all possible shifts to obtain the necessary data for their plans and&nbsp;sections. M<sup>7</sup>orking by night with lanthoms has even been&nbsp;unavoidably resorted to ; and in one case, where the proprietor was a clergyman, he was watched on Sunday until&nbsp;he went into his church, and a strong party immediately setting to work, just succeeded in finishing the business as he&nbsp;concluded his sermon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The facilities of opposing a bill in parliament are so great, that every temptation is held out to do so, especially when&nbsp;the rich harvest to counsel, solicitors, and witnesses, is considered ; and as has been well observed by the Irish railway commissioners, discussions are mooted of the most discursive and discordant kinds, relating to all the abstract&nbsp;professional matter in the most distant manner connected&nbsp;with a railway. The principies of curves and gradients are&nbsp;entered into with mathematical precision, and the laws of&nbsp;friction and gravity are investigated ; questions about which&nbsp;the counsel and the court are often equally ignorant, the one&nbsp;side seeking to swell the estimates and lower the profits,&nbsp;and the other pulling in the opposite direction, like the&nbsp;bulls and bears on the stock exchange, till at last, probably&nbsp;after the expenditure of thousands, the bill is thrown out,&nbsp;not on its own merits or demerits, but because, perhaps, a notice to the proprietor of five or six yards of a cabbage garden,&nbsp;was left next door by mistake.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The parliamentary rules are now as much too strict, as they were at first too loose. The time when the required&nbsp;plans and sections are to be deposited, is very inconvenient ; two years at least being required between the deposits being paid and the act obtained. Thus, at the present&nbsp;time, if any line is wished to be procured, the surveys must&nbsp;be made in the autumn of 1838, the plans must be lodged&nbsp;and the notices given in March 1839, the petition for the&nbsp;bill presented to the Commons in February 1840, and supposing the act obtained the same session, little if any real&nbsp;work can be done until the spring of 1841. The subscription of ten per cent, required on the capital, merely leads to&nbsp;delusion ; bankers in general advance the money, and whether the bill succeeds or fails, they get it back with interest&nbsp;and commission, for by the very terms of the order of the&nbsp;House of Commons, it may be paid back to the person advancing it. The public obtain no security against a bad project by this regulation, whilst a good one may be crushed&nbsp;for want of a speculating capitalist. Nobody is benefited&nbsp;in fact, except the banker and the broker ; and that this&nbsp;is the process largely employed all are perfectly aware.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If a bill be lost in one session, it cannot be proceeded with in the next without a new contract deed being signed. This is a considerable hardship. The deviation in section is too limited, and should only apply to raising embankments and lowering cuttings ; the reverse should be&nbsp;allowed to any extent, and the deviation should be reckoned from the surface of the ground, and not the lateral line.&nbsp;If the same line is kept, the effect would be the same, but&nbsp;by removing to a different level, what may be cutting in&nbsp;one respect may be embanking in another. The limitations in all respects as to deviations may be considered as too&nbsp;strict, and they always have the effect of cramping the company and their engineer ; palpable improvements in many&nbsp;cases, have been abandoned on account of the heavy cost&nbsp;of going to parliament for new acts ; and others in all probability would never have been made, except that the companies in question were forced to apply for a new act, in&nbsp;order to enable them to borrow more money, and then the&nbsp;improvement is put in along with the rest as a rider.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When the intended line is once decided on, the surveyors should be sent out as speedily as possible ; and these are followed by the levellers, who are the engineers. It will be&nbsp;best to survey wide, when you are not quite certain of the&nbsp;exact position of the line ; the surveyors give in their plans&nbsp;to the engineers, who proceed to lay down upon them the&nbsp;line as their levelling goes on, taking care as nearly as possible to balance the cuttings and embankments. It will</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
