<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">except in size and phase of cell-life, there is little to be noted here in regard to the development of the group, except in such cases as&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Katallacta</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Volvocineaz,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> where a primitive attempt towards a&nbsp;more or less temporary multicellular form affords us a first hint of&nbsp;the Metazoan segmentation of the ovum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Dicyemida.</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">—In this degenerate and still somewhat problematical intermediate group the asexually produced ovum segments to&nbsp;form an embryo of great simplicity, where a few outer (ectodermal)&nbsp;cells cluster round a single inner (endodermal) one, and where we&nbsp;thus find the first differentiation of the embryo into the cell-layers&nbsp;constantly exhibited in the succeeding groups, though it is unsettled&nbsp;whether this represent the incipient or the degenerate Metazoan&nbsp;type.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Porifcra.</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> —In a calcareous Sponge, such as </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Sycandra,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> the fertilized amoeboid ovum segments within the parent to form a hollow&nbsp;blastosphere, most of the cells of which are clear and ciliated, and&nbsp;partially cover a number of larger granular cells,—the future&nbsp;endoderm and ectoderm respectively. In the free-swimming&nbsp;embryo the latter nutritive cells increase rapidly in size, and,&nbsp;growing ultimately over the locomotor and respiratory ciliated&nbsp;cells, cause them to become invaginated to form the endoderm.&nbsp;This invagination resulting in the obliteration of the “segmentation cavity” and the formation of the “gastrula” stage is&nbsp;perfected as the young Sponge settles down and becomes fixed&nbsp;by processes from the amoeboid ectoderm cells. The cilia of&nbsp;the endoderm disappear ; the blastopore is obliterated ; between&nbsp;ectoderm and endoderm there appears a third germinal layer or&nbsp;mesoderm, and in it the calcareous spicules of the Sponge are&nbsp;developed. A perforation at the top of the inverted gastrula&nbsp;forms the exhalent aperture ; peripheral inhalent pores also arise ;&nbsp;and this renewed exposure of the endoderm cells to direct contact&nbsp;with the water is followed by their return to the ciliated form. See&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sponges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Ccelentera.</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">—The generally equal segmentation of the ovum results as usual in a solid or hollow morula. The formation of the two layers, as in some other groups, may occur either by invagination, as above described, or by a process of separation of inner from&nbsp;outer, termed delamination. In most </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Ccelentera</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> the tissues which&nbsp;in higher groups are strictly mesodermal originate from the direct&nbsp;differentiation of the two primary layers. The larval form most&nbsp;constant in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Ccelentera</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> is the planula (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Hydrozoa, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">vol. xii.&nbsp;p. 557). It is ciliated, two-layered, almost cylindrical, witharudimentary digestive cavity, generally closed. For discussion of the&nbsp;alternation of generations so characteristic of many Coelenterates&nbsp;see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Hydrozoa </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sex.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Vermes.</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">— The development of the unjointed Worms is too varied to admit of general summary. In some we find illustration of&nbsp;that mode of gastrula formation (epibolic), so common in higher&nbsp;groups, where, owing to the large size of the food-packed endoderm&nbsp;cells, an actual invagination is impossible, but the ectoderm cells&nbsp;grow round the others and thus come to enclose them as in the&nbsp;more primitive process. In such a typical higher Worm as&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Lumbricus,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> the segmentation, which varies in regularity according&nbsp;to the species, results in the formation of a blastosphere with&nbsp;readily distinguishable ectoderm and endoderm ; the invagination of&nbsp;the latter results in a somewhat cylindrical gastrula. The blastopore narrows anteriorly to form the permanent mouth, while in&nbsp;some other Chsetopods a similar narrowing in the opposite direction&nbsp;forms not the mouth but the anus. The mesoderm appears very&nbsp;early in the form of posteriorly situated cells on each side of the&nbsp;middle line, and soon two mesoblastic bands are formed extending to the mouth. These are subsequently divided into blocks or&nbsp;somites, the anterior and posterior walls of two adjacent blocks&nbsp;uniting to form the cross partitions of the adult Worm, while the&nbsp;outer and inner walls form respectively the somatic and splanchnic&nbsp;layers. The ventral nerve cord results from the sinking in and&nbsp;union of two epiblastic thickenings, developed one on each side of&nbsp;a ventral furrow, while the supra-cesophageal ganglion has a&nbsp;distinct origin from a dorsal thickening. The somewhat isolated&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Sagltta</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> affords good illustration of the formation of the body-cavity from two lateral lobes of the archenteron. The simple&nbsp;enteric cavity normally formed exhibits anteriorly a division into&nbsp;a middle lobe and two side pouches uniting behind in the single&nbsp;cavity. The middle lobe is separated off from lateral and&nbsp;posterior cavities as a blind tube which afterwards forms the&nbsp;alimentary canal; the side pouches form the body-cavity (see&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tapeworms, Planarians, Nemertines, Annelida, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">&amp;c.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Echinodermata.</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">—The generally uniform segmentation results in a blastosphere, usually elongated in the direction of the axis of&nbsp;invagination. A gastrula is formed by normal invagination, in the&nbsp;course of which amoeboid cells are budded off from the two sides&nbsp;of the advancing depression to form the mesodermic musculature&nbsp;and connective tissue of the adult. The blastopore forms the&nbsp;larval anus, which does not always persist; the larval mouth is permanent, and is the result of an independent ectodermic invagination meeting the archenteron. The coelom or body-cavity, with&nbsp;its mesodermic lining, arises from a paired or single outgrowth&nbsp;of the archenteron, and the water-vascular vesicle which comes&nbsp;to lie round the oesophagus has a similar origin. For an outline&nbsp;of the nature of the larval forms and the passage of the embryonic&nbsp;organs into those of the adult the reader is referred to </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Echinodermata.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Arthropoda.</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">—The interesting </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Pcripatus</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Myriapoda, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">vol. xvii. p. 116) exhibits in its development phenomena, such as that&nbsp;of the elongated blastopore gradually closing from the middle, so as&nbsp;to leave mouth and anus, and that of the surrounding nerve cord,&nbsp;which suggest affinities through the whole animal kingdom from&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Ccelentera</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> on the one hand to </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Vertebrata</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> on the other ; but of&nbsp;these discussion is still far from ended. The development of the&nbsp;Insect ovum illustrates what is termed centrolecithal segmentation,&nbsp;where a single uniform layer of superficial cells encloses a nucleated&nbsp;but undivided central yolk mass. The blastoderm becomes&nbsp;thickened ventrally; and along the middle line of the ventral&nbsp;plate there appears a groove which is the seat of the mesoderm&nbsp;formation. The development of the Vertebrate amnion is recalled&nbsp;by the formation of two enveloping membranes from folds of&nbsp;the blastoderm, which arch over and coalesce over the ventral&nbsp;plate, and at the same time spread upwards to cover the dorsal&nbsp;integument from which they are eventually separated. Both&nbsp;disappear through absorption or rupture either before or during&nbsp;hatching. The mesoderm is divided into two lateral bands, and&nbsp;these into hollow somites, which together form the perivisceral&nbsp;cavity. As usual the outer layer of mesoderm follows the ectoderm, the inner the endoderm, which probably arises from a&nbsp;secondary segmentation of the yolk. The ventral plate extends&nbsp;to a slight extent dorsally both before and behind, and on it&nbsp;the appendages appear as hollow outgrowths of ectoderm and endoderm. The ventral nerve cord arises from two sunken thickenings&nbsp;of ectoderm, the tracheae as invaginations of the same. The&nbsp;middle section of the alimentary tract is formed from endoderm,&nbsp;the anterior and posterior portions from ectodermic invaginations.&nbsp;For an account of larval metamorphosis, &amp;c., see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Insects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Crustacea.</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">—In these the segmentation is usually centrolecithal, and results in a uniform blastoderm enclosing a central yolk mass&nbsp;without traces of division. The gastrula stage is represented by&nbsp;an invagination of a patch of the blastoderm, which forms the&nbsp;endoderm, and from which the mesodermic cells seem also to arise.&nbsp;A ventral thickening of ectoderm continuous with the invaginated&nbsp;portion forms the ventral plate on which the embryo is mapped&nbsp;out. Along it the nerve cord appears as a median thickening, and&nbsp;the sense organs have as usual a similar ectodermic origin. The&nbsp;mesoderm appears to form the usual tissues (muscles, heart, &amp;c.),&nbsp;but has apparently less definiteness of arrangement into layers and&nbsp;somites than is usually the case. The original invagination forms&nbsp;the mesenteron, and the lining endoderm cells absorb the yolk&nbsp;The anterior and posterior portions of the alimentary tract are&nbsp;formed as usual by subsequent independent invaginations. Much&nbsp;less proportionally is known of the organogeny than of the very&nbsp;interesting and suggestive larval forms, for which see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Crustacea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Mollusca.</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">—The typical Molluscan segmentation is markedly unequal, the disproportion between ectoderm and endoderm cells&nbsp;varying according to the proportion of food-yolk. The gastrula&nbsp;stage is more frequently reached by the growth of the ectoderm&nbsp;cells over the larger and fewer endoderm cells than by any actual&nbsp;invagination. The blastopore may close apparently towards either&nbsp;the oral or the anal extremity, forming mouth or anus or neither.&nbsp;In </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Cephalopoda</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> the segmentation is confined to a germinal disk of&nbsp;formative material as in partially segmenting Vertebrate ova,&nbsp;though there are besides cells from the yolk which underlie the&nbsp;germinal region of the blastoderm and also accompany it in.its&nbsp;growth round the yolk, forming the inner blastodermic layer or&nbsp;yolk membrane. The mesoderm appears at the lips of the blastopore, or in an equivalent position; it forms a complete layer between&nbsp;ectoderm and endoderm, and within it the body cavity is formed&nbsp;usually by a definite splitting into two layers. The invaginated&nbsp;endoderm forms the mesenteron ; and the history of the formation&nbsp;of the anterior and posterior portions of the tract varies with the&nbsp;fate of the blastopore. In the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Cephalopoda</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> at least, the nervous&nbsp;system appears not as usual from the ectoderm but from the mesoderm. The characteristic larval organs, the shell gland and the&nbsp;foot, are ectodermic in origin—the former arising as a thickened&nbsp;invagination on the posterior and dorsal side of the embryo, and&nbsp;the latter as a ventral protuberance. Further details and larval&nbsp;changes are thoroughly treated under </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Mollusca.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Tunicata.</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">—The complete and generally quite equal segmentation results in the formation of a blastosphere with a large segmentation cavity. The cavity is obliterated by a normal invagination, and a typical gastrula is formed. In the formation of the nerve cord&nbsp;from the closure of a medullary groove and of the notochord from&nbsp;a cord of cells on the dorsal wall of the archenteron, in the appearance of respiratory slits in the anterior portion of the enteric&nbsp;cavity and of a cerebral eye, and in fact in all the essential features&nbsp;of their development they present the amplest evidence of their&nbsp;Vertebrate affinities and degenerate origin (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tunicata).</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
