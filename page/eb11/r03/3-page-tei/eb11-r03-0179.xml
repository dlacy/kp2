On the 28th and 29th he came before the commission appointed by Cardinal Pole, and was sentenced to death by Gardiner for heretically denying the Christian character of the Church of Rome and the real presence in the sacrament. He awaited and met death (on the 4th of February 1555 at Smithfield) cheerfully, though denied even an interview with his wife. Noailles, the French ambassador, speaks of the support given to Rogers by the greatest part of the people: “even his children assisted at it, comforting him in such a manner that it seemed as if he had been led to a wedding.” He was the first Protestant martyr of Mary’s reign, and his friend Bradford wrote that “ he broke the ice valiantly.”</p><p>The following divines of the same name may be distinguished :—</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">John Rogers</hi>  (i572?-i6o3), Puritan vicar of Dedham, Essex, “ one of the most awakening preachers of the age.”—<hi rend="smallcaps">John Rogers </hi>(1610-1680), ejected vicar of Croglin, Cumberland, and the founder of Congregational churches in Teesdale and Weardale, where he evangelized the lead miners.—<hi rend="smallcaps">John Rogers</hi>  (1679-1729), one of George II.’s chaplains, famous for his share in the Bangorian controversy (1719), nis <hi rend="italic">Vindication of the Civil Establishment of Religion </hi>(1728), and his <hi rend="italic">Persuasives to Conformity,</hi>  addressed to Dissenters (1736) and to Quakers (1747).—<hi rend="smallcaps">John Rogers</hi>  (i74O?-i8i4), leader of the Irish seceding divines, minister of Cahans, Co.

In 1848 he became an apprentice in a machine shop at Manchester, New Hampshire, and remained there for about ten years. During the latter part of this time he had done some modelling in clay in his leisure hours, and, having decided to become a sculptor, he spent eight months in Rome and Paris in 1858-59. Becoming discouraged, he returned to America and obtained employment as a draughtsman in the office of the city surveyor of Chicago; but soon afterwards, owing to the favourable reception of his group of small figures, “ The Checker Players,” he resumed sculptural work, confining himself to these small figures, known as “ Rogers Groups,” which had an enormous popular success and were extensively reproduced. The Civil War in America gave him patriotic themes that increased his vogue and prosperity, and in 1863 he became a National Academician. His subjects were familiar scenes and incidents of home life known to the masses, and the reproductions of his groups were sold in the most remote districts as well as in the larger cities. He executed several life-sized statues, including “ General John F. Reynolds ” and a seated figure of Lincoln, both in Philadelphia; but it is by his statuettes that he is best remembered, and these were ' characterized by sentiment and human interest rather than any genuine artistic feeling. He died at New Haven, Connecticut, on the 27th of July 1904.</p><p>ROGERS, ROBERT. (1727-1784?), American frontier soldier, was born of Irish parentage in 1727, probably at Methuen, Massachusetts, whence his father, James Rogers (often confused with James Rogers, an early settler of Londonderry, N.H.), removed in 1739 to Starktown (now Dunbarton), New Hampshire. During the Seven Years’ War he raised and commanded a force of militia, known as Rogers’ Rangers, which won a wide reputation for its courage and endurance in the campaigns about Lake George. He took part in Wolfe’s expedition against Quebec, and on the 4th of October 1759 he destroyed an Abnaki Indian village on the St Francis river near its mouth and killed about 200 of its inhabitants. After the Montreal campaign of 1760, in which he served, he was sent by General Amherst to take possession of the north-western posts, occupied Detroit on the 29th of November, and later returned to the east. In 1763, during the Pontiac uprising, he accompanied the relief expedition under James Dalyell to Detroit and took part in the battle of Bloody Bridge on the 31st of July (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Pontiac).</hi>  Soon after this he went to England, and in 1765 published in London a <hi rend="italic">Coticise Account of North America<hi rend="sub">t </hi>containing a Description of the Several British Colonies . . . also an Account of the Several Nations and Tribes of Indians </hi>(new edition, Albany, 1883). In 1766-68 he was commandant of Michilimackinac. He spent the next few years in England, and after 1772 was in the service of the dey of Algiers. At the beginning of the War of Independence he returned to America, and in spite of his protestations of patriotism was considered by Washington and others a Loyalist spy. He was arrested by agents of Congress, but was paroled. His re-arrest he considered a release from his parole. He then openly joined the British, and under a commission from General Howe organized a regiment of Loyalists which was known as the Queen’s Rangers, and which after his return to England in 1776 was commanded by Capt. John G. Simcoe. In 1779 he was commissioned to raise a regiment to be called the King’s Rangers, and he returned for a short time to America; but the command of the Rangers, which soon became a part of the garrison of St John’s, Quebec, was taken by his brother James (d. 1792), who had formerly served under Robert. Rogers died in London probably in 1784.</p><p><hi rend="sub">e</hi> In addition to the<hi rend="italic">Concise Account of North America,</hi>  he published his <hi rend="italic">Journals</hi>  (London, 1765), and is supposed to have written, at least in part, <hi rend="italic">Ponteach<hi rend="sub">i</hi>  or</hi><hi rend="italic">the </hi><hi rend="italic">Savages of America, a Tragedy</hi>  (London, 1766).

Hough; and Francis Parkman, <hi rend="italic">Montcalm and Wolfe</hi>  (2 vols., Boston, 1884).</p><p>ROGERS, SAMUEL (1763-1855), English poet, was bom at Newington Green, London, on the 30th of July 1763. His father, Thomas Rogers, was the son of a Stourbridge glass manufacturer, who was also a merchant in Cheapsidc. Thomas Rogers had a place in the London business, and married AIary, the only daughter of his father’s partner, Daniel Radford, becoming himself a partner shortly afterwards. Onhis mother’s side Samuel Rogers was connected with the two well-known Nonconformist divines Philip and ,Matthew Henry, and it was in Nonconformist circles at Stoke Newington that he was brought up. He was educated at private schools at Hackney and Stoke Newington. He wished to enter the Presbyterian ministry, but at his father’s desire he joined the banking business in Comhill. f In long holidays, necessitated by delicate health, Rogers became a diligent student of English literature, particularly in Johnson, Gray and Goldsmith. Gray’s poems, he said, he had by heart. He had already made some contributions to the <hi rend="italic">Gentleman<hi rend="sup">y</hi>S Magazine,</hi>  when in 1786 he published a volume containing some imitations of Goldsmith and an “ Ode to Superstition ” in the manner of Gray. In 1788 his elder brother Thomas died, and Samuel’s business responsibilities were increased. In the next year he paid a visit to Scotland, where he met Adam Smith, Henry AIackenzie, the Piozzis and others. In 1791 he was in Paris, and enjoyed a hurried inspection of the art collection of Philippe Égalité at the Palais Royal, many of the treasures of which were later on to pass into his possession. With Gray as his model, Rogers took great pains in polishing his verses, and six years elapsed after the publication of his first volume before he printed his elaborate poem on <hi rend="italic">The Pleasures of Memory</hi>  (1792). This poem may be regarded as the last embodiment of the poetic diction of the 18th century. Here is carried to the extremest pitch the theory of elevating and refining familiar themes by abstract treatment and lofty imagery. In this art of “ raising a subject,” as the 18th-century phrase was, the <hi rend="italic">Pleasures of Memory </hi>is much more perfect than Thomas Campbell’s <hi rend="italic">Pleasures of Hope,</hi>  published a few years later in imitation. The acme of positive praise for the fashionable serious poetry of the time was given by Byron when he said, “ There is not a vulgar line in the poem.”</p><p>In 1793 his father’s death gave Rogers the principal share in the banking house in Cornhill, and a considerable income.</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
