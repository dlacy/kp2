But the French <hi rend="italic">Dictionnaire Historique,</hi> whose information on a point of this nature ought to be authentic, says that he was invested with this honour the same year in which he took the fortress of Bellegarde from the Spaniards whilst serving in Portugal.</p><p>Upon the revocation of the edict of Nantes, when the persecution commenced against the Protestants, Schomberg, who was of that persuasion, requested leave to retire into his own country. This request was refused ; but he was permitted to take refuge in Portugal, where he had reason to expect he would be kindly received on account of past services. But the religious zeal of the Portuguese, though it did not prevent them from accepting assistance from a heretic when their kingdom was threatened with subversion, could not permit them to give him shelter when he came for protection. The inquisition interfered, and obliged the king to send him away. He then went to Holland by the way of England. Having accepted an invitation from the Elector of Brandenburg, he was invested with the government of Ducal Prussia, and appointed commander-in-chief of the elector’s forces. When the Prince of Orange sailed to England to take possession of the crown which his father-in-law James II. had abdicated, Schomberg obtained permission from the Elector of Brandenburg to accompany him. He is supposed to have been the author of an ingenious stratagem which the prince employed after his arrival in London, to discover the sentiments of the people respecting the revolution. The stratagem was, to spread an alarm over the country that the Irish were approaching with fire and sword. When the prince was established on the throne of England, Schomberg was appointed commander-in-chief of the forces, and master of the ordnance. In April 1689 he was made knight of the garter, and naturalized by act of parliament ; and in May following he was created baron, earl, marquis, and duke of the kingdom of England, by the name and title of Baron Teys, Earl of Brentford, Marquis of Harwich, and Duke of Schomberg. The House of Commons voted to him L.100,000 as a reward for his services. Of this he only received a small part; but after his death a pension of L.5000 a year was bestowed upon his son.</p><p>In August 1689 he was sent to Ireland to reduce that kingdom to obedience. When he arrived, he found himself at the head of an army consisting only of twelve thousand foot and two thousand horse, while King James commanded an army three times more numerous. Schomberg thought it dangerous to engage so superior a force, and being disappointed in his promised supplies from England, he judged it prudent to remain on the defensive. He therefore posted himself at Dundalk, about five or six miles distance from James, who was encamped at Ardee. For six weeks he remained in this position, without attempting to give battle, while from the wetness of the season he lost nearly the half of his army. Schomberg was much blamed for not coming to action ; but some excellent judges admired his conduct, as evincing great military talents. Had he risked an engagement, and been defeated, Ireland would have been lost. At the famous battle of the Boyne, fought on the 1st of July 1690, which decided the fate of James, Schomberg passed the river at the head of his cavalry, defeated eight squadrons of the enemy, and broke the Irish infantry. When the French Protestants had lost their commander, Schomberg went to rally and lead them on to charge. While thus engaged, a party of King James’s guards, which had been separated from the rest, passed Schomberg, in attempting to rejoin their own army. They attacked him with great fury, and gave him two wounds in the head. As the wounds were not dangerous, he might</p><p>soon have recovered from them ; but the French Protestants, perhaps thinking their general was killed, immediately fired upon the guards, and shot him dead on the spot. He was buried in St Patrick’s cathedral. Bishop Burnet says Schomberg was “ a calm man, of great application and conduct, and thought much better than he spoke ; of true judgment, of exact probity, and of a humble and obliging temper.”</p><p>SCHOOL, a public place, in which the languages, the arts, or sciences, are taught. Thus we say, a grammar school, a writing school, and a school of natural philosophy. The word is formed from the Latin <hi rend="italic">schola,</hi> which, according to Du Cange, signifies discipline and correction. He adds, that it was anciently used for all places where several persons met together, either to study, to converse, or do any other matter.

His Greek Lexicon is esteemed the best of all his works. He died in 1667.</p><p>SCHRYARI, an ancient wind-instrument of the bagpipe kind, long disused.</p><p>SCHULTENS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Albert,</hi> professor of Hebrew and of the oriental languages at Leyden, and one of the most learned men of the eighteenth century, was born at Groningen, where he studied till the year 1706, and thence continued his studies at Leyden and Utrecht. Schultens at length applied himself to the study of Arabic, both printed and in manuscript, in which he made great progress. A short time afterwards he became minister of Wassenar ; and in two years professor of the eastern tongues at Franekcr. At length he was invited to Leyden, where he taught Hebrew and the Oriental languages with extraordinary reputation till his death, which happened in the year 1750. He wrote many learned works, the principal of which are, 1. A Commentary on Job, in two vols. 4to ; 2. A Commentary on the Proverbs ; 3. Vetus regia Via Hebraizandi ; 4. Animadversiones philologicæ et criticæad varia loca Veteris Testamenti ; 5. An excellent Hebrew Grammar. Schultens discovered in all his works sound criticism and much learning. He maintained against Gousset and Driessen, that in order to have a perfect knowledge of Hebrew, it is necessary to join with it not only the Chaldaic and Syriac, but more particularly the Arabic.</p><p>SCHURMAN, <hi rend="smallcaps">Αννα Mama,</hi> a most extraordinary German lady, was born at Cologne in 1607. Her natural genius discovered itself at six years of age, when she cut all sorts of figures in paper with her scissars without a pattern. At eight she learned in a few days to draw flowers in a very agreeable manner. At ten, she took only three hours to learn embroidery ; and afterwards she was taught music vocal and instrumental, painting, sculpture, and engraving, in all of which she succeeded admirably. She excelled in miniature-painting, and in cutting portraits upon glass with a diamond. Hebrew, Greek, and Latin, were so familiar to her, that the most learned men were astonished at it. She spoke French, Italian, and English, fluently. Her handwriting, in almost all languages, was so inimitable, that the curious preserved specimens of it in their cabinets. But all this extent of learning and penetration could not</p></body></text></TEI>
