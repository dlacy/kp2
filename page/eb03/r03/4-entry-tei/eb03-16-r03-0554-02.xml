                    partly in Aſia, is bounded on the north by the Northern Ocean, or Frozen Sea ;

                    thence, towards the ſouth, it extends along the chain of the Aleoutſkie iſlands.
                    which approach the north-weſt coaſt of America ; and from Kamtſchatka, towards
                    the ſouth-weſt, it extends, by a chain of other iſlands, called Keurilſkie
                    iſlands, as far as Japan ; on the ſouth it borders on the Black Sea, on the
                    nations which dwell at the foot of the Caucaſian mountains, on a part of Perſia,
                    the Caſpian Sea, the hordes of Kwghiſkaiſacki, on Ziungoria, Chineſe Mungalia

                        is that extent of land which is traverſed by the river Amour. It is ſo
                        called on account of the Daouri, its ancient inhabitants, who were a race of
                        the Toungooſi or Manjouri.</note>; and on the weft, on the Daniſh and
                    Swediſh Lapland, the Baltic Sea, Courland, Livonia, Lithuania, Poland, and
                    Turkey in Europe.</p>
                <p>Ruſſia occupies more than a ſeventh part of the known continent, and nearly the
                    26th part of the whole globe. Its greateſt extent from weft to eaſt, viz. from
                    the 39¼ to 207¼ degree of longitude, is 168 degrees ; and if the iſlands of the
                    Eaſtern Ocean be included, it will then be 185; ſo that the continental length
                    of Ruſſia, viz. from Riga to Tchoukotſkoy Noſs, which is the eaſternmoſt
                    promontory, will conſtitute about 8500 verſts. The greateſt extent of this
                    empire from north to ſouth, that is, from the 78th to 50¼ degree of latitude, is
                    27¾ degrees. Hence the breadth of Ruſſia, that is, ſrom the Cape Taymour,· which
                    is the north-eaſtern promontory, to Kiakhta, will conſtitute about 3200 verſts.</p>
                <p>The greater part of this empire lies in the temperate zone, and a part of it,
                    viz. that which is beyond the 66½ degree of latitude, lies in the frigid zone ;
                    and the whole ſurface contains above 2,150,000 ſquare verſts. There therefore is
                    not at preſent, and never has been in any period, an empire, the extent of which
                    could be compared to that of Ruſſia. The length and breadth of this immenſe
                    empire, taken in a ſtraight line, may be thus diſcovered. Its furthermoſt point
                    or ſpot on the north is the Taymour Cape, which is the moſt north-eaſtern
                    promontory in the government oſ Tobolſk, lying in the 78th degree of latitude ;
                    its ſar-theſt point on the ſouth -is the mouth of the river Soulak, falling into
                    the Caſpian Sea in the government of Caucaſus, lying in the 43d degree oſ
                    latitude ; its weſternmoſt point is the iſland of Oezel in the government of
                    Riga, in the 39¼ degree of longitude ; and the furthermoſt point of it on the
                    eaſt is the Tchoukotſkoy Noſs, which is the moſt eaſtern cape in the government
                    oſ Iikoutſk, lying in the 207¼ degree of longitude.</p>
                <p>In ancient times Ruſſia was inhabited by various nations ; ſuch as Hunns,
                    Scythians, Sarmatians, Maſſa-getes, Sclavonians, Cimbri, &amp;c. of whom an
                    account is given under the various detached articles in this work.. The origin
                    oſ the Ruſſians themſelves, though not prior to the ninth century, is ſtill
                    covered with almoſt impenetrable obſcurity ; partly owing to the ignorance and

                <p>miſtaken policy which yet prevails in the nation, of ſuppreſſing all accounts of
                    their origin, and inquiries into their ancient ſtate and ſituation ; of which we
                    have a remarkable inſtance in the ſuppreſſion of a work by profeffor Muller,
                    intitled <hi rend="italic">De Originlbus Gentis et Nominis Rufforum.</hi></p>
                <p>According to ſeveral authors of credit, the Ruffians derived their origin from
                    the Slavi or Slavonians, corruptly called the <hi rend="italic">Sclavonians,</hi> who fettled ſirſt along the banks of the Volga, and afterwards near the
                    Danube, in the countries named <hi rend="italic">Bulgaria</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic"> Hungary;</hi> but being driven from thence by the Romans
                    (whom the Ruffians call <hi rend="italic">Wolochers,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                        > Wolotaners'),</hi> they firſt removed to the river Boryſthenes, or
                    Dneiper, then •over-ran Poland, and, as is reported, built the city of Kiow.
                    Afterwards they extended their colonies farther north, to the rivers which run
                    into the <hi rend="italic">Ilmen</hi> lake, and laid the foundation of the
                    city of Novogorod. The towns,of Smolenſk and Tſernikow appear alſo to have been
                    built by them, though the dares-of theſe events . cannot be aſcertained. The
                    moſt ancient inhabitants, not only of Ruſſia, but all over Siberia, quite to the
                    borders of China, are called <hi rend="italic">TJhucli ;</hi> for profeffor
                    Muller, on inquiring in thoſe parts by whom the ancient buildings and ſepulchral
                    monuments he ſaw there, were erected, was everywhere anſwered, that they were
                    the works of the Tſhudi, who in ancient times had lived in that country.</p>
                <p>In the ninth century, the Scandinavians., that is, the Danes, Norwegians, and
                    Swedes, emigrated from the north, and, crofling the Baltic^ went to ſeek
                    habitations in Ruſſia. They firſt ſubdued the Courlanders, Livonians, and
                    Eſthonians ; and, extending their conqueils ftill ſarther, they exacted tribute
                    from the Novogorodi-ans, ſettled kings over them, and traded as far as Kiow, and
                    even to Greece. Theſe new invaders were called <hi rend="italic">Waregers ;</hi> which, according to profeffor Muller, fignifies “ ſea-faring people or, it
                    derived from the old northern word <hi rend="italic">war,</hi> it fignifies “
                    warlike men.” To theſe Waregers the name of <hi rend="italic">Ruffles, or
                        Ruffians,</hi> is thought by the moſt eminent authors to owe its origin ;
                    but the etymology of the word itſelf is entirely uncertain.</p>
                <p>In the dark ages of which we are ſpeaking, it is ! pretty certain that Ruſſia
                    was divided among a great -number of petty princes, who made war upon each '
                    other with the ferocity and cruelty of wild beaſts ; ſo that the whole country
                    was reduced to the utmoſt ml-ſery ; when Goſtomiſel, a chief of the
                    Novogorodians, pitying the unhappy fate of his countrymen, and ſeeing no other
                    method of remedying their calamities, adviſed them to offer the government of
                    their country to the Waregers. The propoſal was readily accepted, and three
                    princes of great abilities and valour were ſent to govern them ; namely, Ruric,
                    Sineus, and Truwor, generally ſuppoſed to have been brothers. The firſt took up
                    his refidence at Ladoga, in the principality of Great Novogorod ; the ſecond at
                    Bielo Oſero, or the White Lake ; and the third kept his court at Iſhorſk, or,
                    according to others, at a ſmall town, then called <hi rend="italic">Twcrizog,</hi> in the principality of Pleſkow. The three brothers reigned amicably, and
                    made conſiderable additions to-their dominions ; all of which at length devolved
                    to Ruric by the death of Sineus and Truwor j but what</p>
                <p>the conqueſts of the two brothers were, we have no records to inform us of.</p>
                <p>Ruric, to his honour, became zealous for the ſtrict adminiſtration of juſtice ;
                    and iffued a command to all: the boyars who poffeffed territories under him, to
                    exer-i ciſe it in an exact and uniform manner. To this end, it was neceffary
                    there ſhould be general laws. And this naturally leads us to conjecture, that
                    letters were not entirely unknown in his dominions.</p>
                <p>The Ruffian empire continued to flouriſh till the end ^ of the reign of
                    Wolodomir, who aſcended the throne in the year 976. Having ſettled the affairs
                    of his empire in peace, he demanded in marriage the princeſs Anne, fiſter to the
                    Greek emperor Bafιlius Porphyro-genitus. His fuit w <hi rend="sup">,</hi> as
                    granted, on condition that he ſhould embrace Chriſtianity. With this the Ruffian
                    monarch complied ; and that vaſt empire was thenceforward conſidered as
                    belonging to the patriarchate of Conſtantinople. Wolodomir received the name of <hi rend="italic">Ba-ltlius</hi> on the day on which he was baptized ;
                    and, according to the Ruffian annals, zo,ooo of his ſubjects were baptized the
                    ſame day. Michael Syra, or Cyrus, a Greek, ſent by Photius the patriarch of
                    Conſtantinople, was accepted as metropolitan of the whole country. At the ſame
                    time, Wolodomir put away all his former wives and concubines, of whom he had
                    upwards of 800, and by whom he had 12 Tons, who were baptized on the ſame day
                    with himſelf. The idols of pa-ganiſm were now thrown down ; churches and
                    mona-lteries were erected, towns built, and the arts began to flouriſh. The
                    Sclavonian letters were now firſt introduced into Ruſſia ; and Wolodomir ſent
                    miflionaries to convert the Bulgarians ; but only three or four of their princes
                    came to him and were baptized. Theſe events happened in the year 987.</p>
                <p>Wolodomir called the arts from Greece, cultivated them in the peaceable periods
                    of his reign, and rewarded their proſeffors with generality, that he might
                    dif-pel the clouds of ignorance which enveloped his country, call forth the
                    genius of his countrymen, and render them happy. He alſo founded public ſchools,
                    and enacted a law concerning the methods of inſtructing youth, and directing the
                    conduct of the maſters appointed to inftruct them. He died in 1008, and,
                    contrary to all rules of found policy and prudence, divided his empire among his
                    12 fons. The conſequence was, that they fell to making war and deſtroying one
                    another as ſoon as their father was dead. 8uantepolk, one of the brothers,
                    having deſtroyed and ſeized upon the dominions of two others, was himſelf driven
                    out by Ja-riſlaus, and obliged to fly to Boleſlaus king of Poland. This brought
                    on a dreadful war betwixt the Poles and Ruffians ; in which the former were
                    victorious, and the latter loſt a great part of their dominions, as has been
                    related under the article Poland.</p>
                <p>Jariilaus finding himſelf unable to oppoſe the king of Poland, now turned his
                    arms againſt the reſt of his brothers, all of whom he diſpoſſeffed of their
                    dominions, and ſeized them for himſelf. He next attacked the Coſ-ſacks, over w <hi rend="sup">,</hi> hom he gained ſeveral advantages. After which he
                    ventured once more to try his fortune with Boleſlaus : but in this ſecond
                    expedition he was attended with worſe ſucceſs than before ; being now reduced
                    «to the· condition oſ a vaffal and tributary to the</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r03-0556" facs="gri_33125011196389_0562.tif"/>
                <p>victorious monarch. However, in the reign of Miecz-ſlaus II. the ſucceſſor of
                    Boleſlaus, the Ruffians again ſhook off the yoke, and a laſting peace was
                    confirmed by the marriage of Mieczſlaus with the filler of Wolo-domir.</p>
                <p>Jari∏aus now continued to enjoy the empire quietly, and was ſo much addicted to
                    reading, that he devoted even a part of the night to his ſtudies. He invited men
                    of letters to his court, and cauſed many Greek books to be tranſlated into the
                    Ruffian language. It was he that in the year 1019, gave the people of Nowgorod
                    ſeveral laws, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Gramota Sou-d,inaia,</hi> to be obſerved in the courts of juſtice. Theſe are the firſt laws that were
                    reduced to writing in Ruſſia ; and, what renders them remarkable, is the
                    conformity they have with thoſe of the other northern nations. He founded a
                    public ſehool at Novogorod, where he maintained and educated 300 children at his
                    own expence. His court was the moſt brilliant of the north, and furniſhed an
                    aſylum to unfortunate princes. He died in 1052 ; and fell into the ſame error
                    which his father had committed, by dividing his dominions among his five fons.
                    This produced a repetition of the bloody ſcenes which had been acted by the fons
                    of Wolodomir ; the Poles took the advantage of the diſ-tractcd ſtate of affairs
                    to make continual inroads and invaſions ; and the empire continued in the moſt
                    deplorable ſituation till the year 1237, when it was totally ſubdued by the
                    Tartars. We are not informed of any particulars of this remarkable event,
                    farther than that innumerable multitudes of theſe barbarians, headed by their
                    khan Batto, or Battus, after ravaging great part of Poland and Sileſia, broke
                    ſuddenly into Ruſſia, where they committed the greateſt cruelties. Moſt of the
                    RuſſiaH princes, among whom was the great duke George Sevoloditz, were made
                    priſoners, and racked to death ; and, in ſhort, none found mercy but ſuch as
                    acknowledged themſelves the ſubjects of the Tartars. The imperious conqueror
                    impoſed upon the Ruffians every thing that is moſt mortifying in llavery ;
                    inſiſting that they ſhould have no other princes than ſuch as he approved of ;
                    that they ſhould pay him yearly a tribute, to be brought by the fovereigns
                    themſelves on foot, who were to preſent it humbly to the Tartarian ambaſſador on
                    horſeback. They were alſo to proſtrate themſelves before the haughty Tartar ; to
                    offer him milk to drink; and, if any drops of it fell down, to lick theιq up ; a
                    ſingular mark of ſervility, which continued near 260 years.</p>
                <p><hi rend="sup">i</hi> George Seyolodſtz was ſucceeded by his brother Michael
                    Sevoloditz Zernigouſki ; who oppoſed the Tartars, but was defeated by them, and
                    loſt his life. He left three fons, Feodor, Alexander, and Andrew, whoſe wars
                    with each other ended in the death of them all. A fon of Alexander, and of the
                    ſame name, was then placed on the throne by the Tartqrs ; and his ſon Da-nilow,
                    or Daniel Alexandrovitz, removed his court from Wolodimir to Moſcow, where he
                    firſt aſſumed the title of <hi rend="italic">Great duke oſ Wolodimir and
                        Moſcow.</hi> Daniel Alexandrovitz left two fons, Gregory and John ; the
                    former of whom, named <hi rend="italic">Kalita,</hi> from a purſe he uſed
                    always to carry about him filled with money for the poor, aſcended the throne ;
                    but he was ſoon aſſaſſinated by another prince named <hi rend="italic">Demetri
                        Michaelovit%,</hi> who was himſelf put to death for it by the Tartars ; and</p>
                <p>John, likewiſe ſurnamed <hi rend="italic">Kalita,</hi> was then made czar.
                    This John left three fons, John, Simon, anti Andrew ; and the eldeſt of theſe,
                    commonly called <hi rend="italic">Ivan Ivano-vit%,</hi> was made czar, with
                    the approbation of the Tartars, on whom he was dependenr.</p>
                <p>During theſe ſeveral reigns, which fill a ſpace oſ upwards of 100 years, and
                    which all hiſtorians have paffed over for want of records concerning them, the
                    miſeries of a foreign yoke were aggravated by all the calamities of inteſtine
                    diſcord and war ; whilſt the knights of Livonia, or brothers of the ſhort-ſword,
                    as they are ſometimes called, a kind of military order of religious, on one
                    ſide, and the Poles on the other, catching at the opportunity, attacked Ruſſia,
                    and took ſeveral of itβ <hi rend="sub">χ</hi> towns, and even ſome
                    conſiderable countries. The Tartars and Ruffians, whoſe intereſts were in this
                    caſe the ſame, often united to oppoſe their common enemies ; but were generally
                    worſted. The Livonians took Pleſkow ; and the Poles made themſelves mailers of
                    Black Ivuſſia, the Ukraine, Podolia, and the city of Kiow. Caſimir the Great,
                    one of their kings, carried his conqueſts ſtill farther. He aſſerted his
                    pretenſions to a part of Ruſſia, in right of his-relation to Boleſlaus duke of
                    Halitz, who died without iſſue, and forcibly poſſeſſed himſelf of the duchies of
                    Perzemyſlia, Halitz, and Luckow, and of the diſtricts of Sanock, Luback-zow, and
                    Trebowla ; all which countries he made a province oſ Roland.</p>
                <p>The newly-conquered Ruffians were ill-diſpoſed to brook the government of the
                    Poles ; whoſe laws and cuſtoms were more contrary to their own than thoſe of the
                    Tartars had been. They joined the latter to rid themſelves of the yoke ; and
                    aſſembled an army numerous enough to overwhelm all Poland, but deſtitute of
                    valour and diſcipline. Caſimir, undaunted by this deluge of barbarians,
                    preſented himſelf at the head of a few troops on the borders of the Viſtula, and
                    obliged his enemies to retire.</p>
                <p>Demetrius Ivanovitz, ſon of Ivan Ivanovitz, who commanded in Moſcow, made
                    frequent efforts to rid himſelf of the galling yoke. He defeated in ſeveral
                    battles Maymay khan of the Tartars ; and, when conqueror, refuſed to pay them
                    any tribute, and aſſumed the title <hi rend="italic">of great duke oſ Mulcoνy.</hi> But the oppreſſors ol the north returned in greater numbers than before ;
                    and Demetrius, at length overpowered, after a ſtruggle of three years, periſhed
                    with his whole army, which, it we may credit hiſtorians, amounted to upwards of
                    240,oco men. .</p>
                <p>Baſilius Demetrivitz revenged his father’s death. He attacked his enemies, drove
                    them out of his dominions, and conquered Bulgaria. He made an alliance with the
                    Poles, whom he could not ſubdue ; and even ceded to them a part of his country,
                    on condition that they ſhould help him to defend the reſt againſt any new
                    incurſions of the Tartars. But this treaty was a weak barrier againſt ambition.
                    The Ruffians found new enemies in their allies ; and the Tartars ſoon returned.—
                    Baſilius Demetrivitz had a ſon who was called after his name, and to whom the
                    crown ought naturally to have deſcended. «But the father, ſuſpecting his
                    legitimacy, left it to his own brother Gregory, a man of a ſevere and tyrannical
                    diſpoſition, and therefore hated by the people, wlι∙o aſſerted the fon’s right,
                    and proclaimed him their fovereign. I he Tartars took cognizance</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r03-0557" facs="gri_33125011196389_0563.tif"/>
                <p>of the diſpute, and determined it in favour of Baſilius ; upon which Gregory had
                    recourſe to arms, drove his nephew ſrom Moſcow to the principality of Uglitz,
                    and forcibly uſurped and kept poſſeſſion of his throne. Upon the death of
                    Gregory, Baſilius returned to Moſcow ; but Andrew and Demetrius, ſons of the
                    late uſurper, laid liege to that city, and obliged him to retire to the
                    menaſtery oſ Troitz, where they took him priſoner, with his wife and ſon, and
                    put out his eyes : hence the appellation of <hi rend="italic">βmnoi,</hi> “
                    blind,” by which this Baſilius is diſtinguiſhed. The ſubjects of this
                    unfortunate prince, incenſed at the cruel treatment he had received, forced the
                    perpetrators of it to fly to Novo-gorod, and reinſtated their lawful ſovereign
                    at Moſcow, where he died.</p>
                <p>In the midſt of this general conſuſion, John Baſilo-vitz I. by his invincible
                    ſpirit and refined policy, became both the conqueror and deliverer of his
                    country, and laid the firſt foundation of its future grandeur. Obſerving with
                    indignation the narrow limits of his power at his acceſſion to the throne, after
                    the death of his father Baſilius the Blind, he began immediately to revolve
                    within himſelf the means of enlarging his dominions. Marriage, though he had in
                    reality no regard or inclination for women, ſeemed to him one of the beſt
                    expedients he could begin with ; and accordingly he demanded and obtained Maria,
                    filter of Michael duke of Twer ; whom he ſoon after depoied, under pretence of
                    revenging the injuries done to his father, and added this duchy to his own
                    territories of Moſcow. Maria, by whom he had a ſon named <hi rend="italic">John,</hi> who died before him, did not live long ; and upon her ' death he
                    married Sophia, daughter oſ Thomas Paleo-logus, who had been driven ſrom
                    Ccnſtantinople, and forced to take ſhelter at Rome, where the pope portioned
                    this princeſs, in hopes of procuring thereby great advantage to the Romiſh
                    religion; but his expectations were fruſtrated, Sophia being obliged to conform
                    to the Greek church after her arrival in Ruſſia. What could induce Baſilovitz to
                    ſeek a confort at ſuch a diſtance, is nowhere accounted for; unleſs it be, that
                    he hoped by this means to eſtabliſh a pretenſion to the empire of the eaſt, to
                    which her father was the'next heir : but however that may be, the Ruſſians
                    certainly owed to this alliance their deliverance from the Tartar yoke. Shocked
                    at the fervile homage exacted by thoſe proud victors, her huſhand going to meet
                    their ambai-ſadors at ſome diſtance from the city, and ſtanding to hear what
                    they had to ſay ; whilſt they were at dinner, Sophia told him, that ſhe was
                    ſurpriſed to find that ſhe had married a ſervant to the Tartars. Nettled at this
                    reproach, Baſilovitz feigned himſelf ill when the next deputation from the
                    Tartars arrived, and under that pretence avoided a repetition of the ſtipulated
                    humiliating ceremonial. Another circumſtance equally diſ-pleaſing to this
                    princeſs was, that the Tartars had, by agreement, within the walls of the palace
                    at Moſcow, houſes in which their miniſters reſided ; to ſhow their power, and at
                    the ſame time watch the actions of the great duke. To get rid of theſe, a formal
                    embaſſy was ſent to the Tartarian khan, to tell him, that Sophia having been
                    favoured with a viſion ſrom above, ordering her to build a temple in the place
                    where thoſe houſes ſtood, her mind could not be at eaſe till ſhe had fulfilled
                    the divine command; and therefore his leave was deſired fo pull them down, and
                    give his people others. The khan conſented: the houſes within the ' Kremlin were
                    demoliſhed; and no new ones being provided, the Tartar reſidents were obliged to
                    leave Moſcow’ ; their prince not being able to revenge this breach of promiſe,
                    by reaſon of a war he was then engaged in wfith the Poles. Baſilovitz taking
                    advantage of this circumſtance, and having in the mean time conſi-1 derably
                    increaſed his forces, openly diſclaimed all ſub-jection to the Tartars, attacked
                    their dominions, and made himſelf maſter of Caſan, where he was ſolemnly crowned
                    with the diadem of that kingdom, which is ſaid to be the ſame that is now uſed
                    for the coronation of the Ruffian ſovereigns. The province of Permia, with great
                    part of Lapland and Aliatic Bulgaria, ſoon ſubmitted to him ; and Great
                    Novogorod, a city then ſo famous that the Ruffians uſed to expreſs its vaſt
                    importance by the proverbial expreſſion of, <hi rend="italic">Who can re-ββ God
                        and the Great Novogorod ?</hi> was reduced by his generals after a ſeven
                    years ſiege, and yielded him an immenſe treaſure ; no leſs, ſay ſome writers,
                    than 300 cart loads of gold and ſilver, and other valuable effects. Alexander
                    Witold, waiwode of Lithuania, was in poſe ſeſſion of this rich place, from which
                    he had exacted for ſome years an annual tribute of 100,coo rubles, a prodigious
                    ſum for thoſe days and ſor that country. When it was taken by John Baſilovitz,
                    he, the better to ſecure his conqueſt, put it under the protection ol the Poles,
                    voluntarily rendered himſelf their tributary for it, and accepted a governor
                    from the hand of their king Caſimir, a weak and indolent prince, from whom he
                    well knew he had nothing to fear. The No-</p>
                <p>vogorodians continued to enjoy all their privileges till about two years after ;
                    when John, ambitious of reigning without controul, entered their city with a
                    numerous retinue, under pretence of keeping to the Greek faith, he being accuſed
                    of an intention to embrace the Romiſh religion ; and with the aſſiſtance of the
                    archbiſhop Theophilus, ſtripped them all of their remaining riches. He then
                    depoſed the treacherous prelate, and eſtabliſh-ed over Novogorod new
                    magiſtrates, creatures of his own ; deſtroying at once, by this means, a noble
                    city, which, had its liberties been protected, and its trade encouraged, might
                    have proved to him -an inexhauſtible fund of wealth. All the north beheld with
                    terror and alto-niſhment the rapid increaſe of the victor’s power : foreign
                    nations courted his alliance; and the ſeveral petty princes of Ruſſia ſubmitted
                    to him without reſiſtance, acknowledging themſelves his vaſſals.</p>
                <p>The Poles, however, complained loudly of his late breach of ſaith in regard to
                    Novogorod, and threatened revenge : upon which Baſilovitz, elated with his
                    ſuc-ceſſes, with the riches he had amaſſed, and with the weak condition of moſt
                    of his neighbours, ſent a body of troops into Lithuania, and ſoon became maſter
                    oſ ſeveral oſ its towns. Caſimir applied lor aſſiſtance to Matthias king of
                    Hungary : but was anſwered by this laſt, that his own ſoldiers were quite
                    uadiſciplined ; that his auxiliaries had lately mutinied for want of pay; and
                    that it was impoſſible for him to raiſe a new army out of the neighbouring
                    countries. The Poliſh monarch in this diſtreſs was obliged to purchaſe of John a
                    ceſſation oſ arms for two years, during which the Muſcovite made new acceſſions
                    to his dominions.</p>

                    uſed by the Lithuanians on account of their religion, ∙wlιich was that of the
                    Greek church ; and wanted to -withdraw from their*(objection to Poland, and put
                    themſelves under the protection of Ruſſia. The following accident afforded them
                    the wiſhed-for pretence. Their envoys arriving at Wilna, deſired admittance to
                    the king’s preſence : which being refuſed, one of them endeavoured to force his
                    way in ; but the porter ſhut the door rudely againſt him, and in ſo doing broke
                    one -cf his fingers. The ſervant was immediately put to .--death for this
                    offence : but the Servians, by no means ſatisfied with that, returned home in
                    great fury, and prevailed upon their countrymen to ſubmit themſelves and their
                    country to the Muſcovites. Cafimir made ; ſeveral attempts to recall them, but
                    to no purpoſe.</p>
                <p>Matthias king of Hungary dying about this time, two of his ſons, Uladiflaιi6,
                    then king of Bohemia, and i John Albert, contended for the vacant crown. Cafimir
                    -wanted to give it to,the latter, whom he accordingly aſſiſted to the utmoſt of
                    his power ; and to enable him the better ſo to do, though he was in great want
                    of money as well as men, he purchaſed a renewal of the truce with the Ruffians,
                    and thereby gave John Bafi∙ lovitz time to eſtabliſh himſelf in his new
                    acquiſi-tions.</p>
                <p>Cafimir died in the year 1492, and was ſucceeded on the throne of Poland by his
                    ſon John Albert, w ho, totally diſregarding the Ruffians, involved himſelf
                    un-neceffarily in a war with the brave Stephen duke of Moldavia : and though he
                    had at the ſame time both the Tartars and Tufks againſt him, his propenſity to
                    pleaſure, and his laſeivious diſpofition, rendered him ſo indolent, that he not
                    only did not ſo much as attempt to moleſt Bafilowitz in any of his poffeſſions,
                    but concluded a peace with him on terms very advantageous tp the latter ; and
                    even entered into a treaty, by which he ſtipulated not to aſſiſt the
                    Lithuanians, though they had choſen his brother Alexander for their duke, in
                    caſe the Ruffians ſhould attack them, as it was ſuppoſed they would. Alexander
                    thinking to parry the inconveniences of this agreement, and to guard againſt the
                    deſigns of his enemies, demanded in marriage Ba-ſilowitz’s daughter, Helena, by
                    his ſecond wife Sophia, and obtained her. The Lithuanians then flattered
                    themſelves with a profpect of tranquillity : but the ambitious <hi rend="italic"
                        > czar,</hi> for Bafilovitz had affumed that title ſince bis conqueſt of
                    Caſan, aiming only at the increaſe of dominion, ſoon found a pretence to break
                    with his new allies, by alleging, that Poliſh Ruſſia, as far as the ri-∙,ver
                    Berezina, had formerly belonged to his anceſtors, --and therefore ſhould be his
                    ; and that Alexander, by his marriage-contract, had engaged to build a Greek
                    church at Wilna for his Ruffian conſort, which he had not done, but on the
                    contrary endeavoured to force the Poliſh Ruffians to embrace the religion of the
                    church of Rome. In conſequence of this plea, he ſent into the territories of his
                    ſon-in-law, by different ways, i three armies, which reduced ſeveral places,
                    deſtroyed the country about Smojenſko, and defeated the Lithu∙ .anian
                    ſield-marſhal Oſtroſky near the river Wedr'alch, where he fell unawares into an
                    ambuſh cf the Ruffians. Alexander raiſed a new army of Sijeſians, Bohemians, and
                    Moravians ; but they came too late, the Ruffians having retired with their
                    plunder. Elated by their ſucceſs againſt the Lithuanians, they invaded Livonia
                    -in the year 1502, with 130,000 men : but Walter Von Plettenberg, grand-maſter
                    of the knights of the croſs, with only 12,000 men, gave them a total overthrow ;
                    -killing 10,000 of his enemies, with ſcarce any lofs on his own fide. Bafilovitz
                    diipirited by this defeat, and being then engaged in a war with the Tartars, the
                    Poles, and the city of Pleſkow; immediately diſpatched an embaffy to
                    Plettenberg, and concluded a truce with him for 50 years. At the ſame time he
                    begged of that general to ſend to Moſcow, that he might ſee him, one of the <hi
                        rend="italic"> iron-dragoons,</hi> as he called them, who had performed
                    wonders iια the late engagement. Von Plettenberg readily complied ; and the
                    czar, ſtruck with admiration, rewarded the cuiraſſier’s accompliſhments with
                    conſiderable honours and preſents.</p>
                <p>Alexander had been elected king of Poland upon the death of his brother John
                    Albert, which happened in the beginning of this year : but the Poles refuſed to
                    crown his confort Helena, becauſe ſhe adhered to the Greek religion. Provoked at
                    this affront, and probably ſtill more ſtimulated by ambition, Bafilovitz
                    reſolved again to try his fortune with them; and accordingly ordered his ſon
                    Demetrius, now the eldeſt, to march againſt Smolenſko, and reduce that city. The
                    young prince did all that could be done : but the vigorous refiſtance of the
                    belieged, and the arrival of the king of Poland with a numerous army, obliged
                    the Ruffians to raiſe the fiege and return home ; and the czar was glad to make
                    a freſh truce with the Poles for fix years, upon the eaſy terms of only
                    returning the priſoners he had taken. Some writers ſay, that flying into a
                    violent paſſion with his ſon the moment he ſaw him, and imputing the miſcarriage
                    oſ this expedition to his want of courage or conduct, he gave him a blow which
                    laid him dead at his feet ; to which is added, that remorſe for this raſſi
                    action carried his father to his grave: but this account is not confirmed by
                    authors whoſe authority can be relied on. Certain it is, however, that neither
                    of them long furvived this event; and that Demetrius died firſt : for Sophia,
                    who had gained an abſolute aſcendant over her huſhand, and wanted to give the
                    ſovereignty to her own children, perfiιaded him by various artful infinuations
                    to ſet afide and im-priſon his grandſon Demetrius, the only child of the late
                    John, whom he had by his firſt wife Maria, and declare her then eldeſt ſon,
                    Gabriel, his ſucceffor. Age and infirmities had rendered the czar ſo weak, that
                    he blindly followed the iniquitous advice ; but ſhortly after finding his end
                    approach, he ſent for young Demetrius, expreffed great repentance for his
                    barbarity towards him, and on his death-bed declared him his lawful ſucceffor.
                    He died in November 1 705, after a reign of 55 years; leaving behind him an
                    immenſe territory, chiefly of his own acquiring.</p>
                <p>The czar was no ſooner dead, than his ſon Gabriel Ivanovitz, at the ^inftigation
                    of his mother Sophia, put an end to,the life of the young Demetrius, by
                    confining him in priſon, where heperiſhed with hunger and cold; alter which

                <p>election oſ Sigiſmund I. a prince of a mild and peaceable diſpoſition, he ſent
                    an army into Lithuania, and laid ſiege to Smolenſko. The place made a brave
                    reſiſtance, till news arrived that the crown-troops of Poland were coming to
                    their aſſiſtance, with the additional aid of 80,000 Crim Tartars ; on which the
                    Ruffians returned home with the utmoſt precipitation. They were, however,
                    quickly followed by the Poles, who reduced the czar, to ſubmit to ſuch terms as
                    they pleaſed to impoſe. Baſilius remained quiet till he thought himſelf capable
                    of revenging the injuries he had ſuſtained ; after which, pretending to ſet out
                    upon ſome other expedition, he marched with a numerous army, and encamped in the
                    neighbourhood of Pleſkow, where the Poles, prefuming∙ on the late treaty,
                    received him as a friend and ally. But in the mean time the Muſeovite prieſts oſ
                    the Greek church preached to their hearers concerning the expediency of having a
                    fovereign of their own religion ; and brought them to ſuch a height of
                    enthufιafm,that they murdered their magiſtrates, and opened their gates to the
                    czar, who made them all ilaves, and ſent them away' to different parts,
                    replacing them with Muſcovites, the better to ſecure his conqueſt. Soon after he
                    took alſo the city of Smolenſko ; and the Swedes, alarmed at his rapid progreſs,
                    deſired a prolongation of the truce, at that time ſub-liſting between the two
                    ſtates, for 6o years longer. The duchy of Lithuania was the great object of the
                    deſigns of Baſilius ; and to accompliſh his deſign, he ordered Ivan Czeladin, a
                    man of great reſolution, and enterprifing even to raſhneſs, to march thither
                    with 80,000 men. The army of the Poles did not exceed 35,000 men, but was
                    commanded by a moſt experienced general. The two armies met on the oppoſite
                    banks oſ the Dneiper, near Orſova, and the Poles paffed that river in fight of
                    their enemies. Czeladin’s officers adviſed him to fall upon the enemy when about
                    half of them had croſſed the river ; but that general, too confident of ſucceſs,
                    replied, that the other half would then run away, and he was determined to gain
                    a complete victory. The Lithuanians began the attack, but were repulſed by the
                    Ruffians ; who imprudently following them, loſt an advantageous ſituation, and
                    found themſelves at once expoſed to the full fire of the enemy’s artillery. The
                    Poliſh cavalry then ruſhed in among them ſword in hand, and made dreadful havoc
                    ; the trembling Ruffians ſcarce even attempting to defend themſelves. Thoſe who
                    endeavoured to fly, fell into the Dneiper and'were drowned ; and all the reſt,
                    including Czeladin himſelf, were made ſlaves.</p>
                <p>Baſilius was at Smolenſko when he received the news of this dreadful defeat ; on
                    which he immediately fled* to Moſcow, where his danger increaſed daily. The
                    Crim-Tartars ravaged his dominions, and the emperor Maximilian, with whom he had
                    been in alliance, deſerted him ; his troops, were utterly defeated in Iri-vonia,
                    where he was obliged to ſubmirto a peace on diſhonourable terms ; but what theſe
                    terms were hiſtorians do not inform.us. In the mean time, the king of Poland
                    ſtirred up the Tartars to invade Ruſſia, while the Ruffian monarch in his turn
                    endeavoured to excite them to an invaſion of Poland. Theſe barbarians, equally
                    treacherous to both parties, firſt invaded and ravaged Podolia, a province of
                    Poland ; and then having invaded Ruſſia and defeated the armies of the czar in
                    the year 1521, they poured in thither in ſuch incredible multitudes, that they
                    quickly made themſelves maſters of Moſcow. An army, which had been ſent to
                    oppoſe their progreſs, was defeated near the riveT Occa ; and the czar’s brother
                    Andrew, who commanded it, was the very firſt who fled. Baſilius with great
                    difficulty made his way to Novogorod ; ſo terrified, that he hid himſelf by the
                    way under a haycock, to avoid a ſtraggling party of the enemy. The Tartars,
                    however, ſoon obliged him to ſign a writing, by which he acknowledged himſelf
                    their vaſſal, and promiſed to pay, them a tribute of ſo much a head for every
                    one of his ſubjects. Beſides this, Machmetgerei, the commander of the Tartars,
                    cauſed his own ſtatuq to be ſet up at Moſcow, as a mark of his ſovereignty;
                    compelled Baſilius to return to his capital, to bring thither in perſon the
                    firſt payment of this tribute, and <hi rend="sub">i</hi> as a token of his
                    ſubmiſſion, to proſtrate himſelf before his ſtatue. Machmetgerei then left
                    Moſcow, and returned home with an immenſe booty, and upwards of 80,000
                    priſoners, who were made ſlaves, and ſold like cattle to the Turks and other
                    enemies of the Chriſtian name. In his way back.he attempted to take the city of
                    Rezan ; but was repulſed with conſiderable loſs by I wan Ko wen, who commanded
                    in that place for the Ruffians. Here the Tartar general narrowly eſcaped with
                    his life, his coat being ſhot through with a mu-ſket-ball ; andthe Muſcovites
                    pulled down his ſtatue, and broke it to pieces as ſoon as the conquerors had
                    left them.</p>
                <p>The Tartars were no ſooner gone, than Baſilius began to talk in a high ſtrain of
                    the revenge he intended to take of them ; but was never abſe to execute his
                    threats. He died in 1533 ; and was ſucceeded by his ſon Ivan or John Baſilovitz,
                    an infant of -five years of age.</p>
                <p>During the minority of the young prince, his two uncles Andrew and George
                    endeavoured to deprive him of the crown; but their attempts were defeated by the
                    care and activity of his guardians ; and the Poles alſo immediately commenced
                    hoſtilities, but could make little progreſs. The new czar, as ſoon a3 he entered
                    the 19th year of his age, ſhowed an inclination ſor re-ſeuing his ſubjects out
                    of that deſperate ſtate of ignorance and barbariſm in which they had been
                    hitherto immerſed. Pie ſent a ſplendid embaſſy to the emperor Charles V. who was
                    then at Augſhurg, to deſire the renewal of the treaty of friendſhip which had
                    been concluded with his father Maximilian ; and offering to enter into a league
                    with him againſt the Turks, as enemies to the Chriſtian religion ; for his
                    farther information in which, particularly in regard to the doctrine and
                    ceremonies of the Latin church, he requeſted that his ambaſſador might be
                    allowed to ſend from Germany to Ruſſia proper prieſts to inſtruct him and his
                    ſubjects. With theſe he likewiſe deſired to have ſome wiſe and experienced
                    ſtateſmen, able to civilize the wild people under his government ; and alſo, the
                    better to help to poliſh them, he requeſted that he would ſend mechanics and
                    artiſts of every kind ; in return ſor all which he offered to furniſh two tons
                    of gold yearly, for 20 years together, to be employed in the war againſt the
                    Turks. The emperor readily agreed to the deſire of the czar ; and the Ruffian
                    ambaſſador accordingly en-</p>

                <p>gaged upwards of 300 German artiſts, who were directed to repair to Lubec, in
                    order to proceed from thence to Livonia, But the Lubeckers, who were very
                    powerful at that time, and aimed at nothing leſs than the engroſſing of the
                    whole commerce of the north, ſtopped them, and repreſented ſtrongly to the
                    emperor, in the name of all the merchants in Livonia, the dangerous conſequence
                    oſ thus affording inſtructions to the Ruſſians, who would ſoon avail themſelves
                    of it to ruin their trade, and diſtreſs the ſubjects of his imperial majeſty.
                    The workmen and others intended for Ruſſia were eaſily prevailed upon to return
                    to their re-ſpective homes; and the czar’s ambaſſador was arreſted upon his
                    arrival at Lubec, and impriſoned there at the fuit of the Livonians : however,
                    he made his eſcape ſhortly after ; and the czar, though provoked to the laſt
                    degree at the behaviour of the Lubeckers, was obliged for ſome time to ſuſpend
                    his reſentment.</p>
                <p>The firſt enterpriſe oſ Baſilovitz now was againſt the Tartars of Caſan, who had
                    hitherto been ſuch formidable enemies. In this he was attended with great
                    ſucceſs ; the whole territory was conquered in ſeven years ; but the capital,
                    named alſo <hi rend="italic">Caſan,</hi> being well fortified and bravely
                    defended, made ſuch reſiſtance as quite diſheartened the beſiegers, and made
                    them think of abandoning their enterpriſe. <hi rend="sup">i</hi> Baſilovitz
                    being informed of this, haſtened to them with a conſiderable reinforcement,
                    endeavoured to revive their drooping courage, and exhorted them to puſh the
                    ſiege with redoubled vigour. However, the greater part, deaf to all his
                    remonſtrances, after loudly inſiſting upon a peace with the Tartars, and leave
                    to return home, proceeded to mutiny, and fell upon their comrades who were for
                    continuing the war. Baſilovitz, alarmed at this event, ruſhed in among the
                    combatants, and with great difficulty parted them : but neither menaces nor
                    intreaties, nor even a promiſe of giving them the whole plunder of the city if
                    they took it, could prevail on them to continue the war. Their rage at laſt
                    prompted them to threaten the life of their ſovereign ; who, to provide for his
                    own ſafety, was obliged to make the beſt of his way to Moſcow ; and the
                    mutineers, no longer regarding any command, inſtantly returned thither.</p>
                <p>Baſilovitz, though juſtly incenſed at this inſolence, took a method of puniſhing
                    it which does honour to his humanity. Having ſelected a guard of 2c00 of his
                    beſt troops, he ordered a great feaſt, to which he invited his principal nobles
                    and officers, to each of whom, according to the Ruffian cuſtom, he gave very
                    rich garments. The chief of the ſeditious were clothed in black velvet ; and
                    after the dinner was over, he made a ſpeech to the whole company, ſetting forth
                    the behaviour of his troops before Caſan, their contempt of his commands, and
                    their conſpiracy to take away his life : to which he added, that he was doubly
                    ſorry to find the inſtigators of ſuch wickedneſs among thoſe who were ſtyled,
                    and who ought to be, his faithful counſellors ; and that thoſe who knew
                    themſelves to be guilty of ſuch atrocious wickedneſs could not do better than
                    voluntarily to ſubmit themſelves to his mercy. Upon this, moſt of them
                    immediately threw themſelves at his ſeet, and implored his pardon. Some -of the
                    moſt criminal were executed, but the reſt were only impriſoned.</p>
                <p>Immediately after this puniſhmeut of the rebels, Baſilovitz inarched with a
                    freſh army to re-inveſt Ca* ſan before the Tartars had time to recover
                    themſelves. The beſieged ſtill made an obſtinate defence, and the Ruſſians again
                    began to be cliſpirited ; upon which the czar ordered his pioneers to undermine
                    the walls of the citadel, a practice then quite unknown to the Tartars. This
                    work being completed, he directed his prieſts to read a ſolemn maſs to the whole
                    army, at the head of which he afterwards ſpent ſome time in private prayer, and
                    then ordered fire to be ſet to the powder, which acted ſo effectually, that
                    great part of the foundation was immediately blown up, and the Muſcovites
                    ruſhing into the city, ſlaughtered all before them ; while the aſtoniſhed
                    Tartars, crowding out at the oppoſite gate, croſſed the river Caſanka, and fled
                    into the. foreſts. Among the priſoners taken on this occaſion were Simeon king
                    of Caſan with his queen; both of whom were ſent to Moſcow, where they were
                    treated with the utmoſt civility and reſpect.</p>
                <p>Encouraged by this ſucceſs, Baſilovitz invaded the country of Aſtracan, the
                    capital of which he ſoon reduced ; after which he prepared to revenge himſelf on
                    the Livonians for their behaviour in flopping the German artiſts. John
                    Baſilovitz I. had concluded a truce with this people for 50 years ; which being
                    now expired, Iodocus, archbiſhop of Dorpt and canon of Munſter in Weſtphalia,
                    ſenlible of the danger to which he was expoſed by the vicinity of the Ruſſians,
                    requeſted the czar to give him a prolongation of the truce. .Baſilovitz deſired
                    him to chooſe whether he would have a truce for five years longer, on condition
                    that all the inhabitants of his archbiſhopric ſhould pay to him the annual
                    tribute of a fifth part of a ducat for each perſon, which the people of Γ)orpt
                    had formerly agreed to pay to the grand-dukes of Pleſkow ; or, for 20 years, on
                    this farther condition that he and the Livonians ſhould rebuild all the Ruffian
                    churches which had been demoliſhed in their territories at the time of the
                    reformation, and allow his ſubjects the free exerciſe of their religion. Iodocus
                    evaded an anſwer as long as he could : but finding at laſt that the affair grew
                    ſerious, he levied a conſiderable ſum from his ſubjects, and fled with it to
                    Munſter, where he re· ſigned his prebend and married a wife. His ſucceſlbr,
                    whoſe name was <hi rend="italic">Herman,</hi> and the deputies from Livonia,
                    accepted of the conditions, and ſwore to obſerve them ; with this additional
                    clauſe, that the prieſts of the Romiſh communion ſhould be exempted from paying
                    tribute.</p>
                <p>But though the Livonians ſwore to the obſervation of theſe terms, they were at
                    that very time in treaty with GuſtavuS Vaſa, king of Sweden, to join them in
                    attacking Ruſſia. <hi rend="sup">r</hi> Γhe king of Sweden very readily
                    complied with their deſires ; upon which Balilowitz invaded Finland. Guſtavus
                    advanced againſt him with a powerful army ; but as neither the Poles nor
                    Livonians gave him any aſſiſtance, he was obliged to conclude a treaty with the
                    czar, and ſoon after to evacuate the country. Finland was at this time governed
                    by William of Furſtenberg grand-maſter of the Livonian knights, and the

                    about this time, which ſoon facilitated the deſigns of Baſilovitz on the

                <p>tempting to ſet himſelf above the grand-maſter even in civil affairs, and to
                    perſecute thoſe who adhered" to the conſeſſion of Augſhurg, choſe for his
                    coadjutor in the archbiſhopric of Riga Chriſtopher duke of Mecklenburg. From the
                    abilities and haughty temper of this lord, the Livonian knights apprehended that
                    they had reaſon to fear the ſame fate which had befallen the Teutonic order in
                    Pruſſia ; and the ffep itſelf was, beſides, unprecedented, and contrary to the
                    eſtabliſhed laws of the count!y. Theſe diſcontents were heightened by letters
                    ſaid to be intercepted from the archbiſhop to his brother Albert duke of
                    Pruſſia, inviting this laſt totally to ſuppreſs the order of Livonian knights,
                    and to ſecularize their poſſeſſions, eſpecially in Finland ; ſo that an open war
                    broke out among the contending parties, and the archbiſhop was ſeized and made
                    priſoner. He was, however, ſoon releaſed through the mediation of the emperor of
                    Germany and other potentates, backed by the powerful preparations of the
                    Pruſſians to avenge his cauſe ; but in the mean time, the ſtrength of their
                    country being totally exhauſted, the Livonians were obliged, inſtead of
                    preparing for war, to ſue to the Czar ſor peace. Baſilovitz replied, that he did
                    not believe their intentions to be ſincere while they kept 6ooo Germans in pay ;
                    and therefore, if they meant to treat of peace, they muſt begin with diſrniſſing
                    theſe troops. The Livonians, having no longer any power to reſiſt, did as they
                    were ordered ; but it availed them nothing. In 1558 an army of 100,000 Ruffians
                    entered the diſtrict of Dorpt, and laid every thing waſte before them with the
                    moſt ſhocking cruelty. Aſter this they entered the territories of Riga, where
                    they behaved with equal inhumanity ; and ſhaving at laſt ſatiated themſelves
                    with blood and treaſure, they retired with an immenſe booty and a great number
                    of priſoners.</p>
                <p>The Livonians, now thoroughly convinced of their own folly in expofing
                    themſelves to the reſentment of the exaſperated Ruffians, ſent ambaſſadors to
                    ſue for peace in good earnel⅛. Theſe offered the Czar a preſent oſ 30,00Θ
                    ducats, and prevailed upon him to grant their nation a truce for four months,
                    during which they returned home to get the money. But in this interval the
                    Livonian governor of the city of Nerva, out of an idle frolic, fired ſome cannon
                    againſt Ivanogorod or Ruſſian Nerva, ſituated on the oppoſite fide of the river,
                    and killed ſeveral of the Czar’s ſubjects who were aſſembled in an open place
                    quite unarmed. The Ruffians, out of regard to the truce, did not even attempt to
                    make repriſals ; but immediately acquainted Baſilovitz with what had happened :
                    which ſo incenſed the Czar, that when the Livonian ambaſſadors arrived, he told
                    them, he looked upon their nation to be a ſet of perjured wretches, who had
                    renounced all honeſty; that they might go back with their money and propoſals,
                    and let their countrymen know that his vengeance would ſoon overtake them.</p>
                <p>The ambaſſadors were ſcarce arrived in Livonia, when an army of 300,000 Ruffians
                    entered the diſtrict of Ner-va, under the command of Peter Siſegaledrii, who had
                    been a famous pirate in the Euxi∏e ſea. He took the city of Nerva in nine days,
                    and very ſpeedily made himſelf maſter oſ Dorpt, where he found immenſe
                    treaſures. Several other garriſons, terrified by the approach of ſuch numbers,
                    quitted their poſts ; ſo that the Ruffians became maſters of a great part of
                    Livonia almoſt without oppoſition. At laſt, Gothard Kettler, grand-maſter of the
                    knights of Livonia, intreated Chriſtian III. king of Denmark to take Riga,
                    Revel, and the countries of Garnland, Wirrland, and Eſthonia, under his
                    protection ; but the advanced age of that monarch, the diſtance of the places,
                    and the want of ſuſſicient power to withſtand ſo potent an adversary, made him
                    decline the offer. However, he aſſiſted them with ſome money and powder, of
                    which they ſtood greatly in need. Having then applied, without ſucceſs, firſt to
                    the emperor of Germany, and then to the court of Sweden, Kettler put himſelf
                    under the protection of the Poles, who had hitherto been ſuch formidable enemies
                    to the Ruffians. In the mean time the latter purfued their conqueſts ; they took
                    the city of Marienburg, laid waſte the diſtrict of Riga, deſtroyed Garnland, and
                    penetrated to the very gates of Revel. Felin, in which was the beſt artillery of
                    the whole country, became theirs by the treachery of its garriſon ; and here
                    William of Furſtenberg the old grand-maſter was taken, and ended his days in a
                    priſon at Moſcow. The diſtracted ſituation of the Livonian affairs now induced
                    the biſhop of Oeſel to ſell his biſhopric to Ferdinand king of Denmark, who
                    exchanged it with his brother Magnus for a part of Hol-ſtein. The diſtricts of
                    Reval and Eſthonia put themſelves under the protection of Sweden ; and then the
                    grand-maſter, finding himſelf deſerted on all ſides, ſup-preſſed the order of
                    which he was the chief, and accepted of the duchy of Courland, which he held as
                    a fief of the crown of Poland.</p>
                <p>The Czar ſaw with pleaſure the diviſion of Livonia between the Swedes and Poles,
                    which, he rightly judged, would produce quarrels between the two nations, and
                    thus give him the fairer opportunity of ſeizing the whole to himſelf.
                    Accordingly, in 1564, the Swedes offered him their aſſiſtance againſt the Poles
                    ; but he, judging himſelf to be ſuſſiciently ſtrong without them, attacked the
                    Poles with his own forces, and w <hi rend="sup">,</hi> as twice defeated,
                    which checked his farther operations in Livonia. In 1569 he entered into a
                    treaty of commerce with England, captain Richard Chancellor having a ſhort time
                    before diſeovered a paſſage to Archangel in Ruſſia through the White Sea, by
                    which that empire Was likely to be ſupplied with foreign goods, without the
                    aſſiſtance either of Poland or Livonia. To the diſcoverers of this new paſſage
                    Baſilovitz granted many excluſive privileges ; and after the death of queen
                    -Mary renewed the alliance with queen Elizabeth, and which has been continued
                    without interruption ever ſince.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, however, a prodigious army of Turks and 'Partais entered
                    Muſcovy, with a deſign to ſubdue the whole country. But Zerebrinov, the Czar’s
                    general, having attacked them in a defile,. put them to flight with
                    ∙conliderable daughter. Then they retired towards the mouth of the Volga, where
                    they expected a conſiderable reinforcement ; but being cloſely purſued by the
                    Ruffians and Tartars in alliance with them, they were agai-n defeated and forced
                    to fly towards Azov on the Black Sea. But when they came there, they found the
                    city almoſt entirely ruined by the blowing up of a powder magazine. The Ruffians
                    then attacked their ſhips there, took ſome, and ſunk the reſt ; by which means
                    almoſt the whole army periſhed with hunger or the ſword of the enemy.</p>
                <p>From this time the empire oſ Ruſſia became ſo for-</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r03-0562" facs="gri_33125011196389_0568.tif"/>
                <p>tnidable, that none of the neighbouring nations could hope to make a total
                    conqueſt of it. The Poles and Swedes indeed continued to be very formidable
                    enemies ; and, by the inſtigation of the former, the Crirn Tartars, in 157τ,
                    again invaded the country with an army of 70,000 men. The Ruffians, who might
                    have prevented their paſſing the Volga, retired before them till they came
                    within 18 miles of the city of Moſcow, where they were totally defeated. The
                    Czar no ſooner heard this news than he retired with his moſt valuable effects to
                    a well-fortified cloyſter ; upon which the Tartars entered the city, plundered
                    it, and ſet fire to ſeveral churches. A violent ſtorm which happened at the ſame
                    lime ſoon ſpread the flames all over the city ; which was entirely reduced to
                    aſhes in fix hours, though its circumference was upwards of 40 miles. The fire
                    likewiſe communicated· itſelf to a powder-magazine at ſome diſtance from the
                    city ; by which accident upwards of 50 rods of the city wall, with all the
                    buildings upon it, were deſtroyed ; and, according to the beſt hiſtorians,
                    upwards of x20,000 citizens were burnt or buried in the ruins, befides women,
                    children, and foreigners. The caſtle, however, vyhich was ſtrongly fortified,
                    could not be taken; and the Tartars hearing that a formidable army was coming
                    againſt them under the command of Magnus duke of Holſtein, whom Bafilovitz had
                    made king of Livonia, thought proper to retire. The war, never-theleſs,
                    continued with the Poles and Swedes ; and the Czar being defeated by the latter
                    after ſome trifling ſucceſs, was reduced to the neceſſity of ſuing for peace.
                    But the negotiations being ſomehow or other broken off, the war was renewed with
                    the greateſt vigour. The Livonians, Poles, and Swedes, having united in a league
                    together againſt the Ruffians, gained great advantages over them; and, in 1579,
                    Stephen Battori, who was then raiſed to the throne of Poland, levied an army
                    expreſsly with a deſign of invading Ruſſia, and of regaining all that Poland had
                    formerly claimed, which indeed was little leſa than the whole empire. Aa the
                    Roles underſtood the art of war much better than the Ruffians, Bafilovitz found
                    his undiſeiplined multitudes unable to cope with the regular forces of his
                    enemies : and their conqueſts were fo rapid, that he was ſoon obliged to ſue for
                    peace : which, however, was not granted ; and it is poſſible that the number of
                    enemies which now attacked Ruſſia might have overcome the empire entirely, had
                    not the allies grown jealous of each other; the conſequence of which was, that
                    in 1582 a peace was concluded with the Poles, in which the Swedes were not
                    comprehended. However, the Swedes finding themſelves unable to effect any thing
                    of moment after the deſertion of their allies, were fain to conclude a truce ;
                    ſhortly after which the Czar, having been worſted in an engagement with the
                    Tartars, died in the year 1584.</p>
                <p>This great prince was ſucceeded by his ſon Theodore Ivanovitfc ; a man of ſuch
                    weak underſtanding, that he was totally unfit for government. Under him,
                    therefore, the Ruffian affairs fell into confuſion ; and Boris Gudenov, a
                    nobleman whoſe fiſter Theodore had married, found means to affume all the
                    authority. At laſt, unable to bear even the name of a ſuperior, he reſolved to
                    uſurp the throne. For this purpoſe he cauſed the Czar’s brother Demetrius, at
                    that time only •nine years of age, to be affaſſinated ; and afterwards, knowing
                    that no truſt could be put in an aſſaffin, he cauſed him alfo to be murdered
                    left he ſhould divulge the ſecret. In 1597 the Czar himſelf was taken ill and
                    died, not without great ſuſpicion of his being poi-ſoned by Gudenov ; of which
                    indeed the Czarina was ſo well convinced, that ſhe would never afterwards ſpeak
                    to her brother.</p>
                <p>With Theodore ended' the line of Ruric, who had governed the empire of Ruſſia
                    for upwards of 700 years. Boris, who in reality was poffeffed of all the power,
                    and would indeed have ſuffered nobody elſe to reign, artfully pretended to be
                    unwilling to accept the crown, till compelled to it by the intreaties of the
                    people ; and even then he put the acceptance of it on the iffue of an expedition
                    which he was about to undertake againſt the Tartars. The truth of the matter,
                    however, was, that no Tartar army was in the field, nor had Boris any intention
                    of invading that country ; but by this pretence he aiΓembled an army of 500,000
                    men, which he thought the moſt effectual method of ſecuring himſelf in his new
                    dignity. In 1600 he concluded a peace with the Poles, but reſolved to continue
                    the war againſt the Swedes ; however, being diſappoint-ed in ſome of his
                    attempts againſt that nation, he entered into an a∏iance with the Swediſh
                    monarch, and even propoſed a match between the king’s brother and his daughter.
                    But while theſe things were in agitation, the city of Moſcow was defolated by
                    one of the moſt dreadful famines recorded in hiſtory. Thouſands of people lay
                    dead in the ſtreets and highways, with their mouths full of hay, ſtraw, or even
                    the moſt filthy things which they had been attempting to eat. In many houſes the
                    fatteſt perfon was killed in order to ſerve for food to the reſt. Parents were
                    ſaid to have eaten their children, and children their parents, or to have fold
                    them to buy bread. One author (Petrius) ſays, that he himſeli ſaw a woman bite
                    ſeveral pieces out of a child’s arm as ſhe was carrying it along; and captain
                    Margaret relates, that four women having ordered <hi rend="italic">a</hi> peaſant to come to one of their houſes, under pretence of paying him for ſome
                    wood, killed and eat up both him and his horſe. This dreadful calamity laſted
                    three years, notwithſtand-ing all the means which Boris could uſe to alleviate
                    it ; and in this time upwards of 500,000 people periſhed ia the city.</p>
                <p>In 1604 a young man appeared, who pretended to be Demetrius, whom Boris had
                    cauſed to ſhe murdered, as we have already ſeen. Being ſupported by the Poles,
                    he .proved very troubleſome to Boris all his lifetime ; and after his death
                    deprived Theodore Boriflbvitz, the new Czar, of the empire ; after which he
                    aſcended the throne himſelf, and married a Poliſh princeſs. However, he held the
                    empire but a iħort time, being killed in an inſurrection of his ſubjectsj and
                    the unhappy Czarina was ſent priſoner to Jaroflaw.</p>
                <p>After the death of Demetrius, Ztrflti, who had conſpired againſt him, was choſen
                    Czar; but rebellions continually taking place, and the empire being perpetually
                    haraffed by the Poles and Swedes, in 1610 Zuſki was depoſed, and Uladi∏aus ſon
                    of Sigiſmund king of Poland was elected. However, the Poles repreſenting to
                    Sigiſmund, that it would be more glorious for him to be the conqueror of Ruſſia,
                    than only the father of its ſovereign, he carried on the war with ſuch fury,
                    that the Ruffians-in deſpair fell upon the Poles, who refided in great numbers
                    at Moſcow. The Poles being well</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r03-0563" facs="gri_33125011196389_0569.tif"/>
                <p>armed and moſtly ſoldiers, had greatly the advantage ; however, they were on the
                    point of being op preſſed by numbers, when they fell upon the moſt cruel method
                    of enſuring their ſucceſs that could be deviſed. This was by ſetting fire to the
                    city in ſeveral places } and while the diſtreſſed Ruſſians ran to ſave their
                    families, the Poles fell upon them ſword in hand. In this confuſion upwards of
                    iσo,ooo peop⅛ periſhed; but the event was, that the Roles were finally driven
                    oüt, and loſt all footing in Ruffià.</p>
                <p>The expnllion of the Poles was ſucceeded by the election of Tſheodorovitz
                    Romanov, a young nobleman of 17 years of age, whoſe poſterity, till the
                    acceſſion of the preſent Empreſs, continued to enjoy the fo-vereignty. He died
                    in 1646, and was ſucceeded by his ſon Alexis ; whoſe reign was a continued ſcene
                    of tumult and confuſion, being haraſſcd on all ſides by external enemies, and
                    having his empire perpetually diſ-turbed by internal commotions.</p>
                <p>The ſources of theſe commotions were found in the multiplicity and inconſiſtency
                    of the laws at that period, and in the jarring claims of the nobles on the
                    borders. An <hi rend="italic">emann∙y ukaſe,</hi> or personal order, which is
                    an edict of the ſovereign, ſigned with his own hand, is the only law oſ Ruſſia.
                    Theſe edicts are as various as the opinions, prejudices, paſſion-s, or whims of
                    men ; and in the days of Alexis they produced endleſs contentions. To remedy
                    this evil, he made a Election, from all the edicts of his predeceſſiors, of ſuch
                    as had been familiarly current ſor a hundred years ; prtſuming that thoſe either
                    were founded in natural juſtice, or during ſo long a currency had formed the
                    minds of the people to conſider them as juſt. This digeſt, w hich he declared to
                    be the common law of Ruſſia, and which is prefaced by a fort of inſtitute, is
                    the ſtandard law-book at this day known by the title of the <hi rend="italic">Ulogeniè</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Selection;</hi> and all edicts prior
                    to it were declared to be obſolete. He ſoon made his <hi rend="italic">novella,</hi> however, more bulky than tſhe Ulogeniè ; and the additions by his
                    ſucceſſors are beyond enumeration. This was undoubtedly a great and uſe-ful work
                    ; but Alexis performed another ſtill greater.</p>
                <p>Though there are many courts of judicature in this widely extended empire, the
                    emperor has always been lord paramount, and could take a cauſe from any court
                    immediately before himſelf. But as ſeveral of the old nobles had the remains of
                    principalities in their families, and held their own courts, the ſovereign or
                    his mini-fters, at a diſtance up the country, frequently found it difficult to
                    bring a culprit out of one of theſe hereditary feudal juriſdictions, and try him
                    by the laws of the empire. This was a very diſagreeable limitation of imperial
                    power; and the more ſo, that ſome families claimed even a right to repledge. A
                    lucky opportunity offered of ſettling this diſpute } and Alexis embraced it with
                    great ability.</p>
                <p>Some families on the old frontiers were taxed with their defence, for which they
                    were obliged to keep regiments on foot ; and as they were but lcantily
                    indemnified by the ſtate, it ſometimes required the exertion of authority to
                    make them keep up their levies. When the frontiers, by the conqueſt of Caſan,
                    were ſar extended, thoſe gentlemen found the regiments no longer bur-denſome,
                    becauſe by the help of falſe muſters, the former ſcanty allowance much more than
                    reimburſed (them for the exnence of the eſtabliſhment, The conſe-</p>
                <p>quence was, that diſputes aroſe among them about the right of guarding certain
                    diſtricts, and law-ſuits were neceſſary to fettle their reſpective claims. Theſe
                    were tedious and intricate. One claimant ſhowed the order of the court, iſſued a
                    century or two back, to his an·· "ceſtor for the marching of his men, aâ a proof
                    that the right was then in his family. His opponent proved; that his anceſtors
                    had been the real lords of the marches; but that, on account of their
                    negligence, the court had iſſued an <hi rend="italic">emmansy ukaſe</hi> to
                    the other, only at that particular period. The emperor ordered all the family
                    archives to be brought to Moſcow; and all documents όή both ſides to be
                    collected. A time was ſet for the examination; a fine wooden court-houſe was
                    built ; every paper was lodged under a good guard ; the day was appointed when
                    the court ſhould be opened and the claims heard ; but that morning the houſe,
                    with all its contents, was in two hours conſumed by fire. The emperor then ſaid,
                    “ Gentlemen, henceforward your-ranks, your privileges, and your courts, are the
                    nation’s, and the nation will guard itſelf. Your archives are unfortunately
                    loſt, but thoſe of the nation remain. I am the keeper, and it is my duty to
                    ad-miniſter juſtice ſor all and to all. Your ranks are not private, but national
                    ; attached to the ſervices you are actually performing. Henceforward Colonel
                    Buturlin (a private gentleman) ranks before Captain Viazemſky (an old prince).”</p>
                <p>This conſtitution, which eſtabliſhed the different ranks of Ruſſia as they
                    remain to this day, is by Voltaire aſcribed to Peter :. but it was the work of
                    Alexis ; who, when the ſituation of himſelf and his country is conſidered, muſt
                    be allowed to have been a great and a good man. He died in 1676, and was
                    ſucceeded by his ſon Theodore Alexiovit⅜} who after an excellent reign, during
                    the whole of which he exerted himſelf to the utmoſt for the good of his
                    ſubjects, diedin 1682, having appointed his brother Peter I. commonly called <hi
                        rend="italic"> Peter the Great,</hi> his ſucceſſor. See PetEr I.</p>
                <p>Theodore had another brother named <hi rend="italic">John ;</hi> but as he was
                    ſubject to the fallſhg-ſickneſs, the Czar had preferred Peter, though very
                    young, to the ſucceſſion. But through the intrigues of the princeſs Sophia,
                    fiſter to Theodore, a ſtrong party was formed in favour of John; and ſoon after
                    both John and Peter were proclaimed ſovereigns of Ruſſia under the
                    adminiſtration of Soph⅛ herſelf, who was declared regent. However, this
                    adminiſtration did not continue long; for the princeſs regent having conſpired
                    againſt Peter, and having the misfortune to be diſcovered, was confined for life
                    in a convent. From this time alſo John continued to be only a nominal ſovereign
                    till his death, which happened in 1696, Peter continuing to engroſs all the
                    power.</p>
                <p>It is to this emperor that Ruſſia is univerſally allowed to owe the whole of her
                    preſent greatneſs. The private character of Peter himſelf ſeems to have been but
                    very- indifferent. Though he had been married in his eighteenth year to a young
                    and beautiful princeſs, he was not ſuſſiciently reſtrained by the ſolemn ties of
                    wedlock ; and he was befides fo much addicted to Railing and drunkenneſs, the
                    prevailing vice of his country, that nobody could have imagined him capable of
                    effecting the reformation upon his ſubjects which he actually accompliſhed. In
                    ſpite of all diſad vantages, however.</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r03-0564" facs="gri_33125011196389_0570.tif"/>
                <p>he applied himſelf to the military art and to civil government. He had alſo a
                    very ſingular natural defect, which, had it not been conquered, would have
                    rendered him for ever incapable of accompliſhing what he afterwards did. This
                    was a vehement dread of water ; which is thus accounted for. When he was about
                    five years of age, his mother went with him in a coach, in the ſpring-ſeaſon ;
                    and paſſing over a dam where there was a conſiderable water-fall, whilſt he lay
                    aſleep in her lap, he was ſo ſuddenly awaked and frightened by the ruſhing of
                    the water, that it brought a fever upon him ; and after his recovery he retained
                    ſuch a'dread of that element, that he could not bear to ſee any ſtanding water,
                    much leſs to hear a running ſtream. This averſion, however, he conquered by
                    jumping into water ; and afterwards became very fond of that element.</p>
                <p>Being aſhamed of the ignorance in which he had been brought up, he learned
                    almoſt of himſelf, and without a maſter, enough of the High and Low Dutch
                    languages to ſpeak and write intelligibly in both. He looked upon the Germans
                    and Hollanders as the moſt civilized nations ; becauſe the former had already
                    erected ſome of thoſe arts and manufactures in Moſcow, which he was deſirous of
                    ſpreading throughout his empire ; and the latter excelled in the art of
                    navigation, which he conſidered as more neceſſary than any other. During the
                    adminiſtration of the princeſs Sophia, he had formed a deſign of eſtabliſhing a
                    maritime power in Ruſſia ; which he accompliſhed by the means which we have
                    recorded in his life.</p>
                <p>Having reformed his array, and introduced new diſcipline among them, he led his
                    troops againſt the Turks; ſrom whom, in 1696, he took the fortreſs of Azov, and
                    had the ſatisfaction to ſee his fleet defeat that of the enemy. On his return to
                    Moſcow were ſtruck the firſt medals which had ever appeared in Ruſſia. The
                    legend was, “ Peter the first, <hi rend="italic">the auguβ emperor of Rujfia.”</hi> On the reverſe was Azov, with theſe words, <hi rend="italic">ViSorious by
                        fire and water.</hi> Notwithſtanding this ſucceſs, however, Peter , was
                    very much chagrined at having his ſhips all built by foreigners ; having beſides
                    as great an inclination to have an harbour on the Baltic as on the Euxine Sea.
                    Theſe conſiderations determined him to ſend ſome of the young nobility oſ his
                    empire into foreign countries, where they might improve. In 1697 he ſent 69
                    young Ruffians into Italy ; moſt of them to Venice, and the reſt to Leghorn, in
                    order to learn the method of conſtructing their galleys. Forty more were ſent
                    out by his direction for Holland, with an intent to inſtruct themſelves in the
                    art of building and working large ſhips : others were appointed for Germany, to
                    ſerve in the land-forces, and to learn the military diſcipline of that nation.
                    At laſt he reſolved to travel through different countries in perſon, that he
                    might have the opportunity of profiting by his own obſervation and experience.
                    Of this journey we have given a ſhort account elſewhere ; and ſhall here only
                    add, that in executing his great deſign, he lived and worked like a common
                    carpenter. He laboured hard at the forges, rope-yards, and at the ſeveral mills
                    for the ſawing of timber, manufacturing of paper, wiredrawing, &amp;c. In
                    acquiring the art of a carpenter, he began -with purchaſing a boat, to which he
                    made a maſt himſelf, and by degree« he executed every part of the conſtruction
                    of a ſhip·</p>
                <p>Beſides this, Peter frequently went ſrom Sweden to Amſterdam, where he attended
                    the lectures of the celebrated Ruyſeh on anatomy. He alſo attended the lectures
                    of burgomaſter Witſen on natural philoſophy. From this place he went for a few
                    days to Utrecht, in order to pay a viſit to King William III. of England ; and
                    on his return ſent to Archangel a 60 gun ſhip, in the building of which he had
                    aſſiſted with his own hands. In 1698 he went over to England, where he employed
                    himſelf in the ſame manner as he had done in Holland. Here he perfected himſelf
                    in the art of ſhip-building ; and having engaged a great number of artificers,
                    he returned with them to Holland ; from whence he ſet out for Vienna, where he
                    paid a viſit to the emperor; and was θn the point of ſetting out for Venice to
                    finiſh his- improvements, when he was informed of a rebellion having broken out
                    in his dominions. This was occaſioned by the ſuperſtition and obſtinacy of the
                    Ruffians, who having an almoſt invincible attachment to thçir old ignorance and
                    barbariſm, had reſolved to dethrone the Czar on account of his innovations. But
                    Peter arriving unexpectedly at Moſcow, quickly put an end to their machinations,
                    and took a moſt ſevere revenge on thoſe who had been guilty. Having then made
                    great reformations in every part of his empire, in 1700 he entered into a league
                    with the kings of Denmark and Poland againſt Charles XII. of Sweden. The
                    particulars of this famous war are related under the article Sweden. Here we
                    ſhall only obſerve, that, from the conclufion of this war, Sweden ceaſed not
                    only to be a formidable enemy to Ruſſia, but even loſt its political conſequence
                    in a great meaſure altogether.</p>
                <p>Peter applied himſelf to the cultivation of commerce, arts, and ſciences, with
                    equal aſſiduity as to the pursuits of war ; and he made ſuch acquiſitions of
                    dominion even in Europe itſelf, that he may be ſaid, at the time of his death,
                    to have been the moſt powerful prince of his age. He was unfortunate in the
                    Czarovitz his eldeſt ſon, whom he contrived to get rid oſ by the forms of
                    juſtice (ſee Peter I. note b),' and then ordered his wife Catharine to be
                    crowned with the ſame magnificent ceremonies as if ſhe had been a Greek
                    em-preſs, and to be recogniſed as his ſucceſſor ; which ſhe accordingly was, and
                    mounted the Ruſſian throne upon the deceaſe of her huſhand. She died, after a
                    glorious reign, in 1727, and was ſucceeded by Peter II. a minor, ſon toi the
                    Czarovitz. Many domeſtſe revolutions happened in Ruſſia during the ſhort reign
                    of this prince; but none was more remarkable than the diſgrace and exile of
                    Prince Menzikoff, the favourite general in the two late reigns, and eſteemed the
                    richeſt ſubject in Europe. Peter died of the ſmall-pox in 1730.</p>
                <p>Notwithſtanding the deſpotiſm of Peter the Great and his wife, the Ruſſian
                    ſenate and nobility, upon the death of Peter II. ventured to ſet aſide the order
                    of ſucceſſion which they had eſtabliſhed. The male iſſue of Peter was now
                    extinguiſhed ; and the duke of Hol-ſtein, ſon to his eldeſt daughter, was by the
                    deſtination of the late empreſs intitled to the crown : but the Ruffians, for
                    political reaſons, filled their throne with Anne ducheſs of Courland, ſecond
                    daughter to John, Peter’s eldeſt brother ; though her elder fitter the ducheſs
                    of Mecklenburgh was alive. Her reign was extremely prυfperous : and though ſhe
                    accepted of the crown u»&lt;</p>

                <p>der limitations that ſeme thought derogatory to her dignity, yet ſhe broke them
                    all, aſſerted the prerogative of her anceſtors, and puniſhed the aſpiring
                    Dolgo∏ιcki family, who had impoſed upon her limitations, v-ith a view, as it is
                    ſaid, that they themſelves might govern. She raiſed her favourite Biron to the
                    duchy of Cour-land ; and was obliged to give way to many ſevere executions on
                    his account. Upon her death in 1740, John, the ſon of her niece the princeſs of
                    Mecklenburgh, by Antony Ulric of Brunſwiq Wolfenbuttel, was, by her will,
                    intitled to the ſucdeffion : but being no more than two years old, Biron was
                    appointed to he adminiſtrator of the empire during h⅛ nonage. This deſtination
                    was diſagreeable to the prir⅛eefs of Mecklenburgh and her huſhand, and unpopulaf <hi rend="sup">s</hi> samong the- Ruffians. . Count Munich was employed
                    b⅜the princeſs of Mecklenburgh to arreſt Biron ; who was tried, and condemned to
                    die, but was ſent in exile to Siberia.</p>
                <p>The adminiſtration of the princeſs Anne of Mecklenburgh and her huſhand was,
                    upon many accounts, but particularly that of her German connections,
                    diſagreeable not only to the Ruffians, but to other powers of Europe ; and
                    notwithſtanding a proſperous war they carried on with the Swedes, the princeſs
                    Elizabeth, daughter by Catharine to Peter the Great, formed ſuch a party, that
                    in one night’s time ſhe was declared and proclaimed empreſs of the Ruffias ; and
                    the princeſs ot Mecklenburgh, her huſhand, and ſon, were made priſoners.</p>
                <p>Elizabeth’s reign may be ſaid to have been more glo-'rious than that of any of
                    her predeceffors, her father excepted. She aboliſhed capital puniſhments, and
                    introduced into all civil and military proceedings a moderation till her time
                    unknown in Ruffia : but at the ſame time ſhe puniſhed the counts Munich and
                    Oſter-man, who had the chief management of affairs during the late
                    adminiſtration, wiſh exile. She made peace with Sweden ; and ſettled the
                    ſucceffion to that crown, as well as to her own dominions, upon ſhe moſt
                    equitable foundation. Having glorioufly finiſhed a war, which had been ſtirred
                    up againſt her with Sweden, ſhe replaced the natural order of ſucceffion in her
                    own family, by declaring the duke of Holſtein-Gottorp, who was deſcended from
                    her elder fiſter, to be her heir. She gave him the title of grand duke of Ruffia
                    ; and ſoon after her acceffion to the throne, ſhe called him to her court ;
                    where he renounced the ſucceffion to the crown of Sweden, which undoubtedly
                    belonged to him, embraced the Greek religion, and married a princeſs of
                    Anhalt-Zerbſt, by whom he had a ſon, who is now heir to the Ruffian empire.</p>
                <p>Few princes have had a more uninterrupted career of glory than Elizabeth. She
                    was completely victorious over the Swedes. Her alliance was courted by Great
                    Britain at the expence of a large ſubfidy ; but many political, and ſome private
                    reaſons, it is ſaid, determined her to take part with the houſe of Auſtria
                    againft ſhe king of Pruffia in 1 756. Her arms alone gave a turn to the ſucceſs
                    of the war, which was in disfavour of Pruffia, notwithftanding that monarch’s
                    amazing abilities both in the field and cabinet. Her conqueſts were ſuch as
                    portended the entire deſtruction of the Pruffian power, which was perhaps ſaved
                    only by her critical death on January 5. 1762.</p>
                <p>Elizabeth was Succeeded by Peter UI. grand prince</p>
                <p>of Ruffia and duke of Holſtein ; a prince whoſe conduct has been variouſly
                    repreſented. He mounted the throne poffeffed of an enthufiaſtic admiration of
                    his Pruffian majeſty’s virtues ; to whom he gave peace, and whoſe principles and
                    practices he ſeems to have adopted as the directories of his future reign. He
                    might have ſurmounted the effects even of thoſe peculiarities, un-popular as
                    they then were in Ruffia ; but it is ſaid, that he aimed at reformations in his
                    dominions, which even Peter the Great durſt not attempt ; and that he even
                    ventured to cut off the beards of his clergy. He was certainly a weak man, who
                    had no opinions of his own, but childiſhly adopted the ſentiments of any perſon
                    who took the trouble to teach him. His chief amuſement was buffoonery ; and he
                    would fit for hours looking with pleaſure at a merry-andrew fi∏g-ing drunken and
                    vulgar ſongs. He was a ſtranger to the country, its inhabitants, and their
                    manners ; and ſuffered himſelf to be perſuaded by thoſe about him, that the
                    Ruffians were fools and beafts unworthy of his attention, except to make them,
                    by meanε of the Pruffian diſeipline, good fighting machines. Theſe ſentiments
                    regulated his whole conduct, and prepared the way for that revolution which
                    improprieties of a different kind tended to haften.</p>
                <p>Becoming attached to one of the Vorontzoff ladies, fiſter to the princeſs
                    Daſhkoff, he diſguſted his wife, who was then a lovely .woman in the prime of
                    life, of great natural talents and great acquired accompliſhments ; whilſt the
                    lady whom he preferred to her was but one degree above an idiot. The princeſs
                    Daſhkoff, who was married to a man whoſe genius was not ſupe-rior to that of the
                    emperor, being <hi rend="italic">dame d <hi rend="sup">,</hi> honneur</hi> and lady of the bedchamber, had of courſe much of the empreſs’s company.
                    Similarity of ſituations knit theſe two illuſtrious perſonages in the cloſeſt
                    friendſhip. The princeſs being a zealous admirer of the French <hi rend="italic"
                        > œconomistes</hi> , could make her converſation both amufing
                    andinſtructive. She retailed all her ſtatiſtical knowledge ; and finding the
                    empreſs a willing hearer, ſhe ſpoke of her in every company as a prodigy of
                    knowledge, judgment, and philanthropy. Whilſt the emperor, by his buffoonery and
                    attachment to foreign manners, was daily incurring more and more the odium of
                    his ſubjects, the popularity of his wife was rapidly in-creaſmg ; and ſome
                    peiſons about the court expreffed their regret, that ſo much knowledge of
                    government, ſuch love of humanity, and ſuch ardent wiſhes for the proſperity of
                    Ruffia, ſhould only furniſh converſations with Catharina Romanovna<note

                            Princess Dashkoff.</hi></note>. The empreſs and her favourite did not
                    let theſe expreffions paſs unobſerved: they continued their ſtudies in concert ;
                    and whilſt the former was employed on her famous code of laws for a great
                    empire, the latter always reported progreſs, till the middling circles of Moſcow
                    and St Peterſhurgh began to ſpeak familiarly of the bleffings which they might
                    enjoy if theſe {peculations could be realized.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile Peter III. was giving freſh cauſe of discontent.. He. had recalled
                    from Siberia count Munich, who was indeed a ſenſible, brave, and worthy man ;
                    hut as he. was ſmarting under the effects of Ruffian defpotifm, and had grounds
                    of reſentment againft moſt of the great families, he did not much diſcourage the
                    emperor’s unpopular conduct, but only tried to moderate it and give it a ſyſtem.
                    Peter, however, was impatient.</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r03-0566" facs="gri_33125011196389_0572.tif"/>
                <p>He publicly ridiculed the exerciſe and evolutions of the Ruffian troops ; and
                    haſtily adopting the Pruſſian diſcipline, without digeſting and fitting it for
                    the conſtitution of his own forces, he completely ruined himſelf by diſguſting
                    the army.</p>
                <p>What he loſt was ſoon and eaſily gained by the emiſſaries of Catharine. Four
                    regiments of guards, amounting to 8ooo men, were inſtantly brought over by the
                    three brothers Orloff, who had contrived to ingratiate themſelves with their
                    officers. The people at large were in a ſtate of indifference, out of which they
                    were rouſed by the following means. A little manuſcript was handed about,
                    containing principles of legiſlation for Ruſſia, founded on natural rights, and
                    on the claims of the different claſſes of people which had inſenfibly been
                    formed, and become ſo familiar as to appear natural. In that performance was
                    propoſed a convention of deputies ſrom all the claſſes, and from every part of
                    the empire, to converſe, but without authority, on the ſubjects of which it
                    treated, and to inform the ſenate of the reſult of their deliberations. It
                    paſſed for the work of her majeſty and was much admired.</p>
                <p>While Catharine was thus high in the public eſteem and affection, the emperor
                    took the alarm at her popularity, and in a few days came to the reſolution of
                    confining her for life, and then of marrying his favourite. The ſervants of that
                    favourite betrayed her to her filter, who imparted the intelligence to the
                    empreſs. Catherine ſaw her danger, and inſtantly formed her reſolution. She muſt
                    either tamely ſubmit to perpetual impriſonment, and perhaps a cruel and
                    ignominious death, or contrive to hurl her huſhand from his throne. No other
                    alternative was left her ; and the conſequence was what undoubtedly was
                    expected. The proper ſteps were taken ; folly fell before abilities and addreſs,
                    and in three days the revolution was accompliſhed.</p>
                <p>When the emperor ſaw that all was loſt, he attempted to enter Cronſtadt ſrom
                    Oranienbaum, a town on the gulph of Finland, 39 verſts, or near 26 miles from
                    Peterſburgh. The ſentinels at the harbour preſented their muſkets at the barge ;
                    and though they were not loaded, and the men had no cartridges, he drew back.
                    The Engliſh ſailors called from ſhip to ſhip for ſome perſon to head them,
                    declaring that they would take him in and defend him ; but he precipitately
                    withdrew. Munich received him again at Oranienbaum, and exhorted him to mount
                    his horſe and head his guards, ſwearing to live and die with him. He ſaid, “ No
                    : I ſee it cannot be done without ſhedding much of the blood of my brave
                    Holſteinians. I am not worthy of the ſacrifice.” The revolution was ſettled, and
                    Catharine declared <hi rend="italic">autocratrix.</hi> The crown was ſaid to
                    be preſſed upon her, and her ſon was proclaimed <hi rend="italic">her</hi> heir, and <hi rend="italic">as</hi> <hi rend="italic">ſuch</hi> great duke of all the Ruſſias.</p>
                <p>She behaved with magnanimity and moderation ; retained Munich; even pardoned
                    counteſs Vorontzoſſ the emperor’s favourite ; and afterwards, on her marriage
                    with Mr Raulotſky, made a handſome· ſettlement on them. She allowed the
                    expectations of golden days and a philoſophical government to become the ſubject
                    of faſhionable conversation ; and the princeſs Daſhkoff <note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial" n="3">This lady, during the progreſs of the
                        revolution, certainly acted either from the moſt difintereſted patriotiſm or
                        the moſt generous friendſhip. She might have taken part with the emperor,
                        and directed the counſels of the empire ; for her ſiſter, on whom he doated,
                        acknowledged her ſuperiority, and wanted nothing but pleaſure. Between them
                        they could eaſily have governed ſuch a man as Peter III. but Catharine
                        Romanovna was a theoretical enthufiaſt, who loved the empreſs becauſe ſhe
                        thought her a philoſopher and philanthropiſt ; and perhaps ſhe might
                        entertain hopes of directing the conduct of Catharine II. as ſhe had

                    The convention of deputies was even reſolved on; and as they were not to be
                    elected by the people, except here and there for the ſhow, Prince Galitzin and
                    Count Panin, whom ſhe had completely gained over, and who had the greateſt
                    abilities of any Ruſſians about court, were at immenſe pains in appointing a
                    proper ſet. In the mean time, a great number of ſhowy patriotic projects were
                    begun. A grave Engliſh clergyman was invited over to ſuperintend the inſtitution
                    of ſchools for civil and moral education; and the empreſs was moſt liberal in
                    her appointments. This inſtitution failed, however, to produce the effects
                    expected from it. The clergyman appointed, though a moſt excellent character and
                    real philan-thropiſt, had views too contracted for the ſphere in which he was
                    placed ; and Mr Betſkoy, the Ruffian <hi rend="italic">Mecaenas,</hi> to whom
                    the empreſs referred him for inſtructions, preferred déclamation, and
                    ſtage-playing, and ballets, to all other accompliſhments.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, elegance of all kinds was introduced before the people were
                    taught the principles of morals. The nobles were ſent a travelling ; and as the
                    Ruſſians more eaſily acquire foreign languages than the people of moſt other
                    nations, have great vivacity without flippancy, and in general underſtand play,
                    theſe travellers were everywhere well received, eſpecially at Paris, where
                    reaſons of ſtate contributed not a little to procure to them that attention with
                    which they were treated. They were raviſhed with the manners of foreign courts,
                    and imported faſhions and fineries without bounds. The ſovereign turned all this
                    to her own account, by encouraging a diſſipation which rendered court favours
                    neceſſary, and made the people about her forget their Utopian dreams.</p>
                <p>The convention of deputies at laſt aſſembled in the capital. The empreſs’s book

                    informed that carriages and guards were ready for Siberia. There was a grand
                    proceſſion at their preſentation. Each had the honour of kiſſing her majeſty’s
                    hand and receiving a gold medal. They met in form to recogniſe one an-</p>

                <p>ether,, then parted, and have never met ſince. . The thing melted away without
                    notice ; and the Princeſs Daſhkoſſ was handſomely given to underſtand, that
                    her-counſeh were no longer neceſſary, and that ſhe could not do better than take
                    the amuſements ol the tour of Europe. She was liberally ſupplied, and has ever
                    ſince been treated with great kindneſs, but kept amuſed with ſomething very
                    different from legillation.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, many patriotic things were really done. Taxes were frequently
                    remitted where they were burthenſome. Every perſon was declared free who had
                    ſerved government without pay for two years. No man was allowed to ſend boors
                    from -his cultivated •eſtates to his mines in Siberia, nor to any diſtant
                    eſtates, but for the purpoſes of agriculture. Many colonies of German peaſants
                    were in various places ſet-tled on the -crown-lands, to teach the natives the
                    management of the dairy ; a branch of rural economy of which the Ruffians were
                    till that period ſo completely ignorant, that there is not in their language an
                    appropriated word for <hi rend="italic">butter,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">cheeſe,</hi> or even lor <hi rend="italic">cream.</hi></p>
                <p>The Ruffians hoped to be likewiſe inſtructed in agriculture ; but the coloniſts
                    were poor and ignorant ; and this part of the project came to nothing, like the
                    great national ſchools. Other improvements however took place in favour of
                    commerce ; for all barriers were removed, and goods ſuffered to paſs through the
                    empire duty-free. The empreſs with great liberality encouraged the introduction
                    of arts and manufactures. An academy was inſtituted of ſculptur/·, painting, and
                    architecture, &amp;c. a magnificent and elegant building was erected for it,
                    and mauy élevés ſupported in it at the expence of the erawn. Several very
                    promiſing youths have been educated in that academy ; but as the Ruffians are
                    childiſhly fond of finery, and cannot be perſuaded that any thing fine was ever
                    done by their own countrymen, the ſtudents are all, on leaving the academy,
                    ſuffered to ſtarve.</p>
                <p>The empreſs, who has a very juſt taſte in architecture, has herſelf deſigned
                    ſeveral buildings equally uſeful and ornamental to her capital (ſee Neva and
                    Pete rsburgh) ; and while ſhe has thus diligently cultivated the arts of peace,
                    ſhe has not neglected thole of war. She put her fleets on the moſt reſpectable
                    footing, and procured a number of Britiſh officers to inſtruct her ſeamen in the
                    ſcience oſ naval tactics. By land, her .ſucceſſes againſt the Turks, the Swedes,
                    and the Poles (ſee Turkey, Sweden, and Poland), .compel us to believe, that her
                    troops are better diſci-plined, 3∏d her generals more fl&lt;ilful, than any
                    whom the greateſt of her predeceſſors could bring into the ■field ; and perhaps
                    it is not too much to ſay, that the empire of Ruſſia, though the people are but
                    juſt emer-.ging from a ſtate of barbariſm, is at thia day the moſt powerful in
                    Europe.</p>
                <p>Ruſſia is divided into two great parts by a range of mountains called <hi
                        rend="italic"> Ourat,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">Pelt,</hi> which,
                    through the whole breadth of it, form one continual uninterrupted barrier,
                    dividing Siberia from the remaining Ruſſia.—-That part of Ruſſia which lies on
                    this fide oſ the Oural mountains preſents a very extenſive plain verging
                    weſtward by an eaſy deſcent. The vaſt extent of this plain has a great variety
                    of different climates, foils, and products. The aoκthern past of it is very
                    woody,</p>
                <p>marſhy, and but little fit for cultivation, and has a ſenſible dediyity towards
                    the White and the Frozen Seas. The other part of this vaſt plain includes the
                    whole extent along the river Volga as far as the deſerts, extending by the
                    Caſpian and the Azov Seas, and conſtitutea the fineſt part of Ruſſia, which in
                    general is very rich, and fruitful, having more arable and meadow laud than
                    wood, marſhes, or barren deſerts.</p>
                <p>The part lying on the other ſide of the Oural moun« tains, known by the name of
                    Siberia, is a flat tract of land of conſiderable extent, declining imperceptibly
                    towards the Glacial Sea, and equally by imperceptible degrees riling towards the
                    ſouth, where at laſt it forms a great range of mountains, conſtituting the
                    borders of Ruſſia on the ſide of Chuta. Between the rivers Irtiſh, Obè, and the
                    Altay mountains, there is a very extenſive plain, known by'the name of <hi

                    but the ſouthern part, on-the contrary, is a deſert full of ſands and marſhes,
                    and very unfit for cultivation. Between the rivers Obe and Eniſſey there is more
                    woodland than open ground ; and the other ſide of the Eniſſey is entirely
                    covered with-impervious woods, as far as the lake Baical ; but the ſoil is
                    fruitful everywhere ; and wherever the trouble has been taken of clearingit of
                    the wood, and of draining it ſrom unneceffary water, it proves to be very rich,
                    and fit for cultivation ; and the country beyond the Baical is ſurrounded by
                    ridges of highſtony mountains. Proceeding on farther towards the eaſt, the
                    climate of Siberia becomes by degrees more and more ſevere, the ſummer grows
                    ſhorter, the winter longer, and the froſts prove more intenſe.</p>
                <p>With reſpect to the variety of climates, as well as the produce of the earth,
                    Ruſſia naturally may be divided into three regions or diviſions, viz. into the
                    north· ern, middle, and ſouthern diviſions.</p>
                <p>I'heſe were about <hi rend="italic">20</hi> years ago ſubdivided into
                    different governments, for the better adminiſtration of iu* ſtice.</p>
                <p>The northern diviſion, beginning from the 57th degree oſ latitude, extends to
                    the end of the Ruſſian dominions on the north, and includes the governments of
                    St Peterſhurgh, Riga, Revel, Vyborg, Pſcov, Novogorod* Tver, Oloneti, Archangel,
                    Vologda, Yaroſlavl, Koſtro-ma, Viatka, Ferme, and fobolſk. The middle diviſion
                    is reckoned from the 57th to the 50th degree of latitude, and includes the
                    governments of Moſcow» Smolenſk, Polotfl&lt;, Moghilev, Tchernigov,
                    Novogorod-Bieverſkoy, Kharkov, Voronez, Kourſk, Orel, Kalou&lt; ga, Toola,
                    Riazane, Vladimir, Niznei-Novogorod, Tambov, Saratov, Penza, Sinbiiſk, Kazane,
                    Oufa, Kolhivane, and Irkoutſk. The ſouthern diviſion begins at the 50th degree
                    of latitude, and extends to the end of Ruſſia on the ſouth, including the
                    governments of Kiev, Ekatherinoſlav, Caucafus∙, and the province of Taurida. To
                    this may be added the habitations of the Coffack6 of the Don.</p>
                <p>The northern diviſion, though deficient in grain, fruit, and garden vegetables,
                    has the preference before the other two in the abundance of animals, rare and
                    valuable for their ſkins j in ſiſhes of particular forts, very uſeful for
                    different purpoſes of life ; in cattle, and metals of inferior kinds,
                    &amp;c. The middle diviſion of Ruſſia abounds in different kinds of grain,
                    hemp, flax <hi rend="sub">ff</hi></p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r03-0568" facs="gri_33125011196389_0574.tif"/>
                <p>cattle, ſiſh, bees, timber proper for every uſe, different kinds of wild beafts,
                    metals, both of ſuperior as well as of inferior kind, different precious ſtones,
                    &amp;c. This divifion is likewiſe moſt convenient for the habitation of
                    mankind, on account of the temperature arid pleaſant-neſs of the air. The ſouth
                    divifion has not that abundance of grain, but has the preference in different
                    delicate kinds of fruit, quantity of fiſh, cattle, and wild animals, amongſt
                    which there are ſeveral ſpecies different from thoſe which are found in the
                    middle divifion. It exceeds greatly both the other divifιons in plants and roots
                    fit for dying and for medical purpoſes, as well as for the table ; neither is it
                    deprived of precious ſtones, as well as different metals.</p>
                <p>The products of thoſe three diviſions conftitute the permanent and inexhauſtible
                    riches of Ruffia ; for, befides what is neceffary ſor home conſumption, there is
                    a great quantity of thoſe products exported yearly into foreign countries to the
                    amount of ſeveral millions of rubles. Theſe productions are brought from
                    different places to fairs, eſtabliſhed in different parts of Ruffia, where the
                    merchants buy them up, and forward them to different port6, and other trading
                    towns, for exportation into foreign kingdoms. Theſe fairs are likewiſe the
                    places where a conſiderable quantity of goods imported from foreign kingdoms is
                    diſpoſed of. The principal yarmankas, that iβ, fairs, are the yarmanka
                    Makarievikaya, Korennaya, and lrbitſkaya.</p>
                <p>The external commerce of Ruſlia may be divided into two different branches; iff,
                    The commerce with the European nations, which is carried on by buying and
                    felling goods either for ready money or upon credit. 2d, The commerce with the
                    Afiatic nations, which is conducted by barter or exchange of goods.</p>
                <p>The principal ports belonging to the firſt part of Ruffia are, on the Baltic
                    ſea, -St Peterſhurgh, Riga, Vyborg, Revel, Narva, Frederickſham, and the Baltic
                    port ; Archangel on the White ſea, and Kola on the Northern Ocean ; Taganrog on
                    the ſea of Azov ; Kher-ſon, Sevaſtopole, Balaklava, Soudak,Theodofιa, Kerche,
                    and Phanagoria on the Black ſea, befides others of ſmaller note. In theſe ports
                    commerce iβ carried on, as well as in ſeveral trading towns ſituated on the
                    Rentiers of Poland, Sweden, and Turkey.</p>
                <p>The products of Ruffia exported into the different European kingdoms conſiſt
                    chiefly in hemp, flax, different kinds of grain, tallow, hides, fail-cloth,
                    iron, timber, linſeed, butter, hemp-oil, train-oil, wax, potaſhes, tar, tobacco,
                    briſtles, linens, peltry, and other goods, the greateſt part of which is
                    exported chiefly by way of St Peterſhurgh, Riga, and Archangel ; and in return
                    from the European kingdoms they receive woollen cloths, different kinds of goods
                    made of worlled, filk, cotton, and thread ; wines and beer, white and moiſt
                    ſugars, filks, cotton unwrought, and yarn ; French brandy, liquors, aιrack,
                    ſhrub, different iron tools, and toys ; gold and ſilver in bars, in foreign
                    money, and in other things ; brilliants, pearls, galanterie goods, coffee,
                    colours ; peltry, viz. beaver and otter fkins ; herrings, ſtock-fiſh, ſalt,
                    tobacco, different trees, oil, horſes, china and earthen ware, <hi rend="italic"
                        > Sec.</hi> The greateſt part of theſe goods is imported through the ports
                    of St Peterſhurgh and Riga, but a conſiderable quantity is likewiſe admitted by
                    land through different frontier cuſtom-houſee.</p>
                <p>The principal goods exported into Afla are partly the products of Ruffia, and
                    partly imported from other European kingdoms, and conſiſt of peltry and hides.
                    The other goods are woollen cloths, bays, borax, bottles, printed linens, iron,
                    and different kinds of ironware, calamanco«, kerſeys, glue, ifinglaſs,

                    ſtriped linen, ticking, pallock, craſh, &amp;c. From the Afiatic kingdoms
                    they import different filk goods, raw filk, cotton, filk-wove ſtuffs, gold and
                    ſilver in bars and in coin, cattle, horſes, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The mountains within Ruffia, as well as thoſe on its frontiers, abound with
                    minerals of various kinds. Gold, filver, quickfilver, copper, lead, iron-ore,
                    very powerful loadſtones, mountain-cryftal, amethyſt, topazes of different
                    forts, agates, cornelian, beryl, chalcedony, onyx, porphyry, antimony, pyrites,
                    aquamarines, cliryſolites, ophites, and lapis lazuli, hre found in them, befides
                    marble, granite, trappe, maria or Muſcovy glaſs, of remarkable fize and
                    clearneſs, baſaltes, and coal, &amp;c. ; and in every part of Siberia, but
                    particularly in the plains of it, are found bones of animals uncommonly large,
                    mammoth’s teeth (ſee Mammoth), and other foſſils.</p>
                <p>In the Ruffian empire are many lakes of very large extent, ι. The Ladoga,
                    anciently called <hi rend="italic">Nevo,</hi> is the latgeſt lake in Europe,
                    extending in length r75 and in breadth 105 verſts ; or it is 116 Engliſh miles
                    long and near 70 broad. It lies between the governments of St Peterſhurgh,
                    Olonetz, and Vyborg ; and communicates with the Baltic ſea by the river Neva,
                    with the Onega lake by the river Svir, and with the Ilmen lake by the river
                    Volkov. Several conſiderable rivers fall into it, as the Paſha, Sias, Oyat, and
                    others. The Ladoga canal is made near this lake. 2. The Onega lake is ſituated
                    in the government of Olonetz. Tt it above 200 verſts long, and the greateſt
                    width of it does not exceed 80 verſts. 3. The Tchude lake, or Peipus, lies
                    between the governments of St Peterſhurgh, Pſcov, Revel, and Riga. It is near 80
                    verſts' long and 60 broad. It joins to the lake of Pſcov by a large neck of
                    water. The length of this lake is 50 and the width about 40 verſts. The river
                    Velikaya flows into it. The river Narova comes out of the lake Peipus, which by
                    the river Embakha communicates with the lake Wirtz-Erve, and from this latter
                    flows the river Fellin, and runs into the bay of Riga. 4. The Ilmen lake,
                    anciently called <hi rend="italic">Mοljk,</hi> lies in the -government of
                    Novogorod. Its length is 40 and width 30 verſts. The rivers Mſta, .Lovate,
                    Shelone, and others, fall into it ; and only one liver, Volkov, runs out of it,
                    by which it is joined with the Ladoga lake. 5. The Bielυ-Ozero, that is, the
                    White Lake, lies in the government of Novogorod. It extends $0 verſts in length,
                    and -about 30 in width. There are many ſmall rivers which run into it ; but only
                    one river, Shekſna, comes out of it, and falls into the river Volga. 6. The
                    Altin, or Altay lake, otherwiſe called the <hi rend="italic">Tel-tſk Lake,</hi> is fituated in the government of Kolhivane. It extends in length 126 and
                    in width about 84 verſts. The river Biya comes out of it, which being joined to
                    the river Katounya, conftitute the river Obc. 7. The Baical Lake, otherwiſe
                    called the <hi rend="italic">Bal-cal Sea,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Holy
                        Sea,</hi> lies in the government of Irk-outſk. Its extent in length is 600,
                    and in width from</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r03-0569" facs="gri_33125011196389_0575.tif"/>
                <p>JO to 50 verſts, and in the wideſt places as far as 70 verſts. 8. The Tchani
                    Lake lies in the deſerts of Ba-raba, between the rivers Obè and lrtiſh. It joins
                    with a great many ſmaller lakes, occupies a vaſt tract of land, and abounds very
                    much in ſiſh. 9. Between the Gulf of Finland and the White Sea there are ſeveral
                    lakes which extend from 50 to 70 verſts in length ; and befides theſe there are
                    many other ſalt lakes in different parts of Ruſſia, ſuch as the Ozero, that is,
                    the lake El-tonſkoye, Bogdo, Inderſkoye, Ebele, Koryakovſkoye, Yamiſhevſkoye,
                    Borovye, and others ; and the fait which is got from them ſerves for the uſe of
                    the greateſt part of the empire. To theſe may be added the Caſpian, which,
                    though called a ſea, is more properly a lake, as it has no communication with
                    the ocean either viſible or ſubterraneous. See <hi rend="italic">CASPiAN-Sea,</hi> and Pneumatics, n <hi rend="sup">0</hi> 277.</p>
                <p>Ruſſia boaſts likewiſe of a conſiderable number of large and famous rivers. Of
                    the Dvina or Dwina, the Neva, Dnieper or Nieper, the Don, the Volga, the Trtis,
                    the Onega, the Oby, and the Lena, the reader of this work will find ſome account
                    under their reſpective names ; but in this vaſt empire there are many other
                    rivers worthy of notice, tho’ not perhaps of ſuch minute deſcription. Among
                    theſe the <hi rend="italic">Bong,</hi> or, as it is ſometimes written, <hi
                        rend="italic"> Bog,</hi> riſes in Poland ; then directing its courſe to the
                    ſouth-eaſt, it divides the government of Ecatherinoſlav from the deſerts of
                    Otchakov, now belonging to Ruſſia, and falle into the Liman, which communicates
                    with the Black ſea.</p>
                <p>The Kubane conſiſts of many ſprings or rivulets running out of the Caucaſian
                    mountains, and divides itſelf into two branches, the one of which falls into the
                    Azov Sea, and the other into the Black ſea. This river, from its ſource to the
                    end of it, conſtitutes the frontier of Ruſſia.</p>
                <p>The Oural, formerly Yaik, takes its riſe in the Oural mountains, in the
                    government of Oufa, which it divides from that of Caucaſus, and extends its
                    courſe about 3000 verſts. It receives many rivers, the principal of which are
                    the Or, Sakmara, Yleck, and Terkool.— The Kouma riſes in the Caucaſian
                    mountains, and runs through the plains between Terek and Volga, and at laſt
                    lofes itſelf in the ſands, before it comes to the Caſpian ſea. The Terek
                    originates in the Caucaſian mountains, runs between them, and then coming out,
                    extends its courſe to the Caſpian Sea, and receives ſeveral rivers, as the
                    Malka, Soonja, Bakſan, and Ack-ſay.</p>
                <p>The Bolſhaya Petchora, that is, the great Petchora, riſes in the Oural
                    mountains, in the government of Vologda, runs acroſs the whole breadth of the
                    government of Archangel, and falls into the Icy ſea. It receives in its courſe
                    ſeveral rivers, the principal of which are the Outcha and the Elma. The Eniſſey
                    is formed by the junction of two rivers, the Oulookema and the Baykema, which
                    riſe in the Altay mountains in Mun-galia. It runs through the whole extent of
                    Siberia, and falls into the Icy Sea. The extent of the Eniſſey is about 2500
                    verſts. It receives in its courſe ſeveral rivers, the principal of which are the
                    Abakan, Elogooy, Podkamennaya Tungouſka, Niznyaya Tungouſka, and Tourookhan. The
                    Yana, the Indighirka, and the Kolhima, are likewiſe no inconſiderable rivers in
                    the government of Iikoutſk. The ſirſt riſes in the mountains which overſhadow
                    the banks of the river Lena on the right hand, and extends its courſe 800
                    verſts. The two laſt take their ſources in the mountains which extend on the
                    coaſts of the Eaſtern ſea. The length of the In-dighirka is 1200 and that of
                    Kolhima 1500 verſts.— The laſt, near its mouth, is divided into two branches,
                    and receives the rivers Omolon and Onooy. The Anadir is the eaſternmoſt of all
                    the rivers in Siberia. It- riſes out of the lake Ioanko, in the diſtrict of
                    Okhotſk, and runs through the eaſtern part of it, and then falls into the
                    Eaſtern ocean The Amour is formed by the junction of two conſiderable rivers,
                    the Shilka and Argoonya, which are joined juſt by the frontiers of China. It
                    runs through the Chineſe dominions, and at laſt falls into the Eaſtern ocean.
                    The Kamtſchatka runs through the peninſula oi the ſame name, extending its
                    courſe from the Verkhney to Nizney Oſtrog, that is, from the upper to the lower
                    fort, and falls into the Eaſtern ocean. The Penjina riſes in the Yablonnoy ridge
                    of mountains, and falls into the Penjinſkaya Gooba, that is, the gulf or the ſea
                    of Penjina.</p>
                <p>In ſuch a vaſt extent of country, ſtretching from the temperate ſo far into the
                    frigid zone, the climate muſt vary conſiderably in different places. In the
                    ſouthern parts of the Ruffian empire, the longeſt day does not exceed fifteen
                    hours and a half ; whereas in the moſt northern, the ſun in ſummer is ſeen two
                    months above the horizon. The country in general, though lying under different
                    climates, is exceſſively cold in the winter. Towards the north, the country is
                    covered near three quarters of the year with ſnow and ice ; and by the ſeverity
                    of the cold many unfortunate perſons are maimed, or periſh. This fort of weather
                    commonly ſets in about the latter end of Auguſt, and continues till the month of
                    May ; in which interval the rivers arc frozen to the depth of four or five feet.
                    Water thrown up into the air will fall down in icicles ; birds are frozen in
                    their flight, and travellers in their ſledges. In ſome provinces the heats of
                    ſummer are as ſcorching as the winter colds are rigorous.</p>
                <p>The ſoil of Muſcovy varies ſtill more than the climate, according to the
                    influence of the ſun and the ſituation of the country. In the warmer provinces,
                    the proceſs of vegetation is ſo rapid, that corn is commonly reaped in two
                    months after it begins to appear above the ſurface of the ground. Hence the
                    great variety of muſhrooms produced ſpontaneouſly in Ruſſia, which may be
                    conſidered as a comfortable relief to the poor, while they appear as delicacies
                    at the tables of the rich. Above 1000 waggon-loads of them uſed to be fold
                    annually in Moſcow. Perhaps it is on account of the ſcar-city of proviſions that
                    ſuch a number of faſts are inſti-tuted in the Muſcovite religion.</p>
                <p>Beſide^ tire productions already mentioned as peculiar to each of the three
                    great natural diviſions of the empire, Muſcovy yields rhubarb, flax, hemp,
                    paſture for cattle, wax, and honey. Among other vegetables, we find in Ruſſia a
                    particular kind of rice called <hi rend="italic">[ſyntha,</hi> plenty of
                    excellent melons, and in the neighbourhood of Aſtracan the famous zoophyton, or
                    animal plant, which the Mulcovites call <hi rend="italic">bonnaret,</hi> or
                    lambkin, from its reſemblance to a larnb. See the article <hi rend="italic">Scythian LAMB.</hi></p>
                <p>Agriculture in general is but little underſtood, and leſs proſecuted in this
                    country. The moſt conſiderable articles in the oeconomy of a Ruffian farm are
                    wax and</p>

                <p>honey, by which the peaſant is oſten enriched. He cuts down a great number of
                    trees in the foreſt, and ſawing the trunks into a number of parts, bores each of
                    theſe, and ſtops up the hollow at both~eπds, leaving only a little hole for the
                    admittance of the bees ; thus the honey is ſecured from all the attempts of the
                    bear, who is extremely fond of it, and tries many different experiments for
                    making himſelf maſter of the luſcious treaſure.— Of this honey the Ruffians make
                    a great quantity of ſtrong metheglin for their ordinary drink. They likewiſe
                    extract from rye a ſpirit, which they prefer to brandy.</p>
                <p>The wild beaſts in the northern part of Ruſſia are the ſame with thoſe we have
                    mentioned in the articles of Norway and Lapland : ſuch as rein-deer, bears,
                    foxes, ermins, martens, fables, hares, and ſquirrels In the more ſouthern
                    provinces the Muſcovites breed black cattle, ſmall but hardy horſes, ſheep,
                    goats, and camels. The breed of cattle and horſes has been enlarged by the care
                    and under the protection of Peter and ſuc-eeeding fovereigns. The whole empire
                    abounds with wild-fowl and game of all forts, and a variety of birds of prey ;
                    beſides the different kinds of poultry, which are raiſed in this as well as in
                    other countries. The external parts and provinces of Muſcovy are well ſupplied
                    with’ſea-fiſh from the Northern ocean, the Baltic, or gulph of Finland, the
                    White ſea, the Black ſea, and the Caſpian ; but the whole empire is plentifully
                    provided with freſh-water fiſh ſrom the numerous lakes and rivers, yielding
                    immenſe quantities of ſalinon, trout, pike, ſturgeon, and belluga : the laſt
                    being a large fiſh, of whoſe roe the beſt caviare is made. Innumerable infects,
                    like thoſe of Lapland, are hatched by the ſummer’s heat in the fand, moraſſes,
                    and foreſts, with which this empire abounds ; and are ſo troubleſome as to
                    render great part of the country altogether uninhabitable.</p>
                <p>The Ruſſian empire is inhabited by no leſs than 16 different nations, of which
                    our limits will hardly permit us to give the names. The firſt are the Sclavonic
                    nations, comprehending the Ruffians, who are the predo∙ minant inhabitants of
                    the whole empire, and the Poles, who beſides occupying the countries lately
                    wreſted from the republic, lire in the governments of Polatſk and Moghilev, as
                    well as in the diſtrict of Salcnghinlk and along the river Irtiſh. 2. The
                    Germanic nations,, comprehending the Germans properly ſo called, who inhabit
                    Eſthonia and Livonia ; the Swedes inhabiting the Ruſſian Finland, as well as
                    ſome of the iſlands on the Baltic ſea ; and the Danes, who inhabit the iſlands
                    of the Baltic ſea, the Worms, and Groſs or Great Roge. 3. The Lettonian or
                    Livonian nations, under which are claſſed the original or real Lettonians or
                    Letiſhr, inhabiting Livonia ; and the Lithuanians, who live in the government of
                    Polatſk and Moghilev. 4. The Finns, or Tchudi, nations who inhabit the
                    governments of Viberg and St Peterſhurgh,. with many other diſtricts of the
                    empire, being branched out into no fewer than 12 different tribes. 5. The
                    Tartarian nations, who are all either Mahometans or idolaters. The Mahometan
                    Tartars, commonly called by the Ruffians <hi rend="italic">Tartars,</hi> dwell
                    in Kazane, and the places adjacent; at Keſimov; at Ouſe, in the government of
                    Parma ; at Tomſk and its neighbourhood, and are in general a ſober,
                    induſtri-ous, cleanly, and generous people. The other Tartars inhabit different
                    parts of Siberia, and arc intermixed with ſtill different races, called after
                    the towns, rivers, and other places to which their habitations are neareſt.—
                    They are, as we have ſaid, idolaters, and governed by ſhamens. (See Shλmen.)
                    Beſides theſe, there are in the Ruſſian dominions the Nagay Tartars ; the
                    Crim-Tartars, inhabiting the Crimea, who, together with the land belonging to
                    them, came under the ſubjection oſ Ruſſia in 1783; the Meſclieraki; the Baſhkirs
                    ; the Kirghiſtzi or Kirghisſkaifaks ; theYakouti; and the white Kalmuks. 6. The
                    Caucaſian nations, which are ſix in number, and are each ſubdivided into many <hi rend="sup">r</hi> different tribes, of which it is probable that few
                    of our readers have ever heard the names, except of the Circaſe fians, who live
                    in different ſettlements bordering on the river Kubane. 7. The Samoyeds or
                    Samoeds, comprehending the Oſtiacks<note anchored="true" place="margin"
                        type="authorial">See <hi rend="italic">Oſtiacks</hi></note>. Theſe inhabit
                    the northern-moſt part of Ruſſia, along the coaſt of the Icy ſea.— 8. The
                    Mungalian nations, comprehending the original Muπgals, who are chiefly diſperſed
                    in the deſerts of Gobey ; the Bourati, who live on the banks of the Baikal, and
                    other places in the government of Irkoutſk ; and the Kalmuks, conſiſting of four
                    different tribes.— All theſe hordes ſpeak the Mungalian language, obſerve the
                    religion of Lama and the Kalmuks live in large tents. 9. The Tongooſi, a very
                    populous tribe, diſe perſed from the river Eniffey as far as the ſea of Okhotſk,
                    and from the Penjinſkaya Gooba beyond the Chineſe frontier. They are all
                    idolaters, and live by hunting and fiſhing. 10. The Kamtchadels. xι. The
                    Koriaki. 12. The Kouriltzi. Of theſe three nations we have given ſome account
                    under the article Kamtschatka. 13. The Aleouti, who dwell in the iſlands between
                    Siberia and America, and very much reſemble the Eſquimaux and the inhabitants of
                    Greenland.— They live in large huts, and ſeem to be idolaters.— 14. The Ariπtzi,
                    a very numerous people ſcattered in the government oſ Kolhivane. 15. The
                    Yukaghiri, Who are diſperſed on the coaſts of the Glacial ſea, about the rivers
                    Vana, Kolhima, and Lena, and as far as the ſource of the Anadir. 16. The
                    Tchouktchi, who occupy the north-eaſtern part of Siberia, between the rivers
                    Kolhima and Anadir. Beſides theſe ſixteen different nations, there are ſcattered
                    through the Ruffian empire vaſt numbers of Buckharian Tartars, Perfians,
                    Georgians, Indians, Greeks, Servians, Albanians, Bulgarians, Moldavians,
                    Valekians, Armenians, and Jews.</p>
                <p>The empire of Ruſſia is ſo widely extended, that notwithſtanding the number of
                    nations which it comprehends, it muſt be conſidered as by no means populous. At
                    the laſt reviſion it was found to contain 26. millions, of ſouls ; but it is to
                    be obſerved, that the nobility, clergy, land as well as ſea forces, different
                    officers, ſervants belonging to the court, perſons employed under government in
                    civil and other offices ; the ſtudents of different univerſities, academies,
                    ſeminaries, and other ſchools ; hoſpitals of different denominations ; likewiſe
                    all the irregular troops, the roving hordes of different tribes, foreigners and
                    coloniſts, or ſettlers oſ different nations— are not included in the
                    above-mentioned number : but with the addition of all theſe, the population of
                    Ruſſia, of both ſexes, may be ſuppoſed to come near to 28 millions-</p>

                <p>To ſuch a vaſt variety of people, nations, and languages, it is needleſs to
                    obſerve, that no general character can with truth be applied. The native
                    Ruffians are ſtigmatiſed by their neighbours as ignorant and brutal, totally
                    refigned to ſloth, and addicted to drunkenneſs, even in the moſt beaſtly exceſs
                    ; nay, they are accuſed of being arbitrary, perfidious, inhuman, and deſtitute
                    of every ſocial virtue. There is not a phraſe in their language analogous to
                    ours, “ the manners or the ſentiments of a gentleman nor does <hi rend="italic">gentleman</hi> with them expreſs any thing moral. Indeed they have no ſuch
                    diſtinction. Cunning is <hi rend="italic">proſeſſed and gloried in</hi> by all
                    ; and the nobleman whom you detect telling a lie is vexed, but not in the leaſt
                    aſhamed. In the whole <hi rend="italic">reglement</hi> of the marine by Peter
                    the Great, there is not one word addreffed to the honour, or even to the
                    probity, oſ his officers. Hopes of reward, and the conſtant fear of detection
                    and puniſhment, are the only motives touched on. In every ſhip of war, and in
                    every regiment, there is a fiſcal or authorized ſpy, a man of re-ſpectable rank,
                    whoſe letters muſt not be opened but at the riſk of the great knout (ſee Knout)
                    ; and he is required by expreſs ſtatute to give monthly reports of the behaviour
                    of the officers and privates.</p>
                <p>Such regulations we cannot think well adapted to improve the morals of the
                    people ; yet we believe they have been improved by the care, aſſiduity, and
                    example of ſome of their late ſovereigns. Certain it is, the vice of drunkenneſs
                    was ſo univerſally prevalent among them, that Peter I. was obliged to reſtrain
                    it by very ſevere edicts, which, however, have not produced much effect. They
                    numbered in the city of Moſcow no fewer than 4000 brandy-ſhops, in which the
                    inhabitants uſed to ſot away their time in drinking ſtrong liquors and ſmoking
                    tobacco. This laſt practice became ſo dangerous, among perſons in the moſt
                    beaſtly ſtate of intoxication, that a very ſevere law was found neceffary to
                    prevent the pernicious conſequences, otherwiſe the whole city might have been
                    conſumed by conflagrations. The nobility were heretofore very powerful, each
                    commanding a great number of vaffals, whom they ruled with the moſt deſpotic and
                    barbarous authority: but their poffeſſions have been gradually circ∏m-ſcribed,
                    and their power transferred in a great meaſure to the czar, on whom they are now
                    wholly dependent. At preſent there is no other degree of the nobility but that
                    of the boyars : theſe are admitted to the council, and from among them the
                    waivodes, governors, and other great officers, are nominated, and their ranks
                    with reſpect to each other are regulated by the importance of their refpective
                    offices.</p>
                <p>Alexis, who introduced this order of precedency, abhorred the perſonal abaſement
                    of the inferior claffes to their ſuperiors, which he would not accept of when
                    exhibited to himſelf ; and it may appear ſurprifing that Peter, who deſpiſed
                    mere ceremonials, ſhould have encouraged every extravagance of this kind. In a
                    few years of his reign, the beautiful ſimplicity of defignation and addreſs
                    which his father had encouraged was forgotten, and the cumberſome and almoſt
                    ineffable titles which diſgrace the little courts of Germany were crowded into
                    the language of Ruſſia. He enjoined the loweſt order of gentlemen to be
                    addreffed by the phraſe, year <hi rend="italic">reſpeCiable birth</hi> ; the
                    next rank, by <hi rend="italic">your high good birth ;</hi> the third, <hi
                        rend="italic"> your excellence ;</hi> the fourth, <hi rend="italic">your
                        high excellence ;</hi> then came <hi rend="italic">your brilliancy</hi> and <hi rend="italic">high brilliancy. Highneſs</hi> and <hi rend="italic">majejly</hi> were reſerved for the great duke and the czar.</p>
                <p>Tlieſe titles and modes of addreſs w <hi rend="sup">r</hi> ere ordered with
                    all the regularity of the manual exerciſe ; and the man who ſhould omit any of
                    them when ſpeaking to his fn-perior might be lawfully beaten by the offended
                    boyar. Before this period, it was polite and courtly to ſpeak to every man, even
                    the heir apparent, by adding his father’s name to his own ; and to the great
                    duke, Paul Petrovιtz was perfectly reſpectful, or a fingle word, ſignifying <hi
                        rend="italic"> dear father,</hi> when he was not named. Tho <hi rend="sup"
                        > ,</hi> pompous titles w <hi rend="sup">,</hi> ere unknown among them
                    before the era of Peter, the ſubordination of ranks was more complete than in
                    any other European nation ; but with this ſimplicity peculiar to them and the
                    Poles, that they had but three ranks, the ſovereign, the nobleſſe or gentry, and
                    the ſerfs. It was not till very lately that the mercantile rank formed any
                    diſtinction ; and that diſtinction is no more than the freedom of the perfon,
                    which was fυιmerly a transferable commodity belonging to the boyar.
                    Notwſithſtanding this ſimplicity, which put all gentlemen on a level, the
                    ſubſcription of a perſon holding an inferior office was not <hi rend="italic">ſervant,</hi> but <hi rend="italic">ßave;</hi> and the legal word for a
                    petition in form was <hi rend="italic">lchelobitii,</hi> which fιp <hi
                        rend="sup"> -</hi> nifies, “ a beatinπ <hi rend="sup">r</hi> with the
                    forehead,” <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> ſtri-king the ground with the forehead;
                    which was actually done. The father of Alexis aboliſhed the practice ; but at
                    this day, when a Ruffian petitions you, he touches his forehead witlι his finger
                    ; and if he be very earneſt, he then puts his finger to the ground.</p>
                <p>The Ruffian nobles formerly wore long beards, anſt long robes with ſtrait
                    ileeves dangling down to their ancles : their collars and ſhirts w <hi
                        rend="sup"> r</hi> ere generally wrought with filk of different colours :
                    in lieu of hats, they covered their heads w <hi rend="sup">,</hi> ith furred
                    caps ; and, inſtead oſ ſlioes, wore red or yellow leathern bufkins. The dreſs of
                    the women nearly reſembled that of the other ſex ; with this difference, that
                    their garments were more looſe, their caps fantaſtical, and their ſhift-ileeves
                    three or four ells in length, gathered up in folds from the ſhoulder to the

                <p>The common people, are generally tall, healthy, and robuſt, patient of cold and
                    hunger, inured to hard-ſhips, and remarkably capable of bearing the moſt bidden
                    traufition from the extremes of hot or cold weather. Nothing is more cuſtomary
                    than to ſee a Ruffian, who is over-heated and ſweating at every pore, ſtrip
                    himſelf naked, and plunge into a river ; nay, when their pores are all opened in
                    the hot bath, to which they have daily recourſe, they either practiſe this
                    immersion, or ſubject themſelves to a diſcharge of ſome pailfuls of cold water.
                    This is the cuſtom of both men and women, who ef⅛ter the baths promiſcuouily,
                    and appear naked to each other, without ſcruple or hefιtation.</p>
                <p>A Ruffian will ſubſiſt for many days upon a little oatmeal and water, and even
                    raw roots : an onion is a regale ; but the food they generally uſe in their
                    journeys is a kind of rye-bread, cut into ſmall ſquare pieces, and dried again
                    in the oven : theſe, when they are hungry, they foak in water, and eat as a very

                <p>fortabîe repaſt. Both ſexes are remarkably healthy and robuſt, and accuſtom
                    themſelves to ſleep every day after dinner.</p>
                <p>The Ruffian women are remarkably fair, comely, ſtrong, and well-ſhaped, obedient
                    to their lordly huſ-bands, and patient under diſcipline : they are even ſaid to
                    be fond of correction, which they conſider as an infallible mark of their
                    huſhand’s conjugal affection ; and they pout and pine iſ it be with-held, as if
                    they thought themſelves treated with contempt and diſregard. Of this neglect,
                    however, they have very little cauſe to complain ; the Ruffian huſhand being
                    very well diſpoſed, by nature and inebriation, to exert his arbitrary power.
                    Some writers obſerve, that, on the wedding-day, the bride preſents the
                    bridegroom with a whip of her own making, in token of ſubmiſſion ; and this he
                    fails not to employ as the inſtrument of his authority. Very little ceremony is
                    here uſed in match-making, which is the work of the parents. Perhaps the
                    bridegroom never ſees the woman till he is joined to her for life. The marriage
                    being propoſed and agreed to, the lady is examined, ſtark· naked, by a certain
                    number of her female relations ; and if they find any bodily defect, they
                    endeavour to cure it by their own ſkill and experience. '1 he bride, on her
                    wedding-day, is crowned with a garland of wormwood, implying the bitterneſs that
                    often attends the married ſtate. When the prieſt has tied the nuptial knot at
                    the altar, his clerk or ſexton throws upon her head a handful of hops, wiſhing
                    that ſhe may prove as fruitful as the plant thus ſeattered. She is muffled up,
                    and led home by a certain number of old women, the pariſh-prieſt carrying the
                    croſs before; while one of his ſubalterns, in a rough goat-ſkin, prays all the
                    way that ſhe may bear as many children as there are hairs on his garment. The
                    new-married couple, being ſeated at table, are preſented with bread and ſalt ;
                    and a chorus of boys and girls ling the epithalamium, which is always groſsly
                    obſcene. This ceremony being performed, the bride and bridegroom are conducted
                    to their own chamber by an old woman, who exhorts the wife to obey her huſhand,
                    and retires. 1 hen the bridegroom deſires the lady to pull off one of his
                    bu-ikins, giving her to underſtand, that in one of them is contained a whip, and
                    in the other a jewel or a purſe of money. She takes her choice ; and if ſhe
                    finds the purſe, interprets it into a good omen ; whereas ſhould ſhe light on
                    the whip, ſhe conſtrues it into an unhappy preſage, and inſtantly receives a
                    laſh as a ſpecimen of what ſhe has to expect. After they have remained two hours
                    together, they are interrupted by a deputation of old women, who come to ſearch
                    for the ſigns of her virginity : if theſe are apparent, the young lady ties up
                    her hair, which before conſumma-tion hung looſe over her ſhoulders, and viſits
                    her mother, of whom ſhe demands the marriage portion. It is generally agreed,
                    that the Muſcovite huſhands are barbarous even to a proverb ; they not only
                    adminiſter frequent and ſevere correction to their wives, but ſometimes even
                    torture them to death, without being ſubject to any puniſhment for the murder.</p>
                <p>The canon law of Muſcovy forbids the conjugal commerce on Mondays, Wedneſdays,
                    and Fridays ; and whoever tranſgreſſes this law, muſt bathe himſelf before he
                    enters the church-porch. He that marries a ſecond wife, the firſt being alive,
                    is not admitted farther than the church-door ; and if any man eſpouſes a third,
                    he is excommunicated : ſo that though bigamy is tolerated, they nevertheleſs
                    count it infamous, iſ a woman is barren, the huſhand generally perſuades her to
                    retire into a convent : if fair means wfill not ſucceed, he is at liberty to
                    whip her into condeſcenſion. When the czar, or emperor, has an inclination for a
                    wife, the moſt beautiful maidens of the empire are preſented to him for his
                    choice.</p>
                <p>The education of the czarovitz, or prince royal, is intruſted to the care of a
                    few perſons, by whom he is ſtrictly kept from the eyes of the vulgar, until he
                    hath attained the 15th year of his age : then he is publicly expoſed in the
                    market-place, that the people, by viewing him attentively, ⅛nay remember his
                    perſon, in order to aſcertain his identity ; for they have more than once been
                    deceived by impoſtors.</p>
                <p>Such is the ſlavery in which the Muſcovites oſboth ſexes are kept by their
                    parents, their patrons, and the emperor, that they are not allowed to diſpute
                    any match that may be provided for them by theſe directors, however diſagreeable
                    or odious it may be. Officers of the greateſt rank in the army, both natives and
                    foreigners, have been ſaddled with wives by the ſovereign in this arbitrary
                    manner. A great general ſome time ago deceaſed, who was a native oſ Britain,
                    having been preſſed by the late czarina to v/ed one of her ladies, ſaved himſelf
                    from a very diſagreeable marriage, by pretending his conſtitution was ſo
                    unſound, that the lady would be irreparably injured by his compliance.</p>
                <p>In Ruſſia, the authority of parents over their children is almoſt as great as it
                    was among the ancient Romans, and is often excrciſed with equal ſeverity. Should
                    a father, in puniſhing his ſon for a fault, be the immediate cauſe of his death,
                    he could not be called to account' for his conduct ; he would have done nothing
                    but what the law authorized himto do. Nor does this legal tyranny ceaſe with the
                    minority of children ; it continues while they remain in their father’s family,
                    and is often exerted in the moſt indecent manner. It is not uncommon, even in St
                    Peterſhurgh, to ſee a lady of the higheſt rank, and in all the pomp and pride of
                    youthful beauty, ſtanding in the court-yard with her back bare, expoſed to the
                    whip of her father’s ſervants. And ſo little diſgrace is attached to this
                    puniſhment, that the ſame lady will fit down at table with her father and his
                    gutſts immediately after ſhe has ſuſſered her flogging, provided its ſeverity
                    has not confined her to bed.</p>
                <p>The Muſcovites are fond of the bagpipe, and have a kind of violin, with a large
                    belly like that of a lute : but their muſic is very barbarous and defective.
                    Nevertheleſs, there are public ſchools, in which the children are regularly
                    taught to fing. The very beggars aſk alms in a whining cadence, and ridiculous
                    fort of recitative. A Ruffian ambaſſador at the Hague, having been regaled with
                    the beſt concert of vocal and inſtrumental muſic that could be procured, was
                    aſked how he liked the entertainment ? he replied, “ Perfectly well : the
                    beggars in my country ſing juſt in. the fame manner.” The warlike muſic of the
                    Ruſſians conſiſt! in kettle-drums and trumpets : they likewiſe uſe hunt ing
                    horns ; but they are not at all expert in the per</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r03-0573" facs="gri_33125011196389_0579.tif"/>
                <p>formance. It has been ſaid, that the Ruffians think it beneath them to dance,
                    and that they call in their Poliſh or Tartarian ſlaves to divert them with this
                    exer-ciſe in their hours of diſſipation. Such may have been the caſe formerly,
                    or may be ſo now, in the diſtant and moſt barbarous provinces oſ the empire ;
                    but at St Peterſhurgh dancing is at preſent much reliſhed, and a minuet is
                    nowhere ſo gracefully performed in Europe as by the faſhionable people in that
                    metropolis.</p>
                <p>We have elſewhere obſerved, that the Ruſſian language is a dialect of the
                    Sclavonic, and the pureſt perhaps that is now anywhere to be found (ſee
                    Philology, Sect. ix. § 3.) ; but they have nothing ancient written in it, except
                    a tranſlation of Chryſoſtom’s Offices for Eaſter, which are at this day good
                    Ruſſian, and intelligible to every boor, though certainly not leſs than 800
                    years old. There is no Ruſſian poetry which there is reaſon to believe 200 years
                    old ; and the oldeſt tranſlation of the Scriptures into that language is but a
                    late thing, and come to them from Koningſ-berg. Science has made but a very
                    ſmall progreſs among them ; and the reputation of the imperial academy at St
                    Peterſhurgh has been hitherto ſupported by the exertions ot foreigners. For
                    antiquarian reſearch they have as little reliſh as for ſcientiſic inveſtigation.
                    Every thing, to pleaſe, muſt be new ; and the only elucidations which we have of
                    their antiquities are the performances of Germans and other foreigners, ſuch as
                    profeſſors Bayer, Muller, and Gmelin. One native has indeed ſhown ſome deſire to
                    recover and preſerve what he can of their moſt ancient poetry ; but in his
                    reſearches, he ſeems more indebted to an exquiſitely nice ear than to any
                    erudition. Erudition indeed they hold in the moſt ſovereign contempt. No
                    gentleman is ever taught Latin or Greek ; and were a Ruſſian ſtranger in company
                    to give any hint of his poſſeſſing ſuch knowledge, every man with a, ſword would
                    draw away his chair, and let him down for a charity-boy. Peter the Great and the
                    preſent empreſs have done what ſovereigns could do to diſpel theſe clouds of
                    ignorance, by inſtituting ſchools and colleges, and giving the maſters and
                    profeſſors military rank ; but all in vain. One oſ the moſt accompliſhed
                    ſeſholars of the age, after having made himſelf extremely agreeable to a company
                    of ladies, by means of his taſte in muſic, and a ſword at his ſide, was
                    inſtantly deſerted by them upon ſome perſon’s whiſpering through the room that
                    he was a man of learning ; and before his fair companions would be reconciled to
                    him, he was obliged to pretend that he was a lieutenant colonel, totally
                    illiterate.</p>
                <p>The two ſirſt ſentences of Prince Shtcherbatoff’s dedication of his Hiſtory of
                    Ruſſia, which was printed in three volumes 4 <hi rend="sup">to</hi> , in 1770,
                    afford an admirable ſpecimen of Ruſſian literature. “ The hiſtory of the human
                    underſtanding (ſays this dedicator) aſſures us,that everywhere the ſciences have
                    followed the progreſs of the proſperity and the ſtrength of kingdoms. When the
                    Grecian arms had overthrown, the greateſt monarchy then in the world, when they
                    had the famous generals Miltiades, Themiſtocles, Ariſtides, Conon, and
                    Alcibiades, at the ſame time flouriſhed among them Anaximander, Anaxagoras,
                    Archytas, Socrates, and Plato. And when Auguſtus had conquered the world, and
                    had ſhut the gates of the temple of Janus,and the proud Romans, under his happy
                    government, cheerfully obeyed his commands, then did Titus Livius, Thucydides,
                    Virgil,and Horace, adorn his court, and celebrate his glory.”—A paſſage ſo
                    replete as this with blunders and anachroniſms it would ſurely be difficult to
                    find in any other author.</p>
                <p>The Ruffians were converted to the Chriſtian religion towards the latter end of
                    the tenth century, as has been already related. Since that period they have
                    conſeſſed the articles of the Greek church, mingled with certain ſuperſtitious
                    ceremonies of their own. They do not believe in the pope’s infallibility or
                    ſupremacy, or even hold communion with the ſee of Rome : they uſe auricular
                    conſeſſion, communicate in both kinds, adopt the Athanaſian creed, and adhere to
                    the eſtabliſhed liturgy of St Baſil. They worſhip the Virgin Mary, and other
                    ſaints ; and pay their adorations to croſſes and relics. They obſerve four great
                    faſts in the year, during which they neither taſte fiſh, fleſh, nor any animal
                    production : they will not drink after a man who has eaten fleſh, nor uſe a
                    knife that has cut meat in leſs than 24 hours aſter it has been uſed; nor will
                    they, even though their health is at ſtake, touch any thing in which hartſhorn
                    or any animal ſubſtance has been infuſed. While this kind of Lent continues,
                    they ſubſiſt upon cabbage, cucumbers, and rye-bread, drinking nothing ſtronger
                    than a fort of ſmall beer called <hi rend="italic">quaffi</hi>

                    Their common penance is to abſtain from every ſpecies of food and drink, but
                    bread, iβlt, cucumbers, and water. They are ordered to bend their bodies, and
                    continue in that painful poſture, and between whiles to ſtrike their head
                    againſt an image.</p>
                <p>The Muſcovites at all times reject as impure; hotſe-fleſh, elk, veal, hare,
                    rabbit, aſs’s milk, mare’s milk, and Venice-treacle, becauſe the fleſh of vipers
                    is an ingredient ; alſo every thing that contains even the ſmalleſt quantity of
                    muſk, civet, and caſtor : yet they have no averſion to ſwine’s fleſh ; on the
                    contrary, the country produces excellent bacon. They celebrate 15 grand
                    feſtivals in the year. On Palm-ſunday there is a magnificent proceſſion, at
                    which the czar aſſiſts in perſon and on foot. He is apparelled in cloth of gold
                    ; his train is borne up by the prime ot the nobility, and he is attended by his
                    whole court. He is immediately preceded by the officers of his houſehold, one of
                    whom carries his handkerchief on his arm, lying upon another of the richeſt
                    embroidery. He halts at a fort of platform of free-ſtone, where, turning to the
                    eaſt, and bending his body almoſt double, he pronounces a ſhort prayer : then he
                    proceeds to the church of Jeruſalem, where he renews his devotion. This exerciſe
                    being performed, he returns to his palace, the bridle of the patriarch’s horſe
                    reſting upon his arm. The ho lie’s head being covered with white linen, is held
                    by ſome nobleman ; while the patriarch, fitting ſide wiſe, and holding a croſs

                    while the proceſſion halts ; and after the ceremony, the patriarch preſents a
                    purſe of ιoo rubles to the czar, who perhaps invites him to dine at his table.
                    During the ſeaſon of Eaſter, the whole empire is filled with mirth and rejoicing
                    : which, however, never fails to degenerate into heat and debauchery ; even the
                    ladies may indulge themſelves with ſtrong liquors to intoxication wfithout
                    ſcandal. When a lady ſends to inquire concerning the health of her gueſts whom
                    ſhe entertained over-night, the uſual reply is, “ I thank your miſtreſs for her
                    good cheer : by my troth, I was ſo merry that I don’t remember how I got home.”</p>
                <p>During theſe carnivals, a great number of people, in reeling home drunk, fall
                    down and periſh among the fnow. It is even dangerous to relieve a perſon thus
                    overtaken ; for, ſhould he die, the perſon who endeavoured to aſſiſt him is
                    called before the judge, and generally pays dear for his charity.</p>
                <p>The Muſcovite priel⅛ uſe exorciſms at the adminiſtration of baptiſm. They plunge
                    the child three times ever head and ears in water, and give it the ſacrament of
                    the Lord’s Supper in one ſpecies, until it hath attained the age of ſeven; after
                    which the child is indulged with it in both kinds. They likewiſe adminiſter the
                    ſacrament to dying perſons, together with extreme unction ; and if this be
                    neglected, the body is denied Chriſtian burial. Soon as the perſon expires, the
                    body is depoli-ted in a coffin, with a lunehion of bread, a pair of ſhoes, ſome
                    few pieces of money, and a certificate ſigned by the pariſh-prieſt, and directed
                    to St Nicholas, who is one of their great patrons. They likewiſe hold St Andrew
                    in great veneration, and ridſeulouſly pretend they were converted by him to
                    Chriſtianity. But next to St Nicholas, they adore St Anthony of Padua, who is
                    ſuppoſed to have ſailed upon a mill-ſtone through the Mediterranean and
                    Atlantic, and over the lakes Ladoga and Onega, as far as Novogorod. Every houſe
                    is furniſhed with an image of St Nicholas, carved in the moſt rude and fantaſtic
                    manner ; and when it becomes old and worm-eaten, the owner either throws it into
                    the river with a few pieces of coin, faying, “ Adieu, brother or returns it to
                    the maker, who accommodates him with a new image for a proper conſideration. The
                    good women are very careful in adorning their private St Nicholaſes with rich
                    clothes and jewels ; but on any emergency, theſe are relumed, and the faint left
                    as naked as he came from the hand of the carpenter.</p>
                <p>There are monalteries in Ruſſia ; but neither the monks nor the nuns are ſubject
                    to ſevere reſtrictions. The friare are either horſe-jockeys, or trade in hops,
                    wheat, and other commodities ; the ſiſters are at liberty to go abroad when they
                    pleaſe, and indulge themſelves in all manner of freedoms.</p>
                <p>Heretofore liberty of conſcience was denied, and every convicted heretic was
                    committed to the flames ; but ſince the reign of Peter, all religions and ſects
                    are tolerated throughout the empire. Roman Catholics, Lutherans, Calvim’ſts,
                    Armenians, Jews, and Mahometans, enjoy the free exerciſe of their reſpective
                    forms</p>
                <p>of worſhip ; though it was not without great difficulty, and by dint of
                    extraordinary ſolicitation from different powers, that the Romiſh religion was
                    allowed. Peter knowing the dangerous tenets of a religion that might ſet the
                    ſpiritual power of the pope at variance with the temporal power of the emperor,
                    and being well acquainted with the meddling genius of its profeffors, held out
                    for ſome time againſt the interceſſion of Germany, France, and Poland; and
                    though at length he yielded to their joint interpoſition, he would by no means
                    luffer any Jeſuit to enter his dominions.</p>
                <p>The government of Ruſſia is mere deſpotiſm. The whole empire is ruled by the
                    arbitrary will and plea-ι ſure of the ſovereign, who is ſtyled the <hi
                        rend="italic"> evar</hi> or <hi rend="italic">tvcιr,</hi> a title which
                    is probably a corruption of Cæfar. Heretofore he was ſtyled <hi rend="italic">grand duke oſ Muſcovy :</hi> but ſince the reign of Peter, he is dignified
                    with the appellation of <hi rend="italic">emperor oſ Ruſſia ;</hi> and the
                    preſent ſovereign is ſtyled <hi rend="italic">empreſs oſ all the Ruſias.</hi> The emperor is abſolute lord, not only of all the eſtates in the empire, but
                    alſo of the lives of his ſubjects; the greateſt noblemen call themſelves his <hi
                        rend="italic"> flaves,</hi> and execute his commands with the moſt implicit
                    obedience. The common people revere him as ſomething ſupernatural ; they never
                    mention his n⅛nc, or any thing immediately belonging to him, without marks of
                    the moſt profound reſpect and awful veneration. A man aſking a carpenter at work
                    upon one of the czar’s warehouſes, what the place was intended ſor ? anſwered, “
                    None but God and the czar knows.”</p>
                <p>The nobility of Ruſſia were formerly rich and powerful, and ruled deſpoticqjly
                    over their inferiors : but we have ſeen how the father of Peter the Great
                    contrived to ſtrip them of their privileges, and they are now venal dependants
                    on the court. They ſtill retain the titles of their anceſtors, though many of
                    them are in the moſt abject poverty and contempt.</p>
                <p>All the peaſants in the empire are conſidered as immediate ilaves belonging to
                    the czar, to the bσyars, or to the monaſteries. The value of eſtates is
                    computed, not by the extent or quality of the land, but from the number of thoſe
                    peaſants, who may be fold, alienated, or given away, at the pleaſure of their
                    maſters. The number of theſe huſhandmen, whether living in villages or in the
                    open country, being known, the czar, by requiring a certain proportion of each
                    lord or proprietor, can raiſe 3c0,0c0 men in leſs than 40 days.</p>
                <p>The adminiſtration is managed by a grand council, called <hi rend="italic">dumnοy boyaren <hi rend="sub">i</hi></hi> or “ council of the boyars,” who are the grandees of the empire, and act
                    as privy counſellors. To this are ſubſervient ſix inferior chambers and courts
                    of judicature, provided each with a prelident. The firſt regulates every thing
                    relating to ambaſſadors and foreign negociations ; the ſecond takes cognizance
                    of military affairs ; the third manages the public revenues of the empire ; the
                    bufineſs of the fourth is to encourage, protect, and improve trade and commerce.
                    The two laſt hear and determine in all cauſes, whether civil or criminal.</p>
                <p>Peter divided the empire into the eight governments of Moſcow, Archangel, Afoph,
                    Caſan, Aſtracan, Chioff and the Ukraine, Siberia, Livonia, comprehending Ingria,
                    Pleſcow, and Novogorod, Smolenſko, and Ve-ronitz, The governors or waivodes were
                    veſted with power to diſpoſe of all employments civil and military, and receive
                    the revenues. They were directed to</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r03-0575" facs="gri_33125011196389_0581.tif"/>
                <p>defray all expences in their refpective governments, and ſend a certain yearly
                    ſum to the great treaſury. In a word, they enjoyed abſolute power in every thing
                    but what related to the regular troops, which, though quartered in their
                    juriſdiction, were neither paid nor directed by them, but received their orders
                    immediately from the czar or his generals.</p>
                <p>In 1775 the preſent empreſs made a complete new-modelling of the internal
                    government in a form of great ſimplicity and uniformity. By that reglement ſhe
                    divided the whole empire into 43 governments, as we have already mentioned,
                    placing over each, or where they are of leſs extent, over two contiguous
                    governments, a governor-general with very conſiderable powers. She ſubdivided
                    each government into provinces and diſtricts; and for the better adminiſtration
                    of juſtice erected in them various courts of law, civil, criminal, and
                    commercial, analogous to thoſe which are found in other countries. She
                    eſtabliſhed likewiſe in every government, if not in every province, a tribunal
                    of con-fcience, and in every diſtrict a chamber for the protection of orphans.
                    Amidſt ſo many wiſe inſtitutions a chamber for the adminiſtration of her
                    imperial majeſe ſty’s revenues was not forgotten to be eſtabliſhed in each
                    government, nor a tribunal of police in each diſtrict. The duty of the
                    governor-general, who is not properly a judge, but the guardian of the laws, is
                    to take care that the various tribunals in his government diſcharge their
                    refpective duties, to protect the oppreſ-ſed, to enforce the adminiſtration of
                    the laws ; and when any tribunal ſhall appear to have pronounced an irregular
                    ſentence, to ſtop the execution till he make a report to the ſenate and receive
                    her majeſty’s orders : It is his bufineſs likewiſe to ſee that the taxes be
                    regularly paid ; and, on the frontiers of the empire, that the proper number of
                    troops be kept up, and that they be attentive to their duty.</p>
                <p>This reglement contains other inſtitutions, as well as many directions for the
                    conducting of law-ſuits in the different courts, and the adminiſtration of
                    juſtice, which do her majeſty the higheſt honour ; but the general want of
                    morals, and what we call a ſenſe oſ honour, in every order of men through this
                    vaſt empire, muſt make the wiſeſt regulations of little avail. Ruſſia is perhaps
                    the only nation in Europe where the law is not an incorporated proſeſſion. There
                    are no ſemina-ries where a practitioner muſt be educated. Any man who will pay
                    the fees of office may become an attorney, and any man who can find a client
                    may plead at the bar. The judges are not more learned than the pleaders. They
                    are not fitted for their offices by any kind ef education ; nor are they
                    neceſſarily choſen from thoſe who have frequented courts and been· in the
                    practice of pleading. A general, from a ſucceſsſul or an equivocal campaign, may
                    be inſtantly ſet at the head of a court of juſtice ; and in the abſence of the
                    imperial court from St Peterſhurgh, the commanding officer in that city, whoever
                    he may be, prelides <hi rend="italic">ex officio</hi> in the high court of
                    juſtice. The other courts generally change their prefidents every year. Many
                    inconveniences muſt ariſe from this fingular conſtitution ; but fewer,, perhaps,
                    than we are apt to imagine. The appointment to ſo many interior governments
                    makes the Ruffian nobility acquainted with the groſs of the ordinary bιιli-neſs
                    of law-courts ; and a ſtatute or imperial edict is law in every caſe. The great
                    obſtacles to the admi-niſtration of juſtice are the contrariety of the laws and
                    the venality of the judges. From inferior to ſuperior courts there are two
                    appeals ; and in a great proportion of the cauſes the reverlal of the ſentence
                    of the inferior court ſubjects its judges to a heavy fine, unleſs they can
                    produce an edict in full point in ſupport of their decilion. This indeed they
                    ſeldom find any difficulty to do ; for there is hardly a cafe ſo fimple but that
                    edicts may be found clear and preciſe ſor both parties ; and therefore the
                    judges, ſenſible of their ſafety, arc very ſeldom incorruptible. To the
                    principle of honour, which often guides the conduct of judges in other nations,
                    they are ſuch abſolute ſtrangers, that an officer has been ſeen fitting in ſtate
                    and diſtributing juſtice from a bench to which he was chained by an iron collar
                    round his neck, ſor having the day before been detected in conniving at
                    ſmuggling. This man ſeemed not to be aſhamed of the crime, nor did any one
                    avoid, his company in the evening.</p>
                <p>Few crimes are capital in Ruſſia : murder may be atoned by paying a ſum of money
                    ; nay, the civil ma-giitrate takes no cognizance of murder, without having
                    previouſty received information at the fuit of ſome individuals. Criminals were
                    puniſhed with torture and the moſt cruel deaths till the reign of the
                    illuſtrious Catharine I. when a more merciful ſyſtem took place, and which the
                    preſent empreſs has ſince confirmed by lawn See the articles <hi rend="italic"><hi rend="smallcaps">Catharine I.</hi> of Russia,</hi> > and <hi
                        rend="italic"><hi rend="smallcaps">Elizabeth</hi> Petrowna.</hi></p>
                <p>We have already mentioned the traffic of the Ruffians with the different nations
                    both of Aſia and Europe, and ſpecified iron as one of the articles which they
                    export. We may here add, that in 1792 there were in the government oſ Parma
                    alone <hi rend="sub">τ</hi> which lies in the northern divifion of the empire,
                    88- copper and iron works belonging to the government and private perſons, and
                    tlπee gold works. The metals extracted in theſe works are chiefly conveyed to St
                    Peterſburgh by water-carriage on the river Tchuſovaya, w <hi rend="sup">τ</hi> hich falls into the Kama. With reſpect to the revenue of Ruflia, it continually
                    fluctuates, according to the increaſe of commerce or the pleaſure of the czar,
                    who has all the wealth of the empire at his diſpoſal. He monopolizes all the
                    beſt furs, mines, minerals, and the trade by land to the Eaſt Indies ; he farms
                    out all the tobacco, wine, brandy, beer, mead, and other liquors; the inns,
                    taverns, public houſes, bath, and sweating-houſes. The cuſtoms upon merchandize,
                    the impoſts upon corn, and toll exacted from cities, tow <hi rend="sup">r</hi> ns, and villages, are very conſiderable. He poffeffes demeſnes to a very great
                    value ;. inherits the effects of all thoſe that die inteſtate, or under
                    accuſation of capital crimes; derives a duty front all- law-ſuits ; and to ſum
                    up the whole, can command the fortunes of all his subjects. All theſe articles
                    produce a large revenue, which w <hi rend="sup">r</hi> as three years ago
                    eſtimated at upwards of 40,000,000 rubles, or L. 6,333,333 : 6 : 8 Sterling;
                    but then the intrinfic value of money is at leaſt. three, times greater in
                    Ruſſia than in Britain. The expences in time of peace never exceed 38,000,000
                    rubles : the remainder is not treaſeired up, but is employed by her imperial
                    majeſty in eonſtructing public edifices, making harbours, canals, roads, and
                    other uſeful works, for the glory of the empire and the benefit of her ſubjects.</p>
                <p>The Handing army of Ruſſia is computed at <hi rend="italic">250,000</hi> men g
