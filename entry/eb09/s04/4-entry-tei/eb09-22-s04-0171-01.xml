He was born at Chertsey, Surrey, on 24th May 1816, and was educated to follow his father’s profession of a surgeon. Having, in the course of his medical studies, been to the Hôtel Dieu, Paris, his first literary effort was an account of his life there, which appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Mirror.</hi></p><pb xml:id="eb09-22-s04-0172" facs="encyclopediabrit22newyrich_raw_0188.jp2"/><p>From this time he gradually relinquished his medical work for the more congenial occupation of light literature. He was associated with <hi rend="italic">Punch</hi> from its beginning, and was also a regular contributor to <hi rend="italic">Bentley's Miscellany,</hi> in whose pages his first and best book, <hi rend="italic">The Adventures of Mr Ledbury,</hi> first appeared. His other books were <hi rend="italic">A History of Evening Parties, Christopher Tadpole,</hi> issued in monthly parts, <hi rend="italic">Pottleton's Legacy,</hi> and, as a series of so-called natural histories, <hi rend="italic">The Gent, The Ballet Girl, The Idler upon Town,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Flirt.</hi> Albert Smith also wrote extravaganzas and adapted some of Charles Dickens’s stories for the stage. He conducted too for a time a magazine called <hi rend="italic">The Man in the Moon,</hi> which was discontinued in 1849. In 1851 he visited the Alps and ascended Mont Blanc, and the year after produced the descriptive entertainment before referred to. “China,” a similar entertainment, was afterwards produced, but less successfully. Smith married in 1859 a daughter of Keeley, the comedian. He died at Fulham, Middlesex, on 23d May 1860, from an attack of apoplexy.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
