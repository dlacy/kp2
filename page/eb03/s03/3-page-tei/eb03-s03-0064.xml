In all the apartments, without exception, the ceiling is wood, carved and painted. The principal ornaments in ſome were large and valuable looking-glaſſes, hung on different parts of the walls. In others, clocks and watches of different ſizes, in glaſs caſes, were diſpoſed in the ſame manner.</p><p>The ſultana Lalla Batoom and another favourite were indulged with a whole ſquare to themſelves ; but the concubines were only each allowed a single room.</p><p>Each female had a ſeparate daily allowance from the emperor, proportioned to the eſtimation in which they were held by him. The late emperor’s allowance was very trifling : Lalla Douyaw, the favourite ſultana, had very little more than half-a-crown Engliſh a-day, and the others leſs in proportion. It muſt be allowed, that the emperor made them occaſional preſents of money, dreſs, and trinkets ; but this could never be ſufficient to ſupport the number of domeſtics and other expences they muſt incur. Their greateſt dependence therefore was on the preſents they received from thoſe Europeans and Moors who viſited the court, and who employed their influence in obtaining ſome particular favour from the emperor. This was the moſt ſucceſsful mode that could be adopted. When Mr Lempriere was at Morocco, a Jew, desirous of obtaining a very advantageous favour from the emperor, for which he had been a long time unſucceſsfully ſoliciting, ſent to all the principal ladies of the harem preſents of pearls to a very large amount ; the conſequence was, that they all went in a body to the emperor, and immediately obtained the wiſhed-for conceſſion.</p><p>The ladies ſeparately furniſh their own rooms, hire their own domeſtics, and, in fact, do what they pleaſe in the harem, but are not permitted to go out without an expreſs order from the emperor, who very ſeldom grants them that favour, except when they are to be removed from one palace to another. In that caſe, a party of ſoldiers is diſpatched a little diſtance before them, to diſperſe the male paſſengers in particular, and to prevent the poſſibility of their being ſeen. This previous ſtep being taken, a piece of linen cloth is tied round the lower part of the face, and afterwards theſe miſerable females cover themſelves entirely with their haicks, and either mount mules, which they ride like men, or, what is more uſual, are put into a ſquare carriage or litter, conſtructed for this purpoſe, which by its lattice-work allows them to ſee without being ſeen. In this manner they ſet off, under the charge of a guard <hi rend="italic">of</hi> black eunuchs. This journey, and ſometimes a walk within the bounds of the palace, with which they are, however, ſeldom indulged, is the only exerciſe they are permitted to take.</p><p>The late emperor’s harem conſiſted of between 60 and 100 females, beſides their domeſtics and ſlaves, which were very numerous. Many of the concubines were Mooriſh women, who had been preſented to the emperor, as the Moors consider it an honour to have their daughters in the harem ; ſeveral were European ſlaves, who had either been made captives, or purchased by the emperor ; and ſome were Negroes.</p><p>In this group the Europeans, or their deſcendants, had by far the greateſt claim to the character of hand- ſome. There was one in particular, who was a native of Spain, and taken into the harem at about the ſame age as Lalla Douyaw, who was indeed a perfect beauty. Nor was this lady quite lingular in that reſpect, for many others were almoſt equally handſome.</p><p>The eunuchs, who bate the entire charge of the women, and who in fact live always among them, are the children of Negro ſlaves. They are generally either very ſhort and fat, or elſe tall, deformed, and lame. Their voices have that particular tone which is obſervable in youths who are just arriving at manhood ; and their perſons altogether afford a diſguſting image of weakneſs and effeminacy.</p><p>The ſame gentleman gives us a very curious account of the manners and ignorance of theſe immured females, from his own obſervation, when viſiting the prince’s harem. "Attended by an eunuch (ſays he), after paſſing the gate of the harem, which is always locked, and under the care of a guard of eunuchs, we entered a narrow and dark paſſage, which ſoon brought us to the court, into which the womens chambers open. We here ſaw numbers of both black and white women and children ; ſome concubines, ſome ſlaves, and others hired domeſtics.</p><p>“ Upon their obſerving the unuſual figure of an European, the whole multitude in a body ſurrounded me, and expreſſed the utmoſt aſtoniſhment at my dreſs and appearance. Some ſtood motionleſs, with their hands lifted up, their eyes fixed, and their mouths open, in the uſual attitude of wonder and ſurpriſe. Some burst into immoderate fits of laughter ; while others again came up, and with uncommon attention eyed me from head to foot. The parts of my dreſs which ſeemed moſt to attract their notice were my buckles, buttons, and ſtockings ; for neither men nor women in this country wear any thing of the kind. With reſpect to the club of my hair, they ſeemed utterly at a loſs in what view to consider it ; but the powder which I wore they conceived to be employed for the purpoſe of deſtroying vermin. Moſt of the children, when they ſaw me, ran away in the moſt perfect conſternation ; and on the whole, I appeared as lingular an animal, and I dare say had the honour of exciting as much curioſity and attention, as a lion or a man-tiger juſt imported from abroad, and introduced into a country town in England on a market-day. Every time I viſited the harem, I was ſurrounded and laughed at by this curious mob, who, on my entering the gate, followed me cloſe to the very chamber to which I was proceeding, and on my return univerſally eſcorted me out.</p><p>“ The greateſt part of the women were uncommonly fat and unwieldy ; had black and full eyes, round faces, with ſmall noſes. They were of different complexions; ſome very fair, ſome fallow, and others again perfect Negroes.</p><p>“ One of my new patients being ready to receive me, I was desired to walk into her room ; where, to my great ſurpriſe, I ſaw nothing but a curtain drawn quite acroſs the apartment, ſimilar to that of a theatre which ſeparates the ſtage from the audience. A female domeſtic brought a very low ſtool, placed it near the curtain, and told me I was to lit down there, and feel her miſtreſs’s pulse.</p></body></text></TEI>
