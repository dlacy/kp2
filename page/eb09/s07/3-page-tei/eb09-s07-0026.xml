Forty years afterwards an investigation was made by Captain (now Colonel) A. R. Clarke with additional data, which gave new values, both exceeding the former.@@<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> Accepting these as exact, the errors of the first values are <hi rend="italic">da </hi>= -3130 feet and <hi rend="italic">db=</hi> - 1746 feet, the former being 150, the latter 84 millionth parts of the semi-axis. The corresponding changes in arcs of 1° of latitude and longitude, expressed in seconds of arc and in millionth parts (<hi rend="italic">μ</hi>) of arc-length, are as follows :—</p><p>In lat. 5° rf.∆λ= - "Ό69 or 19 g and <hi rend="italic">dΛL=</hi> -"<hi rend="superscript">-</hi>540or 150 g ;</p><p>„	15°	„	-"∙113 ,, 31,,	„	„	-"∙554	,,	154,, ;</p><p>,,	25°	„	-"∙195,,54,,	„	,,	-"∙581	,,	161;</p><p>„	35°	„	-"∙303 „ 84,,	„	„	-"<hi rend="superscript">,</hi>617	„	171 „.</p><p>These assumed errors in the geodetic latitudes and longitudes are of service when comparisons are made between independent astronomical and geodetic determinations at</p><p>any points for which both may be available : they indicate the extent to which differences may be attributable to errors in the adopted geodetic constants, as distinct from errors in the trigonometrical or the astronomical operations.</p><p>17. <hi rend="italic">Final Reduction of Principal Triangulations—</hi>The calculations described so far suffice to make the angles of the several trigonometrical figures consistent <hi rend="italic">inter se,</hi> and to give preliminary values of the lengths and azimuths of the sides and the latitudes and longitudes of the stations. The results are amply sufficient for the requirements of the topographer and land surveyor, and they are published in preliminary charts, which give full numerical details of latitude, longitude, azimuth, and side-length, and of height also, for each portion of the triangulation—secondary as well as principal—as executed year by year. But on the completion of the several chains of triangles further reductions became necessary, to make the triangulation everywhere consistent <hi rend="italic">inter se</hi> and with the verificatory baselines, so that the lengths and azimuths of common sides and the latitudes and longitudes of common stations should be identical at the junctions of chains, and that the measured and computed lengths of the base-lines should also be identical.</p><p>How this was done will now be set forth. But first it must be noted that the triangulation might at the same time have been made consistent with any values of latitude, longitude, or azimuth which had been determined by astronomical observations at either of the trigonometrical stations. This, however, was undesirable, because such observations are liable to errors from deflexion of the plumb-line from the true normal under the influence of local attraction, and these errors are of a much greater magnitude than those that would be generated in triangulating between astronomical stations which are not a great distance apart. The trigonometrical elements could not be forced into accordance with the astronomical without altering the angles by amounts much larger than their probable errors, and the results would be useless for investigations of the figure of the earth. The only independent facts of observation which could be legitimately combined with the angular adjustments were the base-lines, and all these were employed, while the several astronomical determinations—of latitude, differential longitude, and azimuth—were held in reserve for future geodetic investigations.</p><p>As an illustration of the problem for treatment, suppose a combination of three meridional and two longitudinal chains comprising seventy-two single triangles, with a base-line at each corner, as shown in the accompanying diagram (fig. 2) ; suppose the three angles of every triangle to have been</p><p>measured and made con</p><p>sistent. Let A be the ori</p><p>gin, with its latitude and</p><p>longitude given, and also</p><p>the length and azimuth of</p><p>the adjoining base-line.</p><p>With these data processes</p><p>of calculation are carried</p><p>through the triangulation</p><p>to obtain the lengths and</p><p>azimuths of the sides and</p><p>the latitudes and longi</p><p>tudes of the stations, say in the following order :—from A through B to E, through F to E, through F to D, through F and E to C, and through F and D to C. Then there are two values of side, azimuth, latitude, and longitude at E,—one from the righthand chains <hi rend="italic">via</hi> B, the other from the left-hand chains <hi rend="italic">via</hi> F ; similarly there are two sets of values at C ; and each of the baselines at B, C, and D has a calculated as well as a measured value. Thus eleven absolute errors are presented for dispersion over the triangulation by the application of the most appropriate correction to each angle, and, as a preliminary to the determination of these corrections, equations must be constructed between each of the absolute errors and the unknown errors of the angles from which</p><p><hi rend="superscript">@@@1</hi> See <hi rend="italic">Account of the Principal Triangulation of the Ordnance Survey,</hi> 1858, and <hi rend="italic">Comparisons of Standards of Length,</hi> 1866.</p></body></text></TEI>
