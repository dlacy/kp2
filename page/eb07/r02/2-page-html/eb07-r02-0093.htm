<p><span class="font0">ning counter to the whole tone of sentiment created up to the period of explanation,—as disappointing the pride of the&nbsp;reader, who feels offended at the thought that he has expended so much anxiety and terror on a mere “ painted&nbsp;devil,” and a succession of mockeries ; and is consequently&nbsp;annoyed at this common-place anticlimax, after his nerves&nbsp;have been tuned for grand wonders, instead of the discovery of paltry images of wax-work. Indeed, it is one&nbsp;of the strongest proofs of the redeeming genius which Mrs.&nbsp;Radcliffe has thrown into her tales, constructed, as they&nbsp;are, upon so unsatisfactory a plan, that they bear a second&nbsp;perusal at all ; or that having discovered in one or two&nbsp;cases the inadequate and puerile nature of what appeared at first so appalling and formidable, we still feel eager&nbsp;for the solution of the remaining mysteries, and can hardly&nbsp;persuade ourselves but that something strange and fearful&nbsp;does lurk, after all, within her deserted chambers, and beneath her faded tapestry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is the more to be regretted that Mrs. Radcliffe adopted this principle, because all the excellencies of her peculiar&nbsp;genius might have been displayed with equal effect, if she&nbsp;had chosen a more satisfactory plan of composition. Why&nbsp;she should have hesitated to admit of an actual spiritual&nbsp;agency, it is difficult to discover. Fear, when its object is&nbsp;something corporeal, is no doubt the basest and vulgarest of&nbsp;feelings. But when its source lies in the invisible, and when&nbsp;we shrink at the thoughts of the visionary and the eternal,&nbsp;it puts on the character of sublimity. Standing, as we do,&nbsp;on the confines of a dim eternity, which we believe but&nbsp;cannot see, the feeling which prompts us to a communion&nbsp;with the world of spirits, and yet makes us shrink and&nbsp;tremble at our own daring, exists to such an extent in all&nbsp;minds, and not the least in the most heroic, as to afford a&nbsp;basis on which high imagination may always operate with&nbsp;effect, so as to justify the artful use of the supernatural. We&nbsp;say the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">artful</span><span class="font0"> use, for every thing depends on the skill with&nbsp;which such machinery is used, the address of the preparation, and the judgment with which the accessories and the&nbsp;background are selected. Who feels the slightest symptom&nbsp;of awe when the shade of Amphiaraus appears before tlle&nbsp;assembled people to forbid the banns between Eriphyle and&nbsp;Alcmæon, or that of Ninus emerges in broad day from the&nbsp;tomb, in Voltaire’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Semiramis?</span><span class="font0"> Who does not,—at least&nbsp;in reading the play,—experience a pleasing thrill of fear,&nbsp;¼dlen, in the depth of a December night, witll the sea moaning behind, and the bell then beating one, the majesty of&nbsp;buried Denmark advances with spectral stalk along the platform of Elsineur ? We grant there has been few successful&nbsp;attempts in modern times to keep up the interest of a story&nbsp;turning upon machinery avowedly supernatural, but we are&nbsp;far from thinking that such an attempt might not, even yet,&nbsp;in our days of illumination, be made by a man of genius, so&nbsp;as to move the pulses of terror with complete success.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But besides the actual field of the supernatural, there are many equivocal phenomena in our nature, lying within that&nbsp;debateable land where mind and body meet, such as dreams,&nbsp;omens, and presentiments, which admit of being referred by&nbsp;the mind, in an excited state, to supernatural causes, and&nbsp;which may be employed with powerful effect by writers of&nbsp;fiction, without the possession of that creative genius and&nbsp;knowledge of the human heart which are required to present the sheeted dead in a shape and garb of terror calculated to impress and awe the imagination. And such, in&nbsp;fact, is the diluted shape in which the supernatural is generally presented by our modern romance writers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">From all these sources of emotion, Mrs. Radcliffe has unfortunately excluded herself by her system of sufficient reason founded on natural causes. And yet it is wonderful what a magical power she exercises within the field to&nbsp;which she restricts herself. No one ever seems to have&nbsp;understood better the art of preparation, the attunement of&nbsp;the mind to the key of the supernatural, by a long train of&nbsp;half-heard sounds, and glimpses of sights, which the fancy,&nbsp;amidst night and silence, works up for itself into images of&nbsp;things which it fears to contemplate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Like one that on a lonesome road Doth walk in fear and dread ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">And having once looked round*, walks on,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">And turns no more his head,—</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Because be knows a frightful fiend Doth close behind him tread.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">And perhaps the strongest proof of her judgment is to be found in the economy and reserve with which she employs&nbsp;the talisman of terror. In her hands slight circumstances&nbsp;and half hints are made to produce all the effect of fearful&nbsp;witcheries or scenes of bloodshed and horror. The clang&nbsp;of a distant door, a footfall or a track of blood upon a staircase, a strain of music floating over a forest, a figure pacing&nbsp;a platform in silence, some wandering voice following us,&nbsp;“ with airy tongue that syllables men’s names,” through the&nbsp;passages of a decaying chateau, the heaving of the tapestry&nbsp;of a bed in somc deserted chamber, nay, at last a very rat&nbsp;behind the arras, become invested with a mysterious dignity, and work upon tlle imagination like spells. The disappearance of Ludovico, for instance, in the haunted apartment of Chateau Le Blanc, where he had undertaken to&nbsp;watch, prepared as it is by a train of little details which act&nbsp;upon the nerves, and by the masterly ghost story of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bevys&nbsp;of Lancaster,</span><span class="font0"> which he is represented as perusing, may be&nbsp;safely pointed out as a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">coup de rnaitre</span><span class="font0"> in the art of raising&nbsp;to its highest pitch, the feeling of curiosity and suspense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Whether Mrs. Radcliffe possessed much power of painting character seems doubtful ; it is at least certain she has shown but little. In such calculations of probability, we can&nbsp;only use Sebastian’s words.—“ What </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">had been</span><span class="font0"> is unknown,&nbsp;what </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">is,</span><span class="font0"> appears.” She seems indeed to have borrowed a&nbsp;hint from Bayes, which like many other remarks of that worthy, have more good sense in them than was perhaps apparent to the noble parodist, and purposely to have “underwrit&nbsp;some parts in order to set off the rest in other words, she&nbsp;has systematicallykept the delineation of her characters subordinate to her main object, tlle maintenance of a mysterious curiosity, which never </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">is,</span><span class="font0"> but always </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">is to be</span><span class="font0"> gratified.&nbsp;Her tales, indeed, would have probably gained little by&nbsp;greater discrimination in this respect, if in truth the species&nbsp;of interest produced by the natural would not have rather&nbsp;interfered with that arising from the marvellous. For her&nbsp;object, it was sufficient that as the representatives of classes,&nbsp;rather than individuals, her personages should be sketched&nbsp;spiritedly but lightly ; that the straight-laced heroine in&nbsp;white satin, should be duly supported by the gossiping waiting woman in white muslin, and that the bandit chief of&nbsp;the Appenines, the hired robber, the scowling monk, or the&nbsp;chattering peasant should wear with a natural air the outward and conventional badges of their calling. The nearest approach she has made to character, is in her Schidoni,&nbsp;whoseoutward appearance is most picturesquely and impress-ingly described, while the inscrutable mystery which at first&nbsp;hangs over the inward man, the dark hints which are dropped concerning him by others, and the gradual revelation&nbsp;of his designs in his conversations with the Marchioness,&nbsp;powerfully stimulate our interest, and make us follow all&nbsp;his actions with an instinctive feeling of alarm. The misfortune is that even in this, the most finished of her portraits, the Schidoni of the second is really not the Schidoni&nbsp;of the first portion of the tale. When “ the father softens,”&nbsp;the confessor unfortunately can no longer “ remain fixed ;”&nbsp;when he ceases to be the mere evil spirit of the romance,&nbsp;puts on the look even of a guilty humanity, and turns out&nbsp;to be simply “ a bold bad man,” he loses bis identity, and&nbsp;with that his influence over the imagination.</span></p>
