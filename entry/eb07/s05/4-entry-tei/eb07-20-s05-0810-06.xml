or <hi rend="smallcaps">Surface,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Geometry,</hi> the outside or exterior face of any body. This is considered as having the two dimensions of length and breadth only, but no thickness ; and therefore it makes no part of the substance, or solid content, or matter, of the body. The terms, or bounds, or extremities, of a superficies, are lines ; and superficies may be considered as generated by the motions of lines. Superficies are either rectilinear, curvilinear, plane, concave, or convex. A rectilinear superficies is that which is bounded by right lines ; curvilinear superficies is bounded by curve lines ; plane superficies is that which has no inequality in it, or risings, or sinkings, but lies evenly and straight throughout, so that a right line may wholly coincide with it in all parts and directions ; convex superficies is that which is curved and rises outwards ; concave superficies is curved and sinks inwards.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
