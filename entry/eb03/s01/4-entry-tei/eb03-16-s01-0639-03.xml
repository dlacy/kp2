is a Chineſe boat without a keel, looking almoſt like a trough; they are made of different dimenſions, but are moſtly covered.<note anchored="false" n="1" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>Oshec's Voyage to China and the East Indies</p></note> Theſe boats are as long as ſloops, but broader, almoſt like a baking trough; and have at the end one or more decks of bamboo ſticks: the cover or roof is made of bamboo ſticks, arched over in the ſhape of a grater; and may be railed or lowered at pleaſure: the ſides are made of boards, with little holes, with ſhutters inſtead of win</p><p>dows: the boards are faſtened on both ſides to polls, which have notches like ſteps on the inſides, that the roof may be let down, and reft on them: on both ends of the deck are commonly two little doors, at leaſt there is one at the hindmoſt end. A fine white ſmooth carpet ſpread up as far as the boards make3 the floor, which in the middle conſiſts of looſe boards; but this carpet is only made uſe of to ſleep on. As theſe boats greatly differ from ours in ſhape, they are likewiſe rowed in a different manner: for two rowers, polling themſelves at the back end of the ſampan, work it forwards very readily by the motion of two oars; and can almoſt turn the veſſel juſt as they pleaſe: the ores, which are covered with a little hollow quadrangular iron, are laid on iron ſwivels, which are faſtened in the ſides of the ſampan: at the iron the oars are pieced, which makes them look a little bent: in common, a rower fits before with a ſhort oar; but this he is forced to lay aſide when he comes near the city, on account of the great throng of ſampans; and this inconvenience has confirmed the Chineſe in their old way of rowing, Inſtead of pitch, they make uſe of a cement like our putty, which we call <hi rend="italic">chinam,</hi> but the Chineſe call it <hi rend="italic">kiang.</hi> Some authors ſay that this cement is made of lime and a reſin exuding from the tree <hi rend="italic">tong yea,</hi> and bamboo ockam.</p><p>Beſides a couple of chairs, they have the following furniture: two oblong tables or boards on which ſome Chinefe characters are drawn; a lanthorn for the night-time, and a pot to boil rice in. They have alfo a little cover for their houſehold god, decorated with gilt paper and other ornaments: before him ſtands a pot filled with aſhes, into which the tapers are put before the idol. The candles are nothing elſe than bamboo chips, to the upper end of which ſaw-duſt of ſandalwood is ſtuck on with gum. Theſe tapers are everywhere lighted before the idols in the pagodas, and before the doors in the ſtreets; and, in large cities, occaſion a ſmoke very pernicious to the eyes. Before this idol ſtands ſome <hi rend="italic">ſamſo,</hi> or Chineſe brandy, water, &amp;c. We ought to try whether the Chineſe would not like to uſe juniper-wood inſtead of fandal-wood; which latter comes from Suratte, and has almoſt the ſame ſmell with juniper.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
