They now erected themſelves into an eccleſiaſtical court, which they called the As<hi rend="italic">ſociated Preſbytery,</hi> and preached occaſionally to numbers of the people who joined them indifferent parts of the country. They alſo publiſhed what they called an Act, <hi rend="italic">Declarations and Testimony,</hi> to the doctrine, worſhip, government, and diſcipline of the church oſ Scotland, and againſt ſeveral inſtances, as they ſaid, of defection from theſe, both in former and in the preſent times. Some time arter this ſeveral miniſters of the eſtabliſhed church joined them, and the Aſſociated Preſhytery now conſiſted of eight miniſters. But the general aſe ſembly which met in 1738 finding that the number of Seceders was much increaſed, ordered the eight miniſters to be ſerved with a libel, and to be cited to the next meeting of the aſſembly in 1739. They now appeared at the bar as a conſtituted preſbytery, and having formally declined the aſſembly’s authority, they immediately withdrew. The aſſembly which met next year depoſed them from the office of the miniſtry; which, however, they continued to exerciſe in their reſpective congregations, who ſtill adhered to them, and erected meeting-houſes, where they preached till their death. Mr James Fiſher, the laſt ſurvivor oſ them, was, by an unanimous call in 1741, tranſlated from Kinclaven to Glaſgow, where he continued in the exerciſe of his miniſtry among a numerous congregation, reſpected by all ranks in that large city, and died in 1775 much regretted by his people and friends. In 1745 the ſeceding miniſters were become ſo numerous, that they were erected into three different preſbyteries, under one ſynod, when a very unprofitable dispute divided them into two parties.</p><p>The burgeſs oath in ſome of the royal boroughs of Scotland contains the following clauſe: “I profeſs and allow with my heart the true religion preſently profeſſed within this realm, and authoriſed by the laws thereof. I will abide at and defend the ſame to my life’s end, renouncing the Romiſh religion called <hi rend="italic">Papistry</hi> Meſſrs Ebenezer and Ralph Erſkine, James Fiſher, and others, affirmed that this clauſe was no way contrary to the principles upon which the ſeceſſion was formed, and that therefore every Seceder might lawfully ſwear it. Meſſrs Alexander Moncrief, Thomas Mair, Adam Gib, and others, contended on the other hand</p><p>that the ſwearing oſ the above clauſe was a virtual renunciation of their teſtimony. And this controverſy was ſo keenly agitated, that they ſplit into two different parties, and now meet in different ſynods. Thoſe or them who affert the lawfulneſs of ſwearing the burgeſs oath are called <hi rend="italic">Burghers,</hi> and the other party wſho condemn it are called A<hi rend="italic">ntiburgher Seceders.</hi> Each party claiming to itſelf the lawful conſtitution of the <hi rend="italic">Aſſociate Synod,</hi> the Antiburghers, after ſeveral previous ſteps, excommunicated the Burghers on the ground of their fin and of their contumacy in it. This rupture took place in 1747, ſince which period no attempts to effect a reunion have been ſucceſsful. They remain under the juriſdiction of different ſynods, and hold ſeparate communion, although much of their former hoſtilſty has been laid aſide. The Antiburgſhers conſider the Burghers as too lax and not Efficiently ſtedfaſt to their teſtimony. The Burghers on the other hand contend that the Antiburghers are too rigid, in that they have introduced new terms of communion into the ſociety. The Antiburghers having adopted ideas with regard to what they call <hi rend="italic">covenanting,</hi> wſhich the Burghers never approved @@<hi rend="smallcaps">(a),</hi> have been in uſe of renewing in their ſeveral congregations the Scottiſh Covenant, by cauſing their people formally ſwear to maintain it. In other reſpects the differences between the two parties are not material. The Antiburghers are moſt numerous on the north of the Tay, and the Burghers on the ſouth of it.</p><p>What follows in this article is a further account of thoſe who are commonly called the <hi rend="italic">Burgher Seceders. </hi>Theſe have a greater number of people in their communion than the Antiburghers, and for ſome years paſt they have greatly increaſed in the ſouthern and weſtern diſtricts of Scotland. As there were among them from the commencement of their ſeceſſion ſeveral ſtudents who had been educated at one or other of the univerſities, they appointed one of their miniſters to give lectures in theology, and train up candidates for the miniſtry. Meſſrs William Willon miniſter at Perth and Alexander Moncrief miniſter at Abernethy were their proſefſors of theology before their ſeparation from the Antiburgſhers.</p><p>Since that period Mr Ebenezer Erſkine miniſter at Stirling, Mr James Fiſher miniſter at Glaſgow, Mr John Swanſton miniſter at Kſhroſs, and Mr John Brown miniſter at Haddington, have ſucceeded each other in this office. At preſent (1794) Mr George Eawſon miniſter at Selkirk is their profeſſor of theology, and there are between thirty and forty ſtudents who attend his lectures annually. The number of their miniſters is about an hundred, and each of their congregations contain from two hundred and fifty to three thouſand perſons; and there are among them at preſent more than twenty vacant charges. Where a congregation is very numerous, as in Stirling, Dunfermline, and Perth, it is formed into a collegiate charge, and provided with two miniſters. They are erected into ſix dif-</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">@@@(a)</hi> This is the account which the Burghers give of their own notions reſpecting the covenant. One of the moſt enlightened of their opponents, however, aſſure us that they acknowledge covenanting to be a <hi rend="italic">moral duty, </hi>and that the ſolemn vows of our anceſtors are obligatory. But ſince the breach in the ſynod they have never engaged in this work; giving, as their reaſon, that this is not the proper ſeaſon.</p></body></text></TEI>
