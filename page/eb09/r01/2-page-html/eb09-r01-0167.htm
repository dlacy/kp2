<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">innocence unjustly accused, and we also find tlie possession of the bones of a departed hero made the condition of a&nbsp;successful war.@@<sup>1</sup> But the second book of Kings relates the&nbsp;revival of a dead man by the bones of Elisha,—a narrative&nbsp;rendered the more remarkable by the fact that, as a rule,&nbsp;the contact with a corpse, a bone, or a grave made a man&nbsp;unclean for seven days (Num. xix. 11-22).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The New Testament does not relate any case precisely similar to that of Elisha. The remains of the protomartyr&nbsp;Stephen are simply committed to the tomb, with much&nbsp;lamentation by devout men (Acts viii. 2); and of the&nbsp;funeral of the first martyred apostle, James, we have no&nbsp;record. It is not, however, to be denied that the book of&nbsp;Acts tells of miracles of healing resembling that of her who&nbsp;was cured by the touch of our Lord’s garment (Matt. ix.&nbsp;20-22). Even the shadow of Peter, it is implied, may&nbsp;have healed the sick ; and handkerchiefs or aprons which&nbsp;had been worn by Paul relieved not only the diseased but&nbsp;the possessed (Acts v. 15; xix. 12).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">To a great extent the homage paid to the tombs and the remains of patriot, sage, or bard was transferred, at an&nbsp;early period in the history of the Christian church, to&nbsp;those of its own heroes, more especially to those of&nbsp;martyrs. Such a result was natural, and almost inevitable.&nbsp;The intercession of the departed on behalf of the living&nbsp;was everywhere recognized, and that of martyrs naturally&nbsp;believed to be especially powerful. But it was further&nbsp;inferred from the instance of Elisha and from the passages&nbsp;of the book of Acts already cited that it might please the&nbsp;Almighty to repeat similar manifestations of miraculous&nbsp;power. Whether the fathers who maintain this view&nbsp;w<sup>r</sup>ould have written so freely if they could have foreseen&nbsp;the abuses which were to arise may perhaps be doubted.@@<sup>2&nbsp;</sup>But three or four features in the history of early Christendom conspired to spread the cultus of relics. These were&nbsp;the heathen persecutions, the rise of Gnosticism, the strong&nbsp;and exaggerated feeling about possession and witchcraft,&nbsp;—to which may probably be added the sense of a sort of&nbsp;education connected with visible and tangible links of&nbsp;connexion with the past.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The way in which these elements of the case would operate is tolerably obvious. If, as at Lyons and Vienne,&nbsp;pagan persecutors burnt the ashes of the martyrs, and&nbsp;threw them into the Ehone, exulting in the idea that they&nbsp;were disproving one of the most important articles of the&nbsp;Christian creed, the resurrection of the body, with still&nbsp;more fervid zeal would the faithful seize every opportunity&nbsp;of honouring those remains which their opponents sought&nbsp;to vilify. Then, again, the other great foe of early Christendom, the heresy of Gnosticism (often denounced as a more&nbsp;subtle and dangerous evil than the open hostility of&nbsp;heathendom), amidst all its varied forms was consistent&nbsp;in representing matter as something essentially evil. The&nbsp;counter teaching, implied in the central doctrine of the</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>@@@1</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We allude to the miracle claimed by two poets, Ovid </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(Fast.,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> iv.&nbsp;310) and Propertius (</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Eleg</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">., iv. 14, 51), as also by Livy, Cicero, and&nbsp;Pliny, to have been wrought by Cybele on behalf of the Vestal Claudia,&nbsp;and to the oracular injunction from Delphi to the Spartans to find and&nbsp;carry with them the bones of Orestes as a condition of success&nbsp;against the men of Tegea (Herodotus, i. 67-68).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>@@@2</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A set of passages is given by Petavius </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(De Dogmatibus Theologicis,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“ De Incarnatione,” xiv. 11). It certainly includes most of the leading&nbsp;post-Nicene patristic names,—such as Eusebius and many fathers&nbsp;commonly honoured with the prefix of saint, as Gregory of Nazianzus,&nbsp;Gregory of Nyssa, Chrysostom, both the Cyrils, Ambrose, Jerome,&nbsp;and others. Of these St Jerome is the most extreme and vehement;&nbsp;but this is accounted for, not only by the author’s temperament, but&nbsp;by the fact of his writing against an opponent whom he specially disliked on personal as well as theological grounds </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(Contra Vigilanlium&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">liber unus).</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Later writers on the same side with Vigilantius are&nbsp;Claudius of Turin and Agobard of Lyons, but our limits forbid us to&nbsp;discuss their views. Some sectaries (</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">e.g</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">., the Novatianists) appear to&nbsp;have been as anxious as their opponents to collect relics.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Christian faith, the mystery of the incarnation, and in the sacraments, might seem to gain some aid from the veneration shown to what was regarded as another form of&nbsp;hallowed matter, the bodies of the saints or the material&nbsp;instruments of Christ’s passion. And, thirdly, the dread of&nbsp;possession found some alleviation in the check to satanic&nbsp;malice which relics were believed to effect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">It is also conceivable that the interest created by such memorials might have its share in that education of the&nbsp;earlier Middle Ages which was so powerfully assisted by&nbsp;pilgrimages and by biographies. Guizot, in a well-known&nbsp;chapter of his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Civilisation en France</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> has dwelt largely on&nbsp;the value of even the legends of this period. He maintains that, in a world full of violence, disorder, and&nbsp;oppression, the legends of the saints found food for some&nbsp;of the most powerful instincts and invincible needs of the&nbsp;human mind—that exaggeration of details, or even failure&nbsp;in material truth, did not prevent them from being a moral&nbsp;relief and a protest on behalf of many of the rights of man.&nbsp;]Material memorials, or even supposed memorials, would&nbsp;certainly help to impress such stories upon the mind, as is&nbsp;the case with the facts and the legends of secular history.&nbsp;Leibnitz, among the large concessions in his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Systema Theo-logicum</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> to the Roman Catholic view of these questions, in&nbsp;some degree anticipates the language of Guizot concerning&nbsp;pious legends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">In any case, alike for good and for evil,—and it will be necessary to speak presently of the sadder aspects of&nbsp;the question,— relics from the 4th to the 16th century&nbsp;occupied a large space in the mind of Christendom. The&nbsp;word relics (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">reliquiae, Xeiipavo)</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> became almost restricted,&nbsp;in theological language, to the bodies (or parts of the&nbsp;bodies) of saints, or, as has been intimated, to memorials of&nbsp;Christ’s passion, or instruments which had been used in&nbsp;the torture and execution of martyrs. Inquiries connected with their genuineness are, as is well known to&nbsp;students of ecclesiastical history, conspicuous in the life of&nbsp;the mother of Constantine, St Helena, who claimed to&nbsp;have discovered the true cross on which our Lord suffered,&nbsp;and in the career of St Ambrose at Milan. Once at&nbsp;least a really glorious series of campaigns, those of the&nbsp;emperor Heraclius against the barbarian Avars and the&nbsp;Persians (622-628), is connected with a successful endeavour to regain the cross (see </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Persia, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">vol. xviii. pp. 614-615). It is remarkable that the Persians are reported to&nbsp;have kept the cross in its case with the seals unbroken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Thus far relics have been regarded as evidencing two marks of a very powerful element of life, namely, the&nbsp;capacity of evoking enthusiasm and of influencing even&nbsp;bystanders or opponents. But it is time to turn to the&nbsp;more painful features of their history in connexion with&nbsp;Christian thought and practice. It must not be supposed&nbsp;that the recognition of such phases is by any means a&nbsp;purely Protestant sentiment, although ־it is no doubt a prominent feature in the Reformation of the 16th century.&nbsp;Thus, for example, one of the most credulous biographies&nbsp;of a saint of the 4tli century, that of St Martin by&nbsp;Sulpicius Severus, mentions (chap, viii.) an instance where&nbsp;the supernatural insight of Martin was exerted in the way&nbsp;of repression of such homage. The country people were&nbsp;exhibiting veneration at the tomb of a supposed saint, but&nbsp;it w־as revealed to the bishop of Tours that it was that of&nbsp;a robber executed for his crimes. St Augustine, in his&nbsp;severe and satiric tractate against certain unworthy monks&nbsp;who made their profession a mere cloak for idleness, clearly&nbsp;insinuates the sale of questionable relics as one of their&nbsp;faults. “ Alii membra martyrum, si tamen martyrum,&nbsp;venditant.” The traffic in relics became part of the recognized commerce of Christendom and was countenanced by&nbsp;sovereigns of undoubted excellence. Thus Athelstan was</span></p>
