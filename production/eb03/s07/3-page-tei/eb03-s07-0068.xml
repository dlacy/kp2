He was ſtrongly ſolicited by the elector of Bavaria to come to his aſſiſtance ; but, in revenge of the elector’s having formerly obtained the command for count Tilly in preference to himſelf, he drew off towards Bohemia to encounter the Saxons. Arnheim, who commanded the Saxon forces in that place, was the enemy of Guſtavus, who had formerly rallied him for his cowardice. He therefore permitted Walleſtein to gain an eaſy victory, in hopes that his maſter, the elector of Saxony, a prince entirely devoted to his pleaſures, might be induced to relinquiſh the friendſhip of ſuch a reſtleſs and warlike ally as Guſtavus ; and indeed he uſed all the eloquence of which he was maſter to detach him from the Swediſh cauſe. Several advantages, in the mean time, were gained by the Imperialiſts. Pappenheim defeated the archbiſhop of Bremen’s cavalry at Werden ; and three Swediſh regiments were cut off near Kadingen. Pappenheim, however, was forced to retire, and withdraw his forces from Stade ; of which the Swedes took poſſeſſion. Walleſtein and the elector of Bavaria, who had now joined their forces, threatened Guſtavus with greatly ſuperior numbers. At laſt, however, the king, being reinforced with 15,030 men, no longer declined the engagement ; but Walleſtein was too wise to truſt the fate of the empire to a ſingle engagement againſt ſuch an enemy as the king of Sweden. Guſtavus attacked his camp, but was repulſed with the loss of 2000 men ; which caused a general murmuring and diſcontent againſt his raſhness. Several other misfortunes happened to the Swedes ; and at laſt, after various manœuvres, Walleſtein bent his course towards Misnia, in order to oblige the elector of Saxony to declare againſt the Swedes, and to draw them out of Bavaria, Guſtavus, notwithſtanding the inconſtancy of Auguſtus, immediately ſet out to aſſiſt him. With incredible diligence he marched to Miſnia, where the Imperialiſts were aſſembling their whole ſtrength. Hearing that the enemy were encamped at Wesenfells, and that Pappenheim had been detached with a ſtrong corps, Guſtavus reſolved to engage them before they could effect a junction. With this view he marched to Lutzen, where he attacked Walleſtein with incredible fury. The Swediſh infantry broke the Imperialiſts in ſpite of their utmoſt efforts, and took all their artillery. The cavalry not being able to paſs the river ſo expeditiouſly as the king thought necessary, he led the way, attended only by the regiment of Srnaaland and the duke of Saxe-Lauwenburg. Here, after charging impetuouſly, he was killed, as Puffendorff alleges, by the treachery of the duke ; who, being corrupted by the emperor, ſhot him in the back during the heat of the action. The news of his death was in an inſtant ſpread over both armies. The courage of the Imperialiſts revived, and they now made themſelves ſure of victory. But the Swedes, eager to revenge the death of their beloved monarch, charged with ſuch fury that nothing could reſiſt them. The Imperialiſts were defeated a ſecond time, juſt as Pappenheim, with his freſh corps, came up to their aſſiſtance. On this the battle was renewed, but the Swedes were ſtill irreſiſtible. Pappenheim was mortally wounded, and his army finally routed, with the loſs of 9000 killed in the field and in the pursuit.</p><p>The victory of Lutzen proved more unfortunate to  Sweden than the greateſt defeat. The crown devolved upon Chriſtina, an infant of six years old ; the nation was involved in an expenſive foreign war, without any perſon equal to the arduous taſk of commanding the armies, or regulating domeſtic affairs, as Guſtavus had done. However, Chriſtina the daughter of Guſtavus was immediately proclaimed queen. The regency devolved on the grand bailiff, the mariſchal, the high-admiral, the chancellor, and the treaſurer of the crown. Oxenſtiern was inveſted with the chief management of affairs, and conducted himſelf with the greateſt prudence. He was greatly embarraſſed indeed by the diviſions among the Proteſtant princes, which became more violent after the death of Guſtavus ; but, in ſpite of all difficulties, he went on purſuing the intereſt of his country, and planning the means of retaining the Swediſh conqueſts. Matters went on pretty ſucceſsfully till the year 1634, when, through the raſhneſs of the Swediſh ſoldiers, they were defeated at Nordlingen, with the lois of 6000 men killed on the ſpot, a number of priſoners, and 1 30 ſtandards, with other military trophies, taken by the enemy. Oxenſtiern’s conſtancy was ſhaken by this dreadful blow ; but he applied himſelf diligently to repair the loſs, by recruiting the army, and rendering the allies faithful. The latter proved the moſt difficult taſk. The death of Guſtavus, and the defeat at Nordlingen, had thrown them into deſpair ; and every one was desirous of making the beſt terms he could with the emperor. The Saxons not only renounced their alliance with Sweden, but openly commenced war againſt it ; and though the regency would gladly have conſented to an honourable peace, the enemy were now too much flushed with ſucceſs to grant it. Oxenſtiern had no other reſource than an alliance with France, and the bravery of his generals. In 1635, he went in perſon to the court of Louis, and concluded a treaty ; which, however, anſwered no purpoſe, as it was never obſerved. The enemy, in the mean time, pushed their good fortune. They ſurpriſed Philipſburg, where the French had laid up vaſt magazines; and reduced Spires, Augſhurg, Treves, Wurtſburg, Cobourg, and ſome other places. To complete the misfortunes of Sweden, it was expected that the Poles would immediately invade Pruſſia. To prevent this, La Gardie was diſpatched thither with a powerful army ; but as it was impoſſible to reſiſt ſo many enemies at once, the chancellor purchaſed the friendſhip of Poland for 26 years by ceding that duchy to the republic. Thus he got rid of a powerful enemy ; and the Swediſh affairs began to revive by a victory which general Bannier gained over the Saxons, in conſequence of which they were driven beyond the Elbe.</p><p>Early in the ſpring of 1636, the Saxons made ſome motions as if they intended to cut off Bannier’s communication with Pomerania. This he prevented by a ſtratagem ; defeated a body of the enemy ; and obliged the Saxons to retire. Soon after this he drove them out of their winter-quarters with conſiderable loſs ; at which time alſo a conſiderable body of Imperialiſts who came to their aſſiſtance were diſperſed. In Weſtphalia general Kniphauſen beat the Imperialiſts with the loſs of 1500 men, but he himſelf was killed in the purſuit, and his army obliged to repaſs the Weser. Some advantages were alſo gained in the neighbourhood of Minden by General Leſly, who had assembled a conſiderable army. In Alface, Bernard duke of Saxe-Weymar defeated count Gallas the Imperial general, and diſperſed his army. Eut vzhen every thing ſeemed thus ſucceſsful for the Swedes, the city of Magdeburg, contrary to the expectation of every body, ſurrendered for want of powder, which the garrison had wantonly conſumed. The Saxons alſo made ſome conqueſts on the Elbe, which obliged Bannier to recal general Lesly from Weſtphalia to marcl againſt them. The Saxons fixed on a moſt convenient ſituation, whence they hoped to deſtroy the Swediſh army with out coming to a battle. But Bannier, reſolving to hazard</p></body></text></TEI>
