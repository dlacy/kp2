<p><span class="font0">to make way after six months’ interval for Émile Ollivier. He still fought for reaction in his new office of president of the&nbsp;Senate. After the fall of the Empire he fled to England, but&nbsp;returned to France a year later to work for the fortunes of the&nbsp;prince imperial. After serious disturbances he was elected&nbsp;member for Ajaccio on the nth of February 1872, his election&nbsp;being characterized by the prefect of Corsica as a regular conspiracy in favour of the Empire. In the Chamber, where he&nbsp;subsequently represented Riom, he formed the group of the&nbsp;Appel au Peuple. His first speech in the House was the occasion (May 21, 1872) of violent attacks by Audiffret-Pasquier&nbsp;and Gambetta. The death of the prince imperial in 1879 put&nbsp;an end to the serious chances of the Bonapaitists, although&nbsp;Rouher sought to secure the recognition of Prince Napoleon,&nbsp;son of the ex-king Jerome, as heir to the imperial honours.&nbsp;Rouher lost his reason after a stroke of paralysis in 1883, and&nbsp;died on the 3rd of February 1884.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For an estimate of Rouher, see marquis de Castellane, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Les Hommes d'état français du xix*. siècle</span><span class="font0"> (1888), and generally the literature&nbsp;dealing with the Second Empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROULERS (Flemish </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Roeselacre),</span><span class="font0"> a town of Belgium, in the province of West Flanders, 13 m. N.W. of Courtrai. Pop.&nbsp;(1904) 24,548. It is one of the oldest communes in Belgium,&nbsp;and was famous for its weavers in the nth and 12th centuries.&nbsp;Its prosperity depends on the cultivation of flax and the manufacture of linen. The church of St Michael is remarkable for&nbsp;its lofty tower. Baldwin VIII., count of Flanders, died here in&nbsp;1120, and in 1794 the French under Pichegru defeated the&nbsp;Austrians under Clerfayt. 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROULETTE, in mathematics, the locus of a point carried on a curve which rolls on another (fixed) curve. The name appears&nbsp;to have been used by Pascal to denote the cycloid (ç.v.), which&nbsp;is the simplest roulette, being traced by a point on the circumference of a circle rolling on a straight line. The trochoids and&nbsp;epicycloids </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v</span><span class="font0">.) are also simple roulettes, the latter being&nbsp;traced by points on a circle which rolls on another circle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">See W. H. Besant, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Roulettes and Glissettes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROULETTE, a gambling game, of French origin. It is one of the two games played in the gambling-rooms at Monte Carlo,&nbsp;and the description here given, and the maximum and -minimum&nbsp;stakes mentioned, are to be understood as applying to the game&nbsp;as it is there conducted. It is solely a game of chance, though&nbsp;so-called “ systems ” are innumerable, and some of them for&nbsp;a short period often appear to give the player an advantage.&nbsp;There is no possible system, however, which will assure success&nbsp;in the long-run, and it is herein that the ingenuity of the game&nbsp;consists. Every systematic method of play must depend upon&nbsp;increased stakes to retrieve past losses; and though a player&nbsp;with an unlimited capital might be practically certain to&nbsp;achieve his end in the course of time, the circumstance that&nbsp;there is always a maximum renders the bank invincible. The&nbsp;roulette table, covered with a green cloth, is made up of precisely&nbsp;corresponding halves with a circular space let into the middle&nbsp;holding the wheel, on either side of which the cloth is divided into&nbsp;spaces marked </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">passe, pair,&nbsp;manque, impair,</span><span class="font0"> and the&nbsp;black and red diamonds. The&nbsp;wheel is divided into thirty-seven compartments, coloured alternately black and&nbsp;red, numbered from one to&nbsp;thirty-six, the thirty-seventh&nbsp;being zero. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pair</span><span class="font0"> indicates&nbsp;even numbers, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">impair</span><span class="font0"> odd&nbsp;numbers, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">manque</span><span class="font0"> includes the&nbsp;numbers from 1 to 18; </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">passe,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">from 19 to 36. The methods&nbsp;of staking arc innumerable.&nbsp;The minimum stake is five&nbsp;francs, which must he placed on the table in the form of a&nbsp;five-franc piece, and not in smaller change. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rouge, noir,</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">pair, impair, manque</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">passe</span><span class="font0"> are even chances; </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font0"> a stake put upon any of them is paid in corresponding coin&nbsp;should the player win, the exception being when the little ball&nbsp;which is spun round the wheel falls into zero, in which case&nbsp;the even money chances are put “ in prison ”—that is to say,&nbsp;laid aside until another spin, when if the bank wins they&nbsp;are lost, if the player wins he is allowed to retrieve his money.&nbsp;The maximum in the case of these chances is 6000 francs.&nbsp;Any one who desires to play </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">en plein</span><span class="font0"> puts his stake on one of the&nbsp;thirty-seven numbers. If the ball falls into the corresponding&nbsp;number on the wheel, the stake is paid thirty-five times; and&nbsp;as there are thirty-seven numbers on the board, with the advantage already described of imprisoning the even-money chances&nbsp;when zero comes up, it will be seen that there is a steady percentage in favour of the tables and consequently against the&nbsp;player. This percentage is of course greatly increased when,&nbsp;as is often the case, a second zero, called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">double-zèro,</span><span class="font0"> is used.&nbsp;In some gambling-houses there is even a third one, called&nbsp;Eagle Bird. The maximum stake allowed </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">en plein</span><span class="font0"> is 180&nbsp;francs. The next most daring selection is </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">à chevai,</span><span class="font0"> when the&nbsp;stake is placed on the line separating any two numbers, and if&nbsp;either of them wins the player is paid seventeen times, the&nbsp;highest stake permissible being 360 francs. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Transversale pieine&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">covers any three numbers in a line, the coin or note being placed&nbsp;on the line dividing any one of the numbers from the neighbouring even-money chance, as, for instance, het ween 4 and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">passe,</span><span class="font0"> or&nbsp;6 and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">manque.</span><span class="font0"> A </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">transversale simple</span><span class="font0"> covers six numbers, as,&nbsp;for example, where the line between 4 and 7 joins </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">passe,</span><span class="font0"> or&nbsp;between 6 and 9 joins </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">manque',</span><span class="font0"> and if any one òf these numbers&nbsp;wins, five times the value of the stake is paid, the maximum&nbsp;here being 1200 francs. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">En carré</span><span class="font0"> includes four numbers, the&nbsp;coin heing placed, for instance, on the cross between 1, 2, 4, 5,&nbsp;or 28, 29, 31, 32; eight times the value of the stake is paid,&nbsp;and the maximum is 760 francs. The dozens and the columns&nbsp;are also indicated on the board, the first dozen of course&nbsp;including 1 to 12. In each of the columns are twelve numbers in different order. A stake placed on either a dozen&nbsp;or a column is paid twice its value, the maximum here being&nbsp;3000 francs. A stake constantly played is called the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">quatre&nbsp;premiers,</span><span class="font0"> which includes zero, 1, 2 and 3, the stake being placed&nbsp;on the line where zero and 1 join </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">passe,</span><span class="font0"> or where zero and 3 join&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">manque.</span><span class="font0"> If any one of these four numbers, including zero, wins,&nbsp;the stake is paid eight times; and four times eight being thirty-two, there is a greater advantage to the table than when it loses&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">en plein</span><span class="font0"> or on certain other chances. Zero can also be played&nbsp;in combination with any one or two of its neighbours; if with&nbsp;one of them the stake is paid seventeen times, if with two of&nbsp;them eleven times. A croupier sits on either side of the wheel;&nbsp;there is also one at each end of the table, their business being&nbsp;to assist the players in staking and recovering their winnings.&nbsp;Behind each of the former pair an official on a high chair supervises the table. The croupier whose duty it is to spin the wheel&nbsp;waits for a time till stakes have been made, and then, exclaiming,&nbsp;“Messieurs, faites votre jeul” sets the cylinder in motion,&nbsp;throwing the ball in the direction contrary to that in which the&nbsp;wheel revolves. When it is seen that the ball will soon fall at&nbsp;rest in one of the compartments of the cylinder the croupier&nbsp;gives the notice, “ Rien ne va plus,” after which no stakes can&nbsp;be placed. When the ball finally rests in the compartment, the&nbsp;croupier announces the number and the even-money chances&nbsp;that win, as for instance </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rouge, impair</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">manque.</span><span class="font0"> He and&nbsp;his fellows then gather in with a rake all the money that has&nbsp;been lost, after which the winnings are paid and the game&nbsp;proceeds. At the beginning of play each table is supplied with&nbsp;a certain large sum. When the bank loses this and is forced to&nbsp;send for another supply it is said to be “ broken.”</span></p>
