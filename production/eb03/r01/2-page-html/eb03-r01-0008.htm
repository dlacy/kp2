<p><span class="font0">ents ; </span><span class="font1">which was certainly ſome </span><span class="font0">enormous </span><span class="font1">ſpecies </span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font1">ray, though we cannot pretend to determine the par-ticular kind, ûppian ſtyles it, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">the broadefi among ffhes:&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">he adds an account of its fondnefs of human fleſh, and&nbsp;the method it takes of deſtroying men, by over-laying&nbsp;and keeping them down by its vaſt weight till they are&nbsp;drowned. Phile </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(De propriet. anim.</span><span class="font1"> p. 85.J gives&nbsp;much the ſame relation. </span><span class="font0">W</span><span class="font1">e are inclined to give them&nbsp;credit, ſince a modern writer, of undoubted autho-rity *, gives the very ſame account of a fiſh found in&nbsp;the South Seas, the terror of thoſe employed in the&nbsp;pearl.ſiſhery. It is a ſpecies of ray, called there </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">manta,</span><span class="font1"> or the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">quilt,</span><span class="font1"> from its ſurrounding and wrapping&nbsp;up the unhappy divers till they are ſuffocated ; there-fore the negroes never go down without a ſharp knife&nbsp;to defend themſelves againſt the affaults of this terrible&nbsp;enemy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aſpera, or rough ray, is found in Loch-Broom in Scotland. The length from the noſe to the&nbsp;tip of the tail is two feet nine. The tail is almoſt of&nbsp;the ſame length with the body. The noſe is very ſhort.&nbsp;Before each eye is a large hooked ſpine ; and behind&nbsp;each another, beſet with leſſer. The upper part of the&nbsp;body is of a cinereous brown mixed with white, and&nbsp;ſpotted with black; and entirely covered with fmall&nbsp;ſpines. Οη the tail are three rows of great ſpines : all&nbsp;the reſt of the tail is irregularly bεfet with leſſer. The&nbsp;fins and under fide of the body are equally rough with&nbsp;the upper. The teeth are flat and rhυmboidal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fullonica, or fuller, derives its Latin name&nbsp;from the inſtrument fullers make uſe of in ſmoothing&nbsp;cloth, the back being rough and ſpiney. The noſe is&nbsp;ſhort and ſharp. At the corner of each eye are a few&nbsp;ſpines. The membrane of nictitation is fringed. Teeth&nbsp;ſmall and ſharp. Οη the upper part of the pectoral fins&nbsp;are three rows of ſpines pointing towards the back,&nbsp;crooked like thoſe on a fuller’s inſtrument. Οη the tail&nbsp;are three rows of ſtrong ſpines: the middle row reaches&nbsp;up part of the back. The tail is ſlender, and rather&nbsp;longer than the body. The colour of the upper part&nbsp;of the body is cinereous, marked uſually with numerous&nbsp;black ſpots : the lower part is white. This, as well as&nbsp;moſt other ſpecies of rays, vary a little in colour, ac-cordιng to age. <sup>r</sup>Fhιs grows to a iιze equal to the ſkate»&nbsp;It is common at Scarborough, where it is called the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">white hans,</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gullet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ζ.</span><span class="font1"> The ſhagreen ray increaſes to the ſize of the ſkate; is fond of launces or ſand-eels, which it takes generally&nbsp;as a bait. The form is narrower than that of the common kinds ; the noſe long and very ſharp ; pupil of the&nbsp;eye ſapphirine; on the noſe are two ſhort rows of ſpines;&nbsp;on the corner oſ the eyes another of a ſemicircular form;&nbsp;on the tail are two rows, continued a little up the back,&nbsp;ſmall, ſlender, and very ſharp : along the ſides of the&nbsp;tail is a row of minute ſpines, intermixed with innumerable little fpiculæ. The upper part of the body is of&nbsp;a cinereous brown, covered cloſely with ſhagreen-like&nbsp;tubercles, reſembling'the ſkin of the dog-fiſh: the under&nbsp;fide of the body is white ; from the noſe to the begin-ning of the pectoral fins is a tubercπlated ſpace. The&nbsp;teeth ſlender, and ſharp as needles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">6. The torpedo, cramp-ſiſh, or electric ray, is frequently taken in Torbay : has been once caught off&nbsp;Pembroke, and ſometimes near waterford in Ireland.&nbsp;It is generally taken, like other flat ſiſh, with the trawl ;&nbsp;but there is an inſtance of its taking the bait. It </span><span class="font0">com-</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">monly lies in </span><span class="font0">water </span><span class="font1">of about 40 fathoms depth ; and m company with the congenerous rays. The. torpedo,&nbsp;brings forth its yo&lt;ung at the autumnal equinox, as affirmed by Ariſtotle. A gentleman of La Rochelle, on&nbsp;diffecting certain females of this fpecies, the 10th of&nbsp;September, found in the matrices ſeveral of the fcetuſes&nbsp;quite formed, and nine eggs in no ſtate of forwardnefs :&nbsp;ſuperfcetation ſeems therefore to be a property of this fiſh-The food of the torpedo is fiſh ; a ſurmullet and a plaife&nbsp;have been found in the ſtomach of two of them. The fur-mullet is a fiſh of that ſwiftnefs, that it was impoffible&nbsp;for the torpedo to take it by purſuit. It is probable,&nbsp;therefore, that by their electric ſtroke they ſtupify their&nbsp;prey ; yet the crab and ſea-leech will venture to annoy&nbsp;them. They will live 24 hours out of the fea; and but&nbsp;very little longer if placed in freſh water. They inha-bit fandy places ; and will bury themfelves ſuperſicially&nbsp;in it, by flinging the ſand over, by a quick flapping of&nbsp;all the extremities. It is in this ſituation that the tor-pedo gives his moſt forcible ſhock, which throws down&nbsp;the aſtoniſhed paffenger who inadvertently treads upon&nbsp;him. In our ſeas it grows to a great ſize, and above&nbsp;80 pounds weight. The tail is thick and round ; the&nbsp;caudal fin broad and abrupt. The head and body,&nbsp;which are indiſtinct, are nearly round ; attenuating to&nbsp;extreme thinneſs on the edges ; below the body, the&nbsp;ventral fins form on each ſide a quarter of a circle. The&nbsp;two dorſal fins are placed on a trunk of the tail. The&nbsp;eyes are ſmall, placed near each other : behind each is a&nbsp;round ſpiracle, with fix ſmall cutaneous rags on their in-ner circumference. Mouth ſmall ; teeth minute, ſpicu-lar. Five openings to the gills, as in others of this ge-nus. The ſkin everywhere ſmooth ; cinereous brown&nbsp;above, white beneath. See further the article Elec-tricitv, n<sup>o</sup> 258 — 261.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">The clavata, or thornback, is eaſily diſtinguiſhed&nbsp;from the others by the rows of ſtrong ſharp ſpines diſ-poſed along the back and tail. In a large one ſeen by&nbsp;Mr Pennant, were three rows on the back, and five on&nbsp;the tail, all inclining towards its end. Οη the noſe,&nbsp;and on the inner ſide of the forehead, near the eyes,&nbsp;were a few ſpines, and others were ſcattered without&nbsp;any order on the upper part of the pectoral fins. The&nbsp;mouth was ſmall, and filled with granulated teeth : The&nbsp;upper part of the body was oſ a pale aſh colour, mark-ed with ſhort ſtreaks of black, and the ſkin rough, with&nbsp;ſmall tubercles like ſhagreen. The belly white, croffed&nbsp;with a ſtrong ſemilunar cartilage beneath the lkin : in&nbsp;general, the lower part was ſmooth, having only a few&nbsp;ſpines on each ſide. The young ſiſh have very few ſpines&nbsp;on them ; and their backs are often ſpotted with white,&nbsp;and each ſpot is encircled with black. This ſpecie-s&nbsp;frequents our ſandy ſhores; are very voracious, and feed&nbsp;on all forts of flat fiſh ; are particularly fond of herrings&nbsp;and ſand-eels ; and ſometimes eat cruſtaceous animals,&nbsp;ſuch as crabs. Thefe ſometimes weigh 14 or 15 pounds,&nbsp;but with us ſeldom exceed that freight. They begin&nbsp;to generate in June, and bring forth their young in Ju-Iy and Auguſt, which (as well as thofe </span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font1">the ſkate) be-fore they are old enough to breed, are called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">maids.</span><span class="font1"> The&nbsp;thornback begins to be in ſeaſon in November, and con-tinues ſo later than the ſkate, but the young of both are&nbsp;good at all times of the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The paſtinaca, or ſting ray, does not grow to the&nbsp;bulk of the others : The body is quite ſmooth, of ſhape&nbsp;almoſt </span><span class="font0">round, and is </span><span class="font1">of a much greater thickneſs and</span></p>
