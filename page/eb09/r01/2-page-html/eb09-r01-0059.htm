<p><span class="font1">Railway carriages are composed of two distinct parts,—the underframe or substructure, and the body or superstructure. The underframe has to carry the body and to resist the stress of work. It should be on axles placed well apart, and should be firmly framed&nbsp;together, of hard wood, with iron tie-rods, brackets, knees, straps,&nbsp;bolts, and nuts. Powerful laminated springs are lodged Within&nbsp;the frame to take the pull of the train through the central drawbars and to intercept and absorb the thrusts of the buffers at the&nbsp;ends through the buffing-rods.

<p><span class="font1">Each of these carriages is fitted With a vacuum brake. In the beginning of 1885 there Were 837 bogie carriages at work on the&nbsp;Midland Railway, inclusive of 34 Pullman cars. The bogie cars,&nbsp;in virtue of their ability to swing their bogies to the curves on the&nbsp;line, run more freely than ordinary carriages, which have parallel&nbsp;axles. Six-wheeled carriages are enabled to run the more freely&nbsp;by an allowance of lateral play for the axle-boxes of the middle&nbsp;axle between the axle-guards, whereby the wheels adapt themselves&nbsp;freely to the rails on curves. The Pullman cars in use on the&nbsp;Midland Railway were sent from America. They are of two kinds,&nbsp;—the drawing-room for day service and the sleeping-car. The&nbsp;body of the cars is 51½ feet in length externally and 8 feet 9 inches&nbsp;wide. Inside the body is 8 feet 2 inches wide, and 8 feet 6½ inches&nbsp;high above the floor. The total length, including the gangways&nbsp;at the ends, is 58 feet. Each car is mounted on two four-wheeled&nbsp;bogies. There are seats for twenty-seven persons in the drawingroom car, with lavatories and heating apparatus, and twenty-two&nbsp;beds are made up in each sleeping-car. The cars weigh 21½ tons&nbsp;and their cost is £2700 each.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The carriage stock of the Metropolitan Railway was designed to carry large numbers. The bodies of the carriages are 39½ feet in&nbsp;length and 8½ feet wide outside, running on eight wheels, of which&nbsp;the extreme axles radiate, or are movable laterally to suit the&nbsp;curves of the way. The first-class carriages are divided into six&nbsp;compartments, providing seats for forty-eight passengers. The&nbsp;second and third class carriages have eight compartments, holding altogether eighty passengers in each. These carriages weigh&nbsp;13 tons each.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The waggon stock of the Midland Railway is of several classes. All the standard goods and mineral waggons, as well as cattle-waggons, are constructed to carry 8 tons. Leading dimensions,&nbsp;weights, and prices are given below in Table XXXI. :—</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>

The high-sided waggons are made with a doorway and&nbsp;hinged door in each side, and two trap-doors in the bottom. In&nbsp;the low-sided waggons each side is a door for its whole length.&nbsp;The cattle-waggons are made with doorways in each side, to each&nbsp;of which there are two doors hinged to each doorpost, and a letting-down door hinged to the lower side-rail.

Thirty gas-lights in a train are supplied from two&nbsp;reservoirs or gasholders in the brake-vans, which hold 200 cubic&nbsp;feet of ordinary coal-gas, supplied from the mains,—enough to serve&nbsp;the train for from two hours to two and a half hours.

<p><span class="font1">wheeled carriages are (1885) being gradually superseded by sixwheeled and long bogie carriages. Four varieties of bogie carriage and three varieties of six-wheeled carriage are constructed for the&nbsp;service. First-class compartments are constructed to seat six&nbsp;persons, three on each side; third-class compartments seat ten&nbsp;persons, five on each side. A uniform width of 8 feet outside, or&nbsp;7½ inside, is adopted for all carriages; and, as a rule, first-class&nbsp;compartments are 7¼ feet long between the partitions, and third-class compartments 6 feet long. The roof is 7 feet 4 inches above&nbsp;the floor at the centre, and the clear height of the doorway is 6&nbsp;feet. The wheels are 3 feet 7½ inches in diameter.

<p><span class="font1">to each compartment. Ordinary coal-gas has also been used on the metropolitan railways. Pintsch’s system of lighting carriages by&nbsp;compressed oil-gas is extensively in use on Continental railways,&nbsp;where it has been in operation for upw<sup>τ</sup>ards of ten years. In&nbsp;1876-77 the system was tried successfully on the Metropolitan&nbsp;Railway, when it appeared that 1000 cubic feet of the compressed&nbsp;gas could do the work of 6500 cubic feet of coal-gas, at a cost of&nbsp;scarcely one farthing per burner per hour, against one-third of a&nbsp;penny for coal-gas lamps, and from ½d. to ¾d. for oil-lamps. The&nbsp;gas is distilled from cheap oils, as the waste - products from the&nbsp;manufacture of paraffin, soft lignite, or shale. The gas is pumped&nbsp;from the gasholder into reservoirs, in which it is compressed to&nbsp;about one-tenth of its ordinary volume. From these it is drawn off&nbsp;into a reservoir stowed under each carriage at a pressure of six&nbsp;atmospheres, or 90 lb per square inch. The Pintsch system is in&nbsp;use on railways in England and Scotland on nearly 3000 vehicles,&nbsp;and is being extended to other stock ; the number of vehicles thus&nbsp;lighted in all the railways of Europe is about 18,000. Besides, the&nbsp;system is employed for the head-lights of locomotives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Intercommunication signals for railway trains are provided between driver and guard, driver and passengers, or passengers&nbsp;and guard. Electric means of communication have been proposed&nbsp;and tried, but mechanical appliances are most commonly employed.&nbsp;There is the ordinary guard’s cord, extending along the train outside, placed so as to be accessible from the window ; then there are&nbsp;the same cord, with an attachment coming inside the window, the&nbsp;English cord, connected with a bell in the driving cab, a line inside&nbsp;the carriage connected with the steam-whistle, and so on. The&nbsp;acoustic signals appear to belong to the last type ; but none of these&nbsp;systems is comparable with the through middle passage of the&nbsp;American cars already noticed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Continuous Brakes.—</span><span class="font1">No department of railway practice has in recent years received closer attention and more minute study than&nbsp;that of continuous brakes,—brakes applied to the several vehicles&nbsp;in a train. With the amount of brake-power that had for many&nbsp;years been supplied to passenger trains—hand-brakes on tenders&nbsp;and guards’ vans—a train running at from 45 to 50 miles per hour&nbsp;on a straight level line could not be pulled up within from 800 to&nbsp;1200 yards ; and even that inadequate amount of brake-power was&nbsp;in the hands of several men. It was clear that the problem of&nbsp;arresting a train in the shortest distance could only be solved by&nbsp;bringing a power to bear on every part of the train in the shortest&nbsp;possible time. But the difficulty consisted in establishing continuity of action, so that the engine-driver or the guard should be&nbsp;enabled to apply the brake-blocks on a series of vehicles in one&nbsp;operation. Mechanical means were first tried, in the systems of&nbsp;Fay and Newall, in which the brakes are worked by a continuous&nbsp;rod passed under the vehicles. These systems were found to be&nbsp;available only on sections of not more than four or five vehicles,&nbsp;and were not worked by the driver but by the guard. In September&nbsp;1858 a circular was issued by the Board of Trade to the railway&nbsp;companies, calling attention to the advantages to be derived from&nbsp;having their trains controlled by a sufficient amount of brake-power.&nbsp;Subsequently many inventions were tried,—brakes worked by fluid&nbsp;pressure, others worked by chains ; but no practical solution of the&nbsp;problem appears to have been arrived at until Mr Westinghouse&nbsp;of Pittsburgh, U.S.A., invented a really continuous brake worked&nbsp;by compressed air, which was quickly adopted in the United States,&nbsp;and was tried a few years later on several railways in England.&nbsp;It is still (1885) employed exclusively on the Metropolitan District&nbsp;Railway.</span></p>
