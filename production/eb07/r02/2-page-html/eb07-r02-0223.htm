These holes are&nbsp;seen in the detached front-view of the&nbsp;plate at B. Immediately behind the plate&nbsp;the yarns are passed through the press-blocks, one of which is figured detached&nbsp;at C. They are then hung on the hooks of the sledge </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">cc.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">These hooks are on the prolonged axes of pinions driven by&nbsp;a spur-wheel </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">d,</span><span class="font0"> which again is driven by the mitred wheel&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e.</span><span class="font0"> This wheel can be connected with either of the wheels</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">f&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">g,</span><span class="font0"> by means of a clutch wrought by the lever A.

<p><span class="font0">ROQUE, Sτ, a city of Spain, in the province of Seville, and the partido of Gibraltar. It is about six miles from&nbsp;the latter fortress, and the first place beyond the Spanish&nbsp;lines. It stands on an elevated spot, commanding a view&nbsp;of the rock of Gibraltar. It contains about 1800 inhabitants, exclusive of the troops. There is'another town of&nbsp;the same name, with the addition of De Rumiera, in the district of Montania, in the province of Burgos, on the river&nbsp;Miera, containing 1250 inhabitants.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rosa, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Salvator,</span><span class="font0"> an admirable painter, was born at Naples in 1614. He was first instructed by Francesco Francazano,&nbsp;a kinsman ; but the death of his father reduced him to sell&nbsp;drawings sketched upon paper for any thing he could get.&nbsp;One of these happening to fall into the hands of Lanfranc,&nbsp;he took him under his protection, and enabled him to enter&nbsp;the school of Spagnoletto, and to be taught by Daniel&nbsp;Falcone, a distinguished painter of battles at Naples. His&nbsp;pieces are exceedingly scarce and valuable ; one of the&nbsp;best of them being that representing Saul and the witch of&nbsp;Endor, which was preserved at Versailles. He died in 1673 ;&nbsp;and as his paintings are in few hands, he is more generally&nbsp;known by his prints, of which he etched a great number.&nbsp;He painted landscapes more than history ; but his prints&nbsp;are chiefly historical. The principal landscape of this master is a noble picture at Chiswick. We are told that he&nbsp;spent the early part of his life in a troop of banditti ; and&nbsp;that the rocky desolate scenes in which he was accustomed&nbsp;to take refuge, furnished him with those romantic ideas in&nbsp;landscape, of which he is so exceedingly fond, and in the&nbsp;description of which he so greatly excels. His robbers, as&nbsp;his detached figures are commonly called, are supposed also&nbsp;to have been taken from the life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Amongst the musical manuscripts purchased at Rome by Dr Burney, was a music-book of Salvator, in which are&nbsp;many airs and cantatas of different masters, and eight entire&nbsp;cantatas, written, set, and transcribed by this celebrated&nbsp;painter himself.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">ROSAMOND, daughter of Walter Lord Clifford, was a young lady of exquisite beauty. The popular story of her is&nbsp;as follows. Henry II. saw her, loved her, declared his passion, and triumphed over her honour. To avoid the jealousy of his queen Elinor, he kept her in a wonderful labyrinth at Woodstock ; and by his connection with her had&nbsp;William Longsword earl of Salisbury, and Geoffrey bishop&nbsp;of Lincoln. On Henry’s absence in France, however, on&nbsp;account of a rebellion in that country, the queen found&nbsp;means to discover her; and, though struck with her beauty,&nbsp;she recalled sufficient resentment to poison her. The queen,&nbsp;it is said, discovered her apartment by a thread of silk ; but&nbsp;how she came by it is differently related. This popular&nbsp;story is not however supported by history. She was buried&nbsp;in the church of Godstow, opposite to the high altar, where&nbsp;her body remained till it was ordered to be removed with&nbsp;every mark of disgrace by Hugh bishop of Lincoln in 1191.&nbsp;She was, however, considered as a saint after her death.</span></p>
