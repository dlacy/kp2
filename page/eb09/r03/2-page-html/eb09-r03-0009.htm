                but rather announcements or advertisements of what remedy he&nbsp;would grant in
                such and such circumstances, or direct orders to do&nbsp;or prohibitions against
                doing certain things. A party claiming an&nbsp;action or whatever else it might be
                under any of them did so not&nbsp;of right, as he would have done had his claim had
                a statutory&nbsp;or customary foundation, but of grace,—on the strength of
                the&nbsp;praetor’s promise to grant him what he claimed and make the
                grant&nbsp;effectual. That was why originally such an action had to be
                raised&nbsp;and concluded within the particular praetor’s year of office,—a
                rule&nbsp;which in time, by abuse, was converted into the somewhat
                different&nbsp;one that a purely praetorian action </span><span class="font1"

                raised within a year of the occurrence to which it referred.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">As already observed, the praetors’ edicts proceeded to a greater
                extent than the earlier legislation of the comitia upon lines of&nbsp;equity; that
                is to say, they set themselves against the strictness&nbsp;and formalism of the
                jurisprudence of the XII. Tables. Such&nbsp;may be said to have been the general
                tendency of the edicts as a&nbsp;whole. But it was the tendency of the whole
                jurisprudence of the&nbsp;time, and by no means peculiar to the praetorian creation.
                Nowhere&nbsp;in the texts are the praetors spoken of as the mouthpieces of
                equity&nbsp;as distinguished from law. Such a distinction recurs frequently
                in&nbsp;Cicero ; he identifies </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
                >aequitas</span><span class="font1"> with the spirit of a law or agreement,&nbsp;and

                with its letter, but it is in order to sing the praises not of&nbsp;the praetors but
                of the pleaders who maintained the former as against&nbsp;the latter, and of the
                judges who were persuaded by their arguments.&nbsp;Much of what was contained in the
                </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Edict</span><span
                class="font1"> might quite as well have&nbsp;been embodied in statute, and we know
                that in time statute came&nbsp;to its aid ; witness a very remarkable provision of
                it,—“ I will give&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bonorum
                posscssio</span><span class="font1"> as may be enjoined by statute, whether
                comitial&nbsp;enactment or senatusconsult.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Of the edicts of the peregrin praetor and their relation to that of
                his urban colleague little is known. That they differed in some&nbsp;respects there
                can be no doubt, for in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
                >Lex Rubria</span><span class="font1"> (of 706 ?)&nbsp;for settling the government
                of Cisalpine Gaul the magistrates are&nbsp;directed, with reference to a certain
                action, to formulate it in the&nbsp;way prescribed in the edict of the peregrin
                praetor. The latter,&nbsp;therefore, must to some extent have been in advance of
                that of&nbsp;the urban praetor, probably in this respect, that, being
                prepared&nbsp;primarily for the regulation of questions affecting non-citizens,
                it&nbsp;more thoroughly than the other avoided formalities that were competent only
                to citizens, and thus to a greater extent simplified procedure. The edicts of the
                provincial governors must have varied&nbsp;according to circumstances, being in all
                cases composites of provisions, more or less numerous, borrowed from the edicts of
                the&nbsp;praetors and additions suggested by the peculiar wants of
                the&nbsp;different provinces for which they were framed </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">(provinciate genus&nbsp;edicendi).</span><span
                class="font1"> As for those of the curule aediles, who amongst other&nbsp;duties
                were charged with the supervision of markets, their range&nbsp;was very limited,
                their most important provisions having reference&nbsp;to open sales of slaves,
                horses, and cattle, and containing regulations about the duties of vendors exposing
                them, and their responsibility for latent faults and vices.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Consuetude, Professional Jurisprudence,
                and Res Judicatae.—</span><span class="font1">Great as may be the difficulty
                experienced by philosophical jurists in defining the ground of the authority of
                consuetudinary law, there is&nbsp;no room to dispute the importance of its
                contributions to every&nbsp;system of jurisprudence ancient and modern. The men who
                first&nbsp;drew, accepted, and endorsed a bill of exchange did as much for&nbsp;the
                law as any lawgiver has ever accomplished. They may or may&nbsp;not have acted on
                the advice of jurists ; but, whether or not, they&nbsp;began a practice which grew
                into custom, and as such was recognized by the tribunals as a law-creating one,—one
                conferring rights&nbsp;and imposing obligations. There is much of this—far more
                probably&nbsp;than is commonly imagined—in the history of every system of
                law.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">In Rome the process was sometimes wonderfully expeditious ; witness
                what Justinian narrates of the introduction and recognition&nbsp;of testamentary
                trusts and of codicils to last wills, both in the time&nbsp;of Augustus. It can
                hardly be doubted that the literal contract&nbsp;</span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">per expensilationem</span><span class="font1"> originated
                in the same way, probably in the&nbsp;end of the 5th or the beginning of the 6th
                century. The keeping&nbsp;of domestic account-books may have been enjoined and
                enforced&nbsp;by the censors ; but it was custom, and neither statute nor
                praetor’s&nbsp;edict, that made an entry in them to another person’s debit
                creative&nbsp;of a claim against the latter </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">ior certa pecunia crcdita,</span><span class="font1">
                that might be&nbsp;made effectual by an action under the Silian law. It must
                have&nbsp;been in exactly the same way that </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">mutuum,</span><span class="font1"> formless loan of

                >and to be held recoverable under the same action. True, this could&nbsp;not have
                been attained without the co-operation of the courts. But&nbsp;then those courts
                were composed each of a single private citizen,&nbsp;whose office ended with his
                judgment in the particular case remitted&nbsp;to him, and who was untrammelled by
                the authority of any </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"

        <p><span class="font1">expensilation or formless loan created such an obligation as was

                divergent practice, contradictory findings, as&nbsp;Cicero says there were in his
                day upon the question whether </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
                >aequitas</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">jus strictum</span><span class="font1"> was to be applied
                to the determination of certain&nbsp;matters ; but the gradual ascendency and
                eventual unanimity of&nbsp;judicial opinion in the affirmative was but the
                expression of the&nbsp;general sentiment of the citizens, of whom the </span><span
                class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">judiccs</span><span class="font1"> were
                the&nbsp;representatives.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">These are but examples of the way in which consuetudinary law was
                constructed. It required the combined action of the laity and&nbsp;the </span><span
                class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">judiccs,</span><span class="font1"> both at
                times acting under professional advice; in&nbsp;some cases even that of the praetors
                was necessary. It would have&nbsp;been impossible, for instance, to have introduced
                the consensual&nbsp;contracts into the Roman system and determined what were
                the&nbsp;obligations they imposed on either side, without magisterial cooperation in
                framing the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
                >formulae</span><span class="font1"> that were to be submitted to&nbsp;the judges.
                Taking the action on sale as an illustration, the formula&nbsp;substantially was
                this :—“ It being averred that the defendant sold&nbsp;such or such a thing to the
                plaintiff, whatever, judge, it shall appear that the defendant ought in good faith
                to give to or do for&nbsp;the plaintiff in respect thereof, in the money equivalent
                thereof&nbsp;condemn the defendant; otherwise, acquit him.” It is very manifest that
                the free hand here given to the judge must immensely&nbsp;have facilitated the
                reception of customary doctrine into the law.&nbsp;The judge was to a great extent
                the spokesman of the forum ; his&nbsp;judgment was formed in accordance with current
                public opinion,&nbsp;which he had ample opportunity of gauging; it was the
                reflexion&nbsp;of that general sentiment of right, which, phrase it how we
                may,&nbsp;is the real basis of all customary law. And so in an action
                for&nbsp;establishing a right of property in a </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">res nec mancipi.</span><span class="font1"> The
                formula&nbsp;was very simple :—“ If it appear that such or such a thing
                belongs&nbsp;to the plaintiff in quiritary right, then, judge, whatever be
                its&nbsp;value for the plaintiff, in that condemn the defendant; should
                it&nbsp;appear otherwise, acquit him.” The primary duty of a judge on&nbsp;such a
                remit was to determine whether the title on which the&nbsp;plaintiff founded his
                pretensions gave him a right that came up to&nbsp;property; and it can hardly be
                disputed that it was by the decisions&nbsp;of a series of judges, in a series of
                such actions, that the long list&nbsp;of natural modes of acquiring property given
                by Justinian under&nbsp;technical names was gradually brought into view. Those
                decisions,&nbsp;whether upon the obligations of a vendor, direct or indirect,
                or&nbsp;upon the sufficiency of a title founded on by a party averring a&nbsp;right
                of property by natural acquisition, may in many cases have&nbsp;been arrived at
                under professional advice, and were in all cases&nbsp;embodied in judgments. But
                that does not in the least deprive&nbsp;the doctrine deduced from them of its
                character of customary law.&nbsp;It was not until the empire that the opinions of
                the jurists submitted to a judge </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">(responsa prudentium,</span><span class="font1"> see p.
                705) were invested&nbsp;with quasi-legislative authority. During the republic, if a
                judge&nbsp;deferred to them, it was simply because he regarded them as
                in&nbsp;consonance with well-qualified public opinion ; and what a series&nbsp;of
                consistent judgments </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">of this
                sort</span><span class="font1"> built up was in the strictest&nbsp;sense a law based
                on consuetude.@@<sup>2</sup></span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">As regards the professional jurists in particular it has already been
                observed that, according to the testimony of the historians,&nbsp;the law was a
                monopoly of the patricians down at least to the&nbsp;middle of the 5th century of
                the city. Livy goes so far as to&nbsp;speak of it as </span><span class="font1"

                class="font1">among the&nbsp;secrets of the pontifical college. It was so to a very
                great extent&nbsp;in the regal period. But after the publication of the XII.
                Tables&nbsp;this could be the case only in a qualified sense, the pontiffs becoming
                the official interpreters of that which in the letter was patent&nbsp;to the world.
