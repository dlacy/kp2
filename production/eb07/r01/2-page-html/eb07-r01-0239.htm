<p><span class="font0">RIDEAU, in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Fortification,</span><span class="font0"> a small elevation of earth, extending itself lengthwise on a plain, serving to cover a&nbsp;camp or give an advantage in a post.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RIDICULE, in matters of literature, is that species of writing which excites contempt with laughter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ridiculous,</span><span class="font0"> says Lord Kames, differs from the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">risible. </span><span class="font0">A risible object produces an emotion of laughter merely ;&nbsp;a ridiculous object is improper as well as risible, and produces a mixed emotion, which is vented by a laugh of derision or scorn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Burlesque, though a great engine of ridicule, is not confined to that subject ; for it is clearly distinguishable into burlesque that excites laughter merely, and burlesque that&nbsp;provokes derision or ridicule. A grave subject in which&nbsp;there is no impropriety, may be brought down by a certain&nbsp;colouring so as to be risible ; which is the case of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Virgil&nbsp;Travestie,</span><span class="font0"> and also the case of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Secchia Rapita;</span><span class="font0"> the&nbsp;authors laugh first, in order to make their readers laugh.&nbsp;The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lutrin</span><span class="font0"> is a burlesque poem of the other sort, laying&nbsp;hold of a low and trifling incident, to expose the luxury,&nbsp;indolence, and contentious spirit of a set of monks. Boileau, the author, gives a ridiculous air to the subject, by&nbsp;dressing it in the heroic style, and affecting to consider it&nbsp;as of the utmost dignity and importance. In a compositiori&nbsp;of this kind, no image professedly ludicrous ought to find&nbsp;quarter, because such images destroy the contrast ; and accordingly the author shows always the grave face, and never&nbsp;once betrays a smile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Though the burlesque that aims at ridicule produces its effects by elevating the style far above the subject, yet it&nbsp;has limits beyond which tbe elevation ought not to be carried. The poet, consulting the imagination of his readers,&nbsp;ought to confine himself to such images as are lively and&nbsp;readily apprehended ; a strained elevation, soaring above&nbsp;an ordinary reach of fancy, makes not a pleasant impression. The reader, fatigued with being always upon the&nbsp;stretch, is soon disgusted ; and if he persevere, becomes&nbsp;thoughtless and indifferent. Further, a fiction gives no&nbsp;pleasure unless it be painted in colours so lively as to produce some perception of reality ; which never can be done&nbsp;effectually where the images are formed with labour or&nbsp;difficulty. For these reasons, we cannot avoid condemning&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Batrachomyomachia,</span><span class="font0"> said to be the composition of Homer : it is beyond the power of imagination to form a&nbsp;clear and lively image of frogs and mice acting with the&nbsp;dignity of the highest of our species ; nor can we form a&nbsp;conception of the reality of such an action, in any manner&nbsp;so distinct as to interest our affections even in the slightest&nbsp;degree.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Rape of the Lock is of a character clearly distinguishable from those now mentioned ; it is not properly a burlesque performance, but what may rather be termed </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">an&nbsp;heroi-cοmical poem ;</span><span class="font0"> it treats a gay and familiar subject&nbsp;with pleasantry, and with a moderate degree of dignity.&nbsp;The author puts not on a mask like Boileau, nor professes&nbsp;to make us laugh like Tassoni. The Rape of the Lock is&nbsp;a genteel species of writing, less strained than those mentioned ; and is pleasant or ludicrous without having ridicule&nbsp;for its chief aim ; giving way, however, to ridicule, where it&nbsp;naturally arises from a particular character, such as that of&nbsp;Sir Plume.</span></p><h2><a name="caption1"></a><span class="font1">Those who have a talent for ridicule, which is seldom</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">united with a taste for delicate and refined beauties, are quick-sighted in improprieties ; and these they eagerly grasp,&nbsp;in order to gratify their favourite propensity. Persons galled&nbsp;are provoked to maintain that ridicule is improper for grave&nbsp;subjects. Subjects really grave are by no means fit for&nbsp;ridicule ; but then it is urged against them, that, when called in question whether a certain subject be really grave, ridicule is the only means of determining the controversy.&nbsp;Hence a celebrated question, whether ridicule be or be not&nbsp;a test of truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On one side it is observed that the objects of ridicule are falsehood, incongruity, impropriety, or turpitude of certain kinds ; but as the object of every excited passion must&nbsp;be examined by reason before we can determine whether&nbsp;it be proper or improper, so ridicule must, apparently at&nbsp;least, establish the truth of the improprieties designed to&nbsp;excite the passion of contempt. Hence it comes in aid of&nbsp;argument and reason, when its impressions on the imagination are consistent with the nature of things ; but when it&nbsp;strikes the fancy and affections with fictitious images, it becomes the instrument of deceit. But however ridicule may&nbsp;impress the idea of apparent turpitude or falsehood in the&nbsp;imagination, yet still reason remains the supreme judge;&nbsp;and thus ridicule can never be the final test or touchstone&nbsp;of truth and falsehood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On the other side, it is contended that ridicule is not a subject of reasoning, but of sense or taste. Stating the&nbsp;question, then, in more accurate terms, whether the sense&nbsp;of ridicule be the proper test for distinguishing ridiculous&nbsp;objects from what are not so, they proceed thus. No person doubts that our sense of beauty is the true test of what&nbsp;is beautiful ; and our sense of grandeur, of what is great or&nbsp;sublime. Is it more doubtful whether our sense of ridicule&nbsp;be the true test of what is ridiculous ? It is not only the&nbsp;true test, but indeed the only test ; for this subject comes&nbsp;not, more than beauty or grandeur, under the province of&nbsp;reason. If any subject, by the influence of fashion or custom, have acquired a degree of veneration to which it is&nbsp;not naturally entitled, what are the proper means for wiping&nbsp;off the artificial colouring, and displaying the subject in its&nbsp;true light ? A man of true taste sees the subject without the&nbsp;disguise ; but if we hesitate, let him apply the test of ridicule, which separates it from its artificial connections, and&nbsp;exposes it naked with all its native improprieties.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Riding, in naval affairs, is the state of a ship’s being retained in a particular station, by means of one or more cables with their anchors, which are for this purpose sunk into the&nbsp;bottom of the sea, &amp;c. in order to prevent the vessel from&nbsp;being driven at the mercy of the wind or current. A rope&nbsp;is said to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ride,</span><span class="font0"> when one of the turns by which it is wound&nbsp;about the capstern or windlass lies over another, so as to&nbsp;interrupt the operation of heaving.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Riding </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">between the Wind and Tide,</span><span class="font0"> the situation of a vessel at anchor, when the wind and tide act upon her in&nbsp;direct opposition, in such a manner as to destroy the effort&nbsp;of each other upon her hull ; so that she is in a manner&nbsp;balanced between their reciprocal force, and rides without&nbsp;the least strain on her cables. When a ship does not labour&nbsp;heavily, or feel a great strain when anchored in an open&nbsp;road or bay, she is said to ride easy. On the contrary, when&nbsp;she pitches violently into the sea, so as to strain her cables,&nbsp;masts, or hull, it is called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">riding hard,</span><span class="font0"> and the vessel is&nbsp;termed a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">bad roader.</span></p>
