<p><span class="font0">intended for the core pass. This core is of such a size that the aggregate number of wires that are mounted in the machine exactly&nbsp;cover it in a spiral direction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">All the wires, including the centre core, are passed through their individual hollow spindles, then led to the nose or head of the machine,&nbsp;and finally passed through a stationary compression block to drawoff wheels. The speed of these wheels is regulated in proportion&nbsp;to the speed of the machine by means of suitable gearing. During&nbsp;the revolutions of the machine each bobbin and fork is kept in a&nbsp;vertical position, and floats thus, by means of an eccentric ring&nbsp;behind the back disk. This ring is connected to the spindles of the&nbsp;bobbin forks by means of small cranks, thus preventing any torsional&nbsp;movement that would otherwise be imparted to the individual&nbsp;wires.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Each bobbin is controlled by a brake which acts as a tensioning device so that equal strain can be applied to each, allowing the&nbsp;wires to unwind uniformly. The finished strands are wound in&nbsp;turn upon large bobbins, and mounted in the flyers or disks.of the&nbsp;rope closing machine. These machines are similar in design to&nbsp;the stranding machine, but are naturally much heavier in construction, and therefore revolve at a proportionate speed. The speed&nbsp;of the machines varies according to the weight of material, the&nbsp;size of the strands and the construction of the finished rope. The&nbsp;modern machine, or the type most generally used, makes about&nbsp;fifty revolutions per.minute, whilst three times this speed is often&nbsp;obtained when spinning the strands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The rapid strides made by electricity have furnished another large branch of what may be termed wire rope manufacture. The&nbsp;ropes used for electrical purposes are almost invariably termed&nbsp;cables, and there are many different kinds and sizes of them. The&nbsp;wire must necessarily possess good conducting power, and be comparatively cheap. Up to the present, copper has proved to be the&nbsp;chief material possessing these two important properties in combination ; hence it is the metal </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">par excellence</span><span class="font0"> for electrical conduction.&nbsp;Aluminium and alloys have been tried with varying degrees of&nbsp;success.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The conductor itself consists of a strand of soft copper wires, around which the dielectric or non-conducting material is placed.&nbsp;The methods of forming the strands do not differ essentially from&nbsp;those described above. The dielectric is usually paper, spun jute&nbsp;fibre, vulcanized india-rubber or vulcanized bitumen. If the first&nbsp;two dielectrics are used, a lead sheath is necessary to enclose the&nbsp;insulated strand and so exclude moisture; if the cable is likely&nbsp;to get damaged, it is further enclosed by steel tapes or steel wires,&nbsp;and finally covered with, yarn or braid. Vulcanized bitumen is&nbsp;not only a dielectric, but is also absolutely impervious to moisture.&nbsp;Hence in many instances where paper or fibre is employed.as the&nbsp;principal dielectric, a sheath of vulcanized bitumen is used instead&nbsp;of lead to exclude moisture. Cables are also made with a single&nbsp;central stand of copper wires in addition to one or more concentric&nbsp;layers of copper wires, the layers being separated by some dielectric&nbsp;material; or there may be two or more strands, separately insulated,&nbsp;and more or less elaborately clothed with the above-mentioned&nbsp;substances.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(T.

<p><span class="font0">ROPES, JOHN CODMAN (1836-1899), American military historian and lawyer, was born at St Petersburg on the 28th of&nbsp;April 1836, the son of a leading merchant of Boston who was&nbsp;engaged in business in Russia. At the age of fourteen, his family&nbsp;having meantime returned to Massachusetts, he developed an&nbsp;affection of the spine which eventually became a permanent&nbsp;deformity. His courage and energy, however, did not allow&nbsp;him to yield to his affliction. He entered Harvard in 1853, and&nbsp;graduated in 1857. His interests as a young man were chiefly&nbsp;religious, legal and historical, and these remained with him&nbsp;throughout life, his career as a lawyer being conspicuous and&nbsp;successful. But it was the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861&nbsp;which fixed his attention principally on military history. He&nbsp;ceaselessly assisted with business and personal help anti friendship the officers and men of the 20th Massachusetts regiment, in&nbsp;which his brother, Henry Ropes, served up to his death at&nbsp;Gettysburg, and after the war he devoted himself to the collection and elucidation of all obtainable evidence as to its incidents&nbsp;and events. In this work his clear and unprejudiced legal&nbsp;mind enabled him to sift the truth from the innumerable public&nbsp;and private controversies, and the ill-informed allotment of&nbsp;praise and blame by the popular historians and biographers.&nbsp;The focus of his work was the Military Historical Society of&nbsp;Massachusetts, which he founded in 1876. The work of this&nbsp;society was the collection and discussion of evidence relating&nbsp;to the great conflict. Although practically every member of&nbsp;this society except himself had fought through the war, and&nbsp;many, such as Hancock and W. F. Smith, were general officers&nbsp;of great distinction, it was from first to last maintained and&nbsp;guided by Ropes, who presented to it his military library&nbsp;and his collection of prints and medals. He died at Boston&nbsp;on the 28th of October 1899. His principal work is an&nbsp;unfinished </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Story of the Civil War,</span><span class="font0"> to which he devoted most&nbsp;of his later years; this covers the years 1861-62. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Army&nbsp;under Pope</span><span class="font0"> is a detailed narration of the Virginia campaign of&nbsp;August-September 1862, which played a great part in reversing&nbsp;contemporary judgment on the events of those operations,&nbsp;notably as regards the unjustly-condemned General Fitz John&nbsp;Porter. Outside America, Ropes is known chiefly as the author&nbsp;of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Campaign of Waterloo,</span><span class="font0"> which is one of the standard&nbsp;works on the subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The greater part of his studies of the Civil War appears in the Military Historical Society’s publications. Papers on the Waterloo&nbsp;campaign appeared in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Atlantic Monthly</span><span class="font0"> of June 1881, and in&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Scrioner's Magazine</span><span class="font0"> of March and April 1888. Amongst his miscellaneous works is a paper on “ The Likenesses of Julius Caesar ”&nbsp;in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Scribner's Magazine</span><span class="font0"> (February 1887).</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">ROPE-WALKING, the art of walking, dancing and performing tricks of equilibrium on a rope or wire stretched between two supports. It has been popular with most Asiatic and&nbsp;European peoples from the beginning of history. Before the&nbsp;middle of the 19th century a rope was invariably used, and&nbsp;was stretched as tightly as possible, on which account the art&nbsp;was called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Tight-rope Walking.</span><span class="font0"> About the year 1875 the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">slack&nbsp;wire,</span><span class="font0"> stretched loosely from support to support, was introduced,&nbsp;and is now more commonly used. The performer is often&nbsp;aided in keeping his balance by a Chinese umbrella or a long&nbsp;pole.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROPS, FÉLICIEN (1833-1898), Belgian paintei, designer and engraver, was born at Namur, in Belgium, on the 7th of July&nbsp;1833; he spent his childhood in that town, and afterwards&nbsp;in Brussels, where he composed in 1856, for his friends at the&nbsp;university, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Almanach Crocodilien,</span><span class="font0"> his first piece of work.&nbsp;He also bi ought out two </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Salons Illustrés,</span><span class="font0"> and collaborated on the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Crocodile,</span><span class="font0"> a magazine produced by the students. The humour&nbsp;shown in his contributions attracted the attention of publishers,&nbsp;who offered him work. He designed, among other things,&nbsp;frontispieces for Poulet-Malassis, and afterwards for Gay and&nbsp;Douce. In 1859 he began to contribute to a satirical journal&nbsp;in Brussels called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Uylenspiegel</span><span class="font0">, a sort of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Charivari.</span><span class="font0"> The issue,&nbsp;limited unfortunately to two years, included his finest lithographs. About 1862 he went to Paris and worked at Jacque-mait’s. He subsequently returned to Brussels, where be&nbsp;founded the short-lived International Society of Etchers. In&nbsp;1865 he brought out his famous “ Buveuse d’Absinthe,” which&nbsp;placed him in the foremost rank of Belgian engravers; and in&nbsp;1871 the “ Dame au Pantin/’ After 1874 Rops resided in&nbsp;Paris. His talent, which commanded attention by its novel&nbsp;methods of expression, and had been stimulated by travels&nbsp;in Hungary, Holland and Norway, whence he brought back&nbsp;characteristic sketches, now took a soaring flight. To say&nbsp;nothing of the six hundred original engravings enumerated in&nbsp;Ramiro’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Catalogue of Rops’ Engraved Work</span><span class="font0"> (Paris, Conquet,&nbsp;1887), and one hundred and eighty from lithographs (Ramiro’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Catalogue of Rops<sup>1</sup> Lithographs,</span><span class="font0"> Paris, Conquet, 1891), besides a&nbsp;large number of oil-paintings in the manner of Courbet, and of&nbsp;pencil or pen-and-ink drawings, he executed several very remarkable water-colour pictures, among which are “ Le Scandale,”&nbsp;1876; “ Une Attrapade,” 1877 (now in the Brussels Museum);&nbsp;a “Tentation de St Antoine,” 1878; and “ Pornocrates,”&nbsp;1878. Most of these have been engraved and printed in colours&nbsp;by Bertrand. From r88o to 1890 he devoted himself principally&nbsp;to illustrating books</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Les Rimes de joie,</span><span class="font0"> by Théo Hannon;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Le Vice suprême</span><span class="font0"> and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by J.
