<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">range extends over the whole of the United States, and stretches on the west northwards to Alaska and southwards</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">well into Central America, where it attains its maximum size. The following notes on the habits of the raccoon&nbsp;are extracted from Dr C. Hart Merriam’s charming work&nbsp;on the mammals of the Adirondacks (N. E. New York).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“Raccoons are omnivorous beasts and feed upon mice, small birds, birds’ eggs, turtles and their eggs, frogs, fish, crayfish,&nbsp;molluscs, insects, nuts, fruits, maize, and sometimes poultry.&nbsp;Excepting alone the bats and flying-squirrels, they are the most&nbsp;strictly nocturnal of all our mammals, and yet I have several times&nbsp;seen them abroad on cloudy days. They haunt the banks of ponds&nbsp;and streams, and find much of their food in these places, such as&nbsp;crayfish, mussels, and fish, although they are unable to dive and&nbsp;pursue the latter under water, like the otter and mink. They are&nbsp;good swimmers and do not hesitate to cross livers that lie in their&nbsp;path. . . . The raccoon hibernates during the severest part of the&nbsp;winter, retiring to its nest rather early, and appearing again in&nbsp;February or March, according to the earliness or lateness of the&nbsp;season. It makes its home high up in the hollow of some large&nbsp;tree, preferring a dead limb to the trunk itself. It does little&nbsp;in the way of constructing a nest, and from four to six young are&nbsp;commonly born at a time, generally early in April in this region.&nbsp;The young remain with the mother about a year.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The South-American species, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Procyon cancrivorus</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">, the crab-eating raccoon, is very similar to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">P. lotor</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">, but differs&nbsp;by its much shorter fur, larger size, proportionally more&nbsp;powerful teeth, and other minor characters. It extends&nbsp;over the whole of South America, as far south as the&nbsp;Rio Negro, and is very common in all suitable localities.&nbsp;Its habits are similar to those of the North-American&nbsp;species.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">RACHEL (1820 or 1821-1858), the stage name of a French actress, whose true name was </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Elizabeth Félix,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">and who was the daughter of Jacob Félix and Esther Haya,&nbsp;Alsatian Jews, who travelled on foot through France as&nbsp;pedlars. She was born according to one account on 24th&nbsp;March 1820, according to another on 28th February of&nbsp;the following year, in a small inn in Mumpf in the canton&nbsp;of Aargau, Switzerland. At Rheims she and her eldest&nbsp;sister Sophia, afterwards known as Sarah, joined a troupe&nbsp;of Italian children who made their living by singing in&nbsp;the cafés, Sarah taking part in the singing and Elizabeth,&nbsp;then only four years of age, collecting the coppers. In&nbsp;1830 they came to Paris, where they sang in the streets,&nbsp;Rachel giving such patriotic songs as the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Parisienne</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> and&nbsp;the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Marseillaise</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> with a rude but precocious energy which&nbsp;evoked special admiration and an abundant shower of&nbsp;coppers. Choron, a famous teacher of singing, was so impressed with the talents of the two sisters that he undertook to give them gratuitous instruction, and after his&nbsp;death in 1833 they were received into the Conservatoire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Sophia gained a medal for singing, but Rachel at an early period gave her chief attention to elocution and acting.&nbsp;Her voice, though deep and powerful, was at first hard&nbsp;and inflexible ; and her thin and meagre appearance conveyed an impression of insignificance, which her plain&nbsp;features and generally impassive manner tended to confirm.&nbsp;It was only her remarkable intelligence that encouraged her&nbsp;instructors to persevere ; but even they did not recognize&nbsp;her talents as exceptional. She made her first appearance&nbsp;at the Gymnase in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vendéenne</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> in 1837 with only mediocre success. On 12th June of the following year she&nbsp;succeeded, after great difficulty, in making a début at the&nbsp;Théâtre Français, appearing as Camille in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Les Horaces</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">, when,&nbsp;attention having been directed to her remarkable genius by&nbsp;Jules Janin in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Débats</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> and Madame de Girardin in the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Presse,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> it at once received universal recognition. Her range&nbsp;of characters was limited, but within this range she was&nbsp;unsurpassable. It was especially in the tragedies of Racine&nbsp;and Corneille that she excelled, and more particularly in&nbsp;the impersonation of evil or malignant passion. By careful training her originally hard and harsh voice had become&nbsp;flexible and melodious, and its low and muffled notes under&nbsp;the influence of passion possessed a thrilling and penetrating quality that was irresistible. When excited her plain&nbsp;features became transfigured by the glow of genius, and in&nbsp;her impersonations of evil and malignant emotions there&nbsp;was a majesty and dignity which fascinated whilst it repelled. Her facial elocution was unsurpassable in variety&nbsp;and expressiveness, whilst the grace of her gestures and the&nbsp;marvellous skill with which she varied her tones with every&nbsp;shade of thought and emotion were completely beyond criticism. It was, however, the predominance of intellect and&nbsp;will rather than the perfection of her art that most specially&nbsp;characterized her impersonations and conferred on them&nbsp;their unique excellence. She appeared successively as Émilic&nbsp;in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Cinna,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> Hermione in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Andromaque,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> Ériphile in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Iphigénie,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Monime in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mithridate,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> and Aménaïde in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tancrède ;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> but it&nbsp;was in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Phèdre,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> which she first played on 21st January&nbsp;1843, that her peculiar gifts were most strikingly manifested. In modern plays she created the characters of&nbsp;Judith and Cleopatra in the tragedies of Madame de Girardin, but her most successful appearance was in 1849 in&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Adrienne Lecouvreur.</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> In 1840 she visited London, where&nbsp;her interpretations of Corneille and Racine were the sensation of the season. She also played successively in the&nbsp;principal capitals of Europe. In 1855 she made a tour in&nbsp;the United States with comparatively small success. This&nbsp;was, however, after her powers through continued ill-health&nbsp;had begun to deteriorate. She died of consumption at&nbsp;Cannet, near Cannes, on 4th January 1858.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">RACINE, a city of the United States, the county seat of Racine county, Wisconsin, lies 23 miles by rail south of&nbsp;Milwaukee, and occupies a plateau projecting for about 6&nbsp;miles into Lake Michigan, 40 feet above its level. The&nbsp;town is the seat of extensive manufacturing industries—&nbsp;producing carriages, waggons, ploughs, threshing-machines,&nbsp;portable steam-engines, fanning-mills, leather, blinds and&nbsp;sashes, school furniture, wire, linseed oil, baskets, &amp;c.—&nbsp;is engaged in the lumber trade and general commerce,&nbsp;and contains two city hospitals, an orphan asylum, Racine&nbsp;(Episcopalian) college founded in 1852, and a Roman&nbsp;Catholic academy. The harbour is open to vessels drawing&nbsp;15 feet. Racine, first settled in 1834, was incorporated&nbsp;in 1848, four years after the first steamer had entered the&nbsp;port. The population was 7822 in 1860, 9880 in 1870,&nbsp;and 16,031 in 1880.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">RACINE, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Jean </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(1639-1699), the most equal and accomplished, if not the greatest, tragic dramatist of France, was born at La Ferté Milon in the old duchy of Valois in the&nbsp;month of December 1639.
