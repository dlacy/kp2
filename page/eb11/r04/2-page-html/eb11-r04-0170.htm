<p><span class="font2">scheme of national unity, the natural outcome of the history of Rome and of Italy, impossible of accomplishment under the&nbsp;rule of the popes, was finally achieved by the monarchy of&nbsp;Savoy, which, as the representative and personification of&nbsp;Italian interests, abolished the temporal power of the papacy&nbsp;and made Rome the seat of government of the united country&nbsp;(see </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Italy).</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">, ROME, a province of modem </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Italy, </span><span class="font2">co-extensive with the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">compartimento</span><span class="font2"> of’ Lazio, but really covering a considerably&nbsp;larger area than the ancient Latium, even including Latium&nbsp;adjectum. On the S.E. and E. alone it does not extend so&nbsp;far, the boundary being that between the former papal states&nbsp;and the kingdom of Naples, running from a point S.E. of Ter-racina along the eastern, edge of the Volscian mountains to&nbsp;Coprano, and thence along the Liris valley. It then runs&nbsp;N.E. through the mountains to Carsoli, being conterminous&nbsp;with the Abruzzi; it then includes part of the ancient Sabine&nbsp;country, reaching the Tiber near the railway station of Fara&nbsp;Sabina, 25 m. N. of Rome. It follows the river for some distance, where it is conterminous with Umbria, and then runs&nbsp;S.W. to the coast, where it is conterminous with the province&nbsp;of Grosseto (Tuscany), thus including a considerable portion&nbsp;of the ancient Etruria. The resident population in 1901 was&nbsp;estimated at 1,196,909 (including Rome itself, 520,196), and&nbsp;the floating population, Italian and foreign, 54,383. In 1907&nbsp;the total number was calculated at 1,278,000. In 1871 the&nbsp;aggregate population was only 836,704. Emigration rose from&nbsp;2222 in 1896 to 18,507 in 1906, there being a great rise in 1905,&nbsp;as over all Italy. The economic crisis in the United States in&nbsp;1907, led, however, to a set-back, many emigrants being obliged&nbsp;to return to Italy for lack of work. Alum is extracted from&nbsp;the mines principally near Tolfa. At Filettino above Subiaco&nbsp;asphaltic rock is obtained, and salt from a rocksalt mine near&nbsp;Cometo Tarquinia. Chemical fertilizers are manufactured by&nbsp;several firms. The main industries of the district are, however,&nbsp;agricultural (see </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Latium).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ROME, a city and the county-seat of Floyd county, in the N.W. part of Georgia, U.S.A., at the junction of the Etowah and</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Oostanaula rivers, which here form the Coosa. Pop. (1900) 7291, of whom 2830 were negroes; (1910) 12,099. It is served by&nbsp;the Central of Georgia, the Western &amp; Atlantic (leased by the&nbsp;Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St Louis), the Southern and the Rome&nbsp;&amp; Northern railways, and the Coosa river is navigable from this&nbsp;point to the falls of the river in Alabama. The city is the seat&nbsp;of Shorter College (for women), which was established in 1873&nbsp;as the Cherokee Female College, and received its present name in&nbsp;1877, when it was rebuilt and endowed by Colonel Alfred Shorter;&nbsp;and of the Berry Industrial School (1902), for mountain boys.&nbsp;Rome is situated in a rich agricultural region producing cotton,&nbsp;cereals, vegetables and fruits, for which it is a trading centre,&nbsp;and is a shipping point for bauxite, mined in the vicinity.&nbsp;Other mineral products of this region are iron, limestone,&nbsp;cement rock, fire-brick clay, coal, slate and marble, Rome’s&nbsp;principal manufactures are cotton, cotton-seed oil, lumber,&nbsp;foundry and machine-shop products, bricks and agricultural&nbsp;implements. Its site was originally within the territory of the&nbsp;Cherokee, and on the other side of the Oostanaula river there&nbsp;is said to have been at one time an Indian village, which, </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">lik</span><span class="font2">e&nbsp;several other Creek villages, was called Chiaha (or Chehaw).&nbsp;Here, in October 1793, in his Etowah campaign, John Sevier,&nbsp;with militia from Tennessee, crushed a party of marauding&nbsp;Indians; the battle is commemorated by a monument in&nbsp;Myrtle Hill cemetery. Floyd county was erected in 1833.&nbsp;The first settlement of Rome was made in 1834, and immediately afterwards it became the county-seat. Rome was first&nbsp;chartered as a city in 1847. In 1863 there were brilliant cavalry&nbsp;manœuvres in its vicinity, which resulted in the capture (May 3)&nbsp;of Colonel Abel D. Streight (Federal) with 1800 men by General&nbsp;Nathan B. Forrest (Confederate), with a force one-third the size&nbsp;of that of his opponent. On the 19th of May 1864 the city was&nbsp;captured by a detachment of the Federal Army of General&nbsp;William T. Sherman, then conducting his Atlanta campaign.&nbsp;In 1848-75 Rome was the home of Charles Henry Smith (1826-1903), a popular humorist, who wrote under the name “ Bill&nbsp;Arp.” In 1906 East Rome (pop. 671 in 1900) and North Rome&nbsp;(pop. 960 in 1900), which was formerly called Forestville, were&nbsp;annexed to the city. ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ROME, a city of Oneida county, New York, U.S.A., on the Mohawk river and Wood Creek, and the Erie and the Black river&nbsp;canals, 14 m. W.N.W. of Utica. Pop. (1890) 14,991; (1900)&nbsp;15,343, of whom 2527 were foreign-born; (1910, census)&nbsp;20,497. Rome is served by the New York Central &amp; Hudson&nbsp;River, the Rome, Watertown &amp; Ogdensburg (controlled by the&nbsp;New York Central), the New York, Ontario &amp; Western, and the&nbsp;Utica &amp; Mohawk Valley (electric) railways. It is about 450 ft.&nbsp;above sea-level. The city is the seat of the Academy of the Holy&nbsp;Names (opened in 1865 as St Peter’s Academy), of the State&nbsp;Custodial Asylum for unteachable idiots, of the Central New&nbsp;York Institution for Deaf Mutes (1875), and of the Oneida&nbsp;County Home. The Jervis Public Library (1895), founded&nbsp;by John Bloomfield Jervis (1795-1885), a famous railway&nbsp;engineer, had in 1909 about 15,000 volumes. The surrounding&nbsp;country is devoted largely to farming, especially vegetable&nbsp;gardening, and to dairying. Among the manufactures are&nbsp;brass and copper work, wire for electrical uses, foundry and&nbsp;machine-shop products, locomotives, knit goods, tin cans&nbsp;and canned goods (especially vegetables). In 1905 the value&nbsp;of the factory products was $8,631,427 (55-6% more than in&nbsp;1900).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The portage at this place between the Mohawk river and Wood Creek, which are about 1 m. apart, gave the site its Indian name,&nbsp;De-o-wain-sta, “ place where canoes are carried from one stream&nbsp;to another,” and its earliest English name, “The Great (or&nbsp;Oneida) Carrying-Plate,” and gave it strategic value as a key&nbsp;between the Mohawk Valley and Lake Ontario. About 1725&nbsp;there were built, to protect the carrying-place here, Fort Bull,&nbsp;on Wood Creek, which was surprised and taken by French and&nbsp;Indians in March 1756, and Fort Williams, on the Mohawk,&nbsp;which, like Fort Craven, also on the Mohawk, was destroyed by&nbsp;Colonel Daniel Webb after the reduction of Oswego by the French</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
