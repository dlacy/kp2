<p><span class="font0">This was not the only mark of mental derangement displayed by the unhappy monarch. The army, which formed his favourite employment, was tormented by incessant caprices affecting its discipline ; and the press, the native Russians, and the resident foreigners, suffered tyrannical and unaccountable restrictions. His favours and his&nbsp;displeasure were alternately experienced by some of his&nbsp;roost distinguished courtiers and adherents. Stanislas, the&nbsp;deposed king of Poland, partook by turns of his beneficence&nbsp;and his severity ; and at length, on the death of that&nbsp;monarch, Paul assisted at his funeral, commanded in person the guards that attended on the ceremony, and uncovering himself with the utmost emotion, saluted the coffin as it passed. To the memory of the aged Suwaroff<sub>1&nbsp;</sub>who is said to have fallen a broken-hearted victim to the&nbsp;distraction of his imperial master, he raised a colossal statue&nbsp;of bronze ; and on the days when he reviewed his troops&nbsp;in the square where the figure had been erected, he used to&nbsp;command them to march by in open order, and face the monument. Notwithstanding the important service that had&nbsp;been rendered him by Zuboff, the emperor soon became&nbsp;disgusted with him ; spoke of him to his friends with great&nbsp;asperity ; at length denounced him as a defaulter to the&nbsp;imperial treasury of half a million of roubles ; and, convinced&nbsp;of the justice of the allegation, proceeded to sequestrate the&nbsp;vast estates which belonged to him and his two brothers.&nbsp;Driven to desperation by such conduct, the second brother of the favourite one day walked up boldly to the emperor upon the parade, and with manly eloquence represented the injustice of his measures. Paul received him&nbsp;without anger, heard him without interruption, and restored&nbsp;the property ; but soon afterwards he ordered Plato Zuboff&nbsp;to reside on his estate, though he again restored him to favour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is not surprising that these instances of folly and caprice should alarm and disgust many of the nobles. In particular, Count Pahlen<sub>1</sub> the governor of St Petersburg,&nbsp;with some other men of rank, entered into a confederacy&nbsp;with Zuboff and his brothers for removing the emperor.&nbsp;In their conferences, which were managed with great prudence and discretion, it was resolved that Paul should die,&nbsp;and that the day of the festival called Maslaintza, the Ilth&nbsp;of March O. S. 1801, should be the day for executing the&nbsp;awful deed. At the time of this plot, the emperor and his&nbsp;family resided in the new palace of St Michael, an enormous quadrangular pile standing at the bottom of the summer gardens. Paul being anxious to inhabit this palace&nbsp;soon after he was crowned, the masons, carpenters, and&nbsp;various artificers, toiled with incredible labour, by day and&nbsp;by torch-light, under the sultry sun of the summer, and in&nbsp;all the severity of a polar winter ; and in three years this&nbsp;enormous and magnificent fabric was completed. The&nbsp;whole is moated round ; and when the stranger surveys its&nbsp;bastions of granite, and numerous draw-bridges, he is naturally led to conclude that it was intended for the last&nbsp;asylum of a prince at war with his subjects. Those who&nbsp;have seen its massive walls, and the capaciousness and variety of its chambers, will easily admit that an act of violence might be committed in one room, and not be heard&nbsp;by those who occupy the adjoining one ; and that a massacre might be perpetrated at one end, and not known at&nbsp;the other. Paui took possession of this palace as a place of&nbsp;strength, and beheld it with rapture, because his imperial&nbsp;mother had never even seen it. While his family were&nbsp;here, by every act of tenderness endeavouring to soothe&nbsp;the terrible perturbation of his mind, there were not wanting those who exerted every stratagem to inflame and increase it. These people were constantly insinuating that&nbsp;every hand was armed against him. With this impression,&nbsp;which added fuel to his burning brain, he ordered a secret&nbsp;staircase to be constructed, which, leading from his own&nbsp;chamber, passed under a false stove in the anti-room, and&nbsp;led by a small door to the terrace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It was the custom of the emperor to sleep in an apart- : ment next to the empress’s, upon a sofa, in his regimen*’&nbsp;tals and boots, whilst the grand duke and duchess, and the&nbsp;rest of the imperial family, were lodged at various distances, in apartments below the story which he occupied. On&nbsp;the IOth March, the day preceding the fatal night, whether&nbsp;Paul’s apprehension, or anonymous information, suggested&nbsp;the idea, is not known ; but conceiving that a storm was&nbsp;ready to burst upon him, he sent for Count Pahlen : “ I am&nbsp;informed,” said the emperor, “ that there is a conspiracy cn&nbsp;foot against me ; do you think it necessary to take any precaution ?’ The count, without betraying the least emotion,&nbsp;replied, “ Sire, do not suffer such apprehensions to haunt&nbsp;your mind ; if there were any combinations forming agamst&nbsp;your majesty’s person, I am sure I should be acquainted&nbsp;with it.” “ Then I am satisfied,” said the emperor ; and the&nbsp;governor withdrew. Before Paul retired to rest, he, beyond his usual custom, expressed the most tender solicitude for the empress and his children, kissed them with all&nbsp;the warmth of farewell fondness, and remained with them&nbsp;for a considerable time. He aftcrwards visited the sentinels at their different posts, and then retired to his chamber.&nbsp;Soon after the emperor had retired, the guard that was&nbsp;always placed at his chamber door was, on some pretext,&nbsp;changed by the officers who had the command for the&nbsp;night, and who were engaged in the conspiracy. One man&nbsp;oniy remained. This was a hussar whom the emperor had&nbsp;honoured with particular marks of attention, and who always slept at night in the antechamber, at his sovereign’s&nbsp;bed-room door. This faithful soldier it was found impossible to remove, except by force, which at that time the&nbsp;conspirators did not think proper to employ. Silence now&nbsp;reigned throughout the palace, disturbed only by the pacing of the sentinels, or by the distant murmurs of the Neva ; and only a few straggling lights were to be seen, irregularly gleaming through the windows of the palace. In&nbsp;the dead of the night, Zuboff and his friends, amounting to&nbsp;eight or nine persons, passed the draw-bridge, ascended the&nbsp;staircase that led to the emperor’s apartments, and met with&nbsp;no opposition till they reached the antechamber, where the&nbsp;faithful hussar, awakened by the noise, challenged them,&nbsp;and presented his fusee. Though they must have admired&nbsp;the brave fidelity of the guard, neither time nor circumstances would admit of an act of generosity which might&nbsp;have endangered their whole plan of operations. Zuboff&nbsp;therefore drew his sabre, and cut the poor fellow down.&nbsp;In the mean time, Paul, roused by the unusual bustle,&nbsp;sprang from his couch. At this moment the whole party&nbsp;rushed into his chamber. The unhappy sovereign, anticipating their design, at first endeavoured to intrench himself behind the chairs and tables ; but soon recovering some&nbsp;share of his natural courage, he assumed a high tone, told&nbsp;them they were his prisoners, and required them to surrender. Finding that they fixed their eyes steadily and fiercely&nbsp;upon him, and continued to advance, he implored them to&nbsp;spare his life, declared his willingness instantly to relinquish&nbsp;the sceptre, and to accept of any terms which they might&nbsp;dictate. He even offered to make them princes, and to&nbsp;confer on them orders and estates. Regardless alike of his&nbsp;threats and promises, they now’ began to press on him, when&nbsp;he made a convulsive effort to reach the window, but failed&nbsp;in the attempt; and, indeed, had he succeeded in his endeavour to escape that way, the height from the window to the&nbsp;ground was so great, that the expedient w<sup>,</sup>ould probably&nbsp;have only put a more speedy period to his existence. As&nbsp;the conspirators drew him back, he grasped a chair, with&nbsp;which he knocked down one of the assailants, and a desperate conflict now took place. So great was the noise,&nbsp;that notwithstanding the massive walls and double folding</span></p>
