<p><span class="font1">banks in flood-time and inundates the adjacent low-lying lands to an extent depending upon the level of the ground and the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">volume and height of the flood. An enlargement of the bed of the river, principally by deepening it, in order to increase&nbsp;its discharging capacity Sufliciently to prevent inundations,&nbsp;is precluded by the cost, and also, in rivers bringing down&nbsp;sediment, by the large deposit that would take place in the&nbsp;enlarged channel from the reduction in the velocity of the&nbsp;current when the flood begins to subside. Where, however,&nbsp;the depth of a tidal river has been considerably increased by&nbsp;dredging for the extension of its sea-going trade, the enlargement of its channel and the lowering of its low-water line&nbsp;have greatly facilitated the passage of land floods from the&nbsp;river above for some distance up, and consequently reduced&nbsp;their height; for instance, the Glasgow quays along the deepened&nbsp;Clyde are no longer subject to inundation, and the lands and&nbsp;quays bordering the Tyne have been relieved from flooding&nbsp;for nearly io m. above Newcastle by the deepening of the river&nbsp;from Elswick to the sea (fig. 18).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Sometimes works are carried out in a river valley for diminishing the height of floods by delaying the discharge of part of the rainfall into the main river; whilst others are designed&nbsp;to increase the discharging efficiency of the river channels.&nbsp;In certain cases, moreover, it is very important to restrict or to&nbsp;prevent the inundation of some riparian districts by embankments; and occasionally low-lying lands are so unfavourably&nbsp;situated that pumping has to be resorted to for the removal&nbsp;of their drainage waters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Works in River Valleys for diminishing Floods.—</span><span class="font1">Rain falling on bare, impervious, hilly slopes rapidly flows into the nearest&nbsp;water-course, carrying with it any loose soil or disintegrated&nbsp;materials met with in its rush down the ravines, thereby intensifying the torrential character of the river, increasing&nbsp;the height of its floods and adding to the sediment obstructing&nbsp;its course to the sea. By encouraging the growth of vegetation&nbsp;and restricting its use for pasturage, and by planting trees on&nbsp;the mountain slopes, which have often been denuded of their&nbsp;natural covering by the reckless clearing of forests, the flow&nbsp;of the rain off the slopes is retarded; the soil, moreover, is&nbsp;hound together by the roots of the plants, and the surface&nbsp;strata are protected from disintegration by the covering of&nbsp;grass and leaves, so that the amount of detritus carried down&nbsp;into the river is greatly reduced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Proposals have sometimes been made to reduce the height of floods in rivers and restrict the resulting inundations by&nbsp;impounding some of the flood discharge by the construction of&nbsp;one or more dams across the upper valley of a river, and letting&nbsp;it out when the flood has passed down. This arrangement,&nbsp;however, is open to the objection that in the event of a second&nbsp;flood following rapidly on the first, there might not be time&nbsp;to empty the reservoir for its reception. The cost, moreover,&nbsp;of the formation of such reservoirs could rarely be justified&nbsp;merely for the purpose of reducing'the flood-level along an&nbsp;ordinary river valley. Nevertheless, when this provision&nbsp;against floods can be combined with the storage of water-supply for a town, it becomes financially practicable. Thus&nbsp;two masonry dams erected across the narrow valley of the&nbsp;river Furens, a torrential tributary of the Loire, form two&nbsp;reservoirs for the supply of the town of St Étienne, in which&nbsp;the water is kept down several feet below the full level in&nbsp;order to provide for the reception of the surplus flood-waters,&nbsp;and thereby protect St Étienne from inundation. Storage&nbsp;reservoirs also, formed solely for water-supply or irrigation,&nbsp;provided adequate compensation water is discharged from&nbsp;them during dry weather, are advantageous, like lakes, in&nbsp;regulating the flow of the river below.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When a river flowing through flat plains has a very small fall, it requires a proportionately large channel to carry away&nbsp;the drainage waters of the valley; and, accordingly, the low-lying lands bordering the river are very subject to inundations&nbsp;if the rainfall over the higher ground is allowed to flow straight&nbsp;down into the bottom of the valley. By intercepting, however, the flow off the high parts of the valley in small channels&nbsp;excavated along the slopes, termed “ catch-water drains,”&nbsp;the ample fall available from this higher elevation can be&nbsp;utilized for conveying the flow farther down the valley; and&nbsp;the congested river is thereby relieved for a certain part of&nbsp;its length from the rainfall over the higher ground.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Methods of increasing the Discharging Efficiency OfRiver Channels. </span><span class="font1">—The discharging efficiency of a river within the limits of&nbsp;its bed depends on the fall and the cross-section of the channel.&nbsp;The only way of increasing the fall is to reduce the length of&nbsp;the channel by substituting straight cuts for a winding course.&nbsp;This involves some loss of capacity in the channel as a whole,&nbsp;and in the case of a large river with a considerable flow it is&nbsp;very difficult to maintain a straight cut, owing to the tendency&nbsp;of the current to erode the banks and form again a sinuous&nbsp;channel. Even if the cut is preserved by protecting the banks,&nbsp;it is liable to produce changes, shoals and a raising of the&nbsp;flood-level in the channel just below its termination. Nevertheless, where the available fall is exceptionally small, as in&nbsp;lands originally reclaimed from the sea, such as the English&nbsp;fen districts, and where, in consequence, the drainage is in a&nbsp;great measure artificial, straight channels have been formed&nbsp;for the rivers; and on account of the importance of preserving&nbsp;these fertile, low-lying lands from inundation, additional&nbsp;straight channels have been provided for the discharge of&nbsp;the rainfall, known as drains in the fens. Except where a&nbsp;town is exposed to inundations, a considerable modification&nbsp;of the course of a river and an enlargement of its channel do&nbsp;not produce a reduction in the damage from its floods commensurate with the expenditure involved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The removal of obstructions, whether natural or artificial, from the bed of a river furnishes a simple and efficient means&nbsp;of increasing the discharging capacity of its channel, and,&nbsp;consequently, of lowering the height of floods; for every&nbsp;impediment to the flow, in proportion to its extent, raises the&nbsp;level of the river above it so as to produce the additional artificial fall necessary to convey the flow through the restricted&nbsp;channel, thereby reducing the total available fall. Accidental&nbsp;obstructions, brought down by floods, such as trunks of trees,&nbsp;boulders and accumulations </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font1">gravel, require to be periodically removed.
