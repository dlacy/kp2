<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">REMAINDER, REVERSION. In the view of English </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">law a </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">remainder </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">reversion is classed either as an&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">incorporeal </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">hereditament </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">or, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">with greater correctness, as an&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">estate in </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">expectancy (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Real Estate). </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">That is to&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">say, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">it is </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">¡)resent interest subject to an existing estate&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">possession called the particular estate, which must&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">determine </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">before the estate in expectancy can become an&nbsp;estate in possession. A remainder or reversion is in&nbsp;strictness confined to real estate, whether legal or&nbsp;equitable, though a similar interest may exist in personalty.&nbsp;The particular estate and the remainder or reversion&nbsp;together make up the whole estate over which the granter&nbsp;has power of disposition.@@<sup>1</sup> Accordingly a remainder or&nbsp;reversion limited on an estate in fee simple is void. The&nbsp;difference between a remainder and a reversion, stated as&nbsp;simply as possible, is that the latter is that undisposed-of&nbsp;part of the estate which after the determination of the&nbsp;particular estate will fall into the possession of the original&nbsp;grantor or his representative, while a remainder is that&nbsp;part of the estate which under the same circumstances will&nbsp;fall into the possession of a person other than the original&nbsp;grantor or his representative. A reversion in fact is a&nbsp;special instance of a remainder, distinguishable from it in&nbsp;two important respects :—(1) a reversion arises by operation of law on every grant of an estate where the whole&nbsp;interest is not parted with, whereas a remainder is created&nbsp;by express words ; (2) tenure exists between the reversioner&nbsp;and the tenant of the particular estate, but not between the&nbsp;latter and the remainderman. Accordingly rent service&nbsp;is said to be an incident of a reversion but not of a&nbsp;remainder, and a reversioner could distrain for it at&nbsp;common law (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Rent). </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">A reversion may be limited&nbsp;upon any number of remainders, each of them as it falls&nbsp;into possession becoming itself a particular estate. Thus&nbsp;A may grant an estate for life or for years to B, with&nbsp;remainder to C, with remainder to D, with a reversion or&nbsp;ultimate remainder to himself. A remainder or reversion&nbsp;may be alienated either by deed or by will. A conveyance&nbsp;by the tenant of a particular estate to the remainderman&nbsp;or reversioner is called a surrender; a conveyance by the&nbsp;remainderman or reversioner to the tenant is a release.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Remainder.</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">—Remainders are either vested or contingent. “An estate is vested in interest when there is a present fixed right of&nbsp;future enjoyment. An estate is contingent when a right of enjoyment is to accrue on an event which is dubious and uncertain. A&nbsp;contingent remainder is a remainder limited so as to depend on an&nbsp;event or condition which may never happen or be performed, or&nbsp;which may not happen or he performed till after the determination&nbsp;of the preceding estate ” (Fearne, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Contingent Remainders,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> 2, 3).&nbsp;Contingent remainders are of two kinds, those limited to uncertain&nbsp;persons and those limited on uncertain events. A grant by A to B&nbsp;for life, followed by a remainder in fee to the heir of C is an&nbsp;example of a contingent remainder.@@<sup>2</sup> Until the death of C he can&nbsp;have no heir. If C die during the lifetime of B, the contingent&nbsp;remainder of his heir becomes vested; if C survive B, the&nbsp;remainder is at common law destroyed owing to the determination&nbsp;of the particular estate, for every remainder must have a particular&nbsp;estate to support it. In the case of a contingent remainder, it&nbsp;must become vested during the continuance of the particular estate&nbsp;or at the instant of its determination. This rule of law no doubt&nbsp;arose from the disfavour shown by the law to contingent remainders&nbsp;on their first introduction. They were not firmly established even&nbsp;when Littleton wrote in the reign of Edward IV. (see Williams,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Real Property,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> pt. ii. ch. ii.). The inconveniences resulting from&nbsp;this liability of contingent remainders to destruction were formerly overcome by the device of appointing trustees to preserve&nbsp;contingent remainders at law. Equitable contingent remainders,&nbsp;it should be noticed, were indestructible, for they were supported&nbsp;by the legal estate. In recent times the matter has been dealt&nbsp;with by Act of Parliament. By 8 &amp; 9 Viet. c. 106, § 8, a contingent remainder is rendered capable of taking effect notwithstanding the determination by forfeiture, surrender, or merger&nbsp;of any preceding estate of freehold in the same manner as if such</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">determination had not happened. The case of determination by any other means is met by 40 &amp; 41 Viet. c. 33. The Act provides&nbsp;that a contingent remainder which would have been valid as a&nbsp;springing or shifting use or executory devise or other limitation&nbsp;had it not had a sufficient estate to sup!!ort it as a contingent&nbsp;remainder is, in the event of the particular estate determining&nbsp;before the contingent remainder vests, to be capable of taking effect&nbsp;as though the contingent remainder had originally been created as&nbsp;a springing or shifting use or executory devise or other executory&nbsp;limitation. It will accordingly only be good if the springing use,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">kc.</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> (for which see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Trust), </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">would be good. If the springing use be&nbsp;void as a breach of the rule against perpetuities (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Real Estate),&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">the remainder will likewise be void. It may be noticed that,&nbsp;apart from this Act, there is some uncertainty as to the application&nbsp;of the rule against perpetuities to remainders. The better opinion&nbsp;is that it applies to equitable remainders and to legal remainders&nbsp;expectant upon an estate for life limited to an unborn person. In&nbsp;the latter case the rule as applied to contingent remainders is&nbsp;somewhat different from that affecting executory interests. The&nbsp;period is different, the remainder allowing the tying up of property&nbsp;for a longer time than the executory interest. There is also the&nbsp;further difference that the rule dpes not affect a contingent&nbsp;remainder if it become vested befdre the determination of the&nbsp;particular estate. An executory interest is void if it may transgress the rule, even though it do not actually do so. The subject&nbsp;of remainders would not be complete without a reference to the&nbsp;famous rule in “Shelley’s Case ” (1 Coke’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Reports,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> 93 b). The rule is&nbsp;that when the ancestor by any gift or conveyance takes an estate&nbsp;of freehold, and in the same gift or conveyance an estate is limited,&nbsp;either mediately or immediately, to his heirs or the heirs of his&nbsp;body, in such a case the word “ heirs ” is a word of limitation and&nbsp;not of purchase ; that is to say, the estate of the ancestor is not&nbsp;a life or other freehold estate with remainder to the heirs or heirs of&nbsp;the body, but an estate in fee or an estate tail according to circumstances. The rule is a highly technical one, and has led to much&nbsp;litigation and in many cases without a doubt to the defeat of a&nbsp;testator’s intentions. It is said to have had its origin in the wish&nbsp;of the law to preserve to the lords their right of wardship, which&nbsp;would have been ousted by the heir taking as purchaser and&nbsp;not as successor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The State laws of the United States affecting remainders will be found in Washburn, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Real Property,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> vol. ii. bk. ii. ch. iv. § 7.&nbsp;As a general rule contingent remainders have been rendered of little&nbsp;practical importance by enactments that they shall take effect as&nbsp;executory devises or shall not determine on determination of the&nbsp;particular estate. The rule in “Shelley’s Case” is the common&nbsp;law where it is not repealed by statute. The prevailing spirit of&nbsp;legislation in the States is unfavourable to its continuance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Reversion.</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">—Unlike remainders, all reversions are present or vested estates. The law of reversion, like that of remainder, has&nbsp;been considerably modified by statute. It was formerly considered&nbsp;that on the grant of the reversion the tenant should have the&nbsp;opportunity of objecting to the substitution of a new landlord.&nbsp;It was therefore necessary that he should attorn tenant to the&nbsp;purchaser. Without such attornment the grant was void, unless&nbsp;indeed attornment were compelled by levying a fine. The necessity of attornment was abolished by 4 &amp; 5 Anne c. 16. Its only&nbsp;use at present seems to be in the case of mortgage. A mortgagor&nbsp;in possession sometimes attorns tenant to the mortgagee in order&nbsp;that the latter may treat him as his tenant and distrain for his&nbsp;interest as rent. The legal view that rent was incident to the&nbsp;reversion led at common law to a destruction of the rent by destruction of the reversion. This would of course chiefly happen in&nbsp;the case of an under-tenant and his immediate reversioner, if the&nbsp;intermediate became merged in the superior reversion. To obviate&nbsp;this difficulty it was provided by 8 &amp; 9 Yict. c. 106, § 9, that, on&nbsp;surrender or merger of a reversion expectant on a lease, the rights&nbsp;under it should subsist to the reversion conferring the next vested&nbsp;right. The question as to what covenants run with the reversion&nbsp;is one of the most difficult in law. The rule of common law seems&nbsp;to have been that covenants ran with the land but not with the&nbsp;reversion, that is to say, the benefit of them survived to a new&nbsp;tenant but not to a new landlord. The effect of the Act of 32&nbsp;Hen. VIII. c. 34, and of the Conveyancing Act, 1881 (44 &amp; 45&nbsp;Viet. c. 41, §§ 10, 11, «58), has been to annex to the reversion as a&nbsp;general rule the benefit of the rent and the lessee’s covenants and&nbsp;the burden of the lessor’s covenants. Merely collateral covenants,&nbsp;however, do not run with the reversion, but are regarded as personal contracts between lessor and lessee. At common law on the&nbsp;severance of a reversion a grantee of part of the reversion could not&nbsp;take advantage of any condition for re-entry, on the ground that&nbsp;the condition was entire and not severable. This doctrine was&nbsp;abolished by one of Lord St Leonard’s Acts in 1859. The Conveyancing Act, 1881, § 12, now provides in wider terms than those&nbsp;of the Act of 1859 that on severance of the reversion every condition capable of apportionment is to be apportioned.
