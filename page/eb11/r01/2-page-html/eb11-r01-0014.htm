<p><span class="font0">Louis Racine tells us that his mother “ did not know what a verse was, ” but Racine certainly knew enough about verses&nbsp;for both. They had seven children. The eldest, Jean Baptiste,&nbsp;was born in 1678; the youngest, Louis, in 1692. It has been&nbsp;said that he was thus too young to have many personal memories&nbsp;of his father, but he tells one or two stories which show Racine&nbsp;to have been at any rate a man of strong family affection, as,&nbsp;moreover, his letters prove. Between the two sons came five&nbsp;daughters, Marie, Anne, Elizabeth, Françoise and Madeleine.&nbsp;The eldest, after showing “ vocation, ” married in 1699, Anne&nbsp;and Elizabeth took the veil, the youngest two remained single&nbsp;but did not enter the cloister. To complete the notice of&nbsp;family matters—much of Racine’s later correspondence is&nbsp;addressed to his sister Marie, Madame Rivière.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The almost complete silence which Racine imposed on himself after the comparative failure of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Phèdre</span><span class="font0"> was broken&nbsp;once or twice even before the appearance of his two last&nbsp;exquisite tragedies. The most honourable of these was the&nbsp;reception of Thomas Corneille on 2nd January 1685 at the&nbsp;Academy in the room of his brother. The discourse which&nbsp;Racine then pronounced turned almost entirely on his great&nbsp;rival, of whom he spoke even more than becomingly. But&nbsp;it was an odd conjunction of the two reigning passions of the&nbsp;latter part of his life—devoutness and obsequiousness to the&nbsp;court—which made him once more a dramatist. Madame de&nbsp;Maintenon had established an institution, first called the&nbsp;Maison Saint Louis, and afterwards (from the place to which&nbsp;it was transferred) the Maison de Saint Cyr, for the education&nbsp;of poor girls of noble family. The tradition of including&nbsp;acting in education was not obsolete. At first the governess,&nbsp;Madame de Grinon, composed pieces for representation, but,&nbsp;says Madame de Caylus, a witness at first hand and a good&nbsp;judge, they were “ detestable. ” Then recourse was had to&nbsp;chosen plays of Corneille and Racine, but here there were obvious&nbsp;objections. The favourite herself wrote to Racine that “ nos&nbsp;petites filles ” had played </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Andromaque </span><span class="font0"> “a great deal too well. ”&nbsp;She asked the poet for a new play suited to the circumstances,&nbsp;and, though Boileau advised him against it, it is not wonderful&nbsp;that he yielded. The result was the masterpiece of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Esther,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">with music by Moreau, the court composer and organist of&nbsp;Saint Cyr. Although played by schoolgirls and in a dormitory,&nbsp;it had an enormous success, with which it may be charitably&nbsp;hoped that the transparent comparison of the patroness to&nbsp;the heroine had not too much to do. Printed shortly afterwards,&nbsp;it had to suffer a certain reaction, or perhaps a certain vengeance,&nbsp;from those who had not been admitted to the private stage.&nbsp;But no competent judge could hesitate. Racine probably&nbsp;had read and to some extent followed the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Aman</span><span class="font0"> of Antoine de&nbsp;Montchrétien, but he made of it only the use which a proved&nbsp;master in literature has a perfect right to make of his fore-runners. The beauty of the chorus, which Racine had restored&nbsp;more probably from a study of the Pléiade tragedy than from&nbsp;classical suggestions, the perfection of the characters and&nbsp;the wonderful art of the whole piece need no praise. Almost&nbsp;immediately the poet was at work on another and a still finer&nbsp;piece of the same kind, and he had probably finished </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Athalie&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">before the end of 1690. The fate of the play, however, was&nbsp;very different from that of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Esther.</span><span class="font0"> Some fuss had been made&nbsp;about the worldliness of great court fêtes at Saint Cyr, and&nbsp;the new play, with settings as before by Moreau, was acted&nbsp;both at Versailles and at Saint Cyr with much less pomp and&nbsp;ceremony than </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Esther.</span><span class="font0"> It was printed in March 1691, and&nbsp;the public cared very little for it. The truth is that the last&nbsp;five-and-twenty years of the reign of Louis XIV. were marked&nbsp;by one of the lowest tides of literary accomplishment and&nbsp;appreciation in the history of France. The just judgment of&nbsp;posterity has ranked </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Athalie,</span><span class="font0"> if not as Racine’s best work (and&nbsp;there are good grounds for considering it to be this), at any&nbsp;rate as equal to his best. Thenceforward Racine was practically&nbsp;silent, except for four </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">cantiques spirituelles,</span><span class="font0"> in the style and&nbsp;with much of the merit of the choruses of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Esther</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Athalie.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">The general literary sentiment led by Fontenelle (who inherited&nbsp;the wrongs of Corneille, his uncle, and whom Racine had taken&nbsp;care to estrange further) was against the arrogant critic and&nbsp;the irritable poet, and they made their case worse by espousing&nbsp;the cause of La Bruyère, whose personalities in his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Caractères&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">had made him one of the best-hated men in France, and by&nbsp;engaging in the Ancient and Modern battle with Charles&nbsp;Perrault. Racine, moreover, was a constant and spiteful&nbsp;epigrammatist, and the unlucky habit of preferring his joke&nbsp;to his friend stuck by him to the last. A savage epigram&nbsp;on the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sesostris</span><span class="font0"> of Hilaire Bernard de Longepierre, who had&nbsp;done him no harm, was his familiar acquaintance, and had&nbsp;actually put him above Corneille in a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">parallèle</span><span class="font0"> between them,&nbsp;dates as late as 1695. Still the king maintained him in favour,&nbsp;and so long as this continued he could afford to laugh at Grub&nbsp;Street and the successors of the Hôtel de Rambouillet alike.&nbsp;At last, however, there seems to have come a change, and it&nbsp;is even probable that royal displeasure had some effect on his&nbsp;health. Disease of the liver appears to have been the immediate&nbsp;cause of his death, which took place on 12th April 1699. The&nbsp;king seems to have, at any rate, forgiven him after his death,&nbsp;and he gave the family a pension of 2000 livres. Racine was&nbsp;buried at Port Royal, but even this transaction was not the&nbsp;last of his relations with that famous home of religion and&nbsp;learning. After the destruction of the abbey in 1711 his body&nbsp;was exhumed and transferred to Saint Étienne du Mont, his&nbsp;gravestone being left behind and only restored to his ashes&nbsp;a hundred years later, in 1818. His eldest son was never&nbsp;married; his eldest daughter and Louis Racine have left&nbsp;descendants to the present day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Racine may be considered from two very different points of view, —(1) as a playwright and poetical artificer, and (2) as a&nbsp;dramatist and a poet. From the first point of view there is&nbsp;hardly any praise too high for him. He did not invent the form&nbsp;he practised, and those who, from want of attention to the&nbsp;historical facts, assume that he did are unskilful as well as&nbsp;ignorant. When he came upon the scene the form of French&nbsp;plays was settled, partly by the energetic efforts of the Pléiade&nbsp;and their successors, partly by the reluctant acquiescence of&nbsp;Corneille. It is barely possible that the latter might, if he had&nbsp;chosen, have altered the course of French tragedy; it is nearly&nbsp;certain that Racine could not. But Corneille, though he was&nbsp;himself more responsible than any one else for the acceptance&nbsp;of the single-situation tragedy, never frankly gave himself up&nbsp;to it, and the inequality of his work is due to this. His heart&nbsp;was, though not to his knowledge, elsewhere, and with Shake-speare. Racine, in whom the craftsman dominated the man of&nbsp;genius, worked with a will and without any misgivings. Every&nbsp;advantage of which the Senecan tragedy adapted to modern&nbsp;times was capable he gave it. He perfected its versification;&nbsp;he subordinated its scheme entirely to the one motive which&nbsp;could have free play in it, —the display of a conventionally&nbsp;intense passion, hampered by this or that obstacle; he set himself to produce in verse a kind of Ciceronian correctness. The&nbsp;grammar-criticisms of Vaugelas and the taste-criticisms of&nbsp;Boileau produced in him no feeling of revolt, but only a deter-mination to play the game according to these new rules with&nbsp;triumphant accuracy. And he did so play it. He had supremely&nbsp;the same faculty which enabled the rhétoriqueurs of the 15th&nbsp;century to execute apparently impossible </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">tours de force</span><span class="font0"> in ballades&nbsp;couronnées, and similar tricks. He had besides a real and&nbsp;saving vein of truth to nature, which preserved him from tricks&nbsp;pure and simple. He would be, and he was, as much a poet as&nbsp;prevalent taste would let him be. The result is that such plays&nbsp;as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Phèdre</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Andromaque</span><span class="font0"> are supreme in their own way. If&nbsp;the critic will only abstain from thrusting in tierce, when accord-ing to the particular rules he ought to thrust in quart, Racine&nbsp;is sure to beat him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But there is a higher game of criticism than this, and this game Racine does not attempt to play. He does not even&nbsp;attempt the highest poetry at all. His greatest achievements in&nbsp;pure passion—the foiled desires of Hermione and the jealous&nbsp;frenzy of Phèdre—are cold, not merely beside the crossed love</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
