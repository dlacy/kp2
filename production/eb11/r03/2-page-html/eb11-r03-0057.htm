<p><span class="font0">his power went on increasing to the day of his death in 1312.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Four sons had been born to Malatesta—Malatestino, Giovanni the Lame, Paolo,the Handsome, and Pandolfo; but only the&nbsp;oldest and youngest survived him. Giovanni the Lame&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Sciancato),</span><span class="font0"> a man of a daring impetuosity only equalled by&nbsp;his ugliness, had proved so useful a general to Giovanni da&nbsp;Polenta of Ravenna as to win in reward the hand of that&nbsp;potentate’s beautiful daughter, known to history as Francesca&nbsp;da Rimini. But her heart had been won by the handsome&nbsp;Paolo, her brother-in-law; and the two lovers, being surprised by Giovanni, were murdered by him on the spot (1285).&nbsp;This episode of the story of the Malatesta has been immortalized&nbsp;in Dante’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Inferno,</span><span class="font0"> Giovanni died in 1304. Thus in 1312&nbsp;Malatestino became lord of Rimini, and on his decease in 1317&nbsp;bequeathed the power to his brother Pandolfo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Pandolfo died in 1326, leaving two heirs, Malatesta and Galeotto. The former was nicknamed Guastafamiglia, because,&nbsp;although at first willing to let his brother share his power, he&nbsp;rid himself by violence and treachery of other kinsmen who&nbsp;claimed their just rights to a portion of the state. His intent&nbsp;was to become sole lord and to aggrandize his tiny principality.&nbsp;But the reigning pope, Innocent VI., despatched the terrible&nbsp;Cardinal Albomoz to Romagna, and it was speedily reduced&nbsp;by fire and sword. In 1355 the Malatesta shared the fate of&nbsp;the other potentates of the land. Nevertheless, it was the&nbsp;cardinal’s policy to let existing governments stand, provided&nbsp;they promised to act in subordination to the papal see. Thus&nbsp;he granted the Malatesta brothers the investiture of Rimini,&nbsp;Pesaro, Fano and Fossombrone, and they arranged a division&nbsp;of the state. Guastafamiglia took Pesaro, which was held&nbsp;by his descendants down to the brothers Carlo and Galeazzo.&nbsp;The former of these, who died in 1439, was father to the Parisina&nbsp;beheaded in Ferrara, whose tragic love story has been sung&nbsp;by Byron. The latter won the title of “ lInetto ” (the Incapable) by the foolish sale of his rights over Pesaro to the&nbsp;Sforza in 1447.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Galeotto, on the other hand, retained the lordship of Rimini, ruling tranquilly and on good terms with the popes, who allowed&nbsp;him to add Cervia, Cesena and Bertinoro to his states. Dying&nbsp;in 1385 at the age of eighty, he left two sons—Carlo, who&nbsp;became lord of Rimini, and Pandolfo, who had Fano for his&nbsp;share. Carlo (1364-1429) was energetic, valiant and a friend&nbsp;of the popes, who named him vicar of the church in Romagna.&nbsp;He was a patron of letters and the arts, and during his reign&nbsp;his court began to be renowned for its splendour. As he left&nbsp;no issue, his inheritance was added to that of his brother&nbsp;Pandolfo, and Fano was once more united to Rimini. Pandolfo&nbsp;(1370-1427) had led the life of a condottiere, taking a prominent&nbsp;part in the Lombard wars following on the death of Galeazzo&nbsp;Maria Visconti, and held rule for some time in Brescia and&nbsp;Bergamo. He left three natural sons  who were declared&nbsp;legitimate by Pope Martin V. Theeldest, Galeotto (1411-1432),&nbsp;was an ascetic, gave little or no attention to public business,&nbsp;and, dying early, bequeathed the state to his brother Sigis-mondo Pandolfo. The third son, Novello Malatesta (1418-1465)&nbsp;ruled over Cesena.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Sigismondo (1417-1468) is the personage to whom Rimini owes its renown during the Renaissance, of which indeed he was one&nbsp;of the strangest and most original representatives. He was&nbsp;born in Brescia, and when called to the succession, at the age&nbsp;of fifteen, had already given proofs of valour in the field. His&nbsp;knowledge of antiquity was so profound as to excite the admiration of all the learned men with whom he discoursed, even when,&nbsp;as in the case of Pius II., they chanced to be his personal&nbsp;enemies. To him is due the erection of the church of St Francis,&nbsp;or temple of the Malatesta, one of the rarest gems of the&nbsp;Renaissance and the greatest of Rimini’s treasures (see below&nbsp;for description).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Of so dissolute a life that, although married, he had children by several mistresses at the same time, he gave vent to all his&nbsp;passions with a ferocity that was bestial rather than human.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">And—as the crowning contradiction of his strange nature— from his youth to the day of his death he remained the devoted&nbsp;lover of the woman for whose sake he became a poet, whom&nbsp;he finally made his wife, and whom he exalted in every way,&nbsp;even to the point of rendering her almost divine honours.&nbsp;Yet this love never availed to check his excesses. On assuming power in 1432, Sigismondo was already affianced to the&nbsp;daughter of Count Carmagnola; but when that famous leader&nbsp;was arraigned as a traitor by the Venetians, and igno-miniously put to death, he promptly withdrew from his&nbsp;engagement, under the pretext that it was impossible to&nbsp;marry the child of a criminal. In fact, he aimed at a higher&nbsp;alliance, for he espoused Ginevra d’Este, daughter of the&nbsp;duke of Ferrara, and his entry into Rimini with his bride&nbsp;in 1434 was celebrated by splendid festivities. In 1437&nbsp;a son was bom to him, but died within the year, and in&nbsp;1440 the young mother followed it to the grave. Every&nbsp;one declared that she died by poison administered by her&nbsp;husband. This, however, was never proved. The duke of&nbsp;Ferrara remained his friend, nor is it known what motive&nbsp;Sigismondo could have for wishing to get rid of his wife. Two&nbsp;years afterwards he married Polissena, daughter of the famous&nbsp;condottiere Francesco Sforza, who in 1443 bore him a son named&nbsp;Galeotto Roberto. But by this time he was already madly&nbsp;in love with Isotta degli Atti, and this was the passion that&nbsp;endured to his death. The lady succeeded in gaining an&nbsp;absolute ascendancy over him, which increased with time.&nbsp;She bore him several children, but this did not prevent his&nbsp;having others by different concubines. Such being the nature&nbsp;of the man, it is not astonishing that, as his ardour for Isotta&nbsp;increased, he should have little scruple in ridding himself of his&nbsp;second wife. On the ist June 1450 Polisena died by strangling,&nbsp;and on the 30th of the same month Isotta’s offspring were&nbsp;legitimated by Nicholas V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is only just to record that, although Malatesta’s intrigue with Isotta had long been notorious to all, and he had never&nbsp;sought to conceal it, no one ever accused her of either direct&nbsp;or indirect complicity in her lover’s crimes. Isotta’s history,&nbsp;however, is a strange one, and opens up many curious questions.&nbsp;She was of noble birth and seems to have attracted Sigismondo’s&nbsp;notice as early as 1438, for at the age of twenty he produced&nbsp;verses of some merit in praise of her charms. She was indeed&nbsp;widely celebrated for her beauty and intellect, culture, firmness&nbsp;and prudence; and even Pope Pius II. proclaimed her worthy&nbsp;to be greatly loved. When Sigismondo was absent she governed&nbsp;Rimini wisely and well, and proved herself a match for the&nbsp;statesmen with whom she had to deal. The leading poets of&nbsp;the court dedicated to her a collection of verses entitled </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Isottaei,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">styled her their mistress and the chosen of Apollo. Artists of&nbsp;renown perpetuated her features on canvas, on marble and on&nbsp;many exquisite medals, one of which has a closed book graven&nbsp;on the reverse, with the inscription “ EIegiae ” in allusion to&nbsp;poems she was said to have written. Nevertheless, Yriarte,&nbsp;in his book on the Malatesta and Rimini, asserted that there&nbsp;was documentary evidence to prove that Isotta was unable&nbsp;to sign her own name. But it is not at all surprising that Isotta&nbsp;should have her letters written and signed by another hand,&nbsp;when such was by no means an uncommon practice among the&nbsp;princes and nobilities of her day. Lucrezia Borgia, for instance,&nbsp;frequently did the same. It is besides simply incredible that a&nbsp;woman of the Italian Renaissance of Isotta’s birth, standing&nbsp;and reputation should have been unable to write.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Her marriage with Malatesta did not take place until 1456; but of the ardent affection that had long bound them together&nbsp;there are stronger proofs than the lover’s juvenile verses, or&nbsp;than even the children Isotta had borne to him. For, more&nbsp;than all else, the temple of St Francis has served to transmit&nbsp;to posterity the history of their loves. Malatesta decided on&nbsp;building this remarkable church as a thankoffering for his&nbsp;safety, during a dangerous campaign undertaken for Pope&nbsp;Eugemus IV. about the year 1445.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The first stone was laid in 1446, and the work was carried on</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
