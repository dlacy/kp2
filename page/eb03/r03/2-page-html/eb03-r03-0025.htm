<p><span class="font0">Mr Du Hamel ſays, that it is decided by experi-<sub>t</sub> ence, I. That white cordage in continual ſervice is one-third more durable than tarred. 2. That it retains its force much longer while kept in ſtore. 3. That it refills</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">the ordinary injuries of the weather one-fourth longer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We know this one remarkable fact. In 1758 the ſhrowds and Hays of the Sheer hulk at Portſmouth&nbsp;dockyard were overhawled, and when the worming and&nbsp;ſervice were taken off, they were found to be of white&nbsp;cordage. On examining the ftorekeeper’s books, they&nbsp;were found to have been formerly the ſhrowds and rigging of the Royal William, of no guns, built in 1715,&nbsp;and rigged in 1716. She was thought top-heavy and&nbsp;unfit for ſea, and unrigged and her flores laid up. Some&nbsp;few years afterwards, her ſhrowds and Hays were fitted&nbsp;on the Sheer hulk, where they remained in confiant&nbsp;and very hard ſervice for about 30 years, while every&nbsp;tarred rope about her had been repeatedly renewed.&nbsp;This information we received from Mr Brown, boat-ſwain of the Royal William during the war 1758, &amp;c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Why then do we tar cordage ? We thus render it more unpliant, weaker, and leſs durable. It is chiefly&nbsp;ſerviceable for cables and ground tackle, which muff be&nbsp;continually wetted and even ſoaked. The reſult of&nbsp;careful obſervation is, I. That white cordage, expoſed&nbsp;to be alternately very wet and dry, is weaker than tarred cordage. 2. That cordage which is ſuperficially&nbsp;tarred is conſtantly ſtronger than what is tarred throughout, and it refills better the alternatives of wet and dry.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">N. B.</span><span class="font0"> The ſhrouds of the Sheer hulk werc well tarred&nbsp;and blacked, ſo that it was not known that they were&nbsp;of white cordage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Tar is a curious ſubſtance, miſcible completely with water. Attempts were made to anoint cordage with&nbsp;oils and fats which do not mix with water. This was&nbsp;expected to defend them from its pernicious effects.&nbsp;But it was diſtinctly found that theſe matters made the&nbsp;fibres of hemp glide ſo eaſily on each other, that it&nbsp;was hardly poſſible to twiſt them permanently. Before&nbsp;they graſped each other ſo hard that they could not be&nbsp;drawn, they were ſtrained almoſt to breaking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Attempts have been made to increaſe the ſtrength of cordage by tanning. But although it remains&nbsp;a conſtant practice in the manufacture of nets, it&nbsp;does not appear that much addition, either of ſtrength&nbsp;or durability, can be given to cordage by this means.&nbsp;The trial has been made with great care, and by per-ſons fully able to conduct the proceſs with propriety.&nbsp;But it is found that the yarns take ſo long time in drying, and are ſo much hurt by drying flowly, that the&nbsp;room required for a conſiderable rope-work would be&nbsp;immenſe ; and the improvement of the cordage is but&nbsp;trifling, and even equivocal. Indeed tanning is a chemical proceſs, and its effect depends entirely on the nature of the materials to which the tan is applied. It&nbsp;unqueſtionably condenſes, and even ſtrengthens, the fibre&nbsp;of leather : but for any thing that we know </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">à priori,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">it may deſtroy the coheſion of hemp and flax ; and experiment alone could decide the queſtion. The reſult&nbsp;has been unfavourable ; but it does not follow from this&nbsp;that a tan cannot be found which ſhall produce on the&nbsp;texture of vegetables effects ſimilar to what oak-bark and&nbsp;other aſtringents produce on the animal fibre or mem</span><span class="font1">brane. It is well known that ſome dyes increaſe the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ſtrength of flax and cotton, notwithſtanding the </span><span class="font1">corro-</span><span class="font0">ſion which we know to be produced by ſome of the ingredients. This is a ſubject highly worth the&nbsp;attention of the chemiſt and the patriot.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">ROQUET. See Rocket.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RORIDULA, in botany : A genus of the monσ-gynia order, belonging to the pentandria claſs of plants. The corolla 13 pentapetalous ; the calyx peπ-taphyllous ; the capſule trivalved ; the antheræ ſcroti-form at the baſe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROSA, the Rose : A genus of the polygamia order, belonging to the icoſandria claſs of plants ; and in the natural method ranking under the 35th order, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sen-tocoſx.</span><span class="font0"> There are five petals ; the calyx is urceolated,&nbsp;quinquefid, cornous, and ſtraitened at the neck. The&nbsp;ſeeds are numerous, hiſpid, and affixed to the inſide of&nbsp;the calyx.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The forts of roſes are very numerous ; and the bo-taniſts find it very difficult to determine with accuracy which are ſpecies and which are varieties, as well as&nbsp;which are varieties of the reſpective ſpecies. On this&nbsp;account Linnæus, and ſome other eminent authors, arc&nbsp;inclined to think that there is only one real ſpecies&nbsp;of roſe, which is the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">roſa canina,</span><span class="font0"> or “ dog-roſe of the&nbsp;hedges,” &amp;c. and that all the other forts are accidental varieties of it. However, according to the preſent Linnæan arrangement, they ſtand divided into 14&nbsp;ſuppoſed ſpecies, each comprehending varieties, which&nbsp;in ſome forts are but few, in others numerous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The ſuppoſed ſpecies and their varieties, according to the arrangement of modern botaniſts, are as follow :</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">I. The canina, canine roſe, wild dog-roſe of the&nbsp;hedges, or hep-tree, grows five or fix feet high, having&nbsp;prickly-ſtalks and branches, pinnated, five or ſeven-lobed leaves, with aculeated foot-ſtalks, ſmooth pedunculi, oval ſmooth germina, and ſmall ſingle flowers.&nbsp;There are two varieties, red-flowered and wſhite-flow-ered. They grow wild in hedges abundantly all over&nbsp;the kingdom ; and are ſometimes admitted into gardens, a few to increaſe the variety of the ſhrubbery col</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">lection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alba, or common white-roſe, grows five or&nbsp;fix feet high, having a green item and branches, armed&nbsp;with prickles, hiſpid pedunculi, oval ſmooth germina,&nbsp;and large white flowers. The varieties are,—large&nbsp;double white roſe—dwarf ſingle white roſe—maidens-bluſh white roſe, being large, produced in cluſters, and&nbsp;of a white and bluſh-red colour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gallica, or Gallican roſe, &amp;c. grows from&nbsp;about three or four to eight or* ten feet high, in different varieties; with pinnated, three, five, or ſeven-lobed&nbsp;leaves, and large red and other coloured flowers in different forts. This ſpecies is very extenſive in ſuppoſed&nbsp;varieties, bearing the above ſpeciſic diſtinction, ſeveral&nbsp;of wſhich have been formerly conſidered as diſtinct ſpecies, but are now ranged among the varieties of the Gallican roſe, conſiſting of the following noted varieties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Common red officinal roſe, grows erect, about three or four feet high, having ſmall branches, with but few&nbsp;prickles, and large ſpreading half-double deep-red</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
