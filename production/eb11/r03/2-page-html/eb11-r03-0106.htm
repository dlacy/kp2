<p><span class="font0">and asphalt are more slippery when wet, and that therefore watering should be obviated as far as possible by thorough cleansing. Hydrostatic vans, by improvements in the distributing pipes and regulating&nbsp;valves, water a wide track uniformly with an amount of water&nbsp;which can be regulated at pleasure. Where hydrants exist in connexion with a water supply at high pressure, street watering can be&nbsp;effected by a movable hose and jet, a method much more effective&nbsp;in cleansing the surface, but using a much larger quantity of water.&nbsp;Another method which has been tried, but not much used, is to lay&nbsp;perforated pipes at the back of the kerb on each side of the road,&nbsp;from which jets are thrown upon the surface. The first cost is&nbsp;considerable, and the openings for the jets are liable to choke and&nbsp;get out of order. Deliquescent salts have been used for street&nbsp;watering, by which the surface is kept moist, but at the expense&nbsp;of the moisture in the air. Sea water has the same effect in a less&nbsp;degree.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Cleansing.—</span><span class="font0">The principal streets of a town are generally cleansed daily, either by hand-sweeping and hand-scraping or by machines.&nbsp;Sir Joseph Whitworth’s machine consists of a series of revolving&nbsp;brooms on an endless chain, whereby the mud or dust is swept up&nbsp;an incline into the cart. A less costly and cumbersome machine&nbsp;consists of a revolving brush mounted obliquely, which sweeps a&nbsp;track 6 ft. wide and leaves the dust or mud on one side to be&nbsp;gathered up by hand. A horse scraping-machinc which delivers&nbsp;the mud at the side is also used, the blades of the scrapers being&nbsp;mounted obliquely and covering a width of 6 ft. For general&nbsp;use, more especially in the country, scraping-machines, worked by a&nbsp;man from side to side of the road, and scraping a width of about&nbsp;4 ft., are more convenient.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">All street surfaces suffer from the constant breaking up and disturbance to which they are subjected for the purpose of laying and repairing gas and water pipes. Subways, either under the middle&nbsp;of the road or near the kerbs, in which the pipes may be laid and be&nbsp;always accessible, have often been advocated, and in a few instances&nbsp;have been constructed; but they have not hitherto found general&nbsp;favour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Footways.—</span><span class="font0">Gravel is the most suitable material for country or suburban footways; it should be bottomed with a coarser material,&nbsp;well drained and should be laid with. a roller. An inclination&nbsp;towards the kerb of about half an inch in a foot may be given, or&nbsp;the surface may be rounded, to throw off the wet. Where greater&nbsp;cleanliness is desirable and the traffic is not too great a coal-tar&nbsp;concrete similar to that already described, but of smaller materials,&nbsp;makes a good and economical footway. The coating should be 2j&nbsp;or 3 in. thick, composed of two or three layers each well rolled,&nbsp;the lower layer of materials of about i} in. gauge, and the upper&nbsp;of a half or a quarter of an inch gauge, with Derbyshire spar or fine&nbsp;granite chippings over all. Concrete footways require to be carefully&nbsp;made and must be allowed to set thoroughly before they are used.&nbsp;Concrete has a tendency to crack from contraction, especially when&nbsp;in a thin layer, and it is better to lay a footway in sections, with&nbsp;joints at intervals of about </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">2</span><span class="font0"> yds. Concrete slabs, especially when&nbsp;silicated and constituting artificial stone, make an excellent footway.&nbsp;The material is composed of crushed granite, gravel or other suitable material, mixed with Portland cement and cast in moulds, and&nbsp;when set saturated with silicate of soda. This paving has proved&nbsp;more durable than York stone. flagging, but it is more slippery,&nbsp;especially when made with granite. York stone makes a good and&nbsp;pleasant foot pavement, but is somewhat expensive considering&nbsp;its durability; it is apt to wear unevenly and to scale off when the&nbsp;stone is not of the best quality. It should not be laid of a less thickness than 2 in.; </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">2</span><span class="font0">J or 3 in. are more usual. The flags should&nbsp;be square jointed, not under-cut at the. edges, and should be well&nbsp;bedded and jointed with mortar. Caithness flag is much more&nbsp;durable than York stone and wears more evenly; it is impervious&nbsp;to wet and dries quickly by evaporation. The edges are sawn, and&nbsp;the hardness of the.stone renders it difficult to cut it to irregular&nbsp;shapes or to fit openings. Staffordshire blue bricks and bricks made&nbsp;of scoria from iron furnaces are both very durable, though somewhat&nbsp;brittle. Asphalt either laid as mastic or compressed is extensively&nbsp;used for footways; the former is considered inferior in durability&nbsp;to. York stone and the latter superior to it. Asphalt should not be&nbsp;laid less than three-fourths of an inch thick on 4 in. of cement&nbsp;concrete, and 1 in. of asphalt is desirable where there is great traffic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Footways in a street must be retained by a kerbing of granite, York stone, Purbeck or other stone sufficiently strong to stand the&nbsp;blows from wheels to which it is subjected. It should be at least&nbsp;4 in. wide and 9 deep and in lengths of not less than 3 ft. A&nbsp;granite kerb is usually about 12 by 6 in., either placed on edge or&nbsp;laid on the flat. When set on edge a kerb is generally bedded on&nbsp;gravel with a mall ; when laid on the flat a concrete bed is desirable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In a macadamized street pitched or paved water channels are required to prevent the wash of the surface water from undermining&nbsp;the kerb. The pitching consists of cubical blocks of hard stone&nbsp;about 4 in. deep, bedded on sand or mortar, or preferably on&nbsp;a bed of concrete. A paved channel consists of flat stones about&nbsp;i ft. wide inclining slightly towards the kerb. Moulded bricks&nbsp;and artificial stone.are. also used both for side channelling and for&nbsp;kerbing. Such an inclination must be given to the channel as will</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">bring the surlace water to gullies placed at proper intervals, and the level of the kerbing and consequently of the footway will depend&nbsp;to some extent on the surface drainage as well as on the levels of&nbsp;adjacent houses. To lay out a street satisfactorily the. longitudinal&nbsp;and transverse sections must be considered in relation to these&nbsp;matters as well as to the levels of intersecting streets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROAN (O. Fr. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rouan, roueny</span><span class="font0"> Ital. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">roano, rovano;</span><span class="font0"> perhaps connected with </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rufus,</span><span class="font0"> red), a word applied to a variety of&nbsp;colour in an animal’s coat, especially that of a horse, where&nbsp;there is a mixture of grey or white hair with the prevailing&nbsp;tint of bay, chestnut or sorrel. A sorrel when thus modified&nbsp;is either a strawherry-roan or a cream-roan. The term is&nbsp;also used of a soft, flexible kind of leather made of sheepskin,&nbsp;used in bookbinding as a substitute for or in imitation of&nbsp;morocco; but in this sense the origin is doubtful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROANNE, a town of east-central France, capital of an arrondissement in the department of Loire, on the left bank of the Loire, 54 m. N.W. of Lyons on the Paris-Lyons railway&nbsp;to Moulins. Pop. (1906) 33,981. The chief buildings are a&nbsp;modern town hall and the church of St Étienne (1835-1843),&nbsp;built in the Flamboyant Gothic style. The lycée occupies&nbsp;the buildings of the old college dating from the early 17th&nbsp;century. A fine bridge of seven arches connects Roanne with&nbsp;the industrial suburb of Le Coteau on the right bank of the&nbsp;river. The town is the seat of a sub-prefect, of tribunals of&nbsp;first instance and of commerce, of a chamber of commerce&nbsp;and a board of trade-arbitration, and has lycées for both sexes.&nbsp;Cotton goods form the staple manufacture, and cotton-spinning&nbsp;is also important. The making of knitted woollen articles&nbsp;gives employment to large numbers of women in the town and&nbsp;district. There are besides extensive engineering works,&nbsp;foundries, dye-works, tanneries, pottery and tile-works and&nbsp;other industrial establishments. As the centre of the Roannais&nbsp;coalfield, Roanne has trade in coal and coke. It is also the&nbsp;terminus of the Roanne-Digoin Canal and the real starting-point of the Loire navigation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Roanne </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Rodomna,</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Roidomna)</span><span class="font0"> was an ancient city of the Segusiani and a station on the great Roman road from Lyons&nbsp;to the ocean. In 1447 the lordship of Roannais became the&nbsp;property of the celebrated banker Jacques Cœur, from whom&nbsp;it passed as the result of a law-suit to the family of Gouffier.&nbsp;In their favour the title was raised to the rank of marquisate&nbsp;and in 1566 to the rank of duchy; it became extinct in the&nbsp;first half of the iSth century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROANOKE, a river of the South Atlantic Slope, U.S.A. With the Staunton, which rises in the Appalachian Valley in southwestern Virginia, it constitutes one river, and, flowing in a&nbsp;general south-easterly direction, crosses the boundary between&nbsp;Virginia and North Carolina just above the Fall Line and&nbsp;discharges into Albemarle Sound. It is nearly 400 m. long,&nbsp;with a drainage area of 9237 sq. m. The United States government adopted a project in 1871 for clearing a channel with a&nbsp;minimum depth of 5 ft. at low water from its mouth to Weldon,&nbsp;a distance of 129 m., and in 1909, when the project was 80%&nbsp;completed, vessels drawing 4 ft. of water could ascend at low&nbsp;stages nearly to Weldon. The main river and its principal&nbsp;tributary, the Dan, are also navigable, for many miles above&nbsp;the Fall Line, by pole boats. In 1829 the Weldon Canal,&nbsp;12 m. long, was opened to afford a passage around the falls, but&nbsp;it was abandoned in 1850.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROANOKE, a city in (but administratively independent of) Roanoke county, Virginia, on the Roanoke river, about 55 m.&nbsp;W.S.W. of Lynchburg. Pop. (1890) 16,159;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i9°°) 21,495,</span></p>

Roanoke is served by the Virginian railway, by the main line and the&nbsp;Shenandoah and t,he Winston-Salem divisions of the Norfolk&nbsp;&amp; Western railway, and by electric railway to Vintonandto&nbsp;Salem. The city is about 900 ft. above sea-level and is surrounded by high hills; its picturesque situation and its nearness&nbsp;to famous mineral springs make it a health resort. On a&nbsp;mountain slope, about J m. from the city limits, is the Virginia&nbsp;College for Young Ladies; 7 m. north of the city, at what was</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
