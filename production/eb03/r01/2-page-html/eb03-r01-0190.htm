<p><span class="font1">Foulon. His character, it may well be imagined, was extremely unpopular ; for he is ſaid to have aſſerted,&nbsp;that he would &quot; make the people of Paris eat hay.”&nbsp;He had retired to the country, but was ſeized by his&nbsp;■ own vaſſals, and brought to Paris with a bundle of hay&nbsp;<sup>:</sup>tied to his back. In ſpite of every effort made by Μ. M.&nbsp;Bailly and Fayette to procure him a fair trial at leaſt,&nbsp;.he was carried to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Place de Gre*υe,</span><span class="font1"> and hanged at a&nbsp;lamp-iron by the enraged multitude. His ſon-ſh-law&nbsp;M. Berthier, attempting to defend himſelf againſt a&nbsp;ſimilar fate, fell, covered with wounds. Their heads&nbsp;were carried round on poles ; and thus the populace&nbsp;became habituated to the fight of blood and murder :&nbsp;they were even taught by popular ſongs to glory in&nbsp;ſuch actions, and particularly by the well known ſong&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ca-ira.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In conſequence of an invitation from the king, M. Neckar returned to France. He was received by the&nbsp;aſſembly with great applauſe, and in Paris with infinite&nbsp;ſolemnity and triumph. He here, however, committed&nbsp;a political error that made ſome noiſe. In deploring&nbsp;the late exceſſes and murders, and taking notice of&nbsp;the arrcſt of M. Bezenval, an officer of the Swiſs&nbsp;guards, he requeſted of the electors at the Hotel de&nbsp;villc, in a ſolemn harangue, that the paſt ſhould be for-gotten ; that proſcriptions ſhould ceaſe, and a general&nbsp;amneſty be proclaimed. In a moment of enthuſiaſm&nbsp;this was agreed to, and the electors decreed what un-queſtionably exceeded their powers. The diſtricts of&nbsp;Paris were inſtantly in commotion ; the electors alarmed, declared that they only meant that &quot; henceforth the&nbsp;people would puniſh no man but according to law&nbsp;and, at the ſame time, to prove that they themſelves&nbsp;were free from ambition, they formally renounced all&nbsp;their own powers. The aſſembly took up the que-ſtion. Meſſ. Lally, Tolendal, Mounier, Clermont,&nbsp;Tonnerre, Garat junior, and others, declared that no&nbsp;perſon ought to be arreſted without a formal accuſation. while Meſſ. Mirabcau, Robeſpierre, Barnave,&nbsp;and Gleizen, alleged, on the contrary, that the people&nbsp;were entitled to lay hold of any man who had public-ly appeared at the head of their enemies. The debate&nbsp;ended, by admitting the explanation of the electors,&nbsp;and by a declaration that it was the duty of the aſſern-bly to fee juſtice executed in all cafes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The commotions and enthuſiaſm of the capital were fpeedily communicated to the provinces. In every&nbsp;quarter the people ſeized upon all the arms that could&nbsp;be found, and the military uniformly refuſed to act&nbsp;againſt them. Many acts of outrage were committed&nbsp;in Brittany, at Straſhourg, in the Lionnois, and elfe-where, in which the nobility were the ſuſſerers. The&nbsp;miſchiefs that occurred were ufually magnified at a diſtance ; but that very circumſtance wa6 an additional&nbsp;evil. For example : It was ſtated in the National Affembly that M. de Meſmay, lord of Quincey, invited a&nbsp;number of patriots, among whom were the officers of&nbsp;a neighbouring garrifon, to a fplendid entertainment at&nbsp;his houſe, to celebrate the happy union of the three&nbsp;orders : That in the midſt of the feaſt the maſter of the&nbsp;houſe contrived to withdraw unnoticed, and to ſet fire&nbsp;to a train previouſly laid, which communicated with a&nbsp;quantity of gunpowder in the cellars, in conſequence&nbsp;of which the whole company, by a ſudden exp!ofion,&nbsp;were blown into the air. It w.as found </span><span class="font0">on </span><span class="font1">inquiry,&nbsp;that there was not one word of truth in the whole </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ſtory.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">But before this inquiry could be made, all France&nbsp;had reſounded with accounts of the pretended bloody&nbsp;tragedy; and the whole nobility of the kingdom ſuffer-ed in a leſs or greater degree, from the prejudices ex-cited by this unhappy report, the origin of which has&nbsp;never bcen well explained. It would be vain to ſtate all&nbsp;the idle rumours to which at this time the blind credu-lity of the multitude gave currency. At one time, the&nbsp;Ariſtocrates were cutting down the green corn, at an-other time they were burying flour in common ſewers,&nbsp;or caſting loaves into the Seine. One report was no&nbsp;ſooner proved to be falſe than another aroſe, and the&nbsp;whole nation was agitated by ſuſpicion and alarm. The&nbsp;National Aſſembly were engaged in framing their cele-brated declaration of the rights of man, which was to&nbsp;form the baſis of die new conſtitution, when the alarming accounts, received from all quarters, of the ſtate of&nbsp;anarchy into which the kingdom was falling, obliged&nbsp;them ſuddenly to turn their attention to objects of&nbsp;practical neceſlity. The privileged orders found them-ſelves become the objects of univerſal jealoufy and hatred; and that ſomething muſt inſtantly be done to fave&nbsp;their families and property, which were menaced on&nbsp;every ſide with pcrſecution and pillage. Regarding&nbsp;the popular torrent as now become irreſiſtible, to ſave&nbsp;ſomething they reſolved to ſacrifice a part.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Οη the afternoon fitting of the 4th of Auguſt, the viſcount de Noailles, ſeconded by the Duke d’Aguil-lon, opened one of the moſt important ſcenes in the&nbsp;French Revolution, or in the hiſtory of any conntry.&nbsp;Theſe noblemen ſtated, that the true cauſe of the corn-motions which convulſed the kingdom exiſted in the mi-ſery of the people, who groaned under the double op-preſſion of public contributions and of feudal ſerviqes.&nbsp;“ For three months (ſaid M. de Noailles) the people&nbsp;have beheld us engaged in verbal diſputes, while their&nbsp;own attention and their wiſhes are directed only to&nbsp;things, what is the conſequence ? They are armed to&nbsp;reclaim their rights, and they fee no proſpect of obtaining them but by force.” He therefore propoſed to do&nbsp;juſtice as the ſhorteſt way of reſtoring tranquillity, and&nbsp;for that purpoſe to decree, that henceforth every tax&nbsp;ſhould be impoſed in proportion to the wealth of the&nbsp;contributors, and that no order of the ſtate ſhould be&nbsp;exempted from thc payment of public burdens ; that&nbsp;feudal claims ſhould be redeemed at a fair valuation ;&nbsp;but that ſuch claims as conſiſted of perſonal ſervices on&nbsp;the part of the vaſſal ſhould be aboliſhed without com-penſation, as contrary to the impreſcriptible rights of&nbsp;man. The extenſive poſſeffions of the noblemen who&nbsp;made theſe propoſals added much luſtre to the diſinte-reſted facrifice which they offered. Their fpeeches&nbsp;were received with the moſt enthuſiaſtic applauſes by&nbsp;the Aſſembly and the galleries, and their propoſals&nbsp;were decreed by acclamation without a vote. No nation is ſo much led by the influence of ſudden emotions&nbsp;as the French. The patriotic contagion now ſpread&nbsp;faſt through eveιy breaſt, and a conteſt of generoſity&nbsp;enſued. The hereditary juriſdictions poſſeſſed by the&nbsp;nobles within their own territories were next ſacvificed.&nbsp;All places and penſions granted by the Court were fup-preſled, unleſs granted as the reward of merit or of actual ſervices.
