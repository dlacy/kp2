<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hereditary Right.</span><span class="font0"> See HeREDitλry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Right is a word which, in the propriety of the Engliſh language, is uſed ſometimes as an adjective and&nbsp;ſometimes as a ſubſtantive. As an adjective it is nearly&nbsp;of the ſame import with </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ft, ſuitable, becoming, proper ;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and whilſt it expreſſes a quality, it indicates a relation*.&nbsp;Thus, when we ſay that an action is </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">right,</span><span class="font0"> we muſt not&nbsp;only know the nature of the action, but, if we ſpeak&nbsp;intelligibly, muſt alſo perceive its relation to the end&nbsp;for which it was performed ; for an action may be&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">right</span><span class="font0"> with one end in view which would be </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">wrong</span><span class="font0"> with&nbsp;another. The conduct of that general would be </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">right,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">who, to fave an army that could not be otherwiſe ſaved,&nbsp;ſhould place a ſmall detachment in a ſtation where he&nbsp;knew they would all be inevitably cut off ; but his conduct would be very </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">wrong</span><span class="font0"> were he to throw away the&nbsp;life of a ſingle individual for any purpoſe, however important, which he knew how<sup>,</sup> to accompliſh without&nbsp;ſuch a ſacrifice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Many philoſophers have talked of actions being </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">right </span><span class="font0">and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">wrong</span><span class="font0"> in the abſtract without regard to their natural conſequences ; and converting the word into a&nbsp;ſubſtantive, they have fancied an eternal rule of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">right,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">by which the morality of human conduct is in every&nbsp;particular caſe to be tried. But in theſe phraſes we&nbsp;can diſcover no meaning. Whatever is </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">right</span><span class="font0"> muſt be&nbsp;ſo on </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ſome account or other ;</span><span class="font0"> and whatever is </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ft,</span><span class="font0"> muſt be&nbsp;fit for ſome </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">purpoſe.</span><span class="font0"> When he who reſts the foundation&nbsp;of virtue on the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">moralſenſe,</span><span class="font0"> ſpeaks of an action being&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">right,</span><span class="font0"> he muſt mean that it is ſuch as, through the medium of that ſenſe, will excite complacency in the mind&nbsp;of the agent, and gain to him the general approbation&nbsp;of mankind. When he who reſts moral obligation on&nbsp;the will of God, ſpeaks of ſome actions as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">right</span><span class="font0"> and of&nbsp;others as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">wrong,</span><span class="font0"> he muſt mean that the former are&nbsp;agreeable to the divine will, however made known to&nbsp;men, and the latter diſagreeable to it ; and the man&nbsp;who deduces the laws of virtue from what he calls the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ftneſs of things,</span><span class="font0"> muſt have ſome </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">end in view,</span><span class="font0"> for which&nbsp;things are fit, and denominate actions </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">right</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">wrong</span><span class="font0"> as&nbsp;they tend to promote or counteract that end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But the word </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">right,</span><span class="font0"> uſed as a fubſtantive, has in common as well as in philoſophical language a ſignification •which at firſt view appears to be very different from this.&nbsp;&lt;It denotes a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">juſt claim</span><span class="font0"> or an </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">honeſt poſſeſſon,</span><span class="font0"> Thus we ſay,&nbsp;a father has a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">right</span><span class="font0"> to reverence from his children, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">•huſhand to the love and fidelity of his wife, and a king&nbsp;to the allegiance of his ſubjects. But if we trace theſe&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rights</span><span class="font0"> to their ſource, we ſhall find that they are all laws&nbsp;of moral obligation, and that they are called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rights</span><span class="font0"> only&nbsp;becauſe it is agreeable to the will of God, to the in-ſtinctive dictates of the moral ſenſe, or to the fitneſs of&nbsp;things, if ſuch a phraſe has any meaning, that children&nbsp;reverence their parents, that wives love their huſhands,&nbsp;and that ſubjects pay allegiance to their ſovereign. This&nbsp;will be apparent to any man who ſhall put to himſelf&nbsp;ſuch queſtions as theſe : “ </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Why</span><span class="font0"> have parents a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">right</span><span class="font0"> to&nbsp;Teverence from their children, huſhands to the love of</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">their wives, and ſovereigns to the allegiance of their ſubjects ?” As theſe queſtions contain in them nothing&nbsp;abſurd, it is obvious that they are each capable of a&nbsp;preciſe anſwer ; but it is impoſſible to give to any of&nbsp;them an anſwer which ſhall have any meaning, and not&nbsp;imply that </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">right</span><span class="font0"> arid </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">obligation</span><span class="font0"> are reciprocal, or, in&nbsp;other words, that wherever there is a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">right</span><span class="font0"> in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">one perſon,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">there is a correſponding </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">obligation</span><span class="font0"> upon </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">others.</span><span class="font0"> Thus&nbsp;to the queſtion, “ Why have parents a right to reverence from their children ?” it may be anſwered, “ be-caule, under God, they were the authors of their childrens being, and protected them from danger, and fur-niſhed them with neceſſaries,. when they were in a ſtate&nbsp;ſo helpleſs that they could do nothing for themſelves.”&nbsp;This anſwer conveys no other meaning than that there&nbsp;is an obligation upon children, in return for benefits&nbsp;received, to reverence their parents. But what is the&nbsp;ſource of this obligation ? It can only be the will of&nbsp;God, the moral ſenſe, or the fitneſs of things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This view of the nature of right will enable us to form a proper judgment of the aiſertionof a late writer,&nbsp;“ that man has no rights.” The arguments by which&nbsp;this apparent paradox is maintained, are not merely ingenious and plauſible ; they are abſolutely concluſive.&nbsp;But then our philofoρher, who never chooſes to travel&nbsp;in the beaten track, takes the word </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">right</span><span class="font0"> in a ſenfe ve-ry different from that in which it has been uſed by all&nbsp;other men, andconſiders it as equivalent to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">diſcretionary&nbsp;power,</span><span class="font0"> “ By the word </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">right</span><span class="font0"> (lays he) is underſtood a&nbsp;full and complete power of either doing a thing or&nbsp;omitting it, without the perſon’s becoming liable to ani-madverſion or cenſure from another ; that is, in other&nbsp;words, without lus incurring any degree of turpitude&nbsp;or guilt.” In this ſenſe of the word he affirms, and&nbsp;affirms truly, that a man has no rights, no diſcretionary&nbsp;power whatever, except in things of ſuch total indifference as, whether “ he ſhall fit on the right or on the&nbsp;left ſide of his fire, or dine on beef to day or tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A propoſition ſo evidently true as this ſtood not in need of argument to ſupport it ; but as his arguments&nbsp;are clearly expreſſed, and afford a complete confutation&nbsp;of ſome popular errors ſanctioned by the reſpectable&nbsp;phraſe </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rights of man,</span><span class="font0"> we ſhall give our readers an opportunity of ſtudying them in his own words.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ Political ſociety is founded on the principles of morality and juſtice. It is impoſſible for intellectual&nbsp;beings to be brought into coalition and intercourſe&nbsp;without a certain mode of conduct, adapted to their&nbsp;nature and connection, immediately becoming a duty&nbsp;incumbent on the parties concerned. Men would never have aſſociated il they had not imagined that, in&nbsp;conſequence of that aſlbciation, they would mutually&nbsp;conduce to the advantage and happineſs of each other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">I his is the real purpoſe, the genuine bafιs, of their intercourſe ; and, as far as this purpoſe is anſwered, ſo far does ſociety anſwer the end of its inſtſtution. There&nbsp;is only one poſtulate more that is neceſſary to bring us&nbsp;to a concluſive mode of reaſoning upon this ſubject.&nbsp;Whatever is meant by the term </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">right,</span><span class="font0"> there can neither&nbsp;be oppoſite rights, nor rights and duties hoſtile to each&nbsp;other. The rights of one man cannot claſh with or be&nbsp;deſtructive of the rights of another : for this, inſtead of&nbsp;rendering the ſubject an important branch of truth and&nbsp;morality as the advocates of the rights of man certain-</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
