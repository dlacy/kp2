Still valuable are his <hi rend="italic">Peintures inédites</hi> (1836) and his <hi rend="italic">Peintures de Pompéi</hi> (1844) <hi rend="italic">.</hi> He contributed to the <hi rend="italic">Annali</hi> of the Roman Institute, the <hi rend="italic">Journal des savants</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Académie des inscriptions.</hi> At his death on the 3rd of July 1854 Raoul Rochette was perpetual secretary of the Academy of Fine Arts and a corresponding member of most of the learned societies in Europe.</p>
