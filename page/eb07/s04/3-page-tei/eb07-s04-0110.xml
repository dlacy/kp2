A Treatise on Salts, writ ten in German.</p><p>STAINDROP, a town of Darlington ward in the county of Durham, 246 miles from London. It had once a market, which of late years has been disused. Near to it is the splendid mansion of the Duke of Cleveland, Raby Castle, built by John de Neville in 1378. The inhabitants of the town were, in 1801, 1156 ; in 1811, 1087 ; in 1821, 1273 ; and in 1831, 1478.</p><p>STAINES, a town in the hundred of Spelthorne and county of Middlesex, seventeen miles from London. It is on the left bank of the Thames, over which a stone bridge has recently been erected. Just above the bridge is the termination of the boundary of the London corporation on the river, marked by a stone, formerly by stones, from which the town takes its name. There is a good corn market on Friday, and several posting houses. The inhabitants were, in 1801, 1750; in 1811, 2042; in 1821, 1957 ; and in 1831, 2486.</p><p>STAIRCASE, in <hi rend="italic">Architecture,</hi> an ascent inclosed be tween walls, or a balustrade consisting of stairs or steps, with landing places and rails, serving to make a communication between the several storeys of a house. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Architecture.</hi></p><p>STALACTITES, in <hi rend="italic">Mineralogy,</hi> crystalline spars forra ed into oblong, conical, round, or irregular bodies, composed of various crusts, and usually found hanging in form of icicles from the roofs of grottoes, &amp;c.</p><p>STALBRIDGE, a town of the hundred of Brownshall and the division of Sherborne, in the county of Dorset, 112 miles from London. It has some trade in making stockings, and much good stone is found near to it The market is on Tuesday, but thinly attended. The inhabi tants were, in 1801, 1254; in 1811, 1421; in 1821, 1571; and in 1831, 1773.</p><p>STALE, among sportsmen, a living fowl put in a place to allure and bring others where they may be token. For want of these, a bird shot, his entrails taken out, and dried in an oven in his feathers, with a stick thrust through to keep it in a convenient posture, may serve as well as a live fowl.</p><p>STAMFORD, a town of Lincolnshire, in the hundreds of Ness and of Kesteven. It is eighty-five miles from Lon don, on the river Willand, which divides Lincolnshire from Northamptonshire ; and one of the parishes of the town, St. Martin’s, is in the latter county, and called the outparish. There are five parish churches, several of which have lofty spires. Two of them are so close together, as to resemble one building. St. Martin’s church contains some curious ancient monuments. In that parish stands Burleigh Hall, the magnificent residence of the marquis of Exeter. This town was in former times a more extensive place than it is at present, and contained fourteen churches, besides many religious houses; but it suffered severely by the wars between the houses of York and Lancaster, and has never re covered from those ravages. It is by no means well built, though of late its appearance lias been improved. Being in a rich district, it has good markets on Monday and Friday, and several fairs. The population was, in 1801, 4012 ; in 1811, 4582; in 1821, 5050; and in 1831, 5837.</p><p>STAMINA, in <hi rend="italic">Botany,</hi> are those upright filaments which, on opening a flower, we find within the corolla surrounding the pistillum. According to Linnæus, they are the male organs of generation, whose office it is to prepare the pollen. Each stamen consists of two distinct parts, viz. the filamentum and the anthera.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Stamina</hi>, in the animal body, are defined to be those simple original parts which existed first in the embryo or even in the seed ; and by whose distinction, augmentation, and accretion by additional juices, the animal body at its utmost bulk is supposed to be formed.</p><p>STAMPHALIA, one of the islands of Greece, in the Archipelago, about twenty-seven square miles in extent. The surface consists of a single bare mountain, from which numerous springs issue, that render the lower parts capable of cultivation, and some spots are highly fertile. It contains about 800 inhabitants, who raise sufficient bar ley, wine, and fruit, for their consumption, and a large quantity of onions, which is the principal source of their trade. In a small island close to it are the remains of an ancient temple of Apollo. The number of partridges is so considerable, that to prevent their increase, from 10,000 to 12,000 of their eggs are taken every Easter. In the island there is a small town of the same name. Lat. 36.35. Long.28.37.E,</p><p>STANCHIONS, a sort of small pillars of wood or iron, used for various purposes in a ship, as to support the decks, the quarter-rails, the nettings, the awnings, &amp;c. The first of those are two ranges of small columns fixed under the beams, throughout the ship’s length between decks ; one range being on the starboard and the other on the larboard side of the hatchways. They are chiefly intended to sup port the weight of the artillery.</p><p>STANDON, a town in the hundred of Braughen and county of Hertford, twenty-seven miles from London. It is on the river Kib, on the ancient Roman road, called Er mine Street. The parish church has an ancient altar, raised nearly ten feet above the level of the floor. On Friday there is a market, tolerably well attended. The population was, in 1801, 1846; in 1811, 1889; in 1821, 2135; and in 1831, 2272.</p><p>STANDRA, a village of Asiatic Turkey, on the western coast of Anatolia. Long. 27. 18. E. Lat. 36. 54. W.</p><p>STANHOPE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Phillip Dormer,</hi> the fourth <hi rend="smallcaps">Earl. of Chesterfield,</hi> was born at London, on the 22d of September 1694. He was the son of Philip, the third earl, by his wife, Lady Elizabeth Savile, daughter of George, marquis of Halifax. At the age of eighteen he was sent to Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where he studied assiduously, and, according to his own account, became an absolute pedant. In 1714 he quitted the university, and travelled on the con tinent, where a familiarity with good company soon convinced him he was totally mistaken in almost all his notions ; and an attentive study of the air, manner, and address of people of fashion, soon polished a man whose prominent de sire was to please, and who, as it afterwards appeared, valued exterior accomplishments beyond any other human acquirement. While Lord Stanhope, he obtained an early seat in parliament; and in 1722, succeeded to his father’s estate and titles. In 1728, and in 1745, he was appointed ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary to Holland. This high character he supported with the greatest dig nity, serving his own country, and gaining the esteem of the States-General. Upon his return from Holland, he was sent as lord-lieutenant of Ireland; and during his administration there, gave general satisfaction to all parties. He left Dublin in 1746, and in October succeeded the earl of Harrington as secretary of state, in which post he officiated un til February 6, 1748. In 1752, being seized with a deafness which incapacitated him for the pleasures of society, he from that time led a private and retired life, amusing himself with books and his pen ; in particular, he engaged largely as a volunteer in a periodical miscellaneous paper called <hi rend="italic">The World,</hi> in which his contributions have a distinguished degree of excellence. He died on the 24th of March 1773, leaving a character for wit and abilities that had few equals. He distinguished himself by his eloquence in parliament on many important occasions, of which we have a characteristic instance of his own relating. He was an active promoter of the bill for altering the style ; and on this occasion, as he himself writes in one of his letters to his son, he made so eloquent a speech in the house, that every one was pleased, and said he had made the whole very clear to them, “ when,”</p></body></text></TEI>
