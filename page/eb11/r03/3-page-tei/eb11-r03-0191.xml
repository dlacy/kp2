An alternative is the three-high mill, in which three rolls are used. Here the plate is run through the lower rolls and back through the upper ones, so that there is no reversal <hi rend="bold">of </hi>direction of the mill as a whole, but the Iower and upper’rolls draw the pIates in opposite directions (see also <hi rend="smallcaps">Iron and Steel,</hi>  § 129).</p><p><hi rend="italic">Plate-Mills,—</hi>In Great Britain plate-mills are generally two-high reversing mills, in America three-high mills. Another difference is that in British practice two stands of rolls are used, in America one only.. In the two-stand design there arc two sets of rolls coupled endwise, one set being grain-rolls for roughing, and the other chilled rolls for finishing. Sets of live rollers conduct the plates to and from the separate rolls. The plate-mills proper are those which roll from i in. to about 2 in. thick. Armour plate-mills are a special design for massive plates and sheet-mills are for thin plates or sheets having a less thickness than J in. Armour plate-mills are of two-high reversing type usually, with forged steel rolls. They are of immense proportions, the rollers ranging from 10 to 14 ft. in length, by from 3 to 4 ft. in diameter. In sheet-mills, on the other hand, the rolls seldom exceed 30 in. in diameter, and they are chilled. The size of sheet-mills has within the last few years been considerably increased (since the introduction of steel sheets), and all new mills are made from 28 to 30 in. diameter. The mills are of the two-high type and arc almost the only instance of the retention in present practice of the non-reversing mill. It is found more convenient in this case than the reversing or the three-high mills, because two men roll two pieces at once, one handing over a sheet just rolled to his fellow just as the latter has entered a sheet between the rolls on his side. Strip-mills are a smaller but similar type, used for rolling the thin narrow strips required for the hoops of barrels, ties for cotton bales, &amp;c. The details of these mills cannot be discussed here, nor the numerous arguments Jn favour of the two systems. English practice retains the two-high reversing mill for all heavy work, the exceptions being those just noted. American practice retains the three-high mill.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Grooved Rolls.—</hi>In the mills designed for rolling various sectional forms the same distinction between two-high and threedugh remains, but new problems arise. By “ sectional forms ” is meant all those which are qpt plates and sheets, such as bars of round and square section, angles, channels, rails and allied sections (fig. ï), for the production of which grooved rolls are required. . The shapes and proportions of these grooves are such that reduction is effected very gradually. WTen metal is squeezed or hammered, one effect is to spread it laterally, since the metal cannot be appreciably squeezed in on itself. But the lateral extension is very much less than</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
