<p><label>RUBY</label>
a genus of precious ſtones of various colours ; as, I. Of a deep red colour inclining a little to purple ; the <hi rend="italic">carbuncle</hi> of Pliny. 2. The ſpinell, of the colour of a bright corn poppy flower. 3. The balaſs or pale red inclining to violet ; ſuppoſed to be the mother of rubies. 4. The rubicell, of a reddiſh yellow. According to Cronſtedt, the ruby cryſtallifes into an oc-toedral form, as well as the diamond, from which it differs very little in hardneſs and w <hi rend="sup">τ</hi> eight, whence he concludes that they are both of the ſame nature ; but ſome late experiments have ſhown that the diamond differs exceſſively from all other gems, in being diſſipable by a ſſrong fire, which the ethers refill. Tavernier and Dutens inform us, that in the Eaſt Indies all coloured, gems are named <hi rend="italic">rubies,</hi> without regard to what their colours may be ; and that the particular colour is added to the name of each in order to diſtinguiſh them from one another. There are, however, ſome ſoft ſtones of this kind which they call <hi rend="italic">Lacan;</hi> and it is certain, that the hard and brilliant rubies named <hi rend="italic">oriental,</hi> as well as the ſapphires and topazes, are all the ſame, excepting only the circumſtance of colour. Some are partly red and partly blue, yellow, and ſome quite colourleſs. The ſpinell rubies are about half the value of diamonds of the ſame weight ; the balaſs is va lued at 30 ſhill.ings per carat. Tavernier mentions 108 rubies in the throne of the great Mogul, from 100 to 200 carats, and of a round one almoſt 2⅜ ounces: there is alſo mention made by other travellers of rubies exceeding 200 carats in weight. According to Dutens, a perfect ruby, if it w <hi rend="sup">r</hi> eighs more than 3⅜ carats, is of greater value than a diamond of the ſame weight. If it weighs one carat, it is worth 40 guineas; if two carats, 40 guineas ; three carats, 150 gui* neas ; if fix carats, upwards of 1000 guineas.</p><p>According to the experiments of Bergman and A-chard, the texture of the ruby is foliated' like that of diamonds ; it is ſufible with borax in a ſtrong and long continued heat, running into a tranſparent glaſs of a pale green colour : the ſame effect is produced by mi-crocoſmſe ſalt ; but with ſedative ſalt, or mineral or vegetable alkali, the glaſs is opaque and differently co* loured. From the experiments oſM. d’Arcct, it appears that the ruby does not loſe its colour in the greateſt fire ; but Henckel ſays, that, by means of a burning glaſs, he ſoftened it in ſuch a manner as to receive the impreſſion of a’ſeal of jaſper. It becomes electric by being rubbed. Its ſpecific gravity, according to Bergman, is from 3,180 to 4,240 ; but Briſſon tells us that it is 4,283. The ſpecific gravity of the ſpinell is 3,760, of the Brafilian ruby 3,53 1.</p><p>Rubies are met with in the Capelan mountains of Pegu in the Eaſt Indies ; and at Caos, ∆va, Bifnagâr, Calicut, Cananor, Ceilan, and Brafil. They are found in the ſands of rivers of a red colour, in an argillaceous earth of an hard texture and greeniſh colour : ſome* times they adhere to red rocks. The ſpinell rubies are met with in Hungary, Silefia, Bohemia, and Bra-fil. The balaſs comes principally from Braſil, though ſome are alſo brought from the Eaſt Indies. The ru--bicell comes alſo from Braſil, but are ſaid to loſe their colour in the fire. A variety of this gem, but of a ſoft quality, is found in great plenty on the ſea-ſhore near Ely in Fifeſhire, Scotland. There is alſo a ſtone</p>

<p>which comes near to the ruby found near Portfoy, Banffshire, and at Inverary, Argyleſhire, Scotland. The <hi rend="italic">rubino di rocca</hi> of the Italians is a true garnet of a deep red and violet, or of the amethyſt colour. What is called ruby of arſenic or of ſulphur is the realgar : the ruby of zinc is the red blend ; and the ruby of ſilver is the red ſilver ore.</p><p>Rubies may be artificially made from Braſilian topazes of a ſmoky appearance, by giving them a gradual heat in a crucible filled with aſhes, until it be red-hot.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Rock RυBr <hi rend="sub">i</hi></hi> the <hi rend="italic">amethyβi%ontas</hi> of the ancients, is found in Syria, Calcutta, Cananor, Cambaya, and E-Xhiopia. It is the moſt valued of all the ſpecies of garnets, and is frequently fold as a ruby under the name of <hi rend="italic">rubinus Ruβcurη.</hi> See Garnet and Ruby.</p>
