<p><label>RAJA</label>
(English form <hi rend="smallcaps">Rajah),</hi> Sanskrit nom. sing, of the stem <hi rend="italic">rdjan</hi> (in modern Indian vernaculars <hi rend="italic">raja, rajah, raja, rajan, rdzu, irdsen,</hi> also the forms <hi rend="italic">red, rdo, rdna</hi> are traceable to the same stem) = king, prince, chief, from the root <hi rend="italic">raj,</hi> to be resplendent. In the oldest times the headman of any petty tribe was called rhjh from the fact of his being conspicuous for the number of golden ornaments with which he was decked out. Then raja became the common designation for a king, whether of a small tribe or of a large state. The constitution of all states was monarchical, mostly hereditary, occasionally also electoral, but in no case absolute, for the people had a voice in the government. On the other hand, the king was greatly hampered in his action by his duties towards the priestly caste. Even in that later stage of Indian civilization which we find portrayed in the code of Manu the king appears as subordinate to the priest, though his prerogative is in all other respects paramount, especially in the matter of revenue. Theoretically this system has been continued ever since; but practically the rdj d’s powers have been gradually extended, some of them being distributed by him at his pleasure among various officials, who were rewarded, not by regular salaries, but by grants and the profits of oppression. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="1"> See for the Vedic period, H. Zimmer, <hi rend="italic">Altindisches Leben,</hi> Berlin, 1879, p. 162 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi> ; for later times, M. Duncker, <hi rend="italic">Geschichte des Alter-thuins,</hi> iii. 152 <hi rend="italic">sq.,</hi> and Tod’s <hi rend="italic">Antiquities of Rajasthan,</hi> passim. </note> It thus appears that the title is, strictly speaking, only applicable to Hindu potentates, but in practice it is not unfrequently used to indicate a ruling chief irrespective of his nationality or creed.</p><p>The rights and privileges assigned to rfijfis by treaty and usage are manifold and varied. But all rAjfis are precluded from waging war against an external foe save with the permission of the British Government, and so none can be said to be independent in the fullest sense of the word. At the same time there are several princes in India who titularly hold that status, in so far, that is, as they possess the right to administer their kingdom according to their own notions of justice and equity; but even in these instances, and they are few, British residents are attached to the various courts, charged to advise in the interests of good government and righteous dealing. Such officers seldom fail to secure a powerful influence, and it is not often that their counsel is disregarded or their representations pass unheeded. More than this, when flagrant injustice occurs the British Government is occasionally compelled to interfere, and instances are not wanting when a raja has been deposed, notwithstanding a clause in his treaty forbidding the intervention of the British Government in the affairs of his state. Such cases, which are not frequent, are justified by political necessity. In many instances native chiefs are allowed by treaty to maintain a military force, but at the present time the troops principally serve to gratify the cravings of Eastern potentates for the outward and visible signs of power.</p><p>Rdj4s of lesser note retain a semblance of power so far</p><p>as concerns questions of minor importance, but in grave cases involving issues of life and death the officer attached to the court reviews and, should it be necessary, modifies or reverses the decrees which may be passed. Chieftains in this category do not even enjoy the appearance of independence, though in many instances they are allowed to keep a body of military retainers.</p><p>Other r&amp;jds are merely large and wealthy landholders with no sovereign rights or privileges, resembling in many respects the territorial magnates of Great Britain; while in some instances the term is simply a title of distinction unconnected with the possession of land or power.</p><p>Scarcely less complex and varied are the conditions which regulate succession to the rAj ships of India : in some instances adoption is admitted, in other cases collateral succession is accepted, while again there are occasions when the customs of the family are a potent factor in the choice of an heir. It might have been supposed perhaps that the salute could be fairly taken as indicative of the status of the chief to whom it is assigned; but in reality such an assumption would be most misleading, for not unfrequently the number of guns was fixed in bygone years, and the lapse of time has made numerous and essential changes in the status of the various chieftains. So much is this the case that it has never been settled authoritatively what chiefs are entitled to claim the Western prefix of “highness.”</p>
