<p><span class="font0">Anna and the duke of Holstein, who took the name of Peter Feodorovich on assuming the Greek religion, and&nbsp;was declared heir to the throne. In 1744 he married the&nbsp;Princess Sophia of Anhalt-Zerbst, who by her baptism in&nbsp;the Orthodox Church became Catherine. Thus the line of&nbsp;descent was secured to the direct heirs of Peter the Great.&nbsp;In 1743, the armies of Elizabeth having gained some&nbsp;victories over the Swedes, the treaty of Abo was signed, by&nbsp;which Russia acquired the southern part of Finland, as far&nbsp;as the river Kiumen. The next event of importance is&nbsp;the war between Russia and Frederick the Great (1756-1762). In 1757 Apraksin crossed the frontier with 85,000&nbsp;Russians, occupied Eastern Prussia, and defeated Lewald&nbsp;at Gross-Jagersdorf ; but, instead of taking advantage of&nbsp;the victory, he soon afterwards retired behind the Niemen,&nbsp;having been tampered with by the grand-duchess Catherine&nbsp;and the chancellor Bestuzheff-Riumin. In 1758 Fermor,&nbsp;the Russian general, was completely defeated by Frederick&nbsp;at Zorndorf, but he was allowed to retreat without molestation. In 1759 Saltikoff beat the Prussians at Paltzig, and&nbsp;in the same year Frederick was obliged to submit to a&nbsp;greater defeat at Künersdorf, where he lost eight thousand&nbsp;men and one hundred and seventy-two cannon. It was&nbsp;on the loss of this battle that he meditated committing&nbsp;suicide. In 1760 the Russians entered Berlin, where&nbsp;they committed great havoc and destruction. “We have&nbsp;to do,” said Frederick, “with barbarians, who are digging&nbsp;the grave of humanity.” In the following year they took&nbsp;Pomerania. The cause of Frederick seemed on the verge&nbsp;of ruin ; he was saved by the death of Elizabeth in December 1761. The empress was an idle, superstitious woman&nbsp;of lax morals, who was greatly under the influence of&nbsp;favourites. Since the reign of Peter I. no successor had&nbsp;appeared worthy of him. Still Russia made more progress&nbsp;under Elizabeth than it had made under Anna. In 1755&nbsp;the university of Moscow, the oldest in the country, was&nbsp;founded through the influence of Ivan Shuvaloff. Literature made great advances, as will be seen below.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Elizabeth was succeeded by her nephew Peter, son of her sister Anna and Charles Frederick, duke of Holstein-Gottorp. He was suspected of German leanings, but his&nbsp;first measures made him very popular. In February 1762&nbsp;he published an ukaze by which the nobility were freed&nbsp;from the necessity of entering upon any state employment,&nbsp;and he abolished the secret chancery. On the other hand&nbsp;he acted in some matters injudiciously, and offended the&nbsp;prejudices of the Russians, as the false Demetrius had&nbsp;done a century and a half previously. He ridiculed some&nbsp;of the ceremonies of the Orthodox Church, and showed a&nbsp;fondness for the Lutheran. He introduced many German&nbsp;tactics into the army, and evinced a great preference for&nbsp;his German corps of Holsteiners. His personal habits&nbsp;were very coarse : he was constantly seen drunk. Moreover&nbsp;he sent out of the country many of the talented Frenchmen&nbsp;who had during the reign of Elizabeth been helping Russia&nbsp;to get rid of her barbarism. Frederick II. of Prussia, who&nbsp;was at his lowest depths after the battle of Künersdorf,&nbsp;now saw to his delight a complete change in the Russian&nbsp;policy. Peter was an ardent admirer of the Prussian&nbsp;sovereign ; in order to ensure peace, Frederick would have&nbsp;ceded Eastern Prussia ; but Peter dreamed of nothing of&nbsp;the kind ; he restored all the Russian conquests and formed&nbsp;an alliance with him, offensive and defensive. He lived&nbsp;very unhappily with his wife Catherine, and meditated&nbsp;divorcing her and imprisoning her for the rest of her life&nbsp;in a convent. The condition in which she passed her time&nbsp;may be seen from her memoirs, first published by Herzen,&nbsp;the authenticity of which there seems to be no reason to&nbsp;doubt. She, however, quietly waited her time, and a&nbsp;conspiracy was concocted in which she was assisted by the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Orloffs, Potemkin, the princess Dashkoff, and others (see PeteR III.). Leaving her residence at Peterhof, Catherine&nbsp;boldly put herself at the head of twenty thousand men.&nbsp;The miserable emperor abdicated without a struggle, and&nbsp;was soon afterwards secretly assassinated at Ropcha, near St&nbsp;Petersburg. Many of the details of this catastrophe are&nbsp;given in the interesting memoirs of the Princess Dashkoff,&nbsp;which were published by an English lady, Mrs W. Bradford, in 1840, having been taken down from her dictation.&nbsp;Thus had a German woman, by adroitly flattering the&nbsp;prejudices of the Russians, succeeded in making herself&nbsp;head of this vast empire. Two years afterwards Ivan VI.,&nbsp;who is said to have become an idiot from his long confinement at Schlüsselburg, was murdered by his guards on&nbsp;account of the attempt of a certain Lieutenant Mirovich to&nbsp;set him free. Whether Mirovich was incited to this adventure. by secret promises of the Government, so that there&nbsp;might be an excuse for the murder of Ivan, has never been&nbsp;clearly shown. He expiated his crime by public execution,&nbsp;and is said to have expected a reprieve till the last moment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Seven Years’ War was now over, and the next great European complications were to be concerned with the&nbsp;partition of Poland, throughout the struggles of which&nbsp;country the Russians were constantly interfering; but for&nbsp;a fuller discussion of this subject the reader must be&nbsp;referred to the article Poland. In 1767 Turkey, urged&nbsp;on by France, declared war against Russia ; the object was&nbsp;to aid the Poles by creating a diversion. The Russian&nbsp;general Golitzin attacked the grand vizier, took the town&nbsp;of Khotin (1769), and in the following year Rumantzoff&nbsp;defeated the khan of the Crimea, the Turkish feudatory&nbsp;and ally, and in 1770 won the great victory of Kagul.&nbsp;In 1771 Dolgoruki overran the Crimea, and Alexis Orloff&nbsp;defeated the Turks in a naval engagement at Chesme, on&nbsp;the coast of Asia Minor. In their naval expeditions the&nbsp;Russians were at this time greatly assisted by the number&nbsp;of Englishmen in their service. In 1774 was signed the&nbsp;peace of Kutchuk-Kainardji, whereby the sultan acknowledged the independence of the Mongols of the Crimea.&nbsp;The Russians thus detached this province from the sultan’s&nbsp;dominions, and after exercising a kind of protectorate over&nbsp;it added it to their own. He also ceded Azoff on the Don,&nbsp;Kinburn at the mouth of the Dniester, and all the fortified&nbsp;places of the Crimea. The Greeks, who had been induced&nbsp;to rise, were abandoned to the vengeance of the Turks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1771 the plague broke out at Moscow, and many of the inhabitants perished. The archbishop Ambrose was&nbsp;massacred in a popular tumult, while endeavouring to&nbsp;carry out some measures which were necessary for the&nbsp;preservation of the public health. Soon afterwards&nbsp;occurred the rebellion of Pugatcheff, a Cossack of the Don,&nbsp;who declared himself to be the emperor Peter III. The&nbsp;czar, he alleged, had escaped from the hands of his would-be murderers, and would soon regain his throne. A large&nbsp;band of disaffected peasants and Raskolniks gathered round&nbsp;him, and he was joined by many of the Mongol races, who&nbsp;were inimical to the Russian rule. At first the generals&nbsp;sent against him were defeated. The rebel’s path was&nbsp;everywhere marked with bloodshed and pillage ; he even&nbsp;got possession of several towns, including Kazan. Had he&nbsp;been something more than a vulgar assassin he might have&nbsp;made Catherine tremble on her throne, but his cruelties&nbsp;estranged his more moderate followers. He was afterwards beaten by Bibikoff and others, and finally surrendered&nbsp;by his accomplices to Suwaroff. He was taken to Moscow&nbsp;in an iron cage and there publicly executed in 1775,&nbsp;together with four of his principal followers. In the same&nbsp;year the empress put an end to the republic, as it was&nbsp;called, of the Zaporogian Cossacks. A great codification&nbsp;of the laws took place under Catherine, which may be</span></p>
