The population is almost entirely rural; only two towns contain over 5000 inhabitants each, viz., Deoghar, which is the only municipality, with a population of 8015, and Shaliebgunge with 6512. The administrative headquarters are at Naya Dumka.</p><p>Rice forms the staple crop of the Santal Parganás, and is largely grown in the alluvial strip of country which runs along the eastern boundary of the district, other crops are millets, wheat, barley, maize, various pulses and oil-seeds, jute, flax, sugar-cane, cotton, and indigo. The district is singularly destitute of any local manufactures: iron is roughly smelted by Kol settlers from Chutia Nagpur; coarse cloth is woven as a domestic manufacture, and bell-metal utensils are made to a small extent; indigo is also manufactured. The trade is carried on by means of permanent markets. Exports consist chiefly of rice, Indian corn, oil seeds, tasar-silk cocoons, lac, Small-sized timber, and hill bamboos; while European piece goods, salt, and brass or bell-metal utensils for household use compose the bulk of the imports. In 1883-84 the gross revenue of the district amounted to £45,437, of which the land- tax yielded £22,556.</p><p>The Santáls have been known to the British since the latter part of the 18th century. In 1832 two Government officials were deputed to demarcate with solid masonry pillars the present area of the Daman-i-Koh, or skirts of the hills. The permission to Santáls to settle in the valleys and on the lower slopes of the Daman stimulated Santal immigration to an enormous extent. The Hindu money-lender soon made his appearance amongst them, and led to the rebellion of 1855-56. The insurrection was not quelled without bloodshed, but it led to the establishment of a form of administration congenial to the immigrants ; and a land settlement has since been carried out on conditions favourable to the occupants of the soil.</p><p>SANTA MARIA. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Capua.</hi></p><p>SANTA MAURA, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Leucadia</hi> (Λευκάδα, ancient Λευκάς), one of the Ionian Islands, with an area of 110 square miles and a population (1880) of 25,000 (20,892 in 1870), lies off the coast of Acarnania (Greece), immediately south of the entrance to the Gulf of Arta. It first appears in history as a peninsula <hi rend="italic">(Odyssey,</hi> xxiv. 378), and, if the statements of ancient authorities be accepted literally, it owed its existence as an island to the Corinthians, whose canal across the isthmus was again, after a long period of disuse opened up by the Romans. But it is probable rather that Leucas was then as now separated from the mainland by a shallow lagoon (two feet or less). During the English occupation a canal for boats of four to five feet draught was formed from Fort Santa Maura to the town, but the 16-feet-deep ship canal which it was proposed (1844) to carry right across the lagoon or submerged isthmus to Fort Alexander was only partially excavated. @@<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> Santa Maura, measuring about 20 miles from north to south and 5 to 8 miles in breadth, is a rugged mass of limestone and bituminous shales (partly Tertiary), rising in its principal ridges to heights of 2000 and 3000 feet, and presenting very limited areas of level ground. The grain crop suffices only for a few months’ local consumption; but olive oil of good quality is produced to the extent of 30,000 to 50,000 barrels per annum; the vineyards (in the west especially) yield 100,000 barrels of red wine (bought mainly by Rouen, Cette, Trieste, and Venice); the currant, introduced about 1859, has gradually come to be the principal source of wealth (the crop averaging 2,500,000 lb); and small quantities of cotton, flax, tobacco, valonia, &amp;c., are also grown. The salt trade, formerly of importance, has suffered from Greek customs regulations. Though to a large extent unlettered and superstitious, the inhabitants are industrious and well- behaved. The chief town (5000 inhabitants) properly called Amaxikhi, but more usually Santa Maura, after the neighbouring fort, is situated at the north-east end of the island opposite the lagoon. In the south-west is the village of Vasiliki, where a wharf protected by a mole</p><p><hi rend="superscript">@@@1</hi> As a six hours’ shortening of the steam-passage between the Levant and the Adriatic would be effected by such a channel the scheme has again been taken up. According to M. Pyat, the engineer employed to report, the dredging could be done for 1,200,000 francs.</p><p>was built in 1877-78 for shipping the currant crop. Remains of Cyclopean and polygonal walls exist at Kaligoni (south of Amaxikhi), probably the site of the ancient acropolis of Neritus (or Nericus), and of the later and lower Corinthian settlement of Leucas. From this point a Roman bridge seems to have crossed to the mainland. Between the town and Fort Santa Maura extends a remarkably fine Turkish aqueduct partly destroyed along with the town by the earthquake of 1825. Forts Alexander and Constantine commanding the bridge are relics of the Russian occupation; the other forts are of Turko- Venetian origin. The magnificent cliff, some 2000 feet high, which forms the southern termination of the modern island still bears the substructions of the temple of Apollo Leucatas (hence the modern name Capo Ducato). At the annual festival of Apollo a criminal was obliged to plunge from the summit into the sea, where, however, an effort was made to pick him up; and it was by the same heroic leap that Sappho and Artemisia, daughter of Lygdamis, are said to have ended their lives.</p><p>SANTANDER, a province in the north of Spain, on the shores of the Bay of Biscay, bounded on the E. by Biscaya, on the S. by Burgos and Palencia, and on the W. by Leon and Oviedo. The area is 2113 square miles. The province is mountainous in character, being traversed from east to west by the Cantabrian chain, which in the Picos de Europa reaches a height of over 8700 feet, and sends off numerous branches to the sea. On the north side of the range the streams are all short, the principal being the Ason, the Miera, the Pas, the Besaya, the Soja, and the Nansa, which flow into the Bay of Biscay; part of the province lies to the southward of the watershed, and is drained by the upper Ebro. The valleys of Santander are fertile, and produce various kinds of grain, maize, pulse, hemp, flax, and vegetables. Oranges, lemons, grapes, figs, and other fruits flourish, and forests of oak, chestnut, walnut, and fir cover the hills. Rich pasturage for cattle and swine and a good supply of game are also found among them, and the fisheries along the coast are likewise productive. Foreign capital has been successfully applied to the development of lead, coal, and iron mines ; and the mountains contain quarries of limestone, marble, and gypsum, and abound with mineral springs. The district was part of the Roman province of Cantabria, which, after passing under the empire of the Goths, became the principality of the Asturias. The portion called Asturia de Santa Juliana, or Santillana, was included in the kingdom of Old Castile, and, on the subdivision of the old provinces of Spain in 1833, became the province of Santander. The people are of a purer race than in parts of Spain subjected by the Moors, and both in mental and physical qualities show their Teutonic ancestry. The industries of the country are consequently in a flourishing condition, and, besides the natural products above mentioned, there are foundries, breweries, distilleries, tanneries; cotton, linen, cloth, and flour mills; brick and tile works; and manufactories of hats, soap, buttons, preserves, and chocolate. The province is traversed from north to south by the railway and high road from Santander by Palencia to Madrid ; the highest point on the railway (Venta de Pazozal) is 3229 feet above the sea. For purposes of administration the province is divided into eleven partidos judiciales, containing 103 ayuntamientos, and returns two senators and five deputies to the cortes. The population in 1877 numbered 235,299, Besides Santander, the capital, the only places having within the municipal boundaries a population exceeding 5000 are Castro- Urdidles (7623), Valle de Pielagos (5500), Torrelavega (7192), and Valderredible (7240). Santoña has 4428, and Laredo 4384. Santillana (1776) has a fine Roman</p></body></text></TEI>
