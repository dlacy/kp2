<p><span class="font0">thus his utmost efforts only attain a sort of composition ' between the true and the fictitious, just as the dress ot&nbsp;Lear, as performed on the stage, is neither that of a modem sovereign, nor the cerulean painting and bear-hide&nbsp;with which the Britons, at the time when that monarch is&nbsp;supposed to have lived, tattooed their persons, and sheltered&nbsp;themselves from cold. All this inconsistency is avoided by&nbsp;adopting the style of our grandfathers and great-grandfathers,&nbsp;sufficiently antiquated to accord with the antiquated character of the narrative, yet copious enough to express all that&nbsp;is necessary to its interest, and to supply that deficiency of&nbsp;colouring which the more ancient times do not afford.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ It is no doubt true that The Old English Baron, written in the latter and less ambitious taste, is sometimes tame&nbsp;and tedious, not to say mean and tiresome. The total absence of peculiar character (for every person introduced is&nbsp;rather described as one of a genus than as an original, discriminated, and individual person) may have its effect in&nbsp;producing the tedium which loads the story in some places.&nbsp;This is a general defect in the novels of the period, and it&nbsp;was scarce to be expected that the amiable and accomplished authoress, in her secluded situation, and with acquaintance of events and characters derived from books&nbsp;alone, should have rivalled those authors who gathered their&nbsp;knowledge of the human heart from having, like Fielding&nbsp;and Smollett, become acquainted, by sad experience, with&nbsp;each turn of ‘ many-coloured life.’ Nor was it to be thought&nbsp;that she should have emulated in this particular her prototype Walpole, who, as a statesman, a poet, and a man of&nbsp;the world, ‘ who knew the world like a man,’ has given&nbsp;much individual character to his sketch of Manfred. What&nbsp;we here speak of is not the deficiency in the style and costume, but a certain creeping and low line of narrative and&nbsp;sentiment ; which may be best illustrated by the grave and&nbsp;minute accounting into which Sir Philip Harclay and the&nbsp;Baron Fitzowen enter, after an event so unpleasant as the&nbsp;judgment of heaven upon a murderer, brought about by a&nbsp;judicial combat, and that combat occasioned by the awful&nbsp;and supernatural occurrences in the eastern chamber, where&nbsp;we find the arrears of the estate gravely set off against the&nbsp;education of the heir, and his early maintenance in the baron’s family. Yeteven these prolix, minute, and unnecessary details are precisely such as would occur in a similar&nbsp;story told by a grandsire or grandame to a circle assembled&nbsp;round a winter’s fire ; and while they take from the dignity&nbsp;of the composition, and would therefore have been rejected&nbsp;by a writer of more exalted imagination, do certainly add&nbsp;in some degree to its reality, and bear in that respect a resemblance to the art with which De Foe impresses on his&nbsp;readers the truth of his fictions, by the insertion of many&nbsp;minute and immaterial or unnatural circumstances, which&nbsp;we are led to suppose could only be recorded because they&nbsp;are trae. Perhaps, to be circumstantial and abundant in&nbsp;minute detail, and, in one word, though an unauthorized&nbsp;one, to be somewhat </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">prosy,</span><span class="font0"> is a secret mode of securing a&nbsp;certain necessary degree of credulity from the hearers of a&nbsp;ghost-story. It gives a sort of quaint antiquity to the&nbsp;whole, as belonging to the times of <sup>,</sup> superstitious elde ;’&nbsp;and those whom we have observed to excel in oral narratives of such a nature, usually study to secure the attention&nbsp;of their audience by employing this art. At least, whether&nbsp;owing to this mode of telling her tale, or to the interest of&nbsp;the story itself, and its appeal to the secret reserve of superstitious feeling which maintains its influence in most&nbsp;bosoms, The Old English Baron has always produced as&nbsp;strong an effect as any story of the kind, although liable to&nbsp;the objections which we have freely stated, without meaning to impeach the talents of the amiable authoress.” (a.)</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">REFORM means a change from worse to better, a reestablishment or revival of former neglected discipline, or a correction of abuses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">REFORMATION is, in general, the act of reforming or correcting an error or abuse in religion, discipline, or the&nbsp;like. By way of eminence, the word is used for that great&nbsp;alteration and reformation in the corrupted system of Christianity, commenced by Luther in the year 1517.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Before the period of the Reformation, the pope had declared himself the sovereign of the whole world. All the parts of it which were inhabited by those who were not Christians, he accounted the same as if they were uninhabited ;&nbsp;and if those who called themselves Christians resolved on&nbsp;occupying any of those countries, he gave them full liberty&nbsp;to make war upon the inhabitants without any provocation.&nbsp;The countries, if conquered, were to be parcelled out according to the pope’s pleasure ; and dreadful was the situation of&nbsp;that prince who refused to obey the will of the sovereign&nbsp;pontiff In consequence of this extraordinary authority which&nbsp;the pope had assumed, he at last granted to the king of Portugal all the countries to the eastward of Cape Nun in Africa,&nbsp;and to the king of Spain all the countries to the westward&nbsp;of that point or headland. In this, according to the opinions&nbsp;of some, was completed in his person the character of Antichrist sitting in the temple of God, and showing himself&nbsp;as God (2 Thess. ii. 4). He had long before, say they, assumed in spiritual matters the supremacy belonging to the&nbsp;Deity himself ; and now he assumed the same supremacy in&nbsp;temporal affairs, giving the extreme regions of the earth to&nbsp;whomsoever he pleased. The Reformation, therefore, they&nbsp;consider as the immediate effect of divine power taking&nbsp;vengeance on this and all other deviations from the system&nbsp;of truth ; whilst others regard it merely as an effect of natural causes, which might have been foreseen and prevented,&nbsp;without abridging the papal power in any considerable degree.</span></p>
