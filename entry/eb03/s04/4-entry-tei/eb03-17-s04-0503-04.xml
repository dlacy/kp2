( Thomas), profeſſor of mathematics at the royal academy at Woolwich, fellow of the Royal Society, and member of the Royal Academy at Stockholm, was born at Market Boſworth in Leiceſterſhire in 1710. His father, a ſtuff-weaver, taught him only to read Engliſh, and brought him up to his own busineſs ; but meeting with a ſcientifical pedlar, who like- wise practiſed fortune-telling, young Simpſon by his aſſiſtance and advice left off weaving, and professed aſtrology. As he improved in knowledge, however, he grew diſguſted with his pretended art ; and renouncing it, was driven to ſuch difficulties for the ſubſiſtence of his family, that he came up to London, where he worked as a weaver, and taught mathematics at his ſpare hours. As his ſcholars increaſed, his abilities became better known, and he publiſhed his Treatiſe on Fluxions, by ſubſcription, in 1737 : in 1740, he publiſhed his Treatiſe on the Nature and Laws of Chance ; and Eſſays in Speculative and Mixed Mathematics. After theſe appeared his Doctrine of Annuities and Reverſions ; Mathematical Dissertations ; Treatiſe on Algebra ; Elements of Geometry ; Trigonometry, Plane and Spherical ; Select Exerciſes ; and his Doctrine and Application of Fluxions, which he professes to be rather a new work, than a ſecond edition of his former publication on fluxions. In 1743, he obtained the mathematical profeſſorſhip at Woolwich academy ; and ſoon after was choſen a member of the Royal Society, when the preſident and council, in conſideration of his moderate circumſtances, were pleaſed to excuſe his admission-<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0510.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s04-0504"/>
fees, and his giving bonds for the ſettled future payments. At the academy he exerted all his abilities in inſtructing the pupils who were the immediate objects of his duty, as well as others whom the ſuperior officers of the ordnance permitted to be boarded and lodged in his houſe. In his manner of teaching he had a peculiar and happy addreſs, a certain dignity and perſpicuity, tempered with ſuch a degree of mildness, as engaged the attention, eſteem, and friendſhip, of his ſcholars. He therefore acquired great applauſe from his ſuperiors in the diſcharge of his duty. His application and cloſe confinement, however, injured his health. Exerciſe and a proper regimen were preſcribed to him, but to little purpose : for his ſpirits sunk gradually, till he became incapable of performing his duty, or even of reading the letters of his friends. The effects of this decay of nature were greatly increaſed by vexation of mind, owing to the haughty and inſulting behaviour of his ſuperior the firſt proſeſſor of mathematics. This perſon, greatly his inferior in mathematical accompliſhments, did what he could to make his ſituation uneaſy, and even to depreciate him in the public opinion : but it was a vain endeavour, and only ſerved to depreſs himſelf. At length his phyſicians adviſed his native air for his recovery, and he ſet out in February 1761; but was ſo fatigued by his journey, that upon his arrival at Boſworth, he betook himſelf to his chamber, and grew continually worſe till the day of his death, which happened on the 14th of May, in the 51st year of his age.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
