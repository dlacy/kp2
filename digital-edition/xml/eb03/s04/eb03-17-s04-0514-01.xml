Σιτοφυλαέ formed from οιτος “corn,” and φυλαέ, " keeper,” in antiquity, an Athenian magistrate, who had the ſuperintendence of the corn, and was to take care that nobody bought more than was neceſſary for the proviſion of his family. By the Attic laws, particular perſons were prohibited from buying more than fifty meaſures of wheat a man ; and that ſuch perſons might not purchaſe more, the ſitophylax was appointed to ſee the laws properly executed. It was a capital crime to prevaricate in it. There were 15 of theſe <hi rend="italic">ſitophylaces,</hi> ten for the city, and five for the Pireaeus.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
