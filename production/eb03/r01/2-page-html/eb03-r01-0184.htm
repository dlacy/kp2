<p><span class="font0">foreſt trees were unable to vvithſtand thc fury of the tempeſt. The hail was compofed of enormous, iolid,&nbsp;and angular pieces office, ſome of them weighing from&nbsp;eight to ten ounces. The conntry people, beaten down&nbsp;in the fields on their way to church, amidſt this concuf-ſion of the elements, concluded that the laſt day was arrived ; and ſcarcely attempting to extricate themfelves,&nbsp;lay defpairing and half ſuffocated amidſt the water and&nbsp;the mud, expecting the immediate diffolution of all&nbsp;things. The ſtorm was irregular in its devaſtations.&nbsp;while ſeveral rich diſtricts were laid entirely waſte,&nbsp;ſome intermediate portions of country were comparatively little injured. Οηε of 6o ſquare leagues had not&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font0">fingle ear of corn or a fruit of any kind left, of the&nbsp;66 pariſhes in the diſtrict of Pontoiſe, 43 were entirely&nbsp;defolated, and of the remaining 23 ſome loſt two-thirds&nbsp;and others half their harveſt. The iſle of France, be-ing the diſtrict in which Paris is ſituated, and the Ογ-leannois, appear to have ſuffered chiefly. The damage there, upon a moderate eſtimate, amounted to&nbsp;80,000,000 of livres, or between three and four millions Sterling. Such a calamity muſt at any period&nbsp;have been ſeverely felt ; but occurring on the eve of a&nbsp;great political revolution, and amidſt a general ſcarcity&nbsp;throughout Europe, it was peculiarly unfortunate, and&nbsp;gave more embarraſſment to the government than per-haps any other event whatever. Numbers of families&nbsp;found it neceſſary to contract their mode of living for a&nbsp;time, and to diſmifs their ſervants, who were thus left&nbsp;deſtitute of bread. Added to the public difcontent and&nbsp;political diſſenſions, it produced ſuch an effect upon the&nbsp;people in general, that the nation ſeemed to have changed its character ; and inſtead of that levity by which&nbsp;it had ever been diſtinguiſhed, a fettled gloom now&nbsp;feemed fixed on every countenance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The ſpring of the year 1789 was a period of much political anxiety in France. The ſuperior orders wiſhed to reduce the power of the crown, but were jealous&nbsp;oſ their own privileges, and determined to retain them;&nbsp;while the popular philoſophers and others were endeavouring to render them odious, and to rouſe the people&nbsp;to a love of freedom. Still, however, the great body&nbsp;of the common people remained careleſs fpectators of&nbsp;the ſtruggle and unconſcious of the approaching commotion. Such was their indifference, that few of them&nbsp;took the trouble even to attend and vote at the elections&nbsp;of the deputies to the ſtates-general. In many places,&nbsp;where a thouſand voters were expected, not fifty came&nbsp;forward ; but ſuch of them as did appear ſhowed that a&nbsp;feed was fown which might one day rife into important&nbsp;fruits. In the inſtructions which they gave to their&nbsp;deputies, the Britiſh conſtitution was in general the&nbsp;model of what they wiſhed their government to be.&nbsp;They demanded equal taxation, the abolition of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">lettres&nbsp;de cachet</span><span class="font0"> or arbitrary impriſonment, the refponſibility of&nbsp;miniſters, and the extinction of the feudal privileges of&nbsp;the nobles ; but they wiſhed that the whole three orders of the ſtate ſhould fit and vote in one houſe, well&nbsp;knowing that their nobility were not prepared to act&nbsp;the moderate part of a Britiſh houſe of lords. The&nbsp;nobles, on the contrary, although willing to renounce&nbsp;ſome of their pecuniary privileges, and to ſacrifice the&nbsp;power of the crown, were moſt deciſively reſolved neither to ſurrender their feudal prerogatives nor the right&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font0">fitting in three feparate affemblies; by means of which&nbsp;each </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">of the orders could </span><span class="font0">eaſily reſiſt </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">the encroachments&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">of the other two. Mr Neckar has been improperly cen-fured for not deciding this laſt important queſtion pre-vious to the meeting of the ſtates-gencral : but it muſt&nbsp;be obſerved, that the very purpoſe of calling that aſſembly vzas to overturn the unjuſt privileges of the&nbsp;higher orders through its medium, and without any di-rect interpoſition on the part of the miniſters. Had&nbsp;the king poſitively decided in favour of three chambers,&nbsp;the nobles and the clergy would have retained all thoſe&nbsp;ancient abuſes eſtabliſhed in their own favour, of which&nbsp;it was his wiſh to deprive them, and the crown and its&nbsp;prerogatives would have been the only objects of ſacri-fice. It w<sup>τ</sup>as therefore thought ſafer to leave the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">tiers&nbsp;etat</span><span class="font0"> to fight its own battle : nor was it yet imagined&nbsp;that the commons of France, depreſſed and poor, and&nbsp;diſperſed by ſituation over a multitude of provinces,&nbsp;could ever unite in enterpriſes dangerous to tire ſove-reign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The ſtates had been ſummoned to meet at verfailles on the 27th of April, and moſt of the deputies arrived&nbsp;at that time ; but the elections for the city of Paris&nbsp;not. being concluded, the king deferred the commencement of their ſeffions till the 4th of May. During&nbsp;this period, the members, left in idleneſs, began to find&nbsp;out and form acquaintance with each other. Among&nbsp;others, a few members from Brittany (Bretagne) form-ed themſelves into a club, into which they gradually ad-mitted many other deputies that were found to be zea-lous for the popular cauſe, and alſo many perſons who&nbsp;were not deputies. This ſociety, thus originally eſta-bliſhed at verfailles, was called the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Comité Breton;</span><span class="font0"> and&nbsp;was one day deſtined, under the appellation of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(fa-cobin Club,</span><span class="font0"> to give laws to France, and to diſſuſe terror&nbsp;and alarm throughout Europe. Οη the other fide, the&nbsp;ariſtocratic party eſtabliſhed conferences at the houſe of&nbsp;Madame Polignac, for the purpoſe, it is ſaid, of uniting&nbsp;the nobles and the clergy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">An event occurred at this time which all parties aſcri-bed to ſome malicious motive. In the populous ſuburb of St Antoine, a M. Reveillon carried on a great paper&nbsp;manufactory. A falſe report was ſpread that he intended to lower the wages of his workmen, and that he&nbsp;had declared bread was too good for them, and that&nbsp;they might ſubſiſt very well on potato-flour. A corn-motion was raifed, he was burnt in effigy, and his houſe&nbsp;was thereafter burnt and pillaged by the mob, who&nbsp;were not diſperſed till the military had been called in,&nbsp;and much carnage enſued. The popular party aſſerted&nbsp;that the commotion had been artfully excited by the&nbsp;party of the queen and the Count D’Artois, to afford&nbsp;a pretence for bringing great bodies of the military to&nbsp;the neighbourhood to overawe the ſtates-general, or induce the king more decifively to reſolve on affembling&nbsp;that body at verfailles, in preference to Paris, where&nbsp;they and the popular miniſter M. Neckar wiſhed it to&nbsp;be held.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Ο11 the 4th of May the ſtates-general aſſembled at verfailles. They commenced bufineſs by going in a&nbsp;folemn proceſſion, preceded by the clergy, and foliow-ed by the king, according to ancient cnſtom, to church,&nbsp;to perform an act of devotion. The nobles were ar-rayed in a ſplendid robe, and they and the higher cler-gy glittered in gold and jewels. The commons ap-peared in black, the drefs belonging to the law.
