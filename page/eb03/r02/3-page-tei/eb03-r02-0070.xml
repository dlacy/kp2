PRACTICAL INFERENCES.</p><p>HAVING thus eſtabliſhed a theory of a moſt important part of hydraulics, which may be confided in as a juſt repreſentation of nature’s procedure, we ſhall apply it to the examination of the chief reſults of every thing which art has contrived for limiting the operations of nature, or modifying them ſo. as to luit our particular views. Trailing to the detail which we have given of the connecting principles, and the chief circumſtanceswhich co-operatein producing the oſtenſible effect ; and ſuppoſing that ſuch of our readers as are intereſted in this ſubject will not think it too much trouble to make the applications in the ſame detail ; we ſhall content ourſelves with merely pointing out the ſteps of the proceſs, and ſhowing their foundation in the theory itſelf : and frequently, in place of the direct ana-lyiis which the theory enables us to employ for the fo.-lution of the problems, we ſhall recommend a proceſs of approximation by trial and correction, ſufficiently accurate, and more within the reach of practical engineers. We are naturally led to conſider in order the following, articles.</p><p>I. The effects of permanent additions of every kind to the waters of a river, and the moſt effectual methods of preventing or removing inundations.</p><p>2. The effects of weirs, bars, ſluices, and keeps of every kind, for railing the ſurface of a river ; and the ſimilar effects of bridges, piers, and every thing which contracts the ſection of the ſtream.</p><p>3. The nature of canals ; how they differ from rivers in reſpect of origin, diſcharge, and regimen, and what conditions are neceſſary for their moſt perfect conſtruc-tion.</p><p>4. Canals for draining land, and drafts or canals of derivation from the main ſtream. The principles of their conſtruction, ſo that they may fuit their intended purpoſes,. and the change which they produce on the main ſtream, both above and below the point of derivation.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Of the effects of permanent additions to the waters of a river.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">From what has been ſaid. already, it appears that to every kind of foil or bed there correſponds a certain velocity of current, too ſmall to hurt it by digging it up, and too great to allow the depoſition of the materials which it is carrying along. Suppofing this known for any particular ſituation, and the quantity of water which the channel muſt of neceſſity diſcharge, we may wiſh to learn the ſmalleſt ſlope which muſt be given to this ſtream» that the waters </hi>may run with the required velocity.

Therefore we have √b—Lv<hi rend="sup">z</hi>j-f∙ 1,6= 9—2,36,-664 ; whereas it ſhould have been,=.9. Therefore ſay 6,64 : 9.-9 :12,2 nearly. Now ſuppoie that yT is = 12,2. Then L. 12,2-∣- 1,6 = Li3,8, =2,625 nearly, and 12,2—262y is 9^575, whereas it ſhould be 9. Now we find that changing the value ofv<hi rend="sup">z</hi><hi rend="italic">s</hi>  from 9 to 12,2 has changed the anſwer from 6,64 to 9,575, or a change of 3,2 in our afo ſumption has made a change of 2,935 *<hi rend="sup">n t</hi>he anſwer, and has left an error of 0,575.
