<p><span class="font0">Corvinus governor of Syria, he </span><span class="font1">marched </span><span class="font0">into the province of Aſia, properly ſo called, and there took up his winter·quarters. He ſpent the whole winter in ſettling the affairs of the ſeveral provinces of Aſia Minor&nbsp;and the adjacent iſlands ; and early in the ſpring paſſed&nbsp;into Greece, whence he ſet out for Rome, which he&nbsp;entered in the month Sextilis, afterwards called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Augufl,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">in three triumphs, which were celebrated ſor three days&nbsp;together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">And now Octavianus was at the height of his wiſhes, ſole ſovereign, ſole maſter, of the whole Roman empire.&nbsp;But, on the other hand, the many dangers which attend an uſurped powder, appearing to him in a ſtronger&nbsp;light than ever, filled his mind with a thouſand perplexing thoughts. The natural aversion of the Romans to&nbsp;a kingly government, their love of liberty, and the ides&nbsp;of March, when his father Julius was murdered in full&nbsp;ſenate by thoſe very men whom he thought the moſt&nbsp;devoted to his perſon, made him ſear there might ariſe&nbsp;another Brutus, who, to reſtore liberty to his country,&nbsp;might aſſaſſinate him on his very throne. This he knew&nbsp;had happened to Julius Cæſar; whereas Sylla, after&nbsp;having laid down the authority he had uſurped, died&nbsp;peaceably in his bed in the midſt of his enemies. The&nbsp;paſſion of ſear outweighed in his ſoul the charms of a&nbsp;diadem, and inclined him to follow the example of Sylla. He was indeed very unwilling to part with his&nbsp;authority ; but ſear began to get the better of his ambition. However, before he came to any reſolution,&nbsp;he thought it adviſable to conſult his two moſt intimate&nbsp;and truſty friends, Agrippa ând Mæcenas ; the former&nbsp;no leſs famous for his probity than his valour ; and the&nbsp;latter a man of great penetration, and generally eſteemed the moſt reſined politician of his age. Agrippa enlarged on the&quot; many and almoſt inevitable dangers which&nbsp;attend monarchy, inſupportable to a free people, and to&nbsp;men educated in a commonwealth. He did not forget&nbsp;the examples of'Sylla and Cæſar; and cloſed his&nbsp;ſpeech with exhorting Octavianus to convince the&nbsp;world, by reſtoring liberty to his country, that the&nbsp;only motive for his taking up arms was to revenge&nbsp;his father’s death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Mæcenas, on the other hand, remonſtrated to him, that he had done too much to go back ; that, after&nbsp;ſo much bloodſhed, there could be no ſafety for him&nbsp;but on the throne ; that, if he diveſted himſelf of the&nbsp;ſovereign power, he would be immediately proſecuted&nbsp;by the children and friends of the many illuſtrious perſons whom the misfortunes of the times had forced him&nbsp;to ſacriſice to his ſafety ; that it was abſolutely neceſſary for the welfare and tranquillity of the republic,&nbsp;that the ſovereign power ſhould be lodged in one perſon, not divided among many, &amp;c. Octavianus thanked&nbsp;them both for their friendly advice, but ſhowed himſelf&nbsp;inclined to follow the opinion of Mæcenas ; whereupon&nbsp;that able miniſter gave him many wiſe inſtructions and&nbsp;rules of government, which are related at length by Dio&nbsp;Caſſius, and will ever be looked upon as a maſterpiece in&nbsp;politics. Among other things he told him, That he could&nbsp;not fail of being ſucceſsful in all his undertakings, happy in his lifetimc, and famous in hiſtory after his death,&nbsp;if he never deviated from this rule ; to wit, To govern&nbsp;ethers as he would wiſh to be governed himſelf, had he&nbsp;been born to obey and not to command. He added,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">That if, in taking upon him the ſovereign power, he dreaded the name of king, a name ſo odious in a commonwealth, he might content himſelf with the title of&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Caſar</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Imperator,</span><span class="font0"> and under that name, which was&nbsp;well known to the Romans, enjoy all the authority of&nbsp;a king.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This advice Octavianus followed, and from that time laid aſide all thoughts of abdicating the ſovereign power;&nbsp;but, to deceive the people into a belief that they ſtill&nbsp;enjoyed their ancient government, he continued the old&nbsp;magiſtrates, with the ſame name, pomp, and ornaments,&nbsp;but with juſt as much power as hc thought fit to leave&nbsp;them. They were to have no military power, but only their old juriſdiction of deciding finally all cauſes,&nbsp;except ſuch as were capital ; and though ſome of theſe&nbsp;laſt were left to the governor of Rome, yet the chief&nbsp;he reſerved for himſelf. He paid great court to the&nbsp;people : the very name that covered his uſurpation was&nbsp;a compliment to them ; for he affected to call </span><span class="font1">it </span><span class="font0">the&nbsp;power of the tribuneſhip, though he acted as abſolutely&nbsp;by it as if he had called it the dictatorial power. He&nbsp;likewiſe won the hearts of the populace by cheapneſs of&nbsp;proviſions and plentiful markets ; he frequently entertained them with ſhows and ſports; and by theſe means-kept them in good-humour, and made them forget&nbsp;uſurpation, ſlavery, and every public evil ; people in&nbsp;eaſe and plenty being under no temptation of inquiring&nbsp;into the title of their prince, or reſenting acts of power&nbsp;which they do not immediately feel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As for the ſenate, he filled it with his own creatures, raiſing the number of the conſcript fathers to iooo.&nbsp;He ſupplied ſeveral poor ſenators with money out of&nbsp;the treaſury to diſcharge the public offices, and on all&nbsp;occaſions affected an high regard for that venerable&nbsp;body ; but at the ſame time diveſted them of all power,&nbsp;and reduced them to mere cyphers. To prevent them&nbsp;from raiſing new’ diſturbances in the diſtant provinces, he&nbsp;iſſued an edict, forbidding any ſenator to travel out of&nbsp;Italy without leave, except ſuch as had lands in Sicily,&nbsp;or Narbonne Gaul, which at that time comprehended&nbsp;Languedoc, Provence, and Dauphiny. To theſe provinces, which were near Italy, and in a perfect ſtate of&nbsp;tranquillity, they had full liberty to retire when they&nbsp;pleaſed, and live there upon their eſtates. Before he&nbsp;ended his ſixth conſulſhip, he took a cenſus of the people, which was 41 years after the laſt ; and in this the&nbsp;number of the men fit to bear arms amounted to </span><span class="font1">463,000,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">the greateſt that had ever been found before. He likewiſe celebrated the games which had been decreed by the&nbsp;ſenate for his victory at Actium ; and it was ordered,&nbsp;that they ſhould be celebrated every fifth year, four colleges of prieſts being appointed to take care of them ;&nbsp;to wit, the pontifices, the augurs, the ſeptemvirs, and&nbsp;quindecimvirs. The more to gain the affections of the&nbsp;people, he annulled, by one edict, the many ſevere and&nbsp;unjuſt laws which had been enacted during the triumvirate. He raiſed many public buildings, repaired&nbsp;the old ones, and added many ſtately ornaments to the&nbsp;city, which at this time was, if we may give credit to&nbsp;ſome ancient writers, about </span><span class="font1">50 </span><span class="font0">miles in compaſs, and&nbsp;contained near four millions of fouls, reckoning men,&nbsp;women, children, and ſlaves. He attended buſineſs, reformed abuſes, ſhowed great regard for the Roman&nbsp;name, procured public abundance, pleaſure, and jollity,</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
