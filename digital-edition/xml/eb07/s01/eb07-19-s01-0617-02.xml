an island of the Archipelago, situated in long. 34. 0. E. and lat 37. 32. N. It was famous in antiquity for a battle fought there between the Greek and Persian fleets. In this engagement, which was one of the most memorable actions we find recorded in history, the Grecians lost forty ships, and the Persians two hundred, besides a great many more which were taken, with all the men and ammunition on board.</p><p>The island of Salamis is of a very irregular shape ; it was reckoned eight or ten miles in length, reaching west ward as far as the mountains called <hi rend="italic">Kerata</hi> or <hi rend="italic">The Horns.</hi> Pausanias informs us that on one side of this island stood in his time a temple of Diana, and on the other a trophy for a victory obtained by Themistocles, together with the temple of Cychreus, the site of which is now thought to be occupied by the church of St Nicholas.</p><p>The city of Salamis was demolished by the Athenians, because in the war with Cassander it surrendered, from disaffection, to the Macedonians. In the second century, when it was visited by Pausanias, some ruins of the Agora or market-place remained.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
