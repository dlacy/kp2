        <body>
            <p>ridge of the back marked with a black ſtreak; each ſide with a pale yellow ſtripe,
                bounded above and below with a line of black; head, body, and tail, of a reddiſh
                brown; the tail the darkeſt: breaſt and belly white; noſe and feet pale-red; eyes
                full. —Inhabits the north of Aſia, but found in the greateſt abundance in the
                foreſts of North America. They never run up trees except they are purſued, and find
                no other means of eſcaping: they burrow, and form their habitations under ground,
                with two entrances, that they may get acceſs to the one in caſe the other is ſtopped
                up. Their retreats are formed with great ſkill, in form of a long gallery, with
                branches on each ſide, each of which terminates in an enlarged chamber, as a
                magazine to ſtore their winter proviſion in; in one they lodge the acorns, in
                another the maize, in a third the hickery nuts, and in the laſt their favourite food
                the chinquapin cheſnut. They very ſeldom ſtir out during winter, at leaſt as long as
                their proviſions laſt; but if that fails, they will dig into cellars where apples
                are kept, or barns where maize is ſtored, and do a great deal of miſchief; but at
                that time the cat deſtroys great numbers, and is as great an enemy to them as to
                mice. During the maize harveſt theſe ſquirrels are very buſy in biting off the ears,
                and filling their mouths ſo full with the corn, that their cheeks are quite
                diſtended. It is obſervable that they give great preference to certain food; for if,
                after filling their mouths with rye, they happen to meet with wheat, they fling away
                the firſt, that they may indulge in the laſt. They are very wild, bite ſeverely, and
                are ſcarcely ever tamed; the ſkins are of little uſe, but are ſometimes brought over
                to line cloaks.</p>
            <p> 6. The <hi rend="italic">glis</hi>, or fat ſquirrel, with thin naked ears; body
                covered with ſoft aſh-coloured hair; belly whitiſh; tail full of long hair: from
                noſe to tail, near fix inches; tail, four and a half: thicker in the body than the
                common ſquirrel. —Inhabits France and the ſouth of Europe; lives in trees, and leaps
                from bough to bough; feeds on fruits and acorns; lodges in the hollows of trees;
                remains in a torpid ſtate during winter, and grows very fat. It was eſteemed a great
                delicacy by the Romans, who had their gliraria, places conſtructed to keep and feed
                them in.</p>
            <p> 7. The <hi rend="italic">ſagitta,</hi> or arrow ſquirrel, with a ſmall round head,
                cloven upper lip: ſmall blunt ears, two ſmall warts at the utmoſt corner of each
                eye, with hairs growing out of them: neck ſhort: four toes on the fore feet; and
                inſtead of a thumb, a ſlender bone two inches and a half long, lodged under the
                lateral membrane, ſerving to ſtretch it out: from thence to the hind legs extends
                the membrane, which is broad, and a continuation of the ſkin of the ſides and belly:
                there are five toes on the hind feet; and on all the toes, ſharp compreſſed bent
                claws: the tail is covered with long hairs diſpoſed horizontally: colour of the
                head, body, and tail, a bright bay; in ſome parts inclining to orange: breaſt and
                belly of a yellowiſh white: length from noſe to tail, eighteen inches; tail,
                fifteen. —Inhabits Java, and others of the Indian iſlands: leaps from tree to tree
                as if it flew: will catch hold of the boughs with its tail. Niewhoff, p. 354.
                deſcribes this under the name of the flying cat, and ſays the back is black.</p>
            <p> 8. The <hi rend="italic">volans,</hi> or flying ſquirrel, with round naked ears,
                full black eyes, and a lateral membrane from the fore to the hind legs: tail with
                long hairs diſpoſed horizontally, longeſt in the middle: its colour above, a
                browniſh aſh; beneath, white tinged with yellow: much leſs than the common ſquirrel.
                Inhabits Finland, Lapland, Poland, Ruſſia, North America, and New Spain: lives in
                hollow trees: ſleeps in the day: during the night is very lively: is gregarious,
                numbers being found in one tree: leaps from bough to bough ſometimes at the diſtance
                of ten yards: this action has improperly been called flying, for the animal cannot
                go in any other direction than forward; and even then cannot keep an even line, but
                ſinks conſiderably before it can reach the place it aims at: ſenſible of this, the
                ſquirrel mounts the higher in proportion to the diſtance it wiſhes to reach: when it
                would leap, it ſtretches out the forelegs, and extending the membranes becomes
                ſpecifically lighter than it would otherwiſe be, and thus is enabled to ſpring
                further than other ſquirrels that have not this apparatus. When numbers leap at a
                time, they ſeem like leaves blown off by the wind. Their food the ſame as the other
                ſquirrels. They are eaſily tamed: bring three or four young at a time. See fig. 3
                &amp; 4, the one repreſenting the animal in what is called a <hi rend="italic"
                    >fifing,</hi> the other in a <hi rend="italic">fitting,</hi> poſture.</p>
            <p>SCIURUS, in botany A genus of the monogynia order, belonging to the diandria claſs of
                plants; and in the natural method ranking with thoſe that are doubtful. The calyx is
                quinquedentate; the corolla bilabiated; the filaments are barren; the capſules five,
                and joined together; bivalved, unilocular, with one feed. Of this there is one
                ſpecies, viz. <hi rend="italic">aromatica,</hi> a native of Guiana.</p>
            <p>SCLAVONIA, a country of Europe, between the rivers Save, the Drave, and the Danube.
                It is divided into ſix counties, viz. Poſegra, Zabrab, Creis, Waraſden, Zreim, and
                Walpon, and belongs to the houſe of Auſtria. It was formerly called a <hi
                    rend="italic">kingdom</hi>; and is very narrow, not being above 75 miles in
                breadth; but it is 300 in length, from the frontiers of Auſtria to Belgrade. The
                eaſtern part is called <hi rend="italic">Ratzia,</hi> and the inhabitants <hi
                    rend="italic">Ratzians.</hi> Theſe, from a particular notion, are of the Greek
                church. The language of Sclavonia is the mother of four others, namely, thoſe of
                Hungary, Bohemia, Poland, and Ruſſia.</p>
            <p>SCLERANTHUS, in botany: A genus of the digynia order, belonging to the dodecandria
                claſs of plants, and in the natural method ranking under the 22d order, <hi
                    rend="italic">Caryophyllei.</hi> The calyx is monophyllous; there is no corolla;
                there are two ſeeds contained in the calyx.</p>
            <p>SCLERIA, in botany: A genus of the tetrandria order, belonging to the monoecia claſs

                numerous; the ſeed a ſort of nut, ſmall, oblong, and ſhining. There are ſix ſpecies,
                all of them natives of the Weſt Indies.</p>
            <p>SCLEROTICS, medicines proper to harden and conſolidate the fleſh of the parts to
                which they are applied; as purſlain, houſe-leek, flea-wort, garden night-ſhade,
                &amp;c.</p>
            <p>SCOLOPAX, in ornithology, a genus belonging to the order of grallae. The back is
