<p><span class="font1">that while the book is a unity the author made free use of older materials. Later, in his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Apostolic Age</span><span class="font1"> (1886, 2nd ed. 1892), he&nbsp;specifies these additions as vii. 1-8 </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">(a.d.</span><span class="font1"> 64-66), x.-xi. 1-13&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(circa </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font1"> 67), xii. 1-11,12-17 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(circa</span><span class="font1"> 69), xiii. (time of Vespasian),&nbsp;xvii. (time of Domitian).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Sabatier </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Les Origines littéraires . . . de Vapocalypse,</span><span class="font1"> 1888) regards the book as a unity into which its author had. introduced older Jewish materials not always consistent with their new&nbsp;contexts, such as xi. 1-13, xii.-xiii., xiv. 6-20, xvi. 13, 14, 16,&nbsp;xvii. i-xix. 2, xix. 11-xx. 10, xxi. 9-xxii. 5. The author wrote x.&nbsp;with a view to adapting xi. 1-13 to its new context. Schoen&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(UOrigine de Vapocalypse,</span><span class="font1"> 1887) attached himself in the main&nbsp;to the scheme of Sabatier. Both these writers assign thc&nbsp;Apocalypse to the reign of Domitian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The labours of these scholars, though to the superficial student they seem to prove that everything is possible and nothing&nbsp;certain, have certainly thrown great light on the literary&nbsp;character of the Apocalypse. Though differing in detail, they&nbsp;tend to show that, while the book is the production of one author,&nbsp;all its parts are not of the same date, nor are they one and all&nbsp;his first-hand creation. For many of the facts, the discovery of&nbsp;which we owe to the literary critics, have made the assumption&nbsp;of an absolute unity in the details of the Apocalypse a practical&nbsp;impossibility. Incongruities manifest themselves not only&nbsp;between certain sections and the main scheme of the book, but&nbsp;also between these and their immediate contexts. These sections&nbsp;are vii. i-8a, xi. 1-13, xii., xiii., xvii., xviii., xx., xxi. 9-xxii. 5.&nbsp;Some of these sections (xi., xii., xiii., xvii.) contain elements&nbsp;that cannot be explained from any of the above methods. The&nbsp;symbols and myths in these are not the creation of the writer,&nbsp;but borrowed from the past, and in not a few instances the&nbsp;materials are too foreign to his subject to lend themselves to&nbsp;his purpose without the help of artificial and violent expedients.&nbsp;For the elucidation of these foreign elements a new method—&nbsp;the traditional-historical—is necessary, and to the brilliant&nbsp;scholar Gunkel we owe its origination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">iv. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Traditional-historical Method.—</span><span class="font1">Gunkel </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Schöpfung und&nbsp;Chaos in Urzeit und Endzeit; eine religions geschichtliche U ntcr-suchung über Gen. I und Joh. 12,</span><span class="font1"> 1895) opened up new lines of&nbsp;investigation. He criticizes sharply (pp. 173 sqq., 233 sqq.)&nbsp;former methods of interpretation, and with the ardour of a&nbsp;discoverer of a new truth seeks to establish its currency throughout the entire field of apocalyptic. To such an extreme does&nbsp;he carry his theory that he denies obvious references to historical personages in the Apocalypse, when these are clothed in&nbsp;apocalyptic language. Thus he refuses to recognize Nero in&nbsp;the beast and its number. But apart from its extravagances,&nbsp;his theory has undoubted elements of truth. It is true that&nbsp;tradition largely fixes the form of figures and symbols in apoca&nbsp;Iyptic. Yet each new apocalypse is to some extent a reinterpretation of traditional material, which the writer uses not&nbsp;wholly freely but with reverence from the conviction that they&nbsp;contained the key to the mysteries of the present and the past.&nbsp;From this standpoint it may be argued that every apocalypse&nbsp;is in a certain sense pseudonymous; for the materials are not&nbsp;the writer’s own, but have come down to him as a sacred deposit&nbsp;—full of meaning for the seeing eye and the understanding heart.&nbsp;On the other hand, since much of the material of an apocalypse&nbsp;is a reinterpretation, it is necessary to distinguish between its&nbsp;original meaning and the new turn given to it in the Apocalypse.&nbsp;At times details in the transmitted material are unintelligible&nbsp;to our author, and these in some cases he omits referring to&nbsp;in his interpretation. The presence of such details is strong&nbsp;evidence of the writer’s use of foreign material.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As an illustration of his theory Gunkel seeks at great length to establish the Babylonian origin of chap. xii. of the Apocalypse.&nbsp;His investigation tends to show that in the course of tradition&nbsp;cosmological myths are transformed into eschatological dogmas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The above method was adopted by Boussct in his work </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Der Antichrist in der Überlieferung des Judenthums, des Neuen&nbsp;Testaments, und der alten Kirche</span><span class="font1"> (1895), in which he sought to&nbsp;show that a fixed tradition of the Antichrist originating in</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Judaism can be traced from New Testament times down to thc middle ages, and that this tradition was in the main unaffected&nbsp;by the Apocalypse, though in chap. xi. the Apocalypse shows&nbsp;dependence on it. Next in 1896 he published his commentary&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Die Offenbarung Johannis</span><span class="font1"> (2nd cd. 1906). In this work he&nbsp;availed himself of the results of the past and followed the three&nbsp;approved methods—the contemporary-historical, the fragmentary and the traditional-historical.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Julicher </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Einleitung in das Neue Testament<sup>4</sup>,</span><span class="font1"> 1901, pp. 204-29) adopts the same three methods of interpretation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Holtzmann </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Einleitung in das N.T J,</span><span class="font1"> 1892; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hand-Commentar<sup>1</sup>, </span><span class="font1">1893; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lehrbuch der NTlichen Theol.,</span><span class="font1"> i. 463-76) holds mainly to&nbsp;the contemporary-historical method in his earlier works, though&nbsp;recognizing signs of a double historical background; but in his&nbsp;last work the importance of tradition as a source of thc writer’s&nbsp;materials is fully acknowledged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In 1902 O. Pfleiderer in the second edition of his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Urchristentum </span><span class="font1">(1902, pp. 281-335) abandoned his former view on the Apocalypse&nbsp;and followed essentially the lines adopted by Bousset, though&nbsp;the details are differently treated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the same year Porter’s able article on “ Revelation ” appeared in Hastings’ </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Dictionary</span><span class="font1"> (iv. 239-66), and in&nbsp;1905 his still fuller treatment of the same theme in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Messages of the Apocalyptical Writers,</span><span class="font1"> 169-294. To these works the&nbsp;present writer is indebted for many a suggestion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A small commentary (no date) by Andcrson Scott follows in some measure the lines laid down in Bousset and Porter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Psychological Method.—</span><span class="font1">It might be supposed that all possible methods had now been considered, and that a combination&nbsp;of the three methods which have established their validity&nbsp;in relation to the interpretation of the Apocalypse would be&nbsp;adequate to the solution of all the problems of the book, but this&nbsp;is not so; for even when each in turn has vindicated the provinces in the book that rightly belong to it, and brought intelligibility into these areas, there still remain outlying regions w'hich&nbsp;they fail to illumine. It is not indeed that these methods have&nbsp;not claimed to solve the questions at issue, but that their&nbsp;solutions have failed to satisfy the larger body of reasonable&nbsp;criticism. The main problem, which so far has not been satisfactorily solved, may be shortly put as follows: Are the visions&nbsp;in the Apocalypse the genuine results of spiritual experiences, or&nbsp;are they artificiaI productions, mere literary vehicles of the&nbsp;writer’s teaching? Weizsäcker unhesitatingly advocates the&nbsp;latter view. But the serious students of later times find themselves unable to follow in his footsteps. The writer’s belief in&nbsp;his prophetic office and his obvious conviction of the inviolable&nbsp;sanctity of his message make it impossible to accept Weizsackeris&nbsp;opinion. Nor is it possible to accept Gunkel’s theory in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Schöpfung und Chaos</span><span class="font1"> as an adequate explanation, who explained&nbsp;the author’s conviction of the truth of his message as springing always from the fact that he was dealing with traditional&nbsp;material. This theory, which we have already dealt with in&nbsp;other connexions, is undoubtedly helpful, but here we require&nbsp;something more, and Gunkel has in consequence of WeineFs&nbsp;work </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Wirkungen des Geistes und der Geister,</span><span class="font1"> 1899) subsequently&nbsp;acknowledged that actual spiritual experiences lie behind some&nbsp;of the visions in apocalyptic (Kautzsch, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pseud, des A.T.,</span><span class="font1"> ii.&nbsp;341 sqq.). The fact of such visionary experience can hardly&nbsp;be questioned: the only difficulty Hes in determining to what&nbsp;extent it underlies the revelations of apocaIyptic. For a short&nbsp;discussion of this question wæ might refer to Bousset’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Offenbarung Johannis<sup>i</sup>,</span><span class="font1"> pp. 8 sqq., and Porter’s article on <sup>44</sup> Revelation ” in Hastings’ </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Dictionary,</span><span class="font1"> iv. 248 sqq.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Methods of Interpretation.—</span><span class="font1">As a result of the preceding inquiry we conclude that the student of the Apocalypse must make use of the following methods—the contemporary-historical, the literary-critical (fragmentary hypothesis), the&nbsp;traditional-historical and the ^psychological. Each of these&nbsp;has its legitimate province, and the extent of this province can&nbsp;in most cases be defined with reasonable certainty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Plan and Detailed Criticism of the Book.—</span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Two</span><span class="font1"> theories have been advanced to explain the plan and order of the book. The</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
