<p><span class="font3">the Protestant revolt would be complete without some allusion to the contrast between the course of affairs in France and in&nbsp;the neighbouring countries. The French monarchy, as we have&nbsp;seen, had usually succeeded in holding its own against the&nbsp;centralizing tendencies of the pope. By the Pragmatic Sanction&nbsp;of Bourges (1438) it had secured the advantages of the conciliar&nbsp;movement. In 1516, after Francis I. had won his victory at&nbsp;Marignano, Leo X. concluded a new concordat with France,&nbsp;in which, in view of the repudiation of the offensive Pragmatic&nbsp;Sanction, the patronage of the French Church was turned over,&nbsp;with scarce any restriction, to the French monarch, although&nbsp;in another agreement the annates were reserved to the pope.&nbsp;The encroachments—which had begun in the time of Philip the&nbsp;Fair—of the king’s lawyers on the ancient ecclesiastical jurisdiction, had reached a point where there was little cause for&nbsp;jealousy on the part of the State. The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">placet</span><span class="font3"> had long prevailed,&nbsp;so that the king had few of the reasons, so important in Germany&nbsp;and England, for quarrelling with the existing system, unless&nbsp;it were on religious grounds. France had been conspicuous in&nbsp;the conciliar movement. It had also furnished its due quota&nbsp;of heretics, although no one so conspicuous as Wycliffe or Huss.&nbsp;Marsiglio of Padua had had Frenchmen among his sympathizers&nbsp;and helpers. The first prominent French scholar to “ preach&nbsp;Christ from the sources ” was Jacques Lefèbvre of Etaples, who&nbsp;in 1512 published a new Latin translation of the epistles of St&nbsp;Paul. Later he revised an existing French translation of both&nbsp;the New Testament (which appeared in 1523, almost contemporaneously&nbsp; with Luther’s German version) and, two years&nbsp;later, the Old Testament. He agreed with Luther in rejecting&nbsp;transubstantiation, and in believing that works without the&nbsp;grace of God could not make for salvation. The centre of&nbsp;Lefèbvre’s followers was Meaux, and they found an ardent&nbsp;adherent in Margaret of Angoulême, the king’s sister, but had no&nbsp;energetic leader who was willing to face the danger of disturbances&nbsp;. Luther’s works found a good many readers in France,&nbsp;but were condemned (1521) by both the Sorbonne and the parlement of Paris. The parlement appointed a commission to discover&nbsp;and punish heretics; the preachers of Meaux fled to Strassburg,&nbsp;and Lefèbvre’s translation of the Bible was publicly burned. A&nbsp;council held at Sens, 1528-29, approved all those doctrines of the&nbsp;old Church which the Protestants were attacking, and satisfied&nbsp;itself with enumerating a list of necessary conservative reforms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">After a fierce attack on Protestants caused by the mutilation of a statue of the Virgin, in 1528, the king, anxious to conciliate&nbsp; both the German Protestants and anti-papal&nbsp;England, invited some of the reformers of Meaux&nbsp;to preach in the Louvre. An address written by&nbsp;a young man of twenty-four, Jean Cauvin (to&nbsp;become immortal under his Latin name of Calvinus)&nbsp;was read by the rector of the university. It was&nbsp;a defence of the new evangelical views, and so&nbsp;aroused the Sorbonne that Calvin was forced to flee from&nbsp;Paris. In October 1534, the posting of placards in Paris&nbsp;and other towns, containing brutal attacks on the Mass and&nbsp;denouncing the pope and the “ vermin ” of bishops, priests&nbsp;and monks as blasphemers and liars, produced an outburst of&nbsp;persecution, in which thirty-five Lutherans were burned, while&nbsp;many fled the country. The events called forth from Calvin,&nbsp;who was in Basel, the famous letter to Francis which forms&nbsp;the preface to his </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Institutes of the Christian Religion.</span><span class="font3"> In this&nbsp;address he sought to vindicate the high aims of the Protestants,&nbsp;and to put the king on his guard against those mad men who&nbsp;were disturbing his kingdom with their measures of persecution.*&nbsp;The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Institutes,</span><span class="font3"> the first great textbook of Protestant theology,&nbsp;was published in Latin in 1536, and soon (1541) in </span><span class="font1">a </span><span class="font3">French&nbsp;version. The original work is much shorter than in its later&nbsp;editions, for, as Calvin says, he wrote learning and learned&nbsp;century </span><span class="font0">elapsed before the Concordat was abrogated by the Separation&nbsp; Law of 1905 which suppressed all government appropriations&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">for </span><span class="font0">religious purposes and vested the control of Church property&nbsp;in “ associations for public worship ” (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">associations cultuelles),</span><span class="font0"> to be&nbsp;composed of </span><span class="font3">from </span><span class="font0">seven </span><span class="font3">to twenty-five members according to </span><span class="font0">the </span><span class="font2">size of the commune.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">writing. His address had little effect on the king. The parlements issued a series of edicts against the heretics, culminating in the very harsh general edict of Fontainebleau, sanctioned&nbsp;by the parlement of Paris in 1543. The Sorbonne issued&nbsp;a concise series of twenty-five articles, refuting the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Institutes</span><span class="font3"> of&nbsp;Calvin. This statement, when approved by the king and his&nbsp;council, was published throughout France, and formed a clear test&nbsp;of orthodoxy. The Sorbonne also drew up a list of prohibited&nbsp;books, including those of Calvin, Luther and Melanchthon;&nbsp;and the parlement issued a decree against all printing of Protestant literature. The later years of Francis’s reign were&nbsp;noteworthy for the horrible massacre of the Waldenses and the&nbsp;martyrdom of fourteen from the group of Meaux, who were&nbsp;burnt alive in 1546. When Francis died little had been done, in&nbsp;spite of the government’s cruelty, to check Protestantism, while&nbsp;a potent organ of evangelical propaganda had been developing&nbsp;just beyond the confines of France in the town of Geneva.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In its long struggle with its bishops and with the dukes of Savoy, Geneva had turned to her neighbours for aid, especially to Bern, with which an alliance was concluded&nbsp;in 1526. Two years later Bern formally sanctioned&nbsp;the innovations advocated by the Protestant preachers,&nbsp;and although predominantly German assumed the&nbsp;rôle of protector of the reform party in the Pays&nbsp;de Vaud and Geneva. William Farel, one of the group of&nbsp;Meaux, who had fled to Switzerland and had been active in&nbsp;the conversion of Bern, went to Geneva in 1531. With the&nbsp;protection afforded him and his companions by Bern, and&nbsp;the absence of well-organized opposition on the part of the&nbsp;Roman Catholics, the new doctrines rapidly spread, and by&nbsp;1535 Farel was preaching in St Pierre itself. After a public&nbsp;disputation in which the Catholics were weakly represented,&nbsp;and a popular demonstration in favour of the new doctrines,&nbsp;the council of Geneva rather reluctantly sanctioned the&nbsp;abolition of the Mass. Meanwhile Bern had declared war&nbsp;on the duke of Savoy, and had not only conquered a great&nbsp;part of the Pays de Vaud, including the important town of&nbsp;Lausanne, but had enabled Geneva to win its complete independence&nbsp;. In the same year (September 1536), as Calvin&nbsp;was passing through the town on his way back to Strassburg&nbsp;after a short visit in Italy, he was seized by Farel and induced&nbsp;most reluctantly to remain and aid him in thoroughly carrying&nbsp;out the Reformation in a city in which the conservative sentiment&nbsp; was still very strong. As there proved to be a large&nbsp;number in the town councils who did not sympathize with the&nbsp;plans of organization recommended by Calvin and his colleagues&nbsp;, the town preachers were, after a year and a half of&nbsp;unsatisfactory labour, forced to leave Geneva. For three years&nbsp;Calvin sojourned in Germany; he signed the Augsburg Confession, gained the friendship of Melanchthon and other leading&nbsp;reformers, and took part in the religious conferences of the&nbsp;period. In 1541 he was induced with great difficulty to surrender&nbsp; once more his hopes of leading the quiet life of a scholar,&nbsp;and to return again to Geneva (September 1541), where he&nbsp;spent the remaining twenty-three years of his life. His ideal&nbsp;was to restore the conditions which he supposed prevailed&nbsp;during the first three centuries of the Church’s existence; but&nbsp;the celebrated Ecclesiastical Ordinances adopted by the town&nbsp;in 1541 and revised in 1561 failed fully to realize his ideas, which&nbsp;find a more complete exemplification in the regulations governing&nbsp; the French Church later. He wished for the complete&nbsp;independence and self-government of the Church, with the&nbsp;right of excommunication to be used against the ungodly. The&nbsp;Genevan town councils were quite ready to re-enact all the old&nbsp;police regulations common in that age in regard to excessive&nbsp;display, dancing, obscene songs, &amp;c. It was arranged too that&nbsp;town government should listen to the “ Consistory,” made up of&nbsp;the “ Elders,” but the Small Council was to choose the members&nbsp;of the Consistory, two of whom should belong to the Small&nbsp;Council, four to the Council of Sixty, and six to the Council of&nbsp;Two Hundred. One of the four town syndics was to preside over&nbsp;its sessions. The Consistory was thus a sort of committee of</span></p>
