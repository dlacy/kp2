As the sediment thickens at the bottom, they drain off the water four or five times, by inclining the vessel, but without passing it through the sieve. What remains at bot tom is the starch, which is cut in pieces to be taken out, and is left to dry in the sun.

It stands on the navigable river Ihna, in a fertile district, is surrounded with walls, and contains 1164 houses, with 9050 inhabitants, who are employed in making linen and woollen goods, hosiery, hats, leather, soap, and tobacco, and in brewing and distillation. It was formerly the capital of Pomerania. Lat. 52.20. 42. Long. 15.13. E.</p><p>STARITZA, a town of Russia, in the province of Mos cow and government of Twer. It is the capital of a circle of the same name, containing seventy-seven parishes, with 83,800 inhabitants. It is 378 miles from Petersburg, and stands on the river Wolga, where the river Staritza joins that stream. It contains six churches, 650 houses, and 3860 in habitants, whose chief trade is in hemp sent to Petersburg, and in making shoes and gloves. Lat.56.48. Long. 35.22. E.</p><p>STARK, <hi rend="smallcaps">William</hi>, was born at Manchester in the month of July 1740 ; but the family from which he sprang was Scotish, and respectable for its antiquity. One of his uncles, John Stark, was minister of Lecropt in Perthshire ; and it was under the care of this gentleman that he receiv ed the rudiments of his education, which, when we consider the character of the master, and reflect on the relation between him and his pupil, we may presume was calculated to store the mind of the latter with those virtuous prnciples which influenced his conduct through life. From Lecropt young Stark was sent to the university of Glasgow, where, under the tuition of Dr. Smith and Dr. Black, with other eminent masters, he learned the rudiments of science, and acquired that mathematical accuracy, that logical precision, and that contempt of hypotheses, with which he prosecuted all his future studies. Having chosen physic for his profession, he removed from the university of Glasgow to that of Edinburgh, where he was soon distinguished, and honour ed with the friendship of the late Dr. Cullen ; a man who was not more eminently conspicuous for the superiority of his own genius, than quick-sighted in perceiving, and liberal in encouraging, genius in his pupils. Having finished his studies at Edinburgh, though he took there no degree, Mr. Stark, in the year 1765, went to London, and devoted himself entirely to the study of physic and the elements of surgery ; and looking upon anatomy as one of the principal pillars of both these arts, he endeavoured to complete with Dr. Hunter what he had begun with Dr.Monro; and under these two eminent teachers he appears to have acquired a high degree of anatomical knowledge. He likewise entered himself, about this time, a pupil at St. George’s hospital ; and with what industry he prosecuted this plan, with what success his labours were crowned, may be seen in a series of Clinical and Anatomical Observations, which were made by him during his attendance at the hospital, and were published after his death by his friend Dr. Carmichael Smyth.</p><p>In the year 1767 he went to Leyden, where he took the degree of M.D., publishing an inaugural dissertation on the dysentery. On his return to London, he recommenced his studies at the hospital ; and when Dr. Black was called to the chemical chair in Edinburgh, which he long filled with so much honour to himself and credit to the university, Dr. Stark was solicited, by several members of the υniversity of Glasgow, to stand as a candidate for their professor ship of the theory and practice of physic, rendered vacant by Dr. Black’s removal to Edinburgh. This, however, he de</p><p>clined, being influenced by the advice of his English friends, who wished to detain him in London, and having, likewise, some prospects of an appointment in the hospital. In 1769 he commenced a series of experiments on diet, which he was encouraged to undertake by Sir John Pringle and Dr. Franklin, whose friendship he enjoyed, and from whom he received many hints respecting both the plan and its exe cution. These experiments, or rather the imprudent zeal with which he prosecuted them, proved, in the opinion of his friends, fatal to himself; for he began them on the 12th of July 1769 in perfect health and vigour, and from that day, though his health varied, it was seldom if ever good, till the 23d of February 1770, when he died after suffering much uneasiness.</p><p>STARKENBURG, a province of the Grand Duchy of Hesse Darmstadt, in Germany. It is situated on the right bank of the Rhine, in contact with Nassau on the north, with Hesse Casel on the north east, with Bavaria on the east, with Baden on the south, and on the west with the Darmstadt dominions to the west of the Rhine. It is 1102 square miles in extent, and contains thirty-six cities and towns, and 811 villages, with about 235,000 inhabitants, nearly one-half of whom are Lutherans, two-fifths Catholics, and the remainder Calvinists, Menonites, and Jews. The eastern part con tains the mountainous forest country called the Odenwald ; but the western part is a level and fertile country, well cuItivated, and yielding good crops of corn, fruit, potatoes, flax, hemp, and tobacco. It also produces good wine and abun dance of cider. The chief occupation, except agriculture, is spinning flax and hemp, and in converting the trees of the forests into woodware. The province is divided into thirty bailiwicks, and the capital is that of the principality, the city of Darmstadt.</p><p>STABLINGS, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Sterlings</hi>, the name given to the strong pieces of timber which were driven into the bed of the river to protect the piles, on the top of which were laid the flat beams upon which were built the bases of the stone piers that support the arches of London bridge. In general, starlings are large piles placed on the outside of the foundation of the piers of bridges, to break the force of the water, and to protect the stone work from injury by floating ice. They are otherwise called <hi rend="italic">jettes,</hi> and their place is often supplied by large stones thrown at random round the piers of bridges, as may be seen at Stirling bridge when the river is low ; and as was done by Mr. Smeaton’s direction round the piers of the centre arch of London bridge, when it was thought in danger of being undermined by the current.</p><p>STATES, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Estates</hi>, a term applied to several orders or classes of people assembled to consult of matters for the public good.</p><p>STATICS, a term which the modem improvements in knowledge have made it necessary to introduce into physicomathematical science. It was found convenient to distribute the doctrines of universal mechanics into two classes, which required both a different mode of consideration and different principles of reasoning.</p><p>Till the time of Archimedes little science of this kind was possessed by the ancients, from whom we have received the first rudiments. His investigation of the centre of gravity, and his theory of the lever, are the foundations of our know ledge of common mechanics ; and his theory of the equilibrium of floating bodies contains the greatest part of our hydrostatical knowledge. But it was as yet limited to the simplest cases ; and there were some in which Archimedes was ignorant, or was mistaken. The marquis Guido Ubaldi, in 1578, published his theory of mechanics, in which the doctrines of Archimedes were well explained and consider ably augmented. Stevinus, the celebrated Dutch engineer, published about twenty years after an excellent system of mechanics, containing the chief principles which now form the science of equilibrium among solid bodies.
