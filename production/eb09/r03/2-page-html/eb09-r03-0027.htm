<p><span class="font1">individual authors noticed stand to the whole subject, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i.e., </span><span class="font1">to the collective literary expression, so far as they found&nbsp;an expression, of the action, the ideas, the character, the&nbsp;various feelings, passions, and moods, of ancient Rome and&nbsp;of the races which it absorbed, so long as that literature&nbsp;has a distinct unity and individuality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The actual beginning of Roman artistic literature can be assigned to a definite date, the year 240 </span><span class="font0">B.c., </span><span class="font1">when&nbsp;Livius Andronicus produced on a Roman stage a drama&nbsp;with a regular plot, instead of the unconnected dramatic&nbsp;dialogues </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(saturx)</span><span class="font1"> by which the holidays of the people&nbsp;had previously been enlivened. Yet the germs of an indigenous literature had existed independently at an earlier&nbsp;period in Rome and in the country districts of Italy.&nbsp;Although these cannot be said to have exercised any&nbsp;marked influence on the subsequent development of literature, they have an importance as indicating natural wants&nbsp;in the Italian race, which were ultimately satisfied by&nbsp;regular literary forms. The art of writing was first employed in the service of the state and of religion for the&nbsp;preservation of the sacred hymns, books of ritual, treaties&nbsp;with other states, the laws of the XII. Tables, &amp;c. An&nbsp;approach to literature was made in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Annales Maximi,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">although it cannot be supposed that the pontifex maximus&nbsp;in drawing up the dry records of the prodigies and events&nbsp;of the year had any thought of gratifying intellectual curiosity or imparting intellectual pleasure. But in the satisfaction they afforded to the commemorative and patriotic&nbsp;instincts they anticipated an office afterwards performed by&nbsp;the national epics and the works of regular historians. A&nbsp;still nearer approach to literature was probably made in&nbsp;oratory, as we learn from Cicero that in the generation&nbsp;before the first regular dramatic representation a speech&nbsp;delivered by Appius Claudius Csecus was given to the&nbsp;world. Appius was also the author of a poem of an ethical&nbsp;and didactic character, which Cicero tells us (7W., v.&nbsp;2, 4) was praised by Panaetius. No other name associated&nbsp;with any form of literature belonging to the pre-literary&nbsp;age has been preserved by tradition, and it is to be borne&nbsp;in mind that Appius lived on till the wars with Pyrrhus,&nbsp;when the first active collision between Rome and Greece&nbsp;took place. This premature stirring of literary ambition is like the occasional anticipation by individual&nbsp;thinkers of some important discovery or some great intellectual movement before the world around them is ready&nbsp;to receive it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But it was rather in extemporaneous effusions than in written compositions that some germs of a native poetry&nbsp;might have been detected. The most genuine indication&nbsp;of that impulse which ultimately finds its realization in&nbsp;artistic literature appears in the use of a metre of pure&nbsp;native origin, the Saturnian, which by its rapid and lively&nbsp;movement gives expression to the vivacity and quick&nbsp;apprehension of the Italian race. This metre appears to&nbsp;have been first used in ritual hymns, which seem to have&nbsp;assumed definite shapes out of the exclamations of a&nbsp;primitive priesthood engaged in a rude ceremonial dance.&nbsp;It was also employed by a class of bards or itinerant soothsayers known by the name of “ vates.” It was used also&nbsp;in the “Fescennine verses,” which gave expression to the&nbsp;coarse gaiety of the people and to their strong tendency&nbsp;to personal raillery and satiric comment. This tendency,&nbsp;which under the stern censorship of the patrician rulers of&nbsp;the early republic was repressed by stringent laws, found&nbsp;ultimately its legitimate outlet in Roman satire. The&nbsp;metre was also employed in commemorative poems, accompanied with music, which were sung at funeral banquets&nbsp;in celebration of the exploits and virtues of distinguished&nbsp;men. These had their origin in the same impulse which&nbsp;ultimately found its full gratification in Roman history,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Roman epic poetry, and that form of Roman oratory known as “ laudationes,” and in some of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Odes</span><span class="font1"> of Horace. The&nbsp;latest and probably the most important of these rude and&nbsp;inchoate forms was that of dramatic </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">saturx</span><span class="font1"> (medleys), put&nbsp;together without any regular plot, and consisting apparently of contests of wit and satiric invective, and perhaps&nbsp;of comments on current events, accompanied with music&nbsp;(“saturas impletas modis,” Liv., vii. 2). These have a&nbsp;real bearing on the subsequent development of Roman&nbsp;literature. They prepared the mind of the people for the&nbsp;reception of regular comedy. They may have contributed&nbsp;to the formation of the style of comedy which appears at&nbsp;the very outset much more mature than that of serious&nbsp;poetry, tragic or epic. They gave the name and some of&nbsp;the characteristics to that special literary product of the&nbsp;Roman soil, the “satura,” addressed to readers, not to&nbsp;spectators, which ultimately was developed into pure poetic&nbsp;satire in Lucilius, Horace, Persius, and Juvenal, into the&nbsp;prose and verse miscellany of Varro, and into something&nbsp;approaching the prose novel in Petronius.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">First Period: from,</span><span class="font1"> 240 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">to about</span><span class="font1"> 80 b.c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The historical event which brought about the greatest change in the intellectual condition of the Romans, and&nbsp;thereby exercised a decisive influence on the whole course&nbsp;of human culture, was the capture of Tarentum in 272.&nbsp;After the capture many Greek slaves were brought to&nbsp;Rome, and among them the young Livius Andronicus,&nbsp;who was employed in teaching Greek in the family of his&nbsp;master, a member of the Livian gens. From that time'&nbsp;to learn Greek became a regular part of the education of&nbsp;a Roman noble. The capture of Tarentum was followed&nbsp;by the complete Romanizing of all Southern Italy. Soon&nbsp;after came the First Punic War^ the principal scene of&nbsp;which was Sicily, where, from common hostility to the&nbsp;Carthaginian, Greek and Roman were brought into friendly&nbsp;relations, and the Roman armies must have become familiar&nbsp;■with the spectacles and performances of the Greek theatre.&nbsp;In the year following the conclusion of the war (240),&nbsp;after the armies had returned and the people were at&nbsp;leisure to enjoy the fruits of victory (“et post Punica&nbsp;bella quietus,” Hor., </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ejy.,</span><span class="font1"> ii. 162), Livius Andronicus&nbsp;“took the bold step” (“ausus est primus argumento&nbsp;fabulam serere,” Liv., vii. 2) of substituting at one of the&nbsp;public festivals a regular drama translated or adapted from&nbsp;the Greek for the musical medleys </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(saturx)</span><span class="font1"> hitherto in&nbsp;use. From this time dramatic performances became a&nbsp;regular accompaniment of the public games, and came&nbsp;more and more to encroach on the older kinds of amusement, such as the chariot races. The dramatic work of&nbsp;Livius was, however, merely educative; it can hardly be&nbsp;called in any sense of the word literary. The same may&nbsp;be said of his later work, which was still used as a schoolbook in the days of Horace,—the translation of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Odyssey;</span><span class="font1"> and probably the religious hymn which he was&nbsp;called upon to compose in the latter part of the Second&nbsp;Punic War had no higher literary pretension. He was,&nbsp;however, the first to make the old name of poet a title&nbsp;of honour instead of reproach; and by familiarizing the&nbsp;Romans with the forms of the Greek drama and the Greek&nbsp;epic he determined the main lines which Roman literature&nbsp;followed for more than a century afterwards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">His immediate successor, Cn. Nsevius, was not, like Livius, a Greek, but either a Roman citizen or one who&nbsp;enjoyed the limited citizenship of a Latin, and who had&nbsp;served in the Roman army in the First Punic War. His&nbsp;first appearance as a dramatic author was in 235. He&nbsp;adapted both tragedies and comedies from the Greek, but&nbsp;the bent of his genius, the tastes of his audience, and the&nbsp;condition of the language, developed through the active</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
