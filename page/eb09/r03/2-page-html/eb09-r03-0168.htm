<p><span class="font1">success,—social prestige, abundant commissions, and any amount of money, which he was wont to throw about&nbsp;broadcast to the populace. In 1646 he returned to&nbsp;Naples, and is said to have taken an active part in the&nbsp;insurrection of Masaniello ; certain it is that he sympathized&nbsp;with and admired the fisherman autocrat, for a passage in&nbsp;one of his satires proves this. His actual share in the&nbsp;insurrection is, however, dubious ; it appears only in&nbsp;recent narratives, and the same is the case with the well-known story that at one time he herded with a band of&nbsp;brigands in the Abruzzi—an incident which cannot be&nbsp;conveniently dove-tailed into any of the known dates of&nbsp;his career. As regards the popular revolt against Spanish&nbsp;tyranny, it is alleged that Rosa, along with other painters&nbsp;—Coppola, Porpora, Micco Spadaro, Dal Po, Masturzo,&nbsp;the two Vaccari, and Cadogna—all under the captaincy&nbsp;of Aniello Falcone, formed the Compagnia della Morte,&nbsp;whose mission it was to hunt up Spaniards in the streets&nbsp;and despatch them, not sparing even those who had sought&nbsp;some place of religious asylum. He painted a portrait of&nbsp;Masaniello—probably from reminiscence rather than from&nbsp;life : indeed it is said that he painted him several times&nbsp;over in less than life size. On the approach of Don John&nbsp;of Austria the blood-stained Compagnia dispersed, Rosa&nbsp;escaping or at ' any rate returning to Rome. Here he&nbsp;painted some important subjects, showing the uncommon&nbsp;bent of his mind as it passed from landscape into history&nbsp;—Democritus amid Tombs, the Death of Socrates, Regulus&nbsp;in the Spiked Cask (these two are now in England),&nbsp;Justice Quitting the Earth, and the Wheel of Fortune.&nbsp;This last work, the tendency of which was bitingly satirical, raised a storm of ire and remonstrance. Rosa,&nbsp;endeavouring at conciliation, published a description of its&nbsp;meaning (probably softened down not a little from the&nbsp;real facts) ; none the less an order for his imprisonment&nbsp;was issued, but ultimately withheld at the instance of some&nbsp;powerful friends. It was about this time that Rosa wrote&nbsp;his satire named </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Babylon,</span><span class="font1"> under which name Rome was&nbsp;of course indicated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Cardinal Giancarlo de’ Medici now invited the painter to leave Rome—which had indeed become too hot to&nbsp;hold him—for Florence. Salvator gladly assented, and&nbsp;remained in the Tuscan capital for the better part of nine&nbsp;years, introducing there the new style of landscape ; he&nbsp;had no pupils, but various imitators. Lorenzo Lippi the&nbsp;painter poet, Baldovini, and other </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">beaux esprits</span><span class="font1"> shared&nbsp;with Rosa the hospitalities of the cardinal, and they formed&nbsp;an academy named I Percossi (the Stricken), indulging in&nbsp;a deal of ingenious jollity—Rosa being alike applauded as&nbsp;painter, poet, and musician. His chief intimate at this&nbsp;time was Lippi, whom he encouraged to proceed with the&nbsp;poem </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Il Malmantile Racpuistato.</span><span class="font1"> He was well acquainted&nbsp;also with Ugo and Giulio Maffei, and housed with them&nbsp;more than once in Volterra, where he wrote other four&nbsp;satires—</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Music, Poetry, Painting,</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">War.</span><span class="font1"> About the&nbsp;same time he painted his own portrait, now in the Uffizi&nbsp;Gallery of Florence. Finally he reverted once more to&nbsp;Rome, and hardly left that city again. Much enmity&nbsp;still brooded there against him, taking the form more&nbsp;especially of an allegation that the satires which he&nbsp;zealously read and diffused in MS. were not his own production, but filched from some one else. Rosa indignantly&nbsp;repelled this charge, which remains indeed quite unsubstantiated, although it is true that the satires deal so&nbsp;extensively and with such ready manipulation in classical&nbsp;names, allusions, and anecdotes that one is rather at a&nbsp;loss to fix upon the period of his busy career at which&nbsp;Rosa could possibly have imbued his mind with such a&nbsp;multitude of semi-erudite details. It may perhaps be&nbsp;legitimate to suppose that his literary friends in Florence&nbsp;and Volterra had coached him up to a large extent—the&nbsp;satires, as compositions, remaining none the less strictly&nbsp;and fully his own. To confute his detractors he now&nbsp;wrote the last of the series, entitled </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Envy.</span><span class="font1"> Among the&nbsp;pictures of his closing years were the admired Battlepiece&nbsp;now in the Louvre, painted in the short space of forty&nbsp;days, full of long-drawn carnage, with ships burning in&nbsp;the offing ; Pythagoras and the Fishermen ; the Oath of&nbsp;Catiline (Pitti Gallery) ; and the very celebrated Saul and&nbsp;the Witch of Endor (Louvre), which is perhaps his latest&nbsp;work. He undertook a series of satirical portraits, to be&nbsp;closed by one of himself, but while occupied with this project he was assailed by dropsy, which, after lasting fully&nbsp;half a year, brought his life to a close on loth March 1673.&nbsp;In his last moments he married a Florentine named&nbsp;Lucrezia, who kept his house and had borne him two sons,&nbsp;one of them surviving him, and he died in a contrite frame&nbsp;of mind. He lies buried in the Chiesa degli Angeli, where&nbsp;a portrait of him has been set up. Salvator Rosa, after&nbsp;.the hard struggles of his early youth, had always been a&nbsp;successful man, and he left a handsome fortune.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rosa λvas indisputably a great leader in that modern tendency of fine art towards the romantic and picturesque which, developing&nbsp;in various directions and by diversified processes, has at last almost&nbsp;totally differentiated modern from olden art. He saw appearances&nbsp;with a new eye, and presented new images of them on his canvases,&nbsp;and deserves therefore all the credit due to a vigorous innovator,&nbsp;even if we contest the absolute value of his product. He himself&nbsp;courted reputation for his historical works, laying comparatively&nbsp;little stress on his landscapes ; in portraits he was forcible. In&nbsp;chiaroscuro he is simple and effective ; his design has energy and&nbsp;a certain grandeur, without any high type of form or any superior&nbsp;measure of correctness. His colour is too constantly of a sandy or&nbsp;yellowish-grey tone. Personally he was a man of high spirit, and he&nbsp;sold his pictures at large prices, more (it is said) to assert the honour&nbsp;of his art than from love of money ; rather than sell them cheap&nbsp;he destroyed them. In his later Florentine period he etched several&nbsp;of his works, subjects of mythology, soldiering, &amp;c. He was&nbsp;choleric, but kind and generous. Though a man of gaiety and&nbsp;pleasure, and a jovial boon companion, he does not appear to have&nbsp;been vicious in any serious degree. He was talkative, very sharp-tongued, and an unblushing encomiast of his own performances.&nbsp;Among his pictures not already mentioned we may name, in the&nbsp;London National Galleiy, Mercury and the Dishonest Woodman,&nbsp;and two others ; in Raynham Hall, Belisarius ; in the Grosvenor&nbsp;Gallery, Diogenes ; in the Pitti Gallery, a grand portrait of a man&nbsp;in armour, and the Temptation of St Anthony, which contains his&nbsp;own portrait. This last subject appears also in St Petersburg, and&nbsp;in the Berlin Gallery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The satires of Salvator Rosa deserve more attention than they have generally received. Though considerably spread abroad&nbsp;during his lifetime, they were not published until 1719. They are&nbsp;all in terza rima, written without much literary correctness, but&nbsp;remarkably spirited, pointed, and even brilliant. They are&nbsp;slashingly denunciatory, and from this point of view too&nbsp;monotonous in treatment. Rosa here appears as a very severe&nbsp;castigator of all ranks and conditions of men, not sparing the&nbsp;highest, and as a champion of the poor and down-trodden, and of&nbsp;moral virtue and Catholic faith. It seems odd that a man who took&nbsp;so free a part in the pleasures and diversions of life should be so&nbsp;ruthless to the ministers of these. The satire on </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Music</span><span class="font0"> exposes&nbsp;the insolence and profligacy of musicians, and the shame of courts&nbsp;and churches in encouraging them. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">-Poetry</span><span class="font0"> dwells on the pedantry,&nbsp;imitativeness, adulation, affectation, and indecency of poets—&nbsp;also their poverty, and the neglect with which they were treated ;&nbsp;and there is a very vigorous sortie against oppressive governors and&nbsp;aristocrats. Tasso’s glory is upheld ; Dante is spoken of as obsolete, and Ariosto a£ corrupting. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Painting</span><span class="font0"> inveighs against the&nbsp;pictorial treatment of squalid subjects, such as beggars (though&nbsp;Rosa must surely himself have been partly responsible for this&nbsp;misdirection of the art), against the ignorance and Iewdness of&nbsp;painters, and their tricks of trade, and the gross indecorum of&nbsp;painting sprawling half-naked saints of both sexes. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">IVar</span><span class="font0"> (which&nbsp;contains the eulogy of Masaniello) derides the folly of hireling&nbsp;soldiers, who fight and perish while kings stay at home ; the&nbsp;vile morals of kings and lords, heresy, and unbelief also come in&nbsp;for a flagellation. In </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Babylon</span><span class="font0"> Rosa represents himself as a&nbsp;fisherman, Tirreno, constantly unlucky in his net-hauls on the&nbsp;Euphrates ; he converses with a native of the country, Ergasto.&nbsp;Babylon (Rome) is very severely treated, and Naples much the&nbsp;same. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Envy</span><span class="font0"> (the last of the satires, and generally accounted the&nbsp;best, although without strong apparent reason) represents Rosa</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
