<p><span class="font0">alone !<sup>,</sup> Alas ! how terrible to imagine a being in possession of such endowments, who could bring himself to think of death!—able to turn back upon his path and meet&nbsp;immortal youth, to see again the morning of his day, and&nbsp;find, in renewed life and beauty, a disguise impenetrable&nbsp;to his former enemies ; yet, in the sadness of his experience, so dreading the mistakes and persecutions of his&nbsp;fellow-men, as to choose rather to lie down with the worm&nbsp;and seek oblivion in the seats of rottenness and corruption.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">None of Godwin’s other tales have been popular. “ His man of feeling feels but for himself;” and, indeed, the character is in some points so unintelligible, and in others so&nbsp;odious, that notwithstanding many beauties of detail, we&nbsp;cannot wonder at the unpopularity of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Fleetwood.</span><span class="font0"> The&nbsp;same sort of objections apply to the insane vindictiveness&nbsp;of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">MandevUle. Cloudesley,</span><span class="font0"> the child of Godwin’s old age,&nbsp;is only remarkable for the gentle beauty of the style,&nbsp;and the contrast which the calmness of the story (turning, like </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Caleb Williams,</span><span class="font0"> on the discovery of a murder,)&nbsp;presents to the rapidity and sullen energy of his first production.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">No writer has come so near the manner of Godwin as Charles Brockden Brown, an American novelist, an imitator of the English author, but in a free and noble spirit of&nbsp;imitation. He certainly had not Godwin’s power of mental analysis, and not much of that pathetic tenderness which,&nbsp;contrasted with the general sternness of his tone, shews like&nbsp;araiπbowagainstatroubled sky. He was altogether more prosaic; dealing, indeed,rather with the material than the moral&nbsp;sublime ; producing his strong effects by scenes of sickness,&nbsp;danger, death, or the explosions of insanity ; and often&nbsp;making his characters mere </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">phantasmata,</span><span class="font0"> which interest us&nbsp;only as the means by which a series of agitating incidents&nbsp;are brought into connexion. But he had a good deal of the&nbsp;same eloquence, and the same dark and mysterious power of&nbsp;imagination ; a certain intensity of portraiture, w<sup>τ</sup>hether of&nbsp;mental emotion or things external ; great skill in working&nbsp;up a chain of singular events that keep curiosity and suspense upon the stretch, or impress us with a sense of danger and anxiety, and of which he loves to furnish an explanation from those phenomena in our nature which are&nbsp;little understood, such as somnambulism, trances, spontaneous combustion, or ventriloquism. In these respects </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Wieland, Ormond, Edgar Bluntly,</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Arthur Mervyn</span><span class="font0"> have all&nbsp;nearly the same character, nor do they differ materially in&nbsp;point of merit. Brown has singular power in the delineation of solitude of all kinds, whether the silence of lonely&nbsp;forests, broken only by the howl of panthers, or of deserted&nbsp;mansions dropping to decay. There is one picture of this&nbsp;kind in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Arthur Meτvyn,</span><span class="font0"> of an empty house, evacuated during the yellow fever in Philadelphia, silent and dark in the&nbsp;day time, with the sunshine streaming in through the closed&nbsp;doors and shutters, and faintly discovering that every thing&nbsp;remained undisturbed since its desertion, which produces a&nbsp;strong feeling of awe, and oppresses the spirits with an unaccountable sadness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">No other novelist of any ability can be said to have adopted the manner of Godwin with success, except his accomplished daughter, the authoress of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Frankenstein,</span><span class="font0"> a production of much originality in its conception, though the execution of the work is unequal, and the whole portion which relates to the self-education of the monster, who is the creation of the new Prometheus, almost ludicrously improbable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Several female novelists, towards the close of the eighteenth century, deserve notice, whose tales, though now little read, have the merit either of pathetic or humorous&nbsp;delineation. In the first of these classes are Mrs. Inchbald&nbsp;and Charlotte Smith ; in the latter Madame D’Arblay, or to&nbsp;use the name by which she was best known, Miss Burney.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The fame of Mrs. Inchbald rests upon her </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Simple Story. </span><span class="font0">The title perhaps is but of doubtful application to a novel,</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font0">which is really complicated with strong and varied passions, which turns on the fate and fortunes of persons plaoed in&nbsp;very peculiar relations to each other, and like Shakspeare’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Winters Tale,</span><span class="font0"> unites two distinct stories relating to different personages, between the action of which “ time has slid&nbsp;o’er sixteen years ;” for the Perdita of Mrs. Inchbald’s second part is the daughter of that Lady Elmwood, for whose&nbsp;misfortunes and indiscretions our sympathies had been engaged in the first, and who, almost in a sentence, is suddenly&nbsp;consigned to guilt, and to the grave. Dorriforth only remains the connecting link between the two portions of the&nbsp;tale. It is a proof of considerable merit in the novel, that&nbsp;so hazardous an experiment as that of transferring our sympathies to actors in a great measure new to the scene, has&nbsp;not been unsuccessful ; that the interest is, notwithstanding,&nbsp;kept up, partly by the real pathos of some of the scenes, and&nbsp;the natural traits of passion in others, such as that where&nbsp;Lord Elmwood, receiving his deserted daughter as she falls&nbsp;into his arms, calls her by the maiden name of her guilty&nbsp;mother, as if all that passed since those days of innocence&nbsp;had faded from his mind like a dream ; and partly by the&nbsp;dramatic nature of the situations which, though sometimes&nbsp;violent, are generally picturesque and agitating, and the&nbsp;movement of the dialogue, which every where shows the&nbsp;skill of a practical writer for the stage. Her second novel,&nbsp;entitled </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Nature and Art,</span><span class="font0"> has been generally and justly&nbsp;reckoned much inferior to the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Simple Story.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Charlotte Smith, (1749—1806) though her novels are extremely defective in plot, betraying marks of haste, and tinged with a melancholy easily to be accounted for from the depressing circumstances under which they were generally&nbsp;composed, cannot be confounded with the ordinary day-labourers for the circulating library, “ who turn a Persian tale&nbsp;for half a crown.” Sir Walter Scott, in one of those kindly&nbsp;notices by which he delighted to cheer the heart of struggling genius, or to do justice to the memory of talents which&nbsp;time was consigning somewhat too rapidly to oblivion, has&nbsp;given her credit for great powers of satire mixed with pathos,&nbsp;and characters sketched with “ firmness of pencil and liveliness of colouring.” The satire indeed seems to have been&nbsp;pretty indiscriminate, since it extends to her own husband,&nbsp;whose pecuniary improvidence and sanguine temperament&nbsp;are glanced at in the character of the projector, who hoped to&nbsp;make a fortune by manuring his estate with old wigs. But&nbsp;apart from satire, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Old Manor House,</span><span class="font0"> the only one of&nbsp;her novels with which we are acquainted, is really entitled&nbsp;to the character of an interesting and well-written tale. We&nbsp;have a lively recollection of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Manor House</span><span class="font0"> itself, its&nbsp;neighbourhood, its sea-side scenes, the strange domineering&nbsp;Lady of the Manor, Mrs. Rayland, whom Sir Walter Scott&nbsp;describes as a sort of Queen Elizabeth in private life, and&nbsp;the natural interest which she has succeeded in giving to the&nbsp;love story which is going on within the ancient walls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The popularity once enjoyed by the novels of Miss Burney, appears now to have been somewhat overrated, at&nbsp;least we are at a loss to discover any thing in her first work,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Evelina,</span><span class="font0"> except the extreme youth of the writer, then only&nbsp;eighteen, to account for that burst of approbation with which&nbsp;it appears to have been received in 1778 by such men as&nbsp;Burke, Reynolds, and Johnson. She wrote no doubt with&nbsp;sprightliness, with some humour of a broad and superficial&nbsp;kind, and undoubtedly possessed considerable talent in drawing bores and personages of low* manners or odd habits from&nbsp;vulgar middle life ; in imagining scenes of awkward mistakes in society, and exaggerating the teasing distresses&nbsp;thence arising to her heroines and other personages of more&nbsp;refined manners or higher pretensions. Indeed, to mimickry&nbsp;she appears, from her father’s account, to have had a strong&nbsp;leaning from her childhood ; but when she rises from mere&nbsp;manners and habits to paint feelings, we see little but indecision on one hand, or exaggeration on the other.
