When twenty years of age, he connected himself with the Oratorians, a sort of religious order, the members of which lived in community without binding themselves to the observance of any vows, and turned their chief attention to the instruction of youth. He afterwards taught philosophy at Pezenos, and next at Toulon, which requiring some degree of geometrical knowledge, he became extremely fond of that science, and cultivated and improved it to a great extent. He was, in consequence of his knowledge, invited to fill the mathematical chair at Angers in 1683, and he was also elected a member of the academy in 1694.</p><p>He undertook to reduce into a body, for the benefit of his pupils, the chief theories which were scattered throughout the works of Newton, Descartes, Leibnitz, Bernoulli, the Leipsic Acts, the Memoirs of the Academy of Paris, and several other works, to which he gave the name of <hi rend="italic">Analyse Démontrée,</hi>  or Analysis Demonstrated, and which was published in 1708, in two vols, quarto.</p><p>He gave to this work the name of Analysis Demonstrated, because he therein demonstrates various methods which had not been demonstrated by their authors, or, at least, not with sufficient accuracy and perspicuity. This work of Reyneau was very much applauded, and it became a general maxim in France, that to follow him was the best, if not the only way, to make any extraordinary progress in the study of mathematics.</p><p>Such was his ambition to be useful, that in 1714 he published his <hi rend="italic">Science du Calcul des Grandeurs,</hi>  intended for the benefit of such as were wholly unacquainted with the science of geometry. Of this work a very able judge was pleased to observe, that “ though several books had already appeared upon the same subject, such a treatise as that before him was still wanting, as in it everything was handled in a manner sufficiently extensive, and at the same time with all possible exactness and perspicuity.” Although many branches of the mathematics had been well discussed prior to his time, no good elements were to be met with, even of practical geometry.</p><p>When the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris gave admission to other learned and eminent men, Father Rey-neau was received into the number. The works already mentioned are all he ever published, or perhaps ever composed, with the exception of a little piece upon logic ; and materials for a second volume of his <hi rend="italic">Science du Calcul</hi>  were left behind him in manuscript. Towards the close of life he was too much afflicted with sickness to give much application to study ; and he died in 1728, at seventy-two years of age. His many virtues and extensive erudition made this event much regretted by all who had the pleasure of being acquainted with him. It was regarded as an honour and a happiness by the first men in France to number him amongst their friends, such as the chancellor of the kingdom, and Malebranche, of the latter of whom Reyneau was a faithful and zealous disciple.</p><p>REYNOLDS, Sir Joshua, the celebrated painter, was born at Plympton, a small town in Devonshire, on the 16th July 1723. His father was minister of the parish, and also master of the grammar school ; and being a man of learning and philanthropy, he was beloved and respected by all to whom he was known. Such a man, it will naturally be supposed, was assiduous in the cultivation of the minds of his children, amongst whom his son Joshua shone conspicuous, by displaying at a very early period a superiority of genius and the rudiments of a correct taste. Unlike other boys, who generally content themselves with giving a literal explanation of their author, regardless of his beauties or his faults, young Reynolds attended to both these, displaying a happy knowledge of what he read, and entering with ardour into the spirit of his author. He discovered likewise talents for composition, and a natural propensity for drawing, in which his friends and intimates thought him qualified to excel. Emulation was a distinguishing feature in his mind, which his father perceived with the delight natural to a parent; and designing him for the church, in which he hoped that his talents might raise him to eminence, he sent him to one of the universities.</p><p>Soon after this period he grew passionately fond of painting; and, by the perusal of Richardson’s theory of that art was determined to make it his profession through'life. At his own earnest request therefore, he was removed to London ; and about the year 1742 became a pupil to Mr Hudson, who, though not himself an eminent painter, was preceptor to several who afterwards excelled in the art. One of the first advices which he gave to Mr Reynolds was to copy carefully Guercino’s drawings. This was done with such skill, that many of the copies are said to be now preserved in the cabinets of the curious as the originals of that very great master.</p><p>About the year 1749, Mr Reynolds went to Italy under the auspices and in the company of Lord, then Commodore, Keppel, who was appointed to the command of the British squadron in the Mediterranean. In this garden of the world, this magical seat of the arts, he failed not to visit the schools of the great masters, to study the productions of different ages, and to contemplate with unwearied attention the various beauties which are characteristic of each. His labour here, as has been observed of another painter, was “ the labour of love, not the task of the hireling ;” and how much he profited by it is known to all Europe.</p><p>Having remained about two years in Italy, and studied the language as well as the arts of the country with great success, he returned to England, improved by travel and refined by education. On the road to London from the port where he landed, he accidentally found in the inn where he lodged Johnson’s life of Savage ; and was so taken with the charms of composition and the masterly delineation of character displayed in that performance, that having begun to read it whilst leaning with his arm on the chimney-piece, he continued in that attitude insensible of pain till he was hardly able to raise his hand to his head.
