            <p>Hen. VIII. c. 9. The sale of land to be held in mortmain would be void as contrary to
                the policy of the Mortmain Acts (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Charities,
                    Corporation).</hi> The rights and liabilities of vendors and purchasers have
                been considerably affected by recent legislation, the principal Acts dealing with
                the subject being the Vendor and Purchaser Act, 1874, and the Conveyancing Act,
                1881. A period of forty years has been substituted for the period of sixty years
                previously necessary as the root of title,—that is to say, in most cases an abstract
                showing title for forty years is sufficient. In an abstract of title to leaseholds,
                the title is to commence with the lease or underlease, in an abstract of title to
                enfranchised lands, under a contract to sell the freehold, with the deed of
                enfranchisement. Recitals twenty years old are evidence, except so far as they can
                be proved to be inaccurate, and recitals of documents dated prior to the
                commencement of the abstract are to be taken as correct, and their production is not
                to be required. The expenses of evidence required in support of the abstract and not
                in the vendor’s possession are thrown upon the purchaser. The Conveyancing Act,
                1881, further protects the purchaser by implying in a conveyance by a beneficial
                owner on sale for valuable consideration covenants for right to convey, quiet
                enjoyment, freedom from encumbrances, and further assurance. In a conveyance of
                leaseholds a covenant for the validity of the lease is implied. These covenants
                protect the purchaser much in the same way as the implied warranty in the sale of
                personalty. The Act also gives the mortgagee, where the mortgage is by deed, the
                power of sale generally inserted in mortgage deeds (see MORTGAGE).</p>
            <p>The remedies of the vendor are an action for the price or for specific performance
                according to circumstances. There is also a remedy by mandamus against public
                companies refusing to complete. Specific performance is a remedy introduced by the
                Court of Chancery to enforce contracts for the sale or purchase of real estate, it
                being considered that in such cases the common law action for damages was an
                insufficient remedy. Strictly, it is only an exercise by the court of its
                jurisdiction over trustees, the vendor being after the contract, as has been said, a
                trustee for the purchaser. By the Judicature Act, 1873, actions of specific
                performance are specially assigned to the Chancery Division. A county court has
                jurisdiction where the purchase money does not exceed £500. In spite of the Statute
                of Frauds, specific performance may in some cases be decreed where a parol contract
                has been followed by part performance and where the position of the parties has been
                materially altered on the faith of the contract. Actions for the price or for
                specific performance are subject to the purchaser’s right to compensation for
                deficiency of quality or quantity or of the vendor’s interest in the property. The
                question whether in a particular case the purchaser is entitled to rescind the
                contract or only to compensation is often a very difficult one. The remedies of the
                purchaser are an action for specific performance, for rescission of the contract or
                for damages (in case of fraud), for a return of the deposit, or for expenses. On the
                principle of <hi rend="italic">caveat emptor,</hi> the sale is not avoided by mere
                commendatory statements, statements of opinion, or non-disclosure of patent defects.
                Non-disclosure of latent defects or material misrepresentation of facts, on the
                faith of which the purchaser entered into the contract, will as a rule be a ground
                for rescission or for damages, and this irrespective of fraud, as a contract for the
                sale of land is a contract <hi rend="italic">uberrimae fidei.</hi> Where the sale
                goes off or the vendor without fraud fails to make a good title, the purchaser can
                only recover the deposit, if any, and any expenses to which he may have been put; he
                cannot recover damages for the loss of his bargain. Certain frauds by a</p>
            <p>vendor or his solicitor or agent in order to induce the purchaser to accept a title
                render the offender guilty of a misdemeanour, as well as liable to an action for
                damages (22 and 23 Vict. c. 35, s. 24). By the Vendor and Purchaser Act, 1874,
                either a vendor or a purchaser of real or leasehold estate in England may obtain on
                a summary application the decision of a judge of the Chancery Division on any
                question connected with the contract, not being a question affecting its existence
                or validity. (See Sugden, <hi rend="italic">Vendors and Purchasers;</hi> Dart, <hi
                    rend="italic">Vendors and Purchasers ; </hi>Fry, <hi rend="italic">Specific
                    Performances</hi></p>
            <p><hi rend="italic">Personal Estate.—</hi>At common law, as in the case of real estate,
                writing was not essential to the validity of a contract of sale. The common law is
                thus stated by Blackstone : “ A contract of sale implies a bargain, or mutual
                understanding and agreement between the parties as to terms; and the law as to the
                transmutation of property under such contracts may be stated generally as follows.
                If the vendor says the price of the goods is £4 and the vendee says he will give £4,
                the bargain is struck; and, if the goods be thereon delivered or tendered, or any
                part of the price be paid down and accepted (if it be but a penny), the property in
                the goods is thereupon transmuted and vests immediately in the bargainee; so that in
                the event of their being subsequently damaged or destroyed he and not the vendor
                must stand to the loss. This supposes (it will be observed) the case of a sale for
                ready money; but, if it be a sale of goods to be delivered forthwith, but to be paid
                for afterwards, the property passes to the vendee immediately upon the striking of
                the bargain without either delivery on the one hand or payment on the other ”
                (Stephen, <hi rend="italic">Commentaries,</hi> vol. ii. bk. ii. pt. ii. ch. v.).
                Earnest may have been originally the same as the Roman <hi rend="italic">arrha</hi>;
                it was never, however, part payment, as <hi rend="italic">arrha</hi> might have
                been,—in fact, the Statute of Frauds specially distinguishes it from part payment.
                The giving of earnest has now fallen into disuse. The price need not be fixed; if
                not fixed, a reasonable price will be presumed. Though writing was in no case
                necessary at common law, it has become so under the provisions of various Acts of
                Parliament, prominent among which is the Statute of Frauds, ss. 4 and 17 (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Contact fraud). </hi>Section 17 of the Statute of Frauds was
                extended to executory contracts of sale by Lord Tenterden’s Act, 9 Geo. IV. c. 14.
                The sale of horses in market overt must be entered in a book kept by the toll-keeper
                (2 and 3 Ph. and M. c. 7, 31 Eliz. c. 12). The sale of ships must by the Merchant
                Shipping Act, 1854, be made by bill of sale in a certain form. Contracts for the
                sale of shares in a joint-stock banking company are void unless the contract sets
                forth in writing the numbers of the shares on the register of the company or (where
                the shares are not distinguished by numbers) the names of the registered proprietors
                (29 and 30 Vict. c. 29). Bills of sale of goods must be in writing in a certain form
                and registered under the Bills of Sale Acts, 1878 and 1882. @@<hi rend="superscript"
                    >1</hi> As a general rule the property in goods passes by the contract of sale.
                This general rule is subject to the following important exceptions : (1) where the
                vendor is to do anything to the goods for the purpose of putting them into that
                state in which the purchaser is bound to accept them, the property does not pass
                until performance of the necessary acts; (2) the same is the case where the goods
                are to be weighed, tested, or measured; (3) where the purchaser is bound to do
                anything as a condition on which the passing of the property depends, the property
                does not pass until the condition is fulfilled, even though the goods may be
                actually in the possession of the buyer; (4) where an executory contract for the</p>

                of their name ; they are in reality mortgages.</p>
