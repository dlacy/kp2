<p><span class="font2">first of these is the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">recapitulation theory</span><span class="font2"> which Tyconius originated and Augustine adopted, and which has been revived in later&nbsp;times by Hofmann, Hengstenberg and others. This theory holds&nbsp;that no progress is designed in the successive visions of the seven&nbsp;seals, the seven trumpets and the seven bowls; for that in the&nbsp;vision of the seals we have already an account of the last judgment (vi. 12-17) and the hlessed consummation (vii. 9-17).&nbsp;Thus the three groups form parallel accounts and contain the&nbsp;same or closely reIated material. But such a view is in conflict&nbsp;with the fact that the Apocalypse exhibits a steady movement&nbsp;from a detailed account of the condition of actual individual&nbsp;churches on an ever-widening sweep to the catastrophes that&nbsp;will befall every nation and country till at last evil is finally&nbsp;overthrown and the blessedness of the righteous consummated.&nbsp;Accordingly later exegetes<sup>1</sup> hold that the seventh in each series is&nbsp;unfolded in the series of seven that follows. But to this theory&nbsp;also it has been objected (HoItzmann, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hand-Commentar.</span><span class="font2"> p. 294)&nbsp;that the bowls are in the main a repetition—in parts weaker, in&nbsp;others stronger—of what has already been put forward in the&nbsp;trumpets; that before the seventh member of each hebdomad&nbsp;there is a pause occasioned by the insertion of visions of a&nbsp;different nature; that the final judgment has already been&nbsp;depicted in vi. 17, and yet further descriptions recur in x. 6, 7,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">xi. 15-18, xiv. 7, xix. </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ii</span><span class="font2"> : the temple in heaven is opened in&nbsp;xi. 19 and yet again in xv. 5: heaven itself has already been&nbsp;rent in sunder in vi. 12-17, and yet in viii. 7-12 is supposed to&nbsp;be in its ancient order: all green grass is burnt up in viii. 7,&nbsp;yet in ix. 4 the locusts are not permitted to injure the grass,&nbsp;and other like inconsistencies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The impossibility of logically carrying out either theory has given rise to doubts as to the unity of the book. Holtzmann&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Hand-Comment.</span><span class="font2"> 295) represents its structure as follows:—</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">It is noteworthy that the sections on the right hand correspond in the main to the elements which have been those to which</span></p>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> Swete divides the Apocalypse first of all into forty-two minor sections. Next he groups these sections into fourteen larger masses&nbsp;of apocalyptic matter, and by a process of synthesis seeks to arrive&nbsp;at the plan on which the author constructed his book. In so doing&nbsp;he points out that we become conscious of a great cleavage which&nbsp;practically divides the book into two parts, i. 9-xi. 14 and xii. I-xxii. 5, independently of the prologue and greeting, i. 1-8, and&nbsp;the epilogue and benediction, xxii. 6-21. A further study of the&nbsp;leading thoughts of the above parts enables him to set forth the&nbsp;scheme of the book as follows :—</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Prologue and Greeting,</span><span class="font2"> i. 1-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Part I. Vision of Christ in the midst of the churche^, i. 9-iii. 22. Vision of Christ in Heaven, iv. i-v. 14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Preparations for the End, vi. i-xi. 19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Part II. Vision of the Mother of Christ </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(i.e.</span><span class="font1"> the Church) and her enemies, xii. i-xiii. 18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Preparations for the End, xiv. i-xx. 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Vision of the Bride of Christ arrayed for her husband,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">xxi. i-xxii. 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Epilogue and benediction, xxii. 6-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">the latest critics have assigned either an earlier date or a different authorship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chaps, i.-iii.—</span><span class="font2">These chapters open with a prologue, i. 1-3, which defines the source, character and contents of the book,&nbsp;followed by a greeting, i. 4-8, in which the writer salutes the&nbsp;Seven Churches of Asia. Having so introduced his work the&nbsp;author, describes a vision of the ascended Christ, i. 9-20, who&nbsp;sends His messages to the angels of the Seven Churches, ii.-iii.&nbsp;With the conclusion of these epistles the Apocalypse proper really&nbsp;begins. But the way has been prepared for it. Its contents&nbsp;are <sup>44</sup> the things which must quickly happen,” i. 1. The visions&nbsp;are not for John’s personal benefit, but for transmission to&nbsp;the church at large, i. 11, and the writer is bidden to write down&nbsp;what he has seen and <sup>44</sup> the things which are and the things&nbsp;which shall be hereafter,” i. 19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">iv.-vi.—</span><span class="font2">The first three chapters show great artistic skill, and the power of the artist is no less conspicuous in what follows.&nbsp;First of all John is bidden to come up into heaven and see the&nbsp;things that should be hereafter, the vision of iv. 1. Then he&nbsp;beholds the Almighty on His throne surrounded by the four and&nbsp;twenty elders and the four living creatures. Before Him they&nbsp;all bow in worship and acknowledge that by Him were created&nbsp;aIl things and of His own free will were all created. In the&nbsp;next chapter (v.) the seer has a vision of a roll in the hand of Him&nbsp;that sat on the throne which none could open or look upon, till&nbsp;the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the mighty one with seven horns&nbsp;and seven eyes, appeared. Before Him all the elders and the&nbsp;living creatures fell down and acknowledged that He had power&nbsp;to open the seven seals thereof, and their song was re-echoed&nbsp;by every thing alike in heaven and earth. The contrast between these two chapters and those that follow is striking in the&nbsp;extreme. The time of the seer’s vision is one of direst need.&nbsp;The life and death struggle between the church and the empire&nbsp;has now entered on its final stage, and fear and trouble and woe&nbsp;are rife in the hearts of the faithful. But when the seer is&nbsp;exalted to heaven he sees no trace of the turmoil on earth. The&nbsp;vision of the Almighty is full of majesty and peace. All things&nbsp;do Him service; for all are the free creation of His will. The&nbsp;next vision serves to connect the Source and Sustainer of all&nbsp;things with the world and its history. The closing of the intermediate stage of the history of created things is committed to&nbsp;the Christ who will also be Lord of the age to come. The future&nbsp;of the saints is assured: what can avail against Him that hath&nbsp;<sup>44</sup> glory and dominion for ever and ever ” the wild attacks of&nbsp;Rome and even of Satan and his hosts ? The Lamb that was&nbsp;slain has taken upon Himself the burden of the world’s history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In vi. we have the opening of the six seals, and the horrors of the future begin. The choice of three series of seven seals,&nbsp;seven trumpets and seven bowls, to form the framework in&nbsp;which the history of the last woes is to be given, shows the same&nbsp;hand that addressed the churches as seven. But between the&nbsp;sixth and seventh seals and the sixth and seventh trumpets&nbsp;the connexion is more or less disturbed by the insertion of certain&nbsp;interludes containing material foreign in certain aspects to the&nbsp;Apocalypse. These are vii. 1-17 and x. i-xi. 14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">vii. ι-ιγ.—</span><span class="font2">These verses, which interrupt the plan of the book, fall into two independent fragments, 1-8 and 9-17, which are&nbsp;inconsistent in their original meaning with each other. For&nbsp;while 1-8 was most probably a Jewish apocalyptical fragment and&nbsp;strongly particularistic, 9-17 is clearly Universalist in character&nbsp;and is probably from the hand of our author. The foreign&nbsp;origin of vii. 1-8 may be concluded with Spitta, Bousset and&nbsp;others from the fact that the four winds, which in vii. 1 are said&nbsp;to be held fast Iest they should break in elemental fury on land&nbsp;and sea, are not let loose or referred to in the subsequent narrative,&nbsp;and also from the mention of the 144,000 Israelites of the twelve&nbsp;tribes, to whom no further reference is made; for these can no&nbsp;more be identified with the countless multitudes in vii. 9-17&nbsp;than with those who are <sup>44</sup>sealed” in ix. 4 sq. nor with the&nbsp;144,000 in xiv. 1; for in both these cases the sealed are not Jews&nbsp;hut elect Christians. The object of both fragments was to&nbsp;encourage the faithful in the face of the coming strife. In the</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
