<p><span class="font0">the councils, and it had no power to inflict civil punishment on offenders. Thus “ we ought,’’ as Lindsay says, “ to see in the&nbsp;disciplinary powers and punishments of the Consistory of&nbsp;Geneva not an exhibition of the working of the Church organized&nbsp; on the principles of Calvin, but the ordinary procedure of&nbsp;the town council· of a medieval city. Their petty punishments&nbsp;and their minute interferences with private life are only special&nbsp;instances of what was common to all municipal rule in the 16th&nbsp;century.” This is true of the supreme crime of heresy, which&nbsp;in the notorious case of Servetus was only an expression of rules&nbsp;laid down over a thousand years earlier in the Theodosian Code.&nbsp;Geneva, however, with its most distinguished of Protestant theologians, became a school of Protestantism, which sent its trained&nbsp;men into the Netherlands, England and Scotland, and especially&nbsp;across the border into France. It served too as a place of refuge&nbsp;for thousands of the persecuted adherents of its beliefs. Calvin’s&nbsp;book furnished the Protestants not only with a compact and&nbsp;admirably written handbook of theology, vigorous and clear,&nbsp;but with a system of Church government and a code of morals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">After the death of Francis I., his successor, Henry II., set himself even more strenuously to extirpate heresy; a special&nbsp;branch of the parlement of Paris—the so-called&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chambre ardente (q.v.</span><span class="font0">)—for the trial of heresy cases&nbsp;was established, and the fierce edict of Chateaubriand&nbsp;(June 1551) explicitly adopted many of the expedients&nbsp;of the papal inquisition. While hundreds were imprisoned or burned, Protestants seemed steadily to increase in&nbsp;numbers, and finally only the expostulations of the parlement of&nbsp;Paris prevented the king from introducing the Inquisition in&nbsp;France in accordance with the wishes of the pope and the&nbsp;cardinal of Lorraine. The civil tribunals, however, practically&nbsp;assumed the functions of regular inquisitorial courts, in spite&nbsp;of the objections urged by the ecclesiastical courts. Notwithstanding these measures for their extermination, the French&nbsp;Protestants were proceeding to organize a church in accordance&nbsp;with the conceptions of the early Christian communities as&nbsp;Calvin described them in his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Institutes.</span><span class="font0"> Beginning with Paris,&nbsp;some fifteen communities with their consistories were established&nbsp;in French towns between 1555 and 1560. In spite of continued&nbsp;persecution a national synod was assembled in Paris in 1559,&nbsp;representing at least twelve Protestant churches in Normandy&nbsp;and central France, which drew up a confession of faith and a&nbsp;book of church discipline. It appears to have been from France&nbsp;rather than from Geneva that the Presbyterian churches of&nbsp;Holland, Scotland and the United States derived their form of&nbsp;government. A reaction against the extreme severity of the&nbsp;king’s courts became apparent at this date. Du Bourg and&nbsp;others ventured warmly to defend the Protestants in the parlement of Paris in the very presence of the king and of the cardinal&nbsp;of Lorraine. The higher aristocracy began now to be attracted&nbsp;by the new doctrines, or at least repelled by the flagrant power&nbsp;enjoyed by the Guises during the brief reign of Francis II.&nbsp;(1559-1560). Protestantism was clearly becoming inextricably&nbsp;associated with politics of a very intricate sort. The leading&nbsp;members of the Bourbon branch of the royal family, and Gaspard&nbsp;de Coligny, admiral of France, were conspicuous among the&nbsp;converts to Calvinism. Persecution was revived by the Guises;&nbsp;Du Bourg, the brave defender of the Protestants, was burned&nbsp;as a heretic; yet Calvin could in the closing years of his life&nbsp;form a cheerful estimate that some three hundred thousand of&nbsp;his countrymen had been won over to his views. The death of&nbsp;Francis II. enabled Catherine de’ Medici, the queen mother, to&nbsp;assert herself against the Guises, and become the regent of her&nbsp;ten-year-old son Charles IX. A meeting of the States General&nbsp;had already been summoned to consider the state of the realm.&nbsp;Michel de l’Hôpital, the chancellor, who opened the assembly,&nbsp;was an advocate of toleration; he deprecated the abusive use&nbsp;of the terms “ Lutherans,” “ Papists ’’ and “ Huguenots,” and&nbsp;advocated deferring all action until a council should have been&nbsp;called. The deputies of the clergy were naturally conservative,&nbsp;but advocated certain reforms, an abolition of the Concordat,&nbsp;and a re-establishment of the older Pragmatic Sanction. The&nbsp;noblesse wêre divided on the matter of toleration, but the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">cahiers</span><span class="font0"> (lists of grievances and suggestions for reform) submitted&nbsp;by the Third Estate demanded, besides regular meetings of the&nbsp;estates every five years, complete toleration and a reform of the&nbsp;Church. This grew a little later into the recommendation that&nbsp;the revenues and possessions of the French Church should be&nbsp;appropriated by the government, which, after properly subsidizing the clergy, might hope, it was estimated, that a surplus&nbsp;of twenty-two millions of livres would accrue to the State. Two&nbsp;hundred and thirty years later this plan was realized in the&nbsp;Civil Constitution of the Clergy. The deliberations of 1561&nbsp;resulted in the various reforms, the suspension of persecution&nbsp;and the liberation of Huguenot prisoners. These were not&nbsp;accorded freedom of worship, but naturally took advantage of&nbsp;the situation to carry on their services more publicly than ever&nbsp;before. An unsuccessful effort was made at the conference of&nbsp;Poissy to bring the two religious parties together; Beza had an&nbsp;opportunity to defend the Calvinistic cause, and Lainez, the&nbsp;general of the Order of Jesus, that of the bishop of Rome. The&nbsp;government remained tolerant toward the movement, and in&nbsp;January 1562 the Huguenots were given permission to hold&nbsp;public services outside the walls of fortified towns and were not&nbsp;forbidden to meet in private houses within the walls. Catherine,&nbsp;who had promoted these measures, cared nothing for the&nbsp;Protestants, but desired the support of the Bourbon princes.&nbsp;The country was Catholic, and disturbances inevitably occurred,&nbsp;culminating in the attack of the duke of Guise and his troops&nbsp;on the Protestants at Vassy, less than two months after the&nbsp;issuing of the edict.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is impossible to review here the Wars of Religion which distracted France, from the “ massacre of Vassy ” to the&nbsp;publication of the edict of Nantes, thirty-six years&nbsp;later. Religious issues became more and more dominated by purely political and dynastic ambitions, and&nbsp;the whole situation was constantly affected by the&nbsp;policy of Philip II. and the struggle going on in the&nbsp;Netherlands. Henry IV. was admirably fitted to&nbsp;reunite France once more, and, after a superficial&nbsp;conversion to the Catholic faith, to meet the needs of&nbsp;his former co-religionists, the Huguenots. The edict of Nantes&nbsp;recapitulated and codified the provisions of a series of earlier&nbsp;edicts of toleration, which had come with each truce during the&nbsp;previous generation. Liberty of conscience in religious matters&nbsp;was secured and the right of private worship to those of the&nbsp;“ so-called Reformed religion.’’ Public worship was permitted&nbsp;everywhere where it had existed in 1506-1597, in two places&nbsp;within each </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">bailliage</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sénéchaussée,</span><span class="font0"> and in the châteaux of the&nbsp;Protestant nobility, with slight restrictions in the case of lower&nbsp;nobility. Protestants were placed upon a political equality and&nbsp;made eligible to all public offices. To ensure these rights, they&nbsp;were left in military control of two hundred towns, including&nbsp;La Rochelle, Montauban and Montpellier. Jealous of their&nbsp;“ sharing the State with the king,’’ Richelieu twenty-five years&nbsp;later reduced the exceptional privileges of the Huguenots, and&nbsp;with the advent of Louis XIV. they began to suffer renewed&nbsp;persecution, which the king at last flattered himself had so far&nbsp;reduced their number that in 1685 he revoked the edict of Nantes&nbsp;and reduced the Protestants to the status of outlaws. It was&nbsp;not until 1786 that they were restored to their civil rights,&nbsp;and by the Declaration of the Rights of Man, in 1789, to their&nbsp;religious freedom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Contemporaneously with the Wars of Religion in France *a long and terrible struggle between the king of Spain and his&nbsp;Dutch and Belgian provinces had resulted in the&nbsp;formation of a Protestant state—the United Netherlands&nbsp;, which was destined to play an important rôle&nbsp;in the history of the Reformed religion. Open both&nbsp;to German and French influences, the Netherlands&nbsp;had been the scene of the first executions of Lutherans;&nbsp;they had been a centre of Anabaptist agitation ; but Calvinism&nbsp; finally triumphed in the Confession of Dordrecht, 1572, since Calvin’s system of church government did not, like</span></p>
