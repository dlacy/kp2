<p><span class="font1">An exploring party from Jamestown, under command of Captain Christopher Newport (c. 1565-1617), and including&nbsp;Captain John Smith, sailed up the James river in 1607, and on&nbsp;the 3rd of June erected a cross on one of the small islands&nbsp;opposite the site of the present city. The first permanent&nbsp;settlement within the present limits of the city was made in 1609&nbsp;in the district long known as Rockett’s. Later in the same year&nbsp;Captain Smith bought from the Indians a tract of land on the&nbsp;east bank of the river, about 3 m. below this settlement, and near&nbsp;the site of the present Powhatan. This tract he named “ Nonesuch,” and here he attempted to establish a small body of soldiers&nbsp;who had occupied a less favourable site in the vicinity; but they&nbsp;objected to the change and, being attacked by the Indians,&nbsp;sought the protection of Smith, who made prisoners of their&nbsp;leaders, with the result, apparently, that the settlement was&nbsp;abandoned. In 1645 Fort Charles was erected at the falls of&nbsp;the James as a frontier defence. In 1676, during “ Bacon’s&nbsp;Rebellion,” a party of Virginians under Bacon’s command&nbsp;killed about 150 Indians who were defending a fort on a hill a&nbsp;short distance east of the site of Richmond in the “ Battle of&nbsp;Bloody Run,” so called because the blood of the slain savages is&nbsp;said to have coloured the brook (or “ run ”) at the base of the&nbsp;hill.
