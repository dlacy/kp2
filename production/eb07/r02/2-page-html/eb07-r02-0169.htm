<p><span class="font0">rious opinions, of which the most commonly received is tl.at which represents them as sprung from the great family&nbsp;of the Mongolian Tartars, and in some way connected with&nbsp;those tribes called by the Chinese, Hioung-Nou. But there&nbsp;was also among them a manifest mixture of various nomad&nbsp;tribes, of which the predominant were probably the Finnish.&nbsp;It would indeed be absurd to imagine that a mighty migration of nomad tribes, sweeping onwards from the wilds&nbsp;of Mongolia to the Tanais (Don) and the Palus Mæotis&nbsp;(Sea of Azov), could be other than a mingled mass of all&nbsp;the various tribes whom they had conquered and absorbed&nbsp;in their tide-like course. Crossing the Tanais, the Huns&nbsp;drove before them the nations north of the Danube ; and&nbsp;these uprooted nations in their turn threw themselves headlong upon the Roman provinces, both impelled and supported hy the countless hordes that continued to press&nbsp;resistlessly behind. The Goths, unable to repel these terrible barbarians, sought and obtained permission to settle&nbsp;in the waste lands of Thrace, which formed part of the Roman province of Mœsia. Unfortunately for both themselves&nbsp;and the empire, the Goths had been taught Arianism, and&nbsp;as a very violent hatred subsisted between the Arians and&nbsp;the orthodox Christians, the Goths neither were well received by the Romans, nor entertained sentiments of much&nbsp;friendship towards them. And not less unfortunately, the&nbsp;officers whom Valens appointed to superintend the new&nbsp;settlements ofthe Goths were men of the most depraved&nbsp;and abandoned characters, and treated them with the utmost perfidy and cruelty. At length Lupicinus, the chief&nbsp;of these officers, attempted at a feast to murder Fritigern&nbsp;and the other Gothic leaders ; but the plot being prematurely&nbsp;discovered, the Gothic chiefs escaped, and arming their followers, massacred the greater part of the Roman troops in&nbsp;the province. In the mean time, the Huns advancing on&nbsp;their devastating career, drove the Ostrogoths before them&nbsp;into the territories possessed by the Visigoths ; and thus&nbsp;mightily swelled the strength of the infuriated Goths.&nbsp;Uniting themselves under Fritigern, the Goths laid waste&nbsp;Thrace, Macedon, and Thessaly, and approached to the&nbsp;very walls of Constantinople.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In this state of affairs, Valens, assailed by a strong and vengeful foe, applied to Gratian, the young emperor of the&nbsp;west, for aid. He had been engaged in warring successfully against the Germans, and was at that time in the field ;&nbsp;but seeing the urgent necessity of saving the eastern empire, he immediately marched to the assistance of his uncle.&nbsp;Before his arrival, the Gothic chief, Fritigern, thinking it&nbsp;lawful to use deceit against a deceitful foe, found means to&nbsp;draw Valens into a situation in which he was almost compelled to fight, without waiting for the arrival of succour.&nbsp;A decisive battle was fought near Adrianople ; Valens himself was killed on the field, and nearly two-thirds of the&nbsp;Roman army were cut to pieces. Not even on the dreadful field of Cannae had the Romans sustained a more fatal&nbsp;overthrow ; and the stern unconquerable spirit of the republic being no more, the fate of the eastern empire seemed to be inevitable. But what direct force might not&nbsp;have been able to accomplish, was effected by a rare combination of wisdom, valour, and probity. In consequence&nbsp;of his wars with the invaders of his own dominions, Gratian was unable to undertake the conduct ofthe war against&nbsp;the Goths ; but he called to his aid Theodosius, son of that&nbsp;Theodosius whom he had unjustly put to death, and whose&nbsp;death he had bitterly repented. Him he now raised to the&nbsp;dignity of emperor, and gave him at once the eastern empire, with the addition of the province of Illyricum. Theodosius thus raised to the purple, speedily showed himself&nbsp;worthy of the high trust committed to him, that of restoring the fortunes of a falling empire. The courage of the&nbsp;Romans had been so much shaken by their late defeat, that&nbsp;Theodosius did not think it prudent to hazard a general</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">engagement with the Goths ; but, like another Fabius, he saved his own forces, harassed the enemy, taught his men&nbsp;that the Goths were not invincible, and gradually restored&nbsp;to them their courage, perfected by improved discipline&nbsp;and temperate caution. At length Fritigern died ; and the&nbsp;Goths having no longer a leader capable of controlling the&nbsp;haughty chiefs of their ill-compacted confederacy, became&nbsp;disunited, and one by one submitted to the superior skill,&nbsp;policy, and authority of Theodosius. Great numbers of&nbsp;them received the pay, and were incorporated into the&nbsp;armies of that empire which they had so recently been on&nbsp;the brink of destroying, and the remainder voluntarily engaged to defend the Danube against the Huns. Thus, in&nbsp;about four years, the eastern empire was rescued from the&nbsp;most formidable danger by which it had ever been assailed,&nbsp;and seemed once more in a state of security.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">While Theodosius was thus employed, another calamity befel the western empire. The character and conduct of&nbsp;Gratian had defrauded the fair expectations formed of him&nbsp;on his accession, and exposed him to the contempt of the&nbsp;more warlike part of his subjects. Maximus, who held the&nbsp;chief command in Britain, revolted against him, passed&nbsp;into Gaul, and prepared to dethrone the feeble emperor.&nbsp;The army violated its allegiance, and Gratian having fled&nbsp;towards Italy, was overtaken and killed at Lyons. The&nbsp;death of this prince left his young brother Valentinian II.&nbsp;nominal emperor of the west, though the usurper Maximus&nbsp;assumed that title. Theodosius was obliged to conceal his&nbsp;resentment against the murderer ofhis benefactor, not being&nbsp;yet in a condition to quit his own dominions ; and he even&nbsp;entered into a treaty with him, leaving him in the undisturbed possession of Gaul and Britain. But Maximus,&nbsp;encouraged by the success with which his rebellion had&nbsp;been followed, resolved to deprive Valentinian of even&nbsp;the nominal power which he enjoyed in Italy. Unable&nbsp;to defend his territories, he fled to Theodosius, and besought his aid. Theodosius having completed the pacification of his own dominions, immediately marched against&nbsp;the usurper, defeated him in two successive engagements,&nbsp;and his own troops having yielded him up, put him to&nbsp;death. Valentinian II. was thus restored to the throne&nbsp;of the western empire ; a throne which his weak character&nbsp;did not enable him to fill and to defend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Theodosius, after his triumph over Maximus, resolved to visit Rome, and aid his imperial pupil in reforming the&nbsp;abuses prevalent in that city. This visit is memorable on&nbsp;account of the decrees published by Theodosius for the&nbsp;complete suppression of idolatrous worship in Rome. All&nbsp;sacrifices were prohibited under heavy penalties, the idols&nbsp;were defaced, and the temples of the gods abandoned to&nbsp;ruin and contempt. These decrees met but a feeble resistance, and from that time may be dated the complete&nbsp;and final overthrow- of pagan idolatry in Rome. It would&nbsp;be an easy though an unpleasant task, to show how the ill-judging teachers of Christianity, in their zeal to make converts, in order to make the transition more easy to the&nbsp;pagan multitude, adopted many of the rites and festivals of&nbsp;the ancient idolatry, assigning merely to some saint what&nbsp;had been ascribed to some subordinate deity, and thus introduced much of the ill-disguised heathenism which forms&nbsp;so large a proportion of papal superstition: but this we leave&nbsp;to the pen of the ecclesiastical historian. Having thus&nbsp;completed the triumph of Christianity over paganism, Theodosius returned to the east, and employed himself in the&nbsp;kindred task of putting an end to the heresies ofthe church,&nbsp;establishing the predominancy of the orthodox over the&nbsp;Arian party.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Valentinian II. had but a short time recovered possession </span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font0">the empire of the west, when he was murdered by Ar-bogastes, a Frank of a bold and warlike character, who had&nbsp;obtained a great ascendancy over him.
