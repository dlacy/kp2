<p>The difference between raiſins dried in the fun and thoſc dried in ovens, is very obvious : the former are ſweat and pleaſant, but the latter have a latent acidity with the ſweetneſs that renders them much leſs agreeable.</p><p>The cpmmon way of drying grapes for raiſins, is to tie two or three bunches of them together while yet on the vine, aud dip them into a hot lixivium of wood-aſhes, with a little of the oil of olives in it. This diſ-poſes them to ſhrink and wrinkle ; and after this they are left on the vine three or four days ſeparated on ſticks in an horizontal ſituation, and then dried in the fun at leiſure, after being cut from the tree. The ſineſt aud beſt raiſins are thoſe called in ſome places <hi rend="italic">Damaſ-tus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Tube roifins ;</hi> which are diſtinguiſhed from the others by their ſize and figure : they are flat and wrinkled on the ſurface, foft and juicy within, and near an inch long ; and, when freſh and growing on the bunch, are of the ſize and ſhape of a large olive.</p><p>The raiſins of the ſun, and jar-raiſins, are all dried by the heat of the ſun ; and theſe are the ſorts uſed in medicine. However, all the kinds have much the ſame virtues : they are all nutritive and balſamic ; they are allowed to be attenuant, are ſaid to be good in nephritic complaints, and are an ingredient in pectoral decoc-tions : in which caſes, as alſo in all others where aſtrin-gency is not required of them, they ſhould have the ſtones carefully taken oκt.</p><p><hi rend="italic">RA is</hi> <hi rend="italic"><hi rend="smallcaps"> in</hi></hi> <hi rend="italic">-Wine.</hi> SeewiNE.</p>
