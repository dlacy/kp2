<p><span class="font1">REGISTER, a record of facts, proceedings, acts, events, names, &amp;c., entered regularly for reference in a volume kept for&nbsp;that purpose, also the volume in which the entries are made.&nbsp;The Fr. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">registre</span><span class="font1"> is taken from the Med.

The keeper of&nbsp;a register was, until the beginning of the 19th century, usually&nbsp;known as a “ register,” but that title has in Great Britain now&nbsp;been superseded by “ registrar ”; it still survives in the Lord&nbsp;Clerk Register, an officer of state in Scotland, nominally the&nbsp;official keeper of the national records, whose duties are performed by the Deputy“ Clerk Register. In the United States&nbsp;the title is still “ register.” The term “ register ” has also been&nbsp;applied to mechanical contrivances for the automatic registration&nbsp;or recording of figures, &amp;c. (see Cash Register), to a stop in an&nbsp;organ, to the compass of a voice or musical instrument, and also&nbsp;to an apparatus for regulating the in- and outflow of air, heat,&nbsp;steam, smoke or the like. Some of these instances of the&nbsp;application of the term are apparently due to a confusion in&nbsp;etymology, with Lat. regere, to rule, regulate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Parish Registers were instituted in England by an order of Thomas Cromwell, as vicegerent to Henry VIII., “ supreme&nbsp;hedd undre Christ of the Church of Englande,” in September&nbsp;1538. The idea appears to have been of Spanish origin,&nbsp;Cardinal Ximenes having instituted, as archbishop of Toledo,&nbsp;registers of baptisms in 1497. They included, under the&nbsp;above order, baptisms, marriages and burials, which were to&nbsp;be recorded weekly. In 1597 it was ordered by the Convocation&nbsp;of Canterbury that parchment books should be provided for&nbsp;the registers and that transcripts should be made on parchment of existing registers on paper, and this order was repeated&nbsp;in the 70th canon of 1603. The transcripts then made now&nbsp;usually represent the earliest registers. It was further provided at both these dates that an annual transcript of the&nbsp;register should be sent to the bishop for preservation in the&nbsp;diocesan registry, which was the origin of the “ bishop’s transcripts.” The “ Directory for the publique worship of God,”&nbsp;passed by parliament in 1645, provided for the date of birth&nbsp;being also registered, and in August 1653, an Act of “ Bare-bones’ Parliament ” made a greater change, substituting&nbsp;civil “ parish registers ” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(sic)</span><span class="font1"> for the clergy, and ordering&nbsp;them to record births, banns, marriages and burials. The&nbsp;“ register ” was also to publish the banns and a justice to perform the marriage. The register books were well kept under&nbsp;this civil system, but at the Restoration the old system was&nbsp;resumed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A tax upon births, marriages and burials imposed in 1694 led to the clergy being ordered to register all births, apart&nbsp;from baptisms, but the act soon expired and births were not&nbsp;again registered till 1836. Lord Hardwicke's Marriage Act&nbsp;(1754), by its rigid provisions, increased the registration of&nbsp;marriages by the parochial clergy and prescribed a form of&nbsp;entry. In 1812 parish registers became the subject of parliamentary enactment, owing to the discovery of their deficiencies.&nbsp;Rose’s Act provided for their safer custody, for efficient bishops,&nbsp;transcripts, and for uniformity of system. This act continued&nbsp;to regulate the registers till their supersession for practical&nbsp;purposes, in 1837, by civil registration under the act of 1836.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In age, completeness and condition they vary much. A blue book on the subject was published in 1833, but the returns&nbsp;it contains are often inaccurate. A few begin even earlier&nbsp;than Cromwell’s order, the oldest being that of Tipton, Staffs,&nbsp;(1513). Between 800 and 900, apparently, begin in 1538 or&nbsp;1539. The entries were originally made in Latin, but this&nbsp;usage died out early in the 17th century: decay and the&nbsp;crabbed handwriting of the time render the earlier registers&nbsp;extremely difficult to read. There is general agreement as&nbsp;to the shocking neglect of these valuable records in the past,&nbsp;and the loss of volumes appears to have continued even through&nbsp;the 19th century. Their custody is legally vested in the&nbsp;parochial clergy and their wardens, but several proposals have&nbsp;been made for their removal to central depositories. The&nbsp;fees for searching them are determined by the act of 1836,&nbsp;which prescribes half a crown for each certified extract, and&nbsp;sixpence a year for searching, with a shilling for the first year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The condition of the “ bishops’ transcripts ” was, throughout, much worse than that of the parish registers, there being no funds provided for their custody. The report on Public&nbsp;Records in 1800 drew attention to their neglect, but, in spite&nbsp;of the provisions in Rose’s Act (1812), little or nothing was done,&nbsp;and, in spite of their importance as checking, and even sometimes supplementing deficient parish registers, they remained&nbsp;“ unarranged, unindexed and unconsultable.” Of recent&nbsp;years, however, some improvement has been made. It has&nbsp;also been discovered that transcripts from “ peculiars ” exist&nbsp;in other than episcopal registries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Outside the parochial registers, which alone were official in character, there were, till 1754, irregular marriage registers,&nbsp;of which those of the Fleet prison are the most famous, and&nbsp;also registers of private chapels in London. Those of the&nbsp;Fleet and of Mayfair chapel were deposited with the registrar-general, but not authenticated. The registers of dissenting&nbsp;chapels remained unofficial till an act of 1840 validated a&nbsp;number which had been authenticated, and was extended to&nbsp;many others in 1858. Useful information on these registers,&nbsp;now mostly deposited with the registrar-general, will be found&nbsp;in Sims’ </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Manual,</span><span class="font1"> which also deals with those of private chapels,&nbsp;of English settlements abroad preserved in London, and with&nbsp;English Roman Catholic registers. These last, however, begin&nbsp;only under George II. and are restricted to certain London&nbsp;chapels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The printing of parish registers has of late made much progress, but the field is so vast that the rate is relatively&nbsp;slow. There is a Parish Register Society, and a section of&nbsp;the Harleian Society engaged on the same work, as well as&nbsp;some county societies and also one for Dublin.
