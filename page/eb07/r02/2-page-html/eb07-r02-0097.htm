<p><span class="font0">in the field where she excels too, she is much of a mannerist ; the same characters under other names, the same incidents under a thin disguise, re-appear in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Evelina, Cecilia, </span><span class="font0">and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Camilla.</span><span class="font0"> Even the graces of style which she had&nbsp;shewn in her earlier works, in a great measure forsook her&nbsp;in her last novel, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Wanderer;</span><span class="font0"> a tissue of improbable distresses and silly refinements of sensibility, conveyed in language which is neither good English nor good sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Canterbury Tales</span><span class="font0"> deserve notice on account of the interesting and highly original story of Kruitzner, or the&nbsp;German’s Tale, by Harriet Lee, on which Lord Byron&nbsp;founded his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Werner.</span><span class="font0"> The tales contributed to the work by&nbsp;her sister Sophia, such as the Two Emilys, and the Clergyman’s Tale, though less striking, are written with genuine feeling and tenderness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It may be observed, however, in those female novelists to whom we have last adverted that, though the marvellous is&nbsp;thrown aside, and the characters are taken from common life,&nbsp;the sentiments and tone of feeling are yet decidedly strained&nbsp;beyond the natural pitch. The characters display a degree&nbsp;of romantic affection and aprodigal expenditure of sensibility&nbsp;for which the cares and distractions of real life, we fear, afford but little leisure. It remained for Miss Austin (1775-1817,) to shew what a charm might be imparted to truthful&nbsp;pictures of life, as we really see it around us in the quiet&nbsp;monotony of domestic arrangements, with its interchanges&nbsp;of poetry and prose, business and strong feeling, and dialogues at balls and parties alternating with the secret griefs&nbsp;of the heart; just such a picture, in short, as Asmodeus would&nbsp;present, could he remove the roof of many an English home,&nbsp;and place us beside the hearths of the Knightleys, Bennets,&nbsp;Woodhouses, and Bertrams by whom they are inhabited. No species of novel writing exposes itself to a severer&nbsp;trial, since it not only resigns all Bayes<sup>,</sup> pretensions “ to elevate the imagination and bring you off in some extraordinary way,” but by professing to give us pictures of our&nbsp;ordinary acquaintances, in their common garb, places its&nbsp;productions within that range of criticism, where all are&nbsp;equally judges, and where Crispin is entitled to dictate to&nbsp;Apelles. And yet with such fine perception and perfect&nbsp;truth of keeping has Miss Austin performed her task, that&nbsp;we never miss in her novels the excitement of uncommon&nbsp;events, and rarely feel her simple annals of English life to be&nbsp;tedious or unworthy of the dignity of fiction. In reading&nbsp;them, we have the feeling of being actually in company with&nbsp;α group of highly respectable persons, of no remarkable ability, though with good sense and a fair proportion of right&nbsp;feeling; with a sprinkling of fools, oddities, and village gossips ; and the conversation, the little incidents, and displays&nbsp;of temper, and sallies of good humour or bad, and small plottings and counter-plottings among the guests, are exactly&nbsp;such as any contemplative Jaquez who should establish himself in an English country house or rectory for a fortnight,&nbsp;and watch the bye play of the society about him, might set&nbsp;down in his note book ; only skilfully selected and arranged,&nbsp;thc superfluities lopped off, the dullness thrown into the&nbsp;background, and the whole wrought up into a picture,&nbsp;painted indeed in sober hues, but with unequalled delicacy of&nbsp;touch, and an all-pervading harmony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">All the novels of Miss Austin closelyresemble each other; but </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Northaηger Abbey,</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sense and Sensibility,</span><span class="font0"> are of a&nbsp;more puerile cast than the others, and betray a more unformed taste. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pride and Prejudice,</span><span class="font0"> particularly in the&nbsp;characters of the Bennets, was an improvement on the two for-rner, but </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Emma, Mansfield</span><span class="font0"> PαrA,and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Persuasion</span><span class="font0"> are justly&nbsp;regarded as her most finished works. Some scenes in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Persuasion,</span><span class="font0"> the last work of this gifted authoress, have always&nbsp;appeared to us models of unobtrusive tenderness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Some one has described the novels of Miss Edgeworth as a sort of essence of common sense ; and the definition is not&nbsp;inappropriate, for she is the most anti-sentimental of novelists. The sway of the stronger passions she has almost&nbsp;excluded from her Tales. Love is indeed tile only one&nbsp;which has found entrance, and to qualify him for admission,&nbsp;his wings have been sorely clipped and trimmed, and reason constantly placed as a gentleman usher over him. Miss&nbsp;Edgeworth has even less toleration for splendid faults or&nbsp;bursts of enthusiasm than Miss Austin. Her chief aim is to&nbsp;rebuke folly, by ridicule and comic humour ; to unteach bad&nbsp;habits of mind, to substitute in their stead prudence, firmness,&nbsp;temper, perseverance, and habits of absolute truth, a process&nbsp;which she generally represents as effected by a gradual series&nbsp;of efforts and consequent ameliorations, which are within the&nbsp;power of all minds of ordinary resolution. Her favourite characters are either persons of well-balanced minds, with sound&nbsp;headsanda smattering of physical science, who act rightly and&nbsp;honourably,but always think twice before they act, and weigh&nbsp;inthescalesofutilitywhatare generally considered as matters&nbsp;of feeling, like thePercys: or they are personages who, spoiled by indolence and bad education, succeed by a course of&nbsp;self-discipline, in curing their intellectual or moral maladies,&nbsp;and becoming useful and honourable members of society,&nbsp;like the hero of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ennui,</span><span class="font0"> Lord Glenthorn. Miss Edgeworth&nbsp;brings to her task the results of much observation of character, particularly that of her countrymen ; a quick perception of the humourous, a dramatic liveliness of dialogue,&nbsp;a high sense of all that is honourable and decorous, with a&nbsp;scorn of meanness and evasion, and that tone of good society, which her pictures, often drawn from fashionable life,&nbsp;demand. If her novels are at times too obviously monitory&nbsp;and didactic, and the ferule peeps out rather alarmingly behind the schoolmistress, this defect, we fear, is in a great&nbsp;measure inseparable from the very qualities which constitute the strength of her mind, and from the conception she&nbsp;had formed for herself of the ideal of novel writing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is singular that a novelist of this rationalizing spirit, and so intolerant of all moral marvels, should have so frequently admitted great improbabilities into her plots, where&nbsp;the catastrophe is often brought about either by some one very&nbsp;unlikely event, or by a concurrence of events, and fortunate&nbsp;accidents, the combination of which render the circumstance&nbsp;at the least passing strange. Miss Edgeworth is also fond of&nbsp;making the discovery of important events turn on little trifles&nbsp;of circumstantial evidence, which are too artificially prepared, and after all are not satisfactory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The impression, however, which the perusal of her best novels, such as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ennui</span><span class="font0"> and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Absentee,</span><span class="font0"> leaves on the mind,&nbsp;is that of high respect for the sagacity, grasp of mind and&nbsp;rectitude of judgment of the author, whose {lower of dramatizing a moral lesson has not often been excelled. And&nbsp;it is gratifying to see that, in the last work of Miss Edge-worth, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Helen,</span><span class="font0"> there appears no diminution of her powers.&nbsp;In wit it is equal to any of her former novels ; in pathetic&nbsp;scenes, superior to most of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">At the period when Sir Walter Scott (1814), produced the first of that long file of romances which have since obtained a more than European reputation, the public taste,&nbsp;in regard to novel writing, seemed to have sunk to a low&nbsp;ebb. Miss Edgeworth indeed was popular ; for the wit&nbsp;and good sense of her dialogue, and her happy pictures of&nbsp;Irish character, found favour in the sight even of the readers of circulating libraries ; but the merits of Miss Austin’s&nbsp;more unobtrusive pictures of life were comparatively unknown. At best she was confounded with the writers of&nbsp;Winters in London, or Winters in Paris, and shared a dubious&nbsp;favour with the romantic effusions of Francis Lathom and&nbsp;the other labourers of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Minerva</span><span class="font0"> press, so called, we presume, upon the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">lu&lt;ms a non lucendo</span><span class="font0"> principle, from the goddess of wisdom having so little to do with its productions.&nbsp;Translations, too, from Augustus La Fontaine’s homely but&nbsp;rather vulgar pictures of'little German </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Krah-winkel</span><span class="font0"> towns,&nbsp;or tbe broad and indecent extravagances of Pigault le Brun,</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
