OXYGENFRAMEWORKS FOLDER

The OxygenFrameworks folder contains the original stylesheets provided with Oxygen. All of this material is copied from C:\Program Files\Oxygen XML Editor 20\frameworks.

 We retain the original folder structure for everything in use but omit unusued folders to make it easier to navigate. Additional folders should be added as needed. Any modifications to these stylesheets should be made here, not in the original folder.

The transformations we use for TEI are in the "stylesheet" folder:

oxygenframeworks\tei\xml\tei\stylesheet\docx

To edit the stylesheets in Oxygen, simply add the "stylesheet" folder to any Oxygen project.
