The basisphenoid is prolonged forwards into a long bony rostrum, on the upper surface of which</p><p>the cartilaginous</p><p>rods (the per</p><p>sistent <hi rend="italic">trabecu-</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">læ cranii)</hi>  ex</p><p>tend forwards to</p><p>blend with the</p><p>median cartilage</p><p>of the ethmoi</p><p>dal region. The</p><p>supraoccipital is</p><p>excluded from</p><p>the margin of</p><p>the foramen</p><p>magnum by the</p><p>exoccipital. The</p><p>frontal bones descend laterally to the dorsum of this basi-sphenoidal rostrum and then turn inwards to meet together in the median lines on the floor of the cranial cavity. The parietals also descend laterally but unite with the basisphenoid by suture. There are a pair of nasals, and also lachrymals and postfrontals, but there is no jugal or quadrate jugal. The palatines do not bound the posterior nares behind. They are widely separated, and their long axes are longitudinal. The maxillæ may be long and may support a number of teeth, as in most non-venomous Snakes, or maybe very short and support a single large fang, as, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi>  in Vipers.</p><p>The small-mouthed Serpents, or <hi rend="italic">Angiostomata,</hi>  have the pterygoids separated from the quadrates. The squamosal is small or absent, the quadrate being attached directly to the cranium. They have no postfrontal and no transverse bone, while the palatine bones have their long axis transverse, and meet, or nearly meet, on the under surface of the skull. The two rami of the mandible are also closely united together. In other details of cranial structure they agree generally with</p><p>the <hi rend="italic">Eurystomata.</hi></p><p>The hyoid is rudimentary, and only consists of a pair of cartilaginous threads, medianly united and lying side by side beneath the trachea.</p><p>In the Chclonians the skull presents certain resemblances to that of the Crocodil-ians. Thus the quadrate is immovably fixed and its upper part is joined by the pterygoid, and there is a quadrato-jugal bone. The pterygoids and palatines unite by suture and form horizontal plates beneath the <hi rend="italic">basis cranii.</hi></p><p>Nevertheless these bones differ widely from their homologues in the Crocodiles inasmuch as the posterior nares open in front of the pterygoids and are bounded by the palatines and the azygous vomer. The epiotic bone is generally quite distinct from the exoccipital. There are large parietals, which send down a process that serves the purpose of the absent alisphenoid. In front of this, the sides and front of the cranial cavity are unossified.</p><p>There are a pair of frontals, and in front of them a pair of bones which bound the anterior nares above. There may</p><lb/><p>be one or two premaxillæ. Sometimes, as <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi>  in <hi rend="italic">Chelone, </hi>the parietal, postfrontal, jugal, and squamosal send out plate-like processes which unite and form a sort of false outer skull covering in the temporal fossa, and quite external to the real outer wall of the cranial cavity. Thus the cranium of these Reptiles is, as it were, at the opposite extreme to that of the Serpents as regards massiveness, solidity, and the immovability of its several parts one on another.</p><p>It maybe excessively flat and depressed, as in <hi rend="italic">Chelydra.</hi></p><p>The dentary bone of the mandible is azygous, as in Birds.</p><p>The hyoid consists of two pairs of cornua, whereof the</p><lb/><p>anterior may or may not be the larger, attached to a</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
