Under the empire massive blocks, whether of tufa, travertine, or marble, are set without any mortar. It must, however, be observed that in these early instances the “ mortar ” is but a thin stratum of lime, little thicker than stout    paper,</p><p>used not as a cement to bind the blocks together, but simply to give the joints a smoothly fitting surface.    The</p><p>actual binding together was done by clamps and dowels, as well as by the mass and weight of the great blocks used. Except in the earliest masonry, each block was</p><p>Verycarefully fastened, not only to the next blocks on the same course, which was done with double dove-tailed dowels of wood, but also to those above and below with stout iron clamps, run with lead (Vitr., ii. 8).@@<hi rend="sup">2</hi> In more ornamental marble</p><p>work bronze clamps were often used.</p><p>When concrete was employed it was faced either with blocks of opus quadratum <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi>  the Servian wall along the Aventine) or with opus incertum—small irregularly shaped blocks of tufa 3 to 6 inches across, with pointed ends driven into the concrete while it was soft, and worked smooth on the face only (see fig. 3). Thirdly, in the 1st century b.c. opus reticulatum,@@<hi rend="sup">3 </hi>also of tufa, was largely used alone ; after that it began to be mixed with brickwork. It is very neat in appearance, and is often fitted with great care, though it was generally covered with stucco. The so-called “house of Livia” on the Palatine is a good example of the earlier sort, when the quoins were made of small rectangular blocks of tufa.</p><p>The palace of Caligula has it with quoins of brick facing. Though in Rome opus reticulatum was always made of tufa, in the neighbourhood</p><p>of the city it was sometimes of peperino or even lava, where these materials were found on the spot.</p><lb/><p>Of concrete walls faced with burnt bricks no dated example 1 earlier than the middle of the 1st century n.c. is known. Thei Pantheon (27 b.c. ) is the most important early specimen of certain date. The bricks used are always triangular in shape, so as to present a large surface on the face with little expenditure of brick, and also to improve the bond with the concrete behind (see fig. 4). Even party walls of small rooms, only 7 inches thick, are not built solid, but have a concrete core faced with brick triangles about 3 inches long. Owing</p><p>to this method of forming the walls it was necessarily to support the facing until the concrete was set, which appears to have been done with a λvooden framing covered with planks on the inside.</p><p>In some cases the planks were nailed outside the wooden uprights, as was done with the unfaced concrete walls (see below), and then a series of perpendicular grooves appear in the face of the brickwork. Walls faced with opus reticulatum must have been supported temporarily in the same way.</p><p>The character of the brick facing is a great help towards determining the date of Roman buildings ; it has been stated that this can be done simply by measuring the number of brick courses that go to a foot,—the more the bricks the earlier the work. This, however, is not the case. In early work the bricks are thick and the joints thin, while in later times the reverse is the case. Thus brickwork of the time of Severus and later usually has more bricks to the foot than that of the Flavian period. The following list gives a few characteristic specimens of different dates.</p><p>The length of the bricks as it appears on the face is no guide to the date, owing to the fact that one or more of the sharp points of the brick triangles were very frequently broken off before they were used. Moreover, varieties both in quality of workmanship and size of the bricks often occur in work of the same date ; a new gang of workmen oι<hi rend="sup">,</hi> a batch of bricks from a fresh<hi rend="italic">figlina</hi>  might easily occasion this. In the remains of Nero’s Golden House great varieties appear, and some of the walls in the inferior rooms are faced with very irregular and careless brickwork.@@<hi rend="sup">4</hi>  Special care and neatness were always employed in the rare cases when the wall was not to be covered with stucco, which in the absence of marble was usually spread over both inside and outside walls. All these circumstances make great caution necessary in judging of dates ; fortunately after the 1st centuryA.D., and in some cases even earlier, stamps impressed on bricks, and especially on the largo tiles used for arches, give clearer indications. The reason of tlιo almost universal use of smooth facings either of opus reticulatum or of brick over concrete walls is a very puzzling question ; for concrete itself forms an excellent ground for the stucco coating or backing to the marble slabs, while the stucco adheres with difficulty to a smooth facing, and is very liable to fall away. The modern practice of raking out the joints to form a key was not employed by the Romans, but before the mortar was hard they studded the face of the wall with marble plugs and iron or bronze nails driven into the joints, so as to give a hold for the stucco—a great waste both of labour and material.@@<hi rend="sup">5</hi>  The quality of the mortar varies according to its date : during the 1st and 2d centuries it is of most remarkable hardness,—made of lime with a mixture of coarse pozzolana of a bright red colour ; in the 3d century it began to be inferior in quality ; and the pozzolana used under the later empire is brown instead of red.</p><p>Concrete was at first always made of lumps of tufa ; then travertine, lava, broken bricks, and even marble were used, in fact all the chips and fragments of the mason’s yard. Under the empire the concrete used was of travertine or lava mostly for foundations, of tufa or broken bricks for walls, and of tufa or pumice-stone (for the sake of lightness) for vaults.
