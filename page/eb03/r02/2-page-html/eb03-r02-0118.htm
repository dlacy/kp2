<p><span class="font0">ſelf on the throne. Such of the ſenators as were in the faction he found already in their places (for he had&nbsp;given them private notice to be there early) ; and the&nbsp;reſt, being ſummoned to aſſemble in Tarquin’s name,&nbsp;made what haſte they could to the appointed place,&nbsp;thinking that Servius was dead, ſince Tarquin aſſumed&nbsp;the title and functions of king. When they were all&nbsp;aſſembled, Tarquin made a long ſpeech, reviling his&nbsp;father-in-law, and repeating the invectives againſt him,&nbsp;which he had ſo oſten uttered, calling him a {lave, an&nbsp;uſurper, a favourer of the populace, and an enemy to&nbsp;the ſenate and patricians. When he was yet ſpeaking,&nbsp;Servius arrived ; and, raſhly giving way to the motions&nbsp;cſ his courage, without conſidering his ſtrength, drew&nbsp;near the throne, to pull Tarquin down ſrom it. This&nbsp;raiſed a great noiſe in the aſſembly, which drew the&nbsp;people into the temple ; but nobody ventured to part&nbsp;the two rivals. Tarquin therefore, being more ſtrong&nbsp;and vigorous, ſeized the old man by the waiſt, and,&nbsp;hurrying him through the temple, threw him down from&nbsp;the top of the ſteps into the forum. The king, who&nbsp;was grievouſly wounded, raiſed himſelf up with ſome&nbsp;difficulty : but all his friends had abandoned him ; only&nbsp;two or three of the people, touched with compaſſion,&nbsp;lent him their arms to conduct him to his palace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As they were leading him on ſo ſlowly, the cruel Tullia appeared in the forum, whither ſhe had haſtened in her chariot on the firſt report of what had paſſed&nbsp;in the ſenate. She found her huſhand on the top of&nbsp;the ſteps of the temple ; and, tranſported with joy, was&nbsp;the firſt who ſaluted him king. The example was immediately followed by the ſenators of Tarquin’s party.&nbsp;Nor was this enough for the unnatural daughter : ſhe&nbsp;took aſide her huſhand, and ſuggeſted to him, that he&nbsp;would never be ſafe ſo long as the uſurper of his crown&nbsp;was alive. Hereupon Tarquin inſtantly diſpatched ſome&nbsp;of his domeſtics to take away the remains of the unfortunate king’s life. The orders ſor the wicked parricide were no ſooner given than Tullia mounted her&nbsp;diariot again, with an air of triumph, to return home.&nbsp;The way to her houſe was through a narrow ſtreet,&nbsp;called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">vicus cyρrιus,</span><span class="font0"> or the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">goodJlreet.</span><span class="font0"> There the aſſaſſins had left the king’s body, which was ſtill panting.&nbsp;At this fight, the charioteer, ſtruck with horror, checked his horſes, and made a ſtop : but Tullia forccd him&nbsp;to go on ; and the blood of the father is ſaid to have&nbsp;dyed the wheels of the chariot, and even the clothes of&nbsp;the inhuman daughter, whence the ſtreet was called&nbsp;ever after </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">vicus ſceleratus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The new king proved a moſt deſpotic and cruel tyrant ; receiving, in the very beginning of his reign, the ſurname of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">proud,</span><span class="font0"> on account of his capricious humour&nbsp;and haughty behaviour. All controverſies whatever&nbsp;were decided by himſelf and his friends ; and he ba-»iſhed, fined, and even executed, whom he pleaſed.&nbsp;The cenſus and luſtrum, the diviſion of citizens into&nbsp;claſſes and centuries, were aboliſhed ; and all kinds of&nbsp;aſſemblies, even thoſe ſor amuſement and recreation,&nbsp;were prohibited, both in town and country. Nay, to&nbsp;ſuch a height did Tarquin carry his inſolence and tyranny, that the moſt virtuous of the ſenators went into&nbsp;voluntary baniſhment ; while many of thoſe who remain,&nbsp;ed were cut off on various pretences, that the king&nbsp;might enjoy their eſtates.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a><h4><span class="font1">Tarquin could not but be ſenſible of the extreme dan-..</span></h4></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">ger in which he ſtood by lofing the affections of his people in ſuch a manner. He therefore provided a ſuf-ficient number of ſoldiers, by way of guard, to prevent&nbsp;attempts upon his perſon ; and gave his daughter to&nbsp;Octavius Mamilius, one of the moſt conſiderable men&nbsp;among the Latins, in order to ſtrengthen his intereſt&nbsp;by this foreign alliance, in caſe of a revolt among his&nbsp;ſubjects. Mamilius accordingly procured many friends&nbsp;to his father-in-law, but he had like to have loſt them&nbsp;again by his haughty behaviour. He had deſired the&nbsp;Latins to call a national council at Ferentinum, where&nbsp;he would meet them on a day appointed by himſelf.&nbsp;The Latins accordingly met ; but after waiting for ſeveral hours, Tarquin did not appear. On this, one&nbsp;Turnus Hcrdonius, an enterpriſing and eloquent man,&nbsp;who hated Tarquin, and wàs jealous of Mamilius, made&nbsp;a ſpeech, in which he inveighed againſt the haughty&nbsp;behaviour of Tarquin, ſet forth the contempt which he&nbsp;had put upon the Latins, and concluded with deſiring&nbsp;the council to break up and return home without taking any further notice of him. Mamilius, however,&nbsp;prevailed upon them to return the day following; when&nbsp;Tarquin made his appearance, and told the aſſembly&nbsp;that his deſign in calling them together was to claim&nbsp;his right of commanding the Latin armies, which he&nbsp;ſaid was derived from his grandfather, but which he&nbsp;deſired to be confirmed to him by them. Theſe words&nbsp;were ſcarce out of his mouth, when Herdonius, riſing&nbsp;up, entered into a detail of Tarquin’s tyranny and arbitrary behaviour at Rome, which, he ſaid, the Latins&nbsp;would ſoon feel in an equal degree, if they complied&nbsp;with Tarquin’s demand. To this ſpeech the king&nbsp;made no reply at that time, but promiſed to anſwer him&nbsp;next day. In the mean time, however, he bribed the&nbsp;domeſtics of Herdonius to admit among his baggage </span><span class="font1">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">large quantity of arms : and then, telling the Latins&nbsp;that Herdonius’s oppoſition proceeded only ſrom Tarquin’s having refuſed him his daughter in marriage, accuſed him of having laid a plot to cut off all the deputies there preſent, and to uſurp a juriſdiction over the&nbsp;Latin cities ; as a proof of which he appealed to the&nbsp;arms hid among the baggage of Herdonius. The accuſed, conſcious of his innocence, deſired that his baggage might be ſearched; which being accordingly done,&nbsp;and the arme found, he was hurried away without being allowed to make any defence, and thrown into </span><span class="font1">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">baſon at the head of the ſpring of Ferentinum, where a.&nbsp;hurdle being laid upon him, and ſtones laid upon the&nbsp;hurdle, he was preſſed down into the water and drowned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In conſequence of this monſtrous treachery, Tarquin was looked upon by the Latins as their deliverer, and&nbsp;declared general of the Latin armies ; ſoon after which,&nbsp;the Hernici and two tribes of the Volſci entered into&nbsp;an alliance with him on the ſame terms. In order to&nbsp;keep theſe confederates together, Tarquin, with their&nbsp;conſent, erected a temple to Jupiter Latialis on an hill&nbsp;near the ruins of Alba, where he appointed certain&nbsp;feaſts called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Feri&lt;t Latina</span><span class="font0"> to be held on the 27th of&nbsp;April, where the ſeveral nations were to ſacriſice together, and on no account to commit any hoſtilities againſt&nbsp;each other during their continuance. The king then&nbsp;proceeded to make war on the reſt of the Volſci who&nbsp;had refuſed to<sup>-</sup>enter into an alliance with him.
