<p><span class="font0">It was ſoon diſcovered that the leading.republicans had divided into two oppoſite factions. The one of&nbsp;theſe was called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Girondßs</span><span class="font0">, becaufe V'ergniaud, Gen-ſoene, Guadet, and ſome others of its leaders, were members from the department of La Gironde. The celebrated Condorcet belonged to this party; and they were&nbsp;ſometimes denominated </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bofſfihnes,</span><span class="font0"> from M. Briſſot de&nbsp;warville their principal leader. They ſupported the&nbsp;miniſtry now in officc, at the head of which was Roland ; and the majority of the convention was obviouſly&nbsp;attachetſ to them. In oppoſition to theſc was the&nbsp;ſmaller party of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">M untrnn ;</span><span class="font0"> fo called from its members uſually ſitting in the convention on the upper feats&nbsp;of the hall. They were men poſſeſſed of lefs perfonal&nbsp;reſpectability, and fewer literary accompliſhments, but&nbsp;oſ daring and ſanguinary characters, whom the revolu-t ion had brought into public notice. At the head of&nbsp;this party were Danton and Robefpierre ; and ſubor-dinate to theſe were Couthon, Bazire, Thuriot, Mer-hn de Thionville, St Andre, Camille Demoulins, Chabot, Collot D’Herbois, Sergent, Legendre, Fabre&nbsp;D’Eglantine, Panis, and Marat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ſ heſc two parties ſhowed the diverſity of their characters in the manner in which they treated the maſſacres of the 2d and 3d of September. The Briſſotines, with&nbsp;the majority of the convention, wiſhed to bring the&nbsp;murderers to trial ; but the queſtion was always eluded&nbsp;by the other party, with the aſſiſtance of the Jacobin&nbsp;cſub and of the populace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On the 9th oſ October it was decreed, that all emigrants, when taken, ſhould ſuſſer death; and on the 15th oſ November, in confeqnence of an infurrection in the&nbsp;duchy of Deux Ponts, and an application on the part of&nbsp;the inſurgents to thc convention ſor aid,the following decree was paſſed : &quot; The national convention declare, in&nbsp;the name of the French nation, that they will grant fraternity and affiſtance to ali thoſe people who wiſh to&nbsp;procure liberty ; and they clſarge the executive power&nbsp;to ſend orders to the generals to give aſſlſtance to ſuch&nbsp;people as liave ſuffered, or are now ſuſfering, in the&nbsp;cauſe oſ liberty.” Of this decree foreign nations, with&nbsp;great reaſon, complained much, as will ſhortly appear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To return to the military affairs of the new republic. On the 12th of October General Dumourier came to Paris, and was ſpeedily ſent to commence a&nbsp;winter campaign in the Netherlands. He ſuddenly attacked the Auſtrians at the village of Boffu, and drove&nbsp;them from their ground. On the 5th oſ November he&nbsp;came in ſight of the enemy upon the heights of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Je-mappe.</span><span class="font0"> .Three rows of fortifications aroſe above each&nbsp;other defended by 100 pieces of cannon. Their right was&nbsp;covered by the village and a river, and thcir left by&nbsp;thick woods. The French were by their ovzn account&nbsp;30,000, whilſt others with great probability of truth&nbsp;compute them at double that number, and the number&nbsp;of the Auſtrians was at leaſt 20,000. At ſeven in the&nbsp;morning of the following day a heavy cannonade com-menced on both ſides, and at noon a cloſe attack was&nbsp;determined on by the French, whoſe right wing was&nbsp;commanded by Generals Bournonville and Dampierre,&nbsp;and the centre by Generals Egalité (ſon to the duke&nbsp;of Orleans who had affumed that name), Stetenboffe,&nbsp;Deſporets, and Drouet. The muſic played thepopu-Iar march of the Marſeillois, and the ſoldiers ruſhed on&nbsp;with enthuſiaſm, ſhouting &quot; Vive la nation.” The </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">en-'</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font0">gagement was warm and bloody ; the French were twice repulſed ; but their impetuoſity was at laſt irreſiſtible, and about two o’clock the enemy fled from&nbsp;their laſt entrenchments. The loſs on both ſides&nbsp;was very great, that of the Auſtrians amounting&nbsp;to 400c. This victory was deciſive of the fate of&nbsp;the Netherlands. Mons and Bruſſels ſurrendered to&nbsp;Dumourier ; 'ſmurnay, Malines, Ghent, and Antwerp,&nbsp;were taken poſſeſſion of by General Labourdonnaye ;&nbsp;Louvain and Namur were taken by General Valence ;&nbsp;and the whole Auſtrian Netherlands, Luxembourg pnly&nbsp;excepted, fell into the hands of the French : Liege&nbsp;was taken on the 28th of November after a ſuccefsful&nbsp;engagement, in which thc Auſtrians loſt 5 or 600 men&nbsp;and an immenſe train of artillery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">France was now in a ſituation not unuſual in.the hiſtory of thoſe nations that either are free, or are at-tempting to become ſo; ſucceſsful in all quarters abroad, but diſtracted by factions at home. Ί he two parties&nbsp;in the convention were engaged in a ſtruggle, which&nbsp;daily became more implacable. The party called the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Mountain</span><span class="font0"> did not hêfitate about the nature of the means&nbsp;they were to employ to bring about the ruin of their&nbsp;antagoniſts. 1 hey are even ſuſpected of having, through&nbsp;the medium of Fache the war-miniſter, retarded the&nbsp;ſupply of the armies, to render the ruling party odious&nbsp;by want of ſucceſs. They were for fome time, however, unfortunate in this reſpect ; and the daily news· of&nbsp;victories ſupported with the public the credit of the&nbsp;Girondiſts. A new ſubject was therefore fallen upon,&nbsp;which was the queſtion, how the dethroned king was&nbsp;to be diſpoſcd of? The moderate patty wiſhed to ſave&nbsp;him ; and this was a ſufficient reaſon for their antago-nill s to reſolve upon his ruin. A committee was ap-poiuted to give in a report upon his conduct. A variety of accuſations were brought againſt him ; and the&nbsp;convention inſamouſly refolved co act the part of ac-cufers and of judges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It was on the 1 1 th of December when the ill-fated monarch was ordered to the bar of the convention : the&nbsp;act of accuſation was read, and the king was ſummon-ed by the preſident, Barrere, to anſwer to each ſcparate&nbsp;chargç.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Prof. “</span><span class="font0"> Louis, the French nation accnſes you of having committed a multitude of crimes to eſtabliſh&nbsp;your tyranny, in deſtroying her freedom. You, on the&nbsp;20th of June 1789, attempted the ſovereignty of the&nbsp;people, by ſuſpending the aſſemblies of their repreſen-tatives, and expelling them with violence from the places&nbsp;of their ſittings. This is proved in the procefs verbal&nbsp;entered at the Tennis-court of Verſailles by the members&nbsp;of the conſtſtuent aſſembly. On the 23d of June you&nbsp;wanted to dictate laws to the nation ; you ſurrounded&nbsp;their repreſentatives with troops ; you prcſented to&nbsp;them two royal declarations, ſubverſive of all liberty,&nbsp;and ordered them to ſeparate. Your own declarations,&nbsp;and the minutes of the aſſembly, prove theſe attempts,&nbsp;what have you to anſwer ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Louis.</span><span class="font0"> &quot; No laws were then exiſting to prevent me from it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Prof</span><span class="font0"> &quot; You ordered an army to march againſt the citizens of Paris.
