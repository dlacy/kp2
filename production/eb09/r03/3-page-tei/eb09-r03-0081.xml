This “ proconsular imperium ” was granted in the first instance for ten years,@@<hi rend="sup">4 </hi>but was renewed for periods of five, five, and ten years successively, and the fiction of its temporary duration and periodic renewal was maintained under Augustus’s successors by the celebration every ten years of the “ decen-nalia.”@@<hi rend="sup">5</hi> The Supremeimportanceattached to its possession as the mainstay of the imperial power is sufficiently indicated by the fact that the man on whom it is conferred becomes thereby “ princeps,” and the day on which he receives it (“ dies imperii ”) marks the beginning of his reign.@@<hi rend="sup">6</hi></p><p>The proconsular imperium not only carried with it the control of the army and the provinces, but in Rome itself it gave its holder a position of precedence. In virtue of it he took his seat between the consuls, was preceded by Iictors,@@<hi rend="sup">7</hi> and wore the laurel wreath, paludamentum, and sword of the imperator. But as yet Rome could not be governed like a subject provincial city by proconsular authority ; and, for the necessary direction and regulation of the constitutional machinery which he had restored, Augustus contented himself@@<hi rend="sup">8</hi> with the authority which traditionally invested its holder with a popular leadership, that of the tribunes of the plebs. The “tribunicia potestas ” had been granted him for life in 36,@@<hi rend="sup">9</hi> and his tenure of it was confirmed in 23.@@<hi rend="sup">lθ</hi> Thenceforward it ranked as a constituent element of the principate, second in inιportance only to the proconsular authority. With but few exceptions it was conferred for life upon all succeeding emperors, and the years of their reigns are reckoned by the years of their tribunician power. It was conferred, as all special “ potestas ” had been conferred under the republic, by a decree of the senate and vote of the assembly.@@<hi rend="sup">11</hi> It eave its holder all the prerogatives of</p><p>the tribunate, without the restrictions which hampered the tribunes themselves. Augustus and his successors were unimpeded in its exercise by the presence of colleagues ; and both their personal inviolability and their right of interference held good outside the pomœrium. It enabled them, as representing the acknowledged protectors of the plebs, to control in the name of the people the whole administrative machinery, to introduce laws, to convene the senate, to protect the aggrieved, and to interfere with any exercise of authority by other magistrates. In short, it gave to the man who already wielded an authority abroad more absolute than that granted to Pompey by the Gabinian law all and more than all the power possessed by a Gracchus in Rome.</p><p>It was on these two powers that Augustus’s position as princeps rested. In virtue of these he was chief magistrate of the Roman state, and all other offices and privileges conferred upon him are comparatively of secondary importance. The consulship which he held continuously from 31 up to 23 he never accepted again but on two occasions, in 5 B.c. and in 2 B.c.,@@<hi rend="sup">12</hi>though he was twice invested with “ consular authority ” for the purpose of taking the census <hi rend="smallcaps">(8b.c.,</hi>  14 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.).@@<hi rend="sup">13</hi></hi>  That he ever received an extraordinary “ morum legumque regimen,” as stated by Suetonius and Dio,@@<hi rend="sup">14</hi>  is extremely doubtful, and his language in the Ancyran monument implies that for this purpose, as for many others, he found the tribunician authority sufficient.@@<hi rend="sup">15</hi>  In 22<hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>  he was invested with the “ cura annonae,”@@<hi rend="sup">16</hi>  the supervision of the corn supply and the corn largesses at Rome. On the death of Lepidus in 12 B.c. he succeeded him as “ pontifex maximus,” and he was also a member of the augural and other priestly colleges.@@<hi rend="sup">17 </hi>Lastly, at various times, and probably by decree of the senate, he was granted a number of special exemptions and privileges.@@<hi rend="sup">18</hi></p><p>In theory at least, the Roman world was governed according to the “maxims of Augustus”@@<hi rend="sup">19</hi> down to the time of Diocletian. Even in the 3d century there is still, in name at least, a republic, of which the emperor is in strictness only the chief magistrate, deriving his authority from the senate and people, and with prerogatives limited and defined by law. The case is quite different when we turn from the theory to the practice. The division of authority between the republic and its chief magistrate became increasingly unequal. Over the provinces the princeps from the first ruled autocratically ; and this autocracy reacted upon his position in Rome, so that it became every year more difficult for a ruler so absolute abroad to maintain even the fiction of republican government at home. The republican institutions, with the partial exception of the senate, lose all semblance of authority outside Rome, and even in their altered position as the municipal institutions of the chief city of the empire they retain but little actual power. The real government even of Rome passes gradually into the hands of imperial prefects and commissioners, and the old magistracies become merely decorations which the emperor gives away at his pleasure. And at the same time the rule of the princeps assumes an increasingly personal character, and the whole work of government is silently concentrated in his hands and in those of his own subordinate officials. Closely connected with this change is the different aspect presented by the history of the empire in Rome and Italy on</p><p>@@@    Dio, liii. 32.</p><p>@@@    See the so-called “ lex de imperio Vespasiani,”<hi rend="italic">C.
