Though the converſation was not purſued, the hint ſtruck Mr Robinſon’s mind ; and he immediately determined to read the New Teſtament with this particular view, to examine what it ſaid concerning the baptiſm of infants. He accordingly began with the Goſpel of Matthew ; and, in ſucceſſion, peruſed the hiſtorical and epiſtolary books ; in expectation that he ſſiould find in every following part what he had not met with in the preceding parts of the ſacred volume ; namely, paſſages recommending and urging this rite. But obſerving, on the whole, a total ſilence about it, he thought it his duty to relinquiſh the practice, as without foundation in the rule of our faith ; which appeared to him to ſpeak only of the baptiſm of believers.</p><p>This change of his ſentiments was more unfavourable than the former alterations in his religious judgment to bis worldly views ; and having married very early in life from pure affection, he was involved in great difficulties for near 12 years after his ſettlement in Cambridge ; as, in that courſe of time, his family became numerous, and the ſupport of an aged mother, as well as of a wife and ten children, depended upon him. But unexpected ſupplies, from quarters of which he was ignorant, frequently relieved his neceſſities, and confirmed his truſt in Providence : yet the ſituation of his family muſt, it is eaſy to conceive, have much affected his mind. For he appears to have poſſeſſed great tenderneſs and ſenſibility, and to have regarded with peculiar endearment his domeſtic connections.</p><p>It may be reckoned a circumſtance worthy of mention, that the ſphere of Mr Robinſon’s miniſtry was the ſame in which his great-grandfather Mr Shelly, of Jeſus College, and vicar of All-Saints, had, with others, diſſuſed the principles of the Puritans, about the beginning of the laſt century. The reputation of the Diffen-ters in the univerſity and neighbourhood had for almoſt a century been linking into contempt, when Mr Robinſon ſettled with the baptiſt church at Stone-Yard.<hi rend="sup">z</hi> His abilities and aſſiduity, however, raiſed their reputation. The place in which his people aſſembled, which was at firſt a barn, afterwards a ſtable and granary, and then a meeting-houſe, but ſtill a damp, dark, and ruinous place, ſoon became too ſmall for the audience ; and ſeveral of the new auditors being men of fortune, they purchaſed the fite, and erected at their own expence a new houſe in the year 1764.</p><p>His labours as a preacher were not limited to the town of Cambridge ; but ſoon after bis coming there, he ſet up ſeveral lectures in the adjacent villages. His lectures were either annual or occaſional, or ſtated on fixed days. The uſual time was half an hour after fix in the evening ; and ſometimes at five in the morning ; and now and then in the ſummer at two in the afternoon, for the ſake of thoſe who came from a diſtance.</p><p>He died on the 9th of June 1790, at the houſe of William Ruſſel,Eſq;of Showell green near Birmingham. He had laboured under an alarming diſorder for ſome time before; but on the Sunday preceding his death he preached a charity ſermon. On Monday he was ſeized with a fit ; on Tueſday he recovered and went to bed tolerably well, and was found dead next morning.</p><p>The abilities of Mr Robinſon were very conſiderable, as appears from his numerous works ; and he poſſeſſed</p><lb/><p>the quality of expreſſing his thoughts in an eaſy and a forcible manner. But he appears to have been of an unſteady temper, and, in our opinion, acquires but little credit either from the frequency with which he changed his religious creed (for we have reaſon to believe he died a Socinian), or from the fooliſh and undeſerved acrimony with which he treated the Church of England. His Plan of Lectures on the Principles of Nonconformity, for the Inſtruction of Catechumens, is a piece of the moſt unjuſt and illiberal abuſe that we have ever ſeen, and would have diſgraced the moſt high flying Puritan of the laſt century.</p><p>Mr Robinſon’s largeſt work, the Hiſtory of Baptiſm and of the Baptiſts, was publiſhed ſince his death, and is written in the ſame ſtyle and with the ſame confidence as his other works. Yet, as we have heard it remarked by a learned and liberal profeſſor of Theology in the church which he oppoſed, it is not a little remarkable that there is in it no argument or fact againſt infant baptiſm which was not anſwered by Dr Wall nearly 100 years ago, of whoſe arguments Mr Robinſon however takes no notice.</p><p>ROBORANTS, in pharmacy, medicines which ſtrengthen the parts, and give new vigour to the conſtitution.</p><p>ROCHEFORT, a handſome and conſiderable town of France in the territory of Aunis. It was conſtructed by Louis XIV. and is built in the midſt of marſhes expreſsly drained for that purpoſe ; and time evinced the utility of the project, for as a port it ſoon became as neceſſary and important to the crown of France as Breſt or Toulon. It has a department of the marine, and has large magazines of naval ſtores. There is alſo one of the ſineſt halls of arms in the kingdom, and a great many workmen employed in making them ; there are alſo forges for anchors, and work-houſes for ſhip-carpenters, who are employed in every thing that relates to the fitting out of ſhips that come within the compaſs of their province. They likewiſe call great guns here ; and have artiſts, whoſe employment is ſculpture and painting. There are alſo ſtocks for building men of war, rope-walks, magazines of proviſions and powder, a manufactory of fail-cloth, an hoſpital for ſailors, and proper places to clean the ſhips. Add to theſe, the houſes of the intendant, the ſquare of the capuchins, and the ſuperb ſtructure which contains lodgings for 300 marine guards, where they are taught the buſineſs and exerciſes belonging to ſeamen and officers who go on board the men of war.</p><p>Beſide the uſual number of workmen which were employed at Rochefort during the monarchy, which amounted to about 900, there were about 600 galley ſlaves, occupied in the moſt painful and laborious branches of ſervice. The town is ſituated on the river Charente, about five leagues from its mouth, and was fortified by Louis XIV. at the time he conſtructed it ; but its ſituation is at ſo conſiderable a diſtance from the ſea, as to render it ſufficiently ſecure from any attack, and they have therefore cloſed up the battlements, and neglected the fortifications. The town is laid out with great beauty and elegance. The ſtreets are all very broad and ſtraight, extending through the v hole place from ſide to ſide ; but the buildings do not correſpond with them in this reſpect, as they are moſtly low and irregular.
