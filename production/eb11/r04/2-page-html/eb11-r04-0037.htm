                possess of this edict are somewhat inconsistent and even contradictory; the
                explanation may be that it went through a process&nbsp;of amendment and expansion at
                the hands of successive praetors,&nbsp;and that eventually it may have had more than
                one section, without&nbsp;our always being able to say to which of them the
                criticism of a&nbsp;particular commentator is directed. But there is no doubt of
                its&nbsp;general tendency—of the defects it was meant to correct and of the&nbsp;way
                in which the correction was accomplished.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">One of the defects was this: if a man had taken a transfer of a

                class="font1"> from its rightful owner, but simply by tradition&nbsp;instead of by

                and the transferrer&nbsp;remained undivested. The result, was that the
                latter&nbsp;was in law entitled to raise a </span><span class="font1"

                the&nbsp;transferee whose money he might have in his pocket,while if&nbsp;a third

                amenable to an interdict, the transferee could have no&nbsp;effectual vindication

                The first difficulty was overcome by the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1"

                class="font1"> also a praetorian remedy, and probably older than the Publician’; to
                the transferrer’s vindication&nbsp;on the strength of his unextinguished quiritary
                right the transferee&nbsp;pleaded sale and delivery as an effectual praetorian
                defence. . But,&nbsp;when a third party was in possession, and the transferee by
                simple&nbsp;delivery had to take the initiative, the position was more complicated.
                Such third party might be in. perfect good faith;&nbsp;ne might even have acquired
                from the original transferrer and&nbsp;fortified his acquisition with a formal
                conveyance. But that was&nbsp;no sufficient reason in equity why he should be
                allowed to defeat the&nbsp;prior right of the original transferee, who, if he had
                possessed for the&nbsp;requisite period of usucapion before the third party came
                upon the&nbsp;scene would have cured the defect of the informal delivery and
                acquired an unassailable quiritary right. So the praetor announced&nbsp;in his edict
                that, if a man came to him and represented that he had&nbsp;bought a </span><span

                its owner, and had had it delivered to&nbsp;him, but had lost possession within the
                period of usucapion, he (the&nbsp;praetor) would allow him a vindication embodying a
                fiction of&nbsp;completed usucapion (fn/ra), with which he might proceed
                either&nbsp;against the transferrer or any third party withholding the
            thing</span></p>

        <p><span class="font1">The publication of such an edict and the formula of the action based
                upon it (which, though of praetorian origin, was in many&nbsp;respects dealt with as
                just a variety of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rei
                vindicaiio}</span><span class="font1"> had almost&nbsp;the same effect as if the
                legislature had directly enacted that in&nbsp;future delivery of a </span><span

                pursuance of a sale or other good&nbsp;cause would confer a right of ownership in it
                even before usucapion&nbsp;.had been completed. Till completed, however, the
                transferee&nbsp;was not quiritary owner: the thing in question was only </span><span

                cases&nbsp;as an unnecessary formality; and the marvel is that it continued
                to&nbsp;hold its ground at all. The explanation may be that it afforded
                a&nbsp;substratum for and gave force of law to the </span><span class="font1"
