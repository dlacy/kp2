Rocamadour, a famous place of pilgrimage, is most strikingly situated. Its buildings rise in stages up the side of a cliff on the right bank of the Alzou, which here runs between rocky walls 400 ft. in height. Flights of steps ascend from the lower town to the churches—a group of massive buildings half-way up the cliff. The chief of them is the church of Notre-Dame (1479) j containing the wooden figure of the Madonna reputed to have been carved by St Amadouf. The church opens on to a terrace called the Plateau of St Michel, where there is a broken sword said to be a fragment of “ Durandal,” once wielded by the hero Roland. The interior walls of the church of St Sauveur are covered with paintings and inscriptions recalling the pilgrimages of celebrated persons. The subterranean church of St Amadour (1166) extends beneath St Sauveur and contains relics of the saint. On the summit of the cEff stands the chateau built in the middle ages to defend the sanctuaries.</p><p>Rocamadour owes its origin to St Amadour or Amateur, who, according to tradition, chose the place as a hermitage for his devotions to the Virgin Mary. The saint is identified with Zacchaeus the publican and disciple of Jesus, who is said to have journeyed to Gaul to preach the gospel. The renown of Rocamadour as a place of pilgrimage dates from the early middle ages.</p><p>ROCAMBOLE, <hi rend="italic">Allium Scorodoprasum,</hi>  a hardy bulbous perennial occurring in a wild state in sandy pastures and waste places throughout Europe, but not common in the south; in Britain it is rare, and found in the north of England and the south of Scotland. Its cultivation does not appear to be of ancient date; it is not mentioned by Greek and Roman authors, and there are only a small number of original common names among ancient pcoples (A. de Candolle, <hi rend="italic">Origin of Cultivated Plants,</hi>  p. 72). The plant is grown for its bulbs, which are smaller and milder than those of garlic, and consist of several cloves chiefly produced at the roots. The cloves arc planted about the end of February or in March, and treated like garlic or. shallot. When mature, the bulbs are taken up, dried and stored for use.</p><p>ROCH, ST (Lat. Rochus; Ital. Rocco; Span. Roque; Fr. Roch) (d. 1327), a confessor whose death is commemorated on the 16th of August; he is specially invoked against the plague. According to his <hi rend="italic">Acta,</hi>  he was born at Montpellier, France, about 1295. He early began to manifest strict asceticism and great] devoutness, and on the death of his parents in his twentieth year he gave all his substance to the poor. Coming to Italy during an epidemic of plague, he was very diligent in tending the sick in the public hospitals at Aquapendente, Cesena and Rome, and effected many miraculous cures by prayer and simple contact. After similar ministries at Tiacenza he himself fell ill. He was expelled from the town, and withdrew into the forest, where he would have perished had not a dog belonging to a nobleman named Gothardus supplied him with bread. On his return to Montpellier he was arrested as a spy and thrown into prison, where he died on the 16th of August 1327, having previously obtained from God this favour —that all plague-stricken persons invoking him should be healed. His cult spread through Spain, France, Germany, Belgium and Italy. A magnificent temple was raised to him at Venice, where his body is believed to lie, and numerous brotherhoods have been instituted in his honour. He is usually represented in the garb of a pilgrim, with a wound in his thigh, and with a dog near him carrying a loaf in its mouth.</p><p>See <hi rend="italic">Acta sanctorum,</hi>  August, EL 380-415; Charles Cahier <hi rend="italic">Les Caractéristiques des saints</hi>  (Paris, 1867); pp. 216-217. <hi rend="sub">t</hi>  (H.<hi rend="smallcaps">De )</hi></p><p><hi rend="bold">ROCHAMBEAU, JEAN BAPTISTE DONATIEN DE VIMEUR, </hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Comte de</hi>  (1725-1807), French soldier, was born at Vendôme (Loir-et-Cher) on the ist of July 1725. He was originally destined for the church and was brought up at the Jesuit college at Blois, but after the death of his elder brother he entered a cavalry regiment, served in Bohemia and Bavaria and on the Rhine, and in 1747 had attained the rank of colonel He took part in the siege of Maestricht in 1748, became governor of Vendôme in 1749, and after distinguishing himself in 1756 in the Minorca expedition was promoted brigadier of infantry. In 1757 and 1758 he fought in Germany, notably at Crefeld, received several wounds in the battle of Clostercamp (1760), was appointed <hi rend="italic">maréchal de camp</hi>  in 1761 and inspector of cavalry and was frequently consulted by the ministers on technical points. In 1780 he was sent, with the rank of lieutenant-general, in command of 6000 French troops to help the American colonists under Washington against the English. He landed at Newport, Rhode Island, on the 10th of July, but was held here inactive for a year, owing to his reluctance to abandon the French fleet, which was blockaded by the British in Narragansett Bay. At last, in July 1781, Rocham-beau’s force was able to leave Rhode Island and, marching across ConnecticutJoined Washington on the Hudson. Then followed the celebrated march of the combined forces to Yorktown, where on the 22nd of September they formed a junction with the troops of Lafayette; as the result Cornwallis was forced to surrender on the 19th of October. Throughout, Rochambeau had displayed an admirable spirit, placing himself entirely under Washington’s command and handling his troops as part of the American army. In recognition of his services, Congress voted him and his troops the thanks of the nation and presented him with two cannon taken from the English. These guns, which Rochambeau took back to Vendôme, were requisitioned in 1792. On his return to France he was loaded with favours by Louis XVI. and was made governor of Picardy. During the Revolution he commanded the Army of the North in 1790, but resigned in 1792. He was arrested during the Terror, and narrowly escaped the guillotine. He was subsequently pensioned by Bonaparte, and died at Thore (Loir-et-Cher) on the 10th of May 1807.</p><p>A statue of Rochambeau by Ferdinand Hamar, the gift of France to the United States, was unveiled in Lafayette Square, Washington, by President Roosevelt on the 24th of May 1902. The ceremony was made the occasion of a great demonstration of friendship between the two nations. France was represented by her ambassador, M. Cambon, Admiral Fournier and General Brugère, a detachment of sailors and marines from the warship “ Gaulois ” being present. Representatives of the Lafayette and Rochambeau families also attended. Of the many speeches perhaps the most striking was that of Senator Henry C. Lodge, who, curiously enough in the circumstances, prefaced his eloquent appreciation of the services rendered to the American cause by France by a brilliant sketch of the way in which the French had been driven out of North America by England and her colonists combined. General Brugère, in his speech, quoted Rochambeau’s words, uttered in 1781: “ <hi rend="italic">Entre vous.</hi></p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
