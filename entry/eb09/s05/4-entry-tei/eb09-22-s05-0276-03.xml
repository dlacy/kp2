It contains several squares, in one of which stand the court-house and prisons and in another the spacious palace of the dukes of Go-mara. The churches of Santo Domingo and San Nicolas, the cloisters of the convent of San Juan, and several other ecclesiastical buildings are fine specimens of Romanesque work of the 12th and 13th centuries. The population is chiefly agricultural ; but there are also flour-mills, tanneries, potteries, &amp;amp;c. ; and some trade in timber, wool, and fruit is carried on. Three and a half miles distant is the site of the ancient Numantia. But few traces of the old city, however, remain. A railway has long been projected between Soria and Calatayud, upon the Madrid and Saragossa line. The population in 1877 was 6286.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
