The white perianth is six-parted, the outer three segments being larger and more convex than the inner series. The six anthers open by pores or short slits. The ovary is three-celled, ripening into a three-celled capsule. The snowdrop is a doubtful native of Great Britain, but is largely cultivated for market in Lincolnshire. There are numerous varieties, differing in the size of the flower and the period of flowering. The double form is probably the least attractive. Other distinct species of snowdrop, not to be confounded with the varieties before mentioned, are the Crimean snowdrop, <hi rend="italic">G. plicatus,</hi> with broad leaves folded like a fan, and <hi rend="italic">G. Elwesii,</hi> a native of the Levant, with large flowers, the three inner segments of which have a much larger and more conspicuous green blotch than the commoner kinds. All the species are very graceful, and as universal favourites amply repay cultivation.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
