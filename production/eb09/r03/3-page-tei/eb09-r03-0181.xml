The magnificent image of Time and Death under the yew tree is worthy of any romantic poet that ever lived, yet it cannot be said that he escaped save at moments from the comfortable 18th-century didactics, or that he was a spiritual writer in the sense that Coleridge, Blake, and Shelley were spiritual writers.</p><p>Of the true romantic feeling, the ever present apprehension of the spiritual world and of that struggle of the soul with earthly conditions which we have before spoken of, Rossetti’s poetry is as full as his pictures—so full indeed that it was misunderstood by certain critics, who found in the most spiritualistic of poets and painters the founder of a “ fleshly school.” Although it cannot be said that “ The Blessed Damozel ” or “ Sister Helen ” or “ Rose Mary” reaches to the height of the masterpieces of Coleridge, the purely romantic temper was with Rossetti a more permanent and even a more natural temper than with any other 19th-century poet, even Includingtheauthorof “Christabel” himself. As to the other 19th-century poets, though the Ettrick Shepherd in <hi rend="italic">The Queen’s Wake</hi>  shows plenty of the true feeling, Hogg’s verbosity is too great to allow of really successful work in the field of romantic ballad, where concentrated energy is one of the first requisites. And even Dobell’s “ Keith of Ravelston ” has hardly been fused in the fine atmosphere of fairy land. Byron’s “ footlight bogies ” and Shelley’s metaphysical abstractions had of course but very little to do with the inner core of romance, and we have only to consider Keats, to whose “ La Belle Dame sans Merci” and “ Eve of St Mark ” Rossetti always acknowledged himself to be deeply indebted. In the famous close of the seventh stanza of the “ Ode to a Nightingale ”—</p><p>Charmed magic casements opening on the foam Of perilous seas in faery lands forlorn—</p><p>there is of course the true thrill of the poetry of wonder, and it is expressed with a music, a startling magic, above the highest reaches of Rossetti’s poetry. But, without the evidence of Keats’s two late poems, “ La Belle Dame sans Merci ” and the “ Eve of St Mark,” who could have said that Keats showed more than a passing apprehension of that which is the basis of the romantic temper —the supernatural? In contrasting Keats with Rossetti it must always be remembered that Keats’s power over the poetry of wonder came to him at one flash, and that it was not (as we have said elsewhere) “ till late in his brief life that his bark was running full sail for the enchanted isle where the old ballad writers once sang and where now sate the wizard Coleridge alone.” Though outside Coleridge’s work there had been nothing in the poetry of wonder comparable with Keats’s “La Belle Dame sans Merci,” he had previously in “ Lamia ” entirely failed in rendering the romantic idea of beauty as a maleficent power. The reader, owing to the atmosphere surrounding the dramatic action being entirely classic, does not believe for a moment in the serpent woman. The classic accessories suggested by Burton’s brief narrative hampered Keats where to Rossetti (as we see in “ Pandora,” “ Cassandra,” and “ Troy Town ”) they would simply have given birth to romantic ideas. It is perhaps with Coleridge alone that Rossetti can be compared as a worker in the Renascence of Wonder. Although his apparent lack of rhythmic spontaneity places him below the great master as a singer (for in these miracles of Coleridge’s genius poetry ceases to appear as a fine art at all —it is the inspired song of the changeling child “ singing, dancing to itself ”), in permanence of the romantic feeling, in vitality of belief in the power of the unseen, Rossetti stands alone. Even the finest portions of his historical ballad “ The King’s Tragedy ” are those which deal with the supernatural.</p><p>In the spring of 1860 Rossetti married Elizabeth Eleanor Siddall, who being very beautiful was constantly painted and drawn by him. She had one still-born child in 1861, and died in February 1862. Mrs Rossetti’s own water-colour designs show an extraordinary genius for invention and a rare instinct for colour. He felt her death so acutely that in the first paroxysm of his grief he insisted upon his poems (then in manuscript) being buried with her. These were at a later period recovered, however, and from this time to his death he continued to write poems and produce pictures,—in the latter relying more and more upon his manipulative skill but exercising less and less,—for the reasons above mentioned,—his exhaustless faculty of invention.</p><p>About 1868 the curse of the artistic and poetic temperament, insomnia, attacked him. One of the most distressing effects of this malady is a nervous shrinking from personal contact with any save a few intimate and constantly seen friends. This peculiar kind of nervousness may be aggravated by the use of narcotics, and in his case was aggravated to a very painful degree ; at one time he saw scarcely any one save his own family and immediate family connexions and the present writer. During the time that his second volume of original poetry, <hi rend="italic">Ballads and Sonnets,</hi>  was passingthrough the press (in 1881) his health began to give way, and he left London for Cumberland. A stay of a few weeks in the Vale of St John, however, did nothing to improve his health, and he returned much shattered. He then went to Birchington-on-Sea, but received no benefit from the change, and, gradually sinking from a complication of disorders, he died on Sunday the 9th April 1882.</p><p>In all matters of taste Rossetti’s influence has been immense. The purely decorative arts he may be said to have rejuvenated directly or indirectly. And it is doubtful whether any other Victorian poet has left so deep an impression upon the poetic methods of his time.</p><p>One of the most wonderful of Rossetti’s endowments, however, was neither of a literary nor an artistic kind : it was that of a rare and most winning personality which attracted towards itself, as if by an unconscious magnetism, the love of all his friends, the love, indeed, of all who knew him.</p><p>See T.

On his departure from the school, Mattei, who was not pleased with his progress, told him that he knew enough counterpoint to enable him to write in the free style, but that he was quite unfit for the composition of church music. “ Do I know enough to write operas?” asked Rossini. “ Quite enough,” was the reply. “ Then,” said the boy, “Icare to know no more.” But in truth his wonderful instinct had taught him a great deal more than either he or Mattei suspected.
