<p><span class="font0">very asymmetrical, one of them being much larger than the other, which is often quite aborted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The simplest form of lungs is that of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sphenodon*,</span><span class="font0"> the pre<sup>j </sup>bronchial part is still small. Each lung is still a sac with one&nbsp;large lumen, the walls being honeycombed. In the lizards&nbsp;the walls are more spongy, and several septa begin to extend&nbsp;more or less far from the walls into the lumen, towards each&nbsp;bronchus. Some of these septa begin to cut the lung into&nbsp;lobes, especially in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Varanus</span><span class="font0"> and in chameleons. In the latter&nbsp;exists a further SpeciaHzation, a side-departure, in the shape&nbsp;of several long, hollow processes which are sent out from the&nbsp;posterior portions of the lungs and extend far into the body-cavity and between the viscera. By means of them these&nbsp;creatures can “ blow ” themselves out. They are of morphological interest since they are first stages of air-sacs so&nbsp;marvellously developed in birds, and possibly also in various&nbsp;Dinosaurs. In the Amphisbaenids the left lung alone remains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The lungs of crocodiles have reached a considerably higher stage. They alone in reptiles are, on the ventral side, completely shut off from the viscera by a pleural, partly mus-cularized, membrane. From each bronchus extend a number&nbsp;of broad septa towards the periphery, dividing the originally&nbsp;single lumen into many chambers, perhaps a dozen, from the&nbsp;walls of which wide secondary or parabronchial canals extend&nbsp;into the alveolar meshwork, in very regular arrangement, in&nbsp;series like organ-pipes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The lungs of the tortoises are, in adaptation to the peculiar shape of the body, stowed away along the back, as far as the&nbsp;pelvis, and only their ventral surface is covered by a strong&nbsp;peritoneal membrane which receives muscular, diaphragmatic&nbsp;fibres. The inner division of the lungs into chambers has progressed so much that a sort of mesobronchus has become discernible; the arrangement of the side-bronchi is far less regular&nbsp;than in crocodiles; the whole lung is much more honeycombed,&nbsp;meshy and spongy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The mechanism of breathing of tortoises is not such a puzzle as it is sometimes stated to be. Of course the rigid box of the&nbsp;trunk excludes any costal, or abdominal breathing, but by protruding the limbs or the neck, piston-like, an effective vacuum&nbsp;is produced in the box. Moreover, the throat is distended and&nbsp;WOrked considerably by the unusually large and very movable&nbsp;hyoid apparatus, by which air is pumped into the lungs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The lungs of the snakes are very thin-walled, with a very wide lumen, and only for about the first half from the heart&nbsp;backwards the walls are alveolar enough for actual respiratory&nbsp;function, while towards the blind end the sacs are so thin and&nbsp;sparsely vascularized that they act mainly as reservoirs of a large&nbsp;amount of air. Frequently their posterior portions receive&nbsp;blood vessels not from the pulmonary arteries but directly from&nbsp;those of the trunk. In correlation with tKe long, cylindrical&nbsp;body, the lungs are much elongated and they are not equally&nbsp;developed. The asymmetry shows great differences in the&nbsp;various groups, consequently the asymmetry has been developed&nbsp;independently in those groups. It is usually stated that the&nbsp;left lung is much smaller than the right. This is but rarely&nbsp;the case. The most recent observations are those of E. D.&nbsp;Cope </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Proc. Am. Phil. Soc.</span><span class="font0"> (1894), xxxiii. 217). In Boidae&nbsp;both lungs are large, although unequal: the left or more&nbsp;dorsally placed one being the larger. In </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ilysia</span><span class="font0"> the right is&nbsp;functional, the left is ventral and vestigial. In </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rhinophis</span><span class="font0"> the&nbsp;right is very small, the left larger. In </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Glauconia</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Typhlops&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">the right Iung alone is developed: the left is-quite aborted. In&nbsp;CoIubridae thc left lung alone is functional, while the right is&nbsp;vestigial. Thereisno trace of the right in Elapinae and Hydro-phinae and most Viperidae. In the Colubridae the right, or&nbsp;ventral, lung is, when present at all, reduced to a length of&nbsp;from 2-5 mm., and it then communicates with the anterior&nbsp;portion of the left lung by a foramen, in level of the heart,&nbsp;whilst the right bronchus is aborted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A further complication is the so-called tracheal lung, which is present in Typhlopidae, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ungalia</span><span class="font0"> of the Boidae, in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chersydrus</span><span class="font0"> of&nbsp;the Acrochordinae, in the Hydrophinae and Viperidae. This&nbsp;peculiar organ is a continuation of the anterior portion of the&nbsp;functional lung, extending far headwards, along the trachea,&nbsp;with the lumen of which it communicates by numerous openings.&nbsp;In </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chersydrus</span><span class="font0"> this mysterious organ is “ composed of coarse&nbsp;cells and without lumen, extends from the heart to the head,&nbsp;and is discontinuous with the true lung; the trachea communicates with it by a series of symmetrical pores on each side.”&nbsp;In </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Typhlops</span><span class="font0"> it extends likewise from the heart to the throat, as&nbsp;a cellular body but without Iumen or connexion with either&nbsp;trachea or lung.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Thyroid and Thymus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Thyroid</span><span class="font0"> of the reptiles is a single, unpaired organ, placed ventrally upon the trachea and one or other of the arterial&nbsp;trunks, more or less distant from the heart. In snakes it lies&nbsp;on the mid-line near the heart; a little farther up in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sphenodon*,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">still farther in lizards, and chameleons near the root of their&nbsp;gular sac. In tortoises it is globular, at the division of the&nbsp;carotic trunk. In crocodiles it is bilobed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Thymus</span><span class="font0"> is paired. It is largest in crocodiles, extending on either side of nearly the whole neck, along the carotids and&nbsp;jugulars. In the tortoises they are much shorter; in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sphenodon&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and lizards are two pairs, more or less eIongated; in the snakes&nbsp;are sometimes as many as three pairs, elongated but small,&nbsp;attached to the carotis near the heart. As usual the thymus&nbsp;bodies become much reduced with age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Spleen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Spleen</span><span class="font0"> varies much in shape and position. In lizards it is mostly roundish, elongated in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sphenodon,</span><span class="font0"> and placed&nbsp;near the stomach; in crocodiles it lies in the duodenal loop&nbsp;behind the pancreas; similarly situated in snakes, but in&nbsp;the tortoises it is much concentrated, large and attached to&nbsp;the hind-gut.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Body Cavity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">body cavity</span><span class="font0"> of the reptiles is subdivided into several sacs or cavities by serous membranes of peritoneal origin. The&nbsp;number of these subcavities differs much in the various groups.&nbsp;The pericardial sac is always complete. In tortoises the lungs&nbsp;are retro-peritoneal, a dense serous membrane spreading over&nbsp;their ventral surface from the walls of the carapace forwards&nbsp;to the Uver and shutting off a saccus hepato-pulmonalis from&nbsp;the rest of the peritoneal cavity. Snakes possess, besides the&nbsp;modifications mentioned above, separate chambers for the&nbsp;stomach, right and left liver, and for the gut, whilst the pleural&nbsp;cavities as such have been destroyed. In lizards a “ post-hepatic&nbsp;septum ” divides liver, lungs and heart from the rest of the&nbsp;intestines. This transverse vertical septum is best developed,&nbsp;almost complete, in some of the Tejidae, in others it seems to be&nbsp;more imperfect, and it is probably a further development of the&nbsp;SuspensoriaI ligament of the liver, which is ultimately inserted&nbsp;upon the ventral wall of the body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The subdivisions have reached their highest development in the crocodiles, there being, besides the pericardial and the two&nbsp;pleural cavities and the usual peritoneal room, a right and left&nbsp;hepato-pericardiac, an hepato-gastric, and an hepato-pulmonal&nbsp;sac. The caudal and ventral edges of these liver-sacs are fused&nbsp;on to the ventral body-wall, thus producing a complete transverse partition, headwards of which lie the lungs, liver and&nbsp;heart. This partition, morphologically not homologous with&nbsp;the mammalian diaphragm, more resembling the imperfect&nbsp;structure in birds, acts, however, as a perfect diaphragm, since&nbsp;it is well furnished with muscular fibres. These are attached&nbsp;to its whole periphery, with centripetal direction, especially&nbsp;on the ventral half. These fibres are transgressors upon this&nbsp;septum from a broad sheet of muscles, which, inserted together&nbsp;with the septum upon the body-wall, arise from the iliac bones,&nbsp;thc pubes, and the greater portion of the last pair of abdominal&nbsp;ribs. This broad muscular sheet, covering the intestines, is&nbsp;the so-called abdominal diaphragm or peritoneal muscle. Its&nbsp;continuation upon the transverse septum is the crocodilian&nbsp;musc, diaphragmaticus, and in functional effect very simiIar</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
