<p><label>RICHARDSON</label>
(Samuel), a celebrated Engliſh ſentimental novel-writer, born in 1688, was bred to the buſineſs of a printer, which he exerciſed all his life with eminence. Though he is ſaid to have uijderſtood no language but his own, yet he acquired great reputation by his three epiſtolary novels, intitled <hi rend="italic">Pamela, Clariſſa,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Sir Charles Grandiſon ;</hi> which ſhow an uncommon knowledge of human nature. His purpoſe being to promote virtue, his pictures of moral excellence are by much too highly coloured ; and he has de-ſcribed his favourite characters ſuch rather as we might wiſh them to be, than as they are to be found in reality. It is alſo objected by ſome, that his writings have not always the good effect intended : for that, in-ftead of improving natural characters, they have fa-ſhioned many artificial ones ; and have taught delicate and refined ladies and gentlemen to deſpiſe every one but their own ſelf-exalted perſons. But after all that can be urged of the ill effects of Mr Richardſon’s novels on weak minds, eager to adopt characters they can only burleſque ; a ſeniible reader will improve more by ſtudying ſuch models of perfection, than of thoſe nearer to the natural ſtandard of human frailty, and where thoſe frailties are artfully exaggerated ſo as to fix and miſemploy the attention on them. A ſtroke of the palfy carried off Mr Richardſon, after a few days ill-neſs, upon the 4th of July 1761. He was a man of fine parts, and a lover of virtue ; which, for aught we have ever heard to the contrary, he ſhowed in his life and conversation as well as in his writings. Beſides the works above-mentioned, he is the author of an Æ-ſop’s Fables, a Tour through Britain, 4 vols, and a volume of Familiar Letters upon buſineſs and other ſubjects. He is ſaid from his childhood to have delighted in letter-writing ; and therefore was the more eaſily led to throw his romances into that form; which, if it enlivens the hiſtory in ſome reſpects, yet lengthens it with unintereſting prate, and formalities that mean nothing, and on that account is ſometimes found a little tedious and fatiguing.</p><p>The moſt eminent writers of our own country,, and even of foreign parts, have paid their tribute to the tranſcendant talents of Mr Richardſon, whoſe works have been publiſhed in almoſt every language and country of Europe. They have been greatly admired, not-withſtanding every diſſimilitude of manners, or every diſadvantage of tranſlation. M. Diderot, a late celebrated French author, ſpeaking of the means employed to move the paſſions, in his Eſſay on Dramatic Poetry, mentions Richardſon as a perfect maſter of that art :</p><p>“ How ſtriking (ſays he), how pathetic, are his deſcrip-tions ! His perſonages, though filent, are alive before me ; and of thoſe who ſpeak, the actions are ſtill more affecting than the words.”—The famous John-James Rouſſeau, ſpeaking, in his letter to M. d’Alembert, of the novels of Richardſon, aſſerts, “ that nothing was ever written equal to, or even approaching them, in any language.”—Mr Aaron Hill calls his Pamela a “ delightful nurſery of virtue.”—Dr Warton ſpeaks thus of Clementina : “ Of all repreſentations of madneſs, that of Clementina, in the Hiſtory of Sir Charles Grandiſon,</p><p>is the moſt deeply intereſting. I know not whether even the madneſs of Lear is wrought up, and expreſſed, by ſo many little ſtrokes of nature and paſſion. It is abſolute pedantry to prefer and compare the madneſs of Oreſtes in Euripides to this of Clementina.”—Dr Johnſon, in his Introduction to the 97th number of the Rambler, which was written by Mr Richardſon, ob-ſerves, that the reader was indebted for that day’s en-tertainment to an author, “ from whom the age has received greater favours, who has enlarged the knowledge of human nature, and taught the paſſions to move at the command of virtue and, in his Life of Rowe, he ſays, “ The character of Lothario ſeems to have been expanded by Richardfon into that of Lovelace ; but he has excelled his original in the moral effect of the fiction. Lothario, with gaiety which cannot be hated, and bravery which cannot be deſpifed, retains too much of the ſpectator’s kindneſs. It was in the power of Richardſon alone to teach us at once eſteem and deteſtation ; to make virtuous reſentment overpower all the benevolence which wit, and elegance, and courage, naturally excite ; and to loſe at laſt the hero in the villain.”—Dr Young very pertinently obſerved, that Mr Richardſon, with the mere advantages of nature, improved by a very moderate progreſs in education, ſtruck out at once, and of his own accord, into a new province of writing, in which he ſucceeded to admiration. And what is more remarkable, that he not only began, but finiſhed, the plan on which he ſet out, leaving no room for any one after him to render it more complete : and that not one of the various writers that</p><p>have ever ſince attempted to imitate him, have in any reſpect equalled, or at all approached near him. This kind of romance is peculiarly his own; and “ I conſider him (continues the Doctor) as a truly great natural genius; as great and ſupereminent in his way as Shakeſpeare and Milton were in theirs.”</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">RichaRdson (Jonathan), a celebrated painter of heads, was born about the year 166y, and againſt his inclination was placed by his father-in-law apprentice to a ſcrivener, with whom he lived fix years ; when obtaining his freedom by the death of his maſter, he followed the bent of his diſpoſition, and at 20 years old became the diſciple of Riley ; with whom he lived four years, whoſe niece he married, and of whoſe manner he acquired enough to maintain a ſolid and laſting reputation, even during the lives of Kneller and Dahl ; and to remain at the head of the profeſſion when they went off the ltage.</hi></p><p>There is ſtrength, roundneſs, and boldneſs in his colouring ; but his men want dignity, and his women grace. The good ſenſe of the nation is characteriſed in his portraits. You ſee he lived in an age when neither enthuſiaſm nor ſervility were predominant. Yet with a pencil ſo firm, poſſeſſed of a numerous and excellent collection of drawings, full of the theory, and profound in reflections on his art, he drew nothing we’ll below the head, and was void of imagination. His attitudes, draperies, and back-grounds, are totally inſipid and unmeaning ; ſo ill did he apply to his own practice the ſagacious rules and hints he beſtowed on others. Though he wrote with fire and judgment, his paintings owed little to either. No man dived deeper into the inexhauſtible ſtores of Raphael, or was more ſmitten with the native luſtre of Vandyck. Yet though caps-</p>

<p>ble of taſting the elevation of the one and the elegance of the other, he could never contrive to fee with their eyes, when he was to copy nature himſeſſ. One wonders that he could comment their works ſo well, and imitate them ſo little.</p><p>He quitted buſineſs himſelf ſome years before his death ; but his temperance and virtue contributed to protract his life to a great length in the full enjoyment of his underſtanding, and in the felicity of domeſtic friendſhip. He had had a paralytic ſtroke that affected his arm, yet never diſabled him from his cuſtomary walks and exerciſe. He had been in St James’s Park, and died ſuddenly at his houſe in Queen’s-ſquare on his return home, May 28. 1745, when he had paſſed the 80th year of his age. He left a ſon and four daughters, one of whom was married to his diſciple Mr Hud-ſon, and another to Mr Grigſon an attorney. The tafle and learning of the ſon, and the harmony in which he lived with his father, are viſible in the joint works they compoſed. The father in 1719 publiſhed two diſcourſes : 1. An Eſſay on the whole Art of Criticiſm as it relates to Painting ; 2. An Argument in behalf of the Science of a Connoiſſeur ; bound in one volume octavo. In 1722 came forth An Account of ſome of the ſtatues, bas-reliefs, drawings, and pictures, in Italy, &amp;c. with Remarks by Mr Richardfon, ſenior and junior. The ſon made the journey; and from his notes, letters, and obſervations, they both at his return compiled this valuable work. As the father was a formal man, with a flow, but loud and ſonorous voice, and, in truth, with ſome affectation in his manner ; and as there is much Angularity in his ſtyle and expreſſion, theſe peculiarities (for they were ſcarcely foibles) ſtruck ſuper-ſicial readers, and between the laughers and the envious the book was much ridiculed. Yet both this and the former are full of matter, good ſenſe, and inſtruction : and the very quaintneſs of ſome expreſſions, and their laboured novelty, ſhow the difficulty the author had to convey mere viſible ideas through the medium of language. Thoſe works remind one of Cibber’s inimitable treatiſe on the ſtage : when an author writes on his own profeſſion, feels it profoundly, and is ſenſible</p><p>his readers do not, he is not only excuſable, but meritorious, for illuminating the ſubject by new metaphors or bolder figures than ordinary. He is the coxcomb that ſneers, not he that inſtructs, in appropriated diction.</p><p>If theſe authors were cenſured when converſant within their own circle, it was not to be expected that they would be treated with milder indulgence when they ventured into a ſiſter region. In 1734, they publiſhed a very thick octavo, containing explanatory notes and remarks on Milton’s Paradiſe Loft, with the life of the author, and a diſcourſe on the poem. Again were the good ſenſe, the judicious criticiſms, and the ſentiments that broke forth in this work, forgotten in the Angularities that diſtinguiſh it. The father having laid in apology for being little converſant in claſſic literature, that he had looked into them through his ſon, Hogarth, whom a quibble could furniſh with wit, drew the father peeping through the nether end of a teleſcope, with which his ſon was perforated at a Virgil aloft on a ſhelf. Yet how forcibly Richardſon entered into the ſpirit of his author, appears from his com-prεhenflve expreſſion, that <hi rend="italic">Milton was an ancient, born</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">two thouſand years after his time.</hi> Richardſcn, however, was as incapable of reaching the ſublime or harmonious in poetry, as he was in painting, though ſo capable of illuſtrating both. Some ſpecimens of verſe that he has given us here and there in his works, excite no curioſi-ty for more, though he informs us in his Milton, that if painting was his wife, poetry had been his ſecret concubine. It is remarkable, that another commentator of Milton has made the ſame confeſſion,</p><p><hi rend="italic">-Sunt ⅛ <hi rend="sup">5</hi> mihi carmina, me quoque dicunt</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">V</hi> <hi rend="italic">atem paſtorei—--</hi></p><p>ſays Dr Bentley. Neither the doctor nor the painter add <hi rend="italic">fed non ego credulus illis,</hi> though all their readers are ready to ſupply it for both. Beſides his pictures and commentaries, we have a few etchings by his hand, particularly two or three of Milton, and his own head. The ſale of his collection of drawings, in February 1747, laſted 18 days, and produced about 20601. his pictures about 7001. Hudſon his ſon-in-law bought many of the drawings.</p>
