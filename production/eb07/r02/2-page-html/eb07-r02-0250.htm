<p><span class="font2">If </span><span class="font1">the body is a heavy straight line suspended by one extremity, the OS = ⅜ of its length ; for making </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font1"> = the&nbsp;length of the rod, we have (18) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">fridm — ½ a<sup>3</sup>,</span><span class="font1"> and in this&nbsp;case the mass M = </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a,</span><span class="font1"> and the centre of gravity is at the&nbsp;middle of the line, or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">h</span><span class="font1"> = ½β, whence MA = ½α<sup>2</sup>, and OS&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">= ffldm</span><span class="font1"> -÷- MA = ¼α<sup>3</sup> +∙ ½a<sup>2</sup> = ¾Λ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This is nearly the case ot a slender rod of a cylindrical or prismatic shape, and it would be accurately so if all the&nbsp;points of a transverse section were equally distant from the&nbsp;axis of suspension.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">48. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem to find the centre of oscillation of a&nbsp;sphere suspended by a thread or an inflexible rod, is important on account of its application to the measurement&nbsp;of the seconds pendulum. Let us first suppose that the&nbsp;weight of the thread is insensible in comparison of that of&nbsp;the ball. Let </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span class="font1"> = radius of ball, Z = length of thread from&nbsp;the point of suspension to the ball, and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a = l + r</span><span class="font1"> = distance from the point of suspension to the centre of the ball.&nbsp;The moment of inertia of the sphere in respect of an axis&nbsp;passing through its centre (18) is </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">2Mri</span><span class="font1"> ; therefore (17) the&nbsp;moment in respect of a parallel axis at the distance </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font1"> is&nbsp;M (α<sup>,</sup> + ¼r<sup>i</sup>) ; and on dividing this by MA ( = Mα), we&nbsp;get the distance from the point of suspension to the centre</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">2r<sup>2</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">of oscillation = </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a + ∙—</span><span class="font1">, or the centre of oscillation is be-5α</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">low the centre of gravity by the distance ¾r<sup>2</sup>-+β.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">49. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us now suppose the weight of the thread or rod&nbsp;to be taken into account. Let C (fig. 10) be the centre of&nbsp;the ball, G the centre of gravity of the ball and</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">rod OA, S the centre of oscillation ; also let </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">b</span><span class="font1"> = weight of ball, and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">f∕' =</span><span class="font1"> weight of rod. The&nbsp;moment of the sphere, oscillating about O, supposing the weight of the rod insensible, is found&nbsp;above = M (β<sup>2</sup> + </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">iri)</span><span class="font1"> ; and (18) the moment&nbsp;of the rod alone is ½OA<sup>3</sup> = ½Z<sup>3</sup> = ½M'Z<sup>2</sup> (putting&nbsp;M' = mass of the rod) ; therefore, substituting&nbsp;the weightsfor the masses, that is, making M = A,&nbsp;and M'= A<sup>,</sup>, the moment of the compound body&nbsp;is A </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(α°</span><span class="font1"> + ⅞r<sup>i</sup>) +½A'Z<sup>a</sup>. Now, to find the&nbsp;position of </span><span class="font2">G </span><span class="font1">the centre of gravity, we have this theorem&nbsp;in statics, that the product of the whole mass multiplied&nbsp;into the distance of its centre of gravity from the axis, is&nbsp;equal to the sum of the products of the masses of the several parts into the respective distances of their centres of&nbsp;gravity ; that is, putting OG = A, we have (M + M')A&nbsp;= Aα + ½A'Z, and consequently (45),</span></p>
<p><span class="font1"><sub>os</sub> _*(«* + ?»&quot;)+ ⅜^<sup>s </sup>Aα + ½A7</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">50. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hitherto we have supposed the axes of rotation to&nbsp;be absolutely fixed ; but the rotation may be performed&nbsp;about axes which are themselves in motion, as in the case&nbsp;of a ball or cylinder rolling down an inclined plane. When&nbsp;a ball rolls down an inclined plane, the point of the ball&nbsp;which rests on the plane is hindered from sliding down by&nbsp;friction ; and therefore the ball tumbles, as it were, over&nbsp;this point of contact, and is instantly caught by another&nbsp;point of contact, over which it tumbles in the same manner. A cylinder rolls down in the very same way ; and its&nbsp;motion is nearly the same as if a fine thread had been lapped round it, and one end of it made fast at the head of the</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1">inclined plane. The cylinder rolls down by unwinding this thread.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The mechanism of all such motions (and some of them are important) may be understood by considering them as&nbsp;follows : Let a body of any shape be connected with a cylinder HO K (fig. 11), whose axis passes through G, the&nbsp;centre of gravity of the body. Suppose the body suspended from a fixed point A by a thread wound round the&nbsp;cylinder. The body will descend by the action of gravity,&nbsp;and it will also turn round, unwinding the thread. Draw&nbsp;the horizontal line SGO ; this will pass through the point&nbsp;of contact O of the thread and cylinder, and O is the point&nbsp;round which the cylinder </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">begins</span><span class="font1"> to turn in descending. Let&nbsp;S be its centre of oscillation correspond</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ing to the momentary centre of rotation O.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The body will begin to descend in the same</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">manner as if all its matter were collected in</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">S ; for it may be considered, in this instant,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">as a pendulum suspended at O. But in this</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">case S will descend in the same manner</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">as if the body were falling freely. There</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">fore the velocity of G (that is, the velocity</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">of descent) will be to the velocity with</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">which a heavy body would fall as OG to</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">OS. Now since the points O, G, S, are always in a horizontal line, and the radius OG is given, as also OS (43), the velocity of a body falling freely, and of the body unwinding from this thread, will always be in the same proportion of OS to OG, and so will the spaces described in&nbsp;any given time. And thus we can compare their motions&nbsp;in every case when we know the place of the centre of oscillation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It follows from this that the weight of the descending body will be to the tension of the thread as OS to GS; for&nbsp;the tension of the thread is the difference between the moment of the rolling body and that of the body falling freely.&nbsp;It is to be remarked, that this proportion between the weight&nbsp;of the body and the tension of the thread will be always the&nbsp;same ; for it has been demonstrated (46), that if O be in&nbsp;the circumference of a circle whose centre is G, S will be&nbsp;in the circumference of another circle round the same centre, and therefore the ratio of OG to OS is constant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If a circular body HOK roll down an inclined plane by unfolding a thread, or by friction which prevents all sliding, the space described will be to that which the body&nbsp;would describe freely as OG to OS ; for the tendency&nbsp;down the inclined plane is a determined proportion of the&nbsp;weight of the body. The motion of rotation in these cases,&nbsp;both progressive and whirling, is uniformly accelerated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">51. In order to give an example of the application of the preceding formulæ for the rotation of bodies about fixed&nbsp;axes to the theory of machines actually performing work,&nbsp;we shall suppose the machine to be the wheel and axle,&nbsp;and that a weight W, attached to a chain passing over the&nbsp;cylinder, is to be raised by means of a power acting on&nbsp;another chain which passes over the wheel. Let the radius of the wheel = </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a,</span><span class="font1"> the radius of the cylinder = A, and&nbsp;suppose the moving power to be another weight P, or a mass&nbsp;of matter descending by the accelerating force of gravity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Since the machine is in this case impelled by an accelerating force, the angular velocity </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">w</span><span class="font1"> is obtained from thc equation (41), namely,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">dw</span><span class="font1"> _ moment of impelling force </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">dt</span><span class="font1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;moment of incrtia</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Now, because the weight P acts in a straight line whose distance from the axis = a, the moment of its force is Pa ;&nbsp;and in like manner the moment of the force exerted by W&nbsp;is WA. But this last moment retards the motion, and must&nbsp;be taken as negative ; therefore the moment of the impelling force is Pα — WA. Again, the moment of inertia is&nbsp;made up of three parts : first, the moment of inertia of the</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
