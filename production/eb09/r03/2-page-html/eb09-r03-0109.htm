<p><span class="font2">of Hapsburg, the new candidate for the imperial crown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In 1278, the ten years’ term having expired, he deprived</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Charles of the senatorship and appointed Rudolph vicar of Tuscany. After declaring that he left to the people&nbsp;the right of electing the senator, he promulgated a new&nbsp;constitution (18th July 1278) which, while confirming the&nbsp;rights of the church over the city, prohibited the election&nbsp;of any foreign emperor, prince, marquis, count, or baron&nbsp;as senator of Rome. Thus the Colonna, Savelli, Orsini,&nbsp;Annibaldi, and other Roman nobles again rose to power,&nbsp;and the republic was again endangered and plunged in&nbsp;disorder. The Romans then gave the reconstitution of&nbsp;the city into the pope’s hands by yielding to him the&nbsp;right of nominating senators, declaring, however, that this&nbsp;was a personal concession to himself, and not to the popes&nbsp;in general. So Nicholas proceeded to name senators,&nbsp;alternating a Colonna with au Orsini, or simultaneously&nbsp;choosing one of each faction. The same power over&nbsp;the senate was granted with the same restriction to AIartin</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">IV. (1281-85), and he at once re-elected Charlesof Anjou.&nbsp;Thus, greatly to the disgust of the Romans, the Capitol was&nbsp;again invaded by French vicars, notaries, judges, and&nbsp;soldiery. But the terrible blow dealt at Charles’s power&nbsp;by the Sicilian A<sup>r</sup>espers (31st AIarch 1282) resounded even&nbsp;in Rome. The Orsini, backed by the people, rose to arms,&nbsp;massacred the French garrison, and quickly re-established&nbsp;a popular Government. Giovanni Cencio, a kinsman of&nbsp;the Orsini, was elected captain and defender of the people,&nbsp;and ruled the city with the co-operation of the senator&nbsp;and a council of priors of the guilds. This Government&nbsp;was of brief duration, for, although the pope had professed&nbsp;his willingness to tolerate the experiment, he quickly&nbsp;arranged fresh terms, and, forsaking Charles of Anjou,&nbsp;again nominated two Roman senators. Pope and king&nbsp;both died in 1285, and Nicholas IV. (1288-92), also&nbsp;holding sway over the senate, favoured the Colonna in&nbsp;order to curb the growing mastery of the Orsini. But&nbsp;thus there were two powerful houses instead of one. In&nbsp;fact Giovanni Colonna, when elected senator, ruled from&nbsp;the Capitol as an independent sovereign, conducted in&nbsp;person the campaign against Viterbo, and subjected that&nbsp;city to the republic on the 3d AIay 1291.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">AVhen one of the Gaetani, Boniface VIIL (1294-1303), was raised to the papal chair, the extent of the Colonnas’&nbsp;power became evident to all. Boniface opposed them in&nbsp;order to aggrandize his own kin, and they showed equal&nbsp;virulence in return. The Cardinals Colonna refused to&nbsp;acknowledge him as the legitimate pope, and he excommunicated them and proclaimed a crusade against their&nbsp;house. Even after he had subdued them and destroyed&nbsp;Palestrina, their principal fief, the drama did not yet come&nbsp;to an end. Boniface had a very lofty conception of the&nbsp;church, and desired to establish her supremacy over the&nbsp;state. The king of France (Philip the Fair) believed, on&nbsp;the contrary, that the Angevin successes entitled him to&nbsp;fill the place in Italy vacated by the Swabians, and to play&nbsp;the master there. This led to a tremendous contest in&nbsp;which all the French sided with their king. And shortly&nbsp;afterwards a plot was hatched against the pope by the&nbsp;agents of France and the Colonna. These determined&nbsp;enemies of the pope met with much favour in Rome, on&nbsp;account of the general irritation against the Gaetani and&nbsp;the enormous power conferred on them by Boniface.&nbsp;Suffice it to say that they were now lords of the whole of&nbsp;lower Latium, from Capo Circeo to Ninfa, from Ceprano to&nbsp;Subiaco. Thus Sciarra Colonna and a Frenchman named&nbsp;Nogaret were able to fall on the pope at Anagni, insult him,&nbsp;and take him prisoner. The people rising to his rescue,&nbsp;the conspirators were put to flight. But when Boniface&nbsp;returned to Rome with the escort and protection of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Orsini, who had made themselves masters of the city, he found that he was virtually a captive in their hands. PIe&nbsp;felt this so keenly that he died of rage and exhaustion&nbsp;onthe Ilth October 1303. The brief pontificate of his&nbsp;successor Benedict XI. was followed by that of Clement</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">V. (1305-14), a Frenchman, who, instead of coming to&nbsp;Rome, summoned the cardinals to France. This was the&nbsp;beginning of the church’s so-called exile in Avignon, which,&nbsp;although depriving Rome of a source of wealth and&nbsp;influence, left the republic to pursue its own course. It '&nbsp;employed this freedom in trying to hold its own against 1&nbsp;the nobles, whose power was much lessened by the absence ’&nbsp;of the pope, and endeavoured to gain fresh strength by ,&nbsp;organizing the thirteen regions, which, as we have shown, .&nbsp;were associations of a much firmer nature in Rome thau the <sup>1&nbsp;</sup>guilds. Accordingly, in 1305, a captain of the people was&nbsp;elected with thirteen elders and a senator, Paganino della&nbsp;Torre, who governed for one year. The pope was opposed&nbsp;to these changes at first, but in 1310 he issued a brief&nbsp;granting Rome full permission to select its own form of&nbsp;government. Thus, the first pope in Avignon restored the&nbsp;rights of the Romans. But the latter, even with church&nbsp;and empire so far removed, still considered Rome the&nbsp;Eternal City, the source of all law, and the only natural&nbsp;seat of the spiritual and temporal government of the&nbsp;world. To their republic, they thought, appertained a new&nbsp;and lofty destiny, nor could it ever be content to descend&nbsp;to the level of other Italian municipalities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">On the 6th January 1309 Henry VII. was crowned king 1 of the Romans at Aix-la-Chapelle ; and so greatly were&nbsp;men’s minds changed in Italy that, throughout the land,&nbsp;he was hailed as a deliverer. He w<sup>r</sup>ished to restore the&nbsp;grandeur of the empire, and the Italians, above all Dante&nbsp;Alighieri, beheld in him the champion of the state against&nbsp;the church, who, after becoming the foe of communal&nbsp;liberty, had forsaken Italy and withdrawn to France.&nbsp;The Roman people shared these ideas, and awaited Henry&nbsp;with equal impatience, but the nobles rose in opposition.&nbsp;The Orsini, leaders of the Guelfs, and allied with Robert&nbsp;of Naples, took possession of Castle St Angelo and the&nbsp;Trastevere. Hence, when Henry reached Rome in Alay&nbsp;1312, after seizing the iron crown at AIilan, he was obliged&nbsp;to act on the offensive. He took the Capitol by assault,&nbsp;but, failing in his attack on Castle St Angelo, was pursued by its Neapolitan garrison. Forsaken by many&nbsp;discouraged adherents, he was forced to recognize the&nbsp;expediency of departure. First, however, he desired to be&nbsp;crowned at the Lateran, St Peter’s being held by his foes.&nbsp;The cardinals refused his request, but were compelled to&nbsp;yield by the threats of the people, who, reasserting their&nbsp;ancient rights, insisted that the coronation should take&nbsp;place without delay. And the ceremony was performed&nbsp;on the 29th June 1312. The emperor then resolved to&nbsp;depart in spite of the popular protest against his leaving&nbsp;the natural seat of the empire, and on the 20th August&nbsp;started for Tuscany, where worse fortune awaited him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Their differences settled, the nobles expelled the cap- </span><span class="font0">J </span><span class="font2">tain of the people left by Henry, and elected as senators *&nbsp;Sciarra Colonna and Francesco Orsini. But this was the θ&nbsp;signal for a popular revolt. The Capitol was attacked, the <sub>p&nbsp;</sub>senators put to flight, and Jacopo Arlotti elected captain&nbsp;with a council of twenty-six worthies </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">lbuoni homini</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">∖</span><span class="font2"> The&nbsp;new leader instantly summoned the chief nobles before his&nbsp;tribunal, had them chained and cast into prison, and&nbsp;demolished many of their houses and strongholds. But,&nbsp;having thus humiliated their pride, Arlotti dared not put&nbsp;them to death, and, releasing them from confinement,&nbsp;banished them to their estates, where they plunged into&nbsp;hostile preparations. Aleanwhile the victorious people&nbsp;convoked a parliament and decreed that, the aristocracy</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
