<p><span class="font1">said to crack and break easily when sharply bent, and on account of their hairy character have not the same smart appearance&nbsp;as those made from flax. Although the fibre is in some cases</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in. long, it varies considerably in length. This is one of the&nbsp;drawbacks in the preparing and spinning. It is impossible to&nbsp;make perfect yams from fibres of various lengths; hence it is&nbsp;necessary either to separate the fibres into reasonable groups,&nbsp;or to cut them into satisfactory lengths. The latter method&nbsp;appears, on the whole, to be the better, and it is the method&nbsp;adopted by Messrs Greenwood &amp; Batley Limited, Leeds,&nbsp;who make special machinery for the dressing, preparing and&nbsp;spinning of ramie and China-grass. If no special machinery be&nbsp;employed, the length of the fibre will decide the class of machinery&nbsp;to be used. The fibre has been prepared and spun on flax, wool&nbsp;and silk-waste machinery, but it must be understood that none&nbsp;of these systems are really suitable for the process. A fibre&nbsp;with special characteristics requires special machinery for its&nbsp;manufacture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When so many different opinions obtain as to which existing machinery is best adapted for the preparing and spinning of ramie,&nbsp;it is not surprising to find that different methods are employed in&nbsp;the process of manufacture. In general, however, we may say that,&nbsp;after decortication, the first process is that of degumming. This is&nbsp;usually done by immersing the fibre in a caustic soda solution, which&nbsp;is then heated in a closed vessel. The fibre is laid on galvanized&nbsp;trays, of which as many as forty-four can be fitted in a cage, which is&nbsp;then placed inside the boiling keir, the lid of which is screwed down&nbsp;and the necessary pressure of steam admitted. After having been&nbsp;boiled a sufficient time to remove the gum, the material is lifted out,&nbsp;the alkali neutralized, and the fibre thoroughly washed to remove&nbsp;all traces of chemicals. The bulk of the water is removed by a&nbsp;hvdro-extractor. and the fibre is then hung up or laid on perforated&nbsp;plates to dry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To facilitate the subsequent processes, the </span><span class="font1">fibre </span><span class="font0">is softened by passing it through a machine fitted with fluted rollers. Then follow&nbsp;the operations of dressing, roving, wet spinning and doubling, and&nbsp;finally the twisted thread is passed rapidly through a gas flame in&nbsp;order to remove all superfluous hairs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In spite of the many disappointments which have been experienced in connexion with the treatment of this fibre, we are of the opinion&nbsp;that it will ultimately hold a good place amongst commercial fibres.&nbsp;It is at present spun in several European countries, but its use is&nbsp;still very limited. This is due, not to any imperfection of the fibre,&nbsp;but to its price and to the limited supply of raw material. It is at&nbsp;present chiefly used for gas mantles, for which it is particularly well&nbsp;adapted. It has also been used for paper-making, ropes, lines, nets,&nbsp;underwear, and for canvas and several other fabrics. If only a good&nbsp;supply of clean fibre could be obtained, there is not the least doubt&nbsp;that manufacturers and machine-makers would quickly provide&nbsp;means for dealing with it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(T. </span><span class="font1">Wo.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RÅMILLIES, a village of Belgium, in the province of Brabant,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;miles N. by E. of Namur, between the sources of the Little&nbsp;Gheete and of the Mehaigne. It is famous for the victory of the&nbsp;Allies under the duke of Marlborough over the French commanded by Marshal Villeroy on the 12th∕23rd of May 1706.&nbsp;The position of the French on the high ground about Ramillies&nbsp;was marked by the villages of Autréglise (Anderkirch) on the&nbsp;left, Offuz on the left centre, Ramillies on the right centre and&nbsp;Taviers on the right close to the river Mehaigne. In front of the&nbsp;last was a smaller village, Franquenay, which was held as an&nbsp;advanced post. Between these </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">points d’appui</span><span class="font1"> the ground was&nbsp;mostly open upland, and the position as a whole was defective&nbsp;in so far that the villages were barely within cannon-shot of each&nbsp;other. It was particularly strong on the flanks, which were&nbsp;protected by the marshy beds of the Mehaigne and the Little&nbsp;Gheete. Ramillies stands almost on the watershed of these&nbsp;adjacent valleys, and here Marlborough decided to deh*ver his&nbsp;main attack. The forces were about equal, and were at first&nbsp;equally distributed along the whole line of either party. Marlborough’s local concentration of force at the spot where the&nbsp;attack was to be pressed home was made not before, but after&nbsp;the action had opened (cf. Neerwinden). Villeroy's left wing&nbsp;of cavalry and infantry was secure—and at the same time immobilized—behind the upper course of the Little Gheete, and&nbsp;the French commander allowed himself to be imposed upon by&nbsp;a demonstration in this quarter, convinced perhaps by the&nbsp;presence of the British contingent that a serious attack was&nbsp;intended. The morning was spent in arraying the fines of&nbsp;battle, and it was about 1.30 when the cannonade opened.&nbsp;Soon the first lines of infantry of the Allied centre and left&nbsp;(Dutch) opened the attacks on Franquenay and Taviers and on&nbsp;Ramillies, and, when after a severe struggle Taviers fell into the&nbsp;hands of the Dutch, their commander, Marshal Overkirk, led&nbsp;forward the whole of the left wing cavalry and fiercely engaged&nbsp;the French cavalry opposed to it. The ground was open, both&nbsp;parties had placed the greater part of their horse on this side,&nbsp;and it was only after a severe and prolonged engagement (in&nbsp;which Marlborough himself took part like a trooper and was&nbsp;unhorsed) that the Allies were definitely victorious, thanks to&nbsp;the arrival of a force of cavalry brought over from the Allied&nbsp;right wing. Meanwhile the principal attack on Ramillies had&nbsp;been successfully pressed home, the necessary concentration&nbsp;of force being secured by secretly and skilfully withdrawing some&nbsp;British battalions from the right wing. While Villeroy was&nbsp;trying to bring up supports from the left to take part in the&nbsp;cavalry battle, the French in Ramillies were driven out into the&nbsp;open, where the Allied cavalry, having now gained the upper&nbsp;hand, rode down many battalions. Most of the French cavalry&nbsp;from the other wing, having to force its way through the baggage&nbsp;trains of the army (these had been placed too near the fighting&nbsp;lines), arrived too late, and once Ramillies had fallen the whole&nbsp;line of the Allies gradually took up the offensive. It was not&nbsp;long before the French line was rolled up from right to left, and&nbsp;the retreat of the French was only effected in considerable&nbsp;confusion. Then followed for once a relentless pursuit, carried&nbsp;on by the British cavalry (which had scarcely been engaged)&nbsp;to Louvain, 20 m. from the field of battle. Marlborough’s&nbsp;unequalled tactical skill and judgment thus sufficed not merely&nbsp;to win the battle, but to win it with so large a margin of force&nbsp;unexpended that the fruits of his victory could be gathered.&nbsp;The French army lost, in killed, wounded and missing, some&nbsp;15,000 men, the Allies (amongst whom the Dutch had borne&nbsp;the brunt of the fighting) scarcely one-third as many.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RAMLER, KARL WILHELM (1725-1798), German poet, was born at Kolberg on the 25th of February 1725. After completing his studies in Halle, he went to Berlin, where, in 1748,&nbsp;he was appointed professor of logic and literature at the cadet&nbsp;school. In 1786 he became associated with the author, Johann&nbsp;Jakob Engel, in the management of the royal theatre, of which,&nbsp;after resigning his professorship, he became (1790-96) sole&nbsp;director. He died at Berlin on the nth of April 1798. Ramler&nbsp;was a skilful but cold and uninspired versifier; and the reputation he enjoys as poet and critic is mainly due to his skill in&nbsp;imitating and reproducing in German, classical (mostly Horatian)&nbsp;metrical forms; and he had a reputation, not unfounded, of&nbsp;correcting his friends’ writings out of recognition. His </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tod&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Jesu,</span><span class="font1"> a cantata, is well known owing to its musical setting by&nbsp;Karl Heinrich Graun.</span></p>

In 1874 he was appointed professor of&nbsp;inorganic chemistry, and director of the second chemical labora-tory at Berlin. Distinguished for his researches on mineralogy,&nbsp;crystallography and analytical chemistry, he laboured also&nbsp;at metallurgy, and yet found time for a series of important&nbsp;textbooks, in which his learning and sound judgment were&nbsp;combined with a lucid and accurate statement of facts. He&nbsp;was author of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Handwörterbuch des chemischen Teils der Mineralogie</span><span class="font1"> (2 vols., 1841; supp. 1843-53); </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lehrbuch der chemischen</span></p>
