a ſimple brought from the Eaſt Indies, of conſiderable uſe in diet as a reſtorative. Tt is produced from a ſpecies of palm tree <hi rend="italic">(CYCAS circnalis,</hi> L.) growing ſpontaneouſly in the Eaſt Indies without any culture. The progreſs of its vegetation in the early ſtages is very flow. At firſt it is a mere ſhrub, thick ſet with thorns, which makes it difficult to come near it; but as ſoon as its ſtem iſ once formed, it riſes in a ſhort time to the height of 30 feet, is about ſix feet in circumference, and imperceptibly loſes its thorns. Its ligneous bark is about an inch in thickneſs, and covers a multitude of long fibres; which, being interwoven one with another, envelope a maſs of a gummy kind of meal. As ſoon as this tree is ripe, a whitiſh duſt, which tranſpires through the pores of the leaves, and adheres to their extremities, proclaims its maturity. The Malais then cut them down near the root, divide them into ſeveral ſections, which they ſplit into quarters: they then ſcoop out the maſs of mealy ſubſtance, which is enveloped by and adheres to the fibres; they dilute it in pure water, and then paſs it through a ſtraining bag of fine cloth, in order to ſeparate it from the fibres. When this paſte has loſt part of its moiſture by evaporation, the Malais throw it into a kind of earthen veſſels, of different ſhapes, where they allow it to dry and hard</p><p>en. This paſte is wholeſome nouriſhing food, and preſerves for many years. The Indians eat it diluted with water, and ſometimes baked or boiled. Through a principle of humanity, they referve the fineſt part of this meal for the aged and infirm. A jelly is ſometimes made of-it, which is white and of a delicious flavour.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
