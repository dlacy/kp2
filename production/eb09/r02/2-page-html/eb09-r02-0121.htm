<p><span class="font1">From that time the Malatesta became citizens of Venice ; their names were inscribed in the Golden Book,&nbsp;and they were admitted to the grand council. With the&nbsp;death, in 1716, of Christina Malatesta, the wife of Niccolo&nbsp;Boldu, the Rimini branch of the family became extinct.&nbsp;The descendants of Giovanni, brother of Malatesta da&nbsp;Verrucchio, who married one of the Sogliano, were known&nbsp;as the Sogliano-Malatesta. The representatives of this&nbsp;branch settled in Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The history of Rimini practically ends with its independence. It fell into obscurity under the rule of the popes, and was not again mentioned in history until, in&nbsp;1831 and 1845, it took a prominent part in the revolutionary movements against papal despotism and in favour&nbsp;of Italian independence. Although Rimini, like many&nbsp;other cities of Romagna, is now harassed by republican and&nbsp;socialistic sects, it is a thriving town and enjoys increasing&nbsp;prosperity. It had in 1881 a population of 37,248 souls,&nbsp;being the centre of a district containing 88,110 inhabitants, and is part of the province of Forli, which, divided&nbsp;into the three districts of Cesena, Forli, and Rimini, has a&nbsp;total population of 252,883 souls. Many small manufactures are carried on at Rimini, but agriculture is its&nbsp;principal resource, and its produce in corn and wine is&nbsp;considerably in excess of the local consumption. Its seabathing establishment attracts many visitors during the&nbsp;summer months, and conduces to the prosperity of the&nbsp;town. Rimini also boasts a good public library of 28,000&nbsp;volumes, inclusive of 850 MSS.; and it has a record&nbsp;office containing several thousand ancient MSS.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RING (Gr. δακτύλιος, Lat. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">αηnulus).</span><span class="font0">@@<sup>1</sup></span><span class="font1"> At an early period, when the art of writing was known to but very few,&nbsp;it was commonly the custom for men to wear rings on&nbsp;which some distinguishing sign or badge was engraved&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{eτriσηpov∖</span><span class="font1"> so that by using it as a seal the owner could&nbsp;give a proof of authenticity to letters or other documents.&nbsp;Thus, when some royal personage wished to delegate his&nbsp;power to one of his officials, it was not unusual for him&nbsp;to hand over his signet ring, by means of which the full&nbsp;royal authority could be given to the written commands of&nbsp;the subordinate. The enlarged part of a ring on which the&nbsp;device is engraved is called the “ bezel,” the rest of it being&nbsp;the “ hoop.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The earliest existing rings are naturally those found in the tombs of ancient Egypt. The finest examples date&nbsp;from about the 18th to the 20th dynasty ; they are of pure&nbsp;gold, simple in design, very heavy and massive, and have&nbsp;usually the name and titles of the owner deeply sunk in&nbsp;hieroglyphic characters on an oblong gold bezel. Rings&nbsp;worn in Egypt by the poorer classes were made of less&nbsp;costly materials, such as silver, bronze, glass, or pottery&nbsp;covered with a siliceous glaze and coloured brilliant blue&nbsp;or green with various copper oxides. Some of these had&nbsp;hieroglyphic inscriptions impressed while the clay was&nbsp;moist. Other examples have been found made of ivory,&nbsp;amber, and hard stones, such as carnelian. Another form&nbsp;of ring used under the later dynasties of Egypt had a&nbsp;scarab in place of the bezel, and was mounted on a gold&nbsp;hoop which passed through the hole in the scarab and&nbsp;allowed it to revolve.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In ancient Babylonia and Assyria finger ring3 do not appear to have been used. In those countries the signet&nbsp;took a different form, namely, that of a cylinder cut in&nbsp;crystal or other hard stone, and perforated from end to end.&nbsp;A cord was passed through it, and it was worn on the&nbsp;wrist like a bracelet. This way of wearing the signet is&nbsp;more than once alluded to in the Old Testament (Gen.&nbsp;xxxviii. 18, Revised Version, and Cant, viii. 6).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Etruscans used very largely the gold swivel ring mounted with a scarab, a form of signet probably introduced from Egypt. Some found in Etruscan tombs have&nbsp;real Egyptian scarabs with legible hieroglyphs ; others,&nbsp;probably the work of Phoenician or native engravers, have&nbsp;rude copies of hieroglyphs, either quite or partially illegible.&nbsp;A third and more numerous class of Etruscan signet rings&nbsp;have scarabs, cut usually in sard or carnelian, which are a&nbsp;link between the art of Egypt and that of Greece, the&nbsp;design cut on the flat side being Hellenic in style, while the&nbsp;back is shaped like the ordinary Egyptian scarabæus beetle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Among the Greeks signet rings were very largely worn, and were usually set with engraved gems. In Sparta a&nbsp;sumptuary law was passed at an early time to forbid any&nbsp;substance more valuable than iron to be used for signet&nbsp;rings ; but in other parts of the Hellenic world there&nbsp;appears to have been no restriction of this sort. In some&nbsp;of the numerous tombs of Etruria and Kertch (Panti-capæum) in the Cimmerian Bosphorus gold rings of great&nbsp;magnificence have been discovered, apparently of the finest&nbsp;Greek workmanship. One from Etruria, now in the&nbsp;British Museum, is formed by two minutely modelled&nbsp;lions whose bodies form the hoop, while their paws hold&nbsp;the bezel, a scarab engraved with a lion of heraldic character. Many other examples of this design have been&nbsp;found, some of which are among the finest existing specimens of Hellenic or Græco-Etruscan jewellery. Another&nbsp;remarkable specimen from an Etruscan tomb is of Etrusco-Latin work. The hoop of the ring is formed by two&nbsp;minute gold figures of Hercules and Juno Sospita, the stone&nbsp;being set between their heads. Many of the Greek rings&nbsp;are of thin repoussé gold, so as to make the most show for&nbsp;the least cost ; one fine example, early in date, has its hoop&nbsp;formed of two dolphins, holding a plain white stone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Romans appear to have imitated the simplicity of Lacedæmonia. Throughout the republic none but iron&nbsp;rings were worn by the bulk of the citizens. Ambassadors&nbsp;were the first who were privileged to wear gold rings, and&nbsp;then only while performing some public duty. Next&nbsp;senators, consuls, équités, and all the chief officers of state&nbsp;received the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pis annuli aurei.</span><span class="font1"> One early Roman ring of&nbsp;the highest historical interest still exists ; it belonged to&nbsp;Cornelius Scipio Barbatus, consul in 298 B.c., in whose&nbsp;sarcophagus, now in the Vatican, it was found in 1780.</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>2&nbsp;</sup>It is of plain rudely hammered gold, and is set with an&nbsp;intaglio on sard of a figure of Victory, purely Roman in&nbsp;style, dating before 300 b.c. In the Augustan age many&nbsp;valuable collections of antique rings were made, and were&nbsp;frequently offered as gifts in the temples of Rome. One&nbsp;of the largest and most valuable of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">dactyliothecæ</span><span class="font1"> was&nbsp;dedicated in the temple of Apollo Palatinus by Augustus’s&nbsp;nephew Marcellus, who had formed the collection (Pliny,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">H.</span><span class="font1"> </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">N</span><span class="font1">., xxxvii. 5). The temple of Concord in the Forum&nbsp;contained another ; among this latter collection was the&nbsp;celebrated ring of Polycrates, king of Samos, the story of&nbsp;which is told by Herodotus (see vol. xix. p. 417); Pliny,&nbsp;however, doubts the authenticity of this relic (77. JV.,&nbsp;xxxvii. 2).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Different laws as to the wearing of rings existed during the empire : Tiberius made a large property qualification&nbsp;necessary for the wearing of gold rings ; Severus conceded&nbsp;the right to all Roman soldiers ; and later still all free&nbsp;citizens possessed theyws </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">annuli aurei,</span><span class="font1"> silver rings being</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
