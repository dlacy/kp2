Their complement of men is 750, in which there are six lieutenants, four master’s mates, twenty-four midshipmen, and four surgeon’s mates, fourteen quarter-masters and their mates, eight boatswain’s mates and yeomen, six gunner’s mates and yeomen, with twenty-two quarter-gunners, two carpenter’s mates with ten assistants, and one steward and steward’s mate.</p><p>Ships of the third rate carry from sixty-four to eighty cannon, which are thirty-two, eighteen, and nine-pounders. The eighty-gun ships, however, begin to grow out of repute, and to give way to those of seventy-four, seventy, &amp;c. which have only two whole batteries ; whereas the former have three, with twenty-eight guns planted on each, the cannon of their upper deck being the same as those on the quarter-deck and forecastle of the latter, which are nine-pounders. The complement in a seventy-four is 650, and in a sixty-four 500 men ; these have in peace four lieutenants, but in war five, and, when an admiral is aboard, six. They have also three master’s mates, sixteen midshipmen, three surgeon’s mates, ten quarter-masters and their mates, six boatswain’s mates and yeomen, four gunner’s mates and yeomen, with eighteen quarter-gunners, one carpenter’s mate with eight assistants, and one steward and steward’s mate under the purser.</p><p>Ships of the fourth rate mount from sixty to fifty guns, upon two decks and the quarter-deck. The lower tier is composed of twenty-four pounders, the upper tier of twelve-pounders, and the cannon on the quarter deck and forecastle are six-pounders. The complement of a fifty-gun ship is 350 men, in which there are three lieutenants, two master’s mates, ten midshipmen, two surgeon’s mates, eight quartermasters and their mates, four boatswain’s mates and yeomen, one gunner’s mate and one yeoman, with twelve quarter-gunners, one carpenter’s mate and six assistants, a steward and steward’s mate.</p><p>All vessels of war under the fourth rate are usually comprehended under the general name of <hi rend="italic">frigates,</hi>  and never appear in the line of battle. They are divided into the fifth and sixth rates ; the former mounting from forty to thirty-two guns, and the latter from twenty-eight to twenty. The largest of the fifth rate have two decks of cannon, the lower battery being of eighteen-pounders, and that of the upper deck of nine-pounders ; but those of thirty-six and thirty-two guns have one complete deck of guns, mounting twelve-pounders, besides the quarter-deck and forecastle, which carry six-pounders. The complement of a ship of forty-four guns is 280 men, and that of a frigate of thirty-six guns 240 men. The first has three and the second two lieutenants ; and both have two master’s mates, six midshipmen, two surgeon’s mates, six quarter-masters and their mates, two boatswain’s mates and one yeoman, one gunner’s mate and one yeoman, with ten or eleven quarter-gunners, and one purser’s steward.</p><p>Frigates of the sixth rate carry nine-pounders, those of twenty guns having three-pounders on their quarter-deck, with 200 men for their complement ; and those of twenty-four 160 men. The former has two lieutenants, the latter one ; and both have two master’s mates, four midshipmen, one surgeon’s mate, four quarter-masters and their mates, one boatswain’s mate and one yeoman, one gunner’s mate and one yeoman, with six or seven quarter-gunners, and one purser’s steward.</p><p>The sloops of war carry from eight to eighteen cannon, the largest of which have six-pounders ; and the smallest, that is, those of eight or ten guns, four-pounders. Their officers are generally the same as in the sixth rates, with little variation; and their complements of men vary from 60</p><p>to 120, in proportion to their force or magnitude. Bomb-vessels are on the same establishment as sloops ; but fireships and hospital-ships are on that of fifth rates.</p><p>RATEEN, or Ratten, in commerce, a thick woollen stuff, quilled, and woven in a loom with four treddles, like serges and other stuffs that have the whale or quilling. There are some rateens dressed and prepared like cloths ; others left simply in the hair, and others where the hair or knap is frized. Rateens are chiefly manufactured in France, Holland, and Italy, and are mostly used in linings. The frize is a sort of coarse rateen, and the drugget is a rateen half linen half woollen.</p><p>RATHENAU, <hi rend="italic">a</hi>  city of Prussia, in the province of Potsdam, and circle of West Havell. It stands on the river Havell, is surrounded with walls, and has a good marketplace, in which there is a statue of the elector Frederick William, placed to commemorate a victory gained by him near this place over the Swedes in the year 1675. It contains 620 houses, and about 4500 inhabitants.</p><p>RATIO, in <hi rend="italic">Arithmetic</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">Geometry,</hi>  is that relation of homogeneous things which determines the quantity of one from the quantity of another, without the intervention of a third.</p><p>The numbers, lines, or quantities, A and B, being proposed, their relation one to another may be considered under one or other of these two heads : 1. How much A exceeds B, or B exceeds A ; which is found by taking A from B, or B from A, and is called <hi rend="italic">arithmetical reason</hi>  or <hi rend="italic">rαtia. </hi>2. How many times, or parts of a time, A contains B, or B contains A ; which is called <hi rend="italic">geometrical reason</hi>  or <hi rend="italic">ratio, </hi>or, as Euclid defines it, the <hi rend="italic">mutual habitude,</hi>  or <hi rend="italic">respect,</hi>  of two magnitudes of the same kind, according to quantity, that is, llow often the one contains or is contained in the other ; and this is found by dividing A by B, or B by A. But observe, that that quantity which is referred to another quantity is called the <hi rend="italic">antecedent e&gt;f the ratio ;</hi>  and that to which the other is referred is called the <hi rend="italic">consequent of the ratio.</hi>  In the ratio of A to B, A is the antecedent, and B the consequent. Therefore any quantity as antecedent, divided by any quantity as a consequent, gives the ratio of that antecedent to the consequent.</p><p>Thus the ratio of A to B is <hi rend="italic">∙q<hi rend="sub">r</hi>,</hi>  but the ratio of B to A is B</p><p>B    12</p><p>— ; and, in numbers, the ratio of 12 to 4 is — = 3, or tri-A    ⅛</p><p>4    1</p><p>ple ; but the ratio of 4 to 12 is — = -, or subtriple.</p><p>1 &lt;~    «5</p><lb/><p>And here observe, that the quantities thus compared must be of the same kind ; that is, such as by multiplication may be made the one to exceed the other, or as these quantities are said to have a ratio between them, which, being multiplied, may be made to exceed one another. Thus a line, how short soever, may be multiplied, that is, produced so as to exceed any given right line ; and consequently these may be compared together, and the ratio expressed. But as a line can never, by any multiplication whatever, be made to have breadth, that is, to be equal to a superficies, however small, so these can never be compared together, and consequently have no ratio or respect to one another, according to quantity ; that is, how often the one contains or is contained in the other.</p><p>RATION, in an army, a portion of ammunition, bread, drink, and forage, distributed to each soldier for his daily subsistence. The horse have rations of hay and oats when they cannot go out to forage.</p><p>RATIONALE, a solution or account of the principles of some opinion, action, hypothesis, or phenomenon.</p><p>RATIOS of musical intervals.
