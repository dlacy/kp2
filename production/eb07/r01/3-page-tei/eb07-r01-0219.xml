Want of space, however, compels us to abandon this intention; and as the same cause prevents us from entering minutely on the Orations of Cicero, we prefer leaving these altogether untouched, to passing them with a few vague generalities. The characteristics of Cicero’s admirable eloquence, and the differences between it and that of Demosthenes, are matters familiar to every one ; and the study of the Latin orator is more common than that of the Greek, nearly in the inverse proportion of the real merits of the two.</p><lb/><p>mens of oratory; and indeed, for those who have purity of Rbetorie.</p><p>taste enough to relish the severer graces of a manly and prac- ''■"“'v—</p><p>tical eloquence, always drawing its materials from a vigorous</p><p>and richly stored understanding, always animated by at least</p><p>a calm and lofty feeling of truth and freedom, and sometimes</p><p>inspired by a genuine and rapid enthusiasm, but never</p><p>stooping to be graceful, nor pausing to gather ornaments</p><p>on its way,—for minds which can appreciate eloquence like</p><p>this, the speeches of Fox will form a treasure of models, in</p><p>which they will not only find successful exemplifications of</p><p>most of the principles of eloquence, but much that will remind</p><p>them of the calmer moods of Demosthenes.

Among these, we</p><p>can do no more than name Grattan, Erskine, and Sheridan ;</p><p>and we pause at the threshold of the present age, naming</p><p>no man who is still alive.</p><p>But of the political orators who have preceded the present The three time both in the last century and this, by far the most re- great ora-markable, in a merely rhetorical point of view, were these<hi rend="sup">tors-</hi>three j Chatham, Burke, and Canning.</p><p>Very many of Chatham’s speeches are unreported ; many The elo-of the earlier ones have reached us with much distortion; quence of and there are but a very few in which we can believe our- ^<hi rend="sup">orci</hi> *-**at-selves to be listening throughout to the exact words of the<hi rend="sup">ham</hi>‘ speaker. But enough remains to convince us that Chatham was the most powerful and striking political orator whom our country has ever produced. His celebrated youthful retort to the elder Horace Walpole bears unequivocal marks of being, in the shape in which we possess it, the manufacture of Samuel Johnson ; and we have scarcely any speech completely and genuinely reported, which was delivered before his fiftieth year. In the orations succeeding that time, our recollection of the speaker’s age and lofty position in the state prepares our minds to harmonize with the tone of address, and to consider that as noble boldness, which in a younger and meaner man might have received another name. The tone is never varied ; it is always uncompromising, stern, and admonitory: the speaker is not an advocate devising means to conciliate and persuade, but a preacher of truth and right, denouncing judgments on political transgression. Chatham’s mind never grew old; to the last hour of his public life the feelings glowed as passionately, and prompted images as vivid, and alternately checked, and impelled, and transformed the language, in figures as abrupt and varied, as in the morning of his youth and dawning ambition ; the sickness and decay of the body were overcome by the resistless energy of the fiery soul; and the British House of Lords trembled before the cripple who stood up feebly in the midst of them, to grow strong as he spoke by the impulse of his own fervent imagination. The idol of Chatham’s mind was the baronial constitution of England as confirmed in Magna Charta, which, indeed, with the Petition and Bill of Rights, he himself called the Englishman’s political bible: all the strong and diversified powers of his intellect, in observation, judgment, and rapidly convincing argument, and all the array of his chivalrously generous feelings, did continual homage at the one sacred shrine: attempts from below to widen the area of the political edifice, that the mass of the people might come in, the aristocratic Whig would have laughed to scorn: insidious endeavours from above and within to shake the pillars of the temple, roused him repeatedly to overwhelming indignation.</p><p>His eloquence found its most favourable field of display in two questions of his time: the famous elections of Wilkes for Middlesex, which were made the occasion of fierce debates as to the constitutional rights of the subject; and the more</p></body></text></TEI>
