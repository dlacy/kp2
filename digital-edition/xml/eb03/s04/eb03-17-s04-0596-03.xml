the name of a ſet of works, or manufactory of a variety of hard-wares, belonging to Mr Boulton, ſituated on the borders of Staffordſhire, within two miles of Birmingham now ſo juſtly celebrated as to deserve a ſhort historical detail.</p><p>About 30 years ago the premiſes conſiſted of a ſmall mill and a few obſcure dwellings. Mr Boulton, in conjunction with Mr Fothergill, then his partner, at an expence of L. 9000, erected a handſome and extenſive edifice, with a view of manufacturing metallic toys. The firſt productions conſiſted of buttons, buckles, watch-chains, trinkets, and ſuch other articles as were peculiar to Birmingham. Novelty, taſte, and variety, were, however, always conſpicuous ; and plated wares, known by the name of Sheffield plate, compriſing a great variety oſ uſeful and ornamental articles, became another permanent ſubject of manufacture.</p><p>To open channels for the consumption of theſe commodities, all the northern part of Europe was explored by the mercantile partner Mr Fothergill. A wide and extenſive correſpondence was thus eſtabliſhed, the undertaking became well known, and the manufacturer, by becoming his own merchant, eventually enjoyed a double profit.</p><p>Impelled by an ardent attachment to the arts, and by the patriotic ambition of forming his favourite Soho into a fruitful ſeminary of artiſts, the proprietor extended his views ; and men of taſte and talents were now fought for, and liberally patroniſed. A ſucceſsful imitation of the French <hi rend="italic">or moulie</hi> ornaments, consiſting of vaſes, tripods, candelabra, &amp; c. &amp; c. extended the celebrity of the works. Services of plate and other works in ſilver, both maſſive and airy, were added, and an aſſay office was eſtabliſhed in Birmingham.</p><p>Mr Watt, the ingenious improver of the ſteam-engine, is now in partnerſhip with Mr Boulton ; and they carry on at Soho a manufactory of steam-engines, not leſs beneficial to the public than lucrative to themſelves. This valuable machine, the nature and excellences of which are deſcribed in another place (ſee <hi rend="italic">STEAM-Engine),</hi> Mr Boulton propoſed to apply to the operation of coining, and ſuitable apparatus was erected at a great expence, in the hope of being employed by government to make a new copper-coinage for the kingdom. Artiſts of merit were engaged, and ſpecimens of exquiſite delicacy were exhibited ; but as no national coinage has taken place, the works are employed upon high</p><p>finished medals and private coins. To enumerate all the productions of this manufactory would be tedious<note anchored="true" n="1" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="smallcaps">(a)</hi> It was at this place, in the year 1772, that Mr Eginton invented his expeditious method of copying pictures in oil.</p></note> <hi rend="smallcaps">(a).</hi></p><p>In a national view, Mr Boulton’s undertakings are highly valuable and important. By collecting around him artiſts of various deſcriptions, rival talents have been called forth, and by ſuccessive competition have been multiplied to an extent highly beneficial to the public. The manual arts partook of the benefit, and became proportionably improved.</p><p>A barren heath has been covered with plenty and population ; and Mr Boulton’s works, which in their infancy were little known and attended to now cover several acres, give employment to more than 600 perſons, and are ſaid to be the firſt of their kind in Europe.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
