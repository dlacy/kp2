in <hi rend="italic">Grammar,</hi> one of the points or stops used to distinguish the several members of a sentence from each other.</p><p>The mark or character of a semicolon is (;), and it has its name from being of somewhat less effect than a colon, or as demanding a shorter pause.</p><p>The proper use of the semicolon is to distinguish the conjunct members of a sentence. Now, by a conjunct member of a sentence is meant such a one as contains at least two simple members. Whenever, then, a sentence can be divided into several members of the same degree, which are again divisible into other simple members, the former are to be separated by a semicolon. For instance, “ If fortune bear a great sway over him, who has nicely stated and concerted every circumstance of an affair ; we must not commit every thing, without reserve, to fortune, lest she should have too great a hold of us.”</p></div></body></text></TEI>
