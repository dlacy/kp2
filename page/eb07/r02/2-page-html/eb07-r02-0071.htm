<p><span class="font0">ing itself ; since the whole ridicule arises out of the want of ' the necessary knowledge of its rules, incident to the ignorance and inexperience of the clowns who undertook to practise an art peculiar to gentlemen. The ancient poetry of&nbsp;Scotland furnishes several examples of this ludicrous style&nbsp;of romantic composition ; as the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Tournament at the Drum,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Justing of Watson and Barbour,</span><span class="font0"> by Sir David&nbsp;Lindsay. It is probable that these mock encounters were&nbsp;sometimes acted in earnest ; at least King James I. is accused of witnessing such practical jests ; “sometimes presenting David Droman and Archie Armstrong, the king’s fool,&nbsp;on the back of other fools, to tilt at one another till they&nbsp;fell together by the ears.”—(Sir Anthony Weldon’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Court of&nbsp;King James.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In hastily noticing the various divisions of the romance, we have in some degree delayed our promised account of&nbsp;its rise and progress ; an inquiry which we mean chiefly to&nbsp;confine to the romance of the middle ages. It is indeed&nbsp;true tllat this species of composition is common to almost all nations, and that even if we deem the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Iliad</span><span class="font0"> and&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Odyssey</span><span class="font0"> compositions too dignified by the strain of poetry in&nbsp;which they are composed to bear the name of metrical romances ; yet we have the pastoral romance of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Daphnis and&nbsp;Chloe,</span><span class="font0"> and the historical romance of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Theagenes and Chαri-clea,</span><span class="font0"> which are sufficiently accurate specimens of that style&nbsp;of composition. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Milesian fables</span><span class="font0"> and the romances of&nbsp;Antonius Diogenes, described by Photius, could they be&nbsp;recovered, would also be found to belong to the same class.&nbsp;It is impossible to avoid noticing that the Sybarites, whose&nbsp;luxurious habits seem to have been intellectual, as well as&nbsp;sensual, were peculiarly addicted to the perusal of the Milesian fables ; from which we may conclude that they were&nbsp;not of that severe kind which inspired high thoughts and&nbsp;martial virtues. But there would be little advantage derived from extending our researches into the ages of classical&nbsp;antiquity respecting a class of compositions which, though&nbsp;they existed then, as in almost every stage of society, were&nbsp;neither so numerous nor of such high repute as to constitute any considerable portion of that literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Want of space also may entitle us to dismiss the consideration of the Oriental romances, unless in so far as in the course of the middle ages they came to furnish materials for&nbsp;enlarging and varying the character of the romances of&nbsp;knight-errantry. That they existed early, and were highly&nbsp;esteemed both among the Persians and Arabians, has never&nbsp;been disputed ; and the most interesting light has been lately thrown on the subject by the publication </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">οi' Antar,</span><span class="font0"> one&nbsp;of the most ancient, as well as most rational, if we may use&nbsp;the phrase, of the Oriental fictions. The Persian romance&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Shα-Nameh</span><span class="font0"> is well known to Europeans by name, and&nbsp;by copious extracts ; and the love-tale of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Mejnοuη and Lei-luh</span><span class="font0"> is also familiar to our ears, if not to our recollections.&nbsp;Many of the fictions in the extraordinary collection of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Arabian Tales</span><span class="font0"> approach strictly to the character of romances of chivalry ; although in general they must be allowed to exceed the more tame northern fictions in dauntless vivacity of invention, and in their more strong tendency&nbsp;to the marvellous. Several specimens of the comic romance&nbsp;are also to be found mingled with those which are serious ;&nbsp;and we have the best and most positive authority that the&nbsp;recital of these seductive fictions is at this moment an amusement as fascinating and general among the people of the&nbsp;East, as the perusal of printed romances and novels among&nbsp;the European public. But a minute investigation into this&nbsp;particular species of romance would lead us from our present&nbsp;field, already sufficiently extensive for the limits to which&nbsp;our plan confines it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The European Romance, wherever it arises, and in whatsoever country it begins to be cultivated, had its origin in some part of the real or fabulous history of that country ;&nbsp;and of this we will produce, in the sequel, abundant proofs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But the simple tale of tradition has not passed through many mouths, ere some one, to indulge his own propensity&nbsp;for the wonderful, or to secure by novelty the attention of&nbsp;his audience, augments the meagre chronicle with his own&nbsp;apocryphal inventions. Skirmishes are magnified into great&nbsp;battles ; the champion of a remote age is exaggerated into&nbsp;a sort of demi-god ; and the enemies whom he encountered and subdued are multiplied in number, and magnified&nbsp;in strength, in order to add dignity to his successes against&nbsp;them. Chaunted to rhythmical numbers, the songs which&nbsp;celebrate the early valour of the fathers of the tribe become&nbsp;its war-cry in battle, and men march to conflict hymning&nbsp;the praises and the deeds of some real or supposed precursor who had marshalled their fathers in the path of victory.&nbsp;No reader can have forgotten that when the decisive battle&nbsp;of Hastings commenced, a Norman minstrel, Taillefer, advanced on horseback before the invading host, and gave the&nbsp;signal for onset, by singing the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Song of Roland,</span><span class="font0"> that renowned nephew of Charlemagne, of whom romance speaks&nbsp;so much, and history so little; and whose fall, with the chivalry of Charles the great in the pass of Roncesvalles, has&nbsp;given rise to such clouds of romantic fiction, that its very&nbsp;name has been for ever associated with it. The remarkable passage has been often quoted from the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Brut of Wace,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">an Anglo-Norman metrical chronicle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Taillefer, qui moult bien chantout Sur un cheval qui tost alout,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Devant le Duc alout chantant De Karlemaigne et de Reliant,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Et d’Oliver et des vassals,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Qui morurent en Rencevals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Which may be thus rendered :</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Taillefer, who sung both well and loud,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Came mounted on a courser proud ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Before the Duke the minstrel sprung.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">And loud of Charles and Roland sung,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Of Oliver and champions mo,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Who died at fatal Ronçevaux.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This champion possessed the sleight-of-hand of the juggler, as well as the art of the minstrel. He tossed up his sword&nbsp;in the air, and caught it again as he gallopped to the&nbsp;charge, and showed other feats of dexterity. Taillefer slew&nbsp;two Saxon warriors of distinction, and was himself killed by&nbsp;a third. Ritson, with less than his usual severe accuracy,&nbsp;supposed that Taillefer sung some part of a long metrical&nbsp;romance upon Roland and his history ; but the words </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">chanson, cantilena,</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">song,</span><span class="font0"> by which the composition is usually described, seems rather to apply to a brief ballad or national song ; which is also more consonant with our ideas&nbsp;of the time and place where it was chaunted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But neither with these romantic and metrical chronicles did the mind long remain satisfied ; more details were demanded, and were liberally added by the invention of those&nbsp;who undertook to cater for the public taste in such matters.&nbsp;The same names of kings and champions, which had first&nbsp;caught the national ear, were still retained, in order to secure attention, and the same assertions of authenticity, and&nbsp;of reference to real history, w<sup>r</sup>ere stoutly made both in the&nbsp;commencement and in the course of the narrative. Each&nbsp;nation, as will presently be seen, came atlength to adopt to itself a cycle of heroes like those of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Iliad;</span><span class="font0"> a sort of common property to all minstrels who chose to make use of them,&nbsp;under the condition always, that the general character ascribed to each individual hero was preserved with some degree of consistency. Thus, in the romances of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Round&nbsp;Table,</span><span class="font0"> Gawain is usually represented as courteous ; Kay&nbsp;as rude and boastful ; Mordred as treacherous ; and Sir&nbsp;Launcelot as a true though a sinful lover, and in all other&nbsp;respects a model of chivalry. Amid the Paladins of Charlemagne, whose cycle may be considered as peculiarly the&nbsp;property of French in opposition to Anglo-Norman ro-</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
