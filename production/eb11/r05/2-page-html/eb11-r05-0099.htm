<p><span class="font0">and they were of a hieratic character. The suggestion is that the written runes were introduced from the south of Europe by&nbsp;a Phoenician agency, and that they were copied from Greek or&nbsp;Roman coins which had found their way to Scandinavia. In&nbsp;several of the sagas it is recorded that runes were inscribed&nbsp;on round pieces of wood, called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">kefli,</span><span class="font0"> or runic sticks. It has been&nbsp;suggested that the Eddaic poems were preserved in this way,&nbsp;but the only authority for this is that the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sonalorrek-</span><span class="font0"> is said to&nbsp;have been taken down on a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">kefli.</span><span class="font0"> In Christian times runes&nbsp;came to be regarded as an archaic curiosity, and were engraved&nbsp;on sticks, chairs and spoons; a loto stick with runes on it&nbsp;is preserved in the Bodleian library. In the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Fornsogur</span><span class="font0"> runes&nbsp;are mentioned as carved on the blade of an oar. Even cases&nbsp;occur in which the normal Latin alphabet was called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">r&amp;nam&amp;l&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">or a language of Runes. A runic letter was called a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">runastafr</span><span class="font0"> in&nbsp;Icelandic.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RUNNIMEDE, or Runnymede, a meadow on the S. bank of the river Thames, England, in the county of Surrey and the&nbsp;parish of Egham. It is celebrated in connexion with the signature of Magna Carta </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.)</span><span class="font0"> by King John on the 15th of June&nbsp;1215. It has been disputed whether the ceremony took place&nbsp;actually in the meadow or on Magna Carta or Charter Island&nbsp;lying off it. The charter itself indicates Runnimede by name,&nbsp;but this may have included the island, which is the traditional&nbsp;site and was in 1217 the meeting-place of Henry III. and Louis&nbsp;(afterwards Louis VIII.) of France.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RUNNING, the most primitive form of athletic exercise considered as a sport. Athletic apparatus of every kind has&nbsp;been improved in modern times, but the spiked running-shoe&nbsp;may be said to represent the sole advantage enjoyed by the&nbsp;modem runner over his Olympic prototype. As an athletic&nbsp;sport running has been in vogue from the earliest times, and&nbsp;the simple foot-race (¿pojuos), run straight away from starting-point to goal, or once over the course of the stadion (a little&nbsp;over 200 yds.), formed an event in the Greek </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">pentathlon, or&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">quintuple games (see Games, Classical). It was diversified&nbsp;with the race once over the course and return, and the StAuXos,&nbsp;a long run many times (often as' many as twelve, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font0"> about&nbsp;21 m.) up and down the stadion. There was also the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sponos&nbsp;6tt\ltuv,</span><span class="font0"> a short race for warriors, who wore full armour and&nbsp;carried sword and shield, which has been imitated by the&nbsp;modem military race in full marching order. Except in the&nbsp;warriors* race the Greek runners were naked, save occasionally&nbsp;for a pair of light shoes. No records of the times made by the&nbsp;runners in the Greek races have been handed down. It may&nbsp;be inferred that the contests were very severe, since the ancient&nbsp;Olympic chronicles preserve the memory of several runners,&nbsp;of whom Ladas was the most conspicuous, who fell dead at&nbsp;the completion of the long course, and were buried in state&nbsp;with their brows encircled by the victor’s chaplet. In ancient&nbsp;Italy running was practised in circus exhibitions, as described&nbsp;by Virgil </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Aen.</span><span class="font0"> v. 286 seq.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the middle ages the best runners were oftenest found among the couriers maintained by potentates and municipalities, those of Tartary, England, Scotland, Italy and the&nbsp;Basque country having enjoyed the greatest reputation, while&nbsp;the Peichs, or Persian couriers of the Turkish sultans, often&nbsp;ran from Constantinople </span><span class="font1">to </span><span class="font0">Adrianople and back, a distance&nbsp;of about 220 m., in two days and nights. Many couriers carried&nbsp;silver beads in their mouths to obviate thirst. Couriers (syce)&nbsp;who run before the carriages of their masters are still in use&nbsp;in the East. In the districts of India not traversed by railways,&nbsp;dak runners are still employed to carry the mails from village&nbsp;to village, many wearing bells about their necks to frighten&nbsp;away the tigers. The runners of the American Indians were&nbsp;famous, and extraordinary tales are told of their swiftness and&nbsp;endurance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In all parts of Great Britain, running at short distances, as well as steeplechases and cross-country runs, has been popular for many centuries, each district and period having its&nbsp;champions, some of whom achieved national reputation. Hurting the Puritan rule and that of Charles II. athletic sports all but&nbsp;died out in England, only to be revived with renewed vigour&nbsp;in the early part of the 19th century, when the public schools&nbsp;and universities began to pay more attention to them. A&nbsp;significant event in the history of running was the institution&nbsp;of the famous “ Crick Run” (cross-country) at Rugby in 1837.&nbsp;The establishment of the Cambridge University sports (1857),&nbsp;the Oxford sports (i860), and the British championship meetings (1866) placed athletics upon a formal and recognized basis.&nbsp;Records made thereafter received the stamp of authenticity,&nbsp;those made in former years being doubtful on account of lax&nbsp;measurements and timing. In the United States and Canada&nbsp;authentic records date from the institution of the American&nbsp;Championships in 1876. The National Association of Amateur&nbsp;Athletes of America was formed in 1880.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Running at the present day is divided into sprinting (distances up to one-quarter of a mile), middle-distance running (from one-quarter of a mile to 1000 yds.) and long-distance&nbsp;running (over 1000 yds.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sprinting</span><span class="font0"> consists of running over short distances with a full and continuous burst of speed, the chief distances being&nbsp;100 yds., 220 yds. and quarter-mile. Distances up to and including 220 yds. are in America called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">dashes.</span><span class="font0"> The course for&nbsp;sprinting races, when run in the open air, is marked off in lanes&nbsp;for the individual runners by means of cords stretched upon&nbsp;short iron rods. Starting in sprints has now become very&nbsp;expert. The old method of dropping a handkerchief was the&nbsp;worst possible way to give the starting signal, since the muscles&nbsp;react most slowly to impressions of sight, less so to those of&nbsp;touch, and most quickly to those of sound, a difference of vfo&nbsp;of a second in reaction amounting to over one foot in a run of&nbsp;100 yds. All modem foot-races are therefore started by the&nbsp;pistol; the runners wait for the signal in a crouching attitude,&nbsp;with the fingers of both hands resting on the ground on each&nbsp;side of the body, from which position they spring upwards and&nbsp;forwards at the sound of the pistol. The crouching start was&nbsp;found to be much quicker in getting off the mark than the&nbsp;upright attitude formerly adopted, and by 1892 had been&nbsp;adopted by all first-class sprinters in America, and a year or&nbsp;two later in Great Britain. Another advantage is that the&nbsp;runner is steadier on the mark, and since its adoption the&nbsp;prescribed penalty of being placed one yard behind the mark&nbsp;for starting before the pistol-shot has been very seldom enforced,&nbsp;and the risky experiment of <sup>a</sup> beating the pistol,” </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font0"> letting&nbsp;the body fall forward in the hope that the shot would come&nbsp;before the feet had to be moved, has practically disappeared.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The improvement in training and the adoption of the crouching start have resulted in the continued reduction of sprinting records. “ Even time,” or 10 secs., is still considered a fine&nbsp;performance for the hundred yards, but has been repeatedly&nbsp;beaten both in England and America. A. F. Duffey, who,&nbsp;like C. A. Bradley and J. W. Alorton, won the English championship in four successive years, shares with D. J. Kelly the record,&nbsp;9!secs., for 100 yds.; and J. W. Morton, a Scot, as well as&nbsp;J. H. Hempton and W. T. Macpherson of New Zealand, are&nbsp;credited with 9I secs. The excellence of American runners&nbsp;in the sprints is probably accounted for partly by temperament&nbsp;influenced by climate; but the American practice of running</span></p>
