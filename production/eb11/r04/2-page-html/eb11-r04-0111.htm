<p><span class="font0">and Pyrrhus, unable any longer to face his opponents in the field, and disappointed of all assistance from his allies, retreated&nbsp;to disgust to Tarentum and thence crossed into Greece@@.<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A few years later (272) Tarentum was surrendered to Rome by its Epirot garrison; it was granted a&nbsp;treaty of alliance, but its walls were razed and its fleet handed&nbsp;over to Rome. In 270 Rhegium also entered the&nbsp;ranks of Roman allies, and finally in 269 a single&nbsp;campaign crushed the last efforts at resistance in</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Samnium. Rome was now at leisure to consolidate the position she had won. Between 273 and 263 three new colonies&nbsp;were founded in Samnium and Lucania—Paestum&nbsp;in 273, Beneventum in 268, Aesernia in 263. In&nbsp;central Italy the area of Roman territory was increased&nbsp;by the full enfranchisement (268) of the Sabines,@@<sup>3&nbsp;</sup>and of their neighbours to the east, the people of Picenum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To guard the Adriatic coast colonies were established at Ariminum (268), at Firmum and at Castrum&nbsp;Novum (264), while to the already numerous maritime</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">colonies was added that of Cosa in Etruria.@@<sup>3</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rome was now the undisputed mistress of Italy. The limits</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">of her supremacy to the north were represented roughly by a line drawn across the peninsula from the mouth of&nbsp;the Arno on the west to that of the Aesis on the east.@@<sup>4&nbsp;</sup>Beyond this line lay the Ligurians and the Celts; all&nbsp;south of it was now united as “ Italy” under the rule of Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But the rule of Rome over Italy, like her wider rule over the Mediterranean coasts, was not an absolute dominion over&nbsp;conquered subjects. It was in form at least a confederacy under</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Roman protection and guidance; and the Italians, like the provincials, were not the subjects, but the “ allies and friends ” of the Roman people.@@<sup>5</sup> In the treatment of these allies Rome consistently followed the maxim, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">divide et impera.</span><span class="font0"> In every possible&nbsp;way she strove to isolate them from each other, while binding them&nbsp;closely to herself. The old federal groups were in most cases&nbsp;broken up, and each of the members united with Rome by a&nbsp;special treaty of alliance. In Etruria, Latium, Campania and&nbsp;Magna Graecia the city state was taken as the unit; in central Italy&nbsp;where urban life was non-existent, the unit was the tribe. The&nbsp;northern Sabellian peoples, for instance—the Marsi, Paeligni,&nbsp;Vestini, Marrucini, Frentani—were now constituted as separate&nbsp;communities in alliance with Rome. In many cases, too, no&nbsp;freedom of trade or intermarriage was allowed between the allies&nbsp;themselves, a policy afterwards systematically pursued in the&nbsp;provinces. Nor were all these numerous allied communities&nbsp;placed on the same footing as regarded their relations with Rome&nbsp;herself. To begin with, a sharp distinction was drawn between&nbsp;the“ Latini” and the general mass of Italian allies. The&nbsp;“ Latins ” of this period had little more than the name&nbsp;in common with the old thirty Latin peoples of the&nbsp;days of Spurius Cassius. With a few exceptions, such as Tibur&nbsp;and Praeneste, the latter had either disappeared or had been&nbsp;incorporated with the Roman state, and the Latins cf 268 B.c.&nbsp;were almost exclusively the “ Latin colonies,” that is to say,&nbsp;communities founded by Rome, composed </span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font0">men of Roman&nbsp;blood, and whose only claim to the title “ Latin ” lay in the fact&nbsp;that Rome granted to them some portion of the rights and&nbsp;privileges formerly enjoyed by the old Latin cities under the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Cassian treaty.@@<sup>6</sup> Though nominally allies, they were in fact offshoots of Rome herself, bound to her by community of race,&nbsp;language and interest, and planted as Roman garrisons among&nbsp;alien and conquered peoples. The Roman citizen who joined&nbsp;a Latin colony lost his citizenship—to have allowed him to&nbsp;retain it would no doubt have been regarded as enlarging too&nbsp;rapidly the limits of the citizen body; but he received in</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">exchange the status of a favoured ally. The member of a Latin colony had the right of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">commercium</span><span class="font0"> and down to 268 @@<sup>7&nbsp;</sup>of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">conubium</span><span class="font0"> also with Roman citizens. Provided&nbsp;they left sons and property to represent them at home, they&nbsp;were free to migrate to Rome and acquire the Roman franchise.&nbsp;In war-time they not only shared in the booty, but claimed a&nbsp;portion of any land confiscated by Rome and declared “ public.”&nbsp;These privileges, coupled with their close natural affinities&nbsp;with Rome, successfully secured the fidelity of the Latin colonies,&nbsp;which became not only the most efficient props of Roman&nbsp;supremacy, but powerful agents in the work of Romanizing&nbsp;Italy. Below the privileged Latins stood the Italian&nbsp;allies; and here again we know generally that there&nbsp;were considerable differences of status, determined&nbsp;in each case by the terms of their respective treaties with Rome.&nbsp;We are told that the Greek cities of Neapolis and Heraclea&nbsp;were among the most favoured;@@<sup>8</sup> the Bruttii, on the other hand,&nbsp;seem, even before the Hannibalic War, to have been less generously treated. But beyond this we have no detailed information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rome, however, did not rely only on this policy of isolation. Her allies were attached as closely to herself as they were clearly&nbsp;separated from each other, and from the first she took every&nbsp;security for the maintenance of her own paramount authority.&nbsp;Within its own borders, each ally was left to manage its own&nbsp;affairs as an independent state.@@<sup>9</sup> The badges which marked&nbsp;subjection to Rome in the provinces—the resident magistrate&nbsp;and the tribute—were unknown in Italy. But in all points&nbsp;affecting the relations of one ally with another, in all questions&nbsp;of the general interests of Italy and of foreign policy, the&nbsp;decision rested solely with Rome. The place of a federal&nbsp;constitution, of a federal council, of federal officers, was filled&nbsp;by the Roman senate, assembly and magistrates. The maintenance of peace and order in Italy, the defence of the coasts&nbsp;and frontiers, the making of war or peace with foreign powers,&nbsp;were matters the settlement of which Rome kept entirely in&nbsp;her own hands. Each allied state, in time of war, was called&nbsp;upon for a certain contingent of men, but, though its contingent&nbsp;usually formed a distinct corps under officers of its own, its&nbsp;numerical strength was fixed by Rome, it was brigaded with the&nbsp;Roman legions, and was under the orders of the Roman consul.<sup>@@10</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This paramount authority of Rome throughout the peninsula was confirmed and justified by the fact that Rome herself was&nbsp;now infinitely more powerful than any one of her&nbsp;numerous allies. Her territory, as distinct from that&nbsp;of the allied states, covered something Eke one-third&nbsp;of the peninsula south of the Aesis. Along the west coast&nbsp;it stretched from Caere to the southern borders of Campania.&nbsp;Inland, it included the former territories of the Aequi and&nbsp;Hernici, the Sabine country, and even extended eastward into-.&nbsp;Picenum, while beyond these limits were outlying districts,&nbsp;such as the lands of the Senonian Celts, with the Roman colony&nbsp;of Sena, and others elsewhere in Italy, which had been confiscated by Rome and given over to Roman settlers. Since the&nbsp;first important annexation of territory after the capture of&nbsp;Veii (396), twelve new tribes had been formed,@@<sup>11</sup> and the&nbsp;number of male citizens registered at the census had&nbsp;risen from 152,000 to 290,000.@@<sup>12</sup> Within this enlarged Roman</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
