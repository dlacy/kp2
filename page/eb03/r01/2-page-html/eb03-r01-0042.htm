<p><span class="font2">naturally dread. To the above-mentioned means oſ aI-luring by trailing, way-baiting, and calling, is added another of a very material efficacy, which is, the uſe of&nbsp;oil of rhodium, which, like the marum Syriacum in thc&nbsp;caſe of cats, has a very extraordinary faſcinating power&nbsp;on theſe animals. This oil is extremely dear, and therefore ſparingly uſed. It is exalted in a ſmall quantity in&nbsp;the place, and at the entrance of it, where the rats are&nbsp;intended to be taken ; particularly at the time when&nbsp;tlicy are to be laſt brought together, in order to their&nbsp;deſtruction ; and it is uſed alfi&gt; by fτnearing it on the&nbsp;ſurface of ſome of the implements uſed in taking by the&nbsp;method below deſcribed ; and the effect it has in taking&nbsp;off their caution and dread, by the delight they appear&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">to </span><span class="font2">have in it, is very extraordinary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is uſual, likewife, for tlie operator to diſguiſe his figure as well as ſcent, which is done by putting on a&nbsp;fort of gown or cloak, of one colour, that hides the&nbsp;natural form, and makes him appear like a poſt or fome&nbsp;ſuch inanimate thing ; which habit muſt likewiſe be&nbsp;ſcented as above, to overpower the ſmell of his perſon&nbsp;and beſides this, he is to avoid all motion till he has ſe-cured his point of having all the rats in his power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">when the rats are thus enticed and collected, where time is afforded, and the whole in any houſe and outbuildings are intended to be cleared away, they are ſuffered to regale on what they moſt like, which is ready&nbsp;prepared for them, and then to go away quietly for two&nbsp;or three nights ; by which means thoſe that are not allured the firſt night are brought afterwards, either by&nbsp;their fellows, or the effects of the trailing, &amp;c. and will&nbsp;not fail to come duly again, if they are not diſturbed or&nbsp;moleſted. But many of the rat-catchers make ſhort -er work, and content themſelves with what can be&nbsp;brought together in one night or two ; but this is never effectual, unleſs· where the building is ſmall and en-tire, and the rats but few in number..</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The means of taking them, when they are brought together, are various. Some entice them into a very&nbsp;large bag, the mouth of which- is ſufficiently capacious&nbsp;to cover nearly the whole floor of the place where they&nbsp;are collected ; which is done by fmearing fome veffel,&nbsp;placed in the middle of the bag, with oil of rhodium,&nbsp;and laying in the bag baits of food. This bag, which&nbsp;before lay ſtat on the ground with the mouth ſpread&nbsp;open, is to be fuddenly cloſed when, the rats are all in..&nbsp;Others drive or fright them, by ſtight noiſes or motions,&nbsp;into a bag of a long form, the mouth of which, after all&nbsp;the rats, are come in, is drawn up to the opening of the&nbsp;place by whieh they entered, all other ways of retreat&nbsp;being ſeeured. others, again, intoxicate or poiſon them,&nbsp;by mixing with the repaſt prepared for them the cocu-Ius Indicus, or the nux vomica. They direct four oun-ces of the coculus Indieus, with twelve ounces of oatmeal, and two ounces of treacle or honey, made into a&nbsp;moiſt paſte with ſtrong-beer : but if the nux vomica be&nbsp;uſed, a much leſs proportion will ſerve than, is here given of the coculus. Any ſimilar compoſition of theſe&nbsp;drugs, with that kind of food the rats are moſt fond of,&nbsp;and which has a ſtrong flavour, to hide that of tlie&nbsp;drugs, will equally well anſwer the end. If indeed the&nbsp;coculus Indicus be well p⅛wdered, and infuſed in&nbsp;ſtrong-beer for ſome time, at leaſt half the quantity here&nbsp;directed will ſerve as well as the quantity before-men-</span><span class="font1">tioned. when the rats appear to be </span><span class="font2">thoroughly </span><span class="font1">in</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font2">toxicated with the coculus, or ſick with the nux vomica, they may be taken with the hand, and put into a bag or&nbsp;cage, the door of the place being firſt drawn to, leſt&nbsp;thoſe who have ſtrength and ſenſe remaining eſcape.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">RAT-Iſland,</span><span class="font2"> a ſmall detached part of the iſland of Lundy, off the north coaſt of Devon. ’ Though noted&nbsp;in Donn’s map of the county, it is not worth mention&nbsp;here, but as giving opportunity to ſubjoin a farther notice of Lundy, which iſland was purchaſed a few years&nbsp;ſince by Mr Cleveland Μ. </span><span class="font1">P. </span><span class="font2">for about 1200 guineas#&nbsp;who has a ſmall villa on it : not more than 400 acres&nbsp;are cultivated : it is let altogether for 70h a-year. The&nbsp;foil is good, though no trees will grow on the iſland.'&nbsp;It has fine ſprings of water : the houſes are ſeven : the&nbsp;inhabitants, men, women, and children, do not exceed&nbsp;24. The bird called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">murr,</span><span class="font2"> whoſe eggs are very large-and fine, the Lundy parrot, and rabbits, are the chief&nbsp;produce ; theſe abound, and are taken for the feathers,-eggs, and ſkins, principally. They have now (1794)&nbsp;70 bullocks and 400 ſheep, but the latter do not thrive.'&nbsp;They pay no taxes : fiſhing ſkiffs often call with neceſſaries : the ſituation is very pleaſant, and the rocks:&nbsp;around, which are large, and partly granite, are wild,,&nbsp;romantic, and novel. It had probably more inhabitants&nbsp;once, as human bones have been ploughed up. It has&nbsp;no place of worſhip, nor public-houſe; but ſtrangers&nbsp;are always welcome.

<p><span class="font2">Ratafia of cherries is prepared by bruiſing the cher-ries, and putting them into a veſſel wherein brandy has been long kept ; then adding to them the kernels of&nbsp;cherries, with ſtrawberries, ſugar, cinnamon, white j .<sub>1</sub>)∙&nbsp;per, nutmeg, cloves; and to 20 pound of cherries 10&nbsp;quarts of brandy. The veſſel is left open ten or twelve&nbsp;days, and then ſtopped cloſe for two months before it&nbsp;be tapped. Ratafia of apricots is prepared two ways,&nbsp;viz. either by boiling the apricots in white-wine, adding&nbsp;to the liquor an equal quantity of brandy, with fugar,&nbsp;cinnamon, mace, and the kernels of apricots ; infuſing&nbsp;the whole for eight or ten days ; then ſtraining the liquor, and putting it up for uſe : or elſe by infuſing the&nbsp;apricots, cut in pieces, in brandy, for a,day or two, paſſing it through a ſtraining bag, and then putting in the&nbsp;uſual ingredients.</span></p>
