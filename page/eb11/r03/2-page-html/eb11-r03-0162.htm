<p><span class="font0">climbing, the anterior pair with four toes and a rudimentary thumb, and the posterior pair with five toes, all the toes having long, curved&nbsp;and short-pointed claws (see Squirrel). The names </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Glyphotes</span><span class="font0"> and</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sciurotamias</span><span class="font0"> have been proposed respectively for one Bornean and some four Chinese squirrels. With </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Tamias</span><span class="font0"> (sometimes split into&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Tamias</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Eutamias)</span><span class="font0"> we reach the North American striped ground-squirrels, or chipmunks, well characterized by the large internal&nbsp;cheek-pouches, with one outlying species in Northern Asia and&nbsp;Europe (see Ground-Squirrel). These lead on to the sousliks,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Spermophilus</span><span class="font0"> (or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Citellus),</span><span class="font0"> in which the incisors (as in the following&nbsp;genera) differ from.those of all the squirrels in not being compressed.&nbsp;The genus which is common to the northern parts of both hemispheres is distinguished by the large cheek-pouches and by the&nbsp;absence or rudimentary condition of the claw of the first hind-toe,&nbsp;resembles </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Tamias</span><span class="font0"> in the slender form of the body, but displays&nbsp;great variation in the length of the tail, which may be a mere stump,&nbsp;or comparatively long. As in the following genera, there are&nbsp;two pairs of premolars, of which the first in this case is small and&nbsp;rounded, while the two series of cheek-teeth are nearly parallel&nbsp;(see Souslik). The prairie-dogs, or prairie-marmots, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Cynomys<sub>1&nbsp;</sub></span><span class="font0">are a North American group, in which the five-toed forefeet have&nbsp;the claw of the first as large as that of the fifth toe. The skull&nbsp;is heavily built, with the post-orbital processes directed outwards.&nbsp;Dentition (fig. 6) remarkably heavy, the molar teeth differing&nbsp;from those of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sperrnophilus</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Arctomys</span><span class="font0"> by having three instead&nbsp;of two transverse grooves on their crowns. First premolar nearly&nbsp;as large as the second. Molar series strongly convergent behind&nbsp;(see Prairie-Marmot). Finally, we have the marmots </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Arctomys)<sub>1&nbsp;</sub></span><span class="font0">which are larger and more heavily built rodents, with short ears,&nbsp;more or less short tails and rudimentary or no cheek-pouches.&nbsp;Fore-feet with the first toe rudimentary and bearing a fiat nail.&nbsp;Skull (fig. 4) large and heavy, with the post-orbital process stouter&nbsp;and at right angles to the axis. Incisors broad and powerful. First&nbsp;upper premolar nearly as large as the second. Molar series nearly&nbsp;parallel, scarcely converging behind at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The genus is common to the northern half of both hemispheres, and its members, like those of the two preceding groups, burrow&nbsp;and hibernate (see Marmot).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Nannosciurinae, or second sub-family of Sciuridae, are represented only by the pigmy squirrels </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Nannosciurus)<sub>1</sub></span><span class="font0"> characterized by their very short-crowned molars (which approximate to those of&nbsp;dormice in structure) and small premolars, of which the first upper&nbsp;pair is often deciduous, while the upper molars have only three&nbsp;oblique ridges. The front root of the zygomatic arch is nearly&nbsp;vertical, and placed so far back that it is above the second molar,&nbsp;while the orbit—a unique feature among rodents—is almost completely surrounded by bone. The few representatives of this group&nbsp;are all very small rodents, confined to tropical Africa, the Philippines and the Malay islands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The third and last sub-family, the Pteromyinae, is distinguished from the other two by the presence of a parachute-like fold of skin&nbsp;along the sides of the body, the supporting cartilage of which&nbsp;arises from the carpus or wrist. It includes </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ScUiropterus<sub>1</sub></span><span class="font0"> represented by small species from the northern parts of both hemispheres; </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pteromys<sub>1</sub></span><span class="font0"> comprising large flying-squirrels, ranging from&nbsp;India and the Malay countries to Japan, characterized by the long&nbsp;cylindrical tail and large inter-femoral membrane; and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Eupetaurus<sub>1&nbsp;</sub></span><span class="font0">represented, by one very large dark grey, long-tailed and longhaired species from Astor and Gilgit, which differs from all other&nbsp;members of the family by its tall-crowned cheek-teeth (see Flying-Squirrel).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Beavers.—</span><span class="font0">The second section, Castoroidea, of the present group includes only the family Castoridac, represented by the beavers,&nbsp;which are large aquatic rodents characterized by their massive&nbsp;skulls, devoid of post-orbital processes, with the angle of the lower&nbsp;jaw rounded, the molars rootless or semi-rooted, with re-entering&nbsp;enamel-folds, and one pair of premolars above and below. The&nbsp;tibia and fibula are united inferiorly, the tympanic bulla is&nbsp;hollow and the infra-orbital foramen narrow. The single existing&nbsp;genus comprises the European beaver, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Castor fiber,</span><span class="font0"> of Europe and&nbsp;Northern Asia, and the North American C. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">canadensis.</span><span class="font0"> The upper&nbsp;molars are subequal, each with one internal and two external&nbsp;enamel-folds; the stomach has a large glandular mass situated to&nbsp;the right of the oesophageal orifice; the anal and urino-genital&nbsp;orifices open within a common cloaca; the tail is broad, horizontally flattened and naked; and the hind-feet are webbed (see&nbsp;Beaver).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pouched Rats.</span><span class="font0">—The American pouched rats, or pocket-gophers, constitute the third section, Geomyoidea, with the single family&nbsp;Geomyidae. The dentition includes one pair of premolars above&nbsp;and below, and rooted or rootless molars with but few enamel-folds. ln the skull the infra-orbital foramen is narrow’, and postorbital processes and an alisphenoid canal are absent. The tibia&nbsp;are fibula are united. The cheeks are provided with large pouches&nbsp;opening externally. Two sub-families are recognized. The first of&nbsp;these, or Geomyinae, is characterized as follows: Incisors broad;&nbsp;mastoid not appearing on the top of the skull; eyes small; ears&nbsp;rudimentary; limbs short, subequal. Habits fossorial. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Geomys&nbsp;bursarius,</span><span class="font0"> the “ red pocket-gopher.” of North America, with deeply&nbsp;grooved incisors, inhabits the plains of the Mississippi, living in&nbsp;burrows like the mole. Several other species from the Southern&nbsp;States, Mexico and Central America are recognized. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Thomomys&nbsp;talpoides,</span><span class="font0"> with plain incisors, extending from Canada to the United&nbsp;States west of the Rocky Mountains, typifies the second genus,&nbsp;which has also many species. The following are the characters of&nbsp;the second sub-family, Heteromyinae: Incisors narrow; mastoid&nbsp;appearing largely on the top of the skull; eyes and ears moderate&nbsp;or large; hind-limbs and tail elongated. Habits terrestrial.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dipodomys<sub>1</sub></span><span class="font0"> which has the molars rootless, is typified by </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">D. Phillipi<sub>1&nbsp;</sub></span><span class="font0">the kangaroo-rat of the desert regions east of the Rocky Mountains,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Perodipus</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Microdipodops</span><span class="font0"> being allied genera. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Perognathus&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Heteromys</span><span class="font0"> have rooted molars; the latter genus is distinguished&nbsp;by the presence of flattened spines among the fur, and has species&nbsp;extending into South America. (See Pocket-Gopher, Pocket-Mouse and Kangaroo-Rat.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Scalydailed Squirrels.—</span><span class="font0">The next section, according to Prof. Max Weberis arrangement, is that of the Anomaluroidea, typified&nbsp;by the rodents commonly called African flying-squirrels (Anoma-Iuridae), but better designated scale-tailed squirrels, or simply&nbsp;“ scaly-tails,” since one member of the family has no parachute.&nbsp;To this group Prof. H. Winge affiliates the African jumping-hares.&nbsp;(Pedetidae), a view which is adopted by Prof. Weber, although Mr&nbsp;O. Thomas places these rodents in the neighbourhood of the porcupines. In the more extended sense, the Anomaluroidea are diagnosed&nbsp;as follows: In the skull the infra-orbital foramen (or canal) is&nbsp;large, the lachrymal foramen placed high up, and no transverse&nbsp;canal; while the malleus and incus of the internal ear are fused.&nbsp;In the carpus the scaphoid and lunar bones are united. There is a&nbsp;single pair of premolars in each jaw.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Anomaluridae are characterized by having rooted cheek-teeth with shallow transverse enamel-folds, the two halves of the lower&nbsp;jaw movably articulated in front, very small post-orbital processes&nbsp;to the skull, and the presence of two rows of scales on the under&nbsp;surface of the base of the tail (figs. 7 and 8), which is cylindrical&nbsp;and thickly haired. The family is confined to the equatorial&nbsp;forest-tract of Africa, where it is most numerously represented&nbsp;on the west side. The majority of the species belong to the typical&nbsp;genus </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Anomalurus</span><span class="font0"> (fig. .7), which is provided with a parachute&nbsp;supported by a cartilaginous process arising from the olecranon&nbsp;of the ulna, and has well-developed ears and a moderately long tail.&nbsp;Several of the species are considerably larger than an ordinary&nbsp;squirrel. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Idiurus<sub>1</sub></span><span class="font0"> as represented by the West African </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">I. zenkeri&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(figured in the article Flying-Squirrel), is a mouse-like form,&nbsp;with very small ears and an extremely long tail. The third genus,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Zenkerella (Aethurus)<sub>1</sub></span><span class="font0"> which is also West African, has no parachute&nbsp;(fig. 8).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Jumping-Hares.</span><span class="font0">—The grounds for referring the African jumping-hares (Pcdetidae) to the Anomaluroidca rest largely on the evidence of certain Tertiary rodents from Europe, such as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Issiodoromys.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">The family is represented by the South African </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pedetes cajfer,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">which is as large as a hare, and the smaller East African </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">P. surdaster.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">ln general habits and appearance these animals recall large jerboas,&nbsp;from which group they are, however, distinguished by the four&nbsp;pairs of rooted cheek-teeth, the premolars being as large as the&nbsp;molars, and the latter having one outer and one inner enamel-fold.&nbsp;The hind-limbs are elongated, with four toes, of which the metatarsals are separate; the tibia and fibula are welded in old age;&nbsp;the calcanéum and astragalus, of the tarsus are elongated; and&nbsp;there is a perforation on the inner side of the lower end of the&nbsp;humerus (see Jumping-Hare).</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
