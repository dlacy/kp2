a market town of the county of Buckingham, in the hundred of Stoke. Though a town it is not a parish, one part being within the parish of Upton, and another part in the parish of Stoke Poggis. It is twenty miles from London and two from Eton, and is furnished with excellent inns, being on the great road to Bath and Bristol. It has a market on Thursday. It is chiefly remarkable from having been the residence of the celebrated astronomer Dr. Herschel, who constructed, in a garden near the road, his large and invaluable telescope, and made those discoveries in the heavens which have immortalised his name.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
