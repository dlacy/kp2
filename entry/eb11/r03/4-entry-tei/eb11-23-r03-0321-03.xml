               <p>                   RIEMANN, GEORG FRIEDRICH BERNHARD (1826-1866), German
                    mathematician, was born on the 17th of September</p>                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r03-0322" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0345.jp2"/>
               <p>1826, at Breselenz, near Dannenherg in Hanover. His father, Friedrich Bernhard
                    Riemann, came from Mecklenburg, had served in the war of freedom, and had
                    finally settled as pastor in Quickborn. Here with his five brothers and sisters
                    Ricmann spent his boyhood and received, chiefly from his father, the elements of
                    his education. He showed at an early age well-marked mathematical powers, and
                    his progress was so rapid in arithmetic and geometry that he was soon beyond the
                    guidance not only of his father but of schoolmaster Schulz, who assisted in the
                    mathematical department of his training.</p>               <p>In 1840 he went to Hanover, where he attended the lyceum, and two years later he
                    entered the Johanneum at Lüneburg. The director, Schmalfuss, encouraged him in
                    his mathematical studies by lending him books (among them Leonhard Euler’s works
                    and Adrien Marie Legendre’s <hi rend="italic">Theory of Numbers),</hi> which
                    Riemann read, mastered and returned within a few days. In 1846 Riemann entered
                    himself as a student of philology and theology in the university of Göttingen.
                    This choice of a university career was dictated more by the natural desire of
                    his father to see his son enter his own profession, and by the poverty of his
                    family, than by his own preference. He attended lectures on the numerical
                    solution of equations and on definite integrals by M. A. Stern, on terrestrial
                    magnetism by Goldschmidt, and on the method of least squares by K. F. Gauss. It
                    soon became evident that his mathematical studies, undertaken at first probably
                    as a relaxation, were destined to be the chief business of his life. He
                    proceeded in the beginning of 1847 to Berlin, attracted thither by that
                    brilliant constellation of mathematical genius whose principal stars were P. G.
                    L. Dirichlet, C. G. J. Jacobi, J. Steiner and F. G. M. Eisenstein. He appears to
                    have attended Dirichlet’s lectures on theory of numbers, theory of definite
                    integrals, and partial differential equations, and Jacobi’s on analytical
                    mechanics and higher algebra. It was during this period that he first formed
                    those ideas on the theory of functions of a complex variable which led to most
                    of his great discoveries. One stirring social incident at least marked this part
                    of his life, for, during the revolutionary insurrection in March 1848, the young
                    mathematician, as a member of a company of student volunteers, kept guard in the
                    royal palace from 9 o’clock on the morning of the 24th of March till 1 o’clock
                    on the afternoon of the following day.</p>               <p>In 1850 he returned to Göttingen and began to prepare his doctor’s dissertation,
                    busying himself meanwhile with “ Naturphilosophie ” and experimental physics.
                    This double cultivation of his scientific powers had the happiest effect on his
                    subsequent work; for the greatest achievements of Riemann were effected by the
                    application in pure mathematics generally of a method (theory of potential)
                    which had up to this time been used solely in the solution of certain problems
                    that arise in mathematical physics.</p>               <p>In November 1851 he obtained his doctorate, the thesis being “ Grundlagen für
                    eine allgemeine Theorie der Functionen einer veränderlichen complexen Grösse.”
                    This memoir excited the admiration of Gauss, and at once marked its author’s
                    rank as a mathematician. The fundamental method of research which Riemann
                    employed has just been alluded to; the results will be best indicated in his own
                    words:—</p>               <p>The methods in use hitherto for treating functions of a complex variable always
                    started from an expression for the function as its definition, whereby its value
                    was given for every value of the argument; by our investigation it has been
                    shown that, in consequence of the general character of a function of a complex
                    variable, in a definition of this sort one part of the determining conditions is
                    a consequence of the rest, and the extent of the determining conditions has been
                    reduced to what is necessary to effect the determination. This essentially
                    simplifies the treatment of such functions. Hitherto, in order to prove the
                    equality of two expressions for the same function, it was necessary to transform
                    the one into the other, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> to show that both
                    expressions agreed for every value of the variable; now it is sufficient to
                    prove their agreement to a far less extent ” [merely in certain critical points
                    and at certain boundaries].</p>               <p>The time between his promotion to the doctorate and his habilitation as <hi
                        rend="italic">Privatdozent</hi> was occupied by researches undertaken for
                    his Habilitationsschrift, by “ Naturphilosophie,” and by experimental work. The
                    subject he had chosen for his Habilitationsschrift was the “ Representation of a
                    Function by Means of a Trigonometrical Series,” a subject which Dirichlet had
                    made his own by a now well-known series of researches. It was fortunate, no
                    doubt, for Riemann that he had the kind advice and encouragement of Dirichlet
                    himself, who was then on a visit at Göttingen during the preparation of his
                    essay; but the result was a memoir of such originality and refinement as showed
                    that the pupil was fully the equal of the. master. Of the customary three themes
                    which he suggested for his trial lecture, that “ On the Hypotheses which form
                    the Foundation of Geometry” was chosen at the instance of Gauss, who was curious
                    to hear what so young a man had to say on this difficult subject, on which he
                    himself had in private speculated so profoundly (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Geometry, Non-Euclidian).</hi>
               </p>               <p>In 1855 Gauss died and was succeeded by Dirichlet, who along with others made an
                    effort to obtain Riemann’s nomination as extraordinary professor. In this they
                    were not successful; but a government stipend of 200 thalers was given him, and
                    even this miserable pittance was of great importance, so straitened were his
                    circumstances. But this small beginning of good fortune was embittered by the
                    deaths of his father and his eldest sister, and by the breaking up of the home
                    at Quick-born. Meantime he was lecturing and writing the great memoir <hi
                        rend="italic">(Borchardt's Journal,</hi> vol. liv., 1857) in which he applied
                    the theory developed in his doctor’s dissertation to the Abelian functions. It
                    is amusing to find him speaking jubilantly of the unexpectedly large audience of
                    eight which assembled to hear his first lecture (in 1854) on partial
                    differential equations and their application to physical problems.</p>               <p>Riemann’s health had never been strong. Even in his boyhood he had shown
                    symptoms of consumption, the disease that was working such havoc in his family;
                    and now under the strain of work he broke down altogether, and had to retire to
                    the Harz with his friends Ritter and R. Dedekind, where he gave himself up to
                    excursions and “ Naturphilosophie.” After his return to Gottingen (November
                    1857) he was made extraordinary professor, and his salary raised to 300 thalers.
                    As usual with him, misfortune followed close behind; for he lost in quick
                    succession his brother Wilhelm and another sister. In 1859 he lost his friend
                    Dirichlet; but his reputation was now so well established that he was at once
                    appointed to succeed him. Well-merited honours began to reach him; and in i860
                    he visited Paris, and met with a warm reception there. He married Elise Koch in
                    June 1862, but the following month he had an attack of pleurisy which proved the
                    beginning of a long illness that ended only with his death. His physician
                    recommended a sojourn in Italy, for the benefit of his health, and Weher and
                    Sartorius von Waltershausen obtained from the government leave of absence and
                    means to defray the cost of the journey. At first it seemed that he would
                    recover; but on his return in June 1863 he caught cold on the Splügen Pass, and
                    in August of the same year had to go back to Italy. In November 1865 he returned
                    again to Göttingen, but, although he was able to live through the winter, and
                    even to work a few hours every day, it became clear to his friends, and clearest
                    of all to himself, that he was dying. In order to husband his few remaining days
                    he resolved in June 1866 to return once more to Italy. Thither he journeyed
                    through the confusion of the first days of the Austro-Prussian War, and settled
                    in a villa at Selasca near Intra on Lago Maggiore. Here his strength rapidly
                    ebbed away, but his mental faculties remained brilliant to the last. On the 19th
                    of July 1866 he was working at his last unfinished investigation on the
                    mechanism of the ear. The day following he died. Few as were the years of work
                    allotted to him, and few as are the printed pages covered by the record of his
                    researches, his name is, and will remain, a household word among mathematicians.
                    Most of his memoirs are masterpieces—full of original methods, profound ideas
                    and far-reaching imagination.</p>               <p>The collected works of Riemann were published by H. Weber, assisted by R.
