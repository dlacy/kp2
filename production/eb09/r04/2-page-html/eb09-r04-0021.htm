        <p><span class="font1">Russia is on the whole a thinly-peopled country, the average -
                population being but 42 to the square mile. The density of&nbsp;population varies,
                however, very much in European Russia—from&nbsp;one inhabitant per square mile in
                the government of Archangel to&nbsp;102 in that of Moscow (exclusive of the capital)
                and 138 in&nbsp;Podolia. Two-thirds of the whole population are
                concentrated&nbsp;upon less than one-third of the whole surface. The most
                thickly-peopled parts form a strip of territory which extends from&nbsp;Galicia
                through Kieff to Moscow, and comprises partly the most&nbsp;fertile governments of
                Russia and partly the manufacturing ones ;&nbsp;next come a strip of fertile country
                to the south of the above and&nbsp;the manufacturing provinces of the upper Volga.
                The black-earth&nbsp;region has an average of 90 inhabitants per square mile ;
                the&nbsp;central manufacturing region, 85 ; the western provinces, 79 ;
                the&nbsp;black-earth and clay region, 38 ; the black-earth Steppes, 33 ;

        <p><span class="font1">The rate at which the population is increasing throughout the empire
                is very considerable. It varies, however, very much in&nbsp;different parts, and
                even in European Russia, being almost twice&nbsp;as high in the fertile tracts of
                the south as it is in the north (1<sup>,</sup>8&nbsp;to PO). The rapid increase is
                chiefly due to early marriages, the&nbsp;peasants for the most part marrying their
                sons at eighteen and their&nbsp;daughters at sixteen. The resulting high birth-rate
                compensates&nbsp;for the great mortality, and the Russian population is
                increasing&nbsp;more quickly than the Polish, Lithuanian, Finnish, or Tartar.

        <p><span class="font1">These figures agree pretty nearly with those for a series of years
                (1871-78), which gave an annual surplus of 945,000 for&nbsp;European Russia alone.
                In 1882, throughout the empire—leaving&nbsp;out of account Caucasus and Turgai—the
                births numbered&nbsp;4,403,555 and the deaths 3,464,404, for an estimated
                population&nbsp;of 95,565,100. But the birth-rate and death-rate were
                very&nbsp;different in Russia proper and in the Asiatic dominions ; in
                the&nbsp;former they reached respectively 4<sup>-</sup>8 3 and 3<sup>-</sup>77, and
                in the latter&nbsp;only 3<sup>-</sup>75 and 2<sup>-</sup>84. The low birth-rate in
                Asia counterbalances&nbsp;the low mortality. So also within Russia proper : in the
                central&nbsp;provinces the high mortality (35 per thousand) is compensated by&nbsp;a
                high birth-rate (49), while in the western provinces, where the&nbsp;mortality is
                relatively small (27), the number of births is also the&nbsp;lowest (37).</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">On the whole, the mortality in Russia is greater than anywhere else
                in Europe. The lowest figures are found in Courland (20),&nbsp;the Baltic provinces
                (22), and Poland (30). Within Russia itself&nbsp;the rate varies between 29 and 49
                (30 to 38 in towns). In 1882&nbsp;the average mortality in the 13 central
                governments reached the&nbsp;exceptional figure of 62, so that there was a decrease
                of 1<sup>-</sup>7 per&nbsp;cent, in the aggregate population. The mortality is
                highest&nbsp;among children, only one-half of those born reaching their
                seventh&nbsp;year. From military registers it appears that of 1000 males
                born&nbsp;only 480 to 490 reach their twenty-first year, and of these only&nbsp;375
                are able-bodied ; of the remainder, who are unfit for military&nbsp;service, 50 per
                cent, suffer from chronic diseases. Misery, insanitary dwellings, and want of food
                account for this high mortality,&nbsp;which is further increased by the want of
                medical help, there being&nbsp;in Russia with Poland only 15,348 males and 66 female
                surgeons,&nbsp;7679 assistants, and ohe bed in hospital for every 1270
                inhabitants.&nbsp;The hospitals are, however so unequally distributed, that in
                63&nbsp;governments having an aggregate country population of about&nbsp;76,000,000
                there were only 657 hospitals with 8273 beds, and an&nbsp;average of two surgeons to
                100,000 inhabitants.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all" />
        <p><span class="font1">The rate of emigration from the Russian empire is not high. In
                1871-80 the average number was 280,700 yearly, and the immigration 245,500. But
                within the empire itself migration to South&nbsp;Ural, Siberia, and Caucasus goes on
                extensively ; figures, however,&nbsp;even approximate, are wanting. During the ten
                years 1872-81 no&nbsp;less than 406,180 Germans and 235,600 Austrians immigrated
                into&nbsp;Russia, chiefly to Poland and the south-western provinces.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">A very great diversity of religions, including (besides numerous
                varieties of Christianity) Mohammedanism, Shamanism, and&nbsp;Buddhism, are found in
                European Russia, corresponding for the&nbsp;most part with the separate ethnological
                subdivisions. All&nbsp;Russians, with the exception of a number of White Russians
                who&nbsp;belong to the Union, profess the Greek Orthodox faith or one or&nbsp;other
                of the numberless varieties of nonconformity. The Poles&nbsp;and most of the
                Lithuanians are Roman Catholics. The Esthes&nbsp;and all other Western Finns, the
                Germans, and the Swedes&nbsp;are Protestant. The Tartars, the Bashkirs, and
                Kirghizes are&nbsp;Mohammedans ; but the last-named have to a great
                extent&nbsp;maintained along with Mohammedanism their old Shamanism.&nbsp;The same
                holds good of the Mescheriaks, both Moslem and&nbsp;Christian. The Mordvinians are
                nearly all Greek Orthodox, as&nbsp;also are the Votiaks, Voguls, Tcheremisses, and
                Tchuvashes, but&nbsp;their religions are, in reality, very interesting modifications
                of&nbsp;Shamanism, under the influence of some Christian and Moslem&nbsp;beliefs.
                The Voguls, though baptized, are in fact fetichists, as&nbsp;much as the unconverted
                Samoyedes. Finally, the Kalmucks are&nbsp;Buddhist Lamaites.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">All these religions are met with in close proximity to one another,
                and their places of worship often stand side by side in the&nbsp;same town or
                village without giving rise to religious disturbances.&nbsp;The recent outbreaks
                against the Jews were directed, not against&nbsp;the Talmudist creed, but against
                the trading and exploiting&nbsp;community of the “Kahal.” In his relations with
                Moslems,&nbsp;Buddhists, and even fetichists, the Russian peasant looks rather
                to&nbsp;conduct than to creed, the latter being in his view simply a matter&nbsp;of
                nationality. Indeed, towards paganism, at least, he is perhaps&nbsp;even more than
                tolerant, preferring on the whole to keep on good&nbsp;terms with pagan divinities,
                and in difficult circumstances—&nbsp;especially on travel and in hunting—not failing
                to present to them&nbsp;his offering. Any idea of proselytism is quite foreign to
                the&nbsp;ordinary Russian mind, and the outbursts of proselytizing
                zeal&nbsp;occasionally manifested by the clergy are really due to the
                desire&nbsp;for “Russification,” and traceable to the influence of the
                higher&nbsp;clergy and of the Government.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The various creeds of European Russia were estimated in 1879 as
                follows :—Greek Orthodox and Raskolniks, 63,835,000 (about&nbsp;12,000,000 being
                Raskolniks) ; United Greeks and Armenio-Gregorians, 55,000; Roman Catholics,
                8,300,000; Protestants,&nbsp;2,950,000 ; Jews, 3,000,000 ; Moslems, 2,600,000 ;
                Pagans, 26,000.&nbsp;In 1881 the number of Greek Orthodox throughout the
                empire,&nbsp;excluding two foreign bishoprics, was estimated at
            61,941,000.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Nonconformity (Raskoi) is a most important feature of Russian popular
                life, and its influence and prevalence have rapidly grown&nbsp;during the last
                twenty-five years.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">When, towards the beginning of the 17th century, the Moscow
                principality fell under the rule of the Moscow </span><span class="font1"

                acquired to increase their wealth by a series of measures affecting land-holding and
                trade ; they sanctioned and enforced by law&nbsp;the serfdom which had already from
                economical causes found its&nbsp;way into Russian life. The great outbreak of
                1608-12 weakened&nbsp;their power in favour of that of the czar, but without
                breaking it ;&nbsp;and throughout the reigns of Michael and Alexis the </span><span

                were&nbsp;issued in the name of “the czar and boiars.” Serfdom was reinforced by a
                series of laws, and the whole of the 17th century is characterized by a rapid
                accumulation of wealth in the hands of boiars,&nbsp;by the development of luxury,
                imported from Poland, and by the&nbsp;struggle of a number of families to acquire
                the political power&nbsp;already enjoyed by their Polish neighbours. The same
