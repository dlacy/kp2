The emotions raiſed by the fine arts are for the moft part too nearly related to make a figure by reſemblance ; and for that reafon their fucceſſion ought to be regu-latcd as much as poſſible by contrail. This holds confcffedly in epic and dramatic compoſitions ; and the belt writers, led perhaps by taſte more than by rea-foning, have generally aimed at that "beauty. It holds equally in muſic : in the ſame cantata all the variety of emotions that are within the power of muſic, may not only be indulged, but, to make the greateſt figure, ought to be contraſted. In gardening, there is an ad-ditional reaſon for the rule : the emotions raiſed by that art, are at beſt ſo faint, that every artifice ſirould be employed to give them their utmoſt vigour : a field may be laid out in grand, ſweet, gay, neat, wild, melancholy ſcenes ; and when theſe are viewed in ſucceſ</p><p>ſion, grandeur ought to be contraſted with neatnefs, regularity with wildneſs, and gaiety with melancholy, ſo as that each emotion may fucceed its oppoſite : nay, it is an improvement to intermix in the fucceſſion rude uncultivated ſpots as well as unbounded views, which in themſelves are diſagreeable, but in ſucceſſion heighten the feeling of the agreeable object ; and we have nature for our guide, which in her moſt beautiful landſcapes often intermixes rugged rocks, dirty marſties, and barren ſtony heaths. The greateſt maſters of mu-ſic have the ſame view in their compoſitions : the fecond part of an Italian ſong ſeldom conveys any ſentiment : and, by lts harſhneſs, ſeems purpoſely contrived to give a greater reliſli for the interefting parts of the compoſition.</p><p>A ſmall garden, comprehended under a fingle view, affords little opportunity for that embelliſhment. Diſſi-milar emotions require different tones of mind ; and therefore in conjunction can never be pleaſant : gai-ety and ſweetneſs may be combined, or wildneſs and gloomineſs ; but a compoſition of gaiety and gloomi-neſs is diſtaſteſul. The rude uncultivated compartment of furze and broom in Richmond garden, hath a good effect in the fucceſſion of objects ; but a ſpot of that nature would be inſufferable in the midſt of a poliſhed parterre or flower-plot. A garden, therefore, if not of great extent, admits not diſſimilar emotions ; and in ornamenting a ſmall garden, the ſafeſt courſe is to confine it to a ſingle expreſſion. For the ſame reafon, a landſcape ought alſo to be confined to a fingle ex-preſſion ; and accordingly it is a rule in painting, that if the ſubject be gay, every figure ought to contribute to that emotion.</p><p>It follows from the foregoing train of reaſoning, that a garden near a great city ought to have an air of ſolitude. The folitarineſs, again, of a waſte country ought to be contraſted in forming a garden ; no temples, no obfcure walks ; but <hi rend="italic">jets d’eau,</hi>  caſcades, objects active, gay, and ſplendid.. Nay, fuch a gat den ſhould in ſome meaſure avoid imitating nature, by taking on an ex-traordſhary appearance of regularity and art, to ſhow the buſy hand of man, which in a waſte country has a fine effect by contraſt.</p><p>wit and ridicule make not an agreeable mixture</p><lb/><p>with grandeur, Diſſimilar emotions have a fine effect in a flow ſucceſſion ; but in a rapid ſucceſſion, which approaches to co-exiſtence, they will not be reliſhed. In the midſt of a laboured and elevated deſcription of battle, virgil introduces a ludicrous image, which is certainly out of its pla"ce :</p><p>obvius ambuſtum torrem Chorinæus ab ara Corripit, ct veπienti Ebυfo plagamque ferenti occupai os fiammis : illi ingens barba relûxit, Nidoremque ambuſta dédit.    <hi rend="italic">'Æn.</hi>  xii. 298,</p><p>E quai tauro ferito, il fuo dolore verfo mugghiando e fofpirando fuore.</p><p><hi rend="italic">GierufaI</hi>  cant. 4. ſt. 1. It would however be too auſtere to baniſh altogether ludicrous images from an epic poem. This poem doth not always ſoar above the clouds : it admits great variety ; and upon occafion can deſcertd even to the ground without finking. In its more familiar tones, a ludicrous ſcene may be introduced without impropriety. This is done by virgil * in a foot-race : the cir</p><p>cumſtances of which, not excepting the ludicroιis part, are copied from Homer f. After a fit of merriment, we are, it is true, the leſs difpoſed to the ferious and fublime : but then, a ludicrous ſcene, by unbending the mind from ſevere application to more intereſting ſubjects, may prevent fatigue, and preſerve our reliſli entire.</p><p>RESEN, (Moſes) ; a town on the Tigris, built by Nimrod ; thought to be the <hi rend="italic">Larijſa</hi>  of Xenophon ; which ſee.

By revenge, the inflicting of pain upon the perfon who has injured or offended us, farther than the juſt ends of puniſhment or reparation require. Anger prompts to revenge ; but it is poſſible to ſuſpend the effect when we cannot altogether quell the principle, we are bound alfo to endeavour to qualify and correct the principle itfelf. So that our duty requires two different applications of thc mind : and for that reaſon anger and revenge ihould bc confidered feparately.” See Revenge.</p><p>RESERVATION, in law, an action or clauſe whereby fomething is reſerved, or ſecured to one’s felf.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Mental Reservation,</hi>  a propoſition which, ſtrictly taken, and according to the natural import oſ the terms, is falſe ; but, if qualified by fomething concealed in the mind, becomes true.</p><p>Mental reſervations are the great refuge of religious hypocrites, who uſe them to accommodate their confidences with their intereſte : the Jeſuits are zealous ad-vocates for mental reſervations ; yet are they real lies, as including an intention to deceive.</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
