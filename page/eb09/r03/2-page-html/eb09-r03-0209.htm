<p><span class="font0">by his mother’s relations and was in the first place committed by them to the tutorship of a M. Lambercier, pastor at Bossey. Of these times as of the greater part&nbsp;of his life there are ample details in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Confessions,</span><span class="font0"> but&nbsp;it may be as well to remark at once that this famous book,&nbsp;however charming as literature, is to be used as documentary evidence only with great reserve. In 1724 he&nbsp;was removed from this school and taken into the house of&nbsp;his uncle Bernard, by whom he was shortly afterwards&nbsp;apprenticed to a notary. His master, however, found or&nbsp;thought him quite incapable and sent him back. After a&nbsp;short time (April 25, 1725) he was apprenticed afresh,&nbsp;this time to an engraver. He did not dislike the work,&nbsp;but was or thought himself cruelly treated by his master.&nbsp;At last in 1728, when he was sixteen, he ran away, the&nbsp;truancy being by his own account unintentional in the&nbsp;first instance, and due to the fact of the city gates being&nbsp;shut earlier than usual. Then began a very extraordinary&nbsp;series of wanderings and adventures, for much of which&nbsp;there is no authority but his own. He first fell in with&nbsp;some proselytizers of the Roman faith at Confignon in&nbsp;Savoy, and by them he was sent to Madame de Warens&nbsp;at Annecy, a young and pretty widow who was herself a&nbsp;convert. Her influence, however, which was to be so&nbsp;great, was not immediately exercised, and he was, so to&nbsp;speak, passed on to Turin, where there was an institution&nbsp;specially devoted to the reception of neophytes. His&nbsp;experiences here were (according to his own account, it&nbsp;must always be understood) sufficiently unsatisfactory,&nbsp;but he abjured duly and was rewarded by being presented&nbsp;with twenty francs and sent about his business. He&nbsp;wandered about in Turin for some time, and at last established himself as footman to a Madame de Vercellis.&nbsp;Here occurred the famous incident of the theft of a ribbon,&nbsp;of which he accused a fellow servant—a girl too. But,&nbsp;though he kept his place by this piece of cowardice,&nbsp;Madame de Vercellis died not long afterwards and he was&nbsp;turned off. He found, however, another place with the&nbsp;Comte de Gouvon, but lost this also through coxcombry.&nbsp;Then he resolved to return to Madame de Warens at&nbsp;Annecy. The chronology of all these events is somewhat&nbsp;obscure, but they seem to have occupied about three&nbsp;years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Even then Rousseau did not settle at once in the anomalous but to him charming position of domestic lover&nbsp;to this lady, who, nominally a converted Protestant, was&nbsp;in reality, as many women of her time were, a kind of&nbsp;deist, with a theory of noble sentiment and a practice&nbsp;of libertinism tempered by good nature. It used to be&nbsp;held that in her conjugal relations she was even more&nbsp;sinned against than sinning. But recent investigations&nbsp;seem to show that M. de Vuarrens (which is said to be the&nbsp;correct spelling of the name) was a very unfortunate husband, and was deserted and robbed by his wife. However,&nbsp;she welcomed Rousseau kindly, thought it necessary to&nbsp;complete his education, and he was sent to the seminarists of St Lazare to be improved in classics, and also to&nbsp;a music master. In one of his incomprehensible freaks he&nbsp;set off for Lyons, and, after abandoning his companion in an&nbsp;epileptic fit, returned to Annecy to find Madame de Warens&nbsp;gone no one knew whither. Then for some months he&nbsp;relapsed into the life of vagabondage, varied by improbable&nbsp;adventures, which (according to his own statement) he&nbsp;so often pursued. Hardly knowing anything of music, he&nbsp;attempted to give lessons and a concert at Lausanne;&nbsp;and he actually taught at Neuchâtel. Then he became&nbsp;or says he became secretary to a Greek archimandrite who&nbsp;was travelling in Switzerland to collect subscriptions for&nbsp;the rebuilding of the Holy Sepulchre ; then he went to&nbsp;Paris, and, with recommendations from the French ambassador at Soleure, saw something of good society ; then he&nbsp;returned on foot through Lyons to Savoy, hearing that&nbsp;Madame de Warens was at Chambéry. This was in 1732,&nbsp;and Rousseau, who for a time had unimportant employments in the service of the Sardinian crown, <sup>-</sup>was shortly&nbsp;installed by Madame de Warens, whom he still called&nbsp;Maman, as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">amant en titre</span><span class="font0"> in her singular household,&nbsp;wherein she diverted herself with him, with music, and&nbsp;with chemistry. In 1736 Madame de Warens, partly for&nbsp;Rousseau’s health, took a country house, Les Charmettes,&nbsp;a short distance from Chambéry. Here in summer, and&nbsp;in the town during winter, Rousseau led a delightful life,&nbsp;which he has delightfully described. In a desultory way&nbsp;he did a good deal of reading, but in 1738 his health&nbsp;again became bad, and he was recommended to go to&nbsp;Montpellier. By his own account this journey to Montpellier was in reality a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">voyage à Cythere</span><span class="font0"> in company with a&nbsp;certain Madame de Larnage. This being so, he could&nbsp;hardly complain when on returning he found that his&nbsp;official position in Madame de Warens’s household had&nbsp;been taken by a person named Vintzenried. He was,&nbsp;however, less likely than most men to endure the position&nbsp;of second in command, and in 1740 he became tutor at&nbsp;Lyons to the children of M. de Mably, not the well-known&nbsp;writer of that name, but his and Condillac’s elder brother.&nbsp;But Rousseau did not like teaching and was a bad teacher,&nbsp;and after a visit to Les Charmettes, finding that his place&nbsp;there was finally occupied, he once more went to Paris in&nbsp;1741. He was not &quot;without recommendations. But a&nbsp;new system of musical notation which he thought he had&nbsp;discovered was unfavourably received by the Académie des&nbsp;Sciences, where it was read in August 1742, and he was&nbsp;unable to obtain pupils. Madame Dupin, however, to&nbsp;whose house he had obtained the entry, procured him the&nbsp;honourable if not very lucrative post of secretary to M. de&nbsp;Montaigu, ambassador at Venice. With him he stayed for&nbsp;about eighteen months, and has as usual infinite complaints&nbsp;to make of his employer and some strange stories to tell.&nbsp;At length he threw up his situation and returned to Paris&nbsp;(1745).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Up to this time—that is to say, till his thirty-third year— Rousseau’s life, though continuously described by himself,&nbsp;was of the kind called subterranean, and the account of it&nbsp;must be taken with considerable allowances. There are,&nbsp;to say the least, grave improbabilities in it ; there are some&nbsp;chronological difficulties ; and in one or two instances his&nbsp;accounts have been flatly denied by persons more or less&nbsp;entitled to be heard. He had written nothing, and if he&nbsp;was known at all it was as an eccentric vagabond. From&nbsp;this time, however, he is more or less in view; and, though&nbsp;at least two events of his life—his quarrel with Diderot&nbsp;and his death—are and are likely long to be subjects of&nbsp;dispute, its general history can be checked and followed&nbsp;with reasonable confidence. On his return to Paris he&nbsp;renewed his relations with the Dupin family and with the&nbsp;literary group of Diderot, to which he had already been&nbsp;introduced by M. de Mably’s letters. He had an opera,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Les Muses Galantes,</span><span class="font0"> privately represented ; he copied music&nbsp;for money, and received from Madame Dupin and her son-in-law M. de Francueil a small but regular salary as&nbsp;secretary. He lived at the Hotel St Quentin for a time,&nbsp;and once more arranged for himself an equivocal domestic&nbsp;establishment. His mistress, whom towards the close of&nbsp;his life he married after a fashion, was Thérèse le Vasseur,&nbsp;a servant at the inn. She had little beauty, no education&nbsp;or understanding, and few charms of any kind that his&nbsp;friends could discover, besides which she had a detestable&nbsp;mother, who was the bane of Rousseau’s life. But he&nbsp;made himself at any rate for a time quite happy with her,&nbsp;and (according to Rousseau’s account, the accuracy of</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
