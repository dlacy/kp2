It condenses readily with aldehydes, yielding with formaldehyde, on the addition ot a little hydrochloric acid, methylene diresorcin [(HO)<hi rend="sub">2</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">  -C<hi rend="sub">6</hi>HjI<hi rend="sub">2</hi></hi>  -CH<hi rend="sub">2</hi>, whilst with chloral hydrate, in the presence of potassium bisulphate, it yields the lactone of tetra-oxydiphenyl methane carboxylic acid (J. T. Hewitt and F. G. Pope,<hi rend="italic">Jour. Chem. Soc.,</hi>  1897, 71, p. 1084). In alcoholic solution it cou-denses with sodium acetoacetate to form ß-methylumbelliferone, Ci<hi rend="sub">0</hi>H<hi rend="sub">8</hi>O<hi rend="sub">3</hi>  (A.

The dose is 2 to 8 grs. Used externally it is an antiseptic and disinfectant, and is used 5 to 10% in ointments in the treatment of chronic skin diseases such as psoriasis and eczema of a sub-acute character. Weak, watery solutions of resorcin (ro or 15 grs. to the ounce) are useful in allaying the itching in erythematous eczema. A 2% solution used as a spray has been used with marked effect in hay fever and in whooping-cough. In the latter disease 10 minims of the 2% solution has been given internally. It has also been employed in the treatment of gastric ulcer in doses of 2 to 4 grs. in pill, and is said to be analgesic and haemostatic in its action. In large doses it is a poison causing giddiness, deafness, salivation, sweating and convulsions. It is also worked up in certain medicated soaps. Mono-acetyl resorcin, C<hi rend="sub">e</hi>H<hi rend="sub">4</hi>(OH)-O-COCH<hi rend="sub">3</hi>, is used under the name of “ euresol.”</p><p><hi rend="italic">Resazurin,</hi>  C12H7NO4, obtained by the action of nitrous acid on resorcin (P. Weselsky and R. Benedikt, <hi rend="italic">Monats.,</hi>  1880, I, p. 889), forms small dark red crystals possessing a greenish metallic glance. When dissolved in concentrated sulphuric acid and warmed to 210° C., the solution on pouring into water yields a precipitate of <hi rend="italic">resorufin,</hi>  Ci<hi rend="sub">2</hi>H<hi rend="sub">7</hi>  NO3, an Oxypnenoxazone, which is insoluble in water, but is readily soluble in hot concentrated hydrochloric acid, and in solutions of caustic alkalis. The alkaline solutions are of a rose-red colour and show a cinnabar-red fluorescence.A tetrabrom resorufin is used as a dye-stuff under the name of <hi rend="italic">Fluorescent Resorcin Blue.</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">Thwresorcin</hi>  is obtained by the action of zinc and hydrochloric acid on the chloride of benzene meta-disulphonic acid. It melts at 27° C. and boils at 2&lt;13° C. <hi rend="italic">Resorcin disulphonic Acid </hi>(HO)»CeH<hi rend="sub">2</hi>(HSOji)2, is a deliquescent mass obtained by the action of sulphuric acid on resorcin (H.

(1). <hi rend="smallcaps">Anatomy</hi>—The respiratory tract consists of the nasal cavities, the pharynx, the larynx, the trachea, the bronchi and the lungs, but of these the two first parts have been treated in separate articles (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Olfactory System</hi>  and <hi rend="smallcaps">Pharynx).</hi></p><p>The <hi rend="italic">larynx</hi>  is the upper part of the air tube which is specially modified for the production of notes of varying pitch, though it is not responsible for the whole of the voice. Its framework is made up of several cartilages which are moved on one another by muscles, and it is lined internally by mucous membrane which is continuous above with that of the pharynx and below with that of the trachea or windpipe. The larynx is situated in the front of the neck and corresponds to the. fourth, fifth and sixth cervical vertebrae. For its superficial anatomy see <hi rend="smallcaps">Anatomy, </hi><hi rend="italic">Superficial and Artistic.</hi></p><p>The <hi rend="italic">thyroid cartilage</hi>  (see fig. 1) is the largest, and consists of two plates or <hi rend="italic">alae</hi>  which are joined in the mid-ventral line. At the upper part of their junction is the <hi rend="italic">thyroid notch</hi>  and just below that is a forward projection, the <hi rend="italic">pomum Adami,</hi>  best marked in adult males. From the upper part of the posterior border of each ala the <hi rend="italic">superior cornu</hi>  rises up to be joined to the tip of the great cornu of the hyoid bone by the <hi rend="italic">lateral thy r ο-hy oid ligament,</hi>  while from the lower part of the same border the <hi rend="italic">inferior cornu</hi>  passes down to be fastened to the cricoid cartilage by the <hi rend="italic">crico-thyroid</hi>  capsule. From the upper border of each ala the <hi rend="italic">thyro-hyoid membrane</hi>  runs up to the hyoid bone, while near the back of the outer surface of each the <hi rend="italic">oblique line of</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">the thyroid cartilage</hi></p><p>runs downward and</p><p>forward.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">cricoid cartilage</hi>  (see figs, i and 2) is something like a signet ring with the seal behind; its lower border, however, is horizontal.</p><p>To the mid-ventral part of its upper border is attached the mesial part of the <hi rend="italic">crico - thyroid membrane,</hi>  which attaches it ,to the lower border? of the thyroid cartilage though the lateral parts of this membrane pass up internally to the thyroid cartilage and their upper free edges form the true <hi rend="italic">vocal cords.</hi>  On the summit of the signet part of the cricoid are placed the two <hi rend="italic">arytenoid cartilages</hi>  (see fig. 2), each of which forms a pyramid with its apex upward and with an anterior posterior and internal or mesial surface. The base articulates with the cricoid by a concave facet, surrounded by the <hi rend="italic">crico-arytenoid capsule,</hi>  and the two arytenoids are able to glide toward or away from one another, in addition to which each can rotate round a vertical axis. From the front of the base a delicate process projects which, as it is attached to the true vocaI cord, is called the <hi rend="italic">vocal process, </hi>while from the outer part of the base another stouter process</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
