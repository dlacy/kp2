<p><span class="font1">and Prussian Saxôny on the north. The former portion is known as the Oherland and the latter as thé Unterland. Owing&nbsp;to the fertility of the Unterland, quite one-quarter of the people&nbsp;are supported by agricultural pursuits, although there is also&nbsp;much industrial activity. The chief industrial product consists&nbsp;of woollen goods, and the manufacture centres in the capital&nbsp;Gera, the largest of the six towns of the principality. Other&nbsp;industries are jute-spinning, dyeing and brewing, and the&nbsp;manufacture of musical instruments, chemicals, tohacco,&nbsp;cigars, porcelain and machinery. A considerable trade is&nbsp;carried on in these goods and also in timber, cattle and slate.&nbsp;Iron is mined in the Oberland, and large quantities of salt are&nbsp;yielded by the brine springs of Heinrichshall. In 1905 Reuss-Schleiz contained 144,584 inhabitants. Its annual revenue&nbsp;and expenditure amount to about £129,000, and in 1908 it had&nbsp;a public debt of £52,027. The constitution, which rests on&nbsp;laws of 1852 and 1856, provides for a representative assembly&nbsp;of 16 members which possesses limited legislative powers, the&nbsp;administrative duties being discharged by a cabinet of three&nbsp;members. The reigning prince is Henry XIV. (h. 1832), but&nbsp;since 1892 his duties have been undertaken by a regent. The&nbsp;states of Reuss return one member each to the Bundesrat, and&nbsp;one each to the Reichstag of the German empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">History.—</span><span class="font1">The history of Reuss stretches back to the times when the German kings appointed vogts, or bailiffs </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(advocati&nbsp;imperii),</span><span class="font1"> to administer their lands. One of these vogts was a&nbsp;certain Henry, who died about 1120, after having been entrusted&nbsp;by the emperor Henry IV. with the vogtship of Gera and of&nbsp;Weida, and he is generally recognized as the ancestor of the&nbsp;princes of Reuss. His descendants called themselves lords of&nbsp;Weida, and some of them were men of note in their day, serving&nbsp;the emperors and German kings and distinguishing themselves&nbsp;in the ranks of the Teutonic order. The land under their rule&nbsp;gradually increased in size, and it is said that the name of&nbsp;Reuss was applied to it owing to the fact that one of its princes&nbsp;married a Russian princess, their son being called <sup>44</sup> der Russe,”&nbsp;or the Russian. Another version is that the prince received&nbsp;this sobriquet because he passed man) years in Russia. The&nbsp;district thus called Reuss was at one time much more extensive&nbsp;than it is at present, and for some years its rulers were margraves&nbsp;of Meissen. In 1564 the family was divided into three branches&nbsp;by the sons of Henry XVI. (d. 1535). One of these hecame extinct in 1616, but the remaining ones are those of Reuss-Greiz&nbsp;and Reuss-Schleiz-Gera, which are flourishing to-day. Although&nbsp;there have been further divisions these have not been lasting,&nbsp;and the lands of the former family have been undivided since&nbsp;1768 and those of the latter since 1848. Thc lords of Reuss&nbsp;took the title of count in 1673 ; and the head of the elder line became&nbsp;a prince of the Empire in 1778, and the head of the younger&nbsp;line in 1806. In 1807 the two princes joined the Confederation&nbsp;of the Rhine and in 1815 the German confederation. In 1866&nbsp;Reuss-Greiz was compelled to atone for its active sympathy&nbsp;with Austria by the payment of a fine. In 1871 both principalities became members of the new German empire. The&nbsp;princes of Reuss are very wealthy, their private domain including&nbsp;a great part of the territory over which they rule. In the&nbsp;event of either line becoming extinct, its possessions will fall&nbsp;to the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A curious custom prevails in the house of Reuss. The male members of both branches of the family all bear the name of&nbsp;Henry (Heinrich), the individuals being distinguished by&nbsp;numbers. In the elder line, according to an arrangement made&nbsp;in 1701, the enumeration continues until the number one&nbsp;hundred is reached when it begins again. In the younger line&nbsp;the first prince born in a new century is numbered I., and the&nbsp;numbers follow on until the end of the century when they&nbsp;begin again. Thus Henry XIV. of Reuss younger line, who&nbsp;was born in 1832, was the son of Henry LXVII. (1789-1867),&nbsp;the former being the 14th prince born in the 19th century, and&nbsp;the latter the 67th prince born in the 18th.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">REUTER, FRITZ (1810-1874), German novelist, was bom on the 7th of November 1810, at Stavenhagen, in Mecklenburg-Schwerin, a small country town where his father was burgomaster and sheriff </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Stadtrichter),</span><span class="font1"> and in addition to his official&nbsp;duties carried on the work of a farmer. He was educated at&nbsp;home by private tutors and subsequently at the gymnasiums&nbsp;of Friedland in Mecklenburg-Strelitz, and of Parchim. In&nbsp;1831 he began to attend lectures on jurisprudence at the university of Rostock, and in the following year went to the university&nbsp;of Jena. Here he was a member of the political students’ club,&nbsp;or German Burschenschaft, and in 1833 was arrested in Berlin&nbsp;by the Prussian government; although the only charge which&nbsp;could be proved against him was that he had been seen wearing&nbsp;its colours, he was condemned to death for high treason. This&nbsp;monstrous sentence was commuted by King Frederick William III.&nbsp;of Prussia to imprisonment for thirty years in a Prussian&nbsp;fortress. In 1838, through the personal intervention of the&nbsp;grand-duke of Mecklenburg, he was delivered over to the&nbsp;authorities of his native state, and the next two years he spent&nbsp;in the fortress of Dömitz, but in 1840 was set free, an amnesty&nbsp;having been proclaimed after the accession of Frederick William&nbsp;IV. to the Prussian throne.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Although Reuter was now thirty years of age, he went to Heidelberg to resume his legal studies; but he soon found it&nbsp;necessary to return to Stavenhagen, where he aided in the&nbsp;management of his father’s farm. After his father’s death,&nbsp;however, he abandoned farming, and in 1850 settled as a&nbsp;private tutor at the little town of Treptow in Pomerania. Here&nbsp;he married Luise Kunze, the daughter of a Mecklenburg pastor.&nbsp;Reuter’s first publication was a coUection of misceUanies,&nbsp;written in Plattdeutsch, and entitled </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">LHuschen un Riemels&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(“ anecdotes and rhymes,” 1853; a second coUection foUowed&nbsp;in 1858). The book, which was received with encouraging&nbsp;favour, was foUowed by </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Polterabendgedichte</span><span class="font1"> (1855), and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">De&nbsp;ReiP nah Belligen</span><span class="font1"> (1855), the latter a humorous poem describing&nbsp;the adventures of some Mecklenburg peasants who resolve to&nbsp;go to Belgium (which they never reach) to learn the secrets of&nbsp;an advanced civilization. In 1856 Reuter left Treptow and&nbsp;established himself at Neubrandenburg, resolving to devote his&nbsp;whole time to Uterary work. His next book (pubUshed in 1858)&nbsp;was </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Kein Hüsung,</span><span class="font1"> an epic in which he presents with great force&nbsp;and vividness some of the least attractive aspects of viUage Ufe&nbsp;in Mecklenburg. This was foUowed, in i860, by </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hanne Nute&nbsp;un de lutte Pudel,</span><span class="font1"> the best of the works written by Reûter in&nbsp;verse. In 1861 Reuter’s popularity was largely increased by&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Schurr-Murr,</span><span class="font1"> a coUection of tales, some of which are in High&nbsp;German, but this work is of sUght importance in comparison&nbsp;with the series of stories, entitled </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Olle Kamellen</span><span class="font1"> (“ old stories&nbsp;of bygone days ”). The first volume, published in i860, contained IFoawj </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ick tau’ne Fru kam</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ut de Franzosentid. Ut&nbsp;mine Festungstid</span><span class="font1"> (1861) formed the second volume; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ut mine&nbsp;Stromtid</span><span class="font1"> (1864) the third, fourth and fifth volumes; and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dorch-lauchting</span><span class="font1"> (1866) the sixth volume—aU written in the Plattdeutsch&nbsp;dialect of the author’s home. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Woans ick tau <sup>f</sup>ne Fru kam</span><span class="font1"> is a&nbsp;bright little tale, in which Reuter teUs, in a half serious half&nbsp;bantering tone, how he wooed the lady who became his wife.&nbsp;In </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ut de Franzosentid</span><span class="font1"> the scene is laid in and near Stavenhagen&nbsp;in the year 1813, and the characters of the story are associated&nbsp;with the great events which then stirred the heart of Germany&nbsp;to its depths. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ut mine Festungstid</span><span class="font1"> is of less general interest&nbsp;than </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ut de Franzosentid,</span><span class="font1"> a narrative of Reuter’s hardships&nbsp;during the term of his imprisonment, but it is not less vigorous&nbsp;either in conception or in style. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ut mine Stromtid</span><span class="font1"> is by far&nbsp;the greatest of Reuter’s writings. The men and women he&nbsp;describes are the men and women he knew in the villages and&nbsp;farmhouses of Mecklenburg, and the circumstances in which he&nbsp;places them are the circumstances by which they were surrounded&nbsp;in actual life. As in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ut de Franzosentid</span><span class="font1"> he describes the deep&nbsp;national impulse in obedience to which Germany rose against</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
