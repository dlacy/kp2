in <hi rend="italic">Navigation,</hi> an assemblage of several breadths of canvass, sew ed together by the lists, and edged round with cord, fastened to the yards of a ship, to make it drive before the wind.</p><p>The edges of the cloths or pieces of which a sail is composed, are generally sewed together with a double seam ; and the whole is skirted round at the edges with a cord, called the bolt-rope. Although the form of sails is extremely different, they are all nevertheless triangular or quadrilateral figures ; or, in other words, their surfaces are contained either between three or four sidcs.</p><p>The former of these are sometimes spread by a yard, as lateen-sails, and otherwise by a stay, as stay-sails, or by a mast, as shoulder-of-mutton sails ; in all which cases the foremost leech or edge is attached to the said yard, mast, or stay, throughout its whole length. The latter, or those which are four-sided, are either extended by yards, as the principal yards of a ship ; or by yards and booms, as the studding-sails, drivers, ring-tails, and all those sails which are set occasionally ; or by gaffs and booms, as the mainsails of sloops and brigantines. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Ship</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Ship-build-</hi> ING.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sail</hi> is also a name applied to any vessel seen at a distance under sail, and is equivalent to ship.</p><p><hi rend="italic">To set</hi> <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Sail,</hi> is to unfurl and expand the sails upon their respective yards and stays, in order to begin the action of sailing.</p><p><hi rend="italic">To make</hi> <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Sail,</hi> is to spread an additional quantity of sail, so as to increase the ship’s velocity.</p><p><hi rend="italic">To shorten</hi> <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Sail,</hi> is to reduce or take in part, of the sails, with an intention to diminish the ship’s velocity.</p><p><hi rend="italic">To strike</hi> <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Sail,</hi> is to lower it suddenly. This is particularly used in saluting or doing homage to a superior force, or to one whom the law of nations acknowledges as superior in certain regions. Thus all foreign vessels strike to a British man-of-war in the British seas.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
