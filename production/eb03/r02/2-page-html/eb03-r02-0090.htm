<p><span class="font1">ROBINIA, </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">false acacia,</span><span class="font1"> in botany: A genus of the decandria order, belonging to the diadelphia claſs&nbsp;of plants ; and in the natural method ranking under&nbsp;the 3 2d order, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Papilionacea<sup>,</sup>.</span><span class="font1"> The calyx is quadriſid ;&nbsp;the legumen gibbous and elongated. There are nine&nbsp;ſpecies. The moſt remarkable are the caragnana and fe-rox, the leaves of the former of which are conjugated, and&nbsp;compoſed of a number of ſmall folioles, of an oval figure,&nbsp;and ranged by pairs on one common ſtock. The flowers&nbsp;are leguminous, and are cluſtered on a filament. Every&nbsp;flower conſiſts of a </span><span class="font0">ſ</span><span class="font1">mall bell-ſhaped petal, cue into four&nbsp;ſegments at the edge, the upper part being rather the&nbsp;wideſt. The keel is ſmall, open, and rounded. The&nbsp;wings are large, oval, and a little raiſed. Within are&nbsp;10 ſtamina united at the bafe, curved towards the top,&nbsp;and rounded at the ſummit. In the midſt of a ſheath,&nbsp;formed by the filaments of the ſtamina, the piſtil is perceivable, conſiſting of an oval germen, terminated by a&nbsp;kind of button. This germen becomes afterwards an&nbsp;oblong flattiſh curved pod, containing four or five&nbsp;ſe ds, of a ſize and ſhape irregular and unequal ; yet in&nbsp;both reſpects ſomewhat reſembling a lentil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This tree grows naturally in the ſevere climates of Northern Aſia, in a ſandy ſoil mixed with black light&nbsp;earth. It is particularly found on the banks of great&nbsp;rivers, as the Oby, Jeniſia, &amp;c. It is very rarely met&nbsp;with in the inhabited parts of the country, becauſe&nbsp;cattle’are very fond of its leaves, and hogs of its roots ;&nbsp;and it is ſo hardy, that the ſevereſt winters do not affect it. Gmelin found it in the neighbourhood of To-bolik, buried under 15 feet of ſnow and ice, yet had&nbsp;it not ſuffered the leaſt damage. Its culture conſiſts in&nbsp;being planted or ſowed in a lightiſh ſandy ſoil, which&nbsp;muſt on no account have been lately manured. It&nbsp;thrives beſt near a river, or on the edge of a brook or&nbsp;ſpring4 but preſently dies if planted in a marſhy ſpot,&nbsp;where the water ſtagnates. If it is planted on a rich&nbsp;ſoil, well tilled, it will grow to the height of 20 feet,&nbsp;and in a very few years will be as big as a common&nbsp;birch tree.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In a very bad ſoil this tree degenerates, and becomes a mere ſhrub : the leaves grow hard, and their fine&nbsp;bright green colour is changed to a dull deep green.&nbsp;The Tonguſian Tartars, and the inhabitants of the&nbsp;northern parts of Siberia, are very fond of the fruit of&nbsp;this tree, it being almoſt the only </span><span class="font0">ſ</span><span class="font1">ort of pulſe they eat.&nbsp;M. Strahlemberg, author of a well-eſteemed deſcription</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">of Siberia, allures us that this fruit is tolerably pleaſant food, and very nouriſhing. Theſe peaſe are firſt infilled in boiling water, to take off a certain acrid taſte&nbsp;they have, and are afterwards dre</span><span class="font0">ſſ</span><span class="font1">ed like common peaſe&nbsp;or Windſor beans ; and being ground into meal, pretty&nbsp;good cakes are made of them. The leaves and tender&nbsp;ſhoots of this tree make excellent fodder for ſeveral&nbsp;forts of cattle., 7 he roots, being ſweet and ſucculent,&nbsp;are very well adapted to fattening hogs ; and the fruit&nbsp;is greedily eaten by all </span><span class="font0">ſ</span><span class="font1">orts of poultry. After ſeveral&nbsp;experiments ſomewhat ſimilar to the methods uſed with&nbsp;anil and indigo, a fine blue colour was procured from&nbsp;its leaves. The ſmaller kind of this tree ſeems ſtill. better adapted to anſwer this purpoſe. The ſtrik'ing elegance of its foliage, joined to the pleaſing yellow colour of its beautiful flowers, ſhould, one would imagine,&nbsp;bring it into requeſt for forming noſegays, or for ſpeed-ily making an elegant hedge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Beſides the qualities above recited, it poſſeſſes the uncommon advantage of growing exceedingly quick,&nbsp;and of being eaſily tranſplanted. There are large plantations of it now in Sweden, Norway, Lapland, and&nbsp;Iceland. Linnæus aſſures us, that, after the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pinus jol.&nbsp;quints,</span><span class="font1"> erroneouſly called the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">cedar tree of Siberia,</span><span class="font1"> this&nbsp;tree, of all that are to be found in Siberia, is moſt worthy of cultivation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">2. The robinia ferox is a beautiful hardy ſhrub, and, on account of its robuſt ſtrong prickles, might be introduced into this country as a hedge plant, with much&nbsp;propriety. It reſiſts the ſevereſt cold of the climate of&nbsp;St Peterſhurgh, and perfects its ſeed in the garden of&nbsp;the empreſs there. It riſes to the height of fix or&nbsp;eight ſeet ; does not ſend out ſuckers from the root,&nbsp;nor ramble </span><span class="font0">ſ</span><span class="font1">o much as to be -with difficulty kept within bounds. Its flowers are yellow, and the general colour of the plant a light pleaſing green. A figure of&nbsp;it is given in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Flora Roſſlca</span><span class="font1"> by Dr Pallas, who&nbsp;found it in the ſouthern diſtricts, and font the feeds to&nbsp;St Peterſhurgh, where it has proſpered in a ſituation&nbsp;where few plants can be made to live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROBINS (Benjamin), a moſt ingenious mathematician, was born at Bath in 1707. His parents were Quakers, and of low condition, conſequently neither&nbsp;able nor willing to have him much inſtructed in human&nbsp;learning. Nevertheleſs his own propenlity to ſcience&nbsp;procured him a recommendation to Dr Pemberton at&nbsp;London ; by whoſe aſſiſtance, while he attained the&nbsp;ſublimer parts of mathematical knowledge, he commenced teacher of the mathematics. But the buſineſs of&nbsp;teaching, which required confinement, not ſuiting his&nbsp;active diſpoſition, he gradually declined it, and engaged&nbsp;in buſineſs that required more exerciſe. Hence he tried&nbsp;many laborious experiments in gunnery, from the per-ſuaſion that the reſiſtance of the air has a much greater&nbsp;influence on ſwift projectiles than is generally imagined.&nbsp;Hence alſo he was-led to conſider the mechanic arts&nbsp;that depend on mathematical principles ; as the conſtruction of mills, the building of bridges, the draining&nbsp;of fens, the rendering of rivers navigable, and the making of harbours. Among other arts, fortification&nbsp;much engaged his attention ; and he met with opportunities pi perfecting himſelf by viewing the principal&nbsp;ſtrong places of Flanders, in </span><span class="font0">ſ</span><span class="font1">ome tours he made abroad&nbsp;with perſons of diſtinction.</span></p>
