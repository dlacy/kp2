The&nbsp;larger cities (St Petersburg, Moscow, Odessa, Sevastopol, Kcrtch-Yenikala, Nikolayev, Rostov) have an administrative system&nbsp;of their own, independent of the governments; in these the&nbsp;chief of police acts as governor. As organs of the&nbsp;central government there are further, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ispravniki,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">chiefs of police in the districts into which the governments are&nbsp;divided. These are nominated by the governors,@@<sup>1</sup> and have&nbsp;under their orders in the principal localities commissaries</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(stanovoi pristav). Ispravniki</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">stanovoi</span><span class="font0"> alike are armed with large and ill-defined powers; and, since they are for the&nbsp;most part illiterate and wholly ignorant of the law, they&nbsp;have proved exasperating engines of oppression. Towards&nbsp;the end of the reign of Alexander II., the government, in order&nbsp;to preserve order in the country districts, also created a special&nbsp;class of mounted rural policemen </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(uryadniki,</span><span class="font0"> from </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">uriad,</span><span class="font0"> order),&nbsp;who, armed with power to arrest all suspects on the spot,&nbsp;rapidly became the terror of the countryside.@@<sup>2</sup> Finally, in the&nbsp;towns every house is provided with a detective policeman in&nbsp;the person of the porter </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(dvornik),</span><span class="font0"> who is charged with the duty&nbsp;of reporting to the police the presence of any suspicious&nbsp;characters or anything else that may interest them.@@<sup>3</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In addition to the above there is also a police organization, in direct subordination to the ministry of the interior, of&nbsp;which the principal function is the discovery, prevention and extirpation of political sedition. A&nbsp;secret police, armed with inquisitorial and arbitrary&nbsp;powers, has always existed in autocratic Russia. Its most&nbsp;famous development was the so-called “ Third Section ” (of the&nbsp;imperial chancery) instituted by the emperor Nicholas I. in&nbsp;1826. This was entirely independent of the ordinary police,&nbsp;but was associated with the previously existing corps of&nbsp;gendarmes </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Korpus Zhandarmov),</span><span class="font0"> whose chief was placed at&nbsp;its head. Its object had originally been to keep the emperor&nbsp;in close touch with all the branches of the administration and&nbsp;to bring to his notice any abuses and irregularities (see&nbsp;Nicholas I.), and for this purpose its chief was in constant&nbsp;personal intercourse with the sovereign. Actually, however,&nbsp;its activity, directed mainly to the discovery of political&nbsp;offences, degenerated into a hideous reign of terror. Its&nbsp;organization was spread all over Russia; its procedure was&nbsp;secret and summary (transportation by administrative order);&nbsp;and, its instruments being for the most part ignorant and</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">largely corrupt, its victims were counted by thousands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The “ Third Section ” was suppressed by Alexander II. in 1880, but only in name. In fact it was transformed into a&nbsp;separate department of the ministry of the interior, and,&nbsp;provided with an enormous secret service fund, soon dominated&nbsp;the whole ministry. The corps of gendarmes was also incorporated in this department, the under-secretary of the interior&nbsp;being placed at its head and at that of the police generally,&nbsp;with practically unlimited jurisdiction in all cases which,&nbsp;in the judgment of the minister of the interior, required to be&nbsp;dealt with by processes outside the ordinary law. In 1896&nbsp;the powers of the minister were extended at the expense of&nbsp;those of the under-secretary, who remained only at the head&nbsp;of the corps of gendarmes; but by a law of the 24th of September&nbsp;1904 this was again reversed, and the under-secretary was again&nbsp;placed at the head of all the police with the title of undersecretary for the administration of the police.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Local Elected Administrative Bodies.—</span><span class="font0">Alongside the local organs of the central government in Russia there are three&nbsp;classes of local elected bodies charged with administrative&nbsp;functions: (r) the peasant assemblies in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">mir</span><span class="font0"> and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">volost.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">zemstvos</span><span class="font0"> in the 34 governments of Russia proper,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the municipal </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">dumas.</span><span class="font0"> Of these the peasant assemblies are&nbsp;the most interesting and in some respects the most important,&nbsp;since the peasants </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(i.e.</span><span class="font0"> three-quarters of the population of&nbsp;Russia) form a class apart@@<sup>4</sup> largely excepted from <sub></sub>the incidence of the ordinary law, and governed in&nbsp;accordance with their local customs. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">mir</span><span class="font0"> itself, with its&nbsp;customs, is of immemorial antiquity (see Village Communities); it was not, however, till the emancipation of the&nbsp;serfs in 1861 that the village community was withdrawn from&nbsp;the patrimonial jurisdiction of the landowning nobility and&nbsp;endowed with self-government. The assembly of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">mir&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">consists of all the peasant householders of the village.@@<sup>5</sup> These&nbsp;elect a head-man </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(starosta)</span><span class="font0"> and a collector of taxes, who was&nbsp;responsible, at least until the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ukaz</span><span class="font0"> of October 1906, which&nbsp;abolished communal responsibility for the payment of taxes,&nbsp;for the repartition among individuals of the taxes imposed on the&nbsp;commune. A number of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">mirs</span><span class="font0"> are united into a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">volost,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">or canton, which has an assembly consisting of elected&nbsp;delegates from the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">mirs.</span><span class="font0"> These elect an elder </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(starshina)&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and, hitherto, a court of justice </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(volostnye sud).</span><span class="font0"> See </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Judicial&nbsp;System,</span><span class="font0"> below. The self-government of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">mirs</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">volosts</span><span class="font0"> is,&nbsp;however, tempered by the authority of the police commissaries&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(stanovoi)</span><span class="font0"> and by the power of general oversight given to the&nbsp;nominated “ district committees for the affairs of the peasants?’</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The system of local self-government is continued, so far as the 34 governments of old Russia are concerned,@@<sup>6 </sup>in the&nbsp;elective district and provincial assemblies </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(zemstvos).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">These bodies, one for each district and another for each province or government, were created by Alexander II. in 1864. They consist of a representative council&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(zemskoye sobranye)</span><span class="font0"> and of an executive board </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(zemskaya uprava)&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">nominated by the former. The board consists of five classes&nbsp;of members: (1) large landed proprietors (nobles owning 590&nbsp;acres and over), who sit in person; (2) delegates of the small&nbsp;landowners, including the clergy in their capacity of landed&nbsp;proprietors; (3) delegates of ^the wealthier townsmen; (4)&nbsp;delegates of the less wealthy urban classes; (5) delegates of&nbsp;the peasants, elected by the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">volosts.@@<sup>7</sup> </span><span class="font0">The rules governing&nbsp;elections to the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">zemstvos</span><span class="font0"> were taken as a model for the electoral&nbsp;law of 1906 and are sufficiently indicated by the account of this&nbsp;given below. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">zemstvos</span><span class="font0"> were originally given large powers&nbsp;in relation to the incidence of taxation, and such questions as&nbsp;education, public health, roads and the like. These powers&nbsp;were, however, severely restricted by the emperor Alexander&nbsp;III. (law of 12/25 June 1S90), the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">zemstvos</span><span class="font0"> being absolutely&nbsp;subordinated to the governors, whose consent was necessary&nbsp;to the validity of all their decisions, and who received drastic&nbsp;powers of discipline over the members.@@<sup>8</sup> It was not till 1905&nbsp;that the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">zemstvos</span><span class="font0"> regained, at least </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">de facto,</span><span class="font0"> some of their independent initiative. The part played by the congress of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">zemstvos&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">in the earlier stages of the Russian revolution is outlined below .&nbsp;(see </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History:</span><span class="font0"> § 2. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Development of the Russian Constitution).</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@1 </sup>From Catherine II ?s time to that of Alexander II. they were elected by, the nobles. This was changed in consequence of the&nbsp;emancipation of the serfs.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@4 </sup>Until the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ukaz</span><span class="font0"> of October 18, 1906, the peasant class was stereotyped under the electoral law. No peasant, however rich, could qualify for a vote in any but the peasants’ electoral colleges.&nbsp;The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ukaz</span><span class="font0"> allowed peasants with the requisite qualifications to&nbsp;vote as landowners. At the same time the Senate interpreted the&nbsp;law so as to exclude all but heads of families actually engaged in&nbsp;farming from the vote for the Duma.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@5 </sup>None but peasants—not even the noble-landowner—has a voice in the assembly of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">mir.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">@@@<sup>6</sup> Sixteen provinces have no </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">zemstvos, i.e.</span><span class="font0"> the three Baltic provinces, the nine western governments annexed from Poland by Catherine II., and the Cossack provinces of the Don, Astrakhan,&nbsp;Orenburg and Stavropol.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@7 </sup>By the law of the 12th (25th) of June 1890 the peasant members of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">zemstvos</span><span class="font0"> were to be nominated by the governor of the government or province from a list elected by the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">volosts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@8 </sup>In spite of these restrictions and of an electoral system which tended to make these assemblies as strait-laced and reactionary&nbsp;as any government bureau, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">zemstvos</span><span class="font0"> did good work, notably&nbsp;educational, in those provinces where the proprietors were inspired&nbsp;with a more liberal spirit.
