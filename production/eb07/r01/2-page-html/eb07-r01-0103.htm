<p><span class="font0">The registration of births, and deaths, and marriages in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">France</span><span class="font0"> is conducted under the provisions of the: </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Code Civil</span><span class="font0"> of Napoleon. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">maire</span><span class="font0"> of each </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">commune,</span><span class="font0"> of which&nbsp;there are about 37,300 in France, is the registering officer&nbsp;charged with the duty of registering, in books provided for&nbsp;the purpose, all births, deaths, and marriages, occurring&nbsp;within his commune. Births and deaths are registered in&nbsp;duplicate, the former upon information, in the presence of&nbsp;two witnesses, and are signed in duplicate by the informant,&nbsp;the two witnesses, and the registering officer ; in the case&nbsp;of deaths, one of the witnesses may be also the informant.&nbsp;Marriages are registered in the presence of four witnesses,&nbsp;and signed by the parties, the witnesses, and the registering&nbsp;officer. The register of births records the year, day, hour,&nbsp;and place of birth ; the sex and name of the child ; the&nbsp;names, surnames, professions, and residences of parents,&nbsp;witnesses, and informant ; the date of registration, and the&nbsp;name and quality of the registering officer ; and must be&nbsp;signed by him, by the witnesses, and by the informant.&nbsp;When the child is illegitimate, the name of the father cannot be given except by the authority of the father himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The register of deaths records the year, day, hour, and place of death ; the name, surname, age, profession, and&nbsp;residence of the deceased person ; the names, surnames,&nbsp;ages, professions, and residences of the parents of the deceased, and of the witnesses ; and the name and surname&nbsp;of the husband or wife, if the deceased was married ; also&nbsp;the date of registration, and the name and quality of the&nbsp;registering officer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The register of marriages records the names, surnames, ages, professions, places of birth, and residences of the parties ; the names, surnames, professions, and residences of&nbsp;their respective parents, and of the four witnesses, with the&nbsp;relation in which they stand to the parties ; the consent of&nbsp;the parents ; whether the marriage has been opposed ; time&nbsp;and place of solemnization and registration ; and the name&nbsp;and quality of the registering officer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Registration of births is secured by a provision, which requires, under pain of fine and imprisonment, from the father of the child, or, in default of the father, from some person&nbsp;present and assisting at the birth, a declaration thereof,&nbsp;within three days afterwards, to the registering officer, to&nbsp;whom the child must also be shown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The registration of deaths is secured by a provision rendering it penal for a burial to take place without the registering officer having first seen the body and registered the death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The registers are closed at the end of every year, with formalities which preclude interpolation. Alphabetical indexes are annually formed in duplicate for each. One of the&nbsp;duplicate registers, with its index, remains in the commune to&nbsp;which it belongs ; the other is transmitted to the tribunal of&nbsp;the district, where it is examined and placed under the superintendence of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">procureur du roi,</span><span class="font0"> or the local officer of&nbsp;the c∙<sup>,</sup>awn. Abstracts are made by the registering officer of&nbsp;each commune, a copy of which is transmitted to the sub-prefevt, who from thence frames an abstract for his arrondissement, a copy of which he sends to the prefect ; he also&nbsp;from the abstracts of the arrondissement makes an abstract&nbsp;for his department ; and copies of such abstracts are sent&nbsp;by the prefects of departments to be deposited in a central&nbsp;office at Paris.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The system of registration observed in France was introduced into Belgium, Geneva, and the Rhenish provinces of Prussia when under the dominion of France, and is still&nbsp;retained in those countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In Austria, registers of births, deaths, and marriages are kept by each minister of the church for his parish, and&nbsp;also by the Jewish rabbin for those of their own persuasion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The register of births records the year, month, and day of birth ; the number of the house in which the birth occurred ; the name of the child and its sex, and whether it&nbsp;be born in wedlock or illegitimate; the names and surnames&nbsp;of the parents ; their religion ; and the names, and surnames,&nbsp;and condition of the sponsors. In the case of illegitimate&nbsp;children, the name of the father cannot be entered unless&nbsp;he acknowledges the paternity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The register of deaths records the year, month, and day of death ; the number of the house in which it occurred ;&nbsp;the name, religion, sex, and stated age of the deceased ;&nbsp;and, when the information of a physician or surgeon can&nbsp;be supplied, the name of the fatal disease. For this purpose medical men are required to inform the minister, in&nbsp;writing, of the cause of death of such patients as they have&nbsp;attended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The register of marriages records the year, month, and day of the marriage ; the place of solemnization ; the names&nbsp;and surnames of the parties ; their religion, age, and whether single or widowed ; and the names, and surnames, and&nbsp;condition of the witnesses.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
