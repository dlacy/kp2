<p><span class="font0">lineage from “ Hugh de Rozel/’ </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">alias <sup>li</sup></span><span class="font0"> Hugh Bertrand, lord of le Rozel/’ a companion of the Conqueror, padding their fiction&nbsp;with the pedigree of certain Russells who arc found holding&nbsp;Kingston Russell in Dorset as early as the reign of King John.&nbsp;But the first undoubted ancestor of the Bedford line is Ifenry&nbsp;Russell, a Weymouth merchant, returned as a burgess for that&nbsp;borough in four parliaments between 1425 and 1442. He may&nbsp;well have been the son of Stephen Russell, another Weymouth&nbsp;merchant, whose name is just before his in the list of those men&nbsp;of substance in Dorsetshire who, in 1434, under the act of&nbsp;parliament, were to be sworn not to maintain breakers of the&nbsp;peace. Stephen Russell, having served the office of bailiff of&nbsp;Weymouth, was returned as burgess to the parliament of 1395,&nbsp;and one William Russell was returned for King’s Melcombe in&nbsp;1340. Both Stephen and Henry were in the wine trade with&nbsp;Bordeaux, and in 1427 Henry Russell was deputy to the chief&nbsp;butler of England for the port of Melcombe. In 1442 a pardon&nbsp;under the privy seal significantly describes Henry Russell of&nbsp;Weymouth, merchant, as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">alias</span><span class="font0"> Henry Gascoign, gentleman,&nbsp;and it is therefore probable that the ducal house of Bedford&nbsp;springs from a family of Gascon wine-merchants settled in a&nbsp;port of Dorsetshire, a county remarkable for the number of such&nbsp;French settlers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Henry Russell of Weymouth made a firm footing upon the land by his marriage with Elizabeth Hering, one of the two&nbsp;daughters and co-heirs of John Hering of Chaldon Hering, a&nbsp;Dorsetshire squire of old family, heir of the Winterbournes of&nbsp;Winterbourne Clenston and of the Cernes of Draycot Cerne.&nbsp;John Russell, eldest son of this match, born before 1432, and&nbsp;returned to parliament for Weymouth in 1450, had his seat at&nbsp;Berwick in Swyre, he and his son and heir, James Russell,&nbsp;being buried in the parish church of Swyre.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Thus John Russell, son and heir of James, was bom in a family of squire’s rank, whose younger branches went on for&nbsp;many generations as merchants and shipowners at Weymouth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A happy accident is said to have brought him to court. The archduke Philip, son of the emperor Maximilian, was driven by&nbsp;heavy weather into Weymouth, whence Sir Thomas Trenchard&nbsp;had him escorted to the king at Windsor. According to tradition,&nbsp;John Russell, Trenchard’s young kinsman, was lately home from&nbsp;his travels with a knowledge of foreign tongues, those travels&nbsp;being probably made in the mercantile interests of his family.&nbsp;As travelling companion, or as a spy upon the strange guests,&nbsp;young Russell was sent with the archduke, who is said to have&nbsp;commended him to King Henry. Certain it is that on the&nbsp;accession of Henry VIII. John Russell advanced rapidly, serving the crown as soldier and as diplomatic agent. He fought&nbsp;well at Therouanne, saw the Field of Cloth of Gold and the&nbsp;French disaster at Pavia, lost an eye by an arrow at Morlaix.&nbsp;In 1523 he was knight-marshal of the king’s household. In&nbsp;1526 he married a rich widow, Anne, daughter and co-heir of&nbsp;Sir Guy Sapcotes by the co-heir of Sir Guy Wolston, a match&nbsp;which brought to the Russells the Buckinghamshire estate of&nbsp;Chenies, in whose chapel many generations of them lie buried.&nbsp;His peerage as Lord Russell of Chenies dated from 1539, and in&nbsp;the same year he had the Garter. Having held many high&nbsp;offices—lord high admiral, lord president of Devon, Cornwall,&nbsp;Dorset and Somerset, and lord privy seal—he was named by&nbsp;Henry VIII. as one of his executors. At the crowning of Edward&nbsp;VI. he was lord high steward, and after his defeat of the western&nbsp;rebels was raised, in 1550, to the earldom of Bedford. Queen&nbsp;Mary, like her brother, made him lord privy seal, although he is&nbsp;said to have favoured that Reformation which enriched him.&nbsp;He died in London in 1555, leaving to his son a vast estate of&nbsp;church lands and lands forfeited by less successful navigators&nbsp;of the troubled sea of Tudor politics. In the west he had the&nbsp;abbey lands of Tavistock, which give a marquess’s title to his&nbsp;descendants. In Cambridgeshire he had the abbatial estate&nbsp;of Thorney, in Bedfordshire the Cistercian house of Woburn,&nbsp;now the chief seat of the Russells. In London he had Covent&nbsp;Garden with the “ Long Acre.” Thus the future wealth of his&nbsp;house was secured by those “ immoderate grants ” which made :&nbsp;a text for Edmund Burke’s furious attack upon a duke of&nbsp;Bedford.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">He left an only son, Francis, second earl of Bedford, K.G. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(c.</span><span class="font0"> 1527-1585), who, being concerned in Wyatt’s plot, escaped&nbsp;to the Continent and joined those exiles at Geneva whose&nbsp;religious sympathies he shared. He returned in 1557, and&nbsp;was employed by Queen Mary before her death. Under Queen&nbsp;Elizabeth he governed Berwick, and was lord-lieutenant of&nbsp;the northern counties. Three of his four sons died before him,&nbsp;the third, killed in a border fray, being father of Edward, third&nbsp;earl of Bedford, who died without issue in 1627. The fourth&nbsp;son, William, created Lord Russell of Thornhaugh in 1603,&nbsp;was a soldier who fought fiercely before Zutphen beside his&nbsp;friend Sir Philip Sidney, whom he succeeded as governor of&nbsp;Flushing, and was from 1594 to 1597 lord-deputy of Ireland.&nbsp;He died in 1613, leaving an only son, Francis, who in 1627 succeeded his cousin as fourth earl of Bedford. This earl built the&nbsp;square of Covent Garden, and headed the “ undertakers ” who&nbsp;began the scheme for draining the great Fen Level. He opposed the king in the House of Lords, but might have played&nbsp;a part as mediator between the sovereign and the popular&nbsp;party who accepted his leadership had he not died suddenly&nbsp;of the smallpox in 1641 on the day of the king’s assent to&nbsp;the bill for Strafford’s attainder. William, the eldest surviving&nbsp;son, succeeded as fifth earl, Edward, the youngest son,, being&nbsp;father of Edward Russell (1653-1727), admiral of the fleet,&nbsp;who, having held the chief command in the victory of La Hogue,&nbsp;was created in 1697 earl of Orford. The fifth earl of Bedford,&nbsp;after fighting for the parliament at Edgehill and for the king&nbsp;at Newhury, surrendered to Essex and occupied himself with&nbsp;completing the drainage of the Bedford Level. He carried&nbsp;St Edward’s staff at the crowning of Charles II., but quitted&nbsp;political life after the execution of his son, Lord Russell, in&nbsp;1683. In 1694 he was created duke of Bedford and marquess&nbsp;of Tavistock, titles to which his grandson, Wrothesley Russell,&nbsp;succeeded in 1700. The “patriot” Lord Russell had added&nbsp;to the family estates by his marriage with Rachel, daughter&nbsp;and co-heir of Thomas Wrothesley, the fourth earl of Southampton, from whom she finally inherited the earl’s property&nbsp;in Bloomsbury, with Southampton House, afterwards called&nbsp;Bedford House. Her son, the second duke of Bedford, married&nbsp;the daughter of a rich citizen, John Howland of Streatham, a&nbsp;match strangely commemorated by the barony of Howland of&nbsp;Streatham, created for the bridegroom’s grandfather, the first&nbsp;duke, in 1605. The third duke, another Wrothesley Russell&nbsp;(1708-1732), died without issue, his brother John (1710-1771)&nbsp;succeeding him. This fourth duke, opposing Sir Robert Walpole, became, by reason of his rank and territorial importance,&nbsp;a recognized leader of the Whigs. In the duke of Devonshire’s&nbsp;administration he was lord-lieutenant of Ireland, and he served&nbsp;as lord high constable at the coronation in 1760. His son&nbsp;Francis, styled marquess of Tavistock, was killed in 1767 by&nbsp;a fall in the hunting field, and Lord Tavistock’s son Francis&nbsp;(1765-1802) became the fifth duke. This was the peer whom&nbsp;Burke, smarting from a criticism of his own pension, assailed&nbsp;as “ the Leviathan of the creatures of the crown,” enriched&nbsp;by grants that “ outraged economy and even staggered credibility.” He pulled down Bedford House, built by Inigo Jones,&nbsp;Russell Square and Tavistock Square rising on the site of its&nbsp;gardens and courts. Dying unmarried, he was succeeded by&nbsp;his brother John, the sixth duke (1766-1839), whose third son&nbsp;was the statesman created in 1861, Earl Russell of Kingston&nbsp;Russell, better known as Lord John Russell. Lord Odo Russell,&nbsp;a nephew of “ Lord John,” and ambassador at Berlin from&nbsp;1871 to his death in 1884, was created Lord Ampthill in 1881.&nbsp;Herbrand Arthur Russell (b. 1858), the eleventh duke and&nbsp;fifteenth earl, succeeded an elder brother in 1893.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(O.
