<p><span class="font0">are ſuppoſed to know the diſcharge of the river and its ſlope and other circumſtances before barring it with a&nbsp;dam ; and we know the height of the dam Η, and&nbsp;therefore the new velocity at A, or immediately above&nbsp;A, and conſequently the ſlope S. Therefore, drawing&nbsp;the horizontal lines DC, AG, it is plain that CB and&nbsp;CA will be the primary ſlope of the river, and the ſlope&nbsp;S correſponding to the velocity in the immediate neighbourhood of A, becauſe theſe verticals have the ſame&nbsp;horizontal diſtance DC. We have therefore CB : CA&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">= S : s very</span><span class="font0"> nearly, and S—</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">s : s—</span><span class="font0"> CB—CA : CA,</span></p>

<p><span class="font0"><sub>λ</sub> H.S.χ ſlope; therefore D A=~g—y~</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This is all that we can ſay with preciſion of this curve. Mr Buat examined what would reſult from&nbsp;ſuppoſing it an arch of a circle. In this caſe we ſhould&nbsp;&quot;have DA=DF, and AF very nearly equal to 2 AD :&nbsp;and as we can thus find AD, we get the whole length&nbsp;FIA of the ſwell, and alſo the diſtances of any part of&nbsp;the curve from the primitive ſurface FB of the river ;&nbsp;for theſe will be very nearly in the duplicate proportion&nbsp;of their diſtances from F. Thus ID will be 4 of AB,&nbsp;&amp;c. Therefore we ſhould obtain the depth I </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">cl</span><span class="font0"> of the&nbsp;ſtream in that place. Getting the depth of the ſtream,&nbsp;and knowing the diſcharge, we get the velocity, and&nbsp;can compare this with the Hope of the ſurface at 1.&nbsp;This ſhould be the ſlope of that part of the arch of the&nbsp;circle. Making this compariſon, he found theſe circumſtances to be incompatible. He found that the fec-* ion and ſwell at I, correſponding to an arch of a circle,&nbsp;gave a diſcharge nearly fith too great (they were as&nbsp;405216 to 492142). Therefore the curve is ſuch,&nbsp;that AD is greater than DF, and that it is more incur-vated at F than at A. He found, that making&nbsp;DA to DF as 10 to 9, and the curve FIA an arch oſ&nbsp;an ellipſe whoſe longer axis was vertical, would give a&nbsp;very nice correſpondence of the ſections, velocities, and&nbsp;ſlopes. The whole extent of the ſwell therefore can&nbsp;never be double of AD, and muſt always greatly ſur-paſs AD ; and theſe limits will do very well for every&nbsp;practical queſtion. Therefore making DF <sub>τ</sub>⅜ of AD,&nbsp;and drawing the chord AD, and making DI fi- of D r,&nbsp;we ſhall be very near the truth. Then we get the ſwell&nbsp;with ſufficient preciſion for any point H between F and&nbsp;D, by making FD<sup>2</sup> : FH<sup>i</sup> — ID : H </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">h ;</span><span class="font0"> and if H is&nbsp;between D and A, we get its diſtance from the tangent DA by a ſimilar proceſs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It only remains to determine the ſwell produced in the waters of a river by the erection of a bridge or&nbsp;cleaning ſluice which contracts the paſſage. This requires the ſolution of</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Prob. V. Given the depth, breadth, and ſlope of a river, to determine the ſwell occaſioned by the piers of&nbsp;a bridge or ſides of a cleaning ſluice, which contract&nbsp;the paſſage by a given quantity, for a given length of&nbsp;channel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This ſwell depends on two circumſtances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole river muſt paſs through a narrow&nbsp;ſpace, with a velocity proportionably increaſed ; and&nbsp;this requires a certain head of water above the bridge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The water, in paſſing the length of the piers with&nbsp;a velocity greater than that correſponding to the primary ſlope of the river, will require a greater ſlope in&nbsp;order to acquire this velocity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Let V be the velocity of the river before the erection of the bridge, and K the quotient of the width of the river divided by the ſum of the widths between the&nbsp;piers. If the length of the piers, or their dimenſion in&nbsp;the direction of the ſtream, is not very great, KV will&nbsp;nearly expreſs the velocity of the river under the arches;&nbsp;and if we ſuppoſe for a moment the contraction (in the&nbsp;ſenſe hitherto uſed) to be nothing, the height produ-</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">These are the chief queſtions or problems on this ſubject which occur in the practice of an engineer; and&nbsp;the ſolutions which we have given may in every caſe be&nbsp;depended on as very near the truth, and we are confident that the errors will never amount to one-fifth of&nbsp;the whole quantity. We are equally certain, that of&nbsp;thoſe who call themſelves engineers, and who, without&nbsp;heſitation, undertake jobs of enormous expence, not&nbsp;one in ten is able even to gueſs at the reſult of ſuch&nbsp;operations, unleſs the circumſtances of the caſe happen&nbsp;to coincide with thoſe of ſome other project which he&nbsp;has executed, or has diſtinctly examined ; and very few&nbsp;have the ſagacity and penetration neceſſary for appreciating the effects of the diſtinguiſhing circumſtances&nbsp;which yet remain. The ſociety eſtabliſhed for the encouragement of arts and manufactures could ſcarcely do&nbsp;a more important ſervice to the public in the line of&nbsp;their inſtitution, than by publiſhing in their Tranſac-tions a deſcription of every work of this kind executed&nbsp;in the kingdom, with an account of its performance.&nbsp;This would be a moſt valuable collection of experiments&nbsp;and facts.
