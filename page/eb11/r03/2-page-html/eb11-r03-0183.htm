<p><span class="font1">form part of the “ affair of the diamond necklace.” This story is disentangled elsewhere (see </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Diamond Necklace),</span><span class="font1"> and&nbsp;diverging views are still taken of it. Rohan certainly was led&nbsp;to believe that his attentions to the queen were welcomed, and&nbsp;that his arrangement by which she received the famous necklace&nbsp;was approved. He was the dupe of others, and at the trial&nbsp;in 1786 before the parlement his acquittal was received with&nbsp;universal enthusiasm, and regarded as a victory over the court&nbsp;and the unpopular queen. He was deprived, however, of his&nbsp;office as grand almoner and exiled to his abbey of Chaise-Dieu.&nbsp;He was soon allowed to return to Strassburg, and his popularity&nbsp;was shown by his election in 1789 to the states-general by the&nbsp;clergy of the bailliages of Haguenau and Weissenburg. He at&nbsp;first declined to sit, but the states-general, when it became the&nbsp;national assembly, insisted on validating his election. But as&nbsp;a prince of the church in January 1791 he refused to take the&nbsp;oath to the constitution, and went to Ettenheim, in the German&nbsp;part of his diocese. In exile his character improved, and he&nbsp;spent what wealth remained to him in providing for the poor&nbsp;clergy of his diocese who had been obliged to leave France;&nbsp;and in 1801 he resigned his nominal rank as archbishop of&nbsp;Strassburg. Onthe 17th of February 1803 he died at Ettenheim.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">ROHILKHAND, a tract in the United Provinces of India. The name is associated with the RohilIa tribe (g.v.), but in its&nbsp;historical significance it covers an area almost coincident with&nbsp;the modern division of Bareilly, for which it is a common&nbsp;alternative title. This division has an area of 10,720 sq. m.,&nbsp;and comprises the districts of Bareilly, Bijnor, Budaun, Mora-dabad, Shahjahanpur and Pilibhit. Pop. (1901) 5,479,688.&nbsp;Political control over the state of Rampur is exercised by the&nbsp;commissioner for the division.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROHILLA (a Pushtu word for “ mountaineer ”), a tribe of Afghan marauders, who, towards the beginning of the 18th&nbsp;century, conquered a district of Hindostan, giving it the name&nbsp;of Rohilkhand, which still survives as an alternative title of&nbsp;the Bareilly division of the United Provinces. The Rohillas&nbsp;are chiefly notable for their association with Warren Hastings,&nbsp;which formed one of the main counts in his impeachment.&nbsp;Having been driven into the mountains by the Mahrattas, they&nbsp;had appealed for aid to Shuja-ud-Dowlah, wazir of Oudh, and&nbsp;ally of the British. The wazir promised to assist them in&nbsp;return for a sum of money; but when the Mahrattas were&nbsp;driven off the Rohilla chiefs refused to pay. The wazir then&nbsp;decided to annex their country, and appealed to Hastings for&nbsp;assistance, which was given in return for a sum of forty lakhs&nbsp;of rupees. Hastings justified his action on the ground that the&nbsp;RohilIas were a danger to the British as uncovering the flank&nbsp;of Oudh; and while he would never involve the company&nbsp;in an unjust war, neither did he desire an unprofitable&nbsp;one. The Rohillas were defeated by Colonel Champion in&nbsp;April 1774, and the majority of them fled across the Ganges;&nbsp;but the charges of destroying a nation, brought against Hastings&nbsp;by Burke and Macaulay, were greatly exaggerated. The&nbsp;Rohillas were never a nation, but consisted of a small body of&nbsp;Mahommedans, who had imposed an alien rule upon a million&nbsp;Hindus; and one of their chiefs was left in possession of a tract&nbsp;which now forms the state of Rampur (g.t?.).</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">ROHLFS, FRIEDRICH GERHARD (1831-1896), German explorer of the Sahara, son of a physician, was born at Vegesack, near Bremen, on the 14th of April 1831. After the&nbsp;ordinary course at the gymnasium of Osnabrück he entered&nbsp;the Bremen corps in 1848, and took part as a volunteer in&nbsp;the Schleswig-Holstein campaign, being made an officer after&nbsp;the battle of Idstedt (July 1850). He became a medical student&nbsp;at the universities of Heidelberg, Wurzburg and then Gottingen; but his natural inclination was for travelling, and in&nbsp;1855 he went to Algeria and enlisted in the Foreign Legion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">He took part in the conquest of Kabylia, and was decorated for bravery as Chevalier of the Legion of Honour. Having made&nbsp;himself master of Arabic and gained a thorough knowledge of&nbsp;native customs, Rohlfs went to Morocco in 1861; presenting&nbsp;himself as a Mussulman, he gained the favour of the enlightened&nbsp;sherif of Wazzan, and was thus enabled to travel over the&nbsp;length and breadth of the country. He then entered the&nbsp;Sahara and traversed the entire extent of the Wad Draa,&nbsp;being the second European (the first being René Caillié) to&nbsp;visit Tafilet. On leaving Tafilct he was robbed by his guides&nbsp;and left for dead; but two marabouts charitably succoured&nbsp;him and he was able to reach Algeria. When scarcely recovered from his wounds he started once more for the Sahara&nbsp;(August 1862) by way of Algeria. Compelled by tribal disturbances to turn back, he went to Tangier and thence in&nbsp;March 1864 made a fresh start. Crossing the Atlas by an&nbsp;eastern route he again visited Tafilct, and thence made his&nbsp;way across the desert to the oasis of Tuat, which he was the&nbsp;first European to describe. Returning by Ghadamcs and Tripoli&nbsp;he spent three months in Germany, and then (March 1865)&nbsp;went back to Tripoli, intending to explore the highlands of&nbsp;the Ahaggar; being prevented, however, by a war among the&nbsp;Tuareg, he went from Ghadames to Murzuk, where he spent&nbsp;five months, and thence across the Sahara to Bornu, mapping&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">en route</span><span class="font1"> the oasis of ELawar. Rohlfs passed through AIandara&nbsp;and its ancient capital Mora, and struck out for the coast of&nbsp;the Gulf of Guinea. He reached the Benue by way of the&nbsp;Bauchi highlands, and descended that river·to its confluence&nbsp;with the Niger, which he ascended to Rabba. Thence he made&nbsp;his way on horseback to Lagos, reaching Liverpool on the&nbsp;2nd of July 1867. In the following year he accompanied&nbsp;the British expedition against Theodore of Abyssinia, and on&nbsp;his return went once more to Tripoli, whence he traversed&nbsp;the Cyrenaica, reaching Egypt by way of the oasis of Siwa&nbsp;(1869). Returning home, he married and settled down in Weimar.&nbsp;He dLid not rest long, however, for in 1873-74 he took command&nbsp;of an expedition sent by the Khedive Ismail into the Libyan&nbsp;Desert, which made investigations of great value to science.&nbsp;In 1878 Rohlfs and Dr Stecker were commissioned by the&nbsp;German African Society to go to Wadal. They succeeded&nbsp;in reaching the oasis of Kufra, one of the chief centres of the&nbsp;Senussites, but being attacked by the Arabs, they were obliged&nbsp;to retreat, making their way to the coast at Benghazi, reached&nbsp;in October 1879. In 1880 Rohlfs accompanied Dr Steckcr&nbsp;in an exploring expedition to Abyssinia; but after delivering&nbsp;a letter from the German emperor to the Negus, he returned&nbsp;to Europe. In 1885, when the rivalry between the British&nbsp;and Germans in East Africa was very keen, Prince Bismarck&nbsp;appointed Rohlfs consul at Zanzibar, which island Bismarck&nbsp;desired to secure for Germany. Rohlfs, untrained in diplomacy,&nbsp;was no match for Sir John Kirk, the British Agent, and he was&nbsp;soon recalled, and did not again visit Africa. He died at&nbsp;Rüngsdorf, near Bonn, on the 2nd of June 1896. Rohlfs&nbsp;visited many regions not before traversed by Europeans, and&nbsp;the value of his work was recognized in 1868 by the Royal&nbsp;Geographical Society, which bestowed on him the Patron’s&nbsp;Medal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Accounts of each of his expeditions, and other works on Africa were published by Rohlfs, including </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Mein Erster Aufenthalt in&nbsp;Marokko</span><span class="font2"> (Bremen, 1873; English edition, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Travels in Morocco,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">London, 1874); </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Reise durch Marokko</span><span class="font2"> (Bremen, 1868); Qucr&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">durch Afrika</span><span class="font2"> (Leipzig, 1874-75); </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Von Tripolis nach Alexandrien&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">(Bremen, 1871); </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Expedition zur Erforschung der Libyschen Wüste&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">(Cassel, 1875-76); </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Kufra: Reise von Tripolis nach der Oase&nbsp;Kufra</span><span class="font2"> (Leipzig, 1881); </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Land und Volk in Afrika</span><span class="font2"> (Bremen, 1870);&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Quid novi ex Africa?</span><span class="font2"> (Cassel, 1886).
