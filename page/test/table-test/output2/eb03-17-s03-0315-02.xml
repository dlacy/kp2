in law, is a duty which a tenant, on account of his fee, owes to his lord.</p><p>There are many diviſions of ſervices ; as, 1. Into perſonal, where ſomething is to be done by the tenant in perſon, as homage and fealty. 2. Real, ſuch as wards, marriages, &amp; c. 3. Accidental, including heriots, reliefs, and the like. 4. Entire, where, on the</p><p>alienation of any part of the lands by a tenant, the ſervices become multiplied. 5. Frank ſervice, which was performed by freemen, who were not obliged to perform any baſe ſervice, but only to find a man and horſe to attend the lord into the army or to court. <hi rend="italic">6.</hi> Knight’s ſervice, by which lands were anciently held of the king, on paying homage, ſervice in war, &amp; c.</p><p>As in every free and well regulated ſociety there muſt be a diverſity of ranks, there muſt be a great number of perſons employed in ſervice, both in agriculture and domeſtic affairs. In this country, ſervice is a contract into which the servant voluntarily enters ; and the mailer’s authority extends no farther than to the performance of that species of labour for which the agreement was made.</p><p>“ The treatment of servants (ſays that reſpectable moraliſt Mr Paley), as to diet, diſcipline, and accommodation, the kind and quantity of work to be required of them, the intermiſſion, liberty, and indulgence to be allowed them, muſt be determined in a great meaſure by cuſtom ; for where the contract involves ſo many particulars, the contracting parties expreſs a few perhaps of the principal, and by mutual underſtanding refer the reſt to the known cuſtom of the country in like cases.</p><p>“ A servant is not bound to obey the unlawful commands of his matter ; to miniſter, for inſtance, to his unlawful pleaſures ; or to aſſiſt him in unlawful practices in his profeſſion ; as in ſmuggling or adulterating the articles which he deals in. For the servant is bound by nothing but his own promiſe ; and the obligation of a promiſe extends not to things unlawful.</p><p>“ For the ſame reaſon, the maſter’s authority does not juſtify the servant in doing wrong; for the ſervant’s own promiſe, upon which that authority is founded, would be none.</p><p>“ Clerks and apprentices ought to be employed entirely in the profeſſion or trade which they are intended to learn. Inſtruction is their wages ; and to deprive them of the opportunities of inſtruction, by taking up their time with occupations foreign to their buſineſs, is to defraud them of their wages.</p><p>“ The maſter is reſponſible for what a servant does in the ordinary courſe of his employment ; for it is done under a general authority committed to him, which is in juſtice equivalent to a ſpecific direction. Thus, if 1. pay money to a banker’s clerk, the banker is accountable : but not if I had paid it to his butler or his footman, whoſe buſineſs it is not to receive money. Upon the ſame principle, if I once send a fervant to take up goods upon credit, whatever goods he afterwards takes up at the ſame ſhop, ſo long as he continues in my ſervice, are juſtly chargeable to my account.</p><p>“ The law of this country goes great lengths in intending a kind of concurrence in the maſter, ſo as to charge him with the conſequences of his ſervant’s conduct. If an innkeeper’s servant rob his gueſts, the innkeeper muſt make reſtitution ; if a farrier’s servant lame your horſe, the farrier muſt anſwer for the damage ; and ſtill farther, if your coachman or carter drive over a paſſenger in the road, the paſſenger may recover from you a ſatisfaction for the hurt he ſuffers. But theſe determinations stand, I think, rather upon the authority of the law, than any principle of natural juſtice.”</p><p>There is a grievance which has long and juſtly<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0322.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0316"/>
been complained of, the giving of good characters to bad ſervants. This is perhaps owing to careleſſneſs, to a deſire of getting rid of a bad servant, or to miſtaken compaſſion. But ſuch careleſſneſs is inexcuſable. When a man gives his sanction to the character of a bad servant, he ought to reflect on the nature and conſequences of what he is doing. He is giving his name to a falſehood ; he is deceiving the honeſt man who confides in his veracity ; and he is deliberately giving a knave an opportunity of cheating an honeſt man. To endeavour to get quit of a bad servant in this way, is ſurely not leſs criminal than concealing the faults and diſadvantages of an eſtate which is advertiſed for sale, and aſcribing to it advantages which it does not poſſeſs. In this case, we know the sale would be reduced, and the advertiſer diſgraced. Many masters give characters to ſervants out of compaſſion ; but it is to this miſtaken compaſſion that the diſorderly behaviour of ſervants is perhaps principally owing : for if the puniſhment of dishoneſty be only a change of place (which may be a reward inſtead of a puniſhment), it ceaſes to be a ſervant’s intereſt to be true to his truſt.</p><p>We have said above that a maſter’s authority over his servant extends no farther than the terms of contract; by which we meant, that a maſter could give no unreaſonable orders to his servant, or ſuch as was inconſiſtent with the terms of contract. But the relation between a maſter and servant is certainly cloſer than the mere terms of a contract : it is a moral as well as a legal relation. A maſter of a family ought to ſuperintend the morals of his ſervants, and to reſtrain them from vices. This he may do by his example, by his influence, and authority. Indeed every man poſſeſſed of authority is guilty of criminal negligence if he does not exert his authority for promoting virtue in his inferiors; and no authority is ſo well adapted for this purpoſe as that of mailers of families, becauſe none operates with an influence ſo immediate and conſtant. It is wonderful how much good a nobleman or gentleman of fortune can do to his domestics by attending to their morals ; and every maſter may be a bleſſing to individuals and to ſociety, by exerting prudently that influence which his ſituation gives him over the conduct of his servant.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Choral</hi> <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Service,</hi> in church-hiſtory, denotes that part of religious worſhip which conſiſts in chanting and singing. The advocates for the high antiquity of ſinging, as a part of church-muſic, urge the authority of St Paul in its favour (Ephes. chap. v. ver. 19. and Co- loſ. chap. iii. ver. 16). On the authority of which paſſages it is aſſerted, that ſongs and hymns were, from the eſtabliſhment of the church, ſung in the aſſemblies of the faithful ; and it appears from undoubted teſtimony, that ſinging, which was practiſed as a sacred rite among the Egyptians and Hebrews, at a very early period, and which likewiſe conſtituted a conſiderable part of the religious ceremonies of the Greeks and Romans, made a part of the religious worſhip of Chriſtians, not only before churches were built, and their religion eſtabliſhed by law, but from the firſt profeſſion of Chriſtianity. However, the era from whence others have dated the introduction of muſic into the ſervice of the church, is that period during which Leontius governed the church of Antioch, <hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi> between the year of Chriſt 347 and 356.</p><p>From Antioch the practice ſoon ſpread through the other churches of the Eaſt ; and in a few ages after its firſt introduction into the divine ſervice, it not only received the fonction of public authority, but thoſe were forbid to join in it who were ignorant of muſic. A canon to this purpoſe was made by the council of Laodicea, which was held about the year 372 ; and Zonanas informs us, that theſe canonical lingers were reckoned a part of the clergy. Singing was introduced into the weſtern churches by St Ambroſe about the year 374, who was the inſtitutor of the Ambroſian chant eſtabliſhed at Milan about the year 386 ; and Euſebius (lib. ii. cap. 1 7.) tells us, that a regular choir, and method of ſinging the ſervice, were firſt eſtabliſhed, and hymns uſed, in the church at Antioch during the reign of Conſtantine, and that St Ambroſe, who had long reſided there, had his melodies thence. This was about 230 years afterwards amended by pope Gregory the Great, who eſtabliſhed the Gregorian chant ; a plain, uniſonous kind of melody, which he thought conſistent with the gravity and dignity of the ſervice to which it was to be applied. This prevails in the Roman church even at this day : it is known in Italy by the name of <hi rend="italic">canto fermo ;</hi> in France by that of <hi rend="italic">Blain chant ;</hi> and in Germany and most other countries by that of the <hi rend="italic">cantus Gregοrianus.</hi> Although no satisſactory account has been given of the ſpecific difference between the Ambroſian and Gregorian chants, yet all writers on this ſubject agree in saying, that St Ambroſe only uſed the four authentic modes, and that the four plagal were afterwards added by St Gregory. Each of theſe had the same final, or key-note, as its relative authentic ; from which there is no other difference, than that the melodies in the four authentic or principal modes are generally confined within the compaſs of the eight notes above the key-note, and thoſe in the four plagal or relative modes, within the compaſs of the eight notes below the fifth of the key. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Mobe.</hi></p><p>Eccleſiaſtical writers ſeem unanimous in allowing that Pope Gregory, who began his pontificate in 590, collected the muſical fragments of such ancient psalms and hymns as the firſt fathers of the church had approved and recommended to the firſt Chriſtians ; and that he ſelected, methodized, and arranged them in the order which was long continued at Rome, and ſoon adopted by the chief part of the weſtern church. Gregory is alſo said to have banished from the church the <hi rend="italic">canto figurato,</hi> as too light and diſſolute ; and it is added, that his own chant was called <hi rend="italic">canto ſermo,</hi> from its gravity and ſimplicity.</p><p>It has been long a received opinion, that the eccleſiaſtical tones were taken from the reformed modes of Ptolemy ; but Dr Burney obſerves, that it is difficult to diſcover any connection between them, except in their names ; for their number, upon examination, is not the same ; thoſe of Ptolemy being ſeven, the eccleſiaſtical eight ; and indeed the Greek names given to the eccleſiaſtical modes do not agree with thoſe of Ptolemy in the single inſtance of key, but with thoſe of higher antiquity. From the time of Gregory to that of Guido, there was no other diſtinction of keys than that of authentic and plagal ; nor were any ſemitones uſed but thoſe from E to F, B to C, and occaſionally A to Bb.</p><p>With reſpect to the muſic of the primitive church, it<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0323.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0317"/>
may be obſerved, that though it conſiſted in the ſinging of pſalms and hymns, yet it was performed in many different ways ; ſometimes the pſalms were ſung by one perſon alone, whilſt the reſt attended in ſilence ; ſometimes they were ſung by the whole aſſembly ; ſometimes alternately, the congregation being divided into ſeparate choirs ; and ſometimes by one perſon, who repeated the firſt part of the verſe, the reſt joining in the close ot it. Of the four different methods of ſinging now recited, the ſecond and third were properly diſtinguiſhed by the names of <hi rend="italic">ſymphony</hi> and <hi rend="italic">antiphony ;</hi> and the latter was ſometimes called <hi rend="italic">responsaria,</hi> in which women were allowed to join. St Ignatius, who, according to Socrates (lib. vi. cap. 8.j, conversed with the apoſtles, is generally ſuppoſed to have been the firſt who ſuggeſted to the primitive Chriſtians in the Eaſt the method of ſinging hymns and pſalms alternately, or in dialogue ; and the custom ſoon prevailed in every place where Chriſtianity was eſtabliſhed ; though Theodoret in his hiſtory lib. ii. cap. 24.) tells us, that this manner of ſinging was firſt practiſed at Antioch. It likewiſe appears, that almoſt from the time when muſic was firſt introduced into the ſervice of the church, it was of two kinds, and conſiſted in a gentle inflection of the voice, which they termed plain ſong, and a more elaborate and artificial kind of muſic, adapted to the hymns and ſolemn offices contained in its ritual ; and this diſtinction has been maintained even to the preſent day.</p><p>Although we find a very early diſtinction made between the manner of ſinging the hymns and chanting the pſalms, it is, however, the opinion of the learned Martini, that the muſic of the firſt five or fix ages of the church conſiſted chiefly in a plain and ſimple chant of umiſons and octaves, of which many fragments are ſtill remaining in the <hi rend="italic">canto fermo</hi> of the Romiſh miſſals. For with reſpect to muſic in parts, as it does not appear, in theſe early ages, that either the Greeks or Romans were in poſſeſſion of harmony or counterpoint, which has been generally aſcribed.to Guido, a monk of Arezzo in Tuscany, about the year 1022, though others have traced the origin of it to the eighth century, it is in vain to ſeek it in the church. The choral muſic, which had its riſe in the church of Antioch, and from thence ſpread through Greece, Italy, France, Spain, and Germany, was brought into Britain by the fingers who accompanied Auſtin the monk, when he came over, in the year 596, charged with a commiſſion to convert the inhabitants of this country to Chriſtianity. Bede tells us, that when Auſtin and the companions of his miſſion had their firſt audience of king Ethelbert, in the isle of Thanet, they approached him in procession, ſinging litanies; and that afterwards, when they entered the city of Canterbury, they ſung a litany, and at the end of it Allelujah. But though this was the firſt time the Anglo-Saxons had heard the Gregorian chant, yet Bede likewiſe tells us, that our Britiſh anceſtors had been inſtructed in the rites and ceremonies of the Gallican church by St Germanus, and heard him sing Allelujah many years before the arrival of St Auſtin. In 680, John, praecentor of St Peter’s in Rome, was ſent over by pope Agatho to inſtruct the monks of Weremouth in the art of ſinging; and he was prevailed upon to open ſchools for teaching muſic in other places in Northumberland. Benedict Biſcop, the preceptor of Bede, Adrian the monk, and many others, contributed to disseminate</p><p>the knowledge of the Roman chant. At length the ſucceſſors of St Gregory, and of Auſtin his miſſionary, having eſtabliſhed a school for eccleſiaſtical muſic at Canterbury, the reſt of the iſland was furniſhed with maſters from that ſeminary. The choral ſervice was firſt introduced in the cathedral church of Canterbury ; and till the arrival of Theodore, and his ſettlement in that see, the practice of it ſeems to have been confined to the churches of Kent ; but after that, it ſpread over the whole kingdom ; and we meet with records of very ample endowments for the ſupport of this part of public worſhip. This mode of religious worſhip prevailed in all the European churches till the time of the Reformation : the firſt deviation from it is that which followed the Reformation by Luther, who, being himſelf a lover of muſic, formed a liturgy, which was a muſical ſervice, contained in a work entitled <hi rend="italic">Psalmodia,</hi> h. e. <hi rend="italic">Cantica ſacra Veteris Ecclesiae selecta,</hi> printed at Norimberg in 1553, and at Wittemberg in 1561. But Calvin, in his eltabliſhment of a church at Geneva, reduced the whole of divine ſervice to prayer, preaching, and ſinging ; the latter of which he restrained. He excluded the offices of the antiphon, hymn, and motet, of the Romiſh service, with that artificial and elaborate muſic to which they were ſung ; and adopted only that plain metrical plalmody, which is now in general uſe among the reformed churches, and in the parochial churches of our own country. For this purpoſe he made uſe of Marot's verſion of the Pſalms, and employed a musician to ſet them to eaſy tunes only of one part. In 1553, he divided the Pſalms into pauſes or ſmall portions, and appointed them to be ſung in churches. Soon after they were bound up with the Geneva catechiſm ; from which time the Catholics, who had been accuſtomed to sing them, were forbid the uſe of them, under a ſevere penalty. Soon after the Reformation commenced in England, complaints were made by many of the dignified clergy and others of the intricacy and difficulty of the church-muſic of thoſe times : in conſequence of which it was once propoſed, that organs and curious ſinging ſhould be removed from our churches. Latimer, in his dioceſe of Worceſter, went ſtill ſarther, and issued injunctions to the prior and convent of St Mary, forbidding in their ſervice all manner of ſinging. In the reign of Edward VI. a commiſſion was granted to eight biſhops, eight divines, eight civilians, and eight common lawyers, to compile a body of ſuch eccleſiaſtical laws as ſhould in future be obſerved throughout the realm. The result of this compilation was a work firſt publiſhed by Fox the martyrologiſt, in 1571, and afterwards in 1640, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Reformatio Legum Ecclesiasticorum.</hi> Theſe 32 commiſſioners, inſtead of reprobating church- music, merely condemned figurative and operoſe muſic, or that kind of ſinging which abounded with fugues, reſponsive paſſages, and a commixture of various and intricate proportions ; which, whether extemporary or written, is by muſicians termed <hi rend="italic">descant,</hi> However, notwithſtanding the objections againſt choral muſic, and the practice of ſome of the reformed churches, the compilers of the Engliſh liturgy in 1548, and the king himself, determined to retain muſical ſervice. Accordingly the ſtatute 2 &amp;  3 Edw. VI. cap. 1. though it contains no formal obligation on the clergy, or others, to uſe or join in either vocal or inſtrumental muſic in the common prayer, does clearly recogniſe the practice of ſinging ;<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0324.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0318"/>
and in leſs than two years after the compiling of King Edward’s liturgy, a formula was compoſed, which continues, with ſcarce any variation, to be the rule for choral ſervice even at this day. The author of this work was John Marbecke, or Marbeike ; and it was printed by Richard Grafton, in 1550, under the title of the Book of Common Prayer, noted. Queen Mary laboured to re-eſtabliſh the Romiſh choral ſervice ; but the acceſſion of Elizabeth was followed by the act of uniformity ; in conſequence of which, and of the queen’s injunctions, the Book of Common Prayer, noted by Marbecke, was conſidered as the general formula of choral ſervice. In 1560, another muſical ſervice, with ſome additions and improvements, was printed by John Day; and in 1565 <hi rend="italic">,</hi> another collection of offices, with muſical notes. Many objections were urged by Cartwright and other Puritans againſt the form and manner of cathedral ſervice, to which Hooker replied in his Eccleſiaſtical Polity. In 1664, the ſtatutes of Edward VI. and Elizabeth, for uniformity in the Common Prayer, were repealed ; and the Directory for Public Worſhip, which allows only of the ſinging of pſalms, eſtabliſhed. But upon the reſtoration of Charles II. choral ſervice was again revived, and has ſince uniformly continued.
