                <p><label>SCHANDORPH [or Skamdrup], SOPHUS CHRISTIAN FREDERICK</label> (1836-1901),
                    Danish poet and novelist, was born at Ringsted in Zealand on the 8th of May
                    1836. In 1855 he entered the university of Copenhagen. In 1862 he published his
                    first volume of poetry, written in the romantic style and giving little
                    indication of the ultimate direction that his talent was to take. Other books
                    followed, but his gifts first found full expression in a volume of rustic tales
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Fra Provinsen</hi> (1876), in which he described
                    provincial character and life with much frankness of detail and a great deal of
                    wit. In 1878 his novel, <hi rend="italic">Uden Midtpunkt</hi> (“ Without a
                    Centre ”), recast later in dramatic form, attracted great attention by its
                    exposure of contemporary failings. Among the more famous of his later novels
                    are: <hi rend="italic">Thomas Friis' Historie</hi> (2 vols., 1881), <hi
                        rend="italic">Del gamle Apothek</hi> (“ The Old Apothecary ”) (1855) and <hi
                        rend="italic">Helga</hi> (1900); but his most characteristic work is to be
                    found in his various volumes of short sketches. He published his own <hi
                        rend="italic">Recollections</hi> (Oplevelser) in 1889. He died after a long
                    illness at Frederiksberg on New Year’s Day 1901.</p>
