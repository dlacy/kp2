a city in the papal dominions, in the delegation of Forli. It is situated at the mouth of the river Marechia, over which is a bridge said to have been built by Augustus. The city was once on the sea-shore, but the water having receded, the canal to the ancient harbour is now a part of a garden. It is surrounded with walls. It is the seat of a bishop ; and, besides the cathedral, it contains several churches, and many convents, in which are paintings of the highest repute. It likewise contains several fine palaces, a public library, a town-house, and a market-place, adorned with some fine statuary. Among the antiquities are an amphitheatre, and some triumphal arches. There is a Lombard and several charitable institutions. The inhabitants amount to 17,460. They partly live on their incomes, but some are employed in making leather, in the fisheries, and in preparing sulphur. Long. 12. 27. 31. E. Lat. 44. 3. 43. N.</p>
