or <hi rend="smallcaps">Spading,</hi> the operation of caſtrating the females of ſeveral kinds of animals, as ſows, bitches, &amp; c. to prevent any further conception, and promote their fattening. It is performed by cutting them in the mid flank, on the left side, with a ſharp knife or lancet, taking out the uterus, and cutting it off, and ſo ſtitching up the wound, anointing the part with tar, and keeping the animal warm for two or three days. The uſual way is to make the inciſion aslope, two inches and a half long ; that the fore-finger may be put in towards the back, to feel for the ovaries, which are two kernels as big as acorns on both sides of the uterus, one of which is drawn to the wound, and thus both taken out.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
