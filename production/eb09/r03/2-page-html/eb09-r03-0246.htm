<p><span class="font1">fabulous compared with the performances up to the end of the first half of the century. In all kinds of running the entire weight of the body is thrown on the toes,&nbsp;from which light strides are taken with all possible freedom of action from the hips. At starting the feet are&nbsp;placed about a foot apart, the body being inclined slightly&nbsp;forward, with the weight of it on the right or Iiindermost&nbsp;foot. A bent double position with the feet wide apart is&nbsp;on no account advisable. The start cannot be made too&nbsp;quickly on the signal being given. Two or three short steps&nbsp;are taken to get fairly into stride, after which the runner&nbsp;should look straight before him, set his eyes steadfastly on&nbsp;the goal, and run towards it at his longest and quickest&nbsp;stride, care being taken not to swerve or get out of stride.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Running is usually thus classified :—(1) sprinting includes all distances up to 400 yards ; (2) medium distances range from one&nbsp;quarter to three quarters of a mile ; (3) long distances are those&nbsp;of one mile and upwards. The first-named is the most popular,&nbsp;and is much practised in the north of England, especially at&nbsp;Sheffield, which may be termed the home of sprint running. It is&nbsp;less fatiguing than long distances and requires less arduous training,&nbsp;while strength to a certain extent replaces wind. A great point in&nbsp;sprinting is to obtain a good start, for which purpose incessant&nbsp;practice is required. A first-class sprinter when at full sp.eed will&nbsp;clear from 8 to 9 feet in each stride, and his toes leave the ground&nbsp;with inconceivable rapidity. When in good condition he will run&nbsp;100 yards at top speed in one breath, and probably 150 yards without drawing a second one. The quickest authenticated times in&nbsp;which short distances have been run on perfectly level ground&nbsp;are as follows :—120 yards, 11⅜ sec. ; 150 yards, 15 sec. ; 200 yards,&nbsp;19⅜ sec. ; 300 yards, 30 sec. ; and 400 yards, 43 j sec.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Of medium distances the quarter mile race is by far the most difficult to run, as a combination of speed and endurance is requisite. In fact a runner should be able to sprint the whole way. Six&nbsp;hundred yards and half a mile are the other chief distances in this&nbsp;class of running. The stride is slower than in sprinting, and a&nbsp;man cannot maintain the same speed throughout as is possible up&nbsp;to 300 yards. The best authenticated times are—quarter mile,&nbsp;48J <sup>sec</sup>∙ &gt; 600 yards, 1 min. 11⅜ sec. ; half mile, 1 min. 53⅛ sec. ;&nbsp;1000 yards, 2 min. 13 sec. ; three quarter mile, 3 min. 7 sec.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Light wiry men are best fitted for long-distance running, where stamina and wind are more useful than speed. The strides must&nbsp;be long and light. After some miles a runner is unable to keep&nbsp;the weight of the body on his toes any longer owing to fatigue,&nbsp;puts his heels down, and runs flat-footed. The times accomplished&nbsp;of late years by long-distance runners are most remarkable. Those&nbsp;for the chief distances are as follows :—1 mile, 4 min. 16⅜ sec. ;&nbsp;2 miles, 9 min. 11⅜ sec. ; 3 miles, 14 min. 36 sec. ; 4 miles, 19&nbsp;min. 36 sec. ; 5 miles, 24 min. 40 sec. ; 10 miles, 51 min. 6⅛ sec. ;&nbsp;20 miles, 1 h. 56 min. 38 sec. ; 30 miles, 3 h. 15 min. 9 sec. ;&nbsp;40 miles, 4 h. 34 min. 27 sec. ; 50 miles, 6 h. 8 min. ; 100 miles,&nbsp;13 h. 26 min. 30 sec. ; 200 miles, 35 h. 9 min. 28 sec. ; 300 miles,&nbsp;58 h. 17 min. 6 sec. ; 400 miles, 85 h. 52 min.; 500 miles, 109 h.&nbsp;18 min. 20 sec. ; 600 miles, 137 h. 25 min. 10 sec. ; 610 miles, 140 h.&nbsp;34 min. 10 sec.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Nearly all running contests now take place on prepared cinder paths, which from their springiness assist speed considerably. A&nbsp;runner’s dress should be as light as possible, and consist merely of&nbsp;a thin jersey, a pair of drawers covering the waist and loins and&nbsp;extending downwards to the top of the knee caps, and heelless running shoes with a few short spikes in the soles just under the tread&nbsp;of the foot. The spikes are longer for sprinting. Chamois leather&nbsp;socks for the toes and ball of the foot may be added, since they&nbsp;diminish concussion as each foot reaches the ground. Since the&nbsp;introduction of Athletic Sports (see vol. iii. p. 12) into England&nbsp;and America commenced in 1860 the popularity of amateur running races has vastly increased. These contests are governed by&nbsp;the rules of the Amateur Athletic Association. At Sheffield a&nbsp;code of rules has been drawn up for the regulation of the more&nbsp;important professional handicaps.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RUPERT (1619-1682), prince of Bavaria, the third son of Frederick V., elector palatine and king of Bohemia,&nbsp;and of Elizabeth, sister of Charles I. of England, was born&nbsp;at Prague on December 18, 1619. In 1630 he was placed&nbsp;at the university of Leyden, where he showed particular&nbsp;readiness in languages and in military discipline. In 1633&nbsp;he was with the prince of Orange at the siege of Rhyn-berg, and served against the Spaniards as a volunteer in&nbsp;the prince’s life-guard. In December 1635 he was at the&nbsp;English court, and was named as leader of the proposed&nbsp;expedition to Madagascar. In 1636 he visited Oxford,&nbsp;when he was made master of arts. Returning to The&nbsp;Hague in 1638, he made the first display of his reckless&nbsp;bravery at the siege of Breda, and shortly afterwards was&nbsp;taken prisoner by the Austrians in the battle before&nbsp;Lemgo. For three years he was confined at Linz, where&nbsp;he withstood the endeavours made to induce him to&nbsp;change his religion and to take service with the emperor.&nbsp;Upon his release in 1642 he returned to The Hague, and&nbsp;from thence went to Dover, but, the Civil War not having&nbsp;yet begun, he returned immediately to Holland. Charles&nbsp;now named Rupert general of the horse, and he joined&nbsp;the king at Leicester in August 1642, being present at&nbsp;the raising of the standard at Nottingham. He was also&nbsp;made a knight of the Garter. It is particularly to be&nbsp;noticed that he brought with him several military inventions, and, especially, introduced the “ German discipline ”&nbsp;in his cavalry operations. He at once displayed the most&nbsp;astonishing activity, fought his first action with success at&nbsp;Worcester in September, and was at Edgehill on October&nbsp;23. At Aylesbury and Windsor, on the march to&nbsp;London, he received severe checks, but after desperate&nbsp;fighting took Brentford. In 1643 he captured Cirencester, but failed before Gloucester, and in February&nbsp;issued his declaration denying the various charges of&nbsp;inhumanity which had been brought against him. At the&nbsp;end of March he set out from Oxford to join the queen at&nbsp;York, took Birmingham, and, after a desperate resistance,&nbsp;Lichfield, but was there suddenly recalled to the court at&nbsp;Oxford to meet Essex’s expected attack. Chalgrove fight,&nbsp;at which during one of his incessant raids he met Hampden,&nbsp;was fought on June 18. On July 11 he joined the queen&nbsp;at Stratford-on-Avon, and escorted her to the king at&nbsp;Edgehill. He then began the siege of Bristol, which he&nbsp;took on July 26, and he took part in the futile attempt&nbsp;on Gloucester, where he failed to repulse Essex’s relieving&nbsp;force. In the skirmish previous to the first battle of&nbsp;Newbury he checked the enemy’s advance, and in the&nbsp;battle itself displayed desperate courage, following up the&nbsp;day’s work by a night attack on the retiring army. In&nbsp;the beginning of 1644 he was rewarded by being made&nbsp;earl of Holderness, duke of Cumberland, and president&nbsp;of Wales. In February he was at Shrewsbury, from&nbsp;whence he administered the affairs of Wales ; in March&nbsp;he went to relieve Newark, and was back at Shrewsbury&nbsp;by the end of the month. He then marched north,&nbsp;relieving Lathom and taking Bolton, and finally relieving&nbsp;York in July. At Marston Moor he charged and routed&nbsp;the Scots, but was in turn completely beaten by Cromwell’s Ironsides. He escaped to York, and thence to&nbsp;Richmond, and finally by great skill reached Shrewsbury&nbsp;on July 20. On November 21 he was repulsed at Abingdon, and on 23d he entered Oxford with Charles. He had&nbsp;meanwhile been made generalissimo of the armies and&nbsp;master of the horse. Against him, however, was a large&nbsp;party of courtiers, with Digby at their head. The influence of the queen, too, was uniformly exerted against&nbsp;him. In May 1645 he took Newark by storm. His&nbsp;advice to march northwards was overruled, and on June&nbsp;14 the experiences of Marston Moor were repeated at</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
