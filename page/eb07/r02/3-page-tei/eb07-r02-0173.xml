His answer to Eudoxia was the speedy appearance of a Vandal fleet in the Tiber. The terror of the Roman citizens vented itself on Maximus, who was put to death in a tumult of popular indignation ; but Genseric landed and took possession of the city, which immediately became a scene of horrors, surpassing those caused by the storm and pillage of Alaric and his Goths. For the space of fourteen days and nights did the savage Vandals indulge their rapacious appetite for plunder, by seizing upon all the public and private wealth which had escaped the Goths, or been accumulated since their departure. Eudoxia herself was despoiled of her jewels, and compelled, along with her two daughters, to embark on board the vessels of the barbarous plunderer. Great numbers of the Roman citizens were carried away to Africa as slaves, the only mitigation of their sufferings being w hat was purchased from the Vandals by Deogratias, bishop of Carthage.</p><p>Before the death of Maximus, he had appointed a noble Gaul, named Avitus, to the command of the troops in that country. When the death of Maximus left the empire without a sovereign, the army proclaimed Avitus ; and the friendship of Theodoric, the king of the Visigoths, induced him the more readily to accept the dangerous honour. But he enjoyed his elevation a short time. Ricimer, commander of the barbarian mercenaries in the armies of the empire, descended of the royal race of the Visigoths by the mother’s side, and of the nation of the Suevi by the father’s, having defeated the Vandals in a naval action, and been hailed “ deliverer of Italy,” found himself strong enough on his return, to depose Avitus, who was allowed to become bishop of Placentia, but he did not live to enjoy his ecclesiastical preferment.</p><p>For a short time Ricimer continued to govern the empire without the appointment of an imperial ruler ; but at length he raised to that position Majorianus, a man of courage and merit, who had been trained under the care of Ætius, and was equally skilled in the arts of the field and the cabinet. His first attempt was to check the growing degeneracy of Rome, by amending the laws, making a new distribution and arrangement of the taxes, restoring and reforming the magistracies, preventing the destruction of public edifices, and especially by such a vigorous resumption of the ancient discipline of the armies, as should render them able to meet their enemies witll their former certainty of victory. He levied troops, repelled an invasion of the Vandals, constructed a fleet, and prepared to carry the war into Africa, for the recovery of that province, which had long been the very granary of Rome. But it was not the policy of Ricimer to allow a truly able and heroic monarch to occupy the imperial throne, lest he might rouse the Romans from their deep degeneracy. He fomented a sedition in the army, in consequence of which Majorianus was compelled to abdi-, cate ; and five days after his abdication he died, as was reported, of a dysentery, more probably of treachery. In him perished the hopes and the prospects of Rome, of ever again obtaining deliverance from the degradation of barba</p><p>rian sway.</p><p>At the command of Ricimer, the senate named as emperor Libius Severus, an obsequious dependant of the imperious barbarian, who continued to hold the nominal dignity of emperor for a period of six years, during which the whole power was so completely retained by Ricimer, that the name of Severus is scarcely ever mentioned by the historians ofthe time. At length the growing power of the Vandals in Africa, and their incessant depredations on the coast of Italy, compelled Ricimer, who had no naval force to oppose them, to apply for aid to the emperor of the east, and to offer him the appointment of a western emperor as an inducement. The opportune death of Severus enabled Ricimer to make this offer freely, if indeed he had not caused that death ; and Leo, the eastern sovereign, nominated Anthemius to that ill-omened station. A combined armament was prepared by the Constantinopoli-tan and Roman emperors, and sent against the Vandals ; but the superior conduct of Genseric prevailed, and the confederate force was almost totally destroyed. Bereft of his eastern support, Anthemius was unable to maintain himself against the powerful and ambitious Ricimer, who first withdrew from Rome to Milan, and there held a separate and independent court, and then marched toward Rome in open rehellion against the emperor. For some months Anthemius defended the city ; but at length it was carried by storm, and the unhappy emperor being dragged from concealment, was murdered by the command of Ricimer.</p><p>Anycius Olybrius, the son-in-law of Valentinian III. was next placed on the throne, by this daring and successful setter-up and puller-down of emperors. Within about a month after this exploit, Ricimer himself followed his imperial victims to the grave, being cut off by a painful disease ; and before other two months had elapsed, Olybrius died a natural though an early death.</p><p>Even ambition could not rouse the sluggish court of the east to activity, although the death of Ricimer rendered it probable that the nomination of a new emperor would meet with little opposition. At length Leo named to that dignity Julius Nepos, who had married a relation of the empress, and had previously held the government of Dalmatia. In the meantime, Gundobald, the Burgundian prince, and nephew of Ricimer, had raised to the throne an obscure soldier named Glycerius ; but upon the approach of Nepos, supported by the troops of Leo, Glycerius fled, the Burgundians not thinking proper to engage in a war for his defence, and he is said to have consulted his safety in the new character of bishop of Salona.</p><p>Nepos enjoyed the sovereignty but a very short time. The barbarian confederates, or auxiliary troops, broke out into a violent sedition, and marchcd, under the command of their general, Orestes, a native of Pannonia, of high descent, against Ravenna, where Nepos had his court. Instead of confiding in the strength of the fortress, and hazarding the contest, Nepos fled across the Adriatic to his former Dalmatian province, and lived in obscurity till he was murdered by the instigation of his former rival Glycerius.</p><p>Orestes did not himself think proper to assume the purple, but gave it to his son Romulus, or, as corrupted by the half-barbarian half-Greek pronunciation of Pannonia, Mo-myllus, to whom, as raised to the imperial dignity, was also given the name of Augustus, afterwards changed into Aug-ustulus ; in whom thus met, by a strange combination, the names of the founders of the city, and of the empire. But Orestes soon found that it was easier to usurp than to retain supreme power. The barbarian mercenaries, headed by Odoacer, a bold and enterprizing chief of the Heruli, demanded a partition of the lands of Italy among them, to at least a third ; and upon the refusal of Orestes, they flew to arms, mustering from all quarters, besieged and took Pavia into which Orestes had thrown himself, and put him to death. Odoacer next directed his march to Rome, and was met by Augustulus, who voluntarily abandoned the insignia of imperial sway, and appealed to the clemency ofthe conqueror. His life was spared, and he was allowed to retire to the villa which had belonged to Lucullus, where he was allowed a sum of money fbr his support. Odoacer retaining the entire sovereignty, contented himself with the title of king, and thus put an end to the Roman Empire of the West, in the 1229th year from the foundation of Rome.</p></body></text></TEI>
