<p><span class="font0">their guilt by hypocriſy, never pronouncing ſentence without a preamble full of gentleneſs and mercy. He&nbsp;was particularly terrible to the ſenate and nobility, the&nbsp;whole body of whom he frequently threatened entirely&nbsp;to extirpate. At one time, he ſurrounded the ſenate-houſe with his troops, to the great conſternation ol the&nbsp;ſenators. At another, he reſolved to amuſe himſelſ&nbsp;with their terrors in a different manner. Having invited them to a public entertainment, he received them&nbsp;all very formally at the entrance of his palace, and con&gt;&nbsp;ducted them into a ſpacious hall, hung round with black,&nbsp;and illuminated by a few melancholy lamps, that dif-fuſed light only ſufficient to ſhow the horrors of the&nbsp;place, All around were to be ſeen nothing but coffins, with&nbsp;the names of each of the ſenators written upon them, together with other objects of terror, and inſtruments&nbsp;of execution. While the company beheld all the preparations with ſilent agony, ſeveral men, having their&nbsp;bodies blackened, each with a drawn ſword in one hand&nbsp;and a flaming torch in the other, entered the hall, and&nbsp;danced round them. After ſome time, when the gueſts&nbsp;expected nothing leſs than inſtant death, well knowing&nbsp;Domitian’s capricious cruelty, the doors were ſet open,&nbsp;and one of the ſervants came to inform them, that the&nbsp;emperor gave all the company leave to withdraw.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Theſe cruelties were rendered ſtill more odious by his luſt and avarice. Frequently after preſiding at an&nbsp;execution, he would retire with the lewdeſt proſtitutes,&nbsp;and uſe the ſame baths which they did. His avarice,&nbsp;which was the conſequence of his profuſion, knew no&nbsp;bounds. He ſeized upon the eſtates of all againſt whom&nbsp;he could find the ſmalleſt pretenſions ; the moſt trifling&nbsp;action or word againſt the majeſty of the prince was&nbsp;ſufficient to ruin the poſſeſſor. He particularly exacted&nbsp;large ſums from the rich Jews ; who even then began to&nbsp;practiſe the art of peculation, for which they are at&nbsp;preſent ſo remarkable He was excited againſt them,&nbsp;not only by avarice, but by jealouſy. À prophecy&nbsp;had been long current in the eaſt, that a perſon from&nbsp;the line of David ſhould rule the world. Whereupon,&nbsp;this ſuſpicious tyrant, willing to evade the prediction,&nbsp;commanded all the Jews of the lineage of David to be&nbsp;diligently ſought out, and put to death. 'Γwo Chriſtians, grandſons of St Jude the apoſtle, of that line,&nbsp;were brought before him; but finding them poor, and&nbsp;uo way ambitious of temporal power, he diſmiſſed them,&nbsp;conſidering them as objects too mean for his jealouſy.&nbsp;However, his perſecution of the Chriſtians was more&nbsp;ſevere than that of any of his predeceſſors. By his&nbsp;letters and edicts they were baniſhed in ſeveral parts of&nbsp;the empire, and put to death with all the tortures of&nbsp;ingenious cruelty. The predictions of Chaldeans and&nbsp;aſtrologers alſo, concerning his death, gave him moſt&nbsp;violent apprehenſions, and kept him in the moſt tormenting diſquietude. As he approached towards the&nbsp;end of his reign, he would permit no criminal, or priſoner, to be brought into his preſence, till they were&nbsp;bound in ſuch a manner as to be incapable of injuring&nbsp;him ; and he generally ſecured their chains in his own&nbsp;hands. His jealouſies increaſed to that degree, that he&nbsp;ordered the gallery in which he walked to be ſet round&nbsp;with a pellucid ſtone, which ſerved as a mirror to reflect&nbsp;the perſons of all ſuch as approached him from behind.&nbsp;Every omen and prodigy gave him freſh anxiety.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But a period was ſoon to be put to this monſter’s</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">cruelty. Among the number of thoſe whom he at ouce careſſed and ſuſpected, was his wiſe Domitia, whom&nbsp;he had taken from Ælius Lama, her former huſhand.&nbsp;This woman, however, was become obnoxious to him,&nbsp;for having placed her affections upon one. Paris, a&nbsp;player ; and he reſolved lo diſpatch her, with ſeveral&nbsp;others that he either hated or ſuipected. It was the tyrant’s method to put down the names of all ſeich as lie&nbsp;intended to deſtroy in his tablets, which he kept about&nbsp;him with great circumſpection. Domitia, fortunately&nbsp;happening to get a fight of them, was ſtruck at finding&nbsp;her own name in the catalogue of thoſe fated to deſtruction. She ſhowed the fatal liſt to Norbanus· and Pe-tronius, præfects of the praetorian bands, who found,&nbsp;themſelves ſet down ; as likewiſe to Stephanus, the&nbsp;comptroller of the houſehold, who came into the conſpiracy with alacrity. Parthenius alſo, the chief chamberlain, was of the number. Theſe, after many con·&nbsp;ſultations, determined on the firſt opportunity to put&nbsp;their deſign in execution ; and at length fixed on the&nbsp;18th day of September for the completion of their attempt. Domitian, whoſe death was every day fore'&nbsp;told by the aſtrologers, who, of conſequence, muſt at&nbsp;laſt be right in their predictions, was in ſome meaſure&nbsp;apprehenſive σf that day ; and as he had been ever timorous, ſo he was now more particularly upon his&nbsp;guard. He had ſome time before ſecluded himſelf in&nbsp;the moſt ſecret receſſes of his palace ; and at midnight&nbsp;was ſo affrighted as to leap out of his bed, inquiring&nbsp;oſhis attendants what hour of the night it was. Upon&nbsp;their falſely aſſuring him that it was an hour later than&nbsp;that which he was taught to apprehend, quite tranſported, as if all danger was paſt, he prepared to go to&nbsp;the bath. Juſt then, Parthenius his chamberlain came&nbsp;to inform him that Stephanus the comptroller of his&nbsp;houſehold deſired to ſpeak to him upon an affair of the&nbsp;utmoſt importance. The emperor having given orders&nbsp;that his attendants ſhould retire, Stephanus entered&nbsp;with his hand in a ſcarf, which he had worn thus for&nbsp;ſome days, the better to conceal a dagger, as none were&nbsp;permitted to approach the emperor except unarmed.—&nbsp;He began by giving information of a pretended conſpiracy, and exhibited a paper in which the particulars&nbsp;were ſpeciſied. While Domitian was reading the contents with an eager curioſity, Stephanus drew his dagger, and ſtruck him in the groin. The wound not being mortal, Domitian caught hold of the aſſaſſin, and&nbsp;threw him upon the ground, calling out for aſſiſtance.&nbsp;He demanded alſo his ſword, that was uſually placed&nbsp;under his pillow ; and a boy who attended in the apartment running to fetch it, found only the ſcabbard, for&nbsp;Parthenius had previouſly removed the blade. The&nbsp;ſtruggle with Stephanus ſtill continued : Domitian ſtill&nbsp;kept him under, and at one time attempted to wreſt the&nbsp;dagger from his hand, at another to tear out his eyes&nbsp;with his fingers. But Parthenius, with his freedman,&nbsp;a gladiator, and two ſubaltern officers, now coming in,&nbsp;ran all furiouſly upon the emperor, and diſpatched him&nbsp;with many wounds. In the mean time, ſome of the&nbsp;officers of the guard being alarmed, came to his aſſiſtance, but too late to ſave him ; however, they flew&nbsp;Stephanus on the ſpot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When it was publicly known that Domitian was ſlain, the joy of the ſenate was ſo great, that being aſſembled with the utmoſt haſte, they began to load his</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
