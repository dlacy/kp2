The deputies of Mary remonſtrated, proteſted, and argued, to no purpoſe; the Engliſh privy-council, with the moſt provoking indifference, told them, that “the earl of Murray had promiſed to their ſovereign, for himſelf and his company, to return to England at any time ſhe ſhould call upon him. But, in the mean time, the queen of Scots could not, for many ſtrong reaſons, be ſuffered to take her departure out of England. As to her deputies, they would move Elizabeth to allow them to return to Scotland; and they believed that ſhe would not detain them.”</p><p>Mary was exceedingly diſappointed and chagrined by this ſingular iſſue of her cauſe. Her friends during this period had increaſed, and the cruel and injurious treatment ſhe had met with was ſo flagrant, that the earl of Murray and his faction were apprehenſive of a ſudden reverſe of fortune. The earls of Argyle and Huntley proteſted againſt the injuſtice of their proceedings, at the ſame time that they openly accuſed the earl of Murray and Maitland of Lethington as the aſſociates of Bothwel in the murder of the king. This charge, according to the cuſtom of the times, they offered to prove as true and certain by the law of arms; and they proteſted, that if their adverſaries ſhould delay to anſwer their challenge, they ſhould be held as confeſſing themſelves guilty of the murder. Elizabeth, however, foreſeeing ſomething of this kind, had diſmiſſed Murray and his adherents with precipitation, ſo that there could now be no formal production of it before the Engliſh commiſſioners. However, it was known and publiſhed in the court of Elizabeth. Murray made an evaſive reply, and Lethington made none at all.</p><p>This, however, afforded no relief to the unhappy queen of Scotland. Her inveterate and treacherous enemy held her faſt, and endeavoured by every method in her power to render her life miſerable. Mary, on thc other hand, never loſt either her ſpirit or her dignity. She attempted to rouſe in the minds of her nobles that paſſion for liberty which had once ſo much diſtinguiſhed the Scottiſh nation, but which now ſeemed to be exchanged for a ſervile ſubjection to the queen of England. But ſome diſpatches which preſſed theſe topics being intercepted, Mary was removed from Bolton to Tutbury caſtle, where ſhe was intruded to the earl of Shrewſbury, and committed to cloſer confinement than ſhe had yet experienced; while Elizabeth diſperſed manifeſtoes all over the northern counties of England, complaining of reports injurious to her honour, and diſclaiming all hoſtile intentions towards the liberties of Scotland.</p><p>In the mean time Murray returned to Scotland, where he took every method to eſtabliſh himſelf in his ill-acquired power. Mary had commanded the duke of Chatelherault to return to Scotland, in order  to raiſe forces for her behoof; but this nobleman had been long detained in England by the artifices of Elizabeth, ſo that Murray had arrived there before him. The duke, however, began to raiſe forces, and might have proved a troubleſome antagoniſt, had not Murray deceived him by a pretended negociation, and got him into his power; immediately after which he impriſoned him, and forced moſt of the other lords who were on that ſide to ſubmit.</p><p>When the news of this important event reached the queen of Scots, ſhe inſtructed the biſhop of Roſs to repair to Elizabeth, and to make remonſtrances in their behalf. By the agency of this eccleſiaſtic, whom ſhe had conſtſtuted her ambaſſador, ſhe meant to conduct her tranſactions with the queen of England; and from the concluſion of the conferences, ſhe had been meditating a proper plan upon which to accompliſh her liberty and reſtoration. The biſhop of Roſs, after complaining loudly of the rigorous proceedings of the regent, and intimating the general belief which prevailed that he was ſupported by the Engliſh court, preſſed the propriety of a final ſettlement of the affairs of his miſtreſs. With this view, he was admitted by Elizabeth and her privy-counſellors to frequent conferences; and they even deſired him to preſent to them in writing the articles which he was commanded to propoſe as the foundation of a treaty. He failed not to comply with this injunction; and it was the import of his ſchedule of agreement, that Mary ſhould engage never to moleſt Elizabeth, and the lawful heirs of her body, reflecting the ſucceſſion to the crown of England and Ireland, if ſhe could obtain ſufficient ſecurity that upon their demiſe her rights would be reſpected; that a new treaty of alliance and friendſhip ſhould be concluded between the two queens, by the advice of the eſtates of both kingdoms; that this league ſhould be ratified by their oaths and ſeals, and confirmed by parliamentary acts; and, if any farther aſſurance ſhould be deemed neceſſary on the part of Mary, that ſhe would procure the kings of France and Spain to be the guarantees of her punctuality and concord; that in compliance with the pleaſure of Elizabeth, ſhe would extend her clemency to all her ſubjects who had offended her, under the proviſion that they would ſubmit to her ſovereignty, deliver up the prince her ſon, reſtore her caſtles, give back her jewels, and ſurrender to her friends and ſervants the eſtates and poſſeſſions of which they had been deprived; that the murder of the king ſhould be puniſhed againſt all the actors in it without delay, and according to the laws; that, to prevent Bothwel from returning to Scotland, and to pleaſe thoſe who imagined that it was in his power to excite ferments and trouble, ſhe would be bound to inſtitute a proceſs of divorce againſt him; and that theſe articles being adjuſted, the queen of England ſhould allow her to proceed to Scotland, under a ſafe and honourable convoy, to be re-eſtabliſhed by the three eſtates in her realm and government, and to be gratified with the diſſolution of all the acts and ſtatutes which had been paſſed to her prejudice.</p><p>Theſe heads of alliance were received with a reſpect and cordiality which were not uſually paid to the transactions of Mary in the court of Elizabeth; and the biſhop of Roſs was elated with expectation. Their juſtice, however, was not the ſole, or even the chief, cauſe of this attention and complaiſance. A combination of the Engliſh nobles had taken place againſt Cecil, whoſe power and credit were objects of indignation and jealouſy; and the duke of Norfolk had been active and ſucceſsful in promoting the ſcheme of his marriage with the queen of Scots. Taking advantage of the condition of parties, he had practiſed with the principal nobility to encourage his pretenſions to Mary; and he ſecretly communicated to them the promiſes of</p></body></text></TEI>
