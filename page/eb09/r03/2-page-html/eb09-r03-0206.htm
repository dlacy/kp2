<p><span class="font1">The revolutionary movement of 1848 extended from the Roumans of Hungary and Transylvania to their kinsmen of the Transalpine&nbsp;regions. In Moldavia the agitation was mostly confined to the&nbsp;boiars, and the Iiospodar Michael Sturdza succeeded in arresting&nbsp;the ringleaders. In Walachia, however, the outbreak took a more&nbsp;violent form. The people assembled at Bucharest, and demanded&nbsp;a constitution. The prince Bibescu, after setting his signature to&nbsp;the constitution submitted to him, fled to Transylvania, and a&nbsp;provisional government was formed. The Turks, however, urged&nbsp;thereto by Russian diplomacy, crossed the Danube, and a joint&nbsp;Russo-Turkish dictatorship restored the “ Organic Law.” Bythe&nbsp;Balta-Liman convention of 1849 the two Governments agreed to the&nbsp;appointment of Barbu Stirbeiu as prince of Walachia, and Gregoriu&nbsp;Ghika for Moldavia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">On the entry of the Russian troops into the principalities in 1853, the hospodars fled to Vienna, leaving the government in&nbsp;. the hands of their ministers. During the Danubian campaign that&nbsp;now ensued great suffering was inflicted on the inhabitants, but&nbsp;in 1854 the cabinet of Vienna induced the Russians to withdraw.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">. Austrian troops occupied the principalities, and the hospodars</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">returned to their posts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">f By the treaty of Paris in 1856 the principalities with their existing privileges were placed under the collective guarantee of the contracting powers, while remaining under the suzerainty of the&nbsp;Porte,—the Porte on its part engaging to respect the complete independence of their internal administration. A strip of southern&nbsp;Bessarabia was restored to Moldavia, so as to push back the Russian&nbsp;frontier from the Danube mouth. The existing laws and statutes&nbsp;of both principalities were to be revised by a European commission&nbsp;sitting at Bucharest, and their work was to be assisted by a Divan&nbsp;or national council which the Porte was to convoke </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ad hoc</span><span class="font1"> in each&nbsp;of the two provinces, and in which all classes of AValachian and&nbsp;Moldavian society were to be represented. The European commission, in arriving at its conclusions, was to take into consideration the opinion expressed by the representative councils ; the&nbsp;Powers were to come to terms with the Porte as to the recommendations of the commission ; and the final result was to be embodied&nbsp;in a Iiattisherif of the sultan, which was to lay down the definitive&nbsp;organization of the two principalities. In 1857 the commission&nbsp;arrived, and the representative councils of the two peoples were con-</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">’ voked. On their meeting in September they at once proceeded to vote with unanimity the union of the two principalities into a&nbsp;single state under the name of Romania (Roumania), to be governed&nbsp;by a foreign prince elected from one of the reigning dynasties of&nbsp;Europe, and having a single representative assembly. The Powers&nbsp;decided to undo the work of national union. By the convention&nbsp;concluded by the European congress at Paris in 1858, it was&nbsp;decided that the principalities should continue as heretofore to be&nbsp;governed each by its own prince. AValachia and Moldavia were to&nbsp;have separate assemblies, but a central commission was to be&nbsp;established at Fokshaiii for the preparation of laws of common&nbsp;interest, which were afterwards to be submitted to the respective&nbsp;assemblies. In accordance with this convention the deputies of&nbsp;Moldavia aud AValachia met in separate assemblies at Bucharest and&nbsp;Jassy, but the choice of both fell unanimously on Prince Alexander&nbsp;John Cuza, thus ensuring the personal union of the two principalities (January 1859). A new conference was now summoned to&nbsp;Paris to discuss the affairs of the principalities, and the election of&nbsp;Prince Cuza finally ratified by the Powers and the Porte. The two&nbsp;assemblies and the central commission were preserved till 1862,&nbsp;when a single assembly met at Bucharest and a single ministry was&nbsp;formed for the two countries. The central commission was at the&nbsp;same time abolished, and a council of state charged with preparing&nbsp;bills substituted for it. In May 1864, owing to difficulties between&nbsp;the Government and the general assembly, the latter was dissolved,&nbsp;and a statute was submitted to universal suffrage giving greater&nbsp;authority to the prince, and creating two chambers (of senators&nbsp;and of deputies). The franchise was now extended to all citizens,&nbsp;a cumulative voting power being reserved, however, for property,&nbsp;and the peasantry were emancipated from forced labour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In 1865 a conflict broke out between the Government and the people in Bucharest, and in February 1866 Prince Cuza, whose&nbsp;personal vices had rendered him detestable, was forced to abdicate.&nbsp;The chambers chose first as his successor the count of Flanders,&nbsp;but on his declining the office proceeded to elect Prince Charles&nbsp;of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, who was proclaimed hospodar or&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Domnu</span><span class="font1"> of Roumania April 29, 1866. A new constitution was at&nbsp;the same time introduced. Its provisions secure the universal&nbsp;suffrage of tax-paying citizens, ministerial responsibility, trial&nbsp;by jury, freedom of meeting and petition, of speech and of the&nbsp;press (except as regards breaches of the criminal code), gratuitous&nbsp;and compulsory primary education, and the right of asylum for&nbsp;political exiles. Legislative power is shared between the prince&nbsp;and chambers, but bills relating to the budget and army must&nbsp;originate with the chamber of deputies. There are two chambers—&nbsp;the senate and the chamber of deputies. Both houses are elective,&nbsp;and the election is carried out by means of electoral colleges classified</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1">according to property and professional qualifications. For the house of deputies each constituency is divided in this way into four&nbsp;colleges, each of which elects a member. The two highest of these&nbsp;colleges also elect the senators, each senator being elected for a&nbsp;term of eight years. The senate also includes </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ex officio</span><span class="font1"> certain&nbsp;high officials and ecclesiastics, and members for the universities.&nbsp;The senate consists at present of 120 members, the chamber of&nbsp;deputies of 178. The sovereign has a right of veto reserved to him&nbsp;on all measures. The judicial system is based on the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Code Napoléon,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">with some modifications.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">On the outbreak of the Russo-Turkish war in 1877 Roumania found herself once more between hammer and anvil. Yielding to&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">force majeure</span><span class="font1"> the Government of Prince Charles consented to the&nbsp;passage of Russian troops across Roumanian territory, on the understanding that the scene of hostilities was as far as possible to be&nbsp;removed outside the limits of the principality. The Porte, however, refusing to recognize that Roumania had acted under&nbsp;constraint, proclaimed the Roumanians rebels, and the prince’s&nbsp;Government accordingly resolved to offer active assistance to the&nbsp;Russians. A Roumanian division of 32,000 men under General&nbsp;Cernat, took part in the siege of Plevna, and the Roumanian&nbsp;soldiers distinguished themselves in the opinion of the most competent j udges alike for their heroism and endurance. The successful&nbsp;assault by the Roumanian troops on the “indomitable redoubt ” of&nbsp;Grivitza formed in fact the turning point of the siege and of the war.&nbsp;In the peace of StStefano, however, Russia insisted on the retrocession of the strip of Bessarabia that had been restored to Moldavia&nbsp;by the treaty of Paris, giving Roumania “ in exchange ” the islands&nbsp;of the Danubian delta, and the Dobrudja, which had been ceded by&nbsp;the sultan. This territorial readjustment w<sup>,</sup>as ratified by the treaty&nbsp;of Berlin (1878). The high contracting powers at the same time&nbsp;consented by Art. xliii. to recognize the independence of the principality subject to the provision (Art. xliv.) that all the inhabitants&nbsp;should enjoy complete religious freedom, a clause inserted on&nbsp;account of the Jewish persecutions that had previously taken place,&nbsp;and that foreigners in the country should be treated on a footing&nbsp;of perfect equality. All Danubian fortresses were to be razed, and the&nbsp;jurisdiction of the European commission to regulate the Danubian&nbsp;navigation, on which Roumania now acquired the right of representation, was extended from the mouth to the Iron Gates. The&nbsp;coping-stone to Roumanian independence was set by the proclamation on March 26, 1881, of Prince Charles as king of Roumania,&nbsp;and on May 22 of the same year his coronation took place with the&nbsp;European sanction. The crown placed on King Carol’s head was&nbsp;made from the captured cannon of the Plevna redoubts.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">ROUMELIA. The name of Roumili, “ the land of the Romans,” was applied from the 15th century downwards&nbsp;to all that portion of the Balkan peninsula westwards&nbsp;from the Black Sea which was subject to Turkey. More&nbsp;precisely it was the country bounded N. by Bulgaria, W.&nbsp;by Albania, and S. by the Morea, or in other words the&nbsp;ancient provinces, including Constantinople and Salonica,&nbsp;of Thrace, Thessaly, and Macedonia. The name was ultimately applied more especially to an eyalet or province&nbsp;composed of Central Albania and Western Macedonia,&nbsp;having Monastir for its chief town and including Kesrie&nbsp;(Castoria), Ocri (Ochrida), and Scodra (Scutari) ; and at&nbsp;length it disappeared altogether in the administrative&nbsp;alterations effected between 1870 and 1875. Eastern&nbsp;Roumelia was constituted an autonomous province of the&nbsp;Turkish empire by the Berlin treaty of 1878, to be&nbsp;governed by a Christian governor-general appointed by the&nbsp;sultan for a term of five years. In 1879, in obedience&nbsp;to an international commission, it was divided into six&nbsp;departments and twenty-eight cantons, the departments&nbsp;being Philippopolis (187,095), Tatarbazarjik (117,063),</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
