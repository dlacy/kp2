He was born about the year 1404, and as a boy was sent as a hostage to the Ottoman court, where he was brought up as a Mohammedan for the Turkish military service. He early distinguished himself as a soldier and received high promotion under Amurath II. In 1443 he was of the expedition against the Magyars, but shortly after taking the field he heard of his father’s death and resolved to strike a blow for freedom. Availing himself of the opportunity afforded by John Hunyady’s defeat of the Turks at Nish, he forced from the principal secretary of the sultan a firman making him governor of Croya, his native town, and forthwith left the camp with 300 Albanian horsemen.

sultan, who had invaded Albania. He died in January 1467 at Alessio, leaving an infant son named John, whom he commended to the care of the Venetians. After a twelve years’ war, the Turks finally gained possession of Croya, the representatives of Scanderbeg settling in Calabria.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
