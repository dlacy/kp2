<p><span class="font1">ces connected with the feudal periods in Germany, which appeared from about 1780 to 1800, and formed the counterpart of the Ritter-stiicken or chivalrous dramas, with&nbsp;which the stage had been inundated since the example had&nbsp;been set by Goethe’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Goetz ofBerlichingen</span><span class="font1"> and Babo’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Otho&nbsp;of Wittelsbaeh.</span><span class="font1"> Cramer, Spiess, Schlenkert, and Veit Weber,&nbsp;(Leonhard Wachter), were the favourite writers of this turbulent school of fiction, which in all probability took its rise&nbsp;from the popularity of the romances of Mrs. Radcliffe. Their&nbsp;materials were the blood-stained period of Faustrecht and&nbsp;Vehm-Gerichte, feudal tyrants, suffering damsels, devoted&nbsp;knights, with abundance of single combats and splintering of&nbsp;lances, raising of trap-doors, escapes by sliding pannels, imprisonments in bottomless dungeons, murders, witchcraft,&nbsp;and apparitions ; in short, all that apparatus of the terrible,&nbsp;which, even in such hands, has a certain fascination for the&nbsp;boy, but awakens only a feeling of the ridiculous in the man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Another department of German fictions likewise dealing with the marvellous, but fortunately cultivated by writers of a&nbsp;very different order of talent, was the Mahrchen, or legendary tale. Three different modes may be pointed out in&nbsp;which this class of subjects has been treated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The first is exemplified in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Volhsmarchen,</span><span class="font1"> or popular tales of Musæus, in which the groundwork of marvellous&nbsp;tradition which the writer has selected is treated, not in the&nbsp;spirit of belief, but of a laughing scepticism, and where the&nbsp;writer relies for effect, not so much upon thc interest of his&nbsp;materials, as upon the wit, the satirical allusions, and the&nbsp;quaintdescription or broad drollery which he is able to infuse&nbsp;into the original legend. Whatever in such traditions bordered upon awe or terror, Musæus rejected ; he viewed even&nbsp;these creations of the fancy in a prosaic light, and selected&nbsp;only such features as could be wrought into his ingenious&nbsp;mosaic of fanciful marvel, picturesque description, and sly&nbsp;and somewhat irreligious pleasantry, in the style of Voltaire.&nbsp;What he attempted, however, he accomplished with success. Some of his tales, such as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sturnme Liebe,</span><span class="font1"> (Dumb&nbsp;Love), and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Melechsαla,</span><span class="font1"> might be cited as models of the&nbsp;art of combining the childish interest of a nursery tale with&nbsp;that shew of irony or philosophy which affords even to grave&nbsp;personages an apology for the perusal of popular tales.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In this semi-derisive style of treating the traditionary legends of his country, Musæus remains the solitary writer of talent. This natural tendency of the German mind towards&nbsp;earnestness and belief, even in the case of the marvellous,&nbsp;led to a very decided preference of the serious manner in&nbsp;the treatment of such themes. And undoubtedly at the head&nbsp;of this second mode of treating the legend stands Ludwick&nbsp;Tieck, (born 1773). Questionable as we think his claims areto&nbsp;the highest distinction, either as a poet or a novelist, in the&nbsp;proper sense of the term, his success in the management of&nbsp;traditional marvels in a poetical spirit is undeniable. He&nbsp;seems without an effort to throw himself back into the spirit of primitive and superstitious periods, when the agency&nbsp;of an invisible world formed an article of belief, and exercised the strongest influence over the conduct of life ; a time&nbsp;of supposed prodigies, and omens, and secret charms, whose&nbsp;agency pervaded and controlled the course of nature. In&nbsp;reading the best of these legends of Tieck, such as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The&nbsp;Fair Eckbeτt, The Love Charm,</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Peter ofAbano,</span><span class="font1"> we feel&nbsp;that he has the power of carrying us back in advanced age&nbsp;into the very realm of Fairyland, and subjecting us anew&nbsp;to the influences of childhood. “ These legends have a&nbsp;freshness about them like that of the earliest morning, a&nbsp;sweetness as of wild flowers, and a calm beauty, caught as&nbsp;it were from a radiant sunset or a rising morn. The reader&nbsp;ofthe </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Runenberg</span><span class="font1"> is brought face to face with the presiding&nbsp;spirits of the animal and vegetable kingdoms ; now he feels&nbsp;as if he were embosomed in luxurious vegetation, bathed&nbsp;in fertilizing dew, and fanned by balmy zephyrs, and now&nbsp;as if he were transported to cavern depths or darkest mines,&nbsp;where mountain spirits exercise an unholy influence. All&nbsp;the other legends, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Fair Eckbert, The Fairies,</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The&nbsp;Trusty Eekhαrt,</span><span class="font1"> have the same beauty and significance ;&nbsp;but it is impossible by mere description to give any idea of&nbsp;their peculiar nature. They must be studied and felt to be&nbsp;at all understood.”@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We are here speaking of Tieck merely as the writer who has treated the traditional tale in the most poetical spirit.&nbsp;Within the domain of the novel, taking the term even in&nbsp;a very extensive sense, our estimate of his powers will be&nbsp;very different.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The mode of treating the legendary lore of Germany, of which the tales of Tieck had furnished the first example,&nbsp;as the most agreeable to the national character, soon found&nbsp;numerous, or, it might rather be said, numberless imitators.&nbsp;For the last thirty years, the example of Tieck has been&nbsp;implicitly followed ; and all the legendary novelists of Germany have been melancholy and gentlemanlike, after the&nbsp;pattern of the Phantasus. Of these the writers best known&nbsp;to English readers, through translation, are the Baron de la&nbsp;Motte Fouque, the author of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Undine,</span><span class="font1"> the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Magic Ring,</span><span class="font1"> and&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sintram ;</span><span class="font1"> Chamisso, the author of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Peter Schlemihl;</span><span class="font1"> and&nbsp;Apel, the author of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Freyschu,tz.</span><span class="font1"> It may be doubted&nbsp;whether better specimens of the German tale might not be&nbsp;selected from writers with which the English public is not&nbsp;familiar,—some of Henrich Steffens’ short legendary stories&nbsp;in particular,—such as, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sleeping Bride,</span><span class="font1"> (Die Sclilafende&nbsp;Braut) and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Nightly Betrothal in the Church ofRorwig,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(Die Nachtliche trauung im Kirche Rδrwig), which have&nbsp;not yet found a translator, appear not undeserving of the&nbsp;attention of the lovers of the marvellous. In the wild productions of Achim von Arnim, such as the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Countess Dolores,</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Isabella of Egypt,</span><span class="font1"> traits of talent sparkle in the&nbsp;midst of absurdity. And from the works of Clemens Bren-tano, and of Zhokke, the author of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Abeliηo,</span><span class="font1"> several interesting legends might be selected. In particular, we are&nbsp;surprised that the simple and beautiful legendary tale by&nbsp;the former, “ The History of the Brave Kasperl and the&nbsp;Fair Annerl,” is yet untranslated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The third form in which the Mahrchen was employed, but, at the same time, perverted from its proper purpose, and&nbsp;subjected to a more Mezentian union than it had submitted&nbsp;to even under the satirical despotism of Musæus, w as in the&nbsp;fantastic or grotesquely terrible manner introduced by Hoffmann, and, since his death, so injudiciously and unsuccessfully imitated both in Germany and in France. Hoffmann’s&nbsp;manner cannot be considered as entirely original, since an&nbsp;approach to it may be pointed out in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Diable Amoureux&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">of Cazotte. It is singular, however, that his productions,&nbsp;such as the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sandman,</span><span class="font1"> the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Magnetizer,</span><span class="font1"> the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Devil's Elixir,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">and others of that class, deriving their whole interest&nbsp;and effect from their connexion with the peculiar nature&nbsp;and idiosyncrasy of the writer’s mind, and so incapable&nbsp;of being imitated with the least success by any one not&nbsp;possessing the same anomalous mental conformation and&nbsp;physical irritability with the Prussian judge, should have&nbsp;exercised a very decided though temporary influence&nbsp;over the literature, not merely of Germany, but of Europe ; and it proves that, notwithstanding the extravagances, there does reside in them some charm,—something&nbsp;which appeals successfully, not, indeed, to the mind in its&nbsp;calmer mood, but to the imagination when in a state of temporary excitement. Only in such a mind as Hoffmann’s,&nbsp;moulded into its existing shape by an ill-omened union of&nbsp;influences, mental and bodily, habitually haunted with&nbsp;gorgons and presentiments, seeing traces, as it were, of&nbsp;the devil’s hoof in the commonest paths of life, and start</span></p><div>
