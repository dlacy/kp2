        <p><span class="font1">B</span><span class="font3">OTH the city and the state of Rome are
                represented in tradition as having been gradually formed by the&nbsp;fusion of
                separate communities. The original settlement&nbsp;of Romulus is said to have been
                limited to the Palatine&nbsp;Mount. With this were united before the end of
                his&nbsp;reign the Capitoline and the Quirinal ; Tullus Hostilius&nbsp;added the
                Ctelian, Ancus Martius the Aventine ; and&nbsp;finally Servius Tullius included the
                Esquiline and Viminal,&nbsp;and enclosed the whole seven hills with a stone wall.
                The&nbsp;growth of the state closely followed that of the city. To&nbsp;the original
                Romans on the Palatine were added successively the Sabine followers of King Tatius,
                Albans transplanted by Tullus, Latins by Ancus, and lastly the&nbsp;Etruscan
                comrades of Cseles Vibenna. This tradition is&nbsp;supported by other and more
                positive evidence. The race&nbsp;of the Luperci on February 15 was in fact a
                purification&nbsp;of the boundaries of the “ancient Palatine town,”@@<sup>1</sup>
                the&nbsp;“square Rome” of Ennius;@@<sup>2</sup> and the course taken is
                that&nbsp;described by Tacitus as the “pomoerium” of the city&nbsp;founded by
                    Romulus.@@<sup>3</sup> On the Esquiline, Varrò mentions&nbsp;an “ ancient city ”
                and an “ earthen rampart,”@@<sup>4 </sup>and the&nbsp;festival of the Septimontium
                is evidence of a union between&nbsp;this settlement and that on the
                    Palatine.@@<sup>5</sup> The fusion of&nbsp;these “ Mounts ” with a settlement on
                the Quirinal “ Hill ”&nbsp;is also attested by trustworthy evidence;@@<sup>6</sup>
                and in particular the line taken by the procession of the Argei represents the
                enlarged boundaries of these united communities.@@<sup>7&nbsp;</sup>Lastly, the
                Servian agger still remains as a witness to the&nbsp;final enclosure of the various
                settlements within a single&nbsp;ring-wall. But is tradition right in representing
                this&nbsp;fusion of distinct settlements as a fusion also of communities of
                different race<sup>1</sup>? Much of what it says on&nbsp;this point may be at once
                dismissed as fabulous. The&nbsp;tales of JEneas and his Trojans, of Evander and
                his&nbsp;Arcadians, of the followers of Heracles, and of the still&nbsp;earlier
                Aborigines have no claim to a place in history;@@<sup>8 </sup>we&nbsp;cannot accept
                the tradition to which the Romans clung&nbsp;with proud humility of the asylum
                opened by Romulus, or&nbsp;believe that the ancestors of the Romans were a
                mixed&nbsp;concourse of outlaws and refugees,@@<sup>9</sup> nor, while
                admitting&nbsp;the probability of the tradition that in remote times the&nbsp;“
                Sicels ” had dwelt on the seven hills, can we allow them&nbsp;any part or lot in the
                historic Roman people.@@<sup>10</sup> That this&nbsp;people were in the main
                homogeneous and in the main of&nbsp;Latin descent is unquestionable. Indications of
                the truth&nbsp;are not wanting even in the traditions themselves : King</span></p>
        <p><span class="font3">Faunus who rules the Aborigines on the Palatine 13 Latin ; “ Latini ”
                is the name assumed by the united Aborigines&nbsp;and Trojans; the immediate
                progenitors of Rome are the&nbsp;Latin Lavinium and the Latin Alba. The evidence
                of&nbsp;the language, the religion, the institutions and civilization&nbsp;of early
                Rome points to the same conclusion. The speech&nbsp;of the Romans is from the first
                Latin @@<sup>11</sup> the oldest gods of&nbsp;Rome—Saturn, Janus, Jupiter, Juno,
                Diana, &amp;c.—are all&nbsp;Latin ; “ rex,” “ praetor,” “ dictator,” “ curia,” are
                Latin&nbsp;titles and institutions.@@<sup>12</sup> Geographically too the low hills
                by&nbsp;the Tiber form a part of the strip of coast-land from which&nbsp;the Latini
                took their name, and the primitive settlements,&nbsp;with their earthen ramparts and
                wooden palisades planted&nbsp;upon them out of reach both of human foes and of
                the&nbsp;malaria of the swampy low grounds, are only typical of&nbsp;the mode of
                settlement which the conditions of life dictated&nbsp;throughout
                    Latium.@@<sup>13</sup> But tradition insists on the admixture of at least two
                non-Latin elements, a Sabine and an&nbsp;Etruscan. The question as regards the
                latter will be&nbsp;more fully discussed hereafter; it is enough to say
                here&nbsp;that there is no satisfactory evidence that any one of
                the&nbsp;communities which combined to form Rome was Etruscan,&nbsp;or that there
                was any important Etruscan strain in the&nbsp;Roman blood.@@<sup>14</sup> With the
                Sabines it is otherwise. That&nbsp;union of the Palatine and Quirinal settlements
                which&nbsp;constituted so decisive a stage in the growth of Rome is&nbsp;represented
                as having been in reality a union of the&nbsp;original Latins with a band of Sabine
                invaders who had&nbsp;seized and held not only the Quirinal Hill but the
                northern&nbsp;and nearest peak of the Capitoline Mount. The tradition&nbsp;was
                evidently deeply rooted. The name of the Quirinal&nbsp;Hill itself was derived from
                the Sabine town of Cures.@@<sup>15&nbsp;</sup>The ancient worships connected with it
                were said to be&nbsp;Sabine.@@<sup>16 </sup>One of the three old tribes, the Tities,
                was&nbsp;believed to represent the Sabine element ;@@<sup>17</sup> the second
                and&nbsp;the fourth kings are both of Sabine descent. By the great&nbsp;majority of
                modern writers the substance of the tradition,&nbsp;the fusion of a body of Sabine
                invaders with the original&nbsp;Latins, is accepted as historical; and even
                Mommsen&nbsp;allows its possibility, though he throws back the time of&nbsp;its
                occurrence to an earlier period than that of the union&nbsp;of the two
                    settlements.@@<sup>18</sup> We cannot here enter into the</span></p>
