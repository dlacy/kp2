<p><span class="font0">ROTTERDAM, is a city in the province of Holland, in E. Long. 4. 20. N Lat. 52. ſituated on the north bank of the river Maeſe, about 37 miles ſouth of&nbsp;Amſterdam, nine ſouth-eaſt of the Hague, and 15 to&nbsp;the eaſtward of Brief It is a large and populous city,&nbsp;of a triangular figure, handſomely built of brick, the&nbsp;ftreets w<sub>f</sub>ide and well paved. There are ten gates to&nbsp;the town, ſix of which are at the land fide and four at&nbsp;the fide of the Maeſe. It is ſuppoſed to take its name from&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Roter,</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rotter,</span><span class="font0"> a little river that falls into the canals of this city, and from </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dam,</span><span class="font0"> a dike. It is uncertain&nbsp;wſhen it was ſirſt built ; and though ſt is ſuppoſed to be&nbsp;very ancient, yet we find no mention made of it before&nbsp;the I 3th century. In the year 1270 it was ſurrounded with ramparts, and honoured with ſeveral privileges;&nbsp;but 27 years after it was taken by the Flemings. In&nbsp;the year 1418, Brederode chief of the Hacks made him-ſelſ maſter of it ; ſince which time it has continued yearly&nbsp;to increaſe by means of the conveniency of its harbour.&nbsp;Its arms are vert, a pale argent, quarterly in a chief on&nbsp;the ſirſt and third, or, a lion ſpotted fable, on the ſecond and fourth a lion ſpotted gules.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rotterdam is not reckoned one of the principal cities of the province, becauſe it has not been always in its preſent flouriſhing condition. The Dutch call it&nbsp;the ſirſt of the ſecond rank, whereas it ought to be&nbsp;eſteemed the ſecond of the firſt, being, next to Amſterdam, the moſt trading town in the United Provinces.&nbsp;Its port is very commodious ; for the canals, which run&nbsp;through moſt parts of the town, bring the ſhips, ſome&nbsp;of 200 or 300 ton, up to the merchants door ; a conveniency for loading and unloading which is not to be&nbsp;found in other places. The great ſhips go up into the&nbsp;middle of the town by the canal into which the Maeſe&nbsp;enters by the old head,· as it comes out by the new.&nbsp;A ſtranger, upon his firſt entering this place, is aſto-piſhed at the beautiful confufion of chimneys intermixed with tops of trees with which the canals are planted,&nbsp;and ſtreamers of veſſels ; inſomuch that he can hardly&nbsp;tell whether it be fleet, city, or foreſt. The Harring&nbsp;Vliet is a very fine ſtreet ; moſt of the houſes are new,&nbsp;and built of hewn ſtone ; but the grandeſt as well as&nbsp;moſt agreeable ſtreet in Rotterdam is the Bomb Quay,&nbsp;which lies parallel with the Maeſe ; or» one fide it is&nbsp;open to the river, and the other is ornamented with a&nbsp;grand facade of the beſt houſes in the city, inhabited&nbsp;chiefly by the Engliſh ; they are five or ſix ſtories high,&nbsp;maſſy and very clumſy : wherever there is any attempt&nbsp;at ornament, it is the worſt that can be conceived.&nbsp;One ſees no Grecian architecture, except Doric entablatures, ſtuck upon the top of the upper ilory, without pilaſters ; Ionic volutes, turned often the wrong&nbsp;way, and an attempt at Corinthian capitals, without&nbsp;any other part of the order. The doors are large, and&nbsp;ſtuck with great knobs and clumſy carving; you aſctnd&nbsp;to them, not in front, but by three or four ſteps going&nbsp;up on each fide, and you are aſſiſted by iron rails of a&nbsp;tnoſt immenſe thickneſs. Theſe houſes are almoſt all&nbsp;window ; and the window ſhutters and frames being&nbsp;painted green, the glaſs has all </span><span class="font1">a </span><span class="font0">green, call, which is&nbsp;helped by </span><span class="font1">the reflection from </span><span class="font0">the trees that overſhadow&nbsp;their </span><span class="font1">houſes, </span><span class="font0">which, were it not ſor this circumſtance,&nbsp;would be intolerably hot, from their vicinity to the canals. Moſt of the houſes have lookmg-glaſſes placed&nbsp;on the outſides of the windows, on both ſides, in order&nbsp;that they may ſee every thing which paſſes up and&nbsp;down the ſtreet. The ſtair-caſes are narrow, ſteep, and&nbsp;come down almoſt to the door. In general, the houſes&nbsp;riſe with enormous ſteep roofs, turning the gable end&nbsp;to the ſtreet, and leaning conſiderably f6rward, ſo that&nbsp;the top often projects near two feet beyond the perpendicular. The Bomb Quay is ſo broad, that there&nbsp;are diſtinct walks ſor carriages and foot-paſſengers, lined and lhaded with a double row of trees.—You look&nbsp;over the river on ſome beautiful meadows, and a fine&nbsp;avenue of trees, which leads to the Peſt-houſe : it ſeems&nbsp;to be an elegant building, and the trees round it are ſo&nbsp;diſpoſed as to appear a thick wood. This ſtreet is at&nbsp;leaſt half a mile in length, and extends from the old to&nbsp;the new head, the two places where the water enters to&nbsp;fill the canals of this extenſive city. When water ru∏3&nbsp;through a ſtreet, it then aſſumes the name of a canal,&nbsp;of which kind the Heeren-fleet has the pre-eminence ;&nbsp;the houſes are of free-ſtone, and very lofty ; the canal&nbsp;is ſpacious, and covered wfith ſhips : at one end ſtands&nbsp;the Engliſh church, a neat pretty building, of which&nbsp;the biſhop of London is ordinary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This port is much more frequented by the Britiſh merchants than Amſterdam, inſomuch that, after a fro’ft,&nbsp;when the ſea is open, ſometimes 300 ſail of Britiſh veſſels ſail out of the harbour at once. There is alwavs </span><span class="font1">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">large number of Britiſh ſubjects who reſide in this&nbsp;town, and live much in the ſame manner as in Great&nbsp;Britain. The reaſon of the great traffic between this&nbsp;place and England, is becauſe the ſhips can generally&nbsp;load and unload, and return to England from Rotterdam, before a ſhip can get clear from Amſterdam and the Texel. Hence the Engliſh merchants-find it cheaper and more commodious, after their goods&nbsp;are arrived at Rotterdam, to ſend them in boats over&nbsp;the canals to Amſterdam. .Another great advantage&nbsp;they have here for commerce is, that the Maeſe is open,&nbsp;and the paſſage free from ice, much ſooner in the&nbsp;ſpring than in the Y and Zuyder-ſea, which lead to&nbsp;Amſterdam.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The glaſs-houſe here is one of the beſt in the ſeven provinces ; it makes abundance of glaſs-toys and enamelled bowls, which are ſent to India, and exchanged&nbsp;for china-ware, and other oriental commodities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The college of admiralty here is called the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">college of the Maeſe,</span><span class="font0"> the chief of all Holland and the United&nbsp;Provinces. The lieutenant-general, admiral of Holland, is obliged to go on board of a Rotterdam ſhip in&nbsp;the Maeſe when he goes to ſea, and then he commands&nbsp;the ſquadron of the Maeſe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On the eaſt fide of the city there is a large baſon and dock, where ſhip-carpenters are continually employed&nbsp;for the uſe of the admiralty, or of the Eaſt India company. But the largeſt ſhips belonging to the admiralty ot Rotterdam are kept at Helvoetſluys, as the moſt&nbsp;commodious ſtation, that place being ſituated on the&nbsp;ocean ; for it requires both time and trouble to work&nbsp;a large ſhip from the dock of Rotterdam to the ſea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rotterdam has four Dutch churches for the eſta-hhſhed religion. There is one thing very remarkable</span></p>
