a province in the north of Spain, on the shores of the Bay of Biscay, bounded on the E. by Biscaya, on the S. by Burgos and Palencia, and on the W. by Leon and Oviedo. The area is 2113 square miles. The province is mountainous in character, being traversed from east to west by the Cantabrian chain, which in the Picos de Europa reaches a height of over 8700 feet, and sends off numerous branches to the sea. On the north side of the range the streams are all short, the principal being the Ason, the Miera, the Pas, the Besaya, the Soja, and the Nansa, which flow into the Bay of Biscay; part of the province lies to the southward of the watershed, and is drained by the upper Ebro. The valleys of Santander are fertile, and produce various kinds of grain, maize, pulse, hemp, flax, and vegetables. Oranges, lemons, grapes, figs, and other fruits flourish, and forests of oak, chestnut, walnut, and fir cover the hills. Rich pasturage for cattle and swine and a good supply of game are also found among them, and the fisheries along the coast are likewise productive. Foreign capital has been successfully applied to the development of lead, coal, and iron mines ; and the mountains contain quarries of limestone, marble, and gypsum, and abound with mineral springs. The district was part of the Roman province of Cantabria, which, after passing under the empire of the Goths, became the principality of the Asturias. The portion called Asturia de Santa Juliana, or Santillana, was included in the kingdom of Old Castile, and, on the subdivision of the old provinces of Spain in 1833, became the province of Santander. The people are of a purer race than in parts of Spain subjected by the Moors, and both in mental and physical qualities show their Teutonic ancestry. The industries of the country are consequently in a flourishing condition, and, besides the natural products above mentioned, there are foundries, breweries, distilleries, tanneries; cotton, linen, cloth, and flour mills; brick and tile works; and manufactories of hats, soap, buttons, preserves, and chocolate. The province is traversed from north to south by the railway and high road from Santander by Palencia to Madrid ; the highest point on the railway (Venta de Pazozal) is 3229 feet above the sea. For purposes of administration the province is divided into eleven partidos judiciales, containing 103 ayuntamientos, and returns two senators and five deputies to the cortes. The population in 1877 numbered 235,299, Besides Santander, the capital, the only places having within the municipal boundaries a population exceeding 5000 are Castro- Urdidles (7623), Valle de Pielagos (5500), Torrelavega (7192), and Valderredible (7240). Santoña has 4428, and Laredo 4384. Santillana (1776) has a fine Roman</p></div> Santa Maura, measuring about 20 miles from north to south and 5 to 8 miles in breadth, is a rugged mass of limestone and bituminous shales (partly Tertiary), rising in its principal ridges to heights of 2000 and 3000 feet, and presenting very limited areas of level ground. The grain crop suffices only for a few months’ local consumption; but olive oil of good quality is produced to the extent of 30,000 to 50,000 barrels per annum; the vineyards (in the west especially) yield 100,000 barrels of red wine (bought mainly by Rouen, Cette, Trieste, and Venice); the currant, introduced about 1859, has gradually come to be the principal source of wealth (the crop averaging 2,500,000 lb); and small quantities of cotton, flax, tobacco, valonia, &amp;c., are also grown. The salt trade, formerly of importance, has suffered from Greek customs regulations. Though to a large extent unlettered and superstitious, the inhabitants are industrious and well- behaved. The chief town (5000 inhabitants) properly called Amaxikhi, but more usually Santa Maura, after the neighbouring fort, is situated at the north-east end of the island opposite the lagoon. In the south-west is the village of Vasiliki, where a wharf protected by a mole<pb facs="encyclopediabrit21newyrich_raw_0318.jp2" xml:id="eb09-21-s01-0298"/>
