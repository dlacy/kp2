<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(also in 1513) liis celebrated Sibyls in S. Maria della Pace, —figures of exquisite grace, arranged with perfect skill&nbsp;in an awkward space. It is not without reason that&nbsp;Vasari gives these the highest position among his fresco-paintings.@@<sup>1</sup> Agostino Chigi also employed Raphael to&nbsp;build for him a private chapel in S. Maria del Popolo, and&nbsp;to make a series of cartoons to be executed in mosaic on&nbsp;the inner dome.@@<sup>2</sup> The central medallion has a figure of&nbsp;God among clouds and angel boys, such as Raphael drew&nbsp;with unrivalled grace (fig. 6), and around are the eight</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">planets, each with its pagan deity and directing angel.@@<sup>3 </sup>He has not hampered himself by any of the usual rules&nbsp;which should apply to the designing of mosaic; they are&nbsp;simply treated as pictures, with almost deceptive effects&nbsp;of perspective. The execution of these brilliant mosaics&nbsp;was carried out by the Venetian Luigi della Pace, whose&nbsp;signature is introduced on the torch of Cupid in the panel&nbsp;representing the star Venus (Ludovico della&nbsp;Pace Veneziano fecit, 1516). These mosaics&nbsp;are still as perfect and brilliant as if they&nbsp;were the work of yesterday. Probably in&nbsp;the early years of Leo X.’s reign were painted the Madonna&nbsp;della Seggiola (Pitti), the S. Cecilia at Bologna (not completed till 1516), the miniature Vision of Ezekiel (Pitti),&nbsp;and three important pictures at Madrid. The latest of&nbsp;these, known as Lo Spasimo, from the church at Palermo,&nbsp;for which it was painted, is one of Raphael’s finest compositions, representing Christ bearing His Cross. It bears&nbsp;signs of Giulio Romano’s hand in its heavy colouring with&nbsp;unpleasant purple tones. The Madonna called Della Per la&nbsp;has much changed from the darkening of the pigments;&nbsp;in design it recalls Leonardo da Vinci.@@<sup>4</sup> The small&nbsp;Madonna della Rosa is the most perfect in colour of all&nbsp;the master’s pictures in the Madrid Gallery, and is usually&nbsp;rather undervalued; it is a most graceful little picture.&nbsp;The portrait of Leo X. with Cardinals de’ Rossi and de’&nbsp;Medici, in the Pitti, is one of his finest portrait-pictures,&nbsp;especially as regards the figure of the pope.@@<sup>5</sup> Little is</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">known about the Madonna di S. Sisto, the glory of the Dresden Gallery; no studies or sketches for it exist. In&nbsp;style it much resembles the Madonna di Foligno; it is&nbsp;less injured by restoration than the latter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Among the latest works of Raphael are the large St Michael and the Devil, in the Louvre, signed “Raphael&nbsp;Urbinas pingebat, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">mdxviii.,” </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">and the very beautiful portrait of the Violin-player, in the Sciarra-Colonna Palace in&nbsp;Rome, also dated 1518; this last bears much resemblance&nbsp;to the painter himself. The British Museum possesses&nbsp;one of Raphael’s finest portraits, though only a chalk&nbsp;drawing, that of his friend the painter Timoteo della Vite,&nbsp;a masterpiece of expression and vigour · it is executed in&nbsp;black and red, and is but little inferior in chromatic effect&nbsp;to an oil-painting; it is life-size, and is executed with&nbsp;wonderful skill and evident keen interest in the subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The tapestry cartoons, seven of which are in the South Kensington Museum, were painted by pupils from Raphael’s&nbsp;designs. They are part of a set of ten, with scenes from&nbsp;the Acts of the Apostles, intended, when copied in tapestry,&nbsp;to adorn the lower part of the walls of the Sistine chapel.&nbsp;The tapestries themselves, worked at Brussels, are now,&nbsp;after many vicissitudes, hung in a gallery in the Vatican ;&nbsp;the set is complete, thus preserving the design of the three&nbsp;lost cartoons. The existing seven, after being cut up into&nbsp;strips for use on the looms, were bought by Rubens for&nbsp;Charles I.@@<sup>6</sup> The tapestry copies are executed with wonderful skill, in spite of Raphael’s having treated the subjects&nbsp;in a purely pictorial way, with little regard to the exigencies of textile work. The designs are reversed, and the&nbsp;colours far more brilliant than those of the cartoons, much&nbsp;gold and silver being introduced. The noble figure of&nbsp;Christ in the Delivery of the Keys to St Peter is in the&nbsp;tapestry much disfigured by the addition of a number of&nbsp;large gold stars all over the drapery, which spoil the simple&nbsp;dignity of the folds. The rich framework round each picture, designed by Raphael’s pupils, probably by Penni and&nbsp;Giovanni da Udine, exists in the tapestries and adds greatly&nbsp;to their decorative effect. The cartoons were executed in&nbsp;1515 and 1516, and the finished tapestries were first exhibited in their place in the Sistine chapel on 26th December&nbsp;1519,—a very short time for the weaving of such large&nbsp;and elaborate pictures. The three of which the cartoons&nbsp;are lost represent the Martyrdom of St Stephen, the Conversion of St Paul, and St Paul in Prison at Philippi.&nbsp;Probably no pictures are better known or have been more&nbsp;often engraved and copied than these seven cartoons.@@<sup>7</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Transfiguration</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">.@@<sup>8</sup>—In 1519 Cardinal Giuliano de’ Medici (afterwards Clement VII.), as bishop of Narbonne,&nbsp;ordered two altar-pieces for his cathedral,—the one by&nbsp;Raphael, the other by Raphael’s Venetian rival Sebastiano&nbsp;del Piombo (see </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Sebastiano). </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">That by the latter painter&nbsp;is the noble Resurrection of Lazarus, now in the National&nbsp;Gallery, in the drawing of which the Venetian received&nbsp;important aid from Michelangelo. Several studies for&nbsp;Raphael’s picture exist, showing that he at first intended&nbsp;to paint a Resurrection of Christ as a pendant to Sebas-tiano’s subject, but soon altered his scheme into the Transfiguration. The eight or nine existing studies are scattered&nbsp;through the Oxford, Lille, Windsor, and some private</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>@@@1</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to Michelangelo’s generous intervention, Raphael was paid&nbsp;the large sum for that time of 900 gold ducats for this fresco.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">@@@*</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> La Perla, “ the pearl ” of the Spanish royal collection, was originally painted for Bishop Louis of Canossa; it was sold by Cromwell with the greater part of Charles I.’s collection at Hampton Court. The composition, though not the execution, of this picture belongs to Raphael’s&nbsp;early years in Rome ; it is very remarkable for its delicacy of touch and&nbsp;high finish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>@@@8</sup> The magnificent portrait-heads of the Venetian scholars Navagero and Beazzano, now in the Doria Gallery in Rome, are worthy of Raphael&nbsp;at his best, and have for long been attributed to him. There are good&nbsp;contemporary copies at Madrid.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>@@@6</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately they were not sold with the bulk of Charles’s collection, and remained at Hampton Court till a few years ago.

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>@@@7</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name “ arazzi ” given by Italians to these tapestries is derived&nbsp;from Arras, where they were erroneously thought to have been woven ;&nbsp;they were made at Brussels. It is much to be regretted that visitors&nbsp;to the Vatican are no longer allowed to see these priceless examples of&nbsp;textile work.</span></p>
