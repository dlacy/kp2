<p><span class="font1">RIANSARES, AUGUSTIN FERNANDEZ MUROZ, </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Duke of </span><span class="font1">(1808 or 1810-1873), morganatic husband of Maria Christina,&nbsp;queen and regent of Spain, was born at Tarancôn, in the&nbsp;province of Cuenca, in New Castile. His father was the keeper of&nbsp;an “ </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">estanco ”</span><span class="font1"> or office for the sale of the tobacco of the government monopoly. He enlisted in the bodyguard, and attracted&nbsp;the attention of the queen. According to one account, he&nbsp;distinguished himself by stopping the runaway horses of her&nbsp;carriage; according to another, he only picked up her handkerchief; a third,and scandalous explanation of his fortune&nbsp;has been given. It is certain that the queen married him&nbsp;privately, very soon after the death of her husband on the&nbsp;29th of September 1833. By publishing her marriage, Maria&nbsp;Christina would have forfelted the regency; but her relations&nbsp;with Mufioz were perfectly well known. When on the 13th of&nbsp;August 1836 the soldiers on duty at the summer palace, La&nbsp;Granja, mutinied and forced the regent to grant a constitution,&nbsp;it was generally, though wrongly, believed that they overcame her reluctance by seizing Munoz, whom they called her&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“ guapo”</span><span class="font1"> or fancy man, and threatening to shoot him. When&nbsp;in 1840 the queen found her position intolerable and fled the&nbsp;country, Munoz went with her and the marriage was published,&nbsp;and on the overthrow of Espartero in 1843 the couple returned.&nbsp;In 1844 Queen Isabella II., who was now declared to be of&nbsp;age, gave her consent to her mother’s marriage, which was&nbsp;publicly performed. Munoz was created duke of Riansares&nbsp;and made a knight of the Golden Fleece. By Louis Philippe,&nbsp;king of the French, he was created duke of Mont-Morot and&nbsp;Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour. Until his wife was&nbsp;finally driven from Spain by the revolutionary movement of&nbsp;1854, the duke is credibly reported to have applied himself&nbsp;to making a large fortune out of railway concessions and&nbsp;by’ judicious stock exchange speculations. Political ambitions he had none, and it is said that he declined the offer&nbsp;of the crown of Ecuador. All authorities agree that he was&nbsp;not only good-looking, but kindly'and well-bred. He died&nbsp;five years before his wife at L’Adresse, near Havre, on the&nbsp;nth of September 1873. Several children were born of the&nbsp;marriage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RIAZ PASHA (c. 1835- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;), Egyptian statesman, born</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">about 1835, was of a Circassian family, but said to be of Hebrew extraction. Little is known of his early life save that until&nbsp;the accession of Ismail Pasha to the vice-royalty of Egypt in&nbsp;1863 he occupied a humble position. Ismail, recognizing in&nbsp;this obscure individual a capacity for hard work and a strong&nbsp;will, made him one of his ministers, to find, to his chagrin,&nbsp;that Riaz was also an honest man possessed of a remarkable&nbsp;independence of character. When Ismail’s financial straits&nbsp;compelled him to agree to a commission of inquiry Riaz was&nbsp;the only Egyptian of known honesty sufficiently intelligent&nbsp;and patriotic to be named as a vice-president of the commission. He filled this office with distinction, but not to the&nbsp;liking of Ismail. The khedive, however, felt compelled, when&nbsp;as a sop to his European creditors he assumed the position&nbsp;of a constitutional monarch, to nominate Riaz as a member&nbsp;of the first Egyptian cabinet. For the few months this&nbsp;government lasted (September 1878 to April 1879) Riaz was&nbsp;minister of the interior. When Ismail dismissed the cabinet&nbsp;and attempted to resume autocratic rule, Riaz had to flee&nbsp;the country. Upon the deposition of IsmaU, June 1879, Ri<sup>az&nbsp;</sup>was sent for by the British and French controllers, and he&nbsp;formed the first ministry under the khedive Tewfik. His&nbsp;administration, marked by much ability, lasted only two&nbsp;years, and was overthrown by the agitation which had for&nbsp;figure-head Arabi Pasha </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{q.vf.</span><span class="font1"> The beginnings of this movement Riaz treated as of no consequence. In reply to a warning&nbsp;of what might happen he said, “ But this is Egypt; such things&nbsp;do not happen; you say they have happened elsewhere,&nbsp;perhaps, but this is Egypt.” On the evening of the 9th of&nbsp;September 1881, after the military demonstration in Abdin&nbsp;Square, Riaz was dismissed; broken in health he went to&nbsp;Europe, remaining at Geneva until the fall of Arabi. After</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">that event Riaz, subordinating his vanity to his patriotism, accepted office as minister of the interior under Sherif Pasha&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.).</span><span class="font1"> Had Riaz had his way Arabi and his associates would&nbsp;have been executed forthwith, and when the British insisted&nbsp;that clemency should be extended to the leaders of the revolt&nbsp;Riaz refused to remain in office, resigning in December 1882.&nbsp;He took no further part in public affairs until 1888, when, on&nbsp;the dismissal of Nubar Pasha </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{q.v.),</span><span class="font1"> he was summoned to&nbsp;form a government. He now understood that the only policy&nbsp;possible for an Egyptian statesman was to work in harmony&nbsp;with the British agent (Sir Evelyn Baring—afterwards Lord&nbsp;Cromer). This he succeeded in doing to a large extent, witnessing if not initiating the practical abolition of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">corvée&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">and many other reforms. The appointment of an Anglo-Indian&nbsp;official as judicial adviser to the khedive was, however, opposed&nbsp;by Riaz, who resigned in May 1891. In the February following he again became prime minister under Abbas II., being&nbsp;selected as comparatively acceptable both to the khédivial&nbsp;and British parties. In AprU 1894 Riaz finally resigned office&nbsp;on account of Ul-health. Superior, probably, both intellectually&nbsp;and morally to his great rival Nubar, he lacked the latter’s&nbsp;broad statesmanship as weU as his pliability. Riaz’s standpoint was that of the benevolent autocrat; he believed that&nbsp;the Egyptians were not fitted for SelTgovemment and must&nbsp;be treated like children, protected from iU-treatment by&nbsp;others and prevented from injuring themselves. In 1889&nbsp;he was made an honorary G.C.M.G. A worthy tribute to&nbsp;Riaz was paid by Lord Cromer in his farewell speech at Cairo&nbsp;on the 4th of May 1907.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“ Little or no courage is now re</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">quired,” said Lord Cromer, “ on the part of a young Egyptian who poses as a reformer, but it was not always so. IsmaiI&nbsp;Pasha had some very drastic methods of dealing with those&nbsp;who did not bow before him. Nevertheless, some thirty years&nbsp;ago Riaz Pasha stood forth boldly to protest against the maladministration that then prevailed 'in Egypt. He was not&nbsp;.afraid to bell the cat.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RIB (from O. Eng. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ribb',</span><span class="font1"> the word appears in many ,Teutonic languages, cf. Gcr. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rippe,</span><span class="font1"> Swed. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">reb),</span><span class="font1"> in anatomy,&nbsp;the primary meaning, one of the series of elastic arched bones&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{costae)</span><span class="font1"> which form the casing or framework of the thorax&nbsp;(see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Skeleton: </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Axial).</span><span class="font1"> The word is in meaning transferred&nbsp;,to many objects resembling a rib in shape or function. In&nbsp;architecture, it is thus used of the arches of stone which in&nbsp;medieval work constitute the skeleton of the vault, and carry&nbsp;the shell or web. Although in the Roman vault the rib played&nbsp;an important element in its construction, it was generally&nbsp;hidden in the thickness of the vault and was made subservient&nbsp;to its geometrical surfaces. The Gothic masons, on the other&nbsp;hand, reversed the process, and not only made the vaulting&nbsp;• surface subservient to the rib, but by mouldings. rendered&nbsp;the latter a highly decorative feature. Jhe principal ribs&nbsp;are the transverse </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{are doubleau),</span><span class="font1"> the diagonal </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{are ogive)&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">and the wall rib </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Jormeret).</span><span class="font1"> Those of less importance are&nbsp;the intermediate, the ridge and Iierne ribs. The ridge-rib&nbsp;is one first introduced into the vault to resist the thrust of&nbsp;the intermediate ribs between the wall and diagonal ribs;&nbsp;it also served to mark the junction of the filling-in or web&nbsp;of vaults in those cases where the courses dipped toward the&nbsp;diagonal rib. (See </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Vault.)</span><span class="font1"> A Iierne rib (the term is borrowed&nbsp;from the French) is a short rib, introduced into the vaulting&nbsp;in the Early Perpendicular period, which coupled together&nbsp;the transverse and intermediate ribs; in the later period the&nbsp;“ lierne ” rib becomes one of the chief features of the “ Stella ”&nbsp;vault (see further </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Vault).</span></p>
