Quintus Curtius was largely used for the <hi rend="italic">Alexaηdreis (c.</hi>  1176-1202) of Gaultier de Châtillon.@@<hi rend="sup">1</hi>  It was the theme of poetry in all European languages : six or seven German poets dealt with the subject, and it may be read in English, Spanish, Danish, Swedish, Icelandic, Flemish, and Bohemian.</p><p>Towards the close of the 15th century an anonymous writer worked up the subject into a prose romance, <hi rend="italic">H histoire du noble et vaillant roy Alixandre le Grant</hi>  (1506), in which the <hi rend="italic">Historiα de Præliis</hi>  is followed with tolerable exactness. After an account of the ancient history of Macedonia and of the intrigue of Nectanebus we are told how Philip dies, and how Alexander subdues Rome and receives tribute from all European nations. He then makes his Persian expedition ; the Indian campaign gives occasion to descriptions of all kinds of wonders. The conqueror visits a cannibal kingdom and finds many marvels in the palace of Porus, among them a vine with golden branches, emerald leaves, and fruit of other precious stones. In one country he meets with women, who, after burial in the winter, become alive again in the spring full of youth and beauty. Having reached the ends of the earth and conquered all nations, he aspires to the dominion of the air. He obtains a magic glass cage, yoked with eight griffins, flies through the clouds, and, thanks to enchanters knowing the language of birds, gets information as to their manners and customs, and ultimately receives their submission. The excessive heat of the upper regions compels him to descend, and he next visits, the bottom of the sea in a kind of diving-bell. The fish crowd round him and pay homage. Alexander returns to Babylon, is crowned with much pomp, and mass is celebrated. He dies by poison soon afterwards.</p><p>The Vœux du Paon and Rcstor du Paon are chansons de geste attached to the Alexander cycle, to which also belongs Florimont, a poem by Aimé de Varennes, said to have been written in 1188. Florimont was a son of the duke of Albania and father of Philip of Macedon by the heiress of the latter country. This poem gave rise to two prose romances—La conqueste de Grèce fniete par Philippe de Madien, by Perrinet du Pin, first printed in 1527, and Histoire du roi Florimond (1528).</p><p>3. We now come to the third order of romances included in the cycle of “ Rome la Grant,” or those which merely reproduce the names of antiquity. The enchanter Virgil is the most famous of those who have given rise to prose works, and what passes under his name is less a romance than a collection of popular tales, many of Eastern derivation. Among romances in verse we have <hi rend="italic">Eraclès, Anseys de Carthage, Cleomadès, A this et Profilias, ProFe-silaus,</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">Ypomedon.</hi>  The first part of <hi rend="italic">Athis et Profilias, </hi>by Alexandre de Bernai (latter part of 12th century), is adapted from the tale of the two merchants in the <hi rend="italic">Disciplina Clericalis</hi>  of Pedro Alfonso, and is the source of Boccaccio’s “ Tito e Gisippo ” <hi rend="italic">(Decam.,</hi>  x. 8). In Γjoo∞e-<hi rend="italic">don,</hi>  written by Hue of Rotelande about 1185, most of the characters are named from the <hi rend="italic">Thebaic.</hi>  As early as the year 1210 we find a rhymed translation of Ovid’s <hi rend="italic">Metamorphoses</hi>  in German by Albrecht von Halberstadt. From Ovid is taken the story of Pyramus and Thisbe in Chaucer’s <hi rend="italic">Legend of Good Women,</hi>  which is the subject of a prose work in Italian, <hi rend="italic">Piramo e Tisbe</hi>  (Milan, s.a.). The episode of Orpheus and Eurydice furnished the plot of the poetical <hi rend="italic">Histoire d<hi rend="sup">,</hi>  Orphée</hi>  of Guillaume de Machault (d. 1370) and the English <hi rend="italic">Sir Orphes.</hi>  The tale of Theseus was handled by Boccaccio and supplied the title and names to the prose romance <hi rend="italic">Histoire du chevalier Theseus de</hi></p><lb/><p><hi rend="italic">Coulogne</hi>  (1534). The Bible as well as the classics was laid under contribution. Gaultier de Belleperche wrote a metrical <hi rend="italic">Roman de Judas Machabee</hi>  about the year 1240, of which a prose reproduction is <hi rend="italic">Les chrcrniques du prince Judas Machabeus, l<hi rend="sup">,</hi>un des neufs preux, et aussi de ses quatres frères</hi>  (Paris, 1514).</p><p>The Enchanter Virgil.—After turning the heroes of antiquity into knights-errant, it was a simple task to transform ancient poets and philosophers into necromancers ; and Virgil and Aristotle became popularly famous, not for poetry and science, but for their supposed knowledge of the black art. One of the earliest references to the magical skill of Virgil@@<hi rend="sup">2</hi> occurs in a letter of the chancellor Conrad (1194), reproduced by Arnold of Lübeck in the continuation of the Clιroηican Slavorum of Helmold. John of Salisbury alludes to the brazen fly fabricated by Virgil ; Hélinand (d. 1227) speaks of similar marvels in a work from which Vincentius Bellovacensis has borrowed ; and Gervase of Tilbury, in his Οtia Imperial™, (1212), and Alexander Neckham (d. 1217), in De Natura Rerum, have reproduced these traditions, with additions. German and French poets did not overlook this accessory to their répertoire. The Roman de Cléomades of Adenez (12th century) and the Image du Monde, an encyclopædic poem of Gauthier de Metz (13th century), contain numerous references to the prodigies of the enchanter. Reynard the Fox informs King Lion that he had from the wise Virgil a quantity of valuable receipts. He also plays a considerable part in the popular folk-tale The Seven Wise Masters, and appears in the Gesta Romanorum and that curious guidebook for pilgrims, the Mirabilia Romæ. He is to be found in Gower’s Confessio Amantis and in Lydgate’s Rochas. A Spanish romance, Vergilios, is included by E. de Ochoa in his Tesσro (Paris, 1838), and Juan Ruiz, archpriest of Hita (d. 1351), has also written a poem on the subject. Many of the tales of magic throughout Europe were referred to Virgil, and gradually developed into a completely new life, strangely different from that of the real hero. They were collected in French under the title of Les Faitz Merveilleux de Virgille (c. 1499), a quarto chapbook of ten pages, which became extremely popular, and was printed, with more or less additional matter, in all languages. We are told how Virgil beguiled the devil at a very early age, in the same fashion as the fisherman used the jinn in the Arabian Nights when he got him to re-enter Solomon’s casket. Another reproduction of a widely spread tale was that of the lady who kept Virgil suspended in a basket. To revenge the affront the magician extinguished all the fires in the city, and no one could rekindle them without subjecting the lady to an ordeal highly offensive to her modesty. Virgil made for the emperor a castle in which he could see and hear everything done or said in Rome, an ever-blooming orchard, statues to preserve the safety of the city, and a lamp to supply light to it. He abducted the soldan’s daughter, and built for her the city of Naples upon a secure foundation of eggs. At last, having performed many extraordinary things, he knew that his time was come. In order to escape the common lot he placed all his treasures in a castle defended by images unceasingly wielding iron flails, and directed his confidential servant to hew him in pieces, which he was to salt and place in a barrel in the cellar, under which a lamp was to be kept burning. The servant was assured that after seven days his master would revive a young man. The directions were carried out ; but the emperor, missing his medicine - man, forced the servant to divulge the secret and to quiet the whirling flails. The emperor and his retinue entered the castle and at last found the mangled corpse. In his wrath he slew the servant, whereupon a little naked child ran thrice round the barrel, crying, “Cursed be the hour that ye ever came here,” and vanished.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Literature.—</hi>On the subject generally, see A.
