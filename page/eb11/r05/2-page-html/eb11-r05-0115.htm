<p><span class="font1">new position. Brief as was his tenure of the office, he proved himself well worthy of it. He was dignified without pompousness, quick without being irritable, and masterful without&nbsp;tyranny. He was scrupulously punctual. Suitors and hearers&nbsp;could not but be impressed by the manifest determination of the lord chief justice to get at the truth, and to do&nbsp;so without waste of time. If this was a fault, it was that&nbsp;of excessive zeal for despatch. When, occasionally, there were&nbsp;flashes of impatience, they were elicited by the exhibition, as&nbsp;he deemed it, of want of preparation, or slovenliness, or verbosity on the part of the advocate before him. Even the&nbsp;youngest and most obscure practitioner could always count&nbsp;upon the assiduous attention of the lord chief justice to a&nbsp;pertinent and thoughtful argument. In 1896 Lord Russell&nbsp;(Pollock B. and Hawkins J. being on this occasion his colleagues&nbsp;on the bench) presided at the trial at bar of the leaders of the&nbsp;Jameson Raid. It was a state trial of grave importance.&nbsp;Russell’s conduct of it, in the midst of much popular excitement,&nbsp;was by itself sufficient to establish his reputation as a great&nbsp;judge. One other event at least in his career while lord chief&nbsp;justice deserves a record, namely, his share in the Venezuela&nbsp;Arbitration in 1899. Lord Herschell, who had been nominated&nbsp;to act with Lord Justice Coffins (afterwards Master of the&nbsp;Rolls), as a British representative on the Commission of Arbitration, of which the distinguished Russian jurist M. Martens&nbsp;was president, died somewhat suddenly in America before the&nbsp;beginning of the proceedings. The lord chief justice accepted&nbsp;the invitation to take the vacant place, and performed his&nbsp;very onerous duty with conspicuous ability.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Nor was it only on the bench or as an international judge that Lord Russell of Killowen sought, during the last years of&nbsp;his busy life, to do service to his country. He signalized&nbsp;his zeal as a law reformer by the public advocacy of radical&nbsp;changes in the system of legal education in the Inns of Court,&nbsp;and by the promotion of measures to put down the vice of&nbsp;secret and illicit commissions in commercial and business life.&nbsp;On the former subject he delivered in 1895 an address in&nbsp;Lincoln’s Inn Hall, under the auspices of the Council of Legal&nbsp;Education, which was afterwards printed and published. In&nbsp;1899, dealing with the latter question, he introduced in the&nbsp;House of Lords a bill, which had its first reading. He again&nbsp;introduced a bill in the session of 1900, which was read a&nbsp;second time, but did not become law. On the 10th of&nbsp;August 1900 the great advocate and great judge passed&nbsp;quietly away at his London residence, after a short illness due&nbsp;to an internal malady.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">- In private as in public life Russell was always strenuous, and most attracted by things that called for the exercise of&nbsp;activity, whether bodily or intellectual. Inaction he disliked&nbsp;both for himself and in others. Though not an athlete, he&nbsp;took an interest in manly pastimes: he was fond of riding and&nbsp;of breeding horses; he liked being on the racecourse; and he&nbsp;enjoyed games, both of skill and of chance. A student of books&nbsp;he was not; he could lay no claim to wide learning or elegant&nbsp;scholarship; but he could appreciate a good book; he was&nbsp;versed in Shakespeare; and he knew and loved the poetry&nbsp;and the songs of his native land. When he wrote, his style,&nbsp;inornate, clear and forcible, reflected the character of his&nbsp;thought. He was a staunch and sympathetic friend, ever&nbsp;ready, in an unostentatious way, to help, where help was really&nbsp;needed. While he undoubtedly exhibited at times, chiefly&nbsp;during the earlier part of his career, a certain brusqueness and&nbsp;impetuousness of speech and demeanour, those who came&nbsp;into contact with him recognized that such occasional outbursts never sprang from any desire to hurt, or from any&nbsp;unkindness of disposition. In his contests at the bar he&nbsp;never made an enemy. He was a strong man, and he liked&nbsp;to have his way; but he was also large-hearted and without&nbsp;a tinge of rancour in his disposition. He was never offended&nbsp;by opposition. Whilst he did not himself shine as a wit or a&nbsp;humorist in conversation or in after-dinner oratory, he heartily&nbsp;enjoyed fun and humour in others; and, wherever he was, the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">force and distinctness of his personality never failed to impress his company. Probably no English lawyer ever excited abroad&nbsp;the admiration which was accorded to Lord Russell of Killowen,&nbsp;alike on the continent of Europe and in America. To the&nbsp;United States he paid two visits, the first in 1883 and the&nbsp;second in 1896. On both occasions he won golden opinions,&nbsp;which were manifested in widespread and warm expressions&nbsp;of sympathy and regret when the news of the death of Lord&nbsp;Russell of Killowen passed across the Atlantic. Between 1894&nbsp;and 1897 Lord Russell of Killowen received the degree of&nbsp;Doctor of Laws </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">honoris causa</span><span class="font1"> from the universities of Dublin,&nbsp;Edinburgh and Cambridge, and from the Laval university,&nbsp;Quebec. In 1892 he was treasurer of Lincoln’s Inn. He left&nbsp;surviving him, besides his widow, five sons and four daughters.&nbsp;His sister Katherine (in religion, Sister Mary Baptist Joseph),&nbsp;pioneer sister of mercy in California, had died two years before&nbsp;at San Francisco.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(W.

<p><span class="font1">RUSSELL OF THORNHAUGH, WILLIAM, 1st </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Baron </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(c.</span><span class="font1"> 1558-1613), English soldier, was a younger son of Francis&nbsp;Russell, 2nd earl of Bedford, and was educated at Magdalen&nbsp;College, Oxford. After spending a few years abroad, he went&nbsp;to Ireland in 1580, and having seen some service in that country&nbsp;he was knighted in September 1581. In 1585 he joined the&nbsp;English forces in the Netherlands, being made lieutenant-general&nbsp;of cavalry; in September 1586 he so distinguished himself&nbsp;at Zutphen that the Spaniards pronounced him “ a devil and&nbsp;not a man ”; and in 1587 he became governor of Flushing&nbsp;in succession to his late friend, Sir Philip Sidney. He differed&nbsp;with the estates of Holland and with his’ superior, Lord&nbsp;Willoughby de Eresby; consequently, on his own initiative,&nbsp;he was recalled to England in July 1588. In May 1594 Russell&nbsp;was made lord deputy of Ireland in place of Sir William Fitz-william. He relieved Enniskillen, but his attempts to capture&nbsp;the insurgent leaders, Hugh O’Neill, earl of Tyrone, and Fiagh&nbsp;MacHugh O’Byrne, came to nothing. In May 1595 Sir John&nbsp;Norris landed in Ireland, his orders being to help the lord deputy&nbsp;in his difficult task. Russell was somewhat chagrined at the&nbsp;choice, as he and Norris were not very good friends, but for a&nbsp;short time they acted together against the rebels in the N.&nbsp;of Ireland. Russell then led an expedition into Connaught,&nbsp;but soon he and Norris were at variance. Having captured&nbsp;O’Byrne in May 1597, Russell laid down his office and left Ireland&nbsp;later in the month. In 1603 he was created Baron Russell&nbsp;of Thornhaugh, and he died on the 9th of August 1613. In&nbsp;1627 his only son Francis succeeded his cousin Edward as&nbsp;4th earl of Bedford.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RUSSIA </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Rossiya),</span><span class="font1"> the general name for the European and Asiatic dominions of the “ Tsar of All the Russias.” Although&nbsp;the name is thus correctly applied, both in English and Russian,&nbsp;to the whole area of the Russian empire, its application is&nbsp;often limited, no less correctly, to European Russia, or even to&nbsp;European Russia exclusive of Finland and Poland. The use of&nbsp;the name in its most comprehensive sense dates only from the&nbsp;expansion of the empire in the 19th century; to the historian&nbsp;who writes of the earlier growth of the empire, Russia means, at&nbsp;most, Russia in Europe, or Muscovy, as it was usually called&nbsp;until the 18th century, from Moscow, its ancient capital.&nbsp;The origin of the term “ Russia ” has been much disputed.&nbsp;It is certainly derived, through </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rossiya,</span><span class="font1"> from Slavonic&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rus</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ros</span><span class="font1"> (Byzantine *P£s or ’Póaot), a name first given&nbsp;to the Scandinavians who founded a principality on the&nbsp;Dnieper in the 9th century; and afterw’ards extended to&nbsp;the collection of Russian states of which this principality&nbsp;formed the nucleus. The word </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rus,</span><span class="font1"> in former times wrongly&nbsp;connected with the tribal name Rhoxolani, is more probably&nbsp;derived from </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ruotsi^</span><span class="font1"> a Finnish name for the Swedes, which&nbsp;seems to be a corruption of the Swedish </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rothsmenn<sub>}</sub></span><span class="font1"> “ rowers ”&nbsp;or “ seafarers.”</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
