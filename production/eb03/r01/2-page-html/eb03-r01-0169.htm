<p><span class="font1">By his raiſing others, and particulary by riſing himſelf, from the dead, our Saviour demonſtrated that a re-ſurrection from the dead is poſſible. And on that au-thority, which by his miracles he proved to be divine, he declared to his followers, that there is to be a gene-ral reſurection both of the juſt and of the unjuſt, in-ſtructing his difciples to propagate this doctrine through&nbsp;all nations ; St Paul confeſſing, that if there be no refur-rection of the dead, preaching is vain, and our faith is&nbsp;vain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As to the order of fucceſſion in which the dead are to be raiſed, the Scriptures are almoſt filent. St Paul&nbsp;fays, that every man is to riſe in his own order, and&nbsp;that the dead in Chriſt are to riſe firſt: and St John ob-ſerved in his viſion, that the fouls of them which were&nbsp;beheaded for the witneſs of Jeſus, and for the word of&nbsp;God, and which had not worſhipped the beaſt, neither&nbsp;his image, neither had received his mark upon their&nbsp;foreheads, or in their hapds, lived and reigned with&nbsp;Chriſt a thouſand years ; but the reſt of the dead lived&nbsp;not again until the thouſand years (γ) were finiſhed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A queſtion that has much oftener agitated the minds of men is, with what fort of bodies are the dead to be&nbsp;raifed ? St Paul has anſwered, with incorruptible and&nbsp;immortal bodies (z). And to ſilence the diſputatious&nbsp;caviller of his day, he illuſtrated his doctrine by the&nbsp;growth of grain. &quot; Thou fool (ſaid he), that which&nbsp;thou ſoweſt, thou ſoweſt not that body that ſhall be,&nbsp;but bare grain, it may chance of wheat or of ſome other&nbsp;grain.” To us it appears very ſurpriſing, that any one&nbsp;who reads this paſſage with the ſlighteſt attention,&nbsp;ſhould perplex himſelf, or diſturb the church with idle&nbsp;attempts to prove the identity of the bodies with which&nbsp;we ſhall die and riſe again at the laſt day. The apoſtle&nbsp;expreſsly affirms, that &quot; fleſh and blood cannot inherit&nbsp;the kingdom of God; that we ſhall all be changed, in a&nbsp;moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the laſt trump ;&nbsp;that there are celeſtial bodies and bodies terreſtrial ; and&nbsp;that the glory of the celeſtial is one, and the glory of&nbsp;the terreſtrial another,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">'Γhat this implies a total change of qualities, will admit of no diſpute ; but ſtill it has been conſidered as an article of the Chriſtian faith, that we ate to rife with the&nbsp;ſame bodies in reſpect of ſubſtance. what is meant by&nbsp;the identity of ſubſtance, with qualities wholly different,&nbsp;it is not very eaſy to conceive. Perhaps the meaning&nbsp;may be, that our incorruptible bodies ſhall conſiſt oſ the&nbsp;ſame material particles with our mortal bodies, though&nbsp;theſe particles will be differently arranged to produce&nbsp;the different qualities. But as the particles of our&nbsp;preſent bodies are conſtantly changing, and as different&nbsp;particles compoſe the body atdiffeιent times, a queſtion&nbsp;has been put, with what ſet of particles ſhall we riſe?&nbsp;Here a ſingular variety of opinions have been held.&nbsp;Some * contend, that we ſhall riſe with the original&nbsp;ſtamina of our bodies derived from our parents ; ſome&nbsp;are for riſing with that ſet of particles which they had&nbsp;at birth ; ſome with the ſet which they are to have at&nbsp;death ; and ſome with the particles which remain after&nbsp;maceration in water')-; though, God knows, that if this&nbsp;maceration be continued long, theſe may ariſe with few&nbsp;or no particles at all. Another query has given much&nbsp;alarm, what if any of theſe particles ſhould enter a&nbsp;vegetable, compoſe its fruit, and be eaten by a man,&nbsp;woman, or a child ? WÎ11 not a diſpute, ſimilar to that&nbsp;apprehended by the Sadducees about the wife of the&nbsp;ſeven brothers, neceffarily follow, whoſe particles are&nbsp;they to be at the reſurrection ? Againſt this confuſion,&nbsp;they truſt that the goodnefs and wiſdom of heaven will&nbsp;take all the proper and neceffary meaſures ; and they&nbsp;even venture to point out a way in which that may be&nbsp;done. A foot deep of earth, they obſerve, in two or&nbsp;three of the counties of England, ſuppoſing each&nbsp;perſon to weigh on an average about ſeven ſtones and&nbsp;a few pounds, would amply ſupply with material bodies&nbsp;600,000,000 oſ fouls for no leſs a ſpace than 2 3,000&nbsp;years § ; and therefore there ſeems to be no neceffity ſor&nbsp;the vamping up of their old materials to lodge and accommodate new fouls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But, unluckily here, the queſtion is not about the poſſibility of keeping the particles of different bodies&nbsp;ſeparate and diſtinct. The queſtion is rather, what have&nbsp;the Scriptures determined on the ſubject ? Now the&nbsp;Scriptures ſay, that the ſpirit returns unto God who&nbsp;gave it. And ſhould it be aſked, in what place does he&nbsp;reſerve it till the reſurrection ? the Scriptures reply, in&nbsp;the place of the dead ; becaufe the foul deſcends into&nbsp;the pit, is redeemed from the grave ; and the ſting of&nbsp;death, the laſt enemy that is to be deſtroyed, ſhall be&nbsp;taken away when the trumpet of God ſhall found : at&nbsp;which time the dead that ſleep in their graves ihall&nbsp;awake, ſhall hear the voice, and ſhall come forth.&nbsp;There is not here ſo much as a word concerning the&nbsp;body ; and therefore it was aſked with what bodies&nbsp;are the dead to be raiſed ? To which it was anſwered,&nbsp;the vile body is to be changed. The body which is, is&nbsp;not the body which ſhall be ; for the incorruptible muſt&nbsp;put on incorruption, and that which is mortal, put on&nbsp;immortality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This curious diſcovery of the ſentiments of Scripture we owe to a lay-man, the celebrated Locke ; who, in&nbsp;one of his controversies with the biſhop of worceſter,&nbsp;came to underſtand what he knew not before, namely,&nbsp;that nowhere have the Scriptures fpoken of the reſurrection oi the ſame body in the ſenſe in which it is uſu-ally conceived. The reſurrection of the ſame perſon is&nbsp;indeed promifed ; and how that promiſe maybe fπlfill-ed, notwithſtanding the conſtant change of the particles&nbsp;of the body, has been ſhown in another place. See&nbsp;Metaphysics, Part III. Chap. iii.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The advocatcs, therefore, for the refurrection of the mortal body, have again been obliged to betake them-ſelves to the lhifts of reaſoning. It is proper, ſay they,</span></p><div>

<p><span class="font1">(z) our Saviour rofe with the ſame body, both as to ſubſtance and qualities ; becauſe it was nefceſſary that his perfon ſhould be known and identified after his reſurrection.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
