Under Fyzoola Khan, one of the eons of Aly Mohammed, the country was in a most&nbsp;flourishing condition ; and several of the Rohilla chiefs resided in each of the large towns, where they lived in a&nbsp;princely and hospitable manner, and gave every protection&nbsp;and encouragement to the farmers, so that the revenue&nbsp;amounted to a million sterling ; but under the waste and&nbsp;ruin of this cruel invasion the revenue decreased in the&nbsp;course of twenty years to L.400,000, and the country went&nbsp;gradually to ruin. The country was transferred to the British in 1801, and is now governed by a civil establishment&nbsp;of officers stationed at Bareilly.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">ROLLI, Paul, an Italian poet, was born at Rome in 1687. He was the son of an architect, and a pupil of the&nbsp;celebrated Gravina, who inspired him with a taste for learning and poetry. An intelligent and learned English peer,&nbsp;having brought him to London, introduced him to the royal&nbsp;family as a master of the Tuscan language. Rolli remained&nbsp;in England till the death of Queen Caroline his protectress,&nbsp;and the patroness of literature in general. He returned to&nbsp;Italy in 1747, where he died in 1767, in the eightieth year&nbsp;of his age, leaving behind him a very curious collection in&nbsp;natural history, with a valuable and well-chosen library.&nbsp;His principal works first appeared in London in 1735 in&nbsp;8vo. They consist of odes in blank verse, elegies, songs,&nbsp;and other poems, after the manner of Catullus. A collection&nbsp;of his epigrams was printed at Florence in 1776, in 8vo, to&nbsp;which is prefixed an account of his life by Fondini. What&nbsp;Martial said of his own collection may be said of this, “ that&nbsp;there are few good, but many indifferent or bad pieces in&nbsp;it.” Rolli, however, bore the character of one of the best&nbsp;Italian poets of his age. During his stay in London he&nbsp;procured editions of several authors of his own country.&nbsp;The principal of these were the Satires of Ariosto, the burlesque works of Berni, Varchi, &amp;c. two vols, in 8vo ; the&nbsp;Decameron of Boccace, 1727, in 4to and folio, in which he&nbsp;has faithfully copied the celebrated and valuable edition&nbsp;published by the Juntas in 1527 ; and, lastly, of the elegant Lucretia of Marchetti, which was printed at London&nbsp;in 1717, in 8vo, through the influence and attention of Rolli.&nbsp;This edition is beautiful ; but the work is thought to be of&nbsp;a pernicious tendency. He likewise translated into Italian&nbsp;verse the Paradise Lost of Milton, printed at London in&nbsp;folio in 1735 ; and the Odes of Anacreon, London, 1739,&nbsp;in 8 vo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROLLIN, Charles, a celebrated French writer, was the son of a cutler at Paris, and was born there on the 30th&nbsp;of January 1661. He studied at the College du Plessis, in&nbsp;which he obtained an exhibition through the interest of a&nbsp;Benedictine monk whom he had served at table, and who&nbsp;discovered in him some marks of genius. Here he acquired&nbsp;the regard of M Gobinet, principal of the college, who had&nbsp;a particular esteem for him. After having studied humanity and philosophy, he applied to divinity three years at&nbsp;the Sorbonne ; but he did not prosecute this study, and was&nbsp;satisfied with obtaining the tonsure. He afterwards became&nbsp;professor of rhetoric in his own college; and in 1688 succeeded Horsan, his master, as professor of eloquence in the&nbsp;Royal College. No man ever exercised the functions of it&nbsp;with greater eclat ; he often made Latin orations to celebrate the memorable events of the times, and frequently&nbsp;accompanied them with poems, which were generally read&nbsp;and esteemed. In 1694 he was chosen rector of the university, and he continued in that office two years, which&nbsp;was then a mark of distinction. By virtue of lιis office, he&nbsp;spoke the annual panegyric upon Louis XIV. He made&nbsp;many very useful regulations in the university ; and particularly revived the study of the Greek language, which was&nbsp;then much neglected. He substituted academical exercises&nbsp;in the place of tragedies ; and introduced the practice which&nbsp;had been formerly observed, of causing the students to get&nbsp;by heart passages of Scripture. He wεfe a man of indefatigable application, and trained innumerable persons, who did&nbsp;honour to the church, the state, and the army. The first&nbsp;president Portail was pleased one day to reproach Rollin in&nbsp;a jocular strain, as if he exceeded even himself in doing&nbsp;business ; to whom Rollin replied, with that plainness and&nbsp;sincerity which was natural to him, “ It becomes you well,&nbsp;sir, to reproach me with this ; it is this habit of labour in&nbsp;me which has distinguished you in the place of advocate-general, which has raised you to that of first president ; you&nbsp;owe the greatness of your fortune to me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Upon tile expiration of the rectorship, Cardinal Noailles engaged him to superintend tile studies of his nephews, who&nbsp;were in the College of Laon ; and in this office he was agreeably employed, when, in 1699, he was with great reluctance&nbsp;made coadjutor to the principal of the College of Beauvais.&nbsp;This college was then a kind of desert, inhabited by very&nbsp;few students, and without any regular discipline ; but Rol-lin’s great industry soon repeopled it, and raised it to that&nbsp;credit which it long retained. In this situation he continued till 1712 ; when the war between the Jesuits and the&nbsp;Jansenists drawing towards a crisis, he fell a sacrifice to&nbsp;the prevalence of the former. Father le Tellier, the king’s&nbsp;confessor, a furious agent of the Jesuits, infused into his&nbsp;master prejudices against Rollin, whose connection witll&nbsp;Cardinal de Noailles would alone have sufficed to make&nbsp;him a Jansenist ; and on this account he lost his share&nbsp;in the principality of Beauvais. No man, however, could&nbsp;thus have suffered a smaller loss than Rollin, who had&nbsp;every thing left that was necessary to make him happy ;&nbsp;retirement, books, and enough for his support. He now&nbsp;began to be employed upon Quinctilian ; an author whom&nbsp;he justly valued, and could not without uneasiness see neglected. He retrenched in him w hatever he thought rather&nbsp;curious than useful for the instruction of youth ; he placed&nbsp;summaries or contents at the head of each chapter, and he&nbsp;accompanied the text with short and select notes. His edition appeared in 1715, in two vols. 12mo, with an elegant&nbsp;preface explaining his method and view's.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1710, the university of Paris, willing to have a head suitable to the importance of their interests in a very critical conjuncture of affairs, chose Rollin again rector; but he&nbsp;was displaced in about two months by a lettre de cachet.&nbsp;The university had presented to the parliament a petition,&nbsp;in which it protested against taking any part in the adjustment of the late disputes ; and their being congratulated&nbsp;in a public oration by Rollin on this step, occasioned the&nbsp;letter, which ordered them to choose a rector of more moderation. Whatever the university might suffer by the removal of Rollin, the public was probably a gainer ; for he&nbsp;now applied himself to the composition of his Treatise on&nbsp;the Manner of Studying and Teaching the Belles Lettres,&nbsp;which was published in octavo, two volumes in 1726, and&nbsp;two more in 1728.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This work, though greatly deficient in order, and displaying neither depth nor philosophy, has been exceedingly successful ; and its success encouraged its author to undertake another work of equal use and entertainment ; his&nbsp;“ Ancient History of the Egyptians, Carthaginians, Assyrians, Babylonians, Medes and Persians, Macedonians, and&nbsp;Greeks,” which he finished in thirteen volumes 8vo, and&nbsp;published between 1730 and 1738. Voltaire, after having&nbsp;observed that Rollin was “ the first member of the university of Paris who wrote French with dignity and correctness,” says of this work, that “ though the last volumes,</span></p>
