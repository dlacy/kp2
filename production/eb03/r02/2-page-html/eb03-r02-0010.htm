<p><span class="font0">has been mortal, but the pain ceaſes after a few days duration. The natives formerly made their flutes of&nbsp;this tree, becauſe it has a great deal of pith. Some&nbsp;people aſſured me, that a perſon ſuffering from its noi-ſome exhalations, would eaſily recover by ſpreading a&nbsp;mixture of the wood burnt to charcoal, and hog’s lard,&nbsp;upon the ſwelled parts. Some aſſerted, that they had&nbsp;really tried this remedy. In ſome places this tree is&nbsp;rooted out, on purpoſe that its poiſon may not affect&nbsp;the workmen.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">In order to give our readers an idea of the manner in which this curious and valuable branch of manufactures is managed, a view of the ribbon-weaver at </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">I1I3 </span><span class="font0">loom is repreſented in Plate CCCCXXXV. where,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">I. </span><span class="font0">Is the frame of the loom. 2. The caſtle, containing 48 pulleys. 3. The branches, on which the pulleys turn. 4. The tires, or the riding-cords, which run&nbsp;on the pulleys, and pull up the high-liſſes. 5. The&nbsp;liſt-ſticks, to which the high-liſſes are tied. 6. The&nbsp;high-liſſes, or lifts, are a number of long threads, with&nbsp;platines, or plate-leads, at the bottom ; and ringlets, or&nbsp;loops, about their middle, through which the cords or&nbsp;crols-threads of the ground-harneſs ride. 7. The plate-leads, or platines, are flat pieces of lead, of about ſix&nbsp;inches long, and three or four inches broad at the top,&nbsp;but round at the bottom ; ſome uſe black ſlates inſtead&nbsp;of them : their uſe is to pull down thoſe liſſes which the&nbsp;workman had railed by the treddle, after his foot is taken off. 8. The branches or cords of the ground har-neſs, which go thro’ the loops in the middle of the high-liſſes : on the well-ordering of theſe- cords chiefly depends the art of ribbon-weaving, becauſe it is by means&nbsp;of this contrivance that the weaver draws in the thread&nbsp;or ſilk that makes the flower, and rejects or excludes&nbsp;the reſt. 9. The batton : this is the wooden frame&nbsp;that holds the reed or ſhuttle, and beats or cloſes the&nbsp;work : where, obſerve, that the ribbon-weaver does not&nbsp;beat his work ; but as ſoon as the ſhuttle is paſſed, and&nbsp;his hand is taken away, the batton is forced, by a ſpring&nbsp;from the top, to beat the work cloſe. 10. The ſhuttle,&nbsp;or reed. 11. The ſpring of the batton, by which it&nbsp;is made to cloſe the work. 12. The long-harneſs are&nbsp;the front-reeds, by which the figure is raiſed. 13. The&nbsp;linguas are the long pieces of round or ſquare lead,&nbsp;tied to the end of each thread of the long-harneſs to&nbsp;keep them tight. 14. The broad piece of wood, about&nbsp;a foot ſquare, leaning ſomewhat forward, intended to&nbsp;eaſe the weaver as he ſtoops to his ſhuttle ; it is fixed&nbsp;in the middle of the breaſt-beam. Some weavers, inſtead of this, have a contrivance of a cord or rope that&nbsp;is faſtened to the front-frame, and comes acroſs his&nbsp;breaſt ; this is called a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ſlopfall.</span><span class="font0"> 15. The feat-bench ;&nbsp;this leans forward very much. 16. The foot-ſtep to&nbsp;the treddles. 17. The breaſt-beam, being a croſs-bar&nbsp;that paſſes from one of the ſtandards to the other, fo&nbsp;as to front the workman’s breaſt : to this breaſt-bar is&nbsp;fixed a roll, upon which the ribbon paſſes in its way to&nbsp;be rolled upon the roller, that turns a little below. 18.&nbsp;The clamps, or pieces of wood, in which the broaches&nbsp;that confine the treddles reſt. 19. The treddles are long&nbsp;narrow pieces of wood, to the ends of which the cords&nbsp;that move the liſſes are faſtened. 20. The treddle-cords&nbsp;are only diſtinguiſhed from the riding-cords by a board&nbsp;full of holes, which divide them, in order to prevent the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">plate-leads, which are tied to the high-liſſes, from pulling them too high when the workman’s foot is off the treddle : which flop is made by a knot in the treddle-cord, too big to be forced through that hole in the&nbsp;board. 21. The lames are two pieces of thin narrow&nbsp;boards, only uſed in plain works, and then to ſupply&nbsp;the place of the long-harneſs. 22. The knee-roll, by&nbsp;which the weaver rolls up his ribbon as he ſees proper, or by bit and bit as it is finiſhed. 23. The back-rolls, on which the warp is rolled. It is to be ob-ſerved, that there is always as many rolls as colours&nbsp;in the work to be wove. 24. The damps, which ſup-port the rollers. 25. The returning-flicks, or, as&nbsp;others call them, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">returns,</span><span class="font0"> or the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">tumblers,</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">pulleys,</span><span class="font0"> to which the tiers are tied, to clear the courſe&nbsp;of cords through the high-liſſes. 26. The catch-board&nbsp;for the tumblers. 27. The tire-board. 28. The buttons for the knee-rolls and treddle board, deſcribed in&nbsp;number 20.</span></p>
