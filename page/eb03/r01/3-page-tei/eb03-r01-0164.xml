Among the Scandinavians, a natural death was attended with infamy, while a violent death, particularly in battle, gave a title to ſit in the halls of odin, and to quaff beer from the ikulls of enemies. Among the Tlaſcalans, it was only the great that were permitted . to animate birds and the nobler quadrupeds ; the lower ranks were transformed into weaſels, into paultry beetles, and fuch mean animals. Among the Mexicans, thoſe who were drowned, who died of a dropſy, tumors, or wounds, or ſuch like diſeaſes, went along with the children that had been ſacriſiced to the god of water, and in a cool and delightful place were allowed to indulge in delicious repaſts and varieties of pleaſures: thoſe who died of other diſeaſes, were ſent to the north or centre of the earth, and were under the dominion of the gods ot darkneſs. " Tlie loldiers who died in battle, or in captivity among their enemies, and the women who died in labour, went to the houſe of the fun, who was confidered as the prince of glory. In his manſions they led a life of endleſs delight-. Every day the foldiers, on the firſt appearance of his rays, hailed his birth with rejoicings and with dancings, and the muſic of inſtruments and voices. At his meridian they met with the women, and in like feſtivity accompanied him to his ſetting. After four years of this glorious life, they went to animate clouds, and birds of beautiful feathers and of ſweet ſong.; but always at liberty to rile again, if they pleaſed, to heaven, or deſcend to the earth, to warble their ſongs, and to fuck flowers*.”</p><p>Thefe ſentiments of a future ſtate, conceived in a ſavage and a rude period, could not long prevail among an enlightened and civilized people, when the times of rapine and violence therefore began to ceaſe ; when fo-cieties regulated by certain laws began to be eſtabliſhed ; when martial prowefs was leſs requisite, and the qualities of the heart had begun to give an importance to the character, the future ſtate was alſo modelled on a different plan. In the Æneid of virgil, an author of a highly cultivated mind, and of poliſhed manners, it becomes a place of the moſt impartial and unerring Juſtice ; every one now receives a ſentence ſuited to the actions of his paſt life, and a god is made to preſide in judgment ;</p><p>who hears and judges each committed crime,</p><p>Inquires into the manner, place, and time.</p><p>The confciou<hi rend="sup">,</hi>s wretch muſt all his acts reveal,</p><p>Loth to confeſs, unable to conceal,</p><p>From the firſt moment of his vital breath,</p><p>To the laſt hour of unrepenting death.</p><p>The ſpirſts of the dead no longer mingle toge-ther-as in the leſs enlightened period of Homer ·; the vicious are difmiffed to a place of torments, the virtuous ſent to regions of blifs : indifferent characters are confined to a limbus *.; and thoſe who are too virtuous for hell, but too much polluted with the ſtains of vice to enter heaven without preparation, are for fome time detained- ijr a purgatory.</p><p>For there are various penances enjoin’d,</p><p>And ſome are hung to bleach upon the wind ?</p><p>Same plung’d in waters, others purg’d in fires,</p><p>Till all the dregs are drain’d, and ruſt expires ;</p><p>Till nothing’s left of their habitual ſtams,</p><p>But the pure ether of the foul remains.</p><p>⅜</p><p>when thus purified, they become fitted to receive the rewards of their paſt virtues, and now enter into thoſe regions of happineſs and joy.</p><p>AVith ether veſted, and a purple ſky,</p><p>The bliſsful ſeats of happy fouls below,</p><p>Stars of their own, and their own funs they know ♦ where patriots live, who, for their country’s good, -In fighting fields were prodigal of blood.</p><p>•Prieſts of unblemiſh’d lives here make abode,</p><p>A nd poets worthy their inſpiring god ;</p><p>A,nd ſearehing wits, of more mechanic parts, who grac’d their age with new-invented arts :</p><p>Thofe who to worth their bounty did extei¢d ;</p><p>And thoſe who knew that bounty to commend.</p><p>Theſe good men are engaged in various amuſements, according to the taſte and genius of each.

Some na-tions, as thoſe of India, have fancied a number of hea-vens and hells, correſponding to fome of their principal ſhadea in virtue and vice ; and have ſilled each of theſe places refpectively with all the fceπes of happineſs and mifery, which friendſhip and hatred, admiration, coh-tempt, or rancour, could ſuggeſt, But haring already obſerved the progreſs of the human mind in forming the grand and leading ideas of a future ſtate, we mean not to deſcend to the modifications which may haye occurred tq particular nations, ſects, or individuals.</p><p>The belief ot Chrilliaus respecting futurity demands our attention, as being founded on a different principle, namely, on expreſs revelations from heaven.
