<p><span class="font0">the Windham lunacy case in 1861, and in the action of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Saurin</span><span class="font0"> v. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Starr</span><span class="font0"> in 1869. In 1865 he argued in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ex parte</span><span class="font0"> Chavasse before&nbsp;Lord Westbury, L.C., and soon afterwards was honoured by him&nbsp;with the offer of a county court judgeship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1872 Russell took “ silk/* and from that date for some time he divided the best leading work of the circuit with Holker,&nbsp;Herschell and Pope. In 1874 Holker became solicitor-general in the Conservative administration.- In 1880 Herschell&nbsp;accepted the same office in a Liberal ministry, and about the&nbsp;same time Pope practically left the circuit, to become in a short&nbsp;time one of the most successful advocates at the parliamentary&nbsp;bar. Russell’s success as a Q.C. during this period of his career&nbsp;was prodigious. He excelled in the conduct alike of commercial cases and of those involving, as he used to say, “ a&nbsp;human interest,” although undoubtedly it was the latter which&nbsp;more attracted him. He was seen to the least advantage in&nbsp;cases which involved technical or scientific detail. If his&nbsp;advocacy suffered a defeat, however, it was never an inglorious&nbsp;defeat. Those who were on the Northern Circuit at the time&nbsp;will not easily forget the case of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dixon</span><span class="font0"> v. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Plimsoll—</span><span class="font0">a libel action&nbsp;brought by a Liverpool shipowner against Mr S. Plimsoll—tried&nbsp;before Baron Amphlett and a Liverpool special jury, in which&nbsp;Holker won a notable victory for the defendant; or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Nuttall v.&nbsp;Wilde,</span><span class="font0"> a breach of promise action, in which Pope led brilliantly&nbsp;for the successful plaintiff, and Russell’s speech for the defence&nbsp;was one of the finest in point of passion and pathos that was&nbsp;ever heard upon the Northern Circuit. At the same time, with&nbsp;all his fighting power, Russell was eminently a sagacious adviser.&nbsp;No barrister knew better how and when to settle a case, where&nbsp;the client’s true interest called for a settlement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1880 a new phase of Russell’s arduous life began. He was returned to parliament as an independent Liberal member&nbsp;for Dundalk, a constituency which he had twice before unsuccessfully contested. From that time forward until his&nbsp;appointment to a lordship of appeal in succession to Lord&nbsp;Bowen in 1894, he sat in the House of Commons: for Dundalk&nbsp;until 1885, and afterwards for South Hackney, where he was&nbsp;returned as the Liberal member on four successive occasions—&nbsp;once in 1885, twice in 1886, and again in 1892. The entrance&nbsp;into parliament laid upon Russell’s time and labour a heavy&nbsp;additional tax. His was a nature which could not, in work or&nbsp;even in pleasure, be content to do anything lightly or by halves.&nbsp;He was essentially a man of action; intensity—at times almost&nbsp;fierce intensity—both of purpose and of devotion to its fulfilment characterized everything he did. Upon such a man&nbsp;parliamentary life between 1880 and 1894 necessarily entailed&nbsp;a severe strain. During the whole of this epoch, in home affairs,&nbsp;Irish business almost monopolized the political stage; and&nbsp;Russell was Irish to the core. From 1880 to 1886, as a private&nbsp;member, and as the attorney-general in Mr Gladstone’s administrations of 1886 and 1892, he worked in and out of parliament for the Liberal policy in regard to the treatment of Ireland&nbsp;as few men except Russell could or would work. He never&nbsp;spared himself. After a long day in the turmoil of the courts,&nbsp;he cheerfully gave a long evening to a distant and often, from&nbsp;the standpoint of personal notoriety, an obscure, platform.&nbsp;His position throughout was clear and consistent. Before&nbsp;1886 on several occasions he supported the action of the Irish&nbsp;Nationalist party. He opposed coercion, voted for compensation for disturbance, advocated the release of political prisoners&nbsp;and voted for the Maamtrasna inquiry. He wrote to the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Daily&nbsp;Telegraph</span><span class="font0"> a series of letters on the Irish land question, which&nbsp;were afterwards published (1889) in a collected form. But he&nbsp;never became a member of the Irish Home Rule or of the&nbsp;Pamellite party; he was elected at Dundalk as an independent&nbsp;Liheral, and such he remained. He was proud of the kingdom&nbsp;in whose might and glory Ireland could claim so large a part;&nbsp;and when, as attorney-general in the Gladstone administration,&nbsp;he warmly advocated the establishment of a subordinate parliament in Ireland, he did so because he sought the amelioration&nbsp;and not the destruction of Ireland’s relations with the rest of&nbsp;that kingdom. “ I am absolutely opposed,” he said </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">{The Life&nbsp;of Lord Russell of Killowen,</span><span class="font0"> p. 194) to the South Hackney&nbsp;voters, “ to separation; but, reserving imperial control on all&nbsp;imperial questions, I think Irishmen on Irish soil should have&nbsp;the power of dealing in the way which seems best to them&nbsp;with all questions that concern them.” It is impossible to&nbsp;say that Russell’s success in the House of Commons,&nbsp;considerable as it was, was comparable to his success as an&nbsp;advocate in the courts of justice. He was listened to, always&nbsp;with respect and often with admiration, but he was not made&nbsp;for a debater; and the position of a law officer has generally&nbsp;not proved favourable to the attainment of parliamentary&nbsp;eminence. In great public affairs the law officer advises and&nbsp;supports, but not for him is the glory of initiating public policy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Russell’s parliamentary duties, fully as he discharged them, first as a private member and afterwards as attorney-general,&nbsp;were not allowed by him to obstruct his professional career.&nbsp;He rapidly became in London what he was already in Lancashire, the favourite leader in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">nisi prius</span><span class="font0"> actions. The list of&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">causes célèbres</span><span class="font0"> in the period 1880-94 is really a record of&nbsp;Russell’s cases, and, for a great part, of Russell’s victories.&nbsp;The best known of the exceptions from the latter category&nbsp;was the libel action </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Belt</span><span class="font0"> v. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lawes</span><span class="font0"> in 1882, which, after a trial&nbsp;before Baron Huddleston and a special jury lasting more than&nbsp;forty days, resulted in a verdict for the plaintiff, for whom&nbsp;Sir Hardinge Giffard (afterwards Lord Chancellor Halsbury)&nbsp;appeared as leading counsel. The triumph of his client in&nbsp;the Colin Campbell divorce suit in 1886 afforded perhaps the&nbsp;most brilliant instance of Russell’s forensic capacity in private&nbsp;litigation. His fees in 1885, the year before he became attorney-general, amounted to nearly £17,000. More important, however,&nbsp;as well as more famous, than any of his successes in the ordinary&nbsp;courts of law during this period were his performances as an&nbsp;advocate in two public transactions of mark in British history.&nbsp;The first of these in point of date was the Parnell Commission&nbsp;of 1888-90, in which Sir Charles Russell appeared as leading&nbsp;counsel for Mr Parnell. The commission held its first sitting&nbsp;on the 22nd of October 1888, and presented its report in February 1890. In April 1889, after 63 sittings of the commission,&nbsp;in the course of which 340 witnesses had been examined, Sir&nbsp;Charles Russell, who had already destroyed the chief personal&nbsp;charge against Mr Parnell by a brilliant cross-examination, in&nbsp;which he proved it to have been based upon a forgery, made&nbsp;his great opening speech for the defence. It lasted several&nbsp;days, and concluded on the 12th of April. This speech, besides&nbsp;its merit as a wonderful piece of advocacy, possesses permanent&nbsp;value as an historical survey of the Irish question during the&nbsp;last century, from the point of view of an Irish Liberal. It&nbsp;was in the same year published after careful revision by its&nbsp;author (1889). The second public transaction was the Bering&nbsp;Sea Arbitration, held in Paris in 1893. Sir Charles Russell,&nbsp;then attorney-general, with Sir Richard Webster (afterwards&nbsp;Lord Alverstone, L.C.J.), w’as the leading counsel for Great&nbsp;Britain. Russell, in the course of his very powerful argument&nbsp;before the tribunal, maintained the proposition, which he again&nbsp;handled in his Saratoga address to the American Bar Association&nbsp;in 1896, that “ international law is neither more nor less than&nbsp;what civilized nations have agreed shall be binding on one&nbsp;another as international law.” The award was, substantially,&nbsp;in favour of Great Britain. In recognition of their distinguished&nbsp;services, the queen bestowed upon both the leading representatives of Great Britain the honour of the grand cross of&nbsp;St Michael and St George.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1894 Russell’s career as an advocate ended. A judgeship, if he had wished it, had been within his reach twelve years&nbsp;before. In 1894, on the death of Lord Bowen, he accepted&nbsp;the position of a lord of appeal. A month later he was appointed&nbsp;lord chief justice of England in succession to Lord Coleridge,&nbsp;to whose memory he devoted in the following September a paper&nbsp;in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">North American Review.</span><span class="font0"> To the discharge of his functions as a judge Russell brought with him all the qualities of&nbsp;intellect and character which had made him so eminent as an&nbsp;advocate, and their greatness was not less conspicuous in his</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
