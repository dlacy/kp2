of the work naturally led him to seek the acquaintance of its author, who continued one of his most sincere admirers and warmest friends till 1784, when they were separated by the stroke of death.
The first thing that distinguished him after his return to his native country, was a full-length portrait of Commodore Keppel ; which in the polite circles was spoken of in terms of the highest encomium, and testified to what a degree of eminence he had arrived in his profession. This was followed by a portrait of Lord Edgecumbe, and a few Others, which at once introduced him to the first business in portrait-painting ; and that branch of the art he cultivated with such success as will for ever establish his fame with all descriptions of refined society. Having painted some of the first-rate beauties of the age, the polite world flocked to see the graces and the charms of his pencil ; and he soon became the most fashionable painter, not only in England, but in all Europe. He has indeed preserved the resemblance of so many illustrious characters, that we feel the less regret for his having left behind him so few historical paintings ; though what he has done in that way shows him to have been qualified to excel in both departments.@@1 The only landscape, perhaps, which he ever painted, except those beautiful and chaste ones which compose the back grounds of many of his portraits, is a View on the Thames from Richmond, which in 1784 was exhibited by the Society for Promoting Painting and Design in Liverpool.
In 1764 Mr Reynolds had the merit of being the first promoter of that club which, having long existed without a name, became at last distinguished by the appellation of the
Literary Club.
Upon the foundation of the Royal Academy of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture, he was appointed president ; and his acknowledged excellence in his profession made the appointment acceptable to all the lovers of art. To add to the dignity of this new institution, his majesty conferred on the president the honour of knighthood ; and Sir Joshua delivered his first discourse at the opening of the academy on the 2d of January 1769. The merit of that discourse has been universally admitted among painters ; but it contains- some directions respecting the proper mode of prosecuting their studies, to which every student of every art would do well to pay attention. “ I would chiefly recommend,” says he, “ that an implicit obedience to the rules of art, as established by the practice of the great masters, should be exacted from the young students. That those models which have passed through the approbation of ages should be considered by them as perfect and infallible guides ; as subjects for their imitation, not their criticism. I am confident, that this is the only efficacious method of making a progress in the arts ; and that he who sets out with doubting, will find life finished before he becomes master of the rudiments. For it may be laid down as a maxim, that he who begins by presuming on his own sense, has ended his studies as soon as he has commenced them. Every opportunity, therefore, should be taken to discountenance that false and vulgar opinion, that rules are the fetters of genius. They are fetters only to men of no genius ; as that armour which, upon the strong, becomes an ornament and a defence, upon the weak and mishapen turns into a load, and cripples the body which it was made to protect.”
Each succeeding year, on the distribution of the prizes, Sir Joshua delivered to the students a discourse of equal merit with this : and perhaps we do not hazard too much when we say, that, from the whole collected, the lover of belles lettres and the fine arts will acquire juster notions of what is meant by taste in general, and better rules for acquiring a correct taste, than from multitudes of those volumes which have been professedly written on the subject.
In the autumn of 1785 he went to Brussels, where he expended about L.1000 on the purchase of paintings, which, having been taken from the different monasteries and religious houses in Flanders and Germany, were then exposed to sale by the command of the Emperor Joseph. Gainsborough and he had engaged to paint each other’s portrait ; and the canvass for both being actually stretched, Sir Joshua gave one sitting to his distinguished rival ; but, to the regret of every admirer of the art, the unexpected death of the latter prevented all further progress.
In 1790 he was anxiously desirous to procure the vacant professorship of perspective in the academy for Mr Bononi, an Italian architect ; but that artist no* having been yet elected an associate, was of course no academician, and it became necessary to raise him to these situations, in order to qualify him for being a professor. Mr Gilpin being his competitor for tlle associateship, the numbers on the ballot proved equal, when the president by his casting vote decided the election in favour of his friend, who was thereby advanced so far towards the professorship. Soon after this, an academic seat being vacant, Sir Joshua exerted all his influence to obtain it for Mr Bononi ; but finding himself outvoted by a majority of two to one, he quitted the chair with great dissatisfaction, and next day sent to the secretary of the academy a formal resignation of the office, which for twenty-one years he had filled with honour to himself and his country. His indignation, however, subsiding, he suffered himself to be prevailed upon to return to tlle chair, which within a year and a half he was again desirous to quit for a better reason.
Finding a disease of languor, occasioned by an enlargement of the liver, to which he had for some time been subject, increase upon him, and daily expecting the total loss of sight, he wrote a letter to the academy, intimating his intention to resign the office of president on account of bodily infirmities, which disabled him from executing the duties of it to his own satisfaction. The academicians received this intelligence with the respectful concern due to the talents and virtues of their president ; and either then did enter, or designed to enter, into a resolution, honourable to all parties, namely, that a deputation from the whole body of the academy should wait upon him, and inform him
of 
their wish, that the authority and privileges of tlle office of president might be his during his life ; declaring their wil-
