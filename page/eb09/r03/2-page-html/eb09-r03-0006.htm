        <p><span class="font2">contract; for Paul’s derivation of it from </span><span class="font2"
                style="font-style:italic;">stipulum, “</span><span class="font2"> firm,” is much to
                be preferred to the earlier and more fanciful&nbsp;ones from </span><span
                class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">stips</span><span class="font2"> or
                </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">stipula.</span><span
                class="font2"> It was round the stipulation&nbsp;that the jurists grouped most of
                their disquisitions upon&nbsp;the general doctrines of the law of contract,—capacity
                of&nbsp;parties, requisites of consent, consequences of fraud, error,&nbsp;and
                intimidation, effects of conditions and specifications of&nbsp;time, and so forth.
                It may well be said, therefore, that its&nbsp;introduction marked an epoch in the
                history of the law.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">There is, however, no certainty either as to the time or as to the
                manner of its introduction. So far as appears it was unknown at&nbsp;the time of the
                compilation of the XII. Tables, at least in private&nbsp;life ; one of the first
                unmistakable allusions to it is in the Aquilian&nbsp;law of 476 u.c. The mention of
                it in that enactment, however, is&nbsp;with regard to a phase of it which cannot
                have been reached for&nbsp;many years after it had come into use ; and the
                probability is that&nbsp;it originated before the middle of the 5th century, its
                first statutory recognition being in the Silian law introducing the </span><span
                class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">legis actio&nbsp;per condictionem
                {supra,</span><span class="font1"> p. 683). In its earliest days it bore
                the&nbsp;name not of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
                >stipulatio</span><span class="font1"> but of </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">sponsio,</span><span class="font1"> for the reason that
                the interrogatory of the party becoming creditor was invariably formulated&nbsp;with
                the word </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">spondes—c.g., centum
                dare spondes t—</span><span class="font1">while the&nbsp;answer was simply
                </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">spondeo.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">There has been much speculation as to the origin of the contract.
                Modern criticism has three theories,—(1) that it was the verbal remnant of the
                </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">nexum,</span><span
                class="font1"> after the business with the copper&nbsp;and the scales had gone into
                disuse ; (2) that it was evolved out of&nbsp;the oath at the great altar of Hercules
                and the appeal to Fides&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
                >{supra,</span><span class="font1"> p. 675); (3) that it was imported from Latium,
                which it&nbsp;had reached from some of the Greek settlements farther south.&nbsp;The
                last view is the most probable. Verrius Flaccus, as quoted by&nbsp;Festus, connects
                it with the Greek </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
                >anevbeu&gt;</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">airovSn</span><span class="font1"> ; and
                Gaius&nbsp;incidentally observes that it was said to be of Greek origin.
                A&nbsp;libation </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
                >{trirovS-ti)</span><span class="font1"> is frequently referred to by Homer and
                Herodotus&nbsp;as an accompaniment of treaties and other solemn covenants,—&nbsp;a
                common offering by the parties to the gods which imparted&nbsp;sanctity to the
                transaction. Leist@@<sup>1 </sup>is of opinion that the practice&nbsp;passed into
                Sicily and Lower Italy, but that gradually the libation&nbsp;and orher religious
                features were dropped, although the word&nbsp;</span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">airouSg</span><span class="font1"> was retained in the
                sense of an engagement that bound&nbsp;parties just as if the old ritual had been
                observed, and that it&nbsp;travelled northward into Latium and thence to Home under
                the&nbsp;name of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
                >sponsio,</span><span class="font1"> being used in the first instance in public life
                for&nbsp;the conclusion of treaties, and afterwards in private life for the
                conclusion of contracts. The meaning of </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">spondes</span><span class="font1"> as a question by
                a&nbsp;creditor to his debtor (although latterly, we may well believe, unknown to
                them) thus came to be—“Do you engage as solemnly as&nbsp;if the old ceremonial were
                gone through between us?” There are&nbsp;many examples of such simplification of
                terms, none more familiar&nbsp;than when a man says—“I give you my oath upon it,”
                without&nbsp;either himself or the individual addressed thinking it necessary
                to&nbsp;go through the form.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">It is not a little remarkable that, although the idea was derived
                from abroad, the use of the words </span><span class="font2"
                style="font-style:italic;">spondes</span><span class="font2"> and&nbsp;</span><span
                class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">spondeo</span><span class="font2"> in
                contracting were, down at least to the time of&nbsp;Gaius, confined in Rome to Roman
                citizens. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"
                >sponsio&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">as a form of contract was essentially
                </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">juris civilis.</span><span
                class="font2"> So at&nbsp;first were the later and less solemn forms of
                stipulation,—&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">promittisne
                ? promitto, dabisne 1 dabo,</span><span class="font2"> and the like.
                Gaius&nbsp;speaks of these </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">as
                juris gentium, i.e.,</span><span class="font2"> binding even between&nbsp;Romans and
                peregrins. Such they became eventually,&nbsp;but not until towards the end of the
                republic. Yet,&nbsp;although </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"
                >juris civilis,</span><span class="font2"> both the </span><span class="font2"
                style="font-style:italic;">sponsio</span><span class="font2"> and the later
                forms&nbsp;were from the first free from many of the impediments of&nbsp;the earlier
                </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">actus legitimi.</span><span
                class="font2"> No witnesses were required to&nbsp;assist at them; and they were
                always susceptible of qualification by conditions and terms. It was very long,
                however, before parties had much latitude in their choice
                of&nbsp;language</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">;
                spondeo</span><span class="font2"> was so peculiarly solemn that no equivalent could
                be admitted ; and even the later styles may&nbsp;be said to have remained
                stereotyped until well on in the&nbsp;empire. And it was the use of the words of
                style that&nbsp;made the contract. It was formal, not material; that is to&nbsp;say,
                action lay upon the promise the words embodied, apart&nbsp;from any consideration
                whether or not value had been given&nbsp;for it. In time this serious disadvantage
                was abated ; first&nbsp;by introducing in certain cases words that excluded
                action&nbsp;in presence of fraud, antecedent or subsequent, on the part&nbsp;of the
                creditor, and afterwards by praetorian exceptions,&nbsp;such as a plea of “ no
                value,” or by having the contract set&nbsp;aside on the motion of the nominal debtor
                before proceedings had been taken upon it by the creditor. Originally&nbsp;the
                stipulation was employed only in regard to engagements&nbsp;whose terms were in
                every respect definite and certain, and&nbsp;was enforced by the </span><span
                class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">legis actio per condictionem.</span><span
                class="font2"> But in&nbsp;time it came to be employed in engagements that
                were&nbsp;from the first indefinite. This seems to have been due to&nbsp;the
                intervention of the praetors, and to have originated after&nbsp;the system of the
                </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">legis actiones</span><span
                class="font2"> had begun to give place to&nbsp;that </span><span class="font2"

                such a case was not&nbsp;spoken of as a condiction but as an </span><span

                Foreigners.—</span><span class="font2">While it may be admitted that commerce was
                beginning to take&nbsp;root in Rome in the 5th century, yet it was not until
                the&nbsp;6th that it really became of importance. The campaigns&nbsp;in which Rome
                was engaged until the end of the First Punic&nbsp;War absorbed all its energies. But
                after that time the&nbsp;influx of strangers, and their settlement in the city
                for&nbsp;purposes of trade, became very rapid,—first Latins and&nbsp;other allies,
                and afterwards Greeks, Carthaginians, and&nbsp;Asiatics. For them and the regulation
                of their affairs the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">jus
                civile—</span><span class="font2">the law peculiar to Rome and its
                citizens—&nbsp;was applicable only if they were members of allied states&nbsp;to
                which </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">commercium</span><span

                multitudes were not in this favoured position ; and even those who were soon found
                the range of&nbsp;Roman modes of acquiring property and contracting&nbsp;obligations
                too narrow for their requirements. Hence a&nbsp;</span><span class="font2"

                time have been limited to&nbsp;transactions between non-citizens or between citizens
                and&nbsp;non-citizens, but it was eventually accepted in the dealings of citizens
                </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">inter se</span><span
                class="font2"> and became part and parcel of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2"
                style="font-style:italic;">jus Romanorum.</span><span class="font2"> Gaius and
                Justinian speak of it as&nbsp;“ the common law of mankind,” “ the law in use
                among&nbsp;all nations ” ; but the language must not be taken too&nbsp;literally.
                The Roman </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">jus
                gentium</span><span class="font2"> was not built up by&nbsp;the adoption of one
                doctrine or institution after another&nbsp;that was found to be generally current
                elsewhere. In&nbsp;the earliest stages of its recognition it was “an independent
                international private law, which, as such, regulated intercourse between peregrins
                or between peregrins&nbsp;and citizens on the basis of their common </span><span
