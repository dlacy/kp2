<p><span class="font1">ries, feſtorw. </span><span class="font2">foliages, and other ornaments oſ friezes, Demi·relievo&quot;is when one half of the figure riſes from&nbsp;the plane, when, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font2">a baſſo-rehevo, there are parts that&nbsp;ſtand clear out, detached ſrom the reſt, the work is&nbsp;called a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">demid&gt;∏Jfo,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In architecture, the relievo or projecture of the orna-ments ought always to be proportioned to the magnitude of the building it adorns, and to the diſtance at which 'it is to be viewed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Relievo, or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Relief,</span><span class="font2"> in painting, is the degree of bold-nefs with which the figures ſeem, at a due diſtance, to ſtand out from the ground of the painting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The relievo depends much upon thc depth of the ſhadow, and the ſtrength of the light ; or on the&nbsp;height of the different colours, bordering on one another ; and particularly on the difference of the colour&nbsp;of the figure from that of the ground : thus, when&nbsp;the light is fo diſpoſed as to make the neareſt paιts of&nbsp;the figure advance, and is well diffuſed on the maiſes,&nbsp;yet infenſibly diminiſhing, and terminating in a large&nbsp;ſpacious ſhadow, brought off inſenſibly, tbe relievo&nbsp;is ſaid to be bold, and the clair obſcure well under-ſtood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RELIGION (Rf.ltgio), is a Latin word derived, according to Cicero*,from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">rc/egere,</span><span class="font2"> “ to re-confiderſ’but&nbsp;according to Servius and moſt modern grammarians,&nbsp;from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">relιgare,<sup>ti</sup></span><span class="font2">  to bind faſt. <sup>,</sup> lhe reaſon aſſigned by the&nbsp;Roman orator for deducing </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">religio</span><span class="font2"> from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">relego,</span><span class="font2"> is in&nbsp;theſe words, &quot; qui autem omnia, quæ ad cultum deo-rum pertinerent, diligenter retracterent, et tanquam re-legerent, ſunt dicti </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">relifiοfi</span><span class="font2"> ex relegendo.” The reaſon&nbsp;given by Servius ſor his derivation of the word is,&nbsp;“ quod mentem religio religet.” If the Ciceronian&nbsp;etymology be the true one, the word </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">religion</span><span class="font2"> will denote the diligent ſtudy of whatever pertains to the&nbsp;worſhip of the’gods ; but according to the other derivation, which we are inclined to prefer, it denotes that&nbsp;obligation which we feel on our minds from the relation&nbsp;in which we ſtand to feme ſuperior power. In either&nbsp;cafe, the import of the word </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">religion</span><span class="font2"> is different from&nbsp;that of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">theology,</span><span class="font2"> as the former fignifies a number of practical duties, and the latter a ſyſtem of ſpeculative truths.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Theology</span><span class="font2"> is therefore the foundation of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">religion,</span><span class="font2"> or the&nbsp;ſcience from which it ſprings ; for no man can ſtudy&nbsp;-what pertains to the worſhip of ſuperior powers Jill he&nbsp;believe that .ſhch powers exiſt, or feel any obligation on&nbsp;his mind from a relation of which he knows nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This idea ©f religion, as diſtinguiſhed from theo-logy, comprehends the duties not only of thofe more re-fined and complicated ſyſtems of theiſm or polytheiſm which have prevailed among civilized and enlightened&nbsp;nations, ſuch as the polytheiſm of the Greeks and Romans, and the theiſm of the Jews, the Mahometans,&nbsp;and the Chriſtians ; it comprehends every ſentiment of&nbsp;obligation which human beings have ever conceived&nbsp;themſelves under to ſuperior powers, as well as all&nbsp;the forms of worſhip which have ever been practiſed&nbsp;through the world, however fantaſtic, immoral, or abſurd.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">when we turn our eyes to this feature of the human character, we find it peculiarly intereſting. Mankind&nbsp;are diſtinguiſhed from the brutal tribes, and elevated to&nbsp;an higher rank, by the rational and moral faculties with&nbsp;which they are endowed ; but they are ſtiil more widely&nbsp;diſtinguiſhed from the inferior creation, and more highly exalted above them, by being made capable </span><span class="font1">of religi</span><span class="font2">ous notions and religious ſentiments. The ſlighteſt&nbsp;knowledge of hiſtory is ſufficient to inform us, that religion has ever had a powerful influence in moulding&nbsp;the ſentiments and manners of men. It has ſometimes&nbsp;dignified, and ſometimes degraded, the human character. In one region or age it has been favourable to ci-vilization and refinement ; in another, it has occafionally&nbsp;cramped the genius, depraved the morals, and deform-ed the manners of men. The varieties ot religion are&nbsp;innumerable ; and the members of every diſtinct ſect&nbsp;muſt view all who differ from them as more or leſs miſtaken with reſpect to the moſt important concerns of&nbsp;man. Religion ſeems to be congenial to the heart of&nbsp;man ; for wherever human ſociety ſubſiſts, there we are&nbsp;certain of finding religious opinions and ſentiments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It muſt, therefore, be an important fubject of ſpecu-lation to the man and the philoſopher to confider the origin of religion ; to inquire, How far religion in general has a tendency to promote or to injn-e the order and&nbsp;happineſs of ſociety ? and, above all, to examine, what&nbsp;particular religion is beſt calculated to produce an happy&nbsp;influence on human life ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ΛVe ſhall endeavour to give a fatisfactory anſwer to each of thefe queſtions, referving to the article Theology the conſideration of the dogmas of that particular religion which, from our preſent inquiries, ſhall&nbsp;appear to be true, and to have the happieſt influence on&nbsp;human life and manners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I. The foundation of all religion reſts on the belief&nbsp;of the exiſtence of one or more ſuperior beings, who&nbsp;govern the world, and upon whom the happinefs or mi-ſery of mankind ultimately depends. Οί this belief, as&nbsp;it may be faid to have been univerlal, there ſeem to be&nbsp;but three ſources that can be conceived. Either the image&nbsp;of Deity mnſt be ſtamped on the mind of every human&nbsp;being, the ſavage as well as the fage; or the founders of&nbsp;ſocieties, and other eminent perſons, tracing by the efforts&nbsp;of their own reaſon viſible effects to inviſible caufes, muſt&nbsp;have difcovered the exiſtence of ſuperior powers, and&nbsp;communicated the diſcovery to their aſſociates and fol-lowers ; or, laſtly, the univeτfal belief in ſuch powers&nbsp;muſt have been derived by tradition from a primaeval re-velation, communicated to the progenitors ωf the hu-man race.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Οηε or other of theſe hypotheſes muſt be true, becaufe a fourth cannot be framed. But we have elſewhere (Polytheism, n<sup>o</sup> 2.) examined the reaſoning which has been employed to eſtabliſh the firſt, and ſhewn&nbsp;that it proceeds upon falſe notions of human nature,&nbsp;we ſhould likewiſe pronounce it contrary to fact, could&nbsp;we believe, on the authority of ſome of its patrons, who&nbsp;are not aſhamed to contradict one another, that the&nbsp;Kamtſchatkans, and other tribes, in the loweſt ſtate of&nbsp;reaſoning and morals, haVe no ideas whatever of Deity. we proceed, therefore, to conſider the ſecond hypotheſis, which is much more plauſible, and will bear </span><span class="font1">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">ſtricter ſcrutiny.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">That the exiſtence and many oſ the attributes of the Deity are capable of rigid demonſtration, is a truth&nbsp;which cannot be controverted either by the philoſopher&nbsp;or the Chriſtian ; for &quot; the invifible things ot Him from&nbsp;the creation of the world are clearly ſeen, being under-ſtood by the things that are made, even His eternal&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">power and Godhead,” (fee </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Metaphysics,</span><span class="font1"> Part III.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
