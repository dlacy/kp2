But all his oppoſition was vain : they conſtrained him to accept of the proffered dignity ; and he, with his fon Gordian, who was 46 years of age, were declared emperors. Being thus raiſed contrary to his inclination, the old man immediately wrote to the ſenate, declaring that he had unwillingly accepted of the empire, and would only keep his authority till he had freed it from the tyranny of its preſent oppreffor. The ſenate very joyfully confirmed his electron, adjudging Maximinus as an enemy and traitor to the ſtate. The citizens alſo ſhowed an equal zeal in the cauſe : they flew upon ſuch as were the reputed friends of Maximinus, and tore them in pieces ; even ſome who were innocent ſalling a ſacriſice to the multitude’s blind rage. So great an alteration being made in the city againſt the intereſts of Maximinus, the ſenate were reſolved to drive the oppoſition to the extreme ; and accordingly made all neceſſary preparations for their ſecurity, ordering Maximinus’s governors to be diſplaced, and commanding all the provinces to acknowledge Gordian ſor emperor. This order was differently received in different parts, as people were affected to one or the other party : in ſome provinces the governors were ſlain ; in others, the rael-ſengers of the ſenate ; ſo that all parts of the empire felt the conſequences of the civil war.</p><p>In the mean time, when Maximinus was informed of theſe charges againſt him, his rage appeared ungovernable. He roared like a ſavage beaſt, and violently ſtruck his head againſt the wall, ſhowing every inſtance of ungovernable diffraction. At length his ſury being ſomewhat ſubiided, he called his whole army together ; and, in a ſet ſpeech, exhorted them to revenge his cauſe, giving them the ſtrongeſt aſſurances that they ſhould poſſeſs the eſtates of all ſuch as had offended. The ſoldiers uuanimouſly promiſed to be faithful ; they received his harangue with their uſual acclamations ; and, thus encouraged, he led them towards Rome, breathing nothing but ſlaughter and revenge. However, he found many obſtacles to his impetuoſity ; and, though he deſired nothing ſo much as diſpatch, his marches were incommodious and flow. The tumultuous and diſobedient armies of the empire were at preſent very different from the legions that were led on by Sylla or Cæſar ; they were loaded with baggage, and followed by ſlaves and women, rather reſembling an eaſtern caravan, than a military battalion. To theſe inconveniences alſo was added the hatred of the cities through which he paſſed, the inhabitants all abandoning their houſes upon his approach, and ſecuring their proviſions in proper hiding-places. However, in this complication of inconveniences and misfortunes, his affairs began to wear a favourable appearance in Africa : for Capelianus, the governor of Numidia, raiſed a body of troops in his favour, and marched againſt Gordian, towards Carthage ; where he fought the younger Gordian, flew him, and deſtroyed his army. The father, hearing of the death of his ſon, together with the loſs of the battle, ſtrangled himſelf in his own girdle. Capelia-nus purſuing his victory, entered Carthage ; where he gave a looſe to pillage and ſlaughter, under a pretence of revenging the cauſe of Maximinus. The news of theſe ſucceſſes was ſoon brought to the emperor, who now increaſed his diligence, and flattered himſelf with a ſpeedy opportunity of revenge. He led on his large army by haſty journeys into Italy, threatening deſtruction to all his oppoſers, and ardently wiſhing for freſh opportunities of ſlaughter.</p><p>Nothing could exceed the conſternation of the ſenate upon the news of this defeat. They now ſaw themſelves not only deprived of the aſſiſtance of Gordian and his ſon, on whom they greatly relied ; but alſo oppoſed by two formidable tyrants, each commanding a victorious army, directly marching towards Rome, aud meditating nothing but vengeance. In this afflicting exigence, they, with great ſolemnity, met at the temple of Jupiter, and after the moſt mature deliberations, choſe Pupienus and Balbinus emperors conjointly, Theſe were men who had acquired the eſteem of the public both in war and peace, having commanded armies, and governed provinces, with great- reputation ; and being now appointed to oppoſe Maximinus, they made what levies they could, both in Rome and the country. With theſe, Pupienus marched to ſtop the progreſs of the invaders, leaving the city to a freſh and unlooked for calamity. This was occaſioned by two of Maximinus’s ſoldiers, who, entering the ſenate-houſe, were ſlain by two ſenators. This quickly gave offence to the body of the piætorian ſoldiers, who inſtantly reſolved to take revenge, but were oppoſed by the citizens ; ſo that nothing was ſeen throughout Rome, but tumult, ſlaughter, and cruelty. In this univerſal confuſion, the calamity was increaſed by the ſoldiers ſetting the city on fire, while the wretched inhabitants were combating each other in the midſt of the flames.</p><p>Nevertheleſs, Maximinus himſelf, in whoſe favour theſe ſeditions were promoted, did not ſeem to be more fortunate. Upon being informed of the new election of emperors, his fury was again renewed, and he paſſed the Alps, expecting, upon entering Italy, to refreſh his fatigued and famiſhed army in that fertile part of the country. But in this he was entirely diſappointed ; the ſenate had taken ſuch care to remove all kinds of ſuſtenance to fortified places, that he ſtill found himſelf reduced to his former neceſſities, while his army began to murmur for want. To this another diſappointment was added ſhortly after : for approaching the city of Aquileia, which he expected to enter without any difficulty, he was aſtoniſhed to find ſt prepared for the moſt obſtinate reſiſtance, and reſolved to hold out a regular ſiege. This city was well fortified and populous, and the inhabitants greatly averſe to Maximinus’s government ; but what added ſtill more to its ſtrength, it was commanded by two excellent generals, Criſpinus and Menophilis, who had ſo well furniſhed it with men and ammunition, that Maximinus found no ſmall reſiſtance, even in inveſting the place. His firſt attempt was, to take the city by ſtorm ; but the beſieged threw down ſuch quantities of ſcalding pitch and ſulphur upon his ſoldiers, that they were unable to continue the aſſault. He then determined upon a blockade ; but the inhabitants were ſo reſolute, that even the old men and children were ſeen combating upon the walls, while the women cuf off their hair to furniſh the ſoldiers with bow-ſtrings. Maχiminus<hi rend="sup">,</hi>3 rage at this unexpected oppoſition was&gt;</p></body></text></TEI>
