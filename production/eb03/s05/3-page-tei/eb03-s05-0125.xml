They are chiefly tranſlations of ſome essays in the <hi rend="italic">Amanitates Academica,</hi> publiſhed by Linnæus, interſperſed with ſome obſervations and additions of his own. In this volume he ſhows alſo a taſte for claſſical learning, and entertains us with ſome elegant poetical effusions of his own. But his Eſſay on Conversation, publiſhed in the firſt volume of Dodſley’s Collection oſ Poems, entitles him to a diſtinguiſhed rank among our Engliſh poets. This poem is addreſſed to Mr Wyndham, with all that warmth of friendſhip which diſtinguiſhes Mr Stillingfleet. As it is chiefly didactic, it does not admit of ſo many ornaments as ſome compoſitions of other kinds. However, it contains much good ſenſe, ſhows a conſiderable knowledge of mankind, and has ſeveral paſſages that in point of harmony and easy versification would not disgrace the writings of our moſt admired poets. Here more than once Mr Stillingfleet ſhows himſelf ſtill ſore for Dr Bentley’s cruel treatment of him ; and towards the beautiful and moral cloſe of it (where it is ſuppoſed he gives us a sketch of himſelf) ſeems to hint at a mortification of a more delicate nature, which he is ſaid to have ſuffered from the other ſex.</p><p>To theſe diſappointments it was perhaps owing that Mr Stillingfleet neither married nor went into orders. His London residence was at a ſaddler’s in Piccadilly ; where he died in 1771, aged above 70, leaving ſeveral valuable papers behind him. He was buried in St James’s church, without the ſlighteſt monument of his having exiſted.</p><p>STILLINGIA, in botany ; a genus oſ plants belonging to the claſs of <hi rend="italic">monaecia,</hi> and to the order of <hi rend="italic">mοnοdelphia.</hi> The male calyx is hemiſpherical and multiflorous. The corolla is tubulous, and eroſe or gnawed. The female calyx is uniflorous and inferior. The corolla is ſuperior. The ſtyle is trifid, and the capſule three-grained.

In his youth he had been addicted to licentious pleaſures, from which he religiouſly refrained from the moment that he ranked himſelf among philoſophers. When Ptolemy Soter, at the taking of Megara, offered him a large ſum of money, and requeſted that he would accompany him into Egypt, he accepted but a ſmall part of the offer, and retired to the iſland of Ægina, whence, on Ptolemy’s departure, he returned to Megara. That city being again taken by Demetrius the ſon of Antigonus, and the philoſopher required to give an account oſ any effects which he had loſt during the hurry of the plunder, he replied, that he had loſt nothing ; for no one could take from him his learning and eloquence. So great was the fame of Stilpo, that the moſt eminent philoſophers of Athens took pleaſure in attending upon his diſcourſes. His peculiar doctrines were, that ſpecies or univerſals have no real exiſtence, and that one thing cannot be predicated of another. With reſpect to the former of theſe opinions, he ſeems to have taught the same doctrine with the ſect afterwards known by the appellation of <hi rend="italic">Nοminalists.</hi> To prove that one thing cannot be predicated of another, he ſaid, that <hi rend="italic">goodness</hi> and <hi rend="italic">man,</hi> for inſtance, are different things, which cannot be confounded by aſſerting the one to be the other : he argued farther, that goodneſs is an univerſal, and univerſals have no real exiſtence ; conſequentlv, ſince nothing cannot be predicated of any thing, goodneſs cannot be predicated of man. @@Thus, whilſt this ſubtle logician was, through his whole argument, predicating one thing of another, he denied that any one thing could be the accident or predicate of another. If Stilpo was ſerious in this reaſoning ; if he meant any thing more than to expoſe the ſophiſtry of the ſchools, he muſt be confeſſed to have been an eminent maſter of the art of wrangling ; and it was not wholly without reaſon that Glycera, a celebrated courtezan, when ſhe was reproved by him as a corrupter of youth, replied, that the charge might be juſtly retorted upon himſelf, who ſpent his time in filling their heads with sophiſtical quibbles and uſeleſs ſubtleties. In ethics he ſeems to have been a Stoic, and in religion he had a public and a private doctrine, the former for the multitude, and the latter for his friends. He admitted the exiſtence of a ſupreme divinity, but had no reverence for the Grecian ſuperſtitions.</p><p>STILOBATUM, in architecture, denotes the body oſ the pedeſtal of any column.</p><p>STILTON, a town of England, in the county of Huntingdonſhire, 75 miles from London, ſouth-weſt of Yaxley, on the Roman highway from Caſtor to Huntingdon, called <hi rend="italic">Ermine-street,</hi> ſome parts of which, in this neighbourhood, appear ſtill paved with ſtone. This place is famous for cheeſe which is called <hi rend="italic">English Parmesan,</hi> and is brought to table full of mites or maggots.
