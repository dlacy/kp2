Therefore 1/1 x 1/2 x 1/3 x 1/4 x 1/5 &amp;c. is an harmonical ſeries: whence the denominators of this ſeries form a ſeries of numbers in arithmetical progreſſion ; and converſely, the reciprocals of an arithmetical progreſſion are in harmonical proportion.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Recurring SERIES</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps">,</hi> a ſeries of which any term is formed by the addition of a certain number of preceding terms, multiplied or divided by any determinate numbers whether poſitive or negative.
