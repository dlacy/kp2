a tomb or place deſtined for the interment of the dead. This term is chiefly uſed in ſpeaking of the burying-plates of the ancients, thoſe of the moderns being uſually called <hi rend="italic">tombs.</hi></p><p>Sepulchres were held ſacred and inviolable ; and the care taken of them has always been held a religious duty, grounded on the fear of God, and the belief of the soul’s immortality. Thoſe who have ſearched or violated them have been thought odious by all nations, and were always ſeverely puniſhed.</p><p>The Egyptians called ſepulchres <hi rend="italic">eternal houſes,</hi> in contradiſtinction to their ordinary houſes or palaces, which they called <hi rend="italic">inns,</hi> on account of their ſhort ſtay in the one in compariſon of their long abode in the other.

This order was, however, ſuppressed by pope Innocent VIII. who gave its revenues and effects to that of our Lady of Bethlehem : which alto becoming extinct, they were beſtowed on the knights of St John of Jeruſalem. But the ſuppreſſion did not take effect in Poland, where they ſtill ſubſiſt, as alſo in ſeveral provinces of Germany. Theſe canons follow the rule of St Auguſtine.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Knights of the Holy</hi> <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Sepulchre,</hi> a military order, eſtabliſhed in Paleſtinc about the year 1114.</p><p>The knights of this order in Flanders choſe Philip II. king of Spain, for their maſter, in 1558 and afterwards his ſon ; but the grand-maſter of the order of Malta prevailed on the laſt to reſign ; and when afterwards the duke of Nevers aſſumed the same quality in France, the same grand-maſter, by ħis intereſt and credit, procured a like renunciation of him, and a confirmation of the union of this order to that oſ Malta.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
