            <p>bones in the buckler of the cranium. The auricle of the heart is not sufficiently
                divided to be described as double ; but the second lung is rudimentary, as among the
                genuine Ophidians. The liver is divided into many transverse foliations.</p>
            <p>We know nothing of the natural history or habits of the animals of this genus. They
                are said to dwell in marshy ground, several feet below the surface. They probably
                prey on worms and insects, although vegetable matters, mould, and sand, have been
                found in their intestines.</p>
            <p>In certain species the muzzle is obtuse, the skin loose, the folds conspicuous, and
                there are two small hairs near the nostrils. To this section belongs <hi
                    rend="italic">Cæc</hi>. <hi rend="italic">annulata</hi> of Spix, a Brazilian
                species, of subterranean habits. It is of a blackish hue, with upwards of eighty
                annular folds, and</p>
            <p>circularly marked with white. The teeth are conical. Others have the folds more
                numerous, or rather in the form of serrated transverse striæ. Such is <hi
                    rend="italic">Cæc. glutinosa, </hi>Linn., from Ceylon, a blackish-coloured
                reptile, marked by a longitudinal band of white on either side, and characterized by
                350 folds, which unite beneath in an acute angle. We have figured a nearly allied
                species from America, <hi rend="italic">Cæc</hi>. <hi rend="italic">bivittata</hi>
                of the French naturalists (see Plate CCCCXLIV. fig. 3). Finally, a few have the
                folds almost effaced, the body long and slender, and the muzzle projecting. <hi

                long, and not thicker than a quill. Baron Cuvier possessed the skeleton of a Cæcilia

            <p>SERPENT, a powerful bass musical instrument of the wind kind, invented by a French
                priest at Auxerre in 1590. See the article Music.</p>
            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Serpent,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Mythology,</hi> was a common
                symbol of the sun, and he is represented biting his tail, and with his body formed
                into a circle, in order to indicate the ordinary course of this luminary. The
                serpent was also the symbol of Medicine, and of the gods which presided over it, as
                of Apollo and Æsculapius ; and this animal was the object of very ancient and
                general worship, under various appellations and characters. In most of the ancient
                rites we find some allusion to the serpent, under the several titles of Ob, Ops,
                Python, and the like. This idolatry is alluded to by Moses. The woman at Endor who
                had a familiar spirit is called Oub, or Ob, which is interpreted Pythonissa. The
                place where she resided, says Bryant, seems to have been named from the worship
                there instituted ; for Endor is compounded of <hi rend="italic">En-adοr,</hi> and
                signifies <hi rend="italic">fons Pythonis,</hi> “ the fountain of light,” the oracle
                of the god Ador, which oracle was probably founded by the Canaanites, and had never
                been totally suppressed. His pillar was also called <hi rend="italic">Abbadir</hi>
                or <hi rend="italic">Abadir,</hi> compounded of <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">adir,</hi> and meaning the serpent deity Addir, the same as
                Adorns.</p>
            <p>In the orgies of Bacchus, the persons who partook of the ceremony used to carry
                serpents in their hands, and with horrid screams call upon Eva, being, according to
                the writer just mentioned, the same as epha or opha, which the Greeks</p>
            <p>rendered <hi rend="italic">ophis,</hi> and by it denoted a serpent. These ceremonies
                and this symbolical worship began among the Magi, who were the sons of Chus ; and by
                them they were propagated in various parts. Wherever the Ammonians founded any
                places of worship, and introduced their rites, there was generally some story of a
                serpent. There was a legend about a serpent at Colchis, at Thebes, at Delphi, and at
                other places. The Greeks called Apollo himself Python, which is the same as Opis,
                Oupis, and Oub.</p>
            <p>In Egypt there was a serpent named Thermuthis, which was looked upon as sacred ; and
                the natives arc said to have made use of it as a royal tiara, with which they
                ornamented the statues of Isis. The kings of Egypt wore high bonnets, terminating in
                a round ball, and surrounded with figures of asps ; and the priests had likewise the
                representation of serpents upon their bonnets.</p>
            <p>Abadon, or Abaddon, mentioned in the Revelations (xx. 2), is supposed by Bryant to
                have been the name of the Ophite god, with whose worship the world had been so long
                infected. This worship began among the people of Chaldæa, who built the city of
                Ophis upon the Tigris, and were greatly addicted to divination and to the worship of
                the serpent. From Chaldæa the worship passed into Egypt, where the serpent deity was
                called Canoph, Can-eph, and C-neph. It had also the name of Ob or Oub, and was the
                same as the Basiliscus or royal serpent, the same as the Thermuthis, and made use of
                by way of ornament to the statues : of</p>
