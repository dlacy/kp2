The length of this canal was about two miles and a half. The execution of this great work, however, did not occupy all his time. In 1716 he had begun to publish essays and observations on the mathematical and physical sciences, under the title of “ Dædalus Hyperboreus and he found leisure during the siege to complete his intended collection, and also in the same year to publish an introduction to algebra, under the whimsical title of the Art of the Rules.At the siege of Frederickshall he lost his royal patron ; but he found another in Ulrica Eleonora, the sister and successor of that hero, by whom in 1719 he was created a baron. His promotion did not lessen his ardour for the sciences ; for he published in the same year “ A Method to fix the Value of Money, and to determine the Swedish Measures in such a way as to suppress all the Fractions and facilitate the Calculations.” About the same time he gave the public a treatise on “ the Position and Course of the Planets with another on “ the Height of the Tides, and Fux and Reflux of the Sea which, from information gathered in different parts of Sweden, appeared to have been greater formerly than when he wrote.As Swedenborg continued, under the new sovereign, to hold the office of assessor to the Metallic College, he thought it necessary, for the discharge of his duty, to make a second journey into foreign countries, that he might himself examine their mines, particularly those of Saxony and Harts. During these travels, which were undertaken for the improvement of the manufactures of his native country, he printed at Amsterdam, 1. Prodromus Principiorum Naturalium, sive novorum Tentaminum Chemiam et Physicam experimentalem geometrice explicandi; 2. Nova Observata et Inventa circa Ferrum et Ignem, præcipue Naturam</p><p>SWEDENBORG, <hi rend="smallcaps">Emanuel,</hi> was born at Stockholm, in Sweden, in January 1689. His father was bishop of Skara in West Gothland ; member of a society for the propagation of the gospel, formed on the plan of that of England ; and president of the Swedish church in Pennsylvania and London. To this last office he was appointed by Charles XII. who seems to have had a great regard for the bishop, and to have continued that regard to his son.</p><p>Of the course of young Swedenborg’s education we have procured no account ; but from the character of the father, it may be supposed to have been pious ; and by his appearing with reputation as an author when but twenty years of age, it is proved to have been successful. His first work was published in 1709 ; and the year following he sent into the world a collection of pieces on different subjects, in Latin verse, under the title of “ Ludus Heliconius, sive Carmina Miscellanca quæ variis in locis cecinit.” The same year he began his travels, first into England, afterwards into Holland, France, and Germany ; and returning to Stockholm in 1714, he was two years afterwards appointed to the office of assessor in the Metallic College by Charles XII. who honoured him with frequent conversations, and bestowed upon him a large share of his favour. At this period of his life, Swedenborg devoted his attention principally to physic and mathematical studies ; and in 1718 he accompanied the king to the siege of Frederickshall, where he gave an eminent proof that he had not studied in vain. Charles could not send his heavy artillery to Frederickshall, from the badness of the roads, which were then rendered much worse than usual by being deeply covered with snow. In this extremity Swedenborg brought the sciences to the aid of valour. By the help of proper instruments he cut through the mountains and raised the valleys which separated Sweden from Norway, and then sent to his master</p></body></text></TEI>
