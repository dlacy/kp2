They pretended to be masters of important secrets, and, amongst others, that of the philosopher’s stone ; all which they affirmed to have received by tradition from the ancient Egyptians, Chaldæans, the Magi, and Gymnoso-phists. They have been distinguished by several names, accommodated to the several branches of their doctrine. Because they pretended to protract the period of human life, by means of certain nostrums, and even to restore youth, they were called <hi rend="italic">Immortales ;</hi>  as they pretended to know all things, they have been called <hi rend="italic">Illuminati;</hi>  and because they have made no appearance for several years, unless the sect of Illuminated which lately started up on the Continent derives its origin from them, they have been called the <hi rend="italic">Invisible Brot}ters.</hi>  Their society is frequently signed by the letters F. R. C. which by some amongst them are interpreted <hi rend="italic">Fratres Roris Cocti ;</hi>  it being pretended, that the matter of the philosopher’s stone is dew concocted or exalted. Some, who are no friends to free-masonry, make the present flourishing society of free-masons a branch of Rosicrucians, or rather the Rosicrucians themselves under a new name or relation, namely, as retainers to building.</p><p>Notwithstanding the pretended antiquity of the Rosicrucians, it is probable that the alchemists, Paracelsists, or fire-philosophers, who spread themselves through almost all Europe about the close of the sixteenth century, assumed about this period the obscure and ambiguous title of Rosi-crucian brethren, which commanded at first some degree of respect, as it seemed to be borrowed from the arms of Luther, which were a cross placed upon a rose. But the denomination evidently appears to be derived from the science of chemistry. It is not compounded, as many imagine, of the two words <hi rend="italic">rosa</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">crux,</hi>  which signify rose and cross, but of the latter of these words, and the Latin <hi rend="italic">τos,</hi>  which signifies dew. Of all natural bodies, dew was deemed the most powerful dissolvent of gold ; and the cross, in the chemical language, is equivalent to light, because the figure of a cross exhibits, at the same time, the three letters of which the word <hi rend="italic">lux,</hi>  or light, is compounded. Now <hi rend="italic">lux </hi>is called, by this sect, the seed or menstruum of the red dragon, or, in other words, that gross and corporeal light, which, when properly digested and modified, produces gold. Hence it follows, if this etymology be admitted, that a Ro-sicrucian philosopher is one who, by the intervention and assistance of the dew, seeks for light, or, in other words, the substance called the philosopher’s stone. The true meaning and energy of this denomination did not escape the penetration and sagacity of Gassendi, as appears by his <hi rend="italic">Examen Philosophiœ Fluddanœ,</hi>  sect. Ιό, tom. iii. p. 261; and it was more fully explained by Renaudot, in his <hi rend="italic">Conferences Publiques,</hi>  tom. iv. p. 87.</p><p>At the head of these fanatics were Robert Fludd, an English physician, Jacob Bohm, and Michael Mayer. The common principles which serve as a kind of centre of union to the Roβicrucian society are the following. They all maintain that the dissolution of bodies by the power of fire is the only way by which men can arrive at true wisdom, and come to discern the first principles of things. They all acknowledge a certain analogy and haπpony between the powers of nature and the doctrines of religion ; and believe that the Deity governs the kingdom of grace by the same laws with which he rules the kingdom of nature, and hence they are led to use chemical denominations to express the truths of religion. They all hold that there is a sort of divine energy, or soul, diffused through the frame of the universe, which some call the <hi rend="italic">archcus,</hi>  others the <hi rend="italic">universal spirit,</hi>  and which others mention under different appellations. They all talk in the most superstitious manner of what they call the signatures of things, of the power of the stars over all corporeal beings, and their particular influence upon the human race, of the efficacy of magic, and the various ranks and orders of demons. These de</p><p>mons they divide into two orders, <hi rend="italic">sylphs</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">gnomes;</hi>  which supplied the beautiful machinery of Pope’s Rape of the Lock. In fine, the Rosicrucians and all their fanatical descendants agree in proposing the most crude and incomprehensible notions and ideas, in the most obscure, quaint, and unusual expressions.</p><p>ROSLIN, or Rosslyn, a village in the county of Mid-Lothian, Scotland, about seven miles south from Edinburgh, celebrated for the picturesque ruins of its castle, the architectural grace of its chapel, and the sequestered but variegated scenery of the vale in which they are placed. Roslin was formerly a place of some note, being next to Edinburgh and Haddington in importance, and was made a burgh of barony by James II. of Scotland, and privileged by holding fairs and markets. The sole dependence of the inhabitants at the present time is on agriculture and the bleaching of linen. The castle is situated on a peninsular rock, round which the South Esk river pursues its course; and is connected with the adjacent ground by an old narrow bridge thrown over a deep chasm cut in the solid rock. The original castle was most likely erected in the eleventh century. It must have been increased from time to time in after years, as we learn that when the Earls of St Clair were in their glory, the castle was not only a massive and extensive building, but characterized by great splendour in its internal decorations. All that now remain are some high fragments of the walls and battlements, and a triple tier of vaults. Amidst the ruins, and partly above these vaults, was built a more modern house, bearing the date of 1622, which is still inhabited.</p><p>The chapel was founded in the year 1446, by William St Clair, prince of Orkney and lord of Rosslyn, for a provost, six prebendaries, and two choristers, and consecrated to St Matthew. Tradition states that the design of the building, which was intended for a large collegiate church, was drawn at Rome ; and that the prince employed the best workmen that could be procured, both from the Continent and at home, in the erection. The chapel, which is merely the chancel and part of the transept of the original design, is unique in style, and cannot be said to belong to any order of architecture. It however combines the solidity of the Norman with the elegance and minute profusion of ornament characteristic of the latest species of the Tudor age. The interior is sixty-eight feet in length, thirty-four feet in breadth, and forty feet in height. It is divided into a centre and aisles, by two ranges of clustered pillars, eight feet in height, adorned with sculptured foliage and figures of human beings and animals, of the most exquisite workmanship. The pillars are so arranged that their ceilings are thrown into one, so as to form a continued arch along the centre of the building. One pillar, conspicuous for its elaborate decorations, is called the “ prentice pillar,” from its having been sculptured by an apprentice, who is said to have lost his life from having thus excited the professional jealousy of his master. At the reformation in 1688 this chapel was, like many other sacred edifices of taste, defaced by a mob from Edinburgh ; but it was repaired in the following century by General St Clair. The present Earl of Rosslyn is judiciously, and with great taste, restoring this venerable structure to its original state. Beneath this chapel lie the barons of Roslin, all of whom were, till the time of James VII., buried in armour. Near tllis was fought, in February 1302, the three celebrated battles of Roslin, where the Scots, under the regent Sir John Cornyn, and Sir Simon Frazer, attacked and defeated three divisions of the English army in one day.</p><p>ROSS, a market-town of the county of Hereford, in the hundred of Greytree, 115 miles from London. It is finely situated on a hill rising from the river Wye. Its chief trade is in the sale of cider. Pope has immortalized the place by his laudatory description of one of its residents, John</p><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
