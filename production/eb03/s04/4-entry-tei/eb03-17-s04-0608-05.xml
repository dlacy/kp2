or <hi rend="smallcaps">Magic</hi>; the power which ſome perſons were formerly ſuppoſed to poſſeſs of commanding the devil and the infernal ſpirits by ſkill in charms and invocations, and of ſoothing them by fumigations. Sorcery is therefore to be diſtinguiſhed from witchcraft ; an art which was ſuppoſed to be practiſed, not by commanding evil ſpirits, but by compact with the devil. As an inſtance of the power of bad ſmells over demons or evil ſpirits, we may mention the flight of the evil ſpirit mentioned in Tobit into the remote parts of Egypt, produced, it is ſaid, by the ſmell of the burnt liver of a fiſh. Lilly informs us, that one Evans having raiſed a ſpirit at the requeſt of Lord Bothwell and Sir Kenelm Digby, and forgetting a fumigation, the ſpirit, vexed at the diſappointment, pulled him without the circle, and carried him from his houſe in the Minories into a field near Batterſea Cauſeway.</p><p>King James, in his <hi rend="italic">Damonologia,</hi> has given a very full account of the art of ſorcery. “ Two principal things (says he) cannot well in that errand be wanted:<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0615.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s04-0609"/>
holy water (whereby the devil mockes the papiſts), and ſome preſent of a living thing unto him. There are likewiſe certaine daies and houres that they obſerve in this purpoſe. Theſe things being all ready and prepared, circles are made, triangular, quadrangular, round, double, or ſingle, according to the forme of the apparition they crave. When the conjured ſpirit appeares, which will not be while after many circumſtances, long prayers, and much muttering and murmurings of the conjurors, like a papiſt prieſt dispatching a hunting maſſe —how ſoone, I ſay, he appeares, if they have missed one jote of all their rites ; or if any of their feete once ſlyd over the circle, through terror of his fearfull apparition, he paies himſelf at that time, in his owne hand, of that due debt which they ought him, and otherwiſe would have delated longer to have pared him : I mean, he carries them with him, body and soule.” How the conjurors made triangular or quadrangular circles, his majeſty has not informed us, nor does he ſeem to imagine there was any difficulty in the matter. We are therefore led to ſuppoſe, that he learned his mathematics from the ſame ſyſtem as Dr Sacheverell, who, in one of his ſpeeches or fermons, made uſe of the following ſimile : “ They concur like parallel lines, meeting in one common centre.”</p><p>Another mode of conſulting ſpirits was by the beryl, by means of a ſpeculator or ſeer ; who, to have a complete ſight, ought to be a pure virgin, a youth who had not known woman, or at leaſt a perſon oſ irreproachable life and purity of manners. The method of ſuch consultation is this : The conjuror having repeated the neceſſary charms and adjurations, with the litany or invocation peculiar to the ſpirits or angels he wiſhes to call (for every one has his particular form), the ſeer looks into a cryſtal or beryl, wherein he will ſee the anſwer repreſented either by types or figures ; and ſometimes, though very rarely, will hear the angels or ſpirits ſpeak articulately. Their pronunciation is, as Lilly ſays, like the Iriſh, much in the throat. Lilly describes one of theſe beryls or cryſtals. It was, he ſays, as large as an orange, ſet in ſilver, with a croſs at the top, and round about engraved the names of the angels Raphael, Gabriel, and Uriel. A delineation of another is engraved in the frontiſpiece to Aubery’s Miſcellanies.</p><p>Theſe ſorcerers or magicians do not always employ their art to do miſchief; but, on the contrary, frequently exert it to cure diſeaſes inflicted by witches ; to diſcover thieves ; recover ſtolen goods ; to foretel future events, and the ſtate of abſent friends. On this account they are frequently called <hi rend="italic">white witches.</hi> See <hi rend="smallcaps">Magic,</hi> WITCHCRAFT, &amp; C.</p><p>Our forefathers were ſtrong believers when they enacted, by ſtatute 33 Hen. VIII. c. 8. all witchcraft and ſorcery to be felony without benefit of clergy ; and again, by ſtatute 1 Jac. I. c. 12. that all perſons invoking any evil ſpirit, or conſulting, covenanting with, entertaining, employing, feeding, or rewarding arty evil ſpirit; or taking up dead bodies from their graves to be uſed in any witchcraft, ſorcery, charm, or inchant- ment; or killing or otherwiſe hurting any perſon by ſuch infernal arts ; ſhould be guilty of felony without benefit of clergy, and ſuffer death. And if any perſon ſhould attempt by ſorcery to diſcover hidden treaſure,</p><p>or to reſtore ſtolen goods, or to provoke unlawful love, or to hurt any man or beaſt, though the ſame were not effected, he or ſhe ſhould ſuffer impriſonment and pillory for the firſt offence, and death for the ſecond. Theſe acts continued in force till lately, to the terror of all ancient females in the kingdom ; and many poor wretches were ſacrificed thereby to the prejudice of their neighbours and their own illuſions, not a few having by ſome means or other confeſſed the fact at the gallows. But all executions for this dubious crime are now at an end ; our legiſlature having at length followed the wiſe example of Louis XIV. in France, who thought proper by an edict to reſtrain the tribunals of juſtice from receiving informations of withcraſt. And accordingly it is with us enacted, by ſtatute 9 Geo. II. c. 5. that no proſecution ſhall for the future be carried on againſt any perſon for conjuration, witchcraft, ſorcery, or inchantment : But the miſdemeanor of perſons pretending to uſe witchcraft, tell fortunes, or diſcover ſtolen goods, by ſkill in the occult ſciences, is ſtill deſervedly puniſhed with a year’s impriſonment, and ſtanding four times in the pillory.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
