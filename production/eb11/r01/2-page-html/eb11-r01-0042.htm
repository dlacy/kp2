In those individuals which produce crystalligerous swarm-spores, each spore encloses a small crystal (fig. III. 15). On the other hand,&nbsp;in those individuals which produce dimorphous swarm-spores, the&nbsp;contents of the capsule (which in both instances are set free by its&nbsp;natural rupture) are seen to consist of individuals of two sizes,&nbsp;‘megaspores’ and ‘microspores’ neither of which contain&nbsp;crystals (fig. III</span><span class="font0">. </span><span class="font1">16). The further development of the spores has&nbsp;not been observed in either case. Both processes have been observed&nbsp;in the same species, and it is suggested that there is an alternation&nbsp;of sexual and asexual generations, the crystalligerous spores developing directly into adults, which in their turn produce in their central&nbsp;capsules dimorphous swarm-spores (megaspores and microspores),&nbsp;which in a manner analogous to that observed in the Volvocinean&nbsp;Flagellata copulate (permanently fuse) with one another (the larger&nbsp;with the smaller) before proceeding to develop. The adults resulting&nbsp;from this process would, it is suggested, produce in their turn&nbsp;crystalligerous swarm-spores. Unfortunately we have no observations to support this hypothetical scheme of a life-history.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">“ Simple fission of the central capsule of adult individuals, pre-ceded of course by nuclear fission, and subsequently of the whole protoplasmic mass, has been observed in several genera of Acantharia and Phaeodaria, and is probably a general method of repro-duction in the group.

<p><span class="font2">RADIOMETER. It had been remarked at various times, amongst others by Fresnel, that bodies delicately suspended&nbsp;within a partial vacuum are subject to apparent repulsion by&nbsp;radiation. The question was definitely investigated by Sir W.&nbsp;Crookes, who had found that some delicate weighings </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">in υacuo&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">were vitiated by this cause. It appeared that a surface black-ened so as to absorb the radiant energy directed on it was&nbsp;repelled relatively to a polished surface. He constructed an&nbsp;apparatus in illustration, which he called a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">radiometer</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">light-mill,</span><span class="font2"> by pivoting a vertical axle carrying equidistant vertical&nbsp;vanes inside an exhausted glass bulb, one side of each vane&nbsp;being blackened and the other side bright, the blackened sides&nbsp;all pointing the same way round the axle. When the rays&nbsp;of the sun or a candle, or dark radiation from a warm body,&nbsp;are incident on the vanes, the dark side of each vane is repelled&nbsp;more than the bright side, and thus the vanes are set into&nbsp;rotation with accelerated speed, which becomes uniform when&nbsp;the forces produced by the radiation are balanced by the&nbsp;friction of the pivot and of the residual air in the globe. The&nbsp;name radiometer arose from an idea that the final steady speed&nbsp;of rotation might be utilized as a rough measure of the intensity&nbsp;of the exciting radiation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The problem of the cause of these striking and novel phenomena at first produced considerable perplexity. A preliminary question was whether the mechanical impulsion was a direct&nbsp;effect of the light, or whether the radiation only set up internal&nbsp;stresses, acting in and through the residual air, between the&nbsp;vanes and the walls of the enclosure. The answer to this was&nbsp;found experimentally by Arthur Schuster, who suspended&nbsp;the whole instrument in delicate equilibrium, and observed&nbsp;the effect of introducing the radiation. If the light exerted&nbsp;direct impulsion on the vanes, their motion would gradually&nbsp;drag the case round after them, by reason of the friction of&nbsp;the residual air in the bulb and of the pivot. On the other&nbsp;hand, if the effects arose from balanced stresses set up inside&nbsp;the globe by the radiation, the effects on the vanes and on the&nbsp;case would be of the nature of action and reaction, so that the&nbsp;establishment of motion of the vanes in one direction would&nbsp;involve impulsion of the case in the opposite direction; but&nbsp;when the motion became steady there would no longer be any&nbsp;torque either on the vanes or on the case, and the latter would&nbsp;therefore come back to its previous position of equilibrium;&nbsp;finally, when the light was turned off, the decay of the motion&nbsp;of the vanes would involve impulsion of the case in the direction&nbsp;of their motion until the moment of the restoring torque arising&nbsp;from the suspension of the case had absorbed the angular&nbsp;momentum in the system. Experiment showed that the latter&nbsp;prediction was what happened. The important part played&nbsp;by the residual air in the globe had also been deduced by&nbsp;Osborne Reynolds from observing that on turning off the&nbsp;light, the vanes came to rest very much sooner than the friction&nbsp;of the pivot alone would account for; in fact, the rapid subsidence is an illustration of Maxwell’s great theoretical dis-covery that viscosity in a gas (as also diffusion both of heat&nbsp;and of the gas itself) is sensibly independent of the density.&nbsp;Some phenomena of retardation in the production of the effect&nbsp;had led Sir G. G. Stokes and Sir W. Crookes to the same general&nbsp;conclusion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The origin of these phenomena was recognized, among the first by O. Reynolds, and by P. G. Tait and J. Dewar, as a&nbsp;consequence of the kinetic theory of the constitution of gaseous&nbsp;media. The temperature of a gas is measured by the mean&nbsp;energy of translation of its molecules, which are independent&nbsp;of each other except during the brief intervals of collision;&nbsp;and collision of the separate molecules with the blackened&nbsp;surface of a vane, warmed by the radiation, imparts heat to&nbsp;them, so that they rebound from it with greater velocity than&nbsp;they approached. This increase of velocity implies an increase&nbsp;of the reaction on the surface, the black side of a vane being&nbsp;thus pressed with greater force than the bright side. In air&nbsp;of considerable density the mean free path of a molecule,&nbsp;between its collisions with other molecules, is exceedingly&nbsp;small, and any such increase of gaseous pressure in front of the&nbsp;black surface would be immediately neutralized by flow of the&nbsp;gas from places of high to places of low pressure. But at high&nbsp;exhaustions the free path becomes comparable with the dimensions of the glass bulb, and this equalization proceeds slowly.&nbsp;The general nature of the phenomena is thus easily understood;&nbsp;but it is at a maximum at pressures comparable with a millimetre of mercury, at which the free path is still small, the&nbsp;greater number of molecules operating in intensifying the&nbsp;result. The problem of the stresses in rarefied gaseous media&nbsp;arising from inequalities of temperature, which is thereby&nbsp;opened out, involves some of the most delicate considerations&nbsp;in molecular physics. It remains practically as it was left&nbsp;in 1879 by two memoirs communicated to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Phil. Trans.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">by Osborne Reynolds and by Clerk Maxwell: The method of&nbsp;the latter investigator was purely a priori. He assumed that&nbsp;the distribution of molecules and of their velocities, at each&nbsp;point, was slightly modified, from the exponential law belonging&nbsp;to a uniform condition, by the gradient of temperature in the&nbsp;gas (see Diffusion). The hypothesis that the state was steady,&nbsp;so that interchanges arising from convection and collisions of&nbsp;the molecules produced no aggregate result, enabled him to&nbsp;interpret the new constants involved in this law of distribution,&nbsp;in terms of the temperature and its spacial differential co-efficients, and thence to express the components of the kinetic&nbsp;stress at each point in the medium in terms of these quantities.&nbsp;As far as the order to which he carried the approximations—&nbsp;which, however, were based on a simplifying hypothesis that&nbsp;the molecules influenced each other through mutual repulsions&nbsp;inversely as the fifth power of their distance apart—the result&nbsp;was that the equations of motion of the gas, considered as&nbsp;subject to viscous and thermal stresses, could be satisfied by&nbsp;a state of equilibrium under a modified internal pressure equal&nbsp;in all directions. If, therefore, the walls of the enclosure held</span></p>
