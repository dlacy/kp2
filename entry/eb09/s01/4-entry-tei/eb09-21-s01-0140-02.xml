 or <hi rend="smallcaps">John Holywood,</hi> astronomical author, died 1244 (or 1256) as professor of mathematics at the university of Paris. Nothing else is known about his life. He wrote a treatise on spherical astronomy, <hi rend="italic">Tractatus de Sphera Mundi,</hi> first printed at Ferrara in 1472, and reprinted, generally with copious notes and commentaries, about sixty times until the end of the 17th century. About the year 1232 he wrote <hi rend="italic">De anni ratione sen ut vocatur vulgo computus ecclesiasticus,</hi> in which he points out the increasing error of the Julian calendar, and suggests a remedy which is nearly the same as that actually used under Gregory XIII. three hundred and fifty years later.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
