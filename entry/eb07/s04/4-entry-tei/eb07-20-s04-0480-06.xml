an appellation assumed in the early periods of Grecian history, by those who devoted their time to the study of science. This appellation appearing too arrogant to Pythagoras, he declined it, and wished to be called a <hi rend="italic">philosopher ;</hi> declaring that, though he could not consider himself as <hi rend="italic">a</hi> wise man, he was indeed a lover of wisdom. True wisdom and modesty are generally united. The example of Pythagoras was followed by every man of eminence, while the name <hi rend="italic">sophist</hi> was retained only by those who with a pomp of words made a magnificent display of wisdom upon a very slight foundation of knowledge. Those men taught an artificial structure of language, and a false method of reasoning, by which, in argument, the worse might be made to appear the better reason. In Athens they were long held in high repute, and were supported, not only by contributions from their pupils, but by a regular salary from the state. They were among the bitterest enemies of the illustrious Socrates, because he embraced every opportunity of exposing to contempt and ridicule their vain pretensions to superior knowledge, and the pernicious influence of their doctrines upon the taste and morals of the Athenian youth.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
