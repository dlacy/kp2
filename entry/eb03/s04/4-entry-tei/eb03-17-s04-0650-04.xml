or <hi rend="smallcaps">Lacedæmon,</hi> the capital of the country of Laconia in Greece, an ancient and moſt renowned ſtate, the inhabitants of which have been in all ages celebrated for the Angularity of their laws and character.—The hiſtory of Sparta for many ages is entirely fabulous ; and the authentic accounts commence only with the celebrated lawgiver Lycurgus, who flouriſhed about 870 B.C. See the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Lycurgus.</hi></p><p>After his death, the firſt important tranſaction which we find mentioned in the Spartan hiſtory is the Meſſenian war, which commenced in the year 752 B. C. and ended in the total reduction of the Meſſenian territory, as related under the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Messenia.</hi> During this period, according to ſome authors, a great change took place in the government of Sparta. This was the creation of the ephori, which is aſcribed to one of the kings named <hi rend="italic">Theopompus.</hi> This man perceiving that there was a neceſſity for leaving magiſtratcs to execute the laws, when the kings were obliged to be in the field, appointed the magiſtrates above mentioned, who afterwards made ſo great a figure in the ſtate (ſee <hi rend="smallcaps">Ephori).</hi> One great privilege of the ephori was, that they did not riſe up at the preſence of the kings, as all other magiſtrates did : another was, that if the kings offended againſt the laws, the ephori took cognizance of the offence, and inflicted a ſuitable puniſhment. From the firſt election of the ephori, the year was denominated, as at Athens, from the firſt election of the archons.</p><p>The conqueſt of Meſſenia gave Sparta the ſuperiority over the reſt of the ſtates, excepting only that of Athens, which for a long time continued to be a very troubleſome rival ; but the conteſts between theſe two rival states have been ſo fully related under the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Attica,</hi> that nothing more isrequiſite to be added in the</p><p>place.—In the time of the Perſian war, Leonidas the Spartan king diſtinguiſhed himſelf in ſuch a manner, as to become the admiration not only of that but of every ſucceeding age. It being reſolved in a general council to defend the ſtraits of Thermopylae againſt. the Perſians, 7000<note anchored="true" n="1" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>* See Anachbarsis's Travels, vol. i. p. 468.</p></note> * foot were put under the command of Leonidas ; of whom, however, only 300 were Spartans. Leonidas did not think it practicable to defend the paſs againſt ſuch multitudes as the Persian king commanded; and therefore privately told his friends, that his deſign was to devote himſelf to death for his country.</p><p>Xerxes advancing near the ſtraits, was ſtrangely ſurpriſed to find that the Greeks were reſolved to diſpute his paſſage ; for he had always flattered himſelf, that on his approach they would betake themſelves to flight, and not attempt to oppoſe his innumerable forces. However, Xerxes ſtill entertaining ſome hopes of their flight, waited four days without undertaking any thing, on purpoſe to give them time to retreat. During this time, he uſed his utmoſt endeavours to gain and corrupt Leonidas, promiſing to make him maſter of all Greece if he would come over to his intereſt. His offers being rejected with contempt and indignation, the king ordered him by an herald to deliver up his arms. Leonidas, in a ſtyle and with a ſpirit truly laconical, anſwered, " Come thyſelf, and take them.” Xerxes, at this reply, tranſported with rage, commanded the Medes and Ciſſians to march againſt them, take them all alive, and bring them to him in fetters. The Medes, not able to ſtand the ſhock of the Greeks, ſoon betook themſelves to flight : and in their room Hydarnes was ordered to advance with that body which was called <hi rend="italic">Immortal,</hi> and conſiſted of 10,000 choſen men ; but when theſe came to cloſe with the Greeks, they ſucceeded no better than the Medes and Ciſſians, being obliged to retire with great ſlaughter. The next day the Perſians, reflecting on the ſmall number of their enemies, and ſuppoſing ſo many of them to be wounded that they could not poſſibly maintain a ſecond fight, reſolved to make another attempt; but could not by any efforts make the Greeks give way : on the contrary, they were themſelves put to a ſhameful flight. The valour of the Greeks exerted itſelf on this occaſion in a manner ſo extraordinary, that Xerxes is ſaid to have three times leaped from his throne, apprehending the entire deſtruction of his army.</p><p>Xerxes having loſt all hopes of forcing his way through troops that were determined to conquer or die, was extremely perplexed and doubtful what meaſures he ſhould take in this poſture of affairs; when one Epialtes, in expectation of a great reward, came to him, and diſcovered a ſecret paſſage to the top of the hill which overlooked and commanded the Spartan forces. The king immediately ordered Hydarnes thither with his ſelect body of 10,000 Perſians; who marching all night, arrived at break of day, and poſſeſſed themſelves of that advantageous poſt. The Phocæans, who defended this paſs, being overpowered by the enemy’s numbers, retired with precipitation to the very top of the mountain, prepared to die gallantly. But Hydarnes neglecting to purſue them, marched down the mountain with all poſſible expedition, in order to attack thoſe who defended the ſtraits in the rear. Leonidas being now appriſed that it was impoſſible to bear up againſt the enemy, obliged the reſt of his allies to retire: but he ſtaid himſelf, with the Theſpians, Thebans, and 300<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0657.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s04-0651"/>
Lacedemonians, all reſolved to die with their leader ; who being told by the oracle, that either Sparta ſhould be deſtroyed or the king loſe his life, determined without the leaſt heſſitation to ſacrifice himſelf for his country. The Thebans indeed remained againſt their inclination, being detained by Leonidas as hoſtages ; for they were ſuspected to favour the Perſians. The Thespians, with their leader Demophilus, could not by any means be prevailed upon to abandon Leonidas and the Spartans. The augur Megiſtias, who had foretold the event of this enterprize, being preſſed by Leonidas to retire, ſent home his only ſon ; but remained himſelf, and died by Leonidas. Thoſe who ſtaid did not feed themſelves with any hopes of conquering or eſcaping, but looked upon Thermopylae as their graves; and when Leonidas, exhorting them to take ſome nouriſhment, ſaid, that they ſhould all ſup together with Pluto, with one accord they ſet up a ſhout of joy, as if they had been invited to a banquet.</p><p>Xerxes, after pouring out a libation at the riſing of the ſun, began to move with the whole body of his army, as he had been adviſed by Epialtes. Upon their approach, Leonidas advanced to the broadeſt part of the paſſage, and fell upon the enemy with ſuch undaunted courage and reſolution, that the Perſian officers were obliged to ſtand behind the diviſions they commanded, in order to prevent the flight of their men. Great numbers of the enemy falling into the ſea, were drowned ; others were trampled under foot by their own men, and a great many killed by the Greeks; who knowing they could not avoid death upon the arrival of thoſe who were advancing to fall upon their rear, exerted their utmoſt efforts. In this action fell the brave Leonidas; which Abrocomes and Hyperanthes, two of the brothers of Xerxes, obſerving, advanced with great resolution to ſeize his body, and carry it in triumph to Xerxes. But the Lacedemonians, more eager to defend it than their own lives, repulſed the enemy four times, killed both the brothers of Xerxes, with many other commanders of diſtinction, and reſcued the body of their beloved general out of the enemy’s hands. But in the mean time, the army that was led by the treacherous Epialtes, advancing to attack their rear, they retired to the narroweſt place of the paſſage, and drawing all together except the Thebans, poſted themſelves on a riſing ground. In this place they made head againſt the Perſians, who poured in upon them on all ſides, till at length, not vanquiſhed, but oppreſſed and overwhelmed by numbers, they all fell, except one who eſcaped to Sparta, where he was treated as a coward and traitor to his country ; but afterwards made a glorious reparation in the battle of Platæa, where he diſtinguiſhed himſelf in an extraordinary manner. Some time after, a magnificent monument was erected at Thermopylae, in honour of thoſe brave defenders of Greece, with two inſcriptions ; the one general, and relating to all thoſe who died on this occaſion, importing, that the Greeks of Peloponneſus, to the number only of 4000, made head againſt the Perſian army, conſiſting of 3,000,000. The other related to the Spartans in particular, and was compoſed by the poet Simonides, to this purport : “ Go, passenger, and acquaint the Spartans that we died here in obedience to their juſt commands.” At thoſe tombs a funeral oration was yearly pronounced in honour of the dead heroes, and public games performed with great ſolenmity,</p><p>wherein none but the Lacedemonians and Thespians had any ſhare, to ſhow that they alone were concerned in the glorious defence of Thermopylae.</p><p>At the end of the 77th Olympiad, a moſt dreadful earthquake happened at Sparta, in which, according to Diodorus, 20,000 perſons loſt their lives ; and Plutarch tells us, that only five houſes were left ſtanding in the whole city. On this occaſion the Helotes or ſlaves, whom the Spartans had all along treated with the utmoſt cruelty, attempted to revenge themſelves, by taking up arms, and marching directly to the ruins of the city, in hopes of cutting off at once thoſe who had eſcaped from the earthquake. But in this they were prevented by the prudence of the Spartan king Archidamus ; for he, obſerving that the citizens were more deſirous of preſerving their effects than taking care of their own lives, cauſed an alarm to be founded, as if he had known that an enemy was at hand. On this the citizens armed themſelves in haste with ſuch weapons as they could come at ; and having marched a little way from the city, met the Helotes, whom they ſoon compelled to retire. The latter, however, knowing that they had now no mercy to expect from thoſe who had already treated them with ſuch cruelty, reſolved to defend themſelves to the laſt. Having therefore ſeized a ſea-port town in Meſſenia, they from thence made ſuch incurſions into the Spartan territories, that they compelled thoſe imperious matters to aſk aſſiſtance from the Athenians. This was immediately granted ; but when the Spartans ſaw that the ſkill of the Athenians in beſieging towns was much greater than their own, they became jealous, and diſmiſſed their allies, telling them, that they had now no farther occaſion for their ſervices. On this the Athenians left them in diſguſt ; and as the Helotes and Meſſenians did not chooſe to come to an engagement with a Spartan army in the field, but took ſhelter in their fortified places, the war was protracted for ten years and upwards. At laſt the Helotes were reduced to their former miſery ; and the Meſſenians were obliged to leave Peloponneſus, on pain of being made ſlaves alſo. Theſe poor people were then received by the Athenians, who granted them Naupactus for their reſidence, and afterwards brought them back to a part of their own country, from whence in the courſe of the Peloponneſian war they had driven the Spartans.</p><p>In the year 431 B. C. the Peloponneſian war commenced ; of which a full account has been given under the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Attica,</hi> n⁰ 116—165. It ended moſt unfortunately for the Athenians ; their city being taken and diſmantled, as related in the article above-mentioned. Thus were the Spartans raiſed to the higheſt pitch of glory ; and, in the reign of Ageſilaus, they ſeemed to be on the point of ſubverting the Perſian empire, as related under the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Persia,</hi> n⁰ 34. But here their good fortune and their views of empire were ſuddenly checked. Ageſilaus had carried on the war in Aſia with the greateſt ſucceſs ; and as he would hearken to no terms of accommodation, a Perſian governor named <hi rend="italic">Tithraustes,</hi> having firſt attempted in vain to bribe the king, dispatched Timocrates the Rhodian with 50 talents into Greece, in order to try whether he could there meet with any perſons leſs incorruptible than the Spartan monarch. This agent found many who inclined to accept his offers ; particularly in Thebes, Co-<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0658.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s04-0652"/>
rinth, and Argos. By diſtributing the money in a proper manner, he inflamed the inhabitants of theſe three cities againſt the Spartans ; and of all others the Thebans came into his terms with the greateſt readineſs. They ſaw that their antagoniſts would not of their own accord break with any of the ſtates of Greece, and did not chooſe to begin the war themſelves, becauſe the chiefs of the Perſian faction were unwilling to be accountable for the event. For this reaſon they perſuaded the Locrians to invade a ſmall diſtrict which lay in diſpute betwixt the Phocians and themſelves. On this the Phocians invaded Locris ; the Locrians applied to the Thebans, and the Phocians to the Spartans. The latter were glad of an opportunity of breaking with the Thebans ; but met with a much warmer reception than they expected. Their old general Lyſander, who had reduced Athens, was defeated and killed, with the loſs of 1000 men : on which diſaſter Ageſilaus was recalled, and obliged to relinquiſh all hopes of conquering the Perſians. His return changed the fortune of the war ſo much, that all the ſtates began to grow weary of a conteſt from which nobody derived any advantage except the king of Perſia. In a ſhort time a treaty was concluded, known in hiſtory by the name of the peace <hi rend="italic">of Antalcidas.</hi> The terms of this treaty were highly diſadvantageous and diſhonourable to the Greeks<note anchored="true" n="2" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>* See Persia. n⁰ 37.</p></note> *; for even the Spartans, though ſucceſsful in Greece, had loſt a great battle at ſea with the Perſian fleet under Conon the Athenian, which entirely broke their power in Aſia.</p><p>By the peace of Antalcidas, the government of Boeotia was taken from the Thebans, which they had for a long time enjoyed ; and by this they were ſo much provoked, that at firſt they abſolutely refuſed to accede to the treaty ; but as Ageſilaus made great preparations to invade them, they thought proper at laſt to comply. However, it was not long before a new war commenced, which threatened the total ſubverſion of the Spartan ſtate. As, by the peace of Antalcidas, the king of Perſia had in a manner guaranteed the ſovereignty of Greece to Sparta, this republic very ſoon began to exerciſe its power to the utmoſt extent. The Mantineans were the firſt who felt the weight of their reſentment, although they had been their allies and confederates. In order to have a pretence for making war againſt them, they commanded them to quit their city, and to retire into five old villages which, they ſaid, had ſerved their forefathers, and where they would live in peace themſelves, and give no umbrage to their neighbours. This being refuſed, an army was ſent againſt them to beſiege their city. The ſiege was continued through the ſummer with very little ſucceſs on the part of the Spartans ; but having during the winter ſeaſon dammed up the river on which the city flood, the water roſe to ſuch an height, as either to overflow or throw down the houſes ; which compelled the Mantineans to ſubmit to the terms preſcribed to them, and to retire into the old villages. The Spartan vengeance fell next on the Phliaſians and Olynthians, whom they forced to come into ſuch meaſures as they thought proper. After this they fell on the Thebans ; and, by attempting to ſeize on the Piraeum, drew the Athenians alſo into the quarrel. But here their career was flopped : the Thebans had been taught the art of war by Chabrias the Athenian ; so that even Ageſilaus himſelf took the command</p><p>of the Spartan army in vain. At ſea they were defeated by Timotheus the ſon of Conon ; and by land the battle of Leuctra put an end to the ſuperiorſty which Sparta had held over Greece for near 500 years. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Leuctra.</hi></p><p>After this dreadful defeat, the Spartans had occaſion to exert all their courage and reſolution. The women and neareſt relations of thoſe who were killed is battle, inſtead of ſpending their time in lamentations, ſhook each other by the hand, while the relations of thoſe who had eſcaped from the battle hid themſelves among the women ; or if they were obliged to go abroad, they appeared in tattered clothes, with their arms folded, and their eyes fixed on the ground. It was a law among the Spartans, that ſuch as fled from battle ſhould be degraded from their honours, ſhould be conſtrained to appear in garments patched with divers colours, to wear their beards half-ſhaved, and to ſuffer any to beat them who pleaſed, without reſiſtance. At preſent, however, this law was diſpenſed with ; and Ageſilaus by his prudent conduct kept up the ſpirits of the people, at the ſame time that by his ſkill in military affairs he checked the progreſs of the enemy. Yet, during the lifetime of Epaminondas the Theban general, the war went on greatly to the diſadvantage of the Spartans; but he being killed at the battle of Mantinea, all parties became quickly deſirous of peace. Ageſilaus did not long ſurvive ; and with him, we may ſay, periſhed the glory of Sparta. Soon after this all the ſtates of Greece fell under the power of Alexander the Great ; and the Spartans, as well as the rest, having become corrupt and loſt their martial ſpirit, became a prey to domeſtic tyrants, and to foreign invaders. They maintained their ground, however, with great reſolution againſt the celebrated Pyrrhus king of Epirus ; whom they repulſed for three days ſucceſſively, though not without aſſiſtance from one of the captains of Antigonus, boon after this one of the kings of Sparta named <hi rend="italic">Agis,</hi> perceiving the univerſal degeneracy that had taken place, made an attempt to reſtore the laws and diſcipline of Lycurgus, by which he ſuppoſed the ſtate would be reſtored to its former glory. But though at firſt he met with ſome appearance of ſucceſs, he was in a ſhort time tried and condemned by the ephori as a traitor to his country. Cleomenes, however, who aſcended the throne in 216 B. C. accompliſhed the reformation which Agis had attempted in vain. He ſuppreſſed the ephori ; cancelled all debts ; divided the lands equally, as they had been in the time of Lycurgus ; and put an end to the luxury which prevailed among the citizens. But at laſt he was overborne by the number of enemies which ſurrounded him ; and being defeated in battle by Antigonus, he fled to Egypt, where he put an end to his own life. With him periſhed every hope of retrieving the affairs of Sparta : the city for the preſent ſell into the hands of Antigonus; after which a ſucceſſion of tyrants took place ; till at laſt all diſturbances were ended by the Romans, who reduced <hi rend="smallcaps">Macedon</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Greece</hi> to provinces of their empire, as has been related under theſe articles.</p><p>It remains now only to ſay ſomething concerning the character, manners, and cuſtoms of the Spartans, which, as they were founded on the laws of Lycurgus, may beſt be learned from a view of theſe laws.</p><p>The inſtitutions of Lycurgus were divided into 12<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0659.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s04-0653"/>
tables. The firſt comprehended ſuch of the Spartan laws as regarded religion. The ſtatues of all the gods and goddeſſes were repreſented in armour, even to Venus herſelf ; the reaſon of which was, that the people might conceive a military life the moſt noble and honourable, and not attribute, as other nations did, ſloth and luxury to the gods. As to ſacrifices, they conſisted of things of very ſmall value ; for which Lycurgus himſelf gave this reaſon, that want might never hinder them from worſhipping the gods. They were forbidden to make long or raſh prayers to the heavenly powers, and were injoined to aſk no more than that they might live honeſtly and diſcharge their duty. Graves were permitted to be made within the bounds of the city, contrary to the cuſtom of moſt of the Greek nations ; nay, they buried cloſe by their temples, that all degrees of people might be made familiar with death, and not conceive it such a dreadful thing as it was generally eſteemed elſewhere : on the ſame account, the touching of dead bodies, or aſſiſting at funerals, made none unclean, but were held to be as innocent and honourable duties as any other. There was nothing thrown into the grave with the dead body ;. magnificent ſepulchres were forbidden ; neither was there ſo much as an inſcription, however plain or modeſt, permitted. Tears, ſighs, outcries, were not allowed in public, becauſe they were thought diſhonourable in Spartans, whom their lawgiver would have to bear all things with equanimity. Mourning was limited to 11 days ; on the 12th the mourner ſacrificed to Ceres, and threw aſide his weeds. In favour of ſuch as were ſlain in the wars, however, and of women who devoted themſelves to a religious life, there was an exception allowed as to the rules before-mentioned ; for ſuch had a ſhort and decent inſcription on their tombs. When a number of Spartans fell in battle, at a diſtance from their country, many of them were buried together under one common tomb ; but it they fell on the frontiers of their own ſtate, then their bodies were carefully carried back to Sparta, and interred in their family-sepulchres.</p><p>II. Lycurgus divided all the country of Laconia into 30,000 equal ſhares : the city of Sparta he divided into 9000, as ſome ſay ; into 6000, as others ſay ; and, as a third party will have it, into 4500. The intent of the legiſlator was, that property ſhould be equally divided amongſt his citizens, ſo that none might be powerful enough to oppreſs his fellows, or any be in ſuch neceſſity, as to be therefrom in danger of corruption. With the ſame view he forbade the buying or idling theſe poſſeſſions. If a ſtranger acquired a right to any of theſe ſhares, he might quietly enjoy it, provided he ſubmitted to the laws of the republic. The city of Sparta was unwalled ; Lycurgus truſting it rather to the virtue of its citizens than to the art of maſons. As to the houſes, they were very plain ; for their ceilings could only be wrought by the axe, and their gates and doors only by the ſaw ; and their utensils were to be of a like ſtamp, that luxury might have no inſtruments among them.</p><p>III. The citizens were to be neither more nor leſs than the number of city-lots ; and if at any time there happened to be more, they were to be led out in colonies. As to children, their laws were equally harſh and unreaſonable; for a father was directed to carry his new-born infant to a certain place, where the gravest</p><p>men of his tribe looked upon the infant ; and if they perceived its limbs ſtraight, and thought it had a wholeſome look, then they returned it to its parents to be educated ; otherwiſe it was thrown into a deep cavern at the foot of the mountain Taygetus. This law seems to have had one very good effect, viz. making women very careful, when they were with child, of either eating, drinking, or exerciſing, to exceſs : it made them alſo excellent nurſes ; for which they were in mighty requeſt throughout Greece. Strangers were not allowed to reſide long in the city, that they might not corrupt the Spartans by teaching them new cuſtoms. Citizens were alſo forbid to travel, for the ſame reaſon, unleſs the good of the ſtate required it. Such as were not bred up in their youth according to the law, were not allowed the liberty of the city, becauſe they held it unreaſonable, that one who had not ſubmitted to the laws in his youth ſhould receive the benefit of them when a man. They never preferred any ſtranger to a public office ; but if at any time they had occaſion for a perſon not born a Spartan, they firſt made him a citizen, and then preferred him.</p><p>IV. Celibacy in men was infamous, and puniſhed in a moſt extraordinary manner ; for the old bachelor was conſtrained to walk naked, in the depth of winter, through the market-place : while he did this, he was obliged to ling a ſong in disparagement of himſelf; and he had none of the honours paid him which otherwiſe belonged to old age, it being held unreaſonable, that the youth ſhould venerate him who was reſolved to leave none of his progeny behind him, to revere them when they grew old in their turn. The time of marriage was alſo fixed ; and if a man did not marry when he was of full age, he was liable to an action ; as were ſuch alſo as married above or below themſelves. Such as had three children had great immunities; ſuch as had four were free from all taxes whatſoever. Virgins were married without portions ; becauſe neither want ſhould hinder a man, nor riches induce him, to marry contrary to his inclinations. When a marriage was agreed on, the husband committed a kind of rape upon his bride. Husbands went for a long time, ſecretly and by ſtealth, to the beds of their wives, that their love might not be quickly and eaſily extinguished. Husbands were allowed to lend their wives ; but the kings were forbid to take this liberty. Some other laws of the like nature there were, which as they were evidently againſt modeſty, fo they were far from producing the end for which Lycurgus deſigned them ; ſince, though the men of Sparta were generally remarkable for their virtue, the Spartan women were as generally decried for their boldneſs and contempt of decency.</p><p>V. It was the care of Lycurgus, that, from their very birth, the Lacedemonians ſhould be inured to conquer their appetites : for this reaſon he directed, that nurſes ſhould accuſtom their children to spare meals, and now-and-then to faſting ;. that they ſhould carry them, when 12 or 13 years old, to thoſe who ſhould examine their education, and who ſhould carefully obſerve whether they were able to be in the dark alone, and whether they had got over all other follies and weakneſſes incident to children. He directed, that children of all ranks ſhould be brought up in the ſame way ; and that none ſhould be more favoured in food than another, that they might not, even in their<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0660.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s04-0654"/>
infancy, perceive any difference between poverty and riches, but consider each other as equals, and even as brethren, to whom the ſame portions were aſſigned, and who, through the courſe of their lives, were to fare alike : the youths alone were allowed to eat fleſh ; older men ate their black broth and pulſe ; the lads ſlept together in chambers, and after a manner ſomewhat reſembling that ſtill in uſe in Turkey ſor the Janizaries : their beds, in the ſummer, were very hard, being compoſed of the reeds plucked by the hand from the banks of the Eurotas : in winter their beds were ſofter, but by no means downy, or fit to indulge immoderate ſleep. They ate altogether in public ; and in caſe any abſtained from coming to the tables, they were fined. It was likewiſe ſtrictly forbidden for any to eat or drink at home before they came to the common meal; even then each had his proper portion, that every thing might be done there with gravity and decency. The black broth was the great rarity of the Spartans, which was compoſed of ſalt, vinegar, blood, &amp; c. ſo that, in our times, it would be eſteemed a very unſavoury ſoup. If they were moderate in their eating, they were ſo in their drinking alſo ; thirſt was the ſole meaſure thereof ; and never any Lacedemonian thought of drinking for pleaſure : as for drunkenneſs, it was both infamous and ſeverely puniſhed ; and, that young men might perceive the reaſon, ſlaves were compelled to drink to exceſs, that the beaſtlineſs of the vice might appear. When they retired from the public meal, they were not allowed any torches or lights, becauſe it was expected, that men who were perfectly ſober ſhould be able to find their way in the dark : and, besides, it gave them a facility of marching without light ; a thing wonderfully uſeful to them in time oſ war.</p><p>VI. As the poor ate as well as the rich, ſo the rich could wear nothing better than the poor: they neither changed their faſhion nor the materials of their garments ; they were made for warmth and ſtrength, not for gallantry and ſhow : and to this cuſtom even their kings conformed, who wore nothing gaudy in right of their dignity, but were contented that their virtue ſhould diſtinguiſh them rather than their clothes. The youths wore a tunic till they were twelve years old ; afterwards they had a cloak given them, which was to ſerve them a year : and their clothing was, in general, ſo thin, that a Lacedemonian veſt became proverbial. Boys were always uſed to go without ſhoes; but when they grew up, they were indulged with them, if the manner of life they led required it ; but they were always inured to run without them, as alſo to climb up and slip down ſteep places with bare feet : nay, the very ſhoe they uſed was of a particular form, plain and ſtrong. Boys were not permitted to wear their hair ; but when they arrived at the age of twenty, they ſuffered their hair and beard to grow. Baths and anointing were not much in uſe among the Lacedemonians ; the river Eurotas ſupplied the former, and exerciſe the latter. In the field, however, their ſumptuaiy laws did not take place ſo ſtrictly as in the city ; for when they we to war, they wore purple habits ; they put on crowns when they were about to engage the enemy ; they had alſo rings, but they were of iron ; which metal was moſt eſteemed by this nation. Young women wore their veſts or jerkins only to their knees, or, as some think, not quite ſo low ; a cuſtom which both</p><p>Greek and Roman authors cenſure as indecent. Gold, precious ſtones, and other coſtly ornaments, were permitted only to common women ; which permiſſion was the ſtrongeſt prohibition to women of virtue, or who affected to be thought virtuous. Virgins went abroad without veils, with which married women, on the contrary, were always covered. In certain public exerciſes, in which girls were admitted as well as boys, they were both obliged to perform naked. Plutarch apologiſes for this cuſtom, urging, that there could be no danger from nakedneſs to the morals of youth whoſe minds were fortified and habituated to virtue. One of Lycurgus’s principal views in his inſtitutions, was to eradicate the very seeds of civil diſſension in his republic. Hence proceeded the equal diviſion of eſtates injoined by him ; hence the contempt of wealth, and the neglect of other distinctions, as particularly birth, he considering the people of his whole ſtate as one great family ; diſtinctions which, in other commonwealths, frequently produce tumults and confusions that ſhake their very foundation.</p><p>VII. Though the Spartans were always free, yet it was with this reſtriction, that they were ſubſervient to their own laws, which bound them as ſtrictly in the city as ſoldiers, in other ſtates, were bound by the rules of war in the camp. In the firſt place, ſtrict obedience to their ſuperiors was the great thing required in Sparta. This they looked upon as the very baſis of government; without which neither laws nor magiſtrates availed much. Old age was an indubitable title to honour in Sparta : to the old men the youth roſe up whenever they came into any public place ; they gave way to them when they met them in the ſtreets, and were silent whenever their elders ſpoke. As all children were looked upon as the children of the ſtate, ſo all the old men had the authority of parents : they reprehended whatever they ſaw amiſs, not only in their own, but in other people’s children ; and by this method Lycurgus provided, that as youth are everywhere apt to offend, they might be nowhere without a monitor. The laws went ſtill further : if an old man was preſent where a young one committed a fault, and did not reprove him, he was puniſhed equally with the delinquent. Amongſt the youths there was one of their own body, or at moſt two years older than the reſt, who was ſtyled <hi rend="italic">iren :</hi> he had authority to queſtion all their actions, to look ſtrictly to their behaviour, and to puniſh them if they did amiſs ; neither were their puniſhments light, but, on the contrary, very ſevere ; whereby the youth were made hardy, and accuſtomed to bear ſtripes and rough uſage. Silence was a thing highly commended at Sparta, where modeſty was held to be a moſt becoming virtue in young people; nor was it reſtrained only to their words and actions, but to their very looks and geſtures; Lycurgus having particularly directed, that they ſhould look forward, or on the ground, and that they ſhould always keep their hands within their robes. A ſtupid inconsiderate perſon, one who would not liſten to inſtruction, but was careleſs of whatever the world might ſay of him, the Lacedemonians treated as a ſcandal to human nature ; with ſuch an one they would not convene, but threw him off as a rotten branch and worthleſs member of ſociety.</p><p>VIII. The plainneſs of their manners, and their being ſo very much addicted to war, made the Lacede-<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0661.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s04-0655"/>
monians leſs fond of the ſciences than the reſt of the Greeks. A ſoldier was the only reputable profeſſion in Sparta ; a mechanic or husbandman was thought a low fellow. The reaſon of this was, that they imagined profeſſions which required much labour, ſome constant poſture, being continually in the houſe, or always about a fire, weakened the body and depreſſed the mind : whereas a man brought up hardily, was equally fit to attend the ſervice of the republic in time of peace, and to fight its battles when engaged in war. Such occupations as were neceſſary to be followed for the benefit of the whole, as husbandry, agriculture, and the like, were left to their ſlaves the Helotes ; but for curious arts, and ſuch as ſerved only to luxury, they would not ſo much as ſuffer them to be introduced in their city ; in conſequence of which, rhetoricians, augurs, bankers, and dealers in money, were ſhut out. The Spartans admitted not any of the theatrical diversions among them ; they would not bear the repreſentation of evil even to produce good ; but other kinds of poetry were admitted, provided the magiſtrates had the peruſal of pieces before they were handed to the public.</p><p>Above all things, they affected brevity oſ ſpeech, and accuſtomed their children, from their very infancy, never to expreſs themſelves in more words than were strictly neceſſary ; whence a conciſe and ſententious oratory is to this day ſtyled <hi rend="italic">Laconic.</hi> In writing they uſed the ſame conciſeneſs; of which we have a ſignal inſtance in a letter of Archidamus to the Eleans, when he underſtood that they had ſome thoughts oſ aſſiſting the Arcadians. It ran thus: “ Archidamus to the Eleans: It is good to be quiet.” And therefore Epaminondas thought that he had reaſon to glory in having forced the Spartans to abandon their monosyllables, and to lengthen their diſcourſes.</p><p>The greateſt part of their education conſiſted in giving their youth right ideas of men and things : the iren or maſter propoſed queſtions, and either commended the anſwers that were made him, or reproved ſuch as anſwered weakly. In theſe queſtions, all matters, either of a trivial or abſtruſe nature, were equally avoided ; and they were confined to ſuch points as were of the higheſt importance in civil life ; ſuch as, Who was the beſt man in the city ? Wherein lay the merit of ſuch an action ? and, Whether this or that hero’s fame was well founded ? Harmleſs raillery was greatly encouraged ; and this, joined to their ſhort manner of ſpeaking, rendered laconic replies univerſally admired.</p><p>Muſic was much encouraged; but in this, as in other things, they adhered to that which had been in favour with their anceſtors ; nay, they were ſo ſtrict therein, that they would not permit their ſlaves to learn either the tune or the words of their moſt admired odes ; or, which is all one, they would not permit them to sing them if they had learned them. Though the youth of the male ſex were much cheriſhed and beloved, as thoſe that were to build up and continue the future glory of the ſtate, yet in Sparta it was a virtuous and modeſt affection, untinged with that ſenſuality which was ſo ſcandalous at Athens. The good effects of this part of Lycurgus’s inſtitutions were ſeen in the union that reigned among his citizens ; and which was ſo extraordinary, that even in caſes of competition, it was hardly known that rivals bore ill-will to each other ; but,</p><p>on the contrary, their love to the ſame perſon begat a ſecondary friendſhip among themſelves, and united them in all things which might be for the benefit of the perſon beloved.</p><p>Some authors have accuſed this great lawgiver of encouraging theft in his inſtitutions ; which, they ſay, was not held ſcandalous among the Spartans, if it were so dexterouſly managed as that the perſen was pot detected in it. But this is certain, and ſeems to be a ſtrong contradiction of the heinous charge, that when a theft was diſcovered, it was puniſhed with the utmoſt ſeverity : a perſon even ſuſpected of it would endure the heavieſt puniſhments rather than acknowledge it, and be branded with ſo baſe a crime.</p><p>IX. The exerciſes inſtituted by law fall under the ninth table. In theſe all the Greeks were extremely careful, but the Lacedemonians in a degree beyond the reſt ; ſor if a youth, by his corpulence, or any other means, became unfit for theſe exerciſes, he underwent public contempt at leaſt, if not baniſhment.— Hunting was the uſual diverſion of their children ; nay, it was made a part of their education, becauſe it had a tendency to ſtrengthen their limbs, and to render thoſe who practiſed fit ſupple and fleet: they likewiſe bred up dogs for hunting with great care. They had a kind of public dances, in which they exceedingly delighted, and which were common alike to virgins and young men : indeed, in all their ſports, girls were allowed to divert themſelves with the youths ; inſomuch that, at darting, throwing the quoit, pitching the bar, and ſuch-like robuſt diverſions, the women were as dexterous as the men. For the manifeſt oddity of this proceeding, Lycurgus aſſigned no other reaſon, than that he sought to render women, as well as men, ſtrong and healthy, that the children they brought forth might be ſo too. Violent exerciſes, and a laborious kind of life, were only enjoined the youth ; for when they were grown up to mens eſtate, that is, were upwards of 30 years old, they were exempted from all kinds of labour, and employed themſelves wholly either in affairs of ſtate or in war. They had a method of whipping, at a certain time, young men in the temple of Diana, and about</p><p>her altar ; which, however palliated, was certainly unnatural and cruel. It was eſteemed a great honour to ſustain theſe flagellations without weeping, groaning, or ſhowing any ſenſe of pain ; and the thirſt of glory was ſo ſtrong in theſe young minds, that they very frequently ſuffered death without shedding a tear or breathing a ſigh. A deſire of overcoming all the weaknefſes of human nature, and thereby rendering his Spartans not only ſuperior to their neighbours, but to their ſpecies, runs through many of the inſtitutions of Lycurgus ; which principle, if well attended to, thoroughly explains them, and without attending to which it is impoſſible to give any account of them at all.</p><p>X. Gold and ſilver were, by the conſtitutions of Lycurgus, made of no value in Sparta; He was ſo well apprized of the danger of riches, that he made the very poſſeſſion of them venal ; but as there was no living without ſome sort of money, that is, ſome common meaſure or ſtandard of the worth of things he directed an iron coinage, whereby the Spartans were ſupplied with the useful money, and at the same time had no temptation to covetouſneſs afforded them ; for a very ſmall ſum was ſufficient to load a couple of horſes, and<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0662.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s04-0656"/>
a great one muſt have been kept in a barn or ware- house. The coming in of all foreign money was alſo prohibited, that corruption might not enter under the name of commerce. The moſt ancient method of dealing, viz. by barter, or exchange of one commodity for another, was preſerved by law in Sparta long after it had been out of date everywhere elſe. Intereſt was a thing forbidden in the Spartan commonwealth ; where they had alſo a law againſt alienation of lands, accepting preſents from foreigners, even without the limits of their own country, and when their authority and character might well ſeem to excuſe them.</p><p>XI. Such of the laws of Sparta as related to courts of juſtice may be brought under the 11th table. Thirty years muſt have paſſed over the head of him who had a right to concern himſelf in juridical proceedings. Young men were thought unfit for them ; and it was even held indecent, and of ill report, for a man to have any fondneſs for law-ſuits, or to be buſying himſelf at the tribunals, when he had no affairs there of his own. By theſe rules Lycurgus thought to ſlrut out litigiouſneſs, and to prevent that multiplicity of ſuits which is always ſcandalous in a ſtate. As young people were not permitted to inquire about the laws of other countries, and as they were hindered from hearing judicial proceedings in their courts, ſo they were likewiſe forbidden to aſk any queſtions about, or to endeavour to diſcover, the reaſons of the laws by which themſelves were governed. Obedience was their duty ; and to that alone they would have them kept. Men of abandoned characters, or who were notoriouſiy of ill fame, loſt all right of giving their votes in reſpect of public affairs, or of ſpeaking in public aſſemblies ; for they would not believe that an ill man in private life could mean his country better than he did his neighbour.</p><p>XII. Till a man was 30 years old, he was not capable of ſerving in the army, as the beſt authors agree ; though ſome think that the military age is not well aſcertained by ancicnt writers. They were forbidden to march at any time before the full-moon ; the reaſon of which law is very hard to be diſcovered, if indeed it had any reaſon at all, or was not rather founded on ſome superſtitious opinion, that this was a more lucky conjuncture than any other. They were likewiſe forbidden to fight often againſt the ſame enemy ; which was one of the wiſeſt maxims in the political ſyſtem of Lycurgus : and Ageſilaus, by offending againſt it, deſtroyed the power of his country, and loſt her that authority which for many ages ſhe maintained over the reſt of Greece ; for, by continually warring againſt the Thebans, to whom he had an inveterate hatred, he at laſt beat them into the knowledge of the art of war, and enabled them, under the command of Epaminondas, to maintain for a time the principality of Greece. Maritime affairs they were forbidden to meddle with, though the neceſſity of things compelled them, in proceſs of time, to tranſgreſs this inſtitution, and by degrees to transfer to themſelves the dominion of the ſea as well as of the land: but, after the Peloponneſian war, they again neglected naval affairs, from a perſuaſion that ſailors and ſtrangers corrupted thoſe with whom they converſed. As they never fortified Sparta, they were not ready to undertake ſieges : fighting in the field was their proper province, and, while they</p><p>could overcome their enemies there, they rightly conceived that nothing could hurt them at home. In time of war, they relaxed ſomewhat of their ſtrict manner of living, in which they were singular. The true reaſon for this was, in all probability, that war might be leſs burdenſome to them ; for, as we have more than once obſerved, a ſtrong deſire to render them bold and warlike was the reigning passion of their legislator. They were forbidden to remain long encamped in the ſame place, as well to hinder their being ſurpriſed, as that they might be more troubleſome to their enemies, by waſting every corner of their country. They ſlept all night in their armour ; but their outguards were not allowed their ſhields, that, being unprovided of defence, they might not dare to ſleep. In all expeditions they were careful in the performance of religious rites ; and, after their evening-meal was over, the ſoldiers ſung together hymns to their gods. When they were about to engage, the king ſacrificed to the muſes, that, by their aſſiſtance, they might be enabled to perform deeds worthy of being recorded to lateſt times. Then the army advanced in order to the sound of flutes, which played the hymn of Caſtor. The king himſelf ſung the pæan, which was the ſignal to charge. This was done with all the ſolemnity imaginable ; and the ſoldiers were ſure either to die or conquer : indeed they had no other choice ; for if they fled they were infamous, and in danger of being ſlain, even by their own mothers, for diſgracing their families. In this conſiſted all the excellency of the Spartan women, who, if poſſible, exceeded in bravery the men, never lamenting over husbands or ſons, if they died honourably in the field ; but deploring the ſhame brought on their houſe, if either the one or the other eſcaped by flight. The throwing away a ſhield alſo induced infamy ; and, with reſpect to this, mothers, when they embraced their departing ſons, were wont to caution them, that they ſhould either return armed as they were, or be brought back ſo when they were dead ; for, as we have obſerved, ſuch as were ſlain in battle were nevertheleſs buried in their own country. When they made their enemies fly, they purſued no longer than till victory was certain ; becauſe they would ſeem to fight rather for the honour of conquering, than of putting their enemies to death. According to their excellent rules of war, they were bound not to ſpoil the dead bodies of their enemies ; but in proceſs of time, this, and indeed many other of their moſt excellent regulations, fell into deſuetude. He who overcame by ſtratagem, offered up an ox to Mars ; whereas he who conquered by force, offered up only a cock ; the former being eſteemed more manly than the latter. After 40 years ſervice, a man was, by law, no longer required to go into the field ; and conſequently, if the military age was 30 the Spartans were not held invalids till they were 70.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
