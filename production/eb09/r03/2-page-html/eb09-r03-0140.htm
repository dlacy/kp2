                    Pentelic marble by Domitian ; the gilding alone of this last rebuilding is said
                    to have&nbsp;cost 2⅜ millions sterling (Plut., </span><span class="font2"
                    style="font-style:italic;">Publ.,</span><span class="font2"> 15). There has been
                        much&nbsp;controveι<sup>-</sup>sy as to the site of this temple and that of
                    Juno Moneta&nbsp;on the Arx ; but there is an overwhelming mass of evidence
                    to&nbsp;show that the Capitolium is the peak where the Palazzo
                    Caflarelli&nbsp;stands, and that the church of Ara Cceli occupies the Arx.
                    Livy&nbsp;(xxxv. 21) mentions the fall of a mass of rock from the
                    Capitolium&nbsp;into the Vicus Jugarius, which passes close under the
                    Caffarelli&nbsp;summit, ami is not near the opposite peak. Moreover,
                    extensive&nbsp;substructions of tufa and peperino have been exposed on the
                    eastern&nbsp;peak, the form of which appears to fit this nearly square
                    triple&nbsp;temple, and in 1875 a fragment of a fluted column was found,
                    of&nbsp;such great size that it could only have belonged to the temple
                    of&nbsp;Jupiter. Its actual limits have not been clearly made out,
                    and&nbsp;therefore the truth of Dionysius’s description (iv. 61) cannot
                        be&nbsp;proved.@@<sup>2</sup> The temple is represented on many coins, both
                    republican and imperial ; these show that the central cella was that
                    of&nbsp;Jupiter, that of Minerva on his right, and of Juno on his left.
                    The&nbsp;door was covered with gold reliefs, which were stolen by
                    Stilicho&nbsp;(c. 390 ; Zosim., v. 38), and the gilt bronze tiles (Plin.,
                    xxxiii. 18)&nbsp;on the roof were partly stripped off by Genseric in 455
                    (Procop., </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">De&nbsp;Belk
                    Vanrl.,</span><span class="font2"> i. 5), and the rest by Pope Honorius I. in
                    630 (Marliano,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"
                    >Topogr.,</span><span class="font2"> ii. 1). Till 1348, when the steps up to Ara
                    Cceliwere&nbsp;built, there was no access to the Capitol from the back ; hence
                    the&nbsp;three ascents to it mentioned by Livy (iii. 7, v. 26-28) and
                    Tacitus&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"

                    Servian circuit.&nbsp;Even on this inner side it was defended by a wall, the
                    gates in&nbsp;which are called ‘<sup>i</sup>Capitolii fores” by Tacitus. Part of
                    the outer&nbsp;wall at the top of the tufa rock, which is cut into a smooth
                    cliff,&nbsp;is visible from the modern Vicolo della Rupe Tarpeia ; this cliff
                    is&nbsp;traditionally called the Tarpeian rock, but that must have been
                    on&nbsp;the other side towards the Forum, from whence it was visible, as&nbsp;is
                    clearly stated by Dionysius (vii. 35, viii. 78).@@<sup>3</sup> Another
                    piece&nbsp;of the ancient wall has recently been exposed, about half-way
                    up&nbsp;the slope from the Forum to the Arx. It is built of soft
                    yellow&nbsp;tufa blocks, five courses of which still remain in the existing
                    fragment. The large temple of Juno Moneta (“the Adviser”) on the&nbsp;Arx, built
                    by Camillus in 384 b.c., was used as the mint ; hence&nbsp;</span><span

            <p><span class="font2">A large number of other temples and smaller shrines stood on the
                    Capitoline Hill, a word used broadly to include both the&nbsp;Capitolium and the
                        Arx.@@<sup>4</sup> Among these were the temple of Honos&nbsp;and Virtus,
                    built by Marius, and the temple of Fides, founded&nbsp;by Numa, and rebuilt
                    during the First Punic War. Both these&nbsp;were large enough to hold meetings
                    of the Senate. The temple of&nbsp;Jupiter Tonans@@<sup>5</sup> was built by
                    Augustus (Suet., </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"
                    >Aug.,</span><span class="font2"> 29), near the&nbsp;great temple of Jupiter.
                    Other shrines existed to Venus Victrix,&nbsp;Ops, Jupiter Custos, and
                    Concord—the last under the Arx (Liv.,&nbsp;xxii. 33)—and many others, as well as
                    a triumphal arch in honour&nbsp;of Nero, and a crowd of statues and other works
                    of art (see Plin.,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"

                    xxxvi. 5, 8),&nbsp;so that the whole hill must have been a mass of architectural
                    and&nbsp;artistic magnificence, the spoils of the whole Hellenic
                world.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font2">The so-called Tabularium occupies the central part of the side
                    towards the Forum ; it is set on the tufa rock, which is cut away&nbsp;to
                    receive its lower story. It derives its name from an inscription&nbsp;found
                    there in the 15th century, quoted by Poggio (see Gruter,&nbsp;</span><span

                    xliii. 16), and there is no reason to suppose&nbsp;that this specially was known

                    part of this building is probably much earlier&nbsp;in date. Its outer walls are
                    of peperino, its inner ones of tufa or&nbsp;concrete ; the Doric arcade has
                    capitals and architrave of travertine.@@<sup>6</sup> A road paved with basalt
                    passes through the building along&nbsp;this arcade, entered at one end from the
                    Clivus Capitolinus, and&nbsp;at the other probably from the Gradus Monetæ, a
                    flight of steps&nbsp;leading from the temple of Concord and the Forum up to
                    the&nbsp;temple of Juno Moneta on the Arx (see Plate VII.). The
                entrance</span></p></div><br clear="all" /><div>
            <p><span class="font2">from the Clivus Capitolinus is by a wide flat arch of peperino
                    most beautifully jointed ; the other end wall has been mostly
                    destroyed.&nbsp;The back of this building overlooked the Asylum or
                    depression&nbsp;between the two peaks. From this higher level a long steep
                    staircase of sixty-four steps descends towards the Forum ; the doorway&nbsp;at
                    the foot of these stairs has a flat arch, with a circular relieving&nbsp;arch
                    over it ; it was completely blocked up by the temple of Vespasian (see fig. 1).
                    This was probably the door where the Vitellian&nbsp;rioters broke into the
                    Capitolium (Tac., </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"
                    >HiM.,</span><span class="font2"> iii. 71).@@<sup>7</sup> Great&nbsp;damage was
                    done to this building by the additions of Boniface&nbsp;VIIL and Nicholas V., as
                    well as by its being used as a salt store,&nbsp;by which the walls were much
                        corroded.@@<sup>8</sup></span></p>

            <p><span class="font2">The Forum Julium (see fig. 18), with its central temple of Venus
                    Genitrix, was begun in 49 B.c. after the battle of Rharsalia bj&gt;&nbsp;Julius
                    and completed by Augustus.@@<sup>9</sup> Being built on a crowded&nbsp;site it
                    was somewhat cramped, and the ground cost nearly a hundred&nbsp;million
                        sesterces.@@<sup>10</sup> Part of its circuit wall, with remains of
                    five&nbsp;arches, exists in the Via Marmorella ; and behind is a row of
                    small&nbsp;vaulted rooms, probably shops or offices.@@<sup>11</sup> The arches
                    are flat,&nbsp;slightly cambered, with travertine springers and keys ; the
                    rest,&nbsp;with the circular relieving arch over, is of tufa ; it was once
                    lined&nbsp;with slabs of marble, the holes for which exist. Foundations
                    of&nbsp;the circuit wall exist under the houses towards S. Adriano, but
                    the&nbsp;whole plan has not been made out. Palladio </span><span class="font2"
