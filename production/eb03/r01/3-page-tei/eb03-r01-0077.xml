Accordingly, the firft object of his attention was the inſtruction of his people in the ſa-cred doctrines of the Holy Scriptures : for which pur-poſe he invited into his dominions feveral learned Ger-mans, and ſpread abroad through the kingdom the Swediſh tranſlation of the Bible that had been made by olaus Petri. Some time after this, in 1526, he appointed a conference at Upfal, between this reformer and Peter Gallius, a zealous defender of the ancient ſu-perſtition, in which each of the champions was to bring forth his arguments, that it might be ſeen on which fide the truth lay. In this diſpute olaus obtained a fignal victory ; which contributed much to confirm Guſtavus in his perſuaſion of the truth of Luther’s doc-trine, and to promote its progrefs in Sweden. The following year another event gave the finiſhing ſtroke to its propagation and ſuccefs. This was the aſſembly ¢f the ſtates at weſteraas, where Guſtavus recommend-ed the doctrine of the reformers with ſuch zeal, that, after warm debates fomented by the clergy in general, rt was unanimouſly refolved that the reformation introduced by Lutiιer ſhould have place in Sweden. This refolution was principally owing to the firmneſs and magnanimity of Guſtavus, who declared publicly, that he would lay down the fceptre and retire from the kingdom, rather than rule a people enſlaved by the orders and authority of the pope, and more contracted by the tyranny of their biſhops than by the laws of their monarch. From this time the papal empire in Sweden was entirely overthrown, and Guſtavus declared head of the church.</p><p>In Denmark, the reformation was introduced as early as the year 1 ς2τ, in conſequence of the ardent deſire diſcovered by Chriſtiern II. of having his fubjects in-ſtructed in the doctrines of Luther. This monarch, notwithſtanding his cruelty, for which his name has been rendered odious, was nevertheleſs deſirous of delivering his dominions from the tyranny of the church of Rome. For this purpofe, in the year 1 Ç20, he ſent for Martin Reinard, one of the difciples of Carloſtadt, out of Saxony, and appointed him profeffor of divinity at Hafnia ; and after his death, which happened in 1521, he invited Carloſtadt himielf to fill that important place. Carloſtadt accepted of this office indeed, but in a ſhort time returned to Germany ; upon which Chriſtiern uſed his utmoſt endeavours to engage Lu-ther to viſit his dominions, but in vain. However, the progreſs of Chriſtiern, in reforming the religion of his ſubjects, or rather of advancing his own power above that of the church, was checked, in the year 1523, by a conſpiracy, by which he was depofed and baniſhed ; his uncle Frederic·, duke of Holilein and Sleſwic, being appointed his ſucceſſor.</p><p>Frederic conducted the reformation with much greater prudence than his predeceſſor. He permitted the Proteſtant doctors to preach publicly the fentiments of Luther, but did not venture to change the eſtabliſh-ed government and diſcipline of the church. However, he contributed greatly to the progreſs of the reforma-tion, by his ſucceſsful attempts in favour of religious liberty in an aſſembly of the ſtates held at odenſee in 1527. Here he procured the publication of a famous</p><p>edict, by which every ſubject of Denmark was deekj' red free either to adhere to the tenets of the church of Rome, or to tfie doctrine of Luther. The papal tyranny was totally deſtroyed by his ſucceſſor Chri-ſtiern III. He began by ſuppreſſing the deſpotic au» thority of the biſhops, and reſtoring to their lawful owners a great part of the wealth and poſſeſſions which the church had acquired by various ſtratagems. Ι'fiis was followed by a plan of religious doctrine, worſhip, and discipline, laid down by Bugenhagius, whom the king had ſent for from wittemberg for that purpoſe ; and in 1539 <hi rend="sup">an</hi> aſſembly oſ the ſtates at odenſee gave a ſolemn ſanction to all theſc tranſactions.</p><p>In France alſo, the reformation began to make ſome progreſs very early. Margaret queen of Navarre, fiſter to Francis I. the perpetual rival of Charles V. was a great friend to the new doctrine ; and it appears that, as early as the year 1523, there were in ſeveral of the provinces of France great numbers of people who had conceived the greateſt averſion both to the doctrine and tyranny of the church of Rome ; among whom were many of the firſt rank and dignity, and even ſome of the epiſcopal order. But as their number increafed daily, and troubles and commotions were excited in ſeveral places on account of the religious differences, the authority of the king intervened, and many perſons eminent for their virtue and piety were put to death in the moſt barbarous manner. Indeed Francis, who had either no religion at all, or, at beſt, no fixed and conſiſtent fyſtem of religious principles, conducted himſelf towards the Proteſtants in ſuch a manner as beſt anſwered his private views. Sometimes he reſolved to invite Melancthon into France, probably with a view to pleaſe his fiſter the queen of Navarre, whom he loved tenderly, and who had ſtrongly imbibed the Proteſtant principles. At other times he eχ-ercifed the moſt infernal cruelty towards the reformed ; and once made the following mad declaration, That if he thought the blood in his arm was tainted by the Lutheran hereſy, he woctd have ſt cut off ; and that he woctd not ſpare even his own children, if they en-tertained ſentiments contrary to thoſe of the Catholic church.</p><p>About this time the famous Calvin began to draw the attention of the public, but more eſpecially of the queen of Navarre His zeal expofed him to danger j and the friends of the reformation, whom Francis was daily committing to the flames, placed him more than once in the moſt perilous ſituation, from which he was delivered by the interpoſition of the queen of Navarre. He therefore retired out of France to Baſil in Swiſſei-land; where he publiſhed his Chriſtian Inſtitutions, and became afterwards ſo famous.</p><p><hi rend="sup">l</hi>pmfe <hi rend="sup">amon</hi>S' <hi rend="sup">t</hi>^<hi rend="sup">ιe</hi> French who firſt renounced the juriſdiction of the Romiſh church, are commonly called<hi rend="italic">Lutherans</hi>  by the writers of thoſe early times. Hence it has been ſuppoſed that they had all imbibed the peculiar ſentiments of Luther. But this appears by no means to have been the caſe : for the vicinity of the cities of Geneva, Laufanne, &amp;c. which had adopted the doctrines of Calvin, produced a remarkable effect upon the French Proteſtant churches ; infomuch that, about the middle of this century, they all entered into communion with the church of Geneva.
