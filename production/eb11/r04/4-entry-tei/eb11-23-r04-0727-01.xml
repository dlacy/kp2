                <p><label>ROSCOFF</label> a maritime town and watering-place of northwestern France,
                    in the department of Finist√®re, on the English Channel, 17 J m. N.N.W. of
                    Morlaix by rail. Pop. (1906) town, 1984; commune, 5054. Roscoff, separated from
                    the Ile de Batz by a narrow channel, has a tidal port used by fishing and
                    coasting vessels. Many of the inhabitants are engaged in the cultivation of
                    early vegetables, to the growth of which the mild climate and fertile soil is
                    eminently favourable. The church of Roscoff (16th century) has a fine
                    Renaissance tower and contains interesting alabaster bas-reliefs. The ruined
                    chapel of St Ninian commemorates the landing at Roscoff in 1548 of Mary Stuart,
                    previous to her betrothal with the dauphin, son of Henry II. In 1746 Charles
                    Edward, the young Pretender, landed at the port after his defeat at Culloden.</p>
