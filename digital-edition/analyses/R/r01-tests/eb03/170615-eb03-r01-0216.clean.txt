overturned the French monarchy. Almost all the men of property in the kingdom concurred with the ministry in thinking a war with France necessary for the purpose of securing the constitution at home. After the loth of August the British minister had been recalled; but the new republic still suffered the former ambassa dor from France, M. Chauvelin, to remain in England. 
The oftensible grounds 
of 
quarrel on the part of Great Britain were chiefly two; the decree of the 15th of November 1792, by which 
it 
was truly observed that encouragement to rebellion was held out to the subjects of every state, and that war was thereby waged against every established government. Of this decree the French executive council gave explanations, denying the fairness of the interpretation put upon it, and alleging, that the intention of the convention was only to give aid to such countries as 
had already 
acquired their freedom, and by a declaration of the general will requested aid for its preservation. But this explanation cannot be admitted. The decree expressly says, that the French nation will 
grant coffiftancedo all who wish to procure liberty; 
and when it is considered what their notions of liberty are, it cannot be doubted but that their intention was to excite rebellion in foreign nations. The second point of dispute referred to the opening of the scheldt. This river runs from Brabant through the Dutch territory to the sea. The Dutch had shut up the mouth of it, and prevented any maritime commerce from being carried on by the people of Brabant by means of the river. To render themselves popular in Brabant,; he French had declared, that they would open the navigation of the scheldt. But Great Britain had some time before bound herself by treaty with the Dutch to assist them in obstructing this nayigation, and now declared to the French, that the project of opening the scheldt mnst be renounced if peace with Great Britain was to remain. The French alleged, that by the law of nations navigable rivers ought to be' open to all who reside on their banks; but that the point was of no importance either to France or England, and even of very little importance to Holland; that if the people of Brabant themselves chose to give it up, they would make no objection. It has been thought remarkable, that the Dutch gave themselves no trouble about the matter. They did not ask the asslstance of England; and with that coolness which is peculiar to their character, the merchants in dividually declared, that if the scheldt was opened, they could manage their commerce as well at Antwerp as at Amsterdam. But in all this there is nothing strange. Among the Dutch were many republicans, wlio wished for the downfall of the stadtholder. These rejoiced at everything which distressed him, or had a tendency to render his office useless in the eyes of the people. Others, who thought disserently, were afraid to speak their sentiments,, as Dumourier was in their neighbourhood with a victorious army. The result of the whole was, that M. Chauvelin was commanded by the Brstish government to leave this country. The French executive council gave powers to another mini ster, M. Maret, to negotiate, and requested a passport for him; but he was not sussered to land. The haughty republicans having thus sar humbled themselves before the British government, at last, on the ist of February 1793, on the motion of Brissot, the national convention decreed, among other articles, that " George king of England had never ceased since the revolution 
of the 10th of August 1792 from giving 
to the 
French nation proofs of his attachment to the concert of crowned heads; that he had drawn into the same lake the stadtholder of the United Provinces; that, contrary to the treaty of 1783, the English ministry had granted protection to the emigrants and others who have openly appeared in arms against France; that they have committed an outrage against the French repnb lic, by ordering the ambassador of France to quit Great Britain; that the English have stopped diverse boats and vessels laden with corn for France, whilst, at the same time, contrary to the tieaty of 1786, they con tinue the exportation of it to other foreign countries; that to thwart more efficaciousiy the commercial trans actions of the republic with England, they have by an act of parliament prohibited the cmculation of assignats. The convention therefore 
declare, 
that in consequence of these acts of hostility and aggression, the French republic is at war with the king of England and the stadtholder of the United Provinces.” 
The absurdity of pretending that any treaty with France made in 1783 could be violated hy protecting the emigrants who fled from the fury of the convention, must be obvious to every reader. The convention was itself a rebellious usurpation of the government with which such a treaty was made. The prohibition of assignats was certainly contrary to no law, and was sanc tioned by every motive of expediency, unless the convention could prove that all nations were bound by the law of nature to risk their own credit upon the credit of the Frencll republic. 
About a fortnight after this absurd declaration against Britain, war was likewise declared against spain; and in the course of the summer France was at war with all Europe, excepting only swisserland, sweden, Denmark, and Turkey. 
In the mean time General Dumourier, who was proceeding agreeably to his orders, made an attack upon Holland; but in doing this he dispersed his troops in such a manner as to expose them much to any attack on the side of Germany. He commanded General mi randa to invest Maastricht, while he advanced to block up Breda and bergen op zoom. The sirst of these places, viz. Breda, surrendered on the 24th of February; Klundert was taken on the 26th; and Gertruydenberg on the 4th of March. But here the triumphs of Dumourier ended. The sieges of williamstadt and bergen op zoom were vigorousty but unsuccesssully pressed. On the ist of March General Clairfait having passed the Roer, attacked the French posts, and compelled them to retreat with the loss of 2000 men. 
The following day the archduke attacked them anew with considerable success. On the 3d the French were driven from aix la chapelie, with the loss of 4000 men killed and 1600 taken prisoners. 
The siege of Maastricht was now raised, and the French retreated to Tongres, where they were also at tacked and forced to retreat to st Tron. Dumourier here joined them, but did not bring his army along with him from the attack upon Holland. After some skirmishes a general engagement took place at near winden. It was fought on the part of the French with great obstinacy; but they were at length overpowered by the number of their enemies, and perhaps also by the treachery of their commander. This de feat 
was fatal. The French lost 3000 
men, and
