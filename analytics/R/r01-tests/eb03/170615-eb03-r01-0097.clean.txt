mandiug his freight in a surly tone, and 
an uxorious 
monarch, are objects too familiar and ludicrous not to degrade the dignity of those awful scenes which are represented as the mansions of the dead, and to prevent them from making a deep enough impression on thc imagination. The actions and qualities, too, for which departed spirits were admitted into Elysium, or doom ed to the regions of suffering, were not always of such 
a 
nature as under a well regulated government on earth would have been thought to merit reward, or to be worthy of punishment, It was not always virtue or wisdom which conducted to the Elysian fields, or gain ed admission into the society of the immortal gods. — Ganitnede was for a very different reason promoted to be the cupbearer of Jove; and Hercules and Bacchus could not surely plead that any merits of that kind en titled them to seats in the council, and at the banquets of the immortals. That doctrine, likewise, which represented mortals ns hurried by fate to the commission of crimes, which they could no more abstain from com mitting than the sword can avoid to obey the impulse of a powerful and furious arm plunging it into the breast of an unresisting antagonist, could not but pro duce effects unfavourable to virtue; and it afforded a ready excuse for the most extravagant crimes. 
Ύ 
ct, after all, he who attentively considers the ideas of thc Greeks and Romans concerning the moral government of the world and a future state of rewards and punishments, will probably acknowledge, that their general influence must have been favourable to virtue and moral order. Allow them to have been incorrect and dashed with absurdity; still they represent punishments prepared for such qualities and actions as were injurious 
to 
the welfare of society; whilst, for those qualities which rendered men eminently useful in the world, they hold forth a reward. Though incorrect, their ideas con cerning a future state were exceedingly distinct; they were not vague or general, but such as might be readi iy conceived by the imagination, in all their circumstances, as really existing. when a man is told that for such a deed he will be put to death, he may fhud -- «ier and be alarmed, and think of the deed as what he jnust by no means commit; but place before him the scene and the apparatus sor his execution, call him to behold some other criminal mounting the scaffold, addressing his last words in a wild icream of despair to the surrounding spectators, and then launching into eternity — his horror of the crime, and his dread of the punishment, will now be much more powerfully excited. In the same manner, to encourage the soldier marching out te battle, or the mariner setting sail under the pro spect of a storm, promise not, merely in general terms, 
a 
liberal reward; be sure to specify the nature of the reward which you mean to bestow; describe it so as that 
it 
may take hold on the imagination, and may rise in opposition to the images of death and danger with which his courage is to be assailed. 
If these phenomena of die human mind are fairly stated, if it be true that general ideas produce no very powerful effects oa the sentimente and dispositions of the human heart, it must then be granted, that though the scenes of future reward and punishment, which the heathens considered as prepared for the righteous and the wicked, were of a somewhat motley complexion; 
yet 
still, as they were distinct and even minute draughts, they must 
have been 
favourable to virtue, and contribu ted in no inconsiderable degree to the support of civil order. 
Another thing 
of 
which we may take notice under this head, is the vast multiplicity of deities with which the Greek and Roman mythology peopled ali the 
regions 
of nature. Flocks and fields, and woods and oaks, and flowers, and many much more minute objects, had all their guardian deities. Tllese were somewhat capricious at times, it is true, and expected to have attention paid them. But yet the faithful shepherd, and the industrioue farmer, knew generally how to acquire their friendship; and in the idea of deities enjoying the same simple pleasures, partaking in the same labours, protecting their possessions, and bringing forward the fruits of the year, there could not but be something of a very pleasing nature, highly favourable to industry, which would animate the labours, and cheer the sesti vals, of the good people who entertained such a notion; nay, would diffuse a new charm over all the seen of the country, even in the gayest months of the year. 
From all of these particular observations, we think ourselves warranted to conclude, that notwithstanding the mixed characters of the deities who were adored by the celebrated nations of antiquity; though they are in many instances represented as conspicuous for vices and frolics; however vain, absurd, and morally criminal, some of the rites by which they were worshipped may have been, and however incorrect the notions of the heathens concerning the moral government of the universe and a future state of retribution; yet still, after making 
a 
just allowance for all these imperfections, the general influence of their religious system was rather favourable than unfavourable to virtue and to the order and hap piness of society. 
It was not without good reason that the earliest legis lators generally endeavoured to establish their laws and constitutsons on the basis of religion; government needs the support of opinion; the governed must be impressed with a belief that the particular establishment to which they are required to submit, is the best calculated for their security and happiness, or is supported on sume such solid foundation, that it must prove, impossible sor them to overturn it, or is connected with some awsul sanction, which it would hc the most hei nous impiety to oppose. Of these several notions, the last will ever operate on most men with the most steady influence. ave are frequently blind to our own interest; even when eager for the attainment of happiness, we often resuse to take the wisest measures for that end. The great bulk of the people in every community are fo little capable of reasoning and foresight, that the public minister who shall most steadily direct his views to the public good will often be the most unpopular. Those laws, and that system of government, which arc the most beneficial, will often excite the strongest popular discontents. Again, it is not always easy to persuade people that your power is superior to theirs, when it is not really sono one man will ever be able to persuade a thousand that he is stronger than they all together; and therefore, in order to persuade one part of his sub jects or army that it is absolutely necessary for them to submit to him, because any attempts to resist his power 
would prove ineffectual, a monarch or general must take care 
sirst 
to persuade another part that it is sor their in
