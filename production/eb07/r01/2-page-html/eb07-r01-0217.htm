<p><span class="font1">as the other two, being the Orations on the Crown, or the accusation and defence of Ctesiphon. Upon these we must&nbsp;enter more minutely, the latter being by far the most admirable of Demosthenes’s works.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">While the Athenians were engaged in their struggle against Philip, Ctesiphon had moved and carried in the&nbsp;assembly of the people a decree for honouring Demosthenes with a civic crown, as a benefactor of his country.&nbsp;After the battle of Chæronæa had made Greece truly a&nbsp;province of Macedon, Philip and his son, by a very sound&nbsp;policy, allowed the Greek citizens to fight out their old&nbsp;political quarrels ; and Athens continued to be torn in&nbsp;pieces by her two factions, as incessantly as when the one,&nbsp;headed by Demosthenes, had opposed Philip to the death,&nbsp;and the other, actuated by very various motives, and led by&nbsp;Æschines in alliance with the virtuous Phocion and others&nbsp;of the aristocratic party, had urged early submission to the&nbsp;conqueror. The latter faction eagerly seized Ctesiphon’s&nbsp;decree as a means of crushing Demosthenes. It was grossly&nbsp;and undeniably illegal in two respects ; having been issued&nbsp;before Demosthenes had given in his accounts for certain&nbsp;public offices which he then held, and having directed the&nbsp;proclamation of the honour to be made in the theatre, not&nbsp;in one of the national assemblies ; both of which acts were&nbsp;forbidden by subsisting laws. If, then, the sole end had&nbsp;been to procure a conviction against Ctesiphon, and if the&nbsp;court appointed to try him had been well informed and impartial, the issue could not have been for a moment doubtful. The court, however, possessed neither of these qualifications ; and, moreover, although Ctesiphon was nominally&nbsp;the person impeached, yet the sentence against him was&nbsp;avowedly intended to be used as a vote of censure on the&nbsp;whole political conduct of Demosthenes, and the proceedings would not, to the slightest extent, have answered the&nbsp;purpose of their promoters unless this should be their understood result. On this ground both parties prepared to&nbsp;fight the battle ; and the contest, prompted by party spirit and personal animosity, involving in its decision no great</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">p</span><span class="font1">olitical question, and debased in its progress by number-less instances of calumny and malevolence on both sides, has nevertheless given us two such specimens of eloquence&nbsp;as neither judicial nor political oratory has equalled before&nbsp;or since.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Those who recollect that this was the real state of the question, will admire the skill and judgment exhibited by&nbsp;Æschines in conducting his argument in support of the&nbsp;accusation; in which, if we are to believe that the parties&nbsp;understood Ctesiphon to be the real and only defendant, he&nbsp;cannot be absolved from the charge of having made a most&nbsp;injudicious, and indeed partially irrelevant choice of topics,&nbsp;and of having by his line of remark wilfully drawn upon&nbsp;himself the triumphant reply of his adversary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The exordium is simple, but very fine : it contains a complaint of factious and unlawful exertions made by the&nbsp;opposite party, and of an inveterate disuse of certain old&nbsp;regulations, which disuse had enabled demagogues to carry laws destructive of the constitution: it declares the&nbsp;right of impeaching the proposers of such measures to be&nbsp;the only remaining safeguard of the state : and it concludes&nbsp;with an animated address, calling on the judges to deal fearlessly with the cause, as the sworn administrators of justice&nbsp;and as citizens intrusted with the protection of the laws&nbsp;and of freedom, like soldiers placed in the front of the battle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The speaker instantly passes to the strong part of his case,—a clear exposition of thc several laws which Ctesiphon’s decree was alleged to have transgressed, a proof from&nbsp;the public records that the decree had in fact violated those&nbsp;enactments, and a statement and refutation of every sophism by which the adversary could be conceived likely to&nbsp;support the plea that the laws did not apply to the notorious&nbsp;facts. His argument, in all its parts, is completely unanswerable ; but it occupies barely a sixth part of the oration ; and the words of the decree, assigning as reasons for&nbsp;the honour conferred on Demosthenes, his virtue, his courage, and his constant pursuit of the true weal of the state,&nbsp;give the cue for the commencement of the attack upon him,&nbsp;the real object of the prosecution. The nominal defendant&nbsp;is dropped as an incumbrance, and the orator girds himself&nbsp;manfully for the serious part of the onset. We cannot follow him through the details of his enemy’s political conduct, private life, doubtful pedigree, and faulty oratory, all&nbsp;of which are described with a plausible minuteness, and&nbsp;with the keenest sarcasm. Political folly is the slightest of&nbsp;the charges : Demosthenes is accused, at every step, of political dishonesty,—of peculation and corruption,—of favour&nbsp;to the Persian king, and co-operation with his views, a&nbsp;charge which was quite true and quite creditable to the accused, but was as skilfully chosen for rousing Athenian prejudices as a charge of combination with France would have&nbsp;been for exciting an English mob in 1793,—and (which&nbsp;sounds rather oddly) he is roundly taxed with a secret attachment to the Macedonian interest, and with the secret&nbsp;acceptance of bribes from Philip. There were two points&nbsp;in which Æschines had a strong hold on his antagonist, and&nbsp;with which he therefore taunts him incessantly : the unhappy issue of the war with Philip, which, it is again and&nbsp;again asserted, had been wholly caused by the policy of&nbsp;Demosthenes ; and that orator’s unfortunate deficiency in&nbsp;personal courage, which had prompted him to a disgraceful&nbsp;flight at the battle of Chæronæa. There are many fine passages in the earlier parts of this long review ; but the orator&nbsp;does not begin to rise steadily till, in closing the main section of his argument under this head, he recalls the glory&nbsp;of the Persian times, and contrasts the simple honours which&nbsp;rewarded the patriotism of Miltiades, Aristides, and the soldiers who conquered in the battle of the Strymon, with the&nbsp;profuse decorations now every day lavished on the chiefs of&nbsp;petty factions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">He then reminds the judges that, after all, from the terms of those articles of impeachment which they sat there to&nbsp;try, even his failure in convincing them that Demosthenes&nbsp;was a bad man and a bad citizen would not entitle Ctesi-phon to an acquittal, since his decree, as proved in the first&nbsp;part of the argument, was at any rate manifestly illegal : he&nbsp;urges them to insist on Ctesiphon or his advocate keeping&nbsp;closely to the point ; and he exhorts them yet more strenuously to compel his adherence to the division of the argument which Æschines had laid down, and still more parti-cularly to the order of the topics adopted in that division.&nbsp;He now proceeds with increased rapidity and vehemence.&nbsp;He anticipates Demosthenes’s passionate style of address,&nbsp;cautions the judges against its effects, and endeavours to&nbsp;render it ridiculous by mimicry. He answers by anticipation, and with much manliness and candour, though with&nbsp;severe recrimination, the personal abuse which he professed to be certain that Demosthenes would heap upon him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">He then, entering on his peroration, passes to a summary of the whole argument, amounting to this, that the decree was illegal, and that, although it had been perfectly&nbsp;regular, Demosthenes was utterly unworthy of the honours&nbsp;which it conferred. He thence rises into one of the noblest&nbsp;and most effective exhortations which the records of oratory&nbsp;have to exhibit ; opening with skilfully chosen instances of&nbsp;the severity with which the existing laws had recently&nbsp;punished citizens who deserted their country, as Demosthenes had deserted his place in battle and his duty as an&nbsp;adviser of the state ; reminding the judges of those feelings&nbsp;of shame with which the Athenians would appear in the&nbsp;presence of Greece at the approaching national convocation,&nbsp;if they should have failed to brand with infamy the destroyer&nbsp;of their country ; and closing with what is perhaps the very&nbsp;grandest extant example of solemn imaginative eloquence.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
