<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The early Celtic settlement of </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Radcspona</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> was chosen by the Romans, who named it </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Castra Regina,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> as the centre of their&nbsp;power on the upper Danube, and it soon attained considerable&nbsp;importance. It afterwards became the seat of the dukes of Bavaria&nbsp;and one of the main bulwarks of the East Frankish monarchy ;&nbsp;and it was also the focus from which Christianity spread over&nbsp;southern Germany. St Emmeran .founded an abbey here in the&nbsp;middle of the 7th century, and St Boniface established the bishopric about a hundred years later. Ratisbon acquired the freedom&nbsp;of the empire in the 13tli century and was for a time the most&nbsp;flourishing city in southern Germany. It became the chief seat&nbsp;of the trade with India and the Levant, and the boatmen of&nbsp;Ratisbon are frequently heard of as expediting the journeys of the&nbsp;crusaders. The city was loyally Ghibelline in its sympathies and&nbsp;was a favourite residence of the German emperors. .Numerous&nbsp;diets were held here from time to time, and after 1663 it became&nbsp;the regular place of meeting of the German diet. The Reformation found only temporary acceptance at Ratisbon and was met&nbsp;by a counter-reformation inspired by the Jesuits. Before this&nbsp;period the city had almost wholly lost its commercial importance,&nbsp;owing to the changes in the great highways of trade. Ratisbon&nbsp;had its due share in the Thirty Years’ and other wars, and is said&nbsp;to have suffered in all no fewer than seventeen sieges. In 1807&nbsp;the town and bishopric were assigned to the prince primate&nbsp;Dalberg and in 1810 they were ceded to Bavaria. After the battle&nbsp;of Eggmiihl (1809) the Austrians retired upon Ratisbon, and the&nbsp;pursuing French defeated them again beneath its walls and reduced&nbsp;great part of the city to ashes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">RATLAM or </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Rutlam, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">a native state of India, in the Western Mahva Agency (Central India Agency), lying between 23° 2' and 23° 36' N. lat. and 74° 42' and 75° 17'&nbsp;E. long., with an area of 729 square miles, and a population (1881) of 87,314 (males 45,779, females 41,535),—&nbsp;Hindus numbering 54,034, Mohammedans 9913, Jains&nbsp;6038, Christians 19, and aboriginals 17,297. Its revenue&nbsp;from all sources in 1881-82 was estimated at ¿6130,000.&nbsp;The Nimach State Railway connecting Indore with Nimach&nbsp;and Nasirabad ¡)asses by Ratlam town. This town, which&nbsp;is one of the principal seats of the opium trade of Malwa,&nbsp;is superior to most cities in Indore, and has good bazaars.&nbsp;Its population in 1881 amounted to 31,066 (16,544 males&nbsp;and 14,522 females).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Ratlam state is held as tributary to Sindhia; but in 1819 an arrangement was made by which the raja agreed to pay an annual&nbsp;tribute amounting to about £6600, while Sindhia engaged never&nbsp;to send any troops into the country or to interfere with the internal administration. This tribute was assigned by the treaty&nbsp;of 1844 between the British Government and Sindhia in part&nbsp;payment of the Gwalior contingent. It is now paid to the British&nbsp;Government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">RATNAGIRI or </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Rtttna.gherry, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">a British district of India, in the Konkan division of the Bombay presidency,&nbsp;with an area of 3922 square miles. It lies between 15°&nbsp;40' and 18° 5' N. lat. and 73° 5' and 73° 55' E. long., and&nbsp;is bounded on the N. by the Savitri river, separating it&nbsp;from the Janjira Agency, and by Kolaba district; on the&nbsp;E. by the Western Ghats, dividing it from the districts of&nbsp;Satara and Belgaum and the native state of Kolhapur;&nbsp;on the S., where it is reduced to a strip of sea-coast not&nbsp;more than 4 miles wide, by the Portuguese possessions of&nbsp;Goa; and on the W. by the Arabian Sea. The district&nbsp;forms a belt between the Ghats and the sea, and its&nbsp;general character is rocky and rugged; nearly all the fertile&nbsp;land lies on the banks of the streams which intersect the&nbsp;country. The coast, about 150 miles in length, is almost&nbsp;uniformly rocky and dangerous. At intervals of about&nbsp;10 miles a river or bay opens, sufficiently large to form a&nbsp;secure harbour for native craft, and the promontories at&nbsp;the river-mouths are almost invariably crowned with the&nbsp;ruins of an old fort. The rivers and creeks are generally&nbsp;navigable for about 20 miles, and afford great facilities for&nbsp;a coasting trade. The denudation of the forests has&nbsp;apparently tended to promote deposits of silt; but active&nbsp;measures have of late been taken to preserve and extend&nbsp;the forest area. Tigers, leopards, bears, bison, wild boar,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sambhar</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> deer, and hyaenas are found in the forests on the</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">slopes and near the foot of the Sahyadri Hills. At the beginning of British rule there were no roads, and traffic&nbsp;was confined to places where there was water carriage;&nbsp;but a network of roads has now been made, and the opening of the Ghat roads to cart traffic has revolutionized&nbsp;the trade and concentrated it at Chiplun, Rajapur, and&nbsp;Yengurla, which form the gates of a considerable traffic&nbsp;to and from the Deccan. The exports are salt fish, shell-lime, and cocoa-nuts, and the imports comprise food&nbsp;grains, molasses, tobacco, chillies, ground nuts, turmeric,&nbsp;ghi, blankets, piece goods, and iron. The mean temperature, as registered at Ratnagiri station, is 78°6־, and the&nbsp;average annual rainfall is 10358־ inches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">In 1881 the population of Ratnagiri district was 997,090 (473,053 males and 524,037 females),—Hindus numbering 921,046, Mohammedans 71,051, and Christians 3275. The district contains three&nbsp;towns with a population exceeding 10,000,</span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">—Ratnagiri </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(see below)! Malwan (15,565), and Chiplun (12,065). Since it came under&nbsp;British rule the number of inhabitants has increased threefold ;&nbsp;all the land is occupied, and the population is greater than the&nbsp;land can feed. Food has in consequence to he imported, and the&nbsp;condition of the people would be deplorable were it not their custom&nbsp;to move in large numbers to Bombay in search of employment,&nbsp;where they earn good wages and return to spend it in their homes.&nbsp;The chief crops are grain and rice. The extent of arable land is&nbsp;small, but on the whole cultivation is good. Of 1,117,686 acres&nbsp;under actual cultivation in 1883-84, of v׳hich 38,865 v<sup>r</sup>ere twice&nbsp;cropped, cereals occupied 1,020,583 and pulses 41,733 acres. There&nbsp;are no manufactures of any importance ; but the school of industry&nbsp;at Ratnagiri possesses steam saw-mills, and undertakes wood and&nbsp;iron work of all descriptions. The revenue of the district in 1883-84&nbsp;amounted to £126,596, of which the land-tax contributed £91,429.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Ratnagiri formed part of the dominions of the peshwa, and was annexed by the British Government in 1818 on the overthrow of&nbsp;Baji Rao.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">RATNAGIRI or </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Rtttnagherry, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">chief town of the above district, is situated on the Konkan coast in lb<sup>3</sup> 59'&nbsp;X. lat. and 73° 19' E. long., 136 miles south by east of&nbsp;Bombay. A leading industry connected with the town is&nbsp;the sardine fishery, which usually takes place in January&nbsp;and February, and engages fleets of canoes. A single&nbsp;net-caster will fill his canoe in the course of a morning.&nbsp;The lighthouse w־as erected in 1867 ; its light, visible 18&nbsp;miles distant, is 250 feet above high water. The population of the town in 1881 numbered 12,616 (males 6418,&nbsp;females 6198).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">RATRAMNUS, a theological controversialist of some mark, who flourished in the 9th century, was a monk of&nbsp;the Benedictine abbey of Corbie near Amiens, but beyond&nbsp;this fact almost nothing of his personal history has been&nbsp;preserved. He is now best known by his treatise on the&nbsp;Eucharist </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">{De corpore et sanguine Domini liber),</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> in which&nbsp;he controverted the doctrine of transubstantiation as taught&nbsp;in a similar work by his contemporary Radbertus Pascliasius&nbsp;(see above, p. 210). In the controversy about election,&nbsp;when appealed to by Charles the Bald, he wrote two&nbsp;books </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">De prsedestinatione Dei,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> in which he maintained the&nbsp;doctrine of a twofold predestination, nor did the fate of&nbsp;Gottschalk deter him from supporting the view of that unfortunate theologian against Hincmar as to the orthodoxy&nbsp;of the expression “trina Deltas.” Ratramnus perhaps&nbsp;won most glory in his own day by his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Contra Graecorum&nbsp;opposita,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> in four books (868), a much valued contribution to&nbsp;the controversy between the Eastern and Western Churches&nbsp;which had been raised by the publication of the encyclical&nbsp;letter of Pliotius in 867.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">RATTAZZI, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Urbano </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(1808-1873), Italian statesman, was born on 29th June 1808 at Alessandria, and from 1838&nbsp;practised with great success at the bar. In 1848 he was&nbsp;sent to the chamber of deputies in Turin as representative&nbsp;of his native town. By his debating powers he contributed&nbsp;to the defeat of the Balbo ministry, and for a short time&nbsp;held the portfolio of minister of public instruction; after-</span></p>
