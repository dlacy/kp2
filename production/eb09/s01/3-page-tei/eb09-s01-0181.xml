The north side of the cathedral is much overlaid by classical and Churrigueresque work ; and the same treatment has been applied to the east end, where is the Puerta Santa, which is kept closed, except in jubilee years, when it is opened by the archbishop. The corner of the south transept on the Plaza do los Plateros has been mutilated by the erection of the clock-tower, but the façade is fortunately preserved intact Perhaps the chief beauty of the cathedral, however, is the Portico de la Gloria, behind the western classic portal. It is a work of the 12th century, and probably the utmost development of which round- arched Gothic is capable. The shafts, tympana, and archivolts of the three doorways which open on to the nave and aisles are a mass of strong and nervous sculpture. The design is a general representation of the Last Judgment, and the subjects are all treated with a quaint grace which shows the work of a real artist Faint traces of colour remain and give a tone to the whole work. The cathedral is at such a height from the ground that it is probable that, until the erection of the present grand staircase, the portico could not be reached from the Plaza, but stood open to the air. There are no marks of doors in the jambs, and the entrance to the chapel beneath would have been blocked by any staircase which differed much in plan from the present one. The interior of the church is one of the purest and best examples of Romanesque work to be met with in Spain. The absence of a clerestory throws an impressive gloom over the barrel-vaulted roof, which makes the building seem larger than it is. A passage leads from the north transept to the Parroquia of San Juan, or La Corticela, a small but interesting portion of the original foundation. Many fine examples of metal work are in the cathedral, as, for instance, the two bronze ambos in the choir by Juan B. Celma of 1563, the gilt chandeliers of 1763, and the enamelled shrines of Sts Cucufato and Fructuoso. In the Capilla del Relicario are a gold crucifix, dated 874, containing a piece of the true cross, and a silver gilt custodia of 1544. The Hospicio de los Reyes, on the north of the Plaza Mayor, for the reception of pilgrims, was begun in 1504 by Enrique de Egas under Ferdinand and Isabella. It consists of two Gothic and two classic court-yards with a chapel in the centre. The gateway is fine, and there is some vigorous carving in the court-yards, one of which contains a graceful fountain. The suppressed Colegio de Fonseca and the adjoining convent of S. Geronimo have good Renaissance doorways. The university, which was created in 1504 by a bull of Pope Julius IL, has fair Renaissance buildings, which date from 1532. Those of the Seminario (1777) have no merit. The chapel of the convent of S. Francisco, the cloisters of the half-ruined S. Augustin, the belfry of S. Domingo, the church of S. Feliz de Celorio, which is a modernized building of the 14th century, and the façades of several houses of the 12th and 13th centuries are also good examples of different architectural styles.</p><p>SANTIAGO (or ST JAGO) DE CUBA, a city and seaport of Cuba, at one time the capital of the whole island, and now the chief town of the eastern department, is situated in 19° 57' 7" N. lat. and 75° 54' 3" W. long, (lighthouse), on a fine bay on the south coast. The spacious and well-defended harbour is accessible to the largest vessels, but silt near the wharf allows only those drawing less than 14 feet to come alongside. The city, which climbs a hill-side 150 feet above the bay, has considerably improved since 1870, though its streets are still badly paved. It contains the largest cathedral in the island, a theatre, a custom-house, barracks (1858-1880), and hospitals. Foundries, soap-works, tan-yards, and cigar factories are the only industrial establishments. The exports were valued in 1867 at £1,650,000, in 1882 at £1,032,200, and in 1883 at £722,632. Besides sugar, which forms about two- thirds of the whole, the principal articles are cocoa, rum, tobacco and cigars, coffee, honey and wax, mahogany, and copper-ore—this last at one time to the extent of 25,000 tons per annum, but now in greatly diminished quantity. The copper mines Lomas del Cobre lie on the other side of the bay inland from Punta de Sal. The estimated population is between 24,000 and 30,000.</p><p>Founded by Diego Velazquez in 1514, and incorporated as a city in 1522, Santiago is memorable mainly for the French occupation and ransom in 1553, and the affair of the ship “Virginius” in 1873, which resulted in the Spanish Government paying an indemnity to the United States for the murder of Captain Fry and his companions.</p><p>SANTIAGO DEL ESTERO, chief town of the province of Santiago in the Argentine Republic, is situated in 27°</p><p>46' S. lat. and 64° 19' W. long., 520 feet above the sea, on the banks of the Rio Dulce. It is the residence of the provincial governor and the seat of the legislature, and it ranks as the oldest European city in the republic, having been founded by Aguirre in 1552. The most conspicuous building is the cathedral, whose dome contrasts strangely by its size and evident costliness with the poverty of the rest of the town. The population is about 8000 (most of whom have a great deal of Indian blood in their veins). The railway from Rosario to Santiago (689 miles) was opened in 1884.</p><p>SANTILLANA, <hi rend="smallcaps">Iñigo Lopez de Mendoza, Marquis of</hi> (1398-1458), Castilian poet, was born at Carrion de los Condes in Old Castile on August 19, 1398. His father, Don Diego Hurtado de Mendoza, grand admiral of Castile, having died while Inigo was still quite young, the boy was brought up by his uncle Don Alfonso Enriquez. From his twentieth year onwards he became an increasingly prominent figure at the court of Juan II. of Castile, distinguishing himself both in civil and military service ; he was created Marques de Santillana and Conde del Real do Manzanares for the part he took in the battle of Olmedo in 1445. In the protracted struggle of the Castilian nobles against the preponderating influence of Alvaro de Luna he showed great moderation, but ultimately in 1452 he joined the combination which effected the fall of the favourite in the following year. From the death of Juan II. in 1454 Mendoza took little part in public affairs, devoting himself mainly to the pursuits of literature and to pious meditation. He died at Guadalajara on March 26, 1458.</p><p>Mendoza was the first to introduce the Italian sonnet into Castile, but his productions in this class are somewhat conventional in style and have little to recommend them beyond the charm of smooth versification. He was much more successful in the <hi rend="italic">scrranilla</hi> or highland pastoral after the Provençal manner. His long-popular <hi rend="italic">Gcntiloquio</hi> (1494), consisting of one hundred proverbs, each rendered in an eight-line stanza, was prepared at the request of Juan II. for the instruction of Don Enrique, the heir-apparent. To the same didactic category belong the <hi rend="italic">Diálogo de Bias contra Fortuna</hi> (1448) and the <hi rend="italic">Doctrinal dc Prívados</hi> (1453). The <hi rend="italic">Comedicta dc Ponza</hi> is a Dantesque dream-dialogue, in octave stanzas, founded on the disastrous sea-fight off Ponza in 1435, when the kings of Aragon and Navarre along with the infante of Castile were taken prisoners by the Genoese.</p><p>The works of Santillana have been edited with commentaries by Amador de los Rios (Madrid, 1852).</p><p>SANTINI, <hi rend="smallcaps">Giovanni</hi> (1787-1877), Italian astronomer, born 30th January 1787 at Caprese, in the province of Arezzo, was from 1813 director of the observatory at Padua. He wrote <hi rend="italic">Elementi di Astronomia</hi> (2 vols. 1820, 2d ed. 1830), <hi rend="italic">Teoria degli Stromenti ottici</hi> (2 vols. 1828), and a great many scientific memoirs and notices, among which are five catalogues of telescopic stars between +10° and -15° declination, from observations made at the Padua observatory. He died June 26, 1877.</p><p>SANTO DOMINGO. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Haytl</hi></p><p>SANTORIN. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Thera.</hi></p><p>SANTOS, a city and seaport of Brazil in the province of São Paulo, is situated on the north side of the island of São Vicente or Engua-Guaçu, which forms the west side of the harbour-bay (an inlet 3<hi rend="superscript">1</hi>/<hi rend="subscript">2</hi> miles deep, with soundings varying from 4 to 10 fathoms). It is a well-built town with wide airy streets, and most of the better classes have their residences at Barra Fort (4 miles out) and other suburban villages. Commercially the town has grown to great importance as the terminus of the whole railway system of this part of Brazil—the Santos and Jundiahy line (1867) running inland 87 miles and connecting with the São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro Railway and various other lines. The export of coffee (the great staple) increased from 344,800 60-kilogramme bags in 1862-3 to 537,478 in 1872-3 and 1,932,194 in 1883-4. The value of the coffee was estimated at £1,630,275 in 1870-71, and at</p></body></text></TEI>
