<p><span class="font2">Christ alone, and knows that to be clean a man must wash his robes in the blood of the Lamb ; nowhere has he made&nbsp;a distinction between Gentile and Jewish Christians ; in&nbsp;this respect he is even more liberal than Paul, for Paul&nbsp;believes in a continued preference accorded to the people&nbsp;of Israel, while our author knows of no such thing;&nbsp;in his view preference is given only to the martyrs and&nbsp;confessors of the latter days ; they alone shall reign with&nbsp;Christ a thousand years ;</span><span class="font1">@@</span><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> the people of Israel, so far as it&nbsp;has rejected Christ, is to our author simply a “ synagogue&nbsp;of Satan ” (ii. 9 ; iii. 9). In this respect it clearly appears&nbsp;that the author of the Apocalypse has cast aside all national&nbsp;religious prejudices.</span><span class="font1">@@</span><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> Accordingly to him Jesus is not the&nbsp;Messiah of the Jews—of this there is no mention in the&nbsp;book—but the Saviour of the world, the Lord of heaven&nbsp;and of earth, the disposer and director of history. The&nbsp;Christology of the Apocalypse is nowhere Ebionitic ;&nbsp;rather it stands midway between that of Paul and that of&nbsp;the Fourth Gospel, and is more elevated than the former :&nbsp;Christ is made almost equal with God and has the same&nbsp;predicates and names as God.</span><span class="font1">@@</span><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Apocalypse teaches us that even in the apostolic age the conceptions of Paulinism and Ebionitism do not&nbsp;explain everything ; it is neither Pauline nor Ebionitic.&nbsp;It shows us that at the close of the apostolic age there was&nbsp;a Christianity which was free from the law and universal,&nbsp;and yet continued to adhere to Jewish modes of expression ; it shows us that it was possible to think and feel like&nbsp;a Jew in politics, and yet in religious thoughts and feelings&nbsp;to be evangelical and superior to all earthly limitations.&nbsp;These, however, are glaring contradictions which could not&nbsp;last. But the fact that in the Apocalypse we possess a&nbsp;document exhibiting these contradictions imparts to the&nbsp;book its high importance. From Paul’s epistles we can only&nbsp;learn how a great mind has worked its way from the&nbsp;letter of the law up to freedom ; from the Apocalypse we&nbsp;can learn how from the Jewish fusion of religion, nationality, and politics thousands were gradually led upwards&nbsp;to the gospel, and we can further learn that the step from&nbsp;the premises to the conclusion is one of the hardest to take.&nbsp;The author of the Apocalypse has in many points not yet&nbsp;drawn the conclusions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Date and Historical Position.—</span><span class="font2">All impartial scholars are now agreed that in chapters xiii. and xviii. of the&nbsp;Apocalypse we must look for the key to the comprehension&nbsp;of the book as well as to the question of the date of its&nbsp;composition. That the beast (xiii. 1 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sq.</span><span class="font2"> ; xvii. 3 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sq.)</span><span class="font2"> is&nbsp;the Roman empire, that the seven heads are seven&nbsp;emperors, that the woman (xvii. 3-9) is the city of&nbsp;Rome, that the ten horns (xiii. 1 ; xvii. 3, 12 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sqO</span><span class="font2"> are&nbsp;imperial governors—all this is now beyond dispute.</span><span class="font1">@@</span><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup> Also&nbsp;it is settled that a Roman emperor will be the antichrist,&nbsp;and that the author abhorred nothing so much as the&nbsp;worship of the emperor. Hence it is very probable, and&nbsp;has been maintained by Mommsen especially on good&nbsp;grounds, that the second beast (xiii. 11) is meant to&nbsp;describe the imperial representatives in the provinces,&nbsp;especially the Roman governors in the Asiatic continent.&nbsp;Finally, almost every one regards the year 64 as the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">terminus a quo</span><span class="font2"> of the composition of the book, inasmuch&nbsp;as the bloody persecution of the Christians in Rome (xiii.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2">7 ; xvii. 6; xviii. 20-24) is presupposed in the narrative.</span><span class="font1">@@</span><span class="font2"><sup>5</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But, while scholars are at one on these points, they still differ on the question of the person of antichrist.&nbsp;The one side affirm that the author regarded Nero returned&nbsp;from the grave as antichrist (so Ewald, Lücke, De Wette,&nbsp;Credner, Reuss, Volckmar, Mommsen, Renan, &amp;c.) ; the&nbsp;other side deny this (so Weiss, Düsterdieck, Bruston,&nbsp;&amp;c.), and try to identify antichrist either with Domitian&nbsp;or with an emperor not defined. But the grounds on&nbsp;which they combat the former hypothesis are of little&nbsp;moment. That the antichrist of the Apocalypse is Nero&nbsp;returned to life results from the following considerations :—&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(1) In ch. xiii. 3 it is said that one of the heads of the beast&nbsp;received a deadly wound but was afterwards healed to the astonishment of the world. Now if it is settled that the beast is the Roman&nbsp;empire, and that by the heads are designated the emperors, the&nbsp;statement is only applicable to Nero, in whose death it is well&nbsp;known that the people did not believe, many persons expecting&nbsp;that he would return from the East.@@<sup>6</sup> (2) In xvii. 8, 11 one head&nbsp;is identified with the whole animal, and of the animal it is said&nbsp;that “it was and is not and will come again,&quot; meaning that the&nbsp;eighth head is not a new one but one of the seven. From this it&nbsp;necessarily follows that in the author’s view the antichrist will be&nbsp;an emperor who has reigned once already and who represents the&nbsp;whole wickedness of the empire (the beast) concentrated and&nbsp;embodied in himself; but this can only be Nero, for of no other&nbsp;emperor was the report current in the empire that he would come&nbsp;again, and no emperor but Nero had instituted a persecution of the&nbsp;Christians. (3) In xiii. 18 it is said that the number of the beast&nbsp;—that is, according to the Hebrew art of Gematria, the sum of the&nbsp;numerical values of the letters of his name—is the number of a&nbsp;man, and is 666. Down to 1835 this saying was a riddle which no&nbsp;man could read, though Irenæus (v. 30) had attempted an explanation : he thought of Teitan, Evanthes, Lateinos. But in 1835&nbsp;Fritzsche, Benary, Reuss, and Hitzig discovered simultaneously&nbsp;that the numerical values of the words ∣1^1J ^ffip (“Emperor&nbsp;Neron ”) = 100 + 60 + 200 + 50 + 200 + 6 + 50 = 666. The old variant&nbsp;616 must be regarded as a confirmation of this explanation, for 616&nbsp;is = 110 1Dp (“ Emperor Nero ”). It may certainly appear strange&nbsp;that the calculation is made according to the numerical value of the&nbsp;Hebrew letters, while the book is written in Greek ; but, as there&nbsp;is no doubt that the author has thought as a Semite from first to&nbsp;last, it is not surprising that he has set forth his great secret in&nbsp;Hebrew letters (comp. ’Ap∕xβγ∈δωv, xvi. 16).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Down to the 5th</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">century it was believed by Western Christians that Nero would come again and be the antichrist or his precursor.@@<sup>7</sup> In the East&nbsp;also this belief can be shown (see the Sibylline oracles) to have still</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">existed in the 2d century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">For these four reasons it is certain that the author of the Apocalypse believed that Nero would come again, and&nbsp;regarded him as the antichrist. He wrote under the&nbsp;impression of the story current in the East that Nero had&nbsp;gone to the Parthians and would return with them to&nbsp;reclaim his empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Hence the Apocalypse was written after the summer of 68 A.D.,</span><span class="font1">@@</span><span class="font2"><sup>8</sup> but the question still remains whether it was&nbsp;written under Galba or Vespasian or Domitian. Most of&nbsp;the scholars who accept the right explanation of the&nbsp;antichrist suppose it to have been written under Galba ;&nbsp;the beginning of Vespasian’s reign is preferred by Lücke&nbsp;(whose earlier opinion was different), Bleek, Böhmer, and&nbsp;also Düsterdieck and Weiss ; Mommsen upholds the later&nbsp;years of Vespasian ; but the old tradition of the church</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">@@@<sup>1</sup> Observe that in his brief description of the millenium (ch. xx.) the author neither speaks of the Jewish people nor introduces any&nbsp;grossly material conception. This is the strongest proof that he was&nbsp;not an Ebionite.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">@@@<sup>2</sup> Compare also xi. 8, where Jerusalem is called “ Sodom and Egypt.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">@@@<sup>3</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Christological conceptions and formulas which occur in the&nbsp;book are not always consistent. This is not, however, in itself a proof&nbsp;of interpolation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">@@@<sup>4</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diisterdieck alone regards the ten horns as emperors.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">@@@<sup>5</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statement of Epiphanius </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">CHær.,</span><span class="font1"> li. 12) that the Apocalypse&nbsp;was written under Claudius is untenable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">@@@<sup>6</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bruston refers the λvounded head to Cæsar ; but what could&nbsp;have induced the author to mention and put in the foreground an&nbsp;event which had taken place about one hundred years before ?</span></p>
