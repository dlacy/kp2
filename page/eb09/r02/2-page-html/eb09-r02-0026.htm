<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Distribution of Reptiles in Time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The first appearance of Reptiles on the surface of the globe is indicated by very fragmentary remains. Specimens of deeply biconcave vertebræ of Carboniferous age&nbsp;from Nova Scotia are believed to be those of a marine&nbsp;Saurian </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Eosaums acadianus) ; </span><span class="font1">if this view is correct,&nbsp;this oldest of Reptiles would bear the stamp of one of the&nbsp;most Fish-like of the class.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Formations of Permian age in North America as well as in Europe contain fossils with undoubtedly Reptilian&nbsp;characters ; they are still associated with true Labyrintho-donts, and with remains which are too fragmentary to&nbsp;be assigned with certainty either to Labyrinthodonts or&nbsp;Reptiles. The vertebræ of all are amphicœlous. These&nbsp;Reptiles are Rhynchocephalians,—the oldest and best&nbsp;preserved being </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Proterosaumιs</span><span class="font1"> from the Copper-Slate of&nbsp;Thuringia, a Reptile about six feet in length, with a comparatively long neck (which, however, was composed of&nbsp;seven or nine vertebræ only), with numerous abdominal&nbsp;splints, a long tail, and well developed and differentiated&nbsp;limbs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the Mesozoic times the Reptilian type appears in such variety and in such a high state of development that&nbsp;this era has been distinguished as the “Reptilian age.”&nbsp;Yet we know chiefly such forms only as possessed bones of&nbsp;a size and solidity sufficient to ensure their preservation.&nbsp;Of small Reptiles, animals under or scarcely exceeding&nbsp;two feet in length, comparatively few have been discovered,&nbsp;although they too must have existed in abundance. In&nbsp;the Trias there appear first of the marine Saurians large&nbsp;Sauropterygians with narrow ossifications between the&nbsp;vacuities of the skull, such as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Simosaurus, Hothοsaurus,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pistosaurus</span><span class="font1"> from the German Muschelkalk. The&nbsp;highly interesting genus </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Heusticosaurus,</span><span class="font1"> the smallest of&nbsp;the group, with the four limbs modified into paddles, but&nbsp;with the hind limbs retaining the structure of those of a&nbsp;terrestrial animal, seems to afford evidence of this order&nbsp;having been developed from a terrestrial type. Fragments&nbsp;of true </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Plesiosaurus</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ichthyosaurus</span><span class="font1"> begin to appear in&nbsp;the Rhætic bone beds of England. Also the Placodonts,&nbsp;the systematic affinities of which are not yet satisfactorily&nbsp;understood, are contemporaries of these early Enalio-saurians. The precursors of our Crocodiles were two&nbsp;genera, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Belοdon</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Steganolepis,</span><span class="font1"> with dorsal scutes, but&nbsp;with amphicœlian vertebræ and anterior choanæ, neither&nbsp;palatines nor pterygoids being dilated into the osseous&nbsp;palate which is characteristic of later Crocodiles. Another&nbsp;order, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Anomοdontia,</span><span class="font1"> flourished and died in this epoch ;&nbsp;some fifteen genera have been distinguished, all from the&nbsp;South-African Trias ; however, this type is probably also&nbsp;represented in Russian formations of the same age.&nbsp;Rhynchocephalians continue in several genera in European and American strata. But the largest of terrestrial</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Reptiles belonged to the Dinosaurs, whose presence in numerous species belonging to distinct groups, some with&nbsp;three, others with five toes to the hind feet, is testified by&nbsp;their osseous remains as well as by the tracks of their hind&nbsp;feet, which they left during their bipedal progression over&nbsp;stiff mud. These Triassic Dinosaurs were chiefly herbivorous, and already much more numerous in North America&nbsp;than in Europe </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">^Zanclodon).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This Reptilian fauna continued to flourish in the Jurassic period ; the types of the Trias increased in variety ; still&nbsp;more gigantic forms were developed ; and new orders which&nbsp;were absent in the preceding period were added. Of the&nbsp;marine Saurians alone some fifty species are known from&nbsp;European formations : the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ichthyosauri</span><span class="font1"> inhabited chiefly&nbsp;the northern seas of the eastern hemisphere, and were replaced in the western by Reptiles of similar structure and&nbsp;size, but without teeth </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{Sauranodon)</span><span class="font1"> ; the Sauropterygians&nbsp;have considerably advanced beyond their Triassic precursors&nbsp;in having more solidly ossified skulls, and are also represented by a greater number of genera in America as well&nbsp;as Europe ; of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Plesiosaurus</span><span class="font1"> alone some twelve species are&nbsp;known from the Lias and seven from the Oolite. Ptérodactyles make their first appearance. Crocodilians have&nbsp;developed into the “ Mesosuchian ” type, their palatine&nbsp;bones being prolonged, pushing the choanæ backwards to&nbsp;the middle of the under surface of their skull, but their&nbsp;vertebræ are still amphicœlian ; they appear in numerous&nbsp;genera </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">CPeleosaumιs)</span><span class="font1"> and species. Terrestrial Reptiles keep&nbsp;pace in development with the marine and freshwater types ;&nbsp;the giants of the order of Dinosaurs have left their remains&nbsp;in a more or less perfect condition in the Jurassic strata&nbsp;of both hemispheres </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Cetiοsaurus, Atlantosaurus, Iguanodon, Morosaurus, Apatosaurus)</span><span class="font1"> ; forms with three toes on&nbsp;the hind feet lived simultaneously with four- or five-toed&nbsp;ones ; carnivorous types </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Megalosawnts, Creosaurus,</span><span class="font1"> Ac.)&nbsp;represent in habit as well as relative size Mammalian </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Carnivora;</span><span class="font1"> they preyed upon the gigantic but weaker members&nbsp;of the order. The Dinosaurian type extended also into the&nbsp;southern hemisphere, as is testified by the West-Australian&nbsp;genus </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Deuterosaurus.</span><span class="font1"> The Chelonians, which appear first&nbsp;in the Upper Keuper, are in the Lias of highly advanced&nbsp;types, and not essentially different from recent families ;&nbsp;they occur in many localities of Europe as Freshwater&nbsp;Turtles, chiefly </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chelydidæ</span><span class="font1"> ; but </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Emydidæ</span><span class="font1"> are also represented, showing, however, a less solid ossification of the&nbsp;carapace than the recent forms. No distinct evidence of&nbsp;the presence of Marine Turtles and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Trwηyx</span><span class="font1"> has been&nbsp;found hitherto in Jurassic formations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This abundance of Reptilian life not only continues in the Cretaceous period, but is still more increased in&nbsp;variety and reaches its highest point of culmination. Ich-thyopterygians and Sauropterygians reached an enormous&nbsp;size ; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Discosaurus,</span><span class="font1"> with a neck 22 feet long and composed&nbsp;of sixty vertebræ, must have been the most formidable&nbsp;enemy to the Fishes of the sea. Moreover these large&nbsp;Saurians which survived from the preceding period were&nbsp;now joined by a new type of marine monsters with a&nbsp;Snake-like body and very short extremities, the Mosa-saurians, which attained to a length of from 10 to 80 feet&nbsp;and veritably filled the place of Sea-Serpents. Although&nbsp;their skull exhibits not a few Ophidian characters, their&nbsp;genetic relation to that order is not by any means proved.&nbsp;They were most numerous in the western hemisphere,&nbsp;some forty American species referable to many genera&nbsp;having been described by North-American authors ; in&nbsp;Europe they are comparatively scarce. On the other hand&nbsp;no less than fifteen species of Ptérodactyles are known&nbsp;from European formations, all armed with formidable&nbsp;teeth, whilst the gigantic Ptérodactyles of North America&nbsp;are, with one exception, toothless.
