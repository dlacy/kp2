                <p><label>ROBERT OF JUMIÉGES</label> (d. <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> 1070), archbishop
                    of Canterbury, was a Norman who became prior of St Ouen at Rouen and then abbot
                    of Jumieges. A close friend of the future king of England, Edward the Confessor,
                    he crossed over to England with Edward in 1042, and in 1044 became bishop of
                    London. In English history Robert appears as the most trusted and the most
                    prominent of the king’s foreign friends, and as the leader of the party hostile
                    to the influence of Earl Godwine. In 1051, although the chapter had already made
                    an election, Edward appointed him archbishop of Canterbury. He seems to have
                    been sent by the king on an errand to Duke William of Normandy, and on the
                    return of Godwine from exile in 1052 he fled in great haste from England. He was
                    outlawed and deposed, and he died at Jumiéges about 1070. The treatment of
                    Robert by the English was put forward by William the Conqueror as a pretext for
                    invading England.</p>
