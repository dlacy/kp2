the orb of the sun perſonified and adored by a ſect oſ Hindoos as a god. He ſeems to be the same divinity with the Phœbus of Greece and Rome ; and the ſect: who pay him particular adoration are called <hi rend="italic">Sauras.</hi> Their poets and painters deſcribe his car as drawn by ſeven green horses, preceded by Arun, or the <hi rend="italic">Dawn,</hi> who acts as his charioteer, and followed by thouſands of genii worſhipping him and modulating his praiſes. He has a multitude of names, and among them twelve epithets or titles, which denote his diſtinct powers in each of the twelve months ; and he is believed to have deſcended frequently from his car in a human ſhape, and to have left a race on earth, who are equally renowned in the Indian ſtories with the Heliadai of Greece : it is very ſingular, that his two ſons called <hi rend="italic">Afwinau</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Aſwinicurnarau,</hi> in the dual, ſhould be conſidered as twin brothers, and painted like Caſtor and Pollux; but they have each the character of Æsculapius among the gods, and are believed to have been born oſ a nymph, who, in the form of a mare, was impregnated with ſunbeams.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
