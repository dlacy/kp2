The term is much ufed in a monaſtic fenfe for the reducing an order or congregation of religious to the ancient ſeverity of the rule from which it had gradually ſwerved, or even ſor improving on the ancient rule and inſtitution itſelf, and voluntarily making it more ſevere. In this ſenſe the order of St Bernard is ſaid to be only a reform of that of St Benedict. In this country it is applied both to politics and religion, and may innocently bc applied to any endeavours to change an eſtabhſhment from worſe to better. But ſt appears at preſent to have been chiefly made a pretence for deſigns which could not fairly or ſafely be avowed.</p><p>A reform in religion and in parliament (fee Parliament) has, we know, been moſt loudly called for by men whofe religions notions are immenſely different from what has been generally reckoned Chriſtianity, and whoſe deſigns, as has been legally proved, went to the overthrow of all civil order. For infidious purpoſes like theſe, the word reform is a good cloak, eſpecially if anything can be fixed upon, either in the religion or government of the ſtate, which, with the help of exag-geration and diſtortion, can be repreſented to the weak and unthinking as extremely defective and erroneous.</p><p>The general error of theſe men ſeems to be, that ha-ving picked up a ſet of ſpeculative notions which flatter their own pride and the pridς of thoſe who liſten to them, they will allow nothing to the arguments of their opponents or the experience of mankind. They think ſo often and fo much upon their ideal reforms, that while they imagine their notions are liberal and extenſive, they become contracted beyond imagination; while their judgments, of courſe, are warped with the moſt inveterate prejudices (ſee Prejudice.) They ſee, or think they ſee, the propriety of their ſchemes ; but they ſeldom, perhaps never, reflect, that that may be true in ſpeculation or in theory which cannot poffibly be redu-ced to practice. They will not take the world as it is, and allow it to profit by the wiſdom and experience of ages ; but they will reform it according to thoſe ideas of right which they have learned from their own fpecula-tions and airy theories ; ſeldom conſidering what may be done, they are determined to do what they think ought to be done. Liberty of confcience, and liberty of action, have been claimed by them as the unalienable rights of man ; and fo we ourfelves are difpoſed to think, them : nor have we heard that in this country they have been denied to any man, or ſet of men, ſo far as has been thought conſiſtent with the ſafety of the ſtate, and that of the other individuals who compofe it. At the ſame time, the very ſame men heſitate not to blame, with acrimony the moſt violent, and to the utmoſt of their power to reſtrain, the actions and opinions of thoſe who with equal conviction, often on better grounds, and generally with more modeſty, differ from them.</p><p>Amidſt that exceffive ardour, too, with which they propagate their opinions, they forget the extreme dan-ger of withdrawing the attention of that part of the community, who muſt earn their bread by the ſweat oſ their brow, from their proper occupations, to the tempeſtuous fea of political debate, for which their education and mode of Iife cannot poſſibly have qualified them. It requires but very little penetration, however, to be able to fee, that it can be of no real ſervice either to the individuals themſelves, or to the community at large, in whatever light we look upon it. Intleed, to make thoſe the judges of the law, and the reformers of the legiſlature, who have all their lives been employed in manual labour, is the extreme of folly ; and yet it is what ſome men of conſiderable abilities, and from whom we had reaſon to expect better things, have more than once attempted. '1 he effect of ſuch a mode of ſeduction (and it deſerves no better name), when it ſhall become general, inſtead oſ ſerving the purpoſes of a real reform, muſt be to annihilate all civil ordcr.
