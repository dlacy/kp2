Theodosius once more prepared to avenge the murder of an emperor. He raised a powerful army, forced the passes of the Alps, encountered the army of the usurper, and inflicted on him a decisive overthrow. Eugenius was killed by his own defeated troops, and Arbogastes, fearing the just resentment of tlle victor, died by his own hand.</p><p>The whole Roman empire might have been once more reunited under one imperial sovereign, had Theodosius been ambitious of that sole dominion. But being perfectly persuaded of the necessity of an emperor in each of the imperial cities, he assigned to his younger son Honorius the sceptre of the western empire, and associated Arcadius, the elder, with himself in that ofthe east. Scarcely had he completed this arrangement, when his constitution, which had always been feeble, overtasked with the exertions of this campaign and the cares of state, yielded to the shock, and he expired, to the universal regret of the empire, which beheld the splendour of the Roman name passing away with him its last great emperor.</p><p>The Roman world now presented the miserable spectacle of two emperors of such imbecility as to be incapable of conducting the administration of public affairs, in a time of such peril and alarm as would have required the prudence of an Augustus joined to the martial skill and talents of a Cæsar. That Theodosius was not unaware of the feebleness of his two sons, may be conjectured from the fact of his assigning the care of at least the western empire to Stilicho, the master-general of the army. This able general seems to have been a Vandal by origin, but had by his courage and his great abilities raised himself to the highest military fame and station before the death of Theodosius ; and to him that prudent emperor entrusted the guardianship of the empire. In the east, the crafty and avaricious Rufinus enjoyed similar influence over the feeble Arcadius, but without equal merit to sanction his possession of that power. Stilicho governed by the inherent right of commanding genius ; Rufinus by the dark intrigues of a guileful and selfish nature. Stilicho seemed to regard himself as entitled to the supreme care of both empires ; and Rufinus endeavoured to secure his authority in the east by persuading Arcadius to marry his daughter. He was however frustrated by the eunuch Eutropius, a person still more crafty than himself, who induced the young emperor to share his throne with the beautiful and accomplished Eudoxia. In a short time afterwards, Rufinus was killed by the leader of a body of Gothic troops in the confidence of Stilicho, who did not however obtain the ascendancy over Arcadius, being supplanted by the intrigues of Eutropius.</p><p>In the mean while, a dangerous war broke out in Africa, under the command of Gildo, brother of Firmus, who had been the leader of the last revolt. To suppress this insurrection, Stilicho sent Mascezel, the brother and deadly foe of Gildo. The Romans obtained the victory almost without bloodshed ; and Gildo terminated his days by his own act, in a dungeon into which he had been cast. Mascezel did not long enjoy his victory, having been drowned either by accident, or, as some allege, by the contrivance of Stilicho.</p><p>But the fiercest storm that had ever assailed the empire was now ready to burst upon it in its hour of weakness. The Goths had yielded to the arms, and especially to the policy of Theodosius. After the death of Fritigern and of Athan-ric, they had been for some time without a leader able to to combine them into one body. A leader of equal craft and courage now appeared in the famous Alaric, who having succeeded in establishing his authority over his countrymen, only waited for a fair pretext, and a favourable opportunity to put in practice a scheme of greater magnitude and</p><p>daring than had entered into the mind of any of Rome's assailants since the time of Hannibal. The corrupt and avaricious ministers of Arcadius soon afforded him a pretext sufficiently plausible, by withholding the subsidy paid to the Goths since the agreement with Theodosius. Not deeming the lands of Thrace worth his while, Alaric led his forces into Greece, passed the straits of Thermopylas without opposition, devastated its fairest lands, and plundered Athens, Corinth, Argos, and Sparta. The unwarlike emperor of the east and his effeminate courtiers did not dare to meet the warlike barbarian ; and Stilicho marched against them to rescue Greece from her rude plundererg. The great military genius of Stilicho was soon apparent in the advantage he obtained over the Goths, whom he at length succeeded in driving into a straitened position in Elis, whence it seemed impossible for them to escape. Taking advantage of the relaxation which' security had produced in his antagonists, Alaric forced the lines of circumvallation, crossed the narrow strait at the mouth of the gulph of Lepanto, and resumed his ravages in Epirus. Before Stilicho could again reach his enemy, he received information that the emperor of the east had concluded a peace with Alaric, and had even made him master-general of Illyricum.</p><p>Stilicho yielded to the unwise policy of Arcadius, and returned to Italy ; but was very speedily recalled to march against his baffled but unvanquished foe. Resolved if possible to make himself master of the western empire, Alaric crossed the Julian Alps, and marched rapidly towards Milan, where Honorius held his court. Stilicho hastened to recruit his army and to defend the empire ; but before his preparations were complete, the swift march of Alaric compelled Honorius to fly from Milan. In his flight he was almost surrounded by the Goths, and took refuge in Asta, where he was immediately besieged. Stilicho hastened to the rescue of the emperor ; and gained a great, but not decisive victory over Alaric at Pollentia. Rallying the remains of his shattered army, Alaric quitted the scene of his defeat, and marched furiously to Rome, determined to wreak his vengeance on that proud city, or to perish at its gates. But Stilicho at the head of a chosen body of his army hastened with scarcely less swiftness to the relief of the threatened capital, and arrived in time to protect it from the rage of Alaric. He did not however deem it safe to force hi» antagonist to a battle, dreading perhaps the almost invincible energies of a brave enemy’s resolute despair ; and thought it preferable to purchase his retreat, though at the expense of a very large sum of money.</p><p>Though frustrated in this attempt, Alaric did not relinquish his intention of making himself master of the western empire. He retreated towards Gaul, and attempted to seize Verona, intending to retain it as an open door by which to invade Italy when he should be supported by the strength of Gaul. Stilicho being apprised of his intention, followed, beset, and brought him to an engagement at Verona, and inflicted on him a second great overthrow, but could not prevent his escape, with a spirit undismayed, and a resolution only confirmed of implacable hostility to Rome. After this deliverance, Honorius went to Rome to enjoy the honours of a triumph ; but tllis timid prince was not satisfied with a residence in any city which was exposed to the dangers of invasion. He therefore withdrew to Ravenna, a small fortified town on the banks of one of the mouths of the Po, deemed inpregnable from its situation ; and here he determined to fix his imperial residence.</p><p>Another enemy now appeared to summon forth afresh the energies of the brave and indefatigable Stilicho. This was another combined host of roving nations, chiefly Vandals, Alani, Suevi, and Burgundians, under the command of Radagaisus. On their march a large body of this moving mass separated, and entered Gaul ; while the rest under their chief entered Italy and laid siege to Florence.</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
