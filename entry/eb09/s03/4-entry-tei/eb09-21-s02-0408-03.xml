Adolf Schlegel, was a pastor. He was educated at the Hanover gymnasium and at the university of Göttingen. Having spent some years as a tutor in the house of a banker at Amsterdam, he went to Jena, where he was made a professor, and received from the duke of Weimar the title of “ Rath.” Here he began his translation of Shakespeare, which was ultimately completed, under the superintendence of Tieck, by Tieck’s daughter Dorothea and Count Baudissin. A revised edition of this rendering, which is considered one of the best poetical translations in the German language, has been issued by the German Shakespeare society. At Jena Schlegel contributed to Schiller’s periodicals the <hi rend="italic">Horen</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Musenalmanach</hi>; and with his brother Friedrich he conducted the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum,</hi> which ranked among the most powerful organs of critical opinion in Germany. He also published a volume of poems, and carried on a rather bitter controversy with Kotzebue. At this time the two brothers were remarkable for the vigour and freshness of their ideas, and commanded respect as the leaders of the rising Romantic school. In 1802 Schlegel went to Berlin, where he delivered lectures on art and literature ; and in the following year he issued <hi rend="italic">Ion,</hi> a tragedy in the antique style, which gave rise to a suggestive discussion on the principles of dramatic poetry. About the same time appeared his <hi rend="italic">Spanish Theatre,</hi> in which he presented admirable translations of five of Calderon’s plays ; and in another volume he gave translations of Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian lyrics. In 1807 he attracted much attention in France by an essay in the French language, in which he compared Racine with Euripides. His lectures on dramatic art and literature, which have been translated into most European languages, were delivered at Vienna in 1808. Meanwhile he had been travelling in France, Germany, Italy, and other countries with Madame de Staël, who owed to him many of the ideas which she embodied in her work, <hi rend="italic">De l'Allemagne.</hi> In 1813 he acted as the secretary of the crown prince of Sweden, through whose influence the right of his family to noble rank was revived. Schlegel was made a professor at the university of Bonn in 1818, and during the remainder of his life he occupied himself chiefly with Oriental studies, although he continued to lecture on art and literature, and in 1828 he issued two volumes of critical writings. In 1823-30 he published the <hi rend="italic">Indische Bibliothek ;</hi> and as separate works appeared (1823) the <hi rend="italic">Bhagavad-Gîta</hi> with a Latin translation, and (1829) the <hi rend="italic">Râmâjana.</hi> Schlegel was twice married—first to a daughter of Prof. Michaelis of Göttingen, then to a daughter of Prof. Paulus of Heidelberg. Both wives separated from him soon after their marriage. He died at Bonn on the 12th May 1845. As an original poet Schlegel is unimportant, but as a poetical translator he has rarely been excelled, and in criticism he exercised a strong influence by the emphasis with which he marked the distinction between classical and romantic literature. By his study of Sanskrit he helped to prepare the way for the development of the science of language.</p><p>In 1846-47 Schlegel’s German works were issued in twelve volumes by Booking. There is also an edition of his <hi rend="italic">Œuvres, écrites en français,</hi> and of his <hi rend="italic">Opuscula Latina.</hi></p></div></body></text></TEI>
