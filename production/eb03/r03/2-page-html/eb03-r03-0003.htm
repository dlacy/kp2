<p><span class="font0">tire given, as alſo the poſition of any </span><span class="font1">two </span><span class="font0">of the lines, the poſition of all the reſt is determined.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If the horizontal diſtances between the angles are all equal, the forces on the different angles are proportional to the verticals drawn on the lines through&nbsp;theſe angles from the adjoining angle, and the thruſts&nbsp;from the adjoining angles are as the lines which connect&nbsp;them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If the rafters themſelves arc of equal lengths, the weights at the different angles are as theſe verticals and as the ſecants of the elevation of the rafters&nbsp;jointly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This propoſition is very fruitful in its practical conſequences. It is eaſy to perceive that it contains the whole theory of the conſtruction of arches ; for each&nbsp;ſtont of an arch may be conſidered as one of the rafters&nbsp;of this piece of carpentry, ſince all is kept up by its&nbsp;mere equilibrium. We may have an opportunity in&nbsp;ſome future article of exhibiting ſome very elegant and&nbsp;ſimple ſolutions of the moſt difficult cafes of this important problem ; and we now proceed to make uſe&nbsp;of the knowledge we have acquired for the conſtruc</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">tion of roofs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We mentioned by the bye a problem which is not unfrequent in practice, to determine the beſt form of&nbsp;a kirb-roof. Mr Couplet of the Royal Academy of&nbsp;Paris has given a ſolution of it in an elaborate memoir&nbsp;in 1726, occupying ſeveral lemmas and theorems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Let AE (fig. ιι.) be the width, and CF the height; it is required to conſtruct a roof ABCDE whoſe rafters AB, BC, CD, DÉ, are all equal, and which ſhall&nbsp;be in equilibrio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">D raw CE, and biſect it perpendicularly in H by the line DHG, cutting the horizontal line AE in G. A-bout the centre G, with the diſtance GE, deſcribe the&nbsp;circle EDC. It muſt paſs through C, becauſe CH is&nbsp;equal to HE and the angles at H are equal. Draw&nbsp;HK parallel to FE, cutting the circumference in K.&nbsp;Draw CK, cutting GH in D. Join CD, ED ; theſe&nbsp;lines are the rafters of half of the roof required.·</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">' We prove this by ſhowing, that the loads in the angles C and D are equal. For this is the proportion&nbsp;which reſults from the equality of the rafters, and the&nbsp;extent of ſurſece of the uniform roofing which they are&nbsp;ſuppoſed to ſupport. Therefore produce ED till it&nbsp;•meet the vertical FC in N ; and having made the fide&nbsp;CBA ſimilar to CDE, complete the parallelogram&nbsp;BCDP, and draw DB, which will biſect CP in R,&nbsp;as the horizontal line K H, biſects CF in Draw&nbsp;KF, which is evidently parallel to DP. Make CS perpendicular to CF, and equal to FG; and about S, with&nbsp;the radius SF, deſcribe the circle FKW. It muſtpaſs&nbsp;through K, becauſe SF is equal to C G, and C Qj=&nbsp;OF. Draw W K, W S, and produce B C, cutting&nbsp;ND in O.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The angle WKF at the circumference is one-half of the angle </span><span class="font1">W </span><span class="font0">S F at the centre, and is therefore equal to&nbsp;WSC, or CGF. It is therefore double of the angle&nbsp;CEF or ECS. But ECS is equal to ECD and DCS,&nbsp;and ECD is one-half of NDC, and DCS is one-half&nbsp;of DCO, or C D P. Therefore the angle W K F is&nbsp;equal to NDP, and WK is parallel to ND, and CF is&nbsp;to CW as CP to CN ; and CN is equal to CP. But&nbsp;it has been ſhown above, that C N and C P are as the&nbsp;loads upon D and C. Theſe are therefore equal, </span><span class="font1">and&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">the frame ABCDE is in equilibrio,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A companion of this ſolution with that of Mr Couplet will ſliow its great advantage in reſpect of ſimplicity and perſpicuity. And the intelligent reader can eaſily&nbsp;adapt the conſtruction to any proportion between the&nbsp;rafters A B and B C, which other circumſtances, ſuch&nbsp;as garret-room, &amp;c. may<sup>r</sup> render convenient. The conſtruction muſt be ſucli that NC may be to CP as CD to&nbsp;CD+DE.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"> Whatever proportion </span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font0">AB to BC is</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">aſſumed, the point D'will be found in the circumference of a ſemicircle H' D' Z∣', whoſe centre is in the line C E,&nbsp;and having A B : B C = C H' : H E , = </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">cP ; h'</span><span class="font0"> E. —&nbsp;The reſt of the conſtruction is ſimple,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In buildings which are rooſed with ſlate, tyle, or ſhingles, the circumſtance which is moſt likely to limit&nbsp;the conſtruction is the ſlope of the upper rafters C B,&nbsp;CD. This muſt be ſuſſicient to prevent the penetration&nbsp;of rain, and the ſtripping by the winds. The only&nbsp;circumſtance left in our choice in this caſe is the pro*&nbsp;portion of the rafters AB and BC. Nothing is eaſier&nbsp;than making NC to CP in any delired proportion when&nbsp;the angle BCD is given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We need not repeat that it is always a deſirable thing to form a truſs for a roof in ſuch a manner that it ſhall<sup>&nbsp;</sup>be in equilibrio. When this is done, the whole force of&nbsp;the ſtruts and braces which are added to it is employed&nbsp;in preſerving this form, and no part is expended in un∙&nbsp;neceſſary ſtrains. For we muſt now obſerve, that the&nbsp;equilibrium of which we have been treating is always&nbsp;of that kind which we called the tottering, and the roof&nbsp;requires ſtays, braces, or hanging timbers, to give it&nbsp;ſtiffneſs, or keep it in ſhape. We have alſo ſaid enough&nbsp;to enable any reader, acquainted with the moſt elementary geometry and mechanics, to compute the tranſverſe&nbsp;ſtrains and the thruſts to which the component parts of&nbsp;all roofs are expoſed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It only remains now to ſhow the general maxims by which all roofs muſt be conſtructed, and the circumſtances which determine their excellence. In doing this&nbsp;we ſhall be exceedingly brief, and almoſt content our-ſelves with exhibiting the principal forms, of which the&nbsp;endleſs variety of roofs are only flight modifications.—&nbsp;We ſhall not trouble the reader with any account of&nbsp;ſuch roofs as receive part of their ſupport from the interior walls, but confine ourſelves to the more difficult&nbsp;problem of throwing a roof over a wide building, without any intermediate ſupport ; becauſe when ſuch roofs&nbsp;are conſtructed in the beſt manner, that is, deriving the&nbsp;greateſt poſſible ſtrength from the materials employed,&nbsp;the beſt conſtruction of the others is neceſſarily included. For all ſuch roofs as reſt on the middle walls are&nbsp;roofs of ſmaller bearing. The only exception deſerving&nbsp;notice is the roofs of churches, which have aiſles ſeparated from the nave by columns. The roof muſt rife&nbsp;on theſe. But if it is of an arched form internally,&nbsp;the horizontal thruſts muſt be nicely balanced, that they&nbsp;may not puſh the columns aſide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The ſimpleſt notion of a roof-frame is, that it conſiſts of two rafters A B and B C (fig. 12.), meeting in the ridge B.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Even this ſimple form is ſuſceptible of better and</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
