a woollen quilted fluff, manufactured on a loom with four treddles, after the manner of rateens, and other fluffs that have the whale. The goodneſs of serges is known by the quilting, as that of cloths by the ſpinning. Of ſerges there are various kinds, denominated either from the different qualities thereof, or from the places where they are wrought. The most considerable is the London ſerge, now highly valued abroad, particularly in France, where a manufacture is carried on with considerable ſucceſs, under the title of <hi rend="italic">ſerge facon de Londres.</hi></p><p>The method of making the London ſerge we ſhall now deſcribe: For wool, the longest is choſen for the warp, and the ſhortest for the woof. Before either kind is uſed, it is firſt ſcoured, by putting it in a copper of liquor, ſomewhat more than lukewarm, compoſed of three parts of fair water and one of urine. . After having flayed long enough therein for the liquor to diſſolve, and take off the greaſe, &amp; c. it is stirred briskly about with a wooden peel ; taken out of the liquor, drained, and waſhed in a running water, dried in the ſhade, beaten with sticks on a wooden rack to drive out the coarſer duſt and filth, and then picked clean with the hands. Thus far prepared, it is greaſed with oil of olives, and the longeſt part, deſtined for the warp, is combed with large combs, heated in a little furnace for the purpoſe. To clear off the oil again, the wool is put in a liquor compoſed of hot water, with ſoap melted therein: whence being taken out, wrung, and dried, it is ſpun on the wheel.</p><p>As to the ſhorter wool, intended for the woof, it is only carded on the knee with small cards, and then ſpun on the wheel, without being ſcoured of its oil. It must be remarked, that the thread for the warp is always to be ſpun much finer, and better twilled than that of the woof. The wool both for the warp and the woof being ſpun, and the thread divided into ſkains, that of the woof is put on ſpools (unleſs it have been<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0298.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0292"/>
ſpun upon them) fit for the cavity or eye of the ſhuttle; and that for the warp is wound on a kind of wooden bobbins to fit it for warping. When warped, it is ſtiffened with a kind of ſize, whereof that made of the ſhreds of parchment is held the best; and when dry is put on the loom.</p><p>When mounted on the loom, the workman raising and lowering the threads (which are passed through a reed), by means of four treddles placed underneath the loom, which he makes to act tranſverſely, equally, and alternately, one after another, with his feet, in proportion as the threads are raiſed and lowered, throws the ſhuttle acroſs from one side to the other ; and each time that the ſhuttle is thrown, and the thread of the woof is croſſed between thoſe of the warp, ſtrikes it with the frame to which the reed is faſtened, through thoſe teeth the threads of the warp paſs ; and this ſtroke he repeats twice or thrice, or even more, till he judges the croſſing of the ſerge ſufficiently cloſe : thus he proceeds till the warp is all filled with woof.</p><p>The ſerge now taken off the loom is carried to the fuller, who ſcours it in the trough of his mill with a kind of fat earth, called <hi rend="italic">fuller’s earth,</hi> firſt purged of all ſtones and filth. After three or four hours ſcouring, the fuller’s earth is waſhed out in fair water, brought by little and little into the trough, out of which it is taken when all the earth is cleared ; then, with a kind of iron pincers or plyers, they pull off all the knots, ends, ſtraws, &amp; c. flicking out on the ſurface on either side ; and then returning it into the fulling trough, where it is worked with water ſomewhat more than lukewarm, with ſoap diſſolved therein for near two hours : it is then waſhed out till ſuch time as the water becomes quite clear, and there be no ſigns of ſoap left ; then it is taken out of the trough, the knots, &amp; c. again pulled off, and then put on the tenter to dry, taking care as fast as it dries to ſtretch it out both in length and breadth till it be brought to its juſt dimenſions. When well dried, it is taken off the tenter, and dyed, ſhorn, and preſſed.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
