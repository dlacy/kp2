(Albert), profeſſor of Hebrew and of the eaſtern languages at Leyden, and one of the moſt learned men of the 18th century, was born at Groningen, where he ſtudied till the year 1706, and from thence continued his ſtudies at Leyden and Utrecht. Schultens at length applied himſelf to the ſtudy of Arabic books, both printed and in manuſcript; in which he made great progreſs. A ſhort time after he became miniſter of Waſſenar, and two years after profeſſor of the eaſtern tongues at Franeker. At length he was invited to Leyden, where he taught Hebrew and the eaſtern languages with extraordinary reputation till his death, which happened in 1750. He wrote many learned works; the principal of which are, 1. A Commentary on Job, 2 vols 4to. 2. A Commentary on the Proverbs. 3. <hi rend="italic">Vetus</hi> &amp; <hi rend="italic">regia via Hebraizandi.</hi> 4. <hi rend="italic">Animadversiones philologicae &amp; criticae ad varia lora Veteris Testamenti.</hi> 6. An excellent Hebrew grammar, &amp;c. Schultens diſcovered in all his works found criticiſm and much learning. He maintained againſt Gouſſet and Drieſſen, that in order to have a perfect knowledge of Hebrew, it is neceſſary to join with it, not only the Chaldee and Syriac, but more particularly the Arabic.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
