<p><span class="font0">to tîme-honoured forms after their </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">raison d'être</span><span class="font0"> was gone, the scale-bearer and the scales were still retained as indispensable elements of the mancipation, yet the scales were simply touched by the&nbsp;purchaser with a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">raudusculum</span><span class="font0"> or a single coin, in order that he&nbsp;might be able to recite the old formula: “ 1 sav that this slave is&nbsp;mine in quiritary right, and that by purchase (for such and such a&nbsp;price) with these scales and this bit of copper.” And that one&nbsp;coin, says Gaius, was then handed by the transferee to the transferrer as if it were in fact the price of the purchase </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(quasi pretti&nbsp;loco).</span><span class="font0"> Thus transformed, the mancipation was undoubtedly an&nbsp;imaginary sale; for the real price might have been paid weeks&nbsp;or months before, or might not be paid until w<sup>ee</sup>ks <sup>or</sup> months&nbsp;afterwards. The mancipation had become nothing more than a&nbsp;conveyance, and in this form it continued down to the end of the&nbsp;3rd century of the Empire to be the appropriate mode of transfer&nbsp;of a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">res mancipi,</span><span class="font0"> or at least of conferring on the transferee of such&nbsp;a thing a complete legal title </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(dominium ex jure quiritium).</span><span class="font0"> After&nbsp;that, however, it seems gradually to have gone into disuse, being&nbsp;inapplicable to lands out of Italy that did not enjoy what was&nbsp;called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">jus Italicum*,</span><span class="font0"> and long before the time of Justinian it had&nbsp;practically disappeared.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The effects of a mancipation, provided the price had been paid or security given for it, were that the property passed instantly to&nbsp;the purchaser, and that the transferrer was held to warrant the&nbsp;transferee against eviction from the moment the price was received.&nbsp;In the absence of either payment or sureties for it, the title still&nbsp;remained with the vendor, so that it was in his power, by means&nbsp;of a real action, to get back what had been mancipated, even&nbsp;though it had passed into the possession of the vendee. The&nbsp;vendor’s liability to the vendee in the event of eviction is usually&nbsp;supposed to have arisen </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ipso jure—</span><span class="font0">that is to say, without anything&nbsp;expressly said about it; the acceptance by the transferrer of the&nbsp;coin with which the scales had been struck was held to have imposed upon him an obligation to maintain the transferee in possession, under a penalty of double the amount of the price, recoverable&nbsp;bÿ the latter by what is usually called an </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">actio auctoritatis.</span><span class="font0"> But&nbsp;this </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ipso jure</span><span class="font0"> obligation did not arise when the mancipation was&nbsp;either really or fictitiously gratuitous </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(nummo uno),—</span><span class="font0">really, in the&nbsp;case of donations, &amp;c., fictitiously, when, on purpose to exclude the&nbsp;warranty, the recital of the transferee was that the price was a single&nbsp;sesterce.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The right of a vendee to sue an </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">actio auctoritatis</span><span class="font0"> arose only when eviction resulted from a decree in a regular judicial process at the&nbsp;instance of a third party disputing his title, and was conditional&nbsp;on his having done all that was necessary on his part to bring his&nbsp;vendor </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(atictor)</span><span class="font0"> into the field to defend his own interests. And&nbsp;the duration of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">auctoritas</span><span class="font0"> was limited by the Tables to two years&nbsp;in the case of lands and houses, to one year in the case of other&nbsp;things.. As possession for those periods was sufficient to cure any&nbsp;defect in the vendee’s title, it was but reasonable that with their&nbsp;expiry the vendor’s liability on his warranty should be at an end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">By a provision of the Tables in the very inclusive terms, “cum nexum faciet mancipiumque, uti lingua nuncupassit, ita jus esto,”&nbsp;the importance of mancipation was immensely increased; for any&nbsp;sort of qualification germane to the transaction might be superinduced upon it, and the range of its application thus greatly&nbsp;extended. Such qualifications were spoken of as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">leges mancipii,—&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">self-imposed terms, conditions or qualifications of the conveyance&nbsp;and, as integral parts of the transaction </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">per aes et libram,</span><span class="font0"> they&nbsp;partook of its binding character and were law between the parties.&nbsp;The matter of oral declaration might be the acreage of lands, their&nbsp;freedom from burdens or right to easements, reservation of a usufruct, undertaking to reconvey on a certain event, or what not,&nbsp;so long as it did not express a term or condition; the result was&nbsp;just so many obligations created </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">per aes et libram,</span><span class="font0"> whose contravention or denial (Cicero tells us) was punished with a twofold&nbsp;penalty.<sup>@@1</sup> Ordinarily the words spoken in the hearing of the&nbsp;witnesses fixed the beginning and the end of the liability; it was&nbsp;enough that they .were literally complied with, however much&nbsp;the other party might be injured by something inconsistent with&nbsp;their spirit, or which he had not taken the precaution to require&nbsp;should be made matter of declaration. But there was an exception&nbsp;(although not introduced until long after the Tables) in the case&nbsp;of that particular mancipatory agreement which was known by&nbsp;the name of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">fiducia,, i.e.</span><span class="font0"> where the mancipation was to a creditor&nbsp;in security or to a friend for safe custody, and the engagement&nbsp;was to return the thing mancipated, in the one case when the debt&nbsp;secured by it was paid and in the other on demand. In such cases&nbsp;the transferee took the conveyance more in the transferrer’s interest&nbsp;than his own; he became a sort of trustee, entitled to be treated&nbsp;with consideration, and neither mulcted in a twofold penalty when&nbsp;his inability to reconvey was due to no fault of his, nor forced to&nbsp;reconvey until relieved of charges incurred by him in reference to</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">the property. Accordingly it became the practice to import into the mancipation a reference to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">fides—</span><span class="font0">“ fidi fiduciae causa meum&nbsp;esse aio,” with explanation of the purpose, conditions, &amp;c., of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">fiducia,</span><span class="font0"> and this explanation as a rule not in the nuncupatory&nbsp;words, forming a relative </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">lex mancipii,</span><span class="font0"> but in a separate agreement&nbsp;or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">pactum fiduciae.</span><span class="font0"> This pact then became enforceable not by&nbsp;ordinary </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">legis actio,</span><span class="font0"> as part of the mancipation, but separately&nbsp;on grounds of good faith alone. It gave rise to an </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">actio fiduciae&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">which some writers think was just an application of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">legis actio&nbsp;per judicis postulationem,</span><span class="font0"> but which more probably was originally&nbsp;an action </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rn factum</span><span class="font0"> granted by the urban praetor by virtue of&nbsp;his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">imperium.</span><span class="font0"> In any case it was one of the earliest instances of&nbsp;an action </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">inter cives</span><span class="font0"> based on principles of good faith. The fiduciary&nbsp;clause had the effect of freeing alike the right of the vendor and the&nbsp;obligation of the vendee from the hard-and-fast lines of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">jus&nbsp;strictum,</span><span class="font0"> and subordinating them to the principles of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">bona fides.<sup>@@2</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Of the civil modes of acquiring property on singular title’applicable to both </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">res mancipi</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">res nec mancipi</span><span class="font0"> surrender in court </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(injure cessio)</span><span class="font0"> was just a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rei vindicatio</span><span class="font0"> arrested in its initial&nbsp;stage. The parties, cedent and cessionary, having previously arranged the terms of transfer—sale, donation or&nbsp;otherwise—appeared before the magistrate; the cessionary, taking the position of plaintiff, declared the thing his in&nbsp;quiritary right; tne cedent, as defendant, was asked what he had&nbsp;to say in answer; and, on his admission or silence, the magistrate&nbsp;at once pronounced a decree </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(addictio)</span><span class="font0"> which completed the transfer,&nbsp;but which might be subject to a fiduciary reservation or deduction&nbsp;of a servitude. It was probably more resorted to for the constitution of servitudes, both real and personal, and transfer of&nbsp;such rights as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">patria potestas,</span><span class="font0"> €utory-at-law of a woman, or an&nbsp;agnatic inheritance that had already opened, than for conveyance&nbsp;of property. For it was not only inconvenient, inasmuch as it&nbsp;required the parties to appear before the supreme magistrate in&nbsp;Rome, and could not be carried through by any one under power&nbsp;(as mancipation might), but it had also the serious disadvantage that&nbsp;it did not </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ipso jure</span><span class="font0"> imply any warranty of title by the cedent in the&nbsp;event of eviction or give rise to an action </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">de modo agri.</span><span class="font0"> Nor did it,&nbsp;like mancipation and tradition, make payment of the price a condition&nbsp;precedent of the transfer of property. The reason was that in&nbsp;form the right of the cessionary flowed from the magisterial decree:&nbsp;‘‘ Since you say the thing is yours, and the cedent does not say it&nbsp;is his, I declare it yours,” and not from any act or word of the&nbsp;cedent’s, who was passive in the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Usucapion,<sup>@@3</sup> reulated by the XII. Tables, but not improbably recognized previously in a vague and uncertain way, converted&nbsp;uninterrupted possession </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(usus)</span><span class="font0"> into quiritary property&nbsp;by efflux of time. The provision in the Tables, as&nbsp;given by Cicero, was to this effect: “ usus auetdritas&nbsp;fundi biennium est, ceterarum rerum omnium annuus est.”&nbsp;The relation in which the words </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">usus</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">auctoritas</span><span class="font0"> stand to&nbsp;each other has been a subject of much discussion: the prevailing opinion amongst modern civilians is that the two&nbsp;words should be taken disjunctively, the first alone referring&nbsp;to usucapion, and the second to the warranty of title incumbent&nbsp;on the vendor in a mancipation, and that both were limited&nbsp;to two years in the case of lands (and, by extensive interpretation, houses), and to one year in the case of anything else.&nbsp;In the later jurisprudence the possession required to be based&nbsp;on a sufficient title and the possessor to be in good faith. But&nbsp;the decemviral code, as is now generally admitted, contained&nbsp;no such requirements; any citizen occupying immovables or&nbsp;holding movables as his own, provided they were usucaptible&nbsp;and he had not taken them theftuously, acquired a quiritary&nbsp;right in two years or one, as the case might be, simply on the&nbsp;strength of his possession. Originally, therefore, it was simply&nbsp;the conversion of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">de facto</span><span class="font0"> possession, no matter how acquired&nbsp;so long as not by theft, into legal ownership when prolonged&nbsp;for the statutory period,—too often the maintenance of might&nbsp;at the cost of right. But in time it came to be regarded rather&nbsp;as a remedy for some defect of title, arising either from&nbsp;irregularity of conveyance or incapacity of the party from&nbsp;whom a transfer had been taken; and with the progress of</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
