<p><span class="font1">conceive, at least two other examples of “ gestes written in quainte Inglis” composed, namely, according to fixed and&nbsp;complicated rules of verse, and with much attention to the&nbsp;language, though the effect produced is far from pleasing.&nbsp;They are both of Scottish origin, which may be explained,&nbsp;by recollecting, that in the Saxon provinces of Scotland, as&nbsp;well as at the court, Norman was never generally used ; and&nbsp;therefore it is probable that the English language was more&nbsp;cultivated in that country at an early period, than in England&nbsp;itself, where, among the higher orders, it was for a long time&nbsp;superseded by that of the French conquerors. These romances, entitled </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sir Gawain,</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sir Gologras,</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sir Ga-lerαη of Galloway,</span><span class="font1"> have all the appearance of being original&nbsp;compositions, and display considerable poetical effort. But&nbsp;the uncouth use of words dragged inforthe sakeof alliteration,&nbsp;and used in secondary and oblique meanings, renders them&nbsp;extremely harsh in construction, as well asobscure in meaning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In England it would seem that the difficulties pointed out by De Brunne, early threw out of fashion this ornate kind&nbsp;of composition ; and the English minstrels had no readier resource than translating from the French, who supplied their&nbsp;language at the same time with tlle phrases of chivalry&nbsp;which did not exist in English. These compositions presented many facilities to tile minstrel. He could, if possessed of the slightest invention, add to them at pleasure,&nbsp;and they might as easily be abridged when memory failed,&nbsp;or occasion required. Accordingly, translations from the&nbsp;French fill up the list of English romance. They are generally written in short lines rhyming together; though&nbsp;often, by way of variety, the third and sixth lines are made&nbsp;to rhyme together, and the poem is thus divided into stanzas&nbsp;of three couplets each. In almost all of these legends, reference is made to “ the romance,” that is, some composition in the French language, as to the original authority.&nbsp;Nay, which is very singular, tales where the subjects appear&nbsp;to be of English growth, seem to have yet existed in French&nbsp;ere they were translated into the language of the country&nbsp;to which the heroes belonged. This seems to have been&nbsp;the case with </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hornchild,</span><span class="font1"> with </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Guy of Warwick,</span><span class="font1"> with </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Revis of Hampton,</span><span class="font1"> all of which appear to belong originally to&nbsp;England ; yet are their earliest histories found in the French&nbsp;language, or at least the vernacular versions refer to such&nbsp;for their authority. Even the romance of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Richard,</span><span class="font1"> England’s own Cœur de Lion, has perpetual references to the&nbsp;French original from which it was translated. It must naturally be supposed that these translations were inferior to&nbsp;the originals ; and whether it was owing to this cause, or&nbsp;that the composition of these rhymes was attended with too&nbsp;much facility, and so fell into the hands of very inferior&nbsp;composers, it is certain, and is proved by the highest authority, that of Chaucer himself, that even in his time these&nbsp;rhyming romances had fallen into great contempt. TheΛtwιe&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">of Sir Thopas,</span><span class="font1"> which that poet introduces as a parody, undoubtedly, ofthe rhythmical romances of theage, is interrupted by mine host Harry Bailly, with the strongest and most&nbsp;energetic expressions of total and absolute contempt. But&nbsp;though the minstrels were censured by De Brunne, for lack&nbsp;of skill and memory, and the poems which they recited were&nbsp;branded as “ drafty rhymings,” by the far more formidable&nbsp;censure of Chaucer, their acceptation with the public in general must have been favourable, since, besides many unpublished volumes, the two publications of Ritson and Weber bear&nbsp;evidence of their popularity. Some original compositions&nbsp;doubtless occur among so many translations, but they are&nbsp;not numeroes, and few have been preserved. The poem of&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sir Eger</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sir Grerne,</span><span class="font1"> which seems of Scottish origin,&nbsp;has no French original ; nor has any been discovered either&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Squire of Low Degree, Sir Eglarnour, Sir Plein-damour,</span><span class="font1"> or some others. But the French derivation of the&nbsp;two last names renders it probable that such may exist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The minstrels and their compositions seem </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font1">have fallen</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1">into utter contempt about the time of Henry VIII. There is a piteous picture of their condition in the person of Richard Sheale, which it is impossible to read without compassion, if we consider that he was the preserver at least, if not&nbsp;the author of the celebrated heroic ballad of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chevy Chace,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">at which Sir Philip Sidney’s heart was wont to beat as at&nbsp;the sound of a trumpet. This luckless minstrel had been&nbsp;robbed on Dunsmore Heath, and, shame to tell, he was&nbsp;unable to persuade the public that a son of the Muses had&nbsp;ever been possessed of the sixty pounds which he averred he had lost on the occasion. The account he gives of&nbsp;the effect upon his spirits is melancholy, and yet ridiculous&nbsp;enough.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">After my robbery my memory was so decayde,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">That I colde neather syng, nor talke, my wytts wer so dismayde, My audacitie was gone, and all my myrry tawk :</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">As sylk thredd, and eggyngs, skirrts, bandds, and strings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">From </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Chant</span><span class="font1"> of Richard Sheale, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">British Bibliographer,</span><span class="font1"> No. xiii. p. 101.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Elsewhere, Sheale hints that he had trusted to his harp, and to the well known poverty attached to those who used&nbsp;that instrument, to bear him safe through Dunsmore Heath.&nbsp;At length the order of English minstrels was formally put&nbsp;down </span><span class="font2">by </span><span class="font1">the act 39th of Queen Elizabeth, classing them&nbsp;with sturdy beggars and vagabonds ; in which disgraceful&nbsp;fellowship they only existed in the capacity of fiddlers, who&nbsp;accompanied their instrument with their voice. Such a&nbsp;character is introduced in the play of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Monsieur Thomas,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">as the “ poor fiddler who says his songs.” The metrical&nbsp;romances which they recited also fell into disrepute, though&nbsp;some of the more popular, sadly abridged and adulterated,&nbsp;continued to be published in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chap, books,</span><span class="font1"> as they are called.&nbsp;About fifty or sixty years since, a person acquired the nickname of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rosewal and Lilian,</span><span class="font1"> from singing that romance&nbsp;about the streets of Edinburgh, which is probably tiιe very&nbsp;last instance of the proper minstrel craft.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If the metrical romances of England can boast of few original compositions, they can show yet fewer examples of&nbsp;the prose romance. Sir Thomas Malory, indeed, compiled,&nbsp;from various French authorities, his celebrated </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Morte dArthur,</span><span class="font1"> indisputably the best prose romance the language can&nbsp;boast. There is also </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Arthur of Little Britain;</span><span class="font1"> and the&nbsp;Lord Berners compiled the romance of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Knight of the&nbsp;Swan.</span><span class="font1"> The books of Amadis were likewise translated into English ; but it may be doubted whether the country in&nbsp;general ever took that deep interest in the perusal of these&nbsp;records of love and honour with which they were greeted&nbsp;in France. Their number was fewer ; and the attention&nbsp;paid to them in a country where great political questions&nbsp;began to be agitated, w<sup>τ</sup>as much less than when the feudal&nbsp;system still continued in its full vigour.</span></p>
