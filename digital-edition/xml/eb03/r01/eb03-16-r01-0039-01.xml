                <p><label>REFORMATION</label> in general, an act of reforming or correcting an error
                    or abuſe in religion, diſci-</p>
                <p>pline, or the like. By way of eminence the word is uſed for that great
                    alteration and reformation in the corrupted ſyſtem of Chriſtianity, begun by
                    Luther in the year 1517.</p>
                <p>Under the article History (fect. ii.), the various corruptions in religion, the
                    oppreſſions and uſurpations of the clergy, and the extreme inſolence of the
                    popes, have been ſo fully treated of, that any further detail here is
                    unneceffary. It is ſuſſicient to obſerve, that, before the period of the
                    Reformation, the Pope had in the moft audacious manner declared himſelf the
                    ſovereign of the whole world. All the parts of it which were inhabited by thoſe
                    who were not Chriſtians, he accounted to be inhabited by <hi rend="italic">no-body</hi> ; and if Chriſtians took it into their heads to po∏efs any of
                    thoſe countries, he gave them fuff liberty to make war upon the inhabitants
                    without any provocation, and to treat them with no more humanity than they would
                    have treated wild beaſts. The countries, if conquered, were to be parcelled out
                    according to the pope’s pleaſure ; and dread-ful was the ſituation of that
                    prince who refuſed to obey the will of the holy pontiff, of which many
                    inftances' will occur to the reader in the various hiſtorical articles of this
                    work. In conſequence of this extraordinary authority which the pope had affumed,
                    he at laſt: granted to the king of Portugal all the countries to the eaſt-ward
                    of Cape Non in Africa, and to the king of Spain all the countries to the
                    weſtward of it. In this, according to the opinions of ſome, was completed in his
                    perſon the character of <hi rend="italic">Antichrist sitting in the temple of
                        God, and ſhewing himself as God </hi><note anchored="true" place="margin"
                        type="authorial" n="1">2 Thess. ii. 4.</note>. He had long before, ſay they,
                    affumed the fupremacy belonging to the Deity himſelf in ſpiritιιal matters ; and
                    now he affumed the ſame ſupremacy in worldly matters alſo, giving the extreme
                    regions of the earth to whom he pleaſed. The Reformation, therefore, they
                    confider as the immediate effect of divine power taking vengeance on this and
                    all other deviations from the ſyſtem of truth while others conſider it merely as
                    an effect of natural cauſes, and which might have been foreſeen and prevented,
                    without abridging the papal power in any confiderable degree.</p>
                <p>Be this as it will, however, the above-mentioned partition was the laſt piece of
                    inſolence which the pope ever had, or in all probability ever will have, in his
                    power to exerciſe, in the way of parcelling out the globe to his adherents.
                    Every thing was quiet, every heretic exterminated, and the whole Chriſtian world
                    fupinely acquieſced in the enormous abſurdities which were inculcated upon them
                    ; when, in 1517, the empire,of iuper-ſtition began to decline, and has continued
                    to do ſo ever ſince. The perfon who made the firſt attack on the extravagant
                    ſuperſtitions then prevailing was Martin Luther ; the occafion of which is fully
                    related under tlie article Luther. By ſome it is pretended, that the Only motive
                    which Luther had m beginning the Reformation was his enmity to the Dominican
                    friars, who had excluded his order (the Auguſtins) from all ſhare in the gainful
                    traffic of indulgences. But this does not ſeem at all probable, if we conſider
                    that fuch a motive would not naturally have led him to deny the virtue cf
                    indulgences, as ſuch conduct could not but exclude him forever from any chance
                    of a ſhare in the traffic, which otherwiſe perhaps he might have obtained.
                    Beſides, the extreme contrariety of this traffic to the common principles of
                    reaſon and honeſty was ſo great, that we</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r01-0040" facs="gri_33125011196389_0046.tif"/>
                <p>cannot wonder at finding <hi rend="italic">one</hi> man in the world who had
                    ſenſe enough to diſcern it, and virtue enough to oppoſe ſuch an infamous
                    practice. In all probability, however, the inſignificancy of the fiiſt reformer
                    was the reaſon why he was not perſecnted and exterminated at his firſt
                    beginning, as others had been before him. Another reaſon probably might be, that
                    he did not at once at-tack the whole errors of Popery, but brought about his
                    reformation gradually, probably as it occurred to him-ſelf, and as we have
                    related in the account of his life.</p>
                <p>The Reformation, began in the city of wittemberg in Saxony, but was not long
                    confined either to that city or province. In 1520 the Franciſcan friars, who had
                    the care of promulgating indulgences in Switzer-land, were oppofed by
                    'Zuinglius, a man not inferior in underſtanding and knowledge to Luther himfelf.
                    He proceeded with the greateſt vigour, even at the very be-ginnſhg, to overturn
                    the whole fabric of Popery ; but his opinions were declared erroneous by the
                    univerſities of Cologne and Louvain. Notwithſtanding this, the magiſtrates of
                    Zurich approved of his proceedings ; and that whole canton, together with thoſe
                    of Bern, Baſil, and-Chaſſauſen, embraced his opinions.</p>
                <p>In Germany, Luther continued to make great ad-vances, without being in the leaſt
                    intimidated by the eccleſiaſtical cenſures which were thundered againſt him from
                    all quarters, he being continually protected by the German princes either from
                    religious or political mo-tives, ſo that his adverſaries could not accompliſh
                    his deſtruction as they had done that of others. The princes, who were upon bad
                    terms with the court of Rome, took advantage of the ſucceſs of the new
                    doctrines; and in their own dominions eaſily overturned a church which had loſt
                    all the reſpect and veneration of the inferior ranks. The court of Rome had
                    diſobliged ſome of the ſmaller princes in the north of Germany, whom the Pope
                    probably thought too inſigniſicant to be worth the managing, and they
                    univerſally eſtabliſhed the Reformation in their own dominions. Melancthon,
                    Car-loſtadius, and other men of eminence, alſo greatly forwarded the work of
                    Luther ; and in all probability the Popiſh hierarchy would have ſoon come to an
                    end, in the northern parts of Europe at leaſt, had not the emperor Charles V.
                    given a fevere check to the progrefs of reformation in Germany. In order to
                    follow out the ſchemes dictated by his ambition, he thought it neceſſary to
                    ingratiate himſelf with the pope ; and the moſt effectual method of doing this
                    was by deſtroying Luther. The Pope’s legates inſiſted that Luther ought to be
                    condemned by the diet of worms without either trial or hearing ; as being a moſt
                    notorious, avowed, and incorrigible heretic. However, this appeared unjuſt to
                    the members of the diet, and he was ſummoned to appear ; which he accordingly
                    did without heſitation<note anchored="true" place="margin" type="authorial"
                        n="2">See <hi rend="italic">Luther</hi>. </note>. There is not the leaſt
                    doubt that his appearance there had been his laſt in this world, had aot the
                    aſtoniſhing reſpect that was paid him, and the crowds who came daily to ſee him,
                    deterred his judges from delivering the church from the author of ſuch a
                    peſtſlent hereſy ; which they were*ſtrongly ſolicited by the pope’s party to do.
                    He was therefore permitted to depart with a ſafe conduct ſor a certain time ;
                    after which he was in the ſtate of a profcribed criminal, to whom it was
                    unlawful to perform any of the offices of humanity.</p>
                <p>During the confinement of Luther in a caſtle near warburg, the Reformation
                    advanced rapidly 5 almoſt every city in Saxony embracing the Lutheran opinions.
                    At this time an alteration in the eſtabliſhed forms of worſhip was firſt
                    ventured uponatwktemberg,by aboliſh-ing the celebration of private maffes, and
                    by giving the cup as well as the bread to the laity in the Lord’s flipper. In a
                    ſhort time, however, the new opinions were condemned by the univeiſtty of Paris,
                    and a refutation of them was attempted by Henry VIII. of England. But Luther was
                    not to be thus intimidated. He pub-hihed his animadverfions on both with as much
                    acrimony as if he had been refuting the meaneſt adverſary ; and a controverfy
                    managed by ſuch illuſtrious antagoniſts drew a general attention, and the
                    Reformers daily gained new converts both in France alld England.</p>
                <p>But while the efforts of Luthcr were thus everywhere crowned with ſuccefs, the
                    diviſions began to prevail which have ſince fo much agitated the reformed
                    church-es. The firſt diſpute was between Luther and Zuinglius concerning the
                    manner in which the body and blood of Chriſt were preſent in the euchariſt.
                    Luther and his followers, though they had rejected the notion of
                    tranfubſtantiation, were nevertheleſs of opinion that the body and blood of
                    Chriſt were really preſent in the Lord’s ſupper, in a way which they could not
                    pretend to explain. Carloſtadt, who was Luther’s colleague, firſt ſuggeſted
                    another view of the ſubject, which was afterwards confirmed and illuſtrated by
                    Zuinglius, namely, that the body and blood of Chriſt were not really prefent in
                    the euchariſt ; and that the bread and wine were no more than external fymbols
                    to excite the remembrance of Chriſt’s fufferings in the minds of thoſe who
                    received it. Both parties maintained their tenets with the utmoſt obſtinacy ;
                    and, by their diviſions, firſt gave their adverſaries an argument againſt them,
                    which to this day the Catholics urge with great force ; namely, that the
                    Proteſtants are fo divided, that it is impoffible to know who is right or wrong
                    ; and that there cannot be a ſtronger proof than theſe diviſions, that the whole
                    doc-trine is falfe.</p>
                <p>To theſe inteſtſhe diviſions were added the horrors of a civil war, occaſioned
                    by oppreffion on the one hand, and enthuſiaſm on the other. In 1525, a great
                    number of ſeditious fanatics aroſe on a ſudden in different parts of Germany,
                    took arms, united their forces, and made war againſt the empire, laying waſte
                    the country with ſire and ſword, and committing everywhere the greateſt
                    cruelties. The greateſt part of this furious mob was compofed of peaſants and
                    vaſſals, who groaned under heavy burdens, and declared that they were no longer
                    able to bear the deſpotic government of their chiefs ; and hence this ſedition
                    had the name of <hi rend="italic">the ruſlic war,</hi> or the <hi
                        rend="italic"> war oſ the peaſants.</hi> At ſirſt this rabble declared,
                    that they had no other motives than the redreſs of their grievances ; but no
                    ſooner had the enthuſiaſſ Munzer, or Munſſer, the anabaptiſt, put himſelf at
                    their head, than the face of things was entirely changed, and the civil
                    commotions in Saxony and Thuringia exceedingly increaſed, of which an account is
                    given under the article Anabaptists.</p>
                <p>In the mean time Frederic, ſurnamed the <hi rend="italic">Wiſe,</hi> elector
                    of Saxony, and Luther’s great patron, departed this life, and was ſueceeded by
                    his brother John. Frederic, though he had protected and encouraged Luther, yet w <hi rend="sup">,</hi> as at no pains to introduce the reformed religion
                    into</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r01-0041" facs="gri_33125011196389_0047.tif"/>
                <p>his dominiono. But with his ſucceſſor it was otherwiſe ; for he, convinced that
                    Luther’s doctrine muſt ſoon be totally deſtroyed and ſuppreſſed unleſs it
                    received a ſpeedy and effectual ſupport, ordered Luther and Melancthon to draw
                    up a body of laws relating to the form of eccleſiaſtical government, the method
                    of public worſhip, &amp;c. which was to be proclaimed by heralds throughout
                    his dominions. This example was followed by all the -princes and ſtates of
                    Germany who renounced tlie papal ſupremacy ; and a like form of worſhip,
                    diſcipline, and government, was thus introduced into all the churches ’which
                    di(Γented from that of Rome. This open renun-ciation of the Romiſh juriſdiction
                    ſoon changed the face of affairs ; and the patrons of Popery ſoon intimated, in
                    a manner not at all ambiguous, that they intended to make war on th¢ Lutheran
                    party ; which would certainly have been put in execution, had not the trou-bles
                    that took place in Europe diſconcerted their mea-fures. Οη the other hand, the
                    Lutherans, apprized of theſe hoſtile intentions, began alſo to deliberate on a
                    proper plan of defence againſt that fuperſtitious violence with which they were
                    in danger of being aſſailed. The diet of the empire aſſembled at Spire, in the
                    year 1526; where the emperor’s ambaſſadors were deſired to uſe their utmoſt
                    endeavours to ſuppreſs all diſputes about religion, and to inſiſt upon the
                    rigorous execution of the ientence which had been pronounced againſt Luther and
                    his followers at worms. The greateſt part of the German princes oppoſed this
                    motion with the ut-moſt refolution, declaring that they could not cxecute that
                    ſentence, nor come to any determination with regard to the doctrines by which it
                    had been occaſioned, Before the whole matter was ſubmitted to the decifion of a
                    council lawfully aſſembled ; alleging farther, that tke deciſion of
                    controverſies of this nature belonged properly to it, and to it alone. This
                    opinion, after long and very warm debates, was adopted by a great majority, and
                    at length confented to by the whole aſſembly: for it was unanimouſly agreed to
                    preſent a ſolemn ad-tlrefs to the emperor, intreating him to aſſemble, without
                    delay, a free and general council ; while in the mean time it was alſo agreed,
                    that the princes of the empire ſhould, in their reſpective dominions, be at
                    liberty to manage eccleſiaſtical affairs in the manner they ſhould think moſt
                    proper ; yet ſo as to be able to give to God and the emperor a proper account of
                    their adminiſtra-tion when it ſhould be required of them.</p>
                <p>Theſe reſolutions proved extremely favourable to the cauſe of reformation ;
                    neither had the emperor any lei-ſure for fome time to give diſturbance to the
                    reformed. The war, which at this time enſued between him and the pope, gave the
                    greateſt advantage to the friends of the reformed, and conſiderably augmented
                    their number. Several princes, whom the fear of perſecution and puniſhment had
                    hitherto prevented from lending their affiſtance, publicly renounced the Romiſh
                    ſuperſtſtion, and introduced among their ſubjects the ſame forms of religious
                    worſhip, and the ſame lyſtem of doctrine, that had been received in Saxony,
                    others, though placed in ſuch circumſtances as diſcouraged them from acting in
                    an open manner againſt the intereſts of the Roman pontiff, were, however, far
                    from diſcovering the ſmalleſt oppoſition to thoſe who withdrew the people from
                    his deſpotic yoke ; nor did they moleſt the private aſſem-blies of thoſe who had
                    ſeparated themſelves from the</p>
                <p>church of Rome. And in general, all the Germans who, before theſe 1efolutions of
                    the diet of Spire, had rejected the papal difcipline and doctrine, were now, in
                    conſequencc of the libcrty they enjoyed, wholly employed in bringing their
                    fchemes and plans to a certain de-gree of confidence, and in adding vigour and
                    firmneſs to the cauſe in which they were engaged. But this tranquillity and
                    liberty was of no long duration. In 1529, a new diet was aſſembled at the ſame
                    place by the emperor, after he had quieted the troubles in various parts of his
                    dominions, and concluded a peace with the pope. The power which had been granted
                    to princes of managing eccleſiaſtical affairs till the meeting of a general
                    council, was now revoked by a majority of votes ; and every change declared
                    unlawful that ſhould be introduced into the doctrine, diſcipline, or worſhip of
                    the eſtabliſhed religion, before the determination of the approaching council
                    was known. This decree was conſidered as iniquitous and intolerable by the
                    elector of Saxony, the landgrave of Heſſe, and other members oſ the diet, who
                    were perſuaded of the neceffity of a reformation. The promiſe of ſpeedily
                    aſſembling a <hi rend="italic">general</hi> council, they looked upon to be an
                    artifice of the church of Rome ; well knowing, that a free and lawful council
                    would be the Iaſt thing to which the pope would conſent. when, therefore, they
                    found that all their arguments and remonſtrances made no impreffion upon
                    Ferdinand the emperor’s brother, who preſided in the diet, Charles himſelf being
                    then at Barcelona, they entered a ſolcmn proteſt againſt this decree on the 19th
                    of April, and appealed to the emperor and a future council. Hence aroſe the
                    denomination of <hi rend="italic">Protfiαnts,</hi> which from this period has
                    been given to thoſe who ſeparate from the communion of the church of Rome. The
                    princes of the empire who entered this proteſt were, John elector of Saxony;
                    George elector of Bran-denburg ; Erneſt and Francis dukes of Lunenburgh ; the
                    landgrave of Heſſe ; and the prince of Anhalt. Theſe were ſeconded by 13
                    imperial towns, viz. Straf-burg, U'lm, Nuremberg, Conſtance, Rottingen,
                    wind-ſeim, Memmiπgen, Nortlingen, Lindaw, Kempton, Htilbron, wiſſemburg, and St
                    Gall.</p>
                <p>The diſſenting princes, who were the protectors and heads of the reformed
                    churches, had no ſooner entered their proteſt, than they fent proper perfons to
                    the em-peror, who was then upon h13 paſſage from Spain to Italy, to acquaint him
                    with their proceedings irf this matter. The miniſters employed in this
                    commiſſion executed it with the greateſt intrepidity and prefence of mind ; but
                    the emperor, exaſperated at the audacity of thoſe who prefumed to differ from
                    him, cauſed the ambaſſadors to be arreſted. The news of this violent ſtep made
                    the Proteſtant princes conclude, that their perſon-al ſafety, and the ſuccefs of
                    their cauſe, depended entirely upon their own courage and union. They
                    de-termined, therefore, to enter into a ſolemn confederacy: ſor which purpoſe
                    they held ſeveral meetings at Rot, Nuremberg, Smalcald, and other places : but
                    ſo different were their opinions and views, that they could determine upon
                    nothing.</p>
                <p>o∏e great obſtacle to the intended confederacy was the diſpute which had anſen
                    between Luther and Zuinglius concerning the real preſence of Chriſt in the
                    Lord’s Supper. To terminate this difpute, if poſſible, Philip, landgrave of
                    Heffe, invited, in the year 1529, tβ</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r01-0042" facs="gri_33125011196389_0048.tif"/>
                <p>a conference at Marpurg, Luther and Zuinglius, toge-ther with ſeveral other of
                    the more eminent doctors who adhered to the reſpective parties of theſe
                    contending chiefs : but this meaſure was not attended with the ſa-lutary effects
                    which were expected from it. The divines diſputed for four days in preſence of
                    the landgrave. Lu-ther attacked oecolampadius, and Zuinglius was attack-ed by
                    Melancthon. Zuinglius was accuſed of hereſy, not only on account of his
                    explanation of the nature aud deſign of the Lord’s Supper, but alfo in
                    confequence of the falfe notions he was fuppoſed to have adopted concerning the
                    divinity of Chriſt, the efficacy of the divine -word, original fin, and ſome
                    other parts of the Chriſtian doctrine. This illuſtrious reformer, however,
                    cleared himfelf from the greateſt part of thefe charges whh the moſt triumphant
                    evidence, and in fuch a manner as appeared fatisfactory even to Luther himfelf :
                    but their diſſenſion concerning the manner of Chriſt’s preſence in the euchariſt
                    ſtill remained ; nor could either of the contending parties be perſuaded to
                    abandon, or even to modify, their opinions on that matter. The only advantage,
                    therefore, which reſulted from the meeting was, that the jarring doctors formed
                    a kind of truce, by agreeing to a mutual toleration of their fentiments, and
                    leaving to the diſpoſal of Providence the cure of their diviſions.</p>
                <p>In the mean time news were received that the emperor deſigned to come into
                    Germany, with a view to terminate all religious differences at the approaching
                    diet of Augſhurg. Having foreſeen fome of the conſequences of thoſe diſputes,
                    and, beſides, taken the advice of men of wiſdom, ſagacity, and experience, he
                    became at certain times more cool in his proceedings, and more impartial in his
                    opinions both of the contending parties and the merits of the cauſe. He,
                    therefore, in an interview with the pope at Bologna, inſiſted, in the moſt
                    ſerious and urgent manner, on the neceſſity of a general council. His
                    remonſtrances and expo-ſtulations, however, could not move the pontiff ; who
                    maintained with zeal the papal prerogatives, reproached the emperor with an
                    ill-judged clemency, and alleged that it was the duty of that prince to ſupport
                    the church, and to execute ſpeedy vengeance upon that obitinate heretical
                    faction who dared to call in queſtion the au-thority of Rome and its pontiff. To
                    this diſcourſe the emperor paid no regard ; looking upon it as a moſt iniquitous
                    thing, and a meaſure directly oppoſite to the laws of the empire, to condemn
                    unheard a ſet of men who had always approved themfelves good citizens, and
                    deſerved well of their country in ſeveral reſpects. Hitherto indeed it was not
                    eaſy for the emperor to form a clear idea of the matters in debate, ſince there
                    was no regular ſyſtem as yet compoſed, by which it might be known with certainty
                    what were the true cauſes of Luther's oppoſition to the pope. The elector of
                    Saxony, therefore, ordered Luther, and other eminent divines, to commit to
                    writing the chief articles of their religious ſyſtem, and the principal points
                    in which they differed from the church of Rome. Luther, in compliance with</p>
                <p>this order, delivered to the elector at Torgaw 17 articles which had been agreed
                    upon in a conference at Sultzbach in 1529 ; from whence theſe received the name
                    of <hi rend="italic">the articles oſ Torgaw.</hi> But though theſe were deemed
                    by Luther a ſufficient declaration of the ſenti-jκιents of the reformers, yet it
                    was judged proper to en</p>
                <p>large them, J∏ order to give perſpicuity to their arguments, and ſtrength to
                    their cauſe. In this work Melancthon was employed ; in which he ſhowcd a proper
                    deference to the counſels of Luther, and expreſſed his fentiments and doctrine
                    with the greateſt elegance and perſpicuity ; and thus came forth to view the
                    famous <hi rend="italic">Confeffion oſ Augsburg.</hi></p>
                <p>Οη the 15th of June 1530, Charles arrived at Augſ. burg, and the diet was opened
                    live days after. The Proteſtants received a formal permiſſion to preſent an
                    account of their tenets to the diet on the 25th of the ſame month ; in
                    conſequence of which, at the time ap-pointed, Chriſtian Bayer, chancellor of
                    Saxony, read, in the German language, before the emperor and the princes
                    affembled, the confeſſion of Augſhurg above-mentioned. It contained 28 chapters,
                    of which <hi rend="italic">21</hi> were employed in repreſenting the religious
                    opinions of the Proteſtants, and the other feven in pointing out the errors and
                    fuperſtitions of the church of Rome. The princes heard it with the deepeſt
                    attention and recollection of mind : it confirmed ſome in the principles they
                    had embraced ; ſurpriſed others ; and many, who be-fore this time had little or
                    no idea of the religious ſentiments of Luther, were now not only convinced of
                    their innocence, but delighted with thcir purity and fimplicity. The copies of
                    this Confeſſion, which after being read were delivered to the emperor, were
                    ſigned by John elector of Saxony, George marquis of Bran-denburg, Erneſt duke of
                    Lunenburg, Philip landgrave of Heife, Wolfgang prince of Anhalt, and by the
                    im-perial cities of Nuremberg and Reutlingen.</p>
                <p>The creatures of the church of Rome who were pre* fent at this diet employed
                    John Faber, afterw <hi rend="sup">τ</hi> ards biſhop of vienna, together with
                    Eckius, and another doctor named <hi rend="italic">Cockdœus,</hi> to draw up a
                    refutation of the Protef-tant confeſſion : which refutation having been publicly
                    read, the emperor required the Proteſtant members to acquiefce in it, and put an
                    end to tbe religious diſputes by an unlimited ſubmiſſion to the opinions and
                    doctrines contained in this anſwer. But this demand was far from being complied
                    with. The Proteſtants declared on the contrary, that they were by no means
                    ſatisfied with the reply of their adverſaries ; and earneſtly defired a copy of
                    it, that they might more fully demonſtrate its extreme infufficiency and
                    weakneſs. But this reaſonable requeſt was refuſed by the emperor ; who
                    interpoſed his ſupreme authority to prevent any farther proceedings in this
                    matter, and ſolemnly prohibited the publication of any new writings or
                    declarations that might contribute to lengthen out theſe religious debates.
                    This, however, did not reduce the Proteſtants to ſilence. The divines of that
                    communion, who had been preſent at the diet, endeavoured to recollect the
                    arguments and objections employed by Faber, and had again recourſe to the pen of
                    Melancthon, who refuted them in an ample and ſa-tisfactory manner in a piece
                    which was preſented to the emperor on the 2 2d of September, but which Charles
                    refnſed to receive. This anſwer was afterwards enlarged by Melancthon, when he
                    had obtained a copy of Faber’s reply ; and was publiſhed in the year 1531, with
                    the other pieces that related to the doctrine and difeipline of the Lutheran
                    church, under the title of <hi rend="italic">A Defence of the Cοnfijfiοn oſ
                        Augsburg.</hi></p>
                <p>Matters now began to draw towards a criſis. There were only three ways of
                    bringing to a coacluſion theſe</p>

                <p>r¢Ugieue djtT¢r¢nces, ι» To grant the Proteſtants a toleration and privilege of
                    ſerving God as they thought propers 2. To compel them to return to the church of
                    Rome by the violent methods of perſecution : or, a. That a reconciliation ſhould
                    be made, upon fair, can-did, and equitable terms, by engaging each of the
                    par-ties to temper their zeal with moderation, to abate re-¢iprocaliy the rigour
                    of their pretenſions, and remit fomething of their reſpective claims. The third
                    expedient was moſt generally approved of, being peculiarly agreeable to all who
                    had at heart the welfare of the empire ; nor did the pope ſeem to look upon it
                    either with averfion or contempt. Various conferences therefore were he’d
                    between perſons eminent for piety and learning on both ſides ∙ and nothing was
                    omitted that might have the leaſt tendency to calm the animoſities and heal the
                    diviſions which reigned between the con. tending parties. But the differences
                    were too great to admit of a reconciliation ; and therefore the votaries of Rome
                    had recourſe to the powerful arguments of imperial edicts, and the force of the
                    ſecular arm. Οη the i ρth of November, a ſevere decree was iſſued out by the
                    expreſs order of the emperor (during the abſence <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the
                    Heſſian and Saxon princes, who were the chief ſupporters of the Proteſtant
                    cauſe), in which every thing was manifeſtly adapted to deject the friends of
                    religious liberty, excepting only a faint and dubious promiſe of engaging the
                    pope to aſſemble a general council about fiκ months after the ſeparation oſ the
                    diet. In this de-créé the dignity and excellence of the Popiſh religion were
                    extolled beyond meaſure, a new degree of ſeverity and force was added to that
                    which had been publiſhed at Worms againſt Luther aιjd his adherents, the changes
                    which had been introduced into the doctrine and diſcipline of the Proteſtant
                    churches were ſeverely eenſured, and a ſolemn order was addreſied to the
                    princes,cities, and ſtates, who had thrown off the Papal yoke, to return to
                    their allegiance to Rome, on pain of incurring the indig-nation and vengeance of
                    the emperor as the patron and protector of the church. Of this formidable decree
                    the ejector of βaxonyand confederated princeswere noſooner informed, than they
                    affembled in order to deliberate on the meaſures proper to be taken in ſuch a
                    criſis. In the years 1530 and 1531 they met, fiiſt at Smalcald, and afterwards
                    at Francfort, where they formed a ſo-lemn alliance and confederacy, with the
                    intention of defending vigorouſly their religion and liberties againſt the
                    dangers and encroachments with which they were threa-tened by the edict of
                    Augſhurg, without attempting, however, any thing· offenſive againſt the votaries
                    of Rome ; and into this confederacy they invited th¢ kings of England, France,
                    Denmark, &amp;c. leaving no means unemployed that might corroborate and
                    cement this important alliance,</p>
                <p>This confederacy was at firſt oppoſed by Luther, from an apprehenſion of the
                    calamities and troubles which it might produce j but at laſt, perceiving the
                    neceſſity of it, he conſented ; though he uncharitably, as well as imprudently,
                    refuſed to comprehend in it the followers of Zuinglius among the Swiſs, together
                    with the German ſtates and cities who had adopted the fen-timents and confeſſion
                    of Bucer. In the invitation ad-dreffed to Henry VIII. of England, whom the
                    con-federate princes were willing to declare the head and protector of their
                    league, the following things, among</p>
                <p>others, were «tpr¢ſtly ſtipulated : That the king fliauïd encourage, promote,
                    and maintain, the true doctrine of Chriſt as it was contained in the confeſſion
                    of Augf- ' burg, and deiend the fame at the next general council : that he
                    ſhould not agree to any council lummoned bv the biſhop of Rome, but proteſt
                    againſt it ; and neither ſubmit to its decrees, nor ſuffer them to be reſpected
                    in his dominions: that he ſhould never allow the Roman pontiſt to have any
                    pre-eminence or juriſdiction in his dominions ; that he ſhould advance 100,000
                    crowns for the uſe of the confederacy, and double that ſum if it became
                    neceffary : all which articles the confederate pιinces were equally obliged to
                    obſerve on their part.</p>
                <p>I o theſe demands the king replied, that he would mam-tain and promote the true
                    doctrine of Chriſt ; but, at the fame time, as the true ground of that doctrine
                    lay only in the holy Scriptures, he would not accept at any one’s hand what
                    ſhould he his own faith, or that of his kingdom j and therefore deſired that
                    they would ſend over two learned men to confer with him, in order to promote a
                    religious union between him and the confederates. However, he declared himſelf
                    of their opinion with 1 egard to the meeting of a free general council, and
                    promiſed to join with them in all fuch councils for the defence of the true
                    doctrine ; hut thought the regula-tion of the ceremonial part of religion, being
                    a matter of indifference, ought to be left to the choice of each ſovereign for
                    his own dominions. After this the king gave them a ſecond anſwer more full and
                    fatisfactory ; but afteι the execution oſ queen Anne, this negociatioπ came to
                    nothing. Ο11 the one hand, the king grew cold when he perceived that the

                    became ſenſible that they could never fucceed with. Henry unleſs they allowed
                    him an abſolute dictatorſhip in matters of religion.</p>
                <p>while every thing thus tended to an open war be-tween the two oppoſite parties,
                    the elector Palatine, and the elector of Mentz, offered their mediation, and
                    en-deavouιed to procure a reconciliation. I he emperor himſelf, for various
                    reaſons, was at this time inclined to peace : for, on the one hand, he ſtood in
                    need of ſuccours againſt the Turks, which the Proteſtant princes refuſed to
                    grant as long as the edicts of worms and Augſhurg remained in force ; and, on
                    the other, the election of his brother Ferdinand to the dignity of king of the
                    Romans, which had been carried by a majority of votes at the diet of Cologne in
                    1531, was by the fame pιinces conteſted, as being contrary to the fundamental
                    laws of the empire. In conſequence of all this, after many negociations and
                    projects of reconciliation, a treaty of peace was concluded at Nuremberg in
                    1532, between the emperor and the Proteſtant princes, on the following
                    conditions ; <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> That the latter ſhould furniſh a
                    ſubſidy for carrying on the war againſt the Turks, and acknowledge Ferdinand
                    lawful king of the Romans; and that the emperor on his part ſhould abrogate and
                    annul the edicts of worms and Augſhurg·, and allow the Lutherans the free and
                    undiſturbed exerciſe of their religious doctrine and diſcipline, until a rule of
                    faith was fixed either in the free general council that was to be affembled in
                    the fpace of ſix months, or in a diet of the empire.</p>

                <p>died John elector of Saxony, who was ſucceeded by his ſon John Frederic, a
                    prince of invincible fortitude and magnanimity, but whoſe reign was little
                    better than one continued train of diſappointments and calamities. The religious
                    truce, however, gave new vigour to the reformation. Thofe who had hitherto been
                    only ſe-cret enemies to the Roman pontiff, now publicly threw off his yoke ; and
                    various cities and provinces of Gcr-jnany enliſted themſelves under the
                    religious ſtandards of Luther. Οη the other hand, as the emperor had now no
                    other hope of terminating the religious diſputes Éut by the meeting of a general
                    council, he repeated his requeſts to the pope for that purpoſe. The pontiff
                    (Clement VII.), whom the hiſtory of paſtcoun-cils filled with the greateſt
                    uneaſineſs, endeavoured to retard what he could not with decency refuſe, At
                    laſt, in 1533, he made a propoſal by his legate to affemble a council at Mantua,
                    Placentia, or Bologna ; but the Proteſtants refuſed their conſent to the
                    nomination of an Italian council, and inſiſted that a controverſy which had its
                    riſe in the heart of Germany, ſhould be deter-mined within the limits of the
                    empire. The pope, by his uſual artifices, eluded the performance of his own
                    promife ; and, in 1534, was cut off by death, in the midſt of his ſtratagems.
                    His ſucceffor Paul III. feem-ed to ſhow leſs reluctance to the aſſembling a
                    general council, and in the year 1535 expreſſed his inclination to convoke one
                    at Mantua ; and, the year following, actually ſent circular letters for that
                    purpoſe through all the ſtates and kingdoms under his juriſdiction. Tin’s
                    council was ſummoned by a bull iſſued out on the 2d of June 1536, to meet at
                    Mantua the following year but ſeveral obſtacles prevented its meeting; one of
                    the moſt material of which was, that Frederic duke of Mantua had no inclination
                    to receive at once ſo many gueſts, ſome of them very turbulent, into the place
                    of his reſidence. Οη the other hand, the Proteſtants were firmly perſuaded that,
                    as the council was aſſembled in</p>
                <p>Italy, and by the authority of the pope alone, the lat-ter muſt have had an
                    undue influence in that aſſembly ; of conſequence, that all things muſt have
                    been carried by the votaries of Rome. For this reaſon they aſſem-bled at
                    Smalcald in the year 1537, where they folemn-ly proteſted againſt this partial
                    and corrupt council, and, at the ſame time, had a new ſummary of their doctrine
                    drawn up by Luther, in order to preſent it to the aſſembled biſhops if it ſhould
                    be required of them. This fummary, which had the title of <hi rend="italic">The
                        Articles oſ Smalcald,</hi> is commonly joined with the creeds and
                    confeſſions of the Lutheran church.</p>
                <p>After the meeting of the general council in Man-tua was thus prevented, many
                    ſchemes of accommodation were propoſed both by the emperor and the Proteſtants ;
                    but, by the artifices of the church of Rome, all of them came ≠o nothing. In
                    1541, the emperor appointed a conference at worms on the ſubject of religion,
                    between perſons of piety and learning choſen from the contending parties. This
                    conference, however, was, for certain reaſons, removed to the diet which was to
                    be held at Ratiſhon that fame year, and in which the principal ſubject of
                    deliberation was a me-morial preſented by a perſon unknown, containing a project
                    of peace. But the conference produced no other effect than a mutual agreement of
                    the contending parties to refer their matters to a general council, or, if</p>
                <p>the meeting of ſuch a council ſhould be prevented, to the next German diet.</p>
                <p>This refolution was rendered ineffectual by a variety of incidents, which
                    widened the breach, and put off to a farther day the deliberations which were
                    de-ſigned to heal it. The pope ordered his legate to declare to the diet of
                    Spire, aſſembled in 1542, that he would, according to the promiſe he had already
                    made, aſſemble a general council, and that Trent ſhould be the place of its
                    meeting, if the diet had no objection to that city. Ferdinand, and the princes
                    who adhered to the cauſe of the pope, gave their conſent to this propoſal ; but
                    it was vehemently objected to by the Proteſtants,. both becauſe the council was
                    ſummoned by the authority of the pope only, and al-ſo becauſe the place was
                    within the juriſdiction of the Pope; whereas they deſired a free council, which
                    ſhould not be biaſſed by the dictates, nor awed by the proximity, of the
                    pontiff. But this proteſtation produced no effect. Paul III. perſiſted in his
                    purpoſe, and iſſued. out his circular letters for the convocation of the
                    council, with the approbation of the emperor. In juſtice to this pontiff,
                    however, it muſt be obſerved, that he ſhowed himſelf not to be averſe to every
                    reformation. He appointed four cardinals, and three other perſons eminent for
                    their learning, to draw up a plan for the reformation of the church in general,
                    and of the church of Rome in particular. The reformation propoſed in this plan
                    was indeed extremely fuperficial and partial, yet it contained fome particulars
                    which could ſcarcely have been expected from thoſe who compoſed it. They
                    complained of the pride and ignorance of the biſhops, and propoſed that none
                    ſhould receive orders but learned and pious men ; and that therefore care ſhould
                    be taken to have proper maſters for the inſtruction of youth. They condemned
                    tranſlations from one benefice to another, grants of reſervation, non-reſidence,
                    and pluralities. They propoſed that ſome convents ſhould be aboliſhed ; that the
                    liberty of the preſs ſhould be re-ſtrained and limited ; that the colloquies of
                    Eraſmus ſhould be ſuppreffed ; that no eccleſiaſtic ſhould enjoy a benefice out
                    of his own country ; that no cardinal fnould have a biſhopric ; that the
                    queſtors of St Anthony and ſeveral other ſaints' ſhould be aboliſhed ; and,
                    which was the beſt of all their propoſals, that the effects and perſonal eſtates
                    of eccleſiaſtics ſhonld be given to the poor. They concluded with complaining of
                    the prodigious number of indigent and ragged prieſts who frequented St Peter’s
                    church ; and declared, that it was a great fcandal to fee the whores lodged fo
                    magnificently at Rome, and riding through the ſtreets on . fine mules, while the
                    cardinals and other eccleſiaſtics accompanied them in the moſt courteous
                    manner.— This plan of reformation was turned into ridicule by Luther and
                    Sturmius ; and indeed it left unredreffed the moſt intolerable grievances of
                    which the Proteſtants complained.</p>
                <p>All this time the emperor had been labouring to perfuade the Proteſtants to
                    conſent to the meeting of the council at Trent ; but when he found them fixed in
                    their oppoſition to this meaſure, he began to liſten to the ſanguinary meaſures
                    of the pope, and refolved to terminate the diſputes by force of arms. The
                    elec-tor of Saxony and landgrave of HeiΓe, who were the chief ſupporters of the
                    Proteſtant cauſe, upon this took</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r01-0045" facs="gri_33125011196389_0051.tif"/>
                <p>proper meaſures to prevent their being ſurpriſed and overwhelmed by a ſuperior
                    force ; but, before the hor-rors of war commenced, the great reformer Luther
                    died in peace at Ayſelben, the place of his nativity, in 1546.</p>
                <p>The emperor and the pope had mutually reſolved on the deſtruction of all who
                    ſhonld dare to oppoſe the council of Trent. The meeting of it was to ſerve as a
                    ſignal for taking up arms ; and accordingly its deliberations were fcarcely
                    begun in 1546, when the Proteſtants perceived undoubted ſigns of the approaching
                    ftorm, and a formidable union betwixt the emperor and pope, which threatened to
                    cruſh and overwhelm them at once. This year indeed there had been a new
                    conference at Ratiſbon upon the old fubject of accom-modating differences in
                    religion ; but from the manner in which the debates were carried on, it plainly
                    ap-peared that theſe differences could only be decided in the field of battle.
                    The council of Trent, in the mean time, promulgated their decrees ; while the
                    reformed princes, in the diet of Ratiſhon, proteſted againſt their authority,
                    and were on that account profcribed By the emperor, who raiſed an army to reduce
                    them to obedience. See <hi rend="italic">Father Paul’s Hiftory oſ the Council
                        oſ Trent,</hi> and our articles Paul (Father), and Trent.</p>
                <p>The elector of Saxony and the landgrave of Hefle led their forces into Bavaria
                    againſt the emperor, and cannonaded his camp at Ingoldſtalt. It was ſuppoſed
                    that this would bring on an engagement, which would probably have been
                    advantageous to the cauſe of the reformed ; but this was prevented, chiefly by
                    the per-ſidy of Maurice duke of Saxony, who invaded the dominions of his uncle.
                    Diviſions were alſo fomented among the confederate princes, by the diffimulation
                    of the emperor ; and France failed in paying the ſubſidy which had been promiſed
                    by its monarch : all which ſo diſcouraged the heads of the Proteſtant party,
                    that their army ſoon diſperſed, and the elector of Saxony was obliged to direct
                    his march homewards. But he was purſued by the emperor, who made ſeveral forced
                    marches, with a view to deſtroy his enemy before he ſhould have time to recover
                    his vigour. The two armies met near Muhlberg, on the Elbe, on the 24th of April
                    1547 ; and, after a bloody action, the elector was entirely defeated, and
                    himſelf taken priſoner.— Maurice, who had ſo baſely betrayed him, was now
                    declared elector of Saxony ; and by his intreaties Philip landgrave of Heſſe,
                    the other chief of the Prote-ſtants, was perſuaded to throw himfelf on the mercy
                    of the emperor, and to implore his pardon. To this he conſented, relying on the
                    promiſe of Charles for obtaining forgiveneſs, and being reſtored to liberty ;
                    but, not-withſtanding theſe expectations, he was unjuſtly detained priſoner, by
                    a fcandalous violation of the moſt ſolemn convention. It is faid that the
                    emperor retracted his promiſe, and deluded this unhappy prince by the ambiguity
                    of two German words. Hiſtory in-deed can ſcarce afford a parallel to the
                    perfidious, mean-ſpirited, and deſpotic behaviour of the emperor in the preſent
                    caſe. After having received in pub-lic the humble ſubmiſſion of the prince on
                    his knees, and after having ſet him at liberty by a ſolemn treaty, he had him
                    arreſted anew without any reafon, nay, without any pretence, and kept him cloſe
                    priſoner for ſeveral years, when Maurice remonſtrated againſt this new
                    confinement, the emperor anfwered <hi rend="sub">i</hi> .</p>
                <p>that he had never promiſed that the landgrave fhould not be impriſoned anew, but
                    only that he ſhould be exempted from perpetual imprifonment ; and, to ſupport
                    this aſſertion, he produced the treaty, in which his miniſters had perſidioufly
                    foiſted <hi rend="italic">ewiger gefangnis,</hi> which ſigniſies a " perpetual
                    prifon,” inſtead of <hi rend="italic">einiger gsfuιgnis,</hi> which ſigniſies
                    " any prifon.” This, however, is conteſted by ſome hiſtorians.</p>
                <p>The affairs of the Proteſtants now ſeemed to be de-ſperate. In the diet of
                    Augſhurg, which was ſoon after called, the emperor required the Proteſtants to
                    leave the deciſion of theſe religious diſputes to the wiſdom of the council
                    which was to meet at Trent. The greateſt part of the members conſented to this
                    propoſal, being convinced by the powerful argument of an imperial army, which
                    was at hand to diſpel the darkneſs from the eyes of ſuch as might otherwiſe have
                    been blind to the force of Charles’s reaſoning. However, this general ſubmiffion
                    did not produce the effect which was expected from it. A plague which broke out,
                    or was ſaid to do ſo, in the city, cauſed the greateſt part of the biſhops to
                    retire to Bologna ; by which means the council was in effect diſſolved, nor
                    could all the intreaties and remonſtrances of the emperor prevail upon the pope
                    to re-aſſemble it without delay. During this interval, therefore, the emperor
                    judged it neceſſary to fall upon ſome method of ac-commodating the religious
                    differences, and maintaining peace until the council ſo long expected ſhould be
                    finally obtained, with this view he ordered Julius Pelugius bilhop of Naumberg,
                    Michael Sidonius, a creature of the pope, and John Agricola, a native of
                    Ayſelben, to draw up a formulary which might ſerve as a rule of faith and
                    worſhip, till the council ſhould be affembled : but as this was only a temporary
                    expedient, and had not the force of a permanent or perpetual inſtitution, it
                    thence obtained the name of the <hi rend="italic">Interim.</hi></p>
                <p>This project of Charles was formed partly with a deſign to vent his reſentment
                    againſt the pope, and partly to anſwer other political purpoſes. It contain-ed
                    all the eſſential doctrines of the church of Rome, though conſiderably foftened
                    by the artful terms which were employed, and which were quite different from
                    thoſe employed before and after this period by the council of Trent. There was
                    even an affected ambiguity in many oſ the expreffiυns, which made them
                    ſufceptible of different ſenſes, and applicable to the ſentiments of both
                    communions. The conſequence of all this was, that the imperial creed was
                    reprobated by both parties. However, it was promulgated with great ſolemnity by
                    the emperor at Augſhurg. The elector of Mentz, without even afl&lt;ing the
                    opinion of the princes preſent, gave a ſanction <hi rend="italic">Λ,ο</hi> this formula, as if he had been commiffioned to repreſent the whole diet- Many
                    kept ſilence through fear, and that ſilence was interpreted as a tacit conſent.
                    Some had the courage to oppoſe it, and theſe were reduced by force of arms ; and
                    the moſt deplorable ſcenes of bloodſhed and violence were acted throughout the
                    whole empire. Maurice, elector of Saxony, who had hitherto kept neutral, now
                    affembled the whole of his nobility and clergy, in order to deliberate on this
                    critical affair. At the head of the latter was Melancthon, whoſe word was

                <p>th⅛ m¾n had not the courage of Luther ∣ and was therefore on all occaſions ready
                    to make conceſſions, and to propoſe ſchemes of accommodation. In the preſent
                    caſe, therefore, he gave it as his opinion, that the whole of the book called <hi rend="italic">Interim</hi> could not by any means be adopted by the
                    Proteſtants; but at ſame time he declared, that, he ſaw no reaſon why this book
                    might not be appproved, adopted, and received, as an authoritative rule in
                    things that did not relate to the ciſential parts of religion, and which he
                    accounted indifferent. But this ſcheme, inſtead of cementing tlie differences,
                    made them much worſe than ever ; and produced a divjſion among the Proteſtants
                    themſelves, which might have overthrown the Reformation en-tirely, if the
                    emperor and pope had ſeized the oppoι⅛ tunity.</p>
                <p>In the year 1549, the pope (Paul ∏I.) died; and w <hi rend="sup">,</hi> as
                    ſucceeded by Julius III. who, at the repeated fo-licitations of the emperor,
                    conſented to the re-aſſem-bling oſ a council at Trent. A diet was again held at
                    Augſhurg under the cannon of an imperial army, and Charles laid the matter.
                    before the princes of the em*= pire. Moſt of theſe preſent gave their conſent to
                    it, and among the reſt Maurice elector of Saxony $ who conſented on the
                    following conditions ; 1, That the points of doctrine which had already been
                    decided there, ſhould be re-examined.2. That this eχami-nation ſhould be made in
                    preſence of the Proteſtant divines. 3. That the Saxon Proteſtants ſhould have a
                    liberty of voting as well as of deliberating in the council. 4. That the pope
                    ſhouid not pretend to pre-fide in that aſſembly, either in perfon or by his
                    legates. This declaration of Maurice was read in the diet, and his deputies
                    inſiſted upon its being entered into the regiſters which the archbiſhop of Mentz
                    obſtinately re-fuſed. The diet was concluded in the year 1551 ; and, at its
                    breaking up, the emperor deſired the aſſembled princes and ſtates to prepare all
                    things for the approaching council, and promifed to uſe his ut-moſt endeavours
                    to procure moderation and harmony, impartiality and charity, in the tranſactions
                    of that aſ-fembly.</p>
                <p>Οη the breaking up of the diet, the Proteſtants took fuch ſteps as they thought
                    moſt proper for their own ſafety. The Saxons employed Melancthon, and the
                    wurtembergers Brengius, to draw up Confeſſions of Faith to be laid before the
                    new council. The Saxon di-vines, however, proceeded no farther than Nuremberg,
                    having received ſecret orders from Maurice to ſtop there : For the elector,
                    perceiving that Charles had formed deſigns againſt the liberties of the German
                    princes, reſolved to take the moſt effectual meaſures for cruſhing his ambition
                    at once. He therefore entered with the utmQſt fecrecy and expedition into an
                    alliance with the king of France, and ſeveral of the German princes, for the
                    ſecurity of the rights and liberties of the empire ; after which, aſſembling a
                    powerful army in 1552, he marched againſt the emperor, who lay with a handful of
                    troops at Inſpruck, and expected no ſuch thing. By thi3 ſudden and unforeſeen
                    accident Charles was ſo much diſpirited, that he was willing to make peace
                    almoſt on any terms, The conſequence ef this was, that he concluded a treaty at
                    Paſſau, which by the Proteſtants is conſidered as the bafis of their religi-«us
                    liberty. By the firſt three articles of this treaty it</p>
                <p>was agreed, that Maurice and the eon⅛4βFStfs ſh¢ſtd lay down their arms, and
                    lend their troops to Ferdinand to aſſiſt him againſt the Turks ↑ and that the
                    landgrave of Heſſe ſhould be ſet at liberty. By the fourth it was agreed, that
                    the Rule of Faith called the <hi rend="italic">Interim</hi> ſhould be
                    confidered as null and void ; that the contending parties ſhould enjoy the free
                    and undiſturixd exerciſe of their religion, until a diet ſhould be aſſetrw bled
                    to determine amicably the prefent diſputes (which diet was to meet in the ſpace
                    of ſix months) ; and. that this religious liberty ſhould continue always, in
                    caſe it ſhould be found impoſſible to come to an uniformity in doctrine and
                    worſhip. It was alſo determined, that all thoſe who had ſuffered baniſhment, or
                    any other eala∙* mity, on account of their having been concerned in the league
                    or war of Smalca!d&gt; ſhould. be iesnſtated in their privileges,
                    poſieſſions, and employments ; that the im« pedal chamber at Spire ſhould be
                    open to the. Prate· Hants as well as to the Catholics 5 and that there ſhould
                    always be a certain number of Lutherans in that high court.-—To this peace
                    Albert, marquis of Branden-burg, refufed to ſubfcribe ; and continued the war
                    agamſt the Roman-catholics, committing ſuch ravagea in the empire, that a
                    confederacy was at laſt formed again ſt him, At the head of this confederacy was
                    Maurice elector of Saxony, who died of a wound he received in a battle fought on
                    the occaſion in 155 3,</p>
                <p>The affembling of the diet promiſed by Charles was prevented by various
                    incidents ; however it met at Augſhurg in 1555, where it was opened by Ferdinand
                    in name of the emperor, and terminated thoſe deplorable calamities which had ſh
                    long deſolated the empire» After various debates, the following acts were
                    paffed, on the 25th of September t That the Prote-ſtants who followed the
                    Confeſſion of Augſhurg ſhould be for the future conſidered as entirely free from
                    the ju∙ riſdiction of the Roman pontiff, and from the authority and
                    fuperintendance of the biſhops 5 that they were left at perfect liberty to enact
                    laws for themſelves relating to their religious ſentiments, diſcipline, and
                    worſhip j that all the inhabitants oſ the German empire ſhould be allowed to
                    judge for themſelves in religious matteι⅜ and to join themſelves to that church
                    whole doctrine and worſhip they thought the moſt pure and ¢onfimant to the
                    ſpirit of true Chriſtianity 5 and that all thoſe who ſhould injure or perſecute
                    any perfon under reli» gious pretences, and on account of their opinions, ſhould
                    be declared and proceeded againſt as public enemies oſ the empire, invaders of
                    its liberty, and diſturbers of its peace.</p>
                <p>Thus was the Reformation eſtabliſhed in many parts of the German empire, where
                    it continues to this day j nor have the efforts of the Popiſh powers at any time
                    been able to fupprefs it, or even to prevent it from gaining ground. It was not,
                    however, in Germany alone that a reformation of religion took place, Ak moſt all
                    the kingdoms of Europe began to open their eyes to the truth about the ſame
                    time. The reformed religion was propagated in Sweden, ſoon after Lu-ther’s
                    rupture with the church of Rome, by onc of his diſciples named <hi rend="italic"
                        > Olaus Petri,</hi> The zealous efforts of this miſſionary were feconded by
                    Guſtavws Vafi⅛ whom the Swedes had raifed to the throne in place of Chriſtiern
                    king of Denmark, whoſe horrid barbarity loſt him the crown. This priaee,
                    however, was as</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r01-0047" facs="gri_33125011196389_0053.tif"/>
                <p>prudent a∣ he was zealous ; and, as the minds of the Swedes were in a
                    fluctuating ſtate, he wifely avoided all kind of vehemence and precipitation in
                    ſpreading the new doctrine. Accordingly, the firft object of his attention was
                    the inſtruction of his people in the ſa-cred doctrines of the Holy Scriptures :
                    for which pur-poſe he invited into his dominions feveral learned Ger-mans, and
                    ſpread abroad through the kingdom the Swediſh tranſlation of the Bible that had
                    been made by olaus Petri. Some time after this, in 1526, he appointed a
                    conference at Upfal, between this reformer and Peter Gallius, a zealous defender
                    of the ancient ſu-perſtition, in which each of the champions was to bring forth
                    his arguments, that it might be ſeen on which fide the truth lay. In this
                    diſpute olaus obtained a fignal victory ; which contributed much to confirm
                    Guſtavus in his perſuaſion of the truth of Luther’s doc-trine, and to promote
                    its progrefs in Sweden. The following year another event gave the finiſhing
                    ſtroke to its propagation and ſuccefs. This was the aſſembly ¢f the ſtates at
                    weſteraas, where Guſtavus recommend-ed the doctrine of the reformers with ſuch
                    zeal, that, after warm debates fomented by the clergy in general, rt was
                    unanimouſly refolved that the reformation introduced by Lutiιer ſhould have
                    place in Sweden. This refolution was principally owing to the firmneſs and
                    magnanimity of Guſtavus, who declared publicly, that he would lay down the
                    fceptre and retire from the kingdom, rather than rule a people enſlaved by the
                    orders and authority of the pope, and more contracted by the tyranny of their
                    biſhops than by the laws of their monarch. From this time the papal empire in
                    Sweden was entirely overthrown, and Guſtavus declared head of the church.</p>
                <p>In Denmark, the reformation was introduced as early as the year 1 ς2τ, in
                    conſequence of the ardent deſire diſcovered by Chriſtiern II. of having his
                    fubjects in-ſtructed in the doctrines of Luther. This monarch, notwithſtanding
                    his cruelty, for which his name has been rendered odious, was nevertheleſs
                    deſirous of delivering his dominions from the tyranny of the church of Rome. For
                    this purpofe, in the year 1 Ç20, he ſent for Martin Reinard, one of the
                    difciples of Carloſtadt, out of Saxony, and appointed him profeffor of divinity
                    at Hafnia ; and after his death, which happened in 1521, he invited Carloſtadt
                    himielf to fill that important place. Carloſtadt accepted of this office indeed,
                    but in a ſhort time returned to Germany ; upon which Chriſtiern uſed his utmoſt
                    endeavours to engage Lu-ther to viſit his dominions, but in vain. However, the
                    progreſs of Chriſtiern, in reforming the religion of his ſubjects, or rather of
                    advancing his own power above that of the church, was checked, in the year 1523,
                    by a conſpiracy, by which he was depofed and baniſhed ; his uncle Frederic·,
                    duke of Holilein and Sleſwic, being appointed his ſucceſſor.</p>
                <p>Frederic conducted the reformation with much greater prudence than his
                    predeceſſor. He permitted the Proteſtant doctors to preach publicly the
                    fentiments of Luther, but did not venture to change the eſtabliſh-ed government
                    and diſcipline of the church. However, he contributed greatly to the progreſs of
                    the reforma-tion, by his ſucceſsful attempts in favour of religious liberty in
                    an aſſembly of the ſtates held at odenſee in 1527. Here he procured the
                    publication of a famous</p>
                <p>edict, by which every ſubject of Denmark was deekj' red free either to adhere to
                    the tenets of the church of Rome, or to tfie doctrine of Luther. The papal
                    tyranny was totally deſtroyed by his ſucceſſor Chri-ſtiern III. He began by
                    ſuppreſſing the deſpotic au» thority of the biſhops, and reſtoring to their
                    lawful owners a great part of the wealth and poſſeſſions which the church had
                    acquired by various ſtratagems. Ι'fiis was followed by a plan of religious
                    doctrine, worſhip, and discipline, laid down by Bugenhagius, whom the king had
                    ſent for from wittemberg for that purpoſe ; and in 1539 <hi rend="sup">an</hi> aſſembly oſ the ſtates at odenſee gave a ſolemn ſanction to all theſc
                    tranſactions.</p>
                <p>In France alſo, the reformation began to make ſome progreſs very early. Margaret
                    queen of Navarre, fiſter to Francis I. the perpetual rival of Charles V. was a
                    great friend to the new doctrine ; and it appears that, as early as the year
                    1523, there were in ſeveral of the provinces of France great numbers of people
                    who had conceived the greateſt averſion both to the doctrine and tyranny of the
                    church of Rome ; among whom were many of the firſt rank and dignity, and even
                    ſome of the epiſcopal order. But as their number increafed daily, and troubles
                    and commotions were excited in ſeveral places on account of the religious
                    differences, the authority of the king intervened, and many perſons eminent for
                    their virtue and piety were put to death in the moſt barbarous manner. Indeed
                    Francis, who had either no religion at all, or, at beſt, no fixed and conſiſtent
                    fyſtem of religious principles, conducted himſelf towards the Proteſtants in
                    ſuch a manner as beſt anſwered his private views. Sometimes he reſolved to
                    invite Melancthon into France, probably with a view to pleaſe his fiſter the
                    queen of Navarre, whom he loved tenderly, and who had ſtrongly imbibed the
                    Proteſtant principles. At other times he eχ-ercifed the moſt infernal cruelty
                    towards the reformed ; and once made the following mad declaration, That if he
                    thought the blood in his arm was tainted by the Lutheran hereſy, he woctd have
                    ſt cut off ; and that he woctd not ſpare even his own children, if they
                    en-tertained ſentiments contrary to thoſe of the Catholic church.</p>
                <p>About this time the famous Calvin began to draw the attention of the public, but
                    more eſpecially of the queen of Navarre His zeal expofed him to danger j and the
                    friends of the reformation, whom Francis was daily committing to the flames,
                    placed him more than once in the moſt perilous ſituation, from which he was
                    delivered by the interpoſition of the queen of Navarre. He therefore retired out
                    of France to Baſil in Swiſſei-land; where he publiſhed his Chriſtian
                    Inſtitutions, and became afterwards ſo famous.</p>

                    been the caſe : for the vicinity of the cities of Geneva, Laufanne, &amp;c.
                    which had adopted the doctrines of Calvin, produced a remarkable effect upon the
                    French Proteſtant churches ; infomuch that, about the middle of this century,
                    they all entered into communion with the church of Geneva. The French

                    all his ſubjects full liberty of conſcience by the famous Edict of Nantes, and
                    ſeemed to have thoroughly eſtabliſhed the reformation throughout his dominions.
                    Du-ring the minority of Louis XIV. however, this edict was revoked by Cardinal
                    Mazarine, -ſince which time the Proteſtants have often been cruelly perſecuted ;
                    nor was the profeſſion of the reformed religion in France at any time fo ſafe as
                    in moſt other countries of Europe. See Revolution.</p>
                <p>In the other parts of Europe the oppoſition to the church of Rome was but faint
                    and ambiguous before the diet of Augſhurg. Before that period, however, it
                    appears from undoubted teſtimony, that the doctrine of Luther had made a
                    conſiderable, though probably ſecret, progreſs through Spain, Hungary, Bohemia,
                    Britain, Poland, and the Netherlands ; and had in all theſe countries many
                    friends, of whom ſeveral repaired to wittemberg, in order to enlarge their
                    knowledge by means of Luther’s converfation. Some of theſe countries threw off
                    the Romiſh yoke entirely, and in others a prodigious number of families embraced
                    the principles of the reformed religion. 'It is certain in-deed, and the
                    Roman-catholics themſelves acknowledge it without heſitation, that the Papal
                    doctrines and authority would have fallen into ruin in all parts of the world at
                    once, had not the force of the ſecular arm been employed to ſupport the
                    tottering edifice. In the Netherlands particularly, the moſt grievous
                    perſecutions took place, fo that by the emperor Charles V. upwards of 100,000
                    were deſtroyed, while ſtill greater cruelties were exerciſed upon the people by
                    his ſon Philip II. The revolt of the United Provinces, however, and motives of
                    real policy, at laſt put a ſtop to theſe furiou3 proceedings ; and, though in
                    many provinces of the Netherlands, the eſtabliſhment of the Popiſh religion was
                    ſtill continued, the Proteſtants have been long free of the dangeι of
                    perſecution on account of their principles.</p>
                <p>The reformation made a conſiderable progreſs in Spain and Italy foon after the
                    rupture between Luther and the Roman pontiff. In ail the provinces of Italy, but
                    more eſpecially in the territories of venice, Tuſcany, and Naples, the
                    ſuperſtition of Rome loſt ground, and great numbers of people of all ranks
                    expreſſed an averſion to the Papal yoke. This occafioned violent and dangerous
                    commotions in the kingdom cf Naples in the year 1546 ; which, however, were at
                    laſt quelled by the united efforts of Charles V. and his viceroy Don Pedro di
                    Toledo. In ſeveral places the pope put a ſtop to the progreſs of the
                    reformation, by letting lo»fe the inquiſitors ; who ſpread dreadful marks of
                    their barbarity through the greattſt part of Italy. Theſe formidable miniſters
                    of ſuperſtition put ſo many to death, and perpetrated ſuch horrid acts of
                    cruelty and .oppreſſion, that moſt of the reformed conſulted their ſafety by a
                    voluntary exile, while others returned to the religion of Rome, at leaſt in
                    external appearance. 'But the inquiſition, which frighted into the profeſſion of
                    Popery ſeveral Proteſtants in other parts of Italy,</p>
                <p>could never make its way into the kingdom of Naples; nor could either the
                    authority or intreaties of the pope engage the NeapoIitans to admit even
                    vifiting in-quiſitors.</p>
                <p>In Spain, ſeveral people embraced the Proteſtant. religion, not only from the
                    controverses of Luther, but even from thoſe divines whom Charles V. had brought
                    with him into Germany in order to refute the doctrines of Luther. For theſe
                    doctors imbibed the pre-tended hereſy inſtead of refuting it, and propagated it
                    more or leſs on their return home. But the inquiſition, which could obtain no
                    footing in Naples, reigned triumphant in Spain, and by the moſt dreadful methods
                    frightened the people back into Popery, and ſuppreſſcd the deſire of exchanging
                    their ſuperſtition for a more rational plan of ιeligion. It was indeed preſumed
                    that Charles himfelf died a Proteſtant ; and it ſeems to be certain, that, when
                    the approach of dcath had diſſipated thofe ſchemes of ambition and grandeur
                    which had fo long blinded him, his ſentimeuts became much more rational and
                    agreeable to Chriſtianity than they had ever been. All the eccleſiaſtics who had
                    attended him, as ſoon as he expired, were ſent to the inquiſition, and committed
                    to the flames, or put to death by ſome other method equally terrible. Such was
                    the fate of Auguſtine Caſal, the emperor’s preacher ; of Conſtantine Pontius,
                    his confeſſor ; of Egidius, whom he had named to the biſhopric of Tortoſa; of
                    Bartholomew de Caranza, a Dominican, who had been confeſſor to King Philip and
                    Queen Mary ; with 20 others, of leſs note.</p>
                <p>In England, the principles of the reformation began to be adopted as ſoon as an
                    account of Luther’s doctrines could be conveyed thither. In that kingdom there
                    werc ſtill great remains of the ſect called Lo∕- <hi rend="italic">lards <hi
                            rend="sub"> t</hi></hi> whoſe doctrine reſembled that of Luther ; and among whom, of conſequence,
                    the ſentiments of our reformer gained great credit. Henry VIII. king of England
                    at that time was a violent partiſan of the church of Rome, and had a particular
                    veneration for the writings of Thomas Aψιinas. Being informed that Luther ſpoke
                    of his favourite author with con-tempt, he conceived a violent prejudice
                    "againſt the reformer, and even wrote againſt him, as we have already obſerved.
                    Luther did not heſitate at writing againſt his majeſty, overcame him in
                    argument, and treated him with very little ceremony. The firſt ſtep towards
                    public reformation, however, was not taken till the year *529. Great complaints
                    had been made in Eng-land, and of a very ancient date, of the uſurpations of the
                    clergy ; and by the prevalence of the Lutheran opinions, thefe complaints were
                    now become more general than before. The Houfe of Commons, finding the occaſion
                    favourable, paſſed ſeveral bills, reſtraining the impoſitions of the clergy :
                    but what threatened the eccleſiaſtical order with the greateſt danger were the
                    ſevere rt proaches thrown out almoſt without oppoſition in the houſe againſt the
                    diffolute lives, ambition, and avarice of the prieſts, and their continual
                    encroach-ments on the privileges of the laity. The bills for regulating the
                    clergy met with oppoſition in the Houſe of Lords ; and biſhop Fiſher imputed
                    them to want of faith in the Commons, and to a formed deſign, pro-ceeding from
                    heretical and Lutheran principles, of robbing the church of her patrimony, and
                    overturning the national religion. The Commons., however, complain-</p>

                <p>cd to the king, by their ſpeaker Sir Thomas Audley, of thele reflections thrown
                    out againſt them ; and the. biſhop was obliged to retract his words.</p>
                <p>Though Henry had not the leaſt idea of rejecting any, even of the moſt abſurd
                    Romiſh ſuperſtitions, yet as the oppreſſions of the clergy ſuited very ill with
                    the violence of his own temper, he was pleaſed with every opportunity of
                    leffening their power. In the parliament of 1531, he ſhowed his deſign of
                    humbling the clergy in the moſt effectual manner. An obſolete ſtatute was
                    revived, from which it was pretended that it was criminal to ſubmit to the
                    legatine power which had been exerciſed by cardinal wolſey. By this ftroke the
                    whole body of clergy was declared guilty at once. They were too well acquainted
                    with Henry’s diſpoſition, however, to reply, that their ruin would have been the
                    certain conſequence of their not ſubmitting to wolſey’s commiſſion which had
                    been given by royal authority. Inſtead of making any defence of this kind, they
                    choſe to throw themſelves on the mercy of their ſovereign ; whieh, however, it
                    coil them 118,8401. to procure. A confeſſion was likewife extorted from them,
                    that the king was protector and ſupreme head of the church of England ; though
                    ſome of them had the dexterity to get a clauſe inferted, which invalidated the
                    whole ſubmiſſion, viz. <hi rend="italic">in Jo far as is permitted by the law
                        of Chrifl.</hi></p>
                <p>The king, having thus begun to reduce the power of the clergy, kept no bounds
                    with them,afterwards. He did not indeed attempt any reformation in religious
                    matters ; nay, he perſecuted moſt violently ſuch as did attempt this in the
                    leaſt. Indeed, the moſt effential article of his creed ſeems to have been his
                    own ſupre-macy ; for whoever denied this, was ſure to ſuffer the moſt ſevere
                    penalties, whether Proteſtant or Papiſt. But an account of the abſurd and cruel
                    conduct of this prince, and of his final quarrel with the pope on aecount of his
                    refuſing a diſpenſation to marry Anne Bo-leyn, is given under the article
                    England, n <hi rend="sup">o</hi> 253— 292.</p>
                <p>He died in 1547, aud was ſucceeded by his only ſon Edward VI. This amiable
                    prince, whofe early youth was crowned with that wiſdom, ſagacity, and virtue,
                    that would have done honour to advanced years, ,gave new ſpirit and vigour to
                    the Proteſtant cauſe, and was its brighteſt ornament, as weſt as its moſt
                    effectual ſupport. He encouraged learned and pious men cf foreign countries to
                    fettle in England, and addreſ-ſed a particular invitation to Martin Bucer and
                    Paul Fagius, whoſe moderation added a luſtre to their other virtues, that, by
                    the miniſtry and labours of theſe eminent men, in concert with thoſe of the
                    friends of the Reformation in England, he might purge his domi-nions from the
                    fordid fictions of popery, and eſtabliſh the pure doctrines of Chriſtianity in
                    their place. For this purpoſe, he iffued out the wiſeſt orders for the
                    reſtoration of true religion; but his reign was too ſhort to accompliſh fully
                    ſuch a glorious purpoſe. In the year 1553, he was taken from hrs loving and
                    afflicted -ſubjects, whoſe ſorrow was inexpreſſihle, and ſuited to their loſs.

                    ſeparated by the famous divorce), a furious bigot to the elιurch of Rome, and a
                    prîncefs whoſe natural character, like the ſpirit of her religion, was deſpotic
                    and cruel, ſucceeded him on the Britiſh throne, and impoſed anew the arbitrary
                    laws and the tyrannical yoke of Rome upon the people of England. Nor were the
                    methods ſhe employed in the eauſe of ſuperſtition better than the cauſe itſelf',
                    or tempered by any ſentiments of equity or com-. paſſion. Barbarous tortures and
                    death, in the moſt ſhocking forms, awaited thoſe who oppofed her will, or made
                    the leaſt ſtand againſt the reſtoration of Popery. And among many other victims,
                    the learned and pious Cranmer, archbi(hop of Canterbury, who had been one <hi
                        rend="italic"> ot</hi> the moſt iſtuſtrious inſtruments of the Reformation
                    in England, fell a ſacriſice to her ſury. This odious ſcene of perſecution was
                    happily concluded in the year 1558, by the death of the queen, who left no
                    iffιιe ; and, as ſoon as her ſucceiſor the lady Elizabeth aſcended the throne,
                    all things affumed a new and a plealin-∕ afpect. This iſtuſtrious princeſs,
                    whoſe fentiments°, counſels, and projects, breathed a ſpirit ſuperior to the
                    natural ſoftneſs and delicacy of her ſex, exerted this vigorous and manly ſpirit
                    in the defence of oppreffed conſcience and expiring liberty, broke anew the
                    de-ſpotic yoke of Papal authority and ſuperſtition, and, delivering her people
                    from the bondage of Rome, eſtabliſhed that form of religious doctrine and
                    eccleſiaſtical government which ſtill ſubſiſts in England. This religious
                    eſtabliſhment differs, in ſome reſpects, from the plan that had been formed by
                    thoſe whom Edward VI. had employed for promoting the cauſe of the Reforma- <hi

                <p>tion, and approaches nearer to the rites and diſcipline " of former.times ;
                    though it is widely different, and, in the moſt important points, entirely
                    oppoſite to the principles of the Roman hierarchy. See England, n <hi rend="sup"

                <p>The cauſe of the reformation underwent in Ireland the ſame viciſſitudes and
                    revolutions that had attended it in England, when Henry VHL after the abolition
                    of tlie Papal authority, was declared ſupreme head upon eaιtiι of the church of
                    England, George Brown, a native of England, and a monk of the Auguſtine order,
                    whom that monarch had created, in the year 1535, archbiſhop of Dublin, began to
                    act with the utmoſt vigour in conſequence of this change in the hierarchy. He
                    purged the churches of his dioceſe from ſuperſtition in all its various forms,
                    pulled down images, deſtroyed relics, aboliſhed abſurd and idolatrous rites,
                    and, by the influence as weſt as authority he had in Ireland, cauſed the king’s
                    ſupremacy to be acknowledged in that nation. Henry ſhowed, ſoon after, that this
                    ſupremacy was not a vain title ; for he baniſhed the monks out of that kingdom,
                    connſcated their revenues, and deſtroyed their couvents. In the reign of Edward
                    VI. ſtſtl farther progreſs was made in the removal of Popiſh ſuperſtitions, by
                    the. zealous labours of biſhop Brown, and the aufpicious encouragement he
                    granted to all who exerted themſelves in the cauſe of the Reformation. But the
                    death of this excellent prince, and the acceſſion of queen Mary, had like to
                    have changed the face of affairs in Ireland as much as in, England ; but her
                    deligns were difappointed by a very curious adventure, of which the following
                    account has been copied from the papers of Richard earl of Cυrke.</p>
                <p>" Queen Mary having dealt ſeverely with the Proteſtants in England, about the
                    latter end of her reign ſigned a commiſſion for to take the ſame courſe with
                    them in Ireland ; and to execute the fame with greater force, ſhe nominates Dr
                    Cole one of the commiſſioners. This Doctor coming, with the commiſſion, to

                <p>on his journey, the mayor of that city hearing that her majeſty was fending a
                    meffenger into Ireland, and he being a churchman, waited on the Doctor, who in
                    diſcourſe with the mayor taketh out of a cloke-bag a leather box, faying unto
                    him, <hi rend="italic">Here is a commjffton that fijall !afii the Heretics of
                        Ireland,</hi> calling the Proteſtants by that title. The good woman of the
                    houſe being-well affected to the Proteftant religion, and alſo having a brother
                    named <hi rend="italic">John Edmonds</hi> of the ſame, then a citizen in
                    Dublin, was much troubled at the Doctor’s words ; but watching her convenient
                    time while the mayor took his leave, and the Doctor complimented him down the
                    flairs, ſhe opens the box, takes the commiſſion out, and places in lieu thereof
                    a ſheet of paper with a pack of cards wrapt up therein, the knave of clubs being
                    faced uppermoſt. The Doctor coming up to his chamber, ſuſpecting nothing of what
                    had been done, put up the box as formerly. The next day going to tbe water.ſide,
                    wind and weather ſerving him, he fails towards Ireland, and landed on the 7th of
                    Gc-tober 1558 at Dublin. Then coming to the eaſtle, the Lord Fitz-AYalters being
                    lord-deputy, ſent for him to come before him and the privy-council ; who, coming
                    in, after he had made a fpeech relating upon what account he came over, he
                    preſents the box unto the lord-deputy ; who cauſing it to be opened, that the
                    .fecretary might read the commiſſion, there was nothing</p>
                <p>ſave a pack of cards with the knave of clubs uppermoſt ; which not only ſtartlcd
                    the lord-deputy and council, but the Doctor, who affured them he had a
                    commiſſion, but knew not how it was gone. Then the lord-deputy made anſwer : Let
                    us have another commiſſion, and we will ſhuffle the cards in the meanwhile. The
                    Doctor being troubled in his mind, went away, and returned into England, and
                    coming to the court obtained another commiſſion ; but flaying for a wind on the
                    water-iide, news came to him that the queen was dead : and thus God preſerved
                    the Proteſtants of Ireland.” Queen Elizabeth was ſo delighted with this ſtory,
                    which was related to her by lord Fitz-walter on his return to England, that file
                    ſent for Elizabeth Edmonds, whoſe huſhand’s name was <hi rend="italic">Matterjhad,</hi> and gave her a penſion of 40 1. during her life.</p>
                <p>In Scotland, the feeds oſ reformation were very early ſown, by ſeveral noblemen
                    who had reſided in Germany during the religious diſputes there. But ſor many
                    years it was ſuppreffed by the power of the pope, ſeconded by inhuman laws and
                    barbarous executions. The moſt eminent oppoſer of the Papal juriſdiction was

                    encouraged them to go on with their work notwithſtanding the oppoſition and
                    treachery of the queen-regent; till at laſt, in 1561, by the aſſiſtance of an
                    Engliſh army ſent by Elizabeth, Po-pery was in a manner totally extirpated
                    throughout the kingdom. From this period the form of doctrine, wor-Ihip, and
                    diſcipline eſtabliſhed by Calvin at Geneva, has had the aſcendancy in Scotland.
