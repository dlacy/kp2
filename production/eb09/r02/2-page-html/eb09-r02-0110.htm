<p><span class="font0">was led to make designs of his own, founded upon his study of old examples ; and, when a large grant of money&nbsp;was made by the Government to build new churches, he&nbsp;sent in a design of his own which was successful in an&nbsp;open competition; thus he was fairly launched upon the&nbsp;profession of an architect, for which his natural gifts&nbsp;strongly fitted him. Rickman then moved to Birmingham,&nbsp;and at first worked at his new profession with Mr H.&nbsp;Hutchinson as managing clerk ; and when he died in 1830&nbsp;Rickman entered into partnership with Mr Hussey, having&nbsp;become one of the most successful architects of his time.&nbsp;He built an immense number of churches, chapels, and&nbsp;other buildings, among which some of the chief are&nbsp;churches at Hampton Lucy, Ombersley, and Stretton-on-Dunsmore, St George’s at Birmingham, St Philip’s and St&nbsp;Matthew’s both in Bristol, two in Carlisle, St Peter’s and&nbsp;St Paul’s at Preston, St David’s in Glasgow, Grey Friars&nbsp;at Coventry, and many others. He also designed the new&nbsp;court of St John’s College, Cambridge, a palace for the&nbsp;bishop of Carlisle, and several large country houses. These&nbsp;are all in the Gothic style, but, though superior perhaps to&nbsp;the buildings of his predecessors, they show more knowledge of the outward form of the mediaeval style than&nbsp;any real acquaintance with its spirit, and are little better&nbsp;than dull copies of old work, disfigured by much poverty&nbsp;of detail. Rickmann nevertheless was an important stage&nbsp;in the revival of taste for mediævalism, perhaps in that&nbsp;respect only second to Pugin. His book entitled </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">An Attempt&nbsp;to Discriminate the Styles of Architecture in England</span><span class="font0"> is&nbsp;a work which deserves great credit for its painstaking&nbsp;research ; a great many editions of it were published, and&nbsp;it was eventually much improved and enlarged. Rickman&nbsp;died in 1841.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RIDDLES are probably the oldest extant form of humour. They spring from man’s earliest perception&nbsp;that there are such things as analogies in nature. Man&nbsp;observes an example of analogy, puts his observations in&nbsp;the form of a question, and there is the riddle ready made.&nbsp;Some Boeotian humorist, for example, detected the analogy between the life of humanity—the child on all fours,&nbsp;the man erect on two legs, old age with its staff—on one&nbsp;side, and on the other the conception of an animal with&nbsp;a varying number of limbs. Put this in a question, and it&nbsp;is the riddle of the Sphinx. Another instance is the question—“ What we caught we threw away, what we could&nbsp;not catch we kept. ” Homer is said to have died of vexation&nbsp;at not being able to discover the answer to this riddle,&nbsp;still current on the coast of Brittany, in Germany, and&nbsp;in Gascony. After inventing the riddle, men began to use&nbsp;it in a kind of game ; bets were staked on the answer,&nbsp;and sides were made, each side backing its champion.&nbsp;These sports in Marriner’s time were common in Tonga ;&nbsp;they are no less popular among the African Woloffs. The&nbsp;example of Samson’s riddle set to the Philistines is an&nbsp;instance of the sport in a Semitic country. In mährchen&nbsp;and ballads, the hero’s chance of winning his beloved, or&nbsp;of escaping threatened punishment, is often made to turn&nbsp;on his power of answering riddles. It follows from the&nbsp;artless and primitive character of the riddle that regular&nbsp;popular riddles </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Devinettes)</span><span class="font0"> are widely distributed, like&nbsp;popular tales, popular songs, and popular customs. The&nbsp;Woloffs ask, “ What flies for ever and rests never?” Answer,&nbsp;The Wind. The Basutos put this riddle—“ What is wingless and legless, yet flies fast and cannot be imprisoned ? ”&nbsp;Answer, The Voice. The German riddle runs—“ What&nbsp;can go in face of the sun yet leave no shadow </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ί ”</span><span class="font0"> Answer,&nbsp;The Wind. In riddles may perhaps be noticed the animistic or personalizing tendency of early human thought,&nbsp;just beginning to be conscious of itself. The person who&nbsp;asked these riddles had the old sense of wind, for example,&nbsp;as a person, yet probably, unlike the Bushmen, he would&nbsp;never expect to see the personal wind. He knew the&nbsp;distinction between the personal and impersonal well&nbsp;enough to be sure that his enigma would present some&nbsp;difficulty. The riddle, to be brief, is an interrogatory&nbsp;form of the fable, and like the fable originates among&nbsp;rude people, and is perpetuated in the folklore of&nbsp;peasantry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Probably the best book on the riddle (a subject less frequently studied than the mährchen or the myth) is&nbsp;Eugène Rolland, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Devinettes ou Énigmes Populaires,</span><span class="font0"> with a&nbsp;preface by M. Gaston Paris. The power of answering&nbsp;riddles among the people who invented the legend of&nbsp;Solomon and the queen of Sheba seems to have been&nbsp;regarded as a proof of great sagacity. The riddle proper&nbsp;is all but extinct outside folklore and savage life, and&nbsp;has been replaced by the conundrum, which is a pun in&nbsp;the interrogative form.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RIDLEY, Nicholas (c. 1500-1555), bishop of London, and a martyr to the Reformation, was descended from a&nbsp;family long seated in Northumberland. The second son of&nbsp;Nicholas Ridley of Unthank near Willimoteswick in that&nbsp;county, he was born in the beginning of the 16th century. From the grammar school of Newcastle-upon-Tyne&nbsp;he was sent to Pembroke College, Cambridge, about 1518,&nbsp;being supported there by his uncle, Dr Robert Ridley, fellow&nbsp;of Queen’s College. At the university he specially distinguished himself in Greek. He proceeded B.A. 1522-23,&nbsp;became a fellow of his college, and, having taken orders,&nbsp;was sent about 1527 at the expense of his uncle to&nbsp;study on the Continent, first at the Sorbonne, Paris, and&nbsp;afterwards at Louvain. On his return to Cambridge he&nbsp;was in 1530 chosen under-treasurer of the university; and&nbsp;in 1534 he was senior proctor, when along with the&nbsp;vice-chancellor and the other proctor Richard Wilkes he&nbsp;signed the decree of the university against the jurisdiction&nbsp;of the pope in England. About this time he began to distinguish himself as an orator and disputant, and was&nbsp;chosen chaplain of the university, and “ Magister Glo-meriæ,”—an office in which most probably (for its&nbsp;duties have been much disputed) he had to instruct the&nbsp;university entrants in Latin. Cranmer, archbishop of&nbsp;Canterbury, after Ridley had proceeded B.D. in 1537,&nbsp;appointed him one of his chaplains, and in April 1538&nbsp;collated him to the vicarage of Herne, Kent, where he&nbsp;began to preach the doctrines of the Reformation. In&nbsp;1540, having commenced doctor of divinity, he was made&nbsp;king’s chaplain ; and in the same year he was elected&nbsp;master of his college in Cambridge. Soon after he was&nbsp;appointed a canon of Canterbury. At the instigation of&nbsp;Bishop Gardiner he was accused in the bishop’s court&nbsp;of preaching against the doctrine of the Six Articles,&nbsp;but after the matter had been referred to commissioners specially appointed by the king he was&nbsp;acquitted. In 1545 he renounced the doctrine of tran-substantiation, and was made, a canon of Westminster. In&nbsp;1547 he was presented by the fellows of Pembroke Hall to&nbsp;the living of Soham, Cambridgeshire, and the same year&nbsp;was consecrated bishop of Rochester. In 1550 he was one&nbsp;of the commissioners for examining Bishops Gardiner and&nbsp;Bonner. He concurred in their deprivation, and succeeded&nbsp;the latter in the see of London. In 1552, returning from&nbsp;Cambridge, he paid a visit to the princess, afterwards&nbsp;Queen Mary, at Hunsdon, Hertfordshire. On account of&nbsp;her unqualified condemnation of the Reformed doctrines, he&nbsp;from this time concurred in the proposals to exclude her&nbsp;from the throne, and he signed the will of Edward VI.&nbsp;settling the crown on Lady Jane Grey. On the death&nbsp;of the king, he, in a sermon at St Paul’s Cross, 16th July</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
