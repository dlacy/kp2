<p><span class="font1">During the early period of the war the President checked all efforts on the part of zealous subordinates, civil and military,&nbsp;to make the war for the Union even incidentally a war upon&nbsp;slavery. In his efforts to unionize the border states Mr Lincoln&nbsp;in March 1862 urged that Congress should co-operate with any&nbsp;state in providing for a voluntary, gradual and compensated&nbsp;emancipation. Congress acceded, but not one of the border&nbsp;states would undertake emancipation. Many of the Republican&nbsp;leaders rejected the border state policy of the President and&nbsp;urged a more radical course towards slavery. In replying to&nbsp;Horace Greeley, who voiced the discontent in a public letter, to&nbsp;which he gave the title, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Prayer of Twenty Millions of People,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">Mr Lincoln in August 1862 wrote: </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“ My paramount object </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">is&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Io save the Union and not either to save or destroy slavery.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But as evidence accumulated that slavery was a strong military support of the Confederacy the policy of destroying&nbsp;slavery as a means of saving the Union grew in favour. To&nbsp;this policy Mr Lincoln on the 22nd of September 1862 committed himself, the Republican party and the cause of the&nbsp;Union. The first response was distinctly unfavourable. The&nbsp;immediate effect was “ to unite the South and divide the&nbsp;North.” A considerable element of the Democratic party&nbsp;became disloyal, while the party as a whole opposed all measures&nbsp;looking to the destruction of slavery. The autumn elections&nbsp;greatly reduced the Republican majority in Congress. But the&nbsp;new policy steadily gained ground until the Republican party&nbsp;in its third national convention, which met on the 7th of June&nbsp;1864, resolved: “ that as slavery was the cause and now&nbsp;constitutes the strength of this rebellion, justice and national&nbsp;safety demand its utter and complete extirpation from the soil&nbsp;of the republic.” In the following year slavery was finally&nbsp;abolished by the Thirteenth Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">On the Republican party, since it had an effective majority in each house of Congress, rests the responsibility for the legislation of the war period. The theory of loose construction of&nbsp;the Constitution was accepted. Throughout the Civil War,&nbsp;Congress, proceeding upon this theory, made prompt provision&nbsp;for the prosecution of the war. It passed Legal Tender Acts;&nbsp;it established a system of national banks; greatly raised the&nbsp;tariff rates; and in order to hasten the settlement of the Far&nbsp;West and to make that section an integral part of the Union,&nbsp;it passed a Homestead Act and an act providing for a railway to&nbsp;the Pacific. For a time, while disloyalty was most rife in the&nbsp;North, there was a sharp curtailment of the rights of the&nbsp;individual citizen through the suspension, initiated by the&nbsp;President 'and approved by Congress, of the writ of Habeas&nbsp;Corpus. Most of the acts, which their opponents held to be&nbsp;violations of the Constitution, were in general acts of questionable utility. The results of the war, which came to a close early&nbsp;in 1865, vindicated in a signal way the principles, policies&nbsp;and leadership of the Republican party. It had saved the&nbsp;Union; it had established the national character of the Union&nbsp;so firmly as to bring to an end the doctrine of the right of&nbsp;secession; and it had destroyed slavery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The party had been singularly fortunate in its founders and leaders. Of these three were pre-eminent: Horace Greeley,&nbsp;William H. Seward and Abraham Lincoln—Greeley in the field&nbsp;of journalism, Seward in the two realms of idealistic and practical&nbsp;politics, and, greatest of all, Abraham Lincoln who won and held&nbsp;the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Reconstruction.</span><span class="font1">—The larger tasks of the period from the close of the Civil War inT865 to the inauguration of Rutherford B.&nbsp;Hayes in 1877 were three: first, to accomplish with the least&nbsp;possible disturbance the transition from war to peace; second,&nbsp;to settle certain matters of dispute with France and England&nbsp;that had arisen during the progress of the war; and third, to&nbsp;reconstruct the South. Full responsibility for the way in which&nbsp;these tasks were discharged rests upon the Republican party,&nbsp;for it was in control of the presidency and the Senate throughout&nbsp;the period and of the House until December 1875. In thè first and&nbsp;second it was notably successful. The soldiers of North and South&nbsp;returned at once to the fields of productive labour. The colossal&nbsp;war establishment was quickly reduced to the requirements&nbsp;of peace. The French withdrew from Mexico. The Alabama&nbsp;Claims were submitted to arbitration. But the reconstruction&nbsp;of the South proved difficult in the extreme. The strain of a&nbsp;prolonged and exhausting war, the upheaval of emancipation,&nbsp;and the utter collapse of the Confederate government, had&nbsp;thrown the elements of social, economic and civil life in the&nbsp;South into almost hopeless disorder. To restore these to normal&nbsp;relations and working was but part of the task; the other and&nbsp;more important part was to apply those methods'of reconstruction which would tend to make one nation out of hitherto&nbsp;discordant sections. In his third annual message, Dec. 8th, 1863,&nbsp;Lincoln brought forward the so-called presidential plan of&nbsp;reconstruction. This was rejected on the ground that reconstruction was a Congressional rather than an executive function;&nbsp;and on thç<sup>v</sup>4th of July 1864 Congress passed a bill making&nbsp;Congress instead of the president the chief agent in the work&nbsp;of reconstruction. President Johnson adopted Lincoln’s plan,&nbsp;and put it into operation with such vigour that when Congress&nbsp;met in December 1865 all the states that had seceded were quite&nbsp;or nearly ready to demand the readmission of their representatives to the House and Senate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">From the standpoint of party the situation was highly critical. The men whom thc newly reconstructed states had sent to&nbsp;Washington represented the old South and would naturally&nbsp;join the opposition. Although the ratification of the Thirteenth&nbsp;Amendment, which abolished slavery, was assured, and a fortnight later was officially proclaimed, nevertheless the reconstructed legislatures were busy enacting police regulations&nbsp;which, in the opinion of most Republicans, threatened to reenslave the freedmen. With an earnestness like that which the&nbsp;party in earlier days had shown in opposing the extension of&nbsp;slavery, it now resolved to secure full civil rights to the freedmen.&nbsp;Another consideration of great weight in shaping party policy&nbsp;was the need of maintaining the rights of Congress against&nbsp;executive encroachment. Owing to the war and Lincoln’s&nbsp;masterful personality, the presidency had gained in prestige&nbsp;at the expense of Congress. The tendency thus established&nbsp;would be strengthened to a dangerous degree, it was thought,&nbsp;if the President were to take the leading part in reconstructing&nbsp;as well as in saving the Union. There now took place within the&nbsp;party a change of great importance. Hitherto the conservatives,&nbsp;represented by such leaders as Lincoln and Seward, had always&nbsp;won in struggles with the radical elements; but now the tide&nbsp;changed, and the radicals who were more narrowly national and&nbsp;more strongly partisan gained control, and ruled the party to the&nbsp;end of the period. This revolution within the Republican party&nbsp;between the years 1865 and 1867 was fostered by a marked recrudescence of sectional feeling in the North, and by the character&nbsp;of the successor of President Lincoln and of the party leaders in&nbsp;Congress. President Johnson while eminently patriotic and&nbsp;courageous, was tactless and imprudent to the last degree. Mr&nbsp;Sumner, the leader of the Senate, was not conciliatory in manner,&nbsp;and while incapable of revengeful feeling seemed more considerate of the freedman than of the Southern white. Thaddeus&nbsp;Stevens, whose influence over the House of Representatives was&nbsp;stronger than that of Sumner over the Senate, regarded the South&nbsp;as “ a conquered province,” and his personal feelings towards the&nbsp;ruling class of the South were harshly vindictive. The policy&nbsp;adopted by the Republican majority in each house of Congress&nbsp;was to refuse admission to the men chosen by the states that&nbsp;had been reconstructed under the presidential plan, until a joint-committee of both houses should investigate conditions in the&nbsp;South. In this rebuff there was distinct intimation of a purpose&nbsp;to set aside altogether the reconstructive work of the President.&nbsp;Congress proceeded at once to enact measures to continue and&nbsp;extend the earlier temporary provision for helpless freedmen&nbsp;whom emancipation had set adrift, and to give them full&nbsp;civil rights. By passing the Fourteenth Amendment in June&nbsp;1866 Congress committed itself to the policy of securing the&nbsp;civil rights of the negro by constitutional guarantee. Each of&nbsp;these acts was vetoed by the President, between whom and</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
