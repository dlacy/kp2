<p><span class="font2">ROBINSON, John (1575-1625), one of the founders of Independency in England (see vol. xii. p. 725), was born&nbsp;most probably near Scrooby in Nottinghamshire in 1575.&nbsp;He was entered of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, in&nbsp;1592, and graduated in ordinary course, becoming a fellow&nbsp;in 1599. Having taken orders he officiated for some time&nbsp;in the neighbourhood of Norwich, but his Puritan leanings&nbsp;soon caused his suspension by the bishop. After having&nbsp;ministered for some time to a congregation of sympathizers&nbsp;in Norwich he resigned his fellowship in 1604, and, proceeding to Gainsborough in Lincolnshire, he there joined&nbsp;a company who had bound themselves by covenant before&nbsp;God “to walk in all His ways made known or to be made&nbsp;known unto them, according to their best endeavours,&nbsp;whatever it should cost them.” In 1606 he became&nbsp;minister at Scrooby, but the increasing hostility of the&nbsp;authorities towards nonconformity soon forced him and his&nbsp;people to think of flight, and, not without difficulty, they&nbsp;succeeded in making their escape in detachments to Hol-land. Robinson settled in Amsterdam in 1608, but in the&nbsp;following year removed to Leyden, and ministered there to&nbsp;members of his former congregation. In 1620 a considerable minority of these sailed for England in the “ Speed-well,” and ultimately crossed the Atlantic in the “ Mayflower ” ; it was Robinson’s intention to follow as soon as&nbsp;practicable along with the rest of his flock, but he died&nbsp;before the plan could be carried out, on 1st March 1625.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Besides preaching to his congregation, and, during his later years, corresponding with those of his people who had settled in New&nbsp;England, Robinson devoted himself to theological study, and became a member of the university of Leyden. Amongst his other&nbsp;publications may be mentioned </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Justification of Separation from the&nbsp;Church</span><span class="font1"> (1610), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Apologia Brownistarum</span><span class="font1"> (1619), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">A Defence of the&nbsp;Doctrine propounded by the Synod of Dort</span><span class="font1"> (1624), and a volume of&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Essays, or Observations Divine and Moral,</span><span class="font1"> printed in 1628. His&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Works,</span><span class="font1"> with a memoir by R. Ashton, were reprinted in 3 vols,&nbsp;in 1851.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ROBINSON, John Thomas Romney (1792-1882), the inventor of the cup-anemometer, was born in Dublin on&nbsp;23d April 1792. He studied at Trinity College and obtained a fellowship in 1814 ; for some years he was deputy&nbsp;professor of natural philosophy, until he relinquished his&nbsp;fellowship in 1821 on obtaining the college living of&nbsp;Enniskillen. In 1823 he was appointed astronomer of&nbsp;the Armagh observatory (see Observatory), with which&nbsp;he (from 1824) combined the living of Carrickmacross,&nbsp;but he always resided at the observatory, engaged in re-searches connected with astronomy and physics, until his&nbsp;death on 28th February 1882.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Robinson wrote a number of papers in scientific journals and transactions, and the Armagh catalogue of stars (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Places of 5345&nbsp;Stars observed from 1828 to 1854 at the Armagh Observatory,</span><span class="font1"> Dublin,&nbsp;1859), but he is best known as the inventor of the cup-anemometer&nbsp;for registering the velocity of the wind. This instrument (which&nbsp;he erected at the Armagh observatory in 1846 and which has since&nbsp;come into general use) consists of four light arms forming a horizontal cross, carrying four hemispherical cups and turning freely&nbsp;about a vertical axis. By an endless screw attached to the axis a&nbsp;system of wheelwork is set going, and the velocity of the wind is&nbsp;indicated by one or more dials, or it may be registered continuously&nbsp;by a pencil drawn by clockwork along a dial or drum turned by&nbsp;the anemometer, or (as in the modification now generally used) by&nbsp;a metallic screw of only one thread, which leaves a tracing on a sheet&nbsp;of metallic paper folded round a drum revolving by clockwork. It&nbsp;has been found by elaborate experiments by Dr Robinson ( </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Trans.&nbsp;R. Irish Academy,</span><span class="font1"> vol. xxii. ; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Phil. Trans.,</span><span class="font1"> 1878 and 1880) and&nbsp;others that the centre of each cup moves with a velocity very nearly&nbsp;equal to one-third of that of the wind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ROB ROY </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(c.</span><span class="font2"> 1660-1734), the popular designation of a famous Highland outlaw whose prowess is the theme of one&nbsp;of Sir Walter Scott’s novels, was by descent a Macgregor,&nbsp;being the younger son of Donald Macgregor of Glengyle,&nbsp;who had attained the rank of lieutenant-colonel in the&nbsp;army of James II., by his wife, a daughter of William&nbsp;Campbell of Glenfalloch. He received the name Roy from&nbsp;the red hair which clustered in thick curls over his brow,&nbsp;and latterly adopted Campbell as his surname on account&nbsp;of the Acts proscribing the name of his clan. Though&nbsp;in stature not much above the middle height, he was so&nbsp;muscular and thickly set that few were his equals in feats&nbsp;of strength, while the unusual length of his arms gave&nbsp;him an extraordinary advantage in the use of the sword.&nbsp;His eyes were remarkably keen and piercing, and his&nbsp;whole expression indicated a mental prowess forming an&nbsp;appropriate complement to his powerful physical frame.&nbsp;He inherited a small property on the Braes of Balquhidder,&nbsp;and at first devoted himself to the rearing of cattle. Having formed a band of armed clansmen, he obtained, after&nbsp;the accession of William III., a commission from James&nbsp;II. to levy war on all who refused to acknowledge him&nbsp;as king, and in the autumn of 1691 made a descent on&nbsp;Stirlingshire to carry off the cattle of Lord Livingstone,&nbsp;when, being opposed by the villagers of Kippen, he also&nbsp;seized the cattle from all the byres of the village. Shortly&nbsp;afterwards he married Mary, daughter of Macgregor of&nbsp;Comar. On the death of Gregor Macgregor, the chief of&nbsp;the clan, in 1693 he managed, though not the nearest heir,&nbsp;to get himself acknowledged chief, obtaining control of the&nbsp;lands stretching from the Braes of Balquhidder to the&nbsp;shores of Loch Lomond, and situated between the possessions of Argyll and those of Montrose. To assist in carrying on his trade as cattle-dealer he borrowed money from&nbsp;the duke of Montrose, and, being on account of losses unable to repay it, he was in 1712 evicted from his property&nbsp;and declared an outlaw. Taking refuge in the more inaccessible Highlands, Rob Roy from this time forward supported himself chiefly by depredations committed in the&nbsp;most daring manner on the duke and his tenants, all&nbsp;attempts to capture him being unsuccessful. During the&nbsp;rebellion of 1715, though nominally siding with the Pretender, he did not take an active part in the battle of&nbsp;Sheriffmuir except in plundering the dead on both sides.&nbsp;He was included in the Act of Attainder ; but, having for&nbsp;some time enjoyed the friendship of the duke of Arygll,&nbsp;he obtained, on making his submission at Inveraray, a&nbsp;promise of protection. He now established his residence&nbsp;at Craigroyston near Loch Lomond, whence for some time&nbsp;he levied black mail as formerly upon Montrose, escaping&nbsp;by his wonderful address and activity every effort of the&nbsp;English garrison stationed at Inversnaid to bring him to&nbsp;justice. In his later years he was, through the mediation&nbsp;of Argyll, reconciled to Montrose. According to a notice&nbsp;in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Caledonian Mercury</span><span class="font2"> he died at Balquhidder on&nbsp;28th December 1734. He was buried in Balquhidder&nbsp;churchyard.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">ROBUSTI, Jacopo (1518-1594), commonly called Il Tintoretto or Tintoret, one of the greatest painters of&nbsp;the Venetian or of any school, was born in Venice in&nbsp;1518, though most accounts say in 1512. His father,&nbsp;Battista Robusti, was a dyer, or “ tintore ” ; hence the&nbsp;son got the nickname of “ Tintoretto,” little dyer, or&nbsp;dyer’s boy. In childhood Jacopo, a born painter, began&nbsp;daubing on the dyer’s walls ; his father, noticing his bent,&nbsp;took him round, still in boyhood, to the studio of Titian,</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
