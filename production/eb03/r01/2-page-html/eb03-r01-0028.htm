Now, as&nbsp;the fcrew in ratching had continually hold of ſeveral&nbsp;teeth at the ſame time, and, theſe conſtantly changing,&nbsp;the above-mentioned inequalities ſoon corrected them·&nbsp;ſelves, and the teeth were reduced to a perfect equality.&nbsp;The piece of braſs which carries the wire was how taken away, and the cutting ſcrew was alſo removed,&nbsp;and a plain one (hereafter deſcribed) put in its place :&nbsp;on one end of the ſcrew is a fmall braſs circle, having&nbsp;its edge divided into 60 equal parts, and numbered at&nbsp;every ſixth diviſion, as before-mentioned. Οη the other&nbsp;end of </span><span class="font3">the </span><span class="font2">ſcrew is a ratchet-wheel </span><span class="font3">C, </span><span class="font2">having 60 teeth,&nbsp;covered by the hollowed circle (d), which carries two&nbsp;clicks that catch upon the oppoſite ſides of the ratchet&nbsp;when the ſcrew is to be moved forwards. The cylinder S turns on a ſtrong ſteel aιbor F, which paſſes&nbsp;through and is firmly ſcrewed to the piece Y : this&nbsp;piece, for greater firmneſs, is aftached to the ſcrew-frame </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">G </span><span class="font2">by the braces (v) : </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font2">ſpiral groove or thread&nbsp;is cut on the outſide of the cylinder S, which ſerves&nbsp;both for holding the firing, and alſo giving motion to&nbsp;the lever J on its centre by means of a ſteel tooth (n),&nbsp;that works between the threads of the ſpiral. I o the&nbsp;lever is attached a ſtrong ſteel pin(m), on which a&nbsp;braſs ſocket (r) turns : this focket paſſes through a flit&nbsp;in the piece (p), and may be tightened in any part of&nbsp;the flit by the finger-nut (f) : this piece ſerves to regu-late the number of revolutions of the ſcrew for each&nbsp;tread of the treadle R.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot; T is a braſs box containing a ſpiral ſpring ; a ſtrong gut is faſtened and turned tnree or four times&nbsp;round the crrcumference of this box ; the gut then&nbsp;paſſes ſeveral times round the cylinder S, and from&nbsp;thence down to the treadle R. Now, when the treadle&nbsp;is preſſed down, the ſtring pulls the cylinder S round&nbsp;its axis, and the clicks catching hold of the teeth on&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font2">ratchet carry the ſcrew round with it, till, by the&nbsp;tooth (n) working in the ſpiral groove, the lever J is&nbsp;brought near the wheel (d), and the cylinder ſtopped&nbsp;by the ſcrew-head (x) ſtriking ©n the top of the lever&nbsp;J ; at the ſame time the ſpring is wound up by the&nbsp;other end of the gut paſſing round the box T. Now,&nbsp;when the foot is taken off the treadle, the ſpring unbending itſelf pulls back the cylinder, the clicks leaving&nbsp;the ratchet and ſcrew at reſt till the piece (t) ſtrikes on&nbsp;the end of the piece (p) : the number of revolutions&nbsp;of the fcrew at each tread is limited by the number of&nbsp;revolutions the cylinder is allowed to turn back before&nbsp;the ſtop ſtrikes on the piece (p).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“ When the endleſs ſcrew was moved round its axis with a confiderable velocity, it would continue that&nbsp;motion a little after the cylinder S was ſtopped : to</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prevent this, the angular leγer « was made ; that when&nbsp;the lever J comes near to ſtop the ſcrew (x), it, by a&nbsp;ſmall chamfer, preſſes down the piece χ of the angular&nbsp;lever ; this brings the other end ⅛&quot; of the ſame lever&nbsp;forwards, and ſtops the endleſs ſcrew by the ſteel&nbsp;pin μ ſtriking upon the top oſ it : the foot of the lever is raiſed again by a ſmall ſpring preſſing on the&nbsp;biace (v).</span></p>
