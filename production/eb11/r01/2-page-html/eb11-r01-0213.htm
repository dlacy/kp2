<p><span class="font0">REFECTORY (med. Lat. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">refectorium,</span><span class="font0"> from </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">reficere,</span><span class="font0"> to refresh), the hall of a monastery, convent, &amp;c., where the religious took&nbsp;their chief meals together. There frequently was a sort of&nbsp;ambo, approached by steps, from which to read the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">legenda&nbsp;sanctorum,</span><span class="font0"> &amp;c., during meals. The refectory was generally&nbsp;situated by the side of the S. cloister, so as to be removed from&nbsp;the church but contiguous to the kitchen; sometimes it was&nbsp;divided down the centre into two aisles, as at Fountains Abbey&nbsp;in England, Mont St Michel in France and at Villiers in&nbsp;Belgium, and into three aisles as in St Mary’s, York, and the&nbsp;Bernardines, Paris. The refectory of St Martin-des-Champs&nbsp;in Paris is in two aisles, and is now utilized as the library&nbsp;of the École des Arts et Métiers. Its wall pulpit, with an&nbsp;arcaded staircase in the thickness of the wall, is still in perfect&nbsp;preservation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">REFEREE, a person to whom anything is referred ; an arbitrator. The court of referees in England was a court to&nbsp;which the House of Commons committed the decision of all&nbsp;questions as to the right of petitioners to be heard in opposition&nbsp;to private bills. As originally constituted the referees consisted&nbsp;of the chairman of ways and means, and other members, the&nbsp;Speaker’s counsel and several official referees not members of&nbsp;the House of Commons. In 1903 the appointment of official&nbsp;referees was discontinued. The court now consists of the&nbsp;chairman of ways and means, the deputy chairman and not&nbsp;less than seven other members of the House appointed by the&nbsp;Speaker, and its duty, as defined by a standing order, is to decide&nbsp;upon all petitions against private bills, or against provisional&nbsp;orders or provisional certificates, as to the rights of the&nbsp;petitioners to be heard upon such petitions. In the high court&nbsp;of justice, under the Judicature Act 1873, cases may be submitted to three official referees, for trial, inquiry and report, or&nbsp;assessment of damages. Inquiry and report may be directed&nbsp;in any case, trial only by consent of the parties, or in any matter&nbsp;requiring any prolonged examination of documents or accounts,&nbsp;or any scientific or local investigation which cannot be tried in&nbsp;the ordinary way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">REFERENDUM and INITIATIVE, two methods by which the wishes of the general body of electors in a constitutional&nbsp;state may be expressed with regard to proposed legislation.&nbsp;They are developed to the highest extent in Switzerland, and&nbsp;are best exemplified in the Swiss federal and cantonal constitutions. By these two methods the sovereign people in Switzerland&nbsp;(whether in the confederation or in one of its cantons) approve&nbsp;or reject the bills and resolutions agreed upon by the legislative&nbsp;authority (Referendum), or compel that authority to introduce&nbsp;bills on certain specified subjects (Initiative)—in other words,&nbsp;exercise the rights of the people as regards their elected repre-sentatives at times other than general elections. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Referendum&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">means “ that which is referred ” to the sovereign people, and&nbsp;prevailed (up to 1848) in the federal diet, the members of which&nbsp;were bound by instructions, all matters outside which being&nbsp;taken “ ad referendum.” A similar system obtained previously&nbsp;in the formerly independent confederations of the Grisons and&nbsp;of the Valais, in the former case not merely as between the&nbsp;Three Leagues, and even the bailiwicks of each within its&nbsp;respective league, but also (so far as regards the upper Engadine)&nbsp;the communes making up a bailiwick, though in the Valais the&nbsp;plan prevailed only as between the seven </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Zehnten</span><span class="font0"> or bailiwicks.&nbsp;The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Initiative,</span><span class="font0"> on the other hand, is the means by which the&nbsp;sovereign people can compel its elected representatives to take&nbsp;into consideration either some specified object or a draft bill&nbsp;relating thereto, the final result of the deliberations of the&nbsp;legislature being subject by a referendum vote to the approval&nbsp;or rejection of the people. These two institutions therefore&nbsp;enable the sovereign people to control the decisions of the&nbsp;legislature, without having recourse to a dissolution, or waiting&nbsp;for the expiration of its natural term of office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As might have been expected, both had been adopted by different cantons before they found their way into the federal&nbsp;constitution, which naturally has to take account of the sovereign&nbsp;rights of the cantons of which it is composed. Further, they (at&nbsp;any rate the referendum) were employed in the case of constitutional matters relating to cantonal constitutions before being&nbsp;applied to all or certain specified laws and resolutions. Finally,&nbsp;the action of both has been distinctly conservative in the case&nbsp;of the confederation, though to a less marked degree in the case of&nbsp;the cantons.</span></p>
