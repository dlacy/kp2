                <p><label>RICHMOND</label>, the capital of Virginia, U.S.A., the county-seat of
                    Henrico county, and a port of entry, on the James river (at the head of
                    navigation), about 100 m. S. by W. of Washington, D.C., and about 125 m. by
                    water from the Atlantic Ocean. Pop. (1850) 27,570; (i860) 37,910; (1870) 51,038;
                    (1880) 63,600; (1890) 81,388; (1900) 85,050, of whom</p>
               <p>32,230 were negroes and 2865 were foreign-born; (1910 census) 127,628. Richmond
                    is served by the Atlantic Coast Line, the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio, Ihe
                    Seaboard Air Line, The Southern and the Richmond, Fredericksburg &amp;
                    Potomac railways, and by the Old Dominion, the Virginia Navigation and the
                    Chesapeake steamship lines. The city has a beautiful situation on the hilly
                    ground (maximum elevation, about 250 ft. above sea-level) along the north and
                    east banks of the James, at a bend where the river changes its south-easterly
                    course for one almost due south. It occupies seven hills, from which fact it has
                    been called “ the Modern Rome.” The western stretch of the river, opposite the
                    city, breaks into rapids which have a fall of about 116 ft. in 9 m. and provide
                    abundant water power. Belle Isle (the site of a Confederate prison camp during
                    the Civil War), about 1/2m long by about 1/4m wide, is in this part of the
                    river; a little farther down stream are a group of small islets, and opposite
                    the south-eastern boundary of the city is Mayo’s Island. Within the city’s lines
                    the river is crossed by two bridges (to Manchester) for vehicles and
                    pedestrians, and three railway bridges. The river has been improved by Federal
                    engineers since 1870; in June 1909 (up to which time $1,799,033 had been
                    expended for improvements) there was a channel 100 ft. wide and 18 ft. deep,
                    nearly continuously from Hampton Roads to the Richmond wharf, and the maximum
                    draft at low water was 16.1 ft.</p>
               <p>About three-fourths of the city’s total street mileage (120 m.) is paved, Belgian
                    block or macadam being used on the principal thoroughfares. About 637-8 acres
                    are devoted to city parks, among which are William Byrd Park (300 acres), in the
                    western part of the city, Joseph Bryan Park (262-6 acres), Chimborazo Park (29
                    acres), near its eastern boundary, Gambles Hill Park (8-8 acres), Monroe Square
                    (7J acres), Jefferson Park (6.3 acres) and Marshall Square (7 acres). The State
                    Capitol Square (10 acres) is not owned by the city. Half a mile N.W. of the city
                    are the Fair Grounds, where a state fair is held annually.</p>
               <p>Of Richmond’s public buildings, several have great historic interest. St John’s
                    Episcopal church, built in 1740 (and subsequently much enlarged), is noted
                    especially as the meeting-place of the Virginia Convention of March 1775, before
                    which Patrick Henry made a famous speech, ending, “ I know not what course
                    others may take, but as for me, Give me liberty, or give me death!” The Capitol
                    (begun in 1785 and completed in 1792—the wings were added in 1906) was designed
                    from a model and plans of the Maison Carrée, at Nîmes, supplied by Thomas
                    Jefferson, while he was minister to France. Aaron Burr was tried for treason and
                    then for misdemeanour in this building in 1807, the Virginia secession
                    convention met here in 1861, and during the Civil War the sessions of the
                    Confederate Congress were held here. In its rotunda is Jean Antoine Houdon’s
                    full-length marble statue of Washington, provided for by the Virginia General
                    Assembly in 1784, and erected in 1796; its base bears a fine inscription written
                    by James Madison. In a niche is a Houdon bust of Lafayette, a replica of the
                    original presented to the city of Paris by the state of Virginia. The Old Stone
                    House (the oldest building in the city) was erected as a residence in 1737, and
                    is now used for a museum. Masons’ Hall, whose corner-stone was laid in 1785, is
                    said to be the oldest exclusively Masonic building in the United States. The
                    Executive Mansion of the Confederate States of America, built in 1819, purchased
                    by the city in 1862, and leased to the Confederate government and occupied by
                    President Jefferson Davis in 1862-65, was acquired in 1890 by the Confederate
                    Memorial Library Society, and is now a Confederate Museum with a room for each
                    state of the Confederacy and a general library in the “ Solid South ” room; it
                    has valuable historical papers, collected by the Southern Historical Society, and
                    the society has published a <hi rend="italic">Calendar of Confederate
                        Papers</hi> (1908). The former residence of Chief-Justice John Marshall,
                    built in 1795, is still standing; and the Lee-Mansion, which was the war-time
                    residence of General Robert E. Lee’s family, has been occupied, since 1893, by
                    the Virginia Historical Society (organized 1831; reorganized 1847) as the
                    repository of a valuable library and collection of portraits of historical
                    interest. Libby Prison, which stood on the northern bank of a canal, near the
                    river, in the eastern part of the city, was taken down in 1888-89, and its
                    materials removed to Chicago, where it was reconstructed, in as nearly as
                    possible its original form, and became the Libby Prison War Museum. <note
                        anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="1"> As built in Richmond,
                        in 1845 by Luther Libby, it was a brick structure, three storeys high in
                        front and four in the rear. It had six rooms, each about 100X45 ft., was
                        used as a tobacco warehouse and a ship-chandlery until 1861, and then until
                        the capture of Richmond was used as a prison, chiefly for Federal officers.
                        Frequently it was terribly overcrowded (by as many as 1200 prisoners at a
                        time), the inmates often suffered great privations, and many died or were
                        physically disabled for the remainder of their lives. </note> The Valentine
                    Museum is in a house on Eleventh and Clay Streets, in which Aaron Burr was
                    entertained while he was on trial, and which with $50,000 and his collections
                    was devised to a board of trustees in 1892 by Mann S. Valentine. The museum
                    includes 3300 books, many being of the 15th and 16th centuries, a department of
                    engravings, a Virginia Room with portraits and relics, some tapestries, an
                    excellent collection of casts and valuable American archaeological specimens.</p>
               <p>The more modern buildings include the City Hall, a fine granite structure
                    (completed in 1893), with a tower 180 ft. tall; the Library building which
                    houses the state library (about 80,000 volumes, with many portraits and a
                    valuable collection of old manuscripts), the State Law Library and also the
                    offices of most of the state officials; the Post-Office and Customs House; the
                    State Penitentiary; the Chamber of Commerce; and, among the religious edifices,
                    the Sacred Heart Cathedral (Roman Catholic), presented to the city by Mr and Mrs
                    Thomas F. Ryan; the Monumental Church, built on the site of the Richmond
                    Theatre, in the burning of which, in 1811, Acting-Governor George W. Smith and
                    fifty-nine others lost their lives; and St Paul’s Church, where Jefferson Davis
                    was attending services, on the 2nd of April 1865, when he received news from</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r03-0310" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0333.jp2"/>
               <p>General Lee that General Grant had broken through the lines at Petersburg and
                    that Richmond must be evacuated. Rosemary Library was given to the city by
                    Thomas Nelson Page in memory of his wife, who died in 1888.</p>
               <p>Richmond has many fine monuments and statues of historic interest and artistic
                    merit, the most noteworthy of the former being the Washington Monument, in
                    Capitol Square. In 1850 the commission accepted the model submitted by Thomas
                    Crawford (1814-1857), an American sculptor, the corner-stone of the monument was
                    laid in that year, and the equestrian statue of Washington, with sub-statues of
                    Patrick Henry and Thomas Jefferson, was unveiled on the 22nd of February 1858.
                    Thereafter were added sub-statues of Chief-Justice John Marshall and George
                    Mason (1726-1792) by Crawford, and statues of Andrew Lewis (1730-1781) and
                    Thomas Nelson (1738-1789), and six allegorical subjects, by Randolph Rogers
                    (1825-1892), the monument being completed in 1869, at a cost of about $260,000,
                    of which about $47,000 represented private gifts and the interest thereon. The
                    greatest height of the monument is 60 ft., and the diameter of its base is 86
                    ft. In Capitol Square are also a marble statue of Henry Clay, by Joel T. Hart
                    (1810-1877), a bronze statue of Stonewall Jackson, by John Henry Foley
                    (1818-1874), an English sculptor, “presented to the city by English gentlemen ”
                    (Hon. A. J. Beresford-Hope and others) and unveiled in 1875; statue of Hunter
                    Holmes McGuire (1835-1900), a famous Virginia surgeon; and a statue of William
                    Smith (1796-1887), governor of Virginia in 1846-49 and in 1864-65. In Monroe
                    Park is a statue by E. V. Valentine of Brig.-General Williams Carter Wickham
                    (1820-1888) of the Confederate army. Another noteworthy monument is the noble
                    equestrian statue of General Robert E. Lee, surmounting a lofty granite pedestal
                    at the head of Franklin Street. This statue, by Marius Jean Antonin Mercie (b.
                    1845), was unveiled in 1890. Adjacent is an equestrian statue of General J. E.
                    B. Stuart, by Frederick Moynihan, and at the west end of Monument Avenue is the
                    Jefferson Davis Monument, by W. C. Nowland, in front of which is a statue of
                    Jefferson Davis, by E. V. Valentine. On Libby Hill, in the south-eastern part of
                    the city, is a monument to the private soldiers and sailors of the Confederacy.</p>
               <p>In Hollywood Cemetery (dedicated in 1849) are the graves of many famous men,
                    including presidents James Monroe and John Tyler; Jefferson Davis, John Randolph
                    of Roanoke, the Confederate generals, A. P. Hill, J. E. B. Stuart and George E.

                    Secretary of War of the Confederate States in 1862-64; and John R. Thompson
                    (1823-1873), widely known in his day as a poet and as the editor of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Southern Literary Messenger</hi> in 1847-59. Here, too, are
                    buried about 16,000 Confederate soldiers (to whose memory there is a massive
                    pyramid of undressed granite, 40 ft. sq. at the base and 90 ft. high). In the
                    north-eastern part of the city is Oakwood Cemetery, in which are the graves of.
                    about 18,000 Confederate soldiers. Two miles north-east of the city is the
                    National Cemetery, with graves of 6571 Federal soldiers (5700 unknown) most of
                    whom were killed in the actions near Richmond.</p>

                    justice of the peace. The city council is composed of a common council (five
                    members from each ward, elected for two years) and of a board of aldermen (three

                    court. Three justices of the peace are elected from each ward for a term of two
                    years. The city council appoints an attorney for the corporation, a city
                    engineer, a city clerk, a police justice, a board of fire commissioners and a
                    board of police commissioners, one from each ward, who have control of the fire
                    and police departments, respectively, and a number of other officers. The city
                    owns its gas works, water works and an electric-lighting plant (1910) for
                    municipal lighting. The debt limit is set by the city charter at 18% of the
                    assessed value of the taxable real estate of the city. In 1909 the taxable real
                    estate and personal property was valued at $108,663,716, and the city had no
                    floating debt; on the ist of February 1910, there were $10,706,318 worth of
                    bonds outstanding, and the sinking fund was $2,011,857.</p>
               <p>An exploring party from Jamestown, under command of Captain Christopher Newport
                    (c. 1565-1617), and including Captain John Smith, sailed up the James river in
                    1607, and on the 3rd of June erected a cross on one of the small islands
                    opposite the site of the present city. The first permanent settlement within the
                    present limits of the city was made in 1609 in the district long known as
                    Rockett’s. Later in the same year Captain Smith bought from the Indians a tract
                    of land on the east bank of the river, about 3 m. below this settlement, and
                    near the site of the present Powhatan. This tract he named “ Nonesuch,” and here
                    he attempted to establish a small body of soldiers who had occupied a less
                    favourable site in the vicinity; but they objected to the change and, being
                    attacked by the Indians, sought the protection of Smith, who made prisoners of
                    their leaders, with the result, apparently, that the settlement was abandoned.
                    In 1645 Fort Charles was erected at the falls of the James as a frontier
                    defence. In 1676, during “ Bacon’s Rebellion,” a party of Virginians under
                    Bacon’s command killed about 150 Indians who were defending a fort on a hill a
                    short distance east of the site of Richmond in the “ Battle of Bloody Run,” so
                    called because the blood of the slain savages is said to have coloured the brook
                    (or “ run ”) at the base of the hill. Colonel William Byrd, <note

                        ancestors, the Steggs, were conspicuous in the early history of Virginia.
                        The first of the family was Thomas Stegg (or Stegge) (d. 1651), born in
                        England, who became an Indian trader on the James river as early as 1637,
                        and had his home near what is now the village of Westover, Charles City
                        county. He left his estate to his son Thomas (d. 1670), who settled at the
                        falls of the James in 1661, and was auditor-general in 1664-1670. He was
                        succeeded by his nephew, William Byrd (1652-1704.), who was born in London,
                        went to Virginia about 1670, became a successful Indian trader, was a member
                        of the House of Burgesses in 1677-1682, was a supporter of Nathaniel Bacon

                    found there the town of Richmond, at the same time selecting and naming the
                    present site of Petersburg. The name Richmond was suggested probably by the
                    similarity of the site to that of Richmond on the Thames. The settlement was
                    laid out in April 1737 by Major William Mayo <hi rend="italic">(c.</hi>
                    1685-1744), and was incorporated as a town in 1742. The public records of the
                    state were removed thither in 1777 from Williamsburg, and in May 1779 Richmond
                    was made the capital. On the 5th of January 1781 the town was partly burned by a
                    force of about 800 British troops under Gen. Benedict Arnold, the 200 or 300
                    Virginians offering little resistance, and much of the damage being done by
                    Lieutenant-Colonel John G. Simcoe’s celebrated Rangers. Richmond was first
                    chartered as a city in 1782, and in 1788 it was allowed a representative in the
                    House of Delegates.</p>
               <p>The importance of Richmond during the Civil War was principally due to its
                    having been made the capital of the Confederate States (by act of the
                    Provisional Government on the 8th of May 1861). Its nearness to Washington, the
                    material and manufacturing resources concentrated in it, and the moral
                    importance attached to its possession by both sides, caused it to be regarded as
                    the centre of gravity of the military operations in the east to which the
                    greatest leaders and the finest armies were devoted from 1861 to 1865. (See <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">American Civil War.)</hi> The city’s system of defences,
                    which began to take form in May 1861, included a line of 17 heavy batteries,
                    completely encircling it at an average distance of about <hi rend="italic"
                        >2</hi> m.; another line of smaller batteries and trenches, from about a
                    mile (or less) to about 2 m. beyond the heavy batteries and practically unbroken
                    from the north bank of the James (west of the city) to about 1 m. west of that
                    river (south of the city); and the outer works, approximately paralleling the
                    inner line, at distances of from 2 to 3 m. from this line north and east of the
                    city. There was much confusion and lawlessness in Richmond during the earlier
                    stages of the war. The city’s police force was unable to cope with the situation
                    created by the influx of soldiers, gamblers and adventurers, and on the 1st of
                    March 1862 President Davis (by Authority of a secret Act of the Confederate
                    Congress passed on the 2nd of February) declared martial law in the city and the
                    country within a radius of 10 m., suspended the writ of <hi rend="italic">habeas
                        corpus,</hi> and appointed General John H. Winder (1800-1865) to enforce
                    military rule. General Winder’s arbitrary exercise of his power was, however,
                    resented so vigorously by the citizens that on the 19th of April the Confederate
                    Congress materially modified the law under which he received these powers from
                    the president. The opening of M'Clellan's Peninsula Campaign (see <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Yorktown; Seven Days, &amp;c.)</hi> in 1862 caused
                    great apprehension in Richmond, and in May 1862 some of the government records
                    were packed up and preparations made to ship them to a place of safety. The
                    approach of the " Monitor ” and the Union gunboats up the James river caused a
                    partial and temporary panic; President Davis appointed a day for prayer, and the
                    families of some of the cabinet secretaries and many citizens fled the city
                    precipitately; but confidence, restored by</p>
               <p>“ Bacon’s Rebellion,” was auditor-general of the colony from 1687 until his
                    death, and was a member of the committee which founded the College of William
                    and Mary. His residence, within the limits of the present city of Richmond, was
                    preserved until about 1850. His son William (1674-1744), the founder of
                    Richmond—and above referred to—was educated in England; returned to Virginia in
                    1696; succeeded his father as auditor-general of the colony, and was
                    receiver-general in 1705-1716. In 1727 he was appointed one
                    of the commission (of which William Fitzwilliams and William Dandridge were the
                    other members) to mark the boundary between North Carolina and Virginia,
                    concerning which undertaking he wrote (probably in 1737) <hi rend="italic">The

                    style as a writer, Professor Bassett says: “ It would behard to find before
                    Franklin a better master of the art of writing clear, forceful and charming
                    English.”</p>
               <p>the checking of the fleet at Drewry’s Bluff (Fort Darling), about 8 m. below the
                    city, on the 15th of May 1862, was increased by the battle of Fair Oaks and the
                    Seven Days, after which the Army of the Potomac retreated. Unsuccessful attempts
                    were made in February and March 1864 to free the Federal prisoners in Richmond
                    by means of cavalry raids. The most important of these was that of General H.
                    Judson Kilpatrick, a portion of whose force, under Col. Ulric Dahlgren (b.
                    1842), was annihilated, Dahlgren being killed (2nd March).</p>
               <p>General U. S. Grant began the final campaign against Richmond in May 1864 (see
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Wilderness</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Petersburg).</hi> Sheridan’s cavalry, during the “ Richmond Raid,” carried
                    the city’s outer defences (May 12), but found the river line too strong to be
                    taken by assault and moved away. In June Grant’s army crossed the James and
                    attacked Lee in Petersburg. Then followed many months of unintermittcnt pressure
                    upon both Petersburg and Richmond. General Benjamin F. Butler captured the
                    southern outer line of the Richmond defences on the 29th of September 1864. On
                    the 2nd of April 1865 Petersburg fell. Richmond was evacuated that night, after
                    the ironclads, the bridges and many of the military and tobacco store-houses had
                    been set on fire by order of General R. S. Ewell, so that when the Federal
                    troops, under General Godfrey Weitzel (1835-1884) entered the city on the
                    following morning (3rd April) a serious conflagration was under way, which was
                    not extinguished until about one-third of the city, including several of its
                    historic buildings, had been destroyed. During the war the principal iron
                    foundry of the Confederacy (Tredegar Iron Works) was in Richmond, and here most
                    of the cannon used by the Confederate armies were cast. In 1910 the city of
                    Manchester was annexed.</p>
