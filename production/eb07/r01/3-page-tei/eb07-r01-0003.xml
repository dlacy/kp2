Rabelais’ judgment, it is certain, was quite as powerful as his wit ; and he knew too well when to discharge his bolt with effect, ever to let it fly where detriment to the archer himself could alone be the result. The veil of extravagance, which he has thrown over his great satirical work, is the best possible proof how unlikely he was to be guilty of any such piece of superfluous imprudence. At the same time, it is to be remarked further, in confutation of this particular Story, that it was to Clement VIL and not to Paul III., that Du Bellay must have been introduced in the capacity of ambassador on the occasion alluded to ; but, as invention and historical truth are two distinct things, this discrepancy in fact is not greatly to be wondered at.</p><p>Rabelais seems to have gone back to Lyons fora time, as his Epistle Dedicatory to Du Bellay of his edition of Marhanfs <hi rend="italic">Antiquitates Romœ Antiquœ</hi>  is dated from that city on the 3lst of August 1534. He returned shortly afterwards to Rome, and rejoined Du Bellay, who had been created Cardinal on the 21st of May 1535. His letters to Godefroy D’Estissac, whose favour he had won during his residence at his Abbey of Maillezais, and continued ever afterwards to retain, are dated from Rome during the two following years. Availing himself of the opportunity which his presence on the spot afforded, he petitioned Pope Paul III. to be absolved from the penalties incurred by the abandonment of his order. Rabelais’ merits had secured him the esteem of Cardinals de Genutiis and Simonetta, and they combined with Du Bellay and the Bishop of Mascon, in forwarding his petition. By their exertions a bull in his favour was obtained gratis, contrary to the usual practice. It was granted on the 17th of January 1536, in terms of his request, allowing him to return into any house of the Benedictine order that would receive him, and to practise physic upon condition of his doing so without hope of fee or reward. This release from the ecclesiastical disabilities consequent upon his transgression of the church’s rules enabled the Cardinal Du Bellay to assign him a place in his Abbey of St. Maur des Fossez, near Paris. Here he remained until the year 1542, when he was appointed by the same friend to the cure of Meu-don ; and he continued in the zealous discharge of the duties of this station down to the time of his death. “Ever mindful,” says Niceron, “ to instruct his people, he made it part of his care to give their children a knowledge of church music, of which he was himself a thorough master. His house was ever open to the poor and wretched, whom he assisted to the utmost of his means ; and he was in the habit of drawing men of learning and science about him, to discourse with them upon their several pursuits. Against women, however, his gates were barred, and his reputation on this score is wholly without blemish. This,” he adds, “ is the uniform testimony of contemporary biographers ; and Antony Le Roi, who wrote a life of him in 1649, avers that such was then the prevailing tradition at Meudon. His knowledge of medicine rendered him doubly useful to his parishioners, who invariably found him ready to minister to their wants both corporal and spiritual.” He died in Paris, in 1553, in the Rue des Jardins, parish of St. Paul, and was buried in the cemetery of that church.</p><p>His death-bed has not escaped profanation by the caterers for the jest-books ; and there are few stories more common, than his calling for his domino, when he felt his end approaching, with the words, “ Beati qui in Domino moriuntur.” Another anecdote, even more detrimental to his character, is in every-day circulation, by which he is reported to have replied to a page sent by Du Bellay to inquire after his health, “ Tell your master the state you find me in ; I am going in quest of a Great Perhaps. He is up in the jay’s nest· Bid him keep where he is ; and for you, you will never be anything but a fool. Draw the curtain ; the farce is ended.” Those who have read Rabelais’ spirit aright need no confutation of this slanderous fabrication of monkish malice, the miserable patchwork from some half-dozen threadbare facetiæ. The simple fact recorded by Du Verdier, is worth a thousand such tales ; and it determines, if, indeed, such evidence were necessary, Rabelais’ opinion as to the momentous doctrine which he is here represented to have viewed as no more than “a great perhaps." In a copy of Galen, annotated throughout in the handwriting of Rabelais, that had come into the Bishop of Evreux's possession, opposite a passage in which Galen argues for the mortality of the soul, Rabelais had wτitten, “ Hic vero Galenus se plumbeum ostendit.” Du Vertlier also states, whilst at the same time he retracts what he had formerly been led, in accordance with the popular voice, to say against Rabelais in his <hi rend="italic">Bibliothèque Française,</hi>  that “ the manner of his death compels us to form a judgment of him totally at variance with that which is currently received.” The particular circumstances of this event are not now known, but they were doubtless such as became a pious and eminently thoughtful man.</p><p>One cannot help regretting, with Coleridge, “ that no friend of Rabelais, and surely friend he must have had, has left an account of him.” Had any such account existed, it would unquestionably have conveyed an impression of his personal character very different from that which the current anecdotes of him are calculated to produce. It is the peculiar misfortune of distinguished humourists to have the paternity of such jests as are tossing unclaimed about the world laid to their charge. They become a sort of Foundling Hospitals for Wit ; and Rabelais has had more than his share of this abandoned progeny thrust upon him. His reputation as a man has suffered accordingly, and this for an obvious reason ; for just in the degree that a great man’s mind is marked by features, which puzzle the finest sagacity to discriminate and reconcile, are people disposed to pronounce an authoritative judgment regarding him. In all such cases, a lively anecdote, or sparkling witticism, is too cheap and pleasant a method of settling a doubtful character, not to be generally adopted. They commonly fall in with the conclusion that lies nearest the surface, and, being thus most easily come at, they are eagerly caught up and borne along from mouth to mouth, till their mere repetition sanctifies the delusion out of which they sprung. One common character runs throughout all the anecdotes of which Rabelais is the hero. They show a mind without gravity or depth, giving head to its most wayward sallies, neglectful of self-respect, and reckless of present circumstances, or of possible results. Such is just the character which a superficial observer is likely to form of him from his own romance. The rhodomantade, the coarseness, the downright nonsense, the reckless exuberance of humour, are easily noted ; whilst the vein of deep and earnest thought that ever and anon shows itself amid the surrounding extravagance, the infinite good sense, the high-toned and enlightened philanthropy, and the great moral purpose which the author had in view, escape the careless and unpenetrating eye. The vices, which he has laid bare with such masterly tact, have been set down as his own, and he is charged with having been a profligate, a debauchee, and a buffoon, destitute alike of self-respect, and reverence for whatsoever is sacred or noble. But every thing that is known of his life, as well as what may be inferred from a study of his works, goes to discountenance such a conclusion, He was beloved and respected by many of the most illustrious and virtuous prelates of his time, admitted into their most private councils, and charged with the most important trusts. All his works, except his romance, which, being a reflection of the time, must needs carry its grossness and licentiousness upon its front, are conceived in a uniformly grave and learned spirit; and in</p></body></text></TEI>
