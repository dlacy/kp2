                    finally negotiations were broken off on February 5th.@@<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>Japan
                    had already on the 4th decided to use force, and her&nbsp;military and naval
                    preparations, unlike those of Russia, kept&nbsp;pace with her
                diplomacy.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font0">This was in fact an eventuality which had been foreseen and on
                    which the naval and military policy of Japan had been based&nbsp;for ten years.
                    She too had her projects of expansion and&nbsp;hegemony, and by the
                    Chino-Japanese War she had gained&nbsp;a start over her rival. The reply of the
                    Western powers was first&nbsp;to compel the victor to maintain the territorial
                    integrity of China,&nbsp;and then within two years to establish themselves in
                    Chinese&nbsp;harbours. From that moment Japanese policy was
                    directed&nbsp;towards establishing her own hegemony and meeting the
                    advance&nbsp;of Russia with a </span><span class="font0"
                    style="font-style:italic;">fait accompli.</span><span class="font0"> But her
                    armaments were not&nbsp;then adequate to give effect to a strong«handed policy,
                    so that&nbsp;for some years thereafter the government had both to
                    impose&nbsp;heavy burdens on the people and to pursue a foreign policy
                    of&nbsp;marking time, and endured the fiercest criticism on both
                    counts,&nbsp;for the idea of war with Russia was as popular as the
                    taxes&nbsp;necessary to that object were detested. But as the army and&nbsp;the
                    navy grew year by year, the tone of Japanese policy became&nbsp;firmer. In 1902
                    her position was strengthened by the alliance&nbsp;with England; in 1903 her
                    army, though in the event it proved&nbsp;almost too small, was considered by the
                    military authorities as&nbsp;sufficiently numerous and well prepared, and the
                    arguments&nbsp;of the Japanese diplomatists stiffened with menaces.
                    Russia,&nbsp;on the other hand, was divided in policy and consequently
                    in&nbsp;military intentions and preparations. In some quarters the&nbsp;force of
                    the new Japanese army was well understood, and&nbsp;the estimates of the balance
                    of military power formed by the&nbsp;minister of war, Kuropatkin, coincided so
                    remarkably with the&nbsp;facts that at the end of the summer of 1903 he saw
                    that&nbsp;the moment had come when the preponderance was on the side&nbsp;of the
                    Japanese. He therefore proposed to abandon Russian&nbsp;projects in southern
                    Manchuria and the Port Arthur region and&nbsp;to restore Port Arthur to China in
                    return for considerable concessions on the side of Vladivostok. His plan was
                    accepted,&nbsp;but “ a lateral influence suddenly made itself felt, and the
                    completely unexpected result was war.” Large commercial interests&nbsp;were in
                    fact involved in the forward policy,“ the period of heavy&nbsp;capital
                    expenditure was over, that of profits about to commence,”&nbsp;and the power and
                    intentions of Japan were ignored or misunderstood. Further, Dragomirov, a higher
                    military authority&nbsp;even than Kuropatkin, declared that “ Far Eastern
                    affairs&nbsp;were decided in Europe.” Thus Russia entered upon the war&nbsp;both
                    unprepared in a military sense, and almost entirely indifferent to its causes
                    and its objects. To the guards and patrols&nbsp;of the Manchurian railway and
                    the garrisons of Port Arthur&nbsp;and Vladivostok, 80,000 in all, Japan could,
                    in consequence&nbsp;of her recruiting law of 1896, oppose a first-line army of
                    some&nbsp;270,000 trained men. Behind these, however, there were&nbsp;scarcely
                    200,000 trained men of the older classes, and at the&nbsp;other end of the long
                    Trans-Siberian railway Russia had almost&nbsp;limitless resources.@@<sup>2</sup>
                    The strategical problem for Japan was, how&nbsp;to strike a blow sufficiently
                    decisive to secure her object, before&nbsp;the at present insignificant forces
                    of the East Siberian army&nbsp;were augmented to the point of being
                    unassailable. It turned,&nbsp;therefore, principally upon the efficiency of the
                    Trans-Siberian railway and in calculating this the Japanese made a serious
                    underestimate. In consequence, far from applying the “ universal&nbsp;service ”
                    principle to its full extent, they trained only one-fifth of the annual
                    contingent of men found fit for service.&nbsp;The quality of the army, thus
                    composed of picked men (a point&nbsp;which is often forgotten), approximated to
                    that of a professional&nbsp;force; but this policy had the result that, as there
                    was no adequate&nbsp;second-line army, parts of the first-line had to be
                    reserved,&nbsp;instead of being employed at the front. And when for want&nbsp;of
                    these active troops the first great victory proved
            indecisive,</span></p></div><br clear="all" />
        <p><span class="font0">half-trained elements had to be sent to the front in considerable
                numbers—indeed the ration strength of the army was actually&nbsp;trebled. The aim of
                the war, <sup>u</sup> limited ” in so far that the&nbsp;Japanese never deluded
                themselves with dreams of attacking&nbsp;Russia at home, was to win such victories
                as would establish&nbsp;the integrity of Japan herself and place her hegemony in
                the&nbsp;Far East beyond challenge. Now the integrity of&nbsp;Japan was worth little
                if the Russians could hope&nbsp;ultimately to invade her in superior force, and
                as&nbsp;Port Arthur was the station of the fleet that might&nbsp;convoy an invasion,
                as. well as the symbol of the&nbsp;longed-for hegemony, the fortress was necessarily
                the army’s&nbsp;first objective, a convincing Sedan was the next. For the
                navy,&nbsp;which had materially only a narrow margin of superiority over&nbsp;the
                Russian Pacific Squadron, the object was to keep the two&nbsp;halves of that
                squadron, at Port Arthur and Vladivostok respectively, separate and to destroy them
                in detail. But in February&nbsp;weather these objects could not be pursued
                simultaneously. Prior&nbsp;to the break-up of the ice, the army could only disembark
                at&nbsp;Chemulpo, far from the objective, or at Dalny under the very&nbsp;eyes of
                its defenders. The army could therefore, for the moment,&nbsp;only occupy Korea and
                try to draw upon itself hostile forces that&nbsp;would otherwise be available to
                assist Port Arthur when the&nbsp;land attack opened. For the navy, instant action
                was imperative.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">On the 8th of February the main battle-fleet, commanded by
                Vice-Admiral Togo, was on the way to Port Arthur. During the&nbsp;night his
                torpedo-boats surprised the Russian squadron in&nbsp;harbour and inflicted serious
                losses, and later in the day the&nbsp;battleships engaged the coast batteries.
                Repulsed in this&nbsp;attempt, the Japanese established a stringent
                blockade,&nbsp;which tried the endurance of the ships and the men to&nbsp;the
                utmost. From time to time the torpedo-craft tried to&nbsp;run in p&amp;st the
                batteries, several attempts were made to&nbsp;block the harbour entrance by sinking
                vessels in the fairway, and free and deadly use was. made by both sides
                of&nbsp;submarine mines. But, though not destroyed, the Port&nbsp;Arthur squadron
                was paralysed by the instantaneous assertion&nbsp;of naval superiority.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">Admiral Alexeiev, the tsar’s viceroy in the Far East and the evil
                genius of the war, was at Port Arthur and forbade the navy&nbsp;to take the risks of
                proceeding to sea.@@<sup>3</sup> For a time, when in&nbsp;place of Admiral Starck
                (who was held responsible for the surprise of February), Admiral Makfirov, an
                officer of European&nbsp;reputation, commanded the fleet, this lethargy was shaken
                off.&nbsp;The new commander took his ships to sea every day. But&nbsp;his energetic
                leadership was soon ended by a tragedy. A field&nbsp;of electro-mechanical mines was
                laid by the Japanese&nbsp;in the night of April 12th-i3th, and on the
                following&nbsp;day the Japanese cruisers stood inshore* to tempt&nbsp;the enemy on
                to the mine-field. Makarov, however, crossed&nbsp;it without accident, and pursued
                the cruisers until Togo’s&nbsp;battle-fleet appeared, whereupon he went about and
                steamed&nbsp;for port. In doing so he recrossed the mine-field, and this
                time&nbsp;the mines .were effectual. The flagship “ Petropavlovsk ” was&nbsp;struck
                and *went down with the admiral and 600 men, and&nbsp;another battleship was
                seriously injured. Then the advocates of&nbsp;passivity regained the upper hand and
                kept the squadron in&nbsp;harbour, and henceforward for many months the Japanese
                navy&nbsp;lay unchallenged off Port Arthur, engaging in minor
                operations,&nbsp;covering the transport of troops to the mainland, and
                watching&nbsp;for the moment when the advance of the army should force&nbsp;the
                Russian fleet to come out. Meantime seven Japanese&nbsp;cruisers under Vice-Admiral
                Kaimamura went in search of the&nbsp;Russian Vladivostok squadron; this, however,
                evaded them for&nbsp;some months, and^ inflicted some damage on the
                Japanese&nbsp;mercantile marine and transports. The Japanese had not&nbsp;waited to
                gain command of the sea before beginning the sea&nbsp;transport of that part of
                their troops allotted to Korea. The&nbsp;roads of that country were so poor that the
