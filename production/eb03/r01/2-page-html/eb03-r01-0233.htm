<p><span class="font2">army of ſatyrs have been only a race of mountaineers, whom Rama, if ſuch a monarch ever exiſted, had civilized ? However that may be, the large breed of Indian&nbsp;apes is at this moment held in high veneration by tlie&nbsp;Hindoos, and fed with devotion by the Brahmans, who&nbsp;ſeent in two or three places on the banks of the Ganges to have a regular endowment for the ſupport of&nbsp;them : they live in tribes of three or four hundred, are&nbsp;wonderfully gentle (I ſpeak as an eye-witneſs), and ap-pear to have fome kind of order and ſubordination in&nbsp;their little ſylvan polity.” The feſtival of Rhama is held&nbsp;on the 9th day of the new moon of Chaitra, on which&nbsp;the war of Lauca is dramatically repreſented, conclu-ding with an exhibition of the fire ordeal, by which the&nbsp;victor’s wife Sita gave proof of her connubial fidelity.&nbsp;Among the Hindoos there are a variety of very fine&nbsp;dramas of great antiquity ®n the ſtory of Rhama.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There are three Rhamas mentioned in the Indian mythology, who, together with Criſhna, the darling&nbsp;god of the Indian women, are defcribed as youths of&nbsp;perfect beauty. The third Rhama is Criſhna’s elder&nbsp;brother, and is conſidered as the eighth Avatar @@(b), in-veſted with an emanation of his divine radiance. Like&nbsp;all the Avatars, Rhama is painted with gemmed Ethi-opian or Parthian coronets ; with rays encircling his&nbsp;head, jewels in his ears, two necklaces, oae ſtraight and&nbsp;one pendant on his boſom, with dropping gems ; garlands of well-diſpofed many-coloured flowers, or collars&nbsp;of pearls, hanging down below his waiſt ; looſe mantles of golden tiffue or dyed ſſlk, embroidered on the&nbsp;hems with flowérs elegantly thrown over one ſhoulder,&nbsp;and folded like ribbands acloſs the breaſt ; with bracelets, two on one arm and on each wriſt : all the Avatars&nbsp;are naked to the waiſſs, and uniformly with dark azure&nbsp;fleſh, in alluſion probably to the tint of that primordial&nbsp;fluid on which Narayan moved in the beginning of time ;&nbsp;but their ſkirts are bright yellow, the colour of the&nbsp;curious pericarpium in the centre of the water-lily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RHAMNUS, the buckthorn, in botany : A genus of the monogynia order, belonging to the pentan-dria claſs of plants ; and in the natural method ranking under the 43d order, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Dumofœ.</span><span class="font2"> The calyx is tubulous,&nbsp;with five minute ſcales ſurrounding the ſtamina ; there&nbsp;is no corolla ; the fruit is a berry. There are 27 ſpe-cies ; of which the moſt remarkable are,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">I. </span><span class="font2">The catharticus, or common purging buckthorn, growing naturally in ſome parts of Britain. This glows&nbsp;to the height of. 12 or 14 feet, with many irregular&nbsp;branches at the extremities. The leaves are oval-lan-ceolate, finely ſerrated on the edges, their nerves con-verging together. The flowers grow in cluſters, one&nbsp;on each footſtalk, white, and in this ſpecies divided into four ſegments : the fruit is a round black berry,&nbsp;containing four feeds. The juice of the berries is a</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font2">ſtrong purgative, and is made ufe of for making the common ſyrup of buckthorn kept in the ſhops. The&nbsp;bark is emetic : the juice of the unripe berries with&nbsp;alum dyes yellow, of the ripe ones a ſine green ; the&nbsp;bark alſo dyes yellow. The green colour yielded by&nbsp;the berries, called by the French </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">verde-vefjie,</span><span class="font2"> is much&nbsp;eſteemed by miniature painters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Of this ſpecies there are two varieties, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">viz.</span><span class="font2"> the dwarf buckthorn, a ſhrub of about a yard high, of a greeniſh&nbsp;colour but little ſhow; and the long-leaved dwarf buck-thorn, which is a larger ſhrub, with leaves fomewhat&nbsp;larger, but in other reſpects very ſimilar to tlie dwarf&nbsp;buckthorn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The zizyphus is the ſpecies in which the lac in-ſect* forms its cells, and produces the wax callecl </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">gum-lac.</span><span class="font2"> See Lacca.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lotus has the leaves, prickles, flowers, and&nbsp;fruit, of the zizyphus or jubeb ; only with this difference, that the fruit is here round, ſmaller, and more&nbsp;lufeious, and at the ſame time the branches, like thofe&nbsp;of the paliurus, are neither ſo much jointed nor crook-ed. Ί he fruit is in great repute, taſtes ſomething like&nbsp;gingerbread, and is fold in the markets all over the&nbsp;ſouthern diſtricts of theſe kingdoms. The Arabs call&nbsp;it </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">aneb enta el feedra,</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">the jubeb of the feedra ;</span><span class="font2"> which&nbsp;Olavus Celſius had ſo high an opinion of, that he has&nbsp;deſcribed it as the dudaim of the ſcriptures. This ſpe-cies is very common in the Jereede and other parts of&nbsp;Bombay ; and has been ſuppoſed by ſome to be the&nbsp;ſame plant with that celebrated by Homer for its en-chanting property; though the latter is more generally&nbsp;ſuppoſed to have been a ſpecies of Diospyros (which&nbsp;ſee). It is proper, however, to diſtinguiſh between&nbsp;both theſe ſhrubs and an herb often mentioned by the&nbsp;ancients under the name of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">lotus,</span><span class="font2"> which Homer men-tions as being fed upon by the horſes of Achilles, and&nbsp;Virgil as proper to increafe the milk of ſheep (ſee Lotus). They are alſo different from the Egyptian lo«&nbsp;tus deſcribed by Herodotus; ſor which ſee Nym-</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PHÆA.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frangula, or berry-bearing alder, is a deciduous ſhrub, a native of England and moſt of the north-era parts of Europe, and affords ſeveral varieties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Alpine, rough-leaved frangula, or berrybearing alder, is alſo a deciduous ſhrub, and native of&nbsp;the Alps. It differs in no reſpect from the common&nbsp;fort, except that it has no thorns, and that it will grow&nbsp;to be rather taller, with tough, large, and doubly laci-niated leaves. The ſmooth-leaved Alpine frangula is a&nbsp;variety of this ſpecies, with ſmooth leaves and of a&nbsp;lower growth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The paliurus, or thorn of Chriſt, is a deciduous&nbsp;ſhrub or tree, a native of Paleſtine, Spain, Portugal,&nbsp;and Italy. It will grow to nearly the height of 14,</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>

The three ſirſt of theſe defcents re· late to ſome ſtupendous convulſion of our globe from the fountains of the deep, and the fourth exhibits the miraculous puniſhment of pride and impiety, appearing to refer to the deluge. Three of the others were ordaiued&nbsp;for the overthrow of tyrants or giants. Of theſe Avatars we have mentioned in the text, that Rhama is the&nbsp;eighth ; Buddha, who appears to have been a reformer of the doctrines contained in Vedas, is the ninth : the&nbsp;tenth Avatar, we are told, is yet to come, and is expected to appear mounted (like the crowned conqueror in&nbsp;the Apocalypſe) on a white horſe, with a ſcimeter blazing like a comet to mow down all ^corrigible and impe·»&nbsp;ſutent offenders who ſhall then be on the earth.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
