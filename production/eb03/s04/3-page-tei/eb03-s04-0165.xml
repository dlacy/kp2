This bag sends off tubular membranaceous ducts, which, in like manner, nearly fill theſe ſemicircular canals. A third department of the nerve is ſpread over the external surface of another membranaceous bag, which lies between the one juſt now mentioned and the cochlea, but haying no communication with either, almoſt completely filling the remainder of the vestibule. Thus the veſtibule and canals ſeem only a cafe for protecting this ſensitive membranaceous veſſel, which is almoſt, but not altogether, in contact with the oſſeous cafe, being ſeparated by a delicate and almoſt fluid cellular ſubſtance. The fibrillous expanſion of the nerve is not indiſcriminately diffuſed over the ſurface of theſe sacculi, but evidently directed to certain foci, where the fibres are conſtipated. And this is the laſt appearance of the fibrous ſtate of the nerve; for when the inſide of theſe ſacculi is inſpected, no fibres appear, but a pulp (judged to be nervous from its ſimilarity to other pulpy productions of the brain) adhering to the membranaceous coat, and not ſeparable from it by gently washing it. It is more abundant, that is, of greater thickneſs, oppoſite to the external fibrous foci. No organical ſtructure could be diſcovered in this pulp, but it probably is organiſed ; for, beſides this adhering pulp, the water in the ſacculi was obſerved to be clammy or mucous ; ſo that in all probability the vascular or fibrous ſtate of the nerve is ſucceeded by an uninterrupted production (perhaps columnar like basalt, though not cohering); and this at laſt ends in ſimple diſſemination, ſymmetrical however, where water and nerve are alternate in every direction.</p><p>To theſe obſervations of Scarpa, Comparetti adds the curious circumſtances of another and regular tympanum in the foramen rotundum, the cylindric cavity of which is incloſed at both ends by a fine membrane. The membrane which ſeparates it from the cochlea appears to be in a ſtate of variable tenſion, being drawn up to an umbo by a cartilaginous speck in its middle, which he thinks adheres to the lamina ſpiralis, and thus ſerves to ſtrain the drumhead, as the malleus ſtrains the great membrane known to all.</p><p>Theſe are moſt important obſervations, and muſt greatly excite the curiosity of a truly philoſophical mind, and deserve the moſt careful inquiry into their juſtneſs. If theſe are accurate deſcriptions of the organ, they ſeem to conduct us farther into the ſecrets of nature than any thing yet known.</p><p>We think that they promiſe to give us the greateſt step yet made in phyſiology, viz. to ſhow us the laſt mechanical fact which occurs in the long train interpoſed between the external body and the incitement of  our ſensitive ſyſtem. But there is, as yet, great and eſſential differences in the deſcription given by thoſe celebrated naturaliſts. It cannot be otherwiſe. The containing labyrinth can be laid open to our view in no other way than by deſtroying it ; and its moſt delicate contents are the firſt ſufferers in the ſearch. They are found in very different ſituations and conditions by different anatomiſts, according to their addreſs or their good fortune. Add to this, that the natural varieties are very conſiderable. Faithful deſcriptions muſt therefore give very different notions of the ultimate action</p><p>and reaction between the unorganiſed matter in the labyrinth and the ultimate expanſion of the auditory nerve.</p><p>We muſt therefore wait with patience. Since this  work of ours was begun, the progreſs which has been made in many parts of natural ſcience has been great and wonderful ; and perhaps before it be completed, we may be furniſhed with ſuch a collection of facts respecting the ſtructure and the contents of the organ of hearing, as might enable us to give a juſter theory of sound than is yet to be found in the writings of philoſophers. There ſeems to be no abatement of ardour in the reſearches of the phyſiologiſts; and they will not remain long ignorant of the truth or miſtake in the accounts given by Scarpa and Comparetti. Should the reſult of their inquiries be what we expect, we ſhould be glad of a proper opportunity of laying it before our readers, together with ſome diſquiſition on the nature of hearing. A collection of accurate obſervations on the ſtructure of the ear would give us principles on which to proceed in explaining the various methods of producing external sounds. The nature of <hi rend="italic">continued sounds </hi>might then be treated of, and would appear, we believe, very different from what it is commonly ſuppoſed. Under this head animal voices might be particularly conſidered, and the elements of human ſpeech. properly aſcertained. When the production of continued sounds is once ſhown to be a thing regulated by principle, it may be ſyſtematically treated, and this principle may be conſidered as combined with every mechanical ſtate of body that may be pointed out. This will ſuggeſt to us methods of producing ſound which have not yet been thought of, and may therefore give us sounds with which we are unacquainted. Such an acquiſition is not to be deſpiſed nor rejected. The bountiful Author of our being and of all our faculties has made it an object of most enchanting reliſh to the human mind. The Greeks, the moſt cultivated people who have ever figured on the ſtage of life, enjoyed the pleaſures of music with rapture. Even the poor negro, after toiling a whole day beneath the tropical fun, will go ten miles in the dark to dance all night to the ſimple muſic of the balafoe, and return without ſteep to his next day’s toil. The penetrating eye of the anatomiſt has diſcovered in the human larynx an apparatus evidently contrived for tempering the great movements of the glottis, ſo as to enable us to produce the intended note with the utmoſt preciſion. There is no doubt therefore that the conſummate Artiſt has not thought it unworthy of his attention. We ought therefore to receive with thankfulneſs this preſent from our Maker—this <hi rend="italic">laborum dulce lenimen ;</hi> and it is ſurely worthy the attention of the philoſopher to add to this innocent elegance of life. This, however, is not the time to enter upon the ſubject. From the jarring obſervations which have yet been made, we could only amuſe the curious reader by holding up to his view a ſpecious theory ; and we are not ſo deſirous of filling our work with what is called <hi rend="italic">original matter,</hi> as to attempt the attainment of that end by ſubſtiiuting fiction for fact and hypotheſis for ſcience.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sound,</hi> in geography, denotes in general any strait or inlet of the ſea between two headlands.
