<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">coercion, it is certain tliat Luther’s influence after the year 1523 was not favourable to the political liberties of&nbsp;his countrymen. In that year both Sickingen and Hutten&nbsp;were removed by death, the victims of a policy to which&nbsp;Luther was always strenuously opposed,—the endeavour&nbsp;to enforce the redress of political and ecclesiastical grievances by recourse to arms. The iconoclastic ardour of&nbsp;Karlstadt and the fanaticism of Miinzer alarmed him beyond measure, and he regarded with the most genuine&nbsp;distrust the spread of their influence among the peasantry.&nbsp;The sequel justified his alarm. Ground between the exactions of the agents of the church on the one hand and the&nbsp;oppression of the nobles on the other, the peasants rose at&nbsp;last in fierce rebellion. No such insurrection, so widespread, so sanguinary, and so ruthless in its vengeance, had&nbsp;ever before disquieted Germany as that which marked the&nbsp;close of the year 1524. The part played by Luther in&nbsp;relation to that gloomy episode will always be a matter&nbsp;for dispute among critics of different schools. To some&nbsp;he appears as lending his great influence to crush the&nbsp;efforts of down-trodden classes driven to desperation by intolerable oppression, to others as the champion of law and&nbsp;order against lawless miscreants intent on revolutionizing&nbsp;both church and state. Luther himself considered that&nbsp;loyalty to the emperor and to the civil authority was a&nbsp;primary duty, and that questions of religious reform should&nbsp;never be suffered to affect the citizen’s fidelity to his political obligations. He probably held that his views were&nbsp;justified by the sequel; but they were not shared by Ulrich&nbsp;von Hutten nor by Zwingli, who both maintained that the&nbsp;popedom and the empire were too closely associated to&nbsp;make it possible to attack the one without also attacking&nbsp;the other.@@<sup>1</sup> The sacramental controversy runs parallel with&nbsp;the history of the Peasants’ War, and it unfortunately happened that the theory of the Eucharist maintained by&nbsp;Zwingli was the same as that upheld by Karlstadt, whose&nbsp;iconoclastic successes at Wittenberg had made him an&nbsp;object of especial dislike to Luther. It was in vain,&nbsp;therefore, that CEcolampadius and Martin Bucer sought&nbsp;to mediate between the two parties. Luther, to whose&nbsp;view the republican doctrines and the sacramental theory&nbsp;advocated by Zwingli appeared closely associated, believed&nbsp;he saw in the latter only a second Karlstadt; and he was&nbsp;thus led to assail him and his followers with an amount of&nbsp;coarse ridicule altogether unbecoming both the subject and&nbsp;the occasion. Zwingli replied in much more temperate&nbsp;fashion, but he did not hesitate to assert that the doctrine&nbsp;which Luther maintained was identical with that taught&nbsp;by the Church of Home.@@<sup>2</sup> To this Luther replied in his&nbsp;tractate entitled </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bekenntniss vom Abendmahl Christi(</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> 1528).&nbsp;This pamphlet warfare only served, however, to embitter&nbsp;the relations of the two parties ; and, although the reactionary sentiments evinced by several of the princes at the&nbsp;second diet of Spires (15th March 1529) gave significant&nbsp;warning of the necessity for union and concord among the&nbsp;whole body of the Reformers, it was distinctly foreseen&nbsp;that the conference convened at Marburg a month later was&nbsp;not likely to lead to any healing of the schism </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">(Luther).&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The excellent intentions of the landgrave of Hesse in convening the conference were altogether frustrated. The&nbsp;moral effect was, however, distinctly favourable to Zwingli.&nbsp;His demeanour towards his opponent had throughout been&nbsp;conciliatory and fraternal, while that of Luther had been&nbsp;of a different character. Although fourteen articles, embracing the most important tenets of the Christian faith,&nbsp;had been agreed upon almost without discussion, he could&nbsp;not regard as a brother the man who differed from him on&nbsp;the obscure and doubtful doctrine embodied in the fifteenth</span></p><div>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">article. This intolerance, a sinister omen for the future of the Reformation movement, produced an unfavourable&nbsp;impression on the minds of not a few with respect to&nbsp;Luther’s moderation, and caused them subsequently to&nbsp;espouse. the side of Zwingli, among their number being&nbsp;the landgrave Philip and Francis Lambert. The former,&nbsp;indeed, did not altogether despair of yet bringing about&nbsp;an alliance between the two parties, and was especially&nbsp;desirous of prevailing upon the Evangelical party (as the&nbsp;Lutherans now began to be called) to admit the congregations at Ulm and Strasburg into their communion. With&nbsp;this design he caused the congress of Schmalkald to be&nbsp;convened on the 29th of November, an earlier date than&nbsp;that originally intended. His friendly purpose was, however, again frustrated; and it soon became evident that&nbsp;the elements of difference between Luther and Zwingli—&nbsp;the reluctance of the former to engage in any line of action&nbsp;which might involve an appeal to arms, and the patriotic&nbsp;spirit of the other, which led him to look upon the assertion&nbsp;of political freedom as itself a Christian duty which it&nbsp;would be moral cowardice to evade—were such as it was&nbsp;hopeless to compose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Such were the circumstances under which the emperor, temporarily freed from graver political anxieties by the&nbsp;treaty of Cambray, convened the diet of Augsburg; and&nbsp;on the 25tli June 1530 the able and generally temperate exposition of the Protestant faith drawn up by Melanchthon,&nbsp;known as the Confession of Augsburg, was read before the&nbsp;assembly and the people. The Catholic reply, composed&nbsp;by Eck and other theologians, was then presented, and&nbsp;finally the Reformers were called upon to renounce their&nbsp;distinctive tenets and return to their ancient faith. They&nbsp;were at the same time required to arrive at a formal decision&nbsp;within a stated period; and on the 13th of August the&nbsp;Evangelical princes notified to the emperor their inability&nbsp;to comply with his command. On the 29th of the following March, at a third congress, convened at Schmalkald,&nbsp;they formed themselves into the memorable League, whereby each party to the compact pledged himself to the&nbsp;following agreement: “As soon as any one of them should&nbsp;be attacked for the gospel’s sake, or on account of any&nbsp;matter resulting from adherence to the gospel, all should&nbsp;at once proceed to the rescue of the party thus assailed,&nbsp;and aid him to the utmost of their ability.” It was likewise resolved steadfastly to oppose the assembling of any&nbsp;council which was not summoned independently of the&nbsp;pope or was not in its composition fairly representative of&nbsp;the whole church. In the meantime the efforts made&nbsp;further to define doctrine had been attended with the&nbsp;usual, it might be said the inevitable, results. The tenth&nbsp;article of the Augsburg Confession had been rigorously&nbsp;formulated so as not merely to exclude the Zwinglian&nbsp;theory of the Lord’s Supper but also to involve in censure&nbsp;any interpretation that deviated, however slightly, from&nbsp;that laid down by Luther himself. A certain section of&nbsp;the Evangelicals declined, accordingly, to sign the Confession, and the four cities of Strasburg, Constance, Mem-mingen, and Lindau shortly after drew up and submitted&nbsp;to the diet another confession, known as the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Confessio&nbsp;Tetrapolitana</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">,—the composition mainly of Bucer and&nbsp;Hedio. In this the influence of the Zwinglian party so&nbsp;far prevailed that the adoration of images, a point on&nbsp;which the Augsburg Confession had been silent, was&nbsp;specifically condemned. The four cities were, however,&nbsp;admitted to the League of Schmalkald in 1531. Other&nbsp;circumstances temporarily strengthened the hands of the&nbsp;Leaguers. The emperor had formed the design of raising&nbsp;his brother Ferdinand, king of Bohemia and Hungary, to&nbsp;the dignity of “ king of the Romans ”; but the project&nbsp;roused the jealousy of the house of Bavaria, and the</span></p>
