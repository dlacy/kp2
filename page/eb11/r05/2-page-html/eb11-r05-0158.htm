<p><span class="font0">of Alexander II.’s reign her domination had been firmly established throughout nearly the whole of the vast expanse&nbsp;of territory lying between Siberia on the north and Persia and&nbsp;Afghanistan on the south, and stretching without interruption&nbsp;from the eastern coast of the Caspian to the Chinese frontier.&nbsp;The greater part of the territory was formally incorporated&nbsp;into the empire, and the petty potentates, such as the khan of&nbsp;Khiva and the amir of Bokhara, who were allowed to retain&nbsp;a semblance of their former sovereignty, became obsequious&nbsp;vassals of the White Tsar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The assassination of Alexander II. by the terrorists made a profound impression on his son and successor, and determined&nbsp;the general character of his rule. Alexander III.&nbsp;(1881-94), who had never sympathized with liberalism&nbsp;in any form, entered frankly on a reactionary policy,&nbsp;which was pursued consistently during the whole of his&nbsp;reign. He could not, of course, undo the great reforms of&nbsp;his* predecessor, but he amended them in such a way&nbsp;as to counteract what he considered the exaggerations&nbsp;of liberalism. Local self-government in the village&nbsp;communes, the rural districts and the towns was&nbsp;carefully restricted, and placed to a greater extent under the&nbsp;control of the regular officials. The reformers of the previous&nbsp;reign had endeavoured to make the emancipated peasantry&nbsp;administratively and economically independent of the landed&nbsp;proprietors; the conservatives of this later era, proceeding&nbsp;on the assumption that the peasants did not know how to&nbsp;make a proper use of the liberty prematurely conferred upon&nbsp;them, endeavoured to re-establish the influence of the landed&nbsp;proprietors by appointing from amongst them “ land-chiefs,”&nbsp;who were to exercise over the peasants of their district a certain&nbsp;amount of patriarchal jurisdiction. The reformers of the&nbsp;previous reign had sought to make the new local administration&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(zemstvo)</span><span class="font0"> a system of genuine rural self-government and a basis&nbsp;for future parliamentary institutions; these later conservatives&nbsp;transformed it into a mere branch of the ordinary state administration, and took precautions against its ever assuming a&nbsp;political character. Even municipal institutions, which had&nbsp;never shown much vitality, were subjected to similar restrictions.&nbsp;In short, the various forms of local self-government, which were&nbsp;intended to raise the nation gradually to the higher political&nbsp;level of western Europe, were condemned as unsuited to the&nbsp;national character and traditions, and as productive of disorder&nbsp;and demoralization. They were accordingly replaced in great&nbsp;measure by the old autocratic methods of administration, and&nbsp;much of the administrative corruption which had been cured,&nbsp;or at least repressed, by the reform enthusiasm again flourished</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">luxuriantly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In a small but influential section of the educated classes there was a conviction that the revolutionary tendencies, which&nbsp;culminated in Nihilism and Anarchism, proceeded from the&nbsp;adoption of cosmopolitan rather than national principles in all&nbsp;spheres of educational and administrative activity, and that&nbsp;the best remedy for the evils from which the country was&nbsp;suffering was to be found in a return to the three great principles&nbsp;of Nationality, Orthodoxy and Autocracy. This doctrine, which&nbsp;had been invented by the Slavophils of a previous generation,&nbsp;was early instilled into the mind of Alexander III. by Pobê-donostsev </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.),</span><span class="font0"> who was one of his teachers, and later his most&nbsp;trusted adviser, and its influence can be traced in all the more&nbsp;important acts of the government during that monarch’s reign.&nbsp;His determination to maintain autocracy was officially proclaimed a few days after his accession. Nationality and&nbsp;Eastern Orthodoxy, which are so closely connected as to be&nbsp;almost blended together in the Russian mind, received not less&nbsp;attention. Even in European Russia the regions near the&nbsp;frontier contain a great variety of nationalities, languages&nbsp;and religions. In Finland the population is composed of&nbsp;Finnish-speaking and Swedish-speaking Protestants; the&nbsp;Baltic provinces are inhabited by German-speaking, Lei t-speaking and Esth-speaking Lutherans; the inhabitants of&nbsp;the south-western provinces are chiefly Polish-speaking Roman</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Catholics and Yiddish-speaking Jews; in the Crimea and on the Middle Volga there are a considerable number of Tatar-speaking Mahommedans; and in the Caucasus there is a&nbsp;conglomeration of races and languages such as is to be found&nbsp;on no other portion of the earth’s surface. Until recent times&nbsp;these various nationalities were allowed to retain unmolested&nbsp;the language, religion and peculiar local administration of&nbsp;their ancestors; but when the new nationality doctrine came&nbsp;into fashion, attempts were made to spread among them the&nbsp;language, religion and administrative institutions of the&nbsp;dominant race. In the reigns of Nicholas I. and Alexander II.&nbsp;these attempts were merely occasional and intermittent;&nbsp;under Alexander III. they were made systematically and&nbsp;with very little consideration for the feelings, wishes and&nbsp;interests of the people concerned. The local institutions&nbsp;were assimilated to those of the purely Russian provinces;&nbsp;the use of the Russian language was made obligatory in the&nbsp;administration, in the tribunals and to some extent in the&nbsp;schools; the spread of Eastern Orthodoxy was encouraged by&nbsp;the authorities, whilst the other confessions were placed under&nbsp;severe restrictions; foreigners were prohibited from possessing&nbsp;landed property; and in some provinces administrative measures&nbsp;were taken for making the land pass into the hands of Orthodox&nbsp;Russians. In this process some of the local officials displayed&nbsp;probably an amount of zeal beyond the intentions of the government, but any attempt to oppose the movement was rigorously&nbsp;punished. Of all the various races the Jews .were the most&nbsp;severely treated. The great majority of them had long been&nbsp;confined to the western and south-western provinces. In the&nbsp;rest of the country they had not been allowed to reside in the&nbsp;villages, because their habits of keeping vodka-shops and&nbsp;lending money at usurious interest were found to demoralize&nbsp;the peasantry, and even in the towns their numbers and occupations had been restricted by the authorities. But, partly from&nbsp;the usual laxity of the administration and partly from the&nbsp;readiness of the Jews to conciliate the needy officials, the rules&nbsp;had been by no means strictly applied. As soon as this fact&nbsp;became known to Alexander III. he ordered the rules to be&nbsp;strictly carried out, without considering what an enormous&nbsp;amount of hardship and suffering such an order entailed. He&nbsp;also caused new rules to be enacted by which his Jewish subjects were heavily handicapped in education and professional&nbsp;advancement. In short, complete Russification of all non-Russian populations and institutions was the chief aim of the&nbsp;government in home affairs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the foreign policy of the empire Alexander III. likewise introduced considerable changes. During his father’s reign&nbsp;its main objects were: in the west, the maintenance&nbsp;of the alliance with Germany; in south-eastern Europe,&nbsp;the recovery of what had been lost by the Crimean War,&nbsp;the gradual weakening of the Sultan’s authority, and the&nbsp;increase of Russian influence among the minor Slav nationalities; in Asia, the gradual but cautious expansion of&nbsp;Russian domination. In the reign of Alexander III. the first&nbsp;of these objects was abandoned. Already, before his accession,&nbsp;the bonds of friendship which united Russia to Germany had&nbsp;been weakened by the action of Bismarck in giving to the cabinet&nbsp;of St Petersburg at the Berlin congress less diplomatic support&nbsp;than was expected, and by the Austro-German treaty of alliance&nbsp;(October 1879), concluded avowedly for the purpose of opposing&nbsp;Russian aggression; but the old relations were partly reestablished by secret negotiations in 1880, by a meeting of the&nbsp;young tsar and the old emperor at Danzig in 1881, and by the&nbsp;meeting of the three emperors at Skierniewice in 1884, by which&nbsp;the Three Emperors’ League was reconstituted for a term of&nbsp;three years (see ^Europe: </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History).</span><span class="font0"> Gradually, however, a&nbsp;great change took place in the tsar’s views with regard to the&nbsp;German alliance. He suspected Bismarck of harbouring hostile&nbsp;designs against Russia, and he came to recognize that the&nbsp;permanent weakening of France was not in accordance with&nbsp;Russian political interests. He determined, therefore, to&nbsp;oppose any further disturbance of the balance of power in favour</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
