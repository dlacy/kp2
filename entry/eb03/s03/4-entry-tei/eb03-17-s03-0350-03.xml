a name given to an engine uſed to hoiſt or diſplace the lower maſts of a ſhip. The ſheers employed for this purpoſe in the royal navy are compoſed of ſeveral long maſts, whoſe heels reſt upon the side of the hulk, and having their heads declining outward from the perpendicular, ſo as to hang over the veſſel whoſe maſts are to be fixed or diſplaced. The tackles, which extend from the head of the maſt to the ſheer- heads, are intended to pull in the latter toward the maſt- head, particularly when they are charged with the weight of a maſt after it is raiſed out of any ſhip, which is performed by ſtrong tackles depending from the ſheer-heads. The effort of theſe tackles is produced by two capſterns, fixed on the deck for this purpoſe.</p><p>In merchant ſhips this machine is compoſed of two maſts or props, erected in the ſame veſſel wherein the maſt is to be planted, or from whence it is to be removed. The lower ends of theſe props reſt on the oppoſite ſides of the deck, and their upper parts are faſtened acroſs, ſo as that a tackle which hangs from the intersection may be almoſt perpendicularly above the station of the maſt to which the mechanical powers are applied. Theſe ſheers are ſecured by stays, which extend for ward and aft to the oppoſite extremities of the veſſel.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">SHEET-Lead.</hi> See <hi rend="smallcaps">Plumbery.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sheet,</hi> in ſea-language, a rope faſtened to one or both the lower corners of a ſail, to extend and retain it in a particular ſtation. When a ſhip ſails with a lateral wind, the lower corner of the main and fore-ſail are fastened by a tack and a ſheet ; the former being to windward, and the latter to leeward ; the tack, however, is entirely diffuſed with a ſtern wind, whereas the ſail is never ſpread without the aſſiſtance of one or both of the ſheets. The ſtay-ſails and ſtudding-ſails have only one tack and one ſheet each : the ſtay-ſail tacks are always faſtened forward, and the ſheet drawn aft; but the ſtudding-ſail tack draws the under clue of the ſail to the extremity of the boom, whereas the ſheet is employed to extend the inmoſt.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
