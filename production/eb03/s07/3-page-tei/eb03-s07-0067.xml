Tilly, in the mean time, carried fire and ſword into the unhappy electorate. At the head of an army of 44,000 veterans, he ſummoned the city of Leipſic to ſurrender ; denouncing the same vengeance againſt it as had been executed on Magdeburg, in case of a refuſal. By this the governor was ſo much intimidated, that he inſtantly ſubmitted ; and alſo ſurrendered the caſtle of Passenberg, which was in a condition to have stood out till the arrival of the Swediſh army. The elector, enraged at the loss of theſe valuable places, ordered his army to join the Swedes with all expedition, and preſſed the king ſo warmly to engage, that at laſt he yielded to his desire. On the 7th of September 1631, Guſtavus led out his army in the moſt beautiful order, the Swedes forming one column on the right, and the Saxons another on the left ; each amounting to 15,000 men. Tilly drew up his men in one vaſt column, poſſibly with a view of ſurrounding the flanks of the king’s army ; but every officer of experience in his army, from the excellency of the Swediſh diſpoſition, prognoſticated the event of the engagement. Guſtavus led on the troops againſt that wing of the Imperialiſts commanded by Pappenheim, whom be drove back to ſuch a diſtance, that he gained a point of the wind ; by which the ſmoke fell upon their enemies and conſiderably embarraſſed them, at the ſame time that the Swedes were got without the reach of a battery which played furiouſly on their flank. General Bannier in the mean time cut in pieces the troops of Holſtein, and mortally wounded the duke who commanded them. Pappenheim led on his troops ſeven times to the charge, in hopes of regaining his former ſituation ; but was as often repulſed by the Swedes. Tilly all this while engaged with the Saxons ; but having at laſt driven them off the field, the whole ſtrength of the Imperial army was turned upon the Swediſh left wing commanded by General Horn. The Swedes ſuſtained the attack with the greateſt firmneſs, until the king detached general Teuffel with the centre to assiſt them. The Imperialiſts then were no longer able to ſtand their ground ; but gave way everywhere except in the centre, which was compoſed of 18 regiments of veterans accuſtomed to victory, and deemed invincible. They made incredible efforts to maintain the reputation they had acquired ; and, though ſwept off in great numbers by the Swediſh artillery, never ſhrunk or fell into confuſion. Four regiments, after their officers had been killed, formed themſelves, and retired to the ſkirt of a wood; where they were all to a man cut in pieces, without demanding quarter. Tilly retired at the head of 600 men, and eſcaped by the coming on of the night. Seven thouſand Imperialiſts lay dead on the field of battle ; 4000 were taken priſoners ; a fine train of artillery was lost, with upwards of 100 ſtandards, enſigns, and other military trophies.—On this occasion it was that the Scots regiment in the Swediſh ſervſee firſt practiſed the method of firing in platoons ; to which ſome aſcribe the aſtoniſhment and confuſion that appeared in the Imperial army. It is thought, however, that the Swediſh monarch diſplayed greater abilities in gaining this victory than improving it afterwards ; for had he marched immediately to Vienna, before his enemies had time to recover their conſternation, it is ſuppoſed that the emperor would have been obliged to abandon his capital, and leave his hereditary dominions to the mercy of the conqueror. But Guſtavus apprehended that Tilly might fall upon the  Saxons while he was ravaging the Auſtrian hereditary dominions; which would have deprived him not only of an ally, but of the free quarters which the elector had promiſed to his troops in case of a retreat. For this and ſome other reaſons he determined to penetrate into Franconia, where he reduced ſeveral places, particularly the fortreſs of Workburg. Tilly having collected his ſcattered troops, which formed an army ſtill ſuperior in number to that of Guſtavus, marched to the relief of this place ; but came too late. He then directed his march towards Rottenberg, where four regiments were cut in pieces by a Swediſh detachment. After this the king reduced Hanau, Franckfort on the Maine, and Mentz ; deſtroying a body of Spaniards, who had thrown themſelves in his way to obſtruct his paſſage.</p><p>The court of Vienna was now thrown into the utmoſt confuſion ; and sent everywhere begging aſſiſtance, and soliciting the Catholic princes to arm in defence of their religion. The emperor was moſt embarraſſed in finding out a general capable of oppoſing Guſtavus in the field ; for the late misfortunes of count Tilly had entirely ſunk his reputation. Walleſtein, an old experienced officer, was made choice of ; but as he had formerly been disgraced, it was apprehended that he would not accept of the command of which he had once been deprived. This objection, however, was got over ; and Walleſtein not only accepted of the command, but, at his own expence, augmented the army to 40,000 men.</p><p>During the whole winter the Swediſh army kept the field ; and before the approach of ſummer had reduced Crantznach, Bobenhauſen, Kirchberg, Magdeburg, Cozlar, Northeim, Gottingen, and Dunderſtadt ; while the landgrave William made great progreſs in Weſtphalia. Guſtavus Horn was repulſed before Bamberg ; but ſoon had his revenge, by entirely deſtroying two regiments of Imperialiſts. To prevent the troops from being affected by the loss before Bamberg, the king reſolved to give battle to Tilly, who was marching into Bavaria to prevent the Swedes from gaining a footing in that electorate. He pursued the Imperial general through a vaſt tract of country, defeated his rear-guard, and, having reduced a variety of towns and fortreſſes on the Danube, penetrated as far as Ulm. Advancing to the river Leck, count Tilly poſted himſelf in a wood on the oppoſite side, to diſpute his passage. Guſtavus endeavoured to diſlodge him by a regular fire from 70 pieces of cannon. The ſlaughter was dreadful ; and Tilly himſelf, being wounded by a cannon-ball in the knee, died a few days before he was to have been ſuperſeded by Walleſtein. The following night the Imperial army evacuated the poſt; part retiring to Ingoldſtadt, and others to Newburg. Guſtavus immediately croſſed the river, and ſeized the towns of Rain and Newburg, which the enemy had abandoned. Augſiburg next ſubmitted ; and from the inhabitants oſ this place Guſtavus exacted an oath of fidelity, not only to himſelf but to the crown of Sweden. This meaſure gave the greateſt offence to many of the Germanic body, and made them imagine that the king of Sweden had other views than the defence of the Proteſtant cauſe.</p><p>From Augſburg the Swedes advanced towards Ratiſbon ; but were diſappointed in their deſign of getting poſſeſſion of that city, by reaſon of the Bavarians having thrown a very numerous garriſon into the place.—In the mean time, ambaſſadors arrived from Denmark, offering the mediation of that crown for obtaining a laſting peace between the contending parties. Guſtavus, however, replied, that no ſuch peace could take place till the Catholic princes thought proper to grant the Proteſtants full and ample ſecurity for their enjoyment of future tranquillity. But the ambaſſadors had no inſtructions to propoſe any thing farther, and thus the negotiation vaniſhed. Guſtavus now, reſolving to retort upon themſelves the cruelties which the Bavarians had inflicted on the Proteſtants, laid the towns of Morzbourg, Frieſengen, and Lardſhut, in aſhes. The inhabitants of Munich ſaved themſelves by ſubmiſſion; but as the peaſants in that</p></body></text></TEI>
