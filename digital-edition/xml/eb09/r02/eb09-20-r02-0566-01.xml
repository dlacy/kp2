His teachers were the great rabbins Rabbenu Nissim and Rabbenu Hananeel, both of Kairawan (</hi> <hi rend="italic">ob</hi> . 1055). What Rashi (ç.v.) was to the Ashkenazic Riph was for the Sepharadic Jews, <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="2"> On these names see <hi rend="smallcaps">Mλhzor,</hi> vol. <hi rend="smallcaps">xv.</hi> ρ. 293. </note> not only a teacher of the deepest learning, but also one who made new paths altogether for the students of the Talmud. Otherwise these tw <hi rend="sup">τ</hi> o great men differed widely from one another in their activity. Rashi left the Babylonian Talmud, corrections of the text excepted (which he, however, confined to his own commentary, and by which his own disciples and publishers corrected the Talmud text), in its old state. Al-phasi, however, first separated from it the Agadah, which he cast aside almost entirely, and then he sifted the Hala-khah <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="3"> On these terms see <hi rend="smallcaps">Midrasπ,</hi> vol. xvi. p. 285, and <hi rend="smallcaps">Misπnλh,</hi> p. 503. </note> thoroughly, retaining only the practical part of it.

One of the commentaries accompanying the Riph is by Rashi. This commentary, however, which is now an integral part of the book, was not written for it by Rashi himself, who could scarcely have known of Riph’s existence, and much less of his work. The fact is the enterprising publisher of the second edition (Venice, 1521-22, fol.), the famous Daniel Bombergi, had one of the three recensions which Rashi had made on the Talmud excerpted and applied to corresponding parts of the Riph which has the very wording of the Talmud, or something near it.

<p>Talmud (see Rashi) Rashbam (7.u) was utilized. Riph was not only a great Talmudist, but also a man of the greatest magnanimity and highest morality, as may be seen from the following two facts. When R. Yishak Ibn Albalia, who had been his bitterest enemy, lay at the point of death, he recommended his son to Riph, who received him with the greatest kindness, and at once adopted him as son. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="4"> See <hi rend="italic">Sepher Hαkkabbalah</hi> of Rabad II. <hi rend="italic">{q.v.}.</hi> </note> Again, when Riph himself was at the point of death he recommended to the congregation of Lucena for successor, not his own learned and virtuous son Ya'akob, but the yet more learned, though not more virtuous, R. Yoseph Ibn Migash, <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="5"> See <hi rend="italic">Hemdah Genuzah</hi> (Königsberg, 1856, 8vo), leaf 30a. </note> who became the teacher of the teachers of Maimonides (g.u).</p><p>Although Riph’s works which are known are only two, the editions of one of these and the commentaries thereon are very numerous ; we can only mention a few of them.</p><p>I. <hi rend="italic">Hilekhoth Rab Al-phez.</hi> (1) With the <hi rend="italic">Novellæ</hi> of Rabbenu Nissimb.
