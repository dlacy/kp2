<p><span class="font0">tit&gt;U3 and ignorant. They were, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">however, </span><span class="font0">paffionately devoted to their monarch, and whatever concerned him.&nbsp;In 1754, when Louis XV. was taken ill at Metz, the&nbsp;whole nation was truly in a kind of deſpair. The cou-rier and his horfe that brought the news of his recovery&nbsp;to Paris were both almoſt ſuffocated by the embraces of&nbsp;the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">w^e have faid that the French monarch was deſpo-tic. His power was ſupported by his army and by a watchful police, having in pay an infinite hoſt of ſpies&nbsp;and other ſervants. In France no man was ſafe. The&nbsp;ſecrets of private families were ſearched into. Nothing&nbsp;was unknown to the jealous inquiſition of the police.&nbsp;Men were ſeized by </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">lettres de cachet</span><span class="font0"> when they leaſt ex-pected it, and their families had no means of diſcovering&nbsp;their fate. The ſentence of a court of law againſt a&nbsp;nobleman was uſually reverfed by the miniſter. No&nbsp;book was publiſhed without the licence of a cenſor-ge-neral appointed by the court, and the miniſter was ac-countable to none but the king. No account was given of the expenditure of thc public money. Enormous gratifications and penfions were given as the reward of the moſt infamous ſervices. The ſupreme&nbsp;power of the ſtate was uſually lodged with a favourite&nbsp;miſtreſs, and ſhe was ſometimes a woman taken from&nbsp;public proſtitution. This was not indeed the cafe under Louis XVI. but it was nevertheless one of the mis-fortunes of his life that he was far from being abſolute&nbsp;in his own family. Still, however, with all its faults,&nbsp;the French court was the moſt ſplendid and poliſhed in&nbsp;Europe. It was more' the reſort of men of talents and&nbsp;literature of every kind, and there they met with more&nbsp;ample protection, than anywhere elſe. The court was&nbsp;often jealous of their productions, but they met with&nbsp;the moſt diſtinguiſhed attention from men of fortune&nbsp;and rank ; inſomuch that for a century ſſaſt the&nbsp;French have given the law to Europe in all queſtions&nbsp;of taſte, of literature, and of every polite accompliſh-ment. The gay elegance that prevailed at court dif-fuſed itſelf through the nation ; and amidſt much internal miſery, gave it to a foreigner the appearance of hap-pineſs, or at leaſt of levity and vanity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Such as it was, this government had ſtood for ages, and might have continued, had not a concurrence of&nbsp;cauſes contributed to its overthrow. The inferior orders of clergy, excluded from all chance of preferment,&nbsp;regarded their ſuperiors with jealouſy and envy, and&nbsp;were ready to join the laity of their own rank in any&nbsp;popular commotion. The inferior provincial nobleſſe&nbsp;beheld with contempt and indignation the vices and the&nbsp;power of the courtiers, and the higher nobility wiſhed&nbsp;to diminiſh the power of the crown. The practiſing&nbsp;lawyers, almoſt entirely excluded from the chance of&nbsp;becoming judges, wiſhed eagerly for a change of affairs,&nbsp;not doubting that their talents and profeſſional ſkill&nbsp;would render them neceſſary amidſt any alterations that&nbsp;could occur- Accordingly, they were the firſt inſtruments in producing the. revolution, and have been its&nbsp;moſt active ſupporters. The monied intereſt wiſhed ca-gerly for the downfal of the ancient nobility. As for&nbsp;the great mafs of the common people, they were too&nbsp;ignorant, too firperſtitiouſly attached to old eſtabliſh-wιents, and too much depreſſed, to have any conception&nbsp;of the nature of political liberty, or any hope of obtaining it. we have already ſtated the leading circum-ſtances which led to the French revolution (ſee Franck,&nbsp;n<sup>o</sup> 184, &amp;c. ) ; but there were other circumſtances which&nbsp;contributed in an equal degree both to its commence-ment and its progreſs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For 40 years the principles of liberty had been diſſe-minated with eagerneſs in France by ſome men of great talents, as Rouſſeau, Helvetius, and Raynal, to whom&nbsp;the celebrated Montefquieu had led the way. Beſides&nbsp;thefe, there was in France a vaſt multitude of what were&nbsp;called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">men oſ letters,</span><span class="font0"> or perſons who gave this account&nbsp;of the manner in which they fpent their time. All&nbsp;theſe were deeply engaged on the fide of ſome kind of&nbsp;political reform. The men of letters in Paris alone are&nbsp;ſaid to have amounted to 20,000. Cue of the laſt acts&nbsp;of the admiiiiſtration of the archbiſhop of Thouloufe&nbsp;was, on the 5th July 1788, to publiſh a refolution of&nbsp;the king in council, inviting all his ſubjects to give him&nbsp;their advice with regard to the ſtate of affairs. This&nbsp;was confidered as a conceſſion of an unlimited liberty of&nbsp;the preſs ; and it is ſcarcely poſſible to form an idea of&nbsp;the infinite variety of political publications which from&nbsp;that period diffuſed among the people a diſſatisfaction&nbsp;with the order of things in which they had hitherto&nbsp;lived.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The eſtabliſhed religion of France had for fome time paſt been gradually undermined. It had been ſolemnly&nbsp;aſſaulted by philoſophers in various elaborate performances ; and men ©f wit, among ∖vlιom voltaire took the&nbsp;lead, had attacked it with the dangerous weapon of ridicule. The Roman Catholic religion is much expofed&nbsp;in this reſpect, in conſequence of the multitude of falfe&nbsp;miracles and legendary tales with which its hiſtory&nbsp;abounds, without diſcriminating betwixt the refpect-able principles on which it reſts, and the fuperſtitious&nbsp;follies by which they had been defaced, the French nation learned to laugh at the whole, and rejected inſtead&nbsp;of reforming the religion of their fathers. Thus the&nbsp;firſt order in the ſtate had already begun to be regarded as uſeleſs, and the minds of men were prepared for&nbsp;important changes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The immenſe population of the city of Paris, amounting to upwards of 800,000 fouls, rendered it an important engine in the hands of the conductors of the revolution. An overgrown capital has always proved dangerous to a government that is or attempts to be deſpotic, as appears ſrom thc hiſtory of ancient Babylon and Rome, as well as of modern Conſtantinople, of London&nbsp;under Charles I. and Paris under ſeveral of its kings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">we cannot here avoid mentioning a phyfical event, which affiſted not a little in producing many of the&nbsp;convulſions attending the revolution, a general ſcarcity&nbsp;of grain, which occurred about that period. Οη Sun-day the 13thof July 1788, about nine in the morning,&nbsp;without any eclipſe, a dreadful darknefe ’ſuddenly over-fprcad ſeveral parts of France. It was the prelude of&nbsp;ſuch a tempeſt as is unexampled in the temperate climates of Europe, wind, rain, hail, and thunder, feemed to contend in impetuoſity ; but the hail was the&nbsp;great inſtrument of ruin. Inſtead of the rich proſpects&nbsp;of an early autumn, the face of nature in the ſpace of&nbsp;an hour preſented the dreary afpect of ιιniverfal winter.&nbsp;The foil was converted into a morals, the .ſtanding&nbsp;corn beaten into the quagmire, the vines broken to&nbsp;pieces, the fruit trees demoli.ſhed, and unmelted hail ly-iπg in heaps like rocks of fold ice. Even the robcſt</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
