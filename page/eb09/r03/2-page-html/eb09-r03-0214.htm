<p><span class="font0">According to tradition Rovigno was originally built on an island, Cissa by name, which disappeared during the earthquakes&nbsp;about 737. In the 6th century, as the local legend has it, the body&nbsp;of St Euphemia of Chalcedon was miraculously conveyed to the&nbsp;island ; and at a later date it was transported to the summit of the&nbsp;promontory, Monte di Sant’ Eufemia, whither it was restored by&nbsp;the Venetians in 1410 after being in the possession of the Genoese&nbsp;from 1380. The diocese of Rovigno was merged in 1008 in the&nbsp;bishopric of Parenzo ; but its church continued to have the title&nbsp;of cathedral. Rovigno passed definitively into the hands of the&nbsp;Venetians in 1330, and it remained true to the republic till the&nbsp;treaty of Campo Formio (1797).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">R0VIG0, a city of Italy, the chief town of a province, and the seat of the bishop of Adria, lies between the Po&nbsp;and the Adige, and is traversed by the Adigetto, a navigable branch of the Adige. By rail it is 27 miles south-south-west of Padua. The architecture bears the stamp&nbsp;both of Venetian and Ferrarese influence. The cathedral&nbsp;church of Santo Stefano (1696) is of less interest than&nbsp;La Madonna del Soccorso, an octagon (with a fine campanile), begun in 1594. The town-hall contains a library of&nbsp;80,000 volumes belonging to the Accademia de’ Concordi,&nbsp;founded in 1580, and a picture gallery enriched with the&nbsp;spoils of the monasteries. Wool, silk, linen, and leather&nbsp;are among the local manufactures. The population of the&nbsp;city proper was 7452 in 1871 and 7272 in 1881 ; the&nbsp;commune in 1881 had 11,460 inhabitants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rovigo (Neo-Latin </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rhodigium)</span><span class="font0"> appears to be mentioned as Rudigo in 838. It was selected as his residence by the bishop of&nbsp;Adria on the destruction of his city by the Huns. From the Ilth&nbsp;to the 14th century the Este family was usually in authority ; but&nbsp;the Venetians who obtained the town and castle in pledge between&nbsp;1390 and 1400 took the place by siege in 1482, and, though the&nbsp;Este more than once recovered it, the Venetians, returning in 1514,&nbsp;retained possession till the French Revolution. In 1806 the city&nbsp;was made a duchy in favour of General Savary. The Austrians&nbsp;in 1815 created it a royal city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROVIGO, </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Duke op.</span><span class="font1"> See </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Savary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROWE, </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Nicholas</span><span class="font1"> (1674-1718), the descendant of a family long resident at Lamerton in Devon, was born at&nbsp;Little Barford in Bedfordshire, June 30, 1674. The house&nbsp;in which he was born is close to the Great North Road,&nbsp;and a small stone to his memory has been erected in the&nbsp;centre of the garden. His father, John Rowe, took to&nbsp;the law as his profession, and at his death in 1692 (by&nbsp;which time he had attained to the dignity of being a&nbsp;serjeant at law) had amassed sufficient property to leave&nbsp;to his son an income of £300 a year. Nicholas Rowe&nbsp;passed some time in a private school at Highgate, and&nbsp;then proceeded to Westminster School, at that time under&nbsp;the charge of the celebrated master Dr Busby. In 1688&nbsp;he became a king’s scholar in this foundation, but three&nbsp;years later he was called away from school and entered as&nbsp;a student at the Middle Temple. Tbe study of the law&nbsp;had little attraction for a young man of good person and&nbsp;lively manners, and at his father’s death in the following&nbsp;year he devoted himself to society and to literature. His&nbsp;first play, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Ambitious Stepmother,</span><span class="font1"> was produced when&nbsp;he was twenty-five years old. It was followed by&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tamerlane,</span><span class="font1"> a patriotic composition in which the virtues of&nbsp;William III. were lauded under the disguise of Tamerlane&nbsp;and the vices of the French king, Louis XIV., were&nbsp;denounced in the person of Bajazet. The popularity of&nbsp;this production soon declined, but for many years it was&nbsp;acted once every year, on the anniversary of the landing&nbsp;at Torbay of the Dutch prince. His next play, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Fair&nbsp;Penitent,</span><span class="font1"> long retained the favourable reception which&nbsp;marked its first appearance, and was pronounced by the&nbsp;great critic of the 18th century one of the most pleasing&nbsp;tragedies which had ever been written. Through its success the name of the principal male character Lothario&nbsp;became identified in popular language as the embodiment&nbsp;of the manners and habits of a fashionable rake. After&nbsp;the production of two more tragedies, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The&nbsp;Royal Convert,</span><span class="font1"> of slight account at the time and long&nbsp;since forgotten, Rowe tried; his hand on a comedy, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tlie&nbsp;Biter.</span><span class="font1"> Much to the author’s surprise his attempt in this&nbsp;new direction proved a failure, but Rowe recognized the&nbsp;justice of the verdict of the audience sufficiently to abstain&nbsp;from risking a second disappointment. His two last&nbsp;dramatic works were entitled </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Jane Shore</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lady Jane&nbsp;Grey,</span><span class="font1"> and the former of them, from the popularity of its&nbsp;subject and the elegance of its language, kept its position&nbsp;on the stage longer than any other of his works.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rowe excelled most of his contemporaries in the knowledge of languages. He was acquainted more or less&nbsp;thoroughly with Greek, Latin, French, Italian, and&nbsp;Spanish. The latter tongue he is said to have acquired&nbsp;on the recommendation of Harley and with the expectation that he would afterwards be rewarded by some high&nbsp;office. When, however, he reported his new acquisition&nbsp;to the new minister he was met with the dry remark from&nbsp;Harley—“How I envy you the pleasure of reading Don&nbsp;Quixote in the original ! ” Notwithstanding this disappointment, Rowe enjoyed many lucrative posts during&nbsp;his short life. When the duke of Queensberry was&nbsp;principal secretary of state for Scotland (1708-10), Rowe&nbsp;acted as his under-secretary. On the accession of George&nbsp;I. he was made a surveyor of customs, and on the death of&nbsp;Tate he became poet laureate. He was also appointed&nbsp;clerk of the council to the prince of Wales, and the list&nbsp;of preferments was closed by his nomination by Lord-Chancellor Parker (5th May 1718) as secretary of presentations in Chancery. He died 6th December 1718, and was&nbsp;buried in the south cross of Westminster Abbey. By&nbsp;his first wife, a daughter of Mr Parsons, one of the auditors&nbsp;of the revenue, he left a son John; and by his second wife,&nbsp;Anne, the daughter of Joseph Devenish of a Dorsetshire&nbsp;family, he had an only daughter, Charlotte, born in 1718,&nbsp;who married Henry Fane, a younger brother of Thomas,&nbsp;eighth earl of Westmoreland. The burials of mother and&nbsp;daughter are recorded in Colonel Chester’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Registers of&nbsp;Westminster Abbey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rowe’s tragedies were marked by passionate feeling set off by a graceful diction, and were well adapted for stage effect. If </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The&nbsp;Fair Penitent</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Jane Shore</span><span class="font0"> have been expelled from the stage,&nbsp;their historic reputation and their style will repay perusal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Among Rowe’s other literary efforts may be mentioned an edition of the works of Shakespeare (1709), for which he received from&nbsp;Lintot the bookseller the sum of £36, 10s., a rate of pay not out of&nbsp;proportion to the labour which was bestowed upon the task. At&nbsp;the time of his death he had also finished a translation of Lucan’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pharsalia,</span><span class="font0"> a work then much praised and not yet superseded by&nbsp;any competitor. Rowe’s minor poems were beneath the level of&nbsp;his age. An edition of his works was published in 1720 under the&nbsp;care of Mr (afterwards Bishop) Newton. His translation of Lucan&nbsp;was edited by Dr Welwood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROWING is the act of driving forward or propelling a boat along the surface of the water by means of oars. It&nbsp;is remarkable how scanty, until quite recent times, are the&nbsp;records of this art, which at certain epochs has played no&nbsp;insignificant part in the world’s history. It was the oar&nbsp;that brought Phoenician letters and civilization to Greece ;&nbsp;it was the oar that propelled the Hellenic fleet to Troy ; it&nbsp;was the oar that saved Europe from Persian despotism ; it&nbsp;was the skilful use of the oar by free citizens which was&nbsp;the glory of Athens in her prime. It is to be regretted&nbsp;that so little is known of the details connected with it, or&nbsp;of the disposal of the rowers on board the splendid fleet&nbsp;which started in its pride for Sicily, when 17,000 oars at&nbsp;a given signal smote the brine, and 100 long ships raced&nbsp;as far as Ægina. The vessels of the ancient Greeks and</span></p>
