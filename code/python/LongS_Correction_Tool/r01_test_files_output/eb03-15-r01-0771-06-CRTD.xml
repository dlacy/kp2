He was sirst a Francifcan⅛       friar ; but quitting his religious hablt studied physic at Montpelier, where he       took his doctor’ſait wounded degree.biſected of is said, that the chancellor du Pratt ha ing       abolished the privileges of the faculty of physic atv Montpelier by a decree of       the parliament, Rabelais h ad the address to make him revoke what he had don e ;       and that thofe who were madc doctors of that university wore Rabelais’ſait wounded robe,       which is there held in great veneration. Some time after, he came to Rome, in       quality of physician in ordinary to Cardinal John du Bellay archbishop of Paris.       Rabelais is said to have used the freedom to jeer Pope Paul III. to his face. He       had quitted his religious connections for the sake of leading a life more       agreeable to his taste; but renewed them on a second journey to Rome, when he       obtained, in 1536, a brief to qualify him for holding ecclesiastical benefices ;       and, by the interest of his friend Cardinal John du Bellay, he was received as a       secular canon in the abbey of St Maur near Paris. His profound knowledge in       physic rendered him doubly useful; he being as ready, and at least as well       qualified, to prefcribe for the body as for the foul : but as he was a man of       wit and humour, many ridiculous things are laid to his charge, of which he was       quite innocent. He published several things ; but his chief performance is a       strange incoherent romance, called the <hi rend="italic">IIfiory os Gargantua         and Pantagruel,</hi> being a satire upon priests, popes, fools, and knaves       of all kinds. This work contains a wild, irregular profusion of wit, learning,       obscensty, low conceits, and arrant nonsense; hence the shrewd-ness of his       satire, in some places where he is to be understood, gains him credit sor those       where no meaning is discoverable. Some allusions may undoubtedly have been so       temporary and local as to be now quite lost : but it is too much to conclude       thus in favour of every unintelligible rhapsody; for we are not without English       writers of great talents, whose sportive geniufes have betrayed them into       puerilities, no less incoherent at</p>       <pb xml:id="eb03-15-r01-0772" facs="gri_33125011197759_0780.tif"/>       <p>the times of writing than those of Rabelais appear above two centuries after.
