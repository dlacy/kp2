in natural hiſtory, is applied to an animal which chews over again what it has eat before ; which is popularly called <hi rend="italic">chewing the cud.</hi> Peyer, in a treatiſe <hi rend="italic">De Rurmnaniibus et Ru&gt;ninatione,</hi> ſhows that there are ſome animals which really ruminate ; as oxen, ſheep, deer, goats, camels, hares, and ſquirtels : and that there are others which only appear to do ſo, as moles, crickets, bees, beetles, crabs, mullets, &amp;c. The latter claſs, he obſerves, have their ſto-machs compoſed of muſeular ſibres, by which the food is ground up and down as in thoſe which really ruminate. Mr Ray obſerves, that ruminants are all four-footed, hairy, and viviparous ; ſome with hollow and perpetual horns, others with deciduous ones.</p>
