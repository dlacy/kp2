        <p><span class="font1">stantius reluctantly granted, the title of Cæsar to his cousin Julian
                and placed him in charge of Gaul, where&nbsp;the momentary elevation of a tyrant,
                Silvanus, and still&nbsp;more the inroads of Franks and Alemanni, had
                excited&nbsp;alarm. But Julian’s successes during the next five years&nbsp;were such
                as to arouse the jealous fears of Constantius.&nbsp;In order to weaken his suspected
                rival the legions under&nbsp;Julian in Gaul were suddenly ordered to march
                eastward&nbsp;against the Persians (360). They refused, and when&nbsp;the order was
                repeated replied by proclaiming Julian&nbsp;himself emperor and Augustus. Julian,
                with probably&nbsp;sincere reluctance, accepted the position, but the death
                of&nbsp;Constantius in 361 saved the empire from the threatened&nbsp;civil war. The
                chief importance of the career of Julian,&nbsp;both as Cæsar in Gaul from 355 to 361
                and during his&nbsp;brief tenure of sole power (361-363), lies, so far as
                the&nbsp;general history of the empire is concerned, in his able&nbsp;defence of the
                Rhine frontier and in his Persian campaign ;&nbsp;for his attempted restoration of
                pagan and in especial of&nbsp;Hellenic worships had no more permanent effect
                than&nbsp;the war which he courageously waged against the multitudinous abuses which
                had grown up in the luxurious&nbsp;court of Constantius.@@<sup>1</sup> But his
                vigorous administration in&nbsp;Gaul undoubtedly checked the barbarian advance
                across the&nbsp;Rhine, and postponed the loss of the Western provinces,&nbsp;while,
                on the contrary, his campaign in Persia, brilliantly successful at first, resulted
                in his own death, and&nbsp;in the immediate surrender by his successor Jovian of
                the&nbsp;territories beyond the Tigris won by Diocletian seventy&nbsp;years before.
                Julian died on June 26, 363, his successor Jovian on February 17, 364; and on the
                26th of&nbsp;February Valentinian was acknowledged as emperor by&nbsp;the army at
                Nicæa. In obedience to the expressed wish&nbsp;of the soldiers that he should
                associate a colleague with&nbsp;himself, he conferred the title of Augustus upon
                his&nbsp;brother Valens, and the long-impending division of the&nbsp;empire was at
                last effected,—Valentinian became emperor&nbsp;of the West, Valens of the East. From
                364 till his&nbsp;death in 375 the vigour and ability of Valentinian&nbsp;kept his
                own frontier of the Rhine tolerably intact,&nbsp;and prevented any serious disasters
                on the Danube. But&nbsp;his death, which deprived the weaker Valens of a
                trusted&nbsp;counsellor and ally, was followed by a crisis on the&nbsp;Danube, more
                serious than any which had occurred there&nbsp;since the defeat of Decius. In 376
                the Goths, hard&nbsp; pressed by their new foes from the eastward, the
                Huns,&nbsp;sought and obtained the protection of the Roman empire.&nbsp;They were
                transported across the Danube and settled in&nbsp;Mcesia, but, indignant at the
                treatment they received, they&nbsp;rose in arms against their protectors. In 378 at
                Hadrian-ople Valens was defeated and killed ; the victorious Goths&nbsp;spread with
                fire and sword over Illyricum, and advanced&nbsp;eastward to the very walls of
                Constantinople. Once&nbsp;more, however, the danger passed away. The skill
                and&nbsp;tact of Theodosius, who had been proclaimed emperor of the&nbsp;East by
                Gratian, conciliated the Goths ; they were granted&nbsp;an allowance, and in large
                numbers entered the service of&nbsp;the Roman emperor. The remaining years of
                Theodosius’s&nbsp;reign (382-395) were mainly engrossed by the duty which&nbsp;now
                devolved upon the emperor of the East of upholding&nbsp;the increasingly feeble
                authority of his colleague in the&nbsp;West against the attacks of pretenders.
                Maximus, the&nbsp;murderer of Gratian (383), was at first recognized
                by&nbsp;Theodosius as Cæsar, and left in undisturbed command of&nbsp;Gaul, Spain,
                and Britain ; but, when in 386 he proceeded&nbsp;to oust Valentinian II. from Italy
                and Africa, Theodosius&nbsp;marched westward, crushed him, and installed
                Valentinian</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">as emperor of the West. In the very next year, however, the murder of
                Valentinian (392) by Arbogast, a Frank,&nbsp;was followed by the appearance of a
                fresh tyrant in the&nbsp;person of Eugenius, a domestic officer and nominee of
                Arbogast himself. Once more Theodosius marched westward,&nbsp;and near Aquileia
                decisively defeated his opponents. But&nbsp;his victory was quickly followed by his
                own illness and&nbsp;death (395), and the fortunes of East and West passed&nbsp;into
                the care of his two sons Arcadius and Honorius.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">(ό) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">From the
                Heath of Theodosius to the Extinction of the Western Empire</span><span
                class="font1"> (395-476).—Through more than a&nbsp;century from the accession of
                Diocletian the Roman&nbsp;empire had succeeded in holding at bay the
                swarming&nbsp;hordes of barbarians. But, though no province had yet&nbsp;been lost,
                as Dacia had been lost in the century before,&nbsp;and though the frontier lines of
                the Rhine and the Danube&nbsp;were still guarded by Roman forts and troops, there
                were&nbsp;signs in plenty that a catastrophe was at hand.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">From all the writers who deal with the 4th century comes the same
                tale of declining strength and energy.&nbsp;From Lactantius to Zosimus we have one
                long series of&nbsp;laments over the depression and misery of the provinces.&nbsp;To
                meet the increased expenditure necessary to maintain&nbsp;the legions, to pay the
                hosts of officials, and to keep up&nbsp;the luxurious splendour of the imperial
                courts, not only&nbsp;were the taxes raised in amount, but the most
                oppressive&nbsp;and inquisitorial methods were adopted in order to secure&nbsp;for
                the imperial treasury every penny that could be&nbsp;wrung from the wretched
                taxpayer. The results are seen&nbsp;in such pictures as that which the panegyrist
                Eumenius @@<sup>2&nbsp;</sup>draws of the state of Gaul (306-312) under Constantine,
                in the accounts of the same province under Julian&nbsp;fifty years later, in those
                given by Zosimus early in the&nbsp;5th century, and in the stringent regulations of
                the&nbsp;Theodosian code, dealing with the assessment and collection of the taxes.
                Among the graver symptoms of&nbsp;economic ruin were the decrease of population,
                which&nbsp;seriously diminished not only the number of taxpayers,&nbsp;but the
                supply of soldiers for the legions ;@@<sup>3</sup> the spread of&nbsp;infanticide ;
                the increase of waste lands whose owners and&nbsp;cultivators had fled to escape the
                tax collector ; the&nbsp;declining prosperity of the towns ; and the
                constantly&nbsp;recurring riots and insurrections, both among
                starving&nbsp;peasants, as in Gaul,@@<sup>4</sup> and in populous cities like
                    Antioch.@@<sup>5&nbsp;</sup>The distress was aggravated by the civil wars, by
                the&nbsp;rapacity of tyrants, such as Maxentius and Maximus, but&nbsp;above all by
                the raids of the barbarians, who seized every&nbsp;opportunity afforded by the
                dissensions or incapacity of&nbsp;the emperors to cross the frontiers and harry the
                lands of&nbsp;the provincials. Constantine (306-312), Julian (356-360),&nbsp;and
                Valentinian I. (364-375) had each to give a temporary&nbsp;breathing space to Gaul
                by repelling the Franks and&nbsp;Alemanni. Britain was harassed by Picts and Scots
                from&nbsp;the north (367-370), while the Saxon pirates swept the&nbsp;Northern seas
                and the coasts both of Britain and Gaul.&nbsp;On the Danube the Quadi, Sarmatæ, and
                above all the&nbsp;Goths, poured at intervals into the provinces of
                Pannonia&nbsp;and Mœsia, and penetfated to Macedon and Thrace. In&nbsp;the East, in
                addition to the constant border feud with&nbsp;Persia, we hear of ravages by the
                Isaurian mountaineers,&nbsp;and by a new enemy, the
            Saracens.@@<sup>6</sup></span></p>
