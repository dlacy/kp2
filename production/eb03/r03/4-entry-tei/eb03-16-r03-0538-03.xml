<p><label>ROYAL</label>
fomething belonging to a king : thus we ſay, royal family, royal affent, royal exchange, &amp;c.</p><p><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="smallcaps"> Roυal Family.</hi></hi> The firſt and moſt conſiderable branch of the king’s royal family, regarded by the laws of England, is the queen.</p><p>I. The queen of England is either queen <hi rend="italic">regent,</hi> queen <hi rend="italic">conſort,</hi> or queen <hi rend="italic">dowager.</hi> The queen <hi rend="italic">regent,, regnant,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ſovereign,</hi> is ſhe who holds the crown in her own right ; as the firſt (and perhaps the ſecond) queen Mary, queen Eliſabeth, and queen Anne ; and ſuch a one has the ſame powers, prerogatives, rights», dignities, and duties, as if ſhe had been a king. This-is expreſsly declared by ſtatute I Mar. I. ſt. 3. c. I. But the queen <hi rend="italic">conſort</hi> is the wife of the reigning king ; and ſhe by virtue of her marriage is participant of divers prerogatives above other women.</p><p>And, firſt, ſhe is a public perſon, exempt and diſtinct from the king ; and not, like other married women», ſo cloſely connected as to have loſt all legal or ſeparate exiſtence ſo long as the marriage continues. For the queen is of ability to purchaſe lands and to convey them, to make leaſes, to grant copyholds, and do other acts of ownerſhip, without the concurrence of her lord ; which no other married woman can do : a privilege as old as the Saxon era. She is alſo capable of taking a grant from the king, which no other wife is from her huſhand ; and in this particular ſhe agrees with the <hi rend="italic">au-guβa</hi> or <hi rend="italic">piiſjima regina coηjux divi imperatoris</hi> of the Roman laws ; who, according to Juſtinian, was equally capable of making a grant to, and receiving one from, the emperor. The queen of England hath ſeparate courts and officers diſtinct from the king’s, not only in matters of ceremony, but even of law ; and her attorney and ſolicitor general are entitled to a place within the bar of his majeſty’s courts, together with the king’s counſel. She may likewiſe ſue and be ſued alone, without joining her huſhand. She may alſo have a ſeparate property in goods as well as lands, and ha3 a right to diſpoſe of them by will. In ſhort, ſhe is in all legal proceedings looked upon as a feme ſole, and not as a feme covert ; as a fingle, not as a married woman. For which the reaſon given by Sir Edward Cok⅛ is this : becauſe the wiſdom of the common law would not have the king (whoſe continual care and ſtudy is for the public, and <hi rend="italic">circa ardua regpi')</hi> to be troubled and diſquieted on account of his wife’s domeſtic affairs ; and therefore it veſts in the queen a power of tranſacting her own concerns, without, the intervention of the king, as if ſhe vf⅛5 an unmarried woman.</p><p>The queen hath alſo many exemptions, and minute prerogatives. For inſtance : ſhe pays no toll ; nor is</p>

<p>ſhe liable to any amercement in any court. But in general, unleſs where the law has expreſsly declared her exempted, ſhe is upon the ſame footing with other ſub-jects ; being to all intents and purpoſes the king’s ſubject, and not his equal ; in like manner as in the imperial law, <hi rend="italic">Augujlus legibus ſolutus non eβ.</hi></p><p>The queen hath alſo ſome pecuniary advantages, which form her a diſtinct revenue : as, in the firſt place, ſhe is intitled to an ancient perquiſite called <hi rend="italic">queen-gold,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">aurum regime ;</hi> which is a ιoyal revenue belonging to every queen-conſort during her marriage with the king, and due from every perſon who hath made a voluntary offering or fine to the king, amounting to 10 merks or upwards, for and in conſideration of any privileges, grants, licences, pardons, or other matter of royal favour conferred upon him by the king : and it is due in the proportion to one-tenth part more, over and above the entire offering or fine made to the king, and becomes an actual debt of record to the queen’s majeſty by the mere recording of the fine. As, if rco merks of ſilver be given to the king for liberty to take in mortmain, or to have a fair, market, park, chaſe, or free-warren ; there the queen is intitled to io merks in ſilver, or (what was formerly an equivalent denomination) to one merk in gold, by the name of <hi rend="italic">queen-gold,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">aurum regin'æ.</hi> But no ſuch payment is due for any aids or ſubſidies granted to the king in parliament or convocation ; or for fines impoſed by courts on offenders againſt their will ; nor for voluntary preſents to the king, without any conſideration moving from him to the ſubject ; nor for any ſale or contract whereby the preſent revenues or poſſeſſions of the crown are granted away or diminiſhed.</p><p>The original revenue of our ancient queens, before and ſoon after the conqueſt, ſeems to have conſiſted in certain reſervations or rents out of the demeſne lands of the crown, which were expreſsly appropriated to her majeſty, diſtinct from the king. It is frequent in domeſday book, after ſpecifying the rent due to the crown, to add likewiſe the quantity of gold or other Tenders reſerved to the queen. Theſe were frequently appropriated to particular purpoſes ; to buy wood for her majeſty’s uſe, fo purchaſe oil for lamps, or to fur-niſh her attire from head to foot, which was frequently very coſtly, as one ſingle robe in the fiſth year of Henry II. ſtood the city of London in upwards of 8o pounds : A practice ſomewhat ſimilar to that of the eaſtern countries, where whole cities and provinces were ſpecifically aſſigned to purchaſe particular parts of the queen’s apparel. And for a farther addition to her income, this duty of queen-gold is ſuppoſed to have been originally granted ; thoſe matters of grace and favour, out of which it aroſe, being frequently obtained from the crown by the powerful interceſſion of the queen. There are traces of its payment, though obſcure ones, in the book of domeſday, and in the great pipe-roll of Henry I. In the reign of Henry II. the manner of collecting it appears to have been well underſtood ; and it forms a diſtinct head in the ancient dialogue of the exchequer written in the time of that prince, and uſually attributed to Gervaſe of Tilbury. From that time downwards, it was regularly claimed and enjoyed by all the queen-conſorts of England till the death of Henry VIII. ; though after the acceſſion of the Tudor family, the collecting of it ſeems to have been much neglected : and there being no queen confort afterwards till the acceſſion of James 1. a period of near 6o years, its very nature and quantity then became a matter of doubt ; and being referred by the king to the chief juſtices and chief baron, their report of it was ſo very unfavourable, that his confort queen Anne, though ſhe claimed it, yet never thought proper to exact it. In <hi rend="italic">ιf&gt;3ζ&gt;</hi> <hi rend="sup">11</hi> ^-ar. I. a time fertile of expedients for railing money upon dormant precedents in our old records (of which ſhip-money was a fatal inſtance), the king, at the petition of his queen Henrietta Maria, iffued out his writ for levying it ; but afterwards purchaſed it of his confort at the price of 10,000 pounds ; finding it, perhaps, too trifling and troubleſome to levy. And when afterwards, at the Reſtoration, by the abolition of military tenures, and the fines that were conſequent upon them, the little that legally remained of this revenue was reduced to almoſt nothing at all ; in vain did Mr Prynne, by a treatiſe that does honour to his abilities as a painful and judicious antiquarian, endeavour to excite queen Catherine to revive this antiquated claim.</p><p>Another ancient perquiſite belonging to the queen confort, mentioned by all our old writers, and therefore only worthy notice, is this : that on the taking a whale on the coaſts, which is a royal fiſh, it ſhall be divided between the king and queen ; the head only being the king’s property, and the tail of it the queen’s. <hi rend="italic">De flurgione obſervetur, quod rex ilium babebit integrum : de balena vero ſujſidt, fi rex habeat caput, et regina cau-dam.</hi> The reaſon of this whimſical diviſion, as aſſigned by our ancient records, was, to furniſh the queen’s wardrobe with whale-bone.</p><p>But farther: though the queen is in all.reſpects a ſubject, yet,· in point of the ſecurity ef her life and perſon, ſhe is put upon the ſame footing with the king. It is equally treaſon (by the ſtatute 25 Edward III.) to imagine or compaſs the death of our lady the king’s companion, as of the king himſelf ; and to violate or defile the queen confort, amounts to the ſame high crime ; as well in the perſon committing the fact, as in the queen herſelf if conſenting. A law of Henry VIII. made it treaſon alſo for any woman who was not a virgin, to marry the king without informing him thereof: but this law was ſoon after repealed ; it treſpaſſing too ſtrongly, as well on natural juſtice as female modeſty. If however the queen be accuſed of any ſpecies of treaſon, ſhe ſhall (whether confort or dowager) be tried by the peers of parliament, as queen Ann Boleyn was in 28 Hen. VIII.</p><p>The huſhand of a queen regnant, as prince George of Denmark was to queen Anne, is her ſubject ; and may be guilty of high treaſon againſt her : but, in the inſtance of conjugal fidelity, he is not ſubjected to the ſame penal reſtrictions. For which the reaſon ſeems to be, that if a queen confort is unfaithful to the royal bed, this may debaſe or baſtardize the heirs to the crown ; but no ſuch danger can be conſequent on the infidelity of the huſhand to a queen regnant.</p><p>2. A queen <hi rend="italic">dowager</hi> is the widow of the king, and as ſuch enjoys moſt of the privileges belonging to her as queen confort. But it is not high treaſon to con-ſpire her death, or to violate her chaſtity ; for the ſame reaſon as was before alleged, becauſe the ſucceſſion to the crown is not thereby endangered. Yet ſtill, <hi rend="italic">pro</hi></p>

<p><hi rend="italic">d!gnitate regali,</hi> no man can marry a queen-dowager without ſpecial licence from the king, on pain of forfeiting his lands and goods. "This Sir Edward Coke tells us, was enacted in parliament in 6 Henry VI. though the ſtatute be not in print. But ſhe, though an alien born, ſhall ſtill be entitled to dower after the king’s demiſe, which no other alien is. A queen-dowager when married again to a ſubject, doth not loſe her regal dignity,, as peereffes-dowager do when they marry commoners. For Katharine, queen dowager of Henry V. though ſhe married a private gentleman, Owen ap Meredith ap Theodore, commonly called <hi rend="italic">Owen Tudor;</hi> yet, by the name of <hi rend="italic">Katharine queen of England,</hi> maintained an action againſt the biſhop of Carliſle. And ſo the dowager of Navarre marrying with Edmond the brother of king Edward I. maintained an action of dower by the name of <hi rend="italic">queen oſ Navarre.</hi></p><p>3. The prince of Wales, or heir apparent to the crow <hi rend="sup">r</hi> n, and alſo his royal conſort, and the princeſs royal, or eldeſt daughter oſ the king, are likew <hi rend="sup">r</hi> ife peculiarly regarded by the laws. For, by ſtatute 2 ç Edw. III. to compaſs or conſpire the death of the former, or to violate the chaſtity of either of the latter, are as much high treaſon as to conſpire the death of the king, or violate the chaſtity of the queen. And this upon the ſame reaſon as was before given ; becauſe the prince of Wales is next in ſucceſſion to the erow <hi rend="sup">r</hi> 11, and to violate his wife might taint the blood-royal with baſtardy ; and the eldeſt daughter of the king is alſo alone inheritable to the crown on failure of ilfue male, and therefore more reſpected by the laws than any of her younger fiſters ; rnſomuch that upon_ this, united with other (feodal) principles, while our military tenures were in force, the king might levy an aid for marrying his eldeſt daughter, and her only. The heir apparent to the crown is uſually made prince of Wales and earl of Cheſter, by ſpecial creation and inveſtiture ; but being the king’s eldeſt ſon, he is by inheritance duke of Cornwall, w <hi rend="sup">r</hi> ithout any new creation.</p><p>4. The reſt of the royal family may be conſidered in two different lights, according to the different ſenſes in which the term <hi rend="italic">royal family</hi> is uſed. Ί lie larger ſenſe includes all thoſe who are by any pofſibility inheritable to the crown. Such, before the revolution, were all the deſeendants of William the Conqueror ; who had branched into an amazing extent by intermarriages w <hi rend="sup">,</hi> ith the ancient nobility. Since the revolution and act of ſettlement, it means the Proteſtant j iſſue of the princeſs Sophia 3 now comparatively few in number, but which in proceſs of time may poſſibly be as largely diſſuſed. The more confined ſenſe includes only thoſe who are in a certain degree of propinquity to the reigning prince, and to whom therefore the law pays an extraordinary regard and relpect ; but after that degree is paſt, they fall into the rank of ordinary ſubjects, and are ſeldom conſidered any farther, unleſs, called to the ſucceſſion upon failure of the nearer lines. For though collateral conſanguinity is regarded indefinitely with reſpect to inheritance or ſueceſſion, yet it is and can only be regarded within ſome certain limits in any other reſpect, by the natural conſtitution of things and the dictates of pofitive law <hi rend="sup">r</hi> .</p><p>The vounger fons∙ and daughters of the king, and</p><p>other branches or the royal family, who are not in the immediate line of ſucceſſion, were therefore little farther regarded by the ancient law, than to give them a certain degree of precedence before all peers and public officers as vzell ecclefiaſtical as temporal. This is done by the ſtatute 31 Henry VIII. c. 10. which enacts, that no perfon except the king’s children ſhall preſume to fix or have place at the fide of the cloth of eſtate in the parliament chamber ; and that certain great officers therein named ſhall have precedence above all dukes, except only ſuch as ſhall happen to be the king’s ſon, brother, uncle, nephew (which Sir Edward Coke explains to fignify grandſon or <hi rend="italic">nePos),</hi> or brother’s or filler’s ſon. But under the deſeription of the king’s <hi rend="italic">children,</hi> his <hi rend="italic">grandſons</hi> are held to be included, without having recourſe to Sir Edward Coke’s interpretation of <hi rend="italic">nephew ;</hi> and. therefore when his late majeſty king George II. created his grandſon Edward, the ſecond ſon of Frederick prince of Wale« deceaſed, duke of York, and referred it to the houſe of lords to fettle his place and precedence, they certified that he ought to have precedence next to the late duke of Cumberland, the then king’s youngeſt ſon ; and that he might have a ſeat on the left hand oſ the cloth of eſtate. But when, on the acceſſion of his preſent majefty <hi rend="sub">r</hi> theſe royal perſonages ceaſed to take place as the <hi rend="italic">children,</hi> and ranked only as the <hi rend="italic">brother</hi> and <hi rend="italic">uncle</hi> of the king, they alſo left their ſeats on the fide of the cloth of eſtate ; ſo that when the duke of Glouceſter, his majeſty’s ſecond brother, took his ſeat in the houſe of peers, he was placed on the upper end of the earls bench (on which the dukes uſually fit) next to his royal highneſs the duke of York. And in 1717, upon a queſtion referred to all the judges by king George 1. it w <hi rend="sup">,</hi> as reſolved, by the opinion of ten againſt the other two, that the education and care of all the king’s grandchildren, while minors, did belong of right to his majeſty as king of this realm, even during their father’s life. But they all agreed, that the care and approbation of their marriages, when grown up, belonged to the king their grandfather. And the judges have more recently concurred in opinion, that this care and approbation extend alſo to the preſumptive heir of the crown; though to what other branches oſ the royal family the ſame did extend, they did not find preciſely determined. The moſt frequent inſtances of the crown’s interpofition go no farther than nephews and nieces ; but examples are not w <hi rend="sup">,</hi> anting of its reaching to more diftant collaterals. And the ſtatute 6 Henry VI. before mentioned, which prohibits the marriage of a queen-dovzager without the conſent of the king, aſſigns this reaſon for it ; “ becauſe the diſparagement of the c,ueen ſhall give greater comfort and example to other ladies of eſtate, who are of the blood-royal, more lightly to diſparage themſelves.” Therefore by the ſtatute 28 Hen. VIII. c. ’8. (repealed, among other ſtatutes of treaſons, by 1 Edw. VI. c. 12.)· it was made high treaſon for any man to contract marriage with the king’s children or reputed children·, his fiſters or aunts <hi rend="italic">ex parte βaterna,</hi> or the children of his brethren or fillers ; being exactly the fame degrees?to which precedence is allowed by the ſtatute 31 Hen. VIII. before-mentioned And now, by ſtatute 12 Geo. III. c. ιr. no deſeendant of the body of king George II. (other than the iffiιe of prin-ceiſes married into foreign families) is capable of con-</p>

Provided, that ſuch of the ſaid deſeendants as are not above 25, may after a twelvemonth’s notice given to the king’s privy council, contract and ſolernnize marriage without the conſent of the crown ; unleſs both houſes of parliament ſhall, before the expiration of the ſaid year, expreſsly declare their diſapprobation of ſuch intended marriage.
