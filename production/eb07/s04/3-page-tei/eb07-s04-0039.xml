He enjoyed the longest life of all our poets, and died the richest of them, a very few excepted. His plays are printed in three volumes 12mo. See the Biographia Dramatics, vol. i. p. 680.</p><p>SOUTHMOULTON, a markettown, in the hundred of the same name, in the north part of the county of Devon,</p><p>179 miles from London, and twelve miles from Barnstaple. It stands on the river Moule, and contains many good houses, a large and handsome church, a commodious guildhall, and a free grammarschool. The population amounted in 1821 to 3314, and in 1831 to 3826.</p><p>SOUTHWARK, a borough in the county of Surrey, but one of the suburbs of London, being only separated from it by the river Thames. The means of access have been greatly increased by a new bridge, and by the re building of London Bridge. It contains six parishes, and, as to its police, is in a great degree under the control of the magistracy of the city. As it in fact forms a district of the capital, it is described under the head <hi rend="smallcaps">London</hi>.</p><p>SOUTHWELL, a town of the hundred of Thurgarton, in the county of Nottingham, 139 miles from London. It is situated on a pleasing elevation above the plain water ed by the river Trent. The parish church is collegiate, and well endowed, having sixteen prebendaries, besides choristers and singing boys. The chapter has jurisdiction over twentyeight parishes. Its house was erected in 1377, and its library rebuilt in 1784. There are remains of an old palace belonging to the archbishops of York, with a beautiful walk on the north side of the church. There is a wellendowed and wellconducted free grammarschool, and a good market on Saturday. The inhabitants amount ed in 1801 to 2305, in 1811 to 2674, in 1821 to 3051, and in 1831 to 3834.</p><p>SOUTHWOLD, a seaport town of the hundred of Blything, in the county of Suffolk, 105 miles from London. It is situated on the river Blythe. It is connected with the port of Yarmouth, but has a corporation of its own. The herringfishery is extensively carried on in it, and of late years it has been resorted to for seabathing. The inhabitants amounted in 1821 to 1676, and in 1831 to 1875.</p><p>SOVEREIGN, in matters of government, is applied to the supreme magistrate or magistrates of an independent government or state ; because their authority is only bound ed by the laws of God and the laws of the state : such are kings, princes, &amp;c.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sovereign Power,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Sovereignty,</hi> is the power of making or sanctioning laws ; for wherever that power resides, all others must conform to it, and be directed by it, what ever appearance the outward form and administration of the government may assume. For it is at any time in the op tion of the legislature to alter that form and administration by a new edict or rule, and to put the execution of the laws into whatever hands it pleases ; and all the other powers of the state must obey the legislative power in the execution of their several functions, or else the constitution is at an end. In our constitution the law ascribes to the king the attribute of sovereignty ; but that is to be understood in a qualified sense ; that is, he is supreme magistrate, not sole legislator, as the legislative power is vested in the king, lords, and commons, not in any of the three estates alone.</p><p>SOZOMENUS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Hermias,</hi> an ecclesiastical historian of the fifth century, was born at Gaza or Bethelia, in Pales tine. He was educated for the law, and became a pleader at Constantinople. He wrote an abridgment of Ecclesiastical History, in two books, from the ascension of our</p><p>Saviour to the year 323. This compendium is lost ; but a continuation of it in nine books, written at greater length, down to the year 439, is still extant. He seems to have copied Socrates, who wrote a history of the same period. The style of Sozomenus is perhaps more elegant ; but in other respects he falls far short of that writer, displaying throughout his whole book an amazing credulity, and a su perstitious attachment to monks and the monastic life. His work, with those of Eusebius and Socrates, was published by R. Stephanus in 1544, by H. Valesius at Paris in 1668, and by Reading at Cambridge in 1720. All these editions are in folio. Several others have likewise appeared.</p><p>SPA, a town of the Netherlands, in the province of Liege and arrondissement of Verviers. It is one of the oldest, and was the most frequented, of the continental wa tering places. Its name has become generic for similar springs. It is situated in a narrow valley watered by a rapid and clear brook. The town consists of detached houses of all sizes, appropriate to the circumstances of the several classes of visitors.</p><p>The most remarkable waters are, 1. The Pouhon, situated in the middle of the town, which is more strongly im pregnated with steel than the others ; 2. The Sauveniere, a mile and a half east from it ; 3. Groisbeck, near to the Sauveniere ; 4. Tonnelet, situated a little to the left of the road which leads to the Sauveniere ; 5. Geronstere, two miles south from Spa ; 6. Wartroz, near to the Tonnelet ∣ 7. Sarts or Niveset, in the district of Sarts ; 8. Chevron or Bru, in the principality of Slavelot; 9. Couve; 10. Be verse ; 11. Sige ; 12. Geremont. These four last are near Malmedy.</p><p>Dr Brownrigg was the first person who discovered that carbonic acid gas forms a principal ingredient in the composition of the Spa waters, and actually separated a quan tity of this elastic fluid, by exposing it to different degrees of heat from 110° to 170° of Fahrenheit. From twenty ounces seven drams and fourteen grains apothecaries' weight of the Pouhon water, he obtained eight ounces two drams and fifty grains.</p><p>The Spa waters are diuretic, and sometimes purgative. They exhilarate the spirits ; and are more cooling, and allay thirst more effectually, than common water. They are found beneficial in cases of weakness and relaxation, either partial or universal ; in nervous disorders ; in ob structions of the liver and spleen ; in cases where the blood is too thin and putrescent ; in cases of excessive discharges proceeding from weakness ; in the gravel and stone ; and in most cases where a strengthening remedy is wanted. But they are hurtful in confirmed obstructions attended with fever, where there is no free outlet to the matter, as in ulcerations of the lungs. They are also injurious to bilious and plethoric constitutions, when used before the body is cooled by proper evacuations.</p><p>Spa was more fashionable formerly than it is at present. There are in it manufactures of iron, wood, and gilt toys. The resident inhabitants are about 3300.</p><p>SPACAFORNO, a city of the island of Sicily, in the province of Noto. It stands in a healthy situation on a hill, near the seaports of La Marza, and Santa Maria. It contains 8100 inhabitants, employed in various trades. Near to it is the Troglodyte town of Ispica, where the houses are excavated in calcareous rocks on both sides of a narrow val ley.</p><p>SPAGIRIC <hi rend="smallcaps">Art</hi> a name given by old authors to that species of chemistry which works on metals, and is employed in the search of the philosopher’s stone.</p><p>SPAHIS, horsemen in the Ottoman array, chiefly raised in Asia. The great strength of the grand signior's army formerly consisted in the janisaries, who were the foot, and the spahis, who were the cavalry.</p></body></text></TEI>
