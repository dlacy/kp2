<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ing days of the month are variously given as his birthday ; all that is certain is that he was christened on the 22d.&nbsp;The ceremony was at that time often, though not invariably,&nbsp;performed on the day of birth. Racine belonged to a&nbsp;family of the upper bourgeoisie, which had indeed been&nbsp;technically ennobled some generations earlier and bore&nbsp;the punning arms of a rat and a swan </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(rat, cygne).</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> The&nbsp;poet himself subsequently dropped the rat. His family&nbsp;were connected with others of the same or a slightly&nbsp;higher station in La Ferté and its neighbourhood,—the&nbsp;Des Moulins, the Sconins, the Yitarts, all of whom appear&nbsp;in Racine’s life. His mother was Jeanne Sconin. His&nbsp;father, of the same name as himself, was only four-and-twenty at the time of the poet’s birth. He seems to have&nbsp;been a solicitor (;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">procureur</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">) by profession, and held, as his&nbsp;father, the grandfather of the dramatist, had done, the&nbsp;office of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">controleur au grenier à sel.</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> Racine was the eldest&nbsp;child of his parents. Little more than a year afterwards&nbsp;his sister Marie was born and his mother died. Jean&nbsp;Racine the elder married again, but three months later&nbsp;he himself died and the stepmother is never heard of in&nbsp;connexion with the poet or his sister. They were left&nbsp;without any provision, but their grandparents, Jean Racine&nbsp;the eldest and Marie des Moulins, were still living, and&nbsp;took charge of them. These grandparents had a daughter,&nbsp;Agnes, who figures in Racine’s history. She was a nun of&nbsp;Port Royal under the style of Mère de Sainte Thècle, and&nbsp;the whole family had strong Jansenist leanings. Jean&nbsp;Racine the eldest died in 1649, and, apparently as a consequence of this, the poet was sent to the Collège de&nbsp;Beauvais. This (which was the grammar-school of the&nbsp;town of that name, and not the famous Collège de Beauvais&nbsp;at Paris) was intimately connected with Port Royal, and&nbsp;to this latter place Racine was transferred in November&nbsp;1655.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His special masters there were Nicole and Le</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Maître. The latter, in an extant letter written to his pupil during one of the gusts of persecution which Port&nbsp;Royal constantly suffered, speaks of himself as “votre&nbsp;papa ” ; the manner in which Racine repaid this affection&nbsp;will be seen shortly. It is evident from documents that&nbsp;he was a very diligent student both at Beauvais and Port&nbsp;Royal. He wrote verse both in Latin and French, and&nbsp;his Port Royal odes, which it has been the fashion with&nbsp;the more fanatical admirers of his later poetry to ridicule,&nbsp;are far from despicable. They show the somewhat garrulous nature-worship of the Pléiade tempered by the&nbsp;example of the earlier school of Malherbe. He seems&nbsp;also to have made at least a first draft of his version of&nbsp;the breviary hymns ; some, if not most, of a considerable&nbsp;mass of translations from the classics and annotations on&nbsp;them must also date from this time. Racine stayed at&nbsp;Port Royal for three years, and left it, aged nearly nineteen,&nbsp;in October 1658. He was then entered at the Collège&nbsp;d’Harcourt and boarded with his second cousin, Nicolas&nbsp;Vitart, steward of the duke of Luynes. Later, if not at&nbsp;first, he lived in the Hôtel de Luynes itself. It is to be&nbsp;observed that his Jansenist surroundings’ continued with&nbsp;him here, for the duke of Luynes was a severe Port Royalist.&nbsp;It is, however, clear from Racine’s correspondence, which&nbsp;as we have it begins in 1660 and is for some years very&nbsp;abundant and interesting, that he was not at all of an&nbsp;austere disposition at this time. His chief correspondent&nbsp;is a certain young abbé Le Vasseur, who seems to have&nbsp;been by no means seriously given. The letters are full&nbsp;of verse-making and of other diversions ; a certain Mademoiselle Lucrèce, who seems to have been both amiable&nbsp;and literary, is very frequently mentioned, neither is she&nbsp;the only one of her sex who appears. Occasionally the&nbsp;liveliness of the letters passes the bounds of strict decency, though there is nothing very shocking in them.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Those to Madame (or, as the habit of the time called her, Mademoiselle) Yitart are free from anything of this kind,&nbsp;while they are very lively and pleasant. It does not&nbsp;appear that Racine read much philosophy, as he should&nbsp;have done, but he occasionally did some business in superintending building operations at Chevreuse, the duke’s&nbsp;country house. He would seem, however, to have been&nbsp;already given up irrevocably to literature. This by no&nbsp;means suited the views of his devout relations at Port&nbsp;Royal, and he complains in one of his letters that an&nbsp;unlucky sonnet on Mazarin had brought down on him&nbsp;“ excommunications sur excommunications.” But he had&nbsp;much more important works in hand than sonnets. The&nbsp;marriage of Louis XIV. ־was the occasion of an ambitious&nbsp;ode, “La Nymphe de la Seine,” which was submitted&nbsp;before publication to Chapelain, the too famous author of&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pucelle.</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> Chapelain’s fault was not ill-nature, and he&nbsp;made many suggestions (including the very pertinent one&nbsp;that Tritons were not usually found in rivers), which Racine&nbsp;duly adopted. Nor did the ode bound his ambitions, for&nbsp;he finished one piece, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Amasie,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> and undertook another, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Les&nbsp;Amours d’Ovide,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> for the theatre. The first, however, was&nbsp;rejected by the actors of the Marais, and it is not certain&nbsp;that the other was ever finished or offered to those of the&nbsp;Hôtel de Bourgogne. Racine’s letters show that he was&nbsp;intimate with more than one actress at this time ; he also&nbsp;made acquaintance with La Fontaine, and the foundations&nbsp;at any rate of the legendary “ society of four ” (Boileau,&nbsp;La Fontaine, Molière, and Racine) were thus laid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">His relations were pretty certainly alarmed by this very pardonable worldliness, though a severe expostulation with&nbsp;him for keeping company with the abominable actors is&nbsp;perhaps later in date. Allusions in a letter to his sister&nbsp;leave little doubt of this. Racine was accordingly disturbed&nbsp;in his easy-going life at Paris. In November 1661 he&nbsp;went to Uzès in Languedoc to live with his uncle the Père&nbsp;Sconin, vicar-general of that diocese, where it was hoped&nbsp;that Sconin would be able to secure a benefice for his&nbsp;nephew. It is certain that he was not slack in endeavouring to do this, but his attempts were in vain, and perhaps&nbsp;the church did not lose as much as the stage gained.&nbsp;Racine was at Uzès for an uncertain time. All that is&nbsp;known is that he was back in Paris before the end of&nbsp;1663. His letters from Uzès to La Fontaine, to Le Vasseur, and others are in much the same strain as before,&nbsp;but there is here and there a marked tone of cynicism in&nbsp;them. One passage in particular, in which he tells how&nbsp;he was disenchanted with a damsel of Uzès, has an unpleasantly Swiftian touch about it. Once back in Paris,&nbsp;he gave himself up entirely to letters with a little courtier-sliip. An ode on the recovery of Louis XIV. from a slight&nbsp;illness probably secured him the promise of a pension, of&nbsp;which he speaks to his sister in the summer of 1664, and&nbsp;on 2 2d August he actually received it. It is uncertain&nbsp;whether this pension is identical with “gratifications”&nbsp;which we know that Racine for some years received and&nbsp;which were sometimes eight and sometimes six hundred&nbsp;livres. It would seem not, as one of these gratifications&nbsp;had been allotted to him the year before he so wrote to&nbsp;his sister. All this shows that he had already acquired&nbsp;some repute as a promising novice in letters, though he&nbsp;had as yet done nothing substantive. The ode in which&nbsp;he thanked the king for his presents, “ La Renommée,” is&nbsp;said to have introduced him to Boileau, to whose censorship there is no doubt that he owed much, if not everything; and from this date, November 1663, the familiarity&nbsp;of “ the four ” undoubtedly existed in full force. Racine&nbsp;was at the time the least distinguished, but he rapidly&nbsp;equalled, if not the merit, the reputation of his friends.&nbsp;Unfortunately it is precisely at this date that his corre-</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
