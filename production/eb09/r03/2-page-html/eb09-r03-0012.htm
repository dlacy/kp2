        <p><span class="font1">mancipation was unnecessary for carrying the property (and, as some

                the copper and the scales for imposing upon the&nbsp;vendor an obligation of
                warranty against eviction, defects, and so&nbsp;forth. It may be that, until trade
                began to assume considerable&nbsp;proportions, and when a transaction was between
                citizens, a purchaser was content to rely partly on the honesty of his
                vendor,&nbsp;partly on the latter’s knowledge that he ran the risk of an

                on considerations of natural equity. It was the popularization of
                the&nbsp;stipulation that facilitated a further advance, rendered all the&nbsp;more

                from Varro, it&nbsp;was a form of stipulation against eviction that in his time

        <p><span class="font1">We learn from the same writer—what is also indicated in various
                passages of Plautus—that the vendor at the same time and in the&nbsp;body of the
                same stipulation guaranteed that the sheep or cattle&nbsp;he was selling were
                healthy and of a heal thy stock and free from&nbsp;faults, and that the latter had
                not done any mischief for which&nbsp;their owner could be held liable in a noxal
                action ; and similarly&nbsp;that a slave sold was healthy and not chargeable for any
                theft or&nbsp;other offence for which the purchaser might have to answer.
                If&nbsp;any of these guarantees turned out fallacious the purchaser had

                class="font1"> in its original shape was just a simplification&nbsp;of the

                class="font1"> on a vendor’s guarantees ; the stipulations&nbsp;to which we have
                been alluding had become such unfailing accompaniments of a sale as to be matters of
                legal presumption, the&nbsp;result being that the words “ whereas the plaintiff
                </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bought</span><span

                Bekker justifies this by reference to the language of Varro,&nbsp;who seems to

                however, was far from the recognition of sale as a purely consensual
                contract.&nbsp;If the price was not paid at once, the purchaser gave his
                stipulatory&nbsp;promise for it, or got some one on whom the vendor placed
                more&nbsp;reliance to do so for him, or else made a book-debt of it; and, if

                and&nbsp;not by an action on the sale. If the price was paid but the
                thing&nbsp;purchased not delivered, the only remedy open to the purchaser&nbsp;was
                to get back his money by the same condiction, unless, indeed,&nbsp;the guarantee

                breach of&nbsp;some other warranty, was really an action on the verbal contracts

                style="font-style:italic;">strictum fus</span><span class="font1"> action in which
                the judge could not travel beyond the letter of the engagements of
                the&nbsp;purchaser. In the latter years of the republic, and probably from&nbsp;the
                time of Q. Mucius Scsevola, it was a </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">bonae fidei</span><span class="font1"> action.
                How&nbsp;had the change come about ? A single case of hardship may have&nbsp;been
                sufficient to induce it, such as the defeat of a claim for&nbsp;damages for eviction
                on the ground that the stipulatory guarantee&nbsp;had been accidentally overlooked.
                Ulpian says, “ As the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
                >stipulatio&nbsp;duplae</span><span class="font1"> is a thing of universal

                the practice of stipulatory guarantees, for Varro wrote after the time of
                Q.&nbsp;Mucius (who speaks of the action on sale as a </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">bonae fidei</span><span class="font1"> one),
                and&nbsp;references to them are abundant in the pages of the classical
                jurists;&nbsp;but it rendered them in law unnecessary. It made sale a
                purely&nbsp;consensual contract in which, in virtue of the simple agreement
                to&nbsp;buy and sell, all the obligations on either side that usually
                attended&nbsp;it were held embodied without express formulation or (still
                less)&nbsp;stipulatory or literal engagement. And, in instructing the judges&nbsp;to

                equity and common sense&nbsp;ought to influence their judgment, so as to enable them
                freely to do&nbsp;justice between the parties in any and every question that

                to the time of the Pcetilian law loan of money,&nbsp;corn, &amp;c., was usually

                literal&nbsp;contract; and so strictly was it construed that interest on the

                the lender or depositor&nbsp;retained both property and (legal) possession, the
