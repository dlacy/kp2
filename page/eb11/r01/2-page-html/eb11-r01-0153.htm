<p><span class="font1">very different from that of the early and medieval Church. Rationalism within the Christian Church differs, however,&nbsp;from that which is commonly understood by the term, inas-much as it accepts as revealed the fundamental facts of its&nbsp;creed. Thoroughgoing rationalism, on the other hand, cither&nbsp;categorically denies that the supernatural or the infinites—&nbsp;whether it exist or not—can be the object of human knowledge (see Agnosticism), or else, in the mouth of a single person,&nbsp;states that he at least has no such knowledge. In addition&nbsp;to the difficulties presented by the Bible as an historical record,&nbsp;and the literary problems which textual and other critics have&nbsp;investigated, the modern freethinker denies that the Chris-tianity of the New Testament or its interpretation by modern&nbsp;theologians affords a coherent theory of human life and duty.&nbsp;Apart from the general use of the term for a particular attitude&nbsp;towards religion, two more technical uses require notice: (i)&nbsp;the purely philosophical, (ii) the theological.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(i) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philosophical rationalism is that theory of knowledge&nbsp;which maintains that reason is in and by itself a source of&nbsp;knowledge, and that knowledge so derived has superior&nbsp;authority over knowledge acquired through sensation. This&nbsp;view is opposed to the various systems which regard the mind&nbsp;as a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">tabula rasa</span><span class="font1"> (blank tablet) in which the outside world as it&nbsp;were imprints itself through the senses. The opposition between&nbsp;rationalism and sensationalism is, however, rarely so simple&nbsp;and direct, inasmuch as many thinkers </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(e.g.</span><span class="font1"> Locke) have admitted both sensation and reflection. Such philosophies are called rationalist or sensationalist according as they lay emphasis&nbsp;specially on the function of reason or that of the senses. More&nbsp;generally, philosophic rationalism is opposed to empirical&nbsp;theories of knowledge, inasmuch as it regards all true knowledge as deriving deductively from fundamental elementary&nbsp;concepts. This attitude may be studied in Descartes, Leibnitz&nbsp;and Wolff. It is based on Descartes’ fundamental principle&nbsp;that knowledge must be clear, and seeks to give to philosophy&nbsp;the certainty and demonstrative character of mathematics,&nbsp;from the a priori principle of which all its claims are derived.&nbsp;The attack made by David Hume on the causal relation led&nbsp;directly to the new rationalism of Kant, who argued that it&nbsp;was wrong to regard thought as mere analysis. A priori&nbsp;concepts there are, but if they are to lead to the amplification&nbsp;of knowledge, they must be brought into relation with empirical data.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(ii) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term “ rationalism ” in the narrow theological&nbsp;sense is specially used of the doctrines held by a school of&nbsp;German theologians and Biblical scholars which was prominent&nbsp;roughly between 1740 and 1836. This rationalism within the&nbsp;Church was a theological manifestation of the intellectual&nbsp;movement known as the Enlightenment (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Aufklärung</span><span class="font1">)</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">, </span><span class="font1">and&nbsp;must be studied in close connexion with the purely philosophical&nbsp;rationalism already discussed. It owed much to the English&nbsp;deists, to the Pietistic movement, and to the French </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">esprits&nbsp;forts</span><span class="font1"> who had already made a vigorous attack on the supernatural origin of the Scriptures. The crux of the difficulty&nbsp;was the doctrine of the supernatural, the relation between&nbsp;revealed and natural religion. The first great rationalist leader&nbsp;was J. S. Semler (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">q.υ.</span><span class="font1">)</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span class="font1"> who held that true religion springs from&nbsp;the individual soul, and attacked the authority of the Bible in&nbsp;a comprehensive spirit of criticism. He ultimately reached a&nbsp;point at which the Bible became for him simply one of many&nbsp;ancient documents. At the same time he did not impugn the&nbsp;authority of the Church, which he regarded as useful in main-taining external unity. Among those who followed in Semler’s&nbsp;path were Grüner Ernesti, J. D. Michaelis, Griesbach, J. G.&nbsp;Eichhorn. This spirit was exhibited on the philosophical side&nbsp;by Kant who in his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Die Religion innerhalb der Grenzen der&nbsp;blossen Vernunft</span><span class="font1"> (1793) set forth his doctrine of rational&nbsp;morality </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Vernunftglauben)</span><span class="font1"> as the only true religion. These&nbsp;two great rationalist movements, the critical and the philo-sophical, ultimately led to, or were accompanied by, the gradual&nbsp;reduction of religion to a system of morals based at the most&nbsp;on two or three fundamental religious principles. This is the&nbsp;rationalism known as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rationalismus vulgaris,</span><span class="font1"> the period of&nbsp;which is practically from 1800 to 1833. Among its exponents&nbsp;were Wegscheidcr, Bretschneider and H. E. G. Paulus </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(qq.v.).&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">The general attitude of German theology, however, became&nbsp;gradually more and more hostile, and the works of Schleiermacher, though in a sense themselves rationalist, renewed&nbsp;the general desire for a positive Christianity. Hase’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hutterus&nbsp;Redivivus,</span><span class="font1"> an exposition of orthodoxy in the light of modern&nbsp;development, called forth a final exposition of the rationalist&nbsp;position by Röhr. From that time the school as such ceased&nbsp;to have a real existence, though the results of its work are traceable more or less in all modern Biblical criticism, and its&nbsp;influence upon the attitude of modern theologians and Biblical&nbsp;critics can scarcely be overestimated.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">RATISBONNE, LOUIS GUSTAVE FORTUNÉ </span><span class="font1">(1827-1900), French man of letters, was born at Strassburg on the 29th of&nbsp;July 1827. He studied at the school of his native town and at&nbsp;the Collège Henry IV. in Paris. He was connected with the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Journal des Débats</span><span class="font1"> from 1853 to 1876; became librarian of&nbsp;the palace of Fontainebleau in 1871, and three years later to the&nbsp;Senate.

He was literary&nbsp;executor of Alfred de Vigny, whose </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Destinées</span><span class="font1"> (1864) and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Journal&nbsp;d'un poète</span><span class="font1"> (1867) he published.

<p><span class="font1">RATITAE (from Lat. ratis</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span class="font1"> a raft), the name given by B. Merrem </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Abh. Ak.</span><span class="font1"> </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Wiss</span><span class="font1">., Berlin, 1812-1813; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Phys. Kl.,</span><span class="font1"> p. 259) to&nbsp;the “ flat-breasted birds,&quot; in opposition to the Carinatae, or those&nbsp;which normally possess a keeled sternum. In thus dividing the&nbsp;birds into two great equivalent groups, he was followed only&nbsp;by C. L. Nitzsch (1829), T. H. Huxley (1867), P. L. Sclater&nbsp;(1880), A. Newton (1884), R. B. Sharpe (1891), whilst in most&nbsp;of the other numerous classifications the Ratitae (vicariously&nbsp;named Struthiones, Cursores, Brevipennes, Proceres) were&nbsp;treated as of much lower rank.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A diagnosis covering all the Ratitae </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(struthio, rhea, casuarius, drοmaeus, apteryx</span><span class="font1"> and the allied fossils </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">dinornis</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">aepyοrnis)&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">would be as follows—(i) terrestrial birds without keel to the&nbsp;sternum, absolutely flightless; (ii) quadrate bone with a single&nbsp;proximal articulating knob; (iii) coracoid and scapula fused&nbsp;together and forming an open angle; (iv) normally without a&nbsp;pygostyle; (v) with an incisura ischiadica; (vi) rhamphotheca&nbsp;compound; (vii) without apteria or bare spaces in the plumage;&nbsp;(viii) with a complete copulatory organ, moved by skeletal&nbsp;muscles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The separation of the Ratitae from the other birds, and their seemingly fundamental differences, notably the absence of the&nbsp;keel and of the power of flight, induced certain authors to go&nbsp;so far as to derive the Ratitae from the Dinosaurian reptiles,&nbsp;whilst </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Archaeopteryx (q.υ.)</span><span class="font1"> and the Carinatae were supposed to&nbsp;have sprung from some Pterosaurian or similar reptilian stock.&nbsp;Such vagaries require no refutation. But it is quite another&nbsp;question, whether the “ Ratitae ’’ form a natural group. Sir&nbsp;R. Owen was the first </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Comp. Anat. and Physiol. of Vertebrales,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">ii. 1866) to indicate that the various Ratitae might be referable&nbsp;to various natural groups of the Carinatae. A. W.

S.,</span><span class="font1"> 1885,&nbsp;pp. 684-716, pls. lii.-lv.) found vestiges of a keel in a young&nbsp;rhea, and apteria in the embryonic ostrich, and she concluded&nbsp;that they were descendants of birds which originally possessed</span></p><div style="border-right:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
