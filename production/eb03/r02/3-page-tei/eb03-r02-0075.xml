Thus let the edge of the waſteboard be four inches below the ſurface of the water. The cube of this is 64, of which the ſquare root is eight. Therefore a waſteboard of this depth under the ſurface, and three feet long, will diſcharge every ſecond 8×36×ιii cubic inches of water, or ι,Τ cubic feet, Engliſh meaſure.</p><p>The following companions will ſhow how much this theory may be depended on. Col. I. ſhows the depth of the edge of the board under the ſurface ; 2. ſhows the diſcharge by theory ; and, 3. the diſcharge actually obſervecl.

The correſpon-dence is undoubtedly very great. The greateſt error is in the firſt, which may be attributed to a much ſmaller lateral contraction under ſo ſmall a head of water.</p><p>But it muſt be remarked, that the calculation proceeds on two ſuppoſitions. The height FI is ſuppoſed 4 of BI ; arid 2 G is ſuppoſed 726. It is evident, that by increaſing the ope and diminiſhing the other, nearly the ſame anſwers may be produced, unleſs much greater variations of <hi rend="italic">h</hi>  be examined. Both of theſe quantities are matters of conſiderable uncertainty, particularly the firſt ; and it muſt be farther remarked, that this was· cot meaſured, but deduced from the uniformity of the experiments. We preſume that Mr Buat tried various values of G, till he found one which gave the <hi rend="italic">ratios</hi>  oſ diſcharge which he obſerved. We beg leave to obſerve, that in a ſet of numerous experiments which we had ac-ceſs to examine, BI was uniformly much leſs than 4 ; it was very nearly <hi rend="italic">i<hi rend="sub">r</hi>  :</hi>and the quantity diſeharged was greater than what would reſult ſrom Mr Buat’s calculation. It w as farther obſerved, that IF depended very much on the form of the waſteboard. When it was a very thin board of conſiderable depth, IF was very conſiderably greater than if the board was thick, or narrow, and ſet on the top of a broad dam-head, as in fig. χ8. a<hi rend="sup">o</hi>2.</p><p>It may be proper to give the formula a form which will correſpond to any ratio which experience may dif-</p><p>cover between BF and IF- Thus, let BI be — BF.</p><p><hi rend="italic">n</hi></p><p>The formula will be D~-¾-<hi rend="italic">1</hi>  √TG Çi—<hi rend="sup">a</hi></p><p>It is hoped that this and ſome other fundamental facts in practical hydraulics will ſoon be determined by accurate experiments. The Honourable Board for Fiſh</p><lb/><p>erics and Improvements in Scotland have allotted a ſum of money for making the neceſſary experiments, and the reſults will be publiſhed by their authority. Meantime, this theory of Mr de Buat is of great value to the practical engineer, who at preſent muſt content himſelf with a very vague conjecture, or take the calculation of the erronneous theory of Guglielmini. By that theory, the board of three ſeet, at the depth of four inches, ſhould diſcharge nearly 3 -⅛ cubic feet per ſecond, which is almoſt double of what it really delivers.</p><p>We preſume, therefore, that the following table will be acceptable to practical engineers, who are not familiar with ſuch computations. It contains, in the firſt column, the depth in Engliſh inches from the ſurface of the ſtagnant water of a reſervoir to the edge of the waſteboarel. The ſecond column is the cubic feet off water diſeharged in a minute by every inch of the waſte» board.</p><lb/><table><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p><hi rend="italic">Depth.</hi></p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p><hi rend="italic">Diſcharge.</hi></p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>I</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>0,403</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>2</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>1,140</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>3</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>2,095</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>4</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>3&gt;<hi rend="sup">22</hi>5</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>5</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>4√o7</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>6</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>5,9 <hi rend="sup">2</hi> 5</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>7</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>7,466</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>8 »</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>9,122</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>9</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>10,884</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>IO</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>12,74S</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>II</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>14,707</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>12</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>16,758</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>I3</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>18,895</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p><hi rend="sup">1</hi>4</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>21,117</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p><hi rend="smallcaps"><hi rend="sup">i</hi>5</hi></p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>2 3,4<hi rend="sup">1</hi>9</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>16</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>25,800</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>17</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>2-8,2 58</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>18∙</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>30,786</p></cell></row></table><lb/><p>When the depth does not exceed four inches, it will not be exact enough to take proportional parts for the fractions of an inch.

Thus, for 3⅛ inches, take the eighth part of 23,419, which correſponds to 15 inches.
