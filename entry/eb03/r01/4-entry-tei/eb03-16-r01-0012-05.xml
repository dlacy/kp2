<p>of <hi rend="sup">i</hi> the fimplicity of the ſervice inthe royal dock-yards. The Britiſh fleet is accordingly diſtributed into fix rates, excluſive of the inferior veſſels that uſually attend on naval armaments ; as ſloops of war, armed ſhips, bomb-ketches, fire-ſhips and cutters, or ſchooners commanded by lieutenants.</p><p>Ships of the firſt rate mount roo cannon, having 42⅛ pounders on the lower deck, 24-pounders on the middle deck, 12-pounders on the upper deck, and 6-pounders on the quarter-deck and fore-eaſtle. They are manned with 850 men, including their officers, ſeamen, marines, and ſervants.</p><p>In general, the ſhips of every rate, beſides the cap-tain, have the maſter, the boatſwain, the gunner, the chaplain, the purſer, the ſurgeon, aud the carpenter ; all of whom, except the chaplain, have their mates or aſſiſtants, in which are comprehended the ſail-maker, the maſter at arms, the armourer, the captain’s clerk, the gunſmſth, &amp;c.</p><p>The number oſ other officers are always in propor-tion to the rate of the ſhip. Thus a firſt rate has ſix lieutenants, ſix maſter’s mates, twenty-four midſhipmen, and five ſurgeon’s mates, who are conſidered as gentlemen : beſides the following petty officers ; quarter-maſ-ters and their mates, fourteen ; boatſwain’s mates and yeomen, eight ; gunner’s mates and affiſtants, ſix ; quar-ter-gunners, twenty-five ^ carpenter’s mates, two, beſides fourteen aſſiſtants with one ileward,,and ſteward’s mate to the purſer.</p><p>If the dimenfions of all ſhips of the ſame rate were equal, it would be the ſimpleſt and moſt perſpicuous method to collect them into one point of view in a table: but as there is no invariable rule for the general dimen-ſions. we muſt content ourſelves with but a few re-marks on ſhips of each rate, fo as to give a general idea of the difference· between them.</p><p>The victory, one of the laſt built of our firſt rates, is 222 feet 6 inches in length, from the head te the ſtern ; the length of her keel, 151 feet 3 inches; that of her gun-deck, or lower deck, 186 feet ; her ex-treme breadth is 51 feet 10 inches; her- depth in the hold, 21 feet 6 inches ; her burden, 2162 tons; and her poop reaches 6 feet before the mizen-maſt.</p><p>Ships of the ſecond rate cany 90 guns upon three decks, of which thoſe on the lower battery are 32-pounders ; thoſe on the middle, 18-pounders ; on the upper deck, 12-pounders; and thoſe on the quarterdeck, 6-pounders, which uſually amount to four or fiχ <hi rend="sub">i</hi> Their complement of men is .750, in which there are ſix lieutenants, four maſter’s mates, 24 midſhipmen, and four ſurgeon’s mates, 14 quarter-maſters andtheir matcs⅜ eight boatſwain’s mates and yeomen, ſix gunner’s mates and yeomen, with 22 quarter-gunners, two carpenter’s mates,* with 10 aſſiſtants, and one ſteward and ſteward½ mate.</p><p>Ships of the third rate carry from 64 to So cannon, which are 31, 18, and 9 pounders. The 80-gun ſhipe however begin to grow out of repute, and to give way to thoſe of· 74, 70, &amp;c. which have only two whole battcries ; whereas the former have three, with 28 guns planted on each, the cannon of their upper deck being the ſame as thoſe on the quarter-deck and fore-caſtle of the latter, which are 9-pounders. The complement in a 74 is 650, and in a 64, 500 men ; having, in peace, four lieutenants, but in war, five j and-when an admiral</p><p>is aboard, ſix. They have three maſter’s mates, id midſhipmen, three furgeon’s mates, 10 quarter-maſters and their mates, ſix boatſwain’s mates and yeomen, four gunner’s mates and yeomen, with ι3 quarter-gunners, one carpenter’s mate, with eight aſſiſtants, and one ſtew-ard and ſteward’s mate under the purſer.</p><p>Ships of the fourth rate mount from 60 to 50 guns, <hi rend="sup">j</hi> upon two decks, and the quarter-deck. The lower tier is compoſed of 24-pounders, the upper tier of 12-pounders, and the cannon on the quarter-deck and forc-caſtle are 6-pounders. The complement of a 50 gun ſhip is 350 men, in which there are three lieute-nants, two maſter’s mates, 10 midſhipmen, two ſurgeon’s mates, eight quarter-maſters and their mates, four boatſwain’s mates and yeomen, one gunner's mate and onc yeoman, with 12 quarter-gunners, one carpen-ter’s mate and ſix aſſiſtants, and a ſteward and ſteward’s mate.</p><p>All veſſels of war, under the fourth rate, are ufual-ly comprehended under the general name of <hi rend="italic">frigates,</hi> and never appear in the line of battle. They are divided into the 5th and 6th rates ; the former mounting from 40 to 32 guns, and the latter from 28 to 20. The largeſt of the fifth rate have two decks of cannon, the lower battery being of 18-pounders, and that of the upper deck of 9-pounders ; but thoſe of 36 and 32 guns have one complete deck of guns, mounting 12-pounders, beſides the quarter-deck and fore-caſtle, which, carry 6-pounders. Tlie complement of a ſhip of 44 guns is 280 men ; and that of a frigate of 36 guns, 240 men. The firſt has three, and the fecond two, lieutenants ; and both have two maſter’s mates, ſix midſhipmen, two ſurgeon’s mates, ſix quarter-maſters and their mates, two boatſwain’s mates and one yeoman, one gunner’s mate and one yeoman, with 10 or 11 quarter-gunners, and one purſer’s ſteward.</p><p>Frigates of the 6th rate carry 9-pounders, thoſe of 28 guns having 3-pounders on their quarter-deck,-with' 200 men for their complement ; and thofe of 24, 160 men : the former has two lieutenants,- the latter, one ; and both have two maſter’s mates, four - midſhipmen, one ſurgeon's mate, four quarter-maſters and their mates, one boatſwain’s ∙ mate and one yeoman, one gunner’s mate and one yeoman, -with fix or ſeven quarter-gunners, and one purſer’s fteward⅛ -</p><p>The ſloopsi of war carry from 18 to &amp; cannon, the largeſt of which have ſix-pounders y and the ſmalleſt, . viz. thole of 8 or 10 guns, four-pounders. Their offi cers are generally the fame as in the 6th rates, with little variation ; and their-complements of men are from 120 to 60, in proportion' to their force or magnitude. <hi rend="italic">N. B.</hi> Bomb-veſſels are on the ſame eſtabliſhment as ſloops ; but ſire-ſhips and .'hoſpital-ſhips -are on that of fifth rates.

The ſame may be obſerved of the ſixth rates.</p><p>The frigates, which mount from 28 to 38 guns upon one deck, with the quarter-deck, are extremely proper for cruizing againſt privateers, or for ſhort expeditions, being "light, long, and uſually excellent ſailors.</p>
