<p><span class="font1">occasion of the visit of the prince of Wales in 1906, is quite the finest in the East. There are two cathedrals, Church of England&nbsp;and Roman Catholic, and a Presbyterian church, besides the&nbsp;cantonment church buildings for worship. Religious buildings&nbsp;and lands, indeed, occupy an area in Rangoon out of all proportion to its size. Buddhists, Hindus, Mussulmans, Parsees,&nbsp;Armenians and Jews all own lands and pagodas, temples,&nbsp;mosques, churches and synagogues. The Buddhist monasteries,&nbsp;in particular, occupy wide spaces in very central portions of the&nbsp;town and cantonments. Burial-grounds are equally extensive,&nbsp;and exist in every direction in what were once the outskirts, but&nbsp;are now fast becoming central parts of the city. The chief&nbsp;educational institutions are the Government Rangoon college,&nbsp;the Baptist college and St John’s college (S.P.G.). Besides the&nbsp;general hospital, a female hospital in connexion with the Dufferin&nbsp;Fund has recently been built, and there are hospitals for con-tagious diseases and for lepers in the suburbs. The staple&nbsp;industries are mills for husking rice and for sawing timber, and&nbsp;petroleum refineries. Carving in wood and ivory, and embossed&nbsp;silverwork are also carried on. There are three municipal and&nbsp;eight private markets, which are being improved and extended.&nbsp;Everything, from sacking to jewelry, is sold in them. The&nbsp;introduction of pure water and the establishment of compulsory&nbsp;vaccination have greatly improved the health of Rangoon. But&nbsp;the death-rate is still high, due partly to the swampy nature of&nbsp;the outskirts of the city proper, and still more to the mortality&nbsp;among Hindu immigrants from the Madras presidency. The&nbsp;total rainfall in 1905 was 104·96 in. Rangoon is the headquarters of a brigade in the Burma command of the Southern&nbsp;army.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(J. G. Sc.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RANGPUR, or Rungpore, a town and district of British India, in the Rajshahi division of Eastern Bengal and Assam.&nbsp;The town is situated on the little river Ghaghat. Pop. (1901)&nbsp;15,960. There are a high school, a normal school and an&nbsp;industrial school. The earthquake of the 12th of June 1897&nbsp;destroyed many of the public buildings and diverted the&nbsp;drainage channels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The District of Rangpur, with an area of 3493 sq. m., is one vast plain. The greater part of it, particularly towards&nbsp;the east, is inundated during the rains, and the remainder is&nbsp;traversed by a network of streams which frequently break&nbsp;through their sandy banks and plough for themselves new&nbsp;channels over the fields. The river system is constituted by&nbsp;the Brahmaputra and its tributaries, chief of which are the&nbsp;Tista, Dharla, Sankos and Dudhkumar. The climate is&nbsp;generally malarious, owing to the numerous stagnant swamps&nbsp;and marshes filled with decaying vegetable matter. The annual&nbsp;rainfall averages 82 in. About three-fourths of the district&nbsp;is under continuous cultivation. Spare land can hardly be&nbsp;said to exist—even the patches of waste land yield a valuable&nbsp;tribute of reeds and cane. The staple crops are rice, oil-seeds,&nbsp;jute and tobacco. In 1901 the population was 2,154,181,&nbsp;showing an increase of 4.3 % in the decade. Nearly two-thirds&nbsp;are Mahommedans. The Eastern Bengal railway has two&nbsp;branches, one of which crosses the district to the Brahmaputra,&nbsp;and the other runs north towards Assam.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The tract comprised within the district of Rangpur was formerly the western outpost of the ancient Hindu kingdom of Kamrup, which appears to have attained its greatest power and&nbsp;prosperity under Raja Nilambar, who was treacherously overthrown by Ala-uddin Hosain of Bengal at the close of the 15th&nbsp;century. Rangpur passed to the East India Company in 1765&nbsp;under the firman of the emperor Shah Alam. Since then a great&nbsp;number of changes have taken place in the jurisdiction, in consequence of which the district area has been much diminished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RANJIT SINGH, Maharaja (1780-1839), native Indian ruler, was born on the 2nd of November 1780, the son of Sirdar&nbsp;Mahan Singh, whom he succeeded in 1792 as head of the Sukar-chakia branch of the Sikh confederacy. By birth he was only&nbsp;one of many Sikh barons and owed his rapid rise entirely to&nbsp;force of character and will. At the age of seventeen he seized&nbsp;the reins of government. He is said to have poisoned his&nbsp;mother, though it is more probable that he merely imprisoned&nbsp;her to keep her out of his way. At the age of twenty he obtained&nbsp;from Zaman Shah, the king of Afghanistan, a grant of Lahore,&nbsp;which he seized by force of arms in 1799. Subsequently he&nbsp;attacked and annexed Amritsar in 1802, thus becoming master&nbsp;of the two Sikh capitals. When Jaswant Rao Holkar took&nbsp;refuge in the Punjab in 1805, Ranjit Singh made a treaty with&nbsp;the British, excluding Holkar from his territory. Shortly&nbsp;afterwards acute difficulties arose between him and the British&nbsp;as to the Cis-Sutlej portion of the Punjab. It was Ranjit&nbsp;Singh’s ambition to weld the whole of the Punjab into a single&nbsp;Sikh empire, while the British claimed the territory south of&nbsp;the Sutlej by right of conquest from the Mahrattas. The&nbsp;difference proceeded almost to the point of war; but at the&nbsp;last moment Ranjit Singh gave way, and for the future faithfully observed his engagements with the British, whose rising&nbsp;power he was wise enough to gauge. In 1808 Charles Metcalfe&nbsp;was sent to settle this question with Ranjit Singh, and a treaty&nbsp;was concluded at Amritsar on the 15th of April 1809. At this&nbsp;period a band of Sikh fanatics called “ akalis,” attacked Sir&nbsp;Charles Metcalfe’s escort, and the steadiness with which the&nbsp;disciplined sepoys repulsed them, so impressed the maharaja&nbsp;that he decided to change the strength of his army from cavalry&nbsp;to infantry. He organized a powerful force, which was trained&nbsp;by French and Italian officers such as Generals Ventura, Allard&nbsp;and Avitabile, and thus forged the formidable fighting instrument of the Khalsa army, which afterwards gave the British&nbsp;their hardest battles in India in the two Sikh wars. In 1810&nbsp;he captured Multan after many assaults and a long siege, and&nbsp;in 1820 had consolidated the whole of the Punjab between the&nbsp;Sutlej and the Indus under his dominion. In 1823 the city and&nbsp;province of Peshawar became tributary to him. In 1833 when&nbsp;Shah Shuja, flying from Afghanistan, sought refuge at his&nbsp;court, he took from him the Koh-i-nor diamond, which subsequently came into the possession of the British crown. Though&nbsp;he disapproved of Lord Auckland’s policy of substituting Shah&nbsp;Shuja for Dost Mahomed, he loyally supported the British in&nbsp;their advance on Afghanistan. Known as “ The Lion of the&nbsp;Punjah,” Ranjit Singh died of paralysis on the 27th of June&nbsp;1839∙</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In his private life Ranjit Singh was selfish, avaricious, drunken and immoral, but he had a genius for command and was the&nbsp;only man the Sikhs ever produced strong enough to bind them&nbsp;together. His military genius showed itself not so much in&nbsp;actual generalship as in the organization of his plans, the&nbsp;selection of his generals and his ministers, the tenacity of his&nbsp;purpose and the soundness of his judgment. The British&nbsp;were the one power in India that was too strong for him, and&nbsp;as soon as he realized that fact he was unwaveringly loyal to&nbsp;his engagements with them. His power was military aristocracy resting on the personal qualities of its founder, and after&nbsp;his death the Sikh confederacy gradually crumbled and fell&nbsp;to pieces through sheer want of leadership; and the rule of&nbsp;the Sikhs in the Punjab passed away completely as soon as it&nbsp;incurred the hostility of the British.</span></p><h2><a name="caption1"></a><span class="font1">See Sir Lepel Griffin, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ranjit Singh</span><span class="font1"> (Rulers of India Series), 1892; General Sir John Gordon, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Sikhs,</span><span class="font1"> 1904; and S.
