<p><span class="font2">extremely fragile when found floating on the surface or thrown ashore, and rarely in an uninjured condition; the rays of their</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2">fins especially, and the membrane connecting them, are of a very delicate and brittle structure. In young ribbon-fishes&nbsp;some of the fin-rays are prolonged in an extraordinary degree,&nbsp;and sometimes provided with appendages (see fig. 2). There</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2">are only two genera in the family, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Regalecus,</span><span class="font2"> the oar-fish, and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Trachypterus.</span><span class="font2"> In the former the length of the body is about&nbsp;fifteen times its depth. The head likewise is compressed, short,&nbsp;resembling in its form that of a herring; the eye is large; the&nbsp;mouth is small, and provided with very feeble teeth. A long&nbsp;many-rayed dorsal fin, of which the very long anterior rays&nbsp;form a kind of high crest, extends from the top of the head&nbsp;to the end of the tail; the anal and perhaps the caudal&nbsp;fins are absent; but the ventrals (and by this the oar-fish is&nbsp;distinguished from the other ribbon-fishes) are developed into&nbsp;a pair of long filaments, which terminate in a paddle-shaped&nbsp;extremity, but are too flexible to assist in locomotion. The&nbsp;whole body is covered with a layer of silvery epidermoid substance, which easily comes off and adheres to other objects.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">Oar-fishes are the largest deep-sea fishes known, the majority of the specimens observed measuring 12 ft. in length; but some are&nbsp;recorded to have exceeded 20 ft. Their range in the great depths&nbsp;of the ocean seems to extend over all seas, but, however numerous&nbsp;they may be in the depths which are their home, it is only by rare&nbsp;accident that specimens reach the surface. Thus from the coasts of&nbsp;Great Britain only about twenty captures are known in the long&nbsp;space of a century and a half, and not more than thirteen from those&nbsp;of Norway. Oar-fishes have been considered by naturalists to have</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font1">given rise to some of the tales of “ sea-serpents,” but their size as well as the facility with which they are secured when observed render this&nbsp;solution of the question of the existence of such a creature improbable. When they rise to the surface of the water they are either&nbsp;dead or in a helpless and dying condition. The ligaments and tissues&nbsp;by which the bones and muscles were held together whilst the fish&nbsp;lived under the immense pressure of great depths have then become&nbsp;loosened and torn by the expansion of the internal gases; and it is&nbsp;only with difficulty that the Specimenscan be taken entire out of the&nbsp;water, and preserved afterwards. Every specimen found has been&nbsp;more or less mutilated; and especially the terminal portion of the&nbsp;tail, which seems to end in a delicate tapering filament, has never&nbsp;been perfect;—it is perhaps usually lost as a useless appendage at&nbsp;a much earlier period of the life of the fish. Of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Trachypterus,<sub>&nbsp;</sub></span><span class="font1"> specimens have been taken in the Atlantic, the Mediterranean, at&nbsp;Mauritius and in the Pacific. The species from the Atlantic has&nbsp;occurred chiefly on the northern coasts, Iceland, Scandinavia,&nbsp;Orkneys and Scotland. It is known as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">T</span><span class="font1">. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">arcticus,</span><span class="font1"> in English the&nbsp;deal-fish; its Icelandic name is </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vagmaer.</span><span class="font1"> Its length is 5 to 8 ft.&nbsp;Specimens seem usually to be driven to the shore by gales in&nbsp;winter, and are sometimes left by the tide. S. Nilsson, however,&nbsp;in Scandinavia observed a living specimen in two or three fathoms&nbsp;of water moving something like a flat-fish with one side turned&nbsp;obliquely upwards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RIBBONISM, the name given </span><span class="font0">to </span><span class="font2">an Irish secret-society movement, which began at the end </span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font2">the 18th century in&nbsp;opposition to the Orangemen </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.),</span><span class="font2"> and which was represented&nbsp;by various associations under different names, organized in&nbsp;lodges, and recruited all over Ireland from the lowest classes&nbsp;of the people. The actual name of Ribbonism (from a green&nbsp;badge worn by its members) became attached to the movement&nbsp;later, about 1826; and, after it had grown to its height about&nbsp;1855, it declined in force, and was practically at an end in its&nbsp;old form when in 1871 the Westmeath Act declared Ribbonism&nbsp;illegal. See also under Ireland: </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">History.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RIBBONS. By this name are designated narrow webs, properly of silk, not exceeding nine inches in width, used&nbsp;primarily for binding and tying in connexion with dress, but also&nbsp;now applied for innumerable useful, ornamental and symbolical&nbsp;purposes. Along with that of tapes, fringes and other small-wares, the manufacture of ribbons forms a special department&nbsp;of the textile industries. The essential feature of a ribbon&nbsp;loom is the simultaneous weaving in one loom frame of two or&nbsp;more webs, going up to as many as forty narrow fabrics in&nbsp;modern looms. To effect the conjoined throwing of all the&nbsp;shuttles and the various other movements of the loom, the&nbsp;automatic action of the power-loom is necessary; and it is&nbsp;a remarkable fact that the self-acting ribbon loom was known&nbsp;and extensively used more than a century before the famous&nbsp;invention of Cartwright. A loom in which several narrow webs&nbsp;could be woven at one time is mentioned as having been working&nbsp;in Dantzig towards the end of the 16th century. Similar looms&nbsp;were at work in Leiden in 1620, where their use gave rise to so&nbsp;much discontent and rioting on the part of the weavers that the&nbsp;states-general had to prohibit their use. The prohibition was&nbsp;renewed at various intervals throughout the century, and in the&nbsp;same interval the use of the ribbon loom was interdicted in&nbsp;most of the principal industrial centres of Europe. About&nbsp;1676, under the name of the Dutch loom or engine loom, it was&nbsp;brought to London; and, although its introduction there caused&nbsp;some disturbance, it does not appear to have been prohibited. In 1745, John Kay, the inventor of the fly-shuttle,&nbsp;obtained, conjointly with Joseph Stell, a patent for improvements in the ribbon loom; and since that period it has&nbsp;benefited by the inventions applied to weaving machinery&nbsp;generally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Ribbon-weaving is known to have been established near St Étienne (dep. Loire) so early as the nth century, and that town&nbsp;has remained the headquarters of the industry. During the&nbsp;Huguenot troubles, ribbon-weavers from St Étienne settled at&nbsp;Basel and there established an industry which in modern times&nbsp;has rivalled that of the original seat of the trade. CrefcId is the&nbsp;centre of the German ribbon industry, the manufacture of black&nbsp;velvet ribbon being there a specialty. In England Coventry&nbsp;is the most important seat of ribbon-making, which is also prosecuted at Norwich and Leicester.</span></p>
