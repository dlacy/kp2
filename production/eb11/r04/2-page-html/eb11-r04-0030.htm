<p><span class="font1">could be insisted on—as, for example, for damages for breach of a warranty of acreage of lands sold, or of their freedom from burdens.&nbsp;If it could, then probably the question raised and dealt with </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sacramento</span><span class="font1"> was the abstract one of liability—Was the warranty given,&nbsp;and has it failed?—the sum due in respect of the breach being left&nbsp;to be dealt with in a subsequent arbitral process </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(arbitrium Uh&nbsp;aestimandae).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Legis Actio per Judicis Postulationem<sup>@@1</sup> T</span><span class="font1">he defects of the Verona MS. have deprived us of Gaius’s account of this&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">legis actio.</span><span class="font1"> There is little elsewhere that can with any&nbsp;certainty be said to bear upon it. The most important&nbsp;is a note in Valerius Probus—</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">T.PR.I.A.V.P.V.D.,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">which is generally interpreted—</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">tc, praetor, judicem&nbsp;arbitrumvc postulo uti des.</span><span class="font1"> This petition to the magistrate&nbsp;to appoint a judge, arbiter or arbiters (as the case might&nbsp;be) in all probability was part of the procedure in the&nbsp;action, and that from which it derived its distinctive name.&nbsp;Beyond this all is conjecture, alike as to the nature and form of&nbsp;the action and the cases to which it was applicable. Gaius says&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">legis actio Sacramento</span><span class="font1"> that it was general, and that it was&nbsp;the procedure that was to be resorted to where no other was&nbsp;prescribed by statute. There are, however, nowhere indications of an express instruction that proceedings in any particular&nbsp;case were to be </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">per judicis postulationem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">While it is impossible with certainty to trace the history of this procedure to its first beginnings, yet the impression is general that&nbsp;it must have originated in the regal period. It is commonly held&nbsp;to have been applicable to the divisory actions, and some others&nbsp;triable by arbiters as directed by the XII. Tables. Some eminent&nbsp;writers hold that it was employed in certain actions in which&nbsp;equitable considerations were allowed to be taken into account&nbsp;by the judge </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(e.g.</span><span class="font1"> the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">actio fiduciae),</span><span class="font1"> and generally in so-called&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jurgia</span><span class="font1"> as contrasted with </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lites.</span><span class="font1"> But this theory has many difficulties to contend with. It has no support from any ancient writer,&nbsp;and it leads to the result that the courts by </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">legis actiones</span><span class="font1"> had power&nbsp;to take into consideration questions of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bona fides,</span><span class="font1"> which is not only&nbsp;in contradiction with what Gaius says (iv. n), but inconsistent with&nbsp;their character.<sup>@@2</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Legis Actio per Condictionem<sup>@@3</sup> </span><span class="font1">This, the youngest “ action of the law,” was introduced, Gaius says, by the Silian&nbsp;law as a means of recovering a Uquid money debt&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(certa pecunia), and</span><span class="font1"> afterwards made available by the&nbsp;Calpurnian law for enforcing personal claims (as&nbsp;distinguished from real rights) for anything else definite&nbsp;and certain </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(omnis res certa),</span><span class="font1"> and in both its forms, therefore, essentially an action of debt. The date of both&nbsp;enactments is matter of controversy, although there is no&nbsp;question that the Silian was the earlier. Gaius says of it that&nbsp;its purpose was far from obvious, as there was no difficulty in&nbsp;recovering money either by a sacramental action or one </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">per&nbsp;judicis postulationem.</span><span class="font1"> But it is probable, as above stated,&nbsp;that money due under a nexal contract was recoverable by&nbsp;neither of these processes, but by the much more summary one&nbsp;of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">manus injectio,</span><span class="font1"> a procedure which would be practically put&nbsp;an end to by the Poetilian law of 326 b.C. We are disposed to&nbsp;regard the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lex Silia</span><span class="font1"> and the new procedure it authorized as a&nbsp;result of the change made by this last-mentioned statute. To&nbsp;have put off a creditor for money lent either with a sacramental&nbsp;action or one </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">per judicis postulationem,</span><span class="font1"> would have been to&nbsp;deprive him of the advantages of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">manus injectio</span><span class="font1"> to a greater&nbsp;extent than was called for. At any rate, it seems to have been&nbsp;provided by the Silian law that, when a man disputed his&nbsp;liability for what was called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pecunia certa credita,</span><span class="font1"> and forced his&nbsp;creditor to litigation, the plaintiff was entitled, if he pleased,&nbsp;to require from him an engagement to pay one-third more by&nbsp;way of penalty in the event of judgment being against him,&nbsp;while the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">soi-disant</span><span class="font1"> creditor had similarly to undertake to pay&nbsp;as penalty the same amount in ease of judgment in favour of&nbsp;the alleged debtor. Those engagements </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(sponsio cl restipulatio&nbsp;tertiae partis)</span><span class="font1"> were not allowed in every case in which a definite&nbsp;sum of money was claimed </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">per condictionem,</span><span class="font1"> but only when&nbsp;it was technically </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pcctmia credita.</span><span class="font1"> In Cicero’s time </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">creditum&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">might arise either from loan, stipulation or literal contract&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(expensilatio)',</span><span class="font1"> but the last dated probably at soonest from&nbsp;the beginning of the 6th century, and stipulation apparently&nbsp;was a result of the Silian law itself, so that the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pecunia credita&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">of this enactment can have referred only to borrowed money.&nbsp;The same phrase, according to Livy, was employed in the&nbsp;Poetilian law; it was thereby enacted, he says, that for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pecunia&nbsp;credita</span><span class="font1"> the goods, not the body of the debtor, ought to be taken&nbsp;in execution. A connexion, therefore, between the Poetilian&nbsp;law and the disuse of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">nexum</span><span class="font1"> on the one hand, and the Silian&nbsp;law and the introduction of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">legis actio per condictionem</span><span class="font1"> on&nbsp;the other, can hardly be ignored, and raises a probability that&nbsp;the latter statute was a consequence of the former, and was&nbsp;passed immediately or soon after the year 326 </span><span class="font0">B.C. </span><span class="font1">In the action&nbsp;on the Calpurnian law, it is probable that there was no penalty&nbsp;of a third part on either side. A peculiarity of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">legis actio&nbsp;per condictionem</span><span class="font1"> is that the plaintiff could when before the&nbsp;magistrate refer the case to the defendant’s oath </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(juramentum&nbsp;necessarium).</span><span class="font1"> Taking the oath involved absolution, refusal&nbsp;involved condemnation.</span></p><div>

<p><span class="font1">Little is known of the procedure in this </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">legis actio,</span><span class="font1"> for, in consequence of the loss of a leaf in the Verona MS., we are without part of Gaius’s account of it. It got its distinctive name, he says, from&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">condictio</span><span class="font1"> or requisition made by the plaintiff on the defendant,&nbsp;whom he had brought into court in the usual way, to attend again&nbsp;on the expiry of thirty days to have a judge appointed. The procedure on the reappearance of the parties on the thirtieth day&nbsp;(provided a settlement had not been arrived at in the interval)&nbsp;varied according as the action was (1) for a definite sum of money&nbsp;falling under the category of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pecunia credita,</span><span class="font1"> or (2) for any other&nbsp;definite sum of money or a definite thing or quantity of things. In&nbsp;the action for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pecunia credita</span><span class="font1"> the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sponsio et restipulatio tertiae partis&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">were exchanged; and it is probable that, if either party refused on&nbsp;the praetor’s command so to oblige himself towards the other,&nbsp;judgment was at once pronounced in favour of the latter without&nbsp;any remit to a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">judex.</span><span class="font1"> How the issue was adjusted when the&nbsp;sponsion and restipulation were duly given we are not informed,&nbsp;but, judging by analogy from the procedure in an action for breach&nbsp;of interdict under the iormular system, and on the broader ground&nbsp;that there must have been machinery for a condemnation of the&nbsp;plaintiff on his restipulation in the event of his being found in the&nbsp;wrong, it may reasonably be concluded that there were in fact three&nbsp;concurrent issues sent to the same </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">judex—</span><span class="font1">the first on the main&nbsp;question, the second on the defendant’s sponsion and the third on&nbsp;the plaintiff’s restipulation. When a sum of money other than&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pecunia credita</span><span class="font1"> or a thing or quantity of things other than money&nbsp;was sued for, those subsidiary issues were unnecessary if the view&nbsp;above expressed be correct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As Baron has demonstrated, it was not the usual practice to introduce any words explanatory of the ground of indebtedness&nbsp;when the action was either for money (other than </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pecunia credita)&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">or for a thing or quantity of things. It might be loan, or bequest,&nbsp;or sale, or purchase,, or delict, or unjustifiable enrichment, or any&nbsp;of a hundred </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">causae \</span><span class="font1"> it would have to be stated of course before the&nbsp;judge; but in the initial stage before the praetor and in the issue&nbsp;all.that was necessary was the averment that the defendant was&nbsp;owing such a sum of money or such a thing. It was for the judge to&nbsp;determine whether or not the averment was established and, in&nbsp;certain cases, that non-delivery was due to the fault of the defendant;&nbsp;the plaintiff, however, was bound to make his averment good to the&nbsp;letter of his claim. In the event of the plaintiff being successful in&nbsp;an action for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">certa pecunia,</span><span class="font1"> but delay was made by the defendant&nbsp;in satisfying the judgment, execution followed in ordinary form.&nbsp;How the matter was arranged in an action on the Calpurnian law&nbsp;for a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">certa res</span><span class="font1"> is not so obvious. What the plaintiff wanted was&nbsp;specific delivery or damages, and by some the opinion is entertained&nbsp;that he formulated Jiis claim alternatively. Of this there is no&nbsp;evidence; and Gaius’s statement that under the system of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">legis&nbsp;actiones</span><span class="font1"> condemnation was always in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ipsa res, i.e.</span><span class="font1"> the specific&nbsp;thing sued for, leads to the assumption that a judgment for the&nbsp;plaintiff, on which specific implement failed, must have been followed&nbsp;by an </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">arbitrium Uh aestimandae</span><span class="font1"> for assessment of the damages in&nbsp;money, and that execution proceeded thereon as if the judgment&nbsp;had been for a sum of money in the first instance. The general&nbsp;opinion, however, is that the judge to whom the issue was remitted</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
