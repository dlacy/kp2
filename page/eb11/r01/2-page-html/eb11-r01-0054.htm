<p><span class="font1">born at Hamm on the Sieg on the 30th of March 1818, being the son of Gottfried Raiffeisen, burgomaster of that place.&nbsp;Educated privately, he entered the artillery in Cologne, but&nbsp;defective eyesight compelled him to leave the army. He then&nbsp;entered the public service at Coblenz, and in 1845 was appointed burgomaster of Weyerbusch. Here he was so successful&nbsp;that in 1848 he was transferred in a like capacity to Flammersfeld, and in 1852 to Heddersdorf. Raiffeisen devoted himself&nbsp;to the improvement of the social condition of the cultivators&nbsp;of the soil, and did good work in the planning of public roads&nbsp;and in other ways. The distress of the years 1846-47, the&nbsp;causes of which he discerned in the slight amount of credit&nbsp;obtainable by the small landed proprietors, led him to seek&nbsp;for a remedy in co-operation, and at Heddersdorf and at Weyer-busch he founded the first agricultural co-operative loan banks&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Darlehnskassenυerein).</span><span class="font1"> These banks were called after him,&nbsp;and their foundation resulted in a widespread system of land&nbsp;banks, supported by the government. In 1865 the state of his&nbsp;health compelled him to retire, but he continued to take an&nbsp;interest in the movement he had originated, and in 1878 he&nbsp;founded at Neuwied a periodical, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Das landwirtschaftliche Genossenschaftsblatt.</span><span class="font1"> He died on the 11th of March 1888.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Among Raiffeisen’s writings are, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Die Darlehnskassenυereine als Mittel zur Abhilfe</span><span class="font0"> (Neuwied, 1866; new ed., 1887); </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Anleitung zur&nbsp;Geschäfts- und Buchführung ländlichen Spar- und Darlehnskassenvereine</span><span class="font0"> (new ed., 1896); and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Kurze Anleitung zur Gründung&nbsp;von Darlehnskassenυereinen</span><span class="font0"> (new ed., 1893). See A. Wattig, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Friedrich&nbsp;Wilhelm Raiffeisen</span><span class="font0"> (1890); H. W.

<p><span class="font1">RAIGARH, a feudatory state of India, in the Chattisgarh division of the Central Provinces. Area, 1486 sq. m. Pop.&nbsp;(1901) 174, 929, showing an increase of 4% in the decade.&nbsp;Estimated revenue, £10, 000; tribute, £260. The chief belongs&nbsp;to the old Gond royal family. The state is traversed by the&nbsp;Bengal-Nagpur railway, with a station at Raigarh town, 363 m.&nbsp;from Calcutta. Rice is the chief crop; iron ore is worked by&nbsp;indigenous methods, and coal is known to exist. Fine tussore&nbsp;silk is produced at Raigarh town (pop. 6764). Raigarh is&nbsp;also the name of a hill fortress in Kolaba district, Bombay,&nbsp;which Sivaji made his chief place of residence. Here he was&nbsp;crowned in 1674.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RAIKES, ROBERT (1735-1811), English educationist, the founder of Sunday schools, was the son of Robert Raikes, a&nbsp;printer in Gloucester and proprietor of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Gloucester Journal,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">and was born on the 14th of September 1735. On the death&nbsp;of his father in 1757 he succeeded him in the business, which&nbsp;he continued to conduct till 1802. Along with some others he&nbsp;started a Sunday school at Gloucester in 1780, and on his&nbsp;giving publicity to the enterprise in the columns of his journal&nbsp;the notice was copied into the London papers and awakened&nbsp;considerable attention. For nearly thirty years he continued&nbsp;actively engaged in the promotion of his undertaking, and he&nbsp;lived to witness its wide extension throughout England. He&nbsp;died on the 5th of April 1811. His statue stands on the Thames&nbsp;Embankment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Among various accounts of the life and work of Raikes mention may be made of that by P. M. Eastman, 1880.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RAIL. (1) (From Fr. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Râle,</span><span class="font1"> cf. Ger. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ralle,</span><span class="font1"> Low Lat. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rallus,</span><span class="font1"> of unknown origin), originally the English name of two birds,&nbsp;distinguished from one another by a prefix as land-rail and&nbsp;water-rail, but latterly applied in a much wider sense to all&nbsp;the species which are included in the family </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rallidae.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The land-rail, also very commonly known as the corn-crake, and sometimes as the daker-hen, is the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rattus crex</span><span class="font1"> of Linnaeus and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Crex pratensis</span><span class="font1"> of recent authors. Its monotonous&nbsp;grating cry has given it its common name in several languages.&nbsp;With comparatively few individual exceptions, the land-rail&nbsp;is essentially migratory. It is the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ortygometra</span><span class="font1"> of classical&nbsp;authors—supposed by them to lead the quail </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q. v. )</span><span class="font1"> on its&nbsp;voyages—and in the course of its wanderings has now been&nbsp;known to reach the coast of Greenland, and several times that&nbsp;of North America, to say nothing of Bermuda, in every instance&nbsp;we may believe as a straggler from Europe or Barbary. The&nbsp;land-rail looks about as big as a partridge, but on examination&nbsp;its appearance is found to be very deceptive, and it will hardly&nbsp;ever weigh more than half as much. The plumage above is of&nbsp;a tawny brown, the feathers being longitudinally streaked&nbsp;with blackish brown; beneath it is of a yellowish white; but&nbsp;the flanks are of a light chestnut barred with white. The&nbsp;species is very locally distributed, and in a way for which there&nbsp;is at present no accounting. In some dry upland and corn-growing districts it is plentiful; in others, of apparently the&nbsp;same character, it but rarely occurs; and the same may be&nbsp;said in regard to low-lying marshy meadows, in most of which&nbsp;it is in season always to be heard, while in others having a&nbsp;close resemblance to them it is never met with. The nest is&nbsp;on the ground, generally in long grass, and therein from nine&nbsp;to eleven eggs are commonly laid. These are of a cream-colour, spotted and blotched with light red and grey. The&nbsp;young when hatched are thickly clothed with black down, as&nbsp;is the case in nearly all species of the family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The water-rail, locally known as the skiddy or billcock, is the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rallus aquations</span><span class="font1"> of ornithology, and seems to be less&nbsp;abundant than the preceding, though that is in some measure&nbsp;due to its frequenting places into which from their swampy&nbsp;nature men do not often intrude. Having a general resemblance&nbsp;to the land-rail, @@<sup>1</sup> it can be in a moment distinguished by its&nbsp;partly red and much longer bill, and the darker coloration of&nbsp;its plumage—the upper parts being of an olive brown with&nbsp;black streaks, the breast and belly of a sooty grey, and the&nbsp;flanks dull black barred with white. Its geographical distribution is very wide, extending from Iceland (where it is said&nbsp;to preserve its existence during winter by resorting to the hot&nbsp;springs) to China; and though it inhabits Northern India,&nbsp;Lower Egypt and Barbary, it seems not to pass beyond the&nbsp;tropical line. It never affects upland districts as does the land-rail, but always haunts wet marshes or the close vicinity of&nbsp;water. Its love-note is a loud and harsh cry, not continually&nbsp;repeated as is that of the land-rail, but uttered at considerable&nbsp;intervals and so suddenly as to have been termed “ explosive. ”&nbsp;Besides this, which is peculiar to the cock-bird, it has a croaking&nbsp;call that is frog-like. The eggs resemble those of the preceding,&nbsp;but are more brightly and delicately tinted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The various species of rails, whether allied to the former or latter of those just mentioned, are far too numerous to be here noticed.&nbsp;Hardly any part of the world is without a representative of the&nbsp;genera </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Crex</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rallies,</span><span class="font0"> and every considerable country has one or&nbsp;perhaps more of each—though it has been the habit of systematists&nbsp;to refer them to many other genera, the characters of which are&nbsp;with difficulty found. Thus in Europe alone three other species&nbsp;allied to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Crex pratensis</span><span class="font0"> occur more or less abundantly; but one of&nbsp;them, the spotted rail or crake, has been made the type of a so-called genus </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Porzana,</span><span class="font0"> and the other two, little birds not much&nbsp;bigger than larks, are considered to form a genus </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Zapornia.</span><span class="font0"> The&nbsp;first of these, which used not to be uncommon in the eastern part&nbsp;of England, has a very near representative in the Carolina rail or&nbsp;sora, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Crex Carolina,</span><span class="font0"> of North America, often there miscalled the&nbsp;ortolan, just as its European analogue, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">C. porzana,</span><span class="font0"> is in England&nbsp;often termed the dotterel. But, passing over these as well as&nbsp;some belonging to genera that can be much better defined, and&nbsp;other still more interesting forms of the family, as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Aphanapteryx,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">coot (</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">q. v.</span><span class="font0"> ), moor-hen (</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">q. v. </span><span class="font0">) and ocydrome </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(q. υ. ),</span><span class="font0"> a few words must be&nbsp;said of the more distant group formed by the South American&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Heliornis,</span><span class="font0"> and the African and Indian </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Podica,</span><span class="font0"> comprising four or&nbsp;five species, to which the name “ Finfoots ” has been applied—&nbsp;from the lobes or flaps of skin that fringe their toes. Though for a&nbsp;long while placed among the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Podicipedidae</span><span class="font0"> (see Grebe), their&nbsp;osteology no less than their habits appear to indicate their alliance&nbsp;with the rails, and they are placed as a separate family, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Heliornithidae</span><span class="font0"> of the order </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Gruiformes,</span><span class="font0"> to which the rails belong; but they&nbsp;seem to show the extreme modification of that type in adaptation&nbsp;to aquatic life. The curious genus </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Mesites</span><span class="font0"> of Madagascar, whose&nbsp;systematic place has been so long in doubt, has been referred by&nbsp;A. Milne-Edwards (</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ann. Sc. Naturelle,</span><span class="font0"> ser. 6, vii. art. 2) to the&nbsp;neighbourhood of the rails, but is now associated as a sub-order&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Mesitae</span><span class="font0"> with Galliform birds. On the other hand the jacanas or&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Parridae,</span><span class="font0"> which from their long toes were once thought to belong</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@1</sup> Formerly it seems to have been a popular belief in England that the land-rail in autumn transformed itself into a water-rail, re-suming its own characters in spring.</span></p>
