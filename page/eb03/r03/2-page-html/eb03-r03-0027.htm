<p><span class="font0">9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pimpinellifolia, or burnet-leaved roſe, grows&nbsp;about a yard high, aculeated ſparſedly ; ſmall neatly&nbsp;pinnated ſeven-lobed leaves, having obtuſe folioles and&nbsp;rough petioles, ſmooth pedu∏cules, a globular ſmooth&nbsp;germen, and ſmall fingle flowers. There are varieties&nbsp;with red flowers—and with white flowers. They grow&nbsp;wild in England, &amp;c. and are cultivated in ſhrubbe-ries for variety.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ſpinofiſſima, or moil ſpinous, dwarf bιlrnet-leaved roſe, commonly called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Scotch roſe,</span><span class="font0"> grows but&nbsp;two or three feet high, very cloſely armed with ſpines ;&nbsp;ſmall neatly pinnated ſeven-lobed leaves, with prickly&nbsp;foot-ſtalks, prickly pedunculi, oval ſmooth germen, and&nbsp;numerous ſmall fingle flowers, filcceeded by round dark«·&nbsp;purple heps. The varieties are, common white-flowered</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">They grow naturally in England, Scotland, &amp;c. The firſt variety riſes near a yard high, the others but one&nbsp;or two feet, all </span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font0">which are fingle-flowered ; but the&nbsp;flowers being numerous all over the branches, make à&nbsp;pretty appearance in the collection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eglanteria, eglantine roſe, or ſweet briar,&nbsp;grows five or fix feet high, having green branches,&nbsp;armed with ſtrong ſpines ſparſedly ; pinnated ſeven-lobed odoriferous leaves, with acute folioles and rough&nbsp;foot-ſtalks, ſmooth pedunculi, globular ſmooth germiha,&nbsp;and ſmall pale-red flowers.

Tliisſpe-cies grows naturally in ſome parts of England, and in&nbsp;Switzerland. It claims culture in every garden for the&nbsp;odoriferous property of its leaves ; and ſhould be planted in the borders, and other compartments contiguous&nbsp;to walks, or near the habitation, where the plants will&nbsp;impart their refreſhing fragrance very profulely all&nbsp;around ; and the young branches arc excellent for improving the odour of noſe-gays and bow-pots.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">The moſehata, or muſk-roſe, ſuppoſed to be a&nbsp;variety only of the ever-green muſk-roſe, hath weak&nbsp;ſmooth green ſtalks and branches, rifing by ſupport&nbsp;from fix to eight or ten feet high or more, thinly arm</span><span class="font1">ed </span><span class="font0">with ſtrong ſpines ; pinnated ſeven-lobed ſmooth&nbsp;leaves, with prickly foot-ſtalks ; hifpid peduncles ; oval&nbsp;hilj&gt;id germen; and all the branches terminated by large&nbsp;umbellate cluſters of pure-white muſk-ſcented flowers in&nbsp;Auguſt, &amp;c.</span></p>

The ſemper-virent property of this elegant ſpecies renders it a curi-ofity among the roſy tribe ; it alſo makes a fine appearance as a ſtowering ſhrub. There is one variety, the&nbsp;deciduous muſk-roſe above-mentioned. This ſpecies and&nbsp;variety flower in Auguſt, and is remarkable for producing&nbsp;them numerouſly in cluſttrs, continuing in ſucceſſion till&nbsp;October or November.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">The white and red roſes are uſed ill medicine. The former diſtſlled with water yields a ſmall portion of a&nbsp;butyraceoys oil, whoſe flavour exactly reſembles that of&nbsp;the roſes themſelves. This oil and the diſtilled water&nbsp;are very uſeful and agreeable cordials. Theſe roſes alſo, befides the cordial and aromatic virtues which refιde&nbsp;in their volatile parts, have a mild purgative one, which&nbsp;remains entire in the decoction left after diſtſllation.&nbsp;The red roſe, on the contrary, has an aſtringent and&nbsp;gratefully corroborating virtue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROSA (Salvator), an admirable painter, born at Naples in 1614. He was firſt inſtructed by Franceſco&nbsp;Francazano, a kinſman : but the death of his father&nbsp;reduced him to fell drawings ſketched upon paper for&nbsp;any thing he could get ; one of which happening to&nbsp;fall into the hands of Lanfranc, he took him under his&nbsp;protection, and enabled him to enter the ſchool of&nbsp;Spagnoletto, and to be taught moreover by Daniel&nbsp;Falcone, a diſtinguiſked painter of battles at Naples,&nbsp;Salvator had a fertile imagination. He ſtudied nature&nbsp;with attention and judgment ; and always repreſented&nbsp;her to the greateſt advantage ; for every tree, rock,&nbsp;cloud, or fituation, that enters into his compofition,&nbsp;ſhows an elevation of thought that extorts admiration.&nbsp;He was equally eminent for painting battles, animals,&nbsp;ſea or land ſtorms ; and he executed theſe different&nbsp;ſubjects in ſuch taſte as renders his works readily di-ſtinguiſkable from all others. His pieces are exceedingly ſcarce and valuable ; one of the moſt capital is that&nbsp;repreſenting Saul and the witch of Endor, which was&nbsp;preſerved at Verſailles. He died in 1673; and as his&nbsp;paintings are in few hands, he is more generally known&nbsp;by his prints; of which he etched a great number. He&nbsp;painted landſcapes more than hiilory ; but his prints&nbsp;are chiefly hiſtorical. The capital landſcape of this&nbsp;matter at Chiſwick is a noble picture. However, he is&nbsp;ſaid to have been ignorant of the management of light,&nbsp;and to have ſometimes ſhaded faces in a diſagreeable manned He was however a man of undoubted genius; of which&nbsp;he has given frequent ſpeciinens in hiε works. A roving&nbsp;diſpofition, to which he is ſaid to have given full ſcope,&nbsp;ſeems to have added a wildneſs to all his thoughts.&nbsp;We are told that he ſpent the early part of his life in&nbsp;a troop of banditti ; and that the rocky defolate ſcenes</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
