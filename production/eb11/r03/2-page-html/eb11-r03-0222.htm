<p><span class="font0">that the first and foremost of those enemies were the Jansenists. Not only did their doctrine of grace defy the favourite Jesuit&nbsp;principle of obedience to authority, but it bade fair to set aside&nbsp;the whole Catholic machinery of infallibility and sacraments.&nbsp;If God spoke directly to the individual conscience, what was&nbsp;the use of intermediaries? Led by his Jesuits, Louis wrung&nbsp;from the unwilling Clement XI. the Bull </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Unigenitus&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(1713)1 which was intended to deprive believers in individual inspiration of all possible foothold within the&nbsp;Roman Church. The bull caused a violent uproar. Fénelon,&nbsp;although personally an admirer, admits that public opinion&nbsp;credited it with “ condemning St Augustine, St Paul, and even&nbsp;Jesus Christ ”; and the few Jansenist bishops appealed and&nbsp;“ re-appealed ” against it. But the government was inexorable; in 1730 the I/wigem/wi became part and parcel of the&nbsp;law of the land. Still, to make a law is one thing; to get it&nbsp;administered is quite another. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">parlement</span><span class="font0"> of Paris was a&nbsp;strongly Gallican body, and had many grievances to avenge&nbsp;on Louis XV. and his ministers. To annoy them, it put every&nbsp;possible difficulty in the way of an execution of the bull. Under&nbsp;the fostering care of the judges, a belief sprang up that to call&nbsp;oneself a “ Jansenist, ” and oppose the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Unigenitus,</span><span class="font0"> was to show&nbsp;oneself a lover of civil and religious liberty. This feeling was&nbsp;intensified by the conviction that every blow struck against&nbsp;the bull was a blow against the Jesuits, its authors. For the&nbsp;Society, as befitted the great exponent of authority and the&nbsp;keeper of the consciences of many kings, had always been on&nbsp;the side of political autocracy; and therefore it became increasingly unpopular, when once the tide of French intelligence&nbsp;began to set in the direction of revolutionary reform. Nor&nbsp;were the Jesuits in much better odour among other nations.&nbsp;Their perpetual meddling in politics, and even in speculation&nbsp;and finance, stank in the nostrils of every government in&nbsp;Europe; while their high-handedness and corporate greed in&nbsp;the matter of ecclesiastical privileges and patronage alienated&nbsp;the clergy. Their reform was more than once discussed; and&nbsp;death alone prevented Benedict XIV. (1740-58), the most&nbsp;remarkable of the 18th-century popes, from taking some&nbsp;very stringent measures. A year after Benedict’s death the&nbsp;first blow fell. Pombal, the great reforming minister&nbsp;in Portugal, expelled them from that country on a&nbsp;charge of having conspired against the life of the&nbsp;king. Two years later the Paris </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">parlement</span><span class="font0"> had its&nbsp;chance. La Valette, superior of the Jesuit missions in Martinique, had set up as a West-India merchant on a large scale.&nbsp;His enterprises were unsuccessful; in 1761 he became insolvent,&nbsp;and the Society refused to be responsible for his debts. The&nbsp;French courts made the consequent bankruptcy proceedings&nbsp;the excuse for a general inquiry into the Society’s constitution,&nbsp;and ended by declaring its existence illegal in France, on the&nbsp;ground that its members were pledged to absolute obedience&nbsp;to a foreigner in Rome. Louis XV. now proposed that the&nbsp;French Jesuits should be placed under some special organization, less obnoxious to his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">parlement.</span><span class="font0"> The general only made&nbsp;the famous reply: “ Sint ut sunt, aut non sint.” Thereupon&nbsp;Louis let the judges have their way. In 1762 the Society was&nbsp;suppressed in France; in 1767 it was also declared illegal by&nbsp;Spain, Naples and other Italian powers. Pressure was now&nbsp;put on Clement XIII. to dissolve the Society altogether. He&nbsp;refused; but his successor, Clement XIV., was more pliable,&nbsp;and in 1773 the Jesuits ceased to be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In France the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">philosophes</span><span class="font0"> and the quarrels over the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Unigenitus </span><span class="font0">had effectually killed the spirit of religion; nor was the Christianity of other countries at a much higher ebb. Spain was&nbsp;utterly dumb; Italian fervour could only boast the foundation&nbsp;of two small orders of popular preachers—the Passionists&nbsp;(i737), and the Redemptorists, instituted in 1732 by St Alfonso&nbsp;Liguori (ç.r.), who also won for himself a dubious reputation&nbsp;on the unsavoury field of casuistry. German Catholicism&nbsp;was still in a very raw, unsophisticated state. It is characteristic that, while Paris had its Bossuets and Bourdaloues, Vienna&nbsp;was listening to Abraham a Sancta Clara, the punning Capuchin&nbsp;whom Schiller, regardless of dates, introduces into the opening&nbsp;scene of his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Wallenstein.</span><span class="font0"> However, from Germany was to&nbsp;come a serious attempt at reform. There the vision of a reunion&nbsp;with the Protestants had haunted many Catholic brains ever&nbsp;since Bossuet and Leibniz had corresponded on the subject.&nbsp;Faithful to the ancient tradition of Contarini and Pole at Trent,&nbsp;these good men persisted in supposing that the Reformation&nbsp;was nothing more than a protest against practical abuses:&nbsp;remove the abuses, and the rest would follow of itself. And,&nbsp;inasmuch as they held that most abuses were due to the slippery&nbsp;and procrastinating greed of Roman officials, the&nbsp;first step should be ruthlessly to curtail the power&nbsp;of Rome and extend that of local Churches. Such&nbsp;was the theme of a book, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">De </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">statu Ecclesiae, ad reuniendos dissidentes in religione Christianos compositus,</span><span class="font0"> published by one&nbsp;Justinus Febronius in 1763. The author was Johann Nikolaus&nbsp;von Hontheim </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.),</span><span class="font0"> suffragan </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">in partibus</span><span class="font0"> to the elector-archbishop of Treves. Hontheim’s theories could not but prove&nbsp;attractive to the local Churches, more especially when they&nbsp;were governed by bishops who were also temporal great lords.&nbsp;The three ecclesiastical electors and the prince-archbishop of&nbsp;Salzburg met in congress at Ems in 1786, and embodied Hontheim’s proposals, though in a very modified form, in a document known as the “ punctuation of Ems ” (see </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Febronianism).&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">Meanwhile, their overlord, the emperor Joseph II. (1780-90),&nbsp;was dealing with the question of a much more radical spirit, and&nbsp;actually abolishing abuses wholesale. The reign of “ Brother&nbsp;Sacristan, ” the nickname given to Joseph by Frederick the&nbsp;Great, was one continual suppression of superfluous abbeys,&nbsp;feast-days, pilgrimages. More dignified were his attempts to&nbsp;broaden the minds of the clergy. Instead of being brought&nbsp;up in diocesan seminaries, centres of provincial narrowness,&nbsp;candidates for ordination were to be collected into a few large&nbsp;colleges set up in university towns. Still, Joseph only touched&nbsp;the surface; his brother, the grand-duke Leopold of Tuscany,&nbsp;aspired to cut deeper, and provoke a religious revival-on the&nbsp;lines of Jansenism. His plans, which made a great stir at the&nbsp;time, were outlined at a synod held at Pistoia in 1786 (see&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Pistoia, Synod of).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Three years later, however, the world had more important things to think of than Leopold’s ecclesiastical reforms. At&nbsp;first the French Revolution was by no means anti-Catholic—though the Constituent Assembly remembered too much of the quarrels about the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Unigenitus&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">not to be bitterly hostile to Rome—and its great aim&nbsp;was to turn the French Church into a purely national body.&nbsp;Hence it decreed the “ civil constitution of the clergy. ” Bishops&nbsp;and rectors were made elective, with salaries paid by the state;&nbsp;and all priests were required to take an oath of fidelity to the&nbsp;government: those who refused the oath rendered themselves&nbsp;liable to banishment. Three years later the triumph of the&nbsp;Jacobins brought with it the “ abolition of Christianity,”&nbsp;and a spell of violent persecution, which gradually slackened&nbsp;under the Directory (1795-99). In 1799 Napoleon became&nbsp;First Consul, and at once set himself to deal with the ecclesiastical problem. There must clearly be a Church, and the&nbsp;small success of the Civil Constitution made clear that public&nbsp;opinion would not put up with a Church practically detached&nbsp;from Rome. On the other hand, Napoleon quite agreed with&nbsp;Louis XIV. in wishing to be master in his own house, and to&nbsp;turn the clergy into a Supplementarypolice. Accordingly, in 1801&nbsp;he negotiated with Pius VII. a Concordat, which remained in&nbsp;force till 1905 (see </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Concordat).</span><span class="font0"> The state undertook to pay&nbsp;the bishops and parochial clergy; it was directly to&nbsp;appoint the one, and to have a veto on the appointment of the OtherT But for the religious orders no&nbsp;provision was made; and Napoleon refused to tolerate the&nbsp;presence of unsalaried clerics on whom the government had&nbsp;no hold. When his fall brought about the restoration of&nbsp;Louis XVHI. (1815), this restriction was relaxed, and the&nbsp;“ congregations ” returned in large numbers to France. But&nbsp;the Bourbon government had no intention of encouraging them</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
