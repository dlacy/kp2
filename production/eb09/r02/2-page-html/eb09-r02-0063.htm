<p><span class="font2">known as Binjh, which overlook the valley of the Ganges. This plateau is for the most part cultivated and well&nbsp;peopled ; the soil varies from a rich black loam to a&nbsp;sandy laterite ; but in the greater part of this area good&nbsp;land predominates, and rich harvests both of kharif and&nbsp;rabi crops are generally obtained. Water is plentiful, and&nbsp;the country is full of large tanks and reservoirs, which,&nbsp;however, are not used for irrigation purposes ; the only&nbsp;system of wet cultivation which has any favour with the&nbsp;villagers is that of bandhs, or mounds of earth raised at&nbsp;the lower ends of sloping fields to retain the rain water&nbsp;for some time after the monsoon rains cease. The Rewah&nbsp;plateau is reported to possess every natural advantage, and&nbsp;the whole of its area could be brought under rich cultivation. The country to the south of the Kaimur Hills&nbsp;comprises by far the largest portion of the state ; but&nbsp;here cultivation is restricted to the valley between the&nbsp;hills and the Sone river, and to a few isolated patches in&nbsp;scattered parts of the wild and magnificent forest wastes.&nbsp;Rewah is rich in minerals and forests. Operations lately&nbsp;undertaken to determine the extent of its coal fields have&nbsp;proved highly successful. Until very recently Rewah&nbsp;possessed no roads to speak of or means of internal communication ; but good progress is now being made, and&nbsp;by this means it is anticipated that the state will soon&nbsp;develop its rich resources. The principal river is the</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">•Sone, which, receiving the Mahanadi from the south, flows through the state in a north and north-easterly direction&nbsp;into Mirzapur district ; another important river is the&nbsp;Tons ; but none of the rivers are navigable. The average&nbsp;rainfall at Rewah is about 57∣ inches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">K </span><span class="font1">The population of the state in 1881 was 1,305,124 (654,182 </span><span class="font2">males, </span><span class="font1">650,942 females) ; Hindus in the same year numbered&nbsp;971,788, Mohammedans 31,107, and aboriginals 302,107. The&nbsp;inhabitants of Rewah are reported to be a singularly simple,&nbsp;pleasant, and well-disposed race, and they greatly appreciate the&nbsp;efforts which are now being made to benefit them. The revenue&nbsp;of the state in 1882-83 amounted to £110,946, of which the land&nbsp;contributed £71,798. The chief town is Rewah, situated in&nbsp;24° 31' 30&quot; N. lat. and 81° 20' E. long., and containing in 1881 a&nbsp;population of 22,016.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The state came under British influence in 1812, when the first formal treaty was made with Jai Sinh Deo, by which he was&nbsp;acknowledged as ruler of his dominions and was brought under&nbsp;the protection of the British Government. The raja, however,&nbsp;failed to fulfil his obligations, and a second treaty was made confirming the first and defining more clearly his relations with the&nbsp;British Government. The administration of Rewah is now entirely&nbsp;in the hands of the British owing to the death of the maharaja&nbsp;Raghuraj Sinh and the succession of his infant son.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">REYNOLDS, Sir Joshua (1723-1792), English portrait-painter, was born at Plympton Earl, in Devonshire, on July 16, 1723. He was educated by his father, a clergyman and the master of the free grammar&nbsp;school of the place, who designed his son for the medical&nbsp;profession. But the boy showed a distinct preference&nbsp;for painting. He was constantly copying the plates in&nbsp;Dryden’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Plutarch</span><span class="font2"> and Cat’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Emblems,</span><span class="font2"> and poring over&nbsp;Jonathan Richardson’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Treatise on Art.</span><span class="font2"> At the age of&nbsp;eight, aided by the instructions in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Jesuit's Perspective,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">he made a sufficiently correct drawing of the Plympton&nbsp;schoolhouse, which greatly astonished his father. It was&nbsp;at length decided that the lad should devote himself to art,&nbsp;and in October 1741 he proceeded to London to study&nbsp;under Thomas Hudson, a mediocre artist, a native of Devonshire, who was popular in the metropolis as a portrait&nbsp;painter. Reynolds remained with Hudson for only two&nbsp;years, acquiring with uncommon aptitude the technicalities&nbsp;of the craft, and in 1743 he returned to Devonshire,&nbsp;where, settling at Plymouth Dock, he employed himself in&nbsp;portrait painting. By the end of 1744 he was again in&nbsp;London. He was well received by his old master, from&nbsp;whom he appears previously to have parted with some coldness on both sides. Hudson introduced him to the artists’&nbsp;club that met in Old Slaughters, St Martin’s Lane, and gave&nbsp;him much advice as to his work. Reynolds now painted&nbsp;his portraits of Captain Hamilton, father of the marquis&nbsp;of Abercorn, of Mrs Field, of Alderman Tracey, now in the&nbsp;Plymouth Athenæum, and of the notorious AIiss Chudleigb,&nbsp;afterwards duchess of Kingston. To this period, or perhaps to one slightly later, is referable the artist’s excellent&nbsp;oval bust portrait of himself, which was included in the&nbsp;Grosvenor Gallery Exhibition of 1884. At Christmas&nbsp;1746 he was recalled to Plympton to attend the last hours&nbsp;of his father, after whose death he again established himself, now with two of his sisters, at Plymouth Dock, where&nbsp;he painted portraits, and, as he has himself recorded,&nbsp;derived much instruction from an examination of some&nbsp;λvorks by William Gandy of Exeter, whose broad and&nbsp;forcible execution must have been an excellent corrective&nbsp;to the example of Hudson’s dry and hard method.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Meanwhile the pleasant urbanity of manner which distinguished Reynolds throughout life had been winning for him friends. He had made the acquaintance of Lord&nbsp;Edgcumbe, and by him was introduced to Captain (afterwards Viscount Keppel), who was to play an important and&nbsp;helpful part in the career of the young painter. Keppel was&nbsp;soon made aware of Reynolds’s ardent desire to visit Italy ;&nbsp;and, as he had just been appointed to the command of the&nbsp;Mediterranean squadron, he gracefully invited the artist to&nbsp;accompany him in his own ship, the “ Centurion.” The&nbsp;offer was gladly accepted. While Keppel was conducting&nbsp;his tedious negotiations with the dey of Algiers, relative&nbsp;to the piracy with which that potentate was charged,&nbsp;Reynolds resided at Port Mahon, the guest of the governor&nbsp;of Minorca, painting portraits of the principal inhabitants ;&nbsp;and, in December 1749, he sailed for Leghorn, and thence,&nbsp;with all eagerness, made his way to Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">He has confessed that his first sight of the works of Raphael was a grievous disappointment, and that it&nbsp;required lengthened study before he could appreciate the&nbsp;correctness and grace of the master. By the dignity and&nbsp;imagination of Michelangelo he was deeply impressed ;&nbsp;to the end of life the great Florentine remained for&nbsp;Reynolds the supreme figure in art; his name was constantly upon his lips, and, as he had wished, it was the last&nbsp;that he pronounced to the students of the Royal Academy.&nbsp;Of the influence of Correggio, of his sweetness of expression,&nbsp;of his method of chiaroscuro, we find frequent traces in the&nbsp;works of Sir Joshua, especially in his paintings of children ;&nbsp;but after all it was from the Venetians that the English&nbsp;painter learned most. His own strongest instincts were&nbsp;towards richness and splendour of colour, and in these&nbsp;qualities he found unsurpassable examples in the productions of Titian and Veronese.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">While in Rome he avoided, as far as possible, the temptation to spend his time in copying specific pictures,&nbsp;which he considered “ a delusive kind of industry,” by&nbsp;which “ the student satisfies himself with an appearance of&nbsp;doing something, and falls into the dangerous habit of&nbsp;imitating without selecting.” His method of becoming&nbsp;acquainted with the old masters, and of assimilating their&nbsp;excellences, was by diligent examination and comparison,&nbsp;aided by studies of general effect and of individual parts.&nbsp;His knowledge of the Roman art treasures was dearly&nbsp;purchased. While working in the corridors of the Vatican&nbsp;he caught a severe cold, which resulted in the deafness&nbsp;that clung to him for the rest of his life, and rendered&nbsp;necessary the ear-trumpet which he used in conversation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">After a residence of two years in Rome, Reynolds, in the spring of 1752, spent four months in visiting Parma,&nbsp;Florence, Venice, and other important cities of Italy; and,&nbsp;after a brief stay in Devonshire, he established himself as</span></p>
