<p><span class="font0">had been strengthened by the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">hattisherij</span><span class="font0"> of 1802; while the treaties of 1812, 1826 and 1829 had respectively yielded up&nbsp;Bessarabia, the Sulina mouth of the Danube and the St George&nbsp;mouth to the tsar. From 1834 to 1848 the Russian consul at&nbsp;Bucharest was all-powerful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The revolutionary movement of 1848 extended from the Rumans of Hungary and Transylvania to their kinsmen of the&nbsp;Transalpine regions. Here its real object was the overthrow of Russian influence. In Moldavia the agitation&nbsp;was mostly confined to the boiars, and the hospodar</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Michael Sturdza succeeded in arresting the ringleaders. In Walachia, however, the outbreak took a more violent form.&nbsp;The people assembled at Bucharest, and demanded a constitution. Prince Bibescu, after setting his signature to the constitution submitted to him, fled to Transylvania, and a&nbsp;provisional government was formed. The Turks, however,&nbsp;urged thereto by Russian diplomacy, crossed the Danube, and a&nbsp;joint Russo-Turkish dictatorship restored the Organic Law.&nbsp;By the Balta-Liman convention of r849 the two governments&nbsp;agreed to the appointment of Barbti Stirbeiu (Stirbey) as prince&nbsp;of Walachia, and Gregory Ghica for Moldavia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On the entry of the Russian troops into the principalities in 18553, the hospodars fled to Vienna, leaving the government in&nbsp;the hands of their ministers. During the Danubian&nbsp;campaign that now ensued great suffering was inflicted&nbsp;on the inhabitants, but in 1854 the cabinet of Vienna&nbsp;induced the Russians to withdraw. Austrian troops&nbsp;occupied the principalities, and the hospodars returned&nbsp;to their posts. One important consequence of the revolution had&nbsp;been the banishment of many rising politicians to western&nbsp;Europe, where they were brought into contact with a higher&nbsp;type of civilization. The practice initiated by the more liberal&nbsp;Phanariotes of sending Rumanian students to the French,&nbsp;German and Italian universities tended in the same direction.&nbsp;Statesmen such as I. C. Bratianu, D. A. Sturdza, S. I. Ghica, D.&nbsp;Ghica and Lascar Catargiu (whose biographies are given under&nbsp;separate headings) received their political training abroad, and&nbsp;returned to educate their countrymen. To this fact the&nbsp;surprisingly rapid progress of Rumania, as compared with the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Balkan States, may very largely be attributed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">By the treaty of Paris in 1856 the principalities with their existing privileges were placed under the collective guarantee&nbsp;of the contracting Powers, while remaining under the&nbsp;suzerainty of the Porte—the Porte on its part engaging to respect the complete independence of their&nbsp;internal administration. A strip of southern Bessarabia was&nbsp;restored to Moldavia, so as to push back ¿he Russian frontier&nbsp;from the Danube mouth. The existing laws and statutes of&nbsp;both principalities were to be revised by a European Commission, sitting at Bucharest, and their work was to be&nbsp;assisted by a Divan or national council which the Porte was&nbsp;to convoke for the purpose in each of the two provinces,&nbsp;and in which all classes of Walachian and Moldavian society&nbsp;were to be represented. The European commission, in arriving at its conclusions, was to take into consideration the&nbsp;opinion expressed by the representative councils; the Powers&nbsp;were to come to terms with the Porte as to the recommendations of the commission; and the final result was to be&nbsp;embodied in a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">hattisherij</span><span class="font0"> of the sultan, which was to lay down&nbsp;the definitive organization of the two principalities. In 1857 the&nbsp;commission arrived, and the representative councils of the&nbsp;two peoples were convoked. On their meeting in September&nbsp;they at once proceeded to vote with unanimity the&nbsp;union of the two principalities into a single state under&nbsp;the name of’ Romania (Rumania), to be governed by&nbsp;a foreign prince elected from one of the reigning&nbsp;dynasties of Europe, and having a single representative assembly.&nbsp;The Powers decided to undo the work of national union. By&nbsp;the convention concluded by the European congress at Paris in&nbsp;1858, it was decided that the principalities should continue as&nbsp;heretofore to be governed each by its own prince. Walachia&nbsp;and Moldavia were to have separate assemblies, but a central</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">commission was to be established at Fokshani for the preparation of laws of common interest, which were afterwards to be submitted to the respective assemblies. In accordance with&nbsp;this convention the deputies of Moldavia and Walachia met in&nbsp;separate assemblies at Bucharest and Jassy, but the choice&nbsp;of both fell unanimously on Prince Alexander John Cuza&nbsp;(January 1859).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A. J. E.; X.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(5) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rumania.—</span><span class="font0">Thus the union of the Rumanian nation&nbsp;was accomplished. A new conference met in Paris to discuss&nbsp;the situation, and in 1861 the election of Prince Cuza&nbsp;was ratified by the Powers and the Porte. The two&nbsp;assemblies and the central commission were preserved&nbsp;till 1862, when a single assembly met at Bucharest and a single&nbsp;ministry was formed for the two countries. The central commission was at the same time abolished, and a council of state&nbsp;charged with preparing bills substituted for it. In May 1864,&nbsp;owing to difficulties between the government and the general&nbsp;assembly, the assembly was dissolved, and a statute was submitted to universal suffrage giving greater authority to the prince,&nbsp;and creating two chambers (of senators and of deputies). The&nbsp;franchise was now extended to all citizens, a cumulative voting&nbsp;power being reserved, however, for property, and the peasantry&nbsp;were emancipated from forced labour. Up to this point the&nbsp;prince ha&lt;J ruled wisely; he had founded the universities of&nbsp;Bucharest and Jassy; his reforms had swept away the last&nbsp;vestiges of feudalism and created a class of peasant freeholders.&nbsp;But the closing years of his reign were marked by an attempt&nbsp;to concentrate all power in his own hands. He strove to&nbsp;realize his democratic ideals by despotic methods. His very&nbsp;reforms alienated the goodwill of all classes; of the nobles, by&nbsp;the abolition of forced labour; of the clergy, by the confiscation&nbsp;of monastic estates; of the masses, by the introduction of a&nbsp;tobacco monopoly and the inevitable collapse of the inflated&nbsp;hopes to which his agrarian reforms had given rise. His own&nbsp;dissolute conduct increased his unpopularity, and at last the&nbsp;leading statesmen in both provinces, who had long believed&nbsp;that the national welfare demanded the election of a foreign&nbsp;prince, conspired to dethrone him. In February 1866 he was&nbsp;compelled to abdicate; and a council of regency was formed&nbsp;under the presidency of Prince Ion Ghica. The count of&nbsp;Flanders, brother to the king of the Belgians, was proclaimed&nbsp;hospodar of the united provinces, but declined the proffered&nbsp;honour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Meanwhile a conference of the Powers assembled at Paris and decided by a majority of four to three that the new hospodar&nbsp;should be a native of the country. The principalities,&nbsp;however, determined to elect Prince Charles, the&nbsp;second son of Prince Charles Antony of Hohenzollem-Sigmaringen. On a referendum, 685,969 electors&nbsp;voted in his favour, against 224 dissentients. Prince Charles&nbsp;was an officer in the Prussian army, twenty-seven years of age,&nbsp;and was related to the French imperial family as well as to the&nbsp;royal house of Prussia: his nomination obtained not only the&nbsp;tacit consent and approval of his friend and kinsman King&nbsp;William of Prussia, but also the warm and more open support&nbsp;of Napoleon III. The king of Prussia, however, had agreed&nbsp;that the new hospodar should be a native of the principalities,&nbsp;and could not therefore openly approve of Prince Charles’s&nbsp;election. Acting on the advice of Bismarck, the prince asked&nbsp;for a short leave of absence, resigned his commission in the&nbsp;Prussian army on crossing the frontier, and hastened down&nbsp;the Danube to Rumania, under a feigned name and with a&nbsp;false passport. On the 20th of May he landed at Tumu.&nbsp;Severin, where he was enthusiastically welcomed. He reached&nbsp;Bucharest on the 22nd, and on the same day, in the presence&nbsp;of the provisional government, took the oaths to respect the&nbsp;laws of the country and to maintain its rights and the integrity&nbsp;of its territory. In October Prince Charles proceeded to&nbsp;Constantinople and was cordially received by his suzerain,&nbsp;the sultan, who bestowed on him the firman of investiture,&nbsp;admitted the principle of hereditary succession in his family,&nbsp;and allowed him the right of maintaining an army of 30,000</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
