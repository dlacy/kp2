<p><span class="font0">vides into several deltoid branches, the largest of which is 1260 feet across, and bears along a mass of about 74,000&nbsp;cubic feet of water in a second, while the Nile in the same&nbsp;time furnishes but 21,800 cubic feet. It moves at the rate&nbsp;of about two miles and one furlong in an hour ; but notwithstanding the immense mass of water which is borne&nbsp;along, and the speed with which it moves, taking one year&nbsp;with another, for five months of the year the navigation is&nbsp;interrupted by its being frozen over, the ice sometimes exceeding three feet in thickness. 3. The Diina, or Southern&nbsp;Dvina. This river originates in a fen on the western declivities of the forest of Volkonskoi, in the government of&nbsp;Tver, not far from the sources of the Volga. It soon becomes deep enough to be navigable, but its course is broken&nbsp;by falls and sand-banks ; it falls into the Bay of Riga, without having received any affluents of importance on its way.&nbsp;4. The Niemen, which rises in the forests of Kopislov, in&nbsp;the government of Minsk. It flows first in a northerly direction, and then bending to the west, enters Prussia under&nbsp;the name of Memel. On the right it receives the Vilia, a&nbsp;navigable stream ; and on tile left one or two others, but&nbsp;they are small and unimportant. 5. The Vistula. This&nbsp;river rises in the principality of Teschen, in Eastern Silesia,&nbsp;at the foot of the western Carpathian range of mountains.&nbsp;It flows in an easterly direction to Cracow, where it becomes navigable, and as far as Sandomir forms the boundary line between Gallicia and Poland. Amongst its confluents, the most important are, the Bug, which originates&nbsp;on the northern side of a chain or lofty ridge of hills separating the chalky lands of Volhynia from the rich plains of&nbsp;Podolia ; the Priepetz, a feeder of the Dnieper, which unites&nbsp;the Bug and the Niemen in spring and autumn ; and at Sie-rock it receives theNarew,ariverwhich flows from the plains&nbsp;of Lithuania, and is believed by the common people to be&nbsp;fatal to water-snakes. Its other tributaries are tile Pilica,&nbsp;which originates in the heights above Warsaw ; the San,&nbsp;which rises not far from the sources of the Dniester ; and&nbsp;the Bzura. 6. The Wartha. This river rises in a plateau&nbsp;near Kromolow, in Cracow, flows in a broad channel like&nbsp;the Vistula, and inundates the neighbouring fields. After&nbsp;receiving the Ner, it becomes navigable, and though not so&nbsp;deep as the Vistula, has the appearance of a large river.&nbsp;After receiving the Prosna, which for a great distance forms&nbsp;the boundary between Poland and Prussia, the Wartha enters the Prussian territory, and adds its waters to the Oder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Baltic, the Black Sea, and the Caspian, will be found described in this work, each under its own proper head.&nbsp;In the foregoing account of the rivers of Russia, we have&nbsp;noticed four of the most considerable sheets of water in&nbsp;this country. Deep in the interior are a few pretty large&nbsp;collections of water ; but lakes are not a characteristic of&nbsp;Russia, except in the north-west part, where Finland is situated. Here immense numbers of winding lakes of varied&nbsp;form and dimensions intersect the country in all directions,&nbsp;giving rise to numerous rivers ; but none of them irrigates a&nbsp;great extent of country. All these, surrounded by flat and&nbsp;bleak shores and frozen plains, present little that is striking in point of scenery, and afford few facilities for internal intercourse. The coasts of Russia are deeply penetrated by large arms of the sea, forming gulfs, bays, and&nbsp;the like. Besides the Black and Baltic Seas, we have the&nbsp;Sea of Kara, which is the most easterly, and bathes at once&nbsp;Europe and Asia. It is four hundred and fifty miles in&nbsp;length ; but navigation is almost constantly interrupted by&nbsp;ice at its northern entrance. On the extreme west is the&nbsp;Bieloe More, or White Sea, which itself embosoms a number of bays and gulfs of considerable size. The largest of&nbsp;these are the Gulfs of Mezen, Dvina, and Onega, so called&nbsp;from the rivers which flow into them; and Kandalask, which&nbsp;communicates with Lake Kovdozero. The White Sea is&nbsp;about the same length as that of Kara, with a breadth of&nbsp;from sixty to seventy miles. Between these two great inlets of the Arctic Ocean occur other gulfs, the most consi-derable being Tcheskaia, which is separated from the White&nbsp;Sea by the peninsula of Kaniskaia Zemlia, and that formed&nbsp;to the east of this by the estuary of the river Petchora.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The extensive inlets of the sea above mentioned of course form numerous promontories and other projections of land.&nbsp;In looking over a good map, the most striking which meets&nbsp;the eye is Cape Kamin or Canin, the north-western extremity of the peninsula of Kaniskaia Zemlia. This neck of&nbsp;land, which Separatesthe GulfofTcheskaiafrom the White&nbsp;Sea, stretches directly north into the Arctic Ocean, a distance of about 150 miles. Its breadth is between forty and&nbsp;fifty miles. Cape Onega projects into the White Sea near&nbsp;the bottom of that gulf, and forms the Bay of Archangel on&nbsp;the north-east, and the Bay of Onega on the south-west.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In European Russia, the predominating kinds of rocks, or, to use the language of geology, formations, are tertiary and&nbsp;alluvial ; those of an older date, says Professor Jameson,&nbsp;namely, the secondary, transition, and primitive series, occupying but comparatively small space. The two latter occur&nbsp;in the Ural chain, in Finland, and Russian Lapland, in some&nbsp;parts of Karelia, Olonetz<sub>1</sub> Crimea, Caucasus, the Valdai&nbsp;plateau, and Sandomir Mountains, Revel, the country&nbsp;around Lake Ilmen and Vologda, and the tract extending&nbsp;from Brody across the Bug and the Dnieper. The secondary lands frequently appear rising like little islands in the&nbsp;great Russo-Polish plains. Amongst the formations of this&nbsp;class of rocks are found coal, lime, gypsum, chalk, and salt,&nbsp;which will be afterwards noticed. The tertiary rocks,&nbsp;which occupy vast tracts of the low country, are clay,&nbsp;loam, limestone, brown coal, with gypsum, and in many&nbsp;tracts, as in Austrian Poland, rich deposits of rock-salt.&nbsp;There is a tertiary limestone almost peculiar to this part&nbsp;of Europe, and extensively distributed throughout Poland,&nbsp;Podolia, and Southern Russia. “ It occurs, however,”&nbsp;says Jameson, “ in the basin of Vienna, and Hungary, and&nbsp;in France. It is the last dépôt of that sea which covered&nbsp;all the country to the north of the Carpathians, from the&nbsp;Baltic Sea to the foot of that chain, and to the Black Sea,&nbsp;in the middle of which rose the mountains of Sandomir,&nbsp;and the plateau south-west, in the form of islands. It is&nbsp;covered by a marly clay, and a sand formed by the last&nbsp;great alluvial catastrophe, which gave to Europe its present form, and buried in its dépôts remains of unknown&nbsp;species of the elephant, mastodon, rhinoceros, &amp;c.” In&nbsp;Central Poland there is a clay, with lignite or brown coal,&nbsp;resting upon chalk, which is supposed by some geologists&nbsp;to be the oldest members of the tertiary formations. The&nbsp;alluvial formation consists of an old and new deposit, the former being composed of a great stratum of marly clay or loam,&nbsp;interspersed with numerous blocks of granite and other&nbsp;primitive rocks. It covers vast tracts of country in Poland,&nbsp;varying in thickness from thirty to a hundred feet. The&nbsp;soil which it forms in the south of Poland is excellent ; but&nbsp;as it advances northward it becomes less and less productive, and more and more intermixed with sands, gravels,&nbsp;and primitive blocks. It is this deposit which contains&nbsp;such an immense quantity of fossil remains of animals, including great whales. An alluvial sand, different from the&nbsp;sand of rivers, is widely distributed in Poland, and connected&nbsp;with the great sandy plain of Northern Germany. Vast&nbsp;numbers of large and small primary blocks occur in this&nbsp;plain, and which, from their identity with the rocks of&nbsp;Sweden and Finland, it is believed, on good grounds, have&nbsp;been transported from these countries by a débâcle flowing&nbsp;from the north-east to the south-west. The same débâcle&nbsp;has also formed the marly clay or alluvial loam ; it has interred the elephants and other animals of unknown antiquity ; it has broken up the chalk plains of the north, and&nbsp;separated Denmark from Sweden, and, in general, given to</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
