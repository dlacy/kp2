<p><span class="font0">asserted their supremacy, but in 1618 the Porte once more recovered its dominion and set up successively two creatures&nbsp;of its own as voivodes—Gratiani, an Italian who had been&nbsp;court jeweller, and a Greek custom-house official, Alexander.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As in Walachia at a somewhat later date, the Phanariotc régime seemed now thoroughly established in Moldavia, and&nbsp;it became the rule that every three years the voivode&nbsp;should procure his confirmation by a large baksheesh,&nbsp;and every year by a smaller one. But Prince Basil&nbsp;the Wolf (Vasilie Lupul), an Albanian, who succeeded&nbsp;in 1634, showed great ability, and for twenty years maintained&nbsp;his position on the Moldavian throne. He introduced several&nbsp;internal reforms, codified the written and unwritten laws of&nbsp;the country, established a printing press, Greek monastic&nbsp;schools, and also a Latin school. He brought the Moldavian&nbsp;Church into more direct relation with the patriarch of Constantinople, but also showed considerable favour to the Latins,&nbsp;allowing them to erect churches at Suciava, Jassy and Galatz.&nbsp;The last voivode of the Bâssaraba family, Elias Voda, reigned</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">from 1667 to 1669.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">During the wars between Sobieski, king of Poland (1674-96), and the Turks, Moldavia found itself between hammer and anvil, and suffered terribly from Tatar devastations. The&nbsp;voivode Duka was forced like his Walachian contemporary to&nbsp;supply a contingent for the siege of Vienna in 1683. After&nbsp;Sobieski's death in 1696, the hopes of Moldavia turned to the&nbsp;advancing Muscovite power. In 1711 the voivode&nbsp;Demetrius Cantemir, rendered desperate by the&nbsp;Turkish exactions, concluded an agreement with the&nbsp;tsar Peter the Great by which Moldavia was to become a&nbsp;protected and vassal state of Russia, with the enjoyment of&nbsp;its traditional liberties, the voivodeship to be hereditary in&nbsp;the family of Cantemir. On the approach of the Russian&nbsp;army the prince issued a proclamation containing the terms&nbsp;of the Russian protectorate and calling on the boiars and&nbsp;people to aid their Orthodox deliverers. But the long Turkish&nbsp;terrorism had done its work, and at the approach of a Turkish&nbsp;and Tatar host the greater part of the Moldavians deserted&nbsp;their voivode. The Russian campaign was unsuccessful, and&nbsp;all that Peter could offer Cantemir and the boiars who had</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">stood by him was an asylum on Russian soil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In his Russian exile Cantemir composed in a fair Latin style his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Descriptio Moldaviae,</span><span class="font0"> the counterpart, so far as Moldavia&nbsp;is concerned, to Del Chiaro’s contemporary description of Walachia. The capital of the country was&nbsp;now Jassy, to which city Stephen the Great had transferred his court from Suciava, the earlier residence of&nbsp;the voivodes. It had at this time forty churches—&nbsp;some of stone, some of wood. Fifty years before it had contained 12,000 houses, but Tatar devastations had reduced it&nbsp;to a third of its former size. The most important commercial&nbsp;emporium was the Danubian port of Galatz, which was frequented by vessels from the whole of the Levant from Trebizond&nbsp;to Barbary. The cargoes which they here took in consisted of&nbsp;Moldavian timber (oak, deal and cornel), grain, butter, honey&nbsp;and wax, salt and nitre. Kilia, at the north mouth of the&nbsp;Danube, was also frequented by trading vessels, including&nbsp;Venetian and Ragusan. Moldavian wine was exported to&nbsp;Poland, Russia, Transylvania, and Hungary; that of Cotnar&nbsp;was in Cantemir’s opinion superior to Tokay. The excellence&nbsp;of the Moldavian horses is attested by a Turkish proverb;&nbsp;and annual droves of as many as 40,000 Moldavian oxen were&nbsp;sent across Poland to Danzig. Moldavia proper was divided&nbsp;into the upper country or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Verra de sus,</span><span class="font0"> and the lower country,&nbsp;or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Verra de josu.</span><span class="font0"> Bessarabia had been detached from the&nbsp;rest of the principality and placed under the direct control of&nbsp;the military, authorities. It was divided into four provinces:&nbsp;that of Budzak, inhabited by the Nogai Tatars; that of&nbsp;Cetatea Alba, the Greek Monkastron, a strongly fortified place;&nbsp;and those of Ismaila and Kilia. The voivodes owed their&nbsp;nomination entirely to the Porte, and the great officers of the&nbsp;realm were appointed at their discretion. These were the</span></p>

The boiars&nbsp;were able to try minor cases in their own residences, but subject&nbsp;to the right of appeal to the prince’s tribunal. Of the character of the Moldavian people Cantemir does not give a very&nbsp;favourable account. Their best points were their hospitality&nbsp;and, in Lower Moldavia, their valour. They cared little for&nbsp;letters, and were generally indolent, and their prejudice against&nbsp;mercantile pursuits left the commerce of the country in the&nbsp;hands of Armenians, Jews, Greeks and Turks. The pure-blood Ruman population, noble and plebeian, inhabited the&nbsp;cities and towns or larger villages; the peasantry were mostly&nbsp;of Little Russian and Hungarian race, and were in a servile&nbsp;condition. There was a considerable gipsy population, almost&nbsp;every boiar having several Zingar families in his possession;&nbsp;these were mostly smiths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">From this period onwards the character of the Ottoman domination in Moldavia is in every respect analogous to that&nbsp;of Walachia. The office of voivode or hospodar was&nbsp;farmed out by the Porte to a succession of wealthy&nbsp;Greeks from the Phanar quarter of Constantinople.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">All formality of election by the boiars was now dispensed with, and the princes received their </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">caftan</span><span class="font0"> of office at Constantinople, where they were consecrated by the&nbsp;Greek patriarch. The system favoured Turkish extortion in&nbsp;two ways: the presence of the voivode’s family connexions at&nbsp;Stambul gave the Porte so many hostages for his obedience;&nbsp;on the other hand the princes themselves could not rely on&nbsp;any support due to family influence in Moldavia itself. They&nbsp;were thus mere puppets of the Divan, and could be deposed&nbsp;and shifted with the same facility as so many pashas—an object&nbsp;of Turkish policy, as each change was a pretext for a new levy&nbsp;of baksheesh. The chief families that shared the office during&nbsp;this period were those of Mavrocordato, Ghica, Callimachi,&nbsp;Ypsilanti and Murusi. Although from the very conditions&nbsp;of their creation they regarded the country as a field for exploitations, they were themselves often men of education and&nbsp;ability, and unquestionably made some praiseworthy attempts&nbsp;to promote the general culture and well-being of their subjects.&nbsp;In this respect, even the Phanariote régime was preferable to&nbsp;mere pasha rule, while it had the further consequence of preserving intact the national form of administration and the&nbsp;historic offices of Moldavia. Gregory Ghica (1774—77), who&nbsp;himself spoke French and Italian, founded a school or “ gymnasium ” at Jassy, where Greek, Latin and theology wære&nbsp;taught in a fashion. He encouraged the settlement of German&nbsp;Protestant colonists in the country, some of whom set up as&nbsp;watchmakers in Jassy, where they were further allow’ed to&nbsp;build an evangelical church. J. L. Carra, a Swiss who had&nbsp;been tutor to Prince Ghica’s children, and who published in&nbsp;1781 an account of the actual state of the principalities, speaks&nbsp;of some of the boiars as possessing a taste for French literature&nbsp;and even for the works of Voltaire, a tendency actively combated by the patriarch of Constantinople.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Russo-Turkish War, which ended in the peace of Kutchuk Kainardji (1774)7 was fatal to the integrity of Moldavian&nbsp;territory. The house of Austria, which had already&nbsp;annexed Galicia in 1772, profited by the situation to&nbsp;arrange with both contending parties for the peaceful cession of Bukovina to the Habsburg monarchy.&nbsp;This richly wooded Moldavian province, containing Suciava</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
