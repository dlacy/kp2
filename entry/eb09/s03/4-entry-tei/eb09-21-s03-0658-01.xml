His family was noble and not poor, but its fortunes were ruined by the Revolution. Before that event, however, Sénancour had met with mishap. He was a sickly youth and was destined for the church, but ran away from home and established himself in Switzerland. Here he married and spent some years ; his wife died, and he returned to Paris about the end of the century. In 1804 he published the singular book entitled <hi rend="italic">Obermann,</hi> which has continued to be in a fashion popular to the present day, and the next year a treatise <hi rend="italic">De l' Amour,</hi> which had even more vogue at first, but is now little read. <hi rend="italic">Obermann,</hi> which is to a great extent inspired by Rousseau, which attracted the admiration of George Sand, and which had</p><p>a considerable influence over the last generation in France and England, is a series of letters supposed to be written by a solitary and melancholy person, whose headquarters were in a valley of the Jura, but who writes also from divers other places. The style is meritorious, the descriptive power very considerable, the thought sometimes original, and the expression of a certain form of the <hi rend="italic">maladie du siècle</hi> effective and striking. But, viewed from the strictly critical point of view, there is perhaps a certain unreality about the book. Its idiosyncrasy in the large class of Wertherian-Byronic literature has justly enough been said to be that the hero, instead of feeling the vanity of things, recognizes his own inability to be and do what he wishes. Sénancour is tinged to some extent with the older <hi rend="italic">philosophe</hi> form of freethinking, and expresses less revolt from the 18th century than Chateaubriand. Having no resources but his pen, Sénancour during the half-century which elapsed between his return to France and his death at St Cloud in February 1846 was driven to literary hack work, and even his more independent productions have none of the attraction of <hi rend="italic">Obermann.</hi> When George Sand and Sainte-Beuve revived interest in this latter, Thiers and Villemain successively obtained for the author from Louis Philippe pensions which enabled him to pass his last days in comfort. He committed the usual mistake of writing late in life a continuation to <hi rend="italic">Obermann,</hi> entitled <hi rend="italic">Isabelle</hi> (1833), but it has been wisely forgotten.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
