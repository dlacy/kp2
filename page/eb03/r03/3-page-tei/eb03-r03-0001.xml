            <p>ROOF CONTD threads, or props, of planes, and we may ſubſtitute the one for the other. We ſhall
                find this ſubſtſtution extremely uſeful, becauſe we eaſily conceive diſtinct notions
                of the ſupport of a body by ſtrings.</p>
            <p>Obſerve farther, that if the whole figure be inverted, and ſtrings be ſubſtituted for
                props, and props for ſtrings, the equilibrium will ſtill obtain : for by comparing
                fig. 5. with fig. 6. we ſee that the vertical line through the centre of gravity
                will paſe through the in-terſection of the two ſtrings or props.; and this is
                all that is lſeceſſary for the equilibrium : only it muſt be obſerved in the
                ſubſtſtution of props for threads, and of threads for props, that it it be done
                without inverting the whole figure, a ſtable equilibrium becomes a tottering one,
                and <hi rend="italic">vice verſa.</hi></p>
            <p>This is a moſt uſeſul propoſition, eſpecially to the unlettered artiſan, and enables
                him to make a practical life of problems which the greateſt mechanical geniuſes have
                found no eaſy taſk to ſolve. An inſtance will  ſhow the extent and utility of it.
                Suppoſe it were required to make a manſard or kirb roof whoſe width is AB (fig. 7.),
                and conſiſting of the four equal rafters AC, CD, DE, EB. There can be no doubt but
                that its beſt form is that which will put all the parts in equilibrio, ſo that no
                ties or ſtays may be neceſſary for oppoſing the unbalanced thruſt of any part of it.
                Make a chain <hi rend="italic">a c d e b</hi> (fig. 8.) of four equal pieces,
                looſely connected by pin-joints, round which the parts are perfectly moveable.
                Suſpend this from two pins <hi rend="italic">a, b,</hi> fixed in a horizontal line.
                This chain or feſtoon will arrange itſelf in ſuch a form that its parts are in
                equilibrio. Then we know that if the figure be inverted, it will compoſe the frame
                or truſs of a kirb-roof <hi rend="italic">α</hi><hi rend="italic">γ </hi>ς<hi
                    rend="italic"> b, </hi>which is alſo in equilibrio, the thruſts of the pieces
                balancing each other in the ſame manner that the mutual pulls of the hanging feſtoon
                    <hi rend="italic">a c d e b</hi> did. If the proportion of the height <hi
                    rend="italic">d f</hi> to the width <hi rend="italic">a, b</hi> is not ſuch
                as pleaſes, let the pins <hi rend="italic">a,</hi><hi rend="italic">b</hi> be placed
                nearer or more diſtant, till a proportion between the width and height is obtained
                which pleaſes, and then make the figure ACDEB fig. 7. ſimilar to it. It is evident
                that this propoſition will apply in the ſame manner to the determination of the form
                of an arch of a bridge ; but this is not a proper place for a farther
                diſcuſſion.</p>
            <p>We are now able to compute all the thruſts and other preſſures which are exerted by
                the parts of a roof on each other and on the walls. Let AB (fig. 9.) be a beam
                ſtanding anyhow obliquely, and G its centre of gravity. Let us ſuppoſe that the ends
                of it are ſup-ported in any directions AC, BD, by ſtrings, props, or planes. Let
                theſe directions meet in the point P of the vertical line PG paſſing through its
                centre of gravity. Through G draw lines G<hi rend="italic">a</hi>, <hi rend="italic"
                    >G</hi><hi rend="italic">b</hi> parallel to PB, PA. Then</p>

            <p>It cannot be diſputed that, if ſtrength alone be conſidered, the proper form of a
                roof is that which puts the whole in equilibrio, ſo that it would remain in
                that ſhape although all the joints were perfectly looſe or flexible. If it has any
                other ſhape, additional ties or braces are neceſſary for preſerving it, and the
                parts are unneceſſarily ſtrained. When this equilibrium is obtained, the rafters
                which compoſe the roof are all acting on each other in the direction of their
                lengths ; and by this action, combined with their weights, they ſuſtain no ſtrain
                but that of compreſſion, the ſtrain of all others that they are the moſt able to
                reſiſt. We may conſider them as ſo many inflexible lines having their
                weights accumulated in their centres of gravity. But it will allow an eaſier
                inveſtigation of the ſubject, if we ſuppoſe the weights to be at the joints, equal
                to the real vertical preſſures which are exerted on theſe points. Theſe are very
                easily computed: for it is plain, that the weight of the beam AB (fig. 9.) is to the
                part of this weight that is ſupported at B as AB to AG. Therefore, if W repreſent
                the weight of the beam, the vertical preſ-</p>
            <p>AG</p>
            <p>ſure at B will be W X AB, and the vertical preſſure BG </p>
            <p>at A will be W × AB∙ In like manner, the prop BF</p>
            <p>being conſidered as another beam, and <hi rend="italic">f</hi> as its centre of
                gravity and <hi rend="italic">w</hi> as its weight, a part of this weight, equal to
                    <hi rend="italic">w</hi>    is ſupported at B, and the whole vertical</p>
            <p>AG    <hi rend="italic">f</hi> F</p>
            <p>preſſure at B is W X -+<hi rend="italic">w</hi> ×BF∙ And thus we greatly Amplify the
                conduction of the mutual thruſts of roof frames. We need hardly obſerve, that
                although theſe preſſures by which the parts of a frame ſupport each other in
                oppoſition to the vertical action of gravity, are always exerted in the direction of
                the pieces, they may be reſolved into preſſures acting in any other direction which
                may engage our attention.</p>
            <p>All that we propoſe to deliver on this ſubject at preſent may be included in the
                following propoſition.</p>
            <p>Let ABCDE (fig· 10.) be an aſſemblage of rafters in a vertical plane, retting on two
                fixed points A and E in a horizontal line, and perfectly moveable round all the
                joints A, B, C, D, E ; and let it be ſuppoſed to be in equilibrio, and let us
                inveſtigate what adjuſtment of the different circumſtances of weight and inclination
                of its different parts is neceſſary for producing this equilibrium.</p>
            <p>Let F, G, H, I, be the centres of gravity of the diſſerent rafters, and let theſe
                letters expreſs the weights of each. Then (by what has been ſaid above) the
                weight</p>
            <p>AF</p>
            <p>which preſſes B directly downwards is F X + G X</p>
            <p>CG        BG</p>
            <p>The weight on C is in like manner G X BC+</p>
            <p>DH CH El H × and that on D is H X CD + I ×DE∙</p>
            <p>Let A <hi rend="italic">b e</hi> JE be the figure ABCDE inverted, in the manner
                already deſcribed. It may be conceived as a thread faſtened at A and E, and loaded
                at <hi rend="italic">b. c<hi rend="sub">i</hi></hi> and</p>
