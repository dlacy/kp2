<p><span class="font0">than one pair of premolars, and the original ridges of all the cheekteeth have become obscured and complicated by the development of secondary enamel-folds. The majority of these rodents, many of&nbsp;which are of large size, are terrestrial, but a few are burrowing,&nbsp;others arboreal and two or three aquatic. *</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Old World porcupines, constituting the family Hystricidae, are terrestrial, stoutly built rodents, with limbs of subequal length&nbsp;in front and behind, and the skin covered with strong spines. The&nbsp;upper lip is cleft, the jugal lacks an inferior angle, the fore part of&nbsp;the skull is short and broad; the cheek-teeth arc partially rooted,&nbsp;with external and internal enamel-folds, the soles of the feet are&nbsp;smooth, there are six pairs of teats, the clavicles are imperfect and&nbsp;the tail is not prehensile. In the typical genus </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hystrix,</span><span class="font0"> which</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">is represented in all the three great continents of the Old World, and extends as far east as Flores and Celebes, the skull is swollen&nbsp;and convex, the spines are cylindrical, and the tail is short and&nbsp;covered with spines and slender-stalked open quills. In </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Atherura&nbsp;fascicnlata</span><span class="font0"> of the Malay Peninsula the spines are flattened, and the&nbsp;tails long and scaly, with a tuft of compressed bristles. A closely&nbsp;allied species, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">A. africana,</span><span class="font0"> inhabits Western Africa. The third&nbsp;genus is </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Trichys</span><span class="font0"> (see Porcupine).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">American Porcupines.—</span><span class="font0">All the New World porcupines, representing the family Erethizontidae (or Coendidae) are arboreal in their habits, and have the upper lip undivided, the cheek-teeth rooted,&nbsp;the clavicles complete, the soles of the feet tuberculated and three&nbsp;pairs of teats. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Erethizon dorsatus,</span><span class="font0"> the urson, is distributed all over&nbsp;the forest regions of North America; </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Synetheres</span><span class="font0"> (or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Coendu) pre-kensilis,</span><span class="font0"> the prehensile-tailed porcupine of South America (fig. 15),&nbsp;represents a genus in which the whole upper surface of the body is&nbsp;protected by long white-tipped spines; </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chaetomys Subspinosus</span><span class="font0"> is&nbsp;clothed with strong wavy bristles. In the last two genera the feet&nbsp;have four toes, in place of the five of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Erethizon</span><span class="font0"> (see Porcupine).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Cavy Group.—</span><span class="font0">ln the family Caviidae, typified by the cavies (or guinea-pigs), may be included a large number of South and Central&nbsp;American rodents, among which the agoutis and pacas are often&nbsp;ranked as a family (Dasyproctidae) by themselves. The Caviidae,&nbsp;in the present more comprehensive sense, include the giants of the&nbsp;rodent order. Many of them, like ungulates, are specialized for swift&nbsp;running, and have unusually long limbs, with ridges developed on&nbsp;the articular surfaces of the lower bones; the clavicles are more or&nbsp;less reduced; the thorax is more compressed than usual, with a&nbsp;narrower breast-bone; and there is a marked tendency to the&nbsp;reduction or loss of the lateral toes, more especially in the hind&nbsp;limb. Since these rodents walk more or less entirely on their toes,&nbsp;in such a manner that the edges of the claws or nails come in contact&nbsp;with the ground, these tend to assume somewhat of a hoof-like&nbsp;character; while the foot-pads are more or less horny. The tail&nbsp;is generally very short, and its basal vertebrae are often fused with&nbsp;the sacrum. In the skull the lachrymal bone is large, the par-occipital process is directed vertically downwards and the tympanic&nbsp;bulla is hollow. In the soft parts the caecum is very large, the penis&nbsp;is armed with a pair of barbed horny claspers and the scrotum is spiny.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Special interest attaches to the most aberrant member of the family, the Peruvian Dinomys, known for more than thirty years&nbsp;only by a single specimen taken in a house in Lima, and only lately&nbsp;rediscovered. It is a large rodent known to the Tupi lndians as&nbsp;the paca-rana, or false paca, in allusion to the resemblance of its&nbsp;coloration to that of the true paca, from which it differs by its veil-developed tail, the absence of cheek-pouches, the full development&nbsp;of all five toes and the wider thorax. The Tupi name may be&nbsp;adopted as the popular title of the species. Dr E. Goeldi states that&nbsp;the paca-rana is a rodent of phlegmatic and gentle disposition,&nbsp;which may account, perhaps, for its rarity, if, indeed, it be really&nbsp;scarce in its native home, which is probably the eastern slopes and&nbsp;tablelands of the Bolivian and Peruvian foot-hills bordering on&nbsp;Brazil, inclusive of the headwaters of the Purus, Acre and Jurua&nbsp;rivers, ln the true pacas, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Coelogenys</span><span class="font0"> (or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Agouti),</span><span class="font0"> the first front toe&nbsp;is small, and both the first and fifth digits of the hind-foot are much&nbsp;inferior in size to the other three. The most remarkable feature&nbsp;of the genus is, however, the extraordinary development of the&nbsp;zygomatic arches of the skull, which are enormously expanded&nbsp;vertically, forming great convex bony capsules on the sides of the&nbsp;face, enclosing on each side a large cavity lined with mucous membrane&nbsp;internally, and communicating by a small opening with the mouth.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">C. paca</span><span class="font0"> is a white-spotted rodent, about 2 ft. long, and lives&nbsp;generally in the forests or along the banks of rivers (see Paca).&nbsp;The Agoutis, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dasyprocta,</span><span class="font0"> include several species of slender-limbed&nbsp;rodents, with three hind-toes, inhabiting Central and South America,&nbsp;one (D. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">cristata)</span><span class="font0"> extending into the West Indian islands. The&nbsp;members of both </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Coelogenys</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dasyprocta</span><span class="font0"> are terrestrial in their&nbsp;habits, and have the fore- and hind-limbs subequal, hoof-like claws,&nbsp;short or obsolete tail and rudimentary clavicles. The masseteric&nbsp;ridge of the lower jaw is obsolete, the palate broad, the incisors&nbsp;long and the molars semi-rooted, with external and internal&nbsp;enamel-folds (see Agouti). The remaining and more typical&nbsp;members of the family, one of which is aquatic, are characterized&nbsp;by their short incisors, the strong masseteric ridges on the sides of&nbsp;the lower jaw, the long and curved par-occipitals and the palate&nbsp;contracted in front. Fore-feet with four digits, hind-feet with&nbsp;three; clavicles imperfect; molars divided by enamel-folds into&nbsp;transverse lobes; milk-teeth shed before birth. In the true cavies,&nbsp;or couies, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Cavia,</span><span class="font0"> the fore- and hind-limbs are short and of subequal&nbsp;length, the ears are short and there is no tail. They include&nbsp;several species widely distributed throughout South America<sub>r&nbsp;</sub>extending even to the straits of Magellan, from one of which (C.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">cutleri</span><span class="font0"> of Peru) the guinea-pig is derived. The maras </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Dolichotis)&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">have the limbs and ears long and the tail very short. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">D. pata·&nbsp;gonica</span><span class="font0"> is a large species, nearly 3 ft. long, inhabiting the&nbsp;gravelly plains of Patagonia, while </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">D. salinicola</span><span class="font0"> is a much smaller&nbsp;rodent from the salt-lagunas of Argentina. The palate is so much&nbsp;contracted in front that the premolars of opposite sides touch by&nbsp;their antero-internal edges. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hydrochaerus,</span><span class="font0"> in which all the feet&nbsp;are fully webbed, includes a single species, the capybara, or carpincho,&nbsp;the largest of living rodents. The skull (fig. 14) is distinguished&nbsp;not only by its great size, but by the enormous development of the&nbsp;par-occipital processes and the complex structure and large size&nbsp;of the last molars (see Cavy and Capybara).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chinchilla Group.—</span><span class="font0">The family, Chinchillidae, typified by the well-known chinchilla, includes a small number of South American rodents with large ears and proportionately great auditory bullae in the&nbsp;skull, elongated hind-limbs, bushy tails, very soft fur and perfect&nbsp;clavicles. The jugal is without an inferior angle, and extends&nbsp;forwards to the lachrymal; the palate is contracted in front and&nbsp;deeply emarginate behind; the incisors are short, and the molars&nbsp;divided by continuous folds into transverse plates; and the two&nbsp;halves of the lower jaw are welded together in front. It includes&nbsp;three existing genera, represented by some five species. Of these&nbsp;the true chinchilla, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chinchilla Ianigera, C. brevicaudata, Lagidium&nbsp;Peruanum</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">L. pallipes,</span><span class="font0"> are restricted to the alpine 2ones of the&nbsp;Andes from the northern boundary of Peru to the southern parts&nbsp;of Chili; while </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lagostomus trIckodactylus</span><span class="font0"> (or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Viscaccia Viscacci a),&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">the viscacha, is confined to the pampas from the Uruguay river to&nbsp;the Rio Negro. In </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chinchilla</span><span class="font0"> the fore-feet have five and the hind&nbsp;four digits, the tail is long and bushy, and the auditory bullae are&nbsp;enormous, appearing on the top of the skull ; </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lagidium</span><span class="font0"> has four digits&nbsp;in both fore- and hind-feet, and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lagostomus</span><span class="font0"> three only in the hind-feet, while the auditory bullae are much smaller (see Chinchilla and&nbsp;Viscacha);</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hutia Group.—</span><span class="font0">The three remaining families of the Hystricoidea, of which one is African while the other two are chiefly South&nbsp;American, are very closely allied and often brigaded in a single&nbsp;family group. In the Capromyidae, which includes only the South&nbsp;American and West Indian hutias, the South American coypu and&nbsp;the African cane-rats, the tympanic bulla of the skull is hollow, the&nbsp;par-occipital process straight, the lachrymal small, and the cheekteeth rooted, with deep enamel-folds; the first front toe being&nbsp;occasionally absent. Of the few living representatives of the&nbsp;group, the genus </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Myocastor</span><span class="font0"> (or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Myopotamus)</span><span class="font0"> is represented. only&nbsp;by the South American coypu, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Μ. coypu,</span><span class="font0"> which is aquatic in its&nbsp;habits, and measures about 2 ft. in length, being the largest&nbsp;member of the group, lt has a long tail, brown fur and red&nbsp;incisors, and lives in burrows near water, feeding on aquatic plants.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
