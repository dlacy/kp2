<hi rend="smallcaps">Charles Alfred</hi> (1786-1821), antiquarian draughtsman, son of Thomas Stothard, noticed below, was born in London on July 5, 1786. After studying in the schools of the Royal Academy, he began, in 1810, his first historical piece, the Death of Richard II. in Pomfret Castle. Having taken a strong interest from an early period in the costumes of different ages and nations, he published in 1811 the first part of his valuable work, <hi rend="italic">The Monumental Effigies of Great Britain.</hi> He was appointed historical draughtsman to the Society of Antiquaries, and was deputed by that body to visit Bayeux, to make drawings of the well-known tapestry. He was made a fellow of the society in 1819, and subsequently engaged in numerous journeys with the view of illustrating the works of D. Lysons. While engaged in tracing a portrait from one of the windows of the church of Beer-Ferrers, Devonshire, he fell and was killed on the spot (May 27, 1821). His widow (afterwards Mrs Bray), along with her brother, completed his <hi rend="italic">Monumental Effigies,</hi> left unfinished at his death. A biography, by his widow, was published in 1823.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
