<p><span class="font1">readjustment. The leading issue was the free coinage of silver under conditions which would have made the monetary standard&nbsp;silver instead of gold, and would have lowered its value. The&nbsp;Democratic convention repudiated Mr Cleveland, accepted free&nbsp;coinage, and nominated W. J. Bryan. The Republicans, at the&nbsp;cost of a formidable party defection, endorsed the gold standard&nbsp;and a highly protective tariff, and nominated William McKinley,&nbsp;whose record and character made him an exceptionally strong&nbsp;candidate. In doing this the Democratic organization became&nbsp;the party of radicalism, the Republican, the party of conservatism. The committal of the Republican party to the maintenance of the gold standard far more than its continued support&nbsp;of high protection, established its position in the reconstructed&nbsp;party system. In doing this it allied its fortunes with those of&nbsp;all the property-holding classes of the country, while retaining&nbsp;in a high degree the confidence of the wage-earners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Period 1897-1910.—</span><span class="font1">During this period there was first a rapid recovery from economic depression, and then ten years of almost&nbsp;unexampled prosperity, followed by two years of moderate&nbsp;depression. But the period is chiefly memorable for the war&nbsp;of 1898 with Spain; for the oversea territorial expansion that&nbsp;followed; for the rise of the so-called policy of imperialism; for&nbsp;the assumption of a far more prominent international rôle; for&nbsp;wide-reaching measures of internal reform; and, lastly, for the&nbsp;establishment of the policy of conserving the natural resources&nbsp;-of the nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Throughout this period the Republican party had undisputed control of the national government. One of the earliest acts in the administration of Mr McKinley was the enactment&nbsp;in 1897 of the highly protective Dingley Tariff. The provision&nbsp;for Reciprocity proved at first of little use. But the need of&nbsp;foreign markets for the rapidly growing output of manufactured&nbsp;products, the rising demand that the interests of the home&nbsp;consumer, as well as those of the producer, should be considered,&nbsp;and the conviction that high protection fostered monopolies,&nbsp;brought about a change of sentiment in the party. Mr McKinley, in his last speech, made at the Buffalo Exposition on the&nbsp;5th of September 1901, gave voice to this change: “ The period&nbsp;of exclusiveness is past. The expansion of our trade and commerce is the pressing problem. Commercial wars are unprofitable. A policy of good will and friendly trade relations&nbsp;will prevent reprisals. Reciprocity treaties are in harmony&nbsp;with the spirit of the times. Measures of retaliation are not.”&nbsp;These views gained headway against the strenuous opposition&nbsp;of the “stand-patters,”@@<sup>1</sup> until revision of the tariff downward was demanded in the platform of 1908, and achieved to&nbsp;.a moderate degree in the Tariff Act of 1909. The party has&nbsp;.also fulfilled its promise to establish the gold monetary standard&nbsp;•on a firm basis. During the war with Spain and in meeting&nbsp;the new problems of colonial empire, the Republican party&nbsp;has again justified its reputation for efficiency. Not less&nbsp;noteworthy has been the policy of the party, initiated and&nbsp;urged by President Theodore Roosevelt and developed by&nbsp;President W. H. Taft for the regulation of railways and all&nbsp;•corporations and trusts engaged in interstate business. The&nbsp;latest important event in the history of the Republican party&nbsp;is the rise of the “ Insurgents,” a group of senators and&nbsp;congressmen whose professed aims are to resist centralization&nbsp;in both party and national government, to lessen the influence of the money power over public policy, to regulate tariff&nbsp;schedules largely in the interest of the consumer, and in brief&nbsp;to emphasize anew the subordination of party and government&nbsp;to the will and service of the people.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">REQUENA, a town of E. Spain, in the province of Valencia; on,.the left bank of the river Magro, and on the railway&nbsp;from Valencia to Uriel. Pop. (1900) 16,236. The town was&nbsp;formerly a Moorish fortress, occupying a strong position in the&nbsp;mountainous region of Las Cabrillas (3400 ft). It is dominated&nbsp;by the ancient citadel of the Moors, and still has traces of the&nbsp;original town walls. There are three ancient parish churches;&nbsp;San Nicolas, the oldest, dates from the 13th century, but was&nbsp;partly restored in 1727. Near the town are the sulphurous&nbsp;springs of Fuentepodrida. The chief industries are the cultivation of grain, fruit and saffron, and the manufacture of wine&nbsp;and silk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">REQUESENS, LUIS DE ZUNIGA Y (? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-1576), Spanish</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">governor of the Netherlands, had the misfortune to succeed the duke of Alva </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.)</span><span class="font1"> and to govern amid hopeless difficulties&nbsp;under the direction of PhiUp II. His early career was that&nbsp;of a government official and diplomatist. In 1563 he gained&nbsp;the king’s confidence as his representative at Rome. In 1568&nbsp;he was appointed lieutenant-general to Don John of Austria&nbsp;during the suppression of the Morisco revolt in Granada, and&nbsp;he also accompanied Don John during the Lepanto campaign;&nbsp;his function being to watch and control his nominal commander-in-chief, whose excitable temperament was distrusted by the&nbsp;king. PhUip must have been satisfied with Requesens, for&nbsp;he named him viceroy in Milan, a post usually given to a great&nbsp;noble. Requesens was only “ a gentleman of cloak and sword ”&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(caballero de capa y espada),</span><span class="font1"> though by the king’s favour he&nbsp;was “ grand commander ” of the mUitary order of Santiago&nbsp;in Castile. He was credited ’ with having shown moderation&nbsp;at Milan, but it is certain that he came into sharp colffsion&nbsp;with the archbishop, Saint Charles Borromeo, who took up&nbsp;the cause of his flock. His docihty rather than his capacity&nbsp;marked him out to succeed Alva. The king wished to&nbsp;pursue a more conciliatory poUcy, without, however, yielding&nbsp;any one of the points in dispute between himself and the&nbsp;revolted Netherlanders. Requesens came to Brussels on the&nbsp;17th of November 1573, and till his death on the 5th of March&nbsp;1576 was plunged into insuperable difficulties. With an empty&nbsp;treasury and unpaid mutinous troops, no faculty could have&nbsp;helped Requesens to succeed; and he was only an honest&nbsp;official who was worn out in trying to do the impossible.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">REQUEST, LETTERS OF. The legal terms “ letters rogatory,” or “ of request ” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(commission rogatoire),</span><span class="font1"> express a&nbsp;request made by one judge for the assistance of another in&nbsp;serving a citation, taking the deposition of a witness, executing&nbsp;a judgment, or the performance of any other judicial act. The&nbsp;later law of Rome imposed a duty of mutual assistance on the&nbsp;courts of the Empire, and this was extended to the courts of&nbsp;different states when, and so far as, Roman law came to rule&nbsp;the modern world. Consequently, outside ecclesiastical law&nbsp;(see below), the only trace of such a practice to be found in&nbsp;England or the United States, independent of statutory enactment, is in the admiralty doctrine that the sentence of a foreign&nbsp;court of admiralty may be executed on letters of request from&nbsp;the foreign judge or on a Ubel by a party for its execution. See&nbsp;the authorities collected by Sir R. Phillimore in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The City of&nbsp;Mecca,</span><span class="font1"> 5 P.D. 28. The need of assistance in taking the depositions of witnesses outside their jurisdiction was long in being&nbsp;felt by the British and United States courts, because they&nbsp;issued commissions for that purpose to private persons, sometimes to foreign judges in their private capacities.
