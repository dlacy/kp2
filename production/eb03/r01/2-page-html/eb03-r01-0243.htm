<p><span class="font0">Some writers are of opinion, that the rhinoceros is the unicorn of holy writ and of the ancients, and that&nbsp;the oryx or Indian aſs of Ariſtotie, who ſays it has but&nbsp;one horn, was the ſame, his informers comparing the&nbsp;clutnſy ſhape of the rhinoceros to that of the aſs.—&nbsp;It was alſo the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">bos unicornis</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">fera monoceros</span><span class="font0"> of&nbsp;Pliny, both of which were of India and in his account&nbsp;of the monoceros he exactly deſcribes the great black&nbsp;horn and hog-like tail. The unicorn of Scripture is&nbsp;confidered as having all the properties of the rhinoceros,&nbsp;as rage, untameableneſs, great ſwiftneſs, and vaſt ſtrength.&nbsp;This opinion is moſt ably ſupported by Mr Bruce.&nbsp;&quot; The derivation of the Hebrew word </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">reem</span><span class="font0"> (ſays he),&nbsp;which in our verſion is tranſlated </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">unicorn,</span><span class="font0"> both in the&nbsp;Hebrew and the Ethiopic, ſeems to be from ereôfnefs,&nbsp;or handing ſtraight. This is certainly no particular&nbsp;quality in the animal itſelf, who is not more or even ſo&nbsp;much erect as many other quadrupeds, ſor in its knees&nbsp;it is rather crooked; but it is from the circumſtance and&nbsp;manner in which itshorn is placed. The horns of all other&nbsp;animals are inclined to ſome degree of paralleliſm with&nbsp;his noſe or os frontis. '1 he horn of the rhinoceros is&nbsp;erect and perpendicular to this bone, on which it ſtands&nbsp;at right angles, thereby poſſeſſing a greater purchaſe&nbsp;or power, as a lever, than an horn could poffibly have in&nbsp;any other poſition. The ſituation of the horn is very&nbsp;happily alluded to in Scripture ; ‘ My horn ſhalt thou&nbsp;exalt like the horn of an unicorn.’ And the horn here&nbsp;alluded to is not wholly figurative, but was really an ornament worn by great men in the days of victory, preferment, or rejoicing, when they were anointed with&nbsp;new, ſweet, or freſh oil ; a circumſtance which David&nbsp;joins with that of erecting the horn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">&quot; Some authors, for what reaſon I know not, have made the reem, or unicorn, to be of the deer or antelope kind ; that is, of a genus whoſe very character is&nbsp;fear and weaknefs, directly oppoſite to the qualities by&nbsp;which the reem is deſcribed in Scripture : beſides, it is&nbsp;plain that the reem is not of the claſs of clean quadru-peds ; and a late modern traveller very wllimſically takes&nbsp;him for the leviathan, which certainly was a ſiſh. Balaam, a prieſt of Midian, and ſo in the neighbourhood&nbsp;of the haunts of the rhinoceros, and intimately connected with Ethiopia, (for they themſelves were ſhepherds of&nbsp;that country), in a tranſport, from contemplating the&nbsp;ſtrength of Iſrael, whom he was brought to curſe, ſays,&nbsp;they had, as it were, the ſtrength oſ the reem. Job&nbsp;makes frequent alluſion </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font0">his great ſtrength, ferocity,&nbsp;and indocility. He aſks, 'Will the reem be willing&nbsp;to ſerve thee, or abide by thy crib ?’ that is, Will lie&nbsp;willingly come into thy ſtable, and eat at thy manger ?&nbsp;And again, ‘ Canſt thou bind the reem witli a band in the&nbsp;furrow ; and will lie harrow tlie valleys ſor thee ?’—&nbsp;In other words, Canſt thou make him go to the plough&nbsp;or harrows?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">&quot; The rhinoceros, in Geez, is called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">A rave Harich, </span><span class="font0">and in the Amharic </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Auraris ;</span><span class="font0"> both which names ſigniſy&nbsp;‘ the large wild beaſt with the horn.’ This would ſeem&nbsp;as if applied to the ſpecies witli one horn. On the other&nbsp;hand, in the conntry of the Shangalla and in Nubia he&nbsp;is called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Girnamgim,</span><span class="font0"> or ‘ horn upon horn;’ and this would&nbsp;ſeem to denote that he had two. The Ethiopic text&nbsp;renders the word </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">reem,</span><span class="font0"> ‘ Arwe-Harich and this the&nbsp;Septuagint tianſſates </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">monoceros,</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">unicorn.</span><span class="font0"> The principal reaſon of tranſiating the word </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">unicorn</span><span class="font0"> rather than&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rhinoceros,</span><span class="font0"> is from ?. prejudice that he muſt have had but&nbsp;one horn. But this is by no means ſo well founded as&nbsp;to be admitted the only argument for eſtabliſhing </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">tlie&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">exiſtence of an animal, which never has appeared after&nbsp;the ſearch of ſo many ages. Scripture ſpeaks of tlie&nbsp;horns of tlie unicorn ; fo that even from this circumſtance&nbsp;tlie reem may be the rhinoceros, as tlie Aſiatic, and part&nbsp;of tlie African rhinoceros, may be the unicorn.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Tlie rhinoceros bicornis was long known in Europe merely by the double horns wliich were preferved in va-rious cabinets ; and its exiſtence, though now paſt all&nbsp;doubt, has been frequently queſtioned. Dr Sparman,&nbsp;in his voyage to the Cape of Good Hope, killed two&nbsp;of theſe animals, wliicli he diffected, and very minutely&nbsp;deſcribes. The horns, lie ſays, in the live animal are&nbsp;ſo mobile and looie, that wlien it walks careleſsly along,&nbsp;one may ſee tliem waggle about, and hear them claſh and&nbsp;clatter againſt each other. In tlie Phil. Tranſ. ſor 1793,&nbsp;we have a deſcription of tlie double-horned rhinoceros&nbsp;of Sumatra, by Mr Bell, ſurgeon in the ſervice of the&nbsp;Eaſt India Company at Bencoolen ; and this account,&nbsp;though it differs conſiderably from that of Sparman in&nbsp;ſome particulars, we ſhall infert here. “ The animal (ſays·&nbsp;Mr Bell) herein defcribed was ſhot with a leaden ball·&nbsp;from a muſket about ten miles from Fort Marlborough.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">I ſaw it the day after ; it was then not in the leaſt pu-trid, and I put it into the poſition from which the accompanying drawing was made. (See Plate ccccxxxvm.) It was a male ; the height at the ſhoulder was 4 feet 4&nbsp;inches ; at the ſacrum nearly the ſame ; from the tip of&nbsp;the noſe to the end of the tail eight feet five inches.—&nbsp;From the appearance of its teeth and bones it was but&nbsp;young, and probably not near its full ſize. The ſhape&nbsp;of the animal was much like that of the hog. The ge-neral colour was a browniſh aſh ; under the belly, be-tween the legs and folds of the ſkin, a dirty ſſeſh co-lour. The head much reſembled that of the Angle horned rhinoceros ; the eyes were ſmall, of a brown colour j&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">membrana nictitans</span><span class="font0"> thick and ſtrong : the ſkin fur-rounding the eyes was wrinkled ; the noſtrils were wide;,&nbsp;the upper lip was pointed, and hanging over the under.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">&quot; There were fix </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">molares,</span><span class="font0"> or grinders, on each ſide of the upper and lower jaw, becoming gradually larger&nbsp;backward, particularly in the upper ; two teeth in the&nbsp;front of each jaw ; the tongue was quite ſmooth ; the&nbsp;ears were ſmall and pointed, lined and edged with ſhort&nbsp;black hair, and ſituated like thoſe of the ſingle-horned&nbsp;rhinoceros. The horns were black, the larger was&nbsp;placed immediately above the noſe, pointing upwards,,&nbsp;and was bent a little back; it was about nine inches-long. The ſmall horn was four inches long, of a pyra-midal ſhape, flattened a little, and placed above the eyes,&nbsp;rather a little more forward, ſtanding in a line with the&nbsp;larger-horn, immediately above it. They were both&nbsp;firmly attached to the ſkull, nor was there any appear-ance of joint or muſcles to move them @@(C). The neck&nbsp;was thick and ſhort, the ſkin on the under ſide thrown in</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">@@@(C) Mr Bruce, however, ſays, that in the living animal the horns are extremely ſenſible.
