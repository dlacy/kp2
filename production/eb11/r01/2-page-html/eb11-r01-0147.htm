<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chemical Relations.—</span><span class="font1">The rare earth metals were at first regarded as divalent, but determinations of the specific heats&nbsp;of cerium by Mendeléeff and Hillebrand and of lanthanum and&nbsp;didymium by Hillebrand pointed to their trivalency; and this&nbsp;view now has general acceptance. They are comparatively&nbsp;reactive: they burn in air to form oxides of the type Me<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>;&nbsp;combine directly with hydrogen at 200<sup>o</sup>-300° to form hydrides&nbsp;of the formula MH<sub>2</sub> or MH<sub>3</sub>; nitrides of the formula MN are&nbsp;formed by passing nitrogen over the oxides mixed with magnesium; whilst carbides of the type MC<sub>2</sub> are obtained in the&nbsp;electrolytic reduction of the oxides with carbon. In addition&nbsp;to the oxides M2O3, several, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font1"> cerium, terbium and neodymium,&nbsp;form oxides of the formula MO2. The sesquioxides are bases&nbsp;which form salts and increase in basicity in the order Sc, Yb,&nbsp;Tm, Er, Ho, Tb, Gd, Sm, Y, Ce, Nd, Pr, La; the latter hissing&nbsp;with water like quicklime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The placing of these elements in the periodic table has attracted much attention on account of the many difficulties which it&nbsp;presented. The simplest plan of regarding them all as trivalent&nbsp;and placing them in the third group is met by the fact that there&nbsp;is not room for them. Another scheme scatters them in the&nbsp;order of their atomic weights in the last four groups of the&nbsp;system, but grave objections have been urged against this plan.&nbsp;A third device places them in one group as a bridge between&nbsp;barium and tantalum. This was suggested by Benedick in&nbsp;1904 (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Zeit. anorg. Chem.,</span><span class="font1"> 1904, 39, p. 41), and adopted in Werner’s&nbsp;table of 1905 (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ber.</span><span class="font1"> 38, p. 914), whilst in 1902 Brauner (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ibid.</span><span class="font1"> 32,&nbsp;p. 18) placed the group as a bridge on a plane perpendicular to&nbsp;the planes containing the other elements, thus expanding the&nbsp;table into a three-dimensional figure. The question has also&nbsp;been considered by Sir William Crookes (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Jour. Chem. Soc.,</span><span class="font1"> 1888,&nbsp;53, p. 487; 1889, 55, pp. 257 et seq.), whose inquiries led him to&nbsp;a new conception of the chemical elements.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RASHBAM (1085-1174), Jewish scholar, so called from the initials of his full name, Rabbi Samuel ben Meir, was a leading&nbsp;member of the French school of Biblical exegesis. He was a&nbsp;grandson of Rashi (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">q.υ.),</span><span class="font1"> but differed in his method of interpretation. He wrote commentaries on the Pentateuch and&nbsp;some other parts of the Scriptures. Rashbam adopts a natural&nbsp;(as distinct from a homiletical and traditional) method; thus&nbsp;(in agreement with the modern school) Rashbam (on Gen. i. 5)&nbsp;maintained that the day began at dawn and not from the&nbsp;previous sunset (as later Jewish custom assumed). Another&nbsp;famous interpretation was Rashbam's view that the much&nbsp;disputed phrase in Gen. xlix. 10 must be rendered “ Until he&nbsp;cometh to Shiloh,” and refers to the division of the kingdom&nbsp;of Judah after Solomon’s death. Rashbam’s notes on the&nbsp;Bible are remarkable for brevity, but when he comments on&nbsp;the Talmud—he wrote explanations on several tracts—he is&nbsp;equally noted for prolixity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(I. A.)</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font1">RASHI (1040-1105), Jewish scholar. Rabbi Solomon Iziiaqi (son of Isaac), usually cited as Rashi from the initials&nbsp;of those words, was born at Troyes in 1040 and died in the&nbsp;same town in 1105. Legends concerning him are many. Isaac’s&nbsp;wife, shortly before the birth of their famous son, was walking&nbsp;one day down a narrow street in Worms, when two vehicles&nbsp;moving in opposite directions seemed about to crush her.&nbsp;As she leant hopelessly against a wall, it miraculously fell inwards to make a niche for her. So with his education. Legend&nbsp;sends the student to southern France, and even on a tour&nbsp;of the world. At an inn in the Orient he cured a sick monk,&nbsp;who later on, as bishop of Olmütz, returned the kindness by&nbsp;saving the Jews from massacre. In fact, Rashi never went&nbsp;farther than from the Seine to the Rhine; the utmost limit&nbsp;of his travels were the academies of Lorraine. Situated between&nbsp;France and Germany, Lorraine was more French than German,&nbsp;and French was the common language of Jew and Christian.&nbsp;This is shown by the glosses in Rashi’s works, almost invariably&nbsp;in French. He seems to have passed the decade beginning&nbsp;with 1055 in Worms, where the niche referred to above is&nbsp;still shown. Within this, it is said, Rashi was wont to teach.&nbsp;A small edifice on the east of the synagogue is called the&nbsp;“ Rashi Chapel,” and the “ Rashi Chair,” raised on three&nbsp;steps in the niche, is one of the objects of the pious admiration&nbsp;of pilgrims. At Worms Rashi worked under Jacob ben Yaqar,&nbsp;and at Mainz under Isaac ben Judah, perhaps combining at&nbsp;the same time the functions of teacher and student. Besides&nbsp;the oral tuition that he received, the medieval schools habitu-ally kept the notes of former teachers. From these Rashi&nbsp;learned much, and probably he incorporated some of these&nbsp;notes in his own works. In the middle ages there was a communism in learning, but if Rashi used some of the stones quarried&nbsp;and drafted by others, it was to his genius that the finished&nbsp;edifice was due.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rashi was twenty-five years of age when he returned to Troyes, which town thenceforward eclipsed the cities of&nbsp;Lorraine and became the recognized centre of Jewish learning.&nbsp;Rashi acted as rabbi and judge, but received no salary. Not&nbsp;till the 14th century were Jewish rabbis paid officials. Rashi&nbsp;and his family worked in the vines of Troyes (in the Cham-pagne); in his letters he describes the structure of the wine-presses. His learning and character raised him to a position&nbsp;of high respect among the Jewries of Europe, though Spain&nbsp;and the East were long outside the range of his influence.&nbsp;As was said of him soon after his death: “ His lips were the&nbsp;seat of wisdom, and thanks to him the Law, which he examined&nbsp;and interpreted, has come to life again.” His posterity included several famous names, those of his grandchildren.&nbsp;Rashi had no sons, but his three daughters were women of&nbsp;culture, and two of the sons of Jochebed (see Rashbam and Tam),&nbsp;as well as others of his descendants, carried on the family&nbsp;tradition for learning, adding lustre to Rashi’s fame. The latter&nbsp;part of Rashi’s life was saddened by the incidents connected&nbsp;with the first Crusade. Massacres occurred in the Rhinelands. According to legend, Rashi and Godfrey of Bouillon—&nbsp;of the foremost leaders of the Crusade—were intimate friends.&nbsp;Rashi died peacefully in Troyes in 1105.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rashi was the most conspicuous medieval representative of the Jewish spirit. A century later Maimonides was to&nbsp;give a new turn to Jewish thought, by the assimilation of&nbsp;Aristotelianism with Mosaism, but Rashi was a traditionalist&nbsp;pure and simple. He was in no sense a philosopher, but he&nbsp;exemplified in his person and in his works the stored up wisdom&nbsp;of the Synagogue. Yet through all that he wrote there runs&nbsp;a vein of originality. Besides minor works, such as a recension&nbsp;of the Prayer-Book (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Siddur</span><span class="font1">) the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pardes</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ha-Orah,</span><span class="font1"> Rashi&nbsp;wrote two great commentaries on which his fame securely&nbsp;rests. These were the commentaries on the whole of the&nbsp;Hebrew Bible and on about thirty treatises of the Talmud.&nbsp;His commentary on the Pentateuch, in particular, has been&nbsp;printed in hundreds of editions; it is still to Jews the most&nbsp;beloved of all commentaries on the Mosaic books.
