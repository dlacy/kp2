<p><label>ROAD</label>
in <hi rend="italic">Navigation,</hi> a bay or place of anchorage, at some distance from the shore, whither vessels occasionally repair to receive intelligence, orders, or necessary supplies, or to wait for a fair wind. The excellence of a road consists chiefly in its being protected from the reigning winds and the swell of the sea, in having a good anchoring ground, and being at a competent distance from the shore. Those which are not sufficiently protected are termed <hi rend="italic">open roads.</hi></p>
