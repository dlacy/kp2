<p><span class="font0">by the beginning of the 14th century, but possesses no charter distinct from the Cinque Ports. As a member of the Cinque&nbsp;Ports, which were summoned from 1322 onwards, Rye returned&nbsp;two representatives to parliament from 1366 until 1832; after&nbsp;that date one only until 1885. In 1290 the barons of the royal&nbsp;port of Rye were granted a three days’ fair in September, altered&nbsp;in 1305 to March. The mayor and commonalty evidently held&nbsp;weekly markets on Wednesday and Friday before 1405, as in&nbsp;that year the Friday market was changed to Saturday. Shipbuilding has been carried on since the 13th century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RYE. This cereal, known botanically as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Secale cereale,</span><span class="font0"> is supposed to be the cultivated form of 5. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">montanum,</span><span class="font0"> a wild&nbsp;perennial species occurring in the more elevated districts of&nbsp;parts of the Mediterranean region, and W. to Central Asia.&nbsp;Its cultivation docs not appear to have been practised at a&nbsp;very early date,&nbsp;relatively speaking.&nbsp;Alphonse dc Candolle, who has collected the evidence&nbsp;on this point, draws&nbsp;attention to the&nbsp;fact that no traces&nbsp;of this cereal have&nbsp;hitherto been found&nbsp;in Egyptian monuments, or in the&nbsp;earlier Swiss dwellings, though seeds&nbsp;have been found&nbsp;in association with&nbsp;weapons of the&nbsp;Bronze period at&nbsp;Olmutz. The absence of any special&nbsp;name for it in the&nbsp;Semitic,Chinese and&nbsp;Sanskrit languages&nbsp;is also adduced as&nbsp;an indication of its&nbsp;comparatively recent culture. On&nbsp;the other hand, the&nbsp;general occurrence&nbsp;of the name in the&nbsp;more modern languages of N.&nbsp;Europe, under&nbsp;various modifications, points to the&nbsp;cultivation of the plant then, as now, in those regions. The&nbsp;origin of the Latin name </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">secale,</span><span class="font0"> which exists in a modified&nbsp;form among the Basques and Bretons, is not explained.&nbsp;Rye is a tall-growing annual grass, with fibrous roots, flat,&nbsp;narrow, ribbon-like bluish-green leaves, and erect or decurvecl&nbsp;cylindrical slender spikes like those of barley. The spikelets&nbsp;contain two or three flowers, of which the uppermost is&nbsp;usually imperfect. The outer glumes are acute and glabrous,&nbsp;the flowering glumes lance-shaped, with a comb-like keel&nbsp;at the back, and the outer or lower one prolonged at the&nbsp;apex into a very long bristly awn. Within these are three&nbsp;stamens surrounding a compressed ovary, with two feathery&nbsp;stigmas. When ripe, the grain is of an elongated oval form,&nbsp;with a few hairs at the summit. When the ovaries of the plant&nbsp;become affected with a peculiar fungus </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Claviceps purpurea)</span><span class="font0"> they</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">become blackened and distorted, constituting ergot (#.t&gt;.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the S. of Great Britain rye is chiefly or solely cultivated as a forage-plant for cattle and horses, being usually sown in&nbsp;autumn for spring use, after the crop of roots, turnips, &amp;c., is&nbsp;exhausted, and before the clover and lucerne are ready. For&nbsp;forage purposes it is best to cut early, before the leaves and&nbsp;haulms have been exhausted of their supplies to benefit the&nbsp;grain. In the N. of Europe, and more especially in Scandinavia,&nbsp;Russia and parts of N. Germany, rye is the principal cereal;&nbsp;and in nutritive value, as measured by the amount of gluten it&nbsp;contains, it stands next to wheat, a fact which furnishes the explanation of its culture in N. latitudes ill-suited for the growth of&nbsp;wheat. Rye bread or black bread is in general use in N. Europe.&nbsp;The straw, which is prized on account of its length, is used for&nbsp;making hats and in the manufacture of paper. The bran is used&nbsp;for cattle-food and poultices, and the grain in the distillery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RYEZHITSA, a town of Russia, in the government of Vitebsk, 150 m. N.W. from the<sup>r</sup>town of Vitebsk and on the&nbsp;railway between St Petersburg and Warsaw. Its population&nbsp;increased from 7306 in 1867 to 10,681 in 1897 ; but its importance is mainly historical. The cathedral is a modern&nbsp;building (1846). Ryezhitsa, or, as it is called in the Livonian&nbsp;chronicles, Roziten, was founded in 1285 by the Teutonic&nbsp;Knights to keep in subjection the Lithuanians and Letts. The&nbsp;castle was continually the object of hostile attacks. In 1561&nbsp;the Teutonic Knights gave it in pawn to Poland, and, though it&nbsp;was captured by the Russians in 1567 and 1577, and had its&nbsp;fortifications dismantled by the Swedes during the war of&nbsp;1656-60, it continued Polish till 1773, when White Russia was&nbsp;united with the Russian empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RYLAND, WILLIAM WYNNE (1738-1783), English engraver, was born in London in July 1738, the son of an engraver&nbsp;and copper-plate printer. He studied under Ravenet, and in&nbsp;Paris under Boucher and J. P. le Bas. After spending five&nbsp;years on the continent he returned to England, and having&nbsp;engraved portraits of George III. and Lord Bute after Ramsay,&nbsp;and a portrait of Queen Charlotte and the Princess Royal after&nbsp;Francis Cotes, R.A., he was appointed engraver to the king.&nbsp;In 1766 he became a member of the Incorporated Society of&nbsp;Artists, and he exhibited with them and in the Royal Academy.&nbsp;In his later life Ryland abandoned line-engraving, and introduced “ chalk-engraving,” in which the line is composed of&nbsp;stippled dots, and in which he transcribed Mortimer’s “ King&nbsp;John Signing Magna Charta,” and copied the drawings of the old&nbsp;masters and the works of Angelica Kauffman. In consequence&nbsp;of his extravagant habits his affairs became involved; he was&nbsp;convicted of forging bills upon the East India Company, and;&nbsp;after attempting to commit suicide, was executed at Tyburn&nbsp;on the 29th of August 1783.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RYLANDS, JOHN (1801-1888), English manufacturer and merchant, was born at St Helens, Lancashire, on the 7th of February 1801, and was educated at the grammar school in that town. In&nbsp;1819 he, his elder brothers and his father, a manufacturer of&nbsp;cotton goods, founded the firm of Rylands &amp; Sons, cotton goods&nbsp;and linen manufacturers, at Wigan. The business rapidly&nbsp;increased, dye-works and bleach-works were added, and the&nbsp;discovery of coal under some of the firm's property added materially to its wealth. In 1825 the partners became merchants as&nbsp;well as manufacturers, and subsequently acquired spinning mills&nbsp;at Bolton and elsewhere. In 1847, his father being dead and&nbsp;his brothers having retired, John Rylands assumed entire&nbsp;control of the business, which in 1873 was turned into a limited&nbsp;liability company. It has mills at Manchester, Bolton, and&nbsp;Wigan, and is now probably the largest concern of the kind in&nbsp;Great Britain. John Rylands was a benefactor to various&nbsp;charities, and was one of the original financiers of the Manchester Ship Canal. He died at Stretford on the nth of&nbsp;December 1888. A permanent memorial, the John Rylands&nbsp;Library, was erected by his widow in Manchester in 1899.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RYLE, JOHN CHARLES (1816-1900), English bishop, was born at Macclesfield on the 10th of May 1816, and was educated at Eton&nbsp;and at Christ Church, Oxford, where he was Craven Scholar in&nbsp;1836. After holding a curacy at Exbury in Hampshire, he&nbsp;became rector of St Thomas’s, Winchester (1843), rector of&nbsp;Helmingham, Suffolk (1844), vicar of Stradbroke (1861), honorary&nbsp;canon of Norwich (1872), and dean of Salisbury (1880); but before&nbsp;taking this office was advanced to the new see of Liverpool,&nbsp;where he remained until his resignation, which took place three&nbsp;months before his death at Lowestoft on the 10th of June 1900.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
