<p><span class="font1">contest against the Roman arms, as well as in their final subjugation, extended down the northern slope of the Alps&nbsp;as far as the Danube. By far the greater part of this&nbsp;extensive region was occupied by rugged mountains, the&nbsp;inhabitants of which, when compelled to abandon their&nbsp;predatory habits, subsisted principally upon the produce&nbsp;of their flocks. Some of the valleys, however, which&nbsp;extended on the south side down to the plains of Italy,&nbsp;were rich and fertile, and produced excellent wine, which&nbsp;was considered equal to any of those grown in Italy itself.&nbsp;The most important of these valleys λvas that of the Adige,&nbsp;which descends from the high Alps adjoining the Brenner&nbsp;to Verona ; of this the upper portions were held by the&nbsp;Breuni, whose name is still perpetuated in that of the&nbsp;Brenner, while the lower and more fertile region was&nbsp;occupied by the Tridentini, whose chief town of Tridentum&nbsp;was the same as the now celebrated city of Trent. The&nbsp;next people towards the west were the Triumpilini, in the&nbsp;valley still known as Val Trompia ; the Camuni in Val&nbsp;Camonica; the Orobii, who appear to have occupied the Val&nbsp;Tellina and adjoining districts ; and the Lepontii, between&nbsp;the Lago Maggiore and the Pennine Alps. The tribes in&nbsp;the interior and heart of the mountain ranges cannot be for&nbsp;the most part assigned to definite localities. The Genauni,&nbsp;mentioned by Horace as well as by Strabo, are supposed&nbsp;to have occupied the Val di Non, and the Vennones or&nbsp;Venostes the lofty ranges near the source of the Adige.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The boundaries of the Roman province were repeatedly changed. At first it appears to have comprised all Vinde-licia, so as to have extended to the Danube from its&nbsp;sources to its confluence with the Inn, which constituted its&nbsp;eastern boundary on the side of Noricum. But at a later&nbsp;period this northern tract was separated from the central&nbsp;mountain region, and the two were named Rhætia Prima and&nbsp;Rhætia Secunda, in which form they appear in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Notitia.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">At the same time the southern valleys were gradually&nbsp;incorporated with Italy and assigned to the territory of the&nbsp;neighbouring municipal towns. Thus Tridentum, which&nbsp;was originally a Rhætian town, came to be included in&nbsp;Venetia, and is ass.igned by Pliny to the tenth region of&nbsp;Italy. The only important town in the northern part of the&nbsp;province was the Roman colony of Augusta Vindelicorum,&nbsp;which still retains the name of Augsburg. The same is&nbsp;the case with Curia, now Chur or Coire, the capital of the&nbsp;Grisons, and Brigantia (Bregenz), which gave name in ancient&nbsp;times to the lake now called the Lake of Constance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The province of Rhætia was traversed by two great lines of Roman roads,—the one leading from Verona and&nbsp;Tridentum (Trent) across the pass of the Brenner to Innsbruck (Pons Œni), and thence to Augsburg (Augusta Vindelicorum), and the other from Bregenz on the Lake of&nbsp;Constance, by Coire and Chiavenna, to Como and Milan.</span></p>

The resemblance of&nbsp;the Rhea to the Ostrich (vol. xviii. p. 62) was at once&nbsp;perceived, but the differences between them were scarcely&nbsp;less soon noticed, for some of them are very evident. The&nbsp;former, for instance, has three instead of two toes on each&nbsp;foot, it has no apparent tail nor the showy wing-plumes of&nbsp;the latter, and its head and neck are clothed with feathers,&nbsp;while internal distinctions of still deeper significance&nbsp;have since been dwelt upon by Prof. Huxley </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Proc.
