<p><span class="font0">fortabîe repaſt. Both ſexes are remarkably healthy and robuſt, and accuſtom themſelves to ſleep every day&nbsp;after dinner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Ruffian women are remarkably fair, comely, ſtrong, and well-ſhaped, obedient to their lordly huſ-bands, and patient under diſcipline : they are even ſaid&nbsp;to be fond of correction, which they conſider as an infallible mark of their huſhand’s conjugal affection ; and&nbsp;they pout and pine iſ it be with-held, as if they thought&nbsp;themſelves treated with contempt and diſregard. Of&nbsp;this neglect, however, they have very little cauſe to&nbsp;complain ; the Ruffian huſhand being very well diſpoſed, by nature and inebriation, to exert his arbitrary&nbsp;power. Some writers obſerve, that, on the wedding-day, the bride preſents the bridegroom with a whip of&nbsp;her own making, in token of ſubmiſſion ; and this he&nbsp;fails not to employ as the inſtrument of his authority.&nbsp;Very little ceremony is here uſed in match-making,&nbsp;which is the work of the parents. Perhaps the bridegroom never ſees the woman till he is joined to her for&nbsp;life. The marriage being propoſed and agreed to, the&nbsp;lady is examined, ſtark· naked, by a certain number of&nbsp;her female relations ; and if they find any bodily defect,&nbsp;they endeavour to cure it by their own ſkill and experience. '1 he bride, on her wedding-day, is crowned&nbsp;with a garland of wormwood, implying the bitterneſs&nbsp;that often attends the married ſtate. When the prieſt has&nbsp;tied the nuptial knot at the altar, his clerk or ſexton&nbsp;throws upon her head a handful of hops, wiſhing that ſhe&nbsp;may prove as fruitful as the plant thus ſeattered. She is&nbsp;muffled up, and led home by a certain number of old&nbsp;women, the pariſh-prieſt carrying the croſs before; while&nbsp;one of his ſubalterns, in a rough goat-ſkin, prays all the&nbsp;way that ſhe may bear as many children as there are&nbsp;hairs on his garment. The new-married couple, being&nbsp;ſeated at table, are preſented with bread and ſalt ; and&nbsp;a chorus of boys and girls ling the epithalamium, which&nbsp;is always groſsly obſcene. This ceremony being performed, the bride and bridegroom are conducted to&nbsp;their own chamber by an old woman, who exhorts the&nbsp;wife to obey her huſhand, and retires. 1 hen the&nbsp;bridegroom deſires the lady to pull off one of his bu-ikins, giving her to underſtand, that in one of them&nbsp;is contained a whip, and in the other a jewel or a&nbsp;purſe of money. She takes her choice ; and if ſhe&nbsp;finds the purſe, interprets it into a good omen ; whereas ſhould ſhe light on the whip, ſhe conſtrues it into&nbsp;an unhappy preſage, and inſtantly receives a laſh as a&nbsp;ſpecimen of what ſhe has to expect. After they have&nbsp;remained two hours together, they are interrupted by&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">a </span><span class="font0">deputation of old women, who come to ſearch for&nbsp;the ſigns of her virginity : if theſe are apparent, the&nbsp;young lady ties up her hair, which before conſumma-tion hung looſe over her ſhoulders, and viſits her mother, of whom ſhe demands the marriage portion. It&nbsp;is generally agreed, that the Muſcovite huſhands are&nbsp;barbarous even to a proverb ; they not only adminiſter&nbsp;frequent and ſevere correction to their wives, but ſometimes even torture them to death, without being ſubject to any puniſhment for the murder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The canon law of Muſcovy forbids the conjugal commerce on Mondays, Wedneſdays, and Fridays ; and&nbsp;whoever tranſgreſſes this law, muſt bathe himſelf before&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">he </span><span class="font0">enters thc church-porch. He that marries a ſecond&nbsp;wife, the firſt being alive, is not admitted farther than&nbsp;the church-door ; and if any man eſpouſes a third, he&nbsp;is excommunicated : ſo that though bigamy is tolerated, they nevertheleſs count it infamous, iſ a woman&nbsp;is barren, the huſhand generally perſuades her to retire&nbsp;into a convent : if fair means wfill not ſucceed, he is at&nbsp;liberty to whip her into condeſcenſion. When the&nbsp;czar, or emperor, has an inclination for a wife, the&nbsp;moſt beautiful maidens of the empire are preſented to&nbsp;him for his choice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The education of the czarovitz, or prince royal, </span><span class="font1">is </span><span class="font0">intruſted to the care of a few perſons, by whom he is&nbsp;ſtrictly kept from the eyes of the vulgar, until he hath&nbsp;attained the 15th year of his age : then he is publicly&nbsp;expoſed in the market-place, that the people, by viewing him attentively, ⅛nay remember his perſon, in order&nbsp;to aſcertain his identity ; for they have more than once&nbsp;been deceived by impoſtors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Such is the ſlavery in which the Muſcovites oſboth ſexes are kept by their parents, their patrons, and the&nbsp;emperor, that they are not allowed to diſpute any&nbsp;match that may be provided for them by theſe directors, however diſagreeable or odious it may be. Officers of the greateſt rank in the army, both natives&nbsp;and foreigners, have been ſaddled with wives by the&nbsp;ſovereign in this arbitrary manner. A great general&nbsp;ſome time ago deceaſed, who was a native oſ Britain,&nbsp;having been preſſed by the late czarina to v/ed one of&nbsp;her ladies, ſaved himſelf from a very diſagreeable marriage, by pretending his conſtitution was ſo unſound,&nbsp;that the lady would be irreparably injured by his compliance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In Ruſſia, the authority of parents over their children is almoſt as great as it was among the ancient Romans, and is often excrciſed with equal ſeverity. Should a father, in puniſhing his ſon for a fault, be the immediate cauſe of his death, he could not be called to account'&nbsp;for his conduct ; he would have done nothing but what&nbsp;the law authorized himto do. Nor does this legal tyranny&nbsp;ceaſe with the minority of children ; it continues while&nbsp;they remain in their father’s family, and is often exerted in the moſt indecent manner. It is not uncommon,&nbsp;even in St Peterſhurgh, to ſee a lady of the higheſt&nbsp;rank, and in all the pomp and pride of youthful beauty, ſtanding in the court-yard with her back bare, expoſed to the whip of her father’s ſervants. And ſo&nbsp;little diſgrace is attached to this puniſhment, that the&nbsp;ſame lady will fit down at table with her father and his&nbsp;gutſts immediately after ſhe has ſuſſered her flogging,&nbsp;provided its ſeverity has not confined her to bed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Muſcovites are fond of the bagpipe, and have a kind of violin, with a large belly like that of a lute :&nbsp;but their muſic is very barbarous and defective. Nevertheleſs, there are public ſchools, in which the children are regularly taught to fing. The very beggars&nbsp;aſk alms in a whining cadence, and ridiculous fort of&nbsp;recitative. A Ruffian ambaſſador at the Hague, having been regaled with the beſt concert of vocal and&nbsp;inſtrumental muſic that could be procured, was aſked&nbsp;how he liked the entertainment ? he replied, “ Perfectly well : the beggars in my country ſing juſt in. the fame&nbsp;manner.” The warlike muſic of the Ruſſians conſiſt!&nbsp;in kettle-drums and trumpets : they likewiſe uſe hunt&nbsp;ing horns ; </span><span class="font1">but </span><span class="font0">they </span><span class="font1">are not at all expert </span><span class="font0">in the per</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
