Thus came y' bookes of <hi rend="italic">Amadis</hi>  into light among us in this last age. But to say y<hi rend="sup">,</hi>  truth,<hi rend="italic">Spaine</hi>  bred the, and <hi rend="italic">France</hi>  new clothed the in gay garments. In y* daies of <hi rend="italic">Henrie the Second</hi>  did they beare the chiefest sway, and I think if any man weuld then have reproved the, he should have been spit at because they were of themselves playfellowes and maintainers to a great sort of persons ; whereof some, after they had learned to amize in speech, their teeth watered, so desirous were they even to taste of some small morsels of the delicacies therein most livelie and naturally represented.”@@<hi rend="sup">1</hi>  The gallant Maréchal proceeds at considerable length to refute the arguments of those who contended that these books were intended as a spur to the practice of arms and honourable exercises amongst youth, and labours hard to shew that they teach dishonest practices both in love and in arms. It is impossible to suppress a smile when we find such an author as La Noue denouncing the introduction of spells, witchcrafts, and enchantments into these volumes, not because such themes are absurd and nonsensical, but because the representing such beneficent enchanters as Alquife and Urganda is, in fact, a vindication of those who traffic with the powers of darkness ; and that those who love to read about sorceries and enchantments become, by degrees, familiarized with those devilish mysteries, and may at length be induced to have recourse to them in good earnest.</p><p>The romances of chivalry did not, however, sink into disrepute under the stem rebuke of religious puritans or severe moralists, but became gradually neglected, as the customs of chivalry itself fell into disregard ; when, of course, the books which breathed its spirit, and were written under its influence, ceased to produce any impression on the public mind, and, superseded by better models of composition, and overwhelmed with the ridicule of Cervantes, sunk by degrees into utter contempt and oblivion.</p><p>Other works of amusement, of the same general class, succeeded the proper romance of chivalry. Of these we shall take some notice hereafter, since we must here close our general view of the history of romance, and proceed briefly to give some account of those peculiar to the various European nations.</p><p>II. We can here but briefly touch upon a subject of great interest and curiosity, namely, the peculiar character and tone which the romance of chivalry received from the manners and early history of the nations amongst whom it is found to exist ; and the corresponding question, in what degree each appears to have borrowed from other countries the themes of their own minstrels, or to have made use of materials common to the whole.</p><p>Scandinavia, as was to be expected, may be safely considered as the richest country in Europe, in ancient tales corresponding witll the character of romance ; sometimes composed entirely in poetry or rhythm, sometimes in prose, and much more frequently in a mixture of prose, narrative, and lyrical effusions. Their well-known Skaldls or bards held a high rank in their courts and councils. The character of a good poet was scarcely second to that of a gallant leader, and many of the most celebrated champions ambitiously endeavoured to unite both in their own persons. Their earlier sagas or tales approach to the credit of real history, and were unquestionably meant as such, though, as usual at an early period, debased by the intermixture of those <hi rend="italic">speciosa miracula</hi>  which the love of the wonderful early introduces into the annals of an infant country. There are, however, very many of the sagas, indeed by far the greater number of those now known to exist, which must be considered as falling rather under the class of fictitious than of real narratives ; and which, therefore, belong to our present subject of inquiry. The <hi rend="italic">Omeyinger Saga,</hi>  the <hi rend="italic">Heimskriηgla,</hi>  the <hi rend="italic">Saga</hi>  of Olaf Triggvason, the <hi rend="italic">Eyrbyg-gia Saga,</hi>  and several others, may be considered as historical ; whilst the numerous narratives referring to the history of the Nibelungen and Volsungen are as imaginary as the romances which treat of King Arthur ànd of Charlemagne. These singular compositions, short, abrupt, and concise in expression, full of bold and even extravagant metaphor, exhibiting many passages of forceful and rapid description, hold a character of their own ; and whilst they remind us of the indomitable courage and patient endurance of the hardy Scandinavians, at once the honour and the terror of Europe, rise far above the tedious and creeping style which characterised the minstrel efforts of their successors, whether in France or England. In the pine forests also, and the frozen mountains of the north, there were nursed, amid the reliques of expiring paganism, many traditions of a character more wild and terrible than the fables of classical superstition ; and these the gloomy imagination of the skalds tailed not to transfer to their romantic tales. The late spirit of inquiry which has been so widely spread through Germany, has already begun to throw much light on this neglected storehouse of romantic lore, which is worthy of much more attention than has yet been bestowed upon it in Britain. It must, however, be remarked, that although the north possesses champions and romances of its own, unknown to southern song, yet, in a later age, the inhabitants of these countries borrowed from the French minstrels some of their most popular subjects ; and hence we find sagas on the subject of Sir Tristrem, Sir Percival, Sir Ywain, and others, the well-known themes of French and English romance. These, however, must necessarily be considered later in date, as well as far inferior in interest, to the sagas of genuine northern birth. Mr. Ritson has indeed quoted their existence as depreciating the pretensions of the northern nations to the possession of poems of high antiquity of their own native growth. Had he been acquainted with the <hi rend="italic">Norman-Kiempe-Datur,</hi>  a large folio, printed at Stockholm in 1737, he would have been satisfied, that out of the numerous collection of legends respecting the achievements of Gothic champions, far the greater part are of genuine Norse origin ; and although having many features in common with the romances of southern chivalry, are, in other marked particulars, distinctly divided from that class of fictitious composition.</p><p>The country of Germany, lying contiguous to France, and constantly engaged in friendly and hostile intercourse with that great seat of romantic fiction, became, of course, an early partaker in the stores which it afforded. The Minnesingers of the Holy Empire were a race no less cherished than the Troubadours of Provence, or the Minstrels of Normandy ; and no less active in availing themselves of their indigenous traditions, or importing those of other countries, in order to add to their stock of romantic fiction. Gotfrit of Strasburg composed many thousand lines upon the popular subject of Sir Tristrem ; and others have been equally copious, both as translators and as original authors, upon various subjects connected with French romance ; but Germany possessed materials, partly borrowed from Scandinavia, partly peculiar to her own traditional history, as well as to that of the Roman empire, which they applied to the construction of a cycle of heroes as famous</p><p>@@@<hi rend="italic"><hi rend="sup">1</hi>  The Politicke and Militarie Discourses</hi>  of the Lord De La Nowe, pp. 87, 88. 4to.
