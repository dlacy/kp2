This method of drawing lines will alfo prevent any error that might ariſe irom an expanſion or contraction of the metal during the time of dividing,</p><p>. " The ſcrew-frame is fixed on the top of a conical pillar, wlιich turns freely round its axis, and alſo moves freely towards or from the centre of the wheel, ſo that the ſcrew-frame may be entirely guided^ by the frame which connects it with the centre : by this means ∙ any exceπtricity of the wheel and the arbor would not produce any error in the dividing ; and, by a particular contrivance (which will be deſcribed hereafter), the fcrew when preſſed againſt the teeth of the wheel always moves parallel to itfelf ; ſo that a line joining the centre of the arbor and the tracer continued, will always make equal angles with the ſcrew.</p><p>" Figure I. repreſents a perſpective view of the en-gine.</p><p>“ Fig. 2. is a plan, of which ſig. 3. repreſents a ſec-tion on the line <hi rend="sup">ΠΛ</hi>»</p><p>" The large wheel A is 45 inches in diameter, and has ten radii, each being ſupported by edge-bars, as repreſented in fig. 3· Fheſe bars and radii are con-nected by the circular ring B, 24 inches in diameter and 3 deep ; and, for greater ſtrength, the whole is caſt in one piecc in bell-metal.</p><p>“ As the whole weight of the wheel A reſts on its ring B, the edge-bars are deepeſt where they join it ; and from thence their depth diminiſhes, both towards the centre and the circumference, as repreſented in fig. 3.</p><p>“ The ſurface of the wheel A was worked very even and flat, and its circumference turned true. The ring C, of fine braſs, was fitted very exactly on the circumference of the wheel ; and vvas faſtened thereon with ſcrews, which, after being ſcrewed as tight as poffible, were well rivetted. The face of a large chuck being turned very true and fiat in the lath, the flattened ſurface A of the wheel was faſtened agaſhſt it with hold-faſts ; and the two ſurfaces and circumference of the ring C, a hole through the centre and the plane part round (b) it, and the lower edge of the ring B, were turned at the ſame time.</p><p>“ D is a piece of hard bell-metal, having the hole, which receives the ſteel-arbor (d), made very ſtraight and true. This bell-metal was turned very true on an arbor ; and the face, which reſts on the wheel at (b), was turned very flat, ſo that the ſteel arbor (d} might ſtand perpendicular to the plane of the wheel : this bell-metal was faſtened to the wheel by ſix ſteel ſcrews (1).</p><p>" A braſs ſocket Z is faſtened on the centre of the mahogany ſtand, and receives the lower part of the bell-metal piece D, being made to touch the bell-metal in a narrow part near the mouth, to prevent any obliquity of the wheel from bending the arbor : good fitting is by no means neceſſary. here ; ſince any ſtiake in this ſocket will produce no bad effect, as will appear hereafter when we deſcribe the cutting frame.</p><p>“ The wheel was then put on its ſtand, the lower edge of the ring B reſting on the circumference of three conical friction-pulleys W, to facilitate its motion round its centre. The axis of one of theſe pulleys is in a line joining the centre of the wheel and the middle of the endlefs ſcrew, and the other two placed ſo as to be at equal diſtances from each other.</p><p>" F is a block of wood ſtrongly faſtened to one of the legs of the ſtand; the piece (g) is ſcrewed to the upper ſide of the block, and has half holes, in which the tranſverſe axis (h) turns : the half holes are kept toge-ther by the ſcrews (i).</p><p>" The lower extremity of the conical pillar P termi-nates in a cylindrical ſteel·pin (k), which paſſes through and turns in the tranſverſe axis (h), and is confined by a cheek and ſcrew.</p><p>" To the upper end of the conical pillar is faſtened the frame G, in which the endlefs ſcrew turns : the pivots of the ſcrew are formed in the manner of two fruſtums of cones joined by a cylinder, as repreſented at X. Thefe pivots are confined between half poles, which preſs only on the conical parts, and do not touch the cylindric parts ί the half holes are kept together by ſcrews (a), which may be tightened at any time, to prevent the ſcrew from ſhaking in the frame.</p><p>“ Οη the fcrew-arbor is a ſmall wheel of braſs K, having its outſide edge divided into 60 parts, and numbered at every 6th diviſion with 1, 2, &amp;c. to 10. I he motion of this wheel is ſhown by the index (y) on the ſcrew-frame G.</p><p>" H repreſents a part of the ſtand, having a parallel flit in the direction towards the centre of the wheel, large enough to receive the upper part of the conical braſs pillar P, which carries the ſcrew and its frame : and as the reſiſtance, when the wheel is moved by the endleſs ſcrew, is againſt that ſide of the flit H which is towards the left hand, that ſide of the flit is faced with braſs, and the pillar is preſſed againſt it by a ſteel fpring on the oppoſite ſide <hi rend="italic">i</hi>  by this means the pillar is ſtrongly ſupported laterally, and yet the ſcrew may be eaſily preffed from or againſt the circumference of the wheel, and the pillar will turn freely on its axis to take any direction given it by the frame L.</p><p>“ At each corner of the piece I are ſcrews (n) of tempered ſteel, having poliſhed conical points : two of them turn in conical holes in the ſcrew-frame near (o), and the points of the oth¢r two fcrews turn in holes in the piece Qj the ſcrews (p) are of ſteel, which being tightened, prevent the conical pointed ſcrews from unturning when the frame is moved.</p><p>“ L is a braſs frame, which ſerves to connect the end-leſs ſcrew, its frame, &amp;c. with the centre of the wheel : each arm of this frame is terminated by a ſteel ſcrew, that may be paſſed through any of the holes (q) in the piece Q, as the thicknefs of work to be divided on the wheel may require, and are faſtened by the finger-nuts (r).</p><p>" At the other end of this frame is a flat piece of tempered ſteel (b), wherein is an angular notch : when the endleſs ſcrew is preſſed againſt the teeth on the circumference of the wheel, which may be done by turning the ſinger-ſcrew S, to preſs againſt the ſpring (t),</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
