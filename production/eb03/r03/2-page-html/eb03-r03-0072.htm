<p><span class="font0">RUBBER </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(India}.</span><span class="font0"> See Caoutchouc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RUBENS (Sir Peter Raul), the moſt eminent of the Flemiſh painters, was born in 15 77 ; but whether&nbsp;at Antwerp or Cologne it is not eaſy to determine.&nbsp;His father, who was a counſellor in the ſenate of Antwerp, had been forced by the civil wars to ſeek refuge&nbsp;in Cologne, and during his reſidence there Rubens is&nbsp;commonly ſaid to have been born.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The genius of Rubens, wlſtch began to unfold itſelf in his earlieſt years, was cultivated with peculiar care,&nbsp;and embelliſhed with every branch of claſſical and polite&nbsp;literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">He ſoon diſcovered a ſtrong inclination for deſigning; and uſed to amuſe himſelf with that employment in his&nbsp;leiſure hours, while the reſt of his time was devoted to&nbsp;other ſtudies. His mother, perceiving the bias of her&nbsp;ſon, permitted him to attend the inſtructions of Tobias·&nbsp;Verhaecht a painter of architecture and landſcape. He&nbsp;next became the pupil of Adam Van Oort, but lie ſoon&nbsp;found that the abilities of this maſter were inſuſſicient&nbsp;to anſwer his elevated ideas. His ſurly temper too was</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">diſguſtful </span><span class="font0">to Rubens, whoſe natural diſpoſition was mo</span><span class="font1">del! and amiable. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Anxious to find </span><span class="font1">an </span><span class="font0">artiſt whoſe genius and diſpofi. tſens were congenial with his own, he became the di-ſeiple of Octavio Van Veen, generally known by the&nbsp;name of Otho Venius, a painter of ſingular merit, and&nbsp;who was not only ſldlled in the principles of his art,&nbsp;but alſo diſtinguiſhed for learning and other accompliſh-ments. Between the maſter and ſeholar a remarkable&nbsp;ſimilarſty appeared in temper and inclination ; indeed,&nbsp;iιι the whole turn of their »finds. It was this congeniality of ſentiments which animated Rubens with that&nbsp;ardent paſſion for the art of painting which at length&nbsp;determined him to purſue it as a proſeſſion. From this&nbsp;time he gave up his whole mind to it ; and ſo ſucceſsful&nbsp;were his exertions, that he ſoon equalled his maſter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In order to arrive at that perfection which he already beheld in idea, it became requifite to ſtudy the productions of the moſt eminent artiſts. For this purpoſe he&nbsp;travelled through Italy, viſiting the moſt valuable collections of paintings and antique ſtatues with which that&nbsp;country abounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Sandrart, who was intimately acquainted with Rubens, informs us, that he was recommended in the moſt honourable manner to the duke of Mantua by the archduke Albert, who had witneſſed his talents in the finiſh-ing of ſome fine paintings deſigned for his own palace.&nbsp;At Mantua he was received by the duke with the moſt&nbsp;flattering marks of diſtinction, and had'opportunities of&nbsp;improving himſelf which he did not neglect. Here he&nbsp;carefully ſtudied the works of Julio Romano. He next&nbsp;viſited Rome, where he had an opportunity of examining the productions of Raphael. The paintings of&nbsp;Titian and Paolo Veroneſe called him to Venice, where&nbsp;he accompliſhed himſelf in the art of colouring.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">He continued in Italy ſeven years. At length receiving intelligence that his mother was taken ill, he haſtened to Antwerp ∙. but hi's filial affection was not&nbsp;gratified with a light of her; ſhe died before his arrival.&nbsp;He married ſoon after ; but his wife dying at the end'&nbsp;of four years, he retired from Antwerp for ſome time,,&nbsp;and endeavoured to ſoothe his melancholy by a journey&nbsp;to Holland. At Utrecht he viſited Hurtort, for whom&nbsp;he had a great value.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;»</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The tame of Rubens was now ſpread over Europe. He was invited by Mary of Medicis queen of. Henry&nbsp;IV. of France to Râris, where he painted the galleries&nbsp;in the palace of Luxemburg. Theſe form a ſeries of'&nbsp;paintings which delineate the hiſtory of Mary ; and af-foι d a convincing proof how well qualified he was to&nbsp;excel in allegorical and emblematical compo tions.&nbsp;While at Paris he became acquainted with the duke of&nbsp;Buckingham, who was-ſo taken with his great talents&nbsp;and accompliſhments, that he judged him well qualified&nbsp;to explain to Iſabella, the wife oſ Albeit the archduke,&nbsp;the cauſe of the nriſunderſtanding which had taken&nbsp;place between the courts of England and Spain. In&nbsp;this employment Rubens, acquitted himſelf with ſuch&nbsp;propriety, that Iſabella appointed him envoy' to the&nbsp;king oſ Spain, with a commiſſion to propoſe terms of&nbsp;peace, and to bring back the inſtructions of that monarch. Philip was no leſs captivated with Rubens;&nbsp;He conferred on him the honour of knighthood, and&nbsp;made him ſecretary to his privy council.
