in <hi rend="italic">Theology,</hi> persons who hold that God, without any regard to the good or evil works of men. has resolved, by an eternal decree, <hi rend="italic">supra lapsum,</hi> antecedently to any knowledge of the fall of Adam, and independently of it, to save some and to condemn others; or, in other words, that God intended to glorify his justice in the condemnation of some, as well as his mercy in the salvation of others; and for that purpose decreed that Adam should necessarily fall, and by that fall bring himself and all his offspring into a state of everlasting condemnation. These are also called <hi rend="italic">antelapsaries,</hi> and are opposed to sublapsaries and infralapsaries. According to the supra- lapsarians, the object of predestination is, <hi rend="italic">homo creabilis et labilis ;</hi> and, according to the sublapsarians and infralapsa- rians, <hi rend="italic">homo creatus el lapsus.</hi></p></div></body></text></TEI>
