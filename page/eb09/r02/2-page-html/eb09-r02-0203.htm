                    style="font-style:italic;">Arthurian Cycle.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font2">The oldest and certainly the most important of the cycles of
                    mediæval romance is that which passes under&nbsp;the name of King Arthur, or of
                    the Round Table. The&nbsp;names, characters, and actions of its heroes have
                    permeated&nbsp;modern literature throughout Europe ; yet so little do
                    we&nbsp;know concerning the </span><span class="font2"
                    style="font-style:italic;">origines</span><span class="font2"> and the first
                    authors of the&nbsp;tales which form the body of Arthurian romance
                    that&nbsp;there are few subjects in literary history more obscure
                    and&nbsp;undefined. It can only be said with assurance that from&nbsp;about the
                    year 1150 several poems@@<sup>1</sup> were composed by&nbsp;minstrels (a class
                    of men recruited from all ranks of&nbsp;society) upon incidents and personages
                    familiar to readers&nbsp;of what is called the </span><span class="font2"
                    style="font-style:italic;">Morte Arthur,</span><span class="font2"> a
                    compilation of the&nbsp;second half of the 13th century. The </span><span
                    class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Morte Arthur</span><span class="font2">
                    was&nbsp;not originally so called, and it was not a direct compilation&nbsp;from
                    the ballads of the 12th century, but seems rather to&nbsp;have been a mere
                    unskilful reduction into a single </span><span class="font2"
                    style="font-style:italic;">corpus&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">of some five
                    or six prose romances which had already&nbsp;grown out of the poems, and each of
                    which professed to&nbsp;relate the adventures of nearly the same set of
                    heroes.&nbsp;The first appearance of these stories in prose compositions&nbsp;is
                    here our chief concern ; and it is, unfortunately, likewise&nbsp;our chief
                    difficulty. The sources of information upon the&nbsp;subject are defective and
                    vitiated to a singular degree;&nbsp;and the light thrown by the investigations
                    of recent&nbsp;writers is frequently of the nature of cross-lights.
                    The&nbsp;following attempt at constructing a brief literary history&nbsp;of the
                    Arthurian romances is not offered as a complete&nbsp;analysis of the work which
                    has been done, but as a summary of facts and probabilities.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font2">The Roman conquests in Spain, Gaul, and Britain imposed upon a
                    large portion of the conquered peoples the necessity of using the Latin
                    language, which thereby became, and for centuries remained, the medium of
                    educated&nbsp;intercourse and the language of the towns and the centres&nbsp;of
                    government in those countries. In common speech,&nbsp;naturally, it became
                    depraved in course of time, and the&nbsp;pure </span><span class="font2"
                    style="font-style:italic;">lingua Latina</span><span class="font2"> of the high
                    officials and the clergy&nbsp;existed side by side with the corrupt </span><span
                    class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">lingua Romana</span><span class="font2"
                    > of&nbsp;the Romanized people. The latter was, however, ignored&nbsp;by polite
                    literature, and probably never appeared in a&nbsp;written form till it was used
                    for political purposes on the&nbsp;occasion of the celebrated partition of
                    Charlemagne’s empire&nbsp;among his grandsons. We may say that the
                    literature&nbsp;of romance begins with popular poetry of the 10th or&nbsp;11th
                    century; but, as its subject-matter was derived to&nbsp;some extent from the
                    more respectable </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">lingua
                    Latina,</span><span class="font2"> we&nbsp;must go back a few centuries earlier
                    to find the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"
                    >origines.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">When the people of Rome became
                    acquainted with the&nbsp;civilization and literature of Greece they framed a
                    fabu-lous history to connect themselves with the superior
            race,</span></p></div><br clear="all" /><div>
            <p><span class="font2">and the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"
                    >Æneid</span><span class="font2"> exhibits that pseudo-tradition in its most
                    permanent and powerful embodiment. A similar desire&nbsp;affected the Romanized
                    Britons, and we may confidently&nbsp;assume that before the end of the 3d
                    century a poetical&nbsp;form had been given to the story of the Trojan
                    Brutus&nbsp;who founded the kingdom of Britain, blended with something of the
                    real traditions of the Celtic race. No such&nbsp;form survives at present, but
                    we may discern its traces and&nbsp;results in Nennius (sec. viii.-x.), Geoffrey
                    of Monmouth&nbsp;(d. 1154), and in all the subsequent chronicles.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font2">In the 11th century the Anglo-Saxons of England had their old
                    Germanic stories of Beowulf, Sigfrid, and the&nbsp;Nibelungen ; the Britons of
                    the west enjoyed their Celtic&nbsp;and Britanno-Celtic myths ; the Saxonized
                    Britons of Wiltshire and elsewhere combined the legends of both the&nbsp;others;
                    and the best educated men amongst the clergy&nbsp;had an acquaintance with
                    Virgil, Ovid, and Statius. Here&nbsp;was a rich material for the imagination,
                    and the invasion of&nbsp;the Normans brought a fructifying element. In
                    France,&nbsp;Roman, Franco-German, Celto-Breton, and
                    Scandinavian&nbsp;traditions were already intermingled ; and the reintroduction
                    into Saxonized England, from the south, of Celtic&nbsp;myths nearly identical
                    with those which the Anglo-Normans&nbsp;found in Wales before the end of the
                    11th century gave&nbsp;to the latter a fresh life and a distinct predominance
                    over&nbsp;all the other traditions of the composite people. Hence&nbsp;arose the
                    British cycle of romance, accepted partly as&nbsp;history, partly as fiction by
                    the new people of Norman&nbsp;England. Bretons, Britons, Normans and French,
                    the&nbsp;Saxonized Britons, the Franco-Gallicized Scandinavians,&nbsp;and the
                    Dano-Saxons all found a common basis of amalga-mation, and it is no mere
                    metaphor to say that the publi-cation of Geoffrey of Monmouth’s fabulous
                    chronicle formed&nbsp;a momentous era in the history of England.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font2">When the Saxons entered Britain in the 5th century they found in
                    the middle and the south a Romanized&nbsp;kingdom ruled by a monarch with a
                    British or Cymric&nbsp;name. The vernacular tongue of Britain was then
                    and&nbsp;for centuries afterwards much nearer in form to the Gaelic&nbsp;of
                    Ireland and of western and northern Scotland, the Pictish&nbsp;of Scotland, and
                    the Gaulish of France than the Cymric&nbsp;of Wales is now or was then. It was a
                    long time before&nbsp;the Saxon conquests extended so far as to leave the
                    Cymry&nbsp;or Welsh the sole distinct people of the original inhabitants&nbsp;of
                    the country. In the meantime there had been conflicts with the Pictish kings of
                    the north, the Gaelic or&nbsp;Cambro-Gaelic kings of Strathclyde, and the
                    princes of&nbsp;North and South Wales. Amongst their opposers the&nbsp;most
                    successful and the most memorable was a prince or&nbsp;chief of Strathclyde, who
                    is called by Nennius “Arthur&nbsp;dux bellorum,” by the English “ King Arthur,”
                    by the&nbsp;Welsh “ the Emperor Arthur.” After the departure of&nbsp;the Romans
                    there were several independent monarchies or&nbsp;principalities in the
                    island—that of the Romanized Britons&nbsp;occupying the centre, south, and
                    south-east of the country;&nbsp;two Cymric principalities in Wales (North and
                    South) ;&nbsp;the Cambro-Gaelic kingdom of Strathclyde, extending&nbsp;from the
                    Clyde to Chester ; the unmixed Gaels in the&nbsp;north-west of Scotland ; the
                    Pictish kingdom in the northeast ; and a Scandinavian population between the
                    Firth&nbsp;of Forth and Norwich. It is now settled by scholars&nbsp;that the
                    Pictish speech was a dialect, like Gallic, Gaelic,&nbsp;and Cymric, of the
                    common Celtic language ; and in the&nbsp;early centuries of the Christian era
                    the radical unity of&nbsp;all these tongues had not yet been effaced by the
                    action&nbsp;of local varieties of pronunciation and arbitrary rules
                    of&nbsp;orthography; consequently there was no such sentiment of&nbsp;national
                    or racial distinction between the divisions of the&nbsp;Celtic race as is
                    nowadays produced by political frontiers.&nbsp;The real Arthur, whoever he was,
