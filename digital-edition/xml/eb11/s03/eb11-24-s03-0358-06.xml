                        rend="italic">c.</hi> 1488), the most able engraver and painter of the early
                    German school. His father was a goldsmith named Casper, a native of Augsburg,
                    who had settled at Colmar, where the chief part of Martin’s life was spent.<note

                        Schongauer’s birth is usually given wrongly as <hi rend="italic">c.</hi>
                        1420; he was really born twenty-five or thirty years later, and is mentioned
                        by A. Dürer as being a young apprentice in 1470. His portrait in the Munich
                        Pinakothek is now known to be a copy by Burgkmair, painted after 1510, from
                        an original of 1483—not 1453 as has been supposed. The date (1499) for
                        Schongauer’s death, written on the back of the panel by Burgkmair, is
                        obviously a blunder; see Hensler in <hi rend="italic">Naumann's Archiv</hi>
                        (1867), p. 129, and Wurzbach, <hi rend="italic">M. Schongauer</hi> (Vienna,
                        1880). These contradict the view of Goutzwiller, in his <hi rend="italic"
                            >Martin Schongauer et son école</hi> (Paris, 1875). Cf. Schnaasc, “
                        Gesch. M. Schongauers,” in the <hi rend="italic">Mittheil. der K. K.
                            Commission</hi> (1863), No. 7. </note> Schongauer established at Colmar
                    a very important school of engraving, out of which grew the “ little masters” of
                    the succeeding generation, and a large group of Nuremberg artists. As a painter,
                    Schongauer was a pupil of the Flemish Roger van der Weyden the Elder, and his
                    rare existing pictures closely resemble, both in splendour of colour and
                    ex-quisite minuteness of execution, the best works of contemporary art in
                    Flanders. Among the very few paintings which can with certainty be attributed to
                    him, the chief is a magnificent altar-piece in the church of St Martin at
                    Colmar. The Colmar Museum</p>

                <p>possesses eleven panels by him, and a small panel of “ David with Goliath’s Head”
                    in the Munich Gallery is attributed to him. The miniature painting of the “
                    Death of the Virgin ” in the English National Gallery is probably the work of
                    some pupil.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="2"> Another
                        painting of the same subject in the Doria Palace in Rome (usually attributed
                        to Dürer) is given to Schongauer by Crowe and Cavalcaselle, <hi
                            rend="italic">Flemish Painters</hi> (London, 1872), p. 359; but the
                        execution is not equal to Schongauer’s wonderful touch. </note> In 1488
                    Schongauer died at Colmar, according to the register of St Martin’s church.
                    Other authorities state that his death occurred in 1491.</p>
                <p>The main work of Schongauer’s life was the production of a large number of
                    beautiful engravings, which were largely sold, not only in Germany, but also in
                    Italy and even in England. Vasari savs that Michelangelo copied one of his
                    engravings—the "Trial of St Anthony."<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial" n="3"> An interesting example of Schongauer’s popularity in
                        Italy is given by the lovely Faenza plate in the British Museum, on which is
                        painted a copy of Martin’s beautiful engraving of the “ Death of the
                        Virgin.” </note> Schongauer was known in Italy by the names “ Bel Martino ”
                    and “ Martino d’Anversa.” His subjects are always religious; more than 130
                    prints from copper by his hand are known, and about 100 more are the production
                    of his <hi rend="italic">bottega.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial" n="4"> See Bartsch, <hi rend="italic">Peintre Graveur,</hi>
                        and Willshire, <hi rend="italic">Ancient Prints,</hi> best edition of 1877.
                        According to a German tradition Schongauer was the inventor of printing from
                        metal plates; he certainly was one of the first who brought the art to
                        perfection. See an interesting article by Sidney Colvin in the <hi
                            rend="italic">Jahrbuch der k. preussischen Kunstsammlung,</hi> vi. p. 69
                        (Berlin, 1885). </note>
                    <hi rend="italic"/>Most of his pupils’ plates as well as his own are signed M+S.
                    Among the most beautiful of Schongauer’s engravings are the series of
                    the“Passion”and the “Death and Coronation of the Virgin,” and the series of the
                    “Wise and Foolish Virgins.” All are remarkable for their miniature-like
                    treatment, their brilliant touch, and their chromatic force. Some, such as the “
                    Death of the Virgin ” and the “ Adoration of the Magi ” are richly-filled
                    compositions of many figures, treated with much largeness of style in spite of
                    their minute scale.</p>
                <p>The British Museum possesses a fine collection of Schongauer’s prints. Fine
                    facsimiles of his engravings have been produced by Armand-Durand with text by
                    Duplessis (Paris, 1881).</p>
