Practically, the power of the diet rests in the nobility and clergy. But the most important branch of the constitution is the council of state, which consists of one minister for justice, one for foreign affairs, other six councillors, and the chancellor of the court, and is attended by the four secretaries of state, who have the four departments of home affairs; military and naval affairs ; finances, trade, customs, and post-office ; and affairs of the church, general education, and the poor. The king can do nothing, except in military and diplomatic affairs, without consulting this council, which must keep a protocol of its proceedings, in which each member has a right to explain his opinions.</p><p>Relatively to its means, Sweden is much more heavily taxed than either England or France, and yet the public revenues raised by taxation do not amount to L.2,000,000 sterling. According to the report of 1832, the sum was 20,247,339 dollars banca, or L. 1,687,278 sterling, of which more than one half was raised by a direct land-tax, the remainder by customs and other indirect means.</p><p>Since the beginning of the present century, the agriculture of Sweden has experienced great improvement. The Swedes have become exporters of grain to a considerable extent ; and as seven ninths of the population are engaged in the cultivation of the soil, a large proportion of which is still unproductive from want of cultivation, the quantity might be very greatly increased. The whole annual produce of the soil is estimated at forty-five millions of dollars. Within a few years land has risen considerably in value ; and this is owing to the exertions of the agricultural societies established in the provinces, and the great interest which the landed proprietors now take in the management and improvement of their estates. The cultivation of the potato has indeed been the mainspring in the improvement of Swedish agriculture. Not only has it precluded the necessity of using the bark of trees as a miserable substitute for bread, but has occasioned the public and private magazines to be completely filled with grain ; and the greatest difficulty with which cultivators have at present to contend, is the want of a market for their surplus stock.</p><p>Both horses and horned cattle are small in Sweden. The former, however, are active and spirited, the latter afford excellent milk and beef. The sheep are generally of an inferior kind ; but great pains have been taken to improve them by crosses with the Spanish, French, and English breeds. Towards the sixty-third degree, sheep disappear, and are superseded by goats, which are most numerous in the woodland districts of Dalarne and Nordland. The seedtime is in May, the harvest in August, and as the fine weather is short and warm, the labours of the farmer are then very constant and fatiguing, while a great number of people are required to reap the crops, for whom there is no employment during winter, when the country is all covered with snow. This will ever remain an obstacle to agricultural improvement, especially in the northern districts. The average of the harvests throughout the kingdom for seven years has been found to be three good, three middling, and one a failure. The average rate of fecundity is four and three seventh grains for one.</p><p>Both the sea and the fresh waters swarm with fish, which afford employment and subsistence to many of the inhabitants. The fresh waters contain perch, pike, salmon, trout, grayling, char, roach, bleak, and eels ; but of all these the salmon is the most important object of industry and trade. They are more abundant in the northern rivers than in those of the south, and fisheries are established on most of them. The sea-fish are not less numerous or important. Herrings are sometimes caught in incredible numbers at Gottenburg, though at other times they entirely forsake the coast.</p><p>Next to agriculture, the mines of Sweden arc the chief source of her wealth. Throughout the kingdom, iron exists in great abundance. The mountain Gellivara, in Lapmark, 1800 feet high, is one mass of the richest iron ore ; but its situation beyond the polar circle (in lat. 67Â° 20' N.), far from the sea, and in an unpeopled wilderness, deprives it of its value. In various other places, however, there are similar hills, and even islands of compact iron ore are to be found near the coast. About the year 1683, the quantity of iron forged in Sweden in one year amounted to 9690 tons, but in the course of the next century a great increase took place. Between the years 1759-60, the average annual produce amounted to 328,766 Swedish pounds, and has continued very nearly the same to the present time, though it is represented as being now in a state of great activity and prosperity. The quantity of bar-iron produced in the year ending 1st November 1839 is stated at 276,000 skip pounds, and of manufactured iron 33,600, which, added to 11,600 of the latter, and 126,700 of the former, on hand at 1st November 1838, made a total of 448,000 skip pounds. Of this amount, 304,896 were exported, 283,500 in the shape of bar, and 21,390 manufactured; the prices during the year having been ten bank rix-dollars, or L.1. 5s. 10d. sterling the skip pound, which is equal to 280 pounds, or a quarter of a ton avoirdupois. The forests of Sweden occupy more than one half of its surface ; and the abundance of wood thus supplied is of the highest utility in working the mines and smelting the ores. Swedish iron is superior in ductility and malleability to all others ; a superiority which is attributed in part to the use of wood instead of coal or peat in their furnaces. The number of mines in all Sweden is 586 ; and of these no fewer than 361 are close together in the heart of the kingdom, in Nerike, Westmanland, and part of Dalarne. Danemora, the principal iron mine, produces yearly about 4000 tons of metal, which is particularly adapted to the manufacture of steel. Next to iron, copper forms the most important of the mineral riches of Sweden. The principal mine has long been at Fahlun, but the produce scarcely exceeds 1,000,000 pounds. The most important of the other copper-mines are those of Hakanbo in Nerike, Nyakopparberg in Nyko- pingslan, Atvedaberg in Linkopingslan, at Areskuta in Jemtland, and Ryddarshytta and Bastras in Westeraaslan. The whole copper produced in Sweden in 1824 was 814 tons, of the value of L.51,777 sterling. Gold is also found at Fahlun and in some other places ; but the produce is too small to pay the expense. Silver is also produced to the extent of about 3000 marks annually ; but the expense is so great that it is proposed to relinquish the working. Fahlun likewise produces sulphur and vitriol. In Scania, near Helsingfors, there is a small bed of coal ; and cobalt, to the value of about L.12,000 sterling, is also produced in Sweden.</p><p>The manufactures are in a very low state. Every art and trade has its own corporate rights and monopolies, which operate as a complete bar to improvement ; and of the total population only about one-seventieth part is engaged in manufactures and trade of every kind. Coarse linens are the chief manufacture. Machinery for spinning wool and cotton has been introduced, but the experiment is too recent to warrant a decided opinion as to its ultimate success. The other articles of manufacture are such common goods as are required to supply the ordinary wants of the people.</p><p>The general trade of Sweden is in almost as low a state as its manufactures. The principal exports consist of articles of native produce, in their raw or manufactured state. Iron ranks first, then timber, copper, tar, and grain. The principal imports are sugar, coffee, tobacco, salt or smoked fish, salt, leather, hemp, silk, cotton, and wine, chiefly articles of domestic comfort or luxury. Mr Laing states the amount of the mercantile shipping at only 30,439 tons ; but Forsell states it as having been.</p></body></text></TEI>
