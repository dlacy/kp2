Schaw pretended that the duke of Rotheſay had been carried off againſt his will: but the king's anſwer was, “Fye, traitor, thou haſt deceived me; and if I live I ſhall be revenged on thee, and thou ſhalt be rewarded as thou haſt ſerved.” James lay that night in the town of Stirling, where he was joined by all his army; and underſtanding that the rebels were advancing, he formed his line of battle. The earl of Athol his uncle, who was truſted by both parties, propoſed an accommodation; which was accordingly effected, if we are to believe Abercromby and other hiſtorians; but we know not the terms, for none are mentioned on either fide. — James is ſaid to have failed on his part; but had there been any grounds for ſuch a charge againſt him, there can ſcarcely be a doubt but that the rebels would have publiſhed them. That a treaty was entered into is paſt diſpute; and the earl of Athol ſurrendered himſelf as a hoſtage into the hands of the rebels.</p><p>James was ſenſible of the advantage which public clamour gave to his enemies; and he applied to the kings of France and England, and the pope, for their interpoſition. His holineſs named Adrian de Caſtello for his nuncio on that occaſion; and the two kings threatened to raiſe troops for the ſervice of James.— He, by a fatality not uncommon to weak princes, left the ſtrong caſtle of Edinburgh, where he might have been in ſafety till his friends, who had diſperſed themſelves upon the faith of the late negociation, could be reaſſembled; and croſſing the Forth, he made another attempt to be admitted into the caſtle of Stirling; but was diſappointed, and informed that the rebels were at Torwood in the neighbourhood, and ready to give him battle. He was in poſſeſſion of the caſtle of Blackneſs; his admiral, Wood, commanded the Forth; and his loyal ſubjects in the north were upon their march to join him. Hawthornden ſays, that the rebels had made a (bow of diſmiſſing their troops, that they might draw James into the field; and that while he remained at Blackneſs, he was attended by the earls of Montroſe, Glencairn, and the lords Maxwell and Ruthven. To give his northern troops time to join him, he propoſed a negociation; but that was ſoon at an end, upon the rebels peremptorily requiring him to reſign his crown to his ſon, that is, to themſelves.</p><p>The rebels had been inured to war. They conſiſted chiefly of borderers, well armed and diſciplined; in which they had the advantage of the king’s Lowland ſubjects, who had not been accuſtomed to arms. What the numbers on both ſides were does not clearly appear but it is probable that the forces of James were ſuperior to the rebels. They were then at Falkirk; but they ſoon paſſed the Carron, encamped above the bridge near Torwood, and made ſuch diſpositions as rendered a battle unavoidable, unleſs James would have diſperſed his army, and gone on board Wood’s ſhips: but he did not know himſelf, and reſolved on a battle. He was encamped at a ſimall brook named Sauchieburn, near the ſame ſpot of ground where the great Bruce had defeated the Engliſh under Edward the ſecond. The earl of Menteith, the lords</p><p>Erſkine, Graham, Ruthven, and Maxwell, commanded the firſt line of the king's army. The ſecond was commanded by the earl of Glencairn, who was at the head of the Weſtland and Highland men. The earl of Crawford, with the lord Boyd and Lindſay of Byres, commanded the rear, wherein the king’s main ſtrength conliſted, and where he himſelf appeared in perſon, completely armed, and mounted upon the fine horſe which had been preſented to him by Lindſay.</p><p>The firſt line of the royaliſts obliged that of the rebels to give way; but the latter being ſupported by the Annandale men and borderers, the firſt and ſecond line of the king s army were beat back to the third. The little courage James poſſeſſed had forſaken him at the firſt onſet; and he had put ſpurs to his horſe, intending to gain the banks of the Forth, and to go on board one of Wood’s ſhips. In paſſing through the village of Bannockburn, a woman who was filling her pitcher at the brook, frightened at the fight of a man in armour galloping full ſpeed, left it behind her; and the horſe taking fright, the king was thrown to the ground, and carried, bruiſed and maimed, by a miller and his wife, into their hovel. He immediately called for a prieſt to make his confeſſion; and the ruſtics demanding his name and rank, “I was (ſaid he incautiouſly) your king this morning.” The woman, overcome with aſtoniſhment, clapped her hands, and running to the door called for a prieſt to confeſs the king. I am a prieſt (ſaid one paſſing by), lead me to his majeſty.” Being introduced into the hovel, he ſaw the king covered with a coarſe cloth; and kneeling by him, he aſked James whether he thought he could recover, if properly attended by phyſicians? James anſwering in the affirmative, the villain pulled out a dagger, and ſtabbed him to the heart. Such is the dark account we are able to give of this prince’s unhappy end. The name of the perſon who murdered him is ſaid to have been Sir Andrew Borthwick, a prieſt, one of the pope’s knights. Some pretend that the lord Gray, and others that Robert Stirling of Keir, was the regicide; and even Buchanan (the tenor of whoſe hiſtory is a juſtifiation of this murder), is uncertain as to the name of the perſon who gave him the fatal blow.</p><p>It is probable that the royaliſts loſt the battle thro’ the cowardice of James. Even after his flight his troops fought bravely; but they were damped on receiving the certain accounts of his death. The prince, young as he was, had an idea of the unnatural part he was acting, and before the battle he had given a ſtrict charge for the ſafety of his father’s perſon. Upon hearing that he had retired from the field, he ſent orders that none ſhould purſue him; but they were ineffectual, the rebels being ſenſible that they could have no ſafety but in the king’s death. When that was certified, hoſtilities ſeemed to ceaſe; nor were the royaliſts purſued. The number of ſlain on both ſides is uncertain; but it must have been conſiderable, as the earl of Glencairn, the lords Sempil, Erſkine, and Ruthven, and other gentlemen of great eminence, are mentioned. As to the duke of Rotheſay, who was now king, he appeared inconſolable when he heard of his father's death; but the rebels endeavoured to efface his grief, by the profuſion of honours they paid him when he was recognized as king.</p><p>The remorſe and anguiſh of the young king, on re-</p></body></text></TEI>
