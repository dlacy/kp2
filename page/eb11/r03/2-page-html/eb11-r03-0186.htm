<p><span class="font1">ROLAND, LEGEND OF. The legend of the French epic hero Roland (transferred to ItaHan romance as Orlando) is based on&nbsp;authentic history. Charlemagne invaded Spain in 778, and&nbsp;had captured Pampeluna, but failed before Saragossa, when the&nbsp;news of a Saxon revolt recalled him to the banks of the Rhine.&nbsp;On his retreat to France through the defiles of the Pyrenees,&nbsp;part of his army was cut off from the main body by the Basques,&nbsp;who had ambushed in a narrow defile, and now drove the rearguard into a valley where it was surrounded and entirely&nbsp;destroyed. The Basques, after plundering the baggage, made&nbsp;good their escape, favoured by the darkness and by their&nbsp;knowledge of the ground. The incident is related in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Annales&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(Pertz i. 159) commonly ascribed to Einhard, and with more&nbsp;detail in Einhard's </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vita Karoli</span><span class="font1"> (cap. ix.; Pertz ii. 448), where&nbsp;the names of the leaders are given. “ In this battle were slain&nbsp;Eggihard, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">praepositus</span><span class="font1"> of the royal table; Anselm, count of the&nbsp;palace; and Hruodland, praefect of the Breton march. . .&nbsp;The scene of the disaster is fixed by tradition at Roncevaux, on&nbsp;the road from Pampeluna to Saint Jean Pied de Port. There&nbsp;is no foundation in this story for the fiction of the twelve peers,&nbsp;which may possibly arise from a still earlier tradition. In&nbsp;636-37, according to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chronicles</span><span class="font1"> of Fredegarius (ed. Krusch&nbsp;p. 159), twelve chiefs, whose names are given, were sent by&nbsp;Dagobert against the Basques. The expedition was successful,&nbsp;but in an engagement fought in the valley of Subola, or Robola,&nbsp;identified with Mauleon, which is not far from Roncevaux, the&nbsp;Duke Harembert, with other Frankish chiefs, was slain. Later&nbsp;fights in the same neighbourhood and under similar circumstances are related in 813 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{Vita Hludowici,</span><span class="font1"> Pertz ii. 616), and&nbsp;especially in 824 (Einhard's </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Annales',</span><span class="font1"> Pertz i. 213). These&nbsp;incidents no doubt served to strengthen the tradition of the&nbsp;disaster to Charlemagne's rear-guard in 778, the importance&nbsp;of which was perhaps underrated by the Frankish historians&nbsp;and was certainly magnified in popular story. The author of&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vita Hludowici,</span><span class="font1"> writing sixty years after the battle of&nbsp;Roncevaux, thought it superfluous to give the names of the&nbsp;fallen chiefs, as being matter of common report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Growth of the Legend.—</span><span class="font1">The choice of Roland or Hruodland as the hero of the story probably points to the borders of French&nbsp;Brittany as the home of the legend. The exaggeration of a&nbsp;rear-guard action into a national defeat; the substitution of a&nbsp;vast army of Saracens, the enemies of the Frankish nation&nbsp;and the Christian faith, for the border tribe mentioned by&nbsp;Einhard;@@<sup>1</sup> and the vengeance inflicted by Charlemagne, where&nbsp;in fact the enemy escaped with complete impunity—all are in&nbsp;keeping with the general laws of romance. Charlemagne&nbsp;himself appears as the ancient epic monarch, not as the young&nbsp;man he really was in 778. The earliest version of the legend&nbsp;which we possess dates no eariier than the nth century, but&nbsp;there is abundant evidence of the existence of a continuous&nbsp;tradition dating from the original event, although its methods&nbsp;of transmission remain a vexed question. Roncevaux lay on&nbsp;the route to Compostella, and the many pilgrims who must&nbsp;have passed the site from the middle of the 9th century onwards&nbsp;may have helped to spread the story. Whether the actual&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">cantilena Rollandi</span><span class="font1"> chanted by Taillefer at the battle of Hastings&nbsp;(William of Malmesbury, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">De gestis regum angl.</span><span class="font1"> iii. 242, and&nbsp;Wace, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Brut.</span><span class="font1"> ii. </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">ii,</span><span class="font1"> 8035 seq.) was any part of the existing </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chanson&nbsp;de Roland</span><span class="font1"> cannot be stated, but the choice of the legend on this&nbsp;occasion by the trouvère is proof of its popularity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The oldest extant forms of the legend are: </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{a)</span><span class="font1"> chapters xix.-xxx. of the Latin chronicle, known as the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pseudo-Turpin,</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">which purports to be the work of Turpin, archbishop of Reims, who died about 800, but probably dates from the 12th century;&nbsp;(ô) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Carmen de proditione Guenonis, &amp;</span><span class="font1"> poem in Latin distichs;&nbsp;and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(c)</span><span class="font1"> the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chanson de Roland,</span><span class="font1"> a French </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chanson de geste</span><span class="font1"> of&nbsp;about 4000 Hnes, the oldest recension of which is in the Bodleian&nbsp;Library, Oxford (MS. Digby 23). It is in assonanced tirades,&nbsp;of unequal length, many of them terminated with the refrain&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Aoi.</span><span class="font1"> This MS. was written by an Anglo-Norman scribe about&nbsp;the end of the 12th century, and is a corrupt copy of a text by&nbsp;a French trouvère of the middle of the nth century. It concludes with the words: “ Ci falt la geste, que Turoldus declinet.”&nbsp;There was a Turold (d. 1098) who was abbot of Peterborough;&nbsp;another was tutor to William the Conqueror and died in J035.&nbsp;Even if we could identify this personage, we cannot tell whether&nbsp;he was the poet, the minstrel or the scribe of the MS., but it&nbsp;seems likely that he was merely the scribe. The poem, which&nbsp;was first printed by Francisque Michel (Oxford, 1837), is the&nbsp;finest monument of the heroic age of French epic. In its&nbsp;fundamental features it evidently dates back to the reign of&nbsp;Charlemagne, who is not represented as the capricious despot&nbsp;of the later </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chansons de geste,</span><span class="font1"> but as governing in accordance&nbsp;with Frankish custom, accepting the counsel of his barons,&nbsp;and carrying out the curious procedure of Frankish law. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Roland&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">represents the monarchical idea, and was evidently, in its&nbsp;primitive form, written before the feudal revolts which weakened the power of Charlemagne’s successors. Its unity of&nbsp;conception, the severity and conciseness of the language, the&nbsp;directness, vividness and sobriety of the narrative, place it far&nbsp;above the chansons of later trouvères, with their wordiness&nbsp;and their loose, episodic construction. With the exception&nbsp;of the small place allotted to Aide, women have practically no&nbsp;place in the story, and the romantic element is thus absent.&nbsp;Roland's master-passions are daring and an exaggerated conception of honour, the extravagance of which is the cause of&nbsp;the disaster. His address to Oliver before the battle is typical&nbsp;of the warlike spirit of the poem:—</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“ Notre empereur qui ses Francs nous laissa,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Tels vingt mille hommes a pour nous mis à part,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Qu’il sait très bien que pas un n’est couard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Pour son seigneur grands maux on souffrira,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Terribles froids, grands chauds endurera,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Et de son sang, de sa chair on perdra!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Brandis ta lance; et moi, ma Durendal,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Ma bonne épée, que le Roi me donna.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Et si je meurs, peut dire qui Vaura</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">C’était l’épée d’un très noble vassal.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(tr. Petit de Julleville xi. 1114 seq.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Slory as related in the Chanson de Roland.—</span><span class="font1">Charlemagne, after fighting for seven years in Spain, had conquered the whole&nbsp;country with the exception of Saragossa, the seat of the Saracen&nbsp;king Marsile. He was encamped before Cordova when he&nbsp;received envoys from the Saracen king, sent to procure the&nbsp;evacuation of Spain by the Franks through false offers of submission. Charlemagne held a council of his barons, Naimes of&nbsp;Bavaria, Roland, Oliver, Turpin, Ogier, Ganelon and the rest.&nbsp;Roland, the emperor’s nephew, was eager for war; the peace&nbsp;party was headed by Ganelon of Mayence.@@<sup>2</sup> The Franks were&nbsp;weary of campaigning, and Ganelon’s counsels won the day.&nbsp;At the suggestion of Roland, Ganelon, who was his stepfather,&nbsp;was entrusted with the embassy to Marsile—a sufficiently&nbsp;perilous errand, since two former envoys had been beheaded&nbsp;by the Saracens. Ganelon, inspired by hatred of Roland and&nbsp;Oliver, agreed with Marsile to betray Roland and his comrades for ten mule-loads of gold. He then returned to Charlemagne bearing Marsile’s supposed assent to the Frankish terms.&nbsp;The retreat began. Roland, at Ganelon's instigation, was&nbsp;placed in commaffd of the rear-guard. With him were the&nbsp;rest of the famous twelve peers,@@<sup>3</sup> his companions-in-arms,&nbsp;Oliver, Gerin, Gerier, Oton, Berengier, Samson, Anseis, Girard</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@1</sup> It is noteworthy, however, that an Arab historian, Ibn-al-Athîr, states that Charles’s assailants were the Arabs of Saragossa, by&nbsp;whom he had been originally invited to interfere in Spain.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@2</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ganelon may perhaps be identified with Wenilo, archbishop&nbsp;of Sens, whose treason against Charles the Bald is related in the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Annales Bertiniani</span><span class="font1"> (anno 859).</span></p>
