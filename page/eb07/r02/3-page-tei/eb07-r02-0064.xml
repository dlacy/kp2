In this work there are indeed some passages very well handled ; but they are only such as he had taken from the ancient authors, in doing justice to whom he was always very happy. The reader will easily discover in this work the same attachment to religion, the same desire for the public good, and the same love of virtue, which appear in that on the belles lettres. But it is to be lamented that his chronology is neither exact nor consistent ; that he states facts inaccurately ; that he has not sufficiently examined the exaggerations of ancient historians ; that he often interrupts the most solemn narrations with mere trifles ; and that his style is not uniform. Nothing can be more noble and more refined than his reflections ; but they are strewed with too sparing a hand, and want that lively and laconic turn on account of which the historians of antiquity are read with so much pleasure. There is a visible negligence in his diction with regard to grammatical usage, and the choice of his expressions, which he does not at all times select with sufficient taste, although, on the whole, he writes well, and has preserved himself free from many of the faults of modern authors. While the last volumes of his Ancient History were printing, he published the first of his Roman History, which he lived to carry on, through the eighth and into part of the ninth, to the war against the Cimbri, about seventy years before the battle of Actium. Mr Crevier, the worthy disciple of Rollin, continued the history to the battle of Actium, which closes the tenth volume ; and afterwards completed the original plan of Rollin in sixteen volumes l2mo, which was, to bring it down from the foundation of the city to the reign of Constantine the Great. This work had not so great success as his Ancient History. It is alternately diffuse and barren ; and the greatest advantage of the work is, that there are several passages from Livy translated with great elegance into French. He also published a Latin translation of some of the theological writings relative to the disputes of the times in which he lived. Rol-lin was one of the most zealous adherents of the Abbé Paris ; and before the enclosure of the cemetery of St Me-dard, this distinguished character might have been often seen praying at his tomb. This he confesses in his Letters. He published also Smaller Pieces, containing different Letters, Latin harangues, discourses, complimentary addresses, &amp;c. Paris, 1771, two volumes 12mo. The collection is valuable for some good pieces which it contains, for the favourable opinion which it exhibits of solid probity, sound reason, and the zeal of the author for the progress of virtue and the preservation of taste. The Latin of Rollin is very correct, and much after the Ciceronian style, and embellished with most judicious thoughts and agreeable images. Full of the reading of the ancients, from which he brought quotations with as much propriety as plenty, he expressed himself with much spirit. His Latin poems are likewise entitled to commendation.</p><p>This excellent person died in 1741. He had been named by the king a member of the Academy of Inscriptions and Belles Lettres in 1701 ; but as he had not then brought the College of Beauvais into repute, and found he had more business upon his hands than was consistent with a decent attendance upon the functions of an academician, he begged the privileges of a veteran, which where honourably granted him. Nevertheless, he maintained his connections with the academy, attended their assemblies as often as he could, laid the plan of his Ancient History before them, and demanded an academician for his censor. Rollin was a roan of an admirable composition ; very ingenious, consummate in polite learning, of rigid morals, and eminently</p><lb/><p>pious. His religion however carried him into the territories of superstition ; and he wanted nothing but a mixture of philosophy in his nature to make him a very perfect character. Nothing could be more benign, more pacific, more sweet, more moderate, than Rollin’s temper. He showed, it must be owned, some zeal for the cause of Jansenism ; but in all other respects he was exceedingly moderate. The celebrated poet Rousseau conceived such a veneration for him, that he came out of banishment incognito to Paris, on purpose to visit him, and pay his respects to him. He looked upon his histories, not only as the best models of the historic kind, but as a complete system of politics and morals, and a most instructive school, in which princes as well as subjects might learn all their duties.</p><p>ROLLING, the motion by which a ship rocks from side to side like a cradle, by the agitation of the waves.</p><p>ROLLO, the conqueror of Normandy, was a Norwegian duke, banished from his country by Harold IIarfager (who conquered Norway in 870) on account of the piracies he exercised. He first retired with his fleet among the islands of the Hebrides to the north-west of Scotland, whither the flower of the Norwegian nobility had fled for refuge ever since Harold had become master of the whole kingdom. He was there received with open arms by those warriors, who, eager for conquest and revenge, waited only for a chief to undertake some glorious enterprise. Rollo, placing himself at their head, and seeing his power formidable, sailed towards England, which had long been a field open on all sides to the violence of the northern nations. But the great Alfred had some years before established such order in his part of the island, that Rollo, after several fruitless attempts, despaired of forming there such a settlement as should make him amends for the loss of his own country. He pretended, therefore, to have had a supernatural dream, which promised him a glorious fortune in France, and which served at least to support the ardour of his followers. The w eakness of the governmcnt in that kingdom, and the confusion in which it was involved, were still more persuasive reasons to insure them of success. Having therefore sailed up the Seine to Rouen, he immediately took that capital of the province, then called Neustria, and making it his magazine of arms, he advanced to Paris, to which he laid siege in form. This war at length ended in the entire cession of Neustria, which Charles tbe Simple was obliged to give up to Rollo and his Normans in order to purchase a peace. Rollo received it in perpetuity to himself and his posterity, as a feudal duchy dependent on the crown of France. A description of the interview between Charles and this new duke gives us a curious picture of the manners of these Normans ; for the latter would not take the oath of fealty to his sovereign lord any other way than by placing his hands within those of the king ; and absolutely refused to kiss his feet, as custom then required. It was with great difficulty that he was prevailed on to let one of his warriors perform this ceremony in his stead ; but the officer to whom</p><p>Rollo deputed this service suddenly raised the king’s foot so high, that he overturned him on his back ; a piece of rudeness which was only laughed at : to such a degree were the Normans feared, and Charles despised. Rollo was soon afterwards persuaded to embrace Christianity, and he was baptized with much ceremony by the archbishop of Rouen, in the cathedral of that city. As soon as he saw himself in full possession of Normandy, he exhibited such virtues as rendered the province happy, and deserved to make his former outrages forgotten. Religious, wise, and liberal, this captain of pirates became, after Alfred, the greatest and most humane prince of his time.</p><p>ROLLOCK, Robert, tbe first principal of the university of Edinburgh, was the son of David Bollock of Powis, in the vicinity of Stirling.
