<p><span class="font0">himſelf at the head of his victorious army, and marched to the temple of Jupiter Latialis, on the hill of Alba,&nbsp;with all the pomp that attended triumphant victors at&nbsp;Rome. He made no other alteration in the ceremony,&nbsp;but that of wearing a crown of myrtle inſtead of a&nbsp;crown of laurel, and this on account of his having defeated the Corſicans in a place where there was a grove&nbsp;of myrtles. The example of Papirius was afterwards&nbsp;followed by a great many generals to whom the ſenate&nbsp;refuſed triumphs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The next year, when M. Æmilius Barbula and M. Junius Pera were conſuls, a new war ſprung up in a&nbsp;kingdom out of Italy. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Illyricum,</span><span class="font0"> properly ſo called,&nbsp;which bordered upon Macedon and Epirus, was at this&nbsp;time governed by a woman named </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Teuta,</span><span class="font0"> the widow&nbsp;of king Agron, and guardian to her ſon Pinεeus, who&nbsp;was under age. The ſucceſs of her late huſhand againſt&nbsp;the Ætolians had fluſhed her to ſuch a degree, that,&nbsp;inſtead of ſettling the affairs of her ward in peace, ſhe&nbsp;commanded her ſubjects to cruiſe along the coaſt, ſeize&nbsp;all the ſhips they met, take what places they could, and&nbsp;ſpare no nation. Her pirates had, purſuant to her orders, taken and plundered many ſhips belonging to the&nbsp;Roman merchants ; and her troops were then beſieging&nbsp;the iſland of IfΓa in the Adriatic, though the inhabitants had put themſelves under the protection of the republic. Upon the complaints therefore of the Italian&nbsp;merchants, and to protect the people of Iſſa, the ſenate&nbsp;ſent two ambaſſadors to the Illyrian queen, Lucius and&nbsp;Caius Coruncanus, to demand of her that ſhe would&nbsp;reſtrain her ſubjects from infeſting the ſea with pirates.&nbsp;She anſwered them haughtily, that ſhe could only promiſe that her ſubjects ſhould not for the future attack&nbsp;the Romans in her name, and by public authority :&nbsp;“ but as for any thing more, it is not cuſtomary with us&nbsp;(ſaid ſhe) to lay reſtraints on our ſubjects, nor will we&nbsp;forbid them to reap thoſe advantages from the ſea which&nbsp;it offers them.” Your cuſtoms then (replied the young-eſt of the ambaſſadors) are very different from ours.&nbsp;At Rome we make public examples of thoſe ſubjects&nbsp;who injure others, whether at home or abroad. Teuta,&nbsp;we can, by our arms, force you to reform the abuſes of&nbsp;your bad government.” Theſe unſeaſonable threaten-ings provoked Teuta, who was naturally a proud and imperious woman, to ſuch a degree, that, without regard&nbsp;to the right of nations, ſhe cauſed the ambaſſadors to&nbsp;be murdered on their return home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When ſo notorious an infraction of the law of na-tions<sub>ι</sub>was known at Rome, the people demanded vengeance; and the ſenate having firſt honoured the manes of the ambaſſadors, by erecting, as was uſual in ſuch&nbsp;caſes, ſtatues three feet high to their memory, ordered&nbsp;a fleet to be equipped, and troops raiſed, with all poſſible expedition. But now Teuta, reflecting on the&nbsp;enormity of her proceedings, ſent an embaſſy to Rome,&nbsp;aſſuring the ſenate that ſhe had no hand in the murder&nbsp;of the ambaſſadors, and offering to deliver up to the&nbsp;republic thoſe who had committed that barbarous aſ-ſaſſination. The Romans being at that time threatened with a war from the Gauls, were ready to accept&nbsp;this ſatisfaction : but in the mean time the Illyrian fleet&nbsp;having gained ſome advantage over that of the Achæ-ans, and taken the iſland of Corcyra near Epirus, this&nbsp;ſucceſs made Teuta believe herſelf invincible, and forget the promiſe ſhe had made to the Romans ; nay, ſhe&nbsp;ſent her fleet to ſeize on the iſland of Iſſa, which the&nbsp;Romans had taken under their protection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Hereupon the conſuls for the new year, P. Poſthumius Albinus and Cn. Fulvius Centumalus, embarked for Illyricum; Fulvius having the command of the fleet,&nbsp;which conſiſted of ιoo galleys; and Poſthumius of the&nbsp;land forces, which amounted to 20,000 foot, beſides a&nbsp;ſmall body of horſe. Fulvius appeared with his fleet&nbsp;before Corcyra in the Adriatic, and was put in poſſeſſion both of the iſland and city by Demetrius of&nbsp;Pharos, governor of the place for Queen Teuta. Nor&nbsp;was this all ; Demetrius found means to make the inhabitants of Apollonia drive out the Illyrian garriſon,&nbsp;and admit into their city the Roman troops. As Apollonia was one of the keys of Illyricum on the ſide of&nbsp;Macedon» the conſuls, who had hitherto acted jointly,&nbsp;no ſooner ſaw themſelves in poſſeſſion of it than they&nbsp;ſeparated, the fleet cruiſing along the coaſt, and the&nbsp;army penetrating into the heart of the queen’s dominions. The Andyœans, Parthini, and Atintanes, voluntarily ſubmitted to Poſthumius, being induced by&nbsp;the perſuaſions of Demetrius to ſhake off the Illyrian&nbsp;yoke. The conſul being now in poſſeſſion of moſt of&nbsp;the inland towns, returned to the coaſt, where, with&nbsp;the aſſiſtance of the fleet, he took many ſtrong holds,&nbsp;among which was Nutria, a place of great ſtrength, and&nbsp;defended by a numerous garriſon ; ſo that it made a vigorous defence, the Romans having loſt before it a great&nbsp;many private men, ſeveral legionary tribunes, and one&nbsp;quæftor. However, this loſs was repaired by the taking of 40 Illyrian veſſels, which were returning home&nbsp;laden with booty. At length the Roman fleet appeared&nbsp;before Iſſa, which, by Teuta’s order, was ſtill cloſely&nbsp;beſieged, notwithſtanding the loſſes ſhe had ſuſtained.&nbsp;However, upon the approach of the Roman fleet, the&nbsp;Illyrians diſperſed ; but the Pharians, who ſerved among&nbsp;them, followed the example of their countryman Demetrius, and joined the Romans, to whom the Iſſani readily ſubmitted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the mean time Sp. Corvilius and Q. Fabius Maximus being raiſed to the conſulate a ſecond time, Poſthumius w-as recalled from Illyricum, and refuſed a triumph for having been too prodigal of the Roman blood at the ſiege of Nutria. . His colleague Fulvius was appointed to command the land forces in his room, in&nbsp;quality of proconſul. Hereupon Teuta, who had founded great hopes on the change of the conſuls, retired to&nbsp;one of her ſtrong-holds called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rl&gt;ixon,</span><span class="font0"> and from thence&nbsp;early in the ſpring ſent an embaſſy to Rome. The ſenate reſuſed to treat with her ; but granted the young&nbsp;king a peace upon the following conditions : 1. That&nbsp;he ſhould pay an annual tribute to the republic. 2. That&nbsp;he ſhould ſurrender part of his dominions to the Romans. 3. That he ſhould never ſuffer above three of&nbsp;his ſhips of war at a time to ſail beyond Lyſſus, a town&nbsp;on the confines of Macedon and Illyricum. The places&nbsp;he yielded to the Romans in virtue of this treaty, were&nbsp;the iſlands of Corcyra, Iffa, and Pharos, the city of&nbsp;Dyrrhachium, and the country of the Atintanes. Soon&nbsp;after Teuta, either out of ſhame, or compelled by a ſecret article of the treaty, abdicated the regency, and&nbsp;Demetrius ſucceeded her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Before this war was ended, the Romans were alarmed by new motions of the Gauls, and the great progreſs which the Carthaginians made in Spain. At this time</span></p>
