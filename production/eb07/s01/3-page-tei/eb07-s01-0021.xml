The country is flat to the bottom of the hills, which rise abruptly, being the northern boundary of the immense valley through which the Ganges flows in its progress to the sea. The whole district was, about the middle of the last century, made over to Nijeeb Khan, an Afghan chief, who brought it into a high state of cultivation, and was succeeded by his son, Zabita Khan, who, dying in 1785, was succeeded by his son Ghoolam Kadir, a cruel tyrant. He rebelled against the unfortunate emperor Shah Alum, and put out his eyes, and tortured and starved to death many of the royal family ; in retaliation for which he was himself put to death by the Mahratta chief Mahdajee Sindia, who took possession of the district. In 1803, this country, with all the other Mahratta possessions between the Ganges and the Jumna, was acquired by the British government, and in 1804 was separated into two divisions, the northern and the southern, and placed under the superintendence of a civil establishment of a judge, collector, &amp;c. and has since been divided into two collectorships. From the death of Aurungzebe, until its acquisition by the British in 1803, it was one continued scene of intestine commotion. The capital is of the same name, and is an open town, a hundred and five miles north by east from Delhi. Long. 77. 23. E. Lat. 30. 15.

In sacred writ it is often mentioned along with Tyre, and always as a flourishing commercial city. It was occupied by the French during the middle ages, who repaired and strengthened the fortifications. Although decayed from its ancient splendour, it is still of importance as the port of Damascus. It is situated in a plain extending only two miles inward from the sea, when it rises into steep mountains, barren and unproductive ; and hence its prosperity must always have been derived from commerce. The town extends six hundred paces along the sea. It is, like all Turkish towns, dirty, ill built, and filled with ruins. It formerly had a magnificent harbour, composed of vast moles stretching out into the sea, but it is now entirely destroyed. The huge stones of which it was built may be still seen, some twelve feet long by eleven broad, and five deep. It is said to be the work of Louis IX. but contains on the top work of an older date. The harbour is said to have been ruined by Feckerdine, emir of the Druses, when he established an independent power with a view of preventing the grand seignior from effecting a landing with a maritime force. On the opposite side of the town is a modern fort, consisting merely of a large tower, but incapable of resisting any serious attack. The road is formed by a shoal running opposite the castle, and leaving a space between, where vessels may ride, though not in perfect safety. The surrounding country is laid out in gardens and orchards, which appear very beautiful at a distance. It carries on a considerable trade, and is the emporium, not only of Damascus, but of the surrounding country. The exports consist of corn, silk, raw and spun cotton, the last article forming the principal trade of the inhabitants. It is now included in the pashalik of Damascus. The population is from 7000 to 8000. Long. 35. 14. E. Lat. 33. 25.

Although the form of sails is extremely different, they are all nevertheless triangular or quadrilateral figures ; or, in other words, their surfaces are contained either between three or four sidcs.</p><p>The former of these are sometimes spread by a yard, as lateen-sails, and otherwise by a stay, as stay-sails, or by a mast, as shoulder-of-mutton sails ; in all which cases the foremost leech or edge is attached to the said yard, mast, or stay, throughout its whole length. The latter, or those which are four-sided, are either extended by yards, as the principal yards of a ship ; or by yards and booms, as the studding-sails, drivers, ring-tails, and all those sails which are set occasionally ; or by gaffs and booms, as the mainsails of sloops and brigantines.

This is particularly used in saluting or doing homage to a superior force, or to one whom the law of nations acknowledges as superior in certain regions. Thus all foreign vessels strike to a British man-of-war in the British seas.</p><p>SAILING, the movement by which a vessel is wafted along the surface of the water, by the action of the wind upon her sails.</p><p>When a ship changes her state of rest into that of motion, as in advancing out of a harbour, or from her station at anchor, she acquires motion very gradually, as a body which arrives not at a certain velocity till after an infinite repetition of the action of its weight.</p><p>The first impression of the wind greatly affects the velocity, because the resistance of the water might destroy it ; since the velocity being but small at first, the resistance of the water which depends upon it will be very feeble. But as the ship increases her motion, the force of the wind on the sails will be diminished ; and, on the contrary, the resistance of the water on the bow will accumulate in proportion to the velocity with which the vessel advances. Thus the repetition of the degrees of force, which the action of the sail adds to the motion of the ship, is perpetually decreasing ; while the new degrees added to the effort of resistance on the bow are always augmenting. The velocity is then accelerated in proportion as the quantity added is greater than that which is subtracted ; but when the two powers become equal, when the impression of the wind on the sails has lost so much of its force as only to act in proportion to the opposite impulse of resistance on the bow, the ship will then acquire no additional velocity, but continue to sail with a constant uniform motion. The great weight of the ship may indeed prevent her from acquiring the greatest velocity ; but when she has attained it, she will advance by her own intrinsic motion, w ithout gaining any new degree of velocity, or lessening what she has acquired. She moves then by her own proper force <hi rend="italic">in vacuo, </hi>without being afterwards subject either to the effort of the wind on the sails, or to the resistance of the water on the bow. If at any time the impulsion of the water on the bow</p></body></text></TEI>
