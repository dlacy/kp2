<p><span class="font1">45 miles unites with the Hinter Rhein at Reichenau. As far as Ilanz the Vorder Rhein is simply a mountain torrent,&nbsp;descending 1200 feet in the first 12 miles of its course.&nbsp;At Disentis, where it is joined by the Medelser Rhein, it&nbsp;is 15 feet wide, and at Ilanz it is about thrice as large.&nbsp;The Hinter Rhein has its cradle in the Rheinwald glacier,&nbsp;near the St Bernardino Pass, 7270 feet above the sea&nbsp;and 40 miles south of Reichenau. The Vorder Rhein contributes the greater volume of water to the joint stream,&nbsp;but the Hinter Rhein belongs to a more developed system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Beyond Reichenau the united stream, 150 feet in width, bears the name of Rhine without any qualifying epithet.&nbsp;It is now navigable for rafts, and small boats begin to be&nbsp;seen a little further on, at Coire, where it turns to the&nbsp;north. On reaching the Lake of Constance the Rhine&nbsp;deposits the debris that it has brought down from its&nbsp;mountain sources, and the stream that emerges from the&nbsp;west end of the Untersee is of a clear deep green colour.&nbsp;Between the Lake of Constance and Basel the Rhine flows&nbsp;towards the west and practically forms the boundary between Germany and Switzerland. At Schaffhausen, in&nbsp;penetrating the barrier of the Jura, it forms the imposing&nbsp;falls of the Rhine, where it is precipitated over a ledge of&nbsp;rock in three leaps 50 or 60 feet in height. Near Lauterburg, where the river encounters the gneiss of the Black&nbsp;Forest, is a series of formidable cataracts, and about 15&nbsp;miles lower down are the rapids of Rheinfelden. At Basel,&nbsp;which it reaches after a tortuous course of 250 miles,&nbsp;though it is only about a third of that distance from its&nbsp;source in a direct line, the Rhine turns once more to the&nbsp;north and enters Germany. Its breadth here is between&nbsp;550 and 600 feet, while its surface now lies not more than&nbsp;800 feet above the sea, showing that the river has made a&nbsp;descent of 6900 feet by the time it has traversed a third of&nbsp;its course. From Basel to Mainz the Rhine flows through&nbsp;a wide and shallow valley, bordered on the east and west&nbsp;by the parallel ranges of the Black Forest and the Vosges.&nbsp;Its banks are low and flat, and numerous islands occur.&nbsp;The tendency to divide into parallel branches has been&nbsp;curbed in the interests of navigation, and many windings&nbsp;have been cut off by leading the water into straight and&nbsp;regular channels. At Mannheim the river is nearly 1500&nbsp;feet in width, and at Mainz, where it is diverted to the&nbsp;west by the barrier of the Taunus, it is still wider. It&nbsp;follows the new direction for about 20 miles, but at Bingen&nbsp;it again turns to the north and begins a completely new&nbsp;stage of its career, entering a narrow valley in which the&nbsp;enclosing rocky hills abut so closely on the river as often&nbsp;barely to leave room for the road and railway on the bank.&nbsp;This is the most beautiful part of the whole course of the&nbsp;river, abounding in the ruined castles, the romantic crags,&nbsp;the sunny vineyards, and the picturesque lateral ravines&nbsp;that have combined to make the Rhine so favourite a&nbsp;resort of lovers of natural beauty. At Coblentz the valley&nbsp;widens and the river is 1200 feet broad, but the hills&nbsp;close in again at Andernach, and this ravine-like part of its&nbsp;course cannot be considered as ending till below the Seven&nbsp;Mountains, where the river once more expands to a width of</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">1300-1600 feet. Beyond Bonn and Cologne the banks are again flat and the valley wide, though the hills on the&nbsp;right bank do not completely disappear till the neighbourhood of Düsseldorf. Further on the country traversed by&nbsp;the Rhine is perfectly level, and the current becomes more&nbsp;and more sluggish. On entering Holland, which it does&nbsp;below Emmerich, its course is again deflected to the west.&nbsp;Within Holland the banks are so low as to require at places&nbsp;to be protected by embankments against inundations.&nbsp;The river now loses its individuality in a number of&nbsp;separate branches, and the name of Rhine has often arbitrarily clung to the smaller arm after a bifurcation. Almost&nbsp;immediately after entering Holland the stream divides&nbsp;into two arms, the larger of which, carrying off about&nbsp;two-thirds of the water, diverges to the west, is called&nbsp;the Waal, and soon unites with the Maas. The smaller&nbsp;branch to the right retains the name of Rhine and sends&nbsp;off another arm, called the Yssel, to the Zuyder Zee. The&nbsp;Rhine now pursues a westerly course almost parallel with&nbsp;that of the Waal. At Wijk another bifurcation takes&nbsp;place, the broad Lek diverging on the left to join the&nbsp;Maas, while the “ Kromme Rhijn” to the right is comparatively insignificant. Beyond Utrecht, where it is&nbsp;again diminished by the divergence of the Vecht to the&nbsp;Zuyder Zee, the river under the name of the “ Oude Rhijn ”&nbsp;or Old Rhine degenerates into a sluggish and almost&nbsp;stagnant stream, which requires the artificial aid of a&nbsp;canal and sluices in finding its way to the sea. In&nbsp;Roman times the Rhine at this part of its course seems to&nbsp;have been a full and flowing river, but by the 9th century&nbsp;it had lost itself in the sands of Katwijk, and it was not until&nbsp;the beginning of the l9th century that its way to the sea&nbsp;was re-opened. Though the name Rhine thus at last&nbsp;attaches to a very insignificant stream, the entire district&nbsp;between the Waal on one side and the Yssel on the other,&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Insula Batαvorum</span><span class="font1"> of Cæsar, in reality belongs to the&nbsp;delta of the famous river.</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> See vol. xii. Plate I.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Rhine is said to receive, directly or indirectly, the waters of upwards of 12,000 tributaries of all sizes.&nbsp;Leaving out of account the innumerable glacier streams&nbsp;that swell its volume above the Lake of Constance, the&nbsp;most important affluents to its upper course are the&nbsp;Wutach, the Alb, and the Wiese, descending on the right&nbsp;from the Black Forest, and the Aar, draining several&nbsp;Swiss cantons on the left. In the Upper Rhenish basin,&nbsp;between Basel and Mainz, the tributaries, though numerous,&nbsp;are mostly short and unimportant. The 111 and the Nahe&nbsp;on the left and the Neckar and the Main on the right are,&nbsp;however, notable exceptions. Before joining the Rhine&nbsp;the 111 runs almost parallel with it and at no great distance&nbsp;for upwards of 50 miles. In the narrow part of the&nbsp;valley, between Bingen and Cologne, the Rhine receives&nbsp;the waters of the Lahn and the Sieg on the right, and&nbsp;those of the Moselle</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup> (bringing with it the Saar) and the&nbsp;Ahr on the left. Still lower down, but before the Dutch&nbsp;frontier is reached, come the Ruhr and the Lippe on the&nbsp;right, and the Erft on the left. The numerous arms into&nbsp;which the Rhine branches in Holland have already been&nbsp;noticed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Rhine connects the highest Alps with the mud banks of Holland, and touches in its course the most varied geological&nbsp;periods ; but the river valley itself is, geologically speaking, of&nbsp;comparatively recent formation. Rising amid the ancient gneiss&nbsp;rocks of the St Gotthard, the Rhine finds its way down to the Lake&nbsp;of Constance between layers of Triassic and Jurassic formation ; and&nbsp;between that lake and Basel it penetrates the chalk barrier of the&nbsp;Jura. The upper Rhenish valley is evidently the bed of an ancient&nbsp;lake, the shores of which were formed by the gneiss and granite&nbsp;of the Black Forest on the one side and the granite and sandstone&nbsp;of the Vosges on the other. Within the valley all the alluvial</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">@@@<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nomenclature of the Rhine branches in the Netherlands is,&nbsp;according to Mr J. Dirks, a singular but historic system, by which&nbsp;the rivers are chopped up, as it were, into longitudinal pieces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">@@@<sup>2</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Moselle rises in France, in the canton of Ramonchamp, at a&nbsp;height of 2379 feet above the sea, on the west side of the Vosges. Its&nbsp;length is 315 miles (of which 190 are in France), but the direct line&nbsp;from source to confluence is only about 170 miles. At Épinal (1040&nbsp;feet) the Moselle passes out of the rocky mountain-glen where its&nbsp;course has hitherto been. It enters the Lorraine plateau, but the&nbsp;sides of the valley still remain high and steep. Below Metz (550 feet)&nbsp;the bottom-lands spread out to a considerable width ; in the section&nbsp;between Sierck and Coblentz the hills again close in upon the river.&nbsp;Rafts can generally be floated from Arches down to Frouard, and&nbsp;there, by the junction of the Meurthe (itself navigable, though with&nbsp;difficulty, from Nancy), the depth becomes sufficient for boats. Since&nbsp;1840 steamboats have plied between Treves and Coblentz.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
