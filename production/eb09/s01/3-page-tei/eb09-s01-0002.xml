And his learning was exceeded by his manifold virtues. His love of truth and justice was made more conspicuous by the darkness of the corruption amid which he lived. When the rēsh gāluthā (“prince of the captivity,” the highest dignitary of the Jews in Babylonia, and to some extent of those of the whole world) attempted to wrest judgment in a certain case, and first asked, then requested, and finally demanded the signature @@<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> of the gaon of Sūrā in a threatening manner, Se'adyah refused it, fearless of consequences. David b. Zakkai, the rēsh gāluthā, deposed him and chose another gaon in his stead. A reconciliation took place some years afterwards, and Se'adyah was reinstated in his old dignity. And, although his health had been fatally undermined by the behaviour of the rēsh gāluthā and his son, Se'adyah, when his former opponent died, was indefatigable in his endeavours to have this very son of his once mortal enemy placed on the throne of his fathers. But the new prince of the captivity enjoyed his dignity for little more than half a year. He left behind him a boy, twelve years of age, whom Se'adyah took into his own house and treated in every respect as his own child. This learning and these virtues endeared Se'adyah not merely to his contemporaries but also to the best men of succeeding ages. Behayye b. Yoseph (the author of the <hi rend="italic">Hoboth Hallebaboth),</hi> Rashi, Se'adyah (the author of the commentary on Daniel in the Rabbinic Bible), David Kimḥi, Behayye b. Asher (the author of <hi rend="italic">Kad Haḳḳemah), </hi>all appeal to him as an authority not to be questioned. Even Ibn 'Ezra defers more to him than to any other authority. To this day Jewish and Christian scholars alike express for him the highest admiration.</p><p>The numerous works which are ascribed to him may be conveniently divided into four classes.</p><p>I. <hi rend="italic">Genuine and still extant Works.—</hi>(1) Arabic translations of, and in part commentaries @@<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> on, books of the Bible : (a) the Pentateuch (printed in Hebrew characters, Constantinople, 1546, fob, and in Arabic characters in the Paris and London polyglotte) ; (δ) Isaiah (printed in Arabic characters from Hebrew letters of the Bodleian MS.
