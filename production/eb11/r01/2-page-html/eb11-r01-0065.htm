<p><span class="font0">transported to these frontier sections only to become dependent upon the railways for their very existence. To the unusual&nbsp;temptations thus offered for favouritism and discriminations&nbsp;in rates, the railways generally yielded. This preferential and discriminating policy, combined with other causes which&nbsp;cannot here be discussed, resulted in the Granger legislation&nbsp;of the ’seventies. In the first instance laws were enacted prescribing schedules of maximum freight and passenger rates&nbsp;with stringent penalties against rebates and discriminations.&nbsp;These measures proving unsatisfactory, they were soon superseded by statutes creating railway commissions with varied&nbsp;powers of regulation. The commission method of control was&nbsp;not a new one. Such bodies, established to appraise land for&nbsp;railway purposes, to apportion receipts and expenditures of&nbsp;interstate traffic, and in a general way to supervise railway&nbsp;transportation, had been in existence in New England before&nbsp;186o, one of the earliest being that of Rhode Island in 1839.&nbsp;In 1869 Massachusetts had instituted a commission of more&nbsp;modern type, which was given only powers of investigation&nbsp;and recommendation, the force of public opinion being relied&nbsp;upon to make its orders effective. Western commissions,&nbsp;the offspring of the Granger movement, were of a more vigorous&nbsp;type. Most of them had power to impose schedules of maximum&nbsp;rates; practically all of them had authority to prescribe rates&nbsp;upon complaint of shippers; and they could all seek the aid&nbsp;of the courts to enforce their decrees. Their power to initiate&nbsp;rates, conferred upon them by their legislatures, was sustained&nbsp;by the Supreme Court of the United States, the Court reserving&nbsp;to itself only the power to decide whether the prescribed rates&nbsp;were reasonable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But the jurisdiction of the state commissions was, by judicial interpretation, limited to commerce beginning and ending within&nbsp;the limits of the single state. The most important part of&nbsp;railway transportation, that which was interstate in character,&nbsp;was left untouched. It was this impotence of the state commission that furnished the strongest incentive to Congressional&nbsp;action. The result was the passage, in 1887, of the Interstate&nbsp;Commerce Act, which was directed towards the extirpation of&nbsp;illegal and unjust practices in commerce among the states. Its&nbsp;primary purpose was to embody in statutory form the common-law principle of equal treatment under like circumstances, and&nbsp;to provide machinery for enforcement. It aimed at the&nbsp;prohibition of discrimination between persons, places and&nbsp;commodities. It made provision for publicity of rates and for&nbsp;due notice of any change in rates; it forbade pooling of freight&nbsp;or earnings, and required annual reports from the carriers. For&nbsp;its enforcement, it created an Interstate Commerce Commission&nbsp;of five members, with powers of investigation, and with authority&nbsp;to issue remedial orders upon complaint and after hearing.&nbsp;Findings of the Commission were to be prima facie evidence in&nbsp;any court proceeding for the enforcement of its orders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In this connexion, reference should be made to the Anti-Trust Act of 1890, which, by its judicial interpretation, has been held to&nbsp;include railways and to forbid rate agreements between competing carriers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The act of 1887 remained in force without substantial amendment until 1906, although with constantly diminishing prestige, a result largely due to adverse decisions concerning the powers of&nbsp;the Commission. Ten years after the passage of the law, the&nbsp;court decided that the Commission had no power to prescribe&nbsp;a rate, and that its jurisdiction over rates was confined to a&nbsp;determination of the question whether the rate complained of&nbsp;was unreasonable. The Commission had much difficulty at the&nbsp;beginning in securing the testimony of witnesses, who invoked&nbsp;the Constitution of the United States as a bar against self-incrimination, and the immunity clause of the act had to be&nbsp;amended before testimony could be obtained. The so-called&nbsp;“ long-and-short-haul clause, ” which forbade a greater charge&nbsp;for a long than for a short haul over the same line, if circum-stances were substantially similar, was also robbed of all its&nbsp;vitality by court decision. The section requiring annual reports,&nbsp;while it led to the creation of a Bureau of Statistics, did not give&nbsp;the Commission power to compel complete or satisfactory answers&nbsp;to its requests for information. The only element of real&nbsp;strength that the statute acquired during the first twenty years&nbsp;of its history came from the Elkins Act of 1903, which stipulated&nbsp;that the published rate should be the legal rate, and declared&nbsp;any departure from the published rate to be a misdemeanour.&nbsp;It held shipper as well as carrier, and corporation as well as its&nbsp;officer or agent, liable for violations of the act, and conferred upon&nbsp;United States courts power to employ equity processes in putting&nbsp;an end to discrimination. Conviction for granting rebates was&nbsp;by this law made easier and more effective.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Since 1900. —</span><span class="font0">The movement in favour of more vigorous railway regulation became pronounced after 1900. Twenty&nbsp;years of experience and observation had revealed the defects&nbsp;of the earlier legislation, and had concentrated public attention more intelligently than ever before upon the problem of&nbsp;strengthening the weak spots. The state commissions, since&nbsp;their establishment in the ’seventies and the ’eighties, had&nbsp;increased their functions and influence. Many of them,&nbsp;beginning only with powers of recommendation, had obtained a&nbsp;large extension of authority. By 1908, thirty-five of the forty&nbsp;state commissions were of the mandatory type, and thirteen of&nbsp;these had been created since 1904. They had been given power&nbsp;to require complete annual reports from carriers, with a consequent great increase in public knowledge concerning railway&nbsp;operation and practice. The most recent type of state commission is the so-called Public Utility Commission, of which the&nbsp;best examples are those of New York and Wisconsin, established&nbsp;in 1907. In both states, the Commissions have power over&nbsp;electric railways and local public utilities furnishing heat, light&nbsp;and power, as well as over steam railway transportation, and the&nbsp;Wisconsin Commission also has control over telephone companies.&nbsp;In both states the consent of the Commission is necessary for the&nbsp;issue of corporate securities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Mention should be made of the mass of general legislation passed, principally by western states, since 1905, in response&nbsp;to a popular demand for lower rates. This demand has in many&nbsp;instances led to ill-considered legislation, has frequently ignored&nbsp;the prerogatives and even the existence of the state commissions,&nbsp;and has brought about the passage by state legislatures of maximum&nbsp; freight and passenger rate laws, with rates so low in many&nbsp;cases that they have been set aside by the courts as unconstitutional. The numerous laws limiting the fare for passengers to&nbsp;two cents per mile are an illustration of this tendency. </span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the field of federal legislation, no significant change took place until the passage of the Hepburn Act of 1906, which was an&nbsp;amendment of the act of 1887. While failing to correct all the&nbsp;defects in the original statute, the amended law was a decided&nbsp;step in the direction of efficient regulation. It increased the&nbsp;jurisdiction of the Commission by placing under the act express&nbsp;companies, sleeping-car companies and pipe lines for the&nbsp;transportation of oil. It extended the meaning of the term&nbsp;“ railroad ” to include switches, spurs and terminal facilities,&nbsp;and the term “ transportation ” to include private cars, and all&nbsp;collateral services, such as refrigeration, elevation and storage.&nbsp;The Elkins Act of 1903 was incorporated in the statute, and an&nbsp;imprisonment penalty was added to the existing fine. It&nbsp;forbade the granting of passes except to certain specified classes,&nbsp;—a provision entirely absent from the original measure. It&nbsp;expressly conferred upon the Commission the power to prescribe&nbsp;maximum rates, upon complaint and after hearing, as well as&nbsp;to make joint rates, and to establish through rates when the&nbsp;carriers had themselves refused to do so. It enacted that&nbsp;published rates should not be changed except on thirty days’&nbsp;notice, whether the change involved an increase or a decrease,&nbsp;and it required annual reports to be made under oath, penalties&nbsp;being prescribed for failure to comply with the Commission’s&nbsp;requests for information. Power was also given to prescribe&nbsp;uniform systems of accounts for all classes of carriers, and to&nbsp;employ special examiners to inspect the books and accounts.&nbsp;Carriers were forbidden to keep any accounts, records or&nbsp;memoranda other than those approved by the Commission.</span></p>
