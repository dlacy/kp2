<p><span class="font1">idea, that he was introduced to flatter the personal vanity 'of the princes of the Valois race, by a portrait of their great&nbsp;predecessor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The circumstance that Roland was a lieutenant of Brittany, and the certainty that Marie borrowed from that country the incidents out of which she composed her lays, seems to fortify the theory, that the French minstrels obtained&nbsp;from that country much of their most valuable materials ;&nbsp;and that, after all that has been said and supposed, the history&nbsp;of Arthur probably reached them through the same channel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Latin writers of the middle ages afforded the French romancers the themes of those metrical legends which they&nbsp;have composed on subjects of classical fame.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The honour of the prose romances of chivalry, exclusive always of the books of Amadis, belongs entirely to the&nbsp;French, and the curious volumes which are now the object&nbsp;of so much research amongst collectors, are almost universally printed at Paris.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">England, so often conquered, yet fated to receive an accession of strength from each new subjugation, cannot boast much of ancient literature of any kind ; and, in the department of which we treat, was totally inferior to France. The&nbsp;Saxons had, no doubt, romances (taking the word in its general acceptation) ; and Mr. Turner, to whose researches&nbsp;we are so much indebted, has given us the abridgment of&nbsp;one entitled </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Caedmon,</span><span class="font1"> in which the hero, whose adventures&nbsp;are told much after tlle manner of the ancient Norse Sagas,&nbsp;encounters, defeats, and finally slays an evil being called&nbsp;Grendel, who, except in his being subject to death, seems&nbsp;a creature of a supernatural description. But the literature&nbsp;of the Saxons was destroyed by the success of William the&nbsp;Conqueror, and the Norman knights and barons, among&nbsp;whom England was in a great measure divided, sought&nbsp;amusement, not in the lays of the vanquished, but in those&nbsp;composed in their own language. In this point of view,&nbsp;England, as a country, may lay claim to many of the French&nbsp;romances, which were written, indeed, in that language,&nbsp;but for the benefit of the court and nobles of England, </span><span class="font2">by&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">whom French was still spoken. When the two languages&nbsp;began to assimilate together, and to form the mixed dialect&nbsp;termed the Anglo-Norman, we have good authority for saying that it was easily applied to the purpose of romantic&nbsp;fiction, and recited in the presence of the nobility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Robert de Brunne, who composed his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">History of England </span><span class="font1">about this time, has this remarkable passage, which we give,&nbsp;along with the commentary of the editor of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sir Tristrem,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">as it is peculiarly illustrative of the subject we are inquiring&nbsp;into.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">“ This passage requires some commentary, as the sense has been generally mistaken. Robert de Brunne does not&nbsp;mean, as has been supposed, that the minstrels who repeated Thomas’s romance of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sir Tristrem,</span><span class="font1"> disguised the&nbsp;meaning by putting it into </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">quainte Inglis ;</span><span class="font1"> but, on the&nbsp;contrary, that Kendal and Thomas of Erceldoune did themselves use such </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">quainte Inglis,</span><span class="font1"> that those who repeated&nbsp;the story were unable to understand it, or to make it intelligible to their hearers. Above all, he complains that, by&nbsp;writing an intricate and complicated stanza, as ‘ </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ryme cowee,&nbsp;strangere,</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">entrelacé,'</span><span class="font1"> it was difficult for the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">diseurs</span><span class="font1"> to recollect the poem ; and of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sir Tristrem,</span><span class="font1"> in particular, he&nbsp;avers, that he never heard a perfect recital, because of some&nbsp;one </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">‘ coppld</span><span class="font1"> or stanza, a part was always omitted. Hence&nbsp;he argues at length, that he himself, writing not for the minstrel or harper, nor to acquire personal fame, but solely to&nbsp;instruct the ignorant in the history of their country, does&nbsp;well in chusing a simple structure of verse, which they can&nbsp;retain correctly on their memory, and a style which is popular and easily understood. Besides which, he hints at&nbsp;tlle ridicule he might draw on his poem, should he introduce the uncouth names of his personages into a courtly or&nbsp;refined strain of verse. They were</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Great names, but hard in verse to stand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">While he arrogates praise to himself for his choice, he excuses Thomas of Erceldoune and Kendale for using a more ambitious and ornate kind of poetry. They wrote, he says,&nbsp;for pride (fame) and for nobles, not such as these my ignorant hearers.”@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If the editor of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sir Tristrem</span><span class="font1"> be correct in his commentary, there existed in the time of Robert de Brunne, minstrels or poets who composed English poetry to be recited in the presence of the great, and who, for that purpose, used&nbsp;a singularly difficult stanza, which was very apt to be mutilated in recitation. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sir Tristrem,</span><span class="font1"> even as it now exists,&nbsp;shows likewise that considerable art was resorted to in constructing the stanza, and has, from beginning to end, a concise, quaint, abstract turn of expression, more like the Saxon poetry, than the simple, bald, and diffuse details of the&nbsp;French minstrel.
