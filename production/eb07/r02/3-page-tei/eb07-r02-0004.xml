We must keep up their waters for the purposes of navigation, or supply their places by canals; we must drain our fens, and defend them when drained; we must understand their motions, and their mode of secret, slow, but unceasing action, that our bridges, our wharfs, our dikes, may not become heaps of ruins, ignorant how to proceed in these daily recurring cases, how often do we see projects of high expectation and heavy expense fail of their object, leaving the state burdened with works not only useless, but frequently hurtful?</p><p>This has long been a most interesting subject of study in Italy, where the fertility of their fields is not more indebted to their rich soil and happy climate, than to their numerous derivations from the rivers which traverse them; and in Holland and Flanders, where their very existence requires unceasing attention to the waters, which are every moment ready to swallow up the inhabitants, and where the inhabitants, having once subdued this formidable enemy, have made those very waters their indefatigable drudges, transporting through every corner of the country the materials of an extensive commerce.</p><p>Such having been our incessant occupations with moving waters, we should expect, that while the operative artists are continually furnishing facts and experiments, the man of speculative and scientific curiosity, excited by the importance of the subject, would ere now have made considerable progress in the science; and that the professional engineer would be daily acting from established principle, and be seldom disappointed in his expectations. Unfortunately, the reverse of this is nearly the true state of the case: each engineer is obliged to collect the greatest part of his knowledge from his own experience, and by many dear-bought lessons, to direct his future operations, in which he still proceeds with anxiety and hesitation; for we have not yet acquired principles of theory, and experiments have not yet been collected and published by which an empirical practice might be safely formed. Many experiments of inestimable value are daily made; but they remain with their authors, who seldom have either leisure, ability, or generosity, to add them to the public stock.</p><p>The motion of waters has been really so little investigated as yet, that hydraulics may still be called a new study. We have merely skimmed over a few common notions concerning the motions of water; and the mathematicians of the first order seem to have contented themselves with such views as allowed them to entertain themselves with elegant applications of calculus. This, however, has not been their fault. They rarely had opportunity of doing more, for want of a knowledge of facts. They have made excellent use of the few which have been given them; but it required much labour, great variety of opportunity, and great expense, to learn the multiplicity of things which are combined even in the simplest cases of water in motion. These are seldom the lot of the mathematician; and he is without blame when he enjoys the pleasures within his reach, and cultivates the science of geometry in its most abstracted form. Here he makes a progress which is the boast of human reason, being almost insured from error by the intellectual simplicity of his subject. But when we turn our attention to material objects, and, without knowing either the size and shape of the elementary particles, or the laws which nature has prescribed for their action, presume to foresee their effects, calculate their exertions, direct their actions, what must be their consequence? Nature shows her independence with respect to our notions, and, always faithful to the laws which are enjoined, and of which we are ignorant, she never fails to thwart our views, to disconcert our projects, and render useless all our efforts.</p><p>To wish to know the nature of the elements is vain, and our gross organs are insufficient for the study. To sup</p><lb/><p>pose what we do not know, and to fancy shapes and sizes at will, is to raise phantoms, and will produce a system, but will not prove a foundation for any science. But to interrogate Nature herself, study the laws which she so faithfully observes, catch her, as we say, in the fact, and thus wrest from her the secret; this is the only way to become her master, and it is the only procedure consistent with good sense. And we see that soon after Kepler detected the laws of the planetary motions, when Galileo discovered the uniform acceleration of gravity, when Paschal discovered the pressure of the atmosphere, and Newton discovered the laws of attraction and the track of a ray of light; astronomy, mechanics, hydrostatics, chemistry, optics, quickly became bodies of sound doctrine, and the deductions from their respective theories were found fair representations of the phenomena of nature. Whenever a man has discovered a law of nature, he has laid the foundation of a science, and he has given us a new mean of subjecting to our service some element hitherto independent; and so long as groups of natural operations follow a route which appears to us whimsical, and will not admit our calculations, we may be assured that we are ignorant of the principle which connects them all, and regulates their procedure.</p><p>This is remarkably the case with several phenomena in the motions of fluids, and particularly in the motion of water in a bed or conduit of any kind. Although the first geniuses of Europe have for this century past turned much of their attention to this subject, we are almost ignorant of the <hi rend="italic">general laws</hi>  which may be observed in their motions. We have been able to select very few points of resemblance, and every case remains nearly an individual. About one hundred and fifty years ago we discovered, by experience only, the quantity and velocity of water issuing from a small orifice, and, after much labour, have extended this to any orifice; and this is almost the whole of our confidential knowledge. But as to the uniform course of the streams which water the face of the earth, and the maxims which will certainly regulate this agreeably to our wishes, we are in a manner totally ignorant. Who can pretend to say what is the velocity of a river of which you tell him the breadth, the depth, and the declivity? Who can say what swell will be produced in different parts of its course, if a dam or weir of given dimensions be made in it, or a bridge be thrown across it; or how much its waters will be raised by turning another stream into it, or sunk by taking off a branch to drive a mill? Who can say with confidence what must be the dimensions or slope of this branch, in order to furnish the water that is wanted, or the dimensions and slope of a canal which shall effectually drain a fenny district? Who can say what form will cause or will prevent the undermining of banks, the forming of elbows, the pooling of the bed, or the deposition of sands? Yet these are the most important questions.</p><p>The causes of this ignorance are the want or uncertainty of our principles; the falsity of our only theory, which is belied by experience; and the small number of proper observations or experiments, and difficulty of making such as shall be serviceable. We have, it is true, made a few experiments on the efflux of water from small orifices, and from them we have deduced a sort of theory, dependent on the fall of heavy bodies and the laws of hydrostatic pressure. Hydrostatics is indeed founded on very simple principles, which give a very good account of the laws of the quiescent equilibrium of fluids, in consequence of gravity and perfect fluidity. But by what train of reasoning can we connect these with the phenomena of the uniform motion of the waters of a river or open stream, which can derive its motion only from the slope of its surface, and the modifications of this motion or its velocity only from the width and depth of the stream? These are the only circumstances which can distinguish a portion of a river from</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
