        <p><span class="font0">to separate this diminution of motion from the sum total that is
                observed, and ascertain what part remains as produced by the subsequent
                obstructions.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">We shall then consider the principle of uniform motion, the
                equilibrium between the power and the resistance. The&nbsp;power is the relative
                height of the column of fluid which&nbsp;tends to move along the inclined plane of
                its bed ; the resistance is the friction of the bed, the viscidity of the
                fluid,&nbsp;and its adhesion to the sides. Here is necessarily combined a number of
                circumstances which must be gradually&nbsp;detached, that we may see the effect of
                each, viz. the extent&nbsp;of the bed, its perimeter, and its slope. By examining
                the&nbsp;effects produced by variations of each of these separately,&nbsp;we
                discover what share each has in the general effect ; and&nbsp;having thus analysed
                the complicated phenomena, we shall&nbsp;be able to combine those its elements, and
                frame a formula which shall comprehend every circumstance, from the&nbsp;greatest
                velocity to the extinction of all motion, and from&nbsp;the extent of a river to the
                narrow dimensions of a quill.&nbsp;We shall compare this formula with a series of
                experiments&nbsp;in all this variety of circumstances, partly made by Du
                Buat,&nbsp;and partly collected from other authors; and we shall leave&nbsp;the
                reader to judge of the agreement.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">Confident that this agreement will be found most satisfactory, we
                shall then proceed to consider very cursorily the chief varieties which nature or
                art may introduce into these&nbsp;beds, the different velocities of the same stream,
                the intensity of the resistance produced by the inertia of the materials of the
                channel, and the force of the current by which&nbsp;it continually acts on this
                channel, tending to change either&nbsp;its dimensions or its form. We shall
                endeavour to trace the&nbsp;origin of these great rivers which spread like the
                branches&nbsp;of a vigorous tree, and occupy the surface even of a
                vast&nbsp;continent. We shall follow them in their course, unfold&nbsp;all their
                windings, study their train and regimen, and point&nbsp;out the law of its stability
                ; and we shall investigate the&nbsp;causes of their deviations and
                wanderings.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">The study of these natural laws pleases the mind : but it answers a
                still greater purpose ; it enables us to assist nature, and to hasten her
                operations, which our wants and our&nbsp;impatience often find too slow. It enables
                us to command&nbsp;the elements, and to force them to administer to our
                wants&nbsp;and our pleasures.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">We shall therefore, in the next place, apply the knowledge which we
                may acquire to the solution of the most important hydraulic questions which occur in
                the practice of the civil engineer.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">We shall consider the effects produced by a permanent addition to any
                river or stream by the union of another, and&nbsp;the opposite effect produced by
                any draught or offset, showing the elevation or depression produced up the stream,
                and&nbsp;the change made in the depth and velocity below the addition or
                offset.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">We shall pay a similar attention to the temporary swells produced by
                freshes.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">We shall ascertain the effects of straightening the course of a
                stream, which, by increasing its slope, must increase its&nbsp;velocity, and
                therefore sink the waters above the place&nbsp;where the curvature was removed, and
                diminish the tendency to overflow, while the same immediate consequence&nbsp;must
                expose the places farther down to the risk of floods,&nbsp;from which they would
                otherwise have been free.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">The effects of dams or weirs, and of bars, must then be considered ;
                the gorge or swell which they produce up the&nbsp;stream must be determined for
                every distance from the&nbsp;weir or bar. This will furnish us with rules for
                rendering&nbsp;navigable or floatable such waters as have too little depth&nbsp;or
                too great slope. And it will appear that immense advantages may be thus derived,
                with a moderate expense,&nbsp;even from trifling brooks, if we will relinquish all
                prejudices,&nbsp;and not imagine that such conveyance is impossible because it
                cannot be carried on by such boats and small craft&nbsp;as we have been accustomed
                to look at.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">The effects of canals of derivation, the rules or maxims of draining,
                and the general maxims of embankment, come&nbsp;in the next place ; and our
                discussions will conclude with&nbsp;remarks on the most proper forms for the entry
                to canals,&nbsp;locks, docks, harbours, and mouths of rivers, the best
                shape&nbsp;for the startlings of bridges and of boats for inland navigation, and
                such like subordinate but interesting particulars,&nbsp;which will be suggested by
                the general thread of discussion.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">It is considered as physically demonstrated (see Hydrodynamics), that
                water issuing from a small orifice in the bottom or side of a very large vessel,
                almost instantly acquires and maintains the velocity which a heavy body
                would&nbsp;acquire by falling to the orifice from the horizontal surface&nbsp;of the
                stagnant water. This we shall call its natural&nbsp;velocity. Therefore, if we
                multiply the area of the orifice by this velocity, the product will be the bulk or
                quantity of the water which is discharged. This we may call&nbsp;the natural expense
                of water, or the natural discharge.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">Let O represent the area or section of the orifice expressed in some
                known measure, and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;"
                >h</span><span class="font0"> its depth under the surface. Let </span><span
                class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">g</span><span class="font0"> express the
                velocity acquired by a heavy body during a second by falling. Let V be the medium
                velocity&nbsp;of the water’s motion, Q the quantity of water discharged&nbsp;during
                a second, and N the natural expense.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">We know that V is equal to </span><span class="font0"
                style="font-style:italic;">V2g × &lt;fh.</span><span class="font0"> Therefore N = O
                √¾) √A.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">If these dimensions be all taken in English feet, we have √2^ very
                nearly equal to 8 ; and therefore V = 8 ,<sub>t</sub>∕λ,&nbsp;and N = O 8
            √Λ.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">But in our present business it is much more convenient to measure
                every thing by inches. Therefore, since a body&nbsp;acquires the velocity of 32 feet
                2 inches in a second, we&nbsp;have </span><span class="font0"
                style="font-style:italic;">2g =</span><span class="font0"> 64 feet 4 inches, or 772
                inches, and √2y = 27∙78&nbsp;inches, nearly 27¼ inches.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">Therefore V = √772 √Λ, = 27∙78 √A, and N = O √772 √A, = O 27∙78
                √A.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">But it is also well known, that if we were to calculate the expense
                or discharge for every orifice by this simple rule,&nbsp;we should in every instance
                find it much greater than nature really gives us.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">When water issues through a hole in a thin plate, the lateral
                columns, pressing into the hole from all sides, cause&nbsp;the issuing filaments to
                converge to the axis of the jet, and&nbsp;contract its dimensions at a little
                distance from the hole.&nbsp;And it is in this place of greatest contraction that
                the water acquires that velocity which we observe in our experiments, and which we
                assume as equal to that acquired by&nbsp;falling from the surface. Therefore, that
                our computed&nbsp;discharge may best agree with observation, it must be calculated
                on the supposition that the orifice is diminished to&nbsp;the size of this smallest
                section. But the contraction is&nbsp;subject to variations, and the dimensions of
                this smallest&nbsp;section are at all times difficult to ascertain with
                precision.&nbsp;It is therefore much more convenient to compute from the&nbsp;real
                dimensions of the orifice, and to correct this computed&nbsp;discharge, by means of
                an actual comparison of the computed and effective discharges in a series of
                experiments&nbsp;made in situations resembling those cases which most frequently
                occur in practice. This correction, or its cause, in&nbsp;the mechanism of those
                internal motions, is generally called&nbsp;contraction by the writers on hydraulics
                ; and it is not&nbsp;confined to a hole in a thin plate : it happens in some degree
                in all cases where fluids are made to pass through narrow places. It happens in the
                entry into all pipes, canals,&nbsp;and sluices ; nay even into the passage of water
                over the&nbsp;edge of a board, such as is usually set up on the head of a</span></p>
