He was sufficiently acquainted with the scriptures to know, that the final desolation of Jerusalem and dispersion of the Jews had been predicted, and was a standing miracle testifying to the truth of Christianity. This he endeavoured to refute, and turn against the cause, by rebuilding the temple in more than its original splendour, and restoring the Jews to their long-lost capital. But in this daring attempt he was signally defeated. If we may credit tlle testimony of contemporaneous historians, the workmen were driven from the attempt by thunders, whirlwinds, and flames bursting from the foundations which they were vainly endeavouring to lay, till terrified by these supernatural events, they were compelled to abandon the enter-prize.</p><p>From these fruitless endeavours for the subversion of Christianity, Julian was called to take the field against the Persians, who had renewed their aggressions. Though peculiarly desirous of literary and philosophic fame, Julian was by no means destitute of military ambition. He returned a very haughty answer to the Persian ambassadors who had come to treat with him ; and set out at the head of a powerful army of skilful veterans, determined to humble the pride and the power of the Persian monarch. For some time his expedition was one continued series of brilliant achievements, till bearing down all opposition, he reached the walls of Ctesiphon. But there he found himself too far from his resources to be able to continue his operations in the siege of a place which promised no speedy conquest. To advance was impossible, to retreat highly dangerous, to remain destruction. Reluctantly he commenced a disastrous retreat, through sandy deserts, oppressed with intolerable heat, deficient in provisions for his troops, and surrounded by clouds of swift Arabian cavalry. Several sharp encounters took place, in which the Roman forces gained the advantage whenever the enemy came to close combat, but suffered dreadfully from the light skirmishing warfare which they generally waged. At length a Persian arrow pierced the unguarded breast of Julian, inflicting a wound of which he died in a few hours, after an active reign of about twenty months.</p><p>The distressed army could not be without a leader ; and after a short consultation Jovian, thc <hi rend="italic">first of the domestics, </hi>a title which conferred senatorial dignity, and a rank equal to that of the military <hi rend="italic">duces,</hi>  was proclaimed emperor ; and after some severe conflicts with the Persians, was obliged to conclude a treaty neither advantageous nor honourable to the empire, except that it was necessary for the preservation of the wreck of the army. Returning to his own dominions, he immediately revoked all the decrees issued by Julian against Christianity, and in favour of paganism, thus restoring the former to the supremacy which it had enjoyed since the time of Constantine. Before he reached Constantinople, to which he was directing his course, Jovian was found dead in his bed, having been suffocated, as was supposed, by charcoal.</p><p>After a period of ten days spent in consultation and debate, Valentinian was chosen by the imperial ministers and generals, and the army cordially ratified the choice. Soon after his elevation, Valentinian raised his brother Valens to the dignity of Augustus, and divided with him the empire, giving to Valens the eastern territories, and retaining to himself Illyricum, Italy, Gaul, Spain, Britain, and Africa. Thus were the Roman dominions once more divided into tlle eastern and western empires ; and from the time of Valentinian, they were never again thoroughly united. Valentinian established his court, not at Rome, but at Milan, being nearer the centre of his dominions ; and he was almost im</p><p>mediately engaged in hostilities with the restless and warlike tribes of the Germanic race. He made the most energetic efforts to drive back these invaders, and to maintain the extent of the empire undiminished ; a task every year more and more difficult, from the increasing torrent of invaders, and the sinking strength of the exhausted empire. Not only were the German tribes in motion, pressing into Gaul, but the tribes bordering on the Baltic were beginning those piratical depredations which made them so long the terror of the adjacent maritime countries. In Britain the Scots and Picts were overpowering the Roman province, so tllat in every quarter of the western empire, nothing was to be seen but the march and countermarch of contending armies. Theodosius, the Roman general in Britain, succeeded in defending that province from its assailants, and thus gained the friendship of the emperor. To give the appearance of greater stability to his throne, Valentinian raised his son Gratian to the rank of Cæsar, and caused him to be received by the army as his successor.</p><p>In the mean time a dangerous war arose in Africa, where the avarice and cruelty of Count Romanus, the military governor, had excited general dissatisfaction. The complaints of the injured Africans having been guilefully misrepresented to Valentinian, he punished the complainers. Despairing of redress, the people revolted, and chose Firmus, the son of a man of great wealth and influence in the country, for their leader. Romanus was quite unable to suppress this rebellion ; but Valentinian despatched the warlike Theodosius with a strong force, to reduce them to subjection. Immediately on his arrival, the aspect of affairs was changed. Firmus was defeated with great loss, and fled to a friendly tribe in the interior ; but fearing to be betrayed, he committed suicide, to avoid falling into the hands of the conqueror. Valentinian himself had in the mean time been engaged in conducting an expedition against the Quadi, and other nations on the Danube, in. which he was successful ; but died suddenly of apoplexy, near the modern city of Guntz in Hungary.</p><p>Gratian, the eldest son of Valentinian, succeeded his<hi rend="sup">, </hi>father in the western empire, and immediately associated with himself his brother Valentinian II., at that time only a youth of five years old, assigning to him Italy and Illyricum. Among the first and the worst acts of his reign, was the sanctioning the execution of Theodosius, whose brave and skilful conduct had preserved Britain, and recovered Africa. To this he was instigated by the calumnious insinuations of envious courtiers, who both hated and feared the rising merit of that gallant warrior. The reign of Valentinian, though filled with wars, had been so prosperous that it had secured for his sons a period of comparative tranquillity, more suited to their youth and inexperience. But the eastern empire had neither enjoyed equal prosperity, nor was enjoying the prospect of equal tranquillity.</p><p>Almost at the very commencement of his reign, Valens, the eastern emperor, was compelled to make preparations for a new Persian war ; and, in the midst of these preparations, was alarmed by a dangerous rebellion. This was raised by Procopius, a distant relation of Julian, whose pretensions to the throne were founded partly on his consanguinity to the former emperor, and partly on a rumour that Julian had himself secretly invested him with the purple. Procopius was at first successful ; but his haughty and cruel temper disgusting his own supporters, he was deserted by them, taken by the emperor, and put to de3th. The Persian war proceeded favourably, Sapor receiving a severe defeat, which was soon followed by a peace. But a more important event occurred, formidable not only to Valens, but also to the whole of tlle western world. This was the appearance of a new moving nation of barbarians, called Huns.
