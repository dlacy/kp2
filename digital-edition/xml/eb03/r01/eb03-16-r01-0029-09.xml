<p><label>RECOGNIZANCE</label>
in law, is an obligation of record, which a man enters into before ſome court oſ record or magiſtrate duly authoriſcd, with condition to do ſome particular act ; as to appear at the aſſizes, to keep the peace, to pay a debt, or the like. It is in moſt reſpects like another bond : the difference being chiefly this, that the bond is the creation of a freſh debt or obligation <hi rend="italic">de novo,</hi> the recognizance is an acknowledgment of a former debt upon record ; the form whereof is, " that A. B. doth acknowledge to owe to our lord the king, to the plaintiff, to C. D. or the like, the ſum of ten pounds,” with condition to be void on performance of the thing ftipulated : in which caſe the king, the plaintiff, C. D. &amp;c. is called the cognizee, <hi rend="italic">is cui cognofcitur ;</hi> as he that enters into the recognizance is called the cognizor, <hi rend="italic">is qui cognojcit.</hi> This being certified to, or taken by the officer of ſome court, is wit-neffed only by the record of that court, and not by the party’s ſeal : ſo that it is not in ſtrict propriety a deed, though the effects of it are greater than a common obligation ; being allowed a priority in point of payment, and binding the lands of the cogniaor from the time of enrolment on record.</p>
