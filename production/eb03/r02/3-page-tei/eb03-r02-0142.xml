The Samnites were the braveſt men the Romans had ever yet encountered, and the contention between the two nations was managed on both ſides with the moſt determined reſolution. But the fortune of Rome prevailed; the Samnites at length fled, averring, that they were not able to withſtand the fierce looks and the fire-darting eyes of the Romans. The other conſul, however, was not at firſt ſo fortunate; for having unwarily led his army into a defile, he was in danger of being cut off, had not Decius, a tribune of the army, poſſeſſed himſelf of an hill which commanded the enemy: ſo that the Samnites, being attacked on either ſide, were defeated with great ſlaughter, no leſs than 30, 000 of them being left dead upon the field of battle.</p><p>Some time after this victory, the ſoldiers who were ſtationed at Capua mutinying, forced Quintius, an old and eminent ſoldier, who was then reſiding in the country, to be their leader ; and, conducted by their rage more than their general, came within eight miles of the city. So terrible an enemy, almoſt at the gates, not a little alarmed the ſenate ; who immediately created Valerius Corvus dictator, and ſent him forth with another army to oppoſe them. The two armies were now drawn up againſt each other, while fathers and ſons beheld themſelves prepared to engage in oppoſite cauſes ; but Corvus, knowing his influence among the ſoldiery, inſtead of going forward to meet the mutineers in an hoſtile manner, went with the moſt cordial friendſhip to embrace and expoſtulate with his old acquaintances. His conduct had the deſired effect. Quintius, as their ſpeaker, only deſired to have their défection from their duty forgiven ; and as for himſelf, as he was innocent of their conſpiracy, he had no reaſon to ſolicit pardon for his offences.</p><p>A war between the Romans and the Latins followed ſoon after ; but as their habits, arms, and language, were the ſame, the moſt exact diſcipline was neceſſary to prevent confuſion in the engagement. Orders, therefore, were iſſued by Manlius the conſul, that no ſoldier ſhould leave his ranks upon whatever provocation ; and that he ſhould be certainly put to death who ſhould offer do do otherwiſe. With theſe injunctions, both armies were drawn out in array, and ready to begin ; when Metius, the general of the enemy’s cavalry, puſhed forward from his lines, and challenged any knight in the Roman army to ſingle combat. For ferne time there was a general pauſe, no ſoldier offering to diſobey his orders, till Titus Manlius, the conſul’s own ſon, burning with ſhame to ſee the whole body of the Romans intimidated, boldly iallied out againſt his adverſary. The ſoldiers on both ſides for a while ſuſpended the general engagement to be ſpectators of this fierce encounter. Manlius killed his adverſary ; and then deſpoiling him of his armour, returned in triumph to his father’s tent, where he was preparing and giving orders relative to the engagement. Howſoever he might have been applauded by his fellow-ſoldiers, being as yet doubtful of the reception he ſhould find from his father, he came, with heſitation, to lay the enemy’s ſpoils at his feet, and with a modeſt air inſinuated, that what he did was entirely from a ſpirit of hereditary virtue. But he was ſoon dreadfully made ſenſible of his error, when his father, turning away, ordered him to be led publicly forth before the army, and there to</p><p>have his head ſtruck off on account of his diſobeying orders. The whole army was ſtruck with horror at this unnatural mandate : fear for a while kept them in ſuſpenſe ; but when they ſaw their young champion’s head ſtruck off, and his blood ſtreaming upon the ground, they could no longer contain their execrations ' and their groans. His dead body was carried forth without the camp, and being ‘adorned with the ſpoils of the vanquiſhed enemy, was buried with all the pomp of military diſtreſs.</p><p>In the mean time, the battle joined with mutual fury ; and as the two armies had oſten fought under the ſame leaders, they combated with all the animo-ſity of a civil war. The Latins chiefly depended on their bodily ſtrength ; the Romans, on their invincible courage and conduct. Forces ſo nearly matched ſeemed only to require the protection of their deities to turn the ſcale of victory ; and, in fact, the augurs had foretold, that whatever part of the Roman army ſhould be diſtreſſed, the commander of that part ſhould devote himſelf for his country, and die as a ſacriſice to the immortal gods. Manlius commanded the right wing, and Decius led on the left. Both ſides fought for ſome time with doubtful ſucceſs, as their courage was equal ; but, after a time, the leſt wing of the Roman army began to give ground. It was then that Decius, who commanded there, reſolved to devote himſelf for his country, and to offer his own life as an atonement to ſave his army. Thus determined, he called out to Manlius With a loud voice, and demanded his inſtructions, as he was the chief pontiff, how to devote himſelf, and the form of the words he ſhould uſe. By his directions, therefore, being clothed in a long robe, his head covered, and his arms ſtretched forward, ſtanding upon a javelin, he devoted himſelf to the celeſtial and infernal gods for the ſafety of Rome. Then arming himſelf, and mounting on horſeback, he drove furiouſly into the midſt of the enemy, carrying terror and conſternation wherever he came, till he ſell covered with wounds. In the mean time, the Roman army conſidered his devoting himſelf in this manner as an aſſurance of ſucceſs ; nor was the ſuperſtition of the Latins leſs powerfully influenced by his reſolution ; a total rout began to enſue : the Romans preſſed them on every ſide ; and ſo great was the carnage, that ſcarce a fourth part of the enemy ſurvived the defeat. This was the laſt battle of any conſequence that the Latins had with the Romans : they were forced to beg a peace upon hard conditions ; and two years after, their ſtrongeſt city, Pædum, being taken, they were brought under an entire ſubmiſſion to the Roman power.</p><p>A ſignal diſgrace which the Romans ſuſtained about this time in their conteſt with the Samnites, made a pauſe in their uſual good fortune, and turned the ſcale for a while in the enemy’s favour. The ſenate having denied the Samnites peace, Pontius their general was reſolved to gain by ſtratagem what he had frequently loſt by force. Accordingly, leading his army into a defile called <hi rend="italic">Claudium,</hi>  and taking poſſeſſion of all its outlets, he ſent 10 of his ſoldiers, habited like ſhepherds, with directions to throw themſelves in the way the Romans were to march. The Roman conſul met them, and taking them for what the) appeared, demanded the route the Samnite army had taken ; they,, with ſeeming indifference, replied, that they were gone to Luceria, a</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
