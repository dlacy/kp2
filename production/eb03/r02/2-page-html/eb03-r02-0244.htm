<p><span class="font0">ject. The fame principles of mutual preſſure and equilibrium have a place in roofs and many wooden edifices; and if they had been as much ſtudied as the Normans&nbsp;and Saracens ſeem to have ſtudied ſuch of them as were&nbsp;applicable to their purpoſes, we might have produced&nbsp;wooden buildings as ſar ſuperior to what we are familiarly acquainted with, as the bold and wonderful&nbsp;churches ſtill remaining in Europe are ſuperior to the&nbsp;timid productions of our ſtone architecture. The cein-tres uſed in building the bridge of Orleans and the&nbsp;corn-market ⅜f Paris, are late inſtances of what may&nbsp;be done in this way. The laſt mentioned is a dome of&nbsp;200 feet diameter, built of fir planks ; and there is not&nbsp;a piece of timber in it more than nine feet long, a foot&nbsp;broad, and three inches thick.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Norman architects frequently roofed with ſtone. Their wooden roofs were in general very fimple, and&nbsp;their profeſſed aim was to diſpenſe with them altogether. Fond of their own ſcience, they copied nothing&nbsp;from a wooden building, and ran into a ſimilar fault&nbsp;with the ancient Greeks. The parts of their buildings&nbsp;which were neceſſarily of timber were made to imitate&nbsp;ſtone-buildings; and Gothic ornament conſiſts in cramming every thing full of arches and ſpaundrels. Nothing elſe is to be ſeen in their timber works, nay even&nbsp;in their ſculpture. Took at any of the maces or&nbsp;ſceptres ſtill to be found about the old cathedrals; they&nbsp;are ſilver ſteeples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But there appears to have been a rivalſhip in old times between the maſons and the carpenters. Many&nbsp;of the baronial halls are of prodigious width, and are&nbsp;roofed with timber : and the carpenters appeared to&nbsp;have borrowed much knowledge from the maſons of&nbsp;thoſe times, and their wide roofs are frequently conſtructed with great ingenuity. Their aim, like the maſons, was to throw a roof over a very wide building&nbsp;without employing great logs of timber. We have ſeen&nbsp;roofs 6o ſeet wide, without having a piece of timber in&nbsp;it above io ſeet long and 4 inches ſquare. The Parliament Houſe and Tron-Church of Edinburgh, the&nbsp;great hall of Tarnaway caſtle near Elgin, are ſpecimens&nbsp;of thoſe roofs. They are very numerous on the continent. Indeed Britain retains few monuments of private&nbsp;magnificence. Ariſtocratic ſtate never was ſo great&nbsp;with us ; and the rancour of our civil wars gave moſt&nbsp;of the performances of the carpenter to the flames.&nbsp;Weſtminſter-hall exhibits a ſpecimen of the falſe taſte&nbsp;of the Norman roofs. It contains the eſſential parts indeed, very properly diſpoſed ; but they are hidden, or&nbsp;intentionally covered, with what is conceived to be ornamental ; and this is an imitation of ſtone arches, crammed in between ſlender pillars which hang down from&nbsp;the principal frames, truſſes, or rafters. In a pure Norman roof, ſuch as Tarnaway hall, the eſſential parts are&nbsp;exhibited as things underſtood, and therefore reliſhed.&nbsp;They are refined and ornamented ; and it is here that&nbsp;the inferior kind of taſte or the want of it may appear.&nbsp;And here we do not mean to defend all the whims of&nbsp;our anceſtors ; but we aſſert that it is no more neceſſary&nbsp;to conſider the members of a roof as things to be concealed like a ganet or privy, than the members of a&nbsp;ceiling, which form the moſt beautiſul part of the&nbsp;Greek architecture. Should it be ſaid that a roof is&nbsp;only a thing to keep off the rain, it may be anſwered,</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">that a ceiling is only to keep off the duſt, or the floor to be trodden underfoot, and that we ſhould have neither copartments in the one nor inlaid work or carpets&nbsp;on the other. The ſtructure of a roof may therefore&nbsp;be exhibited with propriety, and made an ornamental&nbsp;feature. This has been done even in Italy. The church&nbsp;of St Maria Maggiore in Rome and ſeveral others are&nbsp;ſpecimens: but it muſt be acknowledged, that the forms&nbsp;of the principal ſrames of theſe roofs, which reſemble&nbsp;thoſe of our modern buildings, are very unfit for agreeable ornament. As we have already obſerved, our imaginations have not been made ſufficiently familiar with the&nbsp;principles, and we are rather alarmed than pleaſed with&nbsp;the appearance of the immenſe logs of timber which&nbsp;form the couples of theſe roofs, and hang over our&nbsp;heads with every appearance of weight and danger. It&nbsp;is quite otherwiſe with the ingenious roofs of the German and Norman architects. Slender timbers, interlaced with great ſymmetry, and thrown by neceſſity into figures which are naturally pretty, form altogether&nbsp;an object which no carpenter can view without pleaſure. And why ſhould the gentleman refuſe himſelf&nbsp;the ſame pleaſure of beholding ſcientific ingenuity ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The roof is in fact the part of the building which requires the greateſt degree of fl∙cill, and where ſcience&nbsp;will be of more ſervice than in any other part. The&nbsp;architect ſeldom knows much of the matter, and leaves&nbsp;the taſlc to the carpenter. The carpenter conſiders the&nbsp;framing of a great roof as the touchſtone of his art; and&nbsp;nothing indeed tends ſo much to ſhow his judgment and&nbsp;his fertility of reſource.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It muſt therefore be very acceptable to the artiſt to have a clear view of the principles by which this difficult problem may be folved in the beſt manner, ſo that&nbsp;the roof may have all the ſtrength and ſecurity that&nbsp;can be wiſhed for, without an extravagant expence of&nbsp;timber and iron. We have ſaid that mechanical ſcience&nbsp;can give great aſſiſtance in this matter. We may add&nbsp;that the framing of carpentry, whether for roofs, floors,&nbsp;or any other purpoſe, affords one of the moſt elegant&nbsp;and moſt ſatisfactory applications which can be made&nbsp;of mechanical ſcience to the arts&gt;of common liſe. Unfortunately the practical artiſt is ſeldom poſſefl'ed even&nbsp;of the ſmall portion of ſcience which would almoſt inſure his practice from all riſh of failure ; and even our&nbsp;moſt experienced carpenters have ſeldom any more&nbsp;knowledge than what ariſes from their experience and&nbsp;natural ſagacity. The moſt approved author in our&nbsp;language is Price in his Britiſh Carpenter. Mathurin&nbsp;Jouſſe is in like manner the author moſt in repute in&nbsp;France ; and the publications of both theſe authors are&nbsp;void of every appearance of principle. It is not uncommon to ſee the works of carpenters of the greateſt&nbsp;reputation tumble down., in conſequence of miſtakes from&nbsp;which the moſt elementary knowledge would have ſaved&nbsp;them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We ſhall attempt, in this artide, to give an account of the leading principles of this art in a manner ſo familiar and palpâble, that any perſon who know<sup>,</sup>sthecommon&nbsp;properties of the lever, and<sup>x</sup>the Oompoſition of motion,&nbsp;ſhall ſo far underſtand them as to be able, on every occaſion, ſo to diſpoſe his materials, with reſpect to the&nbsp;ſtrains to which they are to be expoſed, that he ſhall&nbsp;always know the effective ſtrain on every piece, and</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
