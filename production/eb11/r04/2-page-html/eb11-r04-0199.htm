<p><span class="font0">the United States, in return for a commercial and military protection advantageous to Panama, the right to build a canal and control it in perpetuity. His critics said that his course in this&nbsp;matter was unconstitutional, although the question of constitutionality has never been raised before any national or international&nbsp;tribunal. The fact remains that the construction of the Panama&nbsp;Canal was undertaken to the practical satisfaction to the civilized&nbsp;world. But for Mr Roosevelt’s vigorous official action, and his&nbsp;characteristic ability to inspire associates with enthusiasm the&nbsp;canal would still be a subject of diplomatic discussion instead of&nbsp;a physical actuality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Colonial Policy.—</span><span class="font0">Strictly speaking, the United States has no colonial policy,.for the Philippine Islands and Porto Rico can scarcely&nbsp;be called colonies. It has, however, a policy of territorial expansion.&nbsp;Although this policy was entered upon at the conclusion of the&nbsp;Spanish War under the presidency of Mr McKinley it has been very&nbsp;largely shaped by Mr Roosevelt. He determined that Cuba should&nbsp;not be taken over by the United States, as all Europe expected&nbsp;it would be, and an influential section of his own party hoped it&nbsp;would be, but should be given every opportunity. to govern&nbsp;itself as an independent republic; by assuming supervision.of the&nbsp;finances of San Domingo, he put an end to controversies in that&nbsp;unstable republic, which, threatened to disturb the peace of Europe;&nbsp;and he personally inspired the body of administrative officials in&nbsp;the Philippines, in Porto Rico and (during American occupancy)&nbsp;in Cuba, who for efficiency and unselfish devotion to duty compare&nbsp;favourably with any similar body in the. world. In numerous&nbsp;speeches and addresses he expressed his belief in a strong colonial&nbsp;government, but a government administered for the benefit of the&nbsp;people under its control and not for the profit of the people at home.&nbsp;In this respect, for the seven years of his administration at Washington, he developed a policy of statesmanship quite new in the history&nbsp;of the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">No account of Mr Roosevelt's career is complete without a reference to his literary work, which has been somewhat&nbsp;overshadowed by his reputation as a man of public affairs.&nbsp;He was all his life an omnivorous reader of the best&nbsp;books in very varied fields of literature, and he developed to&nbsp;an unusual degree the faculty of digesting and remembering&nbsp;what he has read. His history of the War of 1812 between the&nbsp;United States and Great Britain, written when he was twenty-four years old, is still the standard history of that conflict,&nbsp;and his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Winning of the West</span><span class="font0"> is probably the best work which&nbsp;has been written on American frontier life of the 19th century,&nbsp;a life that developed certain fundamental and distinctive American social and political traits. His </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">African Game Trails,</span><span class="font0"> the&nbsp;record of his scientific hunting expedition in Africa in 1909-10,&nbsp;is much more than a narrative of adventures on a wild&nbsp;continent. It is a study of social and ethnological conditions,&nbsp;and contains many passages of literary charm, describing bird&nbsp;life, animal life and natural scenery. An appendix that&nbsp;gives some account of the “ Pigskin Library ” which he carried&nbsp;with him for daily reading in the heart of Africa is a surprising&nbsp;exposition of the wide range of his reading. As a public speaker&nbsp;his style was incisive, forceful and often éloquent, although&nbsp;he made no effort to practise oratory as an art. The volume&nbsp;of his African and European addresses, published in the autumn&nbsp;of 1910, not only presents an epitome of his political philosophy,&nbsp;but discloses the wide range of his interest in life and the&nbsp;methods by which he had striven to bring public opinion to&nbsp;his point of view.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Personally of great physical and mental vigour, his work was done at high pressure and he had the faculty of inspiring his&nbsp;colleagues or his subordinates with his own enthusiasm for&nbsp;doing things. The volume of his letters and his writings in&nbsp;books, articles for the press and speeches and official'messages,&nbsp;is enormous, and yet this work was done in the midst of the&nbsp;executive labours of a long political career. Besides being&nbsp;famous as a hunter of big game, he was a skilful horseman and&nbsp;a good tennis player. Regular physical exercise in the open&nbsp;air contributed much to his abounding vitality. A man of&nbsp;decisive action when his mind was made up on any given&nbsp;question, his very decisiveness sometimes gave the impression&nbsp;that his judgments were hasty. On the contrary, few men&nbsp;were more deliberate in considering all sides of an important&nbsp;problem. His long experience, his wide reading and his&nbsp;thorough knowledge of all sorts and conditions of men, enabled&nbsp;him to act quickly at a time of crisis, but his important speeches,&nbsp;or a course of political action that might be far-rcaching in its&nbsp;effect, were not cast into their final form without careful consultation with the best advisers he could obtain. The first&nbsp;form of his written speeches was always painstakingly edited&nbsp;and revised, and not infrequently entirely rewritten. He expressed his own judgment of his success as a public man by saying that it was not due to any special gifts or genius, but to the&nbsp;fact that by patience and laborious persistence he had developed&nbsp;ordinary qualities to a more than ordinary degree.

He graduated at&nbsp;Hamilton College in 1864, taught at the Rome (N.Y.) Academy&nbsp;in 1865, and graduated at the University Law School, New&nbsp;York City, in 1867. As a corporation lawyer he soon attained&nbsp;high rank and was counsel in many famous cases. Politically,&nbsp;he became identified with the reform element of the Republican&nbsp;party. He was United States attorney for the Southern&nbsp;District of New York (1883-85), and a delegate to the State&nbsp;Constitutional Convention of 1894, acting as chairman of its&nbsp;judiciary committee. From August 1899 until February 1904&nbsp;he was secretary of war in the cabinets of Presidents McKinley&nbsp;and Roosevelt, and in this position reorganized the army and&nbsp;created a general staff, and in general administered his department with great ability during a period marked by the Boxer&nbsp;uprising in China, whither troops were sent under General A.
