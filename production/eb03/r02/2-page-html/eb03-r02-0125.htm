<p><span class="font0">tins made vaſt preparations, as did likewiſe the Romans; but the latter could procure no aſſiſtance from their&nbsp;neighbours. As the Latin nation was much ſuperior&nbsp;to them in ſtrength, they ſent deputies to ſolicit ſuc-cours from the ſeveral ſtates with which they were ſurrounded : but their negociations proved every where&nbsp;unſucceſsful; and, what was worſe than all, the republic&nbsp;had rebellious ſons in her own boſom, who refuſed to&nbsp;lend their aid in defence of their country. The poorer&nbsp;fort of people, and the debtors, refuſed to take the military oaths, or to ſerve ; alleging their poverty, and the&nbsp;fruitleſs hazards they ran in fighting for the defence of&nbsp;a city, where they were oppreſſed and enilaved by their&nbsp;creditors. This ſpirit of mutiny ſpread among the inferior claſſes, moſt of them refuſing to liſt themſelves,&nbsp;unleſs their debts were all remitted by a decree of the&nbsp;ſenate ; nay, they began to talk of leaving the city, and&nbsp;ſettling elſewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The ſenate, apprehending a general inſurrection, aſſembled to deliberate on the means of quieting thoſe domeſtic troubles. Some were for a free remiſſion of&nbsp;all debts, as the ſafeſt expedient at that juncture; others&nbsp;urged the dangerous conſequences of ſuch a condeſcen-ſion, adviſing them to liſt ſuch only as were willing to&nbsp;ſerve, not doubting but thoſe who refuſed their aſſiſtance would offer it of their own accord when it was&nbsp;no longer deſired. Several other expedients were propoſed : but at length this prevailed ; to wit, that all&nbsp;actions for debts ſhould be ſuſpended till the conclulion&nbsp;of the war with the Latins. But this the indigent&nbsp;debtors thought only a ſuſpenſion of their miſery ; and&nbsp;therefore it had not the intended effect on the minds&nbsp;of the unruly multitude. The ſenate might indeed&nbsp;have proſecuted the ringleaders of the ſedition ; but&nbsp;the law of Poplicola, called the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Palerian law,</span><span class="font0"> which&nbsp;allowed appeals to the aſſembly of the people, was a&nbsp;protection ſor the ſeditious, who were ſure of being&nbsp;acquitted by the accomplices of their rebellion. The&nbsp;ſenate, therefore, to elude the effect of a privilege that&nbsp;put ſuch a reſtraint upon their power, reſolved to create&nbsp;one ſupreme magiſtrate, who, with the title of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">di8ator,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">ſhould have an abſolute power for a time : but as this&nbsp;could not be done without ſtriking at the law of Poplicola, and transferring the power of the people in criminal caſes to a magiſtrate ſuperior to all laws, it was,&nbsp;neceſſary to uſe artifice, in order to obtain the conſent&nbsp;of the curiæ. They therefore repreſented to them in&nbsp;a public aſſembly, that, in ſo difficult a conjuncture,&nbsp;when they had their domeſtic quarrels to decide, and&nbsp;at the ſame time a powerful enemy to repulſe, it would&nbsp;be expedient to put the commonwealth under a lingle&nbsp;governor, who, ſuperior to the conſuls themſelves, ſhould&nbsp;be the arbiter of the laws, and as it were the father&nbsp;of his country ; that his power ſhould have no limits :&nbsp;but, however, leſt he ſhould abuſe it, they ought not&nbsp;to truſt him with it above ſix months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The people, not foreſeeing the conſequences of this change, agreed to it ; but the greateſt difficulty was to&nbsp;find a man duly qualified in all reſpects for ſo great a&nbsp;truſt. T. Lartius, one of the conſuls, ſeemed to be&nbsp;of all men the moſt unexceptionable ; but the ſenate,&nbsp;fearing to offend his colleague by an invidious preference, gave the conſuls the power of chooſing a dictator, and obliged them to name one of themſelves, not&nbsp;doubting but Clœlius would yield to the ſuperior talents of his colleague ; nor were they diſappointed in&nbsp;their expectations. But Lartius, with the ſame readi-neſs, named Cloelius ; and the only contcſt was, which&nbsp;of the two ſhould raiſe the other to the ſupreme authority. Each perſiſted obſtinately in remitting the dignity to his colleague, till Cloelius, ſtarting up on a hidden, abdicated the conſulſhip, and, after the manner&nbsp;of an interrex, proclaimed Titus Lartius dictator, who&nbsp;thereupon was obliged to take upon him the government&nbsp;of the republic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Lartius indeed took as much ſtate upon him, after he had entered upon his office, as he had ſhown mo-deſty in refuſing it. He began by creating, without&nbsp;the participation either of the ſenate or people, a general of the Roman horſe ; an office which laſted only&nbsp;during the dictatorſhip, and which all ſubſequent dictators revived immediately after their election. Sp.&nbsp;Caſſius, formerly conſul, and honoured with a triumph,&nbsp;was the perſon he advanced to this ſecond ſtation in the&nbsp;republic. Lartius, having by this means ſecured the&nbsp;Roman knights, reſolved, in the next place, to make&nbsp;the people reſpect and fear him. With this view he&nbsp;never appeared in public, without being attended by&nbsp;24 lictors, to whoſe faſees he again added the axes&nbsp;which Poplicola had cauſed to be taken from them.&nbsp;The novelty of this fight was alone ſufficient to awe&nbsp;the ſeditious, and, without executions, to ſpread con-ſternation throughout Rome. The murmurs of the inferior claſſes being by this means ſilenced, the dictator&nbsp;commanded a cenſus to be taken, according to the in-ſtitution of King Servius. Every one, without exception, brought in his name, age, the particulars of his&nbsp;eſtate, &amp;c. and there appeared to be in Rome x 50,700&nbsp;men who were paſt the age of puberty. Out of theſe&nbsp;the dictator formed four armies : the firſt he commanded himſelf; the ſecond he gave to Clœlius his late colleague; the third to Sp. Caſſius his general of the horſe;&nbsp;and the fourth he left in Rome, under the command&nbsp;of his brother Sp. Lartius, who was to guard the city.&nbsp;The Latins not being ſo forward in their preparations&nbsp;as was expected, all their hoſtilities againſt Rome this&nbsp;campaign amounted to no more than the ſending a detachment into the Roman territory to lay it waſte. The&nbsp;dictator gained ſome advantage over that party ; and&nbsp;the great humanity with which he treated the priſoners and woμnded, diſpoſed the Latins to liſten the more&nbsp;readily to the overtures which he at the ſame time made&nbsp;them for a ſuſpenſion of hoſtilities. At length a truce&nbsp;was agreed on for a year ; and then Lartius, feeing&nbsp;the republic reſtored to its former tranquillity, reſigned&nbsp;the dictatorſhip, though the time appointed for its duration was not yet expired.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The following conſulſhip of Sempronius Atratinus and Mimιtius Angurinus, produced nothing memorable. But the next year the truce expired, when&nbsp;Aulus Poſthumius and T. Virginius took poſſeſſion of&nbsp;the conſulſhip. Both Romans and Latins were buſied&nbsp;in making the neceſſary preparations for war. The&nbsp;nobility of Latium, who were ſor the moſt part in the&nbsp;intereſt of the Tarquins, having found means to exclude the citizens from the Latin diets, carried all&nbsp;before them in thoſe aſſemblies : whereupon many of&nbsp;the citizens removed with their families to Rome, where&nbsp;they were well received. The Latins being bent, upon war, the ſenate, notwithſtanding the perfect har-</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
