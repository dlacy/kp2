<p><label>REEL</label>
(O.E. <hi rend="italic">hréol,</hi> glossed by the Med. Lat. a <hi rend="italic">librum</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Aelfric's Glossary, c.</hi> 1050; the word is of unknown origin; it does not appear in cognate languages, and Celtic forms such as Gaelic <hi rend="italic">ruidhü</hi> are from English), a cylinder or apparatus of cylindrical shape on which a thread or line can be wound; <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi> the small wooden cylinder with projecting rims at either end on which sewing cotton or silk is wound for immediate use, the revolving “ click-reel ” attached to a fishing-rod, and the open revolving framework on which thread is wound as it is spun. The name of the Scottish dance (Gaelic <hi rend="italic">righil, ruithil)</hi> is probably the same word (see Dance). In architecture, an ornamental moulding consisting of spherical-shaped bodies alternating with flat reel-shaped disks placed on edge is known</p><p>as a “bead and reel” moulding.</p>
