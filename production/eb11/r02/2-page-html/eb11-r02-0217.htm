<p><span class="font0">“ highest activity of the soul.” Marcus Aurelius was his constant companion. There exists at Grote Schuur a copy of&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Meditations</span><span class="font0"> deeply scored with Mr Rhodes’s marks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">During this Oxford time, and on to 1881, Mr Rhodes was occupied with the amalgamation of the larger number of the&nbsp;diamond mines of Kimberley with the Dc Beers Company, an&nbsp;operation which established his position as a practical financier&nbsp;and gave him an important connexion and following in the&nbsp;business world. To many admirers who shared his ideas on&nbsp;public questions his connexion with the financial world and his&nbsp;practical success were a stumbling-block. It was often wished&nbsp;for him that he had “ kept himself clear of all that.” But this&nbsp;was not his own view. His ideals were political and practical.&nbsp;To him the making of money was a necessary preliminary to&nbsp;their realization, and he was proud of his practical ability in&nbsp;this direction. He was personally a man of most simple tastes.&nbsp;His immense fortune was spent in the execution of his ideals,&nbsp;and it has been justly said of him that he taught the world a&nbsp;new chapter of the romance of wealth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In X881 Mr Rhodes entered public life as a member of the Cape assembly. It was the year of the Majuba settlement.&nbsp;South Africa was convulsed with questions which had arisen&nbsp;between the British and the Dutch, and leaders of Dutch&nbsp;opinion at the Cape ventured to speak openly of the formation&nbsp;of a United States of South Africa under its own flag. The&nbsp;British party needed a rallying-ground, and Mr Rhodes took&nbsp;his stand on a policy of local union combined with the consolidation and expansion of Imperial interests. He offered to Dutch&nbsp;and British alike the ideal of a South African Federation&nbsp;governing itself within the empire, and extending, by its gradual&nbsp;absorption of native territories, the range of Imperial administration. Local self-government was, in his opinion, the only enduring basis on which the unity of the empire could be built, and&nbsp;throughout his life he was as keen a defender of local rights as&nbsp;he was of Imperial unity. There was a period somewhat later&nbsp;in his career when this attitude on his part gave rise to a good&nbsp;deal of misapprehension, and his advocacy of the elimination of&nbsp;direct Imperial interference in local affairs caused him to be&nbsp;viewed in certain quarters with suspicion as a Separatist and&nbsp;Independent. Those who were inclined to take this view were&nbsp;greatly strengthened in their suspicions by the fact that at&nbsp;a critical moment in the struggle for Home Rule in Ireland&nbsp;Mr Rhodes contributed £10,000 to the funds of the Separatist&nbsp;party. The subsequent publication of his correspondence on&nbsp;the subject with Mr Parnell, who was at that time leading the&nbsp;Home Rule party, demonstrated, however, the essential fact&nbsp;that, whatever might have been the secret intentions of the&nbsp;extreme Irish Home Rulers, Mr Rhodes’s contribution was made&nbsp;strictly subject to the retention of the Irish members at Westminster. He remained of the opinion that the Home Rule&nbsp;movement, wisely treated, would have had a consolidating and&nbsp;not a disruptive effect upon the organization of the empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In South Africa the influence which he acquired over the local independents and over the Dutch vote was subsequently&nbsp;an important factor in enabling him to carry out the scheme&nbsp;of northern expansion which he had at heart, and which he had&nbsp;fully developed in his own mind at Oxford in 1878. In 1881&nbsp;the Bechuana territory was a sort of no man’s land through&nbsp;which ran the trade routes to the north. It was evident that&nbsp;any power which commanded the trade routes would command&nbsp;the unknown northern territory beyond. The Pretoria Convention of 1881 limited the westward extension of the Transvaal&nbsp;to a line east of the trade routes. Nevertheless, the reconstituted&nbsp;republic showed itself anxious to encroach by irregular overflow&nbsp;into native territories, and Mr Rhodes feared to sec the extension&nbsp;of the British colonies permanently blocked by Dutch occupation.&nbsp;One of his first acts as a member of the Cape assembly was to&nbsp;urge the appointment of a delimitation commission. He served&nbsp;in person on the commission, and obtained from the chief&nbsp;Mankoroane, who claimed about half of Bechuanaland, a formal&nbsp;cession of his territories to the British government of the Cape.&nbsp;The Cape government refused to accept the offer. In February&nbsp;1884 a second convention signed in London again defined the&nbsp;western frontier of the Transvaal, Bcchuanaland being left&nbsp;outside the republic. With the consent of Great Britain,&nbsp;Germany had occupied, almost at the same time, the territory&nbsp;on the Atlantic coast now known as German South-West Africa.&nbsp;In August 1884 Mr Rhodes was appointed resident deputy&nbsp;commissioner in Bechuanaland, where, notwithstanding the&nbsp;conventions to the contrary, Bocrs had ousted the natives from&nbsp;considerable areas and set up the so-called republics of Goshen&nbsp;and Stellaland. An old Dutchman who knew the value of the&nbsp;position said privately to Mr Rhodes, “ This is the key of South&nbsp;Africa.” The question at issue was whether Great Britain or&nbsp;the Transvaal was to hold the key. It was a question about&nbsp;which at that time the British public knew nothing and cared&nbsp;nothing. Mr Rhodes made it his business to enlighten them.&nbsp;President Kruger, speaking for the government of the Transvaal,&nbsp;professed to regard the Dutch commandoes as freebooters, and&nbsp;to be unable to control them. It devolved upon Great Britain&nbsp;to oblige them to evacuate the territory. ,Largely as the result&nbsp;of Mr Rhodes’s exertions the necessary step was taken. The&nbsp;Warren expedition of 1884-85 was sent out. In the presence of&nbsp;British* troops upon the frontier President Kruger recovered&nbsp;his controlling power over the Transvaal burghers, and without&nbsp;any fighting the commandoes were withdrawn. Thereupon&nbsp;southern Bechuanaland was declared to be British territory,&nbsp;while a British protectorate was declared over the northern&nbsp;regions up to the 22nd parallel (September 1885).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It was the first round in the long duel fought on the field of South Africa between Mr Rhodes, as the representative of&nbsp;British interests, and President Kruger, as the head of the&nbsp;militant Dutch party. The score on this occasion was to Mr&nbsp;Rhodes, and the entrance to the interior was secured. But the&nbsp;22nd parallel was far short of the limits to which Mr Rhodes&nbsp;hoped to SeeBritishinfluence extend, and he feared lest Germany&nbsp;and the Transvaal might yet join hands in the native territory&nbsp;beyond, and bar his farther progress towards the north. The&nbsp;discovery of gold on the Witwatersrand in 1886, by adding to&nbsp;the wealth and importance of the Transvaal, gave substance&nbsp;to this fear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The territory to the north of the 22nd parallel was at that time under the domination of Lobengula, chief of the Matabele,&nbsp;a native potentate celebrated alike for his ability and for&nbsp;the despotic character of his rule. There were rumours of&nbsp;Dutch and German emissaries at the kraal of Lobengula,&nbsp;engaged in persuading that chief to cede certain portions of&nbsp;his territory. Portugal also was putting forward shadowy&nbsp;claims to the country. It was in these circumstances that&nbsp;Mr Rhodes conceived the idea of forming a British Chartered&nbsp;Company, which should occupy the territory for trading and&nbsp;mining purposes as far as the Zambezi, and bring the whole&nbsp;under the protection of Great Britain. The idea took shape-in 1887, in which year Mr Rhodes’s first emissaries were sent&nbsp;to Lobengula. The charter of the British South Africa Company&nbsp;was granted in October 1889. Betwecn the two dates his&nbsp;conception of the possibilities to be achieved by the Company-had expanded. Mr Rhodes no longer limited the sphere of his&nbsp;operations to the Zambezi, but, crossing the river at the back&nbsp;of the Portuguese settlements at its mouth, he obtained permission to extend the territories of the Chartered Company to&nbsp;the southern end of Lake Tanganyika, including within the&nbsp;sphere of its operations the British settlements already made&nbsp;in Nyasaland. He hoped to go farther still, and to create a&nbsp;connected chain of British possessions through the continent&nbsp;which m<sup>:</sup>ght eventually justify the description,“ Africa British&nbsp;from the Cape to Cairo.” The treaty negotiated between&nbsp;Great Britain and Germany in 1890 extended the German sphere&nbsp;of influence from the East Coast to the frontier of the Congo&nbsp;Free State, and defeated this hope. But Mr Rhodes did not&nbsp;wholly renounce the idea. In 1892, when the question of the&nbsp;retention or abandonment of Uganda hung in the balance at&nbsp;home, he threw all the weight of his influence into the scale of&nbsp;retention, and undertook at his own personal expense to connect</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
