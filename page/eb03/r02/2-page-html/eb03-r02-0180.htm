<p><span class="font1">rteers were headed by one PercenιuuS, a common ſoldier ; who, before he ſerved in the army, had made it his whole buſineſs to form parties in the theatres and&nbsp;play houſes to hiſs or applaud ſuch actors as he liked or&nbsp;diſliked. Inflamed by the ſpeeches of this man, they&nbsp;openly revolted ; and though Tiberius himſelf wrote to&nbsp;them, and lent his ſon Druſus to endeavour to quell the&nbsp;tumult, they maſſacred ſome of their officers, and inſulted others, till at laſt, being frightened by an eclipſe of&nbsp;the moon, they began to ſhow ſome ſigns of repentance.&nbsp;Of this favourable diſpofιtion Druſus took advantage ;&nbsp;and even got the ringleaders of the revolt condemned&nbsp;and executed. Immediately after this they were again&nbsp;terrified by ſuch violent ſtorms and dreadful rains, that&nbsp;they quietly ſubmitted, and every thing in that quarter&nbsp;was reſtored to tranquillity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The revolt of the German legions threatened much more danger, as they were more numerous than thoſe&nbsp;of Pannonia. They proceeded nearly in the ſame way&nbsp;as the Pannonian legions, falling upon their officers,&nbsp;eſpecially the centurions, and beating them till they&nbsp;almoſt expired, drove them out of the camp, and&nbsp;ſome of them were even thrown into the Rhine. Germanicus, who was at that time in Gaul, haſtened to&nbsp;the camp on the firſt news of the diſturbance ; but being&nbsp;unable to prevail on them to return to their duty, he&nbsp;was obliged to feign letters from Tiberius, granting all&nbsp;their demands. Theſe werc, That all thoſe who had&nbsp;ſerved 20 years ſhould be diſeharged 5 that ſuch as had&nbsp;ſerved 16 ſhould be deemed veterans; and that ſome&nbsp;legacies which had been left them by Auguſtus ſhoiild&nbsp;not only be paid immediately, but doubled. This laſt&nbsp;article he was obliged to diſcharge without delay out&nbsp;of the money which he and hi3 friends had brought to&nbsp;defray the expences of their journey ; and on receiving&nbsp;it, the troops quietly retired to their winter-quarters.&nbsp;But, in the mean time, ſome deputies ſent either by&nbsp;Tiberius or the ſenate, probably to quell the ſedition,&nbsp;occaſioned freſh diſturbances ; for the legionaries, taking it into their heads that theſe deputies were come&nbsp;to revoke the conceſſions which Germanicus had made,&nbsp;were with difficulty prevented from tearing them in&nbsp;pieces ; and, notwithſtanding the utmoſt endeavours of&nbsp;Germanicus, behaved in ſuch an outrageous manner,&nbsp;that the general thought proper to ſend off his wiſe A-grippina, with her infant ſon Claudius, ſhe herſelf at&nbsp;the ſame being big with child. As ihe was attended&nbsp;by many women of diſtinction, wives of the chief officers in the camp, their tears and lamentations in parting with their huſhands occaſioned a great uproar, and&nbsp;drew together the ſoldiers from all quarters. A new&nbsp;ſcene enſued, which made an impreſſion even upon the&nbsp;moſt obſtinate. They could not behold, without ſhame&nbsp;and compaſſion, ſo many women of rank travelling thus&nbsp;forlorn, without a centurion to attend them, or a ſoldier to guard them ; and their general’s wiſe among the&nbsp;teſt, carrying her infant child in her arms, and preparing&nbsp;to fly ſor ſhelter againſt the treachery of the Roman&nbsp;legions. This made ſuch a deep impreſſion on the&nbsp;minds of many of them, that ſome ran to ſtop her,&nbsp;while the reſt recurred to Germanicus, earneſtly in-treating him to recall his wiſe, and to prevent her from&nbsp;being obliged to ſeek a ſanctuary among foreigners.&nbsp;The general improved this favourable diſpoſition, and&nbsp;in a ſhort time they of their own accord ſeized and&nbsp;maſſacred the ringleaders of the revolt. Still, however, two of the legions continued in their difobedi-ence. Againſt them therefore Germanicus determined&nbsp;to lead thoſe who had returned to their duty. With&nbsp;this view he prepared veſſels ; but before he embarked&nbsp;his troops, he wrote a letter to Cagcina who commanded them, acquainting him that he approached&nbsp;with a powerful army, reſolved to put them all to the&nbsp;ſword without diſtinction, if they did not prevent him&nbsp;by taking vengeance on the guilty themſelves. This&nbsp;letter Caecina communicated only to the chief officers&nbsp;and ſuch of the ſoldiets as had all along diſapproved of&nbsp;the revolt, exhorting them at the fame time to enter&nbsp;into an aſſociation againſt the ſeditious, and put to the&nbsp;ſword ſuch as had involved them in the preſent ignominy and guilt. This propoſal was approved of, and a&nbsp;cruel maſſacre immediately took place ; inſomuch that&nbsp;when Germanicus came to the camp, he found the&nbsp;greateſt part of the legions deſtroyed. This greatly affected the humane Germanicus, who cauſed the bodies of the ſlain to be burnt, and celebrated their obſequies with the uſual ſolemnities ; however, the ſedition&nbsp;was thus effectually quelled, after which he led his army&nbsp;into Germany. There he performed many great exploits f ; hut ſtill all that he could perform was far&nbsp;from freeing the empire from ſo dangerous and trouble-ſome an enemy. In the year 19, he died, of poiſon, as&nbsp;was ſuppoſed, given by Piſo, his partner in the government of Syria, to which Germanicus had been promoted after his return from the north.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the mean time, Tiberius, though he affected to court the favour of the people by various methods,&nbsp;yet ſhowed himſelf in general ſuch a cruel and blood-thirſty tyrant, that he became the object of univerſal&nbsp;abhorrence. Though he had hated Germanicus in his&nbsp;heart, he puniſhed Piſo with death ; but in about a&nbsp;year after the death of Germanicus, having now no&nbsp;object of jealouſy to keep him in awe, he&quot; began to&nbsp;pull off the'maſli, and appear more in his natural character than before. He took upon himſelf the interpretation of all political meaſures, and began daily to&nbsp;diminiſh the authority of the ſenate ; which deſign&nbsp;was much facilitated, by their own aptitude to ſlavery ; ſo that he deſpiſed their meanneſs, while he&nbsp;enjoyed its effects. A law at that time ſubliſted,&nbsp;which made it treaſon to form any injurious attempt&nbsp;againſt the ,majefty of the people. Tiberius aſſumed&nbsp;to himſelf the interpretation and enforcement of this&nbsp;law ; and extended it not only to the caſes which really&nbsp;affected the ſafety of the ſtate, but to every conjuncture that could poſſibly be favourable to his hatred or&nbsp;ſuſpicions. All freedom was now therefore baniſhed&nbsp;from convivial meetings, and diffidence reigned amongſt&nbsp;the deareſt relations. The law of offended majeſty&nbsp;being revived, many perſons </span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font1">diſtinction fell a ſacriſice to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the beginning of theſe cruelties, Tiberius took into his confidence Sejanus, a Roman knight, but by&nbsp;birth a Volſcian, who found out the method of gaining his confidence, by the moſt refined degree of diſſimulation, being an over-match for his maſter in his&nbsp;own arts. He was made by tſhe emperor captain of&nbsp;the Prætotian guards, one of the moſt confidential truſts&nbsp;in the ſtate, and extolled in the ſenate as a worthy&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a</span><span class="font1">ſſ</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ociate </span><span class="font1">in his labours.
