As became his office and character, he incul-cated upon others what he practiſed himſelf, and knew to be equally the duty of all. " Οη his firſt fettlement BS a miniſter in the weſt Indies, he made ſome public attempts to inſtruct ſlaves. PIe began to draw up ſome caſy, plain diſcourſes for their inſtruction. He invited them to attend on Sundays, at particular hours. He appointed hours at home to inſtruct ſuch ſenſible ſlaves as would of themſelves attend. He repeatedly exhorted their maſters to encourage ſuch in their attendance. He re-commended the French cuſtom, of beginning and ending work by prayer. But inconceivable is the liſtleſſ-neſs with which he was heard, and bitter was the cenſure heaped on him in return. It was quickly ſuggeſt. ed, and generally believed, that he wanted to interrupt the work of ſlaves, to give them time, forſooth, to ſay their prayers ; that he aimed at the making of them Chriſtians, to render them incapable of being good ſlaves. In one word, he ſtood, in opinion, a rebel convict againſt the intereſt and majeſty of planterſhip. And as the Jews ſay, that in every puniſhment, with which they have been proved, ſince the bondage of Egypt, there has been an ounce of the golden caff of Horeb ; ſo might he ſay, that in every inſtance of prejudice (and they were not a few) with which, till within a year or two of his departure from the country, he was exerci-fed, there was an ounce of his fruitleſs attempts to improve the minds of ſlaves,, In the bidding prayer, he had inferted a petition for the converfion of thoſe per-ſons. But it was deemed ſo diſagreeable a memento, that ſeveral white people, on account oſ it, left off attending divine ſervice. He was obliged to omit the prayer entirely, to try and bring them back. In ſhort, neither were the ſlaves, at that time, deſirous oſ being taught, «or were their maſters inclined to encourage them.”</p><p>That he was hurt by this neglect cannot be queſtion-ed, for he had a mind benevolent, warm, and irritable ; but he ſtill retained many friends amongſt the moſt wor-thy members of the community : and as he was confci-ous of having done nothing more than his duty, he con-foled himſelf with reflecting, that thofe are " bleffed whom men revile, and perſecute, and ſpeak all manner of evil againſt falſely, for the ſake of the goſpel.”</p><p>Although his ſerious ſtudies were now theological, ⅛C conſidered himſelf as anſwerable to God, his country,</p><p>and his own family, for a proper uſe of every branch of knowledge which he poſſeſſed. He therefore took the charge of ſever al plantations around him in the capacity of a medical practitioner ; and attended them with unremitting diligence, and with great ſucceſs. Thus he lived<hi rend="sub">l</hi>  till the year 1777, when relinquiſhing the practice of phyſic entirely, he paid a viſit to the place of his na-tivity, which he had not feen ſince 1755. mother, whofe latter days he had made comfortable by a handſome annuity, had been dead for fome years ; but he re-warded all who had been attentive to her, or in early life ferviceable to himſelf ; and he continued the penſion to a ſiſter who had a numerous family, for which kv* huſhand was unable to provide.</p><p>After remaining three weeks in Scotland, and near a year in England, during which time he was admitted into the confidence of Lord George Germaine, ſecre-tary of ſtate for the American department, Mr Ramſay was appointed chaplain to Admiral Barrington, then going out to take a command in the weſt In-dies. Under this gallant officer, and afterwards under Lord Rodney, he was preſent at ſeveral engage-ments, where he diſplayed a fortitude and zeal for thc honour of his country which would not have diſgraeed the oldeſt admiral. To the navy, indeed, he ſeems to have been ſtrongly attached ; and he wrote, at an early period of his life, an <hi rend="italic">Fffαy on the Duty and Qualifications of a Sea-officer,</hi>  with ſuch a knowledge of the fervice as would have done honour to the pen of the moſt ex-perienced commander, of the firſt edition of this eſſay the profits were by its benevolent author appropriated to the Magdalen and Britiſh lying-in hofpitals, as thoſe of the fecond and third (which laſt was publiſhed about the period of which we now write) were to the maritime ſchool, or, in the event of its failure, to the marine ſociety.</p><p>Although careſſed by both the admirals under whom he ſerved, and having ſuch influence with the latter as to be able to render eſſential fervices to the Jews and other perfons whom he thought harſhly treated at the capture of<hi rend="sup">,</hi>St Euſtatius, Mr Ramſay once more quitted the ſea-ſervice, and retired to his paſtoral charge in the Iſland of St Chriſtopher’s. There, however, though the former animoſities againſt him had entirely ſubſided, and though his friendſhip was now ſolicited by every perfon of conſequence in the iſland, he remained but a little while. Sick of the life of a planter and of the pro-ſpect of ſlavery around him, he reſigned' his livings, bade adieu to the iſland, and returned to England with his wife and family in the end of the year 1781. Immediately on his arrival, he was, through the intereſt of his ſteady friend Sir Charles Middleton, preſented to the livings of Teſton and Nettleſtead in the county of Kent.</p><p>Here he was ſoon determined, by the advice of thoſe whom he moſt reſpected, to publiſh an <hi rend="italic">fiſſiy,</hi>  which had been written many years before, <hi rend="italic">on the Treatment and Converfion oſ African Slaves in the Britijh Sugar Colonies.</hi>  The controveiſy in which this publication invol-ved him, and the acrimony with which it was carried on, are ſo freſh in the memory of all our readers, that no man who thinks of the narrow limits within which our biographical articles muſt be confined, will blame us for not entering into a detail of the particulars.-— Torrents of obloquy were poured upon the benevolent author by writers who were unfair enough to conceal</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
