one of the great diviſions of natural bodies, but which has never yet been accurately defined. The characteriſtic marks of ſalt have uſually been reckoned its power of affecting the organs of taſte, and being ſoluble in water. But this will not diſtinguiſh ſalt from quicklime, which alſo affects the ſenſe of taſte, and diſſolves in water; yet quicklime has been univerſally reckoned an earth, and not a ſalt. The only diſtinguiſhing property of ſalts, therefore, is their cryſtallization in water: however, this does not belong to all ſalts; for the nitrous and marine acids, though allowed on all hands to be ſalts, are yet incapable of cryſtallization, at leaſt by any method hitherto known. Several of the imperfect neutral ſalts alſo, ſuch as combinations of the nitrous, muriatic, and vegetable acids, with ſome kinds of earths, cryſtallize with very great difficulty. However, by the addition of ſpirit of wine, or ſome other ſubſtances which abſorb part of the water, keeping the liquor in a warm place, &amp;c. all of them may be reduced to cryſtals of one kind or other. Salt, therefore, may be defined a ſubſtance affecting the organs of taſte, ſoluble in water, and capable of cryſtalization, either by itſelſ or in conjunction with ſome other body; and, univerſally, every ſalt capable of being reduced into a ſolid form, is alſo capable of cryſtallization <hi rend="italic">per ſe.</hi> Thus the claſs of ſaline bodies will be ſufficiently diſtinguiſhed from all others: for quicklime, though ſoluble in water, cannot be cryſtallized without addition either of fixed air or ſome other acid; yet it is moſt commonly found in a ſolid ſtate. The precious ſtones, baſaltes, &amp;c. though ſuppoſed to be formed by cryſtallization, are nevertheleſs diſtinguiſhed from ſalts by their inſipidity and inſolubility in water.</p><p>But acids and alkalis, and combinations of both, when in a concrete form, are ſalts, and of the pureſt fort. Hence we conclude, that the bodies, to which the name of <hi rend="italic">ſalts</hi> more properly belongs, are the concretions of thoſe ſubſtances; which are accordingly called <hi rend="italic">acid ſalts, alkaline ſalts,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">neutralſalts.</hi> Theſe laſt are combinations of acid and alkaline ſalts, in ſuch proportion as to render the compounds neither four nor alkaline to the taſte. This proportionate combination is called <hi rend="italic">ſaturation</hi>: thus the common kitchen-ſalt is a neutral ſalt, compoſed of marine acid and mineral alkali combined together to the point of ſaturation. The appellation of <hi rend="italic">neutral ſalts</hi> is alſo extended to denote all thoſe combinations of acids, and any other ſubſtance with which they can unite, ſo as to loſe, wholly or in great meaſure, their acid properties.</p><p>But altho’ this general definition of ſalts is commonly received, yet there are many writers, eſpecially mineralogiſts, who confine the denomination of <hi rend="italic">ſalts</hi> in the manner we firſt mentioned, viz. to thoſe ſubſtances only which, beſides the general properties of ſalts, have the power of cryſtallizing, that is, of arranging their particles ſo as to form regularly-ſhaped bodies, called <hi rend="italic">cryftals,</hi> when the water ſuperfluous to their concrete exiſtence has been evaporated.</p><p>The ancient chemiſts aſſerted that ſalt was one of the component principles of metals, and indeed of every thing elſe: a doctrine which was attempted to be revived by the late Dr Price of Guildford, who thought it probable that the baſis of all imperfect metals is ſaline, becauſe Mr Scheele had lately extracted a real acid from arſenic, which, by the addition of a proper quantity of phlogiſton, becomes a ſemimetal. But here the argument will hold only with regard to the ſemimetals, all of which are volatile in the fire, and therefore may poſſibly have a volatile baſis, ſuch as all acids are in ſome degree: but ſome of the imperfect metals, as tin and copper, may be reduced to a calx equally refractory with quicklime itſelf; and even zinc, though volatile in cloſe veſſels, is yet capable of being reduced to an exceedingly refractory calx called <hi rend="italic">flowers oſ zinc</hi>; and it is to be obſerved, that the regulus of arſenic, even in its moſt perfect metalline form, cannot be calcined like other metals. The common opinion that metals have an earthy, rather than a ſaline baſis, ſeems to be well founded.</p><p>The origin of ſalts is very much, or rather totally, unknown. Some eminent chemiſts, particularly Stahl, have ſuppoſed that the number of ſubſtances truly and eſſentially ſaline is very ſmall; nay, that there is but one ſaline principle in nature. This principle they ſuppoſe to be the vitriolic acid, as being the moſt ſimple and indeſtructible of them all. Stahl delivers his opinion on this ſubject in the following words: “That he conſiders the vitriolic acid as the only ſubſtance eſſentially ſaline; as the only ſaline principle which, by uniting more or leſs intimately with other ſubſtances that are not ſaline, is capable of forming an innumerable multitude of other ſaline matters, which nature and art ſhew us; and, ſecondly, that this ſaline principle is a ſecondary principle, compoſed only by the intimate union of two primary principles, water and earth.</p><p>In ſupport of this theory Mr Macquer argues in the following manner: “Every true chemiſt will eaſily diſcover that this grand idea is capable of comprehending by its generality, and of connecting together, all the phenomena exhibited by ſaline ſubſtances. But we muſt at the ſame time acknowledge, that when we examine the proofs upon which it is founded, although it has a great appearance of truth by its conſiſtency with the principles of chemiſtry, and with many phenomena, yet it is not ſupported by a ſufficient number of facts and experiments to aſcertain its truth. We might here examine what degree of probability ought to be granted to this theory of ſalts; but this could not be properly accompliſhed, without entering into long details, and penetrating into the depths of chemiſtry. We are therefore obliged to relate only what is moſt eſſential to be known concerning this grand hypotheſis. We may perceive at once, that the former of thoſe propoſitions, upon which is founded the theory which we mentioned, cannot be demonſtrated, unleſs it be previouſly proved that every ſaline matter, excepting pure vitriolic acid, is nothing but this ſame acid differently modified, the primary properties of which are more or leſs altered or diſguiſed by the union contracted with other ſubſtances. But we confeſs, that cherniſts are not capable of proving deciſively this opinion; which, however, will appear very probable from the following reflections. Firſt, of all ſaline matters known, none is ſo ſtrong,<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0626.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0620"/>
ſo unalterable, so eminently poſſeſſed of ſaline properties, as vitriolic acid. ”</p><p>The vitriolic acid, when combined with other ſubſtances, forms vitriolic ſalts, which vary both in ſpeciſic names and properties, according to the various ſubſtances with which the acid is combined. Thus the vitriolic acid, combined with mineral alkali, forms the ſalt called <hi rend="italic">Glauber's ſalt,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ſal mirabile.</hi> When it is combined with calcareous earths, it forms vitriolic ſalts with baſes of calcareous earth, which are commonly called <hi rend="italic">ſelenites.</hi> When combined with argillaceous earths, it forms alum. When combined with metals, it forms vitriolic ſalts with metallic baſes, to which the general name <hi rend="italic">vitriols</hi> is given; and in commerce are commonly called <hi rend="italic">copperas.</hi> The vitriols principally uſed are, 1. The martial vitriol; called alſo <hi rend="italic">English vitriol, green vitriol,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">green copperas,</hi> which is a combination of vitriolic acid with iron. 2. The vitriol of copper, called alſo <hi rend="italic">blue vitriol, Cyprian vitriol,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">blue copperas;</hi> which is a combination of vitriolic acid and copper. 3. The vitriol of zinc, called alſo <hi rend="italic">white copperas,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Goſlar vitriol,</hi> which is a combination of the ſame acid with a ſemimetal called <hi rend="italic">zinc.</hi> It is a property peculiar to the vitriolic acid, that all the combinations of it, with thoſe ſubſtances with which it can form neutral ſalts, are ſuſceptible of cryſtallization.</p><p>“Secondly, Amongſt the other ſaline ſubſtances, thoſe which appear moſt active and moſt simple, as nitrous and marine acids, are at the ſame time thoſe whoſe properties moſt reſemble the properties of vitriolic acid.”</p><p>The nitrous acid, combined with all the ſubſtances with which it can mix, forms ſaline ſubſtances, in general called <hi rend="italic">nitrous ſalts;</hi> ſpecifying each particular ſalt by the name of the ſubſtance united to the acid. Thus nitrous acid, with fixed vegetable alkali, forms a ſaline ſubſtance called <hi rend="italic">nitre,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ſaltpetre.</hi> With mineral alkali, forms cubic or quadrangular nitre. When mixed with metallic ſubſtances, forms metallic nitres, which are ſpecified <hi rend="italic">nitre of gold; nitre of ſilver,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">lunar nitre, lunar crystals,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">cryſtals oſ ſilver, nitrous cryſtals oſ mercury; nitre of copper,</hi> &amp;c.</p><p>“Thirdly, We may give to vitriolic acid many of the characteriſtic properties of nitrous acid, by combining it in a certain manner with the inflammable principle, as we ſee in the volatile ſulphureous acid; and even, according to an experiment of Mr Piech, related in a memoir concerning the origin of nitre, which gained the prize of the academy of Berlin, vitriolic acid, mixed with vegetable and animal matters ſuſceptible of fermentation, is really transformed into a nitrous acid by the putrefaction of theſe matters. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Chemistry,</hi> n <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi> 720.</p><p>“Fourthly, The marine acid, although its principles are leſs known than thoſe of the nitrous acid, may be approximated to the character of vitriolic and nitrous acids by certain methods. This acid, after it has been treated with tin and other metallic matters, is capable oſ forming either with ſpirit of wine, as vitriolic acid does, which it cannot do in its natural ſtate; and when iron is diſſolved in it, it ſeems to be approximated to the nature of nitrous acid. Reciprocally,</p><p>the approximation of vitriolic acid to the character of marine acid ſeems not impoſſible. Having once diſtilled very pure vitriolic acid upon a conſiderable quantity of white arſenic, I was ſtruck with a ſtrong ſmell like that of marine acid, which was not either that of arſenic or of vitriolic acid; for this has no ſmell when it is pure. ”</p><p>The marine acid, combined with various matters, forms marine ſalts, or Amply ſalts, ſpeciſied by the names of their particular baſes. The ſea-ſalt, or kitchen ſalt, and ſal gem, are combinations of marine acid and mineral alkali. When this acid is combined with volatile alkali, it forms ſal ammoniac <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. )</hi> With metals it forms metallic ſalts, called <hi rend="italic">ſalt of gold, ſalt of copper,</hi> &amp;c. according to the various metals combined with the acid. The ſalt of ſilver is alſo called <hi rend="italic">luna cornea</hi>; the ſalt of lead is often called <hi rend="italic">plumbum corneum;</hi> and the ſalts of antimony, and of arſenic, are known by the names of <hi rend="italic">butter oſ antimony,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">butter of arſenic.</hi></p><p>“Fifthly, Oily vegetable acids become ſo much ſtronger, and more ſimilar to vitriolic acid, as they are more perfectly deprived of their oily principle, by combining them with alkalis, earths, or metals; and afterwards by ſeparating them from theſe ſubſtancee by diſtillation, and eſpecially by frequently repeating theſe operations. They might perhaps be reduced to a pure vitriolic acid, by continuing ſufficiently this method: and reciprocally, vitriolic and nitrous acids, weakened by water, and treated with much oily matters, or ſtill better with ſpirit of wine, acquire the characters of vegetable acids. We may ſee a remarkable inſtance of this in Mr Pott’s diſſertation <hi rend="italic">De acido nitri vinofo.</hi> [The moſt remarkable experiment in which is related under the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Chemistry,</hi> n <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi> 781. ]</p><p>“Sixthly, The properties of fixed alkalis ſeem to be very different from thoſe of acids in general, and conſequently of vitriolic acid. Yet if we conſider that a large quantity of earth enters their compoſition; that much of it may be ſeparated by repeated ſolutions and calcinations; and alſo, that by depriving theſe ſaline ſubſtances of their earthy principles, they become leſs fixed, more deliqueſcent, and, in a word, more ſimilar to vitriolic acid in this reſpect; — we ſhall not think it improbable, that fixed alkalis owe their ſaline properties to a ſaline principle, of the nature of vitriolic acid, but much diſguiſed by the quantity of earth, and probably of inflammable principle, to which it is united in theſe combinations. The properties of volatile alkalis, and the transformation of fixed alkali, or of its materials, into volatile alkali in putrefaction, and in ſeveral diſtillations, ſeem to (how ſufficiently that they are matters eſſentially ſaline, as fixed alkalis are, and that their volatility which diſtinguiſhes them proceeds from their containing a leſs quantity of earth, but more attenuated, and a portion of very ſubtile and volatile oil, which enters their compoſition. [For ſome other particulars relating to the tranſmutation of ſalts, ſee <hi rend="smallcaps">Chemistry,</hi> n⁰ 784. ]</p><p>“Beſides theſe principal facts, there are many others, too numerous to be even ſlightly mentioned here; they may be found ſcattered in the works of chemiſts, particularly of Stahl. But perſons who would collect and compare all the experiments relating to this<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0627.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0621"/>
ſubject, ought to know, that many of them are not ſufficiently aſcertained; and that perhaps a greater number of them have not been ſufficiently proſecuted, and are, properly ſpeaking, only begun. We mult even acknowledge, that many of thoſe experiments which we have mentioned have not been ſuſſiciently proſecuted.</p><p>“The ſecond fundamental propoſition of the theory of ſalts, namely, ‘That the vitriolic acid is compounded of only the aqueous and earthy principles, ’</p><p>is, like the firſt, ſupported by many facts which give it a degree of probability, but which do not amount to a complete demonſtration. This propoſition may be ſupported by the following conſiderations.</p><p>“Firſt, Experience conſtantly ſhows, that the properties of compound bodies are always the reſult of thoſe of the component parts of theſe bodies, or rather they are the properties of theſe component bodies modified by one another.</p><p>“Thus, if a body be compoſed of two principles, one of which is fixed and the other volatile, it will have a leſs degree of fixity than the former, and a leſs volatility than the latter. If it be compoſed of two principles, one of which is ſpecifically heavier than the other, its ſpecific gravity will be greater than that of one of them, and leſs than that of the other. The fame obſervation is applicable to all the other eſſential properties, excepting thoſe which deſtroy each other; as, for inſtance, the tendency to combination, or the diſſolving power; for theſe latter properties are weakened ſo much more in the compounds as their principles are more ſtrongly united, and in more juſt proportion.</p><p>“We obſerve, nevertheleſs, that the properties of compound bodies are not always exactly intermediate betwixt the properties of the component bodies; for, to produce this mean, the quantities of each of the component parts muſt be equal, which is the caſe in few or no compounds.</p><p>“Beſides, ſome particular circumſtances in the manner in which the principles unite with one another, contribute more or leſs to alter the reſult of the combined properties: for inſtance, experience ſhows, that when ſeveral bodies, particularly metals, are united together, the ſpecific gravities of which are well known, the allay formed by ſuch union has not the preciſe ſpecific gravity which ought to reſult from the proportion of the allayed ſubſtances; but that in ſome allays it is greater and in others leſs. But we are certain, on the other fide, that theſe differences are too inconſiderable to prevent our diſtinguiſhing the properties of the principles in the compounds which they form, eſpecially when they have very different properties.</p><p>“Theſe things being premiſed, when we examine well the properties of vitriolic acid, we ſhall eaſily find that they partake of the properties of the aqueous and of the earthy principles.</p><p>“Firſt, When this acid is as pure as we can have it, it is like the pureſt water and the pureſt vitrifiable earths, free from colour or ſmell, and perfectly tranſparent.</p><p>“Secondly, Although we cannot deprive the vitriolic acid of all the water ſuperabundant to its ſaline eſſence, and therefore its preciſe ſpecific gravity has not been determined, we know that when it is well</p><p>concentrated, it is more than twice as heavy as pure water, and much leſs heavy than any earthy ſubſtance.</p><p>“Thirdly, This acid is much leſs fixed than any pure earth, ſince, however well it may be concentrated, it may always be entirely diſtilled; for which purpoſe a much ſtronger degree of heat is requiſite than for the diſtillation of pure water.</p><p>“Fourthly, We do not know the degree of ſolidity of vitriolic acid, or the adheſion of aggregation, which its integrant parts have one to another, becauſe for this purpoſe the vitriolic acid ought to be deprived of all ſuperabundant water: but if we judge of it by the ſolid conſiſtence of this acid when highly concentrated, as we ſee from the vitriolic acid called <hi rend="italic">glacial,</hi> the integrant parts of this acid ſeem ſuſceptible of a much ſtronger adheſion than thoſe of pure water; but much leſs than thoſe of earth, as we ſee from the inſtance of hard ſtones.</p><p>“Fifthly, The union which this acid contracts with water and with earths, ſhows that theſe ſubſtances enter into its compoſition; for we know, that in general compounds are diſpoſed to unite ſuperabundantly with the principles which compoſe them. All theſe properties of vitriolic acid, which ſo ſenſibly partake, and much more than any other acid, of the properties of earth and of water, are ſufficient to induce us to believe that it is compoſed of theſe two principles; but it has one very eminent property, which is common with it to neither water nor pure earth, which is, its violent and corroſive taſte. This property is ſufficient to raiſe doubts, if we could not explain it from principles, which ſeem certain and general, relating to the combination of bodies.</p><p>“We obſerve, then, concerning the property now in queſtion, that is, of taſte in general, that it can only be conſidered as an irritation made upon the organs of taſte by ſapid bodies; and if we reflect attentively upon it, we ſhall be convinced, that no ſubſtance that is not impreſſed by ſome impulſe can irritate or agitate our ſenſible organs, but by a peculiar force of its integrant parts, or by their tendency to combination; that is, by their diſſolving power. According to this notion, the taſte of bodies, or the impreſſion made upon our ſenſible organs by their tendency to combination, or by their diſſolving power, are the ſame property; and we ſee accordingly, that every ſolvent has a taſte, which is ſo much more ſtrong as its diſſolving power is greater; that, thoſe whoſe taſte is ſo violent that it amounts to acrimony, corroſion, and cauſticity, when applied to any other of the ſenſible parts of our body beſides the organs of taſte, excite in them itching and pain.</p><p>“This being premiſed, the queſtion is, How earth, in which we perceive no taſte nor diſſolving power, and water, which has but a very weak diſſolving power, and little or no taſte, ſhould form by their combination a ſubſtance, ſuch as the vitriolic acid is, powerfully corroſive and ſolvent?</p><p>“To conceive this, let us conſider, firſt, that every part of matter has a power by which it combines, or tends to combine, with other parts of matter. Secondly, that this force, the effects of which are perceptible, in chemical operations, only among the very ſmall molecules, or the integrant and conſtituent parts of bodies, ſeems proportionable to the denſity or ſpecific gravity of theſe parts. Thirdly, that this ſame force is limited<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0628.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0622"/>
in every integrant molecule of matter: that if we conſider this force as not ſatisſied, and conſequently as a ſimple tendency to combination, it is the greateſt poſſible in an integrant molecule of matter perfectly inhibited, or attached to nothing; and is the ſmalleſt poſſible, or none, when it is ſatisfied by its intimate combination with other parts capable of exhauſting all its action; its tendency being then changed into adheſion.</p><p>“Hence we may infer, that the integrant parts of the earthy principle have eſſentially, and like all the other parts of matter, a force of tendency to union, or of coheſion in union, according to their condition; that as this earthy principle has a much more conſiderable denſity or ſpecific gravity than all other ſimple bodies that we know, we may probably preſume that its primary integrant molecules have a more conſiderable force of tendency to union, in the ſame proportion, than the integrant parts of other principles; that conſequently when they cohere together, and form an aggregate, their aggregation muſt alſo be ſtronger and firmer than that of any other body. Accordingly we ſee, that the pureſt earthy ſubſtances, whoſe parts are united and form maſſes, ſuch as, for inſtance, the ſtones called <hi rend="italic">vitrifiable,</hi> are the hardeſt bodies in nature. We are no leſs certain, that as the tendency of the parts of matter to unite is ſo much leſs evident as it is more exhauſted and ſatisſied in the aggregation, the parts of the earthy principle being capable of exhauſting mutually all their tendency to union, we may thence infer, that every ſenſible maſs oſ pure earthy matter muſt appear deprived of any diſſolving power; of taſte; in a word, of tendency to union from the firmneſs of its aggregation. But we may alſo infer, that when theſe primary integrant parts of the earthy principle are not united together in aggregation, then, reſuming all the activity and tendency to union which are eſſential to them, they muſt be the ſtrongeſt and moſt powerful of all ſolvents.</p><p>“Theſe being premiſed, if we ſuppoſe again, with Stahl and the beſt chemiſts, that, in the combination of the ſaline principle or of vitriolic acid, the parts of the earthy principle are united, not with each other, as in the earthy aggregation, but with the primary parts of the aqueous principle, each to each, we may then eaſily conceive, that the primary integrant parts of the water, having eſſentially much leſs tendency to combination than thoſe of earth, the tendency of theſe latter to union will not be exhauſted, but ſatisſied only partly, by their combination with the former; and that conſequently a compound muſt reſult, the integrant parts of which will have a ſtrong diſſolving power, as vitriolic acid is.</p><p>“We may ſee from hence how much miſtaken chemiſts are, who, conſidering earth only in its aggregation, or rather not attending to this ſtate, and not diſtinguiſhing it from that ſtate in which the parts of this ſame earth are ſo ſeparated from each other by the interpoſition of another body, that they cannot touch or cohere together, have conſidered the earthy principle as a ſubſtance without force or action, and have very improperly called that a <hi rend="italic">paſſive principle,</hi> which of all other is the ſtrongeſt, moſt active, and moſt powerful.</p><p>“However this general theory of ſalts may conform with the moſt important phenomena of chemiſtry, we muſt acknowledge, that it can only be propoſed as a ſyematical opinion, till it be evidently demonſtrated</p><p>by the deciſive means employed in chemical demonſtra- tions, namely, by decompoſition and recompoſition: thus, if we could reduce vitriolic acid to earth and water, and make that acid by combining together theſe two principles, this theory would ceaſe to be a ſyſtem, and would become a demonſtrated truth. But we muſt confeſs, that this theory is leſs ſupported by experiment than by argument, from the many difficulties that are inevitable in ſuch inquiries. For on one fide, we know that the ſimpler bodies are, the more difficult is their decompoſition; and on the other ſide, the ſtronger the aggregation is, the greater is the difficulty of making it enter into a new combination. Thus, as vitriolic acid is very ſimple, ſince it is a compound of the firſt order, it ought ſtrongly to reſiſt decompoſition; and as the aggregation of pure earth is the firmeſt that we know, it cannot eaſily be made to enter as a principle into a new combination with water to form a ſaline matter. The following are the principal experiments which have been made relative to the ſubject.</p><p>“Firſt, We ſeem to be certain, from many proofs, that all ſaline ſubſtances, comprehending thoſe that contain vitriolic acid, as vitriolated tartar, Glauber’s ſalt, and other vitriolated ſalts which are ſufficiently fixed to ſupport a perfect drying, or rather calcination, being alternately diſſolved, dried, and calcined a number of times, are more and more diminiſhed in quantity, and that earth and water are ſeparated from them each operation. But alkaline ſalts appear to be ſtill more ſuſceptible than any other ſaline matter of this kind of decompoſition.</p><p>“Secondly, When nitre is burnt in cloſe veſſels, ſo that we may retain not only all that remains fixed after this burning, but alſo what exhales in vapours, as in the experiment of the clyſſus of nitre, we have a proof which ſeems deciſive, that the mineral acid of this ſalt, which is not very far from the ſimplicity of vitriolic acid, is totally decompoſed and reduced into earth and water. For if we examine the fixed reſiduum in the retort, we find that it is only the alkali that was contained in the nitre, charged with a ſuperabundant earth, which is ſeparable from it by ſolution and filtration. And if the liquor in the receiver, formed by the vapours condenſed there, be examined, which ought to be nitrous acid; if this acid had not been deſtroyed, we find, that, ſo far from being acid, it is only pure water, ſometimes even charged with a little fixed alkali, which had been raiſed by the force of the detonation. Thus nitrous acid is made to diſappear in this experiment, and in its place we find only earth and water.</p><p>“Thirdly, The phenomena of limeſtone, which by calcination and extinction in water acquires ſaline properties that it had not before its attenuation by fire and its combination with water; and alſo the experiment of Beccher, who aſſerts, that if a vitrifiable ſtone be alternately made red-hot, and extinguiſhed in water a number of times, it may be ſo attenuated that it ſhall be like a ſaline gelatinous matter; theſe, I ſay, ſhow that ſaline matters are actually formed by the intimate combination of the very attenuated parts of earth with thoſe of water. We find in the writings of Beccher and Stahl, and particularly in the <hi rend="italic">Specimen Beccherianum</hi> of the latter author, many other obſervations and experiments tending to prove the ſame propoſition; but we muſt confeſs, that none of the experiments we have mentioned, excepting that of the decompoſition<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0629.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0623"/>
of nitrous acid by burning, are abſolutely deciſive; principally becauſe they have not been ſufficiently repeated or proſecuted, nor carefully enough examined in all their circumſtances. ”</p><p>On this theory it is obvious to remark, that our author has omitted to mention the moſt active part of the compoſition of ſalts, namely elementary fire. Of this both acids and alkalis undoubtedly contain a great quantity in a very active ſtate, as is evident from their performing the effects of fire when applied to certain ſubſtances; nay, from their actually burſting into flame when mixed with ſome kinds of oils. For an explanation of the reaſon of which, ſee <hi rend="smallcaps">Heat,</hi> and the various detached articles relative to that ſubject. Whatever doubts we may have of the power of mere water combined with mere earth to affect the organs of taſte, we can have none that the element of fire is capable of ſo doing; and from the very taſting of theſe ſubſtances, we may be aſſured, that whatever gives that peculiar ſenſation to the tongue which we call <hi rend="italic">acid</hi> or <hi rend="italic">alkaline,</hi> gives alſo the other properties of the ſalt, whatever they may be. In alkalis, no doubt the greateſt part of the compoſition is earth; but from what has been ſaid on <hi rend="smallcaps">Quicklime,</hi> it appears, that mere earth, by the artificial action of fire alone, acquires all the properties of ſalt, that of cryſtallizing <hi rend="italic">per ſe</hi> excepted: it ſeems probable therefore, that, in the more perfect operations of nature, the ſame materials are uſed; only the proportions are ſuch, that the ſubſtance is more ſoluble, and its cauſticity greater, than even quicklime itſelf. With regard to acids, the earthy parts ſeem to be fewer; and in all probability the moſt conſiderable ingredient in their compoſition is water: but in what manner this element is united to that of fire ſo as to produce the peculiar phenomena of acids, cannot be explained.</p><p>The acid of tartar (the pureſt part of which, or that ſaline ſubſtance which firſt cryſtallizes by evaporation in the veſſels in which it is purified, is called <hi rend="italic">cream oſ tartar),</hi> and alſo all other concrete vegetable acids analogous to it, when mixed with various other ſubſtances, form compounds, generally called <hi rend="italic">tartareous ſalts,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ſoluble tartars,</hi> becauſe they are diſſolved by water more eaſily than the acid of tartar itſelf. Acetous ſalts, that is, all ſalts containing the acid of vinegar, are alſo combined with various baſes, and form ſaline ſubſtances of different names; the principal of which are, the acetous ſalt of copper, called <hi rend="italic">cryſtals oſ Venus, or oſ verdigris,</hi> by the chemiſts, and <hi rend="italic">diſtilled</hi> or <hi rend="italic">cryſtallized verdigris</hi> in commerce; the acetous ſalt of lead, commonly called <hi rend="italic">fait</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ſugar oſ lead;</hi> and the acetous mercurial ſalts. Sugar is an eſſential vegetable ſalt, of a pleaſant ſweet taſte, containing a vegetable acid combined with earth and oil.</p><p>Potaſh is a fixed vegetable alkali, extracted from the aſhes of wood. Concrete volatile alkalis are generally called <hi rend="italic">volatile ſalts;</hi> although this name is ſometimes alſo given to the volatile ſalt of amber, which is not an alkaline but an acid ſalt. Borax is a neutral ſaline matter, whoſe origin, whether animal or vegetable, is as yet unknown, its components being not ſuſſiciently examined. It is ſoluble in water, and very nearly as cryſtallizable as alum. When borax is expoſed to the fire, it firſt bubbles and foams very much, but afterwards it melts into a clear glaſs. When acids are combined with the alkaline part of borax, a ſubſtance of a Angular nature is ſeparated from it, commonly called <hi rend="italic">ſedative ſalt.</hi> Although this ſubſtance acts as an acid in borax, by ſaturating its alkali, yet it has no acid taſte, nor doth it turn the tincture of heliotropium to a red, as other acids do. It is the property of borax to facilitate conſiderably the fuſion of metals, of earths, and other minerals. Some ſpecies of ſtones and earths cannot be vitrified at all, except they are mixed with borax. For this property borax is commonly uſed as a flux (that is, a ſubſtance which facilitates the fuſion of other bodies) in various manufactories; but eſpecially in ſoldering metals, and in aſſaying ores. Phoſphoric ſalts are combinations of alkaline, earthy, and metallic ſubſtances with the acid obtained from the phoſphorus of urine. Beſides the above-mentioned ſalts, there are ſeveral others to be met with in the writings of the chemical and medical authors; but, as they are of little conſequence, we ſhall omit any account of them.</p><p>Some new neutral ſalts have been formed by the de- phlogiſticated marine, or, according to the new theory, the oxygenated muriatic acid. — This was firſt taken notice of by M. Berthollot, and the diſcovery is thus illuſtrated by Dr Dollfuſs, in Crell’s Annals for the year 1788, vol. i. p. 319.</p><p>“In the month of November 1786 (ſays he), whilſt I was preparing to tranſlate Higgins’s experiments reſpecting the acetous acid, I found the following amongſt the numerous obſervations which that work contains, p. 180. ‘The acid elaſtic fluid which iſſues, when two</p><p>pounds of manganeſe are mixed and diſtilled with two or three of ordinary ſpirit of ſea-ſalt, may all, except a ſmall portion of phlogiſtic air, be condenſed in a ſolution of fixed vegetable alkali; and the ſolution thus impregnated yields a conſiderable quantity of nitre, which cryſtallizes in the ordinary form, and detonates on red- hot coals. The ſolution at the ſame time yields regenerated ſea-ſalt. ’ The part of this propoſition which relates to the form of the cryſtals and to their detonation is ſuſſiciently plain; but that I might have a ſtill more complete conviction on the ſubject, I repeated the experiment upon a ſmall ſcale.</p><p>“For this purpoſe I put into a vial an ounce of pul- veriſed oxyd (<hi rend="italic">calx)</hi> of manganeſe with an ounce and a half of muriatic acid, and by means of a bent tube I directed the vapour into another vial, which contained a ſolution of vegetable alkali. I then diſtilled by the gentle heat of a ſmall lamp. From the vial containing the alkali went a ſecond tube, for the purpoſe of carrying off the air which I hoped to obtain by this proceſs.</p><p>“As ſoon as the oxygenated muriatic acid appeared, ſome air eſcaped through the tube, which ſhowed all the properties of common atmoſpheric air; and as ſoon as all the air which the vials contained previous to the diſtillation had been expelled, no more ſuch air appeared. The vapours of the oxygenated muriatic acid were abſorbed by the ſolution of vegetable alkali, without the extrication of the ſmalleſt portion of carbonic acid (fixed air) from the alkali. As ſalt as the alkali, which adhered to the ſides of the glaſs, abſorbed the acid vapour, priſmatic cryſtals appeared; and many more, which I obtained a few hours afterwards, were formed in the liquor. Although theſe cryſtals detonated in the lire, they had a taſte very different from that of nitre. It was extremely pungent, and was rendered ſtill<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0630.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0624"/>
more intolerable by the ſuffocating odour of the nitro- muriatic acid <hi rend="italic">(aqua regia).</hi> In order to complete the cryſtallization, I evaporated in the ſame vial the remaining liquor. As ſoon as the vapour appeared, a quantity of carbonic acid was diſengaged, and afterwards ſome atmoſpheric air. The ſalt which I obtained by cryſtallization after the evaporation was a true muriat of potaſh, which did not detonate in the fire. Probably Mr Higgins performed the operation in the way I have deſcribed; but he was too haſty in concluding this ſalt to be nitre merely becauſe it detonated, I gave an account of this experiment to Mr Kirwan at the time, and ſoon after communicated it to Profeſſor Gadolin, who offered to aſſiſt me in repeating the experiment.</p><p>"We agreed to employ cryſtallized carbonat of ſoda (mild mineral alkali); and the following was the reſult of our experiment. We diſſolved ſome of this carbonat in a large quantity of water, and we employed two or three hours a day, for ſeveral ſucceſſive days, in introducing into the ſolution as much oxygenated muriatic gas as was ſufficient entirely to ſaturate it; we then poured the ſaline liquor into a glaſs baſon, and left it covered over to evaporate ſpontaneouſly. After ſome time a number of priſmatic cryſtals were formed, which detonated in the fire like nitre. They occaſioned a brown precipitate from a ſolution of iron in ſulphuric or vitriolic acid; and mixed with ſal ammoniac, they gave out a ſtrong ammoniacal odour, accompanied with ſome efferveſcence, which was to be attributed to the extrication of fixed air during the mixture. The remaining part of the liquor evaporated again, produced freſh cryſtals, which, though they certainly had a faint ſmell of oxygenated muriatic acid, in reality conſiſted partly of muriat of ſoda (common ſalt), and partly of uncombined ſoda; for they did not detonate, and they precipitated iron of a light green colour. The liquor which appeared above theſe cryſtals, however, had not yet entirely loſt the ſmell of the oxygenated muriatic acid. Since this, M. Gadolin has made the following experiment, which he communicated to me. He put two drams of magnefia, ſaturated with carbonic acid, into an ounce and a half of water, into which he introduced during ſeveral hours a quantity of oxygenated muriatic gas. The water evidently acquired the odour of the oxygenated muriatic acid. He filtered the liquor, and waſhed and dried that part of the magneſia which had not been diſſolved, and which weighed one dram 4-5ths, ſo that the water was found to have diſſolved <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> th of a dram. As ſoon as the liquor began to boil, a ſtrong eſſerveſcence was occaſioned, ſome oxygenated muriatic gas was diſengaged, and a ſmall quantity of carbonat of magneſia was precipitated. When the liquor had become cool, it was filtered, that it might be ſeparated from the precipitated powder. It had ſtill the ſame odour; and on being again heated, an eſſerveſcence ſimilar to the firſt took place, and a freſh quantity of carbonat of magneſia was ſeparated. This phenomenon appeared every time M. Gadolin boiled the liquor after its cooling, till at laſt he had evaporated it to dryneſs, when there ſtill remained a ſmall quantity of magneſia. Hence M. Gadolin concludes, that water, oxygenated muriatic acid, and carbonat of magneſia, form a combination which heat does not decompoſe till the vapour of the water carries off the oxygenated muriatic acid, at which time the carbonat of magneſia is precipitated. In conſequence of what we have now related, we ought to reckon, in addition to the two ſalts diſcovered by M. Berthollet, another ſalt, to which, according to the new French nomenclature, might be given the name <hi rend="italic">murias oxygenatus magneſiae liquidus,</hi> becauſe we cannot obtain it in a concrete form. The oxygenated muriatic acid appears to enter into a very different, or at leaſt into a much more intimate, combination with the metals; a ſubject which greatly merits the attention of the chemiſt.</p><p>The probability of this propoſition is ſtrengthened by the theory of M. Berthollet; according to which the mercury in corroſive muriat of mercury (corroſive ſublimate) is combined with the oxygenated muriatic acid, ſo as not to be ſeparated from it without great difficulty.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Common</hi> <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Salt,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Sea-Salt,</hi> the name of that fait extracted front the waters of the ocean, which is uſed in great quantities for preſerving proviſions, &amp;c.</p><p>It is a perfect neutral ſalt, compoſed of marine or muriatic acid, ſaturated with mineral alkali. It has a ſaline but agreeable flavour. It requires about four times its weight of cold water to be diſſolved, and nearly the ſame quantity of boiling water, according to Macquer. But according to Kirwan, it only requires 2, 5 its weight of water to be diſſolved in the temperature of ſixty degrees of Fahrenheit. This ſalt always contains ſome part formed with a calcareous baſe; and, in order to have it pure, it muſt he diſſolved in diſtilled water; then a ſolution of mineral alkali is to be poured in it until no white precipitation appears; then by filtrating and evaporating the ſolution, a pure common ſalt is produced. Its figure is perfectly cubic, and thoſe hollow pyramids, or <hi rend="italic">tremies</hi> as the French call them, as well as the parallelopipeds formed ſometimes in its cryſtallization, conſiſt all of a quantity of ſmall cubes diſpoſed in thoſe forms. Its decrepitation on the fire, which has been reckoned by ſome as a characteriſtic of this ſalt, although the vitriolated tartar, nitrous lead, and other ſalts, have the ſame property, is owing chiefly to the water, and perhaps alſo to the air of its cryſtallization.</p><p>Its ſpeciſic gravity is 2,120 according to Kirwan. The acid of tartar precipitates nothing from it. One hundred parts of common ſalt contain thirty-three of real acid, fifty of mineral alkali, and ſeventeen of water. It is commonly found in ſalt water and ſalt ſprings, in the proportion of even thirty-fix <hi rend="italic">per cent.</hi> It is found alſo in coals, and in beds of gypſum. This ſalt is unalterable by fire, though it fuſes, and becomes more opake: nevertheleſs a violent fire, with the free acceſs of air, cauſes it to evaporate in white flowers, which ſtick to the neighbouring bodies. It is only decompoſed, as Macquer affirms, by the vitriolic and nitrous acid; and alſo by the boracic or ſedative ſalt. But although nitre is decompoſed very eaſily by arſenic, this neutral marine ſalt is nowiſe decompoſed by the ſame. According to Mongez, the fixed vegetable alkali, when cauſtic, decompoſes alſo this marine ſalt. It preſerves from corruption almoſt all forts of animal food much better for uſe than any other ſalt, as it preſerves them without deſtroying their taſte and qualities; but when applied in too ſmall a quantity, it then forwards their corruption.</p><p>Of this moſt uſeful commodity there are ample ſtores on land as well as in the ocean. There are few countries<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0631.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0625"/>
which do not afford vaſt quantities of rock or foſſil ſalt. Mines<note anchored="true" n="1" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="smallcaps">(a)</hi> Amongſt the ſalt mines of chief note are thoſe of Northwich in Cheſhire, Altemonte in Calabria, Hall in Tyrol, Cardona in Catalonia: alſo thoſe ſtupendous mines at Wilieczka of Roland, and Soowar in Upper Hungary; of which ſee accounts in Phil. Tranſ. No 61. and 413.</p></note> <hi rend="smallcaps">(a)</hi> of it have long been diſcovered and wrought in England, Spain, Italy, Germany, Hungary, Poland, and other countries of Europe. In ſeveral parts of the world, there are huge mountains which wholly conſiſt of foſſil ſalt. Of this kind are two mountains in Ruſſia, nigh Aſtracan; ſeveral in the kingdoms of Tunis and Algiers, in Africa; and ſeveral alſo in Alia; and the whole iſland of Ormus in the Perſian gulf almoſt entirely conſiſts of foſſil ſalt. The new world is like- wiſe ſtored with treaſures of this uſeful mineral, as well as with all other kinds of ſubterranean productions. Moreover, the ſea affords ſuch vaſt plenty of common ſalt, that all mankind might thence be ſupplied with quantities ſufficient for their occaſions. There are alſo innumerable ſprings, ponds, lakes, and rivers, impregnated with common ſalt, from which the inhabitants of many countries are plentifully ſupplied therewith. In ſome countries which are remote from the ſea, and have little commerce, and which are not bleſſed with mines of ſalt or ſalt-waters, the neceſſities of the inhabitants have forced them to invent a method of extracting their common ſalt from the aſhes of vegetables. The muriatic ſalt of vegetables was deſcribed by Dr Grew under the title of <hi rend="italic">lixiviated marine ſalt.</hi> Leeuwenhoek obtained cubical cryſtals of this ſalt from a lixivium of ſoda or kelp, and alſo from a ſolution of the lixivial ſalt of carduus benedictus; of which he hath given figures in a letter to the Royal Society, publiſhed in N⁰ 173. of their Tranſactions. Dr Dagner, in <hi rend="italic">Act</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Acad. N. C.</hi> vol. v. obſ. 150. takes notice of great quantities of it which he found mixed in pot- aſhes. And the ingenious Dr Fothergill extracted plenty of it from the aſhes of fern: See <hi rend="italic">Medical Eſſays,</hi> vol. V. article 13.</p><p>The muriatic ſalt which the excellent Mr Boyle extracted from ſandiver, and ſuppoſed to be produced from the materials uſed in making glaſs, was doubtleſs ſeparated from the kelp made uſe of in that proceſs. Kunckel alſo informs us, that he took an alkaline ſalt; and after calcining it with a moderate fire, diſſolved it in pure water, and placing the ſolution in a cool cellar, obtained from it many cryſtals of a neutral ſalt. He ſuppoſes, that the alkaline ſalt was by the proceſs converted into this neutral ſalt. But it is more reaſonable to believe, that the alkaline ſalt which he applied was not pure, but mixed with the muriatic ſalt of vegetables, which by this proceſs was only ſeparated from it.</p><p>It is doubtleſs chiefly this muriatic ſalt which, in ſome of the inland parts of Aſia, they extract from the aſhes of duck-weed and of Adam’s fig-tree, and uſe for their common ſalt.</p><p>That they are able in thoſe countries to make common ſalt to profit from vegetables, ought not to be wondered at, ſince in Dehli and Agra, capitals of In- doſtan, ſalt is ſo ſcarce as uſually to be ſold for half-a- crown a pound. We may therefore give ſome credit to Marco Polo, wſhen he informs us, that in the inner parts of the ſame quarter of the world, in the province</p><p>of Caindu, lying weſt of Tebeth, the natives ufed fait inſtead of money, it being firſt made up in cakes, and ſealed with the ſtamp of their prince; and that they made great profit of this money by exchanging it with the neighbouring nations for gold and muſk. We are alſo told by Ludolfus, in his <hi rend="italic">Hiſstoria Æthiopica,</hi> that in the country of the Abyſſines there are mountains of ſalt, the which when dug out is ſoft, but ſoon grows hard; and that this ſalt ſerves them inſtead of money to buy all things. The ſame is confirmed by Ramuſio.</p><p>Mr Boyle diſcovered common ſalt in human blood and urine. “I have obferved it (ſays Mr Brownrigg), not only in human urine, but alſo in that of dogs, horſes, and black cattle. It may eaſily be diſcovered in theſe, and many other liquids impregnated with it, by certain very regular and beautiful ſtarry figures which appear in their ſurfaces after congelation. Theſe figures I firſt obſerved in the great froſt in the year 1739. The dung of ſuch animals as feed upon grafs or grain, doth alſo contain plenty of common ſalt. ”</p><p>Naturaliſts, obſerving the great variety of forms under which this ſalt appears, have thought fit to rank the ſeveral kinds of it under certain general claſſes; diſtinguiſhing it, moſt uſually, into rock or foſſil ſalt, ſea-ſalt, and brine or fountain ſalt. To which claſſes, others might be added, of thoſe muriatic ſalts which are found in vegetable and animal ſubſtances. Theſe ſeveral kinds of common ſalt often differ from each other in their outward form and appearance, or in ſuch accidental properties as they derive from the heterogeneous ſubſtances with which they are mixed. But when perfectly pure, they have all the ſame qualities; ſo that chemiſts, by the exacted inquiries, have not been able to diſcover any eſſential difference between them; for which reaſon we ſhall diſtinguiſh common ſalt after a different manner, into the three following kinds, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> into rock or native ſalt, bay ſalt, and white ſalt.</p><p>By <hi rend="italic">rock ſalt,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">native ſalt,</hi> is underſtood all ſalt dug out of the earth, which hath not undergone any artificial preparation. Under the title of <hi rend="italic">bay ſalt</hi> mav be ranked all kinds of common ſalt extracted from the water wherein it is diſſolved, by means of the ſun’s heat, and the operation of the air; whether the water from which it is extracted be ſea-water, or natural brine drawn from wells and ſprings, or ſalt water ſtagnating in ponds and lakes. Under the title of white <hi rend="italic">ſalt,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">boiled ſalt,</hi> may be included all kinds of common ſalt extracted by coction from the water whrein it is diſſolved; whether this water be ſea water, or the ſalt water of wells, fountains, lakes, or rivers; or water of any ſort impregnated with rock-ſalt, or other kinds of common ſalt.</p><p>The firſt of theſe kinds of ſalt is in ſeveral countries found ſo pure, that it ſerves for moſt domeſtic uſes, without any previous preparation (triture excepted); for of all natural ſalts rock-ſalt is the moſt abundantly furniſhed by nature in various parts of the world, being found in large maſſes, occupying great tracts of land. It is generally formed in ſtrata under the ſurface of the<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0632.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0626"/>
earth, as in Hungary, Moſcovy, Siberia, Poland, Calabria, Egypt, Ethiopia, and the Eaſt Indies. “In England (ſays Magellan), the ſalt mines at Northwich are in a high ground, and contain it in layers or ſtrata of various colours, of which the yellow and brown are the moſt plentiful, as I have obſerved on the ſpot, which I viſited in June 1782, in company with my worthy and learned friend Mr Volta, profeſſor of Natural Philoſophy in the Univerſity of Pavia, and well known by his great abilities, and many diſcoveries in that branch of knowledge. The mine into which we deſcended was excavated in the form of a vaſt dome or vault under ground, ſupported by various columns of the ſalt, that were purpoſely left to ſupport the incumbent weight. And the workmen having lighted a number of candles all round its circumference, it furniſhed us with the moſt agreeable and ſurpriſing fight, whilſt we were deſcending in the large tub, which ſerves to bring up the lumps that are broken from the mine, &amp;c. See the deſcription of the famous ſalt-mines of Wilieczka in Poland, by Mr Berniard, in the <hi rend="italic">Journal de Phyſique,</hi> vol. 16. for 1780, pag. 479, in which the miraculous tales concerning thoſe ſubterraneous habitations, villages, and towns, are reduced to their proper magnitude and eſtimate. ” But the Engliſh foſſil ſalt is unfit for the uſes of the kitchen, until by ſolution and coction it is freed from ſeveral impurities, and reduced into white ſalt. The Britiſh white ſalt alſo is not ſo proper as ſeveral kinds of bay ſalt for curing fiſh and ſuch fleſh-meats as are intended for ſea proviſions, or for exportation into hot countries. So that for theſe purpoſes we are obliged, either wholly or in part, to uſe bay ſalt, which we purchaſe in France, Spain, and other foreign countries.</p><p>However, it does not appear that there is any other thing requiſite in the formation of bay ſalt than to evaporate the ſea-water with an exceedingly gentle heat; and it is even very probable, that our common ſea ſalt by a ſecond ſolution and cryſtallization might attain the requiſite degree of purity. Without entering into any particular detail of the proceſſes uſed for the preparation of bay-ſalt in different parts of the world, we ſhall content ourſelves with giving a brief account of the beſt methods of preparing common ſalt.</p><p>At ſome convenient place near the ſea-ſhore is erected the ſaltern. This is a long, low building, conſiſting of two parts; one of which is called the <hi rend="italic">fore-hοuſe,</hi> and the other the <hi rend="italic">pan-houſe,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">boiling-houſe.</hi><note anchored="false" n="2" place="margin" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Browning on the Art of Preparing Salt</hi></p></note> The fore- houſe ſerves to receive the fuel, and cover the workmen; and in the boiling-houſe are placed the furnace, and pan in which the ſalt is made. Sometimes they have two pans, one at each end of the ſaltern; and the part appropriated for the fuel and workmen is in the middle.</p><p>The furnace opens into the fore-houſe by two mouths, beneath each of which is a mouth to the aſh-pits. To the mouths of the furnace doors are fitted; and over them a wall is carried up to the roof, which divides the fore-houſe from the boiling-houſe, and prevents the duſt of the coal and the allies and ſmoke of the furnace from falling into the ſalt pan. The fore-houſe communicates with the boiling-houſe by a door, placed in the wall which divides them.</p><p>The body of the furnace conſiſts of two chambers, divided from each other by a brick partition called the <hi rend="italic">mid-ſeather;</hi> which from a broad baſe terminates in a narrow edge nigh the top of the furnace; and by means of ſhort pillars of caſt iron erected upon it, ſupports the bottom of the ſalt pan; it alſo fills up a conſiderable part of the furnace, which otherwiſe would be too large, and would conſume more coals than, by the help of this contrivance, are required. To each chamber of the furnace is fitted a grate, through which the aſhes fall into the aſh-pits. The grates are made of long bars of iron, ſupported underneath by ſtrong croſs bars of the ſame metal. They are not continued to the fartheſt part of the furnace, it being unneceſſary to throw in the fuel ſo far: for the flame is driven from the fire on the grate to the fartheſt part of the furnace; and from thence paſſes together with the ſmoke, through two flues into the chimney; and thus the bottom of the ſalt pan is everywhere equally heated.</p><p>The ſalt pans are made of an oblong form, flat at the bottom, with the ſides erected at right angles; the length of ſome of theſe pans is 15 feet, in breadth 12 feet, and the depth 16 inches; but at different works they are of different dimenſions. They are commonly made of plates of iron, joined together with nails, and the joints are filled with a ſtrong cement. Within the pan five or fix ſtrong beams of iron are fixed to its oppoſite ſides, at equal diſtances, parallel to each other and to the bottom of the pan, from which they are diſtant about eight inches. From theſe beams hang down ſtrong iron hooks, which are linked to other hooks or claſps of iron firmly nailed to the bottom of the pan; and thus the bottom of the pan is ſupported, and prevented from bending down or changing its figure. The plates moſt commonly uſed are of malleable iron, about four feet and a half long, a foot broad, and the third of an inch in thickneſs. The Scots prefer ſmaller plates, 14 or 15 inches ſquare. Several make the ſides of the pan, where they are not expoſed to the fire, of lead; thoſe parts, when made of iron, being found to conſume faſt in ruſt from the ſteam of the pan. Some have uſed plates of caſt iron, five or fix feet ſquare, and an inch in thickneſs; but they are very ſubject to break when unequally heated, and ſhaken (as they frequently are) by the violent boiling of the liquor. The cement moſt commonly uſed to fill the joints is plaſter made of lime.</p><p>The pan, thus formed, is placed over the furnace, being ſupported at the four corners by brick work; but along the middle, and at the ſides and ends, by round pillars of caſt iron called <hi rend="italic">taplins,</hi> which are placed at three feet diſtance from each other, being about eight inches high, and at the top, where ſmalleſt, four inches in diameter. By means of theſe pillars the heat of the fire penetrates equally to all parts of the bottom of the pan, its four corners only excepted. Care is alſo taken to prevent the ſmoke of the furnace from paſſing into the boiling-houſe, by bricks and ſtrong cement, which are cloſely applied to every fide of the ſalt pan. In ſome places, as at Blyth in Nothumberland, beſides the common ſalt pans here deſcribed, they have a preparing-pan placed between two ſalt pans, in the middle part of the building, which in other works is the fore-houſe. The ſea-water being received into this preparing-pan, is there heated and in part evaporated by the flame and heat conveyed under it through flues from the two furnaces of the ſalt pans. And the hot water, as occaſion requires, is conveyed through troughs<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0633.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0627"/>
from the preparing pan into the ſalt pans. Various other contrivances have been invented to leſſen the expence of fuel, and ſeveral patents have been obtained for that purpoſe; but the ſalt-boilers have found their old methods the moſt convenient.</p><p>Between the ſides of the pan and walls of the boiling-houſe, there runs a walk five or fix feet broad, where the workmen ſtand when they draw the ſalt, or have any other buſineſs in the boiling-houſe. The ſame walk is continued at the end of the pan, next to the chimney; but the pan is placed cloſe to the wall at the end adjoining to the fore-houſe.</p><p>The roof of the boiling-houſe is covered with boards faſtened on with nails of wood, iron nails quickly mouldering into ruſt. In the roof are ſeveral openings, to convey off the watery vapours; and on each ſide of it a window or two, which the workmen open when they look into the pan whilſt it is boiling.</p><p>Not far diſtant from the ſaltern, on the ſea-ſhore, between full ſea and low-water marks, they alſo make a little pond in the rocks, or with ſtones on the fand, which they call their <hi rend="italic">ſump.</hi> From this pond they lay a pipe, through which, when the tide is in, the ſea- water runs into a well adjoining to the ſaltern; and from this well they pump it into troughs, by which it is conveyed into their ſhip or ciſtern, where it is ſtored up until they have occaſion to uſe it.</p><p>The ciſtern is built cloſe to the ſaltern, and may be placed moſt conveniently between the two boiling- houſes, on the back fide of the fore-houſe; it is made either of wood, or brick and clay; it ſometimes wants a cover, but ought to be covered with a ſhed, that the ſalt-water contained therein may not be weakened by rains, nor mixed with ſoot and other impurities. It ſhould be placed ſo high, that the water may conveniently run out of it, through a trough, into the ſalt pans.</p><p>Beſides the buildings already mentioned, ſeveral others are required; as flore-houſes for the ſalt, ciſterns for the bittern, an office for his majeſty’s ſalt officers, and a dwelling-houſe for the ſalt-boilers.</p><p>All things being thus prepared, and the ſea-water having ſtood in the ciſtern till the mud and fand are fettled to the bottom, it is drawn off into the ſalt pan. And at the four corners of the ſalt-pan, where the flame does not touch its bottom, are placed four ſmall lead pans called <hi rend="italic">ſcratch pans,</hi> which, for a ſalt-pan of the ſize above-mentioned, are uſually about a foot and an half long, a foot broad, and three inches deep; and have a bow or circular handle of iron, by which they may be drawn out with a hook, when the liquor in the pan is boiling.</p><p>The ſalt pan being filled with ſea-water, a ſtrong fire of pit coal is lighted in the furnace; and then, for a pan which contains about 1400 gallons, the ſalt- boiler takes the whites of three eggs, and incorporates them well with two or three gallons of ſea water, which he pours into the ſalt-pan while the water con tained therein is only lukewarm; and immediately ſtirs it about with a rake, that the whites of eggs may every where be equally mixed with the ſalt water.</p><p>Inſtead oſ whites of eggs, at many ſalterns, as at moſt of thoſe nigh Newcaſtle, they uſe blood from the butchers, either of ſheep or black cattle, to clarify the ſea-</p><p>water: And at many of the Scots ſalterns they do not give themſelves the trouble of clarifying it.</p><p>As the water grows hot, the whites of eggs ſeparate from it a black frothy icum, which ariſes to the ſurface of the water, and covers it all over. As ſoon as the pan begins to boil, this ſcum is all riſen, and it is then time to ſkim it off.</p><p>The moſt convenient inſtruments for this purpoſe are ſkimmers of thin aſh boards, ſix or eight inches broad, and ſo long that they may reach above half way over the ſalt-pan. Theſe ſkimmers have handles fitted to them; and the ſalt-boiler and his aſſiſtant, each holding one of them on the oppoſite ſides of the pan, apply them ſo to each other that they overlap in the middle, and beginning at one end oſ the pan, carry them gently forward together, along the ſurface of the boiling liquor, to the other end; and thus, without breaking the ſcum, collect it all to one end of the pan, from whence they eaſily take it out.</p><p>After the water is ſkimmed, it appears perfectly clear and tranſparent; and they continue boiling it briſkly, till ſo much of the freſh or aqueous part is evaporated, that what remains in the pan is a ſtrong brine almoſt fully ſaturated with ſalt, ſo that ſmall ſaline cryſtals begin to form on its ſurface; which operation, in a pan filled 15 inches deep with water, is uſually performed in five hours.</p><p>The pan is then filled up a ſecond time with clear ſea-water drawn from the ciſtern; and about the time when it is half filled, the ſcratch-pans are taken out, and being emptied of the ſcratch found in them, are again placed in the corners of the ſalt-pan. The ſcratch taken out of theſe pans is a fine white calcareous earth found in the form of powder, which ſeparates from the ſea-water during its coction, before the ſalt begins to form into grains. This ſubtile powder is violently agitated by the boiling liquor, until it is driven to the corners of the pan, where the motion of the liquor being more gentle, it ſubſides into the ſcratch pans placed there to receive it, and in them it remains undiſturbed, and thus the greateſt part of it is ſeparated from the brine.</p><p>After the pan hath again been filled up with ſea-water, three whites of eggs are mixed with the liquor, by which it is clarified a ſecond time, in the manner before deſcribed; and it is afterwards boiled down to a ſtrong brine as at firſt; which ſecond boiling may take up about four hours.</p><p>The pan is then filled up a third time with clear ſea- water; and after that, a fourth time; the liquor being each time clarified and boiled down to a ſtrong brine, as before related; and the ſcratch-pans being taken out and emptied every time that the pan is filled up.</p><p>Then, at the fourth boiling, as ſoon as the cryſtals begin to form on the ſurface of the brine, they ſlacken the fire, and only ſuffer the brine to ſimmer, or boil very gently. In this heat they conſtantly endeavour to keep it all the time that the ſalt corns or granulates, which may be nine or ten hours. The ſalt is ſaid to granulate, when its minute cryſtals cohere together into little maſſes or grains, which link down in the brine and lie at the bottom of the ſalt pan.</p><p>When moſt of the liquor is evaporated, and the ſalt thus lies in the pan almoſt dry on its ſurface, it is then<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0634.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0628"/>
time to draw it out. This part of the proceſs is performed by raking the ſalt to one fide of the pan into a long heap, where it drains a while from the brine, and is then filled out into barrows or other proper veſſels, and carried into the ſtore-houſe, and delivered into the cuſtody of his majeſty’s officers. And in this manner the whole proceſs is performed in 24 hours; the ſalt being uſually drawn every morning.</p><p>In the ſtore-houſe the ſalt is put hot into drabs, which are partitions like ſtalls for horſes, lined on three ſides and at the bottom with boards, and having a ſliding- board on the fore-ſide to put in or draw out as occaſion requires. The bottoms are made ſhelving, being higheſt at the back-ſide, and gradually inclining forwards; by which means the ſaline liquor, which remains mixed with the ſalt, eaſiiy drains from it; and the ſalt, in three or four days, becomes ſufficiently dry; and is then taken out of the drabs, and laid up in large heaps, where it is ready for ſale.</p><p>The ſaline liquor which drains from the ſalt is not a pure brine of common ſalt, but hath a ſharp and bitter taſte, and is therefore called <hi rend="italic">bittern;</hi> this liquor, at ſome works, they ſave for particular uſes, at others throw away. A conſiderable quantity of this bittern is left at the bottom of the pan after the proceſs is finiſhed; which, as it contains much ſalt, they ſuffer to remain in the pan, when it is filled up with ſea-water. But at each proceſs this liquor becomes more ſharp and bitter, and alſo increaſes in quantity: ſo that, after the third or fourth proceſs is finiſhed, they are obliged to take it out of the pan; otherwiſe it mixes in ſuch quantities with the ſalt, as to give it a bitter taſte, and diſpoſes it to grow ſoft and run in the open air, and renders it unfit for domeſtic uſes.</p><p>After each proceſs there alſo adheres to the bottom and ſides of the pan a white ſtony cruſt, of the ſame calcareous ſubſtance with that before collected from the boiling liquor. This the operators call <hi rend="italic">ſtone-ſcratch,</hi> diſtinguiſhing the other found in the lead-pans by the name of <hi rend="italic">powder-ſcratch.</hi> Once in eight or ten days they ſeparate the ſtone-ſcratch from their pans with iron picks, and in ſeveral places find it a quarter of an inch in thickneſs. If this ſtony cruſt is ſuffered to adhere to the pan much longer, it grows ſo thick that the pan is burnt by the fire, and quickly wears away.</p><p>In M. de Pagés’s Travels round the World, we find the following important fact. “I had been anxious (ſays that author) to aſcertain by compariſon, whether ſea-water contains felt in greater quantity under the torrid than under the other zones; and my experiments on this ſubject ſerved to ſhow, contrary to what I expected, that ſea-water is impregnated with ſalt in leſs quantity within than without the tropics. ” Theſe experiments were made on a hundred pounds of ſea-water, taken at the depth of ten fathoms, and weighed in water-ſcales. M. de Pages has given a table of theſe experiments, from which it appears that 100 lb. of ſea- water in 46⁰ I2'' S. lat. gave 4 <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> lb. of ſalt, and in 1⁰ 16" only 3 <hi rend="superscript"> 1/</hi> <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> lb.; and that in 74 N. lat. it gave 4 <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> lb. and in 4⁰ 22' only 3 <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> lb. theſe being the higheſt and loweſt latitudes in which the experiments were made, and alſo the greateſt and leaſt quantities of ſalt.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Duty</hi> on SALT, is a diſtinct branch of his majeſty’s</p><p>extraordinary revenue, and confiſts in an exciſe of 3 s, 4 d. per buſhel impoſed upon all ſalt, by ſeveral ſtatutes of King William and other ſubſequent reigns. This is not generally called an exciſe, becauſe under the management of different commiſſioners: but the commiſſioners of the ſalt-duties have, hy ſtatute 1 Ann, c. 21. the ſame powers, and muſt obſerve the fame regulations, as thoſe of other exciſes. This tax had uſually been only temporary; but by ſtatute 26 Geo. II. c. 3. was made perpetual.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Triple</hi> <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Salts,</hi> a kind of ſalts formed by the union of three ingredients; the common neutrals being compoſed only of two. They are but lately diſcovered; and it is chiefly to the induſtry of Mr Bergman that we owe the knowledge we have of them. Sometimes we meet even with ſalts of four ingredients; in which cafe we call the reſulting compounds <hi rend="italic">quadruple</hi> ſalts. The moſt remarkable of theſe complicated ſubſtances are the following.</p><p>1. <hi rend="italic">Aphronitrum,</hi> or mineral alkali, combined with a ſmall quantity of calcareous earth. The three ingredients here are fixed air, pure alkali, and calcareous earth. “This ſalt (fays Cronſtedt) is ſo ſtrongly united with the calcareous earth, that the latter enters with it into the very cryſtals of the ſalt; though, by repeated ſolutions, the earth is by degrees ſeparated from it, and falls to the bottom after every ſolution. ” Cartheuſer aſſerts, that, on throwing into its ſolution in water a fixed mineral alkali, the calcareous earth was precipitated; and on the contrary, by adding oil of vitriol, nitrous acid was expelled, and a Glauber’s ſalt produced; “from which (ſays M. Magellan) it is evident, that the aphronitrum is a triple felt ariſing from the combination of the nitrous acid with calcareous earth and mineral fixed alkali. ” Wallerius mentions three ſpecies of this ſalt; <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> one which contains only a mixture of calcareous earth with fixed mineral alkali. This, he ſays, is the aphronitrum of the ancients; but he thinks that it ought to be rather called <hi rend="italic">aphronatron,</hi> as they beſtowed the name of <hi rend="italic">natron</hi> upon the mineral alkali. The ſecond ſpecies is that deſcribed by Cronſtedt under the title of <hi rend="italic">calcareous nitre.</hi> The third is that deſcribed by Hoffman under the title of <hi rend="italic">aphrοnitrum janenſe,</hi> into whoſe compofition the vitriolic acid enters. It is a kind of Glauber’s felt, and is frequently confounded with it.</p><p>The aphronitrum of Cronſtedt is deſcribed by him as appearing on old walls and below vaults, or in places where it cannot be waſhed away by the rain. When it contains any conſiderable quantity of calcareous earth, it ſhoots into rhomboidal cryſtals, a figure frequently affected by the calcareous earth when it ſhoots into cryſtals: but when the aphronitrum is purer, it forms priſmatic cryſtals. From theſe circumſtances, M. Magellan thinks, that the aphronitrum is not only a triple but a multiple felt; as theſe pieces of old mortar, covered with this white froſt, on ancient walls, are the very ſame from which the ſaltpetre-makers extract the mother water of nitre; after mixing with it the vegetable aſhes to furniſh the alkali.</p><p>2. Common ſalt with magnefia, or mineral alkali, contaminated by muriatic magneſia. This is a compound of common felt with magneſia, and is very deliqueſcent, owing to the compound of magneſia and ſpi-<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0635.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0629"/>
rit of ſalt; for neither mineral alkali nor pure ſea-ſalt are at all deliqueſcent in the air.</p><p>3. Vitriolated magneſia with vitriol of iron, or Epſom ſalt contaminated with copperas. This, according to M. Monet, is found in ſome mineral waters.</p><p>4. Native alum contaminated with copperas. This is ſometimes found in the aluminous ſchiſtus, and efflo- reſces in a feathery form, and is perhaps the plumoſe alum of the ancients.</p><p>5. Native alum contaminated with ſulphur. Dr Withering informs us, that this ſalt is met with about Wednegburg and Belſton, two places in Staffordſhire, where the coal-pits are on fire. It ſublimes to the ſurface, whence it may be collected in conſiderable quantity during dry or froſty weather. Our author, however, does not certainly affirm that this is a true chemical union, but the parts, he ſays, cannot be diſtinguiſhed by the eye. It is kept in a deliqueſcent ſtate by an acceſs of vitriolic acid.</p><p>6. Native alum contaminated by vitriolated cobalt. This is found in ſome of the mines of Herregrund and Idria, where it ſhoots into long and ſlender filaments. M. Magellan ſuppoſes that this may be the <hi rend="italic">trichites</hi> of the Greeks. On diſſolving it in water, the preſence of the vitriolic acid is diſcovered by adding a ſolution of terra ponderoſa in muriatic acid; the phlogiſticated alkali throws down a precipitate of cobalt, which forms a blue glaſs with cobalt or microcoſmic ſalt.</p><p>7. Vitriol of copper with iron, the <hi rend="italic">vitrolurn ferreo-cupreum cyaneum</hi> oſ Linnaeus. It is alſo called <hi rend="italic">Vitriol of Hungary,</hi> becauſe found in plenty in that country. Its colour is that of blue mixed with green; but ſometimes the one ſhade prevails, and ſometimes the other.</p><p>8. Vitriol of copper, iron, and zinc, is prepared in Sweden from the water pumped out of the copper mines at Dalame. The copper does not precipitate from a ſolution of this ſalt by rubbing it on iron, as is the caſe with the common blue vitriol. Large cryſtals of this ſalt are often found in the water, the copper mines from whence it is prepared.</p><p>9. Vitriol of copper and zinc. This is a quadruple ſalt, ſtyled by Linnaeus <hi rend="italic">Vitriolum ferreo-zinceo cupreum cyaneum.</hi> Its colour is blue inclining to green; and it does not precipitate the copper by rubbing on iron, as the common blue vitriol does. It is called the blue vitriol of Goſlar. Mongez makes a ſeparate article of a compound ſalt mentioned by Wallerius, conſiſting alſo of a vitriolated copper with zinc, but whoſe cryſtals are of a fine red colour, found lately in the mines of Fahlun in Sweden. He adds, that the pale-blue colour of the former ſalt ſhows the predominancy of the copper, by which it is neceſſarily diſtinguiſhed from the latter, where the vitriol is over-ſaturated. M. Magellan, however, is of opinion, that the red colour is owing to a proper quantity of iron in a dephlogiſticated ſtate, which has been overlooked in that compound. To this kind alſo Wallerius refers the yellowiſh vitriol found in Hungary.</p><p>10. Vitriol of iron and zinc; the green vitriol from Goſlar in the Hartz; the <hi rend="italic">vitreolum zinceo-ferreum viride</hi> of Linnaeus. It is of a pale-green colour.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
