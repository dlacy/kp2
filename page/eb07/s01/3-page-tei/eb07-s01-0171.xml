Of the <hi rend="italic">counties,</hi> the origin of which is very ancient, and has not been ascertained, a list, and other particulars respecting them, have already been given. They are thirty-three in number, but most of them are subdivided by local acts of parliament into two or more districts, for the purpose of police and internal economy ; and several of them comprehend a variety of territorial divisions, founded on the natural circumstances of the country. Thus the county of Berwick is popularly divided into the three districts of the Merse, Lauderdale, and Lammermuir ; Lanarkshire into the upper, middle, and lower wards ; Ayrshire into Kyle, Cunningham, and Carrick ; and in the extensive Highland counties, the subdivisions are still more numerous. There is no trace in Scotland of the minor divisions of the English counties, called hundreds, wapentakes, and the like. Of the judicial divisions of Scotland an account will be found in this article under the head of Judicial Establishments. Respecting the date of the erection of <hi rend="italic">parishes,</hi> there have been various conjectures. They were purely an ecclesiastical regulation, and could not have been formed till the Christian system had been generally received, and its preachers become numerous ; and as this division, and the necessary previous ecclesiastical establishment, infer no inconsiderable degree of civilization, it is highly probable that it did</p><p>not take place before the ninth or the tenth century.@@<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> Mr. Chalmers supposes that parishes were gradually formed after the year 843 ; but that they existed in the time of Malcolm III., who died in 1093, is ascertained by authentic records.@@<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> The number of parishes has not been uniform. Previously to the Reformation the bishops possessed the power of uniting or disjoining parishes. Between this period and the Union, in 1707, the authority was transferred from the bishops and vested in several successive commissions of the Scottish parliament. In 1707, parliament vested this power in the Court of Session, but confined the power of the court to cases where consent had previously been given by persons possessing three-fourths of the valued rental of the parish ; and this is the existing law. The disjoining or union of parishes is, therefore, attended with considerable difficulty, and very rarely takes place, except in cities where the consent of the municipal authorities, if patrons of the parish, and of the presbytery of the bounds, is sufficient for the purpose. Hence in Edinburgh five new parishes have been erected out of the parish of St. Cuthbert’s, within the last forty years. The number of parishes is at present 916, exclusive of what arc commonly called <hi rend="italic">quoad sacra</hi> parishes. These latter parishes have been formed in either of the two following ways. First, owing to the inconvenient extent of parishes in the Highlands, and the consequent distance of many of the people from the parish church, missionaries</p><p><hi rend="superscript">@@@,</hi> Murray's Literary History of Galloway, 2d edit. 1832, p. 7.	</p><p>@@@* Caledonia, vol. i. p. 23.</p></body></text></TEI>
