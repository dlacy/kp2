<p><span class="font1">4∙ Tire depths RF, </span><span class="font0">GH, &amp;c. in different parts of the ſtream, will be nearly in the inverſe ſubduplicate&nbsp;ratio of the depths under the ſurface AN: for ſince&nbsp;the ſame quantity of water is running through every&nbsp;ſection FF and GH, and the channel is ſuppoſed of&nbsp;uniform breadth, the depth of each ſection muſt be in-verſely as the velocity of the water paſſing through it.&nbsp;This velocity is indeed different in different filaments of&nbsp;the ſection; but the mean velocity in each ſection is in&nbsp;the ſubduplicate ratio of the depth of the filament under the ſurface AB. Therefore the ſtream becomes&nbsp;more ſhallow as it recedes from the ſource; and in conſequence of this the difference between LH and MG&nbsp;continually diminiſhes, and the velocities at the bottom&nbsp;and ſurface of the ſtream continually approach to equality, and at a great diſtance from the ſource they differ&nbsp;inſenſibly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the breadth of the ſtream be contracted in any&nbsp;part, the depth of the running water will be increaſed&nbsp;in that part, becauſe the ſame quantity muſt ſtill paſs&nbsp;through ; but the velocity at the bottom will remain the ſame, and that at the ſurface will be leſs than&nbsp;it was before ; and the area of the ſection will be increaſed on the whole.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should a ſluice be put acroſs the ſtream, dipping&nbsp;a little into the water, the water muſt immediately riſe&nbsp;on the upper ſide of the ſluice till it riſes above the level&nbsp;of the reſervoir, and the ſmalleſt immerſion of the ſluice&nbsp;will produce this effect. For by lowering the ſluice, the&nbsp;area of the ſection is diminiſhed, and the velocity cannot be increaſed till the water heap up to a greater&nbsp;height than the ſurſace of the reſervoir, and this acquires a preſſure which will produce a greater velocity&nbsp;of efflux through the orifice left below the ſluice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">An additional quantity of water coming into this&nbsp;channel will increaſe the depth of the ſtream, and the&nbsp;quantity of water which it conveys; but it will not increaſe the velocity of the bottom filaments, unleſs it&nbsp;comes from a higher ſource.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">All theſe conſequences are contrary to experience, and ſhow the imperfection, at leaſt, of the explanation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The third conſequence is of all the moſt contrary to experience. If any one will but take the trouble of&nbsp;following a ſingle brook from its ſource to the ſea, he&nbsp;wall find it moſt rapid in its beginnings among the&nbsp;mountains, gradually ſlackening its pace as it winds&nbsp;among the hills and gentler declivities, and at laſt&nbsp;creeping ſlowly along through the flat grounds, till&nbsp;it is checked and brought to reſt by the tides of&nbsp;the ocean.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Nor is the ſecond conſequence more agreeable to obſervation. It is univerſally found, that the velocity of the ſurface in the middle of the ſtream is the greateſt&nbsp;of all, and that it gradually diminiſhes from thence to&nbsp;the bottom and ſides.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">And the firſt conſequence, if'true, would render the running waters on the ſurface of this earth the inſtruments of immediate ruin and devaſtation. If the waters of our rivers, in the cultivated parts of a country,&nbsp;which are two, three, and four hundred feet lower than&nbsp;their ſources, run with the velocity due to that height,&nbsp;they would in a few minutes lay the earth bare to the&nbsp;very bones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The velocities of our rivers, brooks, and rills, being &lt;b </span><span class="font1">.greatly inferior to what this theory a</span><span class="font0">ſſ</span><span class="font1">igns to them</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">the other conſequences </span><span class="font1">are equally contrary to experi</span><span class="font0">ence. When a ſtream has its ſection diminiſhed by narrowing the channel, the current increaſes in depth, and this is always accompanied by an increaſe of velocity&nbsp;through the whole of the ſection, and moſt of all at the&nbsp;ſurface ; and the area of the ſection does not increaſe,&nbsp;but diminiſhes, all the phenomena, thus contradicting in&nbsp;every circumſtance the deduction from the theory ; and&nbsp;when the ſection has been diminiſhed by a ſluice let&nbsp;down into the ſtream, the water gradually heaps up on&nbsp;the upper ſide of the ſluice, and, by its preſſure, produces an acceleration of the ſtream below the ſluice, in&nbsp;the ſame way as if it were the beginning of a ſtream, as&nbsp;explained in the theory. The velocity now is compoſed of the velocity preſerved from the ſource and the&nbsp;velocity produced by this ſubordinate accumulation ;&nbsp;and this accumulation and velocity continually increaſe,&nbsp;till they become ſuch that the whole ſupply is again&nbsp;diſcharged through this contracted ſection : any additional water not only increaſes the quantity carried&nbsp;along the ſtream, but alſo increaſes the velocity, and&nbsp;therefore the ſection does not increaſe in the proportion&nbsp;of the quantity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is ſurpriſing that a theory really founded on a conceit, and which in every the moſt familiar and obvious circumſtance is contradicted by facts, ſhould -have&nbsp;met with ſo much attention. That Varignon ſhould&nbsp;immediately catch at this notion of Guglielmini, and&nbsp;make it the ſubject of many elaborate analytical memoirs, is not to be wondered at. This author only wanted </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">donner ρr if e au calcul ;</span><span class="font0"> and it was a ufual joke among&nbsp;the academicians of Paris, when any new theorem was&nbsp;invented, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">donnons le à Varignon à generalifer.</span><span class="font0"> But his&nbsp;numeι<sup>-</sup>ous theorems and corollaries were adopted by all,&nbsp;and ſtill make the ſubſtance of the preſent ſyſtems of&nbsp;hydraulics. Graveſande, Muſhenbroek, and all the elementary treatiſes of natural philoſophy, deliver no other&nbsp;doctrines ; and Belidor, who has been conſidered as the&nbsp;firſt of all the ſcientiſic engineers, details the ſame&nbsp;theory in his great work the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Λrclntefture Hydraulique.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Guglielmini was, however, not altogether the dupe of his own ingenuity. He was not only a pretty good&nbsp;mathematician, but an aſſiduous and ſagacious obſerver.&nbsp;He had applied his theory to ſome important caſes&nbsp;which occurred in the courſe of his profeſſion as in-ſpector of the rivers and canals in the Milaneſe, and to&nbsp;the courſe of the Danube; and could not but perceive&nbsp;that great corrections were neceſſary for making the&nbsp;theory quadrate in ſome tolerable manner with obſervation ; and he immediately ſaw that the motion was&nbsp;greatly obſtructed by inequalities of the canal, which&nbsp;gave to the contiguous filaments of the ſtream tranſ-verſe motions, which thwarted and confuſed the regular&nbsp;progreſs of the reſt of the ſtream, and thus checked its&nbsp;general progreſs. Theſe obſtructions, he obſerved,&nbsp;were moſt effectual in the beginning of its courſe, while&nbsp;yet a ſmall rill, running among ſtones, and in a veιγ&nbsp;unequal bed. The whole ſtream being ſmall, the inequalities bore a great proportion to it, and thus the general effect was great. He alſo ſaw that the ſame cauſes (theſe tranſverſe motions produced by the unequal&nbsp;bottom) chiefly affected the contiguous filaments, and&nbsp;were the reaſons why the velocity at the ſides and bottom was ſo much diminiſhed as to be leſs than the ſu-</span><span class="font1">perſicial velocity, and </span><span class="font0">that </span><span class="font1">even this might </span><span class="font0">come to be</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
