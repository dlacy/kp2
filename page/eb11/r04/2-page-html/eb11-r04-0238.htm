<p><span class="font2">centre, St Jerome in the wilderness kneeling before a crucifix, and at the sides standing figures of St Damasus and St Eusebius,&nbsp;St Paolo and St Eustachia; below is a predella with small&nbsp;subjects. Though dry and hard in treatment, the figures are&nbsp;designed with much dignity. The Berlin Gallery possesses three&nbsp;pictures by Rosselli: “The Virgin in Glory/* “ The Entombment of&nbsp;Christ/* and “ The Massacre of the Innocents.” In 1480 Rosselli,&nbsp;together with the chief painters of Florence, was invited by&nbsp;Sixtus IV. to Rome to assist in the painting of the frescoes in&nbsp;the Sistine Chapel. Three of these were executed by him—“ The&nbsp;Destruction of Pharaoh’s Army in the Red Sea/* “ Christ Preaching by the Lake of Tiberias,” and “ The Last Supper.” The last&nbsp;of these is well preserved, but is a mediocre work. Vasari’s story&nbsp;about the pope admiring Rosselli*s paintings more than those&nbsp;of his abler brother painters has probably little foundation.&nbsp;Rosselli’s Sistine frescoes were partly painted by his assistant&nbsp;Piero di Cosimo, who was so called after Cosimo Rosselli. His&nbsp;chief pupil was Fra Bartolommeo. According to Vasari, Rosselli&nbsp;died in 1484, but this is a mistake, as his will exists dated&nbsp;25th of November 1506 (see Gaye, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Car. ined.</span><span class="font2"> ii. 457 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">n.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">For an account of Rosselli’s Sistine frescoes, see Platner and Bunsen, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Beschreibung der Stadt Rom,</span><span class="font2"> ii. pt. i.; and Rumohr, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Italien.&nbsp;Forschungen,</span><span class="font2"> ii. 265.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ROSSELLINO, ANTONIO </span><span class="font2">(1427-c. 1479), Florentine sculptor, was the son of Matteo di Domenico Gamberclli, and had four&nbsp;brothers, who all practised some branch of the fine arts. Almost&nbsp;nothing is known about the life of Antonio, but many of his&nbsp;works exist, and are full of religious sentiment, and executed&nbsp;with the utmost delicacy of touch and technical skill. The&nbsp;style of Antonio and his brother Bernardo is a development of&nbsp;that of Donatello and Ghiberti; it possesses all the refinement&nbsp;and sweetness of the earlier masters, but is not equal to them&nbsp;in vigour or originality. Antonio’s chief work, still in perfect&nbsp;preservation, is the lovely tomb of a young cardinal prince of&nbsp;Portugal, who died in 1459. It occupies one side of a small&nbsp;chapel, also built by Rossellino, on the north of the nave of San&nbsp;Miniato al Monte.@@<sup>1</sup> The recumbent effigy of the cardinal rests&nbsp;on a handsome sarcophagus, and over it, under the arch which&nbsp;frames the whole, is a beautiful relief of the Madonna between&nbsp;two flying angels. The tomb was begun in 146T and finished&nbsp;in 1466; Antonio received four hundred and twenty-five&nbsp;gold florins for it. A reproduction of this tomb with slight</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">alterations, and of course a different effigy, was made by Antonio for the wife of Antonio Piccolomini, duke of Amalfi, in the&nbsp;church of S. Maria del Monte at Naples, where it still exists.&nbsp;For the same church he also executed some delicate reliefs,&nbsp;which perhaps err in being too pictorial in style, especially in&nbsp;the treatment of the backgrounds. A fine medallion relief by&nbsp;him in marble, originally modelled in terra-cotta, is preserved&nbsp;in the Bargello at Florence (see fig.).</span></p><div>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bernardo Rossellino</span><span class="font2"> (1409-1464), Florentine sculptor, was no less able than his younger brother Antonio. I?is finest&nbsp;piece of sculpture is the tomb, in the Florentine Santa Croce,&nbsp;of Leonardo Bruni of Arezzo, the historian of Florence, executed&nbsp;in 1443 some years after Bruni’s death; the recumbent effigy&nbsp;is of great merit. The inner cathedral pulpit at Prato, circular&nbsp;in form on a tall slender stem, was partly the work of Mino da&nbsp;Fiesole and partly by Bernardo Rossellino. The latter executed&nbsp;the minute reliefs of St Stephen and the Assumption of the&nbsp;Virgin. For his part in the work he received sixty-six gold&nbsp;florins. The South Kensington Museum possesses a relief&nbsp;by Bernardo, signed and dated (1456). It is a fine portrait of&nbsp;the physician Giovanni da S. Miniato. Bernardo’s works as an&nbsp;architect were numerous and important, and he was also a&nbsp;skilful military engineer. He restored the church of S. Francis&nbsp;at Assisi, and designed several fine buildings at Civita Vecchia,&nbsp;Orvieto and elsewhere. He also built fortresses and city walls&nbsp;at Spoleto, Orvieto and Civita Castellana. He was largely&nbsp;employed by Nicholas V. and Pius II. for restorations in nearly&nbsp;all the great basilicas of Rome, but little trace of his work&nbsp;remains, owing to the sweeping alterations made during the&nbsp;17th and 18th centuries. Between the years i46r and 1464&nbsp;(when he died while engaged on the Lazzari monument at&nbsp;Pistoia) he occupied the important post of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">capo-maestro</span><span class="font2"> to the&nbsp;Florentine duomo. A number of buildings at Pienza, executed&nbsp;for Pius II., are attributed to him; the Vatican registers&nbsp;mention the architect of these as M° Bernardo di Fiorenza, but&nbsp;this indication is too slight to make it certain that the elder&nbsp;Rossellino is referred to (see Vasari, ed. Milanesi, iii. 93 seq.).</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">ROSSETTI, CHRISTINA GEORGINA (1830^1894), English poet, was the youngest of the four children of Gabriele Rossetti&nbsp;(see the article on her brother </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dante Gabriel Rossetti).</span><span class="font2"> She&nbsp;was bom at 38 Charlotte Street, Portland Place, London, on&nbsp;the 5th of December 1830. She enjoyed the advantages and&nbsp;disadvantages of the strange society of Italian exiles and&nbsp;English eccentrics, which her father gathered about him, and&nbsp;she shared the studies of her gifted elder brother and sister.&nbsp;As early as 1847 her grandfather, Gaetano Polidori, printed&nbsp;privately a volume of her </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Verses,</span><span class="font2"> in which the richness of her&nbsp;vision was already faintly prefigured. In 1850 she contributed&nbsp;to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Germ</span><span class="font2"> seven pieces, including some of the finest of her&nbsp;lyrics. In her girlhood she had a grave, religious beauty of&nbsp;feature, and sat as a model not only to her brother Gabriel,&nbsp;but to Holman Hunt, to Madox Brown and to Millais. In&nbsp;1853-54 Christina Rossetti for nearly a year helped her mother&nbsp;to keep a day-school at Frome-Selwood, in Somerset. Early&nbsp;in 1854 the Rossettis returned to London, and the father died.&nbsp;In poverty, in ill-health, in extreme quietness, she was now&nbsp;performing her b'fe-work. She was twice sought in marriage,&nbsp;but each time, from religious scruples (she was a strong high-church Anglican), she refused her suitor; on the former of&nbsp;these occasions she sorrowed greatly, and her suffering is&nbsp;reflected in much of her early song. In 1861 she saw foreign&nbsp;countries for the first time, paying a six weeks’ visit to Nor-<sup>r&nbsp;</sup>mandy and Paris. In 1862 she published what was practically&nbsp;her earliest book, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Goblin Market,</span><span class="font2"> and took her place at once&nbsp;among the poets of her age. In this volume, indeed, is still to&nbsp;be found a majority of her finest writings. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Prince's&nbsp;Progress</span><span class="font2"> followed io 1866. In 1867 she, with her family,&nbsp;moved to 56 Euston Square, which became their home for&nbsp;many years. Christina’s prose work </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Commonplace</span><span class="font2"> appeared&nbsp;in 1870. In April 1871 her whole life was changed by a terrible&nbsp;affliction, known as “ Graves’s disease ”; for two years her&nbsp;life was in constant danger. She had already composed her&nbsp;book of children’s poems, entitled </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sing-Song,</span><span class="font2"> which appeared</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
