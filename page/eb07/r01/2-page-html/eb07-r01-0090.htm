<p><span class="font0">to a mutual toleration of their sentiments, and leaving to the disposal of Providence the cure of their divisions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the mean time, news were received that the emperor designed to come into Germany, with a view to terminate&nbsp;all religious differences at the approaching Diet of Augsburg. Having foreseen some of the consequences of those&nbsp;disputes, and, besides, taken the opinion of men of wisdom,&nbsp;sagacity, and experience, he became at certain times more&nbsp;cool in his proceedings, and more impartial in his opinions&nbsp;respecting the contending parties and the merits of the&nbsp;cause. He, therefore, in an interview with the pope at&nbsp;Bologna, insisted, in the most serious and urgent manner,&nbsp;on the necessity of a general council. His remonstrances&nbsp;and expostulations, however, could not move the pontiff,&nbsp;who maintained with zeal the papal prerogatives ; reproached the emperor with an ill-judged clemency ; and alleged&nbsp;that it was the duty of that prince to support the church,&nbsp;and to execute speedy vengeance upon that obstinate heretical faction who had dared to call in question the authority of Rome. To this discourse the emperor paid no regard,&nbsp;looking upon it as a most iniquitous thing, and a measure&nbsp;directly opposite to the laws of the empire, to condemn unheard so many men who had always approved themselves&nbsp;good citizens, and in other respects deserved well of their&nbsp;country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Hitherto indeed it was not easy for the emperor to form a clear idea of the matters in debate, since no regular system had as yet been composed, by which it might be&nbsp;known with certainty what were the true causes of Luther’s opposition to the pope. The Elector of Saxony,&nbsp;therefore, ordered Luther, and other eminent divines, to&nbsp;commit to writing the chief articles of their religious system, and the principal points in which they differed from&nbsp;the Church of Rome. Luther, in compliance with this order, delivered to the elector at Torgau seventeen articles&nbsp;which had been agreed upon in a conference at Sulzbach&nbsp;in 1529, and hence these received the name of the Articles&nbsp;of Torgau. But though these were deemed by Luther a&nbsp;sufficient declaration of the sentiments of the reformers,&nbsp;yet it was judged proper to enlarge them, in order to give&nbsp;perspicuity to their arguments, and strength to their cause.&nbsp;In this work Melancthon was employed ; but in it he showed&nbsp;a proper deference to the counsels of Luther, expressing&nbsp;his sentiments and doctrine with the greatest elegance and&nbsp;perspicuity, and thus came forth the famous Confession of&nbsp;Augsburg.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On the l5th of June 1530, Charles arrived at Augsburg, - and the diet was opened five days afterwards. The Protestants received a formal permission to present an account&nbsp;of their tenets to the diet on the 25th of the same month ;&nbsp;and in consequence of this, at the time appointed, Christian&nbsp;Bayer, chancellor of Saxony, read aloud, in the German language, before the emperor and the princes assembled, the&nbsp;Confession of Augsburg above mentioned. It contained&nbsp;twenty-eight chapters, of which twenty-one were employed in representing the religious opinions of the Protestants,&nbsp;and the other seven in pointing out tile errors and superstitions of the Church of Rome. The princes heard it with&nbsp;the deepest attention. It confirmed some in the principles&nbsp;which they had embraced ; it surprised others, who had not&nbsp;given much consideration to the subject ; and many, who&nbsp;before this time had little or no idea of the religious sentiments of Luther, were now not only convinced of their innocence, but delighted with their purity and simplicity. The&nbsp;copies of this Confession, after being read, were delivered&nbsp;to the emperor, being signed by John elector of Saxony,&nbsp;George marquis of Brandenburg, Ernest duke of Lunenburg, Philip landgrave of Hesse, Wolfgang prince of Anhalt,&nbsp;and by the imperial cities of Nuremberg and Reutlingen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The creatures of the Church of Rome who were present at this diet employed John Faber, afterwards bishop of</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Vienna, together with Eckius<sub>1</sub> and another doctor, to draw up a refutation of the Protestant Confession ; and this having been publicly read, the emperor required the Protestant members to acquiesce in it, and put an end to the&nbsp;religious disputes by an unlimited submission to the opinions and doctrines contained in this answer. But this&nbsp;demand was far from being complied with. The Protestants, on the contrary, declared that they were by no means&nbsp;satisfied with the reply of their adversaries, and earnestly&nbsp;desired a copy of it, that they might more fully demonstrate its extreme insufficiency and weakness. But this&nbsp;reasonable request was refused by the emperor, who interposed his supreme authority to prevent any further proceedings in this matter, and solemnly prohibited the publication of any new writings or declarations which might&nbsp;contribute to protract these religious debates. This, however, did not reduce the Protestants to silence. The divines of that communion who had been present at the diet&nbsp;endeavoured to recollect the arguments and objections employed by Faber, and had again recourse to the pen of&nbsp;Melancthon, who refuted them in an ample and satisfactory&nbsp;manner, in a piece which was presented to the emperor on&nbsp;the 22d of September, but which Charles refused to receive.&nbsp;This answer was afterwards enlarged by Melancthon, when&nbsp;he had obtained a copy of Faber’s reply ; and was published in the year 1531, with the other pieces that related to&nbsp;the doctrine and discipline of the Lutheran church, under&nbsp;the title of Defence of the Confession of Augsburg.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Matters now began to draw tow ards a crisis. There were only three ways of bringing to a conclusion these religious&nbsp;differences : First, to grant the Protestants a toleration and&nbsp;privilege of serving God as they thought proper ; secondly, to compel them to return to the Church of Rome by the&nbsp;violent methods of persecution ; or, thirdly, that a reconciliation should be made, upon fair, and candid, and equitable&nbsp;terms, by engaging each of the parties to temper their zeal&nbsp;with moderation, to abate reciprocally the rigour of their&nbsp;pretensions, and to remit something of their respective&nbsp;claims. The third expedient was most generally approved&nbsp;of, being peculiarly agreeable to all who had at heart the&nbsp;welfare of the empire ; nor did even the pope seem to look&nbsp;upon it with aversion or contempt. Various conferences&nbsp;therefore were held between persons eminent for piety and&nbsp;learning upon both sides ; and nothing was omitted which&nbsp;might have the least tendency to calm the animosities and&nbsp;heal the divisions which reigned between the contending&nbsp;parties. But the differences were too great to admit of a&nbsp;reconciliation ; and therefore the votaries of Rome had recourse to the powerful arguments of imperial edicts, and the&nbsp;force of the secular arm. On the 19th of November, a severe decree was issued by order of the emperor, in which&nbsp;everything was manifestly adapted to deject the friends of&nbsp;religious liberty, excepting only a faint and dubious promise of engaging the pope to assemble a general council&nbsp;about six months after the separation of the diet. In this&nbsp;decree the dignity and excellence of the Catholic religion&nbsp;were extolled beyond measure ; a new degree of severity&nbsp;and force was added to that which had been published at&nbsp;Worms against Luther and his adherents ; the changes&nbsp;which had been introduced into the doctrine and discipline&nbsp;of the Protestant churches were severely censured ; and a&nbsp;solemn order was addressed to the princes, cities, and states,&nbsp;who had thrown off the papal yoke, to return to their allegiance to Rome, on pain of incurring the indignation and&nbsp;vengeance of the emperor, as the patron and protector of&nbsp;the church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Of this formidable decree the Elector of Saxony and the confederated princes were no sooner informed than they&nbsp;assembled in order to deliberate on the measures proper to&nbsp;be taken in such an emergency. In the years 1530 and 1531&nbsp;they met, first at Smalcald, and afterwards at Francfort,</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
