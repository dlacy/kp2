By the time of the Union in 1707 it is supposed to have reached 1,000,000, while according to the returns furnished by the clergy to Dr Webster in 1755 it was 1,265,380. At the time of the first Government census in 1801 it had reached 1,608,420. The increase through all the succeeding decades has been continuous, though fluctuating in amount, and in 1881 it had reached 3,735,573 (males 1,799,475, females 1,936,098),—an increase within the eighty years of 132 per cent. During the same period the population of England and Wales had increased 192 per cent., while the population of Ireland, owing to a rapid decrease since 1841, does not now differ greatly from what it was at the beginning of the century. The following table (I.) gives the areas of the various counties and of the whole of Scotland, the population in 1871 and 1881, the number of persons to the square mile of land-surface in the latter year, and the increase or decrease per cent. between 1871 and 1881 :—</p><table><row><cell>Counties.</cell><cell>Area in Acres.</cell><cell cols="2">Population.</cell><cell>Pop. per Sq.

The census returns for these years do not supply materials for an accurate estimate as to the increase of the purely rural or agricultural population, but it must have been considerable. Between 1841 and 1881 the following counties declined in population:—Argyll, Inverness, Kinross, Perth, Ross and Cromarty, Sutherland, and Wigtown,—all chiefly agricultural, and five of them in the Highlands, where much of the land was held by crofters. Only one county, Kinross, has a smaller population in 1881 than in 1801. Between 1851 and 1881 the island population, chiefly crofters, decreased by 4866, and the rural population between 1861 and 1881 by 125,583. In the following Highland counties the diminution in rural population between 1861 and 1881 was as follows :—Argyll from 60,109 to 46,081, Caithness from 28,279 to 24,309, Inverness from 74,439 to 67,355, Perth from 69,480 to 57,016, Ross and Cromarty from 59,147 to 49,882, and Sutherland from 21,560 to 18,696. In the total population of Scotland the rate of increase was considerably less between 1841 and 1881 than during the first forty years of the century,—42·5 to 62·9 per cent. The rates per cent. of increase in the several decades from 1801 have been as follows :—12·27, 15·82, 13·04, 10·82, 10·25, 6,9·72, and 11·18. The high rate of increase between 1871 and 1881 was due to an exceptional briskness of trade, and unless it has been maintained (which is not probable) the estimate of the registrar-general, which makes the population in 1885 number 3,907,736, must be regarded as much too sanguine. Table III. (see below) gives the population of the eight largest towns of Scotland at decennial periods since 1801. It is a curious fact that each of these towns has maintained its place in the “eight,” although several towns now tread closely on the heels of Perth, whose rate of progress with that of Paisley has lagged greatly behind that of the other six.</p><p>While in England and Wales the number of persons to the square mile in 1881 was 452 and in Ireland 159, in Scotland the number was only 125. The small density of Scotland is due chiefly to the large proportion of mountainous land. In the north-western counties the density was only 23 to the square mile, in the northern 34, in the west midland 68, in the southern 68, while in the northeastern it was 115, in the east midland 149, in the south-eastern 299, and in the south-western—Renfrew, Ayr, and Lanark—614. Table IV. (see p. 529) shows by the excess of births over deaths the increase that should have taken place between 1861 and 1871, and between 1871 and 1881 (but for the balance of emigration over immigration), compared with the actual increase, the grouping being into towns with over 25,000 inhabitants, towns between 10,000 and 25,000, towns under 10,000 and above 2000, and rural districts. It is impossible to make a comparison between 1861 and 1881 inasmuch as the proportion of large and small towns and rural districts has varied. It must also be explained that in comparing 1861 and 1871 the census of 1861 is taken as the authority for the grouping and in comparing 1871 and 1881 the census of 1871. This table shows in both decades an actual increase in the large and in the principal towns greater than that resulting from excess of births over deaths. It is the result not only of migration from the small towns and rural districts but of the immigration of English, Irish, and foreigners, and the return of natives of Scotland from abroad. By a comparison with Table II. it will be observed that the increase in the rural districts between the decades in Table IV. occurs only in the villages, and a closer examination of Table IV. further shows that any seeming increase is really delusive, and arises from the fact that there is no provision for the increase in</p><table><row><cell cols="11"><hi rend="smallcaps">Table</hi> III.</cell></row><row><cell>Name.</cell><cell>1801.</cell><cell>1811.</cell><cell>1821.</cell><cell>1831.</cell><cell>1841.</cell><cell>1851.</cell><cell>1861.</cell><cell>1871.</cell><cell>1881.</cell><cell><p>Estimate</p><p>1885.</p></cell></row><row><cell><p>Edinburgh </p><p>Leith	</p><p>Glasgow	</p><p>Aberdeen 	</p><p>Dundee 	</p><p>Paislev	</p><p>Greenock 	</p><p>Perth 	</p></cell><cell><p>81,404</p><p>77,058</p><p>26,992</p><p>27,390</p><p>25,058</p><p>17,190</p><p>16,3S8</p></cell><cell><p>101,492</p><p>103,224</p><p>34,640</p><p>31,058</p><p>29,461</p><p>18,750</p><p>16,564</p></cell><cell><p>136,351</p><p>140,432</p><p>43,821</p><p>32,126</p><p>38,102</p><p>21,719</p><p>18,197</p></cell><cell><p>136,548 25,855</p><p>193,030</p><p>56,681</p><p>48,026</p><p>46,222</p><p>27.082</p><p>19,238</p></cell><cell><p>132,977</p><p>25,984</p><p>261,004</p><p>63,288</p><p>64,629</p><p>48,263</p><p>36,169</p><p>20,407</p></cell><cell><p>160,302</p><p>30,919</p><p>329,097</p><p>71,973</p><p>78,931</p><p>47,952</p><p>36,689</p><p>23,835</p></cell><cell><p>168,121</p><p>33,028</p><p>394,864</p><p>73,805</p><p>90,417</p><p>47,406</p><p>42,098</p><p>25,250</p></cell><cell><p>196,979</p><p>44,280</p><p>477,156</p><p>88,108</p><p>118,977</p><p>48,240</p><p>57,146</p><p>25,585</p></cell><cell><p>22S,357</p><p>59,485</p><p>551,415</p><p>105,189</p><p>140,239</p><p>55,638</p><p>66,704</p><p>28,980</p></cell><cell><p>250,616</p><p>68,414</p><p>519,965</p><p>113,212</p><p>152,838</p><p>59,108</p><p>73,695</p><p>31,322</p></cell></row></table></body></text></TEI>
