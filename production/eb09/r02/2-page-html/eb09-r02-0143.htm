<p><span class="font1">ROACH </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Leuciscus rutilw),</span><span class="font1"> a fish of the family of Carps </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Cyprinidæ)</span><span class="font1"> and of the genus </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Leuciscus,</span><span class="font1"> which comprises&nbsp;also the Rudd, Chub, and Dace. It is one of the most&nbsp;common freshwater fishes of Europe north of the Alps,&nbsp;and extends northwards as far as Lapland. Its pharyngeal&nbsp;teeth are in a single series, five or six on each side. The&nbsp;body is generally rather deep, its greatest depth being&nbsp;about one-third of the total length, the caudal fin not&nbsp;included. The scales are large, from forty-two to forty-four along the lateral line, seven or eight series being&nbsp;above it, and three between the lateral line and ventral fin.&nbsp;The first dorsal rays are inserted vertically above, but not&nbsp;in advance of the root of the ventral fin. The anal fin&nbsp;is supported by from twelve to fourteen rays. The&nbsp;general colour is silvery, in adult fishes with a red tinge&nbsp;about the lower fins. Roach spawn from April to May,&nbsp;and frequently produce hybrids with other allied fishes,&nbsp;such as the rudd and the bream. They never attain to a&nbsp;large size, a roach of 1 ⅜ II) being considered an unusually&nbsp;large fish. As a food-fish this species is not held in esteem ;&nbsp;but by the pleasure it affords to a large class of humble&nbsp;anglers it rivals any of the freshwater fishes which give&nbsp;more pretentious sport, and has properly been made the&nbsp;subject of a special work, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Book of the Roach,</span><span class="font1"> by&nbsp;Greville Fennell (London, 1870).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROADS and STREETS. The earliest roads about which anything definite is known are those of ancient&nbsp;Rome, one of the oldest of which and the most celebrated&nbsp;for the grandeur of its works—the Appian Way—was commenced in 312 B.c. Roman roads are remarkable for preserving a straight course from point to point regardless of&nbsp;obstacles which might have been easily avoided. They&nbsp;appear to have been often laid out in a line with some prominent landmark, and their general straightness is perhaps&nbsp;due to convenience in setting them out. In solidity of&nbsp;construction they have never been excelled, and many of&nbsp;them still remain, often forming the foundation of a more&nbsp;modern road, and in some instances constituting the road&nbsp;surface now used. It is consequently possible, with the&nbsp;help of allusions of ancient writers, to follow the mode of&nbsp;construction. Two parallel trenches were first cut to mark&nbsp;the breadth of the road ; loose earth was removed until a&nbsp;solid foundation was reached ; and it was replaced by&nbsp;proper material consolidated by ramming, or other means&nbsp;were taken to form a solid foundation for the body of the&nbsp;road. This appears as a rule to have been composed of four&nbsp;layers, generally of local materials, though sometimes they&nbsp;were brought from considerable distances. The lowest&nbsp;layer consisted of two or three courses of flat stones, or,&nbsp;when these were not obtainable, of other stones, generally&nbsp;laid in mortar ; the second layer was composed of rubble&nbsp;masonry of smaller stones, or a coarse concrete ; the third&nbsp;of a finer concrete, on which was laid a pavement of polygonal blocks of hard stone jointed with the greatest nicety.&nbsp;The four layers are found to be often 3 feet or more in&nbsp;thickness, but the two lowest were dispensed with on rock.&nbsp;The paved part of a great road appears to have been about&nbsp;16 feet wide, and on either side, and separated from it by&nbsp;raised stone causeways, were unpaved side-ways, each of&nbsp;half the width of the paved road. Where, as on many&nbsp;roads, the surface was not paved, it was made of hard&nbsp;concrete, or pebbles or flints set in mortar. Sometimes&nbsp;clay and marl were used instead of mortar, and it would&nbsp;seem that where inferior materials were used the road was&nbsp;made higher above the ground and rounder in cross section.&nbsp;Streets were paved with large polygonal blocks laid as&nbsp;above described and footways with rectangular slabs.&nbsp;Specimens are still to be seen in Rome and Pompeii.&nbsp;There are no traces of Roman influence in the later roads&nbsp;in England, but in France the Roman method appears to&nbsp;have been followed to some extent when new roads were&nbsp;constructed about the beginning of the 18th century. A&nbsp;foundation of stones on the flat was laid, and over that&nbsp;two layers of considerable thickness, of larger and smaller&nbsp;stones, bordered by large stones on edge, which appeared&nbsp;on the surface of the road. In 1764 Tresaguet set the&nbsp;foundation-stones on edge and reduced the thickness of&nbsp;the upper layers, and his method was generally folloλved&nbsp;until the influence of Macadam began to be felt. A French&nbsp;chaussée with accotements still retains, some resemblance&nbsp;to the old Roman roads.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The almost incredibly bad state of the roads in England towards the latter part of the 17th century appears from&nbsp;the accounts cited by Macaulay </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Hist.,</span><span class="font1"> c. iii.). It was due&nbsp;chiefly to the state of the law, which compelled each parish&nbsp;to maintain its own roads by statute labour, but the establishment of turnpike trusts and the maintenance of roads&nbsp;by tolls do not appear to have effected any great improvement. At the time of Arthur Young’s six months’ tour&nbsp;in 1770 the roads would seem to have been almost as bad&nbsp;as ever, and it is doubtful if there was much improvement&nbsp;up to the beginning of the present century. The turnpike&nbsp;roads were generally managed by ignorant and incompetent&nbsp;men until Telford and Macadam brought scientific principles and regular system to their construction and repair.&nbsp;The name of Telford is associated with a pitched foundation,&nbsp;which he did not always use, but which closely resembled&nbsp;that which had been long in use in France, and the name&nbsp;of Macadam often characterizes roads on which all his&nbsp;precepts are disregarded. Both insisted on thorough&nbsp;drainage and on the use of carefully prepared materials,&nbsp;and adopted a uniform cross section of moderate curvature&nbsp;instead of the exaggerated roundness given before ; but,&nbsp;while Telford paid particular attention to a foundation for&nbsp;the broken stone, Macadam disregarded it, contending that&nbsp;the subsoil, however bad, would carry any weight if made&nbsp;dry by drainage and kept dry by an impervious covering.&nbsp;Macadam was engaged more with the repair of old roads&nbsp;than with the construction of new ones, and, though it is&nbsp;not possible to agree with all his doctrines, the improvement which he effected in road management and maintenance was great and lasting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Construction of Roads.—A road should be as short as possible between two points to be connected, but straightness must often&nbsp;be sacrificed to avoid difficulties and expense and to secure good&nbsp;gradients. The latter should be as easy as practicable, having regard to the country to be traversed, and it is desirable that there&nbsp;should be a ruling gradient than which none should be steeper.&nbsp;On a level macadamized road in ordinary repair the force which&nbsp;the horse has to put forth to draw a load may be taken as one-thirtieth of the load. But in going uphill the horse has also to&nbsp;lift the load, and the additional force to be put forth on this&nbsp;account is very nearly equal to the load drawn divided by the rate&nbsp;of gradient. Thus on a gradient of 1 in 30 the force spent in&nbsp;lifting is one-thirtieth of the load, and in ascending a horse has to&nbsp;exert twice the force required to draw the load on a level. In descending, on the other hand, on such a gradient, the vehicle, when&nbsp;once started, would just move of itself without pressing on the&nbsp;horse. Λ horse can without difficulty exert twice his usual force&nbsp;for a time, and can therefore ascend gradients of 1 in 30 on a macadamized surface without sensible diminution of speed, and can trot&nbsp;freely down them. These considerations have led to 1 in 30 being&nbsp;generally considered as the ruling gradient to be aimed at on first-class roads, though 1 in 40 has been advocated. Telford adopted&nbsp;1 in 30 as the ruling gradient on the Holyhead road through North&nbsp;Wales, and there are only two gradients steeper, in places where&nbsp;they were unavoidable. All unnecessary rises and falls should be&nbsp;avoided, but a dead level is unfavourable for drainage, and on this&nbsp;account 1 in 100 to 1 in 150 is the flattest gradient that is desirable.&nbsp;Such slight rises and falls are probably rather favourable than otherwise to ease of draught by horses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In transverse section, roads in the United Kingdom generally comprise the carriage-way, a space on each side, on one or both of&nbsp;which there may be a footpath, then the fences, and outside all&nbsp;the ditches. The width of the carriage-way may be from 15 feet,&nbsp;which allows of the easy passage of two vehicles, to 30 or 50 feet</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
