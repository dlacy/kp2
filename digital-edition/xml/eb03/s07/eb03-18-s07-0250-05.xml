in natural hiſtory, a new genus of birds, belonging to the order of passeres, formed by Dr Latham by limiting the motacilla to the wagtail, and arranging·; the other ſpecies, formerly claſſed under that genus, under the ſylvia.</p><p>The motacilla he thus describes : The beak is ſubulated, ſlender, and ſomewhat indented at the point. The tongue ſeems torn at the end, and the tail is long. He thus characterizes the ſylvia : ſhe beak is ſubulated, ſtraight, and ſmall ; the mandibles are nearly equal. The noſtrils are obovate, and a little depressed. The exterior toe is joined at the under part to the baſe of the middle one. The tounge is cloven, and the tail is small. He makes 13 ſpecies of the motacilla, and 174 ſpecies oſ the ſylvia. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Motacilla.</hi></p></div></body></text></TEI>
