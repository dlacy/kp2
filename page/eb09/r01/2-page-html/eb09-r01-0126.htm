<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">vidual keeping its own distance from the next@@<sup>1</sup>—all, however, pressing forward on their way to cross the Channel. On the European continent the migration is still more&nbsp;marked, and the Redbreast on its autumnal and vernal&nbsp;passages is the object of hosts of bird-catchers, since its&nbsp;value as a delicacy for the table has long been recognized.@@<sup>2&nbsp;</sup>But even those Redbreasts which stay in Britain during&nbsp;the winter are subject to a migratory movement easily perceived by any one that will look out for it. Occupying&nbsp;during autumn their usual haunts in outlying woods or&nbsp;hedges, the first sharp frost at once makes them change&nbsp;their habitation, and a heavy fall of snow drives them&nbsp;towards the homesteads for such food as they may find&nbsp;there, while, should severe weather continue long and&nbsp;sustenance become more scarce, even these stranger birds&nbsp;disappear—most of them possibly to perish—leaving only&nbsp;the few that have already become almost domiciled among&nbsp;men. On the approach of spring the accustomed spots&nbsp;are revisited, but among the innumerable returning denizens Redbreasts are apt to be neglected, for their song not&nbsp;being powerful is drowned or lost, as Gilbert White well&nbsp;remarked, in the general chorus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">From its abundance, or from innumerable figures, the Redbreast is too well known to need description, yet there&nbsp;are very few representations of it which give a notion of&nbsp;its characteristic appearance or gestures—all so suggestive&nbsp;of intelligence. Its olive-brown back and reddish-orange&nbsp;breast, or their equivalents in black and white, may be&nbsp;easily imitated by the draughtsman; but the faculty of&nbsp;tracing a truthful outline or fixing the peculiar expression&nbsp;of this favourite bird has proved to be beyond the skill of&nbsp;almost every artist who has attempted its portraiture.&nbsp;The Redbreast exhibits a curious uncertainty of temperament in regard to its nesting habits. At times it will&nbsp;place the utmost confidence in man, and again at times&nbsp;shew the greatest jealousy. The nest, though generally&nbsp;pretty, can seldom be called a work of art, and is usually&nbsp;built of moss and dead leaves, with a moderate lining of&nbsp;hair. In this are laid from five to seven white eggs,&nbsp;sprinkled or blotched with light red.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Besides the British Islands, the Redbreast (which is the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Mota-cilla rubecula</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> of Linnaeus and the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Erithacus rubecula</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> of modern authors) is generally dispersed over the continent of Europe, and&nbsp;is in winter found in the oases of the Sahara. Its eastern limits&nbsp;are not well determined. In Northern Persia it is replaced by a&nbsp;very nearly allied form, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Erithacus hyrcanus,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> distinguishable by its&nbsp;more ruddy hues, while in Northern China and Japan another&nbsp;species, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">E. akahige,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> is found of which the sexes differ somewhat in&nbsp;plumage—the cock having a blackish band below his red breast,&nbsp;and greyish-black flanks, while the hen closely resembles the&nbsp;familiar British species—but both cock and hen have the tail of&nbsp;chestnut-red. A beautiful bird supposed to inhabit Corea, the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Sylvia komadori</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> of Temminck, of which specimens are very scarce&nbsp;in collections, is placed by some writers in the genus </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Erithacus</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">,&nbsp;but whether it has any very close affinity to the Redbreasts does&nbsp;not yet seem to be proved. It is of a bright orange-red above, and&nbsp;white beneath, the male, however, having the throat and breast&nbsp;black.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A. N.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">REDDITCH, a town of Worcestershire, is situated on an eminence near tlie Warwickshire border, 16 miles southwest of Birmingham by the Midland Railway. The church&nbsp;of St Stephen, a handsome building in the Decorated&nbsp;style, erected in 1854-55, contains some good stained-glass&nbsp;windows. A public cemetery was formed in 1854. Among&nbsp;the public buildings are the county court, where special&nbsp;sessions are held, and the literary and scientific institute.&nbsp;In the neighbourhood are the remains of Bordesley Abbey,&nbsp;founded by the Cistercians in 1138.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">RED RIVER. Three at least of the many Red Rivers of the world deserve to be mentioned,—(1) the Red River&nbsp;or Fleuve Rouge, the Songcoi or Thao of the Anamese,&nbsp;the Hoang-Kiang of the Chinese, which flows through the&nbsp;heart of </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tong-king </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(q.v.)</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">; (2) the Red River which rises&nbsp;in the Stake Plain in Texas (U.S.), passes through a&nbsp;magnificent canon 100 miles long, and from 200 to 1000&nbsp;feet deep, and furnishes a navigable channel of 1200 miles&nbsp;before it reaches the </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Mississippi </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(q.v.) </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> (3) the Red River&nbsp;of the North, a somewhat smaller stream, which, rising&nbsp;in Elbow Lake (so called from its shape) in Minnesota&nbsp;(U.S.), not far from the sources of the Mississippi, crosses&nbsp;into Canada at Pembina, and falls into Lake Winnipeg,&nbsp;after a course of 565 miles (110 in Canada). The Red&nbsp;River of the Mississippi presents the physical geographer&nbsp;with a phenomenon nowhere reproduced on the same scale,&nbsp;—a great raft of timber and driftwood, which, in spite&nbsp;of the labours of Captain Shreve (1835-39) and General&nbsp;Williamson and Captain Linnard (1841-45), had by 1871&nbsp;increased so as to block the channel for 45 miles between&nbsp;Spring Creek and Caroline Bluff. The Red River of the&nbsp;North is equally famous as the scene of some of the leading&nbsp;events in the history of the North-West.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Red River Settlement.—</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">In 1811 the fifth earl of Selkirk (1771-1820), who had devoted special attention to emigration as&nbsp;a means of providing for the surplus population of the Scottish&nbsp;Highlands, obtained from the Hudson’s Bay Company a grant of&nbsp;land in what was then called the district of Ossiniboia (Assiniboia).&nbsp;In 1813 a settlement was founded by his agent, Mr Miles Macdonell,&nbsp;on the banks of the Red River, the first fort (Fort Daer) being at&nbsp;Pembina. By 1814 the settlers numbered 200. The North-West&nbsp;Fur-Traders of Manchester (a company which was the bitterest&nbsp;rival of the Hudson’s Bay Company till the two amalgamated in&nbsp;1821) did all they could by force and fraud to break up the colony,&nbsp;which, by 1816, had taken up its headquarters at Fort Douglas, on&nbsp;the site of the present town of Winnipeg. The French-Indian&nbsp;half-breeds (Bois-Brûlés) were incited against it, and its mills and&nbsp;houses were burned. The earl of Selkirk, arriving on the scene,&nbsp;succeeded in reorganizing the community, to which the name of&nbsp;Kildonan was now given, after Kildonan in Helmsdale, Sutherland-shire. He found himself personally involved in a very network&nbsp;of hostile intrigue ; but the colony was saved, and after his premature death it continued to be more or less supported by his heirs&nbsp;till 1824. In 1835 Lord Selkirk’s territorial claims were transferred to the Hudson’s Bay Company, who undertook to pay the&nbsp;expenses incurred by the family. At that date the population of&nbsp;the settlement consisted of about 5000 Highlanders, Bois-Brûlés,&nbsp;English half-breeds, and retired company officials. At the transfer&nbsp;of territorial jurisdiction to the Canadian Government in 1869 the&nbsp;Bois-Brûlés, under a certain Louis Riel (son of a Frenchman who&nbsp;had built the first mill on the Red river), revolted and declared&nbsp;an independent republic. Colonel (now Lord) Wolseley was despatched with a force of 1400 men, and without bloodshed took&nbsp;possession of Fort Garry on 24th August 1870. The only striking&nbsp;feature of the expedition was the remarkable energy with which&nbsp;the difficulties of transport were overcome. Riel in 1885 became&nbsp;the leader of another unsuccessful insurrection of half-breeds in the&nbsp;same region.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">REDRUTH, a market town of Cornwall, is pleasantly situated on the West Cornwall Railway, about 9 miles&nbsp;west of Truro. It is almost the centre of the mining&nbsp;district of West Cornwall, and, though many of the rich&nbsp;copper mines are now abandoned, others have proved rich&nbsp;in tin at greater depths, and new mines have also been&nbsp;opened, sufficient to render Redruth one of the most busy&nbsp;and important towns of the county. Within the last few&nbsp;years a post-office, a mining exchange, and a school of&nbsp;science and art have been built, as well as a new church.&nbsp;At the foot of Carn Brea, the unique Druidical hill, surmounted by masses of granite, with an ancient castle and</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
