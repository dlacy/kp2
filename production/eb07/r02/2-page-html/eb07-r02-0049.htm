<p><span class="font1">L The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Flaminian</span><span class="font1"> road still affords the great northern approach to Rome by the Porta del Popolo ; it led to Fo-ligno, Ancona, and Rimini, and was continued by the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Emilian</span><span class="font1"> to Bologna, and thence to Aquilegia, near Venice ;&nbsp;the present mountain route from Bologna to Rome is still&nbsp;facilitated by the remains of the ancient structures. Besides the Emilian road, the Flaminian was also connected&nbsp;with the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cassian,</span><span class="font1"> leading to Modena ; the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Claudian,</span><span class="font1"> to&nbsp;Arezzo, Florence, and Lucca: there were also six other&nbsp;branches of less note, each named after its founder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">II. III. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Salarian</span><span class="font1"> and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Nomentaniαn</span><span class="font1"> roads lay to the east of the Flaminian ; the former, from the Porta&nbsp;Salara, led through the country of the Sabines by Rieti to&nbsp;Hadria; the latter, from the Porta Sant’Agnese, went northeastwards to Nomentum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">IV. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tiburtine</span><span class="font1"> road led from the Porta Tiburtina,&nbsp;now San Lorenzo, to Tivoli, with a branch on the right&nbsp;called the Gabian. The large blocks which were employed to form this road, near the town of Tivoli, in ascending&nbsp;from the river, are still in their ancient places ; they are&nbsp;accurately fitted together, and present a surface sufficiently&nbsp;smooth, after having been in use for about two thousand&nbsp;years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">V. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VI. VII. The three next in order all met at Anagnia,&nbsp;twenty-four miles beyond Praeneste or Palestrina. The&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Prœnestine,</span><span class="font1"> from the Esquiline gate, now called Porta&nbsp;Maggiore, on account of the magnitude of the ruins of the&nbsp;aqueduct of Clodius, with which it is incorporated, led by&nbsp;Aquinum to Præheste ; the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lavican</span><span class="font1"> led from the same&nbsp;gate, more to the right, by way of Beneventum ; and the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Latin</span><span class="font1"> road, from the Porta Latina, went first to Compitum,&nbsp;and from Anagnia proceeded to join the Appian near Capua.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">VIII. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Appian</span><span class="font1"> road is as well known from the minute&nbsp;description of Horace’s progress in his journey to Brundu-sium, as from the eagerness with which a modern traveller&nbsp;reckons the stages that he has completed, on his way to&nbsp;Naples, without a visit from the banditti that infest it. The&nbsp;original extent of this road, from the Colosseum to Capua,&nbsp;was 142 Roman miles; and it was continued 238 miles&nbsp;further to Brundusium by Julius Cæsar. It was constructed with large stones, or rather rocks, joined together with&nbsp;great care ; and it is said to have had a foot-pavement two&nbsp;feet wide on each side, besides the agger, or principal mass&nbsp;of stones in the middle, and the two marginal parts, which&nbsp;were probably unpaved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">IX. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ostian</span><span class="font1"> road led from the Porta di San Paolo,&nbsp;near the Tiber, in a straight line to the month of that river.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">X. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Aurelian,</span><span class="font1"> from the Porta Aurelia, a gate which&nbsp;was near the Moles Adriani, or Castle of Sant’ Angelo, led&nbsp;by Laurentum to Centumcellæ or Civita Vecchia, to Genoa,&nbsp;and thence by Susa, across the Montcenis, as far as Arles&nbsp;in Provence. This seems to have been the oldest passage&nbsp;into the Gauls; it was improved by Pompey the Great&nbsp;under the name of the Strata Romana. Several other passages over the Alps are also particularized in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Itinerary&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">of Antonine on the roads from Milan to Arles ; from Milan&nbsp;to Vienne in Dauphiné, either by the Grecian or by the&nbsp;Cottian Alps, the former north, the latter south of Montcenis; from Milan to Strasburg; and from Milan to Mentz.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">XL XII. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Triumphal</span><span class="font1"> road began from the Capitol, and went over the Tiber into the country beyond the present site of the Vatican. We may consider as the last of&nbsp;the twelve great roads, originating from Rome, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Collatine,</span><span class="font1"> leading due north from the Porta Pinciana on the&nbsp;Monte Pincio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Among the less remarkable roads abou£J.be metropolis of the ancient world were also the Campanian, the new and&nbsp;the old Valerian, both leading by Tivoli to the Adriatic ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">the Tusculan, the Alban, the Ardeatine, on the right of the Appian ; the Laurentine, a little more to the right,&nbsp;Pliny’s villa being mentioned as accessible from either of&nbsp;these last; the Portuensis, from the Porta Portuese Tras-teverina, leading to Ostia; and the Aurelia Nova, beginning from the Porta Janiculi, now Porta San Pancrazio,&nbsp;and leading towards Civita Vecchia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Whether on the foundations of the ancient roads, or in any new lines that have been prepared in modern times&nbsp;by the magnificence of the pontiffs or of the princes, the&nbsp;great roads of Italy are at present almost universally well&nbsp;made and well repaired. In Lombardy, indeed, and throughout the immense plain that extends from the Alps to the&nbsp;Apennines, they are quite as good, in summer at least, as&nbsp;those in England. The cross roads of Italy are, however,&nbsp;greatly neglected ; for it is in fact almost exclusively in Great&nbsp;Britain that private and individual exertion supersedes the&nbsp;necessity of public munificence. The intercourse of Italy&nbsp;with the rest of Europe has been greatly facilitated by the&nbsp;improvements made in the two great passages over the&nbsp;Alps by the authority of Bonaparte. The more useful of&nbsp;these improvements are probably those which have been&nbsp;effected on the southern side of Montcenis, since they enable the traveller to pass with little danger or difficulty at all&nbsp;seasons of the year ; the more magnificent are the works at&nbsp;the Simplon, which, however, are not completely secure from&nbsp;the danger of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">avalanches,</span><span class="font1"> whenever fresh snow is lying on&nbsp;the ground. The Apennine portion of the Aurelian road&nbsp;has also been greatly improved by some still more recent&nbsp;operations, so that carriages may now pass with comparative&nbsp;ease and safety from Lucca to Genoa; though, for one&nbsp;stage, near Sestri, it is not thought advisable for tbe travellers to retain their seats within them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The general declivity of the new road over Montcenis is one inch in fifteen or twenty ; and it is never greater in the&nbsp;steepest part, that is, in the fourth and fifth turns that wind&nbsp;up over Lanslebourg, than one in twelve.@@<sup>1</sup> The road over&nbsp;the Simplon was executed jointly by the French and Italians, under the government of Bonaparte, from 1801 to&nbsp;1805. The greatest declivity is one inch in twenty-nine ;&nbsp;so that an English stage coachman might trot his horses up&nbsp;almost the whole way. The longest gallery or tunnel is&nbsp;about 500 feet under ground.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The roads in France are generally rough in their original formation, and still rougher from want of care in repairing them, as the traveller feels to his cost in passing over the primitive mountains in the south of that country, where&nbsp;the roads are certainly very different from those which are&nbsp;made by Macadam across a bog ; although some of the more&nbsp;recent French and Flemish pavements, as long as they remain unimpaired, are truly excellent ; the new pavement&nbsp;between Cologne and Brussels, for example, is far more&nbsp;perfect than some of the unpaved parts of the continuation&nbsp;of the same line of road to Calais, although the civil postmasters are in the habit of congratulating their English&nbsp;guests on the “ fine gravel road” they will have to pass over.&nbsp;In Germany they have few pavements ; and the roads, except in sandy countries, are generally kept, or keep themselves, in good repair ; that is, in the south and the west of&nbsp;Germany. Mr Cripps informs us, that the great roads in&nbsp;Sweden are beautiful ; they are very slightly convex, and&nbsp;made of granite broken to the size of a walnut. The Irish&nbsp;roads, according to Mr Edgeworth, are generally better&nbsp;than the English ; the Scotish, Macadam thinks worse,&nbsp;though the materials are better ; but in many parts of Scotland the roads appear to be more than sufficiently good for&nbsp;the commerce of the country.</span></p>
