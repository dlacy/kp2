                    commonly called, from his title and the initials of his own and his father’s
                    names, Rashbam, was born at Rameru (Ramerupt near Troyes, in France) about 1080.
                    He was almost the greatest Talmudist of his time, the only two excelling him
                    till 1105 being Rashi and later on his own younger brother, Rabbenu Ya'akob,
                    better known as Rabbenu Tham. In Bible criticism and exegesis, however, he
                    excelled all the men of the 11th and 12th centuries, even if we include R.
                    Menahem b. Helbo, R. Yoseph Bekhor Shor, and R. Yoseph Kara of the
                    Franco-Ashkenazic school, and Abraham Ibn 'Ezra of the Sepharadic school.
                    Rashbam was the son of Yokhebed, second daughter of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Rashi</hi>
                    <hi rend="italic">(q.v.),</hi> and of Rabbenu Meir of Rameru (b. Shemuel). He
                    sue-ceeded his grandfather Rashi as head of the Rabbinical college, and probably
                    also of the congregation, of Troyes. Later, however, we meet him at other
                    places, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> Caen, Loudun. He died about 1160.</p>
                <p>Of his works the following are known. (1) Commentaries on the Bible: <hi
                        rend="italic">(a)</hi> his commentary on the Pentateuch, uncritically edited
                    several times <hi rend="italic">(ed. princeps,</hi> Berlin, 1705), and
                    critically and most ably for the first time by Rosin of Breslau (1881, 8vo); (
                        <hi rend="italic">b)</hi> commentaries on most of the other books of the
                    Bible, the greater part of which are now lost, but the existence of which is in
                    early times fully testified to. Those on Ecclesiastes and Canticles <note

                        cannot share the opinion of those who, because of the Agadic explanations
                        with which that commentary abounds, call Rashbam’s authorship in question.
                        Ibn ’Ezra himself, who was sober thinker enough, is compelled in Canticles
                        to resort to the Rabbinic explanation,—a proceeding and a method in which
                        every modern commentator must take refuge, unless he wishes to explain the
                        book as a merely profane one. </note> were published by Dr Jellinek at
                    Leipsic (1855, 8vo); specimens of both books have been translated into English

                    thoroughly eclipsed all those written before and after him that none of them had
                    a chance of surviving, except in the shape of a supplement. (3) <hi
