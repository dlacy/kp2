        <p><span class="font1">The six consulships of Marius represented not merely a party victory
                but a protest against the system of divided&nbsp;and rapidly-changing commands,
                which was no doubt the&nbsp;system favoured by the senate, but was also an
                integral&nbsp;element of the republican constitution, and in assailing it&nbsp;the
                populäres weakened the republic even more than they&nbsp;irritated the senate. The
                transference of the political&nbsp;leadership to a consul who was nothing if not a
                soldier&nbsp;was at once a confession of the insufficiency of the purely&nbsp;civil
                authority of the tribunate and a dangerous encouragement of military interference in
                political controversies. The&nbsp;consequences were already foreshadowed by the
                special provisions made by Saturninus for Marius’s veterans, and in&nbsp;the active
                part taken by them in the passing of his laws.&nbsp;Indirectly too Marius, though no
                politician, played an&nbsp;important part in this new departure. His
                    military&nbsp;reforms@@<sup>1</sup> at once democratized the army and attached
                it&nbsp;more closely to its leader for the time being. He swept&nbsp;away the last
                traces of civil distinctions of rank or wealth&nbsp;within the legion, admitted to
                its ranks all classes, and&nbsp;substituted voluntary enlistment under a popular
                general&nbsp;for the old-fashioned compulsory levy. The efficiency of&nbsp;the
                legion was increased at the cost of a complete severance&nbsp;of the ties which
                bound it to the civil community and to&nbsp;the civil authorities.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The defeat of Saturninus was followed by several years of quiet ; nor
                was the next important crisis provoked directly&nbsp;by any efforts of the
                discredited popular party. It was&nbsp;due partly to the rivalry which had been
                growing more&nbsp;bitter each year since 122 between the senate and
                the&nbsp;commercial class, and secondly to the long impending&nbsp;question of the
                enfranchisement of the Italian allies. The&nbsp;publicani, negotiatores, and others,
                who constituted what&nbsp;was now becoming known as the equestrian order,
                had&nbsp;made unscrupulous use of their control of the courts and&nbsp;especially of
                the “quaestio de repetundis” against their&nbsp;natural rivals, the official class
                in the provinces. The&nbsp;threat of prosecution before a hostile jury was held
                over&nbsp;the head of every governor, legate, and quæstor who&nbsp;ventured to
                interfere with their operations in the provinces. The average official preferred to
                connive at their&nbsp;exactions ; the bolder ones paid with fines and even
                exile&nbsp;for their courage. In 93 the necessity for a reform was&nbsp;proved
                beyond a doubt by the scandalous condemnation&nbsp;of P. Rutilius
                    Rufus,@@<sup>2</sup> ostensibly on a charge of extortion,&nbsp;in reality as the
                reward of his efforts to check the extortions of the Roman equites in
            Asia.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The need of reform was clear, but it was not so easy to carry a
                reform which would certainly be opposed by the&nbsp;whole strength of the equestrian
                order, and which, as involving the repeal of a Sempronian law, would arouse
                the&nbsp;resentment of the popular party. The difficulties of the&nbsp;Italian
                question were more serious. That the Italian&nbsp;allies were discontented was
                notorious. After nearly two&nbsp;centuries of close alliance, of common dangers and
                victories,&nbsp;they now eagerly coveted as a boon that complete amalgamation with
                Rome which they had at first resented as a&nbsp;dishonour. But, unfortunately, Rome
                had grown more&nbsp;selfishly exclusive in proportion as the value set
                upon&nbsp;Roman citizenship increased. The politic liberality with&nbsp;which the
                franchise had once been granted had disappeared.&nbsp;The allies found their burdens
                increasing and their&nbsp;ancient privileges diminishing, while the resentment
                with&nbsp;which they viewed their exclusion from the fruits of the&nbsp;conquests
                they had helped to make was aggravated by</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">the growingly suspicious and domineering attitude of the Roman
                    government.@@<sup>3</sup> During the last forty years feelings of hope and
                disappointment had rapidly succeeded&nbsp;each other; Marcus Fulvins, Gaius
                Gracchus, Saturninus,&nbsp;had all held out promises of relief—and nothing had
                yet&nbsp;been done. On each occasion they had crowded to Rome,&nbsp;full of eager
                expectation, only to be harshly ejected from&nbsp;the city by the consul’s
                    orders.@@<sup>4</sup> The justice of their&nbsp;claims could hardly be denied,
                the danger of continuing&nbsp;to ignore them was obvious—yet the difficulties in
                the&nbsp;way of granting them were formidable in the extreme.&nbsp;The temper of
                senate and people alike was still jealously&nbsp;exclusive, and from a higher than a
                merely selfish point of&nbsp;view there was much to be said against the
                revolution&nbsp;involved in so sudden and enormous an enlargement of&nbsp;the
                citizen body.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Marcus Livius Drusus, who as tribune gallantly took up the task of
                reform, is claimed by Cicero@@<sup>5</sup> as a member of&nbsp;that party of the
                centre to which he belonged himself.&nbsp;Noble, wealthy, and popular, he seems to
                have hoped to be&nbsp;able by the weight of his position and character to
                rescue&nbsp;the burning questions of the day from the grasp of
                extreme&nbsp;partisans and to settle them peacefully and equitably.&nbsp;But he,
                like Cicero after him, had to find to his cost that&nbsp;there was no room in the
                fierce strife of Roman politics&nbsp;for moderate counsels. His proposal to reform
                the law&nbsp;courts excited the equestrian order and their friends in&nbsp;the
                senate to fury. The agrarian and corn laws which he&nbsp;coupled with
                    it@@<sup>6</sup> alienated many more in the senate, and&nbsp;roused the old
                anti-popular party feeling ; finally, his known&nbsp;negotiations with the Italians
                were eagerly misrepresented&nbsp;to the jealous and excited people as evidence of
                complicity&nbsp;with a wide-spread conspiracy against Rome. His laws&nbsp;were
                carried, but the senate pronounced them null and&nbsp;void.@@<sup>7</sup> Drusus was
                denounced in the senate house as a&nbsp;traitor, and on his way home was struck down
                by the hand&nbsp;of an unknown assassin.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The knights retained their monopoly of the courts, but this and all
                other domestic controversies were silenced for&nbsp;the time by the news which
                followed hard upon the&nbsp;murder of Drusus that the Italians were in open
                revolt&nbsp;against Rome. His assassination was the signal for&nbsp;an outbreak
                which had been secretly prepared for some&nbsp;time before. Throughout the highlands
                of central and&nbsp;southern Italy the flower of the Italian peoples rose
                as&nbsp;one man.@@<sup>8</sup> Etruria and Umbriaheld aloof; the isolated&nbsp;Latin
                colonies stood firm ; but the Sabellian clans, north&nbsp;and south, the Latinized
                Marsi and Pæligni, as well as the&nbsp;still Oscan-speaking Samnites and Lucanians,
                rushed to&nbsp;arms. No time was lost in proclaiming their plans for&nbsp;the
                future. A new Italian state was to be formed. The&nbsp;Pælignian town of Corfinium
                was selected as its capital&nbsp;and re-christened with the proud name of Italica.
                All&nbsp;Italians were to be citizens of this new metropolis, and here&nbsp;were to
                be the place of assembly and the senate house.&nbsp;A senate of 500 members and a
                magistracy resembling&nbsp;that of Rome completed a constitution which
                adhered&nbsp;closely to the very political traditions which its authors&nbsp;had
                most reason to abjure.</span></p>
