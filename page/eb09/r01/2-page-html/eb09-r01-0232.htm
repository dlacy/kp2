<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">origin of the mesoderm, and while the different layers undoubtedly exhibit in some cases the possibility of differentiation into tissues&nbsp;different from those to which they usually give origin, yet the&nbsp;general homology of the layers is now indisputable. The ectoderm,&nbsp;which is indeed the primitive sensory and protective organ, forms&nbsp;the epidermis, sense organs, and nervous system of the adult; the&nbsp;nutritive endoderm lines the enteric cavity, &amp;c.; and from the&nbsp;mesoderm are derived the muscular, vascular, and lymphatic&nbsp;systems and the greater part of the connective tissue, as also the&nbsp;excretory and generally also the generative system. Not only&nbsp;then is the occurrence of these three layers constant, but, with few&nbsp;exceptions, so is the differentiation of each into definite systems of&nbsp;organs. This correspondence, which is of high—in most cases of&nbsp;final—importance in determining homologies, may be termed&nbsp;homodermic. See </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Morphology. (15)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">5.</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Unity of Anatomical Structure</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">.—The study of development&nbsp;leads, however, to the recognition of a more detailed and specific&nbsp;unity than the general one of homodermy. For, just as the&nbsp;development of the flower reveals the original resemblance of&nbsp;organs which become subsequently widely differentiated, so organs&nbsp;which in their adult modification seem hardly comparable are seen&nbsp;to be moulded from one pattern when compared in their embryonic&nbsp;simplicity. The same holds good obviously of the comparison of&nbsp;organs in different animals ; organogeny is the necessary foundation&nbsp;of comparative anatomy. Thus of late years it has been demonstrated that the nervous system and sense organs, throughout at&nbsp;any rate the vast majority of Metazoan forms, not only constantly&nbsp;arise from the ectoderm—that is to say, are homodermic—but their&nbsp;development exhibits correspondences even in detail. Recent&nbsp;studies of the development of the Vertebrate skeleton, and more&nbsp;especially of the skull, afford vivid instances of that fundamental&nbsp;unity of structure of which, in another department, the final&nbsp;unravelment of the complex problem of the structure of the&nbsp;urinogenital organs of Vertebrates through the researches of&nbsp;Balfour and Semper is one of the most recent and admirable&nbsp;instances. (11)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Unity of Type</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">.—It has been the general history of classification both of plants and animals that arrangements based on superficial resemblance were superseded by those founded on internal&nbsp;organization, while the latter have been in turn either corroborated&nbsp;or amended by the relationships revealed by the study of development, as from the preceding generalizations must indeed be obvious.&nbsp;Just as the separation of the Monocotyledons and Dicotyledons into&nbsp;two great alliances was anatomically recognized by Ray, and em-bryologically corroborated by De Jussieu, so the developmental&nbsp;studies of Von Baer led him independently to the establishment of&nbsp;the four great types which had been previously distinguished by&nbsp;the anatomical labours of Cuvier. And, apart from the recognition&nbsp;of the morphological unities of the greater groups, it is familiarly&nbsp;known how in the case of problematical forms, such, for instance,&nbsp;as Cirripedes or Ascidians, where the adult organization is obscured&nbsp;by degeneration, the detection of the true relationship is due to embryology. In proportion, too, as the recapitulation during development of adult structure becomes shortened and effaced, so does the&nbsp;determination of their real affinities become difficult; hence the&nbsp;relatively slow progress of the botanist towards a knowledge of the&nbsp;deeper affinities of his “natural orders.” (11)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">As the preceding outline of embryological detail is being rapidly filled up, and the resultant concrete generalizations are being more and more clearly defined, and&nbsp;also united with those of comparative anatomy and palaeontology, the embryologist is rapidly approximating that&nbsp;tolerably adequate knowledge of the morphological relations of plants and animals alike which finds its graphic&nbsp;expression in the “ family tree ” of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Organisata.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">While, for instance, the discrepant speculations of Semper,&nbsp;Hubrecht, Sedgwick, and others, as to the ancestral form&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chordata</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">, afford illustration of how far we are&nbsp;from being able to construct a thoroughly definite genealogical tree, on the other hand no better evidence alike&nbsp;of the rapid stages by which our knowledge has advanced&nbsp;and of the utility of such a method of graphic notation can be obtained than by comparing the necessarily&nbsp;vague and hypothetical tree sketched by Haeckel only&nbsp;twenty years ago with any of its numerous and shortlived&nbsp;successors. (16)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">3. The result of the study of development is not, however, merely to establish the existence of such concrete structural unities as those just indicated, but leads further&nbsp;to the recognition of certain abstract generalizations, expressive of the most comprehensive conclusions which can</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">be drawn from the observed succession of developmental phenomena.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heredity</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">.—It is an every-day observation that the&nbsp;offspring of any organism repeats the organization of the&nbsp;parent; and the very familiarity of the fact is apt to&nbsp;conceal the marvellousness of the process in which every&nbsp;egg cell develops, either directly or indirectly, into a form&nbsp;which not only resembles the parent in general and specific&nbsp;characters, but may even repeat those individual characteristics which arose by so-called spontaneous variation, or&nbsp;which were even impressed upon the parent by the direct&nbsp;influence of the external environment. The difficulty of&nbsp;analysing the factors which give rise to this result,—that&nbsp;is, of understanding how the history of the developing ovum&nbsp;is determined by its constitution—the uncertainty as to&nbsp;the degree in which acquired parental characteristics can&nbsp;be said to be transmitted, the absence in fact of any&nbsp;established causal explanation of the resemblance between&nbsp;offspring and parent, in specific and individual characters,&nbsp;does not of course affect the fact. Although, in analysing&nbsp;the popular generalization that “like begets like,” it may&nbsp;eventually be shown how much of that likeness may be&nbsp;due to the hammering of the same environmental forces&nbsp;which formerly played upon the parent, a mysterious&nbsp;transmission of properties has still to be accounted for, and&nbsp;interpreted in terms of the physiological and morphological,&nbsp;the chemical and physical, composition and properties of&nbsp;the germinal matter of parent and offspring. To explain&nbsp;this mystery, various “ theories of heredity” have been from&nbsp;time to time propounded; from the present purely morphological point of view it suffices here, however, to note the&nbsp;fact of heredity, leaving the discussion of its rationale to&nbsp;its more natural place at the outset of the article </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Variation and Selection. (6)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Von Baer’s Law</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">.—In comparing the degree of&nbsp;organization attained by different forms, we are accustomed&nbsp;to distinguish the general morphological ground-plan constant throughout the group from the detailed histological&nbsp;differentiation or elaboration of the various organs. Great&nbsp;histological simplicity may co-exist with a high general&nbsp;morphological plan, and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">vice versa.</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> A survey of the&nbsp;animal and vegetable kingdom reveals a branching and&nbsp;ascending series of increasingly complex ground-plans,&nbsp;while, in any of the groups determined by these, similar&nbsp;branching series more and more highly differentiated in&nbsp;detail are to be distinguished. Von Baer (1828) was the&nbsp;first to discern the embryological aspect of this law of progress, and to show that, in the development alike of the&nbsp;organism and of its component parts, there was a progress&nbsp;from the simple to the complex, from the general to the&nbsp;special. Thus, in the development of one of the higher&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mammalia</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">, those characters which are common to the lowest Vertebrates are at first alone distinguishable. Thence&nbsp;the embryo passes through stages resembling those of&nbsp;successively higher forms, till the general Matnmalian type&nbsp;is reached, this again passing through higher and less&nbsp;general stages till the specific characters finally make their&nbsp;appearance; and this progressive differentiation from general to special holds equally of the histological differentiation of the organs. Von Baer guarded against the error&nbsp;involved in many popular versions of his generalization,&nbsp;by maintaining that the developing embryo resembled, not&nbsp;the adults, but merely the embryos of lower forms; and,&nbsp;although he narrowed his proposition to the limits of the&nbsp;great groups, denying, for example, any resemblance&nbsp;between Vertebrate embryos and those of any Invertebrate&nbsp;type, this must be admitted a thoroughly legitimate&nbsp;reserve when we consider the actual state and practical&nbsp;possibilities of embryological research at the time. The&nbsp;real value and import of Von Baer’s law, however, could</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
