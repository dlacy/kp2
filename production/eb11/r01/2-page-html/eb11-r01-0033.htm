    <p><span class="font2">appear, and these are quite distinct in chemical and physical properties from the parent matter. The radiating power is an&nbsp;atomic property, for it is unaffected by combination of the&nbsp;active element with inactive bodies, and is uninfluenced by the&nbsp;most powerful chemical and physical agencies at our command.&nbsp;In order to explain these results, Rutherford and Soddy (2o)&nbsp;in 1903 put forward a simple but comprehensive theory. The&nbsp;atoms of radioactive matter are unstable, and each second a&nbsp;definite fraction of the number of atoms present break up with&nbsp;explosive violence, in most cases expelling an </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ß</span><span class="font2"> particle&nbsp;with great velocity. Taking as a simple illustration that an&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">α</span><span class="font2"> particle is expelled during the explosion, the resulting atom&nbsp;has decreased in mass and possesses chemical and physical&nbsp;properties entirely distinct from the parent atom. A new type&nbsp;of matter has thus appeared as a result of the transformation.&nbsp;The atoms of this new matter are again unstable and break up&nbsp;in turn, the process of successive disintegration of the atom&nbsp;continuing through a number of distinct stages. On this view,&nbsp;a substance like the radium emanation is derived from the&nbsp;transformation of radium. The atoms of the emanation are&nbsp;far more unstable than the atoms of radium, and break up at&nbsp;a much quicker rate. We shall now consider the law of radioactive transformation according to this theory. It is experi-mentally observed that in all simple radioactive substances,&nbsp;the tensity of the radiation decreases in a geometrical progression with the time, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i. e.</span><span class="font2"> I∕I<sub>o</sub> =</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">e<sup>-</sup></span><span class="font2"><sup>λt</sup> where I is the intensity&nbsp;of the radiation at any time </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">t,</span><span class="font2"> I<sub>o</sub> the initial intensity, and λ&nbsp;a constant. Now according to this theory, the intensity of the&nbsp;radiation is proportional to the number of atoms breaking up&nbsp;per second. From this it follows that the atoms of active&nbsp;matter present decrease in a geometrical progression with the&nbsp;time, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">i. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.</span><span class="font2"> N∕N<sub>o</sub>=e<sup>-λt</sup> where N is the number of atoms present&nbsp;at a time </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">t</span><span class="font2">, N<sub>o</sub> the initial number, and λ the same constant&nbsp;as before. Differentiating, we have </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">d</span><span class="font2">N∕</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">dt</span><span class="font2">= -λN, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">i. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e. λ </span><span class="font1">represents</span><span class="font2"> the fraction of the total number of atoms present which&nbsp;break up per second. The radioactive constant λ has a definite&nbsp;and characteristic value for each type of matter. Since λ is&nbsp;usually a very small fraction, it is convenient to distinguish&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">the </span><span class="font2">products by stating the time required for half the matter&nbsp;to be transformed. This will be called the period of the product,&nbsp;and is numerically equal to log </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"><sub>c</sub></span><span class="font2">∕λ. As far as our observation&nbsp;has gone, the law of radioactive change is applicable to all&nbsp;radioactive matter without exception. It appears to be an&nbsp;expression of the law of probability, for the average number&nbsp;breaking up per second is proportional to the number present.&nbsp;Viewed from this point of view, the number of atoms breaking&nbsp;up per second should have a certain average value, but the&nbsp;number from second to second should vary within certain&nbsp;limits according to the theory of probability. The theory of&nbsp;this effect was first put&quot; forward by Schweidler, and has since&nbsp;been verified by a number of experimenters, including Kohl-rausch, Meyer, and Begener and H. Geiger. This variation&nbsp;in the number of atoms breaking up from moment to moment&nbsp;becomes marked with weak radioactive matter, where only a&nbsp;few atoms break up per second. The variations observed are&nbsp;in good agreement with those to be expected from the theory&nbsp;of probability. This effect does not in any way invalidate the&nbsp;law of radioactive change. On an average the number of&nbsp;atoms of any simple kind of matter breaking up per second is&nbsp;proportional to the number present. We shall now consider&nbsp;how the amount of radioactive matter which is supplied at a&nbsp;constant rate from a source varies with the time. For clear-ness, we shall take the case of the production of emanation, by&nbsp;radium. The rate of transformation of radium is so slow&nbsp;compared with that of the emanation that we may assume&nbsp;without sensible error that the number of atoms of radium&nbsp;breaking up per second, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Le.</span><span class="font2"> the supply of fresh emanation, is&nbsp;on the average constant over the interval required. Suppose&nbsp;that initially radium is completely freed from emanation. In&nbsp;consequence of the steady supply, the amount of emanation&nbsp;present increases, but not at a constant rate, for the emanation is&nbsp;in turn breaking up. Let </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">q</span><span class="font2"> be the number of atoms of emanation&nbsp;produced by the radium per second and N the number present&nbsp;after an interval </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">t</span><span class="font2">, then </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">dN</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">∣</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">dt=q-λ</span><span class="font1">N</span><span class="font2"> where λ is the radioactive constant of the emanation. It is obvious that a steady&nbsp;state will ultimately be reached when the number of atoms&nbsp;of emanation supplied per second are on the average to the&nbsp;atoms which break up per second. If N<sub>o</sub> be the maximum&nbsp;number, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">q</span><span class="font2">=XN<sub>o</sub>. Integrating the above equation, it follows&nbsp;that N∕N<sub>o</sub>=1-e&quot;<sup>λi</sup>. If a curve be plotted with N as&nbsp;ordinates and time as abscissae, it is seen that the recovery&nbsp;curve is complementary to the decay curve. The two curves&nbsp;for the radium emanation period, 3∙9 days, are shown in fig. 1,&nbsp;the maximum ordinate being in each case 100.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This process of production and disappearance of active* matter holds for all the radioactive bodies. We shall now&nbsp;consider some special cases of the variation of the amount of&nbsp;active matter with time which have proved of great importance&nbsp;in the analysis of radioactive changes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(a) Suppose that initially the matter A is present, and this changes into B and B into C, it is required to find the number of atoms P, Q&nbsp;and R of A, B and C present at any subsequent time </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">t..</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Let λ<sub>1</sub>, λ<sub>2</sub>, λ<sub>3</sub> be the constants of transformation of A, B and C respectively.

<p><span class="font1">It will be seen from (3), that the value of Q, initially zero, increases to a maximum and then decays; finally, according to an exponential&nbsp;law, with the period of the more slowly transformed product, whether&nbsp;A or B.</span></p>

Since initially the product A was in equilibrium with the&nbsp;source, and the radioactive processes are in no way changed by the&nbsp;removal of the source, it is clear that the amount of A present in&nbsp;the two parts in which the matter is distributed is unchanged.
