                608&nbsp;the Pantheon was given by Phocas to Boniface IV., who consecrated it as the
                church of S. Maria ad Martyres. In 1881-82&nbsp;the destruction of a row of houses
                behind the Pantheon exposed&nbsp;remains of a grand hall with richly sculptured
                entablature on&nbsp;Corinthian columns, part of the great thermæ of Agrippa,
                which&nbsp;extend beyond the Via della Ciambella (fig. 24). A great part of&nbsp;the
                thermæ appears from the brick stamps to belong to an extensive restoration in the
                reign of Hadrian, and bricks of his time are&nbsp;even said to have been found in

        <p><span class="font2">Many remains exist of the Golden House@@<sup>8</sup> of Nero, which
                show that this gorgeous palace covered an almost incredibly large space&nbsp;of
                ground, extending from the Palatine, over the Velia and the site of&nbsp;the temple
                of Venus and Rome, to the Esquiline, filling the great&nbsp;valley between the
                Coelian and the Esquiline where the Colosseum stands, and reaching far over the
                Esquiline to the great reservoir now called the “Sette Sale.” Noother extravagances
                or&nbsp;cruelties of Nero appear to have offended the Roman people so&nbsp;much as
                the erection of this enormous palace, which must have&nbsp;blocked up many important
                roads and occupied the site of a whole&nbsp;populous quarter. It was no doubt partly
                to make restitution&nbsp;for this enormous theft of land that Vespasian and Titus
                destroyed&nbsp;the Golden House and built the Colosseum and public thermæ
                of&nbsp;Titus @@<sup>9</sup> on part of its site. Under the substructions of the
                latter&nbsp;building extensive remains of the Golden House still exist ; and&nbsp;at
                one point, at a lower level still, pavements and foundations&nbsp;remain of one of
                the numerous houses destroyed by Nero to clear&nbsp;the site. The great bronze
                colossus of Nero, 120 feet high (Suet.,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2"
                style="font-style:italic;">Nero,</span><span class="font2"> 31), which stood in one
                of the porticus of the Golden House,&nbsp;was moved by Vespasian, with head and
                attributes altered to those&nbsp;of Apollo (Helios), on to the Velia ; and it was
                moved again by&nbsp;Hadrian, when the temple of Rome was built, on to the base
                which&nbsp;still exists near the Colosseum. Several coins show this colossus
                by&nbsp;the side of the Colosseum.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">Under the Palazzo Doria, the church of S. Maria in Via Lata, and

                building contained rostra, and was also used&nbsp;for gladiatorial shows. Under the

                was burnt in the great fire of Nero, and again under Domitian, by whom it was
                restored wholly in stone and marble, and&nbsp;lastly it was restored and enlarged by
                Constantine. In its later&nbsp;state it had a marble façade with three external
