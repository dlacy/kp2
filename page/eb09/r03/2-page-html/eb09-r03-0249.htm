<p><span class="font2">Russell had previously arrived at the conclusion that the </span><span class="font0">j </span><span class="font2">continuance of the war with France was necessary for the </span><span class="font1">∣</span><span class="font2">&nbsp;restoration of the peace of Europe, and his convictions </span><span class="font1">∣</span><span class="font2">&nbsp;were deepened by the experience of travel. On the 4th&nbsp;May 1813, ere he was of age, he was returned for the&nbsp;ducal borough of Tavistock, and in this he resembled Lord&nbsp;Chesterfield and other aristocratic legislators, who were J&nbsp;entrusted with the duty of law-making before they had </span><span class="font1">∣</span><span class="font2">&nbsp;arrived at years of discretion. /Yfter the battle of λ</span><span class="font1">∖</span><span class="font2"> ater- </span><span class="font1">∣</span><span class="font2">&nbsp;loo the Whig representatives in parliament concentrated </span><span class="font1">∣</span><span class="font2">&nbsp;their efforts in promoting financial reform, and in resisting&nbsp;those arbitrary settlements of the Continental countries&nbsp;which found favour in the eyes of Metternich and Castle-reagh. In foreign politics Lord John Russell s oratorical&nbsp;talents were especially shown in his struggles to prevent&nbsp;the union of Norway and Sweden. In domestic questions&nbsp;he cast in his lot with those who opposed the repressive&nbsp;measures of 1817, and protested that the causes of the&nbsp;discontent at home should be removed by remedial legislation. λVhen failure attended all his efforts he resigned his&nbsp;seat for Tavistock, and meditated permanent withdrawal&nbsp;from public life, but was dissuaded from this step by the&nbsp;arguments of his friends, and especially by a poetic appeal&nbsp;from Tom Moore. In the parliament of 1818-20 he&nbsp;again represented the family borough in Devon, andin May&nbsp;1819 began his long advocacy of parliamentary reform by&nbsp;moving for an inquiry into the corruption which prevailed&nbsp;in the Cornish constituency of Grampound. During the&nbsp;first parliament (1820-26) of George IV. the county of&nbsp;Huntingdon accepted Lord John Russell’s services as its&nbsp;representative, and it was his good fortune to secure in&nbsp;1821 the disfranchisement of Grampound, but his satisfaction at this triumph was diminished by the fact that&nbsp;the seats were not transferred to the constituency which&nbsp;he desired. This was the sole parliamentary victory&nbsp;which the advocates of a reform of the representation obtained before 1832, but they found cause for&nbsp;congratulation in other triumphs. Lord John Russell paid&nbsp;the penalty for his advocacy of Catholic emancipation with&nbsp;the loss in 1826 of his seat for Huntingdon county, but he&nbsp;found a shelter in the Irish borough of Bandon Bridge.&nbsp;He led the attack against the Test Acts by carrying in&nbsp;February 1828 with a majority of forty-four a motion for&nbsp;a committee to inquire into their operations, and after&nbsp;this decisive victory they were repealed. He warmly&nbsp;supported the Wellington ministry when it realized that&nbsp;the king’s government could only be carried on by the&nbsp;passing of a Catholic Relief Act. For the greater part of&nbsp;the short-lived parliament of 1830-31 he served his old&nbsp;constituency of Tavistock, having been beaten in a contest&nbsp;for Bedford county at the general election by one vote ;&nbsp;and, when Lord Grey’s Reform ministry was formed, Lord&nbsp;John Russell accepted the office of paymaster-general,&nbsp;though, strange to say, he was not admitted into the sacred&nbsp;precincts of the cabinet. This exclusion from the official&nbsp;hierarchy was rendered the more remarkable by the&nbsp;circumstance that he was selected (1st March 1831) to&nbsp;explain the provisions of the Reform Bill, to which the&nbsp;cabinet had given its formal sanction. The Whig ministry&nbsp;were soon met by defeat, but an appeal to the country&nbsp;increased the number of their adherents, and Lord John&nbsp;Russell himself had the satisfaction of being chosen by the&nbsp;freeholders of Devon as their member. After many a&nbsp;period of doubt and defeat, “ the bill, the whole bill, and&nbsp;nothing but the bill ” passed into law, and Lord John stood&nbsp;forth in the mind of the people as its champion. Although&nbsp;it was not till some years later that he became the leader&nbsp;of the Liberal party, the height of his fame was attained&nbsp;in 1832. After the passing of the Reform Bill he sat for&nbsp;the southern division of Devon, and continued to retain&nbsp;the place of paymaster-general in the ministries of Lord&nbsp;Grey and Lord Melbourne. The former of these cabinets&nbsp;was broken up by the withdrawal of Mr Stanley, afterwards Lord Derby, on the proposal for reforming the Irish&nbsp;Church, when he emphasized Lord John Russell's part in&nbsp;the movements by the saying “ Johnny ’s upset the coach ;”&nbsp;the latter was abruptly, if not rudely, dismissed by William&nbsp;IV. when the death of Lord Spencer promoted the leader&nbsp;of the House of Commons, Lord Althorp, to the peerage,&nbsp;and Lord John Russell was proposed as the spokesman of&nbsp;the ministry in the Commons. At the general election&nbsp;which ensued the Tories received a considerable accession&nbsp;of strength, but not sufficient to ensure their continuance&nbsp;in office, and the adoption by the House of Commons of&nbsp;the proposition of the Whig leader, that the surplus funds&nbsp;of the Irish Church should be applied to general education,&nbsp;necessitated the resignation of Sir Robert Peel’s ministry.&nbsp;In Lord Melbourne’s new administration Lord John&nbsp;Russell became home secretary and leader of the House of&nbsp;Commons, but on his seeking a renewal of confidence from&nbsp;the electors of South Devon, he was defeated and driven&nbsp;to Stroud. Although the course of the Whig ministry&nbsp;was not attended by uniform prosperity, it succeeded in&nbsp;passing a Municipal Reform Bill, and in carrying a settlement of the tithe question in England and Ireland. At&nbsp;the close of its career the troubles in Canada threatened a&nbsp;severance of that dependency from the home country,&nbsp;whereupon Lord John Russell, with a courage which never&nbsp;deserted him, took charge of the department, at that time&nbsp;a dual department, of war and the colonies. In May&nbsp;1839, on an adverse motion concerning the administration&nbsp;of Jamaica, the ministry was left with a majority of five&nbsp;only, and promptly resigned the seals of office. Sir Robert&nbsp;Peel’s attempt to form a ministry was, however, frustrated&nbsp;by the refusal of the queen to dismiss the ladies of the&nbsp;bedchamber, and the Whigs resumed their places. Their&nbsp;prospects brightened when Sir John Yarde Buller’s motion&nbsp;of “no confidence” was defeated by twenty-one, but the&nbsp;glimpse of sunlight soon faded, and a similar vote was&nbsp;some months later carried by a majority of one, whereupon&nbsp;the Whig leader announced a dissolution of parliament&nbsp;(1841). At the polling booth his friends were smitten hip&nbsp;and thigh ; the return of Lord John Russell for the City of&nbsp;London was almost their solitary triumph. On Sir Robert&nbsp;Peel’s resignation (1846) the task of forming an administration was entrusted to Lord John Russell, and he remained&nbsp;at the head of affairs from 1846 to 1852, but his tenure of&nbsp;office was not marked by any great legislative enactments.&nbsp;His celebrated Durham letter on the threatened assumption of ecclesiastical titles by the Roman Catholic bishops&nbsp;weakened the attachment of the “ Peelites ” and alienated&nbsp;his Irish supporters. The impotence of their opponents,&nbsp;rather than the strength of their friends, kept the Whig&nbsp;ministry in power, and, although beaten by a majority of&nbsp;nearly two to one on Mr Locke King’s County Franchise&nbsp;Bill in February 1851, it could not divest itself of office.&nbsp;Lord Palmerston’s unauthorized recognition of the French&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">coup d'etat</span><span class="font2"> was followed by his dismissal, but he had&nbsp;his revenge in the ejectment of his old colleagues a few&nbsp;months later. During Lord Aberdeen’s administration&nbsp;Lord John Russell led the Lower House, at first as foreign&nbsp;secretary, then without portfolio, and lastly as president of the council. In 1854 he brought in a Reform&nbsp;Bill, but in consequence of the war with Russia the bill&nbsp;was allowed, much to its author’s mortification, to drop.&nbsp;His popularity was diminished by this failure, and although&nbsp;he resigned in January 1855, on Mr Roebuck’s Crimea&nbsp;motion, he did not regain his old position in the country.&nbsp;At the Vienna conference (1855) Lord John Russell was&nbsp;England’s representative, and immediately on his return</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
