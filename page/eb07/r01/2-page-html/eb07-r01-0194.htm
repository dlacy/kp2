<p><span class="font0">whom are Protestants, except about 200 Jews. It is an agricultural district, and the character of its soil and productions resembles that of the other parts of Saxony. The&nbsp;dominions of the younger branch consist of several detached lordships, extending over 472 square miles, and contain 52,205 inhabitants, all adhering to the Lutheran profession. The income of these states amounts together to&nbsp;L.54,000. The soil and productions of both are similar.&nbsp;The military contingent required by the German confederation for both the states is 742 men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">REUTLINGEN, a city of the kingdom of Wirtemberg, in the province of the Black Forest, the capital of the bailiwick of the same name. It is situated on the river Echaz,&nbsp;and is surrounded with walls and ditches. It contains four&nbsp;Lutheran churches, one of which, that of Maria, is remarkable for its tower, 340 feet in height. It contains 1250&nbsp;houses, mostly built in the style of the middle ages, and the&nbsp;inhabitants amount to 9200. It is celebrated for its leather manufactories ; and paper, cutlery, hardware, and many&nbsp;smaller articles, are produced. In the vicinity good wine is&nbsp;made. Long. 9. 3. 15. E. Lat. 48. 29. 15. N.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">REVE, Reeve, or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Grève,</span><span class="font0"> the bailiff of a franchise or manor, and so called, especially in the west of England.&nbsp;Hence shire-reeve, sheriff, port-greve, and the like.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">REVEILLE, a beat of drum about break of day, to give notice that it is time for the soldiers to rise, and that the&nbsp;sentries are to forbear challenging.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">REVELATION, the act of revealing, or making a thing public that was before unknown ; it is also used to signify&nbsp;the discoveries made by God to his prophets, and by them&nbsp;to the world ; and more particularly includes the books of&nbsp;the Old and New Testament. See Theology.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">REVELS, entertainments of dancing, masking, acting comedies, farces, and the like, anciently very frequent in&nbsp;the inns of court and in noblemen’s houses, but now much&nbsp;disused. The officer who had the direction of the revels at&nbsp;court was called the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Master of the Revels,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">REVENGE means the return of injury for injury, and differs materially from that sudden resentment which rises&nbsp;in the mind immediately on being injured ; which, so far&nbsp;from being culpable when restrained within due bounds, is&nbsp;absolutely necessary for self-preservation. Revenge, on&nbsp;the contrary, is a cool and deliberate wickedness, and is&nbsp;often executed years after the offence had been given; and&nbsp;the desire of it is generally the effect of littleness, weakness, and vice, whilst to do right, and to suffer wrong, is a&nbsp;mark of a great soul, that scorns to stoop to suggested revenge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">REVENUE. See the articles England, Funding System, Political Economy, and Taxation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">REVERBERATION, in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Physics,</span><span class="font0"> the act of a body repelling or reflecting another after its impinging thereon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Reverberation, in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chemistry,</span><span class="font0"> denotes a kind of circulation of the flame by means of a reverberatory furnace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">REVEREND, a title of respect given to ecclesiastics. The religious abroad are called reverend fathers, and abbesses, prioresses, and others reverend mothers. In England, bishops are right reverend, and archbishops most reverend. In France, before the Revolution, the bishops,&nbsp;archbishops, and abbots, were all alike most reverend. In&nbsp;Scotland, the clergy individually are reverend, a synod is&nbsp;very reverend, and the general assembly is venerable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">REVERIE, the same with delirium, raving, or distraction. It is used also for any ridiculous, extravagant imagination, action, or proposition ; a chimera, or vision. But the most ordinary use of the word amongst English writers&nbsp;is for a deep disorderly musing or meditation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">REVERSION, in the law of England, has two significations ; the one of which is, an estate left, which continues during a particular state in being ; and the other is the returning of the land, after the particular estate is ended ;</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">and it is further said to be an interest in lands, when the possession of it fails, or where the estate, which was for a&nbsp;time parted with, returns to the granters or their heirs.&nbsp;But, according to the usual definition of a reversion, it is&nbsp;the residue of an estate left in the granter, after a particular estate granted away ceases, continuing in the granter of&nbsp;such an estate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The difference between a remainder and a reversion consists in this, that the remainder may belong to any man except the granter ; whereas the reversion returns to him who conveyed the lands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Reversion, in annuities. See Annuities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">REVIVIFICATION, in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chemistry,</span><span class="font0"> a term generally applied to the distillation of quicksilver from cinnabar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Revivification, in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Physiology,</span><span class="font0"> the recalling to life of animals apparently dead. There are many kinds of insects&nbsp;which may be revivified, after all the powers of animation&nbsp;have been suspended for a considerable time. Common&nbsp;flies, small beetles, spiders, moths, bugs, &amp;c. after being&nbsp;drowned in spirit of wine, and continuing apparently dead&nbsp;for upwards of fifteen minutes, have been restored to life&nbsp;merely by being thrown amongst wood-ashes slightly warm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Whilst Dr Franklin was in France, he received a quantity of Madeira wine from America, which had been bottled in Virginia. He found a few dead flies in some of the&nbsp;bottles, which he exposed to the sun in the month of July ;&nbsp;and in less than three hours these seemingly dead animals&nbsp;recovered life which had been so long suspended. At first&nbsp;they appeared as if convulsed ; they then raised themselves&nbsp;on their legs, washed their eyes with their fore feet, dressed&nbsp;their wings with those behind, and in a short time began to&nbsp;fly about.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But the most remarkable instance of revivification we have heard of is the following. In the warmer parts of&nbsp;France there is an insect very pernicious to the rye, apparently beginning its operations at the foot of the plant, and&nbsp;gradually proceeding towards the ear. If the plant be thoroughly dried whilst the insect is in the root or stem, the&nbsp;animal is irrecoverably killed ; but after it has reached the&nbsp;grain, the case is very different. There have been instances&nbsp;of these insects being brought to life in fifteen minutes, by&nbsp;a little warm water, after the grains in which they were&nbsp;lodged had been kept dry for thirty years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">What is the metaphysician to think of these phenomena, or what conclusion is he to draw from them respecting the&nbsp;mind ? If he be a sober man he will draw no conclusion,&nbsp;and for this reason, that he knows nothing of the sentient&nbsp;principle of insects, or of any animal but man. He is conscious that it is the same individual being that, in himself,&nbsp;thinks, and wills, and feels ; he knows that part of his&nbsp;thought is not in one place, and part of it in another ; and&nbsp;therefore he concludes that this thinking being is not matter, <sup>,</sup>whιlst experience teaches him that it quits the material system when that becomes unfit to discharge its functions, and cannot be recalled. Experience teaches him,&nbsp;on the other hand, that the sentient principle of these insects does not quit the system when unfit for its functions ;&nbsp;and hence he ought to infer, that the minds of men and&nbsp;of insects are very different, and that the bond which unites&nbsp;the material and immaterial parts of an insect is certainly&nbsp;different from that which unites the mind and body of man.&nbsp;This is the only inference which can be fairly drawn from&nbsp;these phenomena.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">REVIEW, a term applied to literary journals, which give a periodical view of the state of literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">REVOLUTION, in politics, signifies a change in the constitution of a state, and is a word of different import&nbsp;from revolt, with which it is sometimes confounded. When&nbsp;a people withdraw their obedience from their governors&nbsp;for any particular reason, without overturning the government, or waging an offensive war against it, they are in &amp;</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
