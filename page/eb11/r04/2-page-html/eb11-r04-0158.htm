<p><span class="font0">sham. About a thousand Romans perished by the sword or by drowning, but their fellow-citizens made such determined preparations to continue the struggle that Frederick, on the 19th of&nbsp;June, hastily retreated, or rather fled, and was escorted as far&nbsp;as Tivoli by the pope and the cardinals. After all, the temporal&nbsp;power of the papacy was not restored, and the republic still survived in the form bestowed on it by Arnold of Brescia.&nbsp;Its existence was in truth favourable rather than&nbsp;injurious to Frederick, whose aim was to rule over&nbsp;Rome and treat the bishops as his vassals. He had&nbsp;not yet discerned that his best policy would have been to use&nbsp;the republic as a lever against the pope. The latter, with&nbsp;keener acumen, while remaining faithful to the feudal party in&nbsp;Rome, made alliance with the communes of Lombardy and encouraged them in their resistance to the emperor. Adrian IV.&nbsp;died in 1159, and the national party elected Alexander III.&nbsp;(1159-81), who energetically opposed the pretensions of&nbsp;Frederick, but, having to struggle with three antipopes successively raised against him by the imperial party, was repeatedly&nbsp;driven into exile. During these schisms the senate quietly&nbsp;carried on the government, administered justice, and made war&nbsp;on some neighbouring cities and barons. An army comprising&nbsp;many nobles of the national party marched against Tusculum,&nbsp;but found it defended by several valiant officers and a strong&nbsp;band of German soldiery, who, on the 29th of May 1167, inflicted&nbsp;on the Romans so severe a defeat that it is styled’by Gregorovius&nbsp;the Cannae of the middle ages. Shortly afterwards the emperor&nbsp;arrived in Rome with his antipope Paschal III., and Alexander&nbsp;had to fly before him to Benevento. Then, at last, Frederick&nbsp;came to terms with the republic, recognized the senate, which&nbsp;accepted investiture at his hands, re-established the prefecture&nbsp;as an imperial office, and bestowed it on Giovanni, son of Pietro&nbsp;di Vico. He then hastily departed, without having advanced&nbsp;outside the Leonine city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Meanwhile Pope Alexander continued the crafty policy of Adrian and with better success, for the Lombard cities had&nbsp;now formed a league and inflicted a signal defeat on&nbsp;the emperor at Legnano on the 29th of May 1176. One&nbsp;of the results of this battle was the conclusion of&nbsp;an agreement between the pope and the emperor, the&nbsp;latter resigning his pretensions on Rome and yielding&nbsp;all that he had denied to Adrian. And by the treaty of Venice&nbsp;(1st of August 1177) the antipope was forsaken, Alexander III.&nbsp;recognized and hailed as the legitimate pontiff, and the prefect of&nbsp;Rome again nominated by the pope, to whom the emperor&nbsp;restored the temporal power, acknowledging him the independent sovereign of Rome and of the ecclesiastical state,&nbsp;from Acquapendente to Ceprano. Frederick’s troops accompanied the pope to Rome, where the republic was forced&nbsp;to make submission to him. But, proudly conscious as&nbsp;it still was of its strength, its surrender wore the aspect of a&nbsp;voluntary concession, and its terms began with these words:&nbsp;“ Totius populi Romani consilio et deliberatione statu turn est,”&nbsp;&amp;c. The senators, elected yearly in September, had to swear&nbsp;fealty to the pope, and a certain proportion of nobles was included in their number. On his return to Rome, Alexander&nbsp;received a solemn welcome from all, but be had neither extinguished nor really subdued the republic. On the contrary,&nbsp;men’s minds were more and more inflamed by the example of&nbsp;freedom displayed in the north of Italy. He died on the 30th&nbsp;of August 1181. The fact that between 1181 and 1187 there were&nbsp;three popes always living in exile proves that the republic was&nbsp;by no means crushed. During the same period another blow&nbsp;was inflicted on- the papacy by the marriage of Henry VI.,&nbsp;son and successor to Frederick I., with Constance, sole heiress&nbsp;of the Norman line in Naples. For thus the kingdom was&nbsp;joined to the empire, and the popes were more than ever in the&nbsp;latter’s power. On the 20th of December 1187 Clement III.&nbsp;(1187-91), being raised to the pontificate, made a solemn agreement with the government of the Capitol before coming to&nbsp;Rome. And this peace or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">concordia</span><span class="font0"> had the air of a treaty&nbsp;between potentates of equal importance. Rome confronted</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font0">the pope from the same standpoint from which the Lombard cities had confronted the emperor after Legnano. This treaty,&nbsp;the basis of the new constitution, was confirmed on the last day&nbsp;of May 1188 (Anno XLIV. of the senate). It begins with these&nbsp;words: “ Concordia inter Dominum Papam Clementem III.&nbsp;et senatores populumque Romanum super rcgalibus et aliis&nbsp;dignitatibus urbis.” The pope was recognized as supreme lord,&nbsp;and invested the senators with their dignity. He resumed the&nbsp;privilege of coinage, but allowed one-third of the issue to&nbsp;be made by the senate. Almost all the old pontifical rights&nbsp;and prerogatives were restored to him. The pope might employ&nbsp;the Roman militia for the defence of his patrimony, but was to&nbsp;furnish its pay. The rights of the church over Tivoli and&nbsp;Tusculum were confirmed; but the republic reserved to itself&nbsp;the right of making war on those cities, and declared its resolve&nbsp;to dismantle and destroy the walls and castle of Tusculum.&nbsp;In this undertaking the pope was to co-operate with the&nbsp;Romans, even should the unhappy city make surrender to him&nbsp;alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">From all this it is clear that the church had been made independent of the empire, and that the republic, despite its numerous concessions, was by no means subject to the church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The pope, in fact, had obtained liberty of election, and Frederick I., by resigning the investiture of the prefect, had virtually renounced his claim to imperial&nbsp;power in Rome. The republic had no patrician nor any&nbsp;other imperial magistrate, and preserved its independence&nbsp;even as regarded the pope, who merely granted investiture&nbsp;to magistrates freely chosen by the people, and had no&nbsp;legislative nor administrative power in the city. His temporal&nbsp;dominion was limited to his great possessions, to his regalia,&nbsp;to a supreme authority that was very indefinite, and to a&nbsp;feudal authority over the barons of the Campagna and many&nbsp;cities of a state that seemed ever on the point of dissolution.&nbsp;The senate continued to frame laws, to govern, and to administer&nbsp;justice. The army carried on the wars of the republic,&nbsp;as we see by the tragic fate of Tusculum, which was razed to&nbsp;the ground on the 19th of April 1191. Thus the powerful&nbsp;counts of Tusculum disappeared; they sought refuge in the&nbsp;Campagna, and according to all probability the no less potent&nbsp;family of the Colonna sprang from their line. In consequence&nbsp;of these events, the nobles realized that the papacy sought&nbsp;to reduce them to vassalage. And, seeing that the&nbsp;republic remained firmly established and able to help&nbsp;them, they began to adhere to it and succeeded in&nbsp;obtaining admission to the new senate. In fact,&nbsp;whereas since 1143 plebeians and petty nobles&nbsp;had prevailed in its ranks, nobles of ancient descent are&nbsp;now found outnumbering the knights and burghers.&nbsp;But in 1191 this state of things caused a sudden popular&nbsp;outbreak which abolished the aristocratic senate&nbsp;and gave the headship of the republic to a single&nbsp;senator, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">summits senator</span><span class="font0">, named Benedetto “ Carissi-mus ” or “ Cams Homo ” or “ Carosomo,” of unknown, but undoubtedly plebeian, origin. During&nbsp;the two years he remained in office this personage&nbsp;stripped the pope of his revenues, despatched&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">justitiarti</span><span class="font0"> even to the provinces, and with the aid of the parliament and other popular assemblies promulgated laws and&nbsp;statutes. But he was overthrown by a counter-revolution, and&nbsp;Giovanni Capoccio of the party of the nobles became senator&nbsp;for two years, and had been succeeded by one of the Pierleoni&nbsp;when, in 1197, a fresh revolution re-established a senate of&nbsp;fifty-six members, chiefly consisting of feudal barons in high&nbsp;favour with Henry VI., who had revived the imperial faction&nbsp;in Rome. But this emperor’s life ended the same year as the&nbsp;pope’s, in 1198, and the new pontiff, Innocent III. (1198-1216),&nbsp;began to make war on the nobles, who were again masters of&nbsp;the republic. Their leader was the prefect Pietro di Vico.&nbsp;Owing to the revolution of 1143, most of the prefectorial attributes were now vested in the senate; nevertheless, Pietro&nbsp;still retained a tribunal of police both within and without the</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
