He obſerved that it moves with more velocity through young than through old branches. In one young branch it moved through ſeven feet in one day, the thermometer being at 49, while it moved in the trunk of the tree only ſeven feet in ſeven days. Dr Walker has thus explained the reaſon why the buds on the extremities of branches unfold firſt; becauſe they are placed on the youngeſt wood, to which the ſap flows moſt abundantly.</p><p>The effects produced by the motion of the ſap deferve to be attended to. In thoſe parts to which it has mounted, the bark eaſily ſeparates from the wood, and the ligneous circles may, without difficulty, be detached from one another. The buds begin to ſwell and their ſcales to ſeparate, while thoſe branches to which the ſap has not aſcended remain cloſely folded. When the ſap has reached the extremities of the branches, and has thus pervaded the whole plant, it is ſoon covered with opening buds and ceaſes to bleed. The bleeding ceaſes firſt in the upper parts of the tree, and in the lower parts ſucceſſively downwards, and the wood becomes dry. An inverted branch flows more copiouſly when cut than thoſe which are erect. This is a proof that the aſcent of the ſap is not occaſioned by capillary attraction, for water which has riſen in a ſmall glaſs tube by this attraction will not deſcend when the tube is inverted.</p><p>It is evident that there is an intimate connection between heat and the aſcent of the ſap. It did not begin to flow till the thermometer ſtood at a certain point: when it fell below 40, it was arreſted in its progreſs. The ſouth fide of the tree, when the ſun was bright, bled more profuſely than the north fide; and at ſun-ſet the inciſions at the top ceaſed to bleed, where it was expoſed moſt to the cold air, while it ſtill continued to flow from the incifions next to the ground; the ground retaining its heat longer than the air.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sap,</hi> in ſieges, is a trench, or an approach made under cover of 10 or 1 2 feet broad, when the beſiegers come near the place, and the fire from the garriſon grows ſo dangerous that they are not able to approach uncovered. —There are ſeveral forts of ſaps; the ſingle, which has only a ſingle parapet; the double, having one on each ſide; and the flying, made with gabions, &amp;c.

The ſaponaria, with winged leaves, grows naturally in the iſlands of the Weit Indies, where it riſes with a woody ſtalk from 20 to 30 feet high, fending out many branches garniſhed with winged leaves compoſed of ſeveral pair of ſpear-ſhaped lobes. The midrib has a membranaceous or leafy border, running on each fide from one pair of lobes to the other, which is broadeſt in the middle between the lobes; the flowers are produced in looſe ſpikes at the end of the branches; they are ſmall and white, ſo make no great appearance.

In three weeks or a month after the plants appear, they will be fit to be tranſplanted, when they muſt be ſhaken out of the pots, and carefully parted, ſo as not to injure their roots, and each planted into a ſeparate ſmall pot, and plunged into the hot-bed again, obſerving to ſhade them from the ſun until they have taken new root; after which time they muſt have free air admitted to them every day when the weather is warm, and will require to be frequently watered.</p><p>SAPONARIA, <hi rend="smallcaps">Sopewort,</hi> in botany: A genus of the digynia order, belonging to the decandria claſs of plants; and in the natural method ranking under the 22d order, <hi rend="italic">Caryoρhylleae</hi> The calyx is monophyllous and naked; there are five ungulated petals; the capſule is oblong and unilocular.</p><p>There are eight ſpecies, the officinalis, vaccaria, cretica, porrigens, illyrica, ocymoides, orientalis, and lutea.

The footſtalks of the flowers ariſe from the wings of the leaves oppoſite; they ſuſtain four, five, or more purple flowers each; which have generally two ſmall leaves placed under them. The ſtalk is alſo terminated by a looſe bunch of flowers growing in form of an umbel; they have each a large ſwelling cylindrical empalement, and five broad obtuſe petals, which ſpread open, of a purple colour.
