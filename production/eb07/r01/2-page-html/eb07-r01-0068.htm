<p><span class="font1">fended by a fort. It contains about 500 houses and 2000 inhabitants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ramsey, a small island on the shore of the county of Pembroke, in South Wales. It is nearly three quarters of&nbsp;a mile in length and half a mile in breadth, and forms the&nbsp;north point of St Bride’s Bay. It was formerly much frequented by persons passing to Ireland, being the shortest&nbsp;water distance between the two islands ; as from St Bride’s&nbsp;to Camaroot Point, on the south-east angle of Ireland, is&nbsp;only sixteen leagues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RAMSGATE, a large town and port, originally a hamlet, in the parish of St Lawrence, in the Isle of Thanet, in&nbsp;Kent, seventy-three miles from London, and seventeen&nbsp;from Canterbury. It is situated in a pleasant valley on the&nbsp;shore, with extensive views of the sea from the North and&nbsp;South Foreland, and of the shipping in the Downs. It has&nbsp;owed its rise to the construction of a most costly pier, by&nbsp;which a harbour has been created, which serves as a refuge&nbsp;for ships in stormy weather. It is capable of containing&nbsp;500 sail of vessels. The pier extends 800 feet into the&nbsp;sea, and its top, which is twenty-six feet broad, furnishes a&nbsp;fine promenade. A new inner harbour is in progress,&nbsp;and will speedily be opened. Ramsgate, like Margate, has&nbsp;become a favourite place of resort for sea-bathing ; and&nbsp;though it has long bcen so, the number of visitors has vastly increased since the introduction of steam-vessels, by&nbsp;which passengers may in a few hours be conveyed to and&nbsp;from the metropolis. The accommodations for bathers are&nbsp;good, and there are abundance of hotels and lodging-houses to be procured at a moderate rate. There are a fine&nbsp;assembly-room, numerous libraries, and a handsome chapel,&nbsp;with meeting-houses for the various dissenting sects. It&nbsp;has some trade to the Baltic ; and many of the lowcr classes&nbsp;are occupied as fishermen, pilots, and watermen. It is in&nbsp;the liberty of the cinque port of Sandwich. The population amounted in 1801 to 3110, in 1811 to 4222, in 1821&nbsp;to 6031, and in 1831 to 7985.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RAM U S, Peteb, was one of the most celebrated professors of the sixteenth century. Hewas born in Picardy in 1515.&nbsp;A thirst for learning prompted him, when very young, to repair to Paris, and he was admitted as a servant in the college of Navarre. Spending the day in waiting on his masters, and the greater part of the night in study, he made&nbsp;such surprising progress, that, when he took his degree as&nbsp;master of arts, lie ottered to maintain a doctrine quite opposite to that of Aristotle. This raised him many enemies ;&nbsp;and the first two books he published, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Institutiones Dialec-ticœ</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Aristotelicw Animadversiones,</span><span class="font1"> occasioned great&nbsp;disturbances in the university of Paris. The opposition&nbsp;against him was not a little heightened by his deserting the&nbsp;Catholic religion, and professing that of the Reformed. Being thereby forced to retire from Paris, he visited the universities of Germany, and received great honours wherever&nbsp;he went. He returned to France in 1571, and lost his life&nbsp;miserably during the massacre of St Bartholomew’s day.&nbsp;He was a great orator, a man of general learning, and endowed with fine moral qualities. He published many books,&nbsp;which Teissier enumerates. Ramus’s merit in his opposition to Aristotle, and his firmness in undermining his authority, is unquestionably very great. But it has been doubted,&nbsp;and with much reason, whether he was equally successful&nbsp;in his attempts to form a new logical institute. The following general outline of his plan is given in Dr Enfield’s&nbsp;History of Philosophy. “ Considering dialectics as the art&nbsp;of deducing conclusions from premises, he endeavours to&nbsp;improve this art, by uniting it with that of rhetoric. Of the&nbsp;several branches of rhetoric, he considers invention and disposition as belonging equally to logic. Making Cicero his&nbsp;chief guide, he divides his treatise on dialectics into two&nbsp;parts, the first of which treats of the invention of arguments, the second of judgments. Arguments he derives&nbsp;not only from what the Aristotelians call middle terms, but&nbsp;from any kind of proposition, which, connected with another, may serve to prove any assertion. Of these he enumerates various kinds. Judgments he divides into axioms,&nbsp;or self-evident propositions, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">dianoea,</span><span class="font1"> or deductions by&nbsp;means of a series of arguments. Both these he divides into&nbsp;various classes ; and illustrates the whole by examples from&nbsp;the ancient orators and poets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“ In the logic of Ramus, many things are borrowed from Aristotle, and only appear under new names; and many&nbsp;others are derived from other Grecian sources, particularly&nbsp;from the dialogues of Plato, and the logic of the Stoics.&nbsp;The author has the merit of turning the art of reasoning&nbsp;from the futile speculations of the schools to forensic and&nbsp;common use ; but his plan is defective in confining the&nbsp;whole dialectic art to the single object of disputation, and&nbsp;in omitting many things, which respect the general culture&nbsp;of the understanding and the investigation of truth. Notwithstanding the defects of his system, we cannot, however, subscribe to the severe censure which has been passed upon Ramus by Lord Bacon and others ; for much is,&nbsp;we think, due to him for having with so much firmness and&nbsp;perseverance asserted the natural freedom of the human&nbsp;understanding. The logic of Ramus obtained great authority in the schools of Germany, Great Britain, Holland,&nbsp;and France ; and long and violent contests arose between his&nbsp;followers and those of the Stagyrite, till his fame vanished&nbsp;before that of Descartes.”</span></p>
