They consist of large unworked&nbsp;blocks of a travertine which naturally splits into roughly rectangular blocks; these are quite irregular, and often as much&nbsp;as 9 ft. long by 4 ft. wide: in the interstices smaller pieces are&nbsp;inserted. The walls are embanking walls, with a low breastwork&nbsp;in places. Within the circuit which they enclose, now under&nbsp;cultivation, are two summits, one occupied by a Roman amphitheatre [the other by a tower (?) of uncertain date]: a Roman&nbsp;cistern also is visible. Some 2 m. S.S.W. are modern baths,&nbsp;fed by hot springs, which were in use in Roman times also, as&nbsp;the discovery of remains of Roman buildings shows.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RUSH, BENJAMIN (1745-1813), American physician, was bom in By berry township, near Philadelphia, on a homestead&nbsp;founded by his grandfather, a Quaker gunsmith, who had followed&nbsp;Penn from England in 1683. In 1760 he graduated at Princeton.&nbsp;After serving an apprenticeship of six years with a doctor in&nbsp;Philadelphia, he went for two years to Edinburgh, where he&nbsp;attached himself chiefly to William Cullen. He took his M.D.&nbsp;degree there in 1768, spent a year more in the hospitals of&nbsp;London and Paris, and began practice in Philadelphia at the&nbsp;age of twenty-four, undertaking at the same time the chemistry&nbsp;class at the Philadelphia medical college. He was a friend of&nbsp;Franklin, a member of Congress for the state of Pennsylvania in&nbsp;1776, and one of those who signed the Declaration of Independence the same year. He had already written on the Test Laws,&nbsp;“ Sermons to the Rich,” and on negro slavery; and in 1774&nbsp;he started along with James Pemberton the first anti-slavery&nbsp;society in America, and was its secretary for many years.&nbsp;In 1787 he was a member of the Pennsylvania convention&nbsp;which adopted the Federal constitution, and thereafter&nbsp;he retired from public life, and gave himself up wholly to&nbsp;medical practice. In 1789 he exchanged his chemistry lectureship for that of the theory and practice of physic; and when&nbsp;the medical college, which he had helped to found, was absorbed&nbsp;by the university of Pennsylvania in 1791 he became professor&nbsp;of the institutes of medicine and of clinical practice, succeeding&nbsp;in 1796 to the chair of the theory and practice of medicine. He&nbsp;gained great credit when the yellow fever devastated Philadelphia, in 1793, by his assiduity in visiting the sick, and by his&nbsp;bold and apparently successful treatment of the disease by&nbsp;bloodletting. He died in Philadelphia on the 19th of April&nbsp;1813, after a five days<sup>1</sup> illness from typhus fever. His son&nbsp;Richard is separately noticed. Another son, James (1786-1869),&nbsp;was a physician, and author of various books, such as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Philosophy&nbsp;of the Human Voice</span><span class="font0"> (1827) and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Analysis of the Human Intellect&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(1865).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Benjamin Rush’s writings covered an immense range of subjects, including language, the study of Latin and Greek, the moral faculty,&nbsp;capital punishment, medicine among the American Indians, maple&nbsp;sugar, the blackness of the negro, the cause of animal life, tobacco&nbsp;smoking, spirit drinking, as well as many more strictly professional&nbsp;topics. His last workwas an elaborate treatise on the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Diseases of&nbsp;the Mind</span><span class="font0"> (1812). He is best known by the five volumes of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Medical&nbsp;Inquiries and Observations</span><span class="font0"> ».which he brought out at intervals from&nbsp;1789 to 1798 (two later editions revised by the author).</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RUSH, RICHARD (1780-1859), American statesman and diplomatist, son of Dr Benjamin Rush, was born in Philadelphia,&nbsp;Pennsylvania, on the 29th of August 1780. He graduated at&nbsp;Princeton in 1797, and was admitted to the bar in 1800. He&nbsp;was attorney-general of Pennsylvania in 1811, comptroller of&nbsp;the treasury of the United States in 1811-14, attorney-general in the cabinet of President James Madison in 1814-17,&nbsp;acting secretary of state from March to September 1817, minister&nbsp;to </span><span class="font1">Great </span><span class="font0">Britain in 1817-25, secretary </span><span class="font1">of the treasury </span><span class="font0">in the&nbsp;cabinet of President J. Q. Adams in 1825-29, and candidate for&nbsp;vice-president on the Adams ticket in 1828. In 1818, while&nbsp;minister to Great Britain, he, in association with Albert Gallatin,&nbsp;concluded with British plenipotentiaries the important treaty&nbsp;which determined the boundary line between the United States&nbsp;and Canada from the Lake of the Woods to the Rocky Mountains and provided for the joint occupation of Oregon for ten&nbsp;years. He also conducted the negotiations with Canning in&nbsp;1823 relating to the S. American policy of the Holy Alliance.&nbsp;He followed the Adams-Clay faction of the Democratic-Republican party in the split of 1825-28, but returned to&nbsp;the Democratic party about 1834 on the bank issue. In 1835&nbsp;he and Benjamin C. Howard, of Baltimore, Maryland, were&nbsp;sent by President Jackson to prevent an outbreak of hostilities&nbsp;in the Ohio-Michigan boundary dispute. In 1836-38 Rush was&nbsp;commissioner to receive the Smithson legacy (see Smithsonian&nbsp;Institution), and in 1847-49 he was minister to France.&nbsp;He died at Philadelphia on the 30th of July 1859.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RUSH. Under the name of rush or rushes, the stalks or hollow stem-like leaves of several plants have minor industrial&nbsp;applications. The common rushes (species of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">J uncus; </span><span class="font0">see&nbsp;Juncaceae) are used in many parts of the world for chair-bottoms, mats and basket-work, and the pith serves as wicks&nbsp;in open oil-lamps and for tallow candles—whence rushlight.&nbsp;The fibrous stems and leaves of the bulrush or reed-mace,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Typha angustifolia,</span><span class="font0"> are used in N. India for ropes, mats and&nbsp;baskets. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Scirpus</span><span class="font0"> and other Cyperaceae are used for chair-bottoms, mats and thatch; the rush mats of Madras are made&nbsp;from a species of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Cyperus.</span><span class="font0"> The sweet-rush, yielding essential&nbsp;oil, is a grass, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Andropogon Schoenanthus,</span><span class="font0"> known also as lemon&nbsp;grass. Large quantities of the “horse-tail,” </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Equisetum hie-male,</span><span class="font0"> are used under the name of Dutch or scouring rush for&nbsp;scouring metal and other hard surfaces on account of the large&nbsp;proportion of silica the plant contains. Flowering rush is&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bulomus umbellaius</span><span class="font0"> (see Alismaceae); wood-rush is the&nbsp;common name for </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Luzula</span><span class="font0"> (see Juncaceae). </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Acorus Calamus,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">sweet-flag, is also known as sweet-rush.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RUSHDEN, an urban district in the E. parliamentary division of Northamptonshire, England, 66 m. N.N.W. from London&nbsp;by the Midland railway. Pop. (1901) 12,453. The church&nbsp;of St Mary is a fine cruciform building with western tower&nbsp;and spire. It is mainly decorated, with perpendicular additions, but retains some Early English details. The growth of&nbsp;Rushden as a town is modern. The industrial population is&nbsp;employed in boot and shoe making, the local staple.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RUSH WORTH, JOHN (c. 1612-1690), the compiler of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Historical Collections</span><span class="font0"> commonly described by his name, was&nbsp;the son of Lawrence Rushworth of Acklington Park, Wark-worth, Northumberland. When he was given the degree of&nbsp;M.A. at Oxford in 1649, he was said to belong to Queen’s College,&nbsp;but there are no traces of his presence at the university. He&nbsp;was bred to the law, and in 1638 was appointed solicitor to&nbsp;the town of Berwick. He was enrolled in Lincoln’s Inn in&nbsp;1641, and was called to the bar in 1647. He made a point of&nbsp;attending on all public occasions of a political and judicial&nbsp;character, such as proceedings before the Star Chamber or the&nbsp;Council, and of making shorthand notes of them. On the 25th&nbsp;of April 1640 he was appointed an assistant clerk to the House&nbsp;of Commons. He was on duty when King Charles I. came&nbsp;down to arrest the five members on the 4th of January 1642,&nbsp;and made notes of his speech. The king insisted on taking&nbsp;the notes, and ordered them to be published. Rushworth</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
