See there, <hi rend="italic">Table oſ the Muſcles.</hi></p><p>SCALIGER (Julius Caeſar), a learned critic, poet, phyſician, and philoſopher; was born at the caſtle oſ Ripa, in the territories of Verona, in 1484; and is ſaid to have been deſcended from the ancient princes of Verona, though this is not mentioned in the letters of naturalization he obtained in France in 1528. He learned the firſt rudiments of the Latin tongue in his own country; and in his 12th year was preſented to the Emperor Maximilian, who made him one of his pages. He ſerved that emperor 17 years, and gave  ſignal proofs of his valour and conduct in ſeveral expeditions. He was preſent at the battle of Ravenna in April 151<hi rend="italic">2,</hi> in which he had the misfortune to loſe his father Benedict Scaliger, and his brother Titus; on which his mother died with grief: when being reduced to neceſſitous circumſtances, he entered into the order of the Franciſcans, and applied himſelf to ſtudy at Bologna; but ſoon after changing his mind with reſpect to his becoming a monk, he took arms again, and ſerved in Piedmont. At which time a phyſician perſuaded him to ſtudy phyſic, which he did at his leiſure-hours, and alſo learned Greek; and at laſt the gout determined him, at 40 years of age, to abandon a military life. He ſoon after ſettled at Agen, where he married, and began to apply himſelf ſeriouſly to his ſtudies. He learned firſt the French tongue, which he ſpoke perfectly in three months; and then made himſelf mailer of the Gaſcon, Italian, Spaniſh, German, Hungarian, and Sclavonian: but the chief object of his ſtudies was polite literature. Meanwhile, he ſupported his family by the practice of phyſic. He did not publiſh any of his works till he was 47 years of age; when he ſoon gained a great name in the republic of letters. He had a graceful perſon, and ſo ſtrong a memory, even in his old age, that he dictated to his ſon 200 verſes which he had compoſed the day before, and retained without writing them down. He was ſo charitable, that his houſe was as it were an hoſpital for the poor and ſick; and he had ſuch an averſion to lying, that he would have no correſpondence with thoſe who were given to that vice; but, on the other hand, he had much vanity, and a ſatirical ſpirit, which created him many enemies. He died of a retention of urine in 1558. He wrote in Latin, 1. A Treatiſe on the Art of Poetry. 2. Exercitations againſt Carden: which works are much eſteemed. 3. Commentaries on Ariſtotle’s Hiſtory of Animals, and on Theophraſtus on Plants. 4. Some Treatiſes on Phyſic. 5. Letters, Orations, Poems, and other works, in Latin.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Scaliger,</hi> (Joſeph Juſtus), one of the moſt learned critics and writers of his time; he was the ſon of the former, and was born at Agen in France in 1540. He ſtudied in the college oſ Bourdeaux; after which his father took him under his own care, and employed him in tranſcribing his poems; by which means he obtained ſuch a taſte for poetry, that before he was 17 years old he wrote a tragedy upon the ſubject of Oedipus, in which he introduced all the poetical ornaments of ſtyle and ſentiment. His father dying in 1558, he went to Paris the year following, with a deſign to apply himſelf to the Greek tongue. For this purpoſe he for two months attended the lectures of Turnebus; but finding that in the uſual courſe he ſhould be a long</p><p>time in gaining his point, he ſhut himſelf up in his cloſet, and by conſtant application for two years gained a perfect knowledge of that language. After which he applied to the Hebrew, which he learned by himſelf with great facility. He made no leſs progreſs in the ſciences; and his writings procured him the reputation of one of the greateſt men of that or any other age. He embraced the reformed religion at 22 years of age. In 1563, he attached himſelf to Lewis Caſteignier de la Roch Ροzay, whom he attended in ſeveral journeys; and in 1593, was invited to accept of the place of honorary profeſſor of the univerſity of Leyden, which he complied with. He died of a dropſy in that city in 1609. He was a man of great temperance; was never married; and was ſo cloſe a ſtudent, that he often ſpent whole days in his ſtudy without eating; and though his circumſtances were always very narrow, he conſtantly refuſed the presents that were offered him. He publiſhed many works; the principal of which are,</p><p>I. Notes on Seneca’s Tragedies, on Varro, Auſonius, Pompeius Feſtus, &amp;c. 2. His Latin Poems. 3.
