<p><span class="font0">ever, its effect was instant exchange of property against a price weighed in the scales. The resulting obligation on the vendor to&nbsp;maintain the title of the vendee, and the qualifications that might&nbsp;be superinduced on the conveyance by agreement of parties—the&nbsp;so-called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">leges mancipii—</span><span class="font0">will be considered in connexion with the&nbsp;provisions of the XII. Tables on the subject </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(infra,</span><span class="font0"> p. 690).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The things included in the class of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">res mancipi</span><span class="font0"> were lands and houses held on quiritarian title, together with rights of way and&nbsp;aqueduct, slaves, and domestic beasts of draught or burden (oxen,&nbsp;horses, mules, and donkeys) ; all others were res </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">nee mancipi.</span><span class="font0"> In&nbsp;the time of Servius and during the greater part of the republic the&nbsp;domain land </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(ager publixus}</span><span class="font0"> in Italy, until it was appropriated by&nbsp;private owners, was also reckoned as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">res nee mancipi</span><span class="font0"> ; like all&nbsp;other things of the same class, it passed by simple delivery, whereas res </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">mancipi</span><span class="font0"> could not be transferred in full ownership except&nbsp;by mancipation or surrender in court. Many theories have been&nbsp;propounded to account for the distinction between these two classes&nbsp;of things, and to explain the principle of selection that admitted&nbsp;oxen and horses into the one, but relegated sheep and swine, ships&nbsp;and vehicles, to the other. But there is really little difficulty.&nbsp;Under the arrangement of Servius what was to determine the&nbsp;nature and extent of a citizen’s political qualifications, military&nbsp;duties, and financial burdens was the value of his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">heredium</span><span class="font0"> (and&nbsp;other freeholds, if he had any), and what may be called its appurtenances—the slaves that worked for the household, the slaves and&nbsp;beasts of draught and burden that worked the farm, and the servitudes of way and water that ran with the latter. It may be that&nbsp;in course of time slaves without exception were dealt with as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">res&nbsp;mancipi,—</span><span class="font0">without consideration, that is to say, whether they were&nbsp;employed on their owner’s house or farm or on any part of the&nbsp;public lands in his occupancy—and reasonably, because they were&nbsp;often shifted from the one to the other. But the cattle a man&nbsp;depastured on the public meadows were no more </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">res mancipi</span><span class="font0"> than&nbsp;his sheep. To say that the things classed as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">res mantipi</span><span class="font0"> were&nbsp;selected for that distinction by Servius because they were what&nbsp;were essential to a family engaged in agricultural pursuits would&nbsp;be to fall short of the truth. They </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">constituted</span><span class="font0"> the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">familia</span><span class="font0"> in the&nbsp;sense of the family estate proper ; whereas the herds and flocks,&nbsp;and in time everything else belonging to the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias,</span><span class="font0"> fell&nbsp;under the denomination of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">peeunia.</span><span class="font0"> So the words are to be understood in the well-known phraseology of a testament, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">familia&nbsp;ρeeuniaque mea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The public solemnity of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">mancipatio</span><span class="font1"> thus sanctioned as a mode of transferring a quiritarian right of property,&nbsp;for which </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">manus</span><span class="font1"> was probably as yet the only technical&nbsp;descriptive word in use, was not long of being adapted to&nbsp;other transactions in which </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">mαηus</span><span class="font1"> of a different sort was&nbsp;to be acquired,—for example, coemption, emancipation,&nbsp;adoption of a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">filiusfamilias,</span><span class="font1"> the contract of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">nexum,</span><span class="font1"> release&nbsp;of a nexal debtor, and that </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">mortis causa</span><span class="font1"> alienation of his&nbsp;estate by a plebeian which in time developed into the testament </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">per aes et libram.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It has been already explained (p. 674) that, prior to the time of Servius, the matrimonial unions of the plebeians were not, in the&nbsp;estimation of the patricians at least, regarded as lawful marriages&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(justae nuptiae),</span><span class="font0"> although amongst themselves they may have been&nbsp;held effectual and productive, if not of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">manus,</span><span class="font0"> at all events of&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">patria potestas.</span><span class="font0"> For this there were two reasons: (1) not being&nbsp;citizens, they did not possess the preliminary qualification for&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">justαx nτιρtiae,</span><span class="font0"> namely, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">conubium</span><span class="font0"> ; and (2) not being patricians,&nbsp;the only ceremony of marriage known to the law was incompetent&nbsp;to them. The first obstacle was removed by their admission by&nbsp;Servius to the ordinary rights of citizenship, the second by the introduction of the civil ceremony of coemption. Once the efficacy&nbsp;of mancipation as a mode of acquiring </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">manus</span><span class="font0"> over things was&nbsp;established, its adoption by the plebeians, now citizens enjoying&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">conubium,</span><span class="font0"> as a method of acquiring </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">manus</span><span class="font0"> over their wives was&nbsp;extremely natural. The scales, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">libripens,</span><span class="font0"> and the five witnesses were all there ; but, as there was no real price to be paid,&nbsp;the only copper that was needed was a single </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">raudusculum.</span><span class="font0"> The&nbsp;words recited in the ceremonial, unfortunately not preserved, were&nbsp;necessarily different from those in an ordinary mancipation, and,&nbsp;according to the testimony of a considerable number of ancient&nbsp;writers, and as the word </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">eo-emptio</span><span class="font0"> itself seems to indicate (though&nbsp;this is disputed by most modern civilians), the nominal purchase&nbsp;was mutual ; the man acquired a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">materfamilias</span><span class="font0"> who was to bear&nbsp;him children and enable him to perpetuate his family, while she acquired a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias</span><span class="font0"> who was to maintain her while the marriage&nbsp;lasted, and in whose succession she was to share when a widow.&nbsp;It was accompanied with other observances described by many of</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">the lay writers, but these were matters of usage and fashion rather than of law, and it might be, and often was, accompanied also&nbsp;with religious rites, which, however, were private, not public as in&nbsp;confarreation. It is common, but not quite accurate, to speak of&nbsp;coemption as a form of marriage. It was strictly the acquisition&nbsp;of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">mawus</span><span class="font0"> by the husband over nis wife, and probably in most cases&nbsp;contemporaneous with the marriage ; but they were really distinct,&nbsp;the latter being completed simply by interchanged consent. That&nbsp;this was so latterly at least is evident from two facts,—(1) that,&nbsp;according to Gaius, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">coemρtio</span><span class="font0"> might follow the marriage at any&nbsp;distance of time ; and (2) that, according to the same authority,&nbsp;though the marriage was dissolved by divorce, the nιαr∏is still&nbsp;remained until put an end to by remancipation (on which the&nbsp;divorced wife was entitled to insist).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It has also been explained that the plebeians were in a very much worse position than the patricians in regard to their power of&nbsp;disposing of their estates in contemplation of death. Their elevation to the rank of citizens did not apparently give them admission&nbsp;to the comitia of the curies ; and, as it was many years after the&nbsp;assassination of Servius before the comitia of the centuries was convened, they had still no means of making testaments unless perhaps&nbsp;in the field on the eve of battle. So here again the expedient of&nbsp;mancipation was taken advantage of, not indeed to make a testament instituting an heir, and to take effect only on the death of&nbsp;the testator,—the form of the transaction, as an instant acquisition&nbsp;in exchange for a price real or nominal, could not lend itself to&nbsp;that without statutory intervention—but to carry the transferrer’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">familia</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>1</sup></span><span class="font0"> to a friend, technically </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">familiae emptor,</span><span class="font0"> on trust to let&nbsp;the former have the use of it while he survived,@@<sup>2</sup> and on his death&nbsp;to distribute according to his instructions whatever the transferee&nbsp;λvas not authorized to retain for himself. Like so many others of&nbsp;the transactions of the early law, it was legally unprotected so far&nbsp;as the third parties were concerned whom the transferrer meant to&nbsp;benefit ; they had no action against the trustee to enforce the trust ;&nbsp;their sole guarantee was in his integrity and his respect for Fides.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Dionysius credits Servius with the authorship of more than fifty enactments relative to contracts and crimes, which he says were submitted to and approved by the assembly of the curies. The great&nbsp;majority of those so-called enactments were probably nothing more&nbsp;than formularizations of customary law, for the use of the private&nbsp;judges in civil causes whom the king is said to have instituted.&nbsp;There was one contract, however, notorious in after years under the&nbsp;name of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">nexmm,</span><span class="font0"> that manifestly was influenced, either directly or&nbsp;indirectly, by his legislation. In its normal estate it was a loan of&nbsp;money, or rather of the raw copper that as yet was all that stood&nbsp;for it. Whether before the time of Servius it was accompanied by&nbsp;any formalities beyond the weighing of it in a pair of scales (which&nbsp;was rather substance than form) we know<sup>,</sup> not ; and what right it&nbsp;conferred on the creditor over his debtor who failed to repay can&nbsp;only be matter of speculation. But there are indications that, in&nbsp;the exercise of undefined self-help, defaulters w<sup>τ</sup>ere treated with considerable severity, being taken in satisfaction and put in chains by&nbsp;their creditors ; for Servius is reported to have promised to pay&nbsp;their debts himself in order to obtain their release, and to pass&nbsp;a law limiting execution by persons lending money at interest to&nbsp;the goods of their debtors. Whether he fulfilled the first part of&nbsp;his promise we are not informed ; but the second part of it was&nbsp;impracticable, since a debtor’s failure to repay a loan was in most&nbsp;cases attributable to his insolvency and want of means with which&nbsp;to satisfy his creditor. So, apparently, Servius had to be content&nbsp;with regulating and ensuring the publicity of the contract, and&nbsp;making a creditor’s right of self-redress by apprehension </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(manus&nbsp;injeetio)</span><span class="font0"> and confinement of his debtor conditional on the observance of the prescribed formalities of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">neχum.</span><span class="font0"> These were the&nbsp;weighing of the copper that was being advanced in a pair of scales&nbsp;held by an official </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">libripens</span><span class="font0"> ; the reweighing of a single piece in&nbsp;the presence of five citizen witnesses, and its delivery by the lender&nbsp;as representing the wdιole ; and the simultaneous recital of certain&nbsp;words of style, which had the effect of imposing on the borrower&nbsp;an obligation to repay the loan, usually with interest, by a certain&nbsp;day. The consequence of this, the earliest independent contract&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">fies civile,</span><span class="font0"> is explained in p. 693.</span></p>
