<p><span class="font0">tues. The great qualities of liis trind were accompanied with all the advantages of perſon. His body was majeſtic and vigorous ; he was at that middle time of&nbsp;life which is happily tempered with the warmth of youth&nbsp;and the caution of age, being 42 years old. To theſe&nbsp;qualities were added, a modeſty that ſeemed peculiar to&nbsp;himſelf alone ; ſo that mankind found a pleaſure in&nbsp;praiſing thoſe accompliſhments of which the pofleiΓor&nbsp;ſeemed no way conſcious. Upon the whole, Trajan is&nbsp;diſtinguiſhed as the greateſt and the beſt emperor of&nbsp;Rome. Others might have equalled him in war, and&nbsp;ſome might have been his rivals in clemency and goodneſs ; but he ſeems the only prince who. united theſe&nbsp;talents in the greateſt perfection, and who appears equally to engage our admiration and our regard. Upon being informed of the death of Nerva, he prepared to&nbsp;return to Rome, whither he was invited by the united&nbsp;intreaties of the ſtate. He therefore began his march&nbsp;with a diſcipline that was for a long time unknown in&nbsp;the armies of the empire. The countries through&nbsp;which he paſſed were neither ravaged nor taxed, and&nbsp;he entered the city, not in a triumphant manner, though&nbsp;he had deſerved it often, but on foot, attended by the&nbsp;civil officers of the ſtate, and followed by his ſoldiers, who&nbsp;marched ſilently forward with modeſty and reſpect. It&nbsp;•would be tedious and unneceſſary to enter into a detail of&nbsp;this good monarch’s labours for the ſtate. Hisapplication&nbsp;to buſineſs, his moderation to his enemies, his modeſty in&nbsp;exaltation, his liberality to the deſerving,and hisfrugality&nbsp;in his own expences ; theſe have all been the ſubject of&nbsp;panegyric among his contemporaries, and they continue&nbsp;to be the admiration of poſterity. Upon giving the&nbsp;prefect of the pretorian band the ſword, according to&nbsp;cuſtom, he made uſe of this remarkable expreſſion,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Take this ſword, and uſe it, if I have merit, for me ; if otherwiſe, againſt me.” After which he added,&nbsp;That he who gave laws was the firſt who was bound to&nbsp;obſerve them. His failings were his love of women,&nbsp;which, however, never hurried him beyond the bounds&nbsp;of decency ; and his immoderate paſſion for war, to&nbsp;which he had been bred up from his childhood. The&nbsp;firſt war he was engaged in after his coming to the&nbsp;throne was with the Dacians, who, during the reign of&nbsp;Domitian, had committed numberleſs ravages upon rhe&nbsp;provinces of the empire. He therefore raiſed a powerful army, and with great expedition marched into thoſe&nbsp;barbarous countries, where he was vigorouſly oppoſed&nbsp;by Decebalus, the Dacian king, who ſor a long time&nbsp;withſtood his boldeſt efforts ; but was at laſt entirely&nbsp;reduced, and his kingdom made a Roman province,&nbsp;See Dacia. At his return to Rome, he entered the&nbsp;city in triumph ; and the rejoicings for his victories laſted&nbsp;for the ſpace of 120 days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Having thus given peace and proſperity to the empire, Trajan continued his reign, loved, honoured, and almoſt adored, by his ſubjects. He adorned the city&nbsp;with public buildings ; he freed it from ſuch men as&nbsp;lived by their vices ; he entertained perſons of merit&nbsp;with the utmoſt familiarity ; and ſo little feared his&nbsp;enemies, that he could ſearcely be induced to ſuppoſe&nbsp;that he had any.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It had been happy for this great prince’s memory', if he had ſhown equal clemency to all his ſubjects; but,&nbsp;about the ninth year of his reign, he was perfuadcd to</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">look upon the Chriſtians with a </span><span class="font1">ſuſpictous eye. The </span><span class="font0">extreme veneration which he profeſſed for the religion&nbsp;of the empire, ſet him ſedulouſly to oppoſe every innovation, and the progreſs of Chriſtianity ſeemed to alarm&nbsp;him. A law had for ſome time before beed paſſed, in&nbsp;which all Heteriæ, or ſocieties diſſenting from the eſtabliſhed religion, were conſidered as illegal, being reputed nurſeries of impoſture and ſedition. Under the&nbsp;fonction of this law, the Chriſtians were perſecuted in&nbsp;all parts of the empire. Great numbers of them were&nbsp;put to death, as well by popular tumults as by edicts&nbsp;and judicial proceedings. However, the perſecution&nbsp;ceaſed after ſome time ; for the emperor having advice&nbsp;from Pliny, the pro-conſul in Bithynia, of the innocence&nbsp;and ſimplicity of the Chriſtians, and of their inoffenlive&nbsp;and moral way of living, he ſuſpended their puniſhments.&nbsp;But a total ſtop was put to them upon Tiberianus the&nbsp;governor of Paleſtine’s ſending him word, That he was&nbsp;wearied out with executing the laws againſt the. Galileans, who crouded to execution in ſuch multitudes;&nbsp;that he was at a loſs how to proceed. Upon this iιu&nbsp;formation, the emperor gave orders, that the Chriſtians&nbsp;ſhould not be ſought after ; but if any offered themſelves, that they ſhould ſuffer. In this manner the rage&nbsp;of perſecution ceaſed, and the emperor found leiſure to.,&nbsp;turn the force of his arms againſt the Armenians and&nbsp;Parthians, who now began to throw off all ſubmiſſion&nbsp;to Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">While he was employed in theſe wars, there was a dreadful inſurrection of the Jews in all parts of the empire. This wretched people, ſtill infatuated, and ever&nbsp;expecting ſome ſignal deliverer, took the advantage of&nbsp;Trajan’s abſence in the eaſt to maſſacre all the Greeks&nbsp;and Romans whom they got into their power, without&nbsp;reluctance or mercy. This rebellion firſt began in Cy-rene, a Roman province in Africa ; from thence the&nbsp;flame extended to Egypt, and next to the iſland of Cyprus. Theſe places they in a manner diſpeopled with&nbsp;ungovernable fury. Their barbarities were ſuch, that&nbsp;they eat the fleſh of their enemies, wore their ſkins,&nbsp;fowed them aſunder, caſt them to wild beaſts, made them&nbsp;kill each other, and ſtudied new torments by which to&nbsp;deſtroy them. However, theſe cruelties were of no&nbsp;long duration: the governors of the reſpective provinces&nbsp;making head againſt their tumultuous fury, ſoon treated them with a retaliation of cruelty, and put them to&nbsp;death, not as human beings, but as outrageous peſt3&nbsp;to ſociety. As the Jews had practiſed their cruelties&nbsp;in Cyprus particularly, a law was publicly enacted, by&nbsp;which it was made capital for any Jew to ſet foot on&nbsp;the iſland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">During theſe bloody tranſactions, Trajan was proſecuting his ſucceſſes in the eaſt. His firſt march was into Armenia, the king of which country had diſclaimed&nbsp;all alliance with Rome, and received the enſigns of royalty and dominion from the monarch of Parthia. How»&nbsp;ever, upon the news of Trajan’s expedition, his fears&nbsp;were ſo great, that he abandoned his country to the&nbsp;invaders ; while the greateſt part of his governors and&nbsp;nobility came ſubmiſſively to the emperor, acknowledging themſelves his ſubjects, and making him the&nbsp;moſt coſtly preſents. Having in this manner taken&nbsp;poſſeſſion of the whole country, and gotten the king&nbsp;into his power, he marched into the dominions of the</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
