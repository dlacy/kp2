                    gun, with or without the help of dogs.</p>
                <p>Under this article we ſhall lay down all the rules which are neceſſary to be
                    obſerved in order to render one accompliſhed and ſucceſsful in the art of
                    ſhooting.</p>
                <p>The firſt thing which the ſportſman ought to attend to is the choice of his
                    fowling-piece. Conveniency requires that the barrel be as light as poſſible, at
                    the same time it ought to posseſs that degree of ſtrength which will make it not
                    liable to burst. Experience has proved, that a thin and light barrel, which is
                    of equal thickneſs in every part oſ its circumference, is much less liable to
                    burst than one which is conſiderably thicker and heavier, but which, from being
                    badly filed or bored, is of unequal ſtrength in different places.</p>
                <p>It is alſo of importance to determine of what length the barrel ought to be, in
                    order to acquire that range which the ſportſman has occasion for. On this
                    ſubject we have received the following information from an experienced
                    ſportſman. We have, at different times, compared barrels of all the intermediate
                    lengths between 28 and 40 inches, and of nearly the same caliber, that is to
                    ſay, from 22 to 26 ; and theſe trials were<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0445.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0439"/> made both by firing the pieces from the
                    ſhoulder, and from a firm block, at an equal diſtance, and with equal weights of
                    the ſame powder and of the ſame ſhot.</p>
                <p>To avoid every poſſibility of error, the quires of paper at which we fired were
                    fixed againſt planks instead of being placed againſt the wall. From theſe trials
                    frequently repeated, we found that the ſhot pierced an equal number of ſheets,
                    whether it was fired from a barrel of 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, or 40, inches in
                    length. Nay more, we have compared two barrels of the ſame caliber, but one of
                    them 33, and the other 66 inches long, by repeatedly firing them in the ſame
                    manner as the others, at different diſtances, from 45 to 100 paces, and the
                    reſults have always been the ſame, <hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi> the barrel of 33
                    inches drove its ſhot through as many ſheets of paper as that of 66 did. The
                    concluſion from all this is, that the difference of 10 inches in the length of
                    the barrel, which ſeems to be more than is ever inſiſted upon among ſportſmen,
                    produces no ſensible difference in the range of the piece ; and therefore, that
                    every one may pleaſe himſelf in the length of his barrel, without either
                    detriment or advantage to the range.</p>
                <p>It may appear as an objection to this, that a duck- gun which is five or six feet
                    long kills at a greater diſtance than a fowling-piece ; but this is not owing to
                    its length, but to its greater weight and thickneſs, which give it ſuch
                    additional ſtrength, that the ſhot may be increaſed, and the charge of powder
                    doubled, trebled, and even quadrupled. But a barrel of five or six feet length
                    would be very inconvenient for fowling. Thoſe who conſult the appearance of the
                    piece, lightneſs, and the eaſe with which it is managed, will find that a barrel
                    from 32 to 38 inches will anſwer beſt.</p>
                <p>The next thing to be conſidered is, of what dimenſions the caliber or bore of a
                    fowling-piece ought to be. This matter has been ſubjected to experiment, and it
                    has been found, that a barrel of 22 or 24, which is the largeſt caliber uſually
                    employed in fowling-pieces, throws its ſhot as cloſely as one of the ſmalleſt
                    caliber, viz. of 30 or 32<note anchored="true" n="1" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p><hi rend="smallcaps">(a)</hi> In ſpeaking of the ſize of
                            the caliber, we mean by 22 or 24, that ſo many balls exactly fitting it
                            weigh juſt one pound ; and every caliber is marked in the ſame
                        way.</p></note>
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">(a).</hi></p>
                <p>As to the length and form of the ſtock, it may be laid down as a principle, that
                    a long ſtock is preferable to a ſhort one, and at the ſame time rather more bent
                    than uſual ; for a long ſtock fits firmer to the ſhoulder than a ſhort one, and
                    particularly ſo when the ſhooter is accuſtomed to place his left hand, which
                    principally ſupports the piece, near to the entrance of the ramrod into the
                    ſtock.</p>
                <p>It is certain, however, that the ſtock may be ſo formed as to be better ſuited to
                    one man than another. For a tall, long-armed man, the ſtock of a gun ſhould be
                    longer than for one of a leſs ſtature and ſhorter arm. That a ſtraight ſtock is
                    proper for him who has high ſhoulders and a ſhort neck ; for, if it be much
                    bent, it would be very difficult for him, eſpecially in the quick motion
                    required in ſhooting at a flying or running object, to place the butt of the
                    gun-ſtock firmly to the ſhoulder, the upper part alone would in general be fixed
                    ; which would not only raiſe the muzzle, and conſequently ſhoot high, but make
                    the recoil much more ſenſibly felt, than if the whole end of the ſtock were</p>
                <p>firmly placed on his ſhoulder. Beſides, ſuppoſing the ſhooter to bring the butt
                    home to his ſhoulder, he would ſcarcely be able to level his piece at the
                    object. On the contrary, a man with low ſhoulders, and a long neck, requires a
                    ſtock much beat ; for if it is ſtraight, he will, in the act of lowering his
                    head to that place of the ſtock at which his cheek ſhould rest in taking aim,
                    feel a conſtraint which he never experiences, when by the effect of the proper
                    degree of bent, the ſtock lends him ſome aſſiſtance, and, as it were, meets his
                    aim half way.</p>
                <p>Having now deſcribed the fowling-piece which has been found to anſwer beſt, it
                    will next be proper to give ſome inſtructions for the choice of gunpowder, ſhot,
                    and wadding.</p>
                <p>The various kinds of gunpowder are well known ; but, in the opinion of ſome
                    experienced ſportſmen, Hervey’s battle-powder is the beſt. Thoſe who wiſh to
                    examine the ſtrength of powder, may determine it by drying ſome of it very well,
                    and then trying how many ſheets of paper it will drive the ſhot through, at the
                    diſtance of 10 or 12 yards. In this trial we ſhould be careful to employ the
                    same ſized ſhot in each experiment, the quantity both of the ſhot and the powder
                    being regulated by exact weight ; otherwiſe we cannot, even in this experiment,
                    arrive to any certainty in comparing the ſtrength of different powders, or of
                    the ſame powder at different times.</p>
                <p>Powder ought to be kept very dry, for every degree of moiſture injures it ; and
                    if considerable, the ſaltpetre is dissolved, and the intimate combination of the
                    ſeveral ingredients is entirely deſtroyed. It is obſerved, that after firing
                    with damp powder the piece becomes very foul, which ſeems to ariſe from the
                    diminution of the activity of the fire in the exploſion. Flasks of copper or tin
                    are much better for keeping powder in than thoſe made of leather, or than ſmall
                    caſks. Their necks ought to be ſmall and well ſtopped with cork.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">patent milled ſhot</hi> is now very generally uſed, and is
                    reckoned ſuperior to any other. The ſize of the ſhot muſt vary according to the
                    particuliar ſpecies of game which is the object of the ſportſman’s purſuit, as
                    well as be adapted to the ſeaſon. In the firſt month of partridge ſhooting, <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">N⁰ 1.</hi> is most proper; for since at this time the birds
                    ſpring near at hand, and we ſeldom fire at more than the diſtance of 40 paces,
                    if the ſhooter takes his aim but tolerably well, it is almoſt impoſſible for a
                    bird at this diſtance to eſcape in the circle which the ſhot forms.</p>
                <p>As hares fit cloſer, and are thinly covered with fur at this ſeaſon, they may
                    eaſily be killed with this ſhot at 30 or 35 paces. N <hi rend="superscript">
                        o</hi> 1. is equally proper for ſhooting ſnipes or quails. About the
                    beginning of October, when the partridges are ſtronger, <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >N⁰</hi> 3. is the moſt proper ſhot to be uſed. Many ſportſmen uſe no other
                    during the whole ſeaſon. The directions which have now been given refer only to
                    the patent ſhot.</p>
                <p>We ſhall now ſubjoin a table, which will show at one view the number of pellets
                    compoſing an ounce weight of each sort of ſhot, the patent and the common,
                    beginning with the ſmalleſt ſize.</<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0446.tif"

                    </table><p>For a fowling-piece of a common caliber, which is from 24 to 30 balls
                        to the pound weight, a dram and a quarter, or at moſt a dram and a half, of
                        good powder ; and an ounce, or an ounce and a quarter of ſhot, is
                        ſufficient. But when ſhot of a larger ſize is uſed, ſuch as N⁰ 5. the charge
                        of ſhot may be increaſed one- fourth, for the purpoſe of counterbalancing in
                        ſome degree what the ſize of the ſhot loses in the number of pellets, and
                        alſo to enable it to garniſh the more. For this purpoſe the ſportſman will
                        find a meaſure marked with the proper gauges very convenient to him. An
                        inſtrument of this nature has been made by an ingenious artiſt of London,
                        Egg, of the Haymarket.</p><p>A conſequence of overloading with ſhot, is the
                        powder has not ſufficient ſtrength to throw it to its proper diſtance ; for
                        if the object fired at be diſtant, one-half of the pellets compoſing the
                        charge, by their too great quantity and weight, will ſtrike againſt each
                        other, and fall by the way ; and thoſe which reach the mark will have ſmall
                        force, and will produce but little or no effect.</p><p>The uſe of the <hi
                            rend="italic">wadding</hi> is to carry the ſhot in a body to a certain
                        diſtance from the muzzle of the piece. It ought to be of ſoft and pliable
                        materials. The beſt kind of wadding, in the opinion of an experienced
                        fowler, is a piece of an old hat ; but this cannot be obtained in ſufficient
                        quantity. Next to it nothing is better than ſoft brown paper, which combines
                        ſuppleneſs with conſiſtence, moulds itſelf to the barrel, and never falls to
                        the ground within 12 or 15 paces from the muzzle of the piece. Tow anſwers
                        very well, and cork has been extolled for poſſeſſing the peculiar virtue of
                        increaſing the range and cloſeneſs of the ſhot.</p><p>The wadding ought to
                        be quite cloſe in the barrel, but not rammed too hard ; for if it be rammed
                        too cloſe, or be of a rigid ſubſtance, the piece will recoil, and the ſhot
                        will ſpread too much. On the other hand, if the wadding be very looſe, or is
                        compoſed of too ſoft materials, ſuch as wool or cotton, the diſcharge will
                        not poſſeſs proper force.</p><p>In loading a piece, the powder ought to be
                        ſlightly rammed down by only preſſing the ramrod two or three times on the
                        wadding, and not by drawing up the ramrod and then returning it into the
                        barrel with a jerk of</p><p>the arm ſeveral times. For when the powder is
                        violently compreſſed, ſome of the grains muſt be bruiſed, which will prevent
                        the exploſion from being quick, and will ſpread the ſhot too wide. In pourin
                        the powder into the barrel, the meaſure ought to be held ſo as that the
                        powder may fall moſt readily to the bottom. That no grains may adhere to the
                        ſides of the barrel, the butt-end of the piece may be ſtruck against the
                        ground. The ſhot ought never to be rammed down with force : it is ſufficient
                        to ſtrike the butt-end of the gun againſt the ground as before. Then the
                        wadding is to be put down gently. A ſportſman ought never to carry his gun
                        under his arm with the muzzle inclined downwards, for this practice looſens
                        the wadding and charge too much.</p><p>Immediately after the piece is fired
                        it ought to be reloaded ; for while the barrel is ſtill warm, there is no
                        danger of any moiſture lodging in it to hinder the powder from falling to
                        the bottom. As it is found that the coldneſs of the barrel, and perhaps the
                        moiſture condenſed in it, diminishes the force of the powder in the firſt
                        ſhot ; it is proper to fire off a little powder before the piece is loaded.
                        Some prime before loading, but this is not proper unleſs the touch-hole be
                        very large. After every diſcharge the touch-hole ought to be pricked, or a
                        ſmall feather may be inſerted to clear away any humidity or foulneſs that
                        has been contracted.</p><p>The ſportſman having loaded his piece, muſt next
                        prepare to fire. For this purpoſe he ought to place his hand near the
                        entrance of the ramrod, and at the ſame time graſp the barrel firmly. The
                        muzzle ſhould be a little elevated, for it is more uſual to ſhoot low than
                        high. This direction ought particularly to be attended to when the object is
                        a little diſtant ; becauſe ſhot as well as ball only moves a certain
                        diſtance point blank, when it begins to deſcribe the curve of the
                        parabola.</p><p>Practice ſoon teaches the ſportſman the proper distance at
                        which he ſhould ſhoot. The diſtance at which he ought infallibly to kill any
                        kind of game with patent ſhot, N <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi> 3. provided
                        the aim be well taken, is from 25 to 35 paces for the footed, and from 40 to
                        45 paces for the winged, game. Beyond this diſtance even to 50 or 55 paces,
                        both partridges and hares are ſometimes killed ; but in general the hares
                        are only ſlightly wounded, and carry away the ſhot ; and the partridges at
                        that diſtance preſent ſo ſmall a ſurface, that they frequently eſcape
                        untouched between the ſpaces of the circle. Yet it does not follow that a
                        partridge may not be killed with N⁰ 3 patent ſhot at 60 and even 70 paces
                        diſtance, but then theſe ſhots are very rare.</p><p>In ſhooting at a bird
                        flying, or a hare running acroſs, it is neceſſary to take aim before the
                        object in proportion to its diſtance at the time of firing. If a partridge
                        flies acroſs at the diſtance of 30 or 35 paces, it will be ſufficient to aim
                        at the head, or at moſt but a ſmall ſpace before it. If it be 50, 60, or 70
                        paces distant, it is then requiſite to aim at leaſt half a foot before the
                        head. The ſame practice ought to be obſerved in ſhooting at a hare, rabbit,
                        or fox, when running in a croſs direction ; at the ſame time making due
                            allowance<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0447.tif"
                            xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0441"/> for the diſtance and ſwiftneſs of the pace.
                        Another thing to be attended to is, that the ſhooter ought not involuntarily
                        to ſtop the motion of the arms at the moment of pulling the trigger ; for
                        the inſtant the hand stops in order to fire, however inconſiderable the time
                        be, the bird gets beyond the line of aim, and the ſhot will miss it. A
                        ſportſman ought therefore to accustom his hand while he is taking aim to
                        follow the object. When a hare runs in a straight line from the ſhooter, he
                        ſhould take his aim between the ears, otherwiſe he will run the hazard
                        either of missing, or at leaſt not of killing dead, or as it is ſometimes
                        called <hi rend="italic">clean.</hi></p><p>A fowling-piece ſhould not be
                        fired more than 20 or 25 times without being waſhed ; a barrel when foul
                        neither ſhoots ſo ready, nor carries the ſhot ſo far as when clean. The
                        flint, pan, and hammer, ſhould be well wiped after each ſhot ; this
                        contributes greatly to make the piece go off quick, but then it ſhould be
                        done with ſuch expedition, that the barrel may be reloaded whilſt warm, for
                        the reaſons we have before advanced. The flint ſhould be frequently changed,
                        without waiting until it miſſes fire, before a new one is put in. Fifteen or
                        eighteen ſhots, therefore, ſhould only be fired with the same flint ; the
                        expence is too trifling to be regarded, and by changing it thus often much
                        vexation will be prevented.</p><p>A gun alſo ſhould never be fired with the
                        prime of the preceding day ; it may happen that an old priming will
                        ſometimes go off well, but it will more frequently contract moiſture and
                        fuze in the firing ; then the object will moſt probably be missed, and that
                        becauſe the piece was not freſh primed.</p><p>For the information of the
                        young ſportſman we ſhall add a few more general directions. In warm weather
                        he ought to ſeek for game in plains and open grounds, and in cold weather he
                        may ſearch little hills expoſed to the ſun, along hedges among heath, in
                        stubbles, and in paſtures where there is much furze and fern. The morning is
                        the beſt time of the day, before the dew is exhaled, and before the game has
                        been disturbed. The colour of the ſhooters dreſs ought to be the same with
                        that of the fields and trees ; in summer it ought to be green, in winter a
                        dark grey. He ought to hunt as much as poſſible with the wind, not only to
                        prevent the game from perceiving the approach of him and his dog, but alſo
                        to enable the dog to ſcent the game at a greater diſtance.</p><p>He ſhould
                        never be diſcouraged from hunting and ranging the same ground over and over
                        again, eſpecially in places covered with heath, brambles, high graſs, or
                        yoiιng coppide wood. A hare or rabbit will frequently ſuffer him to paſs
                        ſeveral times within a few yards of its form without getting up. He ſhould
                        be still more patient when he has marked partridges into ſuch places, for it
                        often happens, that after the birds have been ſprung many times, they lie ſo
                        dead that they will ſuffer him almoſt to tread upon them before they will
                        rise. Pheaſants, quails, and woodcocks do the ſame.</p><p>He ought to look
                        carefully about him, never paſſing a buſh or tuft of graſs without
                        examination ; but he ought never to strike them with the muzzle of his gun
                        for it will looſen his wadding. He who patiently beats and ranges his ground
                        over again, without being diſ</p><p>courages, will always kill the greateſt
                        quantity of game ; and if he is ſhooting in company, he will find game where
                        others have passed without diſcovering any.</p><p>When he has fired he
                        ſhould call in his dog, that he may not have the mortification to ſee game
                        rise which he cannot ſhoot. When he has killed a bird, inſtead of being
                        anxious about picking it up, he ought to follow the rest of the covey with
                        his eye till he ſee them settle.</p><p>Three ſpecies of dogs are capable of
                        receiving the proper inſtruction, and of being trained. Theſe are the ſmooth
                        pointer, the ſpaniel, and the rough pointer. The laſt is a dog with long
                        curled hair, and ſeems to be a mixed breed of the water-dog and the ſpaniel.
                        The ſmooth pointer is active and lively enough in his range, but in general
                        is proper only for an open country.</p><p>The greateſt part of theſe dogs
                        are afraid of water, brambles, and thickets ; but the ſpaniel and the rough
                        pointer are eaſily taught to take the water, even in cold weather, and to
                        range the woods and rough places as well as the plain. Greater dependence
                        may therefore be had on theſe two laſt ſpecies of dogs than on the ſmooth
                        pointer.</p><p>The education of a pointer may commence when he is only five
                        or six months old. The only leſſons which he can be taught at this time are
                        to <hi rend="italic">fetch</hi> and <hi rend="italic">carry</hi> any thing
                        when deſired ; to come in when he runs far off, and to go behind when he
                        returns ; uſing, in the one caſe, the words <hi rend="italic">here, come
                            in,</hi> and in the other <hi rend="italic">back</hi> or <hi
                            rend="italic">behind.</hi> It is alſo neceſſary at this period to
                        accuſtom him to be tied up in the kennel or stable ; but he ought not at
                        first to be tied too long. He ſhould be let looſe in the morning, and
                        faſtened again in the evening. When a dog is not early accuſtomed to be
                        chained, he diſturbs every perſon in the neighbourhood by howling. It is
                        alſo of importance that the perſon who is to train him ſhould give him his
                        food.</p><p>When the dog has attained the age of 10 or 12 months, he may be
                        carried into the field to be regularly trained. At firſt he may be allowed
                        to follow his own inclination, and to run after every animal he fees. His
                        indiſcriminating eagerneſs will ſoon abate, and he will purſue only
                        partridges and hares. He will ſoon become tired of following partridges in
                        vain, and will content himſelf after having fluſhed them to follow them with
                        his eyes. It will be more difficult to prevent him from following
                        hares.</p><p>All young dogs are apt to <hi rend="italic">rake ;</hi> that
                        is, to hunt with their noſes cloſe to the ground, to follow birds rather by
                        the track than by the wind. But partridges lie much better to dogs that <hi
                            rend="italic">wind</hi> them, than to thoſe that follow them by the
                        track. The dog that winds the ſcent approaches the birds by degrees and
                        without diſturbing them ; but they are immediately alarmed when they ſee a
                        dog tracing their footſteps. When you perceive that your dog is committing
                        this fault, call to him in an angry tone <hi rend="italic">hold up:</hi> he
                        will then grow uneaſy and agitated, going firſt to the one side and then to
                        the other, until the wind brings him the ſcent of the birds. After finding
                        the <hi rend="italic">game</hi> four or five times in this way, he will take
                        the wind of himſelf, and hunt with his noſe high. If it be difficult to
                        correct this fault, it will be neceſſary to put the <hi rend="italic">puzzle
                            peg</hi> upon him. This is of very ſimple conſtruction, conſisting<pb

                        his noſe, is then faſtened with a piece of leather thong to his under jaw.
                        By this means the peg advancing ſeven or eight inches beyond his ſnout, the
                        dog is prevented front putting his noſe to the ground and raking.</p><p>As
                        ſoon as the young dog knows his game you muſt bring him under complete
                        ſubjection. If he is tractable, this will be eaſy; but if he is ſtubborn, it
                        will be neceſsary to uſe the <hi rend="italic">trash cord,</hi> which is a
                        rope or cord of 20 or 25 fathoms in length faſtened to his collar. If he
                        refuſe to come back when called upon, you muſt check him ſmartly with the
                        cord, which will often bring him upon his haunches. But be sure you never
                        call to him except when you are within reach of the cord. After repeating
                        this ſeveral times he will not fail to come back when called ; he ought then
                        to be careſſed, and a bit of bread ſhould be given him. He ought now
                        conſtantly to be tied up, and never unchained, except when you give him his
                        food, and even then only when he has done ſomething to deserve it.</p><p>The
                        next ſtep will be to throw down a piece of bread on the ground, at the ſame
                        moment taking hold of the dog by the collar, calling out to him, “ take
                        heed,—ſoftly.” After having held him in this manner for ſome space of time,
                        ſay to him, “ ſeize—lay hold.” If he is impatient to lay hold of the piece
                        of bread before the ſignal is given, correct him gently with a ſmall whip.
                        Repeat this leſſon until he “ takes heed” well, and no longer requires to be
                        held fast to prevent him from laying hold of the bread. When he is well
                        accuſtomed to this manège, turn the bread with a ſtick, holding it in the
                        manner you do a fowling-piece, and having done ſo, cry seize <hi
                            rend="italic">.</hi> Never ſuffer the dog to eat either in the houſe or
                        field without having first made him take heed in this manner.</p><p>Then, in
                        order to apply this leſſon to the game, fry ſmall pieces of bread in hogs
                        lard, with the dung of partridge ; take theſe in a linen bag into the
                        fields, Hubbles, ploughed grounds, and paſtures, and there put the pieces in
                        ſeveral different places, marking the ſpots with little cleft pickets of
                        wood, which will be rendered more diſtinguiſhable by putting pieces of card
                        in the nicks. This being done, caſt off the dog and conduct him to theſe
                        places, always hunting in the wind. After he has caught the ſcent of the
                        bread, if he approaches too near, and ſeems eager to fall upon it, cry to
                        him in a menacing tone, “ take heed ,” and if he does not ſtop immediately,
                        correct him with the whip. He will ſoon comprehend what is required of him,
                        and will ſtand.</p><p>At the next leſſon, take your gun charged only with
                        powder, walk gently round the piece of bread once or twice, and fire inſtead
                        of crying seize. The next time of practiſing this leſſon, walk round the
                        bread four or five times, but in a greater circle than before, and continue
                        to do this, until the dog is conquered of his impatience, and will ſtand
                        without moving until the ſignal is given him. When he keeps his point well,
                        and ſtands ſteady in this leſſon, you may carry him to the birds ; if he
                        runs in upon them, or barks when they ſpring up, you muſt cor</p><p>rect him
                        ; and if he continues to do ſo, you muſt return to the fried bread ; but
                        this is ſeldom neceſſary.</p><p>When the dog has learned by this uſe of the
                        bread to take heed, he may be carried to the fields with the traſh-cord
                        dragging on the ground. When he ſprings birds for the firſt time, if he runs
                        after them or barks, check him by calling out to him, <hi rend="italic">take
                            heed.</hi> If he point properly, careſs him ; but you ought never to
                        hunt without the cord until he point staunch.</p><p>If the dog runs after
                        ſheep, and it be difficult to cure him, couple him with a ram, and their
                        whip the dog as long as you can follow him. His cries will at firſt alarm
                        the ram ; he will run with all his ſpeed, and drag the dog along with him ;
                        but he will at length take courage, turn upon the dog, and butt him ſeverely
                        with his horns. When you think the dog is ſuſſiciently chastiſed, untie him
                        : he will never run at ſheep again.</p><p>Having now given a lew general
                        inſtructions concerning the beſt method of training pointers, we ſhall
                        ſubjoin a few obſervations reſpecting the moſt common ſpecies of game, the
                        partridge, pheaſant, grouſe, woodcock, ſnipe, and wild
                        duck.</p><p>Partridges pair in the ſpring, and lay their eggs (generally
                        from 15 to 20) during May and part of June. The young begin to fly about the
                        end of June, and their plumage is complete in the beginning of October. The
                        male has a conspicuous horſeſhoe upon his breaſt, an obtuſe ſpur on the
                        hinder part of the leg, which diſtinguiſhes him from the female. He is also
                        rather larger.</p><p>When a ſportſman is ſhooting in a country where the
                        birds are thin, and he no longer chooſes to range the field for the bare
                        chance of meeting with them, the following method will ſhow him where to
                        find them on another day. In the evening, from ſun-ſet to nightfall, he
                        ſhould poſt himſelf in a field, at the foot of a tree or a buſh, and there
                        wait until the partridge begin to call or juck, which they always do at that
                        time ; not only for the purpoſe of drawing together when ſeparated, but alſo
                        when the birds compoſing the covey are not diſperſed. After calling in this
                        manner for ſome little ſpace of time, the partridges will take to flight ;
                        then, if he mark the place where they alight. he may be aſſured they will
                        lie there the whole night, unleſs diſturbed. Let him return to the ſame poſt
                        tire next morning by break of day, and there watch a while; being careful to
                        keep his dog in a firing, it he is not under perfect command.</p><p>As soon
                        as the dawn begins to peep, the partridges will begin to call, and ſoon
                        afterwards will perform the ſame manœuvre as on the preceding evening ; that
                        is, after having called a while, they will take their flight, and will moſt
                        commonly ſettle at a little diſtance. There in a few minutes they will call
                        again, and ſometimes take a ſecond flight, but that will be to no great
                        diſtance. Then as ſoon as the ſun is riſen, and the ſportſman can ſee to
                        ſhoot, he may caſt off his dog and purſue them.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic"
                            >pheaſant</hi> is of the ſize of a common dunghill cock, and lays its
                        eggs generally in the woods, the number of which is 10 or
                        12.</p><p>Pheaſants are accounted ſtupid birds ; for when they are ſurpriſed
                        they will frequently ſquat down like a rabbit, ſuppoſing themſelves to be in
                        ſafety as ſoon as their<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0449.tif"
                            xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0443"/> heads are concealed ; and in this way they
                        will ſometimes ſuffer themſelves to be killed with a ſtick. They love low
                        and moiſt places, and haunt the edges of thoſe pools which are found in
                        woods, as well as the high grass of marſhes that are near at hand ; and
                        above all, places where there are clumps of alders.</p><p><hi rend="italic"
                            >Grouſe,</hi> or muir-game, are found in Wales, in the northern counties
                        of England, and in great abundance in Scotland. They chiefly inhabit thoſe
                        mountains and muirs which are covered with heath, and ſeldom deſcend to the
                        low grounds. They fly in companies of four or five braces, and love to
                        frequent moſſy places, particularly in the middle of the day or when the
                        weather is warm. In purſuing this game, when the pointer ſets, and the
                        ſportſman perceives the birds running with their heads erect, he muſt run
                        after them as fall as he can, in the hope that he may get near enough to
                        ſhoot when they rise upon the wing ; for he may be pretty certain they will
                        not lie well that day. As theſe birds are apt to grow ſoon putrid, they
                        ought to be drawn carefully the inſtant they are ſhot and stuffed with any
                        heath, and if the feathers happen to be wetted they muſt be wiped
                        dry.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">woodcock</hi> is a bird of paſſage ; it
                        commonly arrives about the end of October, and remains until the middle of
                        March. Woodcocks are fatteſt in December and January, but from the end of
                        February they are lean. At their arrival they drop anywhere, but afterwards
                        take up their residence in copſes of nine or ten years growth. They ſeldom,
                        however, ſtay in one place longer than 12 or 15 days. During the day they
                        remain in thoſe parts of the woods where there are void ſpaces or glades,
                        picking up earth-worms and grubs from the fallen leaves. In the evening they
                        go to drink and waſh their bills at pools and ſprings, after which they
                        repair to the open fields and meadows for the night. It is remarkable, that
                        when a woodcock ſprings from a wood to go into the open country, he always
                        endeavours to find ſome glade or opening, which he follows to the boundaries
                        of the wood. At his return he purſues the ſame path a good way, and then
                        turns to the right or left oppoſite to ſome glade, in order to drop into a
                        thick part of the wood, where he may be ſheltered from the wind. He may
                        therefore be watched with advantage in theſe narrow passes and little alleys
                        on the edges of woods which lead to a pool or ſpring, or he may be watched
                        in the dusk of the evening near the pools which he frequents.</p><p>The snip
                            <hi rend="italic">e</hi> is a bird of paſſage as well as the woodcock.
                        This bird is ſcarcely worth ſhooting till the froſt commences. In the month
                        of November they begin to grow fat. Snipes, like woodcocks, frequent
                        ſprings, bogs, and marſhy places, and generally fly against the wind. The
                        ſlant and croſs ſhots are rather difficult, as the birds are ſmall and fly
                        very quickly. The ſportſman ought to look for them in the direction of the
                        wind ; becauſe then they will fly towards him, and preſent a fairer
                        mark.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">wild duck</hi> is alſo a bird of paſſage,
                        and arrives " here in great flocks from the northern countries in the
                        beginning of winter. Still, however, a great many remain in our marſhes and
                        fens during the whole year,</p><p>and breed.</p><p>The wild duck differs
                        little in plumage from the tame duck, but is eaſily diſtinguiſhed by its
                        ſize, which is leſs ; by the neck, which is more ſlender ; by the
                        foot,</p><p>which is ſmaller ; by the nails, which are more black ; and
                        above all, by the web of the foot, which is much finer and ſofter to the
                        touch.</p><p>In tire ſummer ſeaſon, when it is known that a team of young
                        ducks are in a particular piece of water, and juſt beginning to fly, the
                        ſportſman is ſure to find them early in the morning dabbling at the edges of
                        the pool, and amongſt the long graſs, and then he may get very near to them
                        : it is uſual alſo to find them in thoſe places at noon.</p><p>In the
                        beginning of autumn almoſt every pool is frequented by teams of wild ducks,
                        which remain there during the day, concealed in the ruſhes. If theſe pools
                        are of ſmall extent, two ſhooters, by going one on each ſide, making a noiſe
                        and throwing ſtones into the ruſhes, will make them fly up ; and they will
                        in this way frequently get ſhots, eſpecially if the pool is not broad, and
                        contracts at one end. But the ſureſt and most ſucceſsful way, is to launch a
                        ſmall boat or trow on the pool, and to traverſe the ruſhes by the openings
                        which are found ; at the same time making as little noiſe as poſſible. In
                        this manner the ducks will ſuffer the ſportſmen to come ſufficiently near
                        them to ſhoot flying ; and it often happens that the ducks, after having
                        flown up, only make a circuit, return in a little time, and again alight
                        upon the pool. Then the ſportſmen endeavour a second time to come near them.
                        If ſeveral ſhooters are in company, they ſhould divide, two ſhould go in the
                        boat, whilſt the others ſpread themſelves about the edge of the pool, in
                        order to ſhoot the ducks in their flight. In pools which will not admit a
                        trow, water-ſpaniels are abſolutely neceſſary for this ſport.</p><p>In
                        winter they may be found on the margins of little pools ; and when pools and
                        rivers are frozen up, they muſt be watched for in places where there are
                        ſprings and waters which do not freeze. The ſport is then much more certain,
                        becauſe the ducks are confined to theſe places in order to procure aquatic
                        herbs, which are almoſt their only food at this period.</p><p><hi
