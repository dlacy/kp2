But in the mean time Afranius, who commanded the left wing of the Roman army, had entirely defeated the wing which Sertorius had left, and even purſued them ſo cloſe that he entered the camp, along with them. Sertorius, returning ſuddenly, found the Romans buſy in plundering the tents; when, taking advantage of their ſituation, he drove them out with great ſlaughter, and retook his camp. Next day he offered battle a ſecond time to Pompey ; but Metellus then coming up with all his forces, he thought proper to decline an engagement with both commanders. In a few days, however, Pompey and Metellus agreed to attack the camp of Sertorius. Metellus attacked Perperna, and Pompey fell upon Sertorius. The event was ſimilar to that of the former battle ; Metellus defeated Perperna, and Sertorius routed Pompey. Being then informed of Perperna’s misfortune, he haſtened to his relief ; rallied the fugitives, and repulſed Metellus in his turn, wounded him with his lance, and would certainly have killed him, had not the. Romans, aſhamed to leave their general in diſtreſs, hastened to his aſſiſtance, and renewed the fight with great fury. At laſt Sertorius was obliged to quit the field, and retire to the mountains. Pompey and Metellus haſtened to beſiege him ; but while they were forming their camp, Sertorius broke through their lines, and eſcaped into Lulitania. Here he ſoon raiſed ſuch a powerful army, that the Roman generals, with their united forces, did not think proper to venture an engagement with him. They could not, however, refill the perpetual attacks of Sertorius, who now drove them from place to place, till he obliged them to ſeparate, the one went into Gaul, and the other to the foot of the Pyrenees.</p><p>Thus did this celebrated commander triumph over all the power of the Romans ; and there is little doubt but he would have continued to make head againſt all the other generals whom the republic could have ſent ; had he not been aſſaſſinated at an entertainment by the infamous treachery of Perperna, in 73 B. C. after he had made head againſt the Roman forces ſor alrnoſt ten years. Pompey was no ſooner informed of his death, than, without waiting for any new ſuccours, he marched againſt the traitor, whom he eaſily defeated and took prisoner ; and having cauſed him to be executed, thus put an end, with very little glory, to a moſt dangerous war.</p><p>Many of the Spaniſh nations, however, ſtill continued to bear the Roman yoke with great impatience ; and as the civil wars which took place firſt between Julius Cæsar and Pompey, and afterwards between Octavianus and Antony, diverted the attention of the republic from Spain, by the time that Auguſtus had become ſole maſter oſ the Roman empire, they were again in a condition to aſſert their liberty. The <hi rend="smallcaps">Cantabrians </hi>and <hi rend="smallcaps">Asturians</hi> were the moſt powerful and valiant nations at that time in Spain; but, after incredible efforts, they were obliged to lay down their arms, or rather were alrnoſt exterminated, by Agrippa, as is related under theſe articles. From this time the Spaniards continued in quiet ſubjection to the Romans ; but on the decline of the empire they were attacked by the northern nations, who put an end to the Roman name in the weft. As the inhabitants had by that time entirely loſt their ancient valour, the barbarians met with no reſiſtance but from one another. In the reign of the em</p><p>peror Honorius, the Vandals, Alans, and Suevians, entered this country ; and having made themſelves matters of it, divided the provinces among themſelves. In 444 the Romans made one effort more to recover their power in this part of the world ; but being utterly defeated by the Suevians, the latter eſtabliſhed a kingdom there which laſted till the year 584, when it was utterly overthrown by the Viſigoths under Leovigilde. The Gothic princes continued to reign over a conſiderable part of Spain till the beginning of the 8th century, when their empire was entirely overthrown by the Saracens. During this period, they had entirely expelled the eaſtern emperors from what they poſſeſſed in Spain, and even made conſiderable conqueſts in Barbary; but towards the end of the 7th century the Saracens overran all that part of the world with a rapidity which nothing could resist ; and having ſoon poſſeſſed themſelves of the Gothic dominions in Barbary, they made a deſcent upon Spain about the year 711 or 712. The king of the Goths at that time was called <hi rend="italic">Roderic,</hi> and by his bad conduct had occaſioned great diſaffection among his ſubjects. He therefore determined to put all to the iſſue of a battle, knowing that he could not depend upon the fidelity of his own people if he allowed the enemy time to tamper with them. The two armies met in a plain near Xeres in Andaluſia. The Goths began the attack with great fury ; but though they fought like men in deſpair, they were at laſt defeated with exceſſive ſlaughter, and their king himself was ſuppoſed to have perished in the battle, being never more heard of.</p><p>By this battle the Moors in a ſhort time rendered themſelves maſters of almoſt all Spain. The poor remains of the Goths were obliged to retire into the mountainous parts of Aſturias, Burgos, and Biſeay: the inhabitants of Arragon, Catalonia, and Navarre, though they might have made a considerable ſtand againſt the enemy, choſe for the moſt part to retire into France. In 718, however, the power of the Goths began again to revive under Don Pelagio or Pelayo, a prince of the royal blood, who headed thoſe that had retired to the mountains after the fatal battle of Xeres. The place where he firſt laid the foundation of his government was in the Aſturias, in the province of Uebana, about nine leagues in length and four in breadth. This is the moſt inland part of the country, full of mountains enormouſly high, and ſo much fortified by nature, that its inhabitants are capable of reſiſting almoſt any number of invaders. Alakor the Saracen governor was no ſooner informed of this revival of the Gothiſh kingdom, than he ſent a powerful army, under the command of one Alchaman, to cruſh Don Pelagio before he had time to eſtabliſh his power. The king, though his forces were ſufficiently numerous (every one of his ſubjects arrived at man’s eſtate being a ſoldier), did not think proper to venture a general engagement in the open field ; but taking post with part of them himſelf in a cavern in a very high mountain, he concealed the reſt among precipices, giving orders to them to fall upon the enemy as ſoon as they ſhould perceive him attacked by them. Theſe orders were punctually executed, though indeed Don Pelagio himſelf had repulſed his enemies, but not without a miracle, as the Spaniſh hiſtorians pretend. The ſlaughter was dreadful ; for the troops who lay in ambuſcade joining the</p></body></text></TEI>
