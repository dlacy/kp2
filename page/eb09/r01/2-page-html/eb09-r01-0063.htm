<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">burg and Moscow. This was built by the state, but afterwards sold to a private company. After the close of the Crimean War&nbsp;railway construction was more rapid. The lines were laid down&nbsp;by the Government surveyors, but were constructed and managed&nbsp;by private companies, receiving, however, much help from the&nbsp;Government. Of the 15,000 miles in operation hardly a tenth&nbsp;part belongs to the state, even including the 700 miles of state&nbsp;railway in Finland. Yet about half the capital employed in railway construction has been furnished by the state. Since 1880 the&nbsp;construction of railways in European Russia has moved slowly.&nbsp;Of greater importance has been the development of the Asiatic lines.&nbsp;The first of these, in the Caucasus, was opened in 1872 to a length&nbsp;of nearly 200 miles. The Trans-Caspian military railway was begun&nbsp;in 1880 ; the connexion between the Caspian and the Black Sea&nbsp;was completed in 1883. The Siberian railway is being pushed&nbsp;forward as rapidly as the finances of the empire will allow. The&nbsp;administration is in most respects modelled upon that adopted by&nbsp;Germany and Austria. The plan of the Russian railways has been&nbsp;dictated by military rather than industrial considerations. The&nbsp;gauge is 5 feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Isolated lines were constructed in Turkey in 1860 and 1866. The first general plan for a system of importance dates from 1869,&nbsp;and was modified in 1872. Foreign companies furnished the capital&nbsp;and received a subsidy from the Government. In return they&nbsp;were to make certain annual payments ; but the clauses providing&nbsp;for this were so carelessly drawn that the companies seem to have&nbsp;had an interest in delaying the completion of the work. Some of&nbsp;the lines were lost in the cession of territory which followed the&nbsp;war of 1878. There are now open for traffic about 1000 miles of&nbsp;railway in European Turkey, and 200 more in Asia Minor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">There is a fairly developed system of railways (1000 miles or more) in Roumania, owned by the state ; and there are a few lines in Servia.&nbsp;Arrangements seem to be completed by which through communication in these countries will soon be established on a large scale,&nbsp;if the authorities in Turkey and Bulgaria do not fail in their duty.&nbsp;The Government of Greece is also engaged in extending its railway&nbsp;system, which has hitherto amounted to nothing. </span><span class="font1">(A. T. II.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">America</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">.—In the Dominion of Canada 9113 miles of railway and 6735 of tramway, together 15,848, were open in the end of&nbsp;1883. The accounts show that the total outlay for construction&nbsp;amounted to about 73 millions sterling, being at the rate of £4610&nbsp;per mile. The gross earnings for the year 1883 amounted to upwards of 6 millions sterling, of which 723־ per cent, was absorbed as&nbsp;working expenses, leaving £1,693,000 net earnings, which amounted&nbsp;to only 23־ per cent, on the capital cost. The earlier railways were&nbsp;laid to gauges of 5£ and 3£ feet, but the inconveniences of break of&nbsp;gauge with the railways of the United States led to the relaying of&nbsp;all the lines to the standard gauge, except those of Newfoundland&nbsp;and Prince Edward’s Island, which remain on the 3.) feet gauge.&nbsp;The principal system is the Grand Trunk Railway, comprising the&nbsp;original Grand Trunk and the Great Western, which were consolidated in 1882, making a total length of 2358 miles of line. The&nbsp;first section of the system—Portland to Montreal—was opened in&nbsp;1853, the first line opened in Canada. In June 1884 of the (estimated) 2899 miles of the Canadian Pacific Railway, connecting the&nbsp;Pacific with the Atlantic, 2105 miles were open and in operation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">In Mexico the first railway constructed and opened was the Mexican Railway, between Mexico city and Vera Cruz, 264 miles, with a branch 29 miles, the first section from Vera Cruz to Paso del&nbsp;Macho being opened in 1865. This railway, with one or more&nbsp;others in Mexico, was constructed to the 4 feet 8^ inch gauge, but&nbsp;others, including the Mexican National Railway, 910 miles long,&nbsp;are laid to the 3 feet gauge. The Mexican Central Railroad, 1224&nbsp;miles long, was completed in 1884.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The Panama Railroad, Colombia, between Aspinwall and Panama, 47£ miles in length, was opened in January 1855. The rails are laid&nbsp;to a gauge of 5 feet. Railways were in progress in 1883-84 in several&nbsp;of the other states of Colombia, all of them to a gauge of 3 feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">In Guatemala the first line of railway from San José to Esquintla, 13 miles in length, laid to a gauge of 3 feet, was opened in June&nbsp;1880. A line from Champerico to Ritalhulca, 30 miles long, was&nbsp;opened in December 1883 ; and another from San José to the capital, 69 miles long, is now finished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">In the empire of Brazil the Manâ Railway was the first line opened, early in the decade 1850-60. It is a short line of single&nbsp;way, 11 miles long, between the head of the bay of Rio de Janeiro&nbsp;anti the foot of the serra. It was laid to a gauge of 5£ feet ; but&nbsp;other lines in Brazil are laid to a gauge of 5 feet 3 inches. The&nbsp;empire possessed in January 1884 railways of a total length of 3500&nbsp;miles open for traffic, besides 1500 miles in course of construction.&nbsp;The state owns nine lines, having 1300 miles open, the principal&nbsp;of which is the Dom Pedro II., intended to connect the eastern&nbsp;and western provinces of the empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Chili was one of the first states in South America to initiate the construction of railways. The Copiapo Railway, laid to the 4 feet&nbsp;8| inch gauge, was opened about 1850 ; and an Act was passed in&nbsp;1852 authorizing the construction of a line to connect Santiago&nbsp;with Valparaiso, 114 miles distant. In 1855 the first 8 miles were&nbsp;opened for traffic, and in 1863 the line was opened throughout. It&nbsp;was constructed to a gauge of 5| feet. In 1883 the total length&nbsp;of lines open for traffic was 1378 miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">In Peru a system of railways has been in course of construction 1 since 1852, chiefly at the expense of the state. In 1878 there were&nbsp;open for traffic, or in course of construction, twenty-two lines&nbsp;belonging to the state and to private individuals, 2030 miles in&nbsp;length, representing a cost of about 36 millions sterling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Africa</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">.—The railways of Lower Egypt have been laid out pri-1 marily to connect Alexandria, Cairo, and Suez, with branches to&nbsp;Mansurali and elsewhere in the Delta. The line first laid out,&nbsp;between Alexandria and Cairo, 130 miles long, was opened in&nbsp;January 1856. The junction line from Bennah to Suez is 101f miles&nbsp;in length ; the total length of railways open for traffic in Egypt&nbsp;at the end of 1883 was 941 miles, laid to the 4 feet 84 inch gauge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">There are three systems of railway at the Cape of Good Hope,— &lt; the Western from Cape Town, the Midland from Port Elizabeth,<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>and the Eastern from East London. In January 1884 there were&nbsp;1213 miles open for traffic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">In the colony of Natal there were at the end of 1883 105 miles of railway open, and 120 were then in course of construction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">In the Island of Mauritius there are two lines of railway laid to the 4 feet 8¿ inch gauge, with two branches, of a total length of&nbsp;94 miles. The North line, starting from Port Louis, is 31 miles&nbsp;long, and was opened in 1864 ; the Midland line, passing through&nbsp;the centre of the island, is 35 miles long, and was opened in 1865.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Asia</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">.—In 1845 the East Indian and the Great Indian Peninsula Railway Companies were formed. Four years later the Government&nbsp;entered into arrangements with these two companies for the construction of railways in the presidencies of Bengal and Bombay,&nbsp;guaranteeing for ninety-nine years a dividend of from to 5 per&nbsp;cent, upon the estimated cost of these and succeeding railways.&nbsp;They adopted one uniform gauge of 5 feet 6 inches. Down to 1869&nbsp;this policy of guarantee and uniform gauge was adhered to. But&nbsp;in 1869, under the rule of Lord Lawrence, the Government altered&nbsp;the standard gauge for new lines to one metre, or 3 feet 3§ inches,&nbsp;and used the lightest rails and rolling-stock compatible with the&nbsp;requirements of Indian traffic. There are now five different railway&nbsp;gauges in India, namely, the 5J feet, the 3 feet 3§ inch, the 4 feet,&nbsp;the 2£ feet, and the 2 feet. The first piece of railway opened in&nbsp;India was a section of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, 20§&nbsp;miles long, from Bombay to Tannah, in 1853. At the end of&nbsp;March 1884 there were 1288 miles of that railway open for traffic.&nbsp;The East Indian Railway was opened for a length of 38 miles in&nbsp;1854 ; there are now 1509 miles open. In 1869 this railway was&nbsp;transferred to Government, though it is still worked by the company. Of the Madras Railway 65 miles were opened in 1856 ; there&nbsp;are now 861 open. The first of the imperial state railways was&nbsp;opened (114 miles) in 1873. At the end of March 1884 the number&nbsp;of miles of line open for traffic was as follows (Table XXXIII.):—</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The number of passengers carried increased from 24,280,459 in 1874 to 65,098,953 in 1883.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">In Ceylon the railways have been constructed by the Govern-ment. The main line, from Colombo to Kandy, 74.1 miles long, was opened for traffic in 1867 ; and the branch to Navalapitiya,&nbsp;17 miles long, was opened in 1874. The Kalutara Railway, 27|&nbsp;miles long, was finally opened in 1879. There were 164 miles open&nbsp;at the end of 1884, and 16 in course of construction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The only railway ever laid in China ran along a strip of land, about 9 miles long, between Shanghai and Woosung, opened in&nbsp;1876. In October 1877 the line was removed and the traffic came&nbsp;to an end in consequence of official jealousy, although the railway&nbsp;was very popular with the natives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The first railway that was opened in Japan was the Tokio-Yoko-liama line, 18 miles in length, commenced in 1869 and opened for traffic in 1872, laid to a gauge of 3£ feet. At June 1884 there&nbsp;were open for traffic 236 miles of railway.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The railways of New South Wales are divided into three systems, all of which take their departure from Sydney, the capital,—the&nbsp;northern, the western, and the southern system. The first piece of&nbsp;line, 15 miles in length, was opened in 1855 ; and at the end of&nbsp;1883 there were 1320 miles open for traffic, and 597 in course of</span></p>
