<p><span class="font0">to Hemingford), “when he heard of the king’s coming, fled from his face and burnt the castle of Ayr which he&nbsp;held.” Yet, when Edward was forced by home affairs to&nbsp;quit Scotland, Annandale and certain earldoms, including&nbsp;Carrick, were excepted from the districts he assigned to&nbsp;his followers,—Bruce and the other earls being treated as&nbsp;waverers whose allegiance might still be retained. In&nbsp;1299 a regency was appointed in Scotland in name of&nbsp;Baliol, and a letter of Baliol mentions Robert Bruce, lord&nbsp;of Carrick, as regent, along with William of Lamberton,&nbsp;bishop of St Andrews, and John Cornyn the younger,—&nbsp;a strange combination, Lamberton the friend of Wallace,&nbsp;Cornyn the enemy of Bruce, and Bruce a regent in name&nbsp;of Baliol. Cornyn in his own interest as Baliol’s heir was&nbsp;the active regent ; the insertion of the name of Bruce was&nbsp;an attempt to secure his co-operation. For the next four&nbsp;years he kept studiously in the background waiting his&nbsp;time. A statement of Langtoft that he was at the parliament of Lincoln in 1301, when the English barons repudiated the claim of the pope to the suzerainty of Scotland,&nbsp;is not to be credited, though his father may have been&nbsp;there. In the campaign of 1304, when Edward renewed&nbsp;his attempt on Scotland and reduced Stirling, Bruce supported the English king, who in one of his letters to him&nbsp;says, “ If you complete that which you have begun we&nbsp;shall hold the war ended by your deed and all the land of&nbsp;Scotland gained.” But, while apparently aiding Edward,&nbsp;Bruce had taken a step which bound him to the patriotic&nbsp;cause. On llth June, a month before the fall of Stirling,&nbsp;he met Lamberton at Cambuskenneth and entered into a&nbsp;secret bond by which they were to support each other&nbsp;against all adversaries and undertake nothing without&nbsp;consulting together. The death of his father in this year&nbsp;may have determined his course and led him to prefer the&nbsp;chance of the Scottish crown to his English estates and&nbsp;the friendship of Edward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This determination closes the first chapter of his life ; the second, from 1304 to 1314, is occupied by his contest&nbsp;for the kingdom, which was really won at Bannockburn,&nbsp;though disputed till the treaty of Northampton in 1328 ;&nbsp;the last, from 1314 to his death in 1329, was the period of&nbsp;the establishment of his government and dynasty by an&nbsp;administration as skilful as his generalship. It is to the&nbsp;second of these that historians, attracted by its brilliancy&nbsp;even amongst the many romances of history and its&nbsp;importance to Scottish history, have directed most of their&nbsp;attention, and it is during it that his personal character,&nbsp;tried by adversity and prosperity, gradually unfolds itself.&nbsp;But all three periods require to be kept in view to form a&nbsp;just estimate of Bruce. That which terminated in 1304,&nbsp;though unfortunately few characteristics, personal or individual, have been preserved, shows him by his conduct to&nbsp;have been the normal Scottish noble of the time. A conflict of interest and of bias led to contradictory action,&nbsp;and this conflict was increased in his case by his father’s&nbsp;residence in England, his own upbringing at the English&nbsp;court, his family feud with Baliol and the Cornyns, and&nbsp;the jealousy common to his class of Wallace, the mere&nbsp;knight, who had rallied the commons against the invader&nbsp;and taught the nobles what was required in a leader of&nbsp;the people. The merit of Bruce is that he did not despise&nbsp;the lesson. Prompted alike by patriotism and ambition,&nbsp;at the prime of manhood he chose the cause of national&nbsp;independence with all its perils, and stood by it with a&nbsp;constancy which never wavered until he secured its triumph.&nbsp;Though it is crowded with incidents, the main facts in the&nbsp;central decade of Bruce’s life may be rapidly told. The&nbsp;fall of Stirling was followed by the capture and execution&nbsp;of Wallace at London on 24th August 1305. Edward&nbsp;hoped still to conciliate the nobles and gain Scotland by a&nbsp;policy of clemency to all who did not dispute his authority.&nbsp;A parliament in London ( 16th September), to which&nbsp;Scottish representatives were summoned, agreed to an&nbsp;ordinance for the government of Scotland, which, though&nbsp;on the model of those for Wales and Ireland, treating&nbsp;Scotland as a third subject province under an English&nbsp;lieutenant, John de Bretagne, was in other respects not&nbsp;severe. Bruce is reputed to have been one of the advisers&nbsp;who assisted in framing it ; but a provision that his castle&nbsp;of Kildrummy was to be placed in charge of a person for&nbsp;whom he should answer shows that Edward not without&nbsp;reason suspected his fidelity. Challenged by the king&nbsp;with the bond between him and Lamberton (according to&nbsp;one account discovered by the treachery of John Cornyn,&nbsp;with whom a similar engagement had been made or&nbsp;attempted), Bruce secretly quitted London, and on 10th&nbsp;February 1306 met by appointment, in the church of the&nbsp;Friars Minor at Dumfries, Cornyn, whom he slew at the&nbsp;high altar for refusing to join in his plans. So much is&nbsp;certain, though the precise incidents of the interview were&nbsp;variously told. It was not their first encounter, for a letter&nbsp;of 1299 to Edward from Scotland describes Cornyn as&nbsp;having seized Bruce by the throat at a meeting at Peebles,&nbsp;when they were with difficulty reconciled by the joint&nbsp;regency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The bond with Lamberton was now sealed by blood and the confederates lost no time in putting it into execution.&nbsp;Within little more than six weeks Bruce, collecting his&nbsp;adherents in the south-west, passed from Lochmaben to&nbsp;Glasgow and thence to Scone, where he was crowned by&nbsp;the bishop of St Andrews on 25th March, the bishops&nbsp;of Glasgow and Moray, with the earls of Lennox, Athole,&nbsp;and Errol, being present. Two days later Isabella, countess&nbsp;of Buchan, claimed the right of her family the Macduff’s,&nbsp;earls of Fife, to place the Scottish king on his throne, and&nbsp;the ceremony was repeated with an addition flattering to&nbsp;the Celtic race. Though a king, Bruce had not yet a kingdom, and his efforts to obtain it were till the death of&nbsp;Edward I. disastrous failures. In June he was defeated&nbsp;at Methven by Pembroke, and on llth August he was surprised in Strathfillan, where he had taken refuge, by Lord&nbsp;Lorn. The ladies of his family were sent to Kildrummy&nbsp;in January, and Bruce, almost without a follower, fled to&nbsp;Rathlin, an island off Antrim (Ireland). Edward, though&nbsp;suffering from his last illness, came to the north in the&nbsp;following spring. On his way he granted the Scottish&nbsp;estates of Bruce and his adherents to his own followers,&nbsp;Annandale falling to the earl of Hereford. At Carlisle&nbsp;there was published a bull excommunicating Bruce, along&nbsp;with another absolving Edward from the oath he had&nbsp;taken to observe Magna Charta and the other charters on&nbsp;which the English constitution rests. Elizabeth the wife,&nbsp;Marjory the daughter, Christina the sister of Bruce, were&nbsp;captured in a sanctuary at Tain and sent prisoners to&nbsp;England. The countess of Buchan was confined in a cage&nbsp;at Berwick and another of Bruce’s sisters, Mary, in a cage&nbsp;at Roxburgh. The bishops of St Andrews and Glasgow&nbsp;and the abbot of Scone were suspended from their benefices and sent as prisoners to the south of England. Nigel&nbsp;Bruce, his youngest brother, was beheaded at Berwick,&nbsp;Christopher Seton, his brother-in-law, at Dumfries. The&nbsp;earl of Atlιole was sent to London and hanged on a gallows&nbsp;30 feet higher than the pole on which the head of Wallace&nbsp;still stood. Two other brothers of Bruce, Thomas and&nbsp;Alexander (dean of Glasgow), met the same fate at Carlisle.&nbsp;There were many minor victims, but the chronicler of&nbsp;Lanercost notes that the number of those who wished&nbsp;Bruce to be confirmed in the kingdom increased daily.&nbsp;While thus wreaking his vengeance Edward himself was&nbsp;summoned by death at Burgh-on-the-Sands, on the Solway,</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
