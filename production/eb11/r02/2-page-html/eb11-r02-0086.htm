<p><span class="font1">produces spores and is diploid. Hence all such plants are to this extent </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">polymorphic—</span><span class="font1">that is, the plant assumes these two forms&nbsp;in the course of its life-history. When, as in many Thallophyta,&nbsp;one or other of these forms can reproduce itself by means of&nbsp;gonidia, additional forms may be introduced into the life-history, which becomes the more complicated the more pronounced the polymorphism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The most straightforward life-histories are those presented by the Bryophyta and the Pteridophyta, where there are but the&nbsp;two forms, the sexual and the asexual. In the life-history of a&nbsp;moss, the plant itself bears only sexual organs: it is the sexual&nbsp;form, and is distinguished as the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">gametophyte.</span><span class="font1"> The zygote&nbsp;(oospore) formed in the sexual act develops into an organism,&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sporogonium,</span><span class="font1"> which is entirely asexual, producing only spores:&nbsp;it is distinguished as the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sporophyte.</span><span class="font1"> When these spores germinate, they give rise to moss-plants. Thus the two forms, the&nbsp;sexual and the asexual, regularly alternate with each other—&nbsp;that is, the life-history presents that simple form of polymorphism which is known as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">alternation of generations.</span><span class="font1"> Similarly, in the life-history of a fem, there is a regular alternation of&nbsp;a sporophyte, which is the fern-plant itself, with a gametophyte,&nbsp;which is the fem-prothallium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is pointed out in the preceding section that, as the result of the sexual act, the nucleus of the zygote contains twice&nbsp;as many chromosomes as those of the fusing sexual cells. This&nbsp;2</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">x</span><span class="font1"> number of chromosomes persists throughout all the cell-generations derived from the zygote, that is, in the cells&nbsp;constituting the sporophyte, up to the time that it begins to&nbsp;produce spores, when meiosis takes place. Again, the cell-generations derived from the spore, that is, the cells constituting&nbsp;the gametophyte, all have the reduced </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">x</span><span class="font1"> number of chromosomes&nbsp;in their nuclei up to the sexual act. Hence the sporophyte&nbsp;may also be designated the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">diplophyte</span><span class="font1"> and the gametophyte&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">haplophyte</span><span class="font1"> (Strasburgcr) : in other words, the sporophyte is the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">pre-meiotic,</span><span class="font1"> the gametophyte the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">post-meiotic&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">generation. Twice in its life-history the plant is represented&nbsp;by a single cell: by the spore and by the zygote. The turning-points in the life-history, the transitions from the one generation to the other, are (i) meiosis, (2) the sexual act.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The course of the life-history in Phanerogams and in those Thallophyta which have been adequately investigated is essentially the same as that of the Bryophyta and of the Pteridophyta&nbsp;as described above, though it is less easy to trace on account&nbsp;of the peculiar relation of the two generations to each other&nbsp;in the Phanerogams and on account of various irregularities&nbsp;that present themselves in the Thallophyta.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the Phanerogams, as in the Pteridophyta, the preponderating generation is the sporophyte, the plant itself. Inasmuch as they are heterosporous, the gametophyte is&nbsp;represented by a male and a female organism or prothallium,&nbsp;both rudimentary. The male prothallium consists of the few&nbsp;cells formed by the germinating pollen-grain (microspore); and&nbsp;though it is quite independent, since the microspores are shed,&nbsp;it grows parasitically in the tissues upon which the microspore&nbsp;has been deposited in pollination. The female pro thallium&nbsp;may consist of many ceUs with well-developed archegonia, as&nbsp;in the Gymnosperms, or of only a few cells with the female&nbsp;organ reduced to the oosphere, as in the Angiosperms. In&nbsp;either case it is the product of the germination of a megaspore&nbsp;(embryo-sac) which is not shed from its sporangium (ovule):&nbsp;hence it never becomes an independent plant, and was long&nbsp;regarded as merely a part of the sporophyte until its true nature&nbsp;was ascertained, chiefly by the researches of Hofmeister, who&nbsp;first explained the alternation of generations in plants. This'&nbsp;intimate and persistent connexion between the two generations&nbsp;affords the explanation of the characteristic features of the&nbsp;Phanerogams, the seed and the flower. The ovule containing&nbsp;the embryo-sac, which eventually contains the embryo, persists as the seed;—a structure that is distinctive of Phanerogams, which have, in fact, on this account been also termed&nbsp;Spermatophyta. With regard to the flower, it has been already&nbsp;mentioned that it is, like the cone of an Equisetum or a Lycopodium, a shoot 'adapted to the production of spores. But&nbsp;it is something more than this: for whereas in Equisetum or&nbsp;Lycopodium the function oPthe cone comes to an end when&nbsp;the spores are shed, the flower of the Phanerogam has still&nbsp;various functions to perform after the maturation of the spores.&nbsp;It is the seat of the process of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">pollination—</span><span class="font1">that is, the bringing&nbsp;of the pollen-grain by one of various agencies into such a position that a part (the pollen-tube) of the male prothaUium&nbsp;developed from it may reach and fertilize the oosphere in the&nbsp;embryo-sac. Thus the flower of Phanerogams is a reproductive&nbsp;shoot adapted not only for spore-production, but also for&nbsp;pollination, for fertilization, and for the consequences of fertilization, the production of seed and fruit. However, in spite of&nbsp;these complications, it is possible to determine accurately the&nbsp;limits of the two generations by the observation of the nuclei.&nbsp;The meiosis preceding the formation of the spores marks the&nbsp;beginning of the (haploid) gametophyte, male and female;&nbsp;and the sexual act marks that of the (diploid) sporophyte.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The difficult task of elucidating the life-histories of the Thallophyta has been successfully performed in certain cases&nbsp;by the application of the method of chromosome-counting,&nbsp;with the result that alternation of generations has been found&nbsp;to be of general occurrence. To begin with the Algae. In&nbsp;the Dictyotaceae (Brown Algae) there are two very similar&nbsp;forms in the life-history, the one bearing asexual reproductive&nbsp;organs (tetrasporangia), the other bearing sexual organs (oogonia&nbsp;and an theridia). It has been shown (Lloyd Williams) that&nbsp;the former is undoubtedly the sporophyte and the latter the&nbsp;gametophyte, since the nuclei of the former contain 32 chromosomes, and those of the latter 16. Meiosis takes place in the&nbsp;mother-cell of the tetraspores, which, on germination, give&nbsp;rise to the sexual form. Quite a different life-history has been&nbsp;traced in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Fucus,</span><span class="font1"> another Brown Alga. Here no spores are&nbsp;produced: there is but one form in the life-history, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Fucus-</span><span class="font1">plant, which bears sexual organs and has, · on that account,&nbsp;been regarded as a gametophyte. The investigation of the&nbsp;nuclei has, however, shown (Farmer) that the Fwrws-plant&nbsp;is actually diploid, that it is, in fact, a sporophyte; but since&nbsp;there is no spore-formation, meiosis immediately precedes-the development of the sexual cells, which alone represent the&nbsp;gametophyte (see below, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Apospory).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Similarly, two types of life-history have been discovered in the Red Algae. In </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Polysiphonia Violacea,</span><span class="font1"> a species in which&nbsp;the tetraspores and the sexual organs are borne by similar but&nbsp;distinct individuals, it has been ascertained (Yamanouchi)&nbsp;that, as in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dictyota,</span><span class="font1"> meiosis takes place in the mother-cell of&nbsp;the tetraspores, so that thc nuclei of these spores, as also those&nbsp;of the sexual plants to which they give rise, contain 20 chromosomes: and further, that the nuclei of the carpospores (diplospores) produced in the cystocarp as the result of fertilization^&nbsp;contain 40 chromosomes, as do also those of the asexual plant&nbsp;to which the carpospores give rise. Hence the sporophyte&nbsp;is represented by the cystocarp and the resulting tetraspor-angiate plants: the gametophyte, by the sexual plants. Though&nbsp;it is the rule in the Red Algae that the tetrasporangia and the&nbsp;sexual organs are borne on distinct individuals, yet cases are&nbsp;known in which both kinds of reproductive organs are bome&nbsp;upon the same plant; and to those the above conclusions-obviously cannot apply. They have yet to be investigated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The second type of life-history has been traced in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Nemalion. </span><span class="font1">Here there is ho tetrasporangiate form, consequently meiosis-takes place at a different stage in the life-history. It has-been observed (Wolfe) that the nuclei of the sexual plant&nbsp;contain 8 chromosomes; those of the gonimoblast-filaments&nbsp;of the developing cystocarp contain 16, whilst those of the&nbsp;carpospores contain 8: hence meiosis takes place in the carpo-sporangia. Here the plant is the gametophyte; the sporophyte&nbsp;is only represented by the cystocarp. The carpospores here are&nbsp;true spores (haplospores).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Among the Green Algae, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Coleochaete</span><span class="font1"> is the only form that has been fully investigated (Allen). Here meiosis takes place&nbsp;in the germinating oospore: consequently the plant is the</span></p>
