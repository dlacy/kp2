<p><span class="font1">he became secretary of the colonies ; but the errors in his negotiations at the Austrian capital followed him and&nbsp;forced him to retire. For some years after this he was the&nbsp;“ stormy petrel ” of politics. He was the chief instrument&nbsp;in defeating Lord Palmerston in 1857. He led the attack&nbsp;on the Tory Reform Bill of 1859. A reconciliation was&nbsp;then effected between the rival Whig leaders, and Lord&nbsp;John Russell consented to become foreign secretary in&nbsp;Lord Palmerston’s ministry, and to accept an earldom.&nbsp;During the American War Earl Russell’s sympathies with&nbsp;the North restrained his country from embarking in the&nbsp;contest, but he was not equally successful in his desire to&nbsp;prevent the spoliation of Denmark. On Lord Palmerston’s&nbsp;death (October 1865) Earl Russell was once more summoned to form a cabinet, but the defeat of his ministry&nbsp;in the following June on the Reform Bill which they had&nbsp;introduced was followed by his retirement from public&nbsp;life. His leisure hours were spent after this event in the&nbsp;preparation of numberless letters and speeches, and in the&nbsp;composition of his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Recollections and Suggestions,</span><span class="font1"> but everything he wrote was marked by the belief that all philosophy, political or social, was summed up in the Whig creed&nbsp;of fifty years previously. Earl Russell died at Pembroke&nbsp;Lodge, Richmond Park, 28th May 1878.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For more than half a century Earl Russell lived in the excitement of political life. He participated in the troubles of Whiggism before&nbsp;1832, and shared in its triumph after that event. He expounded&nbsp;the principles of the first Reform Bill and lived to see a second&nbsp;carried into law by the Conservative ministry of Lord Derby. Unlimited confidence in his own resources exposed him to many jests&nbsp;from both friend and foe, but he rightly estimated his powers, and&nbsp;they carried him to the highest places in the state. His tragedies&nbsp;and his essays are forgotten, but his works on Fox are among the&nbsp;chief authorities on Whig politics. Earl Russell was twice married,&nbsp;—first, in 1835, to Adelaide, daughter of Mr Thomas Lister, and&nbsp;widow of Thomas, second Lord Ribblesdale, and secondly, in 1841,&nbsp;to Lady Frances Ann Maria, daughter of the second earl of Minto.&nbsp;By the former he had two daughters, by the latter three sons and&nbsp;one daughter. His eldest son, Lord Amberley, predeceased him&nbsp;9th January 1876.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(W. P. C.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RUSSELL, </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">William Russell, Lord</span><span class="font1"> (1639-1683), the third son of Lord Russell, afterwards fifth earl and still&nbsp;later first duke of Bedford, and Lady Anne Carr, daughter&nbsp;of the infamous countess of Somerset, was born September&nbsp;29, 1639. Nothing is known of his early youth, except&nbsp;that about 1654 he was sent to Cambridge with his elder&nbsp;brother Francis. On leaving the university, the two&nbsp;brothers travelled abroad, visiting Lyons and Geneva, and&nbsp;residing for some while at Augsburg. His account of his&nbsp;impressions is spirited and interesting. He was at Paris&nbsp;in 1658, but had returned to Woburn in December 1659.&nbsp;At the Restoration he was elected for the family borough&nbsp;of Tavistock. For a long while he appears to have taken&nbsp;no part in public affairs, but rather to have indulged in&nbsp;the follies of court life and intrigue ; for both in 1663 and&nbsp;1664 he was engaged in duels, in the latter of which he&nbsp;was wounded. In 1669 he married the second daughter&nbsp;of the earl of Southampton, the widow of Lord Vaughan,&nbsp;thus becoming connected with Shaftesbury, who had married Southampton’s niece. With his wife Russell always&nbsp;lived on terms of the greatest affection and confidence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It was not until the formation of the “ country party,” in opposition to the policy of the Cabal and Charles’s&nbsp;French-Catholic plots, that Russell began to take an active&nbsp;part in affairs. He then joined Cavendish, Birch, Hampden, Powell, Lyttleton, and others in vehement antagonism&nbsp;to the court. With a passionate hatred and distrust of&nbsp;the Catholics, and an intense love of political liberty, he&nbsp;united the desire for ease to Protestant Dissenters. His&nbsp;first speech appears to have been on January 22, 1673, in&nbsp;which he inveighed against the stop of the exchequer, the&nbsp;attack on the Smyrna fleet, the corruption of courtiers with&nbsp;French money, and “the ill ministers aboht the king.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">He also supported the proceedings against the duke of Buckingham. In 1675 he moved an address to the king&nbsp;for the removal of Danby from the royal councils, and for&nbsp;his impeachment. On February 15, 1677, in the debate&nbsp;on the fifteen months’ prorogation, he moved the dissolution of parliament; and in March 1678 he seconded the&nbsp;address praying the king to declare war against France.&nbsp;The enmity of the country party against Danby and&nbsp;James, and their desire for a dissolution and the disbanding&nbsp;of the army, were greater than their enmity to Louis. The&nbsp;French king therefore found it easy to form a temporary&nbsp;alliance with Russell, Hollis, and the opposition leaders, by&nbsp;which they engaged to cripple the king’s power of hurting&nbsp;France, and to compel him to seek Louis’s friendship,—&nbsp;that friendship, however, to be given only on the condition&nbsp;that they in their turn should have Louis’s support for their&nbsp;cherished objects. Russell in particular entered into close&nbsp;communication with Rouvigny, who came over with money&nbsp;for distribution among members of parliament. By the testimony of Barillon, however, it is clear that Russell himself&nbsp;utterly refused to take any part in the intended corruption.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">By the wild alarms which culminated in the Popish Terror Russell appears to have been affected more completely than his otherwise sober character would have led&nbsp;people to expect. He threw himself into the party which&nbsp;looked to Monmouth as the representative of Protestant&nbsp;interests, a grave political blunder, though he afterwards&nbsp;was in confidential communication with Orange. On&nbsp;November 4, 1678, he moved an address to the king to remove the duke of York from his person and councils. At&nbsp;the dissolution of the pensionary parliament, he was, in&nbsp;the new elections, returned for Bedfordshire. Danby was at&nbsp;once overthrown, and in April 1679 Russell was one of the&nbsp;new privy council formed by Charles on the advice of&nbsp;Temple. Only six days after this we find him moving for&nbsp;a committee to draw up a bill to secure religion and property in case of a Popish successor. He does not, however, appear to have taken part in the exclusion debates at&nbsp;this time. In June, on the occasion of the Covenanters’&nbsp;rising in Scotland, he attacked Lauderdale personally in&nbsp;full council.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In January 1680 Russell, along with Cavendish, Capell, Powell, Essex, and Lyttleton, tendered his resignation to&nbsp;the king, which was received by Charles “with all my&nbsp;heart.” On June 16 he accompanied Shaftesbury, when&nbsp;the latter indicted James at Westminster as a Popish recusant ; and on October 26 he took the extreme step of&nbsp;moving “how to suppress Popery, and prevent a Popish&nbsp;successor”; while on November 2, now at the height of his&nbsp;influence, he went still further by seconding the motion&nbsp;for exclusion in its most emphatic shape, and on the 19 th&nbsp;carried the bill to the House of Lords for their concurrence.&nbsp;The limitation scheme he opposed, on the ground that&nbsp;monarchy under the conditions expressed in it would be&nbsp;an absurdity. The statement, made by Echard alone, that&nbsp;he joined in opposing the indulgence shown to Lord Strafford by Charles in dispensing with the more horrible parts&nbsp;of the sentence of death—an indulgence afterwards shown&nbsp;to Russell himself—is entirely unworthy of credence. On&nbsp;December 18 he moved to refuse supplies until the king&nbsp;passed the Exclusion Bill. The Prince of Orange having&nbsp;come over at this time, there was a tendency on the part&nbsp;of the opposition leaders to accept his endeavours to secure&nbsp;a compromise on the exclusion question. Russell, however,&nbsp;refused to give way a hair’s breadth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">On March 26, 1681, in the parliament held at Oxford, Russell again seconded the Exclusion Bill. LTpon the&nbsp;dissolution he retired into privacy at his country seat of&nbsp;Stratton in Hampshire. It was, however, no doubt at his&nbsp;wish that his chaplain wrote the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Life of Julian the Apos-</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
