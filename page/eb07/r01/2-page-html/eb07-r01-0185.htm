<body><h2><a name="caption1"></a><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">q</span><span class="font4"> = 0∙433 ; and if from this we find values of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">q</span><span class="font4"> for the cube and three-feet prism (assuming </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">q</span><span class="font4"> to vary inversely as&nbsp;log. 1∙42&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;according to what was above shown),</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">we shall have for the cube, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">q</span><span class="font1"> = 0∙172, and for the prism, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">q ~</span><span class="font1"> 0∙l02. Hence, if R denote the resistance due both to&nbsp;the pressure and non-pressure of the body when moving in&nbsp;quiescent water, the three values of R will be li∙433,1∙172,&nbsp;and l<sup>-</sup>102, which correspond to the weights 14 94 lbs., 12∙22&nbsp;lbs, and 11∙49 lbs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Hence Du Buat concludes, that the resistances in these two states are nearly in the ratio of 13 to K). This, he&nbsp;thinks, will account for the difference observed, in the experiments of different authors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Du Buat next endeavours to ascertain the quantity of water which is made to adhere in some degree to a body&nbsp;which is carried along through still water, or which remains&nbsp;.nearly stagnant in the midst of a stream. He takes the sum&nbsp;of the motions in the direction of the stream, viz. the sum&nbsp;of the actual motions of all those particles which have lost&nbsp;part of their motion, and he divides this sum by the general velocity of the stream. The quotient is equivalent to&nbsp;a certain quantity of water perfectly stagnant round the&nbsp;body. Without being able to determine this with precision,&nbsp;he observes, that it augments as the resistance diminishes ;&nbsp;for in the case of a longer body, the filaments a.re observed&nbsp;to converge to a greater distance behind the body. The&nbsp;stagnant mass a-head of the body is more constant ; for the&nbsp;deflection and resistance at the prow are observed not to&nbsp;be affected at the length of the body. By a very nice analysis of many circumstances, he comes to this conclusion,&nbsp;that the whole quantity of fluid, which in this manner accompanies the solid body, remains the same, whatever is&nbsp;the velocity. He might have deduced it at once, from the&nbsp;consideration that the curves described by the filaments are&nbsp;the same in all velocities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">He then relates a number of experiments made to ascertain the absolute quantity thus made to accompany the body. These were made by causing pendulums to oscillate in fluids. Newton had determined the resistances to&nbsp;such oscillation by the diminution of the arches of vibration. Du Buat determines the quantity of dragged fluid&nbsp;by the increase of their duration ; for the stagnation or&nbsp;dragging is in fact adding a quantity of matter to be moved,&nbsp;without any addition to the moving force. It was ingeniously observed by Newton, that the time of oscillation was&nbsp;not sensibly affected by the resistance of the fluid, a compensation almost complete being made by the diminution&nbsp;of the arches of vibration ; and experiment confirmed this.&nbsp;If, therefore, a great augmentation of the time of vibration&nbsp;be observed, it must be ascribed to the additional quantity&nbsp;Of matter which is thus dragged into motion, and it may be&nbsp;employed for its measurement. Thus, let </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font1"> be the length&nbsp;of a pendulum swinging seconds in vacuo, and Z the length&nbsp;of a seconds pendulum swinging in a fluid. Let </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">p</span><span class="font1"> be the&nbsp;weight of the body in the fluid, and P the weight of the&nbsp;body displaced by it ; P + </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">p</span><span class="font1"> will express its weight in va-</span></p><h2><span class="font4">P + p</span></h2><h2><span class="font4">cuo, and ——p— will be the ratio of these weights.

<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Let n</span><span class="font1"> express the sum of the fluid displaced, and the fluid dragged along, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">n</span><span class="font1"> being a greater number than unity,&nbsp;to be determined by experiment. The mass in motion is&nbsp;no longer P + </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">p,</span><span class="font1"> but P + </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ηp,</span><span class="font1"> while its weight in the</span></p><h2><span class="font4">fluid is still p.

<p><span class="font1">A prodigious number of experiments made by Du Buat on spheres vibrating in water gave values of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">n</span><span class="font1"> which were&nbsp;nearly constant, namely, from 1∙5 to 1∙7 ; and by considering the circumstances which accompanied the variations of&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">n</span><span class="font1"> (which he found to arise chiefly from the curvature of&nbsp;the path described by the ball), he states the mean value&nbsp;of the number </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">n</span><span class="font1"> at 1∙585. So that a sphere in motion drags&nbsp;along with it about ¾⅛ths of its own bulk of fluid with a velocity equal to its own.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Similar experiments with prisms, pyramids, and other bodies, afforded a complete confirmation of his assertion, that prisms of equal lengths and sections, though dissimilar,&nbsp;dragged equal quantities of fluid ; that similar prisms, and&nbsp;prisms not similar, but whose lengths were as the square&nbsp;root of their sections, dragged quantities proportional to&nbsp;their bulks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">He found a general value of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">n</span><span class="font1"> for prismatic bodies, which alone may be considered as a valuable result, namely,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">η =</span><span class="font1"> 0<sup>-</sup>705&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ 1∙13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">From all these circumstances, we see an intimate connection between the pressures, non-pressures, and the fluid dragged along with the body. Indeed this is immediately&nbsp;deducible from first principles ; for what Du Buat calls the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">dragged fluid</span><span class="font1"> is in fact a certain portion of the whole change&nbsp;of motion produced in the direction of the body’s motion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It was found, that with respect to thin planes, spheres, and pyramidal bodies of equal bases, the resistances were&nbsp;inversely as the quantities of fluid dragged along. @@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The reader will readily observe, that these views of the Chevalier du Buat are not so much discoveries of new&nbsp;principles as they are classifications of consequences which&nbsp;may all be deduced from the general principles employed&nbsp;by D’Alembert and other mathematicians. But they greatly&nbsp;assist us in forming notions of different parts of the procedure of nature in the mutual action of fluids and solids&nbsp;on each other. This must be very acceptable in a subject&nbsp;which it is by no means probable that we shall be able to&nbsp;investigate with mathematical precision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The only circumstance which we have not noticed in detail, is the change of resistance produced by the void, or tendency to a void, which obtains behind the body ; and we omitted a particular discussion, merely because we could say nothing sufficiently precise on the subject.

<p><span class="font3"><sup>@@@1</sup> It is a remarkable circumstance, that these very important conclusions of the Chevalier du Buat, which were first published in the second edition of his well-known work in 1786, and which twice formed the subject of the prize proposed by the Academy of Sciences&nbsp;of Paris, should have been so little attended to by succeeding experimenters, that in the numerous attempts to determine the length&nbsp;of the seconds pendulum, no one thought of applying the additional correction for the reduction to a vacuum, which they so clearly&nbsp;make necessary, until the subject was again brought into notice by Bessel, in a memoir on the length of the seconds pendulum, published in 1828 (Memoirs of the Berlin Academy for 1826), in which the effect of the adhesive air was shown by decisive experiments,&nbsp;and given as an original discovery. Bessel determined the quantity denoted in the text by » in two different ways;—by swinging in&nbsp;air two spheres of equal diameter, but of different specific gravity (brass and ivory), and by swinging the same sphere alternately in&nbsp;air and water. The first mode gave n = 1∙916, a value which he afterwards increased to l<sup>-</sup>956 (Schumacher's </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Astronomische Xa-ehrichten,</span><span class="font3"> No. 223); and the second gave n = 1'625, which is within the limits assigned by Du Buat. Mr BaiIy, who investigated&nbsp;this subject with great care by means of a vacuum apparatus, gives, as the mean result of his experiments, n ≈ 1∙846 ; and he observes that the experiments seem to show that in pendulums ofequal length and of similar construction, the factor » depends on the&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">form</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">magnitude</span><span class="font3"> of the moving body, and is not affected by its weight or specific gravity.
