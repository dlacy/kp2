<p><label>RICHELIEU</label>
Louis François Armand du Plessis, Duc de, marshal of France and grand-nephew of Cardinal Richelieu, was born in Paris, 13th March 1696, and died in the same city 8th August 1788. Besides his reputation as the most scandalous Lovelace of a scandalous age, he attained, in spite of a deplorably defective education, distinction as a diplomatist and general. As ambassador to Vienna (1725-1729) he settled in 1727 the preliminaries of peace; in 1745 he helped to gain the victory of Fontenoy ; three years afterwards he made a brilliant defence of Genoa; in 1756 he expelled the English from Minorca by the capture of the San Felipe fortress ; and in 1757-1758 he closed his military career by those pillaging campaigns in Hanover which procured him the sobriquet of <hi rend="italic">Petit Père de la Maraude.</hi> In his early days he was thrice imprisoned in the Bastille,— in 1711 at the instance of his stepfather, in 1716 in consequence of a duel, and in 1719 for his share in Alberoni’s conspiracy against the Regent. He was thrice married : first, against his will, at the age of fourteen to Mademoiselle de Noailles; secondly, in 1734, by the intrigues (according to the witty Frenchman’s own account) of Voltaire, to Mademoiselle de Guise ; and thirdly, when he was eighty-four years old, to an Irish lady. Marshal Richelieu’s <hi rend="italic">Mémoires</hi> published by Soulavie in nine volumes (1790) are partially spurious.</p>
