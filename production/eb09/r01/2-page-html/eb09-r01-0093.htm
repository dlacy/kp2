<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Though Raphael himself does not appear to have practised the art of engraving, yet this formed one of the many branches of art which&nbsp;were carried on under his supervision. A large number of his&nbsp;designs were engraved by his pupils Marcantouio Raimondi (see&nbsp;vol. xv. p. 530) and Agostino Veneziano. These valuable engravings are from Raphael’s sketches, not from his finished pictures,&nbsp;and in some cases they show important alterations made in the&nbsp;execution of the picture. Raimondi’s engraving of the S. Cecilia&nbsp;of Bologna in design is very inferior to that of the actual painting.&nbsp;Several of Raphael’s most important compositions are known to us&nbsp;only by these early engravings, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">c.g.,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> the Massacre of the Innocents&nbsp;(engraved by Raimondi), which is one of his finest works, both for&nbsp;skilful composition and for masterly drawing of the nude. Another&nbsp;magnificent design is the Judgment of Paris, containing a large&nbsp;number of figures ; the nude figure of Minerva is a work of especial&nbsp;force and beauty. A standing figure of Lueretia@@<sup>2</sup> about to stab&nbsp;herself is also one of his most lovely figures. Many of Raphael’s&nbsp;studies for Marcantonio’s engravings still exist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Archaeology.</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">—As an antiquary Raphael deserves to take the highest rank. His report@@<sup>3</sup> to Leo X. in 1518 is an eloquent plea&nbsp;for the preservation of ancient buildings. In 1515 he had been&nbsp;appointed by Leo X. inspector of all excavations in Rome and&nbsp;within 10 miles round. His careful study of the antique, both&nbsp;statues and modes of decoration, is clearly shown in many of his&nbsp;frescos, and especially in the graceful stucco reliefs and painted&nbsp;grotteschi, of which he and his pupils made such skilful use in&nbsp;the decorations of the Vatican loggie, the Villa Madaina, and&nbsp;elsewhere.@@<sup>4</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Raphael's Fame</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">.—When we consider the immense field over which his labours were spread and the strong personal&nbsp;individuality which appears in all these varied branches of&nbsp;art, together with the almost incredible number of paintings that issued from his studio, it will be seen that he&nbsp;must have laboured with an amount of unflagging industry&nbsp;which has perhaps never been surpassed, and that too in a&nbsp;time and in a city of which the social habits and luxurious&nbsp;splendour certainly threw every possible temptation in the&nbsp;way of steady application and regular work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Among all the painters of the world none has been so universally popular as Raphael, or has so steadily maintained his pre-eminent reputation throughout the many&nbsp;changes in taste which have taken place in the last three&nbsp;and a half centuries. Apart from his combined merits as&nbsp;a draughtsman, colourist, and master of graceful composition, he owes the constancy of admiration which has been&nbsp;felt for him partly to the wide range of his subjects, but&nbsp;still more to the wonderful varieties of his style. If the&nbsp;authorship of his paintings were unknown, who would&nbsp;guess that the Sposalizio of the Brera, the Madonna del&nbsp;Baidacchino of the Pitti, and the Transfiguration could&nbsp;possibly be the work of one painter 1 In his earliest pictures he touches the highly spiritual and sacred art of the&nbsp;Perugian Fiorenzo di Lorenzo, while in his latest Roman&nbsp;work he is fully embarked in the pagan spirit of the last&nbsp;development of the Renaissance, already on the brink of&nbsp;the most rapid decline. In the seventeen or eighteen years&nbsp;which composed his short working life he passed through&nbsp;stages of development for which a century would not have&nbsp;seemed too long, while other painters lived through the&nbsp;same changeful time with but little alteration in their&nbsp;manner of work. Perugino, who outlived his wonderful&nbsp;pupil, completed in 1521 Raphael’s San Severo fresco in&nbsp;a style differing but little from his paintings executed in&nbsp;the previous century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">In versatility of power Raphael (as a painter) remains almost without a rival; whether painting an altar-piece</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">for a church, a large historical fresco, a portrait, or decorative scenes from classical mythology, he seems to excel equally in each; and the widely different methods of&nbsp;painting in tempera, oil, or fresco are employed by him&nbsp;with apparently equal facility. His range of scale is no&nbsp;less remarkable, varying from a miniature, finished like an&nbsp;illuminated MS., to colossal figures in fresco dashed in&nbsp;with inimitable breadth and vigour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">An additional glory is thrown round his memory by the personal beauty, charm of manner, and deep kindliness of&nbsp;heart which endeared him to all who knew him.@@<sup>5</sup> His&nbsp;sincere modesty was not diminished by his admission as&nbsp;an equal by the princes of the church, the distinguished&nbsp;scholars, and the world-famed men of every class who&nbsp;formed the courts of Julius II. and Leo X. In accordance&nbsp;with the spirit of the age he lived with considerable display and luxury, and was approached with the utmost&nbsp;deference by the ambassadors of foreign princes, whether&nbsp;their master desired a picture, or, as the duke of Ferrara&nbsp;did, sent to consult him on the best cure for smoky&nbsp;chimneys. To his pupils he was as a father, and they&nbsp;were all, as Vasari says, “ vinti dalla sua cortesia ” ; they&nbsp;formed round him a sort of royal retinue, numbering about&nbsp;fifty youths, each talented in some branch of the arts.@@<sup>6&nbsp;</sup>Giulio Romano and Gianfrancesco Penni, his two favourite&nbsp;pupils, lived with him in the Palazzo di Bramante, a house&nbsp;near St Peter’s, where he resided during the greater part&nbsp;of his life in Rome. This fine palace, designed by Bramante, was destroyed in the 17 th century at the same&nbsp;time as Raphael’s Palazzo dell’ Aquila.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">It is difficult to realize the furor of grief and enthusiasm excited by the master’s death on Good Friday 1520, at the&nbsp;age of thirty-seven exactly, after an attack of fever which&nbsp;lasted only ten days. His body was laid out in state in&nbsp;his studio, by the side of the unfinished Transfiguration,&nbsp;and all Rome flocked to the place for a last sight of the&nbsp;“divino pittore.” His property amounted to about&nbsp;¿030,000 ; his drawings and MSS. he left to Giulio&nbsp;Romano and Gianfrancesco Penni ; his newly bought land&nbsp;to Cardinal Bibbiena, the uncle of the lady to whom he&nbsp;had been betrothed ; there were liberal bequests to his&nbsp;servants; and the rest was mostly divided among his&nbsp;relatives at Urbino. He desired to be buried in the Pantheon, under the noble dome which he and Bramante had&nbsp;dreamed of rivalling. His body is laid beside an altar,&nbsp;which he endowed with an annual chantry, and on the&nbsp;wall over it is a plain slab, with an inscription written by&nbsp;his friend Cardinal Bembo. Happily his grave has as yet&nbsp;escaped the disfigurement of a pretentious monument such&nbsp;as those erected to Michelangelo, Dante, and other great&nbsp;Italians ; it has not, however, remained undisturbed : in&nbsp;1833 it was opened and the bones examined.@@<sup>7</sup> In March&nbsp;1883 a festival was held at Urbino, on the occasion of the&nbsp;4th centenary of his birth, and on this occasion many&nbsp;interesting articles on Raphael were published, especially&nbsp;one by Geymüller, “ Le IV<sup>me</sup> Centenaire de la Naissance&nbsp;de Raphaël,” 1483-1883, in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Gaz. de Lausanne</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">, March&nbsp;1883.</span></p>
