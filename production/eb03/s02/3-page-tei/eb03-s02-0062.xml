Agitated with the  hazardous ſtate of her affairs, ſhe publiſhed a new proclamation, in which ſhe employed herſelf to refute theſe acccuſations; and in which ſhe took the opportunity  to expreſs, in a very forcible manner, not only her attachment to her people and the laws, but the fond affection that ſhe bore to the prince, whom ſhe conſidered as the chief joy of her life, and without whom all her days would be comfortleſs.</p><p>The declarations of the queen were treated with ſcorn. The nobles, abounding in vaſſals, and having the hearts of the people, were ſoon in a ſituation to take the field. They were advancing to the capital. The royal army was not yet aſſembled; and the queen and Bothwel ſuſpected that the caſtle of Edinburgh would ſhut its gates upon them. The fidelity of Sir James Balfour the deputy-governor had been ſtaggered by the practices of the earl of Marre and Sir James Melvil. Mary left her palace of Holyroodhouſe, and was conducted to Borthwick caſtle. The aſſociated lords, informed of her flight, took the road to this fortreſs with 2000 horſe. The lord Hume, by a rapid march, preſented himſelf before it with the diviſion under his command: but being unable to guard all its avenues, the queen and Bothwel effected their eſcape to Dunbar; where the ſtrength of the fortifications gave them a full ſecurity againſt a ſurpriſe.</p><p>Upon this ſecond diſappointment, the nobles reſolved to enter Edinburgh, and to augment their ſtrength by new partizans. The earl of Huntley and the lord  Boyd were here on the ſide of the queen, with the arch- biſhop of St Andrew’s, the biſhop of Roſs, and the abbot of Kilwinning. They endeavoured to animate the inhabitants to defend their town and the cauſe of their ſovereign. But the tide of popularity was favourable to the confederated lords. The magiſtrates ordered the gates of the city to be ſhut; but no farther reſiſtance was intended. The lords, forcing St Mary’s port, found an eaſy admittance, and took poſſeſſion of the capital. The earl of Huntley and the queen’s friends fled to the caſtle, to Sir James Balfour, who had been the confident of Bothwel, and who agreed to protect them, although he was now concluding a treaty with the inſurgents.</p><p>The aſſociated lords now formed themſelves into a council, and circulated a proclamation. By this paper they declared, that the queen being detained in captivity, was neither able to govern her realm, nor to command a proper trial to be taken of the king’s murder. In an emergency ſo preſſing, they had not deſpaired of their country; but were determined to deliver the queen from bondage, to protect the perſon of the prince, to revenge the murder of the king, and to vindicate the nation from the infamy it had hitherto ſuffered through the impunity of the regicides. They therefore commanded in general all the ſubjects of Scotland whatſoever, and the burgeſſes and inhabitants of Edinburgh in particular, to take a part with them, and to join in the advancement of purpoſes ſo beneficial and ſalutary. The day after they had publiſhed this proclamation,</p><p>they iſſued another in terms that were ſtronger and more reſolute. They definitively expreſſed their perſuaſion of Bothwel’s guilt in the rape and ſeduction of the queen, and in his perpetration of the king's murder, in order to accompliſh his marriage. They inculcated it as their firm opinion, that Bothwel was now inſtigated with a deſign to murder the young prince, and that he was collecting troops with this view. Addreſſing themſelves, therefore, to all the ſubjects of the realm, whether they reſided in counties or in boroughs, they invited them to come forward to their ſtandard; and deſired them to remember, that all perſons who ſhould preſume to diſobey them ſhould be treated as enemies and traitors.</p><p>Bothwel, in the mean time, was not inactive; and the proclamations of the queen had brought many of her vaſſals to her aſſiſtance. Four thouſand combatants ranged themſelves on her ſide. This force might augment as ſhe approached to her capital; and Bothwel was impatient to put his fortunes to the iſſue of a battle, he left the ſtrong caſtle of Dunbar, where the nobles were not prepared to aſſail him, and where he might have remained in ſafety till they diſperſed themſelves. For their proclamations were not ſo ſucceſsful as they had expected; their proviſions and ſtores were ſcanty; and the zeal of the common people, unſupported by proſperity, would ſoon have abated. Imprudent precipitation ſerved them in a moſt effectual manner. When the queen had reached Gladſmuir, ſhe ordered a maniſeſto to be read to her army, and to be circulated among her ſubjects. By this paper, ſhe replied to the proclamations of the confederated nobles, and charged them with treachery and rebellion. She treated their reaſons of hoſtility as mere pretences, and as inventions which could not bear to be examined. As to the king’s murder, ſhe proteſted, that ſhe herlelf was fully determined to revenge it, if ſhe could be ſo fortunate as to diſcover its perpetrators. With regard to the bondage from which they were ſo deſirous to relieve her, ſhe obſerved, that it was a falſehood ſo notorious, that the ſimpleſt of her ſubjects could confute it; for her marriage had been celebrated in a public manner, and the nobles could hardly have forgotten that they had ſubſcribed a bond recommending Bothwel to be her huſband. With regard to the induſtrious defamations of this nobleman, it was urged, that he had diſcovered the utmoſt ſolicitude to eſtabliſh his innocence. He had invited a ſcrutiny into his guilt; the juſtice of his country had abſolved him; the three eſtates aſſembled in parliament were ſatisfied with the proceedings of his judges and jury; and he had offered to maintain his quarrel againſt any perſon whatſoever who was equal to him in rank and of an honeſt reputation. The nobles, ſhe ſaid, to give a fair appearance to their treaſon, pretended, that Bothwel had ſchemed the deſtruction of the prince, and that they were in arms to protect him. The prince, however, was actually in their own cuſtody; the me they made of him was that of a ſkreen to their perſidiouſneſs; and the real</p><p>purpoſes with which they were animated, were the overthrow of her greatneſs, the ruin of her poſterity, and the uſurpation of the royal authority. She therefore intreated the aid of her faithful ſubjects; and as the prize of their valorous ſervice, ſhe held out to them the eſtates and poſſeſſions oſ the rebels.</p></body></text></TEI>
