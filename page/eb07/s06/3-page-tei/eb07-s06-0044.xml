Their request was warmly supported by the town cantons ; but the mountaineers of the forest cantons objected to it, and the dispute ran so high, that at a general congress of all the confederates, the deputies were at the point of coming to blows, and the confederation was threatened with dissolution. This catastrophe was happily averted by the eloquent remonstrances of a pious hermit, called Nicholas Laven- brugen. His simple but pathetic appeal had the effect of removing their differences, and Soleure and Freyburg were received into the Swiss confederation.</p><p>In the year 1497, the Grisons entered into a treaty offensive and defensive with the confederate cantons. This alliance gave great offence to the emperor Maximilian, who immediately collected his troops, and marched both against the Grisons and their Swiss allies. Battle after battle took place, in all of which the Austrians were defeated ; and the emperor having lost 20,000 of his troops in eight months, and finding further exertions useless, concluded a peace with the Swiss at Basel in September 1499, by which he acknowledged their unconditional independence as a nation. This war, called the Suabian war, was the last the Swiss had to sustain for their independence. For three centuries after this date no farther attempts were made against the liberties of the Swiss cantons, which assumed their station as an independent power in Europe. The towns of Basel and Schaffhausen were received into the confederation in 1501, and Appenzell was added in 1513, and completed the number of thirteen cantons, which have constituted the Helvetic body till within our own times, namely, Zürich ; Schwytz, Uri, Unterwalden, the three Waldstätten or forest cantons ; Lucerne, Claris, Zug, Berne, Freyburg, Soleure, Basel, Schaffhausen, and Appenzell. Besides these, there were various confederates and associates who were in alliance with the cantons, and entitled to assistance in case of foreign attack. These were the abbot of St Gall, the city of the same name, the towns of Mulhausen and Bienne, the Grisons and the Valais, the republic of Geneva, and the county of Neuchâtel.</p><p>Switzerland had scarcely obtained rest from her political wars, when religious disputes arose among the cantons, and converted into fierce enemies those who had lately fought side by side in defence of their liberties. The unscrupulous sale of indulgences by the agents of Pope Leo X. in Germany, Switzerland, and the other countries, led to a searching inquiry into the whole of the papal system, and caused vast multitudes to renounce altogether the authority of the church of Rome. In no country did the doctrines of the Reformation create a greater excitement, or meet with more zealous supporters, than in Switzerland. The inhabitants of Zürich, Berne, Schaffhausen, Basel, St Gall, and the Grisons, as well as of many parts in the neighbourhood of Geneva and Neuchâtel, eagerly adopted the opinions of Calvin and Zuinglius, while the people of the Waldstätten, and of Soleure and Freyburg, being more secluded and ignorant, and more under the control of the priests, continued staunch in their support of the papal authority. Fierce animosities speedily arose between the reformed and the popish cantons, and various sanguinary wars were carried on for many years. During these internal broils, the territory of the confederation was violated and their rights infringed without remonstrance ; and such was the divided state of the cantons, that Austria, their ancient enemy, might easily have subdued them, but for the jealousy of the other great powers. To prevent this danger, they, in concluding the treaty of Westphalia in 1648, formally recognised the independence of the Swiss confede</p><p>ration. But though Switzerland was thus secured against the invasion of any of the greater powers, it continued to be torn by internal dissensions. The arbitrary manner in which the large towns levied taxes upon the people of the country, and of the smaller towns and villages, caused great dissatisfaction, especially in the territories of Berne and Lucerne, and at length the peasantry rose up in rebellion against their rulers ; and it was not until after considerable bloodshed that the revolt was quelled, and several of the chiefs who were taken alive were tried, condemned, and executed. Scarcely had this insurrection terminated when religious quarrels again broke out between the Protestants and the Romanists. Till near the close of the seventeenth century, Switzerland was distracted by the dissensions arising from this cause ; and in 1703, the whole of the Protestant and of the Catholic cantons were openly arrayed against each other, and a civil war of several years’ duration ensued. The immediate cause of the war was a quarrel between the people of Toggenburg and their superior the abbot of St Gall, who had endeavoured in a fraudulent manner to deprive them of their privileges. Zürich and Berne took part with the people, while the Catholic cantons espoused the cause of the abbot. Several battles were fought, and at length an army of Catholics, 12,000 in number, encountered 8000 Bernois at Villmergen. The conflict lasted six hours, and in the end the Catholics were completely routed, leaving 2000 of their number dead upon the field. A peace was soon after concluded on terms advantageous to the victors.</p><p>From this period till towards the close of the eighteenth century, the state of Switzerland underwent no material alteration ; and their internal discord paved the way for external aggression, and rendered them an easy prey to the grasping ambition of the French republic,. In 1797, the French government, which had previously interfered in the affairs of Switzerland, manifested a determination to take possession of that country, and evidently sought for a pretence to come to an open rupture. The Swiss government placed their only hope in a passive neutrality, which in the end proved their ruin. For the sake of peace they submitted with the utmost servility to the imperious and insulting demands of the directory ; but their humiliation did not save them from destruction. The emissaries of France laboured but too successfully to incite dissensions among the people, and the French rulers made these dissensions a pretext for their interference with the constitution of the country. In this way the bailiwicks of Valtelina, Chiavenna, and Bormio, which had been for centuries dependent on the Grisons, were incorporated with the Cisalpine republic. Insurrections broke out in several of the cantons, and were rendered triumphant by the assistance of the French arms. The inhabitants of Berne, Soleure, Freyburg, and especially of the Waldstätten, made a brave but ineffectual stand in defence of their rights and liberties. The most horrible excesses were committed by the French soldiers ; the towns were successively rifled of their public property, and great part of the country was laid waste, and many of the inhabitants reduced to utter destitution. A new constitution was framed by the French directory, which provided that Switzerland should form a single republic, one and indivisible, under a central government to be established at Aarau. The country was divided into twenty-two cantons, and the supreme authority was committed to two councils and an executive directory, in whom was vested the appointment of prefects and other authorities for the various cantons, which were thus transformed into departments, with the loss of their independence as separate states. After this new constitution was established, a treaty was made with France, by one of the articles of which the Swiss republic was bound to furnish to its new ally a force of 18,000 men ; and thus all the miseries of the conscription</p></body></text></TEI>
