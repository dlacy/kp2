<p><span class="font0">the ſpecies </span><span class="font3">by a very numerous ſtock of fe :ds, of which perhaps not one in 500 need take root in order to continue an equal numbcr of plants. As it is thus alſo in&nbsp;regard to infects, it cannot but happen, that if a favourable ſeaſon encourage the hatching of all thofe eggs, a&nbsp;very ſmall number of which alone were neceſſiry to&nbsp;continue the ſpecies, we muſt, in ſuch ſeaſons, have a&nbsp;proportionate abundance oſ them. There appeared a-.bout 50 years ago, in London, fuch a prodigious lwarm&nbsp;of the little beetle we call the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">lady-cow,</span><span class="font3"> that the very&nbsp;.poſts in the ſtreets were eveιγwhere covered with them.&nbsp;But thanks to the progreſs of philoſophy among us, we&nbsp;had no body to affert that it rained cow-ladies, but con-tented ourſelves with faying that it had been a favour-able ſeaſon for their eggs. The prodigious number of&nbsp;a fort of grub which did vaſt miſchief about the ſame&nbsp;period among the corn and graſs by-eating off their&nbsp;roots, might alſo have been ſuppoſed to proceed from&nbsp;its having rained grubs by people fond of making every&nbsp;thing a prodigy. ; but our knowledge in natural hiſtory&nbsp;aſſured us, that theſe were only the hexapode worms of&nbsp;the. common hedge-beetle called the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">cock-chafer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">' The raining of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">fiſhes</span><span class="font3"> has been a prodigy alfo much talked of in.France, where the ſtreets of </span><span class="font0">a </span><span class="font3">town at ſome&nbsp;diſtance from Paris, after a terrible hurricane in the&nbsp;night, which tore up trees, blew down houfes, &amp;c. were&nbsp;found in a manner covered with fiſhes of various ſizes.&nbsp;Nobody here made any doubt of theſe having fallen from&nbsp;the clouds ; nor did the abſurdity of fiſh, of five or fix&nbsp;inches long, being generated in the air, at all ſtartle the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">i</span><span class="font3">&gt;eople, or ſhake their belief in the miracle, till they bund, upon inquiry, that a very well-ſtocked fiſh-pond,&nbsp;which ſtood on an eminence in the neighbourhood, had&nbsp;been blown dry by the hurricane, and only the great fiſh&nbsp;left at the bottom of it, all the ſmaller fry having been&nbsp;.toffed into their ſtreets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Upon the whole, all the ſuppoſed marvellous rains have been owing to ſubſtances naturally produced on the&nbsp;-earth, and either never having been in the air at all, or&nbsp;only carried thither by accident.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In Slleſia, after a great dearth of wheat in that country, there happened a violent ſtorm of wind and rain, and the earth was afterwards covered, in many places,&nbsp;with ſmall round feeds. The vulgar cried out that Pro-vidence had ſent them food, and that it had rained </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">m'd-let :</span><span class="font3"> but theſe were, in reality, only the feeds of a ſpe-cies of veronica, or fpeed-well, very common in that&nbsp;country ; and whoſe feeds being juſt ripe at that time,&nbsp;the wind had diſlodged them from their capſules, and&nbsp;ſcattered them about. In our own country, we have&nbsp;hiſtories of rains of this marvellous kind, but all fabu-lous. It was once faid to rain </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">wheat</span><span class="font3"> in wiltſhire ; and&nbsp;the people were all alarmed at it as a miracle, till Mr&nbsp;Dole ſhowed them, that what they took for wheat was&nbsp;.only the feeds or kernels of the berries of ivy, which being then fully ripe, the wind had diſlodged from the&nbsp;fides oſ houfes, and trunks of trees, on which the ivy&nbsp;that produced them crept.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And we even once had a raining of fiſhes near the coaſt of Kent in a terrible hurricane, with thunder and&nbsp;lightning. The people who ſaw ſmall ſprats ſtrewed&nbsp;all about afterwards, would have it that they had fallen&nbsp;from the clouds ; but thoſe who confidered how far the&nbsp;high winds have been known to carry the ſea-water, did&nbsp;not wonder </span><span class="font0">that </span><span class="font3">they ſhould be able </span><span class="font0">to carry ſmall </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">fifh&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">with it ſo ſmall a part of the way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the Philofophical Tranfactions for 1782 we have the following account of a preternatural kind of rain&nbsp;by Count de Gioeni : “ The morning of the 24th inſtant there appeared here a moſt ſingular phenomenon.&nbsp;Every place expofed to the air was found wet with&nbsp;a coloured cretaceous grey water, which, after evapoia-ting and filtrating away, left every place covered with&nbsp;it to the height of two or three lines ; and all the ironwork that was touched by it became ruſty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&quot; The public, inclined to the marvellous, fancied va--τious cauſes of this rain, and began to fear for the ani-mals and vegetables. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*►</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&quot; In places where rain-water was uſed, they abſtain-ed from it : ſome ſufpecting vitriolic principles to be mixed with it, and others predicting ſome epidemical&nbsp;diforder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&quot; Thoſe who had obſerved the exploſions of Etna 20 days and more before, were inclined to believe it origi-nated from one of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&quot; The ſhower extended from N.⅞N.E. to S.4S.W. ov¢r the fields, about 70 miles in a right line from the&nbsp;vertex of Etna.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&quot; There is nothing new in volcanos having thrown up ſand, and alſo ſtones, by the violent expanſive force&nbsp;generated within them, which ſand has been carried by&nbsp;the wind to diſtant regions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“ But the colour and ſubtilty of the matter occaſion-ed doubts concerning its origin ; which increafed from the remarkable circumſtance of the water in which it&nbsp;came incorporated ; for which reaſons ſome other principle or origin was ſuſpected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“ It became, therefore, neceſſary by all means to aſ-certain the nature of this matter, in order to be con-vinced of its origin, and of the effects it might produce. This could not be done without the help of a chemical&nbsp;analyſis. To do this then with certainty, I endeavour-ed to collect this rain ſrom places where it was moſt&nbsp;probable no heterogeneous matter would be mixed with&nbsp;it. . I therefore chofe the plant called </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">brajfica capitata,&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">which having large and turned-up leaves, they contain-ed enough of this coloured water : many of thefe I&nbsp;emptied into a veffel, and left the contents to fettle till&nbsp;the water became clear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&quot; This being ſeparated into another veſſel, I tried it with vegetable alkaline liquors and mineral acids ; but&nbsp;could obferve no decompoſition by either. I then evaporated the water in order to reunite the ſubſtances that&nbsp;might be in ſolution ; and touching it again with the&nbsp;aforeſaid liquors, it ſhowed a flight eſſerveſcence with&nbsp;the acids, when tried with the ſyrup of violets, this&nbsp;became a pale green ; ſo that I was perſuaded it contained a calcareous ſalt. with the decoction of galls no&nbsp;precipitation was produced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&quot; The matter being afterwards dried in the ſhade, it appeared a very ſubtile fine earth, of a cretaceous co-lυur, but inert, from having been diluted by the rain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&quot; I next thought of calcining it with a flow fire, and it aſſumed the colour of a brick. A portion of&nbsp;this being put into a crucible, I applied to it a ſtronger&nbsp;heat; by which it loſt almoſt all its acquired colour.&nbsp;Again, I expofed a portion of this for a longer time to&nbsp;a very violent heat (from which a vitrification might be</span></p>
