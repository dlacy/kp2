                form the contents of the 5th volume (part 2) of his <hi rend="italic">Recherches sur

                4to).</p>
            <p>All the succeeding herpetologists adopted either OppeFs or Cuvier’s view as to the
                number of orders of reptiles, or as to the position Batraehians ought to take in
                their relation to reptiles proper, with the single exception of D. <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">de Blainville.</hi> He divided the “ oviparous subtype ” of
                Vertebrates into four classes, Birds, Reptiles, Amphibians and Fishes,@@<hi
                    rend="sup">1</hi> a modification of the system which is all the more significant
                as he designates the reptiles “<hi rend="italic">Squammiftres Ornithoides,
                    écailleux,”</hi> and the amphibians “ <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nudipelliftres, Ichthyoides nusP</hi> In these terms we perceive clear
                indications of the relations which exist to the class of birds on the one hand,
                and to that of fishes on the other; but, unfortunately, Blainville himself did not
                follow up the ideas thus expressed, and abandoned</p>
            <p>even the terms in a later edition of his systematic tables.</p>
            <p>The direct or indirect influence of the work of French anatomists manifested itself
                in the systems of the other herpetologists of this period. The Crocodiles,
                especially, which hitherto (strange to say, even in Cuvier’s classification) had
                been placed as one of the families of Saurians, now commence to be separated from
                them. <hi rend="smallcaps">Merrem </hi><hi rend="italic">(Versuch eines Systems
                    der Amphibien,</hi> Marburg, 1820, 8vo) distinguishes two</p>
            <p>classes of “ Amphibians,” Pholidota and Batrachia.</p>
            <p>The Pholidota (or Reptiles) are divided into three orders, distinguished chiefly by
                osteological and Splanchnological characters:—</p>
            <p>1.    Testudinata.</p>
            <p>2.    <hi rend="smallcaps">Loricata</hi> ( = Crocodiles).</p>

                limbs, and not adopted by his successors. The greater part of his work is occupied
                with a synopsis of all the species of Reptiles known, each being shortly
                characterized by a diagnosis; but, as only a small proportion (about one hundred
                and seventy) were known to him from autopsy, this synopsis has all the faults of a
                compilation.</p>
            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Latreille,</hi> who commenced the study of reptiles as early as
                1801, had kept pace with the progress of science when he published, in 1825, his <hi
                    rend="italic">Familles naturelles du règne animal</hi> (Paris, 1825, Svo). He
                separated the Batra-ehians as a <hi rend="italic">class</hi> from the Reptiles, and
                the latter he divides into two sections only, Cataphracta and Squamosa—in the
                former Crocodiles being associated with the Chelonians. He bases this view on the
                development of a carapace in both, on the structure of the feet, on the fixed
                quadrate bone, on the single organ of copulation. None of the succeeding
                herpetologists adopted a combination founded on such important characters except J.
                E. <hi rend="smallcaps">Gray,</hi> who, however, destroyed Latreille’s idea of
                Cataphracta by adding the Amphisbaenians@@<hi rend="sup">2</hi> as a third</p>
            <p>order.</p>
            <p>A mass of new materials now began to accumulate from all parts of the world in
                European museums. Among others, Spix had brought from Brazil a rich spoil to the
                Munich Museum, and the. Bavarian Academy charged <hi rend="smallcaps">Joh.
                    Wagler </hi>to prepare a general system of reptiles and batra-chians. His
                    work,@@<hi rend="sup">3</hi> the result of ten years’ labour, is a simple
                but lasting monument to a young naturalist,@@<hi rend="sup">4</hi> who, endowed
                with an ardent imagination, only too frequently misinterpreted the evidence of
                facts, or forced it into the service of preconceived ideas. Cuvier had drawn
                attention to certain resemblances in</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>some parts of the osseous structure of <hi rend="italic">Ichthyosaurus</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Ptero-dactylus</hi> to dolphins, birds, crocodiles, &amp;c.
                Wagler, seizing upon such analogical resemblances, separated those extinct Saurians
                from the class of Reptiles, and formed of them and the Monotremes a distinct class
                of Vertebrates, intermediate between mammals and birds, which he called Gryphi. We
                must admit that he made free use of his imagination by defining his class of Gryphi
                as “ vertebrates with lungs lying free in the pectoral cavity; oviparous development
                of the embryo (within or) without thc parent; the young fed (or suckled?) by the
                parents.” By the last character this Waglcrian class is distinguished from the
                reptiles.</p>
            <p>Reptiles (in which Wagler includes Batrachians) arc divided into eight orders:
                Testudines, Crocodili, Laeertae, Serpentes, Afigues, Caeciliae, Ranae and Iehthyodi.
                He has great merit in having employed, for the subdivision of the families of
                lizards, the structure of the tongue and thc mode of insertion of the teeth in the
                jaws. On the other hand, WagIer entirely failed in arranging snakes in natural
                families, venomous and non-venomous types being mixed in the majority of his
                groups.</p>
            <p>L. <hi rend="smallcaps">Fitzinger</hi> was Wagler’s contemporary; his first work@@<hi
                    rend="sup">5</hi> preceded Wagler’s system by four years. As he says in
                the preface, his object was to arrange the reptiles in “ a natural system.”
                Unfortunately, in order to attain this object, Fitzinger paid regard to the most
                superficial points of resemblance; and in the<hi rend="italic">tabula affinitatum
                    generum </hi>which he constructed to demonstrate “ the progress of nature ” he
                has been much more successful in placing closely allied generic forms in contiguity
                than in tracing the relationships of the higher groups. That table is prepared in
                the form of a genealogical tree, but Fitzinger wished to express thereby merely the
                amount of morphological resemblance, and there is no evidence whatever in the text
                that he had a clear idea of genetic affinity. The Batraehians are placed at the
                bottom of the scheme, leading through Hyla to the Geckos (clearly on account of the
                digital dilatations) and through Caecilia to Amphisbaena. At the top Draco leads
                through Pterodactylus to the Bats (Pteropus), Ichthyosaurus to the Cetaceans
                (Del-phinus), Emys to the Monotremes, Testudo to Manis, and the Marine Turtles to
                the Divers and Penguins.</p>
            <p>In Fitzinger’s system the higher groups are, in fact, identical with those proposed
                by Merrem, while greater originality is shown in the subdivision of the orders. He
                differed also widely from Wagler in his views as to the relations of the extinct
                forms. The order of Loricata consists of two families, the Ichthyosauroidea and
                Croco-diloidea, the former comprising Iguanodon, Plesiosaurus, Sauro-cephalus and
                Ichthyosaurus. In the order Squamata Lacertilians and Ophidians are combined and
                divided into twenty-two families, almost all based on the most conspicuous external
                characters: the first two, viz. the Geckos and Chameleons, arc natural enough, but
                in the three following Iguanoids and Agamoids are sadly mixed, Pterodactyles and
                Draco forming one family; Megalo-saurus, Mosasaurus, Varanus, Tejus, &amp;c., are
                associated in another named Ameivoidea; the Amphisbaenidae are correctly
                defined; the Colubroidea are a heterogeneous assemblage of thirty genera; but with
                his family of Bungaroidea Fitzinger makes an attempt to separate at least a part of
                the venomous Colubrine Snakes from the Viperines, which again are differentiated
                from the last family, that of Crotaloidea.</p>
            <p>If this little work had been his only performance in the field of herpetology his
                name would have been honourably mentioned among his fellow-workers. But the promise
                of his early labours was not justified by his* later work, and if we take notice of
                the latter here it is only because his name has become attached to many a reptile
                through the pedantic rules of zoological nomenclature. The labours of Wiegmann,
                Müller, Duméril and Bibron exercised no influence on him, and when he commenced to
                publish a new system of reptiles in 1843,@@<hi rend="sup">6</hi> of which
                fortunately one fasciculus only appeared, he exhibited a classification in which
                morphological facts are entirely superseded by fanciful ideas of the vaguest kind of
                physiosophy, each class of vertebrates being divided</p>
