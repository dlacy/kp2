<p><span class="font1">a sunny open, remote from the unfathomable depths of mystery and clouds of religious emotion which beset the way of the&nbsp;sincere Catholic and Protestant alike.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The effects of the Protestant secession on the doctrines, organization and practices of the Roman Catholic Church are&nbsp;difficult to estimate, still more so to substantiate. It&nbsp;is clear that the doctrinal conclusions of the council&nbsp;of Trent were largely determined by the necessity&nbsp;of condemning Protestant tenets, and that the result&nbsp;of the council was to give the Roman Catholic faith a more&nbsp;precise form than it would otherwise have had. It is much&nbsp;less certain that the disciplinary reforms which the council,&nbsp;following the example of its predecessors, re-enacted, owed&nbsp;anything to Protestantism, unless indeed the council would have&nbsp;shown itself less intolerant in respect to such innovations as the&nbsp;use of the vernacular in the services had this not smacked of&nbsp;evangelicalism. In the matter of the pope’s supremacy, the&nbsp;council followed the canon law and Thomas Aquinas, not&nbsp;the decrees of the council of Constance. It prepared the way&nbsp;for the dogmatic formulation of the plenitude of the papal&nbsp;power three centuries later by the council of the Vatican. The&nbsp;Protestants have sometimes taken credit to themselves for the&nbsp;indubitable reforms in the Roman Catholic Church, which by&nbsp;the end of the 16th century had done away with many of the&nbsp;crying abuses against which councils and diets had so long been&nbsp;protesting. But this conservative reformation had begun&nbsp;before Luther’s preaching, and might conceivably have followed&nbsp;much the same course had his doctrine never found popular favour or been ratified by the princes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In conclusion, a word may be said of the place of the Reformation  in the history of progress and enlightenment. A&nbsp;“ philosopher,” as Gibbon long ago pointed out,&nbsp;who asks from what articles of faith </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">above</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">against&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">reason the early Reformers enfranchised their followers&nbsp;will be surprised at their timidity rather than scandalized&nbsp; by their freedom. They remained severely&nbsp;orthodox in the doctrines of the Fathers—the Trinity, the&nbsp;Incarnation, the plenary inspiration of the Bible—and they&nbsp;condemned those who rejected their teachings to a hell whose&nbsp;fires they were not tempted to extenuate. Although they surrendered&nbsp; transubstantiation, the loss of one mystery was amply&nbsp;compensated by the stupendous doctrines of original sin,&nbsp;redemption, faith, grace and predestination upon which they&nbsp;founded their theory of salvation. They ceased to appeal to&nbsp;the Virgin and saints, and to venerate images and relics, procure&nbsp;indulgences and go on pilgrimages, they deprecated the monastic&nbsp;life, and no longer nourished faith by the daily repetition of&nbsp;miracles, but in the witch persecutions their demonology cost&nbsp;the lives of thousands of innocent women. They broke the&nbsp;chain of authority, without, however, recognizing the propriety&nbsp;of toleration. In any attempt to determine the relative importance&nbsp; of Protestant and Catholic countries in promoting&nbsp;modern progress it must not be forgotten that religion is naturally&nbsp; conservative, and that its avowed business has never been&nbsp;to forward scientific research or political reform. Luther and&nbsp;his contemporaries had not in any degree the modern idea of&nbsp;progress, which first becomes conspicuous with Bacon and&nbsp;Descartes, but believed, on the contrary, that the strangling&nbsp;of reason was the most precious of offerings to God. “ Free-thinker ” and “ rationalist ” have been terms of opprobrium&nbsp;whether used by Protestants or Catholics. The pursuit of&nbsp;salvation does not dominate by any means the whole life and&nbsp;ambition of even ardent believers; statesmen, philosophers,&nbsp;men of letters, scientific investigators and inventors have&nbsp;commonly gone their way regardless of the particular form of&nbsp;Christianity which prevailed in the land in which they lived.&nbsp;The Reformation was, fundamentally, then, but one phase,&nbsp;if the most conspicuous, in the gradual decline of the majestic&nbsp;medieval ecclesiastical State, for this decline has gone on&nbsp;in France, Austria, Spain and Italy, countries in which&nbsp;the Protestant revolt against the ancient Church ended in failure.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">REFORMATORY SCHOOL, an institution for the industrial training of juvenile offenders, in which they are lodged, clothed&nbsp;and fed, as well as taught. They are to be distinguished from&nbsp;“ industrial schools,” which are institutions for potential and&nbsp;not actual delinquents. To reformatory schools in England&nbsp;are sent juveniles up to the age of sixteen who have been convicted of an offence punishable with penal servitude or imprisonment&nbsp;. The order is made by the court before which&nbsp;they are tried; the limit of detention is the age of nineteen.&nbsp;Reformatory schools are regulated by the Children Act 1908,&nbsp;which repealed the Reformatory Schools Act 1866, as amended&nbsp;by acts of 1872, 1874, 1891, 1893, 1899 and 1901. See further&nbsp;Juvenile Offenders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">REFORMED CHURCHES, the name assumed by those Protestant  bodies who adopted the tenets of Zwingli (and later of&nbsp;Calvin), as distinguished from those of the Lutheran or Evangelical divines. They are accordingly often spoken of as the Chauvinistic&nbsp; Churches, Protestant being sometimes used as a synonym&nbsp;for Lutheran. The great difference is in the attitude towards&nbsp;the Lord’s Supper, the Reformed or Calvinistic Churches repudiating&nbsp; not only transubstantiation but also the Lutheran&nbsp;consubstantiation. They also reject the use of crucifixes and&nbsp;other symbols and ceremonies retained by the Lutherans.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">REFORMED CHURCH IN AMERICA, until 1867 called officially “The Reformed Protestant Dutch Church in North America,” and still popularly called the Dutch Reformed&nbsp;Church, an American Calvinist church, originating with the&nbsp;settlers from Holland in New York, New Jersey and Delaware,&nbsp;the first permanent settlers of the Reformed faith in the New&nbsp;World. Their earliest settlements were at Manhattan, Wallabout&nbsp; and Fort Orange (now Albany), where the West India&nbsp;Company formally established the Reformed Church of Holland.</span></p>
