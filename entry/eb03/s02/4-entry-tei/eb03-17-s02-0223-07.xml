 the acid procured from fat. To obtain it, let ſome ſuet be melted in a ſkillet over the fire, along with ſome quicklime in fine powder, and conſtantly ſtirred, raiſing the fire towards the end of the operation, and taking care to avoid the vapours, which are very offenſive. By this proceſs the ſebacic acid unites with the lime into a ſebat of lime, which is difficultly ſoluble in water; it is, however, ſeparated from the fatty matters with which it is mixed by ſolution in a large quantity of boiling water. From this the neutral ſalt is ſeparated by evaporation; and, to render it pure, is calcined, rediſſolved, and again cryſtallized. After this we pour on a proper quantity of ſulphuric acid, and the ſebacic acid paſſes over by diſtillation. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Fat,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Chemistry-Index.
