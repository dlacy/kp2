The affairs of private life we cannot help recollecting, are seldom managed to any great extent through the post-office, while in many cases it remains a mystery how such matters came to be committed to paper at all, and least of all under the circumstances in which they are supposed to be recorded by these persevering, and, in the existing state of the revenue laws, formidable correspondents.</p><p>There is in the mind of Richardson a very remarkable union of feminine tastes with masculine vigour. Early accustomed peculiarly to court the society of females ; the depository of their gossip, the confident of their love secrets, the complete letter-writer of a little knot of young ladies when only thirteen years of age, the deference which he thus acquired for their tastes, and the insight he obtained into their habits of thinking, though probably springing, as Johnson believed, very much from his ow<hi rend="sup">τ</hi>n vanity and love of praise, appear to have been of the utmost use to him in his novels, in which so much of the interest rests upon the female characters, and in the minute dissection and study of emotions and sentiments in which women are either the chief actors or sufferers. The traces of this influence appear constantly, and sometimes in excess, in the minute accuracy with which he dwells, in description, upon those little particulars of looks, and voice, and gesture, and turns of speech, which men in their correspondence generally overlook, but which women note with such care, and interpret with such sagacity ; in the complacency with which he dwells on the details of robes and wedding dresses, which are conceived in the spirit of a waiting-w oman, and executed with the learning of a man-milliner ; and which, as in the minute description given by Lovelace of Clarissas’ dress at the time of her elopement, are occasionally introduced in the worst place.</p><p>The more favourable results of these tastes are exhibited in the wonderful familiarity he evinces with the feelings and sympathies of women ; for though,in his notions of perfection, either in manners or morals, we of another age often see cause to depart from Richardson’s standard, we may trust implicitly to his accuracy, when he is delineating the movements of passion in the female breast, the revolutions of feeling, or the struggle between feeling and delicacy. In his female portraits even more than in his corresponding delineations of male character, we acknowledge the justice of the remark which Sir Walter Scott applies to his portraits generally, that “ in his survey of the heart, he left neither head, bay, nor inlet behind him, until he had traced its soundings, and laid it down in his chart with all its minute sinuosities, its depths, and its shallows.” This accuracy, indeed, constitutes at once his strength and his weakness ; for not content with having surveyed the coast and taken its bearings, he still, from the very pride of discovery, insists on following the windings of the shore, and pointing out its landmarks, when those on board would have gladly seen him make his passage by the shortest course. It was the misfortune of Richardson, that, like nervous men in company, or like painters who go on retouching till the picture becomes loaded, he never knew when to have done, either with a character or a conversation. He was unskilful, as D’Israeli remarks, in the art of writing, and “ could never lay his pen down while his inkhorn supplied it.” Even as regards the description of sentiment, or the creation of characteristic dialogue, the field in which Richardson was most at home, it is certain that he carried his system, probably as much from this inability to leave off, as from choice, to extremes, particularly in his last novel, <hi rend="italic">Sir C. Grandison; </hi>and unless the reader selects that work on the system of the old lady mentioned by Sir Walter Scott, who chose it because she could sleep for half an hour at any time during</p><lb/><p>its perusal, and still find the personages just where she left them, conversing in the cedar parlour, he will probably think there is more justice than D’Israeli seems willing to admit in the cold remark of D’Alembert, <hi rend="italic">“ La nature est bonne a imiter, mais non pas jusqu' a l'ennui."</hi></p><p>It is not often that with this feminine character of intellect, a masculine vigour in painting scenes of a passionate and terrible cast is found united, and yet Richardson has proved his mastery over the higher passions, not less than his minute study of sentiment and manners, in the conclusion of <hi rend="italic">Clarissa Harlowe.</hi>  To apply to him the epithet of the Shakspeare of prose fiction, winch has been done by D’Israeli, is extravagant. A solitary creation of this kind, highly pathetic and morally impressive as it is, is but a narrow basis on which to rest the claims of the novelist to such a title. But the conception of the noble character of Clarissa Harlowe, set off by such a foil as is afforded by that of Lovelace, perhaps the most finished picture of the self-possessed and insinuating libertine ever drawn, (and certainly as great an improvement on that of the Lothario from which it was drawn, as Rowes’ hero had been on the vulgar rake of Massinger,) and the closing scenes of that novel, are at all events sufficient to place Richardson <hi rend="italic">among</hi>  the great writers of fiction ; among the few who have formed a striking and original conception, which they have wrought out with a corresponding felicity and power. It is not the common-place idea of a woman of virtue foiling the schemes of a seducer, which Richardson has undertaken to illustrate : in the case of a lady like Clarissa, of birth, education, and good feelings, Mrs. Barbauld says truly, that would have been no triumph worthy of being recorded by such a pen ; but it is the dignity, the deep interest, he has lent to the character, even in that situation of personal dishonour, witll which, from whatever cause it has arisen, we are apt to connect the idea of degradation. “ There is something,” says Mrs. Barbauld,@@<hi rend="sup">1</hi>  “ in virgin purity, to which the imagination willingly pays homage. In all ages something saintly has been attached to the idea of unblemished chastity, but it was reserved for Richardson to overcome all circumstances of dishonour and disgrace, and to throw a splendour round the violated virgin more radiant than she possessed in her first bloom. He has drawn the triumph of mental chastity ; he has drawn it uncontaminated, untarnished, and incapable of mingling with pollution.”</p><p>The other novels of Richardson, <hi rend="italic">Pamela,</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">Sir Charles Grandison,</hi>  are ofan inferior order to <hi rend="italic">Clarissa. Pamela,</hi>  his first work, besides the questionable character of some of its highly coloured scenes, the license of which leads one to smile at the notions of morality entertained by that literary oracle who declared, “ that if all other books were to be burned, Pamela and the Bible should be preserved,” is justly liable to the objections pointed out by Mrs. Barbauld, that the heroine throughout her probation seems guided as much by wwltlly wisdom as by the love of virtue ; that she acts like one who knows her price, and that her purity is protected more by the chance of securing a rich husband, and the prospect of “the gilded coach and dappled Flanders mares,” w hich she sees in perspective, than by any idea that virtue is its own reward.</p><p>Least of all, is it possible to relish <hi rend="italic">Sir ChαrlesGrαndison, </hi>a work written upon an entirely wrong plan ; a system of pedantic morality put in action in the person of a formal, bowing, moralizing hero, “ content to dwell in decencies for ever;” a hero whose worst trial, as Sir Walter Scott observes, is the embarrassment of choosing between two females, both handsome, accomplished, and in love with him ; a gentleman who detests the theory of duelling on Christian principles, but reconciles the practice of it to his conscience, because his skill in swordsmanship always en-</p><lb/><p>@@@<hi rend="sup">1</hi>  Richardson’s<hi rend="italic">Life and Correspondence,</hi>  vol. i, Introduction.</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
