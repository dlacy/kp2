<p><span class="font1">in 1271, and fairs were held on Easter Monday, on August 26 and November 8. The market now held on Thursday, formerly&nbsp;on Saturday, dates from 1272. Every alternate Thursday is&nbsp;a great market. In medieval times Romsey had a considerable&nbsp;share of the woollen trade of Hampshire, but by the end of the&nbsp;17th century this manufacture began to decline, and the introduction of machinery and the adoption of steam led to its&nbsp;subsequent transference to the northern coal centres. The&nbsp;clothing trade was replaced by the manufacture of paper, an&nbsp;industry which still exists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROMULUS, the legendary eponymous founder and first king (753-716?) of Rome, represented as the son of Mars by the&nbsp;Vestal Rhea Silvia or Ilia, daughter of Numitor, who had been&nbsp;dispossessed of the throne of Alba by his younger brother&nbsp;Amulius. Romulus and Remus, the twin sons of Silvia, were&nbsp;placed in a trough and cast into the Tiber by their granduncle.&nbsp;The trough grounded in the marshes where Rome afterwards&nbsp;stood, under the wild fig tree </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(ficus ruminalis},</span><span class="font1"> which was still&nbsp;holy in later days. The babes were suckled by a she-wolf and&nbsp;fed by a woodpecker, and then fostered by Acca Larentia, wife&nbsp;of the shepherd Faustulus. They became leaders of a warlike&nbsp;band of shepherds on the Palatine, and in course of time were&nbsp;recognized by their grandfather, whom they restored to his&nbsp;throne, slaying the usurper Amulius. They now proposed to&nbsp;found a city on the site where they had been nurtured; but à&nbsp;quarrel for precedence broke out and Remus was slain. Romulus&nbsp;strengthened his band by offering an “ asylum ” to outcasts&nbsp;and fugitives, found wives for them by capture and waged war&nbsp;with their kinsmen. His most formidable foe was Titus Tatius&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.),</span><span class="font1"> king of the Sabines, but after an obstinate struggle he&nbsp;and Romulus united their forces and reigned side by side till&nbsp;Tatius was slain at Lavinium in the course of a blood-feud with&nbsp;Laurentum. Romulus then reigned alone till he suddenly&nbsp;disappeared in a storm. He was thereafter worshipped as a&nbsp;god under the name of Quirinus, which, however, is really a&nbsp;Sabine form of Mars. The story of Romulus, best preserved&nbsp;in the first book of Livy (see also Dion. Halic. i. 75-ii. 56;&nbsp;Plutarch, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Romulus;</span><span class="font1"> Cicero, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">de Republica,</span><span class="font1"> ii. 2-10), belongs&nbsp;throughout to legend. This was felt in later times by the&nbsp;Romans themselves, who gave a rationalistic explanation of&nbsp;the miraculous incidents. Thus, Mars was converted into a&nbsp;stranger disguised as the god of war, and the she-wolf into a&nbsp;woman of ill-fame </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(lupa};</span><span class="font1"> Romulus was not taken up into&nbsp;heaven, but put to death and carried away piecemeal by the&nbsp;patricians under their cloaks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The whole story, probably first given by the annalists Fabius Pictor and Cincius Alimentus, contains religious and aetiological&nbsp;elements. The foundation of the city by twins may be explained by the worship of the Lares, who are generally represented&nbsp;as a pair of brothers, especially as thè mother of Romulus and&nbsp;Remus was connected with the worship of the hearth of the&nbsp;state. The introduction of the wolf may be of Greek or eastern&nbsp;origin; it may have a totemistic significance; or may be due&nbsp;to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ficus ruminalis,</span><span class="font1"> the fig tree near the Lupercal on the&nbsp;Palatine, where the twins were first exposed. This tree was&nbsp;sacred to a goddess Rumina (rm, “ breast,” whence the&nbsp;suckling incident), ^nd the resemblance between Romulus and&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ruminalis</span><span class="font1"> led to the fig tree and the founder of the city being&nbsp;subsequently connected by the Roman antiquarians. The wolf&nbsp;would then be suggested by the proximity of the Lupercal, the&nbsp;grotto of Faunus Lupercus, with whom the shepherd Faustulus is&nbsp;identical. According to Professor Ducati of Bologna, in a paper&nbsp;on an old Etruscan stele, on which a she-wolf is represented&nbsp;suckling a child, the wolf legend is an importation from Etruria,&nbsp;the original home of which was Crete. Miletus, son of Apollo&nbsp;and a daughter of Minos, having been exposed by his mother,&nbsp;was suckled by she-wolves, being afterwards found and brought&nbsp;up by shepherds. To escape the designs of Minos, Miletus&nbsp;fled to Asia Minor, and founded the city called after him, where&nbsp;the Etruscans first became acquainted with the legend. The&nbsp;opening of the “ asylum ” is a Greek addition (as the name itself&nbsp;suggests). Down to imperial times, the Romans seem to have&nbsp;been ignorant of the Greek custom of taking sanctuary; further,&nbsp;the idea was entirely opposed to the exclusive spirit of the ancient&nbsp;Italians. The story was probably invented to give an explanation of the sacred spot named “ Inter duos lucos ” between the&nbsp;arx and the Capitol. Another Greek touch is the deification&nbsp;of an eponymous hero. The rape of the Sabine women is clearly&nbsp;aetiological, invented to account for the custom of marriage by&nbsp;capture. Consus, at whose festival the rape took place, was a&nbsp;god of the earth and crops, the giver of fruitfulness in plants&nbsp;and animals. It is generally agreed that the capture of the&nbsp;Capitol by Titus Tatius may contain an historical element,&nbsp;pointing to an early conquest of Rome by the Sabines, of which&nbsp;there are some indications. Subsequently, to efface the recollection of an event so distasteful to Roman vanity and national&nbsp;pride, Sabine names and customs were accounted for by a&nbsp;supposed union of Romans and Sabines during the regal period,&nbsp;the result of a friendly league concluded between Romulus and&nbsp;Tatius. According to E. Pais, Romulus is merely the eponym&nbsp;of Roma; his fife is nothing but the course of the sun, and the&nbsp;institutions ascribed to him are the result of long historical&nbsp;development.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Romulus, like his double Tullus Hostilius, is regarded as the founder of the military and political (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rome),</span><span class="font1"> as Numa&nbsp;and his counterpart Ancus Marcius of the religious institutions&nbsp;of Rome.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RONCESVALLES (Fr. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Roncevaux),</span><span class="font1"> <sup>a</sup> village of northern Spain, in the province of Navarre; situated on the small river&nbsp;Urrobi, at an altitude of 3220 ft. among the Pyrenees, and&nbsp;within 5 m. from the French frontier. Pop. (1900) 152.&nbsp;Roncesvalles is famous in history and legend for the defeat of&nbsp;Charlemagne and the death of Roland </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.)</span><span class="font1"> in 778. The small&nbsp;collegiate church contains several curious relics associated with&nbsp;Roland, and is a favourite place of pilgrimage. The battle is&nbsp;said to have been fought in the picturesque valley known&nbsp;as Val Carlos, which is now occupied by a hamlet bearing the&nbsp;same name, and in the adjoining defile of Ibaneta. Both of&nbsp;these are traversed by the main road leading north from&nbsp;Roncesvalles to St Jean Pied de Port, in France.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RONCONI, GIORGIO (1810-1890), Italian baritone vocalist, was born in 1810. He learnt singing from his father&nbsp;Domenico, who had been a celebrated tenor in bis time, and&nbsp;made his début in 1831 at Pavia. After singing in Italy for&nbsp;some years with ever-growing success, he appeared for the&nbsp;first time in England, in 1842, as Henry Ashton in&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lucia di Lammermoor.</span><span class="font1"> His success was immediate, and he&nbsp;continued to be one of the most popular artists on the lyric&nbsp;stage until his retirement in 1866. His voice was neither&nbsp;extensive in compass nor fine in quality, but the genius of his&nbsp;acting and the strength of his personality fully atoned for his&nbsp;vocal defects. He was equally at home in comedy and tragedy,&nbsp;and the two parts by which he is best remembered, Rigoletto and&nbsp;Figaro, show conclusively the range of his talent. In his later&nbsp;years Ronconi founded a school of singing at Granada, and he&nbsp;also accepted the post of professor of singing at the Madrid&nbsp;Conservatoire. He died in 1890.</span></p>

Ronda is built on a high rock nearly&nbsp;surrounded by the Guadiaro, which flows through an abrupt&nbsp;chasm 530 ft. deep and 300 ft. wide, by which the old town&nbsp;is separated from the new. Of the three bridges, one is said&nbsp;to have been built by the Romans, another by the Moors; the&nbsp;most modern (1761) spans the stream in a single arch at a&nbsp;height of about 255 ft.
