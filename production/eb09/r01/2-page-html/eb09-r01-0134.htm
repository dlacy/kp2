<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Oldcastle, its chief leader, although he suffered martyrdom, altogether failed to win the popularity or the reverence&nbsp;which waited on the memories of the two Hussite leaders.&nbsp;The religious tenets of his followers were not, indeed, altogether suppressed, and continued to command a certain following down to the 16th century. As a tradition, however,&nbsp;they would seem to have survived in connexion with the&nbsp;early English Puritanism rather than with the Reformation;&nbsp;while between the Hussite movement and the Reformation&nbsp;the connexion is unquestionable and was recognized by&nbsp;Luther himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> During the very time that the Roman pontiffs were</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">׳· wielding thus effectually the weapons of bigotry and persecution against all manifestations of independent religious thought, their influence and patronage were largely given&nbsp;to the fostering of other influences, which ultimately proved&nbsp;highly favourable to that very freedom of judgment and of&nbsp;philosophic speculation which the Roman see has invariably&nbsp;sought to suppress. The relations in which the “New&nbsp;Learning,” as it was then called, is to be found successively&nbsp;standing to the representatives of orthodox belief constitute&nbsp;an interesting and instructive study. At one time Greek&nbsp;had been held in reverence as the official language of the&nbsp;Roman Church; but, from the period when the popes&nbsp;were first enabled to shake off the yoke of the Eastern&nbsp;emperor in Italy, the use of the Greek language had been&nbsp;discontinued, its literature placed under a ban, and the&nbsp;study of both systematically discouraged in Western Christendom. Then came the Renaissance; and under the&nbsp;patronage of pontiffs like Nicholas Y. (1447-1455), and&nbsp;cardinals like Julian and Bessarion, Greek became as much&nbsp;in favour at the Curia as it had before been discredited.&nbsp;At first it seemed not improbable that this literary revolution might prove a powerful aid not only in promoting Christian culture but in diffusing a more genuinely&nbsp;Christian and catholic spirit. While eminent ecclesiastics&nbsp;sought to bring about the reconciliation of the churches&nbsp;of the East and West, original thinkers like Pius II. and&nbsp;Maffeus Vegius put forth views on the whole subject of&nbsp;education which involved a decisive rupture with the&nbsp;traditions of mediaevalism. It is unnecessary to describe&nbsp;the manner in which this promising future became overclouded ; how learning in Italy became associated at once&nbsp;with scepticism and immorality; and how men of letters like&nbsp;Politian and Poggio and Bembo and Beccadelli, under the&nbsp;favour of pontiffs like Leo X., at once scandalized the&nbsp;devout and amused the fancy of the polite scholar. “ This&nbsp;fable of Christ has been to us a source of great gain,” a&nbsp;cardinal at the Vatican was overheard to observe. Such&nbsp;a tone of feeling, however, was not consonant with the&nbsp;spirit of the persecutor, and if the religions spirit was&nbsp;shocked by profanity it was less disgraced by bigotry.&nbsp;Earnestness of conviction was derided and disbelieved in;&nbsp;and the prevalent sentiments at the Curia at the outbreak&nbsp;of the Reformation were those of idle and careless security.&nbsp;Signs, however, were not wanting to provo to a later&nbsp;generation how little that false security was justifiable.&nbsp;Foremost among those who advocated reform and a policy&nbsp;of reconciliation in the first half of the 15th century was&nbsp;Nicolas de Cusa, who, though German by birth, embraced&nbsp;with ardour the schemes projected for the regeneration of&nbsp;Italy and of the church at large. Neither Pius II. nor&nbsp;Nicholas V., who alike promoted him a,nd honoured him,&nbsp;appears to have discerned the dangerous element that&nbsp;lurked in his bold spirit of inquiry. From Cusa, however,&nbsp;Laurentius Valla derived the guidance which led him on&nbsp;to his memorable attack on the fiction of the Donation of&nbsp;Constantine, and to that more general investigation of the&nbsp;claims of the popedom which marks the commencement&nbsp;of the historical scepticism which now began to develop&nbsp;with such startling results. To Valla succeeded Gregory&nbsp;of Heimburg, who exposed the papal pretensions with&nbsp;equal vigour, and made it for the first time apparent&nbsp;how formidable a weapon the New Learning might prove&nbsp;in the defence of those imperial and popular rights in&nbsp;Germany which Rome at that time contemptuously ignored. The conflict between Heimburg and Eugenius&nbsp;IV. foreshadowed, indeed, the greater contest between the&nbsp;Teutonic and the Latin power, and Heimburg has more&nbsp;than once been designated the prototype of Ulrich von&nbsp;Hutten.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">In the whole history of the Reformation, and of the period by which it was immediately preceded, the political&nbsp;relations of the popedom to the other European powers&nbsp;and more especially to Germany, constitute, in fact,&nbsp;elements of primary importance. In the latter part of&nbsp;the 15th century those relations were still further embittered by the personal character and aims of the reigning&nbsp;pontiffs. At the very time when the existence of the&nbsp;popedom as a temporal power was menaced by the rising&nbsp;spirit of innovation, the reverence and sympathy of Europe&nbsp;were still further alienated by the spectacle of the career of&nbsp;Alexander VI. and of his end,—the result, it was commonly&nbsp;reported, of the poison which he had designed for the destruction of another. The character of his successor, Julius&nbsp;II. (1503-1513), might well seem virtuous by comparison;&nbsp;but at no period in the history of the pontificate does its&nbsp;religious character seem more completely lost sight of in&nbsp;purely secular interests. It had long before (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Popedom)&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">been the aim of each more ambitious pope to become a&nbsp;great territorial prince and thus to lay the foundation of&nbsp;the private fortunes of his house. But Julius aimed at&nbsp;something more than this,—at the assertion of political&nbsp;supremacy throughout Italy and of the right to rank with&nbsp;the great powers of Europe as wielding at once material&nbsp;resources but little inferior to theirs, and as commanding a&nbsp;widespread organization to the like of which not one of&nbsp;them could aspire. Such were the objects to which his&nbsp;untiring energies were systematically directed. Within&nbsp;four years of his accession he had added Perugia and&nbsp;Bologna to the possessions of the church, and from&nbsp;Piacenza to Terracina his sway extended over all the&nbsp;great strongholds and the most fertile territory; even&nbsp;the great powers of France and Spain, notwithstanding&nbsp;their newly consolidated strength, could not but regard&nbsp;with jealousy and apprehension his genius and his policy.&nbsp;“Before,” wrote Machiavelli, “there was no baron so&nbsp;petty as not to look with contempt on that popedom which&nbsp;now even a king of France regards with respect.” The&nbsp;means by which this remarkable change was effected&nbsp;involved, however, a recourse to fiscal expedients which&nbsp;eventually proved eminently detrimental to the Roman&nbsp;see;@@<sup>1</sup> while for nearly a quarter of a century we find the&nbsp;policy of the great powers in relation to Rome almost&nbsp;entirely determined by purely political considerations and&nbsp;Italy itself becoming the arena of their contending ambitions. In the year 1494 Charles VIII. of France effected&nbsp;his memorable passage of the Alps to grasp the crown&nbsp;of Naples. It was currently believed that he had been&nbsp;incited to the enterprise by Alexander VI. himself,—a circumstance which alone suffices to explain the failure which&nbsp;attended that pontiff’s efforts when he subsequently sought&nbsp;to prevail upon the invader to submit his claims to the&nbsp;arbitration of the holy see. In the year 1508 the invasion</span></p>
