<p><span class="font1">The civil government is in the hands of the College of Cardinals, and the executive is administered by the Cardinal Vicarius, who is a kind of prime minister. It has&nbsp;been defined to be “ a government administered by&nbsp;monks, who conduct the affairs of a nation by the rules of&nbsp;a convent, and apply the maxims of the twelfth century to&nbsp;the business of the nineteenth ;” and the apathy and timidity, the dread of independent thinking and of free inquiry&nbsp;which it manifests, fully justify the statement. Such is the&nbsp;dread of innovation, that even vaccination is not permitted&nbsp;in Rome. The press is held in rigid durance, and all the&nbsp;best works on mental philosophy are prohibited. As might&nbsp;have been expected, these restrictions have proved in the&nbsp;highest degree injurious to the prosperity of literature. The&nbsp;state of science in Rome is still less flourishing, for it has&nbsp;been the constant policy of the papal government from the&nbsp;days of Galileo to the present time, to discourage as much&nbsp;as possible the research after truth. Rome, therefore, has&nbsp;not one eminent man of science ; there are very few who&nbsp;take even any interest in the matter; nor is there a single&nbsp;museum of natural history, public or private, worth notice.&nbsp;The constitution of society, too, is so framed as to hold&nbsp;every man in the situation in which he is bom. However&nbsp;meritorious or enterprising he may be, he can scarcely&nbsp;ever expect by his own personal exertion to raise himself&nbsp;to a higher station, for there are barriers he can never pass.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The clergy constitute the nobility of Rome ; they form the court of the sovereign, and fill all civil offices as well&nbsp;as ecclesiastical. The persons styled Roman princes are&nbsp;few in number, and, with two or three exceptions, very&nbsp;poor, and totally destitute of power or authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The inhabitants of the papal states, with very few exceptions, profess the Romish faith. According to the official returns the number of Jews in Rome is 3700; of heretics and Turks, 201. The Jews are compelled to reside in one&nbsp;particular quarter of the city. There is now a Protestant&nbsp;place of worship in Rome, in which an English clergyman&nbsp;regularly officiates, but this is rather connived at than&nbsp;openly tolerated. Of late years there has been a considerable increase in the number of the clergy. In 1825 they&nbsp;amounted to 4938 ; in 1835, to 5273. According to the&nbsp;official statement, there were, in 1836, 37 bishops, 1468&nbsp;priests, 2023 monks, 1384 nuns, and in houses of education, 698. There is thus in Rome one clergyman for every&nbsp;ten families ; but it is supposed that the real number considerably exceeds the official return. The state of morals,&nbsp;both among clergy and laity, is far from satisfactory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The absence of statistical accounts makes it impossible to state what is the number of children in the schools of the Roman territory. According to the calculation of&nbsp;the government, it is about 1 in 50 of the population. A&nbsp;bull was issued on this subject by Pope Leo XII., which was&nbsp;followed by a “ Reglamento degli Studj,” erecting a board&nbsp;intended to have the general direction of the business of&nbsp;education, the control of all universities and schools, and&nbsp;consists of certain cardinals in official stations, and others,&nbsp;to be nominated by the pope. It established two primary&nbsp;universities, Rome and Bologna, and six secondary universities. The universities have four faculties, theology, law,&nbsp;medico-surgery, and philosophy. But of this Reglamento&nbsp;only a very small portion refers to public schools. They&nbsp;are placed almost entirely under the control of the bishop.&nbsp;The teachers are elected by the communal council, but the&nbsp;bishop must confirm the nomination, and he possesses a&nbsp;perpetual power of dismissal without reference to the local&nbsp;authorities. But the business of education is almost universally neglected. The elementary schools in Rome are&nbsp;872 ; the number of masters, 482, and of scholars, 14,099 ;&nbsp;that is to say, in the infant schools, 4800; in the gratuitous&nbsp;elementary schools for boys, 2694 ; for girls, 287 ; in the&nbsp;schools where a small sum is paid for instruction, 2115 boys,&nbsp;and 1600 girls. Many parts of Rome, however, as Trasta-vere and the Borgo, are very ill supplied. Rome contains&nbsp;four ecclesiastical boarding-schools, two seminaries, seven&nbsp;ecclesiastical colleges, five secular colleges, two universities, nine gratuitous parish schools, and sixty regionary ;&nbsp;seven schools kept by monks, one for the deaf and dumb,&nbsp;five pious places of education for males, and fourteen for females.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Two banks for savings have lately been established, one in Rome, the other in Spoleto ; that of Rome has been&nbsp;very successful, and in six months has received 50,000&nbsp;crowns in deposits. The Monte di Pietà of Rome has existed for nearly three centuries. It has passed through&nbsp;many vicissitudes, and has now a circulating capital of about&nbsp;230,000 crowns advanced on about 200,000 pledges. It is&nbsp;proposed to associate this establishment with the savings&nbsp;bank, which is now attached to the lottery office.</span></p><div>
