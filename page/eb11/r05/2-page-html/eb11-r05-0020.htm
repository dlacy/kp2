<p><span class="font0">domestic establishment. His mistress, whom towards the close of his life he married after a fashion, was Thérèse le Vasseur, a&nbsp;servant at the inn, whom he first met in 1743· She had little&nbsp;beauty, no education or understanding, and few charms that&nbsp;his friends could discover, besides which she had a detestable&nbsp;mother, who was the bane of Rousseau’s life. But he made&nbsp;himself happy with her, and (according to Rousseau’s account,&nbsp;the accuracy of which has been questioned) five children were&nbsp;born to them, who were all consigned to the foundling hospital.&nbsp;This disregard of responsibility was partly punished by the use&nbsp;his critics made of it when he became celebrated as a writer on&nbsp;education and a preacher of the domestic affections.<sup>1</sup> Diderot,&nbsp;with whom from 1741 onwards he became more and more&nbsp;familiar, admitted him as a contributor to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopédie.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">Hc formed new musical projects, and he was introduced by&nbsp;degrees to many people of rank and influence, among them&nbsp;Madame d’Épinay </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.),</span><span class="font0"> to whom in 1747 he was introduced&nbsp;by her lover M. de Francueil. It was not, however, till 1749&nbsp;that Rousseau made his mark as a writer. The academy of&nbsp;Dijon offered a prize for an essay on the effect of the progress&nbsp;of civilization on morals. Rousseau took up the subject,&nbsp;developed his famous paradox of the superiority of the savage&nbsp;state, won the prize, and, publishing his essay (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Discours sur les&nbsp;arts el sciences)</span><span class="font0"> next year, became famous. The anecdotage as&nbsp;to the origin of this famous essay is voluminous. It is agreed&nbsp;that the idea was suggested when Rousseau went to pay a visit&nbsp;to Diderot, who was in prison at Vincennes for his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lettre sur les&nbsp;aveugles.</span><span class="font0"> Rousseau says he thought of the paradox on his&nbsp;way down; Morellet and others say that he thought of treating&nbsp;the subject in the ordinary fashion and was laughed at by&nbsp;Diderot, who showed him the advantages of the less obvious&nbsp;treatment. Diderot himself, who in such matters is almost&nbsp;absolutely trustworthy, does not claim the suggestion, but&nbsp;uses words which imply that it Avas at least partly his. It is&nbsp;very like him. The essay, however, took the artificial and&nbsp;crotchety society of the day by storm. Francueil gave Rousseau&nbsp;a valuable post as cashier in the receiver-general’s office. But&nbsp;he resigned it either from conscientiousness, or crotchet, or nervousness at responsibility, or indolence, or more probably from a&nbsp;mixture of all four. He went back to his music-copying, but&nbsp;the salons of the day were determined to have his society, and&nbsp;for a time they had it. In 1752 he brought out at Fontainebleau&nbsp;an operetta, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Devin du village,</span><span class="font0"> which was successful. He&nbsp;received a hundred louis for it, and he was ordered to come to&nbsp;court next day. This meant the certainty of a pension. But&nbsp;Rousseau’s shyness or his perversity (as before, probably both)&nbsp;made him disobey the command. His comedy </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Narcisse,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">written long before, was also acted, but unsuccessfully. In the&nbsp;same year, however, a letter </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sur la musique française</span><span class="font0"> again&nbsp;had a great vogue.<sup>2</sup> Finally, for this was an important year</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">with him, the Dijon academy, which had founded his fame, announced the subject of “ The Origin of Inequality,” on which&nbsp;he wrote a discourse which was unsuccessful, but at least equal&nbsp;to the former in merit. During a visit to Geneva in 1754&nbsp;Rousseau saw his old friend and love Madame de Warens (now&nbsp;reduced in circumstances and having lost all her charms), while&nbsp;after abjuring his abjuration of Protestantism he was enabled&nbsp;to take up his freedom as citizen of Geneva, to which his birth&nbsp;entitled him and of which he was proud. Shortly afterwards,&nbsp;returning to Paris, he accepted a cottage near Montmorency&nbsp;(the celebrated Hermitage) which Madame d’Épinay had fitted&nbsp;up for him, and established himself there in April 1756. He&nbsp;spent little more than a year there, but it was an important year.&nbsp;Here he wrote </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">La Nouvelle Héloïse,</span><span class="font0"> here he indulged in the&nbsp;passion which that novel partly represents, his love for Madame&nbsp;d’Huodetot, sister-in-law of Sladame d’Épinay, a lady young&nbsp;and amiable, but plain, who had a husband and a lover (St&nbsp;Lambert), and whom Rousseau’s devotion seems to have&nbsp;partly pleased and partly annoyed. Here too arose the obscure&nbsp;triangular quarrel between Diderot, Rousseau and Frederick&nbsp;Melchior Grimm, which ended Rousseau’s sojourn at the Hermitage. The supposition least favourable to Rousseau is that it&nbsp;was due to one of his numerous fits of half-insane petulance&nbsp;and indignation at the obligations which he was nevertheless&nbsp;always ready to incur. That most favourable to him is that he&nbsp;was expected to lend himself in a more or less complaisant&nbsp;manner to assist and cover Madame d’Épinay’s adulterous&nbsp;affection for Grimm. At any rate, Rousseau quitted the Hermitage in the winter of 1757-58, and established himself at&nbsp;Montlouis in the neighbourhood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Hitherto Rousseau’s behaviour had frequently made him enemies, but his writings had for the most part made * him&nbsp;friends. The quarrel with Madame d’Épinay, with Diderot,&nbsp;and through them with the philosophe party reversed this.&nbsp;In 1758 appeared his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lettre à</span><span class="font0"> </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">d’</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Alembert contre les spectacles,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">written in the winter of the previous year at Montlouis. This&nbsp;was at once an attack on Voltaire, who was giving theatrical&nbsp;representations at Les Délices, on D’Alembert, who had condemned the prejudice against the stage in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopédie,</span><span class="font0"> and&nbsp;on one of the favourite amusements of the society of the day.&nbsp;Voltaire’s strong point was not forgiveness, and, though&nbsp;Rousseau no doubt exaggerated the efforts of his “ enemies,”&nbsp;he was certainly henceforward as obnoxious to the philosophe&nbsp;coterie as to the orthodox party. He still, however, had no&nbsp;lack of patrons—he never had—though his perversity made&nbsp;him quarrel with all in turn. The amiable duke and duchess of&nbsp;Luxembourg, who were his neighbours at Montlouis, made his&nbsp;acquaintance, or rather forced theirs upon him, and he was&nbsp;industrious in his literary work—indeed, most of his best&nbsp;books were produced during his stay in the neighbourhood of</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>1</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the fact that there were probably no children at all,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">the whole bearing of the belief of Rousseau that they were sent by him to the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Enfants trouvés</span><span class="font0"> has been falsified by hostile writers. He&nbsp;was a penniless man of letters, with theories as to state maintenance&nbsp;of children; and Thérèse was a consenting party. Rousseau,&nbsp;however, never saw any of the alleged children; and Mrs Macdonald has shown good cause for believing that their existence was&nbsp;a myth, an imposition on Rousseau’s credulity, invented by Thérèse&nbsp;and her mother to make the tie more binding.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(H. Ch.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>2</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rousseau’s influence on French music was greater than might&nbsp;have been expected from his very imperfect education; in truth, he&nbsp;was a musician by natural instinct only, but his feeling for art was&nbsp;very strong, and, though capricious, based upon true perceptions of&nbsp;the good and beautiful. The system of notation (by figures) concerning which he read a paper before the Académie des Sciences,&nbsp;August 22, 1742, was ingenious, but practically worse than useless,&nbsp;ana failed to attract attention, though the paper was published in&nbsp;1743 under the title of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dissertation sur la musique moderne.</span><span class="font0"> In the&nbsp;famous “ guerre des buffons,” he took the part of the “ buffonists,”&nbsp;so named in consequence of their attachment to the Italian “ opera&nbsp;buffa,” as opposed to the true French opera; and, in his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lettre sur la&nbsp;musique française,</span><span class="font0"> published in 1753, he indulged in a violent tirade&nbsp;against French music, which he declared to be so contemptible as to&nbsp;lead to the conclusion ‘‘ that the French neither have, nor ever will&nbsp;have, any. music of their own, or at least that, if they ever do have&nbsp;any, it will be so much the worse for them.” This silly libel so&nbsp;enraged the performers at the Opera that they hanged and burned</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">its author in effigy. Rousseau revenged himself by printing his clever satire entitled </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lettre d’un symphoniste de l’Académie Royale de&nbsp;Musique à ses camarades de l’orchestre.</span><span class="font0"> His </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lettre à M. Burney</span><span class="font0"> is of&nbsp;a very different type, and does full justice to the genius of Gluck.&nbsp;His articles on music in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopédie</span><span class="font0"> deal very superficially with&nbsp;the subject; and his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dictionnaire de musique</span><span class="font0"> (Geneva, 1767), though&nbsp;admirably written, is not trustworthy, either as a record of facts or as&nbsp;a.collection of critical essays. In all these works the imperfection of&nbsp;his musical education is painfully apparent, and his compositions&nbsp;betray an equal lack of knowledge, though his refined taste is as&nbsp;clearly displayed there as is his literary power in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Letters</span><span class="font0"> and&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dictionary.</span><span class="font0"> His first opera, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Les Muses galantes,</span><span class="font0"> privately prepared&nbsp;at the house of La Popelinière, attracted very little attention; but </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Le&nbsp;Devin du village,</span><span class="font0"> given at Fontainebleau in 1752, and at the Académie&nbsp;in 1753, achieved a great and well-deserved success. Though very&nbsp;unequal., and exceedingly simple both in style and construction,&nbsp;it contains some charming melodies, and is written throughout in the&nbsp;most refined taste. His </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pygmalion</span><span class="font0"> (1775) is a melodrama without&nbsp;singing. Some posthumous fragments of another opera, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Daphnis&nbsp;et Chloê,</span><span class="font0"> were printed in 1780; and in 1781 appeared </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Les Consolations des misères de ma vie,</span><span class="font0"> a collection of about one hundred songs&nbsp;and other fugitive pieces of very unequal merit. The popular.air&nbsp;known as “ Rousseau’s Dream ” is not contained in this collection,&nbsp;and cannot be traced back farther than J. B. Cramer’s celebrated&nbsp;“ Variations.” M. Castil-Blaze has accused Rousseau of extensive&nbsp;plagiarisms (or worse) in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Le Devin du village</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pygmalion,</span><span class="font0"> but&nbsp;apparently without sufficient cause.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(W. S. R.)</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
