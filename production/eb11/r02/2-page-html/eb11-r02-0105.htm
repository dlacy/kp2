Ribs single-headed. No abdominal ribs.&nbsp;Sternum present when there are limbs. Limbs, when present, only&nbsp;for progression; third and fourth digits at least with more than&nbsp;three phalanges.

<p><span class="font2">Order i. </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Anomodontia.</span><span class="font2">—The Anomodonts are so named in allusion to the peculiar and unique dentition of the first-discovered genera. They are precisely intermediate between the</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Labyrinthodont Batrachia and the lowest or Monotreme Mammalia. They flourished at the period when the former are&nbsp;known to have reached their culmination, and when the latter&nbsp;almost certainly began to appear. Many of them would, indeed,&nbsp;be regarded as primitive Mammalia, if they did not retain a&nbsp;pineal foramen, a free quadrate bone, and a complex mandible.&nbsp;The term Theromorpha or Theromora is thus sometimes applied&nbsp;to the order they represent. So far as known, they are all&nbsp;land-reptiles, with limbs adapted for habitual support of the&nbsp;body, and their feet are essentially identical with those of&nbsp;primitive mammals. Most of them are small, and none attain a&nbsp;gigantic size. They first appear in the Permian of Europe and&nbsp;North America, and also occur in the Triassic both of Europe</span></p><div style="border-left:solid;">
<p><span class="font2">and India, but they are best represented in the Karoo formation (Permian and Triassic) of South Africa. The Pariasauria most&nbsp;closely resemble the Labyrinthodont Amphibia, but have a single&nbsp;occipital condyle. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pariasauria</span><span class="font2"> itself is a massive herbivorous&nbsp;reptile, with a short tail, and the limbs adapted for excavating&nbsp;in the ground. It is known by several nearly complete skeletons,&nbsp;about 3 metres in length, from South Africa and northern&nbsp;Russia. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Elginia,</span><span class="font2"> found in the Elgin sandstones of Morayshire,&nbsp;Scotland, is provided with horn-Iike bony bosses on the skull.&nbsp;Another apparently allied genus </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Otocoelus)</span><span class="font2"> has a carapace&nbsp;suggesting that it may bc an ancestral Chelonian.

<p><span class="font2">dontia exhibit the marginal teeth differentiated (in shape) into incisors,'canines and molars (fig. 3). They have two occipital&nbsp;condyles, as in mammals. They seem to have been all carnivorous, or at least insect! /orous, but the malariform teeth vary&nbsp;much in shape in the different genera. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Cynognathus</span><span class="font2"> (fig. 3) and&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Lycosaurus</span><span class="font2"> have cutting teeth, while </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tritylodon</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Gompho-gnathus</span><span class="font2"> possess powerful grinders. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Dicynodontia</span><span class="font2"> have one&nbsp;pair of upper tusks or are toothless: their occipital condyle is&nbsp;trefoil-shaped, as in Chelonia. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Dicynodon</span><span class="font2"> itself occurs in the&nbsp;Karoo formation of S.
