<p><span class="font2">Total load passing on the way &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1518413</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the above, we have allowed coach room for 64 passengers per trip, and have taken the weight of a first-class train at 21 tons, and a second class at 12∙6 tons ; the&nbsp;relative numbers of each being at the time we speak of, 13 to</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">We now require the ratio of expenditure for passengers and goods, for locomotive power and maintenance of the way.&nbsp;This has generally been taken in proportion to the number&nbsp;of trips with each, which is clearly wrong. Both the weight&nbsp;and the velocity are evidently functions of the expenditure,&nbsp;taking the drawn weight in estimating the cost of the power&nbsp;and the passing weight for that of the way ; and as the cost&nbsp;of passengers and that of goods is not separated, which indeed could hardly be done for the way, we have no guide,&nbsp;and can only make an approximation, by taking the cost&nbsp;directly as the weight and velocity. We have then</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">For locomotive power</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">23324242-15 : 11516928.25 or 349863630 :287923200, or as 1∙215 to 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This gives us in money,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Goods..........'................L.37054.5</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Passengers..................... 30497.5</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ToUl..................L.67552</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A similar result drawn from the number of trips only, would give for the goods, L.28710, and the passengers&nbsp;L.38842, which is clearly inadmissible ; unless we are prepared&nbsp;to say that the locomotive power is used in a most disadvantageous manner, of which we have no evidence. Hence,&nbsp;if we multiply the number of passengers by 0∙353585, or,&nbsp;which will be sufficiently accurate, by O-3536, it will give&nbsp;us the total weight drawn in trains, averaging as those did&nbsp;on the Liverpool and Manchester line at the time in question ; or, in other words, there are 2∙8282 passengers to a&nbsp;ton gross weight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In order to apportion the expense of mainuining the way between the goods and passengers, we have,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">For maintenance of the way,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">3267577815: 19709470-25 or 490136670:492736750, or as 1 : 1∙005.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This gives us in money such a small difference from equal proportions, that we may safely venture to place halt&nbsp;the expense on each ; always premising, as we have before&nbsp;explained, that the workmanship in the waggon springs,&nbsp;wheels, and axles, is to be considered as of the best description, without which the expense may be almost anything.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The result deduced from the number of trips would have given us the goods’ expense to the passengers, nearly as&nbsp;16 :22, an additional proof that this method is very erroneous. We are aware of the difficulties which envelope&nbsp;the whole question, especially in first working a railway,&nbsp;when the embankments settle down and render very expensive repairs necessary, without a single vehicle passing over&nbsp;the road, whilst the more it is used, the sooner it will get in&nbsp;perfect order. Nor are there any data to guide us correctly,&nbsp;as respects the effect of velocity ; but from an attentive&nbsp;consideration of the subject, combined with a comparison&nbsp;on many lines, we believe the foregoing method to be that&nbsp;which agrees best with practical results, and with this we&nbsp;must rest satisfied till more experimental knowledge is acquired.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">For the locomotive power, the cost of new engines and repairs must now be separated from that of the working&nbsp;expenditure in coke, oil, grease, waste, w-ages, &amp;c. We shall&nbsp;find this to stand as follows :</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Repairs, &amp;c...................................L.42376</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Working expenses.......................... 25176</span></p>
