<p><span class="font1">with no change of key except between tonic major and minor, as in Haydn’s famous </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Gipsy Rondo.</span><span class="font1"> Frequently the episodes&nbsp;are increased in number or made to recur. Beethoven most&nbsp;clearly shows the influence of Haydn in his frequent use of&nbsp;modifications of this type of rondo in his earlier works, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">finales of Sonatas, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Op.</span><span class="font1"> io, No. 3, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Op.</span><span class="font1"> 14, Nos. 1 and 2. He also&nbsp;applied it very successfully to his early slow movements, as in&nbsp;the Sonatas, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Op.</span><span class="font1"> 2, No. 2, and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Op.</span><span class="font1"> 13 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Pathétique).</span><span class="font1"> The sectional&nbsp;rondo was modernized on a gigantic scale by Brahms in the&nbsp;finale of his G minor Pianoforte Quartet, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Op.</span><span class="font1"> 25; and Schumann’s&nbsp;favourite art-forms are various compounds between it and the&nbsp;cognate idea of the dance-tune with one or more “ trios,” as in&nbsp;the Novellettes, the Arabeske, and the Romance in B major.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(ii) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rondos influenced by the form of a first movement</span><span class="font1"> (for which see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sonata Forms).</span><span class="font1"> The normal scheme for this, which</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">B</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">is Mozart’s favourite rondo-form, is </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">A À AB A </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">coda, </span><span class="font1">C</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">and it is easy to see how it may be applied to sectional rondos, as in the finale of Beethoven’s Sonata, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Op.</span><span class="font1"> 13. But it&nbsp;normally implies longer and weightier themes and a higher&nbsp;degree of organization. If the second episode (C) is transformed&nbsp;into an elaborate development of previous material in various&nbsp;keys, the resemblance to first-movement form is increased; the&nbsp;only external difference being the recurrence of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span class="font1"> in full after&nbsp;the first episode </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">B</span><span class="font1"> (which is treated exactly like the “ second&nbsp;subject ” of a first movement). As, however, many first movements that do not repeat their exposition (corresponding to&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">A+B</span><span class="font1"> in the above rondo-scheme) make a feint of so doing&nbsp;before beginning the development, it is obvious that the blending of rondo and first-movement form may become very, complete. In fact, the true criterion of a rondo is, as with all real&nbsp;art-forms, a matter of style rather than of external shape. The&nbsp;well rounded-off, self-repeating, tune-like character of the main&nbsp;theme, and a sense of pleasure and importance in the mere fact&nbsp;of its return (without absolute necessity for dramatic effect)&nbsp;are the distinctive evidences of rondo form and style. This&nbsp;rule is well proved by the case most frequently cited as an&nbsp;exception, the rondo of Beethoven’s Sonata in D, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Op.</span><span class="font1"> 10, No. 3;&nbsp;for nothing can be more significant than the way in which its&nbsp;fragmentary opening figure is built up into a self-contained&nbsp;musical epigram and ended with a full close, as contrasted with&nbsp;the way in which the most tuneful of first-movement beginnings&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(e.g.</span><span class="font1"> Beethoven’s Quartet in F major, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Op.</span><span class="font1"> 59, No. 1, Trio in B&nbsp;flat, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Op.</span><span class="font1"> 97; Brahms’s String Quintet in F major, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Op. 88)&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">expand gradually into their further course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The following are some of the more important of many modifications and applications of this form:—</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(a)</span><span class="font1"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Omission of return of main theme before recapitulation of</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">B</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">episode—A A </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">development ,tn various keys,</span><span class="font1"> R A </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">coda</span><span class="font1">—as in Beethoven’s G major Concerto, where, however, much happens&nbsp;between the recapitulation of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">B</span><span class="font1"> and the following return of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">A,</span><span class="font1"> and&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">coda</span><span class="font1"> is nearly as long as all that has gone before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">B</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(b)</span><span class="font1"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A AB (A) like a first movement without a development.&nbsp;Here </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span class="font1"> will be very large and the transition to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">B</span><span class="font1"> important, while&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">B</span><span class="font1"> will consist of a considerable number of themes. See the finales&nbsp;of Mozart’s E flat String Quartet and C major Quintet, most of his&nbsp;greater slow movements, and many of Beethoven’s.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In concertos the only modifying influence the balance between solo and orchestra shows in rondo-form is in the tendency to give&nbsp;the orchestra a large number of subsidiary themes at the outset,&nbsp;which perhaps do not reappear until the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">coda,</span><span class="font1"> where, with the aid of&nbsp;the solo, they can round off the design very effectively. Mozart’s&nbsp;use of this device is not confined to concertos.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(D. F. T.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RONSARD, PIERRE DE (1524-1585), French poet and “ prince of poets ” (as his own generation in France called him),&nbsp;was born at the Château de la Poissonnière, near the village of</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Couture in the province of Vendômois (department of Loir-et-Cher), on the nth of September 1524. His family are said to have come from the Slav provinces to the south of the Danube&nbsp;(provinces with which the crusades had given France much&nbsp;intercourse) in the first half of the 14th century. Baudouin&nbsp;de Ronsard or Rossart was the founder of the French branch of&nbsp;the house, and made his mark in the early stages of the Hundred&nbsp;Years’ War. The poet’s father was named Loys, and his&nbsp;mother was Jeanne de Chaudrier, of a family not only noble in&nbsp;itself but well connected. Pierre was the youngest son. Loys&nbsp;de Ronsard was </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">maître d'hôtel du roi</span><span class="font1"> to Francis I., whose captivity&nbsp;after Pavia had just been softened by treaty, and he had to quit&nbsp;his home shortly after Pierre’s birth. The future Prince of Poets&nbsp;was educated at home for some years and sent to the Collège&nbsp;de Navarre at Paris when he was nine years old. It is said that&nbsp;the rough life of a medieval school did not suit him. He had,&nbsp;however, no long experience of it, being quickly appointed page,&nbsp;first to the king’s eldest son François, and then to his brother&nbsp;the duke of Orleans. When Madeleine of France was married&nbsp;to James V. of Scotland, Ronsard was attached to the king’s&nbsp;service, and he spent three years in Great Britain. The latter&nbsp;part of this time seems to have been passed in England, though&nbsp;he had, strictly speaking, no business there. On returning to&nbsp;France in 1540 he was again taken into the service of the duke&nbsp;of Orleans. In this service he had other opportunities of travel,&nbsp;being sent to Flanders and again to Scotland. After a time a&nbsp;more important employment fell to his lot, and he was attached&nbsp;as secretary to the suite of Lazare de Baïf, the father of his&nbsp;future colleague in the Pléiade and his fcompanion on this&nbsp;occasion, Antoine de Baïf, at the diet of Spires. Afterwards he&nbsp;was attached in the same way to the suite of the cardinal du&nbsp;Bellay-Langey, and his mythical quarrel with Rabelais dates&nbsp;mythically from this period. His apparently promising diplomatic career was, however, cut short by an attack of deafness&nbsp;which no physician could cure, and he determined to devote&nbsp;himself to study. The institution which he chose for the purpose among the numerous schools and colleges of Paris was the&nbsp;Collège Coqueret, the principal of which was Daurat—afterwards&nbsp;the “ dark star ” (as he has been called from his silence in&nbsp;French) of the Pléiade, and already an acquaintance of Ron-sard’s from his having held the office of tutor in the Baïf household. Antoine de Baïf, Daurat’s pupil, accompanied Ronsard;&nbsp;Belleau shortly followed; Joachim du Bellay, the second of&nbsp;the seven, joined not much later. Muretus (Jean Antoine de&nbsp;Muret), a great scholar and by means of his Latin plays a great&nbsp;influence in the creation of French tragedy, was also a student</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Ronsard’s period of study occupied seven years, and the first manifesto of the new literary movement, which was to apply&nbsp;to the vernacular the principles of criticism and scholarship&nbsp;learnt from the classics, ‘came not from him but from Du Bellay.&nbsp;The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Défense et illustration de la langue française</span><span class="font1"> of the latter&nbsp;appeared in 1549, and the Pléiade (or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Brigade, </span><span class="font1">as it was first&nbsp;called) may be said to have been then launched. It consisted,&nbsp;as its name implies, of seven writers whose names are sometimes differently enumerated, though the orthodox canon is&nbsp;beyond doubt composed of Ronsard, Du Bellay, Baïf, Belleau,&nbsp;Pontus de Tyard (a man of rank and position who had exemplified the principles of the friends earlier), Jodelle the dramatist,&nbsp;and Daurat. Ronsard’s own work came a little later, and a&nbsp;rather idle story is told of a trick of Du Bellay’s which at last&nbsp;determined him to publish. Some single and minor pieces, an&nbsp;epithalamium on Antoine de Bourbon and Jeanne de Navarre&nbsp;(1550), a “ Hymne de la France ” (1549), an “ Ode à la Paix,”&nbsp;preceded the publication in 1550 of the four first books (“ first ”&nbsp;is characteristic and noteworthy) of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Odes</span><span class="font1"> of Pierre de&nbsp;Ronsard. This was followed in 1552 by the publication of his&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Amours de Cassandre</span><span class="font1"> with the fifth book of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Odes.</span><span class="font1"> These books&nbsp;excited a violent literary quarrel. Marot was dead, but he&nbsp;left a numerous school, some of whom saw in the stricter&nbsp;literary critique of the Pléiade, in its outspoken contempt of&nbsp;merely vernacular and medieval forms, in its strenuous advice</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
