His father, Francis Peretti, was a gardener, and his mother a servant maid. He was their eldeſt child, and was called Felix. At the age of nine he was hired out to an inhabitant of the village to keep ſheep ; but diſobliging his maſter, he was ſoon after degraded to be keeper of the hogs. He was engaged in this employment when Father Michael Angelo Selleri, a Franciſcan friar, aſked the road to Aſcoli, where he was going to preach. Young Felix conducted him thither, and ſtruck the father ſo much with his converſation and eagerneſs for knowledge, that he recommended him to the fraternity to which he had come. Accordingly he was received among them, inveſted with the habit of a lay brother, and placed under the ſacriſtan, to aſſiſt in ſweeping the church, lighting the candles, and other offices of that nature ; for which he was to be taught the reſponſes, and the rudiments of grammar. His progreſs in learning was ſo ſurpriſing, that at the age of 14 he was thought qualified to be gin his noviciate, and was admitted the year following to make his profeſſion.</p><p>He purſued his ſtudies with ſuch unwearied aſſiduity, that he was ſoon reckoned equal to the beſt diſputants. He was ordained prieſt in 1545, when he aſſumed the name of Father Montalto ; ſoon after he took his doctor’s degree, and was appointed profeſſor of theology at Sienna. It was then that he ſo effectually recommended himſelf to Cardinal di Carpi, and his ſecretary Boſſius, that they ever remained his ſteady friends. Meanwhile the ſeverity and obſtinacy of his temper inceſſantly engaged him in diſputes with his monastic brethren. His reputation for eloquence, which was now ſpread over Italy, about this time gained him ſome new friends. Among theſe were the Colonna family, and Father Ghiſilieri, by whoſe recommendation he was appointed inquisitor-general at Venice ; but he exerciſed that office with ſo much ſeverity, that he was obliged to flee precipitately from that city. Upon this he went to Rome, where he was made procurator-general of his order, and ſoon after accompanied Cardinal Buon Compagnon into Spain, as a</p><p>chaplain and conſultor to the inquiſition. There hc was treated with great reſpect, and liberal offers were made him to induce him to continue in Spain, which, however, he could not be prevailed on to accept.</p><p>In the mean time, news were brought to Madrid that Pius IV. was dead, and that Father Ghiſilieri, who had been made Cardinal Alexandrino by Paul IV. had ſucceeded him under the name of Pius V. Theſe tidings filled Montalto with joy, and not without reaſon, for he was immediately inveſted by the pontiff with new dignities. He was made general of his order, bishop of St Agatha, was ſoon after raiſed to the dignity of cardinal, and received a penſion. About this time he was employed by the Pope to draw up the bill of excommunication againſt Queen Elizabeth.</p><p>He began now to caſt his eyes upon the papacy ; and, in order to obtain it, formed and executed a plan of hypocriſy with unparalleled conſtancy and ſucceſs. He became humble, patient, and affable. He changed his dreſs, his air, his words, and his actions, ſo completely, that his moſt intimate friends declared him a new man. Never was there ſuch an abſolute victory gained over the paſſions ; never was a fictitious character ſo long maintained, nor the foibles of human nature ſo artfully concealed. He courted the ambaſſadors of every foreign power, but attached himſelf to the intereſts of none; nor did he accept a single favour that would have laid him under any peculiar obligation. He had formerly treated his relations with the greateſt tenderneſs, but he now changed his behaviour altogether. When his brother Anthony came to viſit him, he lodged him in an inn, and ſent him home next day, charging him to inform his family that he was now dead to his relations and the world.</p><p>When Pius V. died in 1572, he entered the conclave with the other cardinals, but ſeemed altogether indifferent about the election, and never left his apartment except to his devotion. When ſolicited to join any party, he declined it, declaring that he was of no conſequence, and that he would leave the choice of a Pope entirely to perſons of greater knowledge and experience. When Cardinal Ruon Compagnon, who aſſumed the name of Gregory XIII. was elected, Montalto aſſured him that he never wiſhed for any thing ſo much in his life, and that he would always remember his goodneſs, and the favours he had conferred on him in Spain. But the new Pope treated him with the greateſt contempt, and deprived him of his penſion. The cardinals alſo, deceived by his artifices, paid him no greater reſpect, and uſed to call him, by way of ridicule, the Roman beaſt ; the aſs of La Marca.</p><p>He now aſſumed all the infirmities of old age ; his head hung down upon his ſhoulders ; he tottered as he walked, and ſupported himſelf on a ſtaff. His voice became feeble, and was often interrupted by a cough ſo exceedingly ſevere, that it ſeemed every  moment to threaten his diſſolution. He interfered in no public tranſactions, but ſpent his whole time in acts of devotion and benevolence. Mean time he conſtantly employed the ableſt ſpies, who brought him intelligence of every particular.</p><p>When Gregory XIII. died in 1585, he entered the conclave with the greateſt reluctance, and immediately ſhut himſelf up in his chamber, and was no more thought of than if he had not exiſted. When he went</p></body></text></TEI>
