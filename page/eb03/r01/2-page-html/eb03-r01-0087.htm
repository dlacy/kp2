<p><span class="font1">other ; is leſs eaſily calcinable, and much leſs volatile. Its calx is grey, and more or leſs brown ; and whcn fu-ſed with vitrifiable matters, it changes into a beautiful&nbsp;blue glaſs called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">fmah.</span><span class="font1"> This calx, then, is one of thoſe&nbsp;which preſerve always </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font1">part of their inflammable prin-ciple. lſt is foluble in acids, as the regulus is. This&nbsp;regulus is foluble in vitriolic, marine, nitrous acids, and&nbsp;in aqua-regia, to all which it communicates colours.&nbsp;The ſolution in vitriolic acid is reddiſh ; the folution&nbsp;in marine acid is of a fine bluiſh-green when hot, and&nbsp;its colour is almoſt totally effaced when cold, but is&nbsp;eaſily recoverable by heating it, without being obliged&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font1">uncork the bottle containing it. This folution </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">of&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">the calx of regulus of cobalt is the baſis of the ſympa-thetic ink ; for without marine acid this ink cannot be&nbsp;made. All the ſolutions of regulus of cobalt may be&nbsp;precipitated by alkalis ; and theſe precipitates are blue,&nbsp;which colour they retain when vitriſied with the ſtrong-eſt fire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Not only ſympathetic ink, but alſo regulus of cobalt, may be made from the ∙zaffre commonly fold ; which is nothing elſe than the calx of regulus of cobalt&nbsp;mixed with more or leſs pulveriſed flints. For this purpofe we muſt ſeparate as well as we can the powder of&nbsp;flints from it, by waſhing, as M. Beaumé docs, and&nbsp;then reduce it with black flux and ſea-falt. Regulus&nbsp;of cobalt ſeems incapable of uniting with ſulphur : but&nbsp;it eaſily unites with liver of ſulphur ; and the union it&nbsp;forms is ſo intimate, that M. Beaumé could not ſepa-rate theſe two fubſtances otherwiſe than by precipita-tion with an acid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Many curious and intereſting remarks are ſtili to be diſcovered concerning this ſingular ſemimetal, and we&nbsp;may hope to receive further information from the en-deavours of chemiſts who have undertaken the exami-nation of it. M. Beaumé particularly has made conſiderable experiments on this ſubject, part of which he&nbsp;communicates to the public in his Courſe of Chemiſtry,&nbsp;and from whom we have borrowed the moſt of the above&nbsp;obſervations. See C⅛hemistry, n<sup>o</sup> 1294, &amp;c.</span></p>

Long. 12. 25. is only remarkable as the place where&nbsp;the Pruffian army defeated the Auſtrians on the 2iſt&nbsp;of April 1757. The Auſtrian army, commanded by&nbsp;Count Konigfeck, was ported near Reichenberg, and&nbsp;was attacked by the Pruſſians under the command of&nbsp;the prince of Brunſwick Bevern. The Pruſſians were&nbsp;20,000, and the Auſtrians 28,000 : the action began&nbsp;at half after ſix in the morning, when the Pruſſian lines&nbsp;were formed, and attacked the Auſtrian cavalry, which&nbsp;was ranged in three lines of 30 fquadrons, and their&nbsp;two wings fuſtained by the infantry, which was poſted&nbsp;among felled trees and intrenchments. The Auſtrians&nbsp;had a village on their right, and a wood on their left,&nbsp;where they were intrenched. The Pruffian dragoons&nbsp;and grenadiers cleared the intrenchment and wood, and&nbsp;entirely routed the Auſtrian cavalry ; at the fame time,&nbsp;the redoubts that covered Reichenberg were taken by&nbsp;General Leſtewitz ; and </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">the Auſtrians were entirely&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">defeated. The Pruffiιns had feven officers and 100&nbsp;men killed; 14 officers and 150 men wounded. The&nbsp;Auſtrians had 1000 men killed and wounded ; 20 of&nbsp;their officers and 400 men taken priſoners. The action&nbsp;ended at eleven.</span></p>
