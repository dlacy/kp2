<p><span class="font1">Billaud-Varenne systematized the Terror because he believed it necessary for the safety of the country; Robespierteintensified&nbsp;it in order to carry out his own ideas and theories. Robespierre’s&nbsp;private life was always respectable: he was always emphatically a gentleman and man of culture, and even a little bit of a&nbsp;dandy, scrupulously honest, truthful and charitable. In his&nbsp;habits and manner of life he was simple and laborious; he was&nbsp;not a man gifted with flashes of genius, but one who had to think&nbsp;much before he could come to a decision, and he worked hard&nbsp;all his life.</span></p>

After the appearance of the first volume, the publisher refused to proceed for fear&nbsp;of prosecution until compelled to do so by the author. Another&nbsp;edition with a different title appeared in 1878.

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ROBILANT, CARLO FELICE NICOLIS, </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Conte di</span><span class="font1"> (1826-1888), Italian statesman and diplomat, was a native of Turin. He entered the army, and lost his left hand at Novara, where&nbsp;he was aide-de-camp to Charles Albert, king of Piedmont. He&nbsp;fought in 1859, and reached the grade of general in the Austrian&nbsp;campaign of 1866, after which he served on the delimitation&nbsp;commission. He was chief of the Military Academy, and in&nbsp;1867 was made prefect of Ravenna to suppress political disorder. He was defeated at Turin in the elections for the&nbsp;Chamber in 1870, and was sent in 1871 as minister plenipotentiary to Vienna, where he subsequently became ambassador.&nbsp;He was connected with the Prussian nobility by his mother,&nbsp;and he married an Austrian, a daughter of Prince Edmund&nbsp;Clary-Aldringen. In spite of the active share he had taken&nbsp;in driving Austria from Italy, he was a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">persona grata</span><span class="font1"> at Vienna,&nbsp;and his policy was steadily directed to an alliance between the&nbsp;two powers. This was accomplished by the secret terms of&nbsp;the Triple Alliance in 1882. He was recalled to Rome in 1885&nbsp;to become minister for foreign affairs in the Depretis cabinet.&nbsp;Robilant’s independent attitude as foreign minister secured&nbsp;greater consideration for Italy from her allies, but he did not&nbsp;adapt himself to the exigencies of domestic politics, and his&nbsp;excessive unpopularity contributed to* the downfall of the&nbsp;ministry on the 7 th of February 1887, consequent on an adverse&nbsp;vote on the Massawa question. Before leaving office, he completed the negotiations for the renewal of the Triple Alliance,&nbsp;and for its extension to cover Anglo-Italian co-operation in&nbsp;the Mediterranean. In the new Depretis-Crispi administration&nbsp;Robilant was not included. He was sent to London as ambassador in the next year, but died two months after his arrival,&nbsp;on the 17th of October 1888.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROBIN HOOD, English legendary hero. The oldest mention of Robin Hood at present known occurs in the second edition—&nbsp;what is called the B text—of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Piers the Plowman,</span><span class="font1"> the date of&nbsp;which is about 1377. In passus v. of that poem the figure of&nbsp;Sloth is represented as saying—</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“ 1 can noujte perfitly my pater-noster, as the prest it syngeth: But I can rymes of Robyn Hood and Randolf Erle of Chestre.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">He is next mentioned by Andrew of Wyntoun in his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Original Chronicle of Scatlatid,</span><span class="font1"> written about 1420—</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“ Lytel Jhon and Robyne Hude Waythmen ware commendyd gude;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In Yngilwode and Barnysdale</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Thai oysyd all this time [c. 1283] thare trawale &quot;;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">next by Walter Bower in his additions of Fordun’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Scotichro-nicon</span><span class="font1"> about 1450—</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“ Hoc in tempore [1266] de exheredatis et bannitis surrexit et caput erexit ille famosissimus sicarius Robertus Hode et Littill&nbsp;Johanne cum eorum complicibus, de quibus stolidum vulgus hianter&nbsp;in comoediis et tragoediis prurienter restum faciunt et super ceteras&nbsp;romancias, mimos, er bardanos cantitare delectantur.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">’ Of his popularity in the latter half of the 15th and in the 16th centuries there are many signs. Just one passage must be quoted&nbsp;as of special importance because closely followed by R. Grafton,&nbsp;J. Stow and W. Camden. It is from John Mair’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Historia Majoris&nbsp;Britanniae lam Angliae quarn Scotiae,</span><span class="font1"> which appeared in 1521—</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“ Circa haec tempora [Ricardi Primi], ut auguror, Robertus Hudus Anglus et Parvus Joannes Iatrones famatissimi in nemoribus&nbsp;Iatuerunt, solum Opulentorum virorum bona deripientes. Nullum&nbsp;nisi, eos invadentem vel resistentem pro suarum rerum tuitione&nbsp;occiderunt. Centum sagittarios ad pugnam aptissimos Robertus&nbsp;Iatrociniis aluit, quos 400 viri fortissimi invadere non audebant.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rebus hujus Roberti gestis tola Britannia in cantibus Utitur<sub>t</sub></span><span class="font1"> Faeminam&nbsp;nullam opprimi permisit nec pauperum bona surripuit, verum eos&nbsp;ex abbatum bonis sublatis opipare pa vit. Viri rapinam improbo,&nbsp;sed Iatronum omnium humanissimus et princeps erat.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the Elizabethan era and afterwards mentions abound; see the works of Shakespeare, Sidney, Ben Jonson, Drayton,&nbsp;Warner, A. Munday, Camden, Stow, Braithwaite, Fuller, &amp;c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Of the ballads themselves, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">RobinHood and the Monk</span><span class="font1"> is possibly as old as the reign of Edward II. (see Thomas Wright’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Essays&nbsp;on England in the Middle Ages,</span><span class="font1"> ii. 174); </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Robin Hood and the&nbsp;Potter</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Robyn and Gandelyn</span><span class="font1"> are certainly not later than the&nbsp;15th century. Most important of all is A </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lytell Geste of Robyn&nbsp;Hode,</span><span class="font1"> which was first printed about 1510 (see A. W. Pollard’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Fifteenth Century Prose and Verse,</span><span class="font1"> Westminster, 1903). This is&nbsp;evidently founded on older ballads; we read in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Seconde&nbsp;Fytte,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> 11. </span><span class="font1">176 and 177—</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“ He wente hym forthe full mery syngynge,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As men have told in tale.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In fact, it does for the Robin Hood cycle what a few years before Sir Thomas Malory had done for the Arthurian romances&nbsp;—what in the 6th century </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.</span><span class="font1"> Peisistratus is said to have done&nbsp;for the Homeric poems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">These are the facts about him and his balladry. Of conjectures there is no end. Hc has been represented as the last of the Saxons—as a Saxon holding out against the Norman conquerors&nbsp;so late as the end of the 12th century (see Augustin Thierry’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Norman Conquest,</span><span class="font1"> and compare Sir Walter Scott’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ivanhoe).&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">J. M. Gutch maintains that he was a follower of Simon de&nbsp;Montfort. The Rev. Joseph Hunter associated him with the&nbsp;rebel earl of Lancaster of Edward II.’s time. This scholar&nbsp;in a brochure published in 1852 produced evidence from the&nbsp;exchequer accounts and the court rolls of the manor of Wakefield showing that a “ Robyn Hod ” and a “ Robertus Hood ”&nbsp;were living in this reign. The series of coincidences to which&nbsp;he points is undoubtedly striking, but had failed to convince&nbsp;most critics. Professor F. J. Child dismisses his inferences as&nbsp;“ ludicrous.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For our part, we are not disinclined to believe that the Robin Hood story has some historical basis, however fanciful and&nbsp;romantic the superstructure. We parallel it with the Arthurian&nbsp;story, and hold that, just as there was probably a real Arthur,&nbsp;however different from the hero of the trouvères, so there was a&nbsp;real Hood, however now enlarged and (Iisguisedbythe accretions&nbsp;of legend. That Charlemagne and Richard I. </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font1">England became the subjects of romances does not prevent our believing&nbsp;in their existence; nor need Hood’s mythical life deprive him of&nbsp;his natural one. Sloth in Langland’s poem couples him, as we&nbsp;have seen, with Randle, earl of Chester; and no one doubts&nbsp;this nobleman’s existence because he had “ rymes ” made about&nbsp;him. We believe him to have been the third Randle (see Bishop&nbsp;Percy’s Folio MS., ed. Hales and Furnivall, i. 260). And possibly enough Hood was contemporary with that earl, who&nbsp;“ flourished ” in the reigns of Richard L, John and Henry IIL&nbsp;Wyntoun and Mair, as we have seen, assign him to that period.&nbsp;It is impossible to believe with Hunter that he lived so late as&nbsp;Edward II.’s reign. This would leave no time for the growth</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
