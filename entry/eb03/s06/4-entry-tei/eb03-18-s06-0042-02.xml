(Dr Gilbert), was born at Edinburgh in the year 1742. His father Mr George Stuart was professor of humanity in the univerſity, and a man of conſiderable eminence for his classical taſte and literature. For theſe accompliſhments he was probably indebted in no ſmall degree to his relation the celebrated Ruddiman, with whom both he and his ſon converſed familiarly, though they afterwards united to injure his fame.</p><p>Gilbert having finiſhed his claſſical and philoſophical ſtudies in the grammar ſchool and univerſity, applied himſelf to jurisprudence, without following or probably intending to follow the profeſſion of the law. For that profeſſion he has been repreſented as unqualified by indolence ; by a paſsion which at a very early period of life he displayed for general literature ; or by boundleſs dissipation :—and all theſe circumſtances may have contributed to make him relinquiſh purſuits in which he could hope to ſucceed only by patient perſeverance and ſtrict decorum of manners. That he did not waſte his youth in idleneſs, is, however, evident from An Hiſtorical Diſſertation concerning the Antiquity of the Britiſh Conſtitution, which he publiſhed before he had completed his twenty-ſecond year, and which had ſo much merit as to induce the univerſity of Edinburgh to confer upon the author, though ſo young a man, the degree of LL.D.</p><p>After a ſtudious interval of ſome years, he produced a valuable work, under the title of A View of Society in Europe, in its Progreſs from Rudeneſs to Refinement ; or, Inquiries concerning the Hiſtory of Laws, Government, and Manners. He had read and meditated with patience on the moſt important monuments of the middle ages; and in this volume (which ſpeedily reached a ſecond edition) he aimed chiefly at the praise of originality and invention, and diſcovered an induſtry that is ſeldom connected with ability and diſcernment. About the time of the publication of the firſt edition of this performance, having turned his thoughts to an academical life, he aſked for the professorship of public law in the univerſity of Edinburgh. According to his own account he had been promiſed that place by the miniſter, but had the mortification to see the professorſhip beſtowed on another, and all his hopes blaſted by the influence of Dr Robertſon, whom he repreſented as under obligations to him.</p><p>To the writer of this article, who was a ſtranger to theſe rival candidates for hiſtorical fame, this part of the ſtory ſeems very incredible ; as it is not eaſy to conceive how it ever could be in the power of Dr Stuart to render to the learned Principal any eſſential ſervice. It was believed indeed by the earl of Buchan, and by others, who obſerved that the illiberal jealouſy not unfrequent in the world of letters, was probably the ſource of this oppoſition ; which entirely broke the intimacy of two persons who, before that time, were underſtood to be on the moſt friendly footing with each other. Ingratitude, however, is as likely to have been the vice of Dr Stuart as of Dr Robertſon ; for we have been told by a writer<note anchored="true" n="1" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>* Chalmers in his Life of Ruddiman.</p></note> *, who, at leaſt in one instance, has completely proved what he affirms, that “ ſuch was Gilbert Stuart’s laxity of principle as a man, that he considered ingratitude as one of the moſt venial sins ; ſuch was his conceit as a writer, that he regarded no one’s merits but his own ; ſuch were his diſappointments, both as a writer and a man, that he allowed his peevishneſs to ſour into malice, and indulged his malevolence till it ſettled in corruption.”</p><p>Soon after this diſappointment Dr Stuart went to London, where he became from 1768 to 1774 one of the writers of the Monthly Review. In 1772 Dr Adam, rector of the high ſchool at Edinburgh, publiſhed a Latin Grammar, which he intended as an improvement of the famous Ruddiman’s. Stuart attacked him in a pamphlet under the name of Bush <hi rend="italic">by,</hi> and treated him with much ſeverity. In doing this, he was probably actuated more by ſome perſonal diſlike of Dr Adam than by regard for the memory of bis learned relation; for on other occaſions he ſhowed sufficiently that he had no regard to Ruddiman’s honour as a grammarian, editor, or critic.</p><p>In 1774 he returned to his native city, and began the Edinburgh Magazine and Review, in which he diſcuſſed the liberty and conſtitution of England, and diſtinguiſhed himſelf by an inquiry into the character of John Knox the reformer, whoſe principles he reprobated in the ſevereſt terms. About this time he reviſed and publiſhed Sullivan’s Lectures on the Conſtitution of England. Sooft after he turned his thoughts to the hiſtory of Scotland, and publiſhed Obſervations concerning its Public Law and Conſtitutional Hiſtory; in which he examined with a critical care the preliminary book to Dr Robertſon’s Hiſtory. His next work was The Hiſtory of the Reformation ; a book which deserves praiſe for the eaſy dignity of the narrative, and for ſtrict impartiality. His laſt great work, The Hiſtory of Scotland from the Eſtablishment of the Reformation to the Death of Queen Mary, which appeared in 1782, has been very generally read and admired. His purpoſe was to vindicate the character of the injured queen, and expoſe the weakneſs of the arguments by which Dr Robertſon had endeavoured to prove her guilty : but though the ſtyle of this work is his own, it contains very little matter which was not furniſhed by Goodall and Tytler ; and it is with the arms which theſe two writers put into his hands that Dr Stuart vanquished his great antagoniſt.</p><p>In 1782 he once more viſited London, and engaged in the Political Herald and Engliſh Review; but the jaundice and dropſy increaſing on him, he returned by ſea to his native country, where he died in the house of his father on the 13th of Auguſt 1786.</p><p>In his perſon Dr Stuart was about the middle ſize and juſtly proportioned. His countenance was modeſt and else preſſive, ſometimes glowing with ſentiments of friendſhip, of which he was truly ſuſceptible, and at others darting that ſatire and indignation at folly and vice which appear in ſome of his writings. He was a boon companion ; and, with a conſtitution that might have ſtood the ſhock of ages, he fell a premature martyr to intemperance. His talents were certainly great, and his writings are uſeful ; but he ſeems to have been influenced more by paſſion than prejudice, and in his character there was not much to be imitated.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
