 in antiquity, feaſts held annually among the Romans, to obtain of the gods a plentiful harveſt. They were celebrated in the temple of Tellus, where ſolemn ſacrifices were offered to Tellus and Ceres. Theſe feaſts were held about ſeed-time, uſually in the month of January ; for, as Macrobius observes, they were moveable feaſts.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
