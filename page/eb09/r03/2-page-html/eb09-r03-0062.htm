        <p><span class="font1">midia, who himself willingly acknowledged the suzerainty of Rome. But
                it was impossible for this arrangement to&nbsp;be permanent. Every symptom of
                reviving prosperity at&nbsp;Carthage was regarded at Rome with feverish anxiety,
                and&nbsp;neither the expulsion of Hannibal in 195 nor his death in&nbsp;183 did much
                to check the growing conviction that Rome&nbsp;would never be secure while her rival
                existed. It was&nbsp;therefore with grim satisfaction that many in the
                Roman&nbsp;senate watched the increasing irritation of the Carthaginians under the
                harassing raids and encroachments of&nbsp;their favoured neighbour Masinissa, and
                waited for the&nbsp;moment when Carthage should, by some breach of the conditions
                imposed upon her, supply Rome with a pretext for&nbsp;interference. At last in 151
                came the news that Carthage,&nbsp;in defiance of treaty obligations, was actually at
                war with&nbsp;Masinissa. The anti-Carthaginan party in the senate,&nbsp;headed by M.
                Porcius Cato, eagerly seized the opportunity, and, in spite of the protests of
                Scipio Nasica and&nbsp;others, war was declared, and nothing short of the
                destruction of their city itself was demanded from the
                despairing&nbsp;Carthaginians. This demand, as the senate no doubt&nbsp;foresaw, was
                refused, and in 149 the siege of Carthage&nbsp;begun. During the next two years
                little progress was&nbsp;made, but in 147 P. Cornelius Scipio Æmilianus, son&nbsp;of
                L. Æmilius Paulus, conqueror of Macedonia, and&nbsp;grandson by adoption of the
                conqueror of Hannibal was,&nbsp;at the age of thirty-seven, and though only a
                candidate for&nbsp;the ædileship, elected consul, and given the command
                in&nbsp;Africa. In the next year (146) Carthage was taken and&nbsp;razed to the
                ground. Its territory became the Roman&nbsp;province of Africa, while Numidia,.now
                ruled by the three&nbsp;sons of Masinissa, remained as an allied state under
                Roman&nbsp;suzerainty, and served to protect the new province against&nbsp;the raids
                of the desert tribes. Within little more than&nbsp;a centuryfrom the commencement of
                the First PunicWar,&nbsp;the whole of the former dominions of Carthage had
                been&nbsp;brought under the direct rule of Roman' magistrates, and&nbsp;were
                regularly organized as Roman provinces.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">In Italy itself the Hannibalic war was inevitably followed by
                important changes, and these changes were&nbsp;naturally enough in the direction of
                an increased Roman&nbsp;predominance. In the north the Celtic tribes paid
                for&nbsp;their sympathy with Hannibal with the final loss of all&nbsp;separate
                political existence. Cispadane Gaul, studded&nbsp;with colonies, and flooded with
                Roman settlers, was rapidly&nbsp;Romanized. Beyond the Po in Polybius’s time,
                about&nbsp;sixty years after the Hannibalic war, Roman civilization was already
                widely spread. In the extreme northeast the Latin colony of Aquileia, the last of
                its kind,&nbsp;was founded in 181, to hold in check the Alpine tribes,&nbsp;while in
                the north-west the Ligurians, though not finally&nbsp;subdued until a later time,
                were held in check by the&nbsp;colony of Luna (180), and by the extensive
                settlements of&nbsp;Roman citizens and Latins made on Ligurian territory
                    in&nbsp;173.@@<sup>1</sup> In southern Italy the effects of the war were
                not&nbsp;less marked. The depression of the Greek cities on the&nbsp;coast, begun by
                the raids of the Sabellian tribes, was completed by the repeated blows inflicted
                upon them during&nbsp;the Hannibalic struggle. Some of them lost territory
                    ;@@<sup>2&nbsp;</sup>all suffered from a decline of population and loss of trade
                ;&nbsp;and their place was taken by such new Roman settlements&nbsp;as Brundusium
                and Puteoli.@@<sup>3</sup> In the interior the southern&nbsp;Sabellian tribes
                suffered scarcely less severely. The&nbsp;Bruttii were struck off the list of Roman
                allies, and nearly</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">all their territory was confiscated.@@<sup>4</sup> To the Apulians
                and Lucanians no such hard measure was meted out ; but their&nbsp;strength had been
                broken by the war, and their numbers&nbsp;dwindled ; large tracts of land in their
                territories were&nbsp;seized by Rome, and allotted to Roman settlers, or
                occupied&nbsp;by Roman speculators. That Etruria also suffered from&nbsp;declining
                energy, a dwindling population, and the spread&nbsp;of large estates is clear from
                the state of things existing&nbsp;there in 133. It was indeed in central Italy, the
                home&nbsp;of the Latins and their nearest kinsmen, and in the new&nbsp;Latin and
                Roman settlements throughout the peninsula&nbsp;that progress and activity were
                henceforth concentrated, and&nbsp;even within this area the Roman, and not the
                strictly Latin,&nbsp;element tended to preponderate. Of the twenty
                colonies&nbsp;founded between 201 and 146 only four were Latin.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">(5) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rome in the
                East,</span><span class="font1"> 200-133.—Ever since the repulse of Pyrrhus from
                Italy, Rome had been slowly drifting into closer contact with the Eastern states.
                With one of the three great powers which had divided between&nbsp;them the empire of
                Alexander, with Egypt, she had&nbsp;formed an alliance in 273, and the alliance had
                been&nbsp;cemented by the growth of commercial intercourse&nbsp;between the two
                    countries.@@<sup>5</sup> In 228 her chastisement of&nbsp;the Illyrian pirates
                had led naturally enough to the&nbsp;establishment of friendly relations with some
                of the&nbsp;states of Greece proper. Further than this, however,&nbsp;Rome for the
                time showed no desire to go. The connexions already formed were sufficient to open
                the eastern&nbsp;ports to her trade, and the engrossing struggle with&nbsp;Carthage
                left her neither leisure nor strength for active&nbsp;interference in the incessant
                feuds and rivalries which had&nbsp;made up Eastern politics since the falling
                asunder of&nbsp;Alexander’s empire. In 214 the alliance between Philip&nbsp;and
                Hannibal, and the former’s threatened attack on Italy,&nbsp;forced her into war with
                Macedon, but even then she contented herself with heading a coalition of the Greek
                states&nbsp;against him, which effectually frustrated his designs&nbsp;against
                herself ; and at the first opportunity (205) she&nbsp;ended the war by a peace which
                left the position unchanged. The results of the war were not only to
                draw&nbsp;closer the ties which bound Rome to the Greek states,&nbsp;but to inspire
                the senate with a genuine dread of Philip’s&nbsp;restless ambition, and with a
                bitter resentment against&nbsp;him for his union with Hannibal. The events of the
                next&nbsp;four years served to deepen both these feelings. In 205&nbsp;Philip
                entered into a compact with Antiochus of Syria for&nbsp;the partition between them
                of the dominions of Egypt,@@<sup>6&nbsp;</sup>now left by the death of Ptolemy
                Philopator to the rule of&nbsp;a boy king. Antiochus was to take Ccele-Syria
                and&nbsp;Phoenicia, while Philip claimed for his share the districts&nbsp;subject to
                Egypt on the coasts of the Ægean and the Greek&nbsp;islands. Philip no doubt hoped
                to be able to secure these&nbsp;unlawful acquisitions before the close of the Second
                Punic&nbsp;War should set Rome free to interfere with his plans.&nbsp;But the
                obstinate resistance offered by Attalus of Perga-mum and the Rhodians upset his
                calculations. In 201&nbsp;Rome ma*de peace with Carthage, and the senate
                had&nbsp;leisure to listen to the urgent appeal for assistance which&nbsp;reached
                her from her Eastern allies. With Antiochus&nbsp;indeed the senate was not yet
                prepared to quarrel ; Egypt&nbsp;was assured of the continued friendship of Rome,
                but&nbsp;Antiochus was allowed to work his will in
                Ccele-Syria.@@<sup>7&nbsp;</sup>With Philip it is clear that the senate had no
                thoughts&nbsp;of a peaceful settlement. Their animosity against him&nbsp;had been
                deepened by the assistance he had recently&nbsp;rendered to Carthage. Always an
