            <p>ſelves, they engaged the king to ſubſcribe a bond, affirming that the project of
                aſſaſſmating Rizzio was altogether of his own deviſing; acknowledging that he had
                ſolicited them to take a part in it, from the apprehenſions that reſiſtance might be
                made to him; and agreeing, upon the word and honour of a prince, to protect and
                ſecure them againſt every hazard and injury to which they might be expoſed from the
                atchievement of his enter priſe. Having procured this ſecurity, and having allured
                the earl of Lenox the king’s father to approve their meaſures, they adjuſted the
                method of the projected murder; and diſpatched a meſſenger to the Engliſh frontier,
                advertiſing the earl of Murray and the rebels of their intentions, and inviting them
                to return to the court.</p>
            <p>Upon the 9th day of March, about 7 o’clock in the evening, armed men, to the number
                of 500, ſurrounded the palace of Holyroodhouſe. The earl of Morton and the Lord
                Lindſay entered the court of the palace, with 160 perſons. The queen was in her
                chamber at ſupper, having in her preſence her natural filter the counteſs of Argyle,
                her natural brother Robert commendator of Holyroodhouſe, Beton of Creicſh matter of
                the houſehold, Arthur Erſkine, and David Rizzio. The king entering the apartment,
                ſeated himſelf by her fide. He was followed by the Lord Ruthven, who being waſted
                with ſickneſs, and caſed in armour, exhibited an appearance that was hideous and
                terrible. Four ruffians attended him. In a hollow voice he commanded Rizzio to leave
                a place which did not become him. The queen, in aſtoniſhment and conſternation,
                applied to the king to unfold to her this myſterious enterprise. He affected
                ignorance. She ordered Ruthven from her preſence, under the pain of treaſon;
                declaring to him at the ſame time, that if Rizzio had committed any crime, ſhe would
                produce him before the parliament, and puniſh him according to the laws. Ruthven
                drawing his dagger, advanced towards Rizzio. The queen roſe to make an exertion of
                her authority. The unfortunate ſtrangcr laid hold of her garments, crying out for
                juſtice and mercy. Other conſpirators ruſhing into the chamber, overturned the
                table, and increaſed the diſmay and confuſion. Loaded piſtols were preſented to the
                boſom of the queen. The king held her in his arms. George Douglas, Hatching the
                dagger of his ſovereign, plunged it into the body of Rizzio. The wounded and
                ſcreaming victim was dragged into the antichamber; and ſo eager were the aſſaſſins
                to complete their work, that he was torn and mangled with 56 wounds.</p>
            <p>While the queen was preſſing the king to gratify her inquiries into the meaning of a
                deed ſo execrable, Ruthven returned into their preſence. She gave a full vent to
                indignation and reproach. Ruthven, with an intolerable coldneſs and deliberation,
                informed her, that Rizzio had been put to death by the counſel of her huſband, whom
                he had diſhonoured; and that by the perſuaſion of this minion ſhe had refuſed the
                crown-matrimonial to the king, had engaged to re-eſtabliſh the ancient religion, had
                reſolved to puniſh the earl of Murray and his friends, and had entruſted her
                confidence to Bothwel and Huntley, who were traitors. The king, taking the part of
                Ruthven, remonſtrated againſt her proceedings, and complained that from the time of
                her familiarity with Rizzio, ſhe had neither regarded, nor entertained, nor truſted
                him. His ſuſpicions and ingratitude ſhocked and tortured her. His connection with
                the conſpirators gave her an ominous anxiety. Apprehenſions of outrages ſtill more
                atrocious invaded her. In theſe agitated and miſerable moments ſhe did not loſe
                herſelf in the helpleſſneſs of ſorrow. The loftineſs of her ſpirit communicated
                relief to her; and wiping away her tears, ſhe exclaimed, that it was not now a
                ſeaſon for lamentation, but for revenge.</p>
            <p>The earls of Huntley, Bothwel, and Athol, the lords Fleming and Levingſton, and Sir
                James Balfour, who were obnoxious to the conſpirators, and at this time in the
                palace, found all reſiſtance to be vain. Some of them eluding the vigilance of
                Morton, made their eſcape; and others were allowed to retire. The provoſt and
                magiſtrates of Edinburgh getting intelligence of the tumult, ordered the alarm bell
                to be rung. The citizens, apprehenſive and anxious, approached in crowds to inquire
                into the welfare of their ſovereign; but ſhe was not permitted to addreſs herſelf to
                them. The conſpirators told her, that if ſhe preſumed to make any harangue, they
                would “cut her in pieces, and caſt her over the walls.” The king called to the
                people that ſhe was well, and commanded them to diſperſe. The queen was ſhut up in
                her chamber, uncertain of her fate, and without the conſolation or attendance of her
                women.</p>
            <p>In the morning a proclamation was iſſued by the king, without the knowledge of his
                queen, prohibiting the meeting of the parliament, and ordering the members to retire
                from the city. The rebellious lords now</p>
