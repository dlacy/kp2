        <p><span class="font1">knew little or nothing ; the task of ridding the Greek seaports of
                their barbarian foes he no doubt regarded as an easy one ; and the splendid force he
                brought with him was&nbsp;intended rather for the conquest of the West than for
                the&nbsp;preliminary work of chastising a few Italian tribes, or&nbsp;securing the
                submission of the Unwarlike Italian Greeks.&nbsp;Pyrrhus’s first measure was to
                place Tarentum under a&nbsp;strict military discipline ; this done he advanced
                into&nbsp;Lucania to meet the Roman consul Lævinus. The&nbsp;battle which followed,
                on the banks of the Liris, ended in&nbsp;the complete defeat of the Roman troops,
                largely owing&nbsp;to the panic caused by the elephants which Pyrrhus
                had&nbsp;brought with him (280).@@<sup>1</sup> The Greek cities expelled
                their&nbsp;Roman garrisons and joined him, while numerous bands&nbsp;of Samnites,
                Lucauians, and Bruttians flocked to his&nbsp;standard. But, to the disappointment of
                his Greek and&nbsp;Italian allies, Pyrrhus showed no anxiety to follow up
                the&nbsp;advantage he had gained. His heart was set on Sicily&nbsp;and Africa, and
                his immediate object was to effect such&nbsp;an arrangement with Rome as would at
                once fulfil the&nbsp;pledges he had given to the Greeks by securing
                them&nbsp;against Roman interference and set himself free to seek&nbsp;his fortunes
                westward. But, though his favourite minister&nbsp;Cineas employed all his skill to
                win the ear of the senate,&nbsp;and, though Pyrrhus himself lent weight to his
                envoy’s&nbsp;words by advancing as near Rome as Anagnia (279),&nbsp;nothing could
                shake the resolution of the senate, and&nbsp;Cineas brought back the reply that the
                Romans could&nbsp;not treat with Pyrrhus so long as he remained in arms&nbsp;upon
                Italian soil. Disappointed in his hopes of peace,&nbsp;Pyrrhus in the next year
                (278) turned his forces against&nbsp;the Roman strongholds in Apulia.@@<sup>2</sup>
                Once more, at Ascu-lum, he routed the legions, but only to find that
                the&nbsp;indomitable resolution of the enemy was strengthened&nbsp;by defeat. Weary
                of a struggle which threatened indefinitely to postpone the fulfilment of his dreams
                of&nbsp;empire, Pyrrhus resolved to quit Italy, and, leaving garrisons in the Greek
                towns, crossed into Sicily. Here his&nbsp;success at first was such as promised the
                speedy realization of his hopes. The Sicilian Greeks hailed him as a&nbsp;deliverer;
                the Carthaginians were driven back to the&nbsp;extreme west of the island, and Eryx
                and Panormus fell into&nbsp;his hands. But at this point fortune deserted him.
                His&nbsp;efforts to take Lilybæum were fruitless ; the Carthaginians&nbsp;recovered
                their courage, while the unstable Greeks, easily&nbsp;daunted by the first
                threatenings of failure, and impatient&nbsp;of the burdens of war, broke out into
                open murmurs&nbsp;against him. Soured and disappointed, Pyrrhus returned&nbsp;to
                Italy (276) to find the Roman legions steadily moving&nbsp;southwards, and his
                Italian allies disgusted by his desertion of their cause. One of the consuls for the
                year (275),&nbsp;M. Curius Dentatus, the conqueror of Samnium, was&nbsp;encamped at
                Beneventum awaiting the arrival of his&nbsp;colleague. Here Pyrrhus attacked him,
                and the closing&nbsp;battle of the war was fought. It ended in the
                complete&nbsp;victory of the Romans. Pyrrhus, unable any longer to&nbsp;face his
                opponents in the field, and disappointed of all&nbsp;assistance from his allies,
                retreated in disgust to Tarentum&nbsp;and thence crossed into
                Greece.@@<sup>3</sup></span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">A few years later (272) Tarentum was surrendered to Rome by its
                Epirot garrison ; it was granted a treaty of&nbsp;alliance, but its walls were razed
                and its fleet handed over&nbsp;to Rome. In 270 Rhegium also entered the ranks
                of&nbsp;Roman allies, and finally in 269 a single campaign crushed&nbsp;the last
                efforts at resistance in Samnium. Rome was&nbsp;now at leisure to consolidate the
                position she had won.&nbsp;Between 273 and 263 three new colonies were founded
                in&nbsp;Samnium and Lucania—Pæstum in 273, Beneventum in</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">268, Æsernia in 263. In central Italythe area of Roman territory was
                increased by the full enfranchisement (268)&nbsp;of the Sabines,@@<sup>4</sup> and
                of their neighbours to the east,&nbsp;the Picentes. To guard the Adriatic coast
                colonies were&nbsp;established at Ariminum (268), at Firmum, and at
                Castrum&nbsp;Xovum (264), while to the already numerous maritime&nbsp;colonies was
                added that of Cosa in Etruria.@@<sup>5</sup></span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Rome was now the undisputed mistress of Italy. The limits of her
                supremacy to the north were represented&nbsp;roughly by a line drawn across the
                peninsula from the&nbsp;mouth of the Arno on the west to that of the Æsis on
                    the&nbsp;east.@@<sup>6</sup> Beyond this line lay the Ligurians and the Celts
                ;&nbsp;all south of it was now united as “Italy” under the rule&nbsp;of
            Rome.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">But the rule of Rome over Italy, like her wider rule over the
                Mediterranean coasts, was not an absolute&nbsp;dominion over conquered subjects. It
                was in form at&nbsp;least a confederacy under Roman protection and guidance ; and
                the Italians, like the provincials, were not&nbsp;the subjects, but the “allies and
                friends” of the Roman&nbsp;people.@@<sup>7</sup> Marvellous as are the perseverance
                and skill&nbsp;with which Rome built up, consolidated, and directed&nbsp;this
                confederacy, it is yet clear that both her success in&nbsp;forming it and its
                stability when formed were due in part&nbsp;to other causes than Roman valour and
                policy. The&nbsp;disunion which, in former times, had so often weakened
                the&nbsp;Italians in their struggles with Rome still told in her&nbsp;favour, and
                rendered the danger of a combined revolt&nbsp;against her authority remote in the
                extreme. In some&nbsp;cases, and especially in the city states of Etruria,
                Campania,&nbsp;and Magna Græcia, where the antagonism of the two&nbsp;political
                parties, aristocrats and democrats, was keen,&nbsp;Rome found natural and valuable
                allies in the former.&nbsp;Among the more backward peoples of central Italy,
                the&nbsp;looseness of their political organization not only lessened&nbsp;their
                power of resistance, but enabled Rome either to&nbsp;detach tribe after tribe from
                the confederacy or to attack&nbsp;and crush them singly. Elsewhere she was aided
                by&nbsp;ancient feuds, such as those between Samnites and Apulians,&nbsp;or
                Tarentines and Iapygians, or by the imminent dread&nbsp;of a foe—Celt, or Samnite,
                or Lucanian—whom Roman aid&nbsp;alone could repel. And, while combination against
                her&nbsp;was thus rendered difficult, if not impossible, by
                internal&nbsp;dissensions, feuds, differences of interest, of race,
                of&nbsp;language, and habits, Rome herself, from her position in&nbsp;the centre of
                Italy, was so placed as to be able to strike&nbsp;promptly, on the first signs of
                concerted opposition. All&nbsp;these advantages Rome utilized to the utmost. We
                have&nbsp;no means of deciding how far she applied elsewhere the&nbsp;principle upon
                which she acted in northern Etruria and&nbsp;Campania, of attaching the aristocratic
                party in a community to Roman interests, by the grant of special&nbsp;privileges;
                but it is certain that she endeavoured by every&nbsp;means in her power to
                perpetuate, and even to increase, the&nbsp;disunion which she had found so useful
                among her allies.&nbsp;In every possible way she strove to isolate them
                from&nbsp;each other, while binding them closely to herself. The&nbsp;old federal
                groups were in most cases broken up, and each&nbsp;of the members united with Rome
                by a special treaty&nbsp;of alliance. In Etruria, Latium, Campania, and
                Magna&nbsp;Græcia the city state was taken as the unit; in central&nbsp;Italy, where
                urban life was non-existent, the unit was the&nbsp;tribe. The northern Sabellian
                peoples, for instance,—the&nbsp;Marsi, Pæligni, Vestini, Marrucini, Frentani,—were
                now</span></p>
