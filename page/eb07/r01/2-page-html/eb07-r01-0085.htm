<p><span class="font0">“ une accord superflue,” which we have translated a redundant chord, has by others been rendered a chord extremely sharp, as in the translation of Rameau’s Principles of . Composition. Their nature will be best understood by a&nbsp;few examples, and an account of the number of tones, semitones, or lesser intervals, contained in each.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">second redundant</span><span class="font0"> is composed of a major tone and a minor semitone, as from </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">fa</span><span class="font0"> to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sol</span><span class="font0"> sharp. Its proportion&nbsp;is as 64 to 75. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">third redundant</span><span class="font0"> consists of two tones&nbsp;and a semitone, as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">fa Ut</span><span class="font0"> sharp. Its proportion is as 96 to&nbsp;125. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">fourth redundant</span><span class="font0"> is the same with the tritone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">From these examples compared with the same intervals in their natural state, the reader may form a general idea&nbsp;of what is meant by </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">redundant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">REDUPLICATION of sounds in musical harmony. See the article Music, under section </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Harmony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">REE, Reis, or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Res,</span><span class="font0"> a small Portuguese coin. See Jfo-</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">KEY- Table.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">REEF, a term in navigation. When there is a heavy gale of wind, the seamen commonly roll up part of the sail&nbsp;below, that by this means it may become the narrower,&nbsp;and not draw so much wind ; and this contracting or taking up the sail they call a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">reef,</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">reefing the sail.</span><span class="font0"> So also,&nbsp;when a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">top-mast is sprung,</span><span class="font0"> as they call it, that is, when it&nbsp;is cracked, or almost broken in the cap, they cut off the&nbsp;lower piece that was nearly broken off, and setting the other&nbsp;part, now much shorter, in the step again, they call it a&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">reefed top-mast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">REEF Island, a small island in the Eastern Seas, about fifty miles from the west coast of Sumatra, and called also&nbsp;Disastrous Island, from the number of shipwrecks which&nbsp;have taken place near it. Long. 101. 3. E. Lat. 4. S. It&nbsp;is also the name of a small island near the northern coast of&nbsp;the island of Celebes. Long. 122. 48. E. Lat. O. 8. N.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">REEL, in the manufactories, a machine employed for the purpose of reeling. There are various kinds of reels ; some&nbsp;very simple, others very complex.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">REELING, in the manufactories, the winding of silk, cotton, or the like, into a skain, or upon a button, to prevent its entangling. It is also used for the charging or&nbsp;discharging of bobbins or quills, to be employed in the manufacture of different stuffs, as thread, silk, cotton, and the&nbsp;like. Reeling is performed in different ways, and on different engines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">REEPHAM, a market-town of the county of Norfolk, in the hundred of Eynesford, 113 miles from London, and&nbsp;thirteen from Norwich. It was once much larger than at&nbsp;present, and had three churches. It stands on the river&nbsp;Eyne, and has a market, which is held on Saturday. The&nbsp;population amounted in 1801 to 284, in 1811 to 299, in&nbsp;1821 to 345, and in 1831 to 452.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">REES, a town of the Prussian government of Cleves, the capital of a circle of the same name, which extends over&nbsp;166 square miles, comprehending seven cities and towns,&nbsp;thirty-seven villages, and 32,950 inhabitants. The town is&nbsp;situated on the river Rhine, and contains two churches,&nbsp;470 houses, and 2800 inhabitants. Long. 6. 17. 14. E.&nbsp;Lat. 51. 45. 55. N.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">REEVE, Clara, the ingenious authoress of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Tlie Old English Baron,</span><span class="font0"> was the daughter of the Reverend William&nbsp;Reeve, rector of Freston, and of Kerton, in Suffolk, and&nbsp;perpetual curate of St Nicholas. Her mother’s maiden&nbsp;name was Smitllies, daughter of Mr Smithies, goldsmith and&nbsp;jeweller to George I. The father of Miss Reeve was “ an&nbsp;old Whig,” and from him she learned all that she knew ;&nbsp;he was her oracle, and used to make her readl the parliamentary debates whilst he smoked his pipe after supper.&nbsp;Under the same paternal tuition, she also read Rapin’s&nbsp;History of England, Cato’s Letters, the Greek and Roman&nbsp;histories, and Plutarch’s Lives, at an age when few people&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font0">either sex can read their own names. Mr Reeve, himself one of a family of eight children, had the same number&nbsp;of offspring ; and hence it is probable that Clara’s strong&nbsp;natural turn for study, rather than any degree of exclusive&nbsp;care which his partiality could bestow, enabled her to acquire such a stock of early information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">After the death of Mr Reeve, his widow resided in Colchester with three of his daughters ; and it was here that Clara first became an authoress, by translating from the original Latin Barclay’s fine old romance of Argenis, which&nbsp;was published in 1762, under the title of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Phœnix.</span><span class="font0"> It&nbsp;was not, however, until 1767, five years afterwards, that&nbsp;she produced her first and most distinguished work, which&nbsp;was published by Mr Dilly of the Poultry, under the title&nbsp;of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Champion of Virtue.</span><span class="font0"> The sum given for the copyright was only ten pounds ; but in the following year the&nbsp;work came to a second edition, and was then first called&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Tlie Old English Baron,</span><span class="font0"> for what reason we do not pretend to conjecture. This production is inscribed to Mrs&nbsp;Brigden, the daughter of Richardson, who is stated to have&nbsp;lent some assistance in the revision and correction of the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The success of The Old English Baron encouraged Miss Reeve to devote more of her leisure hours to literary composition, and accordingly she published in succession, The&nbsp;Two Mentors, The Progress of Romance, The Exile, The&nbsp;School for Widows, Plans of Education, and Memoirs of&nbsp;Sir Roger de Clarendon, a natural son of the Black Prince,&nbsp;with Anecdotes of many other eminent persons of the&nbsp;fourteenth century. To these works there remains to be&nbsp;added another, the interest of which turned upon supernatural appearances. In a preface to a subsequent edition of&nbsp;The Old English Baron, Miss Reeve informs the public that,&nbsp;in compliance with the suggestion of a friend, she had composed </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Castle Connor,</span><span class="font0"> an Irish story, in which apparitions&nbsp;were introduced. But the manuscript being intrusted to&nbsp;some careless or unfaithful person, fell aside, and was never&nbsp;recovered. The various novels produced by this lady are&nbsp;all marked by excellent good sense, pure morality, and a&nbsp;considerable command of those qualities requisite to constitute a good romance. They were, generally speaking,&nbsp;favourably received at the time ; but none of them took the&nbsp;same strong possession of the public mind as The Old English Baron, upon which the fame of the author may be&nbsp;considered as now exclusively rested, and by which alone&nbsp;6he will be known to posterity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Miss Reeve led a retired life, affording no materials for biography, until the beginning of December 1803, when&nbsp;she died at Ipswich, her native city, at the advanced age of&nbsp;seventy-eight years, and was buried in the churchyard of&nbsp;St Stephens, according to her particular direction. Such&nbsp;are the only particulars that have been collected concerning this accomplished and excellent woman ; and, in their&nbsp;simplicity, the reader may remark that of her life and her&nbsp;character. The following critical observations, confined entirely to her most celebrated work, which first established&nbsp;her fame, and upon which alone it will in all probability&nbsp;rest, are extracted from the biographical notice of Miss&nbsp;Reeve by Sir Walter Scott, to which we have also been in-*&nbsp;debted for the foregoing particulars of her life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ The authoress has herself informed us that The Old English Baron is the * literary offspring of The Castle of&nbsp;Otranto ;’ and she has obliged us by pointing out the different and more limited view which she had adopted, of the&nbsp;supernatural machinery employed by Horace Walpole. She&nbsp;condemns the latter for the extravagance of several of his&nbsp;conceptions; for the gigantic size of his sword and helmet;&nbsp;and for the violent fictions of a walking picture, and a skeleton in a hermit’s cowl. A ghost, she contends, to be admitted as an ingredient in romance, must behave himself&nbsp;like ghosts of sober demeanour, and subject himself to the&nbsp;common rules still preserved in grange and hall, as circumscribing beings of his description.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
