June is the time oi flowering, and the flowers are ſucceeded by a ſmall fruit, ſur-roundedby a membrane. " This plant (ſays Hanbury) is undoubtedly the ſort oſ which the crown oſ thorns ſor our Bleffed Saviour was compoſed. The branches are very pliant, and the ſpines oſ it are at every joint ſtrong and ſharp. It grows naturally about Jeruſalem, as well as in many parts of Judæa ; and there is no doubt that the barbarous Jews would make choice oſ it ſor their cruel purpoſe. But what farther confirms the truth oſ theſe thorns being then uſed, are the an-cieut pictures oſ our Bleffed Saviour’s crucifixion. The thorns oſ the crown on his head exactly anſwer to thoſe oſ this tree ; and there is great reaſon to ſuppoſe theſe were taken ſrom the. earlieſt paintings oſ tlie Lord oſ Life : and even now our modern painters copy ſrom tliem, and repreſent the crown as compoſed oſ theſe thorns. Thefe plants, therefore, ſhonld principally liave a ſhare in thoſe parts of tlie plantation that are more peculiarly deſigned ſor religious retirement ; for tliey will prove excellent monitors, and conduce to due reflection on and gratitude to ‘ Him who hath loved us, and lias waſhed us from our fuis,” &amp;c.</p><p>7.    The common alaternus is an evergreen tree, and native of the ſouth of Europe. There are ſeveral varieties of this ſpecies ; the moſt remarkable of which are the broad-leaved and tbe jagged-leaved alaternus, which have all been confounded with the phillyrea.</p><p>8.    The inſectorius, or narrow-leaved buckthorn, is an evergreen ſhrub or tree, and native of Spain. It grows to the height of 10 or 12 feet, and fends forth ſeveral branches from the bottom to the top. They are co-vered with a blackiſh or dark-coloured bark, and each ©f them is terminated by a long ſharp thorn. The fruit continues on the trees all winter, making a beautiful appearance among the narrow-cluttered leaves at that ſeaſon.</p><p>9.    The oleoides, or olive-leaved buckthorn, is an evergreen ſhrub, and native of Spain, and grows to the height oſ 8 or 1 o ſeet. It fends forth numerous branclies, each of which is terminated by a long ſharp ſpine. The flowers are ſmall, of a whitiſh green colour, and are ſuc-ceeded by round black berries.</p><p>RHAMPHASTOS, in ornithology, a genus be-longing to the order of picae. The bill is very large, and ſerrated outwardly. The noſtrils are ſituated behind the baſe of the beak ; and in moſt of the ſpecies the feet aie toed, and placed two forwards and two backwards. The tongue is long, narrow, and feathered on the edges. Mr Latham enumerates 15 diſſcrent ſpecies ; of which the toucans are the moſt remarkable, and were formerly divided into four or ſive varieties, though Mr Latham makes them diſtinct fpecies, of which we ſhali only defcribe that called the red-beaked toucan.</p><p>This bird is about the ſize of a jackdaw, and of a ſimilar ſhape, with a large head to ſupport its monſtrous bill : this bill, from the angles of the mouth to its point, is ſix inches and an half ; and its breadth in the thickeſt part is a little more than two. Its thickneſs near the head is one inch and a quarter ; and it is a little rounded along the top of the upper chap, the under ſide. being round alſo ; the whole of the bill extremely flight, and a little thicker tlian parchment. The upper chap is of a bright yellow, except on each ſide, which is of a fine ſearlet colour ; as is alfo the lower chap, except at the baſe, which is purple. Between the head and the bill there is a black liRe of ſeparation all round the baſe of the bill ; in the upper part of which the noſtrils are placed, and are almoſt covered with feathers ; which has occaſioned ſome writers to ſay that the toucan has no noſtrils. Round the eyes, on each ſide of the head, is a ſpace of bluiſh ſkin, void of feathers ; above which the head is black, except a white ſpot on each ſide joining to the baſe of the, upper chap. The hinder part of the neck, the back, wings, tail, belly, and thighs, are black. The under ſide of the head, throat, and the beginning of the breaſt, are white. Between the white on the breaſt, and the black on the belly, is a ſpace of red feathers, in the form of a new moon, with its horns upwards. The legs, ſeet, and claws, are of an aſh-colour ; and the toes ſtand like thoſe of parrots, two before and two behind.</p><p>It is reported by travellers, that this bird, though ſurniſhed with fo formidable a beak, is harmleſs and. gentle, being ſo eaſily made tame as to ſit and hatch its young in houſes. It ſeeds chiefly upon pepper, which it devours very greedily, gorging itſelf in ſuch a manner that it voids it crude and unconcocted. T'his, however, is no objection to the natives from uſing it again : they even prefer it before that pepper which is freſh gathered from the tree ; and ſeem perſuaded that the ſtiength and heat of the pepper is qualified by the bird, and that all its noxious qualities are thus ex-hauſted.</p><p>whatever be the truth of this report, nothing is more certain than that the toucan lives only upon a vegetable diet ; and, in a domeſtic ſtate, to which it is frequently brought in the warm countries where it is bred, it is ſeen to prefer ſuch food to all other. Pozzo, who bred one tame, afferts, that it leaped up and down, wagged the tail, and cried with a voice reſembling that of a magpie. It fed upon the fame things that parrots do; but was moſt greedy of grapes, which, being plucked off one by one, and thrown in the air, it would moſt dexterouſly catch before they ſell to the ground. Its bill, he adds, was hollow, and upon that account very light, ſo that it had but little ſtrength in fo apparently formidable a weapon ; nor could it peck or ſtrike ſmartly therewith. But its tongue ſeemed to affiſt the efforts of this unwieldy machine : it was long, thin, and flat, not unlike one of the feathers on the neck of a dunghill cock ; this it moved up and down, and often extended ſive or ſix inches from the bill. It was of a fleſh colour, and remarkably fringed on each ſide with very fmall ſilaments.. exactly reſembling a feather.</p><p>It is probable that tliis long tongue has greater ſtrength than the thin hollow beak that contains it. It is likely that the beak is only a kind of ſheath ſor this peculiar inſtrument, uſed by the toucan, not only in making itſelf a neſt, but alfo in obtaining its pro-viſion. Nothing is more certain, than that this bird builds its ueſt in holes of trees, which have been pre-</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
