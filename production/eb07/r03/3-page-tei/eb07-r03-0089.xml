These acquisitions altogethercomprehend a superficies of 154,000 square versts, which is about twice the size of England without Wales. The whole is considered an integral part of the empire, and as such is administered by Russian authorities. But besides these provinces, Russia claims a protectorate over Mingrelia, Abassa or Abhasia, the Lesghian tribes, and several principalities of Daghestan. Some of these countries are entirely under Russian influence ; but in Abhasia,<hi rend="sub"> </hi>even according to Russian writers, it is merely nominal. The following statistical table is from a work composed and published in St Petersburg in 1836 by supreme authority.</p><table><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"/><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>Houses.</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>Male Inhabitants.</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>1.

Its geographical position appears to us the happiest possible for such a power, prosecuting gigantic schemes of commercial intercourse or territorial aggrandisement. Climate, soil, natural capabilities, situation, and political relations, all prove that, whatever it has cost Russia to acquire and maintain her Transcaucasian dominions, their value, which as yet is only developed to a small extent, justifies her policy. A commission was appointed in 1828 to draw up a statistical account of these provinces, the labours of which body terminated in 1835. The following is a brief abstract of the results of their investigations, derived from the official sources.</p><p>1.    <hi rend="italic">Silh.</hi>  The cultivation of mulberry trees is in a very backward state, although the tax levied upon them was abolished in 1830. The whole annual export does not exceed 15,530 poods.</p><p>2.    <hi rend="italic">Cotton.</hi>  The natural capabilities of the country offer a possibility of increasing the production of this valuable commodity to an immense extent ; but its cultivation has greatly decreased since the district where it is chiefly raised passed from the hands of Persia to those of Russia. The whole export amounts annually only to 36,000 poods, of very inferior quality.</p><p>3.    <hi rend="italic">Wine.</hi>  The vine is indigenous to these regions, and presents a great variety of kinds. The vineyards are numerous and rich, the country being well adapted for the cultivation of the plant. There are produced annually about 3,888,000 vedros of wine, and 140,000 vedros of brandy. The district of TeIav alone furnishes to this quota 2,000,000 vedros of wine, and 140 vedros of brandy. Imeretia is not included in this estimate. This quantity of wine and brandy is entirely absorbed by the internal consumption, which is immense. The production of wine of various kinds and most excellent quality might be prosecuted to an extent which might render Russia independent of foreign importations of the article.</p><p>4.    <hi rend="italic">Rice.</hi>  The cultivation of this plant has not improved since the establishment of the Russians in the country. There is an annual produce, however, of about 130,000 chetwerts.</p><p>5.    <hi rend="italic">Saffron.</hi>  The province of Bacoo alone produces yearly 1000 poods of saffron, which shows to what an extent this valuable branch of agricultural industry might be carried.</p><p>The article has hitherto been very ill prepared, but efforts are making to improve the management of it.</p><p>6.    <hi rend="italic">Madder.</hi>  This article is produced in great quantities at Derbend, and other places along the shores of the Caspian Sea.</p><p>7.    <hi rend="italic">Cochineal.</hi>  The Armenian or southern parts of the Transcaucasian provinces produce a kind of cochineal, which is said to yield a dye equal to that of Mexico. The Russian government is doing every thing in her power to extend this new and profitable branch of productive industry.</p><p>8.    <hi rend="italic">Live Stock.</hi>  Extensive herds might be reared in these provinces, which afford great facilities for their maintenance. Great numbers of sheep and cattle are indeed raised, but the wool of the one is bad, and the breed of the other is inferior. But there can be little doubt that Merino sheep will be successfully introduced into this quarter. There is a fine race of horses, and an abundance of camels, asses, mules, and swine.</p><p>The natural capabilities of these provinces are very great, affording facilities for the production of the most valuable commodities, which are exclusively furnished by southern climates. These have only been developed to a partial extent ; but the Russian government is displaying such laudable zeal to encourage such branches of industry as are peculiarly adapted for the various districts of her vast possessions, that by and by she will be independent of what are called colonial goods, silk, cotton, and the like. The provinces, however, are greatly depressed by a system of most vexatious and unequally levied imposts. These have not been laid on by Russia ; they owe their origin to the rapacity of the various petty tyrants who formerly ruled the different parts of this region. Free commerce was permitted to the provinces in 1821, and they soon began to reap great advantages from this liberal system. But it was abolished in 1832, probably because the additional revenue which accrued from it was not a sufficient compensation for such an interference with the general system of Russian policy.</p><p>This is not the place to enter into the great and important question relative to the influence which Russia is likely to exercise over the East, by thus firmly establishing her dominion beyond the Caucasus. Although the maintenance of the provinces costs her yearly L.16,000, the revenue being about L.216,000 and the expenditure about L.232,000, yet, by placing the resources of the country under proper management, the former might be increased to a vast extent. But this is of comparatively little moment compared with two other objects of her far-sighted policy, which will be promoted by rendering the Caucasian isthmus a commercial country, securely incorporated with the rest of the empire. These are the creation of a manufacturing industry, which will make her independent of other countries, Particularly of England, and the establishment of her power in Asia, whence great advantages are not unreasonably expected. Now these provinces will at once supply the raw material necessary for manufactures, and at the same time open a market for them in the east. It is true, that the Caucasian Mountains almost totally sever this limb from the great body of the empire, the passes of Mozdac being difficult, and the country at the same time infested with predatory hordes. But there are other and much more eligible means of communication, viz. the Caspian Sea on the east, and the Black Sea on the west. Over the former Russia reigns paramount, no other vessels of war but her own being allowed to navigate its waters. Into this vast reservoir the Volga, which is the great artery of Russia, pours its waters, collected during a navigable course of two thousand miles, through some of the most fertile regions of the empire, and, including its tributaries, those most distinguished for manufacturing industry, which is the main object. There is also a communication between this noble stream and the</p></body></text></TEI>
