        <p><span class="font2">receiving the two Spains and Africa, and Crassus Syria.@@<sup>1
                </sup>The coalition now divided between them the control of&nbsp;the empire. For the
                future the question was, how long the&nbsp;coalition itself would last. Its duration
                proved to be&nbsp;short. In 53 Crassus was defeated and slain by the&nbsp;Parthians
                at Carrhæ, and in Rome the course of events&nbsp;slowly forced Pompey into an
                attitude of hostility to&nbsp;Cæsar. The year 51 brought with it a renewal of
                the&nbsp;riotous anarchy which had disgraced Rome in 58-57.&nbsp;Conscious of its
                own helplessness, the senate, with the&nbsp;eager assent of all respectable
                citizens, dissuaded Pompey&nbsp;from leaving Italy. His provinces were left to his
                legates,&nbsp;and he himself remained at home to maintain order by&nbsp;the weight
                of his influence. It was a confession that the&nbsp;republic could not stand alone.
                But Pompey’s mere&nbsp;presence proved insufficient. The anarchy and
                confusion&nbsp;grew worse, and even strict constitutionalists like
                Cicero&nbsp;talked of the necessity of investing Pompey with some&nbsp;extraordinary
                powers for the preservation of order.@@<sup>2</sup> At&nbsp;last in 52 he was
                elected sole consul, and not only so, but&nbsp;his provincial command was prolonged
                for five years&nbsp;more, and fresh troops were assigned him.@@<sup>3</sup> The rôle
                of&nbsp;“ saviour of society ” thus thrust upon Pompey was one&nbsp;which flattered
                his vanity, but it entailed consequences&nbsp;which it is probable he did not
                foresee, for it brought&nbsp;him into close alliance with the senate, and in the
                senate&nbsp;there was a powerful party who were resolved to force him&nbsp;into
                heading the attack they could not successfully make&nbsp;withβut him upon Cæsar. It
                was known that the latter,&nbsp;whose command expired in March 49, but who in
                the&nbsp;ordinary course of things would not have been replaced&nbsp;by his
                successor until January 48, was anxious to be&nbsp;allowed to stand for his second
                consulship in the autumn&nbsp;of 49 without coming in person to Rome.@@<sup>4</sup>
                His opponents&nbsp;in the senate were equally bent on bringing his command&nbsp;to
                an end at the legal time, and so obliging him to disband his troops and stand for
                the consulship as a private&nbsp;person, or, if he kept his command, on preventing
                his&nbsp;standing for the consulship. Through 51 and 50 the&nbsp;discussions in the
                senate and the negotiations with Cæsar&nbsp;continued, but with no result. On lst
                January 49 Cæsar&nbsp;made a last offer of compromise. The senate replied
                by&nbsp;requiring him on pain of outlawry to disband his legions.&nbsp;Two tribunes
                who supported him were ejected from the&nbsp;senate house, and the magistrates with
                Pompey were&nbsp;authorized to take measures to protect the republic.&nbsp;Cæsar
                hesitated no longer ; he crossed the Rubicon and&nbsp;<sup>e</sup> invaded Italy.
                The rapidity of his advance astounded&nbsp;and bewildered his foes. Pompey, followed
                by the&nbsp;consuls, by the majority of the senate and a long train of&nbsp;nobles,
                abandoned Italy as untenable, and crossed into</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">Greece.@@<sup>5</sup> At the end of March Cæsar entered Rome as the
                master of Italy. The story of the civil war which&nbsp;followed, down to the victory
                at Munda in the spring of&nbsp;45, has been told elsewhere.@@<sup>6</sup> We are
                concerned here&nbsp;with the work which Cæsar achieved in the brief
            intervals</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">The task which Cæsar had to perform was no easy one. It came upon him
                suddenly ; for there is no sufficient&nbsp;reason to believe that Cæsar had long
                premeditated&nbsp;revolution, or that he had previously aspired to
                anything&nbsp;more than such a position as that which Pompey had&nbsp;already won, a
                position unrepublican indeed, but accepted&nbsp;by republicans as
                    inevitable.@@<sup>7</sup> War was forced upon him&nbsp;as the alternative to
                political suicide, but success in war&nbsp;brought the responsibilities of nearly
                absolute power, and&nbsp;Cæsar’s genius must be held to have shown itself in
                the&nbsp;masterly fashion in which he grasped the situation, rather&nbsp;than in the
                supposed sagacity with which he is said to&nbsp;have foreseen and prepared for it.
                In so far as he failed,&nbsp;his failure was mainly due to the fact that his tenure
                of&nbsp;power was too short for the work which he was required&nbsp;to perform. From
                the very first moment when Pompey’s&nbsp;ignominious retreat left him master of
                Italy, he made it&nbsp;clear that he was neither a second Sulla nor even
                the&nbsp;reckless anarchist which many believed him to be.@@<sup>8</sup>
                The&nbsp;Roman and Italian public were first startled by the&nbsp;masterly rapidity
                and energy of his movements, and then&nbsp;agreeably surprised by his lenity and
                moderation. No&nbsp;proscriptions or confiscations followed his victories, and
                all&nbsp;his acts evinced an unmistakable desire to effect a sober&nbsp;and
                reasonable settlement of the pressing questions of the&nbsp;hour ; of this, and of
                his almost superhuman energy, the&nbsp;long list of measures he carried out or
                planned is sufficient&nbsp;proof. The “ children of the proscribed ” were at
                length&nbsp;restored to their rights,@@<sup>9</sup> and with them many of
                    the&nbsp;refugees@@<sup>lθ</sup> who had found shelter in Cæsar’s camp
                during&nbsp;the two or three years immediately preceding the war ;&nbsp;but the
                extreme men among his supporters soon realized&nbsp;that their hopes of “novae
                tabulae” and grants of land&nbsp;were illusory. In allotting lands to his veterans,
                Cæsar&nbsp;carefully avoided any disturbance of existing owners
                    and&nbsp;occupiers,@@<sup>11</sup> and the mode in which he dealt with
                the&nbsp;economic crisis produced by the war seems to have satisfied&nbsp;all
                reasonable men.@@<sup>12</sup> It had been a common charge against&nbsp;Cæsar in
                former days that he paid excessive court to the&nbsp;populace of Rome, and now that
                he was master he still&nbsp;dazzled and delighted them by the splendour of the
                spectacles he provided, and by the liberality of his largesses.&nbsp;But he was no
                indiscriminate flatterer of the mob. The&nbsp;popular clubs and guilds which had
                helped to organize the&nbsp;anarchy of the last few years were
                    dissolved.@@<sup>13</sup> A strict&nbsp;inquiry was made into the distribution
                of the monthly doles&nbsp;of corn, and the number of recipients was reduced by
                    one&nbsp;half;@@<sup>14</sup> finally, the position of the courts of justice was
                raised&nbsp;by the abolition of the popular element among the
                    judices.@@<sup>15&nbsp;</sup>Nor did Cæsar shrink from the attempt, in which so
                many&nbsp;had failed before him, to mitigate the twin evils which were&nbsp;ruining
                the prosperity of Italy,—the concentration of a</span></p>
