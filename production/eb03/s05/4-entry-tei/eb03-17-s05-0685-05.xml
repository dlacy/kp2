in grammar, that part of orthography which teaches the true manner of reſolving words into their syllables.</p><p>All words are either simple or compound, as <hi rend="italic">use, diſuſe ; done, undone ;</hi> and the rules for dividing each must be ſuch as are derived from the analogy of language in general, or from the establiſhed custom of ſpeaking ; which, for the Engliſh language, are reduced to the following rules : 1. A conſonant between two vowels must be joined with the latter in ſpelling, as <hi rend="italic">nature, ve-ri-ly, ge-ne-rοus ;</hi> except, however, the letter <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> which is joined to the first, as <hi rend="italic">in flux-en, ox- en,</hi> &amp;c, and compound words, as in <hi rend="italic">up-on, un-uſed,</hi> &amp;c.</p><p>2. A double conſonant must be divided, as in <hi rend="italic">let-ter, man-ner,</hi> &amp;c. 3. Thoſe conſonants which can begin</p><p>a word must not be parted in ſpelling, as in <hi rend="italic">de-fraud,</hi><pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0692.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s05-0686"/>
<hi rend="italic">re-prove, di-stinct</hi>; however, this rule is found sometimes to fail ; for though <hi rend="italic">gn</hi> begins a word, as <hi rend="italic">gnaw, gnat,</hi> &amp;c. yet it must be divided in ſpelling, as in <hi rend="italic">cog- ni-zance, ma-lig-ni-ty, &amp;.C.</hi> 4. Thoſe conſonants which</p><p>cannot begin a word muſt be divided, as <hi rend="italic">ld</hi> in s <hi rend="italic">eldom, It</hi> in <hi rend="italic">mul-ti-tude, mp</hi> in <hi rend="italic">tem-per, rd in ar-dent</hi>; but in final ſyllables there are exceptions, as <hi rend="italic">tl</hi> in <hi rend="italic">ti-tle, dl</hi> in <hi rend="italic">handle,</hi> &amp;c. 5. When two vowels come together, and are</p><p>both of them diſtinctly founded, they must be ſeparated in ſpelling, as in <hi rend="italic">co-e-val, mu-tu-al,</hi> &amp;c. 6. The gram</p><p>matical terminations or endings muſt be ſeparated in ſpelling, as <hi rend="italic">ed</hi> in w <hi rend="italic">ing-ed, edst</hi> in <hi rend="italic">de-li-ver-edst, ing</hi> in <hi rend="italic">bear-ing, once</hi> in <hi rend="italic">de-li-ver-ance,</hi> &amp;c. 7. Compound words muſt be reſolved into their ſimple or component words, as <hi rend="italic">up-on, in-to, ne-ver-the-less, nοt-with-stand- ing,</hi> &amp;c.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
