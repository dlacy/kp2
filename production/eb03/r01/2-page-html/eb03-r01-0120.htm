<body><a name="caption1"></a><h3><span class="font0">ciple over and above is neceffary to excite our induſtry, and to prevent our ſtopping ſhort in the middle of the&nbsp;courſe.</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">V7e need not loſe time to defcribe the co-operation of the foregoing propenſity with ſnrpriſe, in producing&nbsp;the effect that follows any unuſual reſemblance or diſ-ſimilitude. Surpriſe firſt operates, and carries our opinion of the reſemblance or diſſimilitude beyond truth.&nbsp;The propenfity we have been deſcribing carries us ſtill&nbsp;farther ; for i.t forces upon the mind a conviction, that&nbsp;the reſemblance or diſſimilitude is complete. λVe need&nbsp;no better illuſtration, than the reſemblance that is fancied in ſome pebbles to a tree or an infect ; which reſemblance, however faint in reality, is conceived to be&nbsp;wonderfully perfect. The tendency to complete a reſemblance acting jointly with ſurpriſe, carries the mind&nbsp;ſometimes ſo far, as even to preſume upon future events.&nbsp;In the Greek tragedy entitled </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Phimides,</span><span class="font1"> thoſe unhappy women feeing the place where it was intended they&nbsp;fhould be ſlain, cried out with anguiſh, &quot; They now&nbsp;faw their cruel deſtiny bad condemned them to die in&nbsp;that place, being the fame where they had been expo-fed in their infancy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The propenfity to advance every thing to its perfection, not only co-operates with ſurpriſe to deceive the mind, but of itſelf is able to produce that effect,&nbsp;of this we ſee many iuſtances where there is no place&nbsp;for ſurpriſe ; and the firſt we ſhall give is of reſem-blance. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Unumquodque eodem modo dijſolvitur quo colh-gatum eβ,</span><span class="font1"> is a maxim in the Roman law that has no&nbsp;foundation in truth ; for tying and loôfing, building&nbsp;and demoliſhſhg, are acts oppofite to each other, and&nbsp;are performed by oppofite means : but when tbeſe acts&nbsp;are connected by their relation to the fame ſubject,&nbsp;their connection leads us to imagine a fort of reſem-blance between them, which by tbe foregoing propen-ſity is conceived to be as complete as poſſible. The&nbsp;next inſtance ſhall be of contraſt. Addiſon obferves,&nbsp;&quot; That the paleſt features look the moſt agreeable in&nbsp;white ; that a face which is oveiſtuſhed appears to advantage in the deepeſt ſcarlet ; and that a dark complexion is not a little alleviated by a black hood.”&nbsp;The foregoing propenfity ſerves to account for theſe&nbsp;appearances ; to make this evident, one of the caſes&nbsp;ſhall ſuſſice. A complexion, however dark, never ap-proaches to black : when thefe colours appear together, their oppofition ſtrikes us; and the. propenfity&nbsp;we have to complete the oppofition, makes the dark-neſs of complexion vaniſh out of fight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The operation of this propenfity, even where there ' is no ground for furpriſe, is not confined to opinion or&nbsp;conviction : fo powerful it is, as to make us fometimes&nbsp;proceed to action, in orde¢ to complete a reſemblance&nbsp;or diſſimilitude. If this appear obſcure, it will be&nbsp;made clear by the following inſtance. Upon what&nbsp;principle is the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lex talionis</span><span class="font1"> founded, other than to make&nbsp;the puniſhment referable the miſchief? Reafon dic-tates, that there ought to be a conformity or refem-blance between a crime and its puniſhment ; and the&nbsp;foregoing propenfity impels us to make the reſemblance as complete as poſſible. Titus Livſhs J∣, under&nbsp;the influence of that propenfity, accounts for a certain&nbsp;puniſhment by a reſemblance between it and the crime,&nbsp;too ſubtile for common apprehcnſion. Speaking of</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Mettus Fuffetius, the Alban general, who, for treachery to the Romans his alliés, was ſentenced to be torn to pieces by horſes, he puts the following ſpeech&nbsp;in the mouth of Tullus Hoſtilius, who decreed the puniſhment. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">&quot; Mette Fuffeû, inquit, ſi ipſe dijeere p<sup>r</sup>ffβs ~,&nbsp;fidem ac fœdera ſervare, vivo tibi ea diſciplina a me adhibita&nbsp;effet. Nunc, quoniam tuum infanabile ingenium eβ, at tu&nbsp;tno fupplicio doce humanum genus ea fan id a credere, qux&nbsp;a te violata ſunt. Ut igitur paulo ante animum inter Fi-denatem Romanamque rem ancipιtem geβffβi, itajam corpus -paffim d'βrahendum dabis.”</span><span class="font1"> By the ſame influence, the&nbsp;ſentence is often executed upon the very fpot where&nbsp;the crime was committed. In the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Plectra</span><span class="font1"> of Sophocles, Egiſtheus is dragged from the theatre into an inner room of the ſuppofed palace, to fuffer death where&nbsp;he murdered Agamemnon. Shakeſpeare, whoſe knowledge of nature is not leſs profound than extenfive, has&nbsp;not overlooked this propenfity :</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">&quot; Othello.</span><span class="font1"> Get me ſome poiſon, Iago, this night. I’ll not expoſtulate with her, leſt her body and her&nbsp;beauty unprovide my mind again. This night, Iago.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">&quot; Iago.</span><span class="font1"> Do it not with poiſon ; ſtrangle her in her bed, even in the bed ſhe hath contaminated.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“ Othello.</span><span class="font1"> Good, good : the juſtice of it pleafes : very good.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Othello, act A<sub>t</sub>∙fc∙ ξ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Perſons in their laſt moments are generally ſeized with an anxiety to be buried with their relations. In the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Amynta</span><span class="font1"> of Taffo, the lover, hearing that his miſtreſs&nbsp;was torn to pieces by a wolf, expreffes a deſire to die&nbsp;tbe ſame death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Upon the ſubject in general we have two remarks to add. Tlie firſt. concerns reſemblance, which, when&nbsp;too entire, hath no effect, however different in kind the&nbsp;things compared may be. The remark is applicable&nbsp;to works of art only ; for natural objects of different&nbsp;kinds have ſcarce ever an entire reſemblance. To give&nbsp;an example in a work of art : Marble is a fort of matter&nbsp;very different ſrom what compoſes an animal ; and&nbsp;marble cut into a human figure, produces great plea-ſure by the reſemblance : but if a marble ſtatue be co-loured like a picture, the reſemblance is ſo entire as at&nbsp;a diftance to make the ſtatue appear a real perſon : we&nbsp;diſcover the miſtake when we approach ; and no other&nbsp;emotion is raiſed, but ſurpriſe occaſioned by thc de-ception : the figure ſtill appears a real perſon, rather&nbsp;than an imitation ; and we muſt uſe reflection to correct&nbsp;the miſtake. This cannot happen in a picture ; for the&nbsp;reſemblance can never be ſo entire as to diſguiſe the&nbsp;imitation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The other remark belongs to contraſt. Emotion3 make the greateſt figure when contraſted in ſucceſſion ;&nbsp;but then the ſucceſſion ought neither to be rapid, nor&nbsp;immoderately flow : if too flow, the effect of contraſt&nbsp;becomes faint by the diſtance of the emotions ; and if&nbsp;rapid, no ſtngle emotion has room to expand itſelf to&nbsp;. its full fize, but is ſtiſted, as it were, in the birth by&nbsp;a ſucceeding emotion. The funeral oration of the biſhop of Meux upon the ducheſs of Qrleans, is a perfect hodge-podge of cheerful and melancholy reprefeπ-tations, following each other in the quickeſt ſucceſſion :&nbsp;oppofite emotions are belt felt in ſucceſſion ; but each&nbsp;emotion feparately ſſiould be raiſed to its due pitch,&nbsp;before another be introduced..</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
