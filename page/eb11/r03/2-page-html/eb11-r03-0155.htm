<p><span class="font1">ROCK-CRYSTAL, a colourless and transparent variety of quartz </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.),</span><span class="font1"> used as an ornamental stone. It usually occurs as&nbsp;crystals lining cavities in quartz-veins, which often run through&nbsp;granite, gneiss and crystalline schists. The limpidity of the&nbsp;crystal, its coldness to the touch and its common occurrence&nbsp;in rocks among Alpine glaciers, led to the ancient belief that it&nbsp;was a kind of congealed water, whence the name crystal, from&nbsp;Gr. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">KpuaraWos</span><span class="font1"> (ice). In the Swiss Alps the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“Strahler”</span><span class="font1"> or crystal -gatherer, searches the rocks at much personal risk, and is often&nbsp;led to a drusy cavity by tracing narrow veins, or strings, of&nbsp;quartz on the mountain-side. A remarkable druse, or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Kry-stalkeller,</span><span class="font1"> discovered at Zinkenstock in the Bernese Oberland,&nbsp;in 1719, yielded about 20 tons of crystal, a single specimen&nbsp;weighing 8 cwt. The famous discovery of the Galenstock, in&nbsp;1867, furnished magnificent crystals, but they were dark brown&nbsp;or smoky quartz. La Gardette, near Le Bourg dOisans, in the&nbsp;Alps of Dauphiné, is a notable locality for fine specimens of&nbsp;rock-crystal. The Alps and India probably furnished the&nbsp;ancients with their supplies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rock-crystal has been used for ornamental purposes since the Mycenean period. By the Romans under the Empire it&nbsp;was highly valued, and carved into vases and goblets, in some&nbsp;cases elaborately engraved. Lenses or globes were used for&nbsp;kindling the sacred vestal fire and for cauterizing the flesh,&nbsp;whilst ladies carried balls of crystal in order to cool their&nbsp;hands during the heat of summer. The artists of the Early&nbsp;Renaissance greatly favoured the use of rock-crystal, and&nbsp;executed beautiful carvings in this material. In modern times&nbsp;the use of rock-crystal has been largely superseded by that of&nbsp;glass, and it is notable that flint-glass is known in France as&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“ cristal”</span><span class="font1"> probably from its resemblance to Umpid quartz, or&nbsp;perhaps from the fact that powdered rock-crystal has been used&nbsp;as a source of silica in the manufacture of the finest glass. Rock-crystal is still cut as a faceted stone for personal decoration, but&nbsp;though not without brilhancy it lacks the “ fire ” of many gemstones. It is often known locally by such names as Bristol&nbsp;diamond, Cornish diamond, Isle of Wight diamond, Briançon&nbsp;diamond, Marmaros diamond, Lake George diamond, &amp;c.&nbsp;Rock-crystal is also carved into seals, paper-weights and other&nbsp;trivial objects, and into spheres for divination by crystal-gazing, Japanese balls being specially noteworthy. In Japan&nbsp;the crystal has been obtained for centuries from the granitic&nbsp;districts around Kimpü-san, in the province of Kai. Probably&nbsp;the most valuable application of rock-crystal is for spectacle&nbsp;lenses, which in consequence of their hardness are not readily&nbsp;abraded by use. They should be cut at right angles to the optic&nbsp;axis, or axis of the prism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The “ pebble ” for lenses is found loose in the soil in many parts of the provinces of Goyaz, Sao Paulo and Minas Gcracs in Brazil.&nbsp;Much of the material for spectacles comes also from Madagascar,&nbsp;where large crystals of clear quartz are found in the beds of certain&nbsp;streams, especially in the N.E. part of the island, having probably</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">been derived from quartz-veins in the gneiss and. pegmatite, ln India rock-crystal has been worked at many localities, and the&nbsp;loot of the palace of Delhi yielded marvellous ornaments carved in&nbsp;this material. At the present day it is cut and polished at VclIum&nbsp;in the Tanjore district in Madras, and is known as VelIum stone.&nbsp;Among the numerous localities in the United States which yield&nbsp;rock-crystal mention may be made of those in Herkimcr Co., New&nbsp;York State, whence the Lake George crystals are obtained; and it&nbsp;is notable that some of the Herkimer quartz encloses bituminous&nbsp;matter. Mokelumne Hill, Calaveras Co., California, has Iurnisheil&nbsp;some remarkable rock-crystal. In Europe the localities are very&nbsp;numerous, the most important being those in the Alps. Very fine&nbsp;crystals remarkable for pcllucidity though not of large size occur&nbsp;in cavities in the statuary marble of Carrara; ancf remarkably&nbsp;hollowed crystals arc known from Porretta near Bologna in ltaly.&nbsp;The finest rock-crystal in Great Britain occurs at Tintagcl and&nbsp;the Delabolc slate quarry in N. Cornwall; and at Snowdon in&nbsp;N. Wales.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(F. W. R.*)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ROCKEFELLER, JOHN DAVISON </span><span class="font1">(1839- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;), American</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">capitaUst, was bom in Richford, Tioga county, New York, on the 8th of July 1839. I<sup>n</sup> 1853 his family removed to Ohio,&nbsp;living after 1857 in Cleveland, where Rockefeller had begun to&nbsp;work as a bookkecper in 1855 and where in 1858 he went into the&nbsp;produce commission business. His firm, Clark &amp; Rockefeller,&nbsp;in 1862 invested in an oil refinery, planned by Samuel Andrews,&nbsp;and in 1865 Rockefeller sold out his share to his partner Clark,&nbsp;bought for $72,500 a larger share in another refinery, and formed&nbsp;the partnership of Rockefeller &amp; Andrews. At about the same&nbsp;time another refinery was started by Rockefeller’s brother&nbsp;William (b. 1841), but in 1867 Rockefeller Andrews absorbed&nbsp;this business, and Henry M. Flagler was added to the partnership, In 1870 the two Rockefellers, Flagler, Andrews and a&nbsp;refiner named Stephen V. Harkness formed the Standard Oil&nbsp;Company, with a capital of $1,000,000 (increased in 1872 to&nbsp;$2,500,000 and in 1874 to $3,500,000), of which John D. Rockefeller was president. This great corporation gradually established itself in practical control of the oil production in America,&nbsp;by means of business methods and financial operations which have&nbsp;been severely criticized, but which brought immense wealth to&nbsp;those concerned. Its capital was further increased in 1882,&nbsp;when separate companies were organized in each state; and in&nbsp;later years, as the first great American “ trust,” the Standard&nbsp;Oil Company was hotly attacked during the anti-trust movement (see </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Inter-state Commerce).</span><span class="font1"> Into the merits of this&nbsp;question it is impossible to enter here. Rockefeller himself&nbsp;retired from active business in 1895; he had for a time large iron&nbsp;interests (mines and ore-carrying vessels) on Lake Superior,&nbsp;which he sold to the United States Steel Corporation, and his&nbsp;personal wcalth was probably greater than that of any other man&nbsp;in the country. In private Ufe he was a devoted member of&nbsp;the Baptist church, and his benefactions were numerous. To&nbsp;“ the University of Chicago founded by John D. Rockefeller ”&nbsp;(in 1892) he had given, up to 1910, $24,809,666, while to the&nbsp;‘General Education Board he had given $43,000,000; he founded&nbsp;(1901) and supported the Rockefeller Institute for Medical&nbsp;Research in New York City; he gave large sums to Rush '&nbsp;Medical College in Chicago, to Johns Hopkins Hospital in&nbsp;Baltimore, to Barnard College in New York City and to the&nbsp;Baptist Missionary Society; and in 1909 he gave $1,000,000 to&nbsp;endow a medical commission to investigate the nature of the&nbsp;hook-worm and to suppress the hook-worm disease.</span></p>
