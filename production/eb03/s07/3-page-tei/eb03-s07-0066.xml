Paſſing the frith, Guſtavus ſtormed Wolgaſt and another ſtrong fortreſs in the neighbourhood, leaving general Bannier with a garriſon for the defence of theſe conqueſts. He then proceeded to Stetin ; which was no ſooner inveſted than it conſented to receive a Swediſh garriſon, and the king perſuaded the duke of Pomerania to enter into an alliance with him. In conſequence of this the Swediſh troops were received into ſeveral towns of Pomerania ; and the moſt bitter enmity took place between the Imperialiſts and Pomeranians, each refusing the other quarter.</p><p>Theſe ſucceſſes of Guſtavus ſtruck the empire with consternation ; for being already overwhelmed with civil diſſenſions, they were in no condition to reſiſt ſo impetuous an enemy. At this time alſo the Imperialiſts were without a general, the command of the army being diſpnted by a number of candidates of very unequal merit ; but at laſt count Tilly was fixed upon as the moſt proper perſon, and inveſted with the dignity of Veldt Mariſchal. In the mean time the king being reinforced by a conſiderable body of troops in Finland and Livonia under the conduct of Guſtavus Horn, defeated the Imperialiſts before Griffenhagen; taking the place ſoon after by aſſault. By this and ſome other conqueſts he opened a paſſage into Luſatia and Sileſia ; but in the mean time count Tilly cut off 2000 Swedes at New Brandenburg, owing to the obſtinacy of their commander Kniphausen, who had orders to evacuate the place and join the main army. This advantage, however, was ſoon overbalanced by the conqueſt of Franckfort on the Oder, which Guſtavus took by aſſault, making the whole garriſon priſoners. Thus he commanded the rivers Elbe and Oder on both ſides, and had a fair paſſage not only to the countries already mentioned, but alſo to Saxony and the hereditary dominions of the houſe of Auſtria. Soon after this, Guſtavus laid ſiege to Landſberg, which he took by aſſault ; though the number of ſoldiers he had with him was ſo inconſiderable, that he had thoughts of ſending to the main army for a reinforcement before the priſoners ſhould march out, being apprehenſive that they might give him battle in the open field, though they could not defend themſelves behind walls.</p><p>About this time the Proteſtant princes held a diet at Leipſic ; to which Guſtavus ſent deputies, and conducted his negotiations with ſuch addreſs, as tended greatly to promote his intereſts. Immediately after this he reduced Gripſwald, and with it all Pomerania. Then marching to Guſtrow, he reſtored the dukes of Mecklenburg to their dominions. Here the Imperialiſts had tyrannized in ſuch a manner that Guſtavus was received as the deliverer of the people ; and the ceremony of the duke’s inauguration was in a ſhort time performed with great solemnity.</p><p>All this time count Tilly was employed in the siege of Magdeburg ; but now, being alarmed at the repeated ſucceſſes of the Swedes, he left Pappenſheim with part of the army before that city, while he marched with the rest into Thuringia, to attack the landgrave of Hesse-Cassel and the elector of Saxony. After a moſt obſtinate defence, Magdeburg fell into the hands of Pappenheim, where he committed all imaginable cruelties. Guſtavus formed a plan of recovering the city ; but was obliged to abandon it, by Pappenheim’s throwing himſelf into the place with his whole army, and by the progreſs which Tilly was making in Thuringia. Relinquiſhing this enterpriſe, therefore, he ordered Bannier to attack Havelsburg ; which was done with ſuch reſolution, that the place was forced in a few hours, and all the garriſon made priſoners. Werben was next obliged to ſubmit after an obſtinate conflict, in which many fell on both ſides.—Theſe ſucceſſes obliged count Tilly to attempt in perſon to check the progreſs of the Swedes. He detached the vanguard oſ his army, compoſed of the flower of the Imperial cavalry, within a few miles of the Swediſh camp. An action enſued, in which Bernſtein the Imperial general was defeated and killed, with 1000 of his men. Guſtavus, after this advantage, placed himſelf in a ſituation ſo much ſuperior to his enemies, that count Tilly was fired with indignation, and marched up to the Swediſh lines to give him battle. Guſtavus kept within his works, and Tilly attacked his camp, though almoſt impregnably fortified, keeping up a moſt terrible fire from a battery of 32 pieces of cannon ; which, however, produced no other effect, than obliging the Swediſh monarch to draw up his army behind the walls of Werben. Tilly had placed his chief hopes in being able to nail up the enemy’s cannon, or ſet fire to their camp in divers quarters ; after which he<hi rend="superscript">1 </hi>propoſed making his grand attack. With this view he bribed ſome priſoners ; but they betrayed him, and told his deſign to Guſtavus. The king ordered fives to be lighted in different parts of his camp, and his ſoldiers to imitate the noiſe of a tumultuous diſorderly rabble. This had the deſired effect. The count led his army to the breach made by the cannon ; where he was received with ſuch a volley of grape ſhot as cut off the firſt line, and put the whole body in diſorder, ſo that they could never be brought back to the charge. In this confuſion the Imperial army was attacked by Bauditzen, and, after an obſtinate conflict, obliged to quit the field.</p><p>Soon after this action the queen arrived at the camp with a reinforcement of 8000 men ; at the ſame time a treaty was concluded with Charles I. of England, by which that monarch allowed the marquis of Hamilton to raiſe 6000 men <hi rend="italic">for</hi> the ſervice of Guſtavus. Theſe auxiliaries were to be conducted to the main army by a body of 4000 Swedes; and were in every thing to obey the king while he was personally preſent, but in his abſence were to be ſubject to the orders of the marquis. With theſe troops the king had reſolved to make a diverſion in Bremen : but the marquis finding it impoſſible for him to effect a junction with the Swediſh army, reſolved, without debarking his troops, to steer his courſe for the Oder, and land at Uſedom. Guſtavus was very much diſpleaſed at finding his project thus diſconcerted ; however, making the beſt of the preſent circumſtances, he commanded the Britiſh troops to act on the Oder inſtead of the Weſer. The number oſ this little army was magnified exceedingly by report, inſomuch that count Tilly had some thoughts of marching againſt them with his whole force; but on the departure of the marquis for Sileſia, he reinforced the army in that country with a large detachment, which was thought to contribute not a little to the defeat he ſoon after received.</p><p>Ever ſince the late action Guſtavus had kept within his intrenchments, where his army was well provided with every thing. Tilly made ſeveral attempts to ſurpriſe or draw him to an engagement ; but finding all his endeavours fruitleſs, he marched into Saxony, and laid ſiege to Leipſic. This precipitate meaſure proved highly advantageous to the Swediſh monarch ; as thus the elector, who had been wavering in his resolutions, was now obliged to have recourſe to the Swedes, in order to preſerve himſelf from utter deſtruction. A treaty offenſive and defensive was immediately concluded with Guſtavus: and the elector willingly promised everything that was required of him; and among tire rest, that not only the prince his ſon, but he himſelf,</p></body></text></TEI>
