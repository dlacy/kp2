A similar wood, known under the same name, is obtained in the West Indies, the tree being probably a species of <hi rend="italic">Zanthoxylum</hi> (natural order <hi rend="italic">Rutaceae).</hi> Satin-wood was in request for rich furniture about the end of the 18th century, the fashion then being to ornament panels of it with painted medallions and floral scrolls and borders. It is used for inlaying and small veneers, in covering the backs of hair and clothes-brushes and in making small articles of turnery.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
