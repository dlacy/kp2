                hitherto existing, though in a manner dormant—&nbsp;that the compilers of the XII.
                Tables thought it superfluous&nbsp;expressly to declare it. “ If a man die
                intestate, leaving no&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;"
                >suus heres,</span><span class="font0"> his nearest agnate shall have his estate. If
                the&nbsp;agnate also fail, his gentiles shall have it.” It has been
                pointed&nbsp;out, in dealing with the tutory of agnates, that the notion
                of&nbsp;agnation, as a bond distinct from that which connected the&nbsp;gentile
                members of a clan, was due to the decemvirs. They&nbsp;had to devise a law of
                intestate tutory and succession suitable&nbsp;alike to the patricians who had
                </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">gentes</span><span
                class="font0"> and to the plebeians&nbsp;who had none. To put the latter in exactly
                the same position&nbsp;as the former was beyond their power; for the fact had to
                be&nbsp;faced that the plebeians had no gentile institutions, and to&nbsp;create
                them was impossible. The difficulty was overcome by&nbsp;accepting the principle of
                agnation upon which the patrician&nbsp;</span><span class="font0"
                style="font-style:italic;">gens</span><span class="font0"> was constructed, and
                establishing an agnatic circle of&nbsp;kinsmen (perhaps at first limited to the
                sixth degree) to which&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0"
                style="font-style:italic;">gens</span><span class="font0"> as a collective body
                should be postponed in the case&nbsp;of the patricians, and which should come in
                place of it in the&nbsp;case of the plebeians. It was not perfect equalization,
                but&nbsp;the nearest approach to it that the circumstances permitted.&nbsp;The
                difference was that, when the agnates of a plebeian intestate&nbsp;failed, his
                inheritance was vacant; whereas, on failure of those&nbsp;of a patrician, there was
                devolution to his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;"
                >gens</span><span class="font0"> in its collective&nbsp;capacity. Two “
                interpretations ” put upon the statute had&nbsp;an important bearing in this
                connexion, viz. (i) that, if the&nbsp;nearest agnates in existence declined the
                succession, those&nbsp;next in degree were not allowed to take it; and (2) that
                no&nbsp;female agnate could take it more remote than a sister of the&nbsp;deceased
                intestate. The division among two or more agnates</span></p>

                views&nbsp;then held, he acquired the inheritance itself. Gaius
                characterizes&nbsp;it as a dishonest acquisition, inasmuch as the usucapient
                knew&nbsp;that what he had taken possession of was not his. But, as
                already&nbsp;explained, the usucapion of the XI1. Tables did not require

                class="font0"> on the part of the uscapient; he might acquire ownership&nbsp;by

                there was no theft, therefore, when a&nbsp;person took possession of it with a view
                to usucapion in the character&nbsp;of heir. There can be little doubt that on the
                completion of his&nbsp;possession he was regarded as heir just as fully as if he had
                taken&nbsp;under a testament or as heir-at-law on intestacy—that is to
