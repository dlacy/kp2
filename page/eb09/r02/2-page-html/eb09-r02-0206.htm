<p><span class="font1">ancient popular </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Gospel of Nicodemus),</span><span class="font1"> according to which Joseph of Arimathea brought Christianity to Britain in the&nbsp;time of Vespasian. Then Robert de Borron continued his&nbsp;story in another work which represented the quest or rediscovery of the Grail in Avalon, Brittany, or Britain, by&nbsp;Perceval, the grand-nephew of Joseph of Arimathea; and&nbsp;Walter Map appropriated so much of De Borron’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Histoire&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Queste</span><span class="font1"> as suited him, working it up in a continuation&nbsp;of his story on Arthur, Guinevere, and Lancelot, whilst&nbsp;adding to and altering the incidents of the narrative very&nbsp;considerably. Finally, Hélie de Borron (about 1190) rewrote the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tristan</span><span class="font1"> in something like its existent form,&nbsp;weaving it by enlargement into connexion with the other&nbsp;tales, and probably soon after 1200 united for the first&nbsp;time in one enormous and unharmonized corpus the full&nbsp;set of Arthurian stories. One reason why we cannot assign&nbsp;this first combination to a later date (as those do who&nbsp;hold the work of Rusticien of Pisa to have been something&nbsp;more than a mere compression) is that the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Guiron,</span><span class="font1"> written&nbsp;by Hélie de Borron (probably soon after 1200), is not incorporated in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Morte Arthur,</span><span class="font1"> which it would assuredly&nbsp;have been if Rusticien (about 1270-75) had been employed&nbsp;to unite a number of detached stories rather than to re-edit&nbsp;an already existing compilation. Of Hélie de Borron we&nbsp;only know that he was a relative of Robert ; that he was&nbsp;the virtual author of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bret</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tristan,</span><span class="font1"> in which he&nbsp;incorporated the substance of tales written by Luc de Gast&nbsp;and Gasse li Blont ; that he also wrote </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Palamedes</span><span class="font1"> in two&nbsp;parts </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{Meliadus</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Guiron le Courtois)</span><span class="font1"> ; and that his&nbsp;work was done at the request of a king of England,&nbsp;alleged to have been Henry II. or Henry III. Of the&nbsp;other early writers of Arthurian stories the chief were the&nbsp;trouvère Chrestien de Troyes (about 1180-90), who composed a poem upon an episode of Map’s Lancelot story,&nbsp;and another upon the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Perceval</span><span class="font1"> (in which he may have&nbsp;combined Robert de Borron and Map), and Guyot de&nbsp;Provins (about 1190-95), who wrote a romance of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Perceval,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">now lost, and only known through the German translation&nbsp;of Wolfram von Eschenbach (about 1205). As for the&nbsp;Welsh stories in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mabinogion</span><span class="font1"> and the Welsh </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Seint&nbsp;Greal,</span><span class="font1"> there is really no evidence to show their anteriority&nbsp;to the English </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Morte Arthur,</span><span class="font1"> except the fact that two of&nbsp;the tales </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{Geraint</span><span class="font1"> and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lady of the Fountain)</span><span class="font1"> are of&nbsp;similar substance to the poems of Chrestien de Troyes,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Erec et Enide</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Le Chevalier au Lyon,-τr⅛ιxvAMιvs<sub>l</sub></span><span class="font1"> of&nbsp;Arthurian personages but not embodied in the French&nbsp;prose romances. Even the Welsh chronicles which are&nbsp;supposed to have furnished the original text of Geoffrey&nbsp;of Monmouth’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Historia</span><span class="font1"> have been ascertained to be merely&nbsp;translations from the Latin version. It is a safe conclusion to say that anything in Welsh literature corresponding with portions or incidents of the French romances&nbsp;was simply a translation made in the 13th or 14th century&nbsp;from a French original. This refers, of course, to what is&nbsp;now extant, for there can be little question that Breton and&nbsp;Cymric legend furnished the earlier romancists with names&nbsp;and legends in plenty. Returning to the consideration of&nbsp;names, it is obvious that when Lawnselot dy Lak appears&nbsp;in Welsh it is simply a corruption of the Franco-English&nbsp;Lancelot, and that the Cymric writer had no idea of its&nbsp;above-suggested origin in a British </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lanc-e-loe</span><span class="font1"> (a conjecture&nbsp;which is fortified by the pleonasm of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">du-lak</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">del-lak)</span><span class="font1"> or&nbsp;in a French </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">l<sup>,</sup>ancillet.</span><span class="font1"> Consequently the original Lancelot&nbsp;story has left no trace in purely Welsh literature. With&nbsp;Perceval we may think differently ; the Welsh name Pere-dur, under which he is known, is a sufficient warrant for&nbsp;supposing that portions of the Welsh tale are at least as&nbsp;ancient as Walter Map. The very form Pered-ur, like that&nbsp;of Arth-ur, is archaic, and with the latter it requires a&nbsp;different interpretation from that which Welsh scholars&nbsp;have given it. Here it may be observed that the terminal&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ur,</span><span class="font1"> whatever may have been its true sense, is remarkable&nbsp;for its frequent use in the names of Pictish princes. As&nbsp;for Perceval, wherever Robert de Borron got the name&nbsp;(see below), Walter Map, in adopting it for the hero of&nbsp;the story that belongs to Peredur, made the two names&nbsp;thenceforward identical.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Analysis of the Arthurian Romances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">I. II. Arthur and the Round Table had no separate romance, or else it has perished. It exists now substantially as part of&nbsp;Lancelot (III. ).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">1. Merlin.—Most of his story appears in Geoffrey of Monmouth and in Wace, from whom it was probably worked up into a French&nbsp;poem (or prose work) by Robert de Borron about 1160-70. The&nbsp;French prose composition, embracing his life and, as an appendix,&nbsp;his prophecies (Latin by Geoffrey), was apparently written about&nbsp;1200 (by Hélie de Borron) in the form in which it exists in certain&nbsp;MSS., and nearly as it appears in printed books. Merlin, the son&nbsp;of an incubus, rescued at his birth by sudden baptism from the&nbsp;malignant destiny for which his diabolical parent had begotten&nbsp;him, is always described as a magician. He is called by the Welsh&nbsp;Myrddin, a form which betrays the posteriority of the existing&nbsp;Cambrian legends not only to the date of Geoffrey but also to&nbsp;the French romances ; in one of the earliest incidents of his story,&nbsp;however, he himself gives his name as Ambrosius.@@<sup>1</sup> He is represented as living apparently at the time of the Saxon invasion of&nbsp;England. He was not a friend of Vortigern ; this king, whom we&nbsp;know from English sources to have been attached more to the&nbsp;Saxons than to his countrymen, was represented in the old Merlin&nbsp;story as a usurper reigning in an interval between Moines, son of&nbsp;Constans, and the two brothers of Moines, Uter and Pendragon.&nbsp;After the successive deaths of Vortigern and Pendragon (on whose&nbsp;fall Uter adds his brother’s name to his own) Merlin continues&nbsp;to be the friend and counsellor of King Uter Pendragon. In that&nbsp;capacity he helps the king to assume the shape of Gorlais, duke of&nbsp;Tintagel, and thereby to beget Arthur upon the Duchess Yguerne.&nbsp;(The name Pendragon and the action remind us of the fabulous&nbsp;birth of Alexander the Great ; the name Uter, in connexion with&nbsp;the go-between Merlin, and the probable Celtic meaning of Yguerne&nbsp;remind us of Jupiter, Mercury, and Alcmena. ) The result is the&nbsp;birth of a hero who resembles both Hercules and Alexander. He&nbsp;grows up and is held to be merely the son of Gorlais, in spite&nbsp;of the fact that he was born after Yguerne (already a widow) had&nbsp;married Uter Pendragon ; but he proves his right to royal place&nbsp;after the king’s death by performing some extraordinary feats. In&nbsp;these he has Merlin’s aid, as well as in the conduct of his subsequent wars with the Gauls and the Saxons. Merlin has a lover&nbsp;or mistress in Viviane, the Lady of the Lake, to whom in an unlucky moment (as Samson to Delilah) he betrays a certain spell.&nbsp;She uses it to try her power, without having learned the converse&nbsp;charm, and poor Merlin vanishes into the midst of a thornbush,&nbsp;whence his voice can be heard ; but he is seen no more. Here the&nbsp;romance ends,—one of the most interesting, as well as one of the&nbsp;best-constructed and most simply told of the Arthurian series.&nbsp;The name and deeds of the enchanter have found their way into&nbsp;most modern literatures. One of Merlin’s actions was to institute&nbsp;a round table at Carduel, at which room was made for King Arthur&nbsp;and fifty of his nobles, with a vacant place for the Holy Grail.&nbsp;This was a ceremony to be performed once every year, and it was&nbsp;on the first of these occasions that Gorlais brought his wife Yguerne&nbsp;with him to court, and that King Arthur fell in love with her (as&nbsp;David with Bathsheba). This circumstance, although of later date&nbsp;than the original Merlin, leads us to the next romance in the cycle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">IV. 1. The Holy Grail.—The Grail romance began with Borron’s poem (or prose narrative) on Joseph of Arimathea. An old tradition maintained that Joseph of Arimathea (confounded in some&nbsp;respects with the centurion at the crucifixion and with Josephus&nbsp;the historian) brought the gospel to Britain or to Gaul in the first&nbsp;century of our era. The French romance on this subject, whichever&nbsp;of its existent early forms in verse and prose was the earlier, relates&nbsp;the story thus :—Pilate allowed Joseph to take down the body of&nbsp;Christ from the cross, and gave Him also son vaisseul, by which&nbsp;was evidently meant the chalice of His passion, or the cup used&nbsp;at the Last Supper. Of all the numerous interpretations suggested&nbsp;for the word “grail” or “graal” the only tenable one is that of&nbsp;“cup,” which plainly refers to the words “son vaisseul.” In&nbsp;that cup Joseph collected the precious blood of his Saviour.. He&nbsp;loses it when put in prison by the Jews, but it is restored to him in</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">@@@<sup>1</sup> When we remember that the Ambrosius Aurelius of Gildas was</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">probably the Arthur of Nennius and the romances, and that Merlin was called Ambrosius Merlinus, we are drawn to believe in the Romano-Briton origin of the stories, and to conclude that “ Arthur ” and “ Merlin ” are two explicative or distinguishing epithets attached to the&nbsp;older names.</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
