<p><span class="font0">their ancient liberties, he abolished the popular assembly, removed the great bell to Novgorod, installed his owi boyars in&nbsp;the administration, transported 300 of the leading families to&nbsp;other localities, replaced them by 300 families from Moscow, and&nbsp;left in the town a strong garrison of his own troops. Ryazan&nbsp;shared the same fate. In 1521 the prince, being suspected of&nbsp;forming an alliance with the Crimean Tatars, was summoned to&nbsp;Moscow and arrested. Two years later the prince of Novgorod-Seversk was accused of intriguing with the Poles and imprisoned&nbsp;for the rest of his life. Thus all the principalities were brought&nbsp;under the power of Moscow, and in that respect there remained&nbsp;nothing for Ivan the Terrihle to do. He took precautions,&nbsp;however, against any of the dead or moribund principalities&nbsp;being resuscitated, and punished with merciless severity any&nbsp;attempt to resist or undermine his authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">With the suppression and absorption of the independent principalities the problem was only half solved. The tsars of&nbsp;Muscovy meant to he autocratic rulers alike in their&nbsp;old and in their new territories. Their forefathers&nbsp;had been trained in the Tatar school of politics and&nbsp;administration, and in their ideas of government they had come&nbsp;to resemble Tatar khans much more than grand-princes of the&nbsp;old patriarchal type. Their autocratic tendencies were fostered&nbsp;also by the Church. As Christianity was brought into Russia&nbsp;from Constantinople it was only natural that the ecclesiastics,&nbsp;many of whom were Greeks, should admire Byzantine ideals and&nbsp;recommend them as models to he imitated. For the ambitious&nbsp;Moscow princes many of the Byzantine ideas were very acceptable. They liked to consider themselves as the Lord’s anointed,&nbsp;placed high above all ordinary mortals even of the most exalted&nbsp;rank; and when Constantinople fell into the hands of the infidel&nbsp;they began to imagine that, as the most powerful potentates of&nbsp;the Eastern Orthodox world they were the protectors of the Orthodox faith and the political heirs of the East Roman emperors.&nbsp;With a view to strengthen this claim Ivan III. married a niece&nbsp;of the emperor Constantine Palaeologus, who had fallen fighting when his capital was taken by the Turks (1453). From&nbsp;that moment Ivan’s subjects noticed a change in his attitude&nbsp;towards them, and attributed it to the evil influence of the Greek&nbsp;princess. In the old times the grand-prince was simply </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">primus&nbsp;inter pares</span><span class="font0"> ai6ong the minor princes, and these lived with their&nbsp;boyars almost on a footing of equality. Now the tsar of Muscovy&nbsp;and of all Russia adopted the airs and methods of a Tatar khan&nbsp;and surrounded himself with the pomp and splendours of a&nbsp;Byzantine emperor. Ivan III., notwithstanding the influence of&nbsp;his Greek consort, showed some respect for the ancient traditions&nbsp;and the susceptibilities of those around him, but his successor Basil&nbsp;did not follow his father’s example. All through his reign he&nbsp;preferred to employ as officials men of humble origin, and habitually treated the boyars and great nobles very unceremoniously.&nbsp;For disobedience to his orders he imprisoned a hoyar who was his&nbsp;own brother-in-law, and he caused another to be beheaded for&nbsp;complaining that the boyar-council was not consulted in important&nbsp;affairs of state. A boyar of Nizhniy-Novgorod who allowed&nbsp;himself to criticize the new order of things, and attributed the&nbsp;change to the influence of the Greek princess, had his tongue&nbsp;cut out. From the ecclesiastics Basil likewise 'insisted on&nbsp;unquestioning ohedience, and he did not hesitate to depose by&nbsp;his own authority a metropolitan who was at that time the&nbsp;highest dignitary of the Russian Church. According to Siegmund&nbsp;von Herberstein (1486-1566), an Austrian envoy who visited&nbsp;Moscow at that period, no sovereign in Europe was obeyed like&nbsp;the grand-prince of Muscovy, and his court was remarkable&nbsp;for barbaric luxury. In his palace were numerous equerries,&nbsp;chamherlains and other court dignitaries, and when he went out&nbsp;he was attended hy a guard of young nobles dressed in gaudy</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">costumes and armed with silver halberds.@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Such radical changes naturally produced a great deal of dissatisfaction among men of Slavonic temperament, whose&nbsp;grandfathers had heen independent princes, hoyars or free&nbsp;lances, and the malcontents could not adopt the old practice&nbsp;of emigrating to some other principality. There was no longer&nbsp;within the Russian land any independent principality in which&nbsp;an asylum could be found, and emigration to a principality&nbsp;beyond the frontier, such as Lithuania, was regarded as treason,&nbsp;for which the property of the fugitive would be confiscated and&nbsp;his family might be punished. In these circumstances the&nbsp;only outlet for discontent was sedition, and the malcontents&nbsp;awaited impatiently a favourable opportunity for an attempt&nbsp;to curb or overthrow the autocratic power. That opportunity&nbsp;came when Basil died in 1533, leaving as successor a child only&nbsp;three years old, and the chances seemed all on the side of the&nbsp;nohles; but the result belied the current expectations, for the&nbsp;child came to be known in history as Ivan the Terrible, and died&nbsp;half a century later in the full enjoyment of unlimited autocratic power. The fierce struggle between autocratic tyranny&nbsp;and oligarchic disorder, which went on in intermittent fashion&nbsp;during the whole of his reign, cannot be here described in detail,&nbsp;but the chief incidents may be mentioned.</span></p><div>

<p><span class="font0">During Ivan’s minority the country was governed, or rather misgoverned, first by his mother, and then by rival factions&nbsp;led by great nobles such as the princes Shuiski and&nbsp;Belski. Only once during this period did the young&nbsp;tsar come forward and assert his authority. Having&nbsp;convoked his boyars he reproached them collectively with&nbsp;robbing the treasury and committing acts, of injustice,&nbsp;and he caused one of them, a Prince Shuiski who happened&nbsp;to be in power at the moment, to be seized by his huntsmen and torn in pieces by a pack of hounds, as a warning&nbsp;to others. Thus apparently he asserted his authority, but&nbsp;in reality, being only thirteen years old, he was a mere&nbsp;puppet in the hands of one of the opposition factions, who&nbsp;wished to oust their rivals, and for the next four years the&nbsp;misgovernment of the nohles went on as before. It was not till&nbsp;he was ahout seventeen that he took an active part in the administration, and one of his first acts foreshadowed his future&nbsp;policy: he insisted on the metropolitan crowning him, not as&nbsp;grand-prince of Muscovy, but as tsar of all Russia (1547)- From&nbsp;the earliest times the term tsar—a contraction of the word&nbsp;Caesar—had been applied to the kings in Biblical history and&nbsp;the Byzantine emperors, and Ivan III. had already been described in the Church service as “ the ruler and autocrat of all&nbsp;Russia, the new Tsar Constantine in the new city of Constantine&nbsp;Moscow,” but on no previous occasion had a grand-prince been&nbsp;crowned under that title. A few months later occurred in&nbsp;Moscow a great fire, which destroyed nearly the whole of the&nbsp;city, and a serious popular tumult, in which the tsar’s uncle was&nbsp;murdered by the populace. Ivan regarded these events as a&nbsp;punishment from Heaven for the neglect of his duties, and he&nbsp;began to attend to public affairs under the influence of an enlightened priest called Sylvester and an official of humble origin&nbsp;called Adashev. With the assistance of these two counsellors&nbsp;he held in check the lawless, turbulent nohles, and ruled justly,&nbsp;to the satisfaction of the people, for fourteen years. Then,&nbsp;suddenly, for reasons which cannot easily be explained, he&nbsp;inaugurated a reign of terror which lasted for twenty-four years&nbsp;and earned for him the epithet of “theTerrible. ’’ Though there had&nbsp;been no open insurrection, he caused many boyars and humbler&nbsp;persons to he executed, and when some of the great nobles,&nbsp;fearing a similar fate, fled across the frontier and tendered their&nbsp;allegiance to the prince of Lithuania, his suspicion and indignation increased and he determined to adopt still more drastic&nbsp;measures. For this purpose he organized, outside the regular&nbsp;administration, a large corps of civil officials and armed retainers, whose duty it<sup>x</sup>was to obey him implicitly in all things;&nbsp;and with this force, which rose rapidly from 1000 to 6000 men,&nbsp;he acted like a savage invader in a conquered country. Accompanied by these so-called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Oprichniki,</span><span class="font0"> who have been&nbsp;compared to the Turkish Janissaries of the worst period, he&nbsp;ruthlessly devastated large districts—with no other object</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
