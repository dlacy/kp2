The name was that of a stock character in 17th-century Italian farce, <hi rend="italic">Scaramuccia (i.e.</hi> literally “ skirmish ”), who, attired usually in a black Spanish dress, burlesquing a “ don,” was beaten by Harlequin for his boasting and cowardice. The part was played in London in 1673 by a well-known Italian actor, Tiberic Fiurelli, and became popular. There are many instances of the use of the word in the <hi rend="italic">New English Dictionary.</hi></p></div></body></text></TEI>
