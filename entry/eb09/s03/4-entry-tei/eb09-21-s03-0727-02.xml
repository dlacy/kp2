Ben Jonson was his model, but he drew his materials largely from contemporary hfe. He also acquired standing among the wits as a talker. In the quarrel with Dryden he was the aggressor. They had been good enough friends, and Dryden in 1679 had furnished him with a prologue for his <hi rend="italic">True Widow.</hi> But when Dryden threw in his lot with the court, and satirized the opposition in <hi rend="italic">Absalom and Achitophel</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Medal,</hi> Shadwell was rash enough to constitute himself the champion of the true-blue Protestants and wrote a grossly personal and scurrilous attack on the poet, entitled <hi rend="italic">The Medal of John Bayes.</hi> Dryden immediately retorted in <hi rend="italic">MacFlecknoe,</hi> the most powerful and contemptuously scornful personal satire in our language, adding next month a few more rough touches of supercilious mockery in the second part of <hi rend="italic">Absalom and Achitophel,</hi> where Shadwell figures as "Og”:—</p><p>Og from a treason-tavern rolling home,</p><p>Round as a globe, and liquored every chink ;</p><p>Goodly and great he sails behind his link.</p><p>Dryden may not be strictly fair when he addresses his enemy as “thou last great prophet of tautology,” and makes Flecknoe extol him because “he never deviates into sense,” but Shadwell had fairly earned his chastisement, the sting of which lay in its substantial truth. He survived till 1692, and on Dryden’s resignation of the laureateship in 1688 was promoted to the office, a sign of the poverty of the Whig side at the time in literary men, and part of the explanation of their anxiety in the next generation to secure literary talent.</p><p>A complete edition of Shadwell’s works was published in 1720, in 4 vols. 12mo. His dramatic works are— <hi rend="italic">The Sullen Lovers,</hi> 1668 ; <hi rend="italic">The Royal Shepherdess,</hi> 1669 ; <hi rend="italic">The Humorist,</hi> 1671 ; <hi rend="italic">The Miser,</hi> 1672 ; <hi rend="italic">Epsom Wells,</hi> 1673 ; <hi rend="italic">Psyche,</hi> 1675 ; <hi rend="italic">The Libertine,</hi> 1676 ; <hi rend="italic">The Virtuoso,</hi> 1676 ; <hi rend="italic">Timon of Athens,</hi> 1678 ; <hi rend="italic">A True Widow,</hi> 1679 ; <hi rend="italic">The</hi> <hi rend="italic">Woman Captain,</hi> 1680 ; <hi rend="italic">The Lancashire Witches,</hi> 1682; <hi rend="italic">The Squire of Alsatia,</hi> 1688 ; <hi rend="italic">Bury Fair,</hi> 1689 ; <hi rend="italic">The Amorous Bigot,</hi> 1690 ; <hi rend="italic">The Scowerers,</hi> 1691 ; and <hi rend="italic">The Volunteers,</hi> 1693.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
