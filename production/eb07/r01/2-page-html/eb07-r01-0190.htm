<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font0"> only is removed at </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">b b.</span><span class="font0"> In performing this manœuvre the workman must be careful to have his net hung before&nbsp;him in its proper position, viz. in the order in which the&nbsp;rows were netted, as in fig. 5. This requires attention, because, if either of the sides </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">c</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">d</span><span class="font0"> were uppermost, the mischief would be increased when he came to cut away according to the above instructions. The next thing to be&nbsp;done is to unpick the knots of the old meshes, α, a, a, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a, a, a ;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">but the lateral knots </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">c, d,</span><span class="font0"> must </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font0"> be unpicked, for that&nbsp;would destroy the adjoining sound meshes; for the same&nbsp;reason, only </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font0"> side of the meshes ό, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">b</span><span class="font0"> is cut. We must&nbsp;Suppose, then, that the meshes represented by the dotted&nbsp;fines are entirely removed ; the next thing to be done is to&nbsp;replace them. It is evident that this cannot be properly&nbsp;accomplished unless the inserted meshes resemble as accurately as possible those that have been removed. A&nbsp;practised hand will effect this without a spool, but some&nbsp;skilful workmen think that it is infinitely less troublesome,&nbsp;and that the required regularity of the meshes is better insured, if a spool be used suitable to the meshes of the old&nbsp;net. Having filled a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">small</span><span class="font0"> needle with twine, make fast&nbsp;the end above the knot at K (fig. S), hold the spool and&nbsp;needle in the usual way, and take up the loops L, M, N, as&nbsp;in common netting ; when at N, lay aside the spool, and&nbsp;make the side NO. This is done by means of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">bend-knob</span><span class="font0"> the angle P being the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">bend</span><span class="font0"> or loop of the knot. The&nbsp;second row is now to be netted in the same way as the first,&nbsp;and so on with the rest, the single side at the end of each&nbsp;row being managed as at NO, and leading down to the&nbsp;row beneath. We have supposed the workman to have&nbsp;begun and ended this first row, netting from left to right;&nbsp;to work back the second row, he has simply to get on the&nbsp;other side of his net, or to turn the latter over, as may be&nbsp;most convenient, and thus to net on as usual from left to&nbsp;right, changing at the end of each row either the position&nbsp;of his net or of his own person. We shall next suppose&nbsp;that the required number of rows, save one, is completed ;&nbsp;we must insert a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">junction</span><span class="font0"> row between the row QRST,&nbsp;and that of the old net VWXY. This is done without a&nbsp;spool, by making the side TV fast at V with a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">bend-knot&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">round the loop of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">old</span><span class="font0"> net at V ; then the side VS&nbsp;with a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">bend-knot</span><span class="font0"> at S, round the loop of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">new</span><span class="font0"> piece at&nbsp;S ; then the sides SW, WR, RX, XQ, QY, in the same&nbsp;manner. Care must be taken that these sides be of the&nbsp;same length as the sides of the other meshes. At the beginning K and the end Y of your work, leave ends </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e e,</span><span class="font0"> to&nbsp;prevent the knot slipping. In fig. 5 three rows have been&nbsp;removed, and it will be seen that those loops which have&nbsp;only </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font0"> side removed, are diagonally opposite to each&nbsp;other, and thus it is when an </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">uneven</span><span class="font0"> number of rows is to&nbsp;be cut away ; but when an </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">even</span><span class="font0"> number is removed, those&nbsp;loops of which only one side is cut are at opposite angles&nbsp;of the orifice, but on the same side of the square. 6. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Oblong and square netting.</span><span class="font0"> If it be required to have the net&nbsp;with meshes setting in squares with their sides, accurately&nbsp;at right angles with each other, like the squares in a sash-window-frame, the following method is to be pursued. Net&nbsp;one loop for the first row, draw the spool out and net two&nbsp;loops for the second row, the additional loop being obtained by taking up that one loop which formed your first row&nbsp;twice, or, as it is technically termed, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">by setting in a false&nbsp;mesh.</span><span class="font0"> Your second row will thus consist of two loops. Remove the spool, begin the third row, which is to consist of&nbsp;three loops, the additional one being gained as before.&nbsp;Continue thus adding a loop at the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">end of</span><span class="font0"> each row until&nbsp;you have made your half square as large as you require ;&nbsp;the two </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">selvages</span><span class="font0"> on each side of your netting forming two&nbsp;sides of your square ; then, before you begin to form the&nbsp;other two sides of your square, net one row of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">dead</span><span class="font0"> netting,&nbsp;i. e. do not increase or diminish anywhere ; but at the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">end&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">of the following rows set in a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">stole</span><span class="font0"> mesh, i. e. take up the&nbsp;two last loops of the row together. Your net will at last be&nbsp;reduced to one loop again, and will, when stretched out,&nbsp;form a complete square, and all the meshes will stand&nbsp;square with each other. But, supposing you want your net&nbsp;to be longer than it is wide, and yet the meshes composing&nbsp;it to be square, as in the other, you are to proceed as follows : Form half a square as before, the length of one side&nbsp;of which will determine the width of the oblong to be&nbsp;made. When this is done, you must set in a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">false mesh</span><span class="font0"> at&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">end</span><span class="font0"> of one row, and a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">stole</span><span class="font0"> mesh at the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">end</span><span class="font0"> of the other&nbsp;row. Continue thus adding and diminishing </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">alternately,</span><span class="font0"> until your oblong is of the required length, aad this is ascertained by measuring the long side of the netting from α to&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">b</span><span class="font0"> (fig. 6), from the corner at </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font0"> to the last knot at </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">b.</span><span class="font0"> Finish&nbsp;off so as to net the part expressed by dotted lines in fig. 6,&nbsp;as you did in the case of the square net, viz. by taking two&nbsp;loops up at once at the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">end of each</span><span class="font0"> row. In the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">oblong</span><span class="font0"> you&nbsp;need not net a row of plain loops before you begin to finish&nbsp;off, as was done in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">square net.</span><span class="font0"> Oblong and square nets,&nbsp;when worked as now directed, will, when finished, appear&nbsp;in the shape of a lozenge, and so will all the meshes of&nbsp;which they are composed; but when stretched out with the&nbsp;sides at right angles, each to the other, the whole net will&nbsp;assume its proper shape. It adds to the finished appearance of the net, if, in making the last single loop of the net,&nbsp;the spool be withdrawn before the knot is </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">taught,</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">then&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">draw the twine up ; the last loop is thus, as it were, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">absorbed,</span><span class="font0"> instead of remaining there to spoil the neatness of&nbsp;the work. The single loop, too, with which the net was&nbsp;begun, may have its knot sufficiently loosened to enable&nbsp;the workman to tighten up the loop and make it </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">vanish,</span><span class="font0"> as&nbsp;he did at the other end. A little practice will demonstrate&nbsp;this clearly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Many net-makers consider it a great saving both of time and twine to make their </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">hay-nets,</span><span class="font0"> and the like, after this&nbsp;manner ; besides which, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">selvage</span><span class="font0"> thus formed along each&nbsp;side of the net affords sufficient strength without any additional cord to border it. 7. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">How to net a round or cylindrical net without having to join.</span><span class="font0"> Net any given number&nbsp;of loops, and, when you come to the end of the row, instead of turning the net over to net a second, keep the&nbsp;spool in the last loop, and with the needle pick up the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">first&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">loop of the row just finished, and net into it in the usual&nbsp;manner ; thus the row will be united. Continue to take up&nbsp;each loop on your right hand in succession, as in ordinary&nbsp;netting, and thus go on netting round and round until you&nbsp;have obtained the required length. The rows will resemble&nbsp;the turns of a spiral spring descending from the top to the&nbsp;bottom. 8. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">How to make a bag-net from a square.</span><span class="font0"> Net a&nbsp;piece of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">dead netting</span><span class="font0"> containing any given number of loops&nbsp;in the row, observing always an </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">odd</span><span class="font0"> number, as 3, 5, 7, 9,&nbsp;11, according to the proposed size of the bag ; net double&nbsp;the number of rows that there are loops in the row save&nbsp;one, as 5, 9, 13, 17, 21. This done, draw the foundation&nbsp;string, viz. the string on which you netted the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">lever,</span><span class="font0"> and&nbsp;fix it in the middle of your square, then net round and&nbsp;round it. The corner loops must be carefully worked for&nbsp;the first few rounds, to make them set even. It is always&nbsp;in the workman’s power to increase the circumference of&nbsp;his bag as he proceeds from the bottom to the mouth, by&nbsp;setting in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">false meshes.</span><span class="font0"> In doing this, however, he must&nbsp;observe regularity, and take care to insert his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">quarterings&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">at equal distances, else the net will be lop-sided, and distorted. 9. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Of joining two nets together.</span><span class="font0"> Apply one net on&nbsp;the other, supposing each to contain the same number of&nbsp;meshes in the rows to be united, and that the meshes are&nbsp;of the same size ; then, with a spool a full quarter less in&nbsp;size than that on which the nets were </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">breaded,</span><span class="font0"> net one row&nbsp;along the margins to be joined, taking up two loops on the&nbsp;needle, i. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e.</span><span class="font0"> one mesh of each net together; or, if the object be to join the first with the last row of the same net,</span></p>
