<p><span class="font0">literature at King’s College, London. In painting he had lessons from Copley Fielding and afterwards from J. D. Harding.&nbsp;But in the incessant travelling, drawing, collecting specimens&nbsp;and composition in prose anti verse he had gained but a very&nbsp;moderate classical and mathematical knowledge when he&nbsp;matriculated at Oxford; nor could he ever learn to write&nbsp;tolerable Latin. As a boy he was active, lively and docile;&nbsp;a good walker, but ignorant of all boyish games, as naïf and&nbsp;as innocent as a child; and he never could learn to dance or&nbsp;to ride. He was only saved by his intellect and his fine nature&nbsp;from turning out an arrant prig. He was* regarded by his&nbsp;parents, and seems to have regarded himself, as a genius.&nbsp;As a child he had been “a savant in petticoats”; as a boy&nbsp;he was a poet in breeches. At the age of seventeen he saw&nbsp;Adèle, the French daughter of Monsieur Domecq, Mr Ruskin’s&nbsp;partner, a lovely girl of fifteen. John fell rapturously in love&nbsp;with her; and, it seems, the two fathers seriously contemplated&nbsp;their marriage. The young poet wooed the girl with poems,&nbsp;romances, dramas and mute worship, but received nothing&nbsp;except chilling indifference and lively ridicule. To the gay ,&nbsp;young beauty, familiar with Parisian society, the raw and i&nbsp;serious youth was not a possible </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">parti.</span><span class="font0"> She was sent to an&nbsp;English school, and he occasionally saw her. His unspoken&nbsp;passion lasted about three years, when she married the Baron&nbsp;Duquesne. Writing as an old man, long after her death,&nbsp;Ruskin speaks of his early love without any sort of rapture.&nbsp;But it is clear that it deeply coloured his life, and led to the&nbsp;dangerous illness which for some two years interrupted his&nbsp;studies and made him a wanderer over Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As the father was resolved that John should have everything that money and pains could give, and was one day to be a&nbsp;bishop at least, he entered him at Christ Church, Oxford, as a&nbsp;gentleman-commoner—then an order reserved for men of&nbsp;wealth and rank. Ruskin’s Oxford career, broken by the two&nbsp;years passed abroad, was not very full of incident or of usefulness. Though he never became either a scholar or a mathematician, he did enough accurate work to be placed in the honorary&nbsp;fourth class both in classics and in mathematics. By the young&nbsp;• bloods of the “ House ” he was treated pleasantly as a raw&nbsp;outsider of genius. By some of the students and tutors, by&nbsp;Liddell, Newton, Acland and others, he was regarded as a&nbsp;youth of rare promise, and he made some lifelong friendships&nbsp;with men of mark and of power. Both he and his college took&nbsp;kindly the amazing proceeding of his mother, who left her&nbsp;husband and her home to reside in Oxford, that she might watch&nbsp;over her son’s health. The one success of his Oxford career&nbsp;was the winning the Newdigate Prize by his poem “Salsette&nbsp;and Elephanta,” which he recited in the Sheldonian Theatre&nbsp;(June 1839). Two years of ill-health and absence from home&nbsp;ensued. And he did not become “ a Graduate of Oxford ”&nbsp;until 1842, in his twenty-fourth year, five years after his first&nbsp;entrance at the university. In fact, his desultory school and&nbsp;college life had been little more than an interruption and hindrance to his real education—the study of nature, of art and of&nbsp;literature. Long before Ruskin published books he had appeared in print. In March 1834, when he was but fifteen,&nbsp;Loudon’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Magazine of Natural History</span><span class="font0"> published an essay of his&nbsp;on the strata of mountains and an inquiry as to the colour of the&nbsp;Rhine. He then wrote for Loudon’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Magazine of Architecture,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and verses of his were inserted in Messrs Smith &amp; Elder’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Friendship's Offering,</span><span class="font0"> by the editor, T. Pringle, who took the&nbsp;lad to see the poet Rogers. At seventeen he wrote for </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Blackwood</span><span class="font0"> a defence of Turner, which the painter, to whom it was first&nbsp;submitted, did not take the trouble to forward to the magazine.&nbsp;At eighteen he wrote a series of papers, signed Kata Phusin,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font0"> “ after Nature,” for Loudon’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Magazine,</span><span class="font0"> on “ The Poetry of&nbsp;Architecture.” In 1838 (he was then nineteen) Mr Loudon wrote&nbsp;to the father, “Your son is the greatest natural genius that ever&nbsp;it has been my fortune to become acquainted with.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Having recovered his health and spirits by care and foreign travel, and having taken his degree and left Oxford, Ruskin set&nbsp;to work steadily at Herne Hill on the more elaborate defence of</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font0">Turner, which was to become his first work. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Modern Painters, </span><span class="font0">vol. i., by “a Graduate of Oxford,” was published May 1843,&nbsp;when the author was little more than twenty-four. It produced&nbsp;a great and immediate sensation. It was vehemently attacked&nbsp;by the critics, and coolly received by the painters. Even Turner&nbsp;was somewhat disconcerted; but the painter was now known&nbsp;to both Ruskins, and they freely bought his pictures. The&nbsp;family then went again to the Alps, that John might study&nbsp;mountain formation and “Truth ” in landscape. In 1845 he&nbsp;was again abroad in Italy, working on his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Modern Painters,</span><span class="font0"> the&nbsp;second volume of which appeared in 1846. He had now plunged&nbsp;into the study of Bellini and the Venetian school, Fra Angelico&nbsp;and the early Tuscans, and he visited Lucca, Pisa, Florence,&nbsp;Padua, Verona and Venice, passionately devoting himself to&nbsp;architecture, sculpture and painting in each city of north Italy.&nbsp;He wrote a few essays for the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Quarterly Review</span><span class="font0"> and other&nbsp;periodicals, and in 1849 </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(aet.</span><span class="font0"> 30) he published </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Seven Lamps&nbsp;of Architecture,</span><span class="font0"> with his own etchings, which greatly increased&nbsp;the reputation acquired by his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Modern Painters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On the 10th of April 1848, a day famous in the history of Chartism, Ruskin was married at Perth to Euphemia Chalmers&nbsp;Gray, a lady of great beauty, of a family long intimate with the&nbsp;Ruskins. The marriage, we are told, was arranged by the&nbsp;parents of the pair, and was a somewhat hurried act. It was&nbsp;evidently ill-assorted, and brought no happiness to either.&nbsp;They travelled, lived in London, saw society, and attended a&nbsp;“ Drawdug-room ” at Buckingham Palace. But Ruskin, immersed in various studies and projects, was no husband for a&nbsp;brilliant woman devoted to society. No particulars of their&nbsp;life have been made public. In 1854 his’wife left him, obtained a nullification of the marriage under Scots law, and&nbsp;ultimately became the wife of John Everett Millais. John&nbsp;Ruskin returned to his parents, with whom he resided till their&nbsp;death; and neither his marriage nor the annulling of it seems&nbsp;to have affected seriously his literary career.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Ruskin’s architectural studies, of which </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Seven Lamps</span><span class="font0"> was the first fruit, turned him from Turner and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Modern Painters.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">He planned a book about Venice in 1845, and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Stones of&nbsp;Venice</span><span class="font0"> was announced in 1849 as in preparation. After intense&nbsp;study in Italy and at home, early in 1851 (the year of the Great&nbsp;Exhibition in London) the first volume of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Stones of Venice&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">appeared </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(aet.</span><span class="font0"> 32). It was by no means a mere antiquarian and&nbsp;artistic study. It was a concrete expansion of the ideas of&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Seven Lamps—</span><span class="font0">that the buildings and art of a people are&nbsp;the expression of their religion, their morality, their national&nbsp;aspirations and social habits. It was, as Carlyle wrote to the&nbsp;.author, “a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sermon</span><span class="font0"> in stones,” “a singular sign of the times,”&nbsp;“ a new </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Renaissance.&quot;</span><span class="font0"> It appeared in the same year with the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Construction of Sheepfolds—</span><span class="font0">a plea for the reunion of Christian&nbsp;churches—in the same year with the essay on </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pre-Raphaelitism,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">the year of Turner’s death (19th December). </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Slones of&nbsp;Venice</span><span class="font0"> was illustrated with engravings by some of the most&nbsp;refined artists of his time. The author spent a world of pains&nbsp;in having these brought up to the highest perfection of the reproductive art, and began the system of exquisite illustration,&nbsp;and those facsimiles of his own and other sketches, which make&nbsp;his works rank so high in the catalogues and price-lists of&nbsp;collectors. This delicate art was carried even farther in the later&nbsp;volumes of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Modern Painters</span><span class="font0"> by the school of engravers whom&nbsp;Ruskin inspired and gathered round him. And these now rare&nbsp;and coveted pieces remain to rebuke us for our modern&nbsp;preference for the mechanical and unnatural </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">chiaroscuro</span><span class="font0"> of&nbsp;photogravure—the successor and destroyer of the graver’s art.&nbsp;Although Ruskin was practised in drawing from the time that&nbsp;he could hold a pencil, and had lessons in painting from some&nbsp;eminent artists, he at no time attempted to paint pictures. He&nbsp;said himself that he was unable to compose a picture, and he&nbsp;never sought to produce anything that he would call a work of&nbsp;original art. His drawings, of which he produced an enormous&nbsp;quantity, were always intended by himself to be studies or&nbsp;memoranda of buildings or natural objects precisely as they&nbsp;appeared to his eye. Clouds, mountains, landscapes, towers,</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
