                <p><label>SAYER (or Sayers), JAMES</label>, (1748-1823), English caricaturist, was a
                    native of Yarmouth, and son of a merchant captain. He began as clerk in an
                    attorney’s office, and was for a time a member of the borough council. In 1780
                    the death of his father put him in possession of a small fortune, and he came to
                    London. As a political caricaturist he was a supporter of William Pitt. His
                    plate of “ Carlo Khan’s triumphal entry into Leadenhall Street ’’ was allowed by
                    C. J. Fox, against whom it was directed, to have damaged him severely in public
                    opinion. Indeed Sayer was always at his best when attacking Fox, whose strongly
                    marked features he rendered with remarkable power, and always so as to make them
                    convey expressions of defiant impudence or of anger. Pitt, who showed no wish to
                    help literature or art in any other case, provided Sayer with a place as marshal
                    of the Exchequer court. He died in Curzon Street, Mayfair, on the 2oth of April
                    1823.</p>
                <p>Sayer's “ Carlo Khan ” has been frequently reproduced. But he can only be judged
                    with confidence after examining the collection in the British Museum, or other
                    public libraries. His drawings, made originally with pencil on oil paper, were
                    etched for him by the Brethertons. They were then sold in collections of the
                    size of a large octavo copybook, under such titles as <hi rend="italic"
                        >Illustrious Heads</hi> (1794) or <hi rend="italic">Outlines of the
                        Opposition</hi> (1795). Sayer left a complete gallery of small full-length
                    pictures of the public men of his time, slightly caricatured. In his great
                    plates he is inferior to Gillray, and he never has the grace of Rowlandson, but
                    he is less exaggerated than either, and nearer the truth.</p>
