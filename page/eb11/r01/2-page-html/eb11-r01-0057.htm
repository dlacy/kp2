<p><span class="font1">Whitstable, worked partly by fixed engines and partly by locomotives—quickly adopted steam traction. But the&nbsp;Liverpool &amp; Manchester railway, opened in 1830, first impressed the national mind with the fact that a revolution in&nbsp;the methods of travelling had really taken place; and further,&nbsp;it was for it that the first high-speed locomotive of the modern type was invented and constructed. The directors having&nbsp;offered a prize of £500 for the best engine, trials were held on a&nbsp;finished portion of the line at Rainhill in October 1829, and&nbsp;three engines took part—the Rocket of George and Robert&nbsp;Stephenson, the Novelty of John Braithwaite and John Ericsson, and the Sanspareil of Timothy Hackworth. The last&nbsp;two of these engines broke down under trial, but the Rocket&nbsp;fulfilled the conditions and won the prize. Its two steam&nbsp;cylinders were 8 in. in diameter, with a stroke of 16½ in., and&nbsp;the driving wheels, which were placed in front under the funnel,&nbsp;were 4 ft. 8½ in. in diameter. The engine weighed 4¼ tons;&nbsp;the tender following it, 3 tons 4cwt.; and the two loaded carriages drawn by it on the trial, 9 tons 11 cwt.: thus the weight&nbsp;drawn was 12¾ tons, and the gross total of the train 17 tons.&nbsp;The boiler evaporated 18¼ cub. ft., or 114 gals., of water an&nbsp;hour, and the steam pressure was 50 lb per square inch. The&nbsp;engine drew a train weighing 13 tons 35 m. in 48 minutes, the&nbsp;rate being thus nearly 44 m. an hour; subsequently it drew an&nbsp;average gross load of 40 tons behind the tender at 13·3 m. an&nbsp;hour. The Rocket possessed the three elements of efficiency&nbsp;of the modern locomotive—the internal water-surrounded&nbsp;fire-box and the multitubular flue in the boiler; the blast-pipe,&nbsp;by which the steam after doing its work in the cylinders was&nbsp;exhausted up the chimney, and thus served to increase the&nbsp;draught and promote the rapid combustion of the fuel; and&nbsp;the direct connexion of the steam cylinders, one on each side&nbsp;of the engine, with the two driving wheels mounted on one&nbsp;axle. Of these features, the blast-pipe had been employed by&nbsp;Trevithick on his engine of 1804, and direct driving, without&nbsp;intermediate gearing, had been adopted in several previous&nbsp;engines; but the use of a number (25) of small tubes in place&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font1">one or two large flues was an innovation which in conjunction&nbsp;with the blast-pipe contributed greatly to the efficiency of&nbsp;the engine. After the success of the Rocket, the Stephensons&nbsp;received orders to build seven more engines, which were of&nbsp;very similar design, though rather larger, being four-wheeled&nbsp;engines, with the two driving wheels in front and the cylinders&nbsp;behind; and in October 1830 they constructed a ninth engine,&nbsp;the Planet, also for the Liverpool &amp; Manchester railway,&nbsp;which still more closely resembled the modern type, since the&nbsp;driving wheels were placed at the fire-box end, while the two&nbsp;cylinders were arranged under the smoke-box, inside the frames.&nbsp;The main features of the steam locomotive were thus established, and its subsequent development is chiefly a history&nbsp;of gradual increase in size and power, and of improvements&nbsp;in design, in material and in mechanical construction, tending&nbsp;to increased efficiency and economy of operation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In America the development of the locomotive dates from almost the same time as in England. The earliest examples&nbsp;used in that country, apart from a small experimental model&nbsp;constructed by Peter Cooper, came from England. In 1828,&nbsp;on behalf of the Delaware &amp; Hudson Canal Company, which&nbsp;had determined to build a line, 16 m. long, from Carbondale&nbsp;to Honesdale, Pennsylvania, Horatio Allen ordered three&nbsp;locomotives from Messrs Foster &amp; Rastrick, of Stourbridge,&nbsp;and one from George Stephenson. The latter, named the&nbsp;America, was the first to be delivered, reaching New York in&nbsp;January 1829, but one of the others, the Stourbridge Lion,&nbsp;was actually the first practical steam locomotive to run in&nbsp;America, which it did on the 9th of August 1829. The first&nbsp;American-built locomotive, the Best Friend, of Charleston,&nbsp;was made at the West Point Foundry, New York, in 1830, and&nbsp;was put to work on the South Carolina railroad in that year.&nbsp;It had a vertical boiler, and was carried on four wheels all&nbsp;coupled, the two cylinders being placed in an inclined position&nbsp;and having a bore of about 6 in. with a stroke of 16 in. It&nbsp;is reported to have hauled 40 or 50 passengers in 4 or 5 cars at&nbsp;a speed of 16-21 m. an hour. After a few months of life it&nbsp;was blown up, its attendant, annoyed by the sound of the&nbsp;escaping steam, having fastened down the safety-valve. A&nbsp;second engine, the West Point, also built at West Point Foundry&nbsp;for the South Carolina railroad, differed from the Best Friend&nbsp;in having a horizontal boiler with 6 or 8 tubes, though in&nbsp;other respects it was similar. In 1831 the Baltimore &amp; Ohio&nbsp;Company offered a prize of $4000 for an American engine&nbsp;weighing 3½ tons, able to draw 15 tons at 15 m. an hour on&nbsp;the level: it was won by the York of Messrs Davis &amp;&nbsp;Gartner in the following year. Matthias W. Baldwin, the&nbsp;founder of the famous Baldwin Locomotive Works in Philadelphia, built his first engine, Old Ironsides, for the&nbsp;Philadelphia, Germantown &amp; Morristowíi railroad; first&nbsp;tried in November 1832, it was modelled on Stephenson’s&nbsp;Planet, and had a single pair of driving wheels at the firebox end and a pair of carrying wheels under the smoke-box.&nbsp;His second engine, the E. L. Miller, delivered to the South&nbsp;Carolina railroad in 1834, presented a feature which has remained characteristic of American locomotives—the front&nbsp;part was supported on a four-wheeled swivelling bogie-truck,&nbsp;a device, however, which had been applied to Puffing Billy&nbsp;in England when it was rebuilt in 1815.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Liverpool &amp; Manchester line achieved a success which surpassed the anticipations even of its promoters, and in con-sequence numerous projects were started for the construction&nbsp;of railways in various parts of Great Britain. In the decade&nbsp;following its opening nearly 2000 m. of railway were sanctioned by parliament, including the beginnings of most of the&nbsp;existing trunk-lines, and in 1840 the actual mileage reached&nbsp;1331 m. The next decade saw the “ railway mania. ” The&nbsp;amount of capital which parliament authorized railway companies to raise was about 4½ millions on the average of the two&nbsp;years 1842-1843, 17¾ millions in 1844, 60 millions in 1845, and&nbsp;132 millions in 1846, though this last sum was less than a&nbsp;quarter of the capital proposed in the schemes submitted to the&nbsp;Board of Trade; and the wild speculation which occurred in&nbsp;railway shares in 1845 contributed largely to the financial crisis&nbsp;of 1847. In 1850 the mileage was 6635, in i860 it was 10,410,&nbsp;and in 1870 it was 15,310. The increase in the decade 1860-1870&nbsp;was thus nearly 50%, but subsequently the rate of increase&nbsp;slackened, and the mileages in 1880, 1890 and 1900 were 17,935,&nbsp;20,073 and 21, 855. In the United States progress was more&nbsp;rapid, for, beginning at 2816 in 1840, the mileage reached 9015&nbsp;in 1850, 30,600 in 1860, 87,801 in 1880, and 198,964 in 1900.&nbsp;Canada had no railway till 1853, and in South America construction did not begin till about the same time. France and&nbsp;Austria opened their first lines in 1828; Belgium, Germany,&nbsp;Russia, Italy and Holland in the succeeding decade; Switzerland and Denmark in 1844, Spain in 1848, Sweden in 1851,&nbsp;Norway in 1853, and Portugal in 1854; while Turkey and Greece&nbsp;delayed till 1860 and 1869. In Africa Egypt opened her first&nbsp;line (between Alexandria and Cairo) in 1856, and Cape Colony&nbsp;followed in i860. In Asia the first line was that between&nbsp;Bombay and Tannah, opened in 1853, and in Australia Victoria&nbsp;began her railway system in 1854 (see also the articles on the&nbsp;various countries for further details about their railways).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Transcontinental Railways. —</span><span class="font1">A railway line across North America was first completed in 1869, when the Union Pacific,&nbsp;building from the Missouri river at Omaha (1400 m. west of&nbsp;New York), met the Central Pacific, which built from San&nbsp;Francisco eastwards, making a line 1848 m. long through&nbsp;a country then for the most part uninhabited. This was&nbsp;followed by the Southern Pacific in 1881, from San Francisco&nbsp;to New Orleans, 2489 miles; the Northern Pacific, from St&nbsp;Paul to Portland, Ore., in 1883; the Atchison, Topeka &amp;&nbsp;Santa Fé, from Kansas City to San Diego; and the Great&nbsp;Northern from St. Paul to Seattle and New Westminster in&nbsp;1893. Meanwhile the Canadian Pacific, a true transcontinental&nbsp;line, was built from Montreal, on Atlantic tide-water, to the&nbsp;Pacific at Vancouver, 2906 m. But these lines have been</span></p>
