an iſland of Indoſtan, formed about six miles north-weſt of Trinchinopoly by the river Cavery, which divides itſelf into two branches : that to the northward takes the name of <hi rend="italic">Coleroon,</hi> but the ſouthern branch preſerves its old name the <hi rend="italic">Cavery.</hi> Each of theſe rivers, after a courſe of about 90 miles, empty themſelves into the ſea ; the Coleroon at Devicottah, and the Cavery near Tranquebar, at about 20 miles diſtance from one another. In this iſland, facing Trinchinopoly, ſtood a famous pagoda ſurrounded by ſeven ſquare walls of ſtone, 25 feet high and four feet thick. The ſpace between the outward and ſecond walls meaſured 310 ſeet, and ſo proportionably of the rest. Each incloſure had four large gates, with a high tower; which were placed, one in the middle of each side of the incloſure, and oppoſite to the four cardinal points. The outward wall was about four miles in circumference, and its gateway to the ſouth was ornamented with pillars, ſome of which were ſingle ſtones 33 feet in length and five in diameter ; while thoſe that formed the roof were ſtill larger ; and in the inmoſt incloſure were the chapels.—About half a mile to the eaſt was another large pagoda called J <hi rend="italic">umbikistna,</hi> which had but one incloſure.</p><p>The pagoda of Seringham was held in great veneration, from a belief that it contained the identical image of the god Wiſtnou worſhipped by Brama; and pilgrims came here from all parts of India with offerings of money to procure absolution. A large part of the revenue of the iſland was allotted for the maintenance of the Bramins who inhabited the pagoda; and theſe, with their families, formerly amounted to no fewer than 40,000 perſons, all maintained by the ſuperſtitious liberality of the adjacent country.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
