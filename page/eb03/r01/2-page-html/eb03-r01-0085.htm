He reduced Brunduſium, and in his&nbsp;ſecond conſulſhip he took 64 and funk 30 galleys of the-Carthaginian fleet, on the coaſts of Sicily.* Afterwards&nbsp;he landed in Africa 5 and fo rapid was his ſucceſs, that&nbsp;in a ſhort time he made himſelf maſter of about 200&nbsp;places of conſequence on the coaſt. The Carthaginians&nbsp;ſued for peace, but the conqueror refuſed to grant it ;&nbsp;and ſoon after he was defeated in a battle by Xanthip-pus, and 30,000 of his men were left on the field of&nbsp;battle, and 15,000 taken priſoners. Regulus was in&nbsp;the number of the captives, and he was carried in triumph to Carthage. He was ſent by the enemy to&nbsp;Rome, to propoſe an accommodation and an exchange&nbsp;of priſoners ; and if his commiffiôn was unſucceſsful, he&nbsp;was bound by the moſt ſolemn oaths to return to Car-thage without delay, when he came to Rome, Regulus diſſuaded his countrymen from accepting the·&nbsp;terms which the enemy propoſed ; and when his opi-nion had had due influence on the ſenate, Regulus reti-red to Carthage agreeable to his engagements. The&nbsp;Carthaginians were told that their offers of peace had&nbsp;been rcjected at Rome by the means of Regulus ; and&nbsp;therefore they prepared to puniſh him with the greateſt&nbsp;ſeverity. His eye-brows were cut, and he was expofed’&nbsp;for ſome days to the exceſſive heat of the meridian ſun,&nbsp;and afterwards confined in a barrel, whoſe fides were&nbsp;everywhere filled with large iron ſpikes, till he died in&nbsp;the greateſt agonies. His ſufferings were heard of at&nbsp;Rome ; and the ſenate permitted his widow to inflict-whatever puniſhment ſhe pleaſed on ſome of the moſt&nbsp;illuſtrious captives of Carthage which were in their&nbsp;hands. She confined them alſo in preſſes filled with&nbsp;ſharp iron points ; and was ſo exquifite in her cruelty, '&nbsp;that the ſenate interfered, and ſtopped the barbarity of&nbsp;her puniſhment.
