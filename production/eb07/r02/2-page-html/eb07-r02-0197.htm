<p><span class="font1">weight which is thus uniformly diffused over any part as united in the middle point of that part ; and if the load is&nbsp;not uniformly diffused, we may still suppose it united at its&nbsp;centre of gravity. Thus, to know the strain at D arising&nbsp;from the weight of the whole beam, we may suppose the&nbsp;whole weight accumulated in its middle point D. Also the&nbsp;strain at L, arising from the weight of the part ED, is the&nbsp;same as if this weight were accumulated in the middle point&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">d</span><span class="font1"> of ED ; and it is the same as if half the weight of ED&nbsp;were hung on at D. For the real strain at L is the upward pressure at G, acting by the lever GL. Now, calling&nbsp;the weight of the part DE </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e,</span><span class="font1"> this upward pressure will be&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span class="font1"> × «ZE ½ e × DE</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">EG <sup>,</sup>°<sup>r</sup> EG *</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Therefore the strain on the middle of a beam, arising from its own weight, or from any uniform load, is the weight</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ED</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">of the beam or its load × == × DG ; that is, half the iSLr</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">weight of the beam or load multiplied or acting by the lever DG ; for </span><span class="font0">∣</span><span class="font1">5 is ⅛.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Also the strain at L, arising from the weight of the beam, or the uniform load, is ½ the weight of the beam or load&nbsp;acting by the lever LG. It is therefore proportional to&nbsp;LG, and is greatest of all at D. Therefore a beam of uniform strength throughout, uniformly loaded, will break in&nbsp;the middle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is of importance to know the relation between the strains arising from the weights of the bcams, or from any&nbsp;uniformly diffused load, and tile relative strength. We have&nbsp;already seen, that the relative strength&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">m</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">is a number to be discovered by experiment for every different species of materials. Leaving out every circumstance but what depends on the dimensions of the beam, viz. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">d, b,</span><span class="font1"> and Z, we see that the relative strength is in the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(i^jj .</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">proportion of -y, that is, as the breadth and the square of</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">the depth directly, and the length inversely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Now, to consider, first, the strain arising from the weight of the beam itself, it is evident that this weight increases&nbsp;in the same proportion with the depth, the breadth, and the&nbsp;length of the beam. Therefore its power of resisting this&nbsp;strain must be as its depth directly, and the square of its&nbsp;length inversely. To consider this in a more popular planner, it is plain that the increase of breadth makes no change&nbsp;in the power of resisting the actual strain, because the load&nbsp;and the absolute strength increase in the same proportion&nbsp;with the breadth. But, by increasing the depth, we increase the resisting section in the same proportion, and&nbsp;therefore the number of resisting fibres and the absolute&nbsp;strength ; but we also increase the weight in the same proportion. This makes a compensation, and the relative&nbsp;strength is yet the same. But, by increasing the depth,&nbsp;we have not only increased the absolute strength, but also&nbsp;its mechanical energy. For the resistance to fracture is&nbsp;the same as if the full strength of each fibre was exerted&nbsp;at the point which we called the centre of effort ; and we&nbsp;showed that the distance of this from the under side of the&nbsp;beam was a certain portion (a half, a third, a fourth, &amp;c.)&nbsp;of the whole depth of the beam. This distance is the arm&nbsp;of the lever, by which the cohesion of the wood may be&nbsp;supposed to act. Therefore this arm of the lever, and consequently the energy of the resistance, increases in the proportion of the depth of the beam, and this remains uncompensated by any increase of the strain. On the whole,&nbsp;therefore, the power of the beam to sustain its own weight&nbsp;increases in the proportion of its depth. But, on the other</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1">hand, the power of withstanding a given strain applied at its extremity, or to any aliquot part of its length, is diminished as the length increases, or is inversely as the length ;&nbsp;and the strain arising from the weight of the beam also increases as the length. Therefore the power of resisting&nbsp;the strain actually exerted on it by the weight of the beam&nbsp;is inversely as the square of the length. On the whole,&nbsp;therefore, the power of a beam to carry its own weight&nbsp;varies in the proportion of its depth directly and the square&nbsp;of its length inversely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As this strain is frequently a considerable part of the whole, it is proper to consider it apart, and then to reckon&nbsp;only on what remains for the support of any extraneous&nbsp;load.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the next place, the power of a beam to carry any load which is uniformly diffused over its length, must be&nbsp;inversely as the square of the length ; for the power of&nbsp;withstanding any strain applied to an aliquot part of the&nbsp;length (which is the case here, because the load may be&nbsp;conceived as accumulated at its centre of gravity, the&nbsp;middle point of the beam) is inverselyas the length ; and&nbsp;the actual strain is as the length, and therefore its momentum is as the square of the length. Therefore the power&nbsp;of a beam to carry a weight uniformly diffused over it, is&nbsp;inversely as the square of the length.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is here understood, that the uniform load is of some determined quantity for every foot of the length, so that&nbsp;a beam of double length carries a double load.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We have hitherto supposed that the forces which tend to break a beam transversely are acting in a direction perpendicular to the beam. This is always the case in level&nbsp;floors loaded in any manner ; but in roofs, the action of&nbsp;the load tending to break the rafters is oblique, because&nbsp;gravity always acts in vertical lines. It may also frequently&nbsp;happen, that a beam is strained by a force acting obliquely.&nbsp;This modification of the strain is easily discussed. Suppose that the external force, which is measured by the&nbsp;weight W in fig. 1, acts in the direction A«/ instead of&nbsp;AW. Draw Cα<sup>,</sup> perpendicular to A«). Then the momentum of this external force is not to be measured by&nbsp;W × AC, but by W × β<sup>,</sup>C. The strain therefore by which&nbsp;the fibres in the section of fracture DC are torn asunder,&nbsp;is diminished in the proportion of CA to Cα', that is, in the&nbsp;proportion of radius to the sine of the angle CAβ', which&nbsp;the beam makes with the direction of the external force.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">To apply this to our purpose in the most familiar manner, let AB (fig. 3) be an oblique rafter of a building, loaded with a&nbsp;weight W suspended to any point C,&nbsp;and thereby occasioning a strain in&nbsp;some part D. We have already&nbsp;seen, that the immediate cause of&nbsp;the strain on D is the re-action of the&nbsp;support which is given to the point&nbsp;B. The rafter may at present be&nbsp;considered as a lever, supported at&nbsp;A, and pulled down by the line CW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This occasions a pressure on B, and the support acts in the opposite direction to the action of the lever,&nbsp;that is, in the direction B </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">b,</span><span class="font1"> perpendicular to BA. This&nbsp;tends to break the beam in every part. The pressure ex-</span></p>
