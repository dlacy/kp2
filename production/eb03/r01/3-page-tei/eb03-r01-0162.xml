They have only agreed, that upon its enlargement all its faculties are to receive an increaſe cf power ; and " ha-&gt;i(ig already equipped it ſo exquiſitely with conſciouſneſs, activity, and perception in and of itſelf, and put it into ſo complete a capacity for happinefs and miſery in a ſeparate ſtate,” their hypotheſis does not require them to admît the leaſt occaſion for a reſurrection ; which accordingly is ſaid to have been an article of Baxter’s creed (o).</p><p>A third opinion, which extends likewife to every ſpe-cies of plant and animal, is, that all ſouls were created at once with bodies of ether; that theſe bodies, occupying only a very ſmall ſpace, were packed up in their firſt progenitors, and there left to be afterwards evolved and clothed with matter of a groſſer kind by acts of gene-ration and confequent nutrition. For the proof of this theory we are referred to the ſmall animals ſeen through the microſcope, and likewiſe to thoſe which are ſuppo-ſed to eſcape even microſcopic obſervation ; but, above all, to the eggs of infects, which, though ſcarcely per-ceptſhle, yet contain in embryo a future caterpillar and all its coats, and within theſe a future butterfly with its legs and wings. Theſe philoſophers can per-haps account for the general taint of original tin in fome other way than has hitherto been done, we have only to add, that on their fcheme the reſurrection is not a matter that feems to be indifferent.</p><p>The next thing that falls to be conſidered is the place of the dead. From a natural enough aſſociation of ideas, an opinion had very early prevailed, that the ſpirit continued near to the body; and the offerings therefore intended for the dead were by moſt nations pre-ſented at the grave ; and that on which the departed ſpirit is ſuppoſed to reſt is always placed near the grave in China.</p><p>From the dreams of the night and the natural tendency of the fancy to work and to ſummon up ſpectres when the world around us is involved in darkneſs, it has alſo been imagined, that theſe ſpirſts delight in the night and ſhadow of death (p),or have been prohibited from enjoying the exhilarating beams of day. And hence we are told,</p><p>That in the difmal regions of the dead</p><p>Th’ infernal king once rais’d his horrid head ;</p><p>Leap’d from his throne, leſt Neptune’s arm ſhould lay</p><p>H is dark dominions open to the day,</p><p>And pour in light.</p><p>The nations, therefore, who have fancied a generaI receptacle for the dead, have thus been induced to</p><p>place it in the weſt (qJ,  where the night begins and the day ends. That part of the world which, in the diviſion of his father’s dominions, fell to Pluto the in-fernal god, and where, according to Lactantius, Satan holds the empire of darknefs, the Friendly Iſlanders have placed to the weſtward of a certain iſland which they call <hi rend="italic">Tejee. ;</hi>  ſome tribes of American Indians, in a country beyond the weſtern mountains ; and Homer, ſomewhere to the weſtward of Greece at the boundaries of the ocean,</p><p>where in a lonely land and gloomy cells</p><p>The duſky nation of Cimmeria dwells ;</p><p>'ſ'he ſun ne’er views th’ uncomfortable feats when radiant he advances nor retreats.</p><p>Unhappy race ! whom endlefs night invades,</p><p>Clouds the dull air, and wraps them round in ſhades.</p><p>Another opinion entertained by the Greeks and fome other nations was, that the place of departed ſpirits is under the earth. This opinion is frequently mentioned in Homer, in virgil, and ; Jaded to by the Jewiſh prophets. As for the prophets, we know the circumſtance from which they borrowed it : it was borrowed from thofe ſubterraneous vaults where their chiefs were bu-ried, and which have been deſcribed by modern travellers» In the ſides of theſe caverns there is ranged a great number of cells; and in theſe cells the mighty lay in a fort of ſtate, with their weapons of war and their ſwords at their head. To thefe kinds of Egyptian cemeteries Ezekiel alludes, when he ſays, " that they ſhall not lie with the mighty that are fallen of the uncircum-cifed, who are gone down to hell with their weapons of war, and they have laid their ſwords under their head.” And Iſaiah, when thus ſpeaking of the prince of Ba-bylon, " Thou ſhalt be brought down to hell, <hi rend="italic">to the ſides of the pit.</hi>  Hell from beneath is moved for thee, to meet thee at thy coming ; it ſtirreth up the dead for thee, even all the chief ones of the earth ; it hath raiſed up from their thrones all the kings of the nations. All the kings of the nations, even all of them, lie in glory, every one in his own houſe.”</p><p>Many of the ancient fathers of the church aſſerted only, that the dead are now <hi rend="italic">in abditis receptaculis,</hi>  or in certain hidden and concealed places.</p><p>orpheus, o∏gen, and forne others of the fathers, with the ancient Caledonian bard oſſian, and the learn-ed Dodwell among the moderns, imagined that the fouI, when it left the body, went into the air, and reſided ſomewhere between the furfacc of the earth and the moon.</p><p>Thoſe who believed in a tranſmigration cauſed the ſoul at death only to enter a new body, and kept the departed always with the living. This creed has been found in India, in Egypt, in Mexico, and in all thoſe countries where picture-writing has been much uſed. In this ſpecies oſ writing, the ſame picture is on fancied analogy transferred by metaphor to ſignify ei-</p><p>(o)    <hi rend="italic">An Hiβorical View oſ the Controverſy concerning an Intermediate State, anddhe Separate Exiβence of the Soul.</hi></p><p>(p)    Some Turkiſh ghoſts are an exception, who uſe lamps or candles in their tombs, when their friends-chooſe to ſupply them with thefe luxuries.</p><p>(g_) The <hi rend="italic">weβ</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">darkneſs</hi>  are ſynonymous in Homer. <hi rend="italic"><hi rend="sup">il</hi>  φ,∖<hi rend="sub">0</hi>∣, « γa<hi rend="sub">ρ</hi>  ι<hi rend="sup">,</hi><hi rend="sub">l</hi>tμιι S*» ζ<hi rend="sub">o</hi>&lt;<hi rend="sub">f</hi>oς,</hi>  ouΓ <hi rend="italic">ox* t∣aς.
