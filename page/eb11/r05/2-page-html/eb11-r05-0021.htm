<p><span class="font0">Montmorency. A letter to Voltaire on his poem about the Lisbon earthquake embittered the dislike between the two, being&nbsp;surreptitiously published. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">La Nouvelle Héloïse</span><span class="font0"> appeared in the&nbsp;same year (1760), and it was immensely popular. In 1762&nbsp;appeared the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Contrat social</span><span class="font0"> at Amsterdam, and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Émile</span><span class="font0">, which&nbsp;was published both in the Low Countries and at Paris. For the&nbsp;latter the author received 6000 livres, for the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Contrat</span><span class="font0"> 1000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Julie, ou La Nouvelle Héloïse,</span><span class="font0"> is a novel written in letters describing the loves of a man of low position and a girl of&nbsp;rank, her subsequent marriage to a respectable freethinker&nbsp;of her own station, the mental agonies of her lover, and the&nbsp;partial appeasing of the distresses of the lovers by the influence&nbsp;of noble sentiment and the good offices of a philanthropic&nbsp;Englishman. It is too long, the sentiment is overstrained,&nbsp;and severe moralists have accused it of a certain complaisance&nbsp;in dealing with amatory errors; but it is full of pathos and&nbsp;knowledge of the human heart. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Contrai social,</span><span class="font0"> as its&nbsp;title implies, endeavours to base all government on the consent,&nbsp;direct or implied, of the governed, and indulges in much ingenious argument to get rid of the practical inconveniences&nbsp;of such a suggestion. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Émile,</span><span class="font0"> the second title of which is </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">De&nbsp;VÉducation,</span><span class="font0"> is much more of a treatise than of a novel, though&nbsp;a certain amount of narrative interest is kept up throughout.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rousseau’s reputation was now higher than ever, but the term of the comparative prosperity which he had enjoyed&nbsp;for nearly ten years was at hand. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Contrat social</span><span class="font0"> was&nbsp;obviously anti-monarchic; the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Nouvelle Héloïse</span><span class="font0"> was said to&nbsp;be immoral; the sentimental deism of the “ Profession du&nbsp;vicaire Savoyard ” in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Émile</span><span class="font0"> irritated equally the philosophe&nbsp;party and the church. On June n, 1762, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Émile</span><span class="font0"> was condemned by the parlement of Paris, and two days previously&nbsp;Madame de Luxembourg and the prince de Conti gave the&nbsp;author information that he would be arrested if he did not&nbsp;fly. They also * furnished him with means of flight, and he&nbsp;nnade for Yverdun in the territory of Bern, whence he transferred himself to Motiers in Neuchâtel, which then belonged&nbsp;to Prussia. Frederick II. was not indisposed to protect the&nbsp;persecuted when it cost him nothing and might bring him&nbsp;fame, and in Marshal Keith, the governor of Neuchâtel,&nbsp;Rousseau found a true and firm friend. He was, however,&nbsp;unable to be quiet or to practise any of those more or less&nbsp;pious frauds which were customary at the time with the unorthodox. The archbishop of Paris had published a pastoral&nbsp;against him, and Rousseau did not let the year pass without&nbsp;a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lettre à M. de Beaumont.</span><span class="font0"> The council of Geneva had joined&nbsp;in the condemnation of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Émile,</span><span class="font0"> and Rousseau first solemnly&nbsp;renounced his citizenship, and then, in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lettres de la montagne</span><span class="font0"> (1763), attacked the council and the Genevan constitution unsparingly. All this excited public opinion against him,&nbsp;and gradually he grew unpopular in his own neighbourhood.&nbsp;This unpopularity is said on uncertain authority to have culminated in a nocturnal attack on his house. At any rate he&nbsp;thought he was menaced if he was not, and migrated to the&nbsp;île St Pierre in the Lake of Bienne, where he once more for&nbsp;a short, and the last, time enjoyed that idyllic existence which&nbsp;he loved. But the Bernese government ordered him to quit&nbsp;its territory. He was for some time uncertain' where to&nbsp;go, and thought of Corsica (to join Paoli) and Berlin. But&nbsp;finally David Hume offered him, late in 1765, an asylum in&nbsp;England, and he accepted. He passed through Paris, where his&nbsp;presence was tolerated for a time, and landed in England on&nbsp;January 13, 1766. Thérèse travelled separately, and was entrusted to the charge of James Boswell, who had already&nbsp;made Rousseau’s acquaintance. Here he had once more a&nbsp;chance of settling peaceably. Severe English moralists like&nbsp;Johnson thought but ill of him, but the public generally was&nbsp;not unwilling to testify against French intolerance, and regarded his sentimentalism with favour. He was lionized in&nbsp;London to his heart’s content and discontent, for it may truly&nbsp;be said of Rousseau that he was equally indignant at neglect&nbsp;and intolerant of attention. When, after not a few displays&nbsp;of his strange humour, he professed himself tired of the capital,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Hume procured him a country abode in the house of Mr Davenport at Wootton in Derbyshire. Here, though the place was bleak and lonely, he might have been happy enough, and he&nbsp;actually employed himself in writing the greater part of his&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Confessions.</span><span class="font0"> But his habit of self-tormenting and tormenting&nbsp;others never left him. His own caprices interposed some&nbsp;delay in the conferring of a pension which George III. was&nbsp;induced to grant him, and he took this as a crime of Hume’s.&nbsp;The publication of a spiteful letter (really by Horace Walpole,&nbsp;one of whose worst deeds it was) in the name of the king of&nbsp;Prussia made Rousseau believe that plots of the most terrible&nbsp;kind were on foot against him. Finally he quarrelled with&nbsp;Hume because the latter would not acknowledge all his own&nbsp;friends and Rousseau’s supposed enemies of the philosophe&nbsp;circle to be rascals. He remained, however, at Wootton&nbsp;during the year and through the winter. In May 1767 he&nbsp;fled to France, addressing letters to the lord chancellor and&nbsp;to General Conway, which can only be described as the letters&nbsp;of a lunatic. He was received in France hy the marquis de&nbsp;Mirabeau (father of the great Mirabeau), of whom he soon had&nbsp;enough, then by the prince de Conti at Trye. From this&nbsp;place he again fled and wandered about for some time in a&nbsp;wretched fashion, still writing the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Confessions,</span><span class="font0"> constantly&nbsp;receiving generous help, and always quarrelling with, or at&nbsp;least suspecting, the helpers. In the summer of 1770 he returned to Paris, resumed music-copying, and was on the whole&nbsp;happier than he had been since he had to leave Montlouis.&nbsp;He had by this time married Thérèse le Vasseur, or had at&nbsp;least gone through some form of marriage with her.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Many of the best-known stories of Rousseau’s life date from this last time, when he was tolerably accessible to visitors,&nbsp;though clearly half-insane. He finished his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Confessions,</span><span class="font0"> wrote&nbsp;his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dialogues</span><span class="font0"> (the interest of which is not quite equal to the&nbsp;promise of their curious .sub-title, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rousseau juge de Jean Jacques),&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and began his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Reveries du promeneur solitaire,</span><span class="font0"> intended as a&nbsp;sequel and complement to the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Confessions,</span><span class="font0"> and one of the&nbsp;best of all his books. It should be said that besides these,&nbsp;which complete the list of his principal works, he has left a&nbsp;very large number of minor works and a considerable correspondence. During this time he lived in the Rue Platière,&nbsp;which is now named after him. But his suspicions of secret&nbsp;enemies grew stronger rather than weaker, and at the beginning of 1778 he was glad to accept the offer of M. de Girardin,&nbsp;a rich financier, and occupy a cottage at Ermenonville. The&nbsp;country was beautiful; but his old terrors revived, and his&nbsp;woes were complicated by the alleged inclination of Thérèse&nbsp;for one of M. de Girardin’s stable-boys. On July 2nd he died&nbsp;in a manner which has been much discussed, suspicions of&nbsp;suicide being circulated at the time by Grimm and others.@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There is little doubt that for the last ten or fifteen years of his life, if not from the time of his quarrel with Diderot and&nbsp;Madame d’Épinay, Rousseau was not wholly sane—the combined influence of late and unexpected literary fame and of&nbsp;constant solitude and discomfort acting upon his excitable&nbsp;temperament so as to overthrow tbe balance, never very stable,&nbsp;of his fine and acute but unrobust intellect. He was by no&nbsp;means the only man of letters of his time who had to submit&nbsp;to something like persecution. Fréron on the orthodox side&nbsp;had his share of it, as well as Voltaire, Helvétius, Diderot&nbsp;and Montesquieu on that of the innovators. But Rousseau&nbsp;had not, like Montesquieu, a position which guaranteed him&nbsp;from serious danger; he was not wealthy like Helvétius; he&nbsp;had not the wonderful suppleness and trickiness which even&nbsp;without his wealth would probably have defended Voltaire&nbsp;himself; and he lacked entirely the “ bottom ” of Fréron and&nbsp;Diderot. When he was molested he could only shriek at his</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@1</sup> The local inquiry into the death, on the following day, resulted in a certificate that he died of apoplexy; but the story that he&nbsp;shot himself persisted. In December 1897 Rousseau’s coffin in the&nbsp;Panthéon was opened, and M. Berthelot, who examined the skull,&nbsp;found no trace of injury by a bullet; and on the whole there is no&nbsp;reason to doubt the verdict of the original inquiry at Ermenonville.</span></p>
