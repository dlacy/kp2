They would not permit their slaves to learn either the tune or the words of their most admired odes; or, which is all one, they would not permit them to sing them if they had learned them. Though the youth of the male sex were much cherished and beloved, as those that were to build up and continue the future glory of the state, yet in Sparta it was a virtuous and modest affection, untinged with that sensuality which was so scandalous at Athens. The good effects of this part of Lycurgus’s institutions were seen in the union that reigned among his citizens; and which was so extraordinary, that even in cases of competition, it was hardly known that rivals bore ill-will to each other; but, on the contrary, their love to the same person produced a secondary friendship among themselves, and united them in all things which might be for the benefit of the person beloved.</p><p>Some authors have accused this great lawgiver of encouraging theft in his institutions; which, they say, was not held scandalous among the Spartans, if it were so dexterously managed as that the person was not detected in it. But this is certain, and seems to be a strong contradiction of the heinous charge, that when a theft was discovered, it was punished with the utmost severity: a person even suspected of it would endure the heaviest punishments rather than acknowledge it, and be branded with so base a crime.</p><p>IX.	The exercises instituted by law belong to the ninth table. In these all the Greeks were extremely careful, but the Lacedæmonians in a degree beyond the rest ; for if a youth, by his corpulence, or any other means, became unfit for these exercises, he underwent public contempt at least, if not banishment. Hunting was the usual diversion of their children ; nay, it was made a part of their education, because it had a tendency to strengthen their limbs, and to render those who practised it supple and fleet. Dogs for hunting were reared with great care. They had a kind of public dances, in which they exceedingly delighted, and which were common alike to virgins and young men : in deed, in all their sports, girls were allowed to divert thcm selves with the youths ; insomuch, that, at darting, throwing the quoit, pitching the bar, and such like robust diversions, the women were as dexterous as the men. For the manifest oddity of this proceeding, Lycurgus assigned no other reason, than that he sought to render women, as well as men, strong and healthy, that the children they brought forth might be so too. Violent exercises, and a laborious kind of life, were only enjoined the youth ; for when they were grown up to men’s estate, that is, were upwards of thirty years old, they were exempted from all kinds of la bour, and enjoyed themselves wholly either in affairs of state, or in war. They had a method of whipping, at a cer tain time, young men in the temple of Diana, and about her altar ; which, however palliated, was certainly unnatural and cruel. It was esteemed a great honour to sustain these flagellations without weeping, groaning, or showing any sense of pain ; and so strong was the thirst of glory in these young minds, that they frequently suffered death without shedding a tear, or breathing a sigh. A desire of overcoming all the weaknesses of human nature, and thus rendering his Spartans not only superior to their neighbours, but to their species, runs through many of the institutions of Lycurgus ; and by keeping this principle in view, we are enabled to understand many circumstances that must other wise appear inexplicable.</p><p>X.	Gold and silver were, by the constitutions of Lycurgus, rendered of no value in Sparta. Of the danger of riches he was so well apprised, that he rendered the very</p><p>possession of them penal ; but as some standard of value was necessary, he directed an iron coinage, whereby the Spartans were supplied with the useful money, and at the same time had no temptation to covetousness afforded them ; for a very small sum was sufficient to load a couple of horses, and a great one must have been kept in a barn or warehouse. The introduction of all foreign money was also prohibited, that corruption might not enter under the name of commerce. The most ancient method of dealing, namely, by barter or exchange of one commodity for another, was preserved by law in Sparta long after it had fallen into disuse everywhere else. Interest was forbidden in the Spartan commonwealth ; where they had also a law against alienation of lands, accepting presents from foreigners, even without the limits of their own country, and when their authority and character might well seem to excuse them.</p><p>XI.	Such of the laws of Sparta as related to courts of justice may be brought under the eleventh table. Thirty years must have passed over the head of him who had a right to concern himself in juridical proceedings. Young men were thought unfit for them ; and it was even considered as indecent for a man to have any fondness for law suits, or to be busying himself at the tribunals, when he had no affairs there of his own. By these rules Lycurgus thought to exclude litigiousness, and to prevent that multiplicity of suits which seems to be a necessary evil in other states. As young people were not permitted to inquire about the laws of other countries, and as they were hindered from hearing judicial proceedings in their courts, so they were likewise forbidden to ask any questions about, or to endeavour to discover, the reasons of the laws by which themselves were governed. Obedience was their duty ; and to that alone they would have them kept. Men of abandoned characters, or who were notoriously of ill fame, lost all right of giving their votes in respect of public affairs, or of speaking in public assemblies ; for they could not believe that a man unprincipled in private life could be better affected to his country than to his neighbour.</p><p>XII.	Before the age of thirty, a Spartan was not capable of serving in the army, as the best authors agree ; though some think that the military age is not well ascertained by ancient writers. Their forces were forbidden to march at any time before the full-moon ; the reason of which law is very hard to be discovered, if indeed it bad any reason at all, or was not rather founded on some superstitious opi nion, that this conjuncture was more lucky than any other. They were likewise forbidden to fight often against the same enemy. This was one of the wisest maxims in the political system of Lycurgus ; and Agesilaus, by offending against it, destroyed the power of his country, and lost her that authority which for many years she had maintained over the rest of Greece ; for, by continually warring against the Thebans, to whom she had an inveterate hatred, he at last beat them into the knowledge of the art of war, and enabled them, under the command of Epaminondas, to main tain for a time the principality of Greece. With maritime affairs they were forbidden to meddle, though the necessity of things compelled them, in process of time, to transgress this institution, and by degrees to transfer to themselves the dominion of the sea as well as of the land ; but, after the Peloponnesian war, they again neglected naval affairs, from a persuasion that sailors and strangers corrupted those with whom they conversed. As they never fortified Sparta, they were not ready to undertake sieges : fighting in the field was their proper province, and, while they could there overcome their enemies, they rightly conceived that nothing could hurt them at home. In time of war, they relaxed somewhat of their strict manners of living. The true rea son for this was, in all probability, that war might be less burdensome to them ; for, as we have more than once ob served, a strong desire to render them bold and warlike was</p></body></text></TEI>
