Dr Campbell, in his beautiful tranſlation of the Goſpels, has adopted this method with great judgment and ſucceſs; and he who will, read that tranſlation, will perceive that this ſingle alteration renders the Goſpels much more intelligible, and, we may add, more entertaining @@<hi rend="smallcaps">(e).</hi></p><p>The word ΕϒΑΓΓΕΛΙΟΝ ſignifies any joyful tidings, and exactly correſponds to our Engliſh word <hi rend="smallcaps">Gospel. </hi>In the New Teſtament this term is confined to “The glad tidings of the coming of the Meſſiah.” Thus, in Mat. xi. 5. our Lord ſays, “The poor have the Goſpel preached;” that is, The coming of the Meſſiah is preached to the poor. Hence the name of <hi rend="italic">Goſpel</hi> was given to the hiſtories of Chriſt, in which the good news of the coming of the Meſſiah, with all its joyful circumſtances, are recorded.</p><p>That the Goſpel according to Matthew was compoſed, ſays Dr Campbell, by one born a Jew, familiarly acquainted with the opinions, ceremonies, and cuſtoms of his countrymen; that it was compoſed by one converſant in the ſacred writings, and habituated to their idiom; a man of plain ſenſe, but of little or no learning, except what he derived from the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament; and finally, that it was the production of a man who wrote from conviction, and had attended cloſely to the facts and ſpeeches which he related, but who in writing entertained not the moſt diſtant view of ſetting off himſelf—we have as ſtrong internal evidence as the nature of the thing will admit, and much ſtronger than that wherein the mind ninety-nine cafes out of a hundred acquieſces.</p><p>That the author of this hiſtory of our bleſſed Saviour was Matthew, appears from the teſtimony of the early Chriſtians. It is atteſted by Jerome, Auguſtin, Epiphanius, and Chryſoſtom, and in ſuch a manner as ſhews that they knew the fact to be uncontroverted, and judged it to be incontrovertible. Origen, who flouriſhed in the former part of the 3d century, is alſo reſpectable authority. He is quoted by Euſebius in a chapter @@* wherein he ſpecially treats of Origen’s account of the ſacred canon. <hi rend="italic">“As</hi> I have learned (ſays Origen) <hi rend="italic">by tradition</hi> concerning the four goſpels, which alone are received without diſpute by the whole church of God under heaven; the firſt was written by Matthew, once a publican, afterwards an apoſtle of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi rend="italic">who delivered it to the Jewiſh believers, compoſed in the Hebrew language.” </hi>In another place he ſays, “Matthew writing for the Hebrews who expected him who was to deſcend from Abraham and David, ſays the lineage of Jeſus Chriſt, ſon of David, ſon of Abraham.” It muſt be obſerved, that the Greek word παραδοσις does not exactly correſpond to the Engliſh word <hi rend="italic">tradition,</hi> which ſignifies any thing delivered orally from age to age. Παραδησις properly implies any thing tranſmitted from former ages, whether by oral or written teſtimony. In this acceptation we find it uſed in ſcripture@@†: “Hold the traditions (τας παραϐοσεις) which ye have been taught, <hi rend="italic">whether by word</hi> or <hi rend="italic">our epistle." </hi>The next authority to which we ſhall have recourſe is that of Irenæus biſhop of Lyons, who had been a diſciple of Polycarp.
