S.W. by steam tramway, not far from the N. bank of the Po, 59 ft. above sea-level. Pop. (1901) 1835 (town); 7016 (commune). Its period of prosperity was under Vespasiano Gonzaga (d. 1591), who was its duke; by him it was transformed into a small “ Residenzstadt.” It was well fortified and built, and from this period date the ducal palace (now the Municipio), the theatre designed by Scomozzi, &amp;amp;c. The church and the summer palace contain frescoes by the Campi of Cremona. Here in 1567 a Hebrew printing-press was set up.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
