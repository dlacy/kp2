<p><span class="font0">Thoſe who have a talent for ridicule, which is ſeldom united with a taſte for delicate and refined beauties, are quick-ſighted in improprieties ; and theſe they eagerly graſp, in order to gratiſy their favourite propen-ſity. Perfons galled are provoked to maintain that ridicule is improper for grave ſubjects. Subjects really&nbsp;grave are by no means fit for ridicule ; but then it is&nbsp;urged againſt them, that, when called in queſtion whether a certain ſubject be really grave, ridicule is the&nbsp;only means of determining the controverſy. Hence a&nbsp;celebrated queſtion, Whether ridicule be or be not a&nbsp;teſt of truth ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On one ſide, it is obſerved, that the objects of ridicule are falſehood, incongruity, impropriety, or turpitude of certain kinds : but as the object of every excited paſſion muſt be examined by reaſon, before we can determine whether it be proper or improper ; ſo ridicule muſt, apparently at leaſt, eſtabliſh the truth of the&nbsp;improprieties deſigned to excite the paſſion of contempt.&nbsp;Hence it comes in to the aid of argument and reaſon,&nbsp;when its impreſſions on the imagination are conſiſtent&nbsp;with the nature of things; but when it ſtrikes the fancy</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">and affections with fictitious images, it becomes the in-ſtrument of deceit. But however ridicule may impreſs the idea of apparent turpitude or falſehood in the imagination, yet ſtill reaſon remains the ſupreme judge ;&nbsp;and thus ridicule can never be the final teſt or touch-ſtone of truth and falſehood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On the other ſide, it is contended that ridicule is not a ſubject of reaſoning, but of ſenſe or taſte ; (ſee&nbsp;and compare the articles Risible and Congrui-ty. Stating the queſtion, then, in more accurate&nbsp;terms, Whether the ſenſe of ridicule be the proper teſt for diſtinguiſhing ridiculous objects from what&nbsp;are not ſo ? they proceed thus : No perſon doubts that&nbsp;our fenſe of beauty is the true teſt of what is beautiful;&nbsp;and our ſenſe of grandeur, of what is great or ſublime.&nbsp;Is it more doubtful whether our ſenſe of ridicule be&nbsp;the true teſt of what is ridiculous ? It is not only the&nbsp;true teſt, but indeed the only teſt ; for this ſubject&nbsp;comes not, more than beauty or grandeur, under the&nbsp;province of reaſon. If any ſubject, by the influence&nbsp;of faſhion or cuſtom, have acquired a degree of vene*&nbsp;ration to which naturally it is not entitled, what are&nbsp;the proper means for wiping off the artificial colouring,&nbsp;and diſplaying the ſubject in its true light ? A man&nbsp;of true taſte fees the ſubject without diſguiſe ; but if&nbsp;he heſitate, let him apply the teſt of ridicule, which&nbsp;ſeparates it from its artificial connections, and expoſes&nbsp;it naked with all its native improprieties.—But it is urged, that the graveſt and moſt ſerious matters may be&nbsp;ſet in a ridiculous light. Hardly ſo; for where an object is neither rifible nor improper, it lies not open in&nbsp;any quarter to an attack from ridicule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RIDING, in general, ſignifies the being carried along on any vehicle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Riding on horſeback. See Horsemanship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Riding, in medicine. During this exerciſe all the viſcera are ſhaken, and preſſed againſt each other ; at&nbsp;the ſame time the pure air acts with a greater force on&nbsp;the lungs. Weakly perſons, or thoſe whoſe ſtomachs&nbsp;are infirm, ſhould, however, be cautious of riding before their meals are ſomewhat digeſted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Riding, in naval affairs, is the ſtate of a ſhip’s being retained in a particular ſtation, by means of one or more&nbsp;cables with their anchors, which are for this purpoſe&nbsp;ſunk into the bottom of the ſea, &amp;c. in order to prevent the veſſel from being driven at the mercy of the&nbsp;wind or current.—A rope is ſaid to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ride,</span><span class="font0"> when one&nbsp;of the turns by which it is wound about the capſtern&nbsp;or windlaſs lies over another, ſo as to interrupt the operation of heaving.</span></p>

When&nbsp;a ſhip does not labour heavily, or feel a great ſtrain&nbsp;when anchored in an open road or bay, ſhe is ſaid to&nbsp;ride eaſy. Gn the contrary, when ſhe pitches violently&nbsp;into the ſea, ſo as to ſtrain her cables, malls, or hull,&nbsp;it is called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">riding hard,</span><span class="font0"> and the veſſel is termed a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">bad</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
