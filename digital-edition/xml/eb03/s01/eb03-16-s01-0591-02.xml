an offering made to God on an altar, by means of a regular miniſter, as an acknowledgment of his power, and a payment of homage. Sacrifices (though the term is ſometimes uſed to comprehend all the offerings made to God, or in any way devoted to his ſervice and honour) differ from mere oblations in this, that in a ſacrifice there is a real deſtruction or change of the thing offered; whereas an oblation is only a ſimple offering or gift, without any ſuch change at all: thus, all forts of tythes, and firſt fruits, and whatever of mens worldly ſub- ſtance is conſecrated to God, for the ſupport of his worſhip and the maintenance of his miniſters, are offerings or oblations: and theſe, under the Jewiſh law, were either of living creatures or other things: but ſacrifices, in the more peculiar ſenſe of the term, were either wholly or in part conſumed by fire. They have by divines been divided into bloody and unbloody. Bloody ſacriſices were made of living creatures; unbloody of the fruits of the earth. They have alſo been divided into <hi rend="italic">expiatory, impetrαtory,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">euchariſtical.</hi> The firſt kind were offered to obtain of God forgiveneſs of sins; the ſecond, to procure ſome favour; and the third, to expreſs thankfulneſs for favours already received. Under one or other of theſe heads may all ſacriſices be arranged; though we are told, that the Egyptians had 666 different kinds, a number ſurpaſſing all credibility.</p><p>Concerning the origin of ſacriſices very various opinions have been held. By many, the Phoenicians are ſuppoſed to have been the authors of them; though Porphyry attributes their invention to the Egyptians; and Ovid imagines, from the import of the name <hi rend="italic">victim</hi> and <hi rend="italic">hoftia,</hi> that no bloody ſacriſices were offered till wars prevailed in the world, and nations obtained victories</p><p>over their enemies. Theſe are mere hypotheſes, contradicted by the moſt authentic records of antiquity, and entitled to no regard.</p><p>By modern deiſts, ſacriſices are ſaid to have had their origin in ſuperſtition, which operates much in the ſame way in every country. It is therefore weak, according to thoſe men, to derive this practice from any particular people; ſince the ſame mode of reaſoning would lead various nations, without any intercourſe with each other, to entertain the ſame opinions reſpecting the nature of their gods, and the proper means of appeaſing their anger. Men of groſs conceptions imagine their deities to be like themſelves, covetous and cruel. They are accuſtomed to appeaſe an injured neighbour by a compoſition in money; and they endeavour to compound in the ſame manner with their gods, by rich offerings to their temples and to their prieſts. The moſt valuable property of a ſimple people is their cattle. Theſe offered in ſacrifice are ſuppoſed to be fed upon by the divinity, and are actually fed upon by his prieſts. If a crime is committed which requires the puniſhment of death, it is accounted perfectly fair to appeaſe the deity by offering one life for another; becauſe, by ſavages, puniſhment is conſidered as a debt for which a man may compound in the beſt way that he can, and which one man may pay for another. Hence, it is ſaid, aroſe the abſurd notions of imputed guilt and vicarious atonement. Among the Egyptians, a white bull was choſen as an expiatory ſacrifice to their god Apis. After being killed at the altar, his head was cut off, and call into the river, with the following execration: “May all the evils impending over thoſe who perform this ſacriſice, or over the Egyptians in general, be averted on this head<note anchored="true" n="1" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>*Herodotus, <hi rend="italic">lib. 2.</hi></p></note> *. ”</p><p>Had ſacrifice never prevailed in the world but among ſuch groſs idolaters as worſhipped departed heroes, who were ſuppoſed to retain in their ſtate of deification all the paſſions and appetites of their mortal ſtate, this account of the origin of that mode of worſhip would have been to us perfectly ſatisfactory. We readily admit, that ſuch mean notions of their gods may have actually led far diſtant tribes, who could not derive any thing from each other through the channel of tradition, to imagine that beings of human paſſions and appetites might be appeaſed or bribed by coſtly offerings. But we know from the moſt incontrovertible authority, that ſacriſices of the three kinds that we have mentioned were in uſe among people who worſhipped the true God, and who muſt have had very correct notions of his attributes. Now we think it impoſſible that ſuch notions could have led any man to fancy that the taking away of the life of a harmleſs animal, or the burning of a cake or other fruits of the earth in the fire, would be acceptable to a Being ſelf-exiſtent, omnipotent, and omniſcient, who can neither be injured by the crimes of his creatures, nor receive any acceſſion of happineſs from a thouſand worlds.</p><p>Senſible of the force of ſuch reaſoning as this, ſome perſons of great name, who admit the authenticity of the Jewiſh and Chriſtian ſacriſices, and firmly rely on the atonement made by Chriſt, are yet unwilling (it is difficult to conceive for what reaſon) to allow that ſacrifices were originally inſtituted by God. Of this way of thinking were St Chryſoſtom, Spencer, Grotius, and Warburton, as were likewiſe the Jews Maimonides, R.<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0598.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0592"/>
Levi, Ben Gerſon, and Abarbanel. The greater part of theſe writers maintain, that ſacrifices were at firſt a human inſtitution; and that God, in order to prevent their being offered to idols, introduced them into his ſervice, though he did not approve of them as good in themſelves, or as proper rites of worſhip. That the infinitely wise and good God ſhould introduce into his ſervice improper rites of worſhip, appears to us ſo extremely improbable, that we cannot but wonder how ſuch an opinion ſhould ever have found its way into the minds of ſuch men as thoſe who held it. Warburton’s theory of ſacriſice is much more plauſible, and being more lately publiſhed, is worthy of particular examination.</p><p>According to this ingenious prelate, ſacriſices had their origin in the ſentiments of the human heart, and in the ancient mode of converſmg by action in aid of words. Gratitude to God for benefits received is natural to the mind of man, as well as his bounden duty. “This duty (ſays the biſhop<note anchored="true" n="2" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>* Divine Leg. <hi rend="italic">b. ix. c. 2.</hi></p></note> *) was in the moſt early times diſcharged in expreſſive actions, the leaſt equivocal of which was the offerer’s bringing the firſt fruits of paſturage or agriculture to that ſequeſtered place where the Deity uſed to be more ſolemnly invoked, at the ſtated times of public worſhip; and there preſenting them in homage, with a demand which ſpoke to this purpoſe. — ‘I do hereby acknowledge thee, O my God! to be the author and giver of all good: and do now, with humble gratitude, return my warmeſt thanks for theſe thy bleſſings particularly beſtowed upon me. ”—Things thus devoted became thenceforth ſacred: and to prevent their <hi rend="italic">deſecration,</hi> the readieſt way was to send them to the table of the prieſt, or to conſume them in the fire of the altar. Such, in the opinion of our author, was the origin of euchariſtical ſacriſices. <hi rend="italic">Impetratory</hi> or <hi rend="italic">precative</hi> ſacriſices had, he thinks, the fame origin, and were contrived to expreſs by action an invocation for the continuance of God’s favour. “Expiatory ſacrifices (ſays the learned prelate) were in their own nature as intelligible, and in practice as rational, as either of the other two. Here, inſtead of preſenting the firſt fruits of agriculture and paſturage, in corn, wine, oil, and wool, as in the euchariſtical, or a portion of what was to be ſown or otherwiſe propagated, as in the <hi rend="italic">impetratory;</hi> ſome choſen animal precious to the repenting criminal, who deprecates or ſuppoſed to be obnoxious to the Deity who is to be appealed, was offered up and ſlain at the altar, in an action which, in all languages, when tranſlated into words, ſpeaks to this purpoſe: — ‘I confeſs my tranſgreſſions at thy footſtool, O my God! and with the deepeſt contrition implore thy pardon; confessing that I deſerve death for thoſe my offences. ’— The latter part of the confeſſion was more forcibly ex- preſſed by the <hi rend="italic">actiοn</hi> of ſtriking the devoted animal, and depriving it of life; which, when put into words, concluded in this manner, —‘ And I own that I myſelf deferve the death which I now inflict on this animal. ’</p><p>This ſyſtem of ſacriſice, which his lordſhip thinks ſo well ſupported by the moſt early movements of ſimple nature, we admit to be ingenious, but by no means ſatisfactory. That mankind in the earlier ages of the world were accuſtomed to ſupply the deficiencies of their language by expreſſive geſticulations we are not inclined to controvert: the cuſtom prevails among ſavage nations, or nations half civilized, at the preſent day. His</p><p>lordſhip, however, is of opinion, and we heartily agree with him, that our firſt parents were inſtructed by God to make articulate sounds ſignificant of ideas, notions, and things (ſee <hi rend="smallcaps">Language,</hi> n <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi> 6. ), and not left to fabricate a language for themſelves. That this heaven- taught language could be at firſt copious, no man will ſuppoſe who thinks of the paucity of ideas which thoſe who ſpoke it had to expreſs; but when we confider its origin, we cannot entertain a doubt but that it was preciſe and perſpicuous, and admirably adapted to all the real purpoſes of life. Among theſe purpoſes muſt ſurely be included the worſhip of God as the moſt important of all. Every ſentiment therefore which enters into worſhip, gratitude, invocation, confeſſion, and deprecation, the progenitors of mankind were undoubtedly taught to clothe in words the moſt ſignificant and unequivocal; but we know from Moſes, whole divine legation the hilltop ſurely admitted, that Lain and Abel, the eldeſt children of our firſt parents, worſhipped God by the rites of ſacrifice: and can we ſuppoſe that this practice occurred to <hi rend="italic">them</hi> from their having ſo far forgotten the language taught them by their father, as to be under the neceſſity of denoting by action what they could not expreſs by words? If this ſupposition be admitted, it will force another upon us ſtill more extravagant. Even Adam himſelf muſt, in that cafe, have become dumb in conſequence of his fall; for it is not conceivable, that as long as he was able to utter articulate sounds, and affix a meaning to them, he would ceaſe, in the preſence of his family, to confeſs his sins, implore forgiveneſs, and expreſs his gratitude to God for all his mercies.</p><p>The right reverend writer, as if aware of ſome ſuch objection as this to his theory, contends, that if ſacrifices had ariſen from any other ſource than the light of reason, the Scripture would not have been silent concerning that source; “eſpecially ſince we find Moſes carefully recording what <hi rend="italic">God</hi> immediately, and not <hi rend="italic">nature,</hi> taught to Adam and his family. Had the original of ſacrifice, ſays he, been preſcribed, and directly commanded by the Deity, the ſacred hiſtorian could never have omitted the expreſs mention of that circumſtance. The two capital obſervances in the Jewiſh ritual were the <hi rend="smallcaps">Sabbath</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Sacrifices. To</hi> impreſs the higheſt reverence and veneration on the <hi rend="italic">Sabbath,</hi> he is careful to record its divine original: and can we ſuppoſe that, had ſacriſices had the fame original, he would have neglected to eſtabliſh this truth at the time that he recorded the other, ſince it is of equal uſe and of equal importance? I ſhould have ſaid, indeed, of much greater; for the multifarious <hi rend="italic">ſacrifices</hi> of the <hi rend="smallcaps">law</hi> had not only a reference to the <hi rend="italic">forfeiture</hi> of Adam, but likewiſe prefigured our redemption by Jeſus Chriſt. ”</p><p>But all this reaſoning was foreſeen, and completely anſwered before his lordſhip gave it to the public. It is probable, that though the diſtinction of weeks was well known over all the eaſtern world, the Hebrews, during their reſidence in Egypt, were very negligent in their obſervance of the Sabbath. To enforce a religious obſervance of that ſacred day, it became neceſſary to inform them of the time and occaſion of its firſt inſtitution, that they might keep it holy in memory of the creation; but, in a country like Egypt, the people were in danger of holding ſacrifices rather in too high than too low veneration, ſo that there was not the ſame ne-<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0599.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0593"/>
ceſſity for mentioning explicitly the early inſtitution of them. It was ſufficient that they knew the divine inſtitution of their own ſacriſices, and the purpoſes for which they were offered. Beſides this, there is reaſon to believe, that, in order to guard the Hebrews from the infections of the heathen, the rite of ſacrificing was loaded with many additional ceremonies at its ſecond in- ſtitution under Moſes. It might, therefore, be improper to relate its original ſimplicity to a rebellious people, who would think themſelves ill-uſed by any additional burdens of trouble or expence, however really neceſſary to their happineſs. Biſhop Warburton ſees clearly the neceſſity of concealing from the Jews the ſpiritual and refined nature of the Chriſtian diſpenſation, left ſuch a backſliding people ſhould, from the contemplation of it, have held in contempt their own economy. This, he thinks, is the reaſon why the prophets, ſpeaking of the reign of the Meſſiah, borrow their images from the Moſaic diſpenſation, that the people living under that diſpenſation might not deſpiſe it from perceiving its end; and we think the reaſon will hold equally good for their lawgiver concealing from them the ſimplicity of the firſt ſacriſices, left they ſhould be tempted to murmur at their own multifarious ritual.</p><p>But his lordſhip thinks that ſacriſices had their origin from the light of natural reaſon. We ſhould be glad to know what light natural reaſon can throw upon ſuch a ſubject. That ignorant pagans, adoring as gods departed heroes, who ſtill retained their ſenſual appetites, might naturally think of appeaſing ſuch beings with the fat of fed beaſts, and the perfumes of the altar, we have already admitted; but that Cain and Abel, who knew that the God whom they adored has neither body, parts, nor paſſions; that he created and ſuſtains the univerſe; and that from his very nature he muſt will the happineſs of all his creatures, ſhould be led by the light of natural reaſon to think of appeaſing him, or obtaining favours from him, by putting to death harmleſs animals, is a poiition which no arguments of his lordſhip can ever compel us to admit. That Abel’s ſacriſice was indeed accepted, we know; but it was not accepted becauſe it proceeded from the movements of the human mind, and the deficiency of the original language, but becauſe it was offered through <hi rend="italic">faith.</hi> The light of natural reaſon, however, does not generate faith, but ſcience; and when it fails of that, its offspring is abſurdity. “Faith is the ſubſtance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not ſeen, ” and comes not by reaſoning but by hearing. What things then were they of which Abel had heard, for which he hoped, and in the faith of which he offered ſacriſice? Undoubtedly it was a reſtoration to that immortality which was forfeited by the tranſgreſſion of his parents. Of ſuch redemption an obſcure intimation had been given to Adam, in the promiſe that the ſeed of the woman ſhould bruiſe the head of the ſerpent; and it was doubtleſs to impreſs upon his mind in more ſtriking colours the manner in which this was to be done, that bloody ſacriſices were firſt inſtituted<note anchored="true" n="3" place="margin" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">†See</hi> Prophesy</p></note> †. As long as the import of ſuch rites was thus underſtood, they conſti- tuted a perfectly rational worſhip, as they fhowed the people that the wages of ſin is death; but when men ſunk into idolatry, and loſt all hopes of a reſurrection from the dead, the ſlaughtering of animals to appeaſe their deities was a practice groſsly ſuperſtitious. It reſt-</p><p>ed in itſelf without pointing to any farther end, and the grovelling worſhippers believed that by their ſacriſices they purchaſed the favour of their deities. When once this notion was entertained, human ſacriſices were ſoon introduced; for it naturally occurred to thoſe who offered them, that what they moſt valued themſelves would be moſt acceptable to their offended gods, (ſee the next article). By the Jewiſh law, theſe abominable offerings were ſtrictly forbidden, and the whole ritual of ſacrifice reſtored to its original purity, though not ſimplicity.</p><p>All Chriſtian churches, the Socinian, if it can be called a church, not excepted, have till very lately agreed in believing that the Jewiſh ſacriſices ſerved, amongſt other uſes, for types of the death of Chriſt and the Chriſtian worſhip, (fee <hi rend="smallcaps">Type. )</hi> In this belief all ſober Chriſtians agree ſtill, whilſt many are of opinion that they were likewiſe foederal rites, as they certainly were conſidered by the ancient Romans<note anchored="true" n="4" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>*<hi rend="italic"></hi> Tit. Liv. <hi rend="italic">lib. 21. cap. 45.</hi></p></note> *.</p><p>Of the various kinds of Jewiſh ſacriſices, and the ſubordinate cuds for which they were offered, a full account is given in the books of Moſes. When an Iſraelite offered a loaf or a cake, the prieſt broke it in two parts; and ſetting aſide that half which he reſerved for himſelf, broke the other into crumbs, poured oil, wine, incenſe, and ſalt upon it, and ſpread the whole upon the fire of the altar. If theſe offerings were accompanied with the ſacriſice of an animal, they were thrown upon the victim to be confirmed along with it. If the offerings were of the ears of new corn, they were parched at the fire, rubbed in the hand, and then offered to the prieſt in a veſſel, over which he poured oil, incenſe, wine, and ſalt, and then burnt it upon the altar, having firſt taken as much of it as of right belonged to himſelf.</p><p>The principal ſacriſices among the Hebrews confided of bullocks, ſheep, and goats; but doves and turtles were accepted from thoſe who were not able to bring the other: theſe beaſts were to be perfect, and without blemiſh. The rites of ſacrificing were various; all of which are very minutely deſcribed in the books of Moſes.</p><p>The manner of ſacrificing among the Greeks aud Romans was as follows. In the choice of the victim, they took care that it was without blemiſh or imperfection; its tail was not to be too ſmall at the end; the tongue not black, nor the ears cleft; and that the bull was one that had never been yoked. The victim being pitched upon, they gilt his forehead and horns, eſpecially if a bull, heifer, or cow. The head they alſo adorned with a garland of flowers, a woollen infula or holy fillet, whence hung two rows of chaplets with twiſted ribands; and on the middle of the body a kind of ſtole, pretty large, hung down on each fide: the leſſer victims were only adorned with garlands and bundles of flowers, together with white tuſts or wreaths.</p><p>The victims thus prepared were brought before the altar; the leſſer being driven to the place, and the greater led by an halter; when, if they made any ſtruggle, or refuſed to go, the reſiſtance was taken for an ill omen, and the ſacriſice frequently ſet aſide. The victim thus brought was carefully exarhined, to ſee that there was no defect in it; then the prieſt, clad in his ſacerdotal habit, and accompanied with the ſacriſicers and other attendants, and being waſhed and purified ac-<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0600.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0594"/>
cording to the ceremonies preſcribed, turned to the right hand, and went round the altar, ſprinkling it with meal and holy water, and alſo beſprinkling thoſe who were preſent. Then the crier proclaimed with a loud voice, Who is here? To which the people replied, Many and good. The prieſt then having exhorted the people to join with him by ſaying, Let us pray, confeſſed his own unworthineſs, acknowledging that he had been guilty of divers ſins; for which he begged pardon of the gods, hoping that they would be pleaſed to grant his requeſts, accept the oblations offered them, and ſend them all health and happineſs; and to this general form added petitions for ſuch particular favours as were then deſired. Prayers being ended, the prieſt took a cup of wine; and having taſted it himſelf, cauſed his aſſiſtants to do the like; and then poured forth the remainder between the horns of the victim. Then the prieſt or the crier, or ſometimes the moſt honourable perſon in the company, killed the beaſt, by knocking it down or cutting its throat. If the ſacriſice was in honour of the celeſtial gods, the throat was turned up towards heaven, but if they ſacrificed to the heroes or infernal gods, the victim was killed with its throat towards the ground. If by accident the beaſt eſcaped the ſtroke, leaped up after it, or expired with pain and difficulty, it was thought to be unacceptable to the gods. The beaſt being killed, the prieſt inſpected its entrails, and made predictions from them. They then poured wine, together with frankincenſe, into the fire, to increaſe the flame, and then laid the ſacriſice on the altar; which in the primitive times was burnt whole to the gods, and thence called an <hi rend="italic">holocauſt;</hi> but in after-times, only part of the victim was conſumed in the fire, and the remainder reſerved for the ſacrificers; the thighs, and ſometimes the entrails, being burnt to their honour, the company feaſted upon the reſt. During the ſacriſice, the prieſt, and the perſon who gave the ſacriſice, jointly prayed, laying their hand upon the altar. Sometimes they played upon muſical inſtruments in the time of the ſacriſice, and on ſome occaſions they danced round the altar, ſinging ſacred hymns in honour of the god.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Human SACRIFICES,</hi> an abominable practice, about the origin of which different opinions have been formed. — The true account ſeems to be that which we have given in the preceding article. When men had gone ſo far as to indulge the fancy of bribing their gods by ſacriſice, it was natural for them to think of enhancing the value of ſo cheap an <hi rend="italic">atonement</hi> by the coſt and rarity of the offering; and, oppreſſed with their malady, they never reſted till they had got to that which they conceived to be the moſt precious of all, a human ſacrifice. “It was cuſtomary (ſays Sanchoniathon<note anchored="true" n="5" place="margin" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">†</hi> Apud Eu ſeb. Praep. Evang. <hi rend="italic">lib 4.</hi></p></note> †), in ancient times, in great and public calamities, before things became incurable, ſor princes and magiſtrates to offer up in ſacriſice to the avenging daemons the deareſt of their offspring, ” Sanchoniathon wrote of Phoenicia, but the practice prevailed in every nation under heaven of which we have received any ancient account. The Egyptians had it in the early part of their monarchy. The Cretans likewiſe had it, and retained it for a longer time. — The nations of Arabia did the ſame. The people of Dumah, in particular, ſacrificed every year a child, and buried it underneath an altar, which they made uſe of inſtead of an idol for they did not admit of images.</p><p>The Perſians buried people alive. Ameſtris, the wife of Xerxes, entombed 12 perſons quick under ground for the good of her ſoul. It would be endleſs to enumerate every city, or every province, where theſe dire practices obtained. The Cyprians, the Rhodians, the Phoceans the Ionians, thoſe of Chios, Leſhos, Tenedos, all had human ſacrifices. The natives of the Tauric Cherſoneſus offered up to Diana every ſtranger whom chance threw upon their coaſt. Hence aroſe that juſt expoſtulation in Euripides upon the inconſiſtency of the proceeding; wherein much good reaſoning is implied. Iphigenia wonders, as the goddeſs delighted in the blood of men, that every villain and murderer ſhould be privileged to eſcape, nay, be driven from the threſhold of the temple; whereas, if an honeſt and virtuous man chanced to ſtray thither, he only was ſeized upon, and put to death. The Pelaſgi, in a time of ſcarcity, vowed the tenth of all that ſhould be born to them for a ſacriſice, in order to procure plenty. Ariſtomenes the Meſſenian flew 300 noble Lacedemonians, among whom was Theopompus the king of Sparta, at the altar of Jupiter at Ithome. Without doubt the Lacedemonians did not fail to make ample returns; for they were a ſevere and revengeful people, and offered the like victims to Mars. Their feſtival of the Diamaſtigoſis is well known; when the Spartan boys were whipped in the fight of their parents with ſuch ſeverity before the altar of Diana Orthia, that they often expired under the torture. Phylarchus affirms, as he is quoted by Porphyry, that of old every Grecian ſtate made it a rule, before they marched towards an enemy, to ſolicit a bleſſing on their undertakings by human victims.</p><p>The Romans were accuſtomed to the like ſacrifices. They both devoted themſelves to the infernal gods, and conſtrained others to ſubmit to the ſame horrid doom. Hence we read in Titus Livius, that, in the conſulate of Æmilius Paulus and Terentius Varro, two Gauls, a man and a woman, and two in like manner of Greece, were buried alive at Rome in the Ox-market, where was a place under ground, walled round, to receive them; which had before been made uſe of for ſuch cruel purpoſes. He ſays it was a ſacriſice not properly Roman, that is, not originally of Roman inſtitution; yet it was frequently practiſed there, and that too by public authority. Plutarch makes mention of a like inſtance a few years before, in the conſulſhip of Flaminius and Furius. There is reaſon to think, that all the principal captives who graced the triumphs of the Romans, were at the cloſe of that cruel pageantry put to death at the altar of Jupiter Capitolinus. Caius Marius offered up his own daughter for a victim to the Dii Averrunci, to procure ſucceſs in a battle againſt the Cimbri; as we are informed by Dorotheus, quoted by Clemens. It is likewiſe atteſted by Plutarch, who ſays that her name was <hi rend="italic">Calpurnia.</hi> Marius was a man of a ſour and bloody diſpoſition; and had probably heard of ſuch ſacrifices being offered in the enemy’s camp, among whom they were very common, or he might have beheld them exhibited at a diſtance; and therefore murdered what was neareſt, and ſhould have been deareſt to him, to counteract their fearful ſpells, and outdo them in their wicked machinery. Cicero, making mention of this cuſtom being common in Gaul, adds, that it prevailed among that people even at the<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0601.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0595"/>
time he was ſpeaking: from whence we may be led to infer, that it was then diſcontinued among the Romans. And we are told by Pliny, that it had then, and not very long, been diſcouraged. For there was a law enacted, when Lentulus and Craſſus were conſuls, ſo late as the 657th year of Rome, that there ſhould be no more human ſacriſices: for till that time thoſe horrid rites had been celebrated in broad day without any maſk or controul; which, had we not the beſt evidence for the fact, would appear ſcarce credible. And however they may have been diſcontinued for a time, we find that they were again renewed; tho’ they became not ſo public, nor ſo general. For not very long after this, it is reported of Auguſtus Caeſar, when Peruſia ſurrendered in the time of the ſecond triumvirate, that beſides multitudes executed in a mihtary manner, he offered up, upon the Ides of March, 300 choſen perſons, both of the equeſtrian and ſenatorial order, at an altar dedicated to the manes of his uncle Julius. Even at Rome itſelf this cuſtom was revived: and Porphyry aſſures us, that in his time a man was every year ſacrificed at the ſhrine of Jupiter Latialis. Heliogabalus offered the like victims to the Syrian deity which he introduced among the Romans. The ſame is ſaid of Aurelian.</p><p>The Gauls and the Germans were ſo devoted to this ſhocking cuſtom, that no buſineſs of any moment was tranſacted among them without being prefaced with the blood of men. They were offered up to various gods; but particularly to Heſus, Taranis, and Thau- tates. Theſe deities are mentioned by Lucan, where he enumerates the various nations who followed the fortunes of Caeſar.</p><p>The altars of theſe gods were far removed from the common reſort of men; being generally ſituated in the depth of woods, that the gloom might add to the horror of the operation, and give a reverence to the place and proceeding. The perſons devoted were led thither by the Druids, who preſided at the ſolemnity, and performed the cruel offices of the ſacriſice. Tacitus takes notice of the cruelty of the Hermunduri, in a war with the Catti, wherein they had greatly the advantage; at the cloſe of which they made one general ſacriſice of all that was taken in battle. The poor remains of the legions under Varus ſuffered in ſome degree the ſame fate. There were many places deſtined for this purpoſe all over Gaul and Germany; but eſpecially in the mighty woods of Arduenna, and the great Hercynian foreſt; a wild that extended above 30 days journey in length. The places fit apart for this ſolemnity were held in the utmoſt reverence, and only approached at particular ſeaſons. Lucan mentions a grove of this fort near Maſſilia, which even the Roman ſoldiers were afraid to violate, though commanded by Cæſar. It was one of thoſe ſet apart for the ſacriſices of the country.</p><p>Claudian compliments Stilicho, that, among other advantages accruing to the (vornan armies through his conduct, they could now venture into the awful foreſt of Hercynia, and follow the chace in thoſe ſo much dreaded woods, and otherwiſe make uſe of them.</p><p>Theſe practices prevailed among all the people of the north, of whatever denomination. The Maſſagetae, the Scythians, the Getes, the Sarmatians, all the various nations upon the Baltic, particularly the</p><p>Suevi and Scandinavians, held it as a fixed principle, that their happineſls and ſecurity could not be obtained but at the expence of the lives of others. Their chief gods were Thor and Woden, whom they thought they could never ſufficieutly glut with blood. They had many very celebrated places of worſhip; eſpecially in the iſland Rugen, near the mouth of the Oder; and in Zeeland: ſome, too, very famous among the Semnones and Naharvalli. But the moſt reverenced of all, and the moſt frequented, was at Upſal; where there was every year a grand celebrity, which continued for nine days During this term they ſacrificed animals of all ſorts: but the moſt acceptable victims, and the moſt numerous, were men. Of theſe ſacriſices none were eſteemed ſo auſpicious and ſalutary as a ſacriſice of the prince of the country. When the lot fell for the king to die, it was received with univerſal acclamations and every expreſſion of joy; as it once happened in the time of a famine, when they call lots, and it fell to king Domalder to be the people’s victim: and he was accordingly put to death. Olaus Tretelger, another prince, was burnt alive to Woden. They did not ſpare their own children. Harald the ſon of Gunild, the firſt of that name, flew two of his children to obtain a ſtorm of wind. “He did not let (fays Verſtegan) to ſacriſice two of his ions unto his idols, to the end he might obtain of them ſuch a tempeſt at ſea, as ſhould break and diſperſe the ſhipping of Harald king of Denmark. ” Saxo Grammaticus mentions a like fact. He calls the king Haquin; and ſpeaks of the perſons put to death as two very hopeful young princes. Another king ſlew nine ſons to prolong his own life; in hopes, perhaps, that what they were abridged of would in great meaſure be added to himſelf. Such inſtances, however, occur not often: but the common victims were without end Adam Bremenſis, ſpeaking of the awful grove at Upſal, where theſe horrid rites were celebrated, ſays, that there was not a ſingle tree but what was reverenced, as if it were gifted with ſome portion of divinity: and all this becauſe they were ſtained with gore and foul with human putrefaction. The ſame is obſerved by Scheiffer in his account of this place.</p><p>The manner in which the victims were ſlaughtered, was diverſe in different places. Some of the Gauliſh nations chined them with a ſtroke of an ax. The Celtae placed the man who was to be offered for a ſacrifice upon a block, or an altar, with his breaſt upwards, and with a ſword ſtruck him forcibly acroſs the ſternum; then tumbling him to the ground, from his agonies and convulſions, as well as from the effuſion of blood, they formed a judgment of future events. The Cimbri ripped open the bowels; and from them they pretended to divine. In Norway they beat mens brains out with an ox-yoke. The ſame operation was performed in Iceland, by daſhing them againſt an altar of ſtone. In many places they transfixed them with arrows. After they were dead, they ſuſpended them upon the trees, and left them to putrefy. One of the writers above quoted mentions, that in his time 70 car-cafes of this fort were found in a wood of the Scevi. Dithmar of Merſhurgh, an author of nearly the ſame age, ſpeaks of a place called <hi rend="italic">Ledur</hi> in Zeeland, where there were every year 99 perſons ſacrificed to the god Swantowite. During theſe bloody festivals a general<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0602.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0596"/>
joy prevailed, and banquets were moſt royally ſerved. They fed, carouſed, and gave a looſe to indulgence, which at other times was not permitted. They imagined that there was ſomething myſterious in the number nine; for which reaſon theſe feaſts were in ſome places celebrated every ninth year, in others every ninth month; and continued for nine days. When all was ended, they waſhed the image of the deity in a pool; and then diſmiſſed the aſſembly. Their ſervants were numerous, who attended during the term of their feaſting, and partook of the banquet. At the cloſe of all, they were ſmothered in the fame pool, or other- wiſe made away with. On which Tacitus remarks, how great an awe this circumſtance muſt neceſſarily infuſe into thoſe who were not admitted to theſe myſteries.</p><p>Theſe accounts are handed down from a variety of authors in different ages; many of whom were natives of the countries which they deſcribe, and to which they ſeem ſtrongly attached. They would not therefore have brought ſo foul an imputation on the part of the world in favour of which they were each writing, nor could there be that concurrence of teſtimony, were not the hiſtory in general true.</p><p>The like cuſtom prevailed to a great degree at Mexico, and even under the mild government of the Peruvians; and in moſt parts of America. In Africa it is ſtill kept up; where, in the inland parts, they ſacriſice ſome of the captives taken in war to their fetiches, in order to ſecure their favour. Snelgrave was in the king of Dahoome's camp, after his inroad into the countries of Ardra and Whidaw; and ſays, that he was a witneſs to the cruelty of this prince, whom he ſaw ſacriſice multitudes to the deity of his nation.</p><p>The ſame abominable worſhip is likewiſe practiſed occaſionally in the iſlands viſited by Captain Cook, and other circumnavigators, in the South Sea. It ſeems indeed to have prevailed in every country at one period of the progreſs of civilization, and undoubtedly had the origin which we have aſſigned to it.</p><p>The ſacriſices of which we have been treating, if we except ſome few inſtances, conſiſted of perſons doomed by the chance of war, or aſſigned by lot, to be offered. But among the nations of Canaan, the victims were peculiarly choſen. Their own children, and whatever was neareſt and deareſt to them, were deemed the moſt worthy offering to their god. The Carthaginians, who were a colony from Tyre, carried with them the religion of their mother-country, and inſtituted the ſame worſhip in the parts where they fettled. It conſiſted in the adoration of ſeveral deities, but particularly of Kronus; to whom they offered human ſacriſices, and eſpecially the blood of children. If the parents were not at hand to make an immediate offer, the magiſtrates did not fail to make choice of what was moſt fair and promiſing, that the god might not be defrauded of his dues. Upon a check being received in Sicily, and ſome other alarming circumſtances happening, Hamilcar without any heſitation laid hold of a boy, and offered him on the ſpot to Kronus; and at the ſame time drowned a number of prieſts, to appeaſe the deity of the ſea. The Carthaginians another time, upon a great defeat of their army by Agathocles, imputed their miſcarriages to the anger of this god, whoſe ſervices had been neglected. Touched with this, and ſeeing the</p><p>enemy at their gates, they ſeized at once 300 children of the prime nobihty, and offered them in public for a ſacriſice. Three hundred more, being perſons who were ſomehow obnoxious, yielded themſelves voluntarily, and were put to death with the others. The neglect of which they accuſed themſelves, conſiſted in ſacriſicing children purchaſed of parents among the poorer ſort, who reared them for that purpoſe, and not ſelecting the moſt promiſing, and the moſt honourable, as had been the cuſtom of old. In ſhort, there were particular children brought up for the altar, as ſheep are fattened for the ſhambles; and they were bought and butchered in the ſame manner. But this indiſcriminate way of proceeding was thought to have given offence. It is remarkable, that the Egyptians looked out for the moſt ſpecious and handſome perſon to be ſacrificed. The Albanians pitched upon the belt man of the community, and made him pay for the wickedneſs of the reſt. The Carthaginians choſe what they thought the moſt excellent, and at the ſame time the moſt dear to them; which made the lot fall heavy upon their children. This is taken notice of by Silius Italicus in his fourth book.</p><p>Kronus, to whom theſe ſacriſices were exhibited, was an oriental deity, the god of light and fire; and therefore always worſhipped with ſome reference to that element. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Phoenicia.</hi></p><p>The Greeks, we find, called the deity to whom theſe offerings were made <hi rend="italic">Agraulos;</hi> and feigned that ſhe was a woman, and the daughter of Cecrops. But how came Cecrops to have any connection with Cyprus? Agraulos is a corruption and tranſpoſition of the original name, which ſhould have been rendered <hi rend="italic">Uk El Aur,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Uk El Aurus;</hi> but has, like many other oriental titles and names, been ſtrangely ſophiſticated, and is here changed to Agraulos. It was in reality the god of light, who was always worſhipped with fire. This deity was the Moloch of the Tyrians and Canaanites, and the Melech of the eaſt; that is, the great and principal god, the god of light, of whom fire was eſteemed a ſymbol; and at whoſe ſhrine, inſtead of viler victims, they offered the blood of men.</p><p>Such was the Kronus of the Greeks, and the Moloch of the Phoenicians: and nothing can appear more ſhocking than the ſacriſices of the Tyrians and Carthaginians, which they performed to this idol. In all emergencies of ſtate, and times of general calamity, they devoted what was moſt neceſſary and valuable to them for an offering to the gods, and particularly to Moloch. But beſides theſe undetermined times of bloodſhed, they had particular and preſcribed ſeaſons every year, when children were choſen out of the moſt noble and reputable families, as before mentioned. If a perſon had an only child, it was the more liable to be put to death, as being eſteemed more acceptable to the deity, and more efficacious for the general good. Thoſe who were ſacriſiced to Kronus were thrown into the arms of a molten idol, which ſtood in the midſt of a large fire, and was red with heat. The arms of it were ſtretched out, with the hands turned upwards, as it were to receive them; yet ſloping downwards, ſo that they dropt from thence into a glowing furnace below. To other gods they were otherwiſe ſlaughtered, and, as it is implied, by the very hands of their parents. What can be more<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0603.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0597"/>
horrid to the imagination, than to ſuppoſe a father leading the deareſt of all his ſons to ſuch an infernal ſhrine? or a mother the moſt engaging and affectionate of her daughters, juſt riſing to maturity, to be ſlaughtered at the altar of Aſhtaroth or Baal? Juſtin deſcribes this unnatural cuſtom very pathetically: <hi rend="italic">Guippe homines, ut victimas, immolabant: et impuberes (que aetas hοſtium miſericordiam provocat) aris admovebant; pacem ſanguine eorum expoſcentes, pro quorum vita Dii rogari maxime ſοleηt.</hi> Such was their blind zeal, that this was continually practiſed; and ſo much of natural affection ſtill left unextinguiſhed, as to render the ſcene ten times more ſhocking from the tenderneſs which they ſeemed to expreſs. They embraced their children with great fondneſs, and encouraged them in the gentleſt terms, that they might not be appalled at the fight of the helliſh proceſs; begging of them to ſubmit with cheerfulneſs to this fearful operation. If there was any appearance of a tear riſing, or a cry unawares eſcaping, the mother ſmothered it with her kiſſes, that there might not be any ſhow of backwardneſs or conſtraint, but the whole be a freewill offering. Theſe cruel endearments over, they ſtabbed them to the heart, or otherwiſe opened the ſluices of life; and with the blood warm, as it ran, beſmeared the altar and the grim viſage of the idol. Theſe were the cuſtoms which the Iſraelites learned of the people of Canaan, and for which they are upbraided by the Pſalmiſt: “They did not deſtroy the nations, concerning whom the Lord commanded them; but were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works: yea, they ſacrificed their ſons and their daughters unto devils, and ſhed innocent blood, even the blood of their ſons and of their daughters, whom they ſacriſiced unto the idols of Canaan; and the land was polluted with blood. Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a-whoring with their own inventions. ”</p><p>Theſe cruel rites, practiſed in ſo many nations, made Plutarch debate with himſelf, “Whether it would not have been better for the Galatae, or for the Scythians, to have had no tradition or conception of any ſuperior beings, than to have formed to themſelves notions of gods who delighted in the blood of men; of gods, who eſteemed human victims the moſt acceptable and perfect ſacrifice? Would it not (ſays he) have been more eligible for the Carthaginians to have had the atheiſt Critias, or Diagoras, their lawgiver, at the commencement of their polity, and to have been taught, that there was neither god nor demon, than to have ſacrificed, in the manner they were wont, to the god which they adored? Wherein they acted, not as the perſon did whom Empedocles deſcribes in ſome poetry, where he expoſes this unnatural cuſtom. The fire there with many idle vows offers up unwittingly his ſon for a ſacrifice; but the youth was ſo changed in feature and figure, that his father did not know him. Theſe people uſed, knowingly and wilfully, to go through this bloody work, and daughter their own offspring. Even they who were childleſa would not be exempted from this curſed tribute; but purchaſed children, at a price, of the poorer fort, and put them to death with as little remorſe as one would kill a lamb or a chicken. The mother, who ſacrificed her child, flood by, without any ſeeming ſenſe of what ſhe was lofing, and without uttering a groan. If a ſigh did</p><p>by chance eſcape, ſhe left all the honour which ſhe propoſed to herſelf in the offering, and the child was notwithſtanding ſlain. All the time of this ceremony, while the children were murdering, there was a noiſe of clarions and tabors founding before the idol, that the cries and ſhrieks of the victims might not be heard. “Fell me now (ſays Plutarch) if the monſters of old, the Typhons, and the giants, were to expel the gods, and to rule the world in their ſtead; could they require a ſervice more horrid than theſe infernal rites and ſacrifices? ”</p></div></body></text></TEI>
