The French law is in force in Mauritius, and has been reproduced in substance in the Civil Codes of Quebec&nbsp;(arts. 2005 et seq.) and St Lucia (arts. 1888 et seq.).

<p><span class="font2">RENTON, a manufacturing town of Dumbartonshire, Scotland. Pop. (1901) 5067. It is situated on the Leven, 2 m. N.N.W.&nbsp;of Dumbarton by the North British and Caledonian railways.&nbsp;The leading industry is Turkey red dyeing, and calico-printing&nbsp;and bleaching are also carried on.. A parish church stands on&nbsp;the site of Dalquhurn House, the birthplace of Tobias Smollett&nbsp;the novelist, to whose memory a. Tuscan column was erected&nbsp;in 1774, the inscription for which was revised by Dr Johnson&nbsp;when he visited Bonhill in that year with Boswell. The town&nbsp;was founded in Î782 by Mrs Smollett—previously Mrs Telfer—&nbsp;of BonhiIl (sister of Tobias Smollett), who resumed her maiden&nbsp;name when she succeeded to the Smollett estates; it was named&nbsp;after Cecilia Renton, daughter of John Renton of Blackadder,&nbsp;who had married Mrs Smollett’s son, Alexander Telfer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RENWICK, JAMES (1662-1688), Scottish covenanting leader, was bom at Moniaive in Dumfriesshire on the 15th of February&nbsp;1662, being the son of a weaver, Andrew Renwick. Educated at&nbsp;Edinburgh University, he joined the section of the Covenanters&nbsp;known as the Cameronians about 1681 and soon became prominent among them. Afterwards he studied theology at the&nbsp;university of Groningen and was ordained a minister in 1683.&nbsp;Returning to Scotland “ full of zeal and breathing forth threats&nbsp;of organized assassination,” says Mr Andrew Lang, he became&nbsp;one'of the field-preachers and was declared a rebel by the&nbsp;privy council. He was largely responsible for the “ apologetical&nbsp;declaration ” of 1684 by which he and his followers disowned&nbsp;the authority of Charles II.; the privy council replied by&nbsp;ordering every one to abjure this declaration on pain of death.&nbsp;Unlike some of his associates, Renwick refused to join the&nbsp;rising under the earl of Argyll in 1685; in 1687, when the&nbsp;declarations of indulgence allowed some liberty of worship to&nbsp;the Presbyterians, he and his followers, often called Renwickites,&nbsp;continued to hold meetings in the fields, which were still illegal.&nbsp;A reward was offered for his capture, and early in 1688 he was&nbsp;seized in Edinburgh. Tried and found guilty of disowning&nbsp;the royal authority and other offences, he refused to apply for&nbsp;a pardon and was hanged on the 17th of February 1688. Renwick was the last of the convenanting martyrs.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">REPIN, ILJA JEFIMOVICH (1844- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;), Russian painter,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">was born in 1844 at Tschuguev in the department of Charkov, the son of parents in straitened circumstances. He learned&nbsp;the rudiments of art under a painter of saints named Bunakov,&nbsp;for three years gaining his living at this humble craft. In 1863&nbsp;he obtained a studentship at the Academy of Fine Arts of St&nbsp;Petersburg, where he remained for six years, winning the gold&nbsp;medal and a travelling scholarship which enabled him to visit&nbsp;France and Italy. He returned to Russia after a short absence,&nbsp;and devoted himself exclusively to subjects having strong&nbsp;nationaI characteristics. In 1894 he became professor of&nbsp;historical painting at the St Petersburg Academy. Repin’s&nbsp;paintings are powerfully drawn, with not a little imagination&nbsp;and with strong dramatic force and characterization. A&nbsp;brilliant colourist, and a port rail-painter of the first rank, he&nbsp;also became known as a sculptor and etcher of ability. His&nbsp;chief pictures are “ Procession in the Government of Kiev,”&nbsp;“ Home-coming,” “ The Arrest,” “ Ivan the Terrible’s murder&nbsp;of his Son,” and, best known of all, “ The Reply of the Cossacks&nbsp;to Sultan Mahmoud IV.” The portraits of the Baroness V. I.&nbsp;Ülskül, of Anton Rubinstein and of Count Leo Tolstoy are&nbsp;among his best achievements in this class. The Tretiakov&nbsp;gallery at Moscow contains a very large collection of his work.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">REPINGTON (or </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Repyngdon),</span><span class="font2"> PHILIP (d. 1424), English bishop and cardinal, was educated at Oxford and became an&nbsp;Augustinian canon at Leicester before 1382. A man of some&nbsp;learning, he came to the front as a defender of the doctrines&nbsp;taught by John Wycliffe; for this he Was suspended and afterwards excommunicated, but in a short time he was pardoned&nbsp;and restored by Archbishop William Courtenay, and he appears&nbsp;to have completely abandoned his unorthodox opinions. In&nbsp;1394 he was made abbot of St Mary de Pré at Leicester, and&nbsp;after the accession of Henry IV. to the English throne in 1399&nbsp;he became chaplain and confessor to this king, being described&nbsp;as “ clericus Specialissimus domini régis Henrici. ” In 1404 he&nbsp;was chosen bishop of Lincoln, and in 1408 Pope Gregory XII.&nbsp;made him a cardinal. He resigned his bishopric in 1419. Some&nbsp;of Repington’s sermons are in manuscript at Oxford and at&nbsp;Cambridge.</span></p>

The jurisdiction in the first case is in the&nbsp;County Court; in the second case the Supreme Court has also&nbsp;jurisdiction in certain circumstances. The proceedings are now&nbsp;regulated by the County Courts Act 1888.
