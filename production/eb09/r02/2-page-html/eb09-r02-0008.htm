<p><span class="font1">number, size, or shape with the epidermal shields which (save in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Trionyx</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sphargis)</span><span class="font1"> cover them. Their condition in&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sphargis</span><span class="font1"> is quite peculiar. In the skin of its back there are&nbsp;imbedded a great number of small plates flexibly united in&nbsp;a mosaic-like pattern. Seven longitudinal rows of these&nbsp;plates (one median, six lateral) differ from the rest by their&nbsp;large size and raised surfaces. On the ventral surface of&nbsp;the body there is one large thin median [)late—the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">epister-mini,</span><span class="font1"> together with other very slender ossifications forming&nbsp;a very imperfect bony framework. All these latter bony&nbsp;plates, however, are very imperfectly ossified, with numerous&nbsp;vacuities. In the Land Tortoises and Terrapins, on the&nbsp;other hand, we have the exoskeleton in its greatest perfec-tion. On the back there is a series of ten median plates,&nbsp;the first one of which is called nuchal and the last one&nbsp;pygal. On each side of these series and suturally connected&nbsp;therewith is a series of large lateral plates also suturally&nbsp;united together and with the median plates. Finally, a&nbsp;series of marginal plates suturally connected together and&nbsp;with the foregoing complete a bony investment of the back&nbsp;which is complete and continuous, and which is known as&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">carapace.</span><span class="font1"> On the ventral surface of the body nine&nbsp;other bony plates form another continuous shield termed&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">plastron.</span><span class="font1"> The most anterior pair correspond with the&nbsp;bones known as clavicles in Man and many other animals.&nbsp;The azygous plate between and behind them answers to the&nbsp;episternum of many animals. The carapace and plastron&nbsp;are united at the sides of the body, but are separated&nbsp;medianly in front and behind to allow the protrusion and&nbsp;retraction of the head and the four limbs and tail. In&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chelonia</span><span class="font1"> similar plates exist, but they are less developed,&nbsp;and merely form an imperfect species of investment, with&nbsp;many vacuities between the plates. The same is the&nbsp;case in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Trionyx,</span><span class="font1"> wherein the marginal plates are also&nbsp;wanting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The skin of the neck and limbs is covered with scales. The skin of the neck may develop fimbriated processes and&nbsp;caruncles, as in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chelys,</span><span class="font1"> and the nose may be produced into&nbsp;a short proboscis, as in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Trionyx.</span><span class="font1"> True claws may be&nbsp;absent, as in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sphargis,</span><span class="font1"> or there may be but one on each foot,&nbsp;as in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chelone,</span><span class="font1"> or two, as in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Caretta,</span><span class="font1"> or three, as in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Trionyx,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">or four or five, as in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Testudo</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Emys.</span><span class="font1"> The claws may&nbsp;approximate in form to hoofs in some of the large Land&nbsp;Tortoises. There may be a web between the digits, as in&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Emys,</span><span class="font1"> or the whole extremity may be united into a solid&nbsp;paddle, as in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chelone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In all cases the skin of the jaws is found thickened and condensed so as to form a horny beak with a cutting</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">edge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In many Chelonians there are two pairs of glands on each side just in front of the junction of the plastron&nbsp;and carapace, while in the Mud Tortoises, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Trionyx,</span><span class="font1"> there&nbsp;is yet another gland on each side in front of the margin&nbsp;of the plastron.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Internal Skeleton.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The endoskeleton of Reptiles, as of most Vertebrate animals, consists of parts which are divisible into two&nbsp;categories :—(a) those which form the skeleton of the&nbsp;head and trunk, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font1"> the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">axial</span><span class="font1"> skeleton ; (6) the parts&nbsp;which form the skeleton of the limbs, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font1"> the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">appendi-cular</span><span class="font1"> skeleton.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Axial Skeleton.—In describing the axial skeleton it will be well to begin with that part of it which belongs&nbsp;to the trunk, leaving the more complex skeleton of the head,&nbsp;f.e., the skull, for subsequent consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Skeleton of the Trunk.—</span><span class="font1">The backbone, spinal column, or spine consists in all adult Reptiles of a series of ossi-fied vertebrae, many, almost all, of which are separate&nbsp;and not anchylosed one to another. Nevertheless the&nbsp;spinal or vertebral column varies in its structure much&nbsp;more in the class of Reptiles than even in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mamma,&nbsp;lia,</span><span class="font1"> and very much more than in the class of Birds, with&nbsp;which the Reptiles are so much allied. This variation&nbsp;consists in differences not only as regards the number of&nbsp;regions or vertebral categories and the extent and struc-ture of each region, but also as regards the form of the&nbsp;individual vertebræ and notably the form of the vertebral&nbsp;centra.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There may or may not be distinct cervical vertebræ with or without movable ribs. The first two vertebræ are&nbsp;differentiated as axis and atlas, and in front of the latter&nbsp;there may be a rudiment of another vertebra, which has&nbsp;been distinguished as the proatlas.@@<sup>1</sup> There are always&nbsp;dorsal vertebræ, some of the ribs of which may not, but&nbsp;more generally do, join a sternum. These dorsal ribs are&nbsp;generally movable, and may be, as in Serpents, organs of&nbsp;locomotion. They may, on the contrary, be firmly fixed&nbsp;by suture one to another as in Chelonians. There may&nbsp;or may not be lumbar vertebræ, and two or more (in some&nbsp;extinct forms many) vertebræ may unite to form a sacrum.&nbsp;There are always caudal vertebræ, and these generally&nbsp;have chevron bones beneath them. Sometimes vertebræ&nbsp;which are not sacral become anchylosed together, as in the&nbsp;dorsal vertebræ of Chelonians. Articular processes always&nbsp;connect together adjacent vertebræ which are not thus&nbsp;anchylosed, and there may be accessory articular processes&nbsp;peculiar to the class, and which will be shortly described&nbsp;later. As to the form of the vertebral centra, they may bo&nbsp;flat in front and behind, or biconcave (amphicœlous), or&nbsp;biconvex, or with a ball behind and a cup in front (pro-cœlous), or with a ball in front and a cup behind (opistho-cœlous).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Crocodilia</span><span class="font1"> all the above-mentioned regions are distinct, there being usually 9 cervical, 11 to 12 dorsal, 2&nbsp;to 3 sacral, and about 40 caudal vertebræ. In existing&nbsp;species all the vertebræ are procœlous except the atlas,&nbsp;axis, sacral, and first caudal vertebræ. The adjacent sur-faces of the centra of the sacral vertebræ are flat, and the&nbsp;centrum of the first caudal is biconvex. The atlas consists&nbsp;of five pieces,@@<sup>2</sup> and the odontoid bone is not anchylosed&nbsp;to the axis. The caudal vertebræ are elongated and com-pressed, and, except the most anterior and posterior, support&nbsp;chevron bones. Ribs are very generally present. Those&nbsp;attached to the atlas and axis are single in origin. Each&nbsp;rib of the other cervical vertebræ bifurcates at its upper end&nbsp;into a tubercular and a capitular process, which respec-tively articulate with the neural arch and centrum of&nbsp;their supporting vertebra, and the interval thus left in the&nbsp;succeeding vertebræ forms a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">canalis centralis.</span><span class="font1"> The ribs of&nbsp;the middle five cervical vertebræ so expand distally as to&nbsp;impede the lateral flexion of the neck. The neural arches&nbsp;articulate by suture with the vertebral bodies. The dorsal&nbsp;ribs become attached to processes which pass out from&nbsp;each vertebra to the tubercular and capitular processes of&nbsp;the ribs respectively, and their situation with respect to&nbsp;the neuro-central suture changes by degrees, through the&nbsp;vertebral series, till in the twelfth dorsal one long trans-verse process, passing out above the neural central suture,&nbsp;supports both processes. Thence backwards these arti-culating surfaces approximate till at last there is but a&nbsp;single articular surface between each rib and its sup-porting vertebra, as was the case in those of the atlas and&nbsp;axis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The dorsal ribs consist of two pieces—the distal piece remaining cartilaginous ; and most ribs support an imper-fectly ossified </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">processus uncinatus,</span><span class="font1"> nearly as in Birds, which&nbsp;extends backwards from the distal portion of its ossified</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@1</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discovered by Prof. Paul Albrecht.</span></p>
