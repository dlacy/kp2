                    >a</hi> sketch of the history of Scotland as is alone suited to this work, we
                should enter into the great controversy concerning the origin of the Scottish
                people, a subject upon which much needless acrimony, and many unprofitable volumes,
                have been thrown away.@@<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> It will be more suitable to
                mark the progress of the great events in our national history, and to pass over its
                minor features ; to fix the attention upon results rather than to perplex it with
                details ; to establish a series of points by which an intelligent reader may guide
                his memory and direct his studies ; and occasionally to note those authors from
                whose pages he may fill up the picture.</p>
            <p>It is well known, that our first authentic knowledge of Britain comes from Julius
                Cæsar. Fifty-five years before the Christian era, this extraordinary man invaded the
                island from Gaul ; but his operations were attended with little success, his stay
                was brief, and it is certain that he knew nothing of Scotland. It was not till
                nearly a century and a half after Caesar’s descent, and during the reign of the
                emperor Vespasian, that Julius Agricola, at the head of a Roman army, penetrated
                into the northern parts of Britain. The details of his various campaigns, the
                resistance which he encountered, and the vestiges of his progress which yet remain,
                have furnished matter of laborious investigation to our antiquaries. Among their
                conflicting accounts, it seems certain that he first pushed his conquests as far as
                the Friths of Forth and Clyde ; that in succeeding campaigns he penetrated
                northwards ; and that in his last great expedition, during which his army was
                accompanied by a numerous fleet, which sailed along the coast, he was opposed by a
                barbarian chief named Galgacus. A sanguinary battle was fought between this leader
                and Agricola, the exact site of which has been keenly disputed. There seems to be
                little doubt, however, that previously to its occurrence the Roman general hail
                passed the Frith of Tay, and that although victorious over the fierce and
                undisciplined multitudes which opposed him, he experienced a check which compelled
                him to desist from any further aggression. Two great events marked the last years of
                the government of Agricola. He explored the northern coasts of Scotland by his fleet
                ; and to him the Roman world, in all probability, owed its first certain knowledge
                that Britain was an island. He endeavoured, in the second place, to secure his
                conquests from future attack by a chain of forts connecting the Friths of Forth and
                Clyde. Having completed these defences, he was recalled by the jealousy of Domitian,
                and left Britain in the year 85.</p>
            <p>From this time till the reign of Hadrian, a period of thirty- six years, we hear
                little of the Romans, either in southern or northern Britain. Early in the second
                century, <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.D.</hi> 121), this emperor in person made an
                expedition into Scotland ;</p>
            <p>and about twenty years later, Lollius Urbicus, the Roman governor under the emperor
                Antoninus, distinguished himself by the courage and ability which he displayed
                against the turbident and warlike tribes which inhabited the northern parts of the
                island. Two facts, however, are admitted by the Roman writers, which demonstrate how
                uncertain was the tenure by which these masters of the world held their northern
                possessions in Britain. The emperor Hadrian, apparently distrusting the sufficiency
                of the line of forts already formed by Agricola, constructed a wall or fortified
                rampart from the Tyne to the Solway. It has been supposed by some antiquaries, that
                the emperor entirely abandoned to the barbarians the wide country between this new
                defence and the more ancient <hi rend="italic">Vallum</hi> which united the Friths
                of Forth and Clyde ; but the discovery of a succession of coins along the line of
                this last rampart, belonging to the intermediate emperors, appears to indicate the
                    contrary.@@<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> From the adoption of this measure it is
                however evident, that the courage and successes of the barbarians had given much
                annoyance to the Romans ; and this is corroborated by the second fact to which we
                allude, namely, that between the period of Hadrian’s death and the succession of
                Antoninus Pius, <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.</hi> D. 138), the wall between the Forth
                and Clyde had been so completely destroyed, that Lollius Urbicus entirely
                reconstructed it. This fact is proved by inscriptions, which the reader may consult
                in Horsley’s <hi rend="italic">Britannia Homana.@@</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"
                    >3</hi> During the remaining years of his government, this able officer devoted
                himself to opening up the country by roads ; to the construction of various camps
                and fortalices, of which the site has been traced with much industry and success by
                the latest writer on the subject ; and to the introduction of those useful arts
                which were best calculated to raise and humanize the character of the northern
                barbarians.@@ His administration in Britain appears to have terminated with the death
                of his master, Antoninus Pius, <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> 161.</p>
            <p>From this period till the beginning of the third century, all is dark in Britain. But
                in the year 207, the emperor Severus received intelligence that the Caledonians had
                invaded the Roman provinces ; and with a vigour and alacrity which, considering the
                distance of the seat of war, and the barren prize to be contested, is not easily
                explained, he hastened in person to reduce the insurgent Caledonians. This
                expedition, making every allowance for the exaggeration with which the exploits of
                an emperor were usually recorded, must have been an extraordinary one. In the
                comparatively civilized country which extended between the walls of Hadrian and
                Antoninus, he could meet with little opposition ; but when he left this last line of
                defence, and conducted his army into the wild regions beyond the Frith of Forth,
                ultimately penetrating into Moray, we must suppose him to have encountered very
                formidable obstacles. The savage and uncleare d state of the country, the extent of
                the forests, the unhealthy and</p>

                Scotland, as the best work yet written on this subject. Its arrangement is defective
                ; but its good sense, and the authenticity of the documents upon which its
                deductions are founded, are highly praiseworthy. Pinkerton’s Dissertation on the
                Scythians or Goths, Dr. Jamieson's Dissertation on the Origin of the Scottish
                Language, and the first volume of the laborious work of Chalmers, entitled
                Caledonia, may be consulted with the greatest advantage. In their pages, the
                critical student who may desire to pursue the subject, will find ample references to
                all the noted works upon this question.</p>
