: A genus of the polyandria order, belonging to the monoeciaclaſs of plants; and in the natural method ranking under the fifth order, <hi rend="italic">Tripelatoideae.</hi> The male calyx is triphyllous; the corolla tripetalous; the filaments generally about 14; the female calyx is triphyllous; the corolla tripetalous; many piſtils; and many naked feeds. There are four ſpecies, of which the moſt remarkable is the ſagittiſolia, growing naturally in many parts of England. The root is compoſed of many ſtrong fibres, which ſtrike into the mud; the footſtalks of the leaves are in length proportionable to the depth of the water in which they grow; ſo they are ſometimes almoſt a yard long: they are thick and fungous; the leaves, which float upon the water, are ſhaped like the point of an arrow, the two ears at their baſe ſpreading wide aſunder, and are very ſharp-pointed. The flowers are produced upon long ſtalks which riſe above the leaves, ſtanding in whorls round them at the joints. They conſiſt of three broad white petals, with a cluſter of ſtamina in the middle, which have purple ſummits. There is always a bulb at the lower part of the root, growing in the ſolid earth beneath the mud. This bulb conſtitutes a conſiderable part of the food of the Chineſe; and upon that account they cultivate it. Horſes, goats, and ſwine, eat it; cows are not fond of it.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
