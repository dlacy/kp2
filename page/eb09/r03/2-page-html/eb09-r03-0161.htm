<p><span class="font1">lier fascinations seem to have been too much for the more than middle-aged painter, and they had their own share in aggravating&nbsp;that nervous restlessness and instability, inherent in his nature,&nbsp;which finally ruined both health and mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In 1786 Alderman Boydell started his great scheme of the Shakesiieare Gallery,—it would appear at the suggestion of&nbsp;Romney. The painter at least entered heartily into the plan, and&nbsp;contributed his scene from the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tempest,</span><span class="font1"> and his Infant Shakespeare&nbsp;attended by the Passions, the latter characterized by the Redgraves&nbsp;as one of the best of his subject pictures. Gradually he began to&nbsp;withdraw from portrait-painting, to limit the hours devoted to&nbsp;sitters, and to turn his thoughts to mighty schemes of the ideal&nbsp;subjects which he would execute. Already, in 1792, lie had&nbsp;painted Milton and his Daughters, which was followed by Newton&nbsp;making Experiments with the Prism. He was to paint the Seven&nbsp;Ages, Visions of Adam with the Angel, “ six other subjects from&nbsp;Milton—three where Satan is the hero, and three from Adam and&nbsp;Eve, —perhaps six of each. ” Having planned and erected a large&nbsp;studio in Hampstead, he removed thither in 1797, with the fine&nbsp;collection of casts from the antique which his friend Flaxman had&nbsp;gathered for him in Italy. But his health was now irremediably&nbsp;shattered, and the man was near his end. In the summer of 1799,&nbsp;suffering from great weakness of body and the profoundest depression of mind, he returned to the north, to Kendal, where his&nbsp;deserted but faithful and long-suffering wife received and tended&nbsp;him. He died November 15, 1802.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The art of Romney, and especially his figure subjects, suffered greatly from the λvaywardness and instability of the painter’s disposition, from his want of fixed purpose and sustained energy. He&nbsp;lacked the steadfast perseverance needful to the accomplishment of&nbsp;a great picture. His imagination was no “ constant angel ever by&nbsp;his side” ; it flashed and flickered fitfully upon him, like April sunshine. His fancy would be captivated by a subject, which was&nbsp;presently embodied in a sketch, but the toil of elaborating it into&nbsp;the finished completeness of a painting too frequently overtaxed his&nbsp;powers ; he became embarrassed by technical difficulties which,&nbsp;through defective early training, he was unable to surmount, and&nbsp;the half-covered canvas would be turned to the wall. It is in the&nbsp;best of his portraits that we feel the painter’s true greatness.&nbsp;These, and especially his female portraits, are full of grace, distinction, and sweetness. When we examine his heads of Cowper and&nbsp;Wilkes, his delicate and dignified full length of William Beckford<sub>1&nbsp;</sub>his Parson’s Daughter in the National Gallerj<sup>r</sup>, and his group of&nbsp;the Duchess of Gordon and her Son, we are ready to admit his&nbsp;claim to rank as the third of the great portrait painters of 18th-centurj<sup>r</sup> England.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">ROMNY, a district town of Russia, on the Sula river, 112 miles to the north-west of Poltava, and in the government of that name. It acquired commercial importance&nbsp;during last century, especially on account of its fairs. The&nbsp;chief of these—that in wool—was removed to Poltava in&nbsp;1852, but the prices established by the remaining three&nbsp;still determine to a great extent those at the greater fair&nbsp;of Poltava. Of the local industries, the manufacture of&nbsp;agricultural implements is the only one worthy of mention,&nbsp;but the petty trades, both in town and district, are of&nbsp;considerable importance. The population in 1881 was&nbsp;12,300.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ROMULUS, the mythical eponym founder and first king of Rome, is represented in legend as the son of Mars. His&nbsp;mother, the Vestal Silvia or Ilia, was daughter of Numitor,&nbsp;who had been dispossessed of the throne of Alba by his&nbsp;younger brother Amulius ; Silvia’s twin sons, Romulus and&nbsp;Remus, were placed in a trough and cast into the Tiber&nbsp;by their cruel granduncle. The trough grounded in the&nbsp;marshes where Rome afterwards stood, under the wild fig-tree </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">{ficus ruminalis)</span><span class="font2"> which was still holy in later days.&nbsp;The babes were suckled by a she-wolf and fed by a woodpecker, and then fostered by Acca Laurentia, wife of the&nbsp;shepherd Faustulus. Growing up they became leaders of&nbsp;a warlike band of shepherds on the Palatine, and in course&nbsp;of time were recognized by their grandfather, whom they&nbsp;restored to his throne, slaying the usurper Amulius. They&nbsp;now proposed to found a city on the site where they had been&nbsp;nurtured ; but a quarrel broke out between the brothers, and&nbsp;Lemus was slain. The story goes on to tell how Romulus&nbsp;strengthened his band by receiving outlaws, found wives&nbsp;for them by capture, and waged war with the indignant&nbsp;parents. The most formidable foe was Titus Tatius, king&nbsp;of the Sabines, but after an obstinate struggle he and&nbsp;Romulus united their forces and reigned side by side till&nbsp;Tatius fell in a blood feud with Laurentum. Romulus&nbsp;now reigned alone till he suddenly one day disappeared&nbsp;from earth in darkness and storm, and was thereafter&nbsp;worshipped as a god under the name of Quirinus, which,&nbsp;however, is really a Sabine form of Mars. This legend, best&nbsp;preserved in Livy (book i.), belongs throughout to mythology, not to history. See also Plutarch’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Romultts,</span><span class="font2"> and&nbsp;Dionysius, books i., ii.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">RONDA, a town of Spain, in the province of Malaga, and about 43 miles to the west of that city. It occupies&nbsp;a site of singular picturesqueness on a high rock nearly&nbsp;surrounded by the Guadalvin (afterwards the Guadiaro),&nbsp;which flows through a deep and abrupt chasm (or “ Tajo ”)&nbsp;by which the old town is separated from the new. Of the&nbsp;two bridges the more modern (1761) spans the stream in a&nbsp;single arch at a height of about 255 feet. On the edge of&nbsp;the Tajo is the alameda or public promenade, commanding&nbsp;a wide and beautiful prospect of the fertile valley or vega&nbsp;and the sierra beyond. The old part of the town has a&nbsp;Moorish aspect, with narrow, steep, and crooked lanes,&nbsp;and still retains some Moorish towers and other buildings.&nbsp;The Ronda bull-ring is one of the finest in Spain, and can&nbsp;accommodate 10,000 spectators. Ronda is the seat of a&nbsp;considerable trade in leather, saddlery, and horses, and has&nbsp;an important fair (May 20). The population within the&nbsp;limits of the municipality was 19,181 in 1877.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Some inconsiderable remains of an aqueduct and theatre, about 7 miles to the north of Ronda, are supposed to represent the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Acinipo&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Arunda</span><span class="font1"> of ancient geographers. Ronda was taken from the Moors&nbsp;in 1485. It was the birthplace of Espinel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RONDEAU or </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rondel</span><span class="font2"> (Ital. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rondo).</span><span class="font2"> In poetry the rondeau is a short metrical structure which in its perfect&nbsp;form is divided into three strophes of unequal length, knit&nbsp;together by rapidly recurrent rhymes and a refrain. The&nbsp;laws of the rondeau have varied at different periods, and&nbsp;even with different poets of the same period—varied so&nbsp;fundamentally that some critics have found a generic difference between the “rondeau” and the “rondel” or “ron-det.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rondeau,</span><span class="font2"> however, seems to be merely the modern&nbsp;spelling of the word </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">rondel,</span><span class="font2"> as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">marteau</span><span class="font2"> is the modern spelling of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">martel, chateau</span><span class="font2"> of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">chatel,</span><span class="font2"> &amp;c. When the rondeau&nbsp;was called the rondel it was mostly written in fourteen&nbsp;octosyllabic lines of two rhymes as in the rondels of Charles&nbsp;d’Orleans. In this variability of structure it contrasts&nbsp;with the stability of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sonnet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">{&lt;p.v.).</span><span class="font2"> While the proper&nbsp;sonnet of octave and sestet has always been a structure of&nbsp;fourteen verses (whatever may be the arrangement of the&nbsp;rhymes), the structure under consideration, whether called&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">rondeau</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">rondel</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">rondet,</span><span class="font2"> may, it seems, consist of any&nbsp;number of verses from eight to thirteen. But when we&nbsp;find that the kind of triolet used by Froissart is a “ rondel”&nbsp;we are compelled to admit that the names given to this&nbsp;form are very elastic. In Clement Marofs time, however,&nbsp;the laws of the rondeau became more settled, and, according&nbsp;to Voiture, in the 17th century the approved form of the&nbsp;rondeau was a structure of thirteen verses and a refrain.</span></p>
