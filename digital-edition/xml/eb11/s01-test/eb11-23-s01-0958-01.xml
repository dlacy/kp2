a river of British East Africa which enters the Indian Ocean in 3˚ 12' S., just north of Malinda. The Sabaki rises (as the Athi) in 1˚ 42' S., and after flowing north-east 70 m. across the Kapote and Athi plains, turns south-south-east under the wooded slopes of the Yatta ridge, which shuts in its basin on the east. In 3˚S. it turns east, and in its lower course (known as the Sabaki) traverses the sterile quartz-land of the outer plateau. The valley is in parts low and flat, covered with forest and scrub, and containing small lakes and backwaters connected with the river in the rains. At this season the stream—which rises as much as 30 ft. in places—is deep and strong and of a turbid yellow colour; but navigation is interrupted by the Lugard falls, about 100 m. from its mouth. Its total length is about 400 m. Apart from the numerous small feeders of the upper river, almost the only tributary is the Tsavo, from the east side of Kilimanjaro, which enters in about 3˚ S.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
