<p><span class="font0">at night, the two caps of the night-glasses should be opened. On looking through the instrument, any lamp or other light will&nbsp;appear like a fine, bright line, and the range can be taken in the&nbsp;ordinary way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This range-finder possesses the superlative advantage of the one-man instrument, and it is claimed for it that it can range on&nbsp;horizontal objects, such as the crest of a hill, which has no detail&nbsp;suitable for use with a mekometer, and that it can be adjusted on&nbsp;service with no greater difficulty than the setting of a watch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">3. For harbour defence, owing to the long range of naval guns, and the fast targets which war-vessels present, an accurate&nbsp;range-finder is of first importance. This is largely the case&nbsp;because “ ranging ” cannot be resorted to in the same manner&nbsp;as in the field, where the targets are comparatively motionless&nbsp;and the effective ranges are less. Successful artillery practice&nbsp;therefore depends, in a great measure, upon the range-finder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The instrument used in harbour forts is known as the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">depression </span><span class="font0">range-finder. As its name suggests, it solves a triangle in the&nbsp;vertical plane, of which the base is the height of the instrument&nbsp;above sea-level. Its appearance resembles some forms of theodolite&nbsp;(fig. 6). A framework, capable of rotating in azimuth on a vertical </span></p>
<p><span class="font2">p</span><span class="font0">ivot, is supported on a plate carried by levelling screws, L, L, L.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To the framework are pivoted two arms DC and FE, at C and E respectively. The arm EF is supported at F by a vertical screw H&nbsp;ending in a drum, upon which, in a spiral scale, the ranges are&nbsp;graduated. Motion in altitude is thus given to the telescope. The&nbsp;arm CD is supported by a slider G. This slider is set by a rack and&nbsp;pinion to the height above sea-level (represented on a scale of feet&nbsp;on EF) at which the instrument may be used. A telescope AB is&nbsp;suitably fitted in jaws at the top of the frame. There are spirit-levels at M and Q for adjusting purposes. The telescope is provided&nbsp;with cross wires which can be illuminated for night use. An&nbsp;azimuth circle X and pointer Y enable the direction of any vessel&nbsp;to be indicated, the range of which it is desired to know. The&nbsp;instrument rests on a base plate R, to which it is locked by the&nbsp;top-plate O. The observer directs the cross wires of the telescope&nbsp;upon the water-line of the objective, by means of the drum I and&nbsp;the azimuth handle P, the top of which just appears in the diagram.&nbsp;The reader watches the arrow on the drum and calls out the ranges&nbsp;as the figures arrive beneath it. The ranges are communicated&nbsp;to the officers at the guns by various devices, which differ according&nbsp;to local requirements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Position-Finder.—</span><span class="font1">The range-finding instrument known in the British service as the Position-Finder (invented by Colonel&nbsp;Watkin, C.B., R.A.) is practically a large depression range-finder. It posesses, however, certain additional appliances&nbsp;which render it capable of automatically recording, upon an&nbsp;oriented chart, the position or course of a vessel. And further,&nbsp;by electrical means it automatically records to a distant&nbsp;battery the range and bearing of the desired objective. The&nbsp;position-finder can therefore, from a concealed and safe position,&nbsp;automatically control the fire of a group of guns,&nbsp;whose detachments need not necessarily see the&nbsp;target engaged. As the observer follows the objective with the telescope of the instrument the range&nbsp;and bearing is simultaneously shown in the battery on convenient&nbsp;dials. The distance and direction thus communicated are the&nbsp;range and bearing from the guns, not as measured from the&nbsp;range-finder. The correction due to the displacement between&nbsp;gun and instrument is automatic. In localities where the&nbsp;height does not admit of using the depression system, an&nbsp;alternative arrangement is provided, known as the Horizontal&nbsp;Position-Finder. It is open to the objections common to&nbsp;two-man range-finders, and is only employed where necessity&nbsp;compels its use. Briefly, there are two observing stations at&nbsp;either end of a measured and electrically connected base.&nbsp;One is known as the transmitting and the other the receiving&nbsp;station; the latter contains the principal instrument, which&nbsp;usually is capable of independent use for medium and short&nbsp;ranges as a depression instrument.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It will be seen that the difference between the two systems is, that the first described solves the range triangle in the vertical, and&nbsp;the latter in the horizontal plane. There have been various methods&nbsp;proposed for using the position-finder. The best results are obtained&nbsp;by placing range and bearing dials on the gun-mounting in a position&nbsp;where they can be easily seen by the men elevating and&nbsp;training the gun. The gun is kept directed upon the&nbsp;objective and fired as quickly as it can be loaded. A&nbsp;position-finder can be used for firing mines in a mine field,&nbsp;and instruments are issued to the Royal Navy for this</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the United States of America the term “ position-finder ” is applied to a range-finder which gives direction as well as distance. This is substantially correct, but custom, in the British service, confines the use of the expression&nbsp;as defined above.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">4. Various appliances, not strictly range-finders, are sometimes used to assist in estimating distance. The&nbsp;following examples are not without interest:—</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Acoustic telemeters,</span><span class="font0"> depending upon the velocity of sound, are obviously unsuited to the requirements of&nbsp;modern warfare. The names of Thouvenin, Rédier and&nbsp;Le Boulengé are connected with such instruments—that of&nbsp;the last-named is perhaps the most convenient. It consists of a graduated glass tube filled with liquid, of suitable&nbsp;density, and containing a small metal traveller. At the&nbsp;flash of discharge of a gun or rifle the instrument is brought&nbsp;to a vertical position, and the traveller starts from zero;&nbsp;at the detonation, it is turned to a horizontal position&nbsp;and the traveller stops at the point on the scale indicating</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">the range.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On this principle is the rough method of ascertaining the distance, in yards, </span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font0">a thunderstorm, viz. multiply the number of seconds&nbsp;elapsing between the perception of the lightning and that of the&nbsp;thunder by the number of days in the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Optical</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">perspective telemeters</span><span class="font0"> determine the distance to any point by observing the size of some object of known dimensions,&nbsp;as seen in a graduated telescope. Porro’s telemeter, Elliott’s&nbsp;telescope and Nordenfelt’s macrometer illustrate the principle. The chief defect of the system is that the objects&nbsp;most conveniently observed—men and horses—vary con-siderably in size, so that the assumption of a constant dimension may&nbsp;be productive of error.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On the continent of Europe the perspective telemeter for military purposes has attracted more attention than in England. The&nbsp;French in their precise terminology call such an instrument “ Stadia&nbsp;militaire,” a term which at once distinguishes it from a “ télémètre,”&nbsp;and describes its nature. In rapid military sketching, in locating&nbsp;positions upon maps, &amp;c., perspective telemeters find a use. The&nbsp;telescopes issued to field batteries and to coast forts in France are&nbsp;provided with a scale in the field of view. By comparing this scale&nbsp;with known heights, such as the average height of a man on foot,&nbsp;or the known height of funnels, masts, turrets, &amp;c., of a war-vessel,&nbsp;distance can be estimated with fair accuracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The “ jumelle Souchier,” which can be used as an ordinary field-glass, is constructed on the stadia principle. By its means ranges can be estimated within an accuracy of 10%. A stand or rest,&nbsp;however, is necessary for good results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">General Percin of the French army has shown, in an interesting pamphlet, that a piece of wood or card cut to a known fraction of&nbsp;the distance between the eye and the end of the thumb, when the&nbsp;arm is fully extended, can be used to estimate distances. Thus it is&nbsp;easy to find a penny in good condition of which the thickness is&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>/<sub>400</sub>th part of the arm-length in a man of average height. Provided&nbsp;with such a coin an observer finds its rim to exactly cover a distant&nbsp;man </span><span class="font1">6 </span><span class="font0">ft. (or 2 yds. high). The range therefore is 400×2 =800 yds.&nbsp;Similarly, if the man’s height appeared to be but half the thickness&nbsp;of the coin the range would be 4×400 = </span><span class="font1">1600 </span><span class="font0">yds. With a little&nbsp;practice the eye estimates the proportion between the object of</span></p>
