                <p><label>ROKITANSKY, CARL</label> , <hi rend="smallcaps">Freiherr von</hi>
                    (1804-1878), the founder of the Vienna school of pathological anatomy, was born
                    on the 19th of February 1804 at Koniggratz in Bohemia. He studied medicine at
                    Prague and at Vienna, graduating at the latter place in 1828. Soon afterwards he
                    became assistant to Johann Wagner, the professor of pathological anatomy, and
                    succeeded him in 1834 as prosector, being at the same time made extraordinary
                    professor. It was not until ten years later (1844) that he reached the rank of
                    full professor. To his duties as a teacher he added in 1847 the onerous office
                    of medico-legal anatomist to the city, and from 1863 he filled an influential
                    office in the ministry of education and public worship, wherein he had to advise
                    on all routine matters of medical teaching, I including patronage. A seat in the
                    upper house of the Reichsrath rewarded his public labours in 1867, and on his
                    retirement from all his offices in 1874 he was made a commander of the Order of
                    Leopold. He joined the Imperial Academy of Sciences as a member in 1848, and
                    became its president in 1869. He was president also of the medical society of
                    the Austrian capital and an honorary member of many foreign societies. On his
                    retirement at the age of seventy his colleagues celebrated the occasion by a
                    function in the aula of the university, where his bust was unveiled. In his
                    leave-taking speech he said that work had always been a pleasure to him and
                    pleasures mostly a toil. His death in Vienna on the 23rd of July 1878 elicited
                    many genuine expressions of affection and of esteem for his upright character.
                    Two of his sons became professors at Vienna, one of astronomy and another of
                    medicine, while a third gained distinction on the lyric stage.</p>
               <p>With Rokitansky’s name is associated the second great period of the medical
                    school of Vienna, its first success having been identified with the liberal
                    patronage of it by Maria Theresa and with the fame of Van Swieten, whom the
                    empress had attracted thither from Leiden. The basis of its second reputation
                    was morbid anatomy, together with the precision of clinical diagnosis dependent
                    thereon, and associated with the labours of Rokitansky’s lifelong friend, Joseph
                    Skoda (1805-1881). The anatomical vogue had begun under Wagner while Rokitansky
                    was still a student; but it reached its highest point while the latter was
                    assistant in the dead-house and afterwards prosector and professor. The
                    enthusiasm for the post-mortem study of disease brought one very serious
                    consequence at the outset, in the enormous increase of the death-rate from
                    puerperal fever in the lying-in wards of the general hospital. A comparison
                    between the slight mortality in the wards that were afterwards reserved for the
                    training of midwives and the excessive mortality in those set apart for the.
                    training of students proved that the cause was the conveyance of infection from
                    the dead-house by the hands of the latter. The precautions introduced by I. P.
                    Semmelweiss in 1847 proved adequate in removing that grave reproach from the
                    study of morbid anatomy. Another and more lasting consequence of the assiduous
                    pursuit of post-mortem study, counterbalancing somewhat the advantage of a more
                    precise and localized diagnosis, was the loss of faith in the power of drugs to
                    remedy the textural changes—the so-called “nihilism ” of the Vienna school. The
                    immediate outcome of Rokitansky’s close application to the work of the
                    dead-house was his <hi rend="italic">Handbuch der pathologischen Anatomie</hi>
                    (1842-46), in 3 vols., of which the first was published last. The value of the
                    work lies in the second and third volumes, containing succinct descriptions of
                    the visible changes and abnormalities in the several organs 'and parts of the
                    body. Whenever Rokitansky touched the vital problems of general pathology, as he
                    did in the postponed first volume, he revealed a metaphysical bent, which was
                    strong in him behind all his undoubted powers of outward observation and
                    accurate description. Being a tew years too soon to profit by the microscopic
                    movement which led to the cellular pathology, he endeavoured to reconcile the
                    old humoral doctrine with his anatomical observations, and to read a new meaning
                    into the doctrine of the various dyscrasias. In 1862 he entered into possession
                    of a new pathological institute, in which he found means, for the first time, to
                    display his extensive collection of specimens in a museum. Although he had no
                    direct share in the newer developments of pathology, he was far from indifferent
                    or reactionary towards them; indeed, the laboratories and chairs for microscopic
                    and experimental pathology and for pathological chemistry were warmly encouraged
                    and aided by him.</p>
               <p>Next to his <hi rend="italic">Handbuch,</hi> of which the Sydenham Society
                    published an English translation in 4 vols. (1849-52), his most important
                    writings were four memoirs in the <hi rend="italic">Denkschriften</hi> of the
                    Vienna Academy of Sciences (on the anatomy of goitre, cysts, diseases of
                    arteries, and defects in the septa of the heart), the last as late as 1875.
                    Other papers of less importance brought up the total of his writings to
                    thirty-eight, including three addresses of a philosophical turn, on “ Freedom of
                    Inquiry ” (1862), “The Independent Value of Knowledge ” (1867) and “ The
                    Solidarity of Animal Life ” (1869).</p>
