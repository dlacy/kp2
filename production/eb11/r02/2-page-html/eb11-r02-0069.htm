<p><span class="font0">or some other like title. France was Blefuscu; London was Mildcndo; pounds were sprugs; the duke of Newcastle was&nbsp;the Nardac secretary of state; Lord Hardwicke was the Hurgo&nbsp;Hickrad; and William Pulteney was Wingul Pulnub.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the latter half of the century the newspapers began to report parliamentary debates more fully, with the result that,&nbsp;in 1771, several printers, including those of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Morning Chronicle&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">London Evening Post,</span><span class="font0"> were ordered into custody for&nbsp;publishing debates of the House of Commons. A long and&nbsp;bitter struggle between the House and the public ensued. John&nbsp;Wilkes took part in it. The lord mayor of London and an&nbsp;alderman were sent to the Tower for refusing to recognize the&nbsp;Speaker’s warrant for the arrest of certain printers of parliamentary reports. But the House of Commons was beaten.&nbsp;In 1772 the newspapers published the reports as usual; and&nbsp;their right to do so has never since been really questioned.&nbsp;Both Houses of Parliament, indeed, now show as much anxiety&nbsp;to have their debates fully reported as aforetime they showed&nbsp;resentment at the intrusion of the reporter. Elaborate provision is made in the House of Lords and in the House of Commons&nbsp;for reporters. They have a Press Gallery in which they may&nbsp;take notes, writing rooms in which those notes may be extended,&nbsp;and a special dining-room. Reporting is nowhere carried to&nbsp;such an extent as in the United Kingdom, since in most other&nbsp;countries the newspapers do not find it sufficiently interesting&nbsp;“ copy ” for their readers to justify the amount of space required.&nbsp;Consequently the verbatim reports, though now no longer&nbsp;hindered by law, and made possible by shorthand (which was&nbsp;first employed in the service of parliament in 1802) and by all&nbsp;the arts of communication and reproduction, are considerably&nbsp;restricted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But parliamentary work is only a small part of newspaper reporting. The newspapers in the beginning of the 19th century&nbsp;rarely contained more than the barest outline of any speech or&nbsp;public address delivered in or in the neighbourhood of the towns&nbsp;where they were published. After the peace of 1815 a period&nbsp;of much political fermentation set in, and the newspapers began&nbsp;to report the speeches of public men at greater length. It was&nbsp;not, however, until well into what may be called the railway&nbsp;era that any frequent effort was made by English newspapers&nbsp;to go out of their own district for the work of reporting. The&nbsp;London newspapers had before this led the way. Early in the&nbsp;19th century, greater freedom of access to both Houses was given,&nbsp;and the manager of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Morning Chronicle</span><span class="font0"> established a staff&nbsp;of reporters. Each reporter took his “turn”—that is, he took&nbsp;notes of the proceedings for a certain time, and then gave place&nbsp;to a colleague. The reporter who was relieved at once extended&nbsp;his notes, and thus prompt publication of the debates was made&nbsp;possible. The practice grew until there was a good deal of&nbsp;competition among the papers as to which should first issue a&nbsp;report of any speech of note in the country. Reporters had&nbsp;frequently to ride long distances in post-chaises, doing their&nbsp;best as they jolted along the roads to transcribe their notes,&nbsp;so that they might be ready for the printer on arrival at their&nbsp;destination. Charles Dickens, whose efforts in thc way of&nbsp;reporting were celebrated, used to tell several stories of his&nbsp;adventures of this kind while he held an engagement on the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Morning Chronicle.</span><span class="font0"> One result was that the provincial newspapers were stimulated to greater efforts, and as daily newspapers sprang up in all directions, and the electric telegraph&nbsp;provided greater facilities for reporting, the old supremacy of&nbsp;the London journals in this department of newspaper work&nbsp;gradually disappeared. No public man made a speech but it&nbsp;was faithfully reproduced in print. Local governing bodies,&nbsp;charitable institutions, political associations, public companies&nbsp;—all these came in a short time to furnish work for the reporter,&nbsp;and had full attention paid to them. By the second half of the&nbsp;19th century, parliamentary reporting was a leading feature&nbsp;of thc London newspapers. They had a monopoly of it. AU&nbsp;the reporting arrangements in the House of Lords and in the&nbsp;House of Commons were made with sole regard to their requirements. There had indeed been a long battle between </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font0"> and some of the other London newspapers as to which should have the best parliamentary report, and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Times&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">had established its supremacy, which has never been shaken.&nbsp;The provincial newspapers were in the main obliged to copy&nbsp;the London reports, and rarely made any attempt to get reports&nbsp;of their own. When the electric telegraph came into use for&nbsp;commercial purposes a change began. The company which&nbsp;first carried wires from London to thc principal towns in the&nbsp;country started a reporting service for the country newspapers.&nbsp;In addition, it procured admission to the parliamentary galleries&nbsp;for reporters in its employment, and began to send short accounts&nbsp;of the debates to the newspapers in thc country. These newspapers were thus enabled to publish in the morning some&nbsp;account of the parliamentary proceedings of the previous night,&nbsp;instead of having to take like reports a day later from the London&nbsp;journals. The telegraph companies (not yet taken over by the&nbsp;state) for a long time could or would do no more than they had&nbsp;begun by doing; and they offered no inducements to the provincial newspapers to telegraph speeches. The public meanwhile&nbsp;wanted to know more fully what their representatives were&nbsp;saying in parliament, and gradually the leading provincial&nbsp;newspapers adopted the practice of employing reporters in the&nbsp;service of the London journals to report debates on subjects&nbsp;of special interest in localities; and these reports, forwarded&nbsp;by train or by post, were printed in full, but of course a day late.&nbsp;The London papers paid little attention to debates of local&nbsp;interest, and thus the provincial papers had parliamentary&nbsp;reporting which was not to bc found elsewhere. Bit by bit&nbsp;this feature was developed. It was greatly accelerated by a&nbsp;movement which the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Scotsman</span><span class="font0"> was the first to bring about.&nbsp;About 1865, a new company having come into existence, it was&nbsp;agreed that wires from London should be put at thc disposal of&nbsp;such newspapers as desired them. Each newspaper was to&nbsp;have the use of a wire— of course on payment of a large subscription—from six o’clock at night till three o’clock in the morning.&nbsp;This was the beginning of the “ special wire ” which now plays&nbsp;so important a part in the production of almost all newspapers.&nbsp;The arrangement was first made by the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Scotsman</span><span class="font0"> and by other&nbsp;newspapers in Scotland. The special wires were used to their&nbsp;utmost capacity to convey reports of the speeches of leading:&nbsp;statesmen and politicians; and, instead of bare summaries of&nbsp;what had been done, thc newspapers contained pretty full&nbsp;reports.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When the telegraphs were taken over by the state in 1870 the facilities for reporting were increased in every direction.&nbsp;The Londonpapers<sub>i</sub>Withthe exception of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Times,</span><span class="font0"> had given&nbsp;less and less attention to parliamentary debates, while onlhe&nbsp;other hand several of the provincial newspapers were giving&nbsp;more space than ever to the debates. These newspapers had&nbsp;to get their reports as best they could. The demand for such&nbsp;reporting had led, on the passing of the telegraphs into the&nbsp;hands of the state, to the formation of news agencies, which&nbsp;undertook to supply the provincial papers. These agencies&nbsp;were admitted to the reporters’ galleries in the Houses t&gt;f&nbsp;Parliament, but the reports which any agency supplied were&nbsp;identical; that is to say, all the newspapers taking a particular&nbsp;class of report had exactly the same material supplied to them&nbsp;—the reporter producing the number of copies required ,by&nbsp;means of manifold copying paper. Accordingly attempts were&nbsp;made to get separate reports by engaging the services of some&nbsp;of the reporters employed by the London papers. The “ gallery ”&nbsp;was shut to all save the London papers and the news agencies.&nbsp;The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Scotsman</span><span class="font0"> sought in vain to break through this exclusiveness.&nbsp;The line, it was said, must be drawn somewhere, and the proper&nbsp;place to draw it was at the London Press. Once that line was&nbsp;departed from every newspaper in the kingdom must have&nbsp;admission. But in 1880 a select committee of the House of&nbsp;Commons was appointed tô consider the question. It took&nbsp;evidence, and it reported in favour, of the extension of the&nbsp;gallery and of the admission of provincial papers. The result&nbsp;was that three or four papers which would be satisfied with&nbsp;the same report joined in providing the necessary reporting</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
