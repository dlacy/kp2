All theſe, except the ſcoparium, are exotics, chiefly from Spain, Portugal, Italy, &amp;c.— The <hi rend="italic">ſcoparium,</hi> or common broom, has ternate ſolitary leaves ; the branches angular, and without prickles.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Ules.</hi> The common broom is uſed for a variety of purpoſes. It has been of great benefit ſometimes in dropſical complaints. The manner in which Dr Cullen adminiſtered it was this : He ordered half an ounce of freſh broom tops to be boiled in a pound of water till one half of the water was evaporated. He then gave two table-ſpoonfuls of the decoction every hour till it operated both by ſtool and urine. By repeating theſe doſes every day, or every ſecond day, he ſays ſome dropſies have been cured. Dr Mead relates, that a dropſical patient, who had taken the ulual remedies, and been tapped three times without effect, was cured by taking half a pint of the decoction of green broom tops, with a ſpoonful of whole muſtard-ſeed every morning and evening. " An infuſion of the ſeeds drunk freely (ſays Mr Wi thering) has been known to produce ſimilar happy effects ; but whoever expects theſe effects to follow in every dropſical caſe, will be greatly deceived. I knew them ſucceed in one caſe that was truly deplorable ; but out of a great number of caſes in which the medicine had a fair trial, this proved a ſingle inſtance.”</p><p>The flower buds are in ſome countries pickled, and eaten as capers ; and the ſeeds have been uſed as a bad ſubſtitute for coffee. The branches are uſed for making beſoms, and tanning leather. They are alſo uſed inſtead of thatch to cover houſes. The old wood furniſhes the cabinet-maker with beautiful materials for vaneering. The tender branches are in ſome places mixed with hops for brewing, and the macerated bark may be manufactured into cloth.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">junceum,</hi> or Spaniſh broom, grows naturally in the ſouthern provinces of France, as well as other parts of the ſouth of Europe. It grows in the pooreſt soils, on the ſteepeſt declivities of the hills, in a ſtony soil, where hardly any other plant could vegetate. In a few years it makes a vigorous ſhrub ; inſinuating its roots between the interſtices of the ſtones, it binds the soil, and retains the ſmall portion of vegetable earth ſcattered over theſe hills, which the autumnal rains would otherwiſe waſh away. It is moſt eaſily raiſed from seed, which is uſually sown in January, after the ground has received a slight dreſſing.</p><p>This ſhrub ſerves two uſeful purpoſes. Its branches yield a thread of which linen is made, and in winter ſupport ſheep and goats.</p><p>In manufacturing thread from broom, the youngeſt plants are cut in the month of Auguſt, or after harveſt, and gathered together in bundles, which at firſt are laid in the ſun to dry : they are then beaten with a piece of wood, waſhed in a river or pond, and left to ſteep in the water for about four hours. The bundles thus prepared are taken to a little diſtance from the water, and laid in a hollow place made for them, where they are covered with fern or ſtraw, and remain thus to ſteep for eight or nine days ; during which time, all that is neceſſary, is to throw a little water once a-day on the heap, without uncovering the broom. After this, the bundles are well waſhed, the green rind of the plant or</p><p>epidermis comes off, and the fibrous part remains ; each bundle is then beaten with a wooden hammer upon a ſtone, to detach all the threads, which are at the same time carefully drawn to the extremity of the branches. After this operation, the faggots are untied, and ſpread upon ſtones or rocks till they are dry. The twigs muſt not be peeled till they are perfectly dry ; they are then dreſſed with the comb, and the threads are ſeparated according to their fineness, and ſpun upon a wheel.</p><p>The linen made of this thread ſerves various purpoſes in rural economy. The coarſeſt is employed in making ſacks and other ſtrong cloths for carrying grain or ſeeds. Of the fineſt is made bed, table, and body linen. The peaſants in ſeveral places uſe no other, for they are unacquainted with the culture of hemp or flax, their soil being too dry and too barren for railing them. The cloth made with the thread of the broom is very uſeful; it is as ſoft as that made of hemp ; and it would perhaps look as well as that made of flax if it was more carefully ſpun. It becomes white in proportion as it is ſteeped. The price of the fineſt thread, when it is fold, which ſeldom happens, is generally about a ſhilling a-pound.</p><p>The other uſe to which this broom is applied, is to maintain ſheep and goats during winter. In the mountains of Lower Languedoc theſe animals have no other food from November to April, except the leaves of trees preserved. The branches of this broom therefore are a reſource the more precious, that it is the only freſh nouriſhment which at that ſeaſon the flocks can procure, and they prefer it at all times to every other plant. In fine weather the ſheep are led out to feed on the broom where it grows ; but in bad weather the ſhepherds cut the branches, and bring them to the ſheep folds. There is, however, an inconvenience attending the continued  uſe of this food. It generally produces inflammation in the urinary paſſages. But this inconvenience is eaſily removed by cooling drink, or a change of food, or by mixing the broom with ſomething elſe.</p><p>It is perhaps needleſs to add, that it differs much from the broom that is common everywhere in the north of Europe, though this too, in many places, is uſed for food to cattle. Both of them produce flowers that are very much resorted to by bees, as they contain a great quantity of honey juice. And this ſhould be another inducement to the cultivation of the Spaniſh broom.</p><p>SPARUS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Gilt head,</hi> in natural hiſtory ; a genus of animals belonging to the claſs of <hi rend="italic">piſces,</hi> and the order of <hi rend="italic">thoracici.</hi> The fore-teeth and dog-teeth are very ſtrong ; the grinders are obtuſe and thick ſet ; the lips are folded over ; there are five rays in the gill membrane ; and the opercula are ſcaly : the body is compressed ; the lateral line is crooked behind ; and the pectoral fins are roundiſh.</p><p>Gmelin enumerates 39 ſpecies, of which only three are found in the Britiſh ſeas, the pagrus, auratus, and dentatus. 1.
