<p><label>RUEDA, LOPE DE</label>
(i5io?-i5Ó5?), Spanish dramatist, was born early in the 16th century at Seville, where, according to Cervantes, he worked as a metal-beater. His name first occurs in 1554 as acting at Bena vente, and between 1558 and 1561 he was manager of a strolling company which visited Segovia, Seville, Toledo, Madrid, Valencia and Córdova. In the last-named city Rueda fell ill, and on the 21st of March 1565 made a will which he was too exhausted to sign; he probably died shortly afterwards, and is said by Cervantes to have been buried in Córdova cathedral. He was twice married; first to a disreputable actress named Mariana, who became the mistress of the duke de Medinaceli; and second to Rafaela Angela, who bore him a daughter. His works were issued posthumously in 1567 by Timoneda, who toned down certain passages in the texts. Rueda’s more ambitious plays are mostly adapted from the Italian; in <hi rend="italic">Eufemia</hi> he draws on Boccaccio, in <hi rend="italic">Medora</hi> he utilizes Giancarli’s <hi rend="italic">Zingara,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Armelina</hi> he combines Raineri’s <hi rend="italic">Attilia</hi> with Cecchi’s <hi rend="italic">Servigiale,</hi> and in <hi rend="italic">Los Engañados</hi> he uses <hi rend="italic">Gl’Ingannati,</hi> a comedy produced by the <hi rend="italic">Intronati,</hi> a literary society at Siena. These follow the original so closely that they give no idea of Rueda’s talent; but in his <hi rend="italic">pasos</hi> or prose interludes he displays an abundance of riotous humour, great knowledge of low life, and a most happy gift*of dialogue. His predecessors mostly wrote for courtly audiences or for the study; Rueda with his strollers created a taste for the drama which he was able to gratify, and he is admitted both by Cervantes and Lope de Vega to be the true founder of the national theatre.</p><p>His works have been reprinted by the marquis de la Fuensanta del Valle in the <hi rend="italic">Colección de libros raros ó curiosos,</hi> vols, xxiii. and xxiv.</p>
