<p><label>REGGIO</label>
an ancient and conſiderable town of Italy, in the kingdom of Naples, and in the Farther Calabria, with an archbiſhop’s ſee, and a woollen manufactory. It is · ſeated in a delightful country, which produces plenty of oranges, and all their kindred fruits. The olives are exquiſite, and high-flavoured· The town, however, can boaſt oſ neither beautiful buildings nor ſtrong fortifications. 01' its edifices the Gothic cathedral is the only ſtriking one, but it affords nothing curious in architecture. The citadel is far from formidable, according to the preſent ſyſtem of tactics : nor could the city walls make a long reiiſtance againſt any enemy but Barbary corſairs ; and even tbeſe they have not always been able to repel, for in 1543 it was laid in aſhes by Barbaroffa. Muſtapha ſacked it 15 years after, and the deſolation was renewed in 1593 by another ſet of Turks. Its expofed ſituation, on the very threſhold of Italy, and fronting Sicily, has from the earlieſt period rendered it liable to attacks and devaſtation. The Chal-cidians ſcized upon it, or, according to the uſual Greek phraſe, founded it, aud called the colony <hi rend="italic">Rhegion,</hi> from a word that means a break or crack, alluding to its poſt-tion on the point where Sicily broke off from the continent. Anaxilas oppreffed its liberties. Dionyſius the Elder took it, and put many of the principal citizens to death, in revenge for their having refufed his alliance.. The Campanian legion, ſent to protect the Rhegians, turned its ſword againſt them, maffacred many inhabitants, and tyrannized over the remainder, till the Roman ſenate thought proper to puniſh theſe traitors with exemplary ſeverity, though at the ſame time it entered into kagιιe with the revolted garrifon of Meſſina. This union with a ſet of villains, guilty of the ſame crime, proved that no love of juſtice, but political reaſons alone, drew down its vengeance on the Campanians.— It is about 12 miles S. <hi rend="sub">j</hi> E. of Meſſina, and 190 S. by E. of Naples. E. Long. 16. ο. N. Lat. 38. 4.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Reggio, an ancient, handfome, and ſtrong town of Italy, in the duchy of Modena, with a ſtrong citadel, and a biſhop’s fee. It has been ruined ſeveral times by the Goths, and other nations. In the cathedral are paintings by the greateſt maſters ; and in the ſquare is the ſtatue of Brennus, chief of the Gauls. The inhabitants are about 22,</hi> coo, who carry on a great trade in ſilk. It was taken by prince Eugene in 1706, and by the king cf Sardinia in 1742. It is ſeated in a fertile country to the fouth of the Apennines, and to the north of a lpacious plain, 15 miles north-weft of Modena, and 80 ſouth-eaſt of Milan. E. Long. 11. 5. N. Lat. 44. 43. —The duchy of this name is bounded on the weſt by that of Modena, and produces a great deal of ſilk, and belongs to the duke of Modena, except the marquifate cf St Martin, which belongs to a prince of that name.</p>
