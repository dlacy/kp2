Sect. ii.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Court of Quarter-SEssi0NS,</hi> an Engliſh court that must be held in every county once in every quarter of a year; which, by ſtatute 2 Hen. V. c. 4. is appointed to be in the firſt week after Michaelmas-day, the firſt week after the epiphany, the firſt week after the cloſe of Eaſter, and in the week after the tranſlation of St Thomas the martyr, or the 7th of July. It is held before two or more juſtices of the peace, one of which muſt be of the quorum. The juriſdiction of this court, by 34 Edw. III. c. I. extends to the trying and determining all felonies and treſpaſſes whatſoever : though they ſeldom, if ever, try any greater offence than ſmall felonies within the benefit of clergy ; their commiſſion providing, that if any caſe of difficulty ariſes, they ſhall not pro</p><p>ceed to judgment, but in the preſence oſ one of the juſtices of the courts of king’s-bench or common-pleas, or one of the judges of aſſize : and therefore murders, and other capital felonies, are uſually remitted for a more ſolemn trial to the aſſizes. They cannot alſo try any new-created offence, without expreſs power given them by the ſtatute which creates it. But there are many offences and particular matters which, by particular ſtatutes, belong properly to this juriſdiction, and ought to be proſecuted in this court ; as, the ſmaller miſdemeanors against the public or commonwealth, not amounting to felony ; and eſpecially offences relating to the game, highways, alehouſes, baſtard children, the ſettlement and proviſion for the poor, vagrants, ſervants wages, and Popiſh recuſants. Some of theſe are proceeded upon by indictment : others in a ſummary way, by motion, and order thereupon; which order may for the mod part, unleſs guarded againſt by particular ſtatutes, be removed into the court of king’s-bench by writ of <hi rend="italic">certiorari facias,</hi> and be there either quaſhed or confirmed. The records or rolls of the ſeſſions are committed to the cuſtody of a ſpecial officer, denominated <hi rend="italic">custos rotulorum,</hi> who is always a juſtice of the quorum ; and among them oſ the quorum (saith Lambard) a man for the moſt part eſpecially picked out, either for wiſdom, countenance, or credit. The nomination of the <hi rend="italic">custos rotulorum</hi> (who is the principal officer in the county, as the lord-lieutenant is chief in military command) is by the king’s ſign-manual : and to him the nomination of the clerk of the peace belongs ; which office he is expreſsly forbidden to sell ſor money.</p><p>In moſt corporation-towns there are quarter-ſeſſions kept before juſtices of their own, within their reſpective limits ; which have exactly the ſame authority as the general quarter-ſeſſions of the county, except in a very few inſtances ; one of the moſt considerable of which is the matter of appeals from orders of removal of the poor, which, though they be from the orders of corporation-juſtices, muſt be to the ſeſſions of the county, by ſtatute 8 and 9 W. III. c. 30. In both corporations and counties at large, there is ſometimes kept a ſpecial or petty ſeſſion, by a few juſtices, for diſpatching ſmaller bulineſs in the neighbourhood between the times of the general ſeſſions ; as for licenſing alehouſes, paſſing the account of pariſh-officers, and the like.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
