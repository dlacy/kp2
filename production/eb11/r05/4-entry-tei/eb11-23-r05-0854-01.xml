<p><label>RUODLIEB</label>
a romance in Latin verse by an unknown German poet who flourished about 1030; he was almost certainly a monk of the Bavarian abbey of Tegernsee. The poem is one of the earh'est German romances of knightly adventure, and its vivid picture of feudal manners gives it a certain value as an historical document. The poet was probably an eye-witness of the episode (11. 4231-5221) which represents the meeting of the emperor Henry II. with Robert of France on the banks</p>

The framework of the story is borrowed from a popular <hi rend="italic">märchen</hi> of the youth who takes service away from home, and is paid in wise saws instead of current coin. He receives at the same time a loaf, with instructions not to cut it until he is once more at home. This contains the coins. The proverbs, usually three in number, were increased in <hi rend="italic">Ruodlieb</hi> to twelve, each of which was the starting-point of an episode by which the hero was made to appreciate its value.</p><p>For examples of the three-proverb tale see W. Bottrell, <hi rend="italic">Traditions and Hearthside Stories</hi> (Penzance, 2nd series, 1873); Cuthbert Bede, <hi rend="italic">The White Wife</hi> ... (London, 1868); K. V. K.[illingerl, <hi rend="italic">Erin</hi> (Stuttgart and Tübingen, 1849), and others in the French romance of the <hi rend="italic">Saint Graal,</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Gesta Romanorum</hi> (the three . proverbs bought by Domitian) and the old French <hi rend="italic">Dit des trois pommes.</hi> The best edition of <hi rend="italic">Ruodlieb</hi> is by F. Seiler (Halle, 1882). There is a modern version by M. Heine (Leipzig, 1897), and a full analysis of the contents is given by R. Koegel, <hi rend="italic">Gesch. d. deutschen Lit. bis zum Ausgange des Mittelalters</hi> (Strassburg, 1894-97, ii. pp. 342-412).</p>
