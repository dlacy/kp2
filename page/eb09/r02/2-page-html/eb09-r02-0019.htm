            <p><span class="font0">There are no salivary glands.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font0">The oesophagus is wide, and the stomach</span></p>
            <p><span class="font0">nearly circular and gizzard-like, having thick muscular walls
                    formed of fibres radiating from central tendons. The small intestine consists of
                    two parts,—an anterior part much convoluted, thin-walled,&nbsp;and lined with
                    villi, which is succeeded by a thicker-walled part&nbsp;with internal zig-zag
                    folds. There is no cæcum, but a circular prominence marks the commencement of
                    the large intestine, which is&nbsp;short and wide with a smooth lining. It is
                    funnel-shaped, and&nbsp;opens by a very narrow aperture into a very elongated
                    cloaca, the&nbsp;external opening of which is rather longitudinal.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font0">The liver, like that of Hatteria, is in two lobes, and the
                    gallbladder is beside the right lobe. The spleen lies behind
            the</span></p></div><br clear="all" />
        <p><span class="font0">pancreas between the folds of the duodenum. The various viscera of
                the abdominal cavity lie, as in Birds, in separate serous
            sacs.@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">In the Chelonia there are horny sheaths to the jaws but no teeth,
                though numerous rudiments of teeth have been found in the&nbsp;embryo of
                    Triοηyx.@@<sup>2</sup> The tongue is not extensible, but is differently
                conditioned in different genera. There appears to be only a&nbsp;sublingual salivary
                gland, though the palate of the Land Tortoise&nbsp;exhibits the apertures of
                numerous cutaneous follicles.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">The oesophagus leads to the left part of the transversely placed
                stomach. The extent of both the small and the large intestine&nbsp;varies; the
                latter is at its shortest in Trionyx. The cloaca opens&nbsp;externally by a somewhat
                rounded aperture.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">The liver is mostly large, and in two lobes connected by one or more
                transverse bands of its substance. The gall-bladder lies on&nbsp;its right and may
                be sunk within its substance. The pancreas has&nbsp;often several excretory ducts,
                and the spleen is generally of large&nbsp;size.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Respiratory System.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">All the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
                >Reptilia</span><span class="font1"> breathe air from the first moment of their
                separate existence, and are never furnished with&nbsp;anything in the shape of
                gills. The apparatus by which&nbsp;their respiration is effected is always a pair of
                sacs or lungs&nbsp;—whereof one sometimes aborts—into and from which&nbsp;air is
                introduced and removed by the intervention of an&nbsp;azygous tube, the trachea,
                which, passing forwards ventrally&nbsp;to the oesophagus, or beside it, opens in the
                floor of the&nbsp;mouth behind the tongue. The more or less dilated
                most&nbsp;anterior portion of the azygous tube is the larynx, which&nbsp;may become
                a vocal organ.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">In the Laeertilia the external opening of the larynx may, by rare
                exception, as in Phryηosoma, be placed in front of the hind-most margin of the
                tongue, so that the larynx seems to perforate that organ, but is in fact merely
                enclosed by the posterior,&nbsp;exterior, and median junction of two lingual
                processes. A membranous or cartilaginous epiglottis may protect the entrance
                to&nbsp;the larynx as in Mammals. The larynx may be composed of&nbsp;one cartilage,
                which is produced anteriorly into two arytenoid&nbsp;processes, but generally these
                latter are distinct cartilages. Folds&nbsp;of membrane or vocal cords may exist, as
                in the Geckos and&nbsp;Chamæleons, and the latter have also a wide membranous
                sac&nbsp;connected with the larynx. The trachea is generally short, but&nbsp;may be
                long, as in Amphisbæna and Lepidosternon. It is never&nbsp;convoluted, and its
                cartilages may or may not form complete rings.&nbsp;It ends posteriorly by dividing
                into two bronchi, which are usually&nbsp;very short, but may be of moderate length,
                as in Psamrnosaurιιs.&nbsp;The lungs are generally of about equal size, but in the
                Snake-like&nbsp;Lizards the right lung is the longer, and sometimes, as in
                Typhline&nbsp;and Acοntias, the left lung may be quite rudimentary. The
                lungs&nbsp;may be simple bags or may give out lateral processes or pouches&nbsp;of
                varying extent. In the Chamæleons their hinder halves are&nbsp;prolonged into narrow
                tubular processes. Each lung is enclosed&nbsp;in a fold of peritoneum.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">The Ophidia have the opening of the larynx behind the tongue rather
                prominent, with only a rudimentary epiglottis. The nature&nbsp;of their prey and
                their mode of eating do not readily expose them&nbsp;to the danger of small
                particles of food finding their way into the&nbsp;trachea. The cartilaginous
                framework of the larynx is very&nbsp;elongated. The trachea has its more anterior
                cartilages in the form&nbsp;of complete rings. The lungs are unsymmetrical in all
                the genera,&nbsp;but much more so in some than in others—one lung entirely aborting
                in Typhlops, Aeroelwrdus, and Viρera amongst others. The&nbsp;two lungs are both of
                tolerable size in Python, Boa, and Eryx,&nbsp;which have the bronchi leading from
                the trachea to the two&nbsp;pulmonary sacs. These sacs may or may not be divided
                into&nbsp;subordinate cells towards the hinder end of each. Sometimes part&nbsp;of
                the trachea itself may be dilated dorsally into cellular prominences like an
                accessory lung, as in Hydroplds, or ventrally, as in&nbsp;Aerochordus. A pulmonary
                sac may extend not only far backwards but also forwards to the hyoidean region, as
                in Heterodon.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">In the Chelonia the opening of the larynx or glottis is longitudinal.
                It may be furnished with a membranous epiglottis, or may have none, as in Testudo.
                There may be cricoid and arytenoid&nbsp;cartilages in addition to main cartilages,
                but the details of structure&nbsp;differ in different genera. There are no vocal
                cords. The trachea&nbsp;and bronchi vary in length, the former being long in most
                forms,&nbsp;the latter in Testudo. In Cinixys the trachea and bronchi
                arc&nbsp;contorted. The lungs arc invested anteriorly and on their ventral&nbsp;side
                by peritoneum, and also by the diaphragm as they lie between&nbsp;it and the
                carapace, and therefore they do not project freely into&nbsp;the abdominal
                cavity.</span></p>

                1856, the resemblance which exists in many points between Crocodiles and Birds. See
