<p><span class="font0">had sufficient interest to establish on the throne Augustus III. She entered into a treaty with the shah of Persia, by&nbsp;which she agreed to give up all title to the territories that&nbsp;had been seized by Peter I. on the shores of the Caspian,&nbsp;in consideration of certain privileges to be granted to the&nbsp;Russian merchants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1735, a rupture took place between Russia and Turkey, occasioned partly by the mutual jealousies that had subsisted between these powers ever since the treaty on&nbsp;the Pruth<sub>1</sub> and partly by the depredations of the Tartars&nbsp;of the Crimea, then under the dominion of the Porte. A&nbsp;Russian army entered the Crimea, ravaged part of the&nbsp;country, and killed a considerable number of Tartars ; but&nbsp;having ventured too far, without a sufficient supply of provisions, it was obliged to retreat, after sustaining a loss of&nbsp;nearly ten thousand men. This ill success did not discourage the court of St Petersburg ; and in the following&nbsp;year another armament was sent into the Ukraine, under&nbsp;the command of Marshal Munnich, while another army under Lascy proceeded against Azof. Both these generals&nbsp;met with considerable success ; the Tartars were defeated, and the fort of Azof once more submitted to the Russian arms. A third campaign took place in 1737, and the&nbsp;Russians were now assisted by a body of Austrian troops.&nbsp;Munnich laid siege to Otchakof, which soon surrendered,&nbsp;while Lascy desolated the Crimea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">No material advantages were, however, gained upon either side ; and disputes arose between the Austrian and Russian&nbsp;generals. At length, in 1739, Marshal Munnich, having&nbsp;crossed the Bog at the head of a considerable army, defeated the Turks in a pitched battle near Stavutshan ; made&nbsp;himself master of Yassy, the capital of Moldavia; and before the end of the campaign reduced the whole of that&nbsp;province under his subjection. These successes of the&nbsp;Russian arms induced the Porte to propose terms of accommodation ; and in the end of 1739 a treaty was concluded, by which Russia again gave up Azof and Moldavia, and, to compensate the loss of above a hundred thousand men, and vast sums of money, gained nothing but permission to build a fortress on the Don.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Upon the death of Anne, which took place in 1740, Ivan, the son of her niece the Princess of Mecklenburg, was, by&nbsp;her will, entitled to the succession ; but as he was no more&nbsp;than two years old, Biren was appointed to be administrator of the empire during his minority. This nomination&nbsp;was disagreeable to the emperor’s father and mother, and&nbsp;unpopular among the Russians. Count Munnich was employed by the princess to arrest Biren, who was tried and&nbsp;condemned to die, but was sent into exile to Siberia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The administration of the Princess Anne of Mecklenburg and her husband was upon many accounts disagreeable, not&nbsp;only to the Russians, but to other powers of Europe ; and&nbsp;the Princess Elizabeth, daughter of Peter the Great by&nbsp;Catherine, formed such a party, that in one night’s time she&nbsp;was proclaimed empress of the Russias, and the Princess of&nbsp;Mecklenburg, her husband, and son, were made prisoners.&nbsp;The fate of this unhappy family was peculiarly severe. All&nbsp;but Ivan were sent into banishment, to an island at the&nbsp;mouth of the Dvina, in the White Sea, where the Princess&nbsp;Anne died in childbed in the year 1747. Ivan’s father survived till 1775, and at last ended his miserable career in prison. The young emperor Ivan was for some time shut up&nbsp;in a monastery at Oranienburg, when, on attempting to escape, he was removed to the castle of Schlusselburg, where&nbsp;he was cruelly put to death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The chief instrument in rousing the ambition of Elizabeth, and procuring her elevation to the throne, was her physician and favourite Lestocq, who, partly by his insinuating address, and partly by the assistance of French&nbsp;gold, brought over to Elizabeth’s interest most of the royal&nbsp;guards. During the short regency of Anne of Mecklenburg,&nbsp;a new war had commenced between Russia and Sweden ; and&nbsp;this war was carried on with considerable acrimony and some&nbsp;success by Elizabeth. The Russian forces took possession&nbsp;of Abo, and made themselves masters of nearly all Finland.&nbsp;But at length, in 1743, in consequence of the negotiations&nbsp;that were carrying on regarding the succession to the Swedish crown, a peace was concluded between the two powers,&nbsp;on the condition that Elizabeth should restore the greater&nbsp;part of Finland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Soon after her accession, Elizabeth determined to nominate her successor to the imperial throne, and had fixed! her eyes on Charles Peter Ulric, son of the Duke of Hol-*&nbsp;stein-Gottorp, by Anne, daughter of Peter the Great. This’&nbsp;prince was accordingly invited into Russia, persuaded to,&nbsp;become a member of the Greek church, and proclaimed&nbsp;Grand Duke of Russia, and heir of the empire. The ceremony of his baptism was performed on the 18th of November&nbsp;1742, when he received the name of Peter Feodorovitch.&nbsp;He was at this time only fourteen years of age ; but before&nbsp;he had attained his sixteenth year, his aunt had destined&nbsp;him a consort in the person of Sophia Augusta Frederica,&nbsp;daughter of Christian Augustus prince of Anhalt-Zerbst-Dornburg. This princess, on entering the Greek church,&nbsp;took the name of Catherine which she afterwards bore on&nbsp;the throne.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Having thus settled the order of succession, Elizabeth began to take an active part in the politics of Europe. The*&nbsp;death of Charles VI. emperor of Germany, had left his!&nbsp;daughter, Maria Theresa queen of Hungary, at the mercy&nbsp;of the enterprising king of Prussia, till a formidable party&nbsp;was organized in her behalf. To this confederacy the empress of Russia acceded, and in 1747 sent a considerable&nbsp;body of troops into Germany, to the assistance of the empress-queen. The events of this long and bloody contest&nbsp;have been fully detailed in the article Prussia, comprehending the greater part of those transactions in the reign&nbsp;of Elizabeth that do not particularly regard the internal&nbsp;policy of the empire. The more private transactions of the&nbsp;court of St Petersburg, as far as they are connected with&nbsp;the intrigues of her niece Catherine and the follies of the&nbsp;Grand Duke Peter, have also been related in our life of&nbsp;Catherine II. Elizabeth died on the 5th of January 1762,&nbsp;the victim of disease brought on by intemperance. With&nbsp;her character as a private woman we have little business&nbsp;here. Her merits as a sovereign are fairly estimated in the&nbsp;following sketch of her character by Tooke.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ Elizabeth, as empress, governed but little of herself, it being properly her ministers and favourites who dictated'&nbsp;her regulations and decrees. Of this number, besides Bes-tnchef, was also Razumofsky, to whom, it has been said,&nbsp;the empress was even privately married. At the beginning of her reign, it is true, she went a few times to the&nbsp;sitting of the senate ; but the matters transacted there were&nbsp;by much too serious for her mind ; and, accordingly, she&nbsp;very soon left off that practice altogether, contenting herself by confirming with her signature the resolutions of that&nbsp;assembly, and the determinations of her minister, or the conference, which supplied the place of the council.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ Her character in general was mild, as was evident from the tears it cost her whenever she received accounts from&nbsp;Prussia even of victories gained by her own army, on account of the human blood by which they must necessarily&nbsp;have been purchased. Yet even this delicate sensibility&nbsp;did not restrain her from prosecuting the war into which&nbsp;she had entered from a species of revenge, and for the purpose of humbling the king of Prussia, and, even on her&nbsp;death-bed, from exhorting the persons who surrounded her&nbsp;to the most vigorous continuation of it. It also proceeded&nbsp;from this sensibility, that immediately on her accession to&nbsp;the government she made the vow never to put her signature to a sentence of death. A resolution which she faith</span></p>
