On his return he received the submiſſion of the Atropatii, a barbarous people in Media ; and put to death his prime miniſter Hermias, whom he found hatching treacherous deſigns againſt him. During his lifetime, however, the traitor, by accusing Achæus of treaſon, had obliged him to revolt in his own defence.·, ſo that the king had ſtill two important wars on his hands, viz. that with Ptolemy king of Egypt, and the other againſt Achæus. After ſome deliberation, he reſolved to march firſt againſt the king of Egypt ; and was at firſt very ſucceſsful, reducing many cities in Coelesyria and Paleſtine, and defeating the Egyptians in a pitched battle : but in the year 217 B. C. being worſted in the battle of Ravhia, he was obliged to abandon all his conqueſts ; of which Ptolemy immediately took poſſession, and Antiochus was obliged to cede them to him, that he might be at leiſure to purſue the war againſt Achæus.</p><p>Antiochus having made vaſt preparations for his expedition, ſoon reduced Achæus to such diſtreſs, that he was obliged to ſhut himſelf up in the city of Sardis, which he defended for ſome time with great bravery ; till at laſt, being betrayed by two Cretans, he was delivered up to the king, and by his order put to death. Antiochus then undertook an expedition againſt the Parthians, whom he obliged to conclude a peace on very advantageous terms. He then turned his arms againſt the king of Bactria, whom he alſo compelled to agree to his terms ; one of which was, that he ſhould give him up all his elephants. For the confirmation of the treaty, the king of Bactria ſent his ſon to Antiochus ; who being taken with his majeſtic mien and agreeable converſation, gave him one of his daughters in marriage. He then croſſed Mount Caucaſus, and entered India ; where having renewed his alliance with the king of that country, he received alſo of his elephants, which increaſed his ſtock to 150. From India he marched into Arachoſia, Drangiana, and Carmania, eſtabliſhing order and diſcipline in all thoſe countries : then paſſing through Perira, Babylonia, and Meſopotamia, he returned to Antioch, after an abſence of ſeven years.</p><p>In the year 204 B. C. Antiochus entered into a league with Philip of Macedon, on purpoſe to deprive Ptolemy Epiphanes, the infant king of Egypt, of all his dominions. The Egyptians, however, put the young king under the tuition of the Romans ; who immediately required the confederate princes to deſiſt from any enterprise againſt the king of Egypt, under the penalty of incurring the diſpleaſure of the republic. After delivering this message, M. Emilius Lepidus, one of the ambaſſadors, repaired to Egypt, where he took upon himſelf the office of regent and guardian to the young king. Having regulated affairs there in the best manner he could, he returned to Rome, after having appointed one Ariſtomenes, an Acarnanian, to be chief miniſter to the king. Ariſtomenes being a man of prudence and fidelity, acquitted himſelf very well in his new ſtation. Having taken care to recruit his army as well as he could, he ſent one Scopas, a man of great authority among the Ætolians, into that country, to raiſe auxiliaries. Scopas ſoon raised an army of 6000 Ætolians, at that time reputed the best ſoldiers in the world ; and having joined the Egyptian army, reduced all Judea, put a garriſon into the caſtle at Jeruſalem, and, on the approach of winter, returned to Alexandria loaded with booty. Theſe exploits, however, were performed when Antiochus was abſent in Asia Minor; and no ſooner was he returned, than the face of affairs was changed. Scopas was defeated in a pitched battle, where one half of his men were deſtroyed. He himſelf eſcaped to Sidon, where he ſhut himſelf up with 10,000 of his ſoldiers; but Antiochus having inveſted the place, Scopas was reduced to the neceſſity of ſurrendering at diſcretion. The king purſued his conqueſts ; recovered all Paleſtine and Cœleſyria ; after which he invaded Aſia Minor, in hopes of reducing it alſo, and reſtoring the Syrian empire to the ſame extent it had in the time of Seleucus Nicator. The free cities in Aſia Minor immediately had recourse to the Romans, who ſent an embaſſy to Antiochus on the occaſion ; but as both parties put on thoſe haughty and imperious airs to which they thought the greatneſs of their power gave them a right, no ſatisfaction was given, but every thing tended to an open rupture. While matters were in this ſituation, Hannibal the Great being obliged to leave his own country, fled to Antiochus : from whom he met with a gracious reception. As Hannibal had, while a child, ſworn perpetual enmity againſt the Romans, he uſed all his eloquence to perſuade Antiochus to make war with them ; and as the many victories which he had gained over them left no room to doubt of his capacity, Antiochus doubted nothing of being able, by his aſſiſtance, to conquer that haughty people. Several embaſſies passed between the two nations; but chiefly with a deſign, on the part of Antiochus, to gain time. Hannibal endeavoured to draw his countrymen into the confederacy againſt Rome, but without effect. Antiochus having ſtrengthened himſelf by ſeveral alliances, at laſt reſolved to begin the war in earneſt. To consult on the meaſures proper to be taken, he called a council of war ; but excluded from it the only man whoſe advice he ought to have followed ; namely, Hannibal the Carthaginian. The reaſon of this was, that he had become jealous of him from the too great intimacy, as he thought, which he had kept with the Roman ambaſſadors. However, in this council it was agreed that the war ſhould be immediately commenced. The King himſelf was prevailed upon by the Ætolians to paſs over into Greece, and at the ſame time entirely to reject the advice which Hannibal had formerly given, of sending him with an army into Italy. Here he was made generaliſſimo of all the Greek forces.; but made none of thoſe efforts that had formerly obtained him the title of Great. Indeed it now plainly appeared, not only that he was incapable of carrying on war againſt ſuch enemies as the Romans, but even of accepting proper advice when it was given him. In another council, into which Hannibal was admitted, that commander adviſed the king, before he undertook any thing else, to uſe his utmoſt endeavours to gain over Philip of Macedon ; which, he ſaid, was a lien ſo important, that if it could be gained, they might, without much ado, become masters of all Greece. But if Philip could not be prevailed on to make war on the Romans, he was of opinion that the king ſhould send his ſon Seleucus into Macedon at the head of an army, and thus prevent Philip from giving the Romans any aſſiſtance. But he ſtill maintained, that the only way to defeat the Romans was to send an army into Italy. This advice was again rejected ; and the king imprudently became the aggreſſor, by falling on a body of 500 Romans before war had been declared. He alſo made king Philip his enemy, by entertaining the regent of Athamania, who was a pretender to the crown of Macedon. To complete all, he himſelf fell in love, tho’ above 40 years of age, with a beautiful young woman of Chalcis, whom he married ; and became ſo great a ſlave to this paſſion, that he entirely neglected his affairs ; the army gave themſelves up entirely to diſſipation and debauchery, and every trace of military diſcipline vaniſhed.</p><p>In the year 191 B. C. Antiochus was raised from his lethargy by a declaration of war againſt him at Rome, and ſet out for Ætolia. His army at this time amounted to no more than 10,000 foot and 500 horſe. He had been made.</p></body></text></TEI>
