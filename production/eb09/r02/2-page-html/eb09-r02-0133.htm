<p><span class="font0">on the land than torrential floods. The valleys, moreover, of torrential rivers are steeper and less fertile than the&nbsp;alluvial plains of gently flowing rivers ; and, consequently,&nbsp;the high short floods of the former are less injurious than&nbsp;the long continuing lower floods of the latter. The long&nbsp;duration of a flood is also the more prejudicial, as sometimes a flood remains long enough on the land for a second&nbsp;flood to come down before the first has subsided, thereby&nbsp;producing an increased rise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Floods are generally largest in the winter months, for, owing to the absence of evaporation, a much larger proportion of rainfall finds its way into the rivers at that&nbsp;period ; and the greatest floods occur when rain falls on&nbsp;melting snow. High floods, however, sometimes occur in&nbsp;the summer after an exceptionally heavy rainfall ; and&nbsp;they are necessarily far more injurious at that time of the&nbsp;year, devastating the crops on the land which they&nbsp;inundate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Floods are due to the inadequacy of the river channel to carry off the water poured into it within a given period.&nbsp;The bed of a river, being formed and maintained by its&nbsp;stream, is merely adequate to carry the ordinary discharge. Large floods occur at too distant intervals to&nbsp;scour a sufficient channel for their passage, and consequently they overflow the banks and inundate the adjacent&nbsp;districts. Other causes, moreover, tend to aggravate this&nbsp;evil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A river carries down a large amount of solid matter which has been either ground from the mountain rocks by&nbsp;glaciers, washed from the land by the inflowing streams,&nbsp;or thrown into it as refuse from towns and manufactories.&nbsp;This material tends to settle in the channel wherever the&nbsp;current is checked, and consequently raises its bed and&nbsp;impedes the flow of the stream. Moreover, a river flowing through a plain gradually increases its serpentine&nbsp;course, thereby diminishing its fall and reducing its velocity. Accordingly the tendency of rivers is to deteriorate&nbsp;when left to themselves ; and the discharging capacity of&nbsp;their channels becomes less, whilst the extension of subsoil&nbsp;drainage causes the rain to flow more rapidly and completely into the river upon whose basin it falls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The available fall of the river is frequently diminished by the erection of fixed weirs across the channel, at various&nbsp;places, for the purpose of forming a head of water for mills,&nbsp;or of providing still-water navigation. These weirs are&nbsp;generally constructed with high sills, and of inadequate&nbsp;width ; and where flood openings closed by draw-doors&nbsp;are adopted the doors are frequently not fully raised till&nbsp;a flood has actually arrived. These weirs consequently&nbsp;not merely reduce the discharging capacity of the channel&nbsp;by diminishing the available fall of the water surface, but&nbsp;also actually restrict the section of the channel. The&nbsp;result is that floods occur more frequently, rise higher,&nbsp;and remain on the land for a longer period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Prevention of Floods.—</span><span class="font0">The entire prevention of floods would entail a larger expenditure than the results would&nbsp;justify. In most cases, the prevention of summer floods&nbsp;and the mitigation of winter floods would suffice ; for,&nbsp;whilst summer floods are always very injurious, winter&nbsp;floods prove sometimes beneficial in depositing the mud&nbsp;which they bring down, provided they do not remain very&nbsp;long upon the land. Occasionally, however, where large&nbsp;tracts of low-lying country are exposed to inundation, and&nbsp;especially where portions of towns are below the flood&nbsp;level, it is necessary to extend the protection so as to&nbsp;ensure entire immunity from floods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There are three methods by which floods may be prevented or mitigated, namely,—(1) improvement of channel ; (2) embankment of channel ; (3) pumping.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(1) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Improvement of Channel.—</span><span class="font0">The discharging capacity of a river may be increased by enlarging the section of its&nbsp;channel ; by the formation of straight cuts, which reduce&nbsp;its length, and consequently increase its fall ; by dredging&nbsp;away shoals, and thus rendering the fall of its bed more&nbsp;uniform ; and by removing obstacles to its flow at weirs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The channels of the English Fen rivers have been enlarged and straightened, and additional straight drains have been&nbsp;excavated for the more effectual drainage of the low-lying&nbsp;Fen country. Catchwater drains have also been formed&nbsp;to collect the rainfall of the higher lands and convey it&nbsp;into the river lower down, thus gaining a better fall than&nbsp;could be obtained if the upland waters were allowed to&nbsp;flow down to the low lands, besides relieving the low&nbsp;lands of this additional discharge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Straight cuts are very useful when the fall is slight and the velocity of flow is consequently small ; but they are not&nbsp;so suitable for more rapid streams, and, besides modifying&nbsp;the flow, and thus tending to produce shoals below, their&nbsp;straight course is liable to be altered by the irregularities&nbsp;of the current, especially if joining a sharp bend above.&nbsp;The banks in such cases need protection against erosion,&nbsp;which adds considerably to the cost of the works. The&nbsp;improvement of the upper Mississippi by cut-offs has not&nbsp;proved satisfactory ; and it has been found preferable to&nbsp;train the river by brushwood mattresses and dykes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Solid weirs across a river form serious impediments to its flow ; and draw-door or movable weirs should be provided with adequate waterways, and sills level with the bed&nbsp;of the river. Old bridges, also, with wide piers and&nbsp;narrow arches retard the discharge of a river, and their&nbsp;rebuilding with wide openings would afford considerable&nbsp;relief. All obstacles in the river bed, such as weeds,&nbsp;fallen trees, and refuse, should be periodically removed;&nbsp;and fish-traps at weirs should be discarded, as they collect&nbsp;floating leaves and rubbish in their meshes and thus soon&nbsp;become entirely blocked up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(2) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Embankment of Channel.—</span><span class="font0">When it is essential that the lands bordering a river should be absolutely protected&nbsp;from inundation, the enlargement of a river bed to an&nbsp;adequate extent for discharging the greatest floods would&nbsp;be too costly, especially when the fall is small; and it&nbsp;becomes necessary to resort to the expedient of increasing&nbsp;the channel, above the surface of the ground, by forming&nbsp;embankments along each side. By making the banks with&nbsp;material excavated from the channel, the earthwork serves&nbsp;the double purpose of enlarging the river bed and forming&nbsp;a bank. A flood channel of considerable dimensions can&nbsp;be readily obtained by placing the embankments some&nbsp;distance back from the margin of the river, thus greatly&nbsp;enlarging the section when the waters rise above the level&nbsp;of the land, whilst leaving the natural river bed unaltered&nbsp;for the ordinary flow. In some cases merely low embankments are constructed, which retain small floods but are&nbsp;submerged when large floods come down. Embankments,&nbsp;however, formed to secure the surrounding country from&nbsp;inundation must be high enough to exceed the highest&nbsp;flood level of the river, strong enough to resist the pressure of the water at that level, and perfectly watertight.&nbsp;If water can percolate through the bank, a breach is&nbsp;readily formed ; and if a high bank is overtopped by the&nbsp;river, the rush of the stream over it soon destroys a portion&nbsp;of the embankment and produces a disastrous inundation&nbsp;from the large volume of water suddenly liberated. The&nbsp;Fens of Lincolnshire, a large portion of Holland, the valley&nbsp;of the Po, and large tracts of low-lying land bordering the&nbsp;Mississippi are protected by embankments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The defects in the system of embanking rivers are—that weak points in the banks are liable to be breached ; that&nbsp;the banks are liable to be overtopped by unusually high&nbsp;floods ; and that the muddy waters of the river in flood</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
