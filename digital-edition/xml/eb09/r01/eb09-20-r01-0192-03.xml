a town of Nupi or Nufi, on the bank of the Kworra (Niger), opposite the island of Zagozhi, in 9º 6' N. lat., and 200 miles above the confluence of the Kworra and the Binue. At the time of Lander’s visit in 1830 it was a place of 40,000 inhabitants and one of the most important markets in the country. In 1851 Dr Barth reported it “in ruins,” and in 1867 Rohlfs found it with only 500 inhabitants. A mission station, established there in 1857 by the Church Missionary Society, was afterwards withdrawn. The town has latterly somewhat recovered its position.</p>
