<p><span class="font0">criminal in two. This was a ſeverity that might take the name of cruelty ; but the vices of the age, in&nbsp;ſome meaſure, required it. In theſe puniſhments inflicted on the guilty, the Chriſtians, who had all along&nbsp;been growing more numerous, were ſharers. Againſt&nbsp;theſe he drew up ſeveral letters and edicts, which ſhowed that he intended a very ſevere perſecution ; but if&nbsp;we may believe the credulous hiſtorians of the times,&nbsp;he was diverted juſt as he was going tv&gt; ſign them by a&nbsp;thunderbolt, which fell ſo near his perſon, that all the&nbsp;people judged him to be deſtroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But, however Heaven might have interpoſed on this occaſion, ſt is certain that his ſeverities at laſt were the&nbsp;cauſe of his deſtruction. Meneſthus, his principal ſecretary, having been threatened by him for ſome fault&nbsp;which he had committed, began to c<sup>1</sup>θnfider how he&nbsp;might prevent the meditated blow. For this purpoſe,&nbsp;he forged a roll of the names of ſeveral perſons, whom&nbsp;he pretended the emperor had marked out for death,&nbsp;adding his own to ſtrengthen him in the conſidence of&nbsp;the party. The ſcroll thus contrived was ſhown with&nbsp;an air of the utmoſt ſecrecy to ſome of the perſons concerned ; and they, to procure their ſafety, immediately&nbsp;agreed with him to deſtroy the emperor. This reſolution was ſoon put in execution ; for, as the emperor&nbsp;paſſed with a ſmall guard from Uraclea, in Thrace, towards Byzantium, the conſpirators ſet upon him at&nbsp;once, and flew him with very ſmall reſiſtance. He was&nbsp;ſlain in the 6oth, or, as ſome ſay, in the 6 id year of&nbsp;his age, after a very active reign of almoſt five years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The number of pretenders to the throne, which had formerly inſeſted the empire, were, by the laſt monarch’s&nbsp;activity, ſo entirely removed, that there now ſeemed to&nbsp;be none that would venture to declare himſelf a candidate. The army referred the choice to the ſenate ; and,&nbsp;on the other ſide, the ſenate declined it ; ſo that a ſpace&nbsp;of near eight months elapſed in theſe negociations. At&nbsp;length, however, the ſenate made choice of Tacitus, a&nbsp;man of great merit, and noway ambitious of the honours that were offered him. Upon being ſolicited to&nbsp;accept the empire, he at firſt refuſed, and retired to&nbsp;his country-houſe in Campania, to avoid their importunities ; but being at length prevailed upon, he accepted the reins of government, being at that time yy&nbsp;years old.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">One of the firſt acts of his government was the puniſhment of thoſe who had conſpired againſt the late&nbsp;emperor. Meneſthus was impaled alive, his body being thrown to be devoured by wild beaſts ; his eſtate&nbsp;alſo was conſiſcated to the exchequer ; and his ready&nbsp;money, which was very conſiderable, applied towards&nbsp;paying the army. During this ſhort reign, the ſenate&nbsp;ſeemed to have a large ſhare of authority, and the hiſtorians of the times are liberal of their praiſes to ſuch&nbsp;emperors as were thus willing to divide their power.—&nbsp;Upon endeavouring to obtain the conſulſhip for his brother Probus, he was refuſed it by the ſenate ; at which&nbsp;he ſeemed no way moved, but calmly remarked that&nbsp;the ſenate beſt knew whom to chooſe. This moderation prevailed in all the reſt of his conduct ; hc was extremely temperate ; his table was plain, and furniſhed&nbsp;with nothing expenſive ; he even prohibited his empreſs from wearing jewels, and forbad the uſe of gold&nbsp;and embroidery. He was Fond of learning, and the&nbsp;•memory of ſuch men as had deſerved well of theif&nbsp;country. He particularly eſteemed the works of his&nbsp;nameſake Tacitus the hiſtorian ; commanding that they&nbsp;ſhould be placed in every public library throughout the&nbsp;empire, and that many copies of them ſhould be tran-ſcribed at the public charge. A reign begun with ſuch&nbsp;moderation and juſtice, only wanted continuance to&nbsp;have made the empire happy ; but after enjoying the&nbsp;empire about ſix months, hc died of a fever in his&nbsp;march to oppoſe the Perſians and Scythians, who had&nbsp;invaded the eaſtern parts of the empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Upon the death of Tacitus the army ſeemed divided in the choice of an emperor ; one part of it choſe Flo-rianus, brother to the deceaſed ; but the majority were&nbsp;for ſome time undetermined. They alleged amongſt&nbsp;each other the neceſſity of chooſing one eminent for&nbsp;valour, honour, piety, clemency, and probity ; but the&nbsp;laſt virtue being that chiefly inſiſted upon, the whole army, as if by common conſent, cried out that Probus&nbsp;ſhould be emperor. He was accordingly confirmed in&nbsp;this dignity with the uſual ſolemnities : and Florianus&nbsp;finding himſelſ deſerted, even by thoſe legions who had&nbsp;promiſed to ſtand up in his ſupport, opened his arteries&nbsp;and bled himſelf to death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Probus was 44 years old when he aſcended the throne, being born of noble parentage at Sirmium in&nbsp;Pannonia, and bred up a ſoldier ſrom his youth. He&nbsp;began early to diſtinguiſh himſelf for his diſcipline and&nbsp;valour ; being ſrequently the firſt man who in beſieging&nbsp;towns ſealed the walls, or that burſt into the enemy’s&nbsp;camp. He was no leſs remarkable for ſingle combats,&nbsp;and ſaving the lives of many eminent citizens. </span><span class="font1">Nor&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">was his activity and courage, when elected to the empire, leſs apparent, than in his private ſtation. He&nbsp;firſt repreſſed the Germans in Gaul, of whom he flew&nbsp;400,000. He then marched into Dalmatia, to oppoſe&nbsp;and ſubdue the Sarmatians. From thence he led his&nbsp;forces into Thrace, and forced the Goths to ſuc for&nbsp;peace. He after that turned his arms towards Aſia ;&nbsp;ſubdued the province of Iſauria ; and marching onward, conquered a people called the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Blemyes ;</span><span class="font0"> who,&nbsp;leaving their native ſoreſts of Ethiopia, had poſſeſſed&nbsp;themſelves of Arabia and Judea, and had continued in&nbsp;a ſtate of rebellion ſince the reign of Gallienus. Nar-ſis alſo, the king of Perſia, ſubmitted at his approach :&nbsp;and upon his return into Europe, he divided the depopulated parts of Thrace among its barbarous invaders :&nbsp;a circumſtance that afterwards produced great calamities to the empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">His diligence was not leſs conſpicuous in ſuppreffing inteſtine commotions. Saturninus, being compelled by&nbsp;the Egyptians to declare himſelf emperor, was defeated&nbsp;and ſlain. Proculus alſo (a perſon remarkable only for&nbsp;his great attachment to women, and who boaſted in a&nbsp;letter, that, having taken 100 Sarmatian virgins priſoners, he deprived ten of that name in one night, and all&nbsp;the reſt within a fortnight) ſet up againſt the emperor ;&nbsp;but was compelled to fly, and at length delivered up by&nbsp;the Germans. At the ſame time Conoſus (who was a&nbsp;remarkable votary to Bacchus, being able to drink as&nbsp;much wine as ten could do, without being difordered<sub>4</sub>)&nbsp;rebelled, and being overcome hanged himſelf in deſpair.&nbsp;Probus, when he ſaw him immediately after his death,&nbsp;could not avoid pointing to him, and ſaying, <sup>w</sup> There&nbsp;hangs not a man but a caſk.” Still, however, not-withſtauding every effort to give quiet to the empire,</span></p>
