<p><span class="font3">Louis XVII. General wurmſer </span><span class="font1">reſuſed </span><span class="font3">to accept of it upon theſe terms, inſiſting upon an abfolute ſurren-der to his Imperial Majeſty. In conſequence oſ the&nbsp;delay occaſioned by diſagreement, the negociation was&nbsp;diſcovered, and the citizens of Straſhourg engaged in&nbsp;the plot wererſeized by St Juſt and Lebas, commiffion-ers from the ^convention, and brought to the ſcaffold.&nbsp;Prodigious efforts were now made by tbe French to&nbsp;recover their ground in this quarter. General Irem-bert was ſhot at the head of the army on the 9th of&nbsp;November, upon a charge, probably ill-founded, of&nbsp;treachery in the affair of the lines of weiſſembourg,&nbsp;On tlie 14th, however, Fort Louis was taken by tlie&nbsp;allies, not without ſuſpicion of treachery in tlie governor. But here the ſucceſs of general wurmſer might&nbsp;be ſaid to terminate. On tbe 2iſt tlie republican ar-my drove back tlie Auſtrians, and penetrated almoſt to&nbsp;Hagenau. An army from tlie Moſelle now advanced&nbsp;to co-operate with tlie army of tlie Rhine. On tlie&nbsp;1 7th the Pruffians were defeated near Sarhruck. Next&nbsp;day tlieir camp at Blieſcaſtel was ſtormed, and the&nbsp;Frencli advanced to Deux Ponts. On the 29th and&nbsp;30th tbe Frencli were repulſed witli great loſs in two&nbsp;violent attacks made on the duke of Brtinſwick near&nbsp;Lautern. But it now appeared that tlie French had&nbsp;come into tlie field witli a determination to conquer&nbsp;whatever it might coſt. Every day was a day of battle,&nbsp;and torrents of blood were ſhed on both ſides. The&nbsp;allies had the advantage of poffeffing the ground, wliicli,&nbsp;in that quarter, at ſuch a late ſeafon of tlie year, is very&nbsp;ſtrong on account of its inequalities and moraffes. In&nbsp;military ſkill, the French officers and thoſe of the allies&nbsp;were perhaps nearly equal ; but the French army was&nbsp;by ſar the moſt numerous ; and although not a match&nbsp;in point of diſcipline, yet it derived no ſmall ſuperiority&nbsp;from the enthuſiaſm with which the troops were animated. On the 8tli of December, under the command&nbsp;of general Pichegru, the French carried the redoubts&nbsp;which covered Hagenau by means of the bayonet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Tliis modern inſtrument of deſtruction, againſt whicli no deſenſive weapon is employed, is always moſt ſucceſs-ful in the hands of the moſt intrepid ; and it was now a&nbsp;dreadful engine in the hands of French enthuſiaſm.—&nbsp;The </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ſineſt </span><span class="font3">troops that ever Europe produced were unable to withſtand the fury of the republicans, which&nbsp;ſeemed only to increaſe in proportion to the multitude&nbsp;of companions that they loſt. On the 22d the allies&nbsp;were driven with immenſe ſiaugliter from Hagenau, not-withſtanding tlie iinrnenſe works they liad thrown up&nbsp;for their defence. The entrenchments on tlie heights&nbsp;of Reiſhoffen, Jauderſhoffen, &amp;C. were conſidered as&nbsp;more impregnable than thoſe of Jemappe. They were&nbsp;ſtormed by the army of the Moſelle and the Rhine,&nbsp;under generals Hoche and Pichegru. On the 23d and&nbsp;24th, die allies were purſued to the heights of wrotte.&nbsp;On the 26th, the entrenchments there were forced by&nbsp;tlie bayonet, after a deſperate conflict. O11 the 27th,&nbsp;the republican army arrived at weiffembourg in tri-umph. General wurmſer retreated acroſs the Rhine,&nbsp;and the duke of Brunſwick haſtily fell back to cover&nbsp;Mentz. The blockade of Landau, which had laſted&nbsp;four months, was raiſed. Fort Louis was evsffcuated&nbsp;by the allies, and Kaiſerſſatern, Germerſheim, and&nbsp;Spires, ſubmitted to the French.—During this laſt&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">month of the year 1793, the loſs of men on both </span><span class="font3">ſideg</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><a name="caption1"></a><h3><span class="font0">in this quarter was immenſe, and unexampled in the hiſtory of modern war. It is even ſaid that it might&nbsp;amount to more than 70,000 or 80,000 men.</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Thus far we have attended to the military affairs of </span><span class="font1">the </span><span class="font3">republic for ſome time paſt. Very violent efforts&nbsp;were iu the mean time made at Paris by the new admi-niſtration, eſtabliſhed under the auſpices of the Jacobin&nbsp;club, and of the party called the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Mountain.</span><span class="font3"> The new&nbsp;republican conſtitution had been preſented to the people&nbsp;in the primary affemblies, and accepted. The buſmeſs,&nbsp;therefore, for which the convention was called toge-ther, that of forming a conſtitution for France, was&nbsp;at an end ; and it </span><span class="font1">was </span><span class="font3">propoſed that they ſhould diffolve themſelves, and order a new legiſſative body to aſ-ſemble, according to the rules preſcribed by that con-ſtitution. This was, no doubt, the regular mode of&nbsp;procedure ; but the ruling party conſidered it as hazardous to convene a new aſſembly, poffeffing only limited&nbsp;powers, in the preſent diſtracted ſtate of the country.&nbsp;It was indeed obvious, that France at this time ſtood in&nbsp;need of a dictatorſhip, or of a government poffeffed of&nbsp;more abſolute authority than can be enjoyed by one&nbsp;that acts, or even pretends to act, upon the moderate&nbsp;principles of freedom. It was therefore determined&nbsp;that the convention ſhould remain undiffolved till the&nbsp;end of the war ; and that a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">revolutionary</span><span class="font3"> government,&nbsp;to be conducted by its members, ſhould be eſtabliſhed,&nbsp;with uncontrouled powers. Committees of its own&nbsp;body were ſelected for the purpoſe of conducting every&nbsp;department of buſineſs. The chief of theſe committees was called the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">committee of public ſafety.</span><span class="font3"> It ſuper-intended all the reſt, and gave to the adminiſtration of&nbsp;France all the ſecrecy and diſpatch which have been accounted peculiar to a military government, together&nbsp;with a. combination of ſkill and energy hitherto un-known among mankind. A correſpondence was kept&nbsp;up with all the Jacobin clubs throughout tlie kingdom. Commiffioners from the convention were ſent&nbsp;into all quarters, with unlimited authority over every&nbsp;order of perſons. Thus a government poffeffed of infinite vigilance, and more abſolute and tyrannical than&nbsp;that of any ſingle deſpot, was eſtabliſhed ; and tlie&nbsp;whole tranſactions and reſources of the ſtate were&nbsp;known to the rulers. On the 23d of Auguſt, Barrere,&nbsp;in name of the committee of public ſaſety, procured&nbsp;the celebrated decree to be paffed for placing the whole&nbsp;French nation in a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">fate of requiftion</span><span class="font3"> for the public ſervice. “ From this moment (ſays the decree) till that&nbsp;when all enemies ſhall have been driven from the territory of the republic, all Frenchmen ſhall be in perma-nent readineſs ſor the ſervice oſ tlie army. The young&nbsp;men ſhall march to the combat ; the married men ſhaſt&nbsp;forge arms, and tranſport the proviſions ; tlie women&nbsp;ſhall make tents and clothes, and attend in tlie hoſpitals ; the children ſhall make lint oſ old linen ; tlie old&nbsp;men ſhall cauſe themſelves to be carried to the public&nbsp;ſquares, to excite the courage of tlie warriors, to pleach&nbsp;hatred againſt the enemies of the republic; tlie cellars&nbsp;ſllall be waſhed to procure ſaltpetre ; tbe ſaddle-horſes&nbsp;ſhall be given up to complete the cavalry ; the unmarried citizens, ſrom the age oſ 18 to 25, ſhall march&nbsp;ſirſt, and none ſhall ſend a ſubſtitute ; every battalion&nbsp;ſhall liave a banner, with this inſcription, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The French&nbsp;nation riſen agaiofl tyrants.”</span><span class="font3"> The decree alſo regulates&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">the mode of organizing this maſs. </span><span class="font3">A dccree more ty</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
