By this great circumference the field of your uſeful reſearches will be incloſed ; but ſince Egypt had unqueſtionably an old connection with this country, if not with China, ſince the language and literature of the Abyſſinians bear a maniſeſt affinity to thoſe of Aſia, ſince the Arabian arms prevailed along the African coaſt of the Mediterranean, and even erected a powerful dynaſty on the continent of Europe, you may not be diſpleaſed occasionally to follow the ſtreams of Aſiatic learning a little beyond its natural boundary ; and, if it be neceſſary or  convenient that a ſhort name or epithet be given to our ſociety, in order to diſtinguiſh it in the world, that of <hi rend="italic">Aſiatic</hi> appears both claſſical and proper, whether we conſider the place or the object of the inſtitution, and preferable to <hi rend="italic">Oriental,</hi> which is in truth a word merely relative, and though commonly uſed in Europe, conveys no very diſtinct idea.</p><p>“ If now it be asked, What are the intended objects of our inquiries within theſe ſpacious limits ? we answer, <hi rend="smallcaps">Man</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Nature;</hi> whatever is performed by the <hi rend="italic">one </hi>or produced by the <hi rend="italic">other.</hi> Human knowledge has been elegantly analyſed according to the three great faculties of the mind, <hi rend="italic">memory, reaſon,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">imagination,</hi> which we conſtantly find employed in arranging and retaining, comparing and distinguiſhing, combining and diverſifying, the ideas, which we receive through our ſenſes, or acquire by reflection : hence the three main branches of learning are, Hi<hi rend="italic">ſtory, ſcience,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">art ;</hi> the firſt comprehends either an account of natural productions, or the genuine records of empires and ſtates ; the ſecond embraces the whole circle of pure and mixed mathematics, together with ethics and law, as far as they depend on the reaſoning faculty ; and the third includes all the beauties of imagery and the charms of invention, diſplayed in modulated language, or repreſented by colour, figure, or found.</p><p>“ Agreeably to this analyſis, you will inveſtigate whatever is rare in the ſtupendous fabric of nature, will correct the geography of Aſia by new obſervations and diſcoveries; will trace the annals and even traditions of thoſe nations who from time to time have peopled or desolated it ; and will bring to light their various forms of government, with their inſtitutions civil and religious; you will examine their improvements and methods in arithmetic and. geometry ; in trigonometry, menſuration, mechanics, optics, aſtronomy, and general phyſics; their ſyſtems of morality, grammar, rhetoric, and dialectic ; their skill in chirurgery and medicine ; and their advancement, whatever it may be, in anatomy and chemiſtry. To this you will add reſearches into their agriculture, manufactures, trade ; and whilſt you inquire with pleaſure into their music, architecture, painting, and poetry, will not neglect thoſe inferior arts by which the comforts and even elegancies of ſocial life are ſupplied or improved. You may obſerve, that I have omitted their languages, the diverſity and difficulty of which are a ſad obſtacle to the progreſs of uſeful knowledge ; but I have ever conſidered languages as the mere inſtruments of real learning, and think them improperly confounded with learning itſelf : the attainment of them is, however, indiſpenſably neceſſary ; and if to the Perſian, Armenian, Turkiſh, and Arabic, could be added not only the Shanſcrit, the treaſures of which we may now hope to ſee unlocked, but even the Chineſe, Tartarian, Japaneſe, and the various insular dialects, an immenſe mine would then be open, in which we might labour with equal delight and advantage.”</p><p>Of this ſociety three volumes of the Tranſactions have been publiſhed, which are replete with information in a high degree curious and important ; and we hope that the European world ſhall ſoon be favoured with another. The much-to be lamented death of the accompliſhed preſident may indeed damp the ſpirit of inveſtigation among the members ; for to conquer difficulties ſo great as they muſt meet with, a portion ſeems to be neceſſary of that enthuſiaſm which accompanied all the purſuits of Sir William Jones ; but his ſucceſſor is a man of great worth and learning, and we truſt will uſe his utmoſt endeavours to have the plan completed of which Sir William gave the outlines.</p><p>5. <hi rend="italic">The American Philoſophical Society,</hi> held at Philadelphia, was formed in January 1769 by the union of two ſocieties which had formerly subſisted in that city. This ſociety extends its attention to geography, mathematics, natural philosophy, and aſtronomy ; medicine and anatomy; natural hiſtory and chemiſtry; trade and commerce ; mechanics and architecture ; husbandry and American improvements. Its officers are a patron, preſident, three vice-preſidents, one treaſurer, four ſecretaries, and three curators, who are annually choſen by ballot. The duty of the preſident, vice-preſidents, treaſurer, and ſecretaries, is the ſame as in other ſocieties. The buſineſs of the curators is to take the charge of all ſpecimens of natural productions, whether of the animal, vegetable, or fossil kingdom ; all models of machines and inſtruments ; and all other matters belonging to the ſociety which ſhall be intruſted to them. The ordinary meetings are held on the firſt and third Fridays of every month from October to May inclusive. This ſociety was incorporated by charter 15th March 1780 ; and has publiſhed three volumes of its Tranſactions, containing many ingenious papers on general literature and the ſciences, as well as reſpecting thoſe ſubjects peculiar to America. It is a delightful proſpect to the philosopher to conſider, that Aſia, Eurppe, and America, though far ſeparated and divided into a variety of political ſtates, are all three combined to promote the cauſe of knowledge and truth.</p><p>6.	<hi rend="italic">A Literary and Philoſophical Society</hi> of conſiderable reputation has been lately eſtabliſhed at Mancheſter, under the direction of two preſidents, four vice-preſi-</p></body></text></TEI>
