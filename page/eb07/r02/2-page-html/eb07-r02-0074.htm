<p><span class="font1">the earliest history of England, and other historical legends, wrote, in 1155, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Roman de Chevalier de Lyon,</span><span class="font1"> probably&nbsp;the same translated under the title of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ywain</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Gawain.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">Lambert li Cors, and Benoit de Saint-Maur, seem both to&nbsp;have been of the clerical order ; and, perhaps, Chretien de&nbsp;Troyes, a most voluminous author of romance, was of the&nbsp;same profession. Indeed, the extreme length of many romances being much greater than any minstrel could undertake to sing at one or even many sittings, may induce us&nbsp;to refer them to men of a more sedentary occupation than&nbsp;those wandering poets. The religious romances were, in&nbsp;all probability, the works of such churchmen as might wish&nbsp;to reconcile an agreeable occupation with their religious&nbsp;profession. All which circumstances must be received as&nbsp;exceptions from the general proposition, that the romances&nbsp;in metre were the composition of the minstrels by whom&nbsp;they were recited or sung, though they must still leave&nbsp;Percy’s proposition to a certain extent unimpeached.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">To explain the history of Romance, it is necessary to digress a little further concerning the condition of the minstrels by whom these compositions were often made, and, generally speaking, preserved and recited. And here, it&nbsp;must be confessed, that the venerable Prelate has, perhaps,&nbsp;suffered his love of antiquity, and his desire to ennoble the&nbsp;productions of the middle ages, a little to overcolour the&nbsp;importance and respectability of the minstrel tribe ; although&nbsp;his opponent Ritson has, on the other hand, seized on all&nbsp;circumstances and inferences which could be adduced to&nbsp;prove the degradation of the minstrel character, without&nbsp;attending to the particulars by which these depreciating&nbsp;circumstances were qualified. In fact, neither of these excellent antiquaries has cast a general or philosophical glance&nbsp;on the necessary condition of a set of men who were by&nbsp;profession the instruments of the pleasure of others during&nbsp;a period of society such as was presented in the middle&nbsp;ages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In a very early period of civilisation, ere the division of tribes had been generally adopted, and while each tribe may&nbsp;be yet considered as one great family, and the nation as an&nbsp;union of such independent tribes, the poetical art, so nearly&nbsp;allied to that of oratory or persuasion, is found to ascertain&nbsp;toits professors a very high rank. Poetsare then the historians&nbsp;and often the priests of the tribe. Their command of language, then in its infancy, excites not merely pleasure, but&nbsp;enthusiasm and admiration. When separated into a distinct&nbsp;class, as was the case with the Celtic bards, and, perhaps,&nbsp;with the skalds of Scandinavia, they rank high in the scale&nbsp;of society, and we not only find kings and nobles listening&nbsp;to them with admiration, but emulous of their art, and desirous to be enrolled among their numbers. Several of the&nbsp;most renowned northern kings and champions valued themselves as much upon their powers of poetry as on their martial exploits ; and of the Welsh princes, the Irish kings,&nbsp;and the Highland chiefs of Scotland, very many practised&nbsp;the arts of poetry and music. Llwarch Hen was a prince of&nbsp;the Cymraig, Brian Boromhe, a harper and a musician, and&nbsp;without resorting to the questionable authenticity of Ossian,&nbsp;several instances of the same kind might be produced in&nbsp;the Highlands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But, in process of time, when the classes of society come to assume their usual gradation with respect to each other,&nbsp;the rank of professional poets is uniformly found to sink&nbsp;gradually in the scale, along with that of all others whose&nbsp;trade it is to contribute mere amusement. The professional poet, like the player or the musician, becomes the&nbsp;companion and soother only of idle and convivial hours ;&nbsp;his presence would be unbecoming on occasions of gravity&nbsp;and importance ; and his art is accounted at best an amusing but useless luxury. Although the intellectual pleasure derived from poetry or from the exhibition of the&nbsp;drama be of a different and much higher class than that</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font1">derived from the accordance of sounds, or from the exhibition of feats of dexterity, still it will be found that the opinions and often the laws of society, while individuals of&nbsp;these classes are cherished and held in the highest estimation, have degraded the professions themselves among its&nbsp;idle, dissolute, and useless appendages. Although it may&nbsp;be accounted ungrateful in mankind thus to reward the&nbsp;instruments of their highest enjoyments, yet some justification is usually to be drawn from the manners of the&nbsp;classes who were thus lowered in public opinion. It must&nbsp;be remembered, that, as professors of this joyous science,&nbsp;as it was called, the minstrels stood in direct opposition to&nbsp;the more severe part of the Catholics, and to the monks in&nbsp;particular, whose vows bound them to practise virtues of&nbsp;the ascetic order, and to look upon every thing as profane&nbsp;which w&gt;as connected with mere worldly pleasure. The&nbsp;manners of the minstrels themselves gave but too much&nbsp;room for clerical censure. They were the usual assistants&nbsp;at scenes, not merely of conviviality, but of license ; and as&nbsp;the companions and encouragers of revelling and excess,&nbsp;they became contemptible in the eyes, not only of the aged&nbsp;and the serious, but of the libertine himself, when his debauch palled on his recollection. The minstrels, no doubt,&nbsp;like their brethren of the stage, sought an apology in the&nbsp;corrupted taste and manners of their audience, with which&nbsp;they were obliged to comply, under the true but melancholy&nbsp;condition that</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">—they who live to please must please to live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But this very necessity, rendered more degrading by their increasing numbers and decreasing reputation, only accelerated the total downfall of their order, and the general discredit and neglect into which they had fallen. The statute&nbsp;of the 39th of Queen Elizabeth, passed at the close of the&nbsp;sixteenth century, ranks those dishonoured sons of song&nbsp;among rogues and vagabonds, and appoints them to be&nbsp;punished as such ; and the occupation, though a vestige of&nbsp;it was long retained in the habits of travelling ballad-singers and musicians, sunk into total neglect and contempt&nbsp;Of this we shall have to speak hereafter ; our business being at present with those romances, which, while still in&nbsp;the zenith of their reputation, were the means by which the&nbsp;minstrels, at least the better and higher class amongst tlιem,&nbsp;recommended themselves to the favour of their noble patrons, and of the audiences whom they addressed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It may be presumed, that, although the class of minstrels, like all who merely depend upon gratifying the public, carried in their very occupation the evils which first infected,&nbsp;and finally altogether depraved their reputation ; yet, in the&nbsp;earlier ages, their duties were more honourably estimated,&nbsp;and some attempts were made to introduce into their motley body the character of a regular establishment, subjected&nbsp;to discipline and subordination. Several individuals, both&nbsp;of France and England, bore the title of king of minstrels,&nbsp;and were invested probably with some authority over the&nbsp;others. The serjeant of minstrels is also mentioned ; and&nbsp;Edward IV. seems to have attempted to form a guild or&nbsp;exclusive corporation of minstrels. John of Gaunt, at an&nbsp;earlier period, established (between jest and earnest, perhaps) a court baron of minstrels, to be held at Tilbury.&nbsp;There is no reason, however, to suppose that the influence&nbsp;of their establishments went far in restraining the licence&nbsp;of a body of artists so unruly as well as numerous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is not, indeed, surprising that individuals, whose talents in the arts of music or of the stage rise to the highest order, should, in a special degree, attain the regard and&nbsp;affection of the powerful, acquire wealth, and rise to consideration ; for, in such professions, very high prizes are&nbsp;assigned only to pre-eminent excellence ; while ordinary or&nbsp;inferior practisers of the same art may be said to draw in&nbsp;the lottery something worse than a mere blank. Garrick, in</span></p>
