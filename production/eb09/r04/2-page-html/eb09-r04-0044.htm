<p><span class="font0">description has already been given (see Poland, vol. xix. p. 298). Paskewitch took Warsaw in 1831. The cholera&nbsp;which was then raging had already carried off Diebitsch&nbsp;and the grand-duke Constantine. Poland was now entirely&nbsp;at the mercy of Nicholas. The constitution which had&nbsp;been granted by Alexander was annulled ; there were to&nbsp;be no more diets ; and for the ancient palatinates, familiar&nbsp;to the historical student, were substituted the governments&nbsp;of Warsaw, Radom, Lublin, Plock, and Modlin. The&nbsp;university of Vilna, rendered celebrated by Mickiewicz&nbsp;and Lelewel, was suppressed. By another treaty with&nbsp;Turkey, that of Unkiar-Skelessi (1833), Russia acquired&nbsp;additional rights to meddle with the internal politics of&nbsp;that country. Soon after the revolution of 1848, the&nbsp;emperor Nicholas, who became even more reactionary in&nbsp;consequence of the disturbed state of Europe, answered&nbsp;the appeal of the emperor Francis Joseph, and sent an&nbsp;army under Paskewitch to suppress the Hungarian revolt.&nbsp;After the capitulation of Gorgei in 1849, the war was at&nbsp;an end, and the Magyars cruelly expiated their attempts&nbsp;to procure constitutional government. In 1853 broke out&nbsp;the Crimean War. The emperor was anxious to distribute&nbsp;the possessions of the “sick man,” but found enemies instead&nbsp;of allies in England and France. The chief events of this&nbsp;memorable struggle were the battles of the Alma, Balaklava,&nbsp;Inkermann, and Tchernaya, and the siege of Sebastopol;&nbsp;this had been skilfully fortified by Todleben, who appears to&nbsp;have been the only man of genius who came to the front on&nbsp;either side during the war. In 1855 the Russians destroyed&nbsp;the southern side of the city, and retreated to the northern.&nbsp;In the same year, on March 14th, died the emperor&nbsp;Nicholas, after a short illness. Finding all his plans&nbsp;frustrated he had grown weary of life, and rashly exposed&nbsp;himself to the severe temperature of the northern spring.&nbsp;He was succeeded by his son Alexander II. (1855-1881),&nbsp;at the age of thirty-seven. One of the first objects of the&nbsp;new czar was to put an end to the war, and the treaty of&nbsp;Paris was signed in 1856, by which Russia consented to&nbsp;keep no vessels of war in the Black Sea, and to give up&nbsp;her protectorate of the Eastern Christians ; the former,&nbsp;it must be added, she has recently recovered. A portion&nbsp;of Russian Bessarabia was also cut off and added to&nbsp;the Danubian principalities, which were shortly to be&nbsp;united under the name of Roumania. This was afterwards&nbsp;given back to Russia by the treaty of Berlin. Sebastopol&nbsp;also has been rebuilt, so that it is difficult to see what&nbsp;the practical results of the Crimean War were, in spite&nbsp;of the vast bloodshed and expenditure of treasure which&nbsp;attended it. The next important measure was the emancipation of the serfs in 1861. This great reform had long&nbsp;been meditated by Nicholas, but he was unable to accomplish it, and left it to be carried out by his son. The&nbsp;landlords, on receiving an indemnity, now released the&nbsp;serfs from their seigniorial rights, and the village commune&nbsp;became the actual property of the serf. This great&nbsp;revolution was not, however, carried out without great&nbsp;difficulty. The Polish insurrection of 1863 has already&nbsp;been described, as well as its fatal effects upon that part of&nbsp;Poland which had been incorporated with Russia. On the&nbsp;other hand Finland has seen her privileges confirmed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Among important foreign events of this reign must be mentioned the capture of Schamyl in 1859 by Prince&nbsp;Bariatinski, and the pacification of the Caucasus ; many of&nbsp;the Circassians, unable to endure the peaceful life of&nbsp;cultivators of the soil under the new regime, migrated to&nbsp;Turkey, where they have formed one of the most turbulent&nbsp;elements of the population. Turkestan also has been&nbsp;gradually subjugated. In 1865 the city of Tashkend was&nbsp;taken, and in 1867 Alexander II. created the government&nbsp;of Turkestan. In 1858 General Muravieff signed a treaty</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">with the Chinese, by which Russia acquired all the left bank of the river Amur. A new port has been created in&nbsp;Eastern Asia (Vladivostok), which promises to be a great&nbsp;centre of trade. In 1877 Russia came to the assistance&nbsp;of the Slavonic Christians against the Turks. After the&nbsp;terrible siege of Plevna, nothing stood between them&nbsp;and the gates of Constantinople. In 1878 the treaty of&nbsp;San Stefano was signed, by which Roumania became&nbsp;independent, Servia was enlarged, and a free Bulgaria,&nbsp;but under Turkish suzerainty, was created. But these&nbsp;arrangements were subsequently modified by the treaty of&nbsp;Berlin. Russia got back the portion of Bessarabia which&nbsp;she had lost, and advanced her Caucasian frontier. The&nbsp;new province of Bulgaria was cut into two, the southern&nbsp;portion being entitled Eastern Roumelia, with a Christian&nbsp;governor, to be appointed by the Porte, and self-government. Austria acquired a protectorate over Bosnia and&nbsp;Herzegovina. The latter part of the reign of Alexander&nbsp;II. was a period of great internal commotion, on account&nbsp;of the spread of Nihilism, and the attempts upon the&nbsp;emperor’s life, which unfortunately were at last successful.&nbsp;In the cities in which his despotic father had walked about&nbsp;fearless, without a single attendant, the mild and amiable&nbsp;Alexander was in daily peril of his life. On April 16,&nbsp;1866, Karakozoff shot at the emperor at St Petersburg;&nbsp;in the following year another attempt was made by a Pole,&nbsp;Berezowski, while Alexander was at Paris on a visit to&nbsp;Napoleon III.; on April 14, 1879, Solovioff shot at him.&nbsp;The same year saw the attempt to blow up the Winter Palace&nbsp;and to wreck the train by which the czar was travelling&nbsp;from Moscow to St Petersburg. A similar conspiracy in&nbsp;1881 (March 13) was successful. Five of the conspirators,&nbsp;including a woman, Sophia Perovskaia, were publicly&nbsp;executed. Thus terminated the reign of Alexander II,&nbsp;which had lasted nearly twenty-six years. He died leaving&nbsp;Russia exhausted by foreign wars and honeycombed by&nbsp;plots. His wife and eldest son Nicholas had predeceased&nbsp;him, the latter at Nice. He was succeeded by his second&nbsp;son Alexander, born in 1845, whose reign has been characterized by conspiracies and constant deportations of&nbsp;suspected persons. It was long before he ventured to&nbsp;be crowned in his ancient capital of Moscow (1883),&nbsp;and the chief event since then has been the disturbed&nbsp;relations with England, which for a time threatened&nbsp;war.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(w.

<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Pakt V.—Russian Literatuke.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To get a clear idea of Russian literature, it will be most convenient for us to divide it into oral and written. The&nbsp;first of these sections includes the interesting </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">bîlinî,</span><span class="font0"> or “ tales of old time,” as the word may be translated, which&nbsp;have come down to us in great numbers, as they have been&nbsp;sung by wandering minstrels all over the country. The&nbsp;scholars who during the last forty years have given their&nbsp;attention to these compositions have made the following&nbsp;division of them into cycles:—(1) that of the older&nbsp;heroes; (2) that of Vladimir, prince of Kieff; (3) that&nbsp;of Novgorod ; (4) that of Moscow ; (5) that of the Cossacks ; (6) that of Peter the Great; (7) the modern&nbsp;period. These poems, if they may be so styled, are not in&nbsp;rhyme ; the ear is satisfied with a certain cadence which&nbsp;is observed throughout. For a long time they were&nbsp;neglected, and the collection of them only began at the&nbsp;commencement of the present century. The style of&nbsp;Russian literature which prevailed from the time of&nbsp;Lomonosoff was wholly based upon the French or pseudo-classical school. It was, therefore, hardly likely that these&nbsp;peasant songs would attract attention. But when the&nbsp;gospel of romanticism was preached and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History</span><span class="font0"> of&nbsp;Karamzin appeared, which presented to the Russians a</span></p>
