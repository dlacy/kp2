Nor was there more than one steam-boat in Scotland for two years afterwards. In 1819, they had increased to 11 ; in 1830, to 61 ; and in 1837, to 109, (tonnage, 13,368), of which 63, or considerably more than the half, belonged to the Clyde.@@<hi rend="superscript">4</hi> The following table shews the rapidly increasing number and tonnage of the steamboats which entered the different ports of Scotland, and cleared out, at different periods, since 1820.</p><table><row><cell>Year.</cell><cell cols="2">Inwards.</cell><cell cols="2">Outwards.</cell></row><row><cell/><cell>Ships.</cell><cell>Tons.</cell><cell>Ships.</cell><cell>Tons.</cell></row><row><cell>1820</cell><cell>9</cell><cell>505</cell><cell/><cell/></row><row><cell>1825</cell><cell>498</cell><cell>57,709</cell><cell>731</cell><cell>72,811</cell></row><row><cell>1830</cell><cell>1886</cell><cell>240,270</cell><cell>1717</cell><cell>212,167</cell></row><row><cell>1837</cell><cell>3340</cell><cell>563,438</cell><cell>2851</cell><cell>483,586</cell></row></table><p>On the subject of the Scottish manufactures our notices, derived from official or other documents, shall be brief, particularly as under the articles <hi rend="smallcaps">Dundee, Glasgow, </hi>&amp;c., we have already given pretty ample information on the different manufactures for which the country is distinguished. The linen manufacture was the earliest, and long regarded as the staple, branch of industry carried on in Scotland. But such were the narrow limits within which it was confined, that, at the Union, in 1707, it was not supposed to exceed 1,500,000 yards a-year. In 1727, aboard of trustees was established for the superintendence and encouragement of the linen manufacture ; and bounties and premiums were given on its production and exportation.</p><p>The regulations as to the inspection and stamping of the linen intended for exportation, by which the trade was much annoyed, were abolished in 1822; and the bounties ceased in the year 1830. The quantity produced for sale in 1728 was 2,000,000 yards; in 1775, 12,000,000 yards ; in 1822, 36,000,000 yards ; and the exports alone, in 1835, exclusive of home consumption, was between 60,000,000 and 70,000,000 yards, worth about L.l,600,000. Dundee and the east of Scotland, including Fifeshire, are the great seats of the manufacture, particularly in Osnaburghs, sail-cloth, and the coarser fabrics; and Dunfermline and the neighbouring towns and villages, the principal seat of damask, diaper, and the finer fabrics. Previously to 1791, all the yarn used in the manufacture was spun upon the common hand-wheel ; but the spinning by machinery began at that time to be introduced ; and such has been the facility of production consequent on the erection of flax-mills, that the cost of the yarn, including the raw material, is now less than the spinning amounted to thirty years ago. The number of flax, hemp, and tow factories was, in 1837, 175, employing no fewer than 15,462 workers, of whom 4231 were between thirteen and eighteen years of age, and 163 between nine and thirteen.</p><p>Lanarkshire, which includes the city of Glasgow, and also the contiguous county of Renfrew, has always been the principal seat of the cotton manufacture. Some of the fabrics made at Glasgow and Paisley are of almost unrivalled beauty and fineness. The first steam-engine for the spinning of cotton erected in Scotland, was constructed so late as 1792. The number of cotton factories in 1837 was 177, all those of considerable size being situated at Glasgow, and in the neighbouring districts, comprehending twenty or thirty miles around Glasgow, excepting five in Aberdeenshire, two in Perthshire, one in Dumfries-shire, and one at Gatehouse, in Kirkcudbrightshire. But, with no exception, all these country mills are connected with Glasgow houses, or the Glasgow trade, at least so far as the raw material is concerned. The number of hands from eight years of age upwards employed in the Scottish cotton manufacture, is 34,418, of whom 13,567 are between thirteen and eighteen years of age, and 1096 between nine and thirteen.</p><p>The woollen manufacture of Scotland has never been considerable. It was formerly the custom for the occupiers of land in this country to spin the whole of their wool with the hand in their own houses, and to send the yarn to the village weaver to be woven into a species of coarse cloth called <hi rend="italic">plaiding ;</hi> but this mode, which is indicative of a rude and backward state of society, is now entirely abandoned, having been superseded by machinery. Factories for the making of fine cloth have been established in Aberdeenshire, and in some other counties ; but comparatively coarse fabrics still continue to be the staple article of Scotch manufacture. The number of woollen or worsted factories in 1837 was 104, situated chiefly at Aberdeen, in Clackmannanshire, at Hawick, Galashiels, and Jedburgh, Roxburghshire, and in the counties of Stirling, Argyle, and Inverness. Hawick has almost entirely withdrawn from this species of manufacture, and devotes its energies principally to the production of woollen hose, of which it annually produces about 500,000 pairs, with blankets, and flannels. The towns of Stirling and Bannockburn are almost the exclusive seat of tartans. Kilmarnock is chiefly celebrated for its manufacture of carpets and shawls, besides large numbers of night-caps, bonnets, and foraging caps for the army. Bonnets in Scotland, however, have been pretty generally superseded by hats. The woollen factories, in 1837, contained 4339 workers, of whom 1856 were between thirteen and eighteen years of age, and 156 between nine and thirteen.</p><p><hi rend="superscript">@@@,</hi> Babbage’s Economy of Manufactures, p. 5.	</p><p>@@@’ Chalmers’s Historical View, p. 387.</p><p><hi rend="superscript">@@@3</hi>	Chalmers, <hi rend="italic">ut supra,</hi> p. 390 ; Macpherson's Annale of Commerce, anno 1760 ; M'Culloch's Statistical Account, vol. xi. sect. <hi rend="italic">Commeret.</hi></p><p><hi rend="superscript">@@@4</hi>	The Steam Engine, by Hugo Reid, Edinburgh, 1838, p. 160.</p></body></text></TEI>
