It is only from that epoch we can get any information concerning the language of the old Scandinavians, which seems by that time not only to have spread over Denmark and great parts of southern and middle Sweden and of (southern) Norway, but also to have reached Finland (at least Nyland) and Esthonia. In spite of its extension over this considerable geographical area, the language appears to have been fairly homogeneous throughout the whole territory. Consequently, it may be regarded as a uniform language, the mother of the younger Scandinavian tongues, and accordingly has been named the primitive Scandinavian <hi rend="italic">(urnordisk)</hi> language. The oldest sources of our knowledge of this tongue are the words which were borrowed during the first centuries of the Christian era (some of them perhaps even earlier) by the Lapps from the inhabitants of central Sweden and Norway, and by the Finns from their neighbours in Finland and Esthonia, and which have been preserved in Finnish and Lappish down to our own days.<note anchored="true" n="9" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>W.

These words, with those mentioned by contemporary Roman and Greek authors, are the oldest existing traces of any Germanic language. Wrested from their context, however, they throw but little light on the nature of the original northern tongue. But a series of linguistic monuments have come down to us dating from the end of the so-called early Iron Age (about 450 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.),—</hi> the knowledge and the use of the oldest runic alphabet (with twenty-four characters) having at that period been propagated among the Scandinavians by the southern Germanic tribes. In fact we still possess, preserved down to our own times, primitive northern runic inscriptions, the oldest upon the utensils found at <hi rend="italic">Thorsbjerg,</hi> dating back to about 300 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi><note anchored="true" n="10" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>O.

These runic inscriptions are for the most part found on stone-monuments (sometimes on rocks) and bracteates (gold coins stamped on one side and used for ornaments), as well as on metallic and wooden utensils, weapons, and ornaments.<note anchored="true" n="11" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See the plates in G.

The longest one, the stone-monument of <hi rend="italic">Tune,</hi> in south-eastern Norway, contains only sixteen words. Their language is somewhat later in character than that of the oldest words borrowed by the Lapps and Finns: accented <hi rend="italic">ê</hi>, for example, is already changed into <hi rend="italic">a (cf. mariR —</hi> Goth, <hi rend="italic">mêrs,</hi> renowned ; but the Finn. borrowed word <hi rend="italic">nêkla =</hi> Goth. <hi rend="italic">nêpla,</hi> needle), and the voiced <hi rend="italic">s</hi> into a kind of <hi rend="italic">r (cf. dagaR</hi> = Goth, <hi rend="italic">dags,</hi><pb facs="encyclopediabrit21newyrich_raw_0389.jp2" xml:id="eb09-21-s01-0367"/>
day ; but Finn. <hi rend="italic">armas</hi> = Goth, <hi rend="italic">arms,</hi> poor). On the other hand, in all essential matters it is much earlier in character than the language of contemporary Gothic manuscripts, and no doubt approaches more nearly than any Germanic idiom the primitive form of the Germanic tongue. For the sake of comparison, we give a Gothic translation of one of the oldest of the primitive Scandinavian inscriptions, that on the golden horn of <hi rend="italic">Gallehus,</hi> found on the Danish- German frontier, and dating from about 400 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d. :—</hi></p><p>Scand.: <hi rend="smallcaps">ek hlewagasti</hi> <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> R</hi> <hi rend="smallcaps">holtinga</hi> <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> R</hi> <hi rend="smallcaps">. horna. tawido ;</hi> Goth.: <hi rend="italic">ik hliugasts. hultiggs. haurn. tawida;</hi></p><p>Engl.: I, HlewagastiR, son of Holta, made the horn ; as well as the inscription on the stone-monument of <hi rend="italic">Järsbärg</hi> in western Sweden, which is at least a hundred years later:—</p><p>Scand. : UBA. <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> R</hi> HITE.

Bugge’s ingenious investigations, who in 1865 satisfactorily suc- ceeded in deciphering the inscription of the golden horn, and by this means gained a fixed starting-point for further researches. A short review of their most important results is given by F. Burg, <hi rend="italic">Die alteren Nordischen Runeninschriften,</hi> 1885.</p></note> these primitive Scandinavian inscriptions are nevertheless sufficient to enable us to determine with some certainty the relation which the language in which they are written bears to other languages. Thus it is proved that it belongs to the Germanic family of the Indo-European stock of languages, of which it constitutes an independent and individual branch. Its nearest relation being the Gothic, these two branches are sometimes taken together under the general denomination <hi rend="italic">Eastern Germanic,</hi> as opposed to the other Germanic idioms (German, English, Dutch, &amp;c.), which are then called <hi rend="italic">Western Germanic.</hi> The most essential point of correspondence between the Gothic and Scandinavian branches is the insertion in certain cases of <hi rend="italic">gg</hi> before <hi rend="italic">w</hi> and <hi rend="italic">j (ggj</hi> in Gothic was changed into <hi rend="italic">ddj),</hi> as in gen. plur. O. H. G. <hi rend="italic">zweiio,</hi> O. Engl, <hi rend="italic">tivega</hi> (two), compared with O. Icel., 0. Norw. <hi rend="italic">tveggja,</hi> O. Sw., O. Dan. <hi rend="italic">tviggjse,</hi> Goth, <hi rend="italic">twaddje;</hi> and, still, in Germ, <hi rend="italic">treu,</hi> Engl, <hi rend="italic">true,</hi> compared with Sw., Norw., Dan. <hi rend="italic">trygg,</hi> Icel. <hi rend="italic">tryggr,</hi> Goth, <hi rend="italic">triggws.</hi> However, even in the primitive Scandinavian age the difference between Gothic and Scandinavian is more clearly marked than the resemblance ; thus, for example—just to hint only at some of the oldest and most essential differences—Goth. nom. sing, ending in -a corresponds to primitive Scandinavian <hi rend="smallcaps">-ar,</hi> <hi rend="italic">-iR</hi> (as Goth, <hi rend="italic">dags,</hi> day, <hi rend="italic">gasts,</hi> guest = Scand. <hi rend="italic">dagaR, gastiR) ·,</hi> Goth. gen. sing, in <hi rend="italic">-is</hi> to Scand. <hi rend="italic">-as</hi> (as Goth, <hi rend="italic">dagis,</hi> day’s = Scand. <hi rend="italic">dagas);</hi> Goth. dat. sing, in <hi rend="italic">-a</hi> to Scand. <hi rend="italic">-e</hi> (as Goth. <hi rend="italic">kaurna,</hi> corn = Scand. <hi rend="italic">kume)</hi>; Goth. 1st pers. sing. pret. in <hi rend="italic">-da</hi> to Scand. <hi rend="italic">-do</hi> (as Goth, <hi rend="italic">taurida,</hi> did = Scand. <hi rend="italic">tawido).</hi></p><p>As early as the beginning of the so-called later Iron Age (about 700 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> the primitive Scandinavian language had undergone a considerable transformation, as is proved for example by the remarkable runic stone at <hi rend="italic">Istaby</hi> in the south of Sweden, with the inscription—</p><p>AFATR HARIWULAFA <hi rend="smallcaps">HAPUWULAFR</hi> HAERUWULAFIR <hi rend="smallcaps">waRAIT</hi> RUNA.R pAIA.R ;</p><p>Engl.: In memory of HariwulfR, HaJrawulfR, son of HeruwulfK, wrote these runes.</p><p>Here, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> we find nom. sing. in <hi rend="smallcaps">-ar</hi> changed into <hi rend="italic">-r (cf. hapuwulafs</hi> with <hi rend="italic">holtingas</hi> on the golden horn), and the plural ending <hi rend="smallcaps">-or</hi> into <hi rend="smallcaps">-</hi> <hi rend="italic">a</hi> <hi rend="smallcaps">r</hi> <hi rend="italic">(cf. runas</hi> with <hi rend="italic">runos</hi> on the Järsbärg-stone). At the beginning of the so-called Viking Period (about 800 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> the Scandinavian language seems to have undergone an extraordinarily rapid development, which in a comparatively short time almost completely</p><p>transformed its character. This change is especially noticeable in the dropping of unaccented vowels, and in the introduction of a certain vowel harmony of different kinds (“ Umlaut”, vowel changes, caused by a following <hi rend="italic">i (j)</hi> or <hi rend="italic">u</hi> (<hi rend="italic">w</hi>), as <hi rend="italic">kvoeði</hi> for <hi rend="italic">kwáði,</hi> poem, and “ Brechung”, as <hi rend="italic">healpa</hi> instead of <hi rend="italic">helpa,</hi> to help), different assimilations of consonants (as <hi rend="italic">ll, nn</hi> for <hi rend="italic">l</hi> p <hi rend="smallcaps">,</hi> <hi rend="italic">np; ll, nn, rr,</hi> and ss for <hi rend="italic">ls, ns, rs,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">sr),</hi> dropping of <hi rend="italic">w</hi> before <hi rend="italic">o</hi> and <hi rend="italic">u</hi> (as <hi rend="italic">orið, ulfr</hi> for <hi rend="italic">worð</hi> word, <hi rend="italic">wulfs,</hi> wolf), simplified inflexion of the verbs, a new passive formed by means of affixing the reflexive pronoun <hi rend="italic">sik</hi> to the active form (as <hi rend="italic">kalla-sk,</hi> to call one’s self, to be called), &amp;c.</p><p>At this epoch, therefore, the primitive Scandinavian language must be considered as no longer existing. The next two centuries form a period of transition as regards the language as well as the alphabet which it employed. We possess some inscriptions belonging to this period in which the old runic alphabet of twenty-four characters is still used, and the language of which closely resembles that of the primitive Scandinavian monuments, as, for example, those on the stones of <hi rend="italic">Stentoften</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Björketorp,</hi> both from southern Sweden, probably dating from the 10th century, and being the longest inscriptions yet found with the old runic alphabet. On the other hand, inscriptions have come down to us dating from about the middle of the 9th century, in which the later and exclusively Scandinavian alphabet of sixteen characters has almost completely superseded the earlier alphabet, from which it was developed, 'while the language not only differs widely from the original Scandinavian, but also exhibits dialectical peculiarities suggesting the existence of a Danish- Swedish language as opposed to Norwegian, as the form <hi rend="italic">ruulf</hi> on the stone at <hi rend="italic">Flemlöse</hi> in Denmark, which in a Norwegian inscription would have been written <hi rend="italic">hruulf</hi> corresponding to <hi rend="italic">Hrolf</hi> in Old Norwegian literature. These differences, however, are unimportant, and the Scandinavians still considered their language as one and the same throughout Scandinavia, and named it <hi rend="italic">Donsk tunga,</hi> Danish tongue. But when Iceland was colonized at the end of the 9th and the beginning of the 10th century, chiefly from western Norway, a separate (western) Norwegian dialect gradually sprang up, at first of course only differing slightly from the mother-tongue. It was not until the introduction of Christianity (about 1000 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> that the language was so far differentiated as to enable us to distinguish, in runic inscriptions and in the literature which was then arising, four different dialects, which have ever since existed as the four literary languages—Icelandic, Norwegian, Swedish, and Danish. Of these the latter two, often comprehended within the name of <hi rend="italic">Eastern Scandinavian,</hi> as well as the former two, <hi rend="italic">Western Scandinavian,</hi> or, to use the Old Scandinavians’ own name, <hi rend="italic">Norrϕnt mál,</hi> Northern tongue, are very nearly related to each other. The most important differences between the two branches, as seen in the oldest preserved documents, are the following:—(1) In E. Scand. far fewer cases of “ Umlaut,” as <hi rend="italic">vári,</hi> W. Scand. <hi rend="italic">vaeri,</hi> were <hi rend="italic">; land,</hi> W. Scand. <hi rend="italic">lond</hi> (from <hi rend="italic">landu),</hi> lands; (2) E. Scand. “Brechung” of <hi rend="italic">i</hi> into <hi rend="italic">iu</hi> (or to) before <hi rend="italic">ng(w), nk(w),</hi> as <hi rend="italic">siungse,</hi> W. Scand. <hi rend="italic">syngva</hi> (from <hi rend="italic">singwa),</hi> to sing; (3) in E. Scand. <hi rend="italic">mp, nk, nt</hi> are in many cases not assimilated into <hi rend="italic">pp, kk, tt,</hi> as <hi rend="italic">krumpen,</hi> W. Scand. <hi rend="italic">kroppenn,</hi> shrunken ; a <hi rend="italic">enkiae,</hi> W. Scand. <hi rend="italic">ekkja,</hi> widow; <hi rend="italic">bant,</hi> W. Scand. <hi rend="italic">bait,</hi> he bound; (4) in E. Scand. the dative of the definite plural ends in <hi rend="italic">-omen</hi> instead of W. Scand. <hi rend="italic">-onom,</hi> as in <hi rend="italic">handomen, hondonom,</hi> (to) the hands; (5) in E. Scand. the simplification of the verbal inflexional endings is far further advanced, and the passive ends in -s for <hi rend="italic">-sk,</hi> as in <hi rend="italic">kallaes,</hi> W. Scand. <hi rend="italic">kallask,</hi> to be called In several of these points, and indeed generally speaking, the Western Scandinavian languages have preserved the more primitive forms, as may be seen in the<pb facs="encyclopediabrit21newyrich_raw_0390.jp2" xml:id="eb09-21-s01-0368"/>
oldest Eastern Scandinavian runic inscriptions, dating from a period before the beginning of the literature, as well as in many modern Eastern Scandinavian dialects. For, having regard to the Scandinavian dialects generally, we must adopt quite a different classification from that indicated by the dialects which are represented in the literature. We now pass on to review the latter and their history.</p><p>I. <hi rend="smallcaps">Icelandic.</hi> —In ancient times Icelandic was by far the most important of the Scandinavian languages, in form as well as in literature. To avoid ambiguity, the language before the Reformation (about 1530-40) is often called old Icelandic.</p><p>1. <hi rend="italic">Old Icelandic</hi> was spoken not only in Iceland, but also in Greenland, where Icelandic colonists lived for a lengthened period (983- about 1400).

A small fragment (Cod. AM. 237, fob) of a <hi rend="italic">Book of Homilies</hi> (of which a short specimen is given below) is considered the oldest of all. About contemporary with this is the oldest part of an inventory entitled <hi rend="italic">Reykjaholts máldage.</hi> From about 1200 we possess a fragment (Cod.

Holm. 15, 4to), which from a philological point of view is of the greatest importance, chiefly on account of its very accurate orthography, which is especially noticeable in the indication of quantity; from the early part of the same century comes the fragment (Cod. AM. 325, 2, 4to) entitled <hi rend="italic">Agrip</hi> (“abridgment” of the history of Norway), probably a copy of a Norwegian original, also orthographically important. Among later manuscripts we may mention, as philologically interesting, the <hi rend="italic">Annales Regii</hi> (Cod. Reg. 2087) from the beginning of the 14th century, orthographically of great value; the rich manuscript of miscellanies, <hi rend="italic">Hauksbók</hi> (Codd. AM. 371, 544, 675, 4to), a great part of which is written with Haukr Erlendsson’s (+1334) own hand; and, above all, three short essays, in which some Icelanders have tried to write a grammatical and orthographical treatise on their own mother-tongue, all three appearing as an appendix to the manuscripts of the <hi rend="italic">Prose Edda.</hi> The oldest and most important of these essays (preserved in the Cod. Worm, from about 1330) is by an unknown author of about 1150, and is probably intended to be a continuation of a lost work of the first grammarian of Iceland, Póroddr Rúnameistari (who flourished at the beginning of the 12th century); the second (the oldest known manuscript of which is preserved in the Cod. Ups., c. 1290) is perhaps the work of the famous Snorri Sturloson (+1241); the third (the oldest manuscript in Cod. AM. 748, 4to, of the beginning of the 14th century) is by Snorri’s nephew Ólafr Hvítaskáld (+1259), and is no doubt based partly upon pórodd’s work above mentioned, partly and chiefly upon Priscian and Donatus.<note anchored="true" n="17" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A short review of the most important old Icelandic manuscripts (and their editions), classed according to subjects, is given by O.

In spite of the late date of the manuscripts, the metrical form has been the means of preserving a good deal of the ancient language. But, as already remarked, during the 10th and 11th centuries this dialect differs but little from Norwegian, though in the 12th this is no longer the case.</p><p>We may here contrast a specimen of the above-mentioned oldest Icelandic manuscript (from the end of the 12th century) with an almost contemporary Norwegian one (Cod. AM. 619; see below):—</p><table> <row> <cell><hi rend="italic">Icel. —</hi> En pat es vitanda, at allt ma andlega merkiasc oc fyllasc i oss, pat es til kirkio bunings epa pionosto parf at haua, cf ver liuom sva hreinlega at ver sem verper at callasc gops mustere.</cell> <cell><hi rend="italic">Norw.—</hi> En pat er vitanda, at allt ma andlega merkiasc oc fyllasc i os, pat er til kirkiu bunings eða til pionasto parf at hafa, ef ver lifum sva rseinlega, at ver sein voröir at kallasc guös mysteri.</cell> <cell><hi rend="italic">Engl. —</hi> And that is to be known that all that is needed for the decoration of the church or the service may, spiritually, be found and imitated within us, if we live so cleanly that we are worthy to be called God’s temple.</cell> </row> </table><p>Apart from the fact that the language is, generally speaking, archaic, we find in the Icelandic text two of the oldest and most essential characteristics of Icelandic as opposed to Norwegian, viz., the more complete vowel assimilation (pionosto, <hi rend="italic">tyonasto ; cf.</hi> also, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> Icel. <hi rend="italic">kollokom,</hi> Norw. <hi rend="italic">kallaðum,</hi> we called) and the retention of initial <hi rend="italic">h</hi> before <hi rend="italic">r (hreinlcga, rasinlega), I,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">n.</hi> other differences, some of which occur at this period, others a little later, are— in Icel. lengthening of <hi rend="italic">a, o, u</hi> before <hi rend="italic">If, Ig, Ik, Im,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ip</hi> (as Icel. <hi rend="italic">halfr,</hi> Norw. and oldest Icel. <hi rend="italic">halfr,</hi> half); later still, also of <hi rend="italic">a, i,</hi> ii, and <hi rend="italic">y</hi> before <hi rend="italic">ng</hi> and <hi rend="italic">nk</hi>; Icel. <hi rend="italic">di</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ey</hi> for older and (ϕy (as in Icel. <hi rend="italic">daema, heyra,</hi> Norw. and oldest Icel. <hi rend="italic">dϕma,</hi> to deem, <hi rend="italic">hϕyra,</hi> to hear); Icel. termination of 2nd plur. of verbs in -8 (p) or <hi rend="italic">-t,</hi> but Norw. often in <hi rend="italic">-r</hi> (as Icel. <hi rend="italic">taktið, -t,</hi> Norw. <hi rend="italic">takir,</hi> you take). These points may be sufficient to characterize the language of the earlier ‘classical” period of Icelandic (about 1190-1350). At the middle of the 13th century the written language undergoes material changes, owing in a great measure, no doubt, to the powerful influence of Snorri Sturloson. Thus in unaccented syllables <hi rend="italic">i</hi> now appears for older <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">u</hi> (at first only when followed by one or more consonants belonging to the same syllable) for <hi rend="italic">o</hi>; the passive ends in <hi rend="italic">-z</hi> for <hi rend="italic">-sk.</hi> The other differences from Norwegian, mentioned above as occurring later, are now completely established. With the beginning of the 14th century there appear several new linguistic phenomena : a <hi rend="italic">u</hi> is inserted between final <hi rend="italic">r</hi> and a preceding consonant (as in <hi rend="italic">ríkur,</hi> mighty); <hi rend="italic">o</hi> (pronounced as an open <hi rend="italic">o)</hi> passes into <hi rend="italic">ö</hi> (the character <hi rend="italic">ö</hi> was not introduced till the 16th century), or before <hi rend="italic">ng, nk</hi> into <hi rend="italic">au</hi> (as <hi rend="italic">long, fioll,</hi> pronounced <hi rend="italic">laung, fiöll)</hi>; c before <hi rend="italic">ng, nk</hi> passes into <hi rend="italic">ei</hi>; a little later <hi rend="italic">e</hi> passes into <hi rend="italic">ie,</hi> and the passive changes its termination from -z, oldest <hi rend="italic">-sk,</hi> into <hi rend="italic">-zt</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">-zst)</hi> (as in <hi rend="italic">kallazt,</hi> to be called). The post-classical period of old Icelandic (1350-1530), which is, from a literary point of view, of but little importance, already shows marked differences that are characteristic of Modern Icelandic ; as early as the 15th century we find <hi rend="italic">ddl</hi> for <hi rend="italic">ll</hi> and <hi rend="italic">rl</hi> (as <hi rend="italic">falla,</hi> pronounced <hi rend="italic">faddla,</hi> to fall), <hi rend="italic">ddn</hi> for <hi rend="italic">nn</hi> and <hi rend="italic">rn</hi> (as <hi rend="italic">horn,</hi> pron. <hi rend="italic">hoddn,</hi> horn); about the year 1500 <hi rend="italic">ve</hi> after <hi rend="italic">h</hi> passes into <hi rend="italic">vo,</hi> in other positions to <hi rend="italic">vo</hi> (as <hi rend="italic">hvelpr,</hi> pron. <hi rend="italic">xvolpur,</hi> whelp; <hi rend="italic">kvern,</hi> pron. <hi rend="italic">kvöm,</hi> mill), etc.</p><p>Although dialectical differences are not altogether wanting, they do not occur to any great extent in the Old Icelandic literary language. Thus, in some manuscripts we find <hi rend="italic">ft</hi> replaced by <hi rend="italic">fst (oft, ofst,</hi> often); in manuscripts from the western part of the island there appears in the 13th and 14th centuries a tendency to change <hi rend="italic">If, rf</hi> into <hi rend="italic">lb, rb (tolf, tolb,</hi> twelve ; <hi rend="italic">porf, porb,</hi> want), &amp;c. To what extent the language of Greenland differed from that of Iceland we cannot judge from the few runic monuments which have come down to us from that colony.</p><p>Apart from the comparatively inconsiderable attempts at a grammatical treatment of old Icelandic in the Middle Ages which we have mentioned above, grammar as a science can only be said to have commenced in the 17 th century. The first grammar, written by the Icelander Runolphus Jonas (+1654), dates from 1651. His contemporary and compatriot Gudmund Andreae (+1654) compiled the first dictionary, which was not, however, edited till 1683 (by the Dane Petrus Resenius, +1688). The first scholars who studied old Icelandic systematically were H. K. Rask (1787-1832), whose works<note anchored="true" n="18" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">E.g., Veiledning til det Islandske sprog,</hi> 1811 ; in a new, much Improved Swedish edition, <hi rend="italic">Anvisning til Isländskan,</hi> 1818.</p></note> laid the foundation to our knowledge of the language, and his great contemporary Jac. Grimm, in whose <hi rend="italic">Deutsche Grammatik</hi> (1819 <hi rend="italic">sq.)</hi> particular attention is paid to Icelandic. Those who since the time of Rask and Grimm have principally deserved well of Icelandic grammar are—the ingenious and learned Norwegian P. A.

Although, on account of the exceedingly conservative tendency of Icelandic orthography, the language of Modern Icelandic literature still seems to be almost identical with the language of the 17th century, it has in reality undergone a constant and active development, and, phonetically regarded, has changed considerably. Indeed, energetic efforts to bring about an orthography more in accordance with phonetics were made during the years 1835-47 by the magazine entitled <hi rend="italic">Fjölnir,</hi> where we find such authors as Jonas Hallgrimsson and Konr. Gíslason ; but these attempts proved abortive. Of more remarkable etymological changes in Modern Icelandic we may note the following :—already about the year 1550 the passive termination <hi rend="italic">-zt (-zst)</hi> passes into the till then very rare termination <hi rend="italic">-st</hi> (as in <hi rend="italic">kallast,</hi> to be called); <hi rend="italic">y, y,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ey</hi> at the beginning of the 17th century coincided with <hi rend="italic">i, í,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">d</hi>; the long vowels <hi rend="italic">d, w,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ó</hi> have passed into the diphthongs <hi rend="italic">au</hi> (at least about 1650), <hi rend="italic">ai</hi> (about 1700), <hi rend="italic">ou</hi> (as <hi rend="italic">mál,</hi> language, <hi rend="italic">mœla,</hi> to speak, <hi rend="italic">stóll,</hi> chair); <hi rend="italic">g</hi> before <hi rend="italic">i, j</hi> is changed into <hi rend="italic">dj</hi> (after a consonant) or <hi rend="italic">j</hi> (after a vowel),— <hi rend="italic">e.g., liggia,</hi> to lie, <hi rend="italic">eigi,</hi> not; in certain other cases <hi rend="italic">g</hi> has passed into <hi rend="italic">gw</hi> or <hi rend="italic">w,—e.g., lágur,</hi> low, <hi rend="italic">ljúga,</hi> to lie; initial <hi rend="italic">g</hi> before <hi rend="italic">n</hi> is silent,— <hi rend="italic">e.g., (g)naga,</hi> to gnaw; has passed into <hi rend="italic">hn,— e.g., knútr,</hi> knot; <hi rend="italic">ps, pt</hi> into <hi rend="italic">fs, ft; bb, dd, gg</hi> are pronounced as <hi rend="italic">bp, dt, gk,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ll, rl, nn, rn</hi> now in most positions (not, however, before <hi rend="italic">d, t,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">s,</hi> and in abbreviated names) as <hi rend="italic">dtl, dtn,—</hi> as <hi rend="italic">j'jail,</hi> mountain, <hi rend="italic">bjöm,</hi> bear; <hi rend="italic">f</hi> before <hi rend="italic">n</hi> is now pronounced as <hi rend="italic">bp,—</hi> as <hi rend="italic">hrafn,</hi> raven, &amp;c. Both in vocabulary and syntax we find early, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in the lawbook <hi rend="italic">Jönsbök,</hi> printed in 1578(-80), Danish exercis- ing an important influence, as might be expected from political circumstances. In the 18th century, however, we meet with purist tendencies. As one of the leading men of this century may be mentioned the poet Eggert Ólafsson (+1768), whose poems were not printed till 1832. Worthy of mention in the history of Modern Icelandic language are the learned societies which appeared in the same century, of which the first, under the name of “ Hið osynilega,” was established in 1760. At this time archaic tendencies, going back to the Old Icelandic of the 13th and 14th centuries, were continually gaining ground. In our century the following have won especial renown in Icelandic literature:— Bjarne Porarensen (+1841), Iceland’s greatest lyric poet, and Jonas Hallgrimsson (+ 1845), perhaps its most prominent prose-author in modern times.<note anchored="true" n="28" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See R. Arpi, “Islands yngre literatur och sprak” <hi rend="italic">(Sprakvetenskapliga sdll- skapets Torhandlingar,</hi> 1883-85).</p></note></p><p>The dialectical differences in Modern Icelandic are comparatively trifling and chiefly phonetic. The Westland dialect has, for example, preserved the old Icelandic long <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> while the other dialects have changed it to the diphthong <hi rend="italic">au</hi>; in the Northland dialect initial <hi rend="italic">kn</hi> is preserved, in the others changed into <hi rend="italic">hn</hi>; in the northern and western parts of the island old Icelandic <hi rend="italic">hv</hi> appears as <hi rend="italic">kv,</hi> in a part of south-eastern Iceland as <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> in the other dialects as <hi rend="italic">xw,—e.g., hvelpr,</hi> whelp. As a matter of curiosity it may be noted that on the western and eastern coasts traces are found of a French-Icelandic language, which arose from the long sojourn of French fishermen there.</p><p>Owing to the exclusive interest taken in the ancient language, but little attention is given even now to the grammatical treatment of Modern Icelandic. Some notices of the language of the 17th century may be obtained from the above-mentioned grammar of Runolphus Jonas (1651), and for the language of the 18th from Rask’s grammatical works. For the language of our own time there is hardly anything to refer to but N. Friöriks- son’s works, <hi rend="italic">Islenzk mdlmyndalfjsing,</hi> 1861, and <hi rend="italic">Skyring hinna almennu malfroeðislegu hugmynda,</hi> 1864, which, however, are not especially devoted to the modern state of philology; compare also B. Magnusson Ölsen’s valuable paper “Zur neuisländischen Grammatik” <hi rend="italic">(Germania,</hi> xxvii., 1882).<note anchored="true" n="29" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Notices of the Modern Icelandic pronunciation are also to be found in H. Sweet’s <hi rend="italic">Handbook of Phonetics,</hi> 1877, Chr. Vidsteen’s <hi rend="italic">Oplysninger om Bygde- maalene i Hardanger,</hi> 1885, and R. Arpi’s above-quoted paper.</p></note> A dictionary of merit was that of Björn Halldorsen (+1794), edited in 1814 by Rask. Cleasby-Vigfusson’s dictionary mentioned above also pays some attention to the modern language. A really convenient Modern Icelandic dictionary is still wanting, the desideratum being only partly supplied by K. Gíslason’s excellent Danish-Icelandic <hi rend="italic">Dönsk orðabök med tslenzkum pyðingum,</hi> 1851.</p><p>II. <hi rend="smallcaps">Norwegian or Norse.</hi> —The <hi rend="italic">Old Norwegian</hi> language (till the Reformation) was not, like the modern language, confined to Norway and the Faroes, but was, as already stated, for some time</p><p>spoken in parts of Ireland and the north of Scotland, the Isle of Man, the Hebrides, Shetland, and Orkney (in the last two groups of islands it continued to survive down to modern times), and also in certain parts of western Sweden as at present defined (Boliuslan, Sarna in Dalarna, Jamtland, and Harjedalen).</p><p>Our knowledge of it is due only in a small measure to runic inscriptions,<note anchored="true" n="30" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For these see especially Nicolaysen, <hi rend="italic">Norske fornlevninger,</hi> 1862-66.</p></note> for these are comparatively few in number (a little more than one hundred) and of trifling importance from a philological point of view, especially as they almost wholly belong to the period between 1050 and 1350,<note anchored="true" n="31" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The oldest are those on the Valdby-(Laiwik) and Strand-(Aafjord) stones, both from pagan times.

The whole literature preserved is written in the Latin alphabet. The earliest manuscripts are not much later than the oldest Old Icelandic ones, and of the greatest interest. On the whole, however, the earliest Norwegian literature is in quality as well as in quantity incomparably inferior to the Icelandic. It amounts merely to about a score of different works, and of these but few are of any literary value. A small fragment (Cod. AM. 655, 4to, Fragm. ix., A, <hi rend="smallcaps">b, c),</hi> a collection of legends, no doubt written a little before 1200, is regarded as the earliest extant manuscript. From the very beginning of the 13th century we have the <hi rend="italic">Norwegian Book of Homilies</hi> (Cod. AM. 619, 4to) and several fragments of law-books (the older <hi rend="italic">Gulapingslaw</hi> and the older <hi rend="italic">Eiðsivakingslaw).</hi> The chief manuscript (Cod. AM. 243B., fol.) of the principal work in Old Norwegian literature, the <hi rend="italic">Speculum Regale,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Konungsskuggtfa,</hi> (“Mirror for Kings”), is a little later. Of still later manuscripts the so-called legendary <hi rend="italic">Olafssaga</hi> (Cod. Delag. 8, fol.), from about 1250, deserves mention. The masses of charters which—occurring throughout the whole Middle Age of Norway<note anchored="true" n="32" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>On the old Norwegian manuscripts see the works cited in notes 4, 5, page 368; for the literature hitherto edited see note 1, page 368.</p></note> from the beginning of the 13th century—afford much information, especially concerning the dialectical differences of the language, are likewise of great philological importance.</p><p>As in Old Icelandic so in old Norwegian we do not find the most primitive forms in the oldest MSS. that have come down to us; for that purpose we must recur to somewhat (later ones, containing old poems from times as remote as the days of Brage Boddason (the beginning of the 8th century) and pjoðolfr of Hvin (end of the same century). It has already been stated that the language at this epoch differed so little from other Scandinavian dialects that it could scarcely yet be called by a distinctive name, and also that, as Icelandic separated itself from the Norwegian mother-tongue (about 900), the difference between the two languages was at first infinitely small—as far, of course, as the literary language is concerned. From the 13th century, however, they exhibit more marked differences ; for, while Icelandic develops to a great extent independently, Norwegian, owing to geographical and political circumstances, is considerably influenced by the Eastern Scandinavian languages. The most important differences between Icelandic and Norwegian at the epoch of the oldest MSS. (about 1200) have already been noted. The tendency in Norwegian to retain the use of the so-called u-Umlaut has already been mentioned. On the other hand, there appears in Norwegian in the 13th century another kind of vowel-assimilation, almost unknown to Icelandic, the vowel in terminations being in some degree influenced by the vowel of the preceding syllable. Thus, for instance, we find in some manuscripts (as the above-mentioned legendary <hi rend="italic">Olafssaga)</hi> that the vowels <hi rend="italic">e, o</hi> and long <hi rend="italic">a, se,</hi> 0 are followed in terminations by <hi rend="italic">e, o ; i, u, y,</hi> and short <hi rend="italic">a, se,</hi> 0, on the other hand, by <hi rend="italic">i, u,—</hi> as in <hi rend="italic">b finer,</hi> prayers, <hi rend="italic">konor,</hi> women ; but <hi rend="italic">tiðir,</hi> times, <hi rend="italic">tungur,</hi> tongues. The same fact occurs in certain old Swedish manuscripts. When Norway had been united later with Sweden under one crown (1319) we meet pure Suecisms in the Norwegian literary language. In addition to this, the 14th century exhibits several differences from the old language<note anchored="true" n="33" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The present writer is indebted to Prof. Joh. Storm for the following remarks on the history of the Norwegian language and its dialects during the 14th and 15th centuries.</p></note>: <hi rend="italic">rl, rn</hi> are sometimes assimilated into <hi rend="italic">ll, nn,—</hi> as <hi rend="italic">kail</hi> (elder <hi rend="italic">karl},</hi> man, <hi rend="italic">konn (korn),</hi> corn, <hi rend="italic">prestanner (prestamir),</hi> the priests; <hi rend="italic">i</hi> passes into <hi rend="italic">y</hi> before <hi rend="italic">r, I,—</hi> as <hi rend="italic">hyrðir (hiriSir),</hi> shepherd, <hi rend="italic">lykyl (lykill),</hi> key ; final <hi rend="italic">-r</hi> after a consonant is changed into <hi rend="italic">-er</hi> or <hi rend="italic">-ser,</hi> sometimes only <hi rend="italic">-c, -se,—</hi> as <hi rend="italic">hester (hestr),</hi> horse ; <hi rend="italic">bfiker (b&amp;kr),</hi> books ; the names <hi rend="italic">polleifser (porleifr), Guðlseifae (Guðleifr).</hi> About the beginning of the 15th century initial occurs for old <hi rend="italic">hv</hi> (not, however, in pronouns, which take <hi rend="italic">kv</hi> only in western Norway), as the local name <hi rend="italic">Qviteseið (hvitr,</hi> white). During the 15th century, Norway being united with Denmark, and at intervals also with Sweden, a great many Danisms and a few Suecisms are imported into the language. As Suecisms we may mention the termination <hi rend="italic">-in</hi> of the 2d pers. plur. instead of <hi rend="italic">-ir, -tð</hi> (as <hi rend="italic">vilin,</hi> you will), the pronoun <hi rend="italic">jak</hi> instead of <hi rend="italic">ek,</hi> I.
