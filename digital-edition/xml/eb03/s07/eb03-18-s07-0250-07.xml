a citizen and ſenator of ancient Rome, and conſul in the year 391, has left us ten books of epiſtles ; from which, as well as from other things, we collect, that he was a warm oppoſer of the Chriſtian religion. He was baniſhed from Rome by Valentinian on ſome account or other, but afterwards recalled and received into favour by Theodosius Ammianus Marcellinus speaks of him as a man of great learning and modeſty. Scioppius, Parens, and other learned men, have written notes upon the epiſtles of Symmachus : we know of no later edition of them than that of Frankfort, 164.2, 8vo. Ambroſe biſhop of Milan wrote againſt Symmachus, and ſo did the Chriſtian poet, Prudentius.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
