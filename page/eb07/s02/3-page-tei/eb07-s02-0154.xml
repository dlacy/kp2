Dr Hervez de Chegoni mentions the case of a woman, aged sixty-five years, in good health, and of a sound constitution, who having been bitten in the thigh only once by a single viper, expired under the most deplorable symptoms in thirty-seven hours.</p><p>The aspic, <hi rend="italic">Vipera aspis,</hi> is a species nearly allied to the preceding, of which it is by some regarded as a variety, and of which it seems to assume the place in the south-western countries of Europe, extending as far as the island of Sicily.@@<hi rend="superscript">1 </hi>Its form is more slender, its head larger, its top covered by irregularly formed scales, and the muzzle is slightly turned up. The aspic is the species which served the experiments of Redi, Charas, and Fontana. It inhabits the dry and rocky countries of Italy, has been observed in Switzerland, and is common in France from the 49th degree of north latitude, spreading into Savoy, the Pyrenees, and the Mediterranean shores. It is the viper of Fontainebleau, and is also found in the forest of Montmorency; but in Burgundy, and the more northern parts of France, it is replaced by our common viper.</p><p>New Holland produces a rare and remarkable species, which some class as generically distinct, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Acanthophis.</hi> It is of a thickened form, with a slender hard-pointed tail, the upper part of the head protected by nine plates. The eye is surrounded by plates, of which the superciliary are elevated, and inclined towards the top of the head. It is the <hi rend="italic">Vipera acanthophis</hi> of M. Schlegel,— <hi rend="italic">Acanthophis cerastinus,</hi> Lacépède.@@<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> See Plate CCCCXLIV. fig. 8.</p><p>A still more remarkable and anomalous species is the famous <hi rend="italic">Vipera cerastes</hi> of Africa, figured and described by Bruce the traveller,@@<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> and also in the great French work on Egypt.@@<hi rend="superscript">4</hi> Its head is very broad, and heart-shaped ; its muzzle broad, obtuse, and rounded ; its nostrils rather narrow, vertical and terminal ; and its scales surmounted by a tubercular ridge. One of the superciliary scales on each side is converted into a projecting horn-like process, curved forwards ; and the ancient name <hi rend="italic">cerastes</hi> is no doubt derived from this peculiar character,—the Greek word χέϐας signifying horn.</p><p>Cornua praetendens immania fronte cerastes,</p><p>Dum torquet spinam sibilat ecce vagus.</p><p>It seldom much exceeds a foot in length, and inhabits the sandy deserts of the north of Africa. Its description by Bruce has been so often quoted, that we shall rest satisfied by the reference already given to the writings of that impugned author.</p><p>We here close our sketch of this insidious order. But there still remains the singular genus <hi rend="italic">Cæcilia,</hi> with which Baron Cuvier concludes his classification of Ophidian reptiles, although other naturalists, both prior to and since the publication of his latest system,@@<hi rend="superscript">6</hi> have arranged it in the Batrachian order, or have even raised it, with the other constituents of that order, to the rank of a distinct and separate class, called <hi rend="smallcaps">Αμρηιβιa.@@* As</hi> we have already discussed that so-called class in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Reptilia</hi> of the present work (see <hi rend="italic">Encyc. Brit.</hi> vol. xix. p. 150), we shall here subjoin the characters of the anomalous reptiles just referred to, as given by the great French anatomist. They form, under the name of <hi rend="smallcaps">Naked Serpents </hi><hi rend="italic">(Serpens nues), </hi>the third and concluding family of his Ophidian order.</p><p>Genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Cæcilia.</hi> Eyes extremely small, almost concealed beneath the skin, sometimes wanting. Skin smooth, viscous, furrowed by annular folds, apparently naked, but exhibiting in its thickness certain slender scales, regularly disposed on many transverse ridges between the wrinkles of the skin. Head depressed, anus nearly terminal, tail consequently short or almost wanting. Ribs too short to surround the trunk. Vertebrae articulated by facets like hollowed cones filled with gelatinous cartilage, as in fishes and some Batrachia ; the cranium united to the first vertebra by two tubercles, also as in Batrachian reptiles. The orbits, covered by the maxillary bones, are only pierced by a very small hole ; and the bones of the temples cover the temporal fossæ, in such a way that the head exhibits superiorly nothing but a continuous bony buckler. (See Plate CCCCXLIII. fig. 1<hi rend="italic">d.)</hi> The hyoid bone, composed of three pair of arches, is so constructed as almost to lead to the belief that in early age there were gills. The maxillary and palatine teeth are ranged on two concentric lines, as in the genus Proteus, but are frequently sharp and curved backwards, as in true serpents. The nostrils open at the back part of the palate, and the lower jaw has no moveable pedicle, the tympanic bone being encased with the other</p><p><hi rend="superscript">@@@,</hi> Although the title of <hi rend="italic">Aspic</hi> has been applied to this species, it is not the reptile so named in ancient days, which was not a European specie», but more probably the <hi rend="italic">Naja haje</hi> of Africa.</p><p><hi rend="italic">@@@’ Ann. du Mus.</hi> iv. 100.	</p><p><hi rend="italic superscript">@@@3</hi><hi rend="italic"> Travels,</hi> V. pl. 41.	</p><p><hi rend="italic superscript">@@@4</hi><hi rend="italic"> Atlas,</hi> pl. 41. fig. 3, vol. xxv. 83.</p><p><hi rend="italic superscript">@@@3</hi> <hi rend="italic">Règne Animal,</hi> 2d ed. 1629.</p><p><hi rend="superscript">@@@s</hi> The separation above alluded to, although first precisely expressed by the word <hi rend="italic">class,</hi> in the writings of M. de Blainville, and subsequently followed in our own country by Messrs Gray, Bell, &amp;c. had been practically effected by several other authors at an earlier period. M. Duméril seems to have been the first to indicate the propriety of placing the genus <hi rend="italic">Cæcilia</hi> with the Batrachians, and apart from the Ophidian order <hi rend="italic">(Mémoires de Zoologie et d'Anatomie comparée,</hi> 1807,—·“ Sur la division des Reptiles Batraciens en familles naturelles”). In like manner, the <hi rend="italic">Reptilia nuda</hi> of Oppel (as distinguished from his <hi rend="italic">Reptilia Testudinata,—</hi>Turtles and Tortoises,—and his <hi rend="italic">Reptilia Squammata,—</hi>Crocodiles, Lizards, and Serpents) is composed of three primary divisions : lst, <hi rend="smallcaps">Apoda</hi> (genus <hi rend="italic">Cæcilia);</hi> 2d, <hi rend="smallcaps">Caudata</hi> (gen. <hi rend="italic">Siren, Proteus, Triton, Salamandra);</hi> 3d, <hi rend="smallcaps">Ecaudata</hi> (Frogs, Toads, &amp;c.). His work. <hi rend="italic">Die Ordnungen, Familien, und Gattungen, der Reptilien, als Prodrom einer Naturgeschichte dorselben,</hi> was published at Munich in 1811. Merrem, whose unfinished publication <hi rend="italic">(Βeitræge zur Naturgeschichte der Amphibien)</hi> appeared at different periods from 1790 to 1821, published the first edition of his <hi rend="italic">Tentamen Systematis Amphibiorum</hi> in 1800, and a revisal of the same work in 1820. He first partitions his reptiles into two great classes,— <hi rend="smallcaps">Philodota,</hi> containing all such ns have the body protected by a corneous or coriaceous covering, and <hi rend="smallcaps">Batrachia,</hi> including the species of which the covering is soft, smooth, and mucous. He then proceeds to subdivide the latter into three great groups,—<hi rend="smallcaps">Apoda, Salientia,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Ghadentiλ,</hi>—which he makes constituently the same as Oppel's <hi rend="smallcaps">Apoda, Ecaudata,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Caudata.</hi> Then follows M. de Blainville, with his <hi rend="italic">class </hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Amphibiens, ou Nudipelliferes</hi> (as distinct from other reptiles), consisting of the Batrachians commonly so called, and the genus <hi rend="italic">Coecilia,—</hi>the latter forming the Order <hi rend="smallcaps">Pseudophydiens.</hi> See <hi rend="italic">Nour. Bulletin des Sciences de la Soc. Phil,</hi> for July 1816, and the first volume of <hi rend="italic">Principes d’Anatomie Comparée,</hi> 1822. Mr Gray also views the Batrachian reptiles as a distinct class or great primary division of the Animal Kingdom, adding thereto the genus <hi rend="italic">Ceecilia. Synopsis Reptilium,</hi> and Griffith’s <hi rend="italic">Animal Kingdom,</hi> vol. ix. Appendix, p. 99, 1831. Finally, Mr Bell has likewise arranged our Batrachian reptiles, and the genus in question, in a separate class <hi rend="smallcaps">Amphibia,</hi> which he divides into the five following orders, 1st, <hi rend="smallcaps">Ampiiip- neuhta,—</hi><hi rend="italic">Sirens</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Protei;</hi> 2d, <hi rend="smallcaps">Anouda,—</hi><hi rend="italic">Frogs</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Toads;</hi> 3d, <hi rend="smallcaps">Ueodela,—</hi><hi rend="italic">Salamanders;</hi> 4th, <hi rend="smallcaps">Abrλnchia,</hi>—gen. <hi rend="italic">Menopoma </hi>and <hi rend="italic">Amphiuma;</hi> 5th, <hi rend="smallcaps">Apoda,</hi>—genus <hi rend="italic">Cæcilia. Encyclopædia of Anatomy and Physiology,</hi> part i. p. 91. It will be perceived that this system differs chiefly from those now enounced, in the placing of two very peculiar American genera,—<hi rend="italic">Menopoma</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Amphiuma,</hi> characterized by the absence of gills,—in a separate order, termed <hi rend="smallcaps">Abhanchia,</hi> from the presumed peculiarity just alluded to. The last-named arrangement is adopted by Mr Swainson, in <hi rend="italic">Cabinet Cyclopιvdia,</hi> vol. cxvi. pp. 83 and 339.</p></body></text></TEI>
