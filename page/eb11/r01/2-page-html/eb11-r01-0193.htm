<p><span class="font1">distribution of drift over the protected area. They are constructed with a foundation of fascines and concrete, faced&nbsp;with brickwork or stone pitching. The result has been the&nbsp;formation of a gently sloping beach which reduces wave&nbsp;action; such loss, too, as is still occasioned by storms is speedily&nbsp;made good by natural accretion in moderate weather. The&nbsp;Blankenberghe groynes are too expensive a type for ordinary use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The beach at Bridlington, which rests on boulder clay, was rapidly disappearing owing to the increased scour due to&nbsp;the sea-walls. Accordingly, groynes (see figs, 11, 12) made&nbsp;of 14 ft. × 9 in. × 9 in. pitch-pine piles, and 11 in. × 4 in.&nbsp;planking, were erected along the foreshore. The piles originally projected about 6 ft.; but, to prevent&nbsp;heaping up of sand to windward with&nbsp;denudation to leeward, the planking was&nbsp;never raised more than two strakes above&nbsp;sand-level, fresh planks being added as the&nbsp;sand rose. The south-easterly gales are&nbsp;said to be the most erosive here, and&nbsp;prevalent during the winter months ; on&nbsp;this account the groynes were given an&nbsp;inclination of 10° south of east, that is&nbsp;10° from the perpendicular. It may be&nbsp;doubted whether this was the best&nbsp;angle, but the result has been very satisfactory. The cost of</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">construction was from 12s. 3d. to 18s. per lineal foot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The sand-banks at the entrance to Poole Harbour have been</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">protected by groynes (see fig. 13) inclined at slightly varying angles, some yielding better results than others. This is a&nbsp;good example of the important work which may be accom-plished by groyning. Unprotected, a breach would soon have&nbsp;been effected in these sand-banks; with a double entrance to&nbsp;the bay the present deep channel would have silted up, and&nbsp;Poole Harbour would have been practically destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is evident that the efficacy of groynes in collecting drift is proportionate to the distance which they can be carried&nbsp;out seawards, and that they should always be extended to&nbsp;low-water mark; whilst, by raising them only slightly above&nbsp;the beach, the accumulation of drift to leeward is promoted,&nbsp;the passage of drift over the obstruction being facilitated&nbsp;and the scour of the waves diminished. By this means, and&nbsp;by gradually raising and extending the groynes as the drift&nbsp;accumulates, the general elevation of the beach can be secured.&nbsp;Drift generally travels in hoth directions along a coast, veering&nbsp;with the wind; thus the prevailing wind determines the preponderating travel of the drift. Groynes are usually constructed at right angles to the shore, but it is believed that&nbsp;increased benefit may be obtained by slightly inclining them&nbsp;to leeward of the prevailing wind. Some engineers have&nbsp;advocated the extension of groynes below low-water mark;&nbsp;and as wood when permanently submerged is specialty liable,&nbsp;even when creosoted, to be attacked by the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">teredo</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">limnoria,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">the use of reinforced or ferro-concrete has been suggested as&nbsp;the most suitable material for submarine groyning. These&nbsp;suggestions, however, and many other current theories on&nbsp;groyning, require to be demonstrated by repeated experiments.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RECLUS, JEAN JACQUES ELISÉE (1830-1905), French geographer, was born at Sainte-Foy la Grande (Gironde), on the&nbsp;15th of March 1830. He was the second son of a Protestant&nbsp;pastor, who had a family of twelve children, several of whom&nbsp;acquired some celebrity either as men of letters, politicians or&nbsp;members of the learned professions. His education, begun in&nbsp;Rhenish Prussia, was continued in the Protestant college of&nbsp;Montauban, and completed at the university of Berlin, where&nbsp;he followed a long course of geography under Karl Ritter.&nbsp;Withdrawing from France in consequence of the events of&nbsp;December 1851, he spent the next six years (1852-57) visiting&nbsp;the British Isles, the United States, Central America, and&nbsp;Colombia. On his return to Paris he contributed to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Revue&nbsp;des deux mondes</span><span class="font1">, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tour du monde</span><span class="font1"> and other periodicals a&nbsp;large number of articles embodying the results of his geographical&nbsp;work. Among other works at this period was an excellent short&nbsp;book, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Histoire d’un ruisseau,</span><span class="font1"> in which he traces the development&nbsp;of a great river from source to mouth. In 1867-68 he published&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">La Terre; description des phénomènes de la vie du globe,</span><span class="font1"> in two&nbsp;volumes. During the siege of Paris, Reclus shared in the&nbsp;aerostatic operations conducted by M. Nadar, and also served&nbsp;in the National Guard, while as a member of the Association&nbsp;Nationale des Travailleurs he published in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cri du Peuple</span><span class="font1"> a&nbsp;hostile manifesto against the government of Versailles in con-nexion with the Communist rising of the 18th of March 1871.&nbsp;Continuing to serve in the National Guard, now in open revolt,&nbsp;he was taken prisoner on the 5th of April, and on the 16th of&nbsp;November sentenced to transportation for life; but, largely&nbsp;at the instance of influential deputations from England, the&nbsp;sentence was commuted in January 1872 to perpetual banish-ment. Thereupon, after a short visit to Italy, he settled at&nbsp;Clarens, in Switzerland, where he resumed his literary labours,&nbsp;and, after producing the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Histoire d’une montagne</span><span class="font1"> (a companion&nbsp;to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Histoire d’un ruisseau)</span><span class="font1">, wrote nearly the whole of his great&nbsp;work, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">La Nouvelle Géographie universelle, la terre et les hommes,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">19 vols. (1875-94). This is a stupendous compilation, profusely&nbsp;illustrated with maps, plans, and engravings, and was crowned&nbsp;with the gold medal of the Paris Geographical Society in 1892.&nbsp;An English edition appeared simultaneously, also in 19 vols.,&nbsp;the first four by E. G. Ravenstein, the rest by A. H. Keane.&nbsp;Extreme accuracy and hrilliant exposition form the leading&nbsp;characteristics of all Reclus’s writings, which thus possess&nbsp;permanent literary and scientific value. In 1882 Reclus&nbsp;initiated the “ Anti-Marriage Movement,” in accordance with&nbsp;which he allowed his two daughters to marry without any civil&nbsp;or religious sanction whatever. This step caused no little&nbsp;embarrassment to many of his well-wishers, and was followed by&nbsp;government prosecutions, instituted in the High Court of Lyons,&nbsp;against the anarchists, members of the International Association,&nbsp;of which Reclus and Prince Kropotkin were designated as the&nbsp;two chief organizers. The prince was arrested and condemned&nbsp;to five years’ imprisonment, but Reclus, being resident in&nbsp;Switzerland, escaped. After 1892 he filled the chair of comparative geography in the university of Brussels, and con-tributed several important memoirs to French, German and&nbsp;English scientific journals. Among these may be mentioned&nbsp;“ The Progress of Mankind ” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Contemp. Rev.,</span><span class="font1"> 1896); “ Attila de&nbsp;Gcrando ” (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rev. Géograph.,</span><span class="font1"> 1898); “ A great Globe ” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Geograph.&nbsp;Journ.,</span><span class="font1"> 1898); “L’Extrême-Orient” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Bul.
