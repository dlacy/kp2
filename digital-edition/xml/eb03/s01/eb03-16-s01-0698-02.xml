(Charles-William), was born on the 19th of December 1742, at Stralſund, where his father kept a ſhop. When he was very young, he received the uſual inſtructions of a private ſchool; and was afterwards advanced to an academy. At a very early age he ſhewed a ſtrong deſire to follow the profeſſion of an apothecary, and his father ſuffered him to gratify his inclinations. With Mr Bauch, an apothecary at Gottenburg, he paſſed his apprenticeſhip, which was completed in ſix years. He remained, however, ſome time longer at that place, and it was there that he ſo excellently laid the firſt foundations of his knowledge. Among the various books which he read, that treated of chemical ſubjects, Kunckel's Laboratory ſeems to have been his favourite. He uſed to repeat many of the experiments contained in that work privately in the night, when the reſt of the family had retired to reſt. A friend of Scheele’s had remarked the progreſs which he had made in chemiſtry, and had aſked him by what inducements he had been at firſt led to ſtudy a ſcience in which he had gained ſuch knowledge? Scheele returned the following anſwer: “The firſt cauſe, my friend, aroſe from yourſelf. Nearly at the beginning of my apprenticeſhip you adviſed me to read Neuman’s Chemiſtry; from the peruſal of which I became eager to make experiments myſelf; and I remember very well how I mixed together, in a conſerve-glaſs, oil of cloves and fuming acid of nitre, which immediately took fire. I ſee alſo ſtill before my eyes an unlucky experiment which I made with pyrophorus. Circum- ſtances of this kind did but the more inflame my deſire to repeat experiments. ” After Scheele’s departure from Gottenburg, in the year 1765, he obtained a place with Kalſtrom, an apothecary at Malmo. Two years afterwards he went from thence to Stockholm, and managed there the ſhop of Mr Scharenberg. In 1773, he changed this appointment for another at Upſal, under Mr Loock. Here he was fortunately ſituated; as, from his acquaintance with learned men, and from having free acceſs to the Univerſity Laboratory, he had opportunities of increaſing his knowledge. At this place alſo he happily commenced the friendſhip which ſubfiſted between him and Bergman. During his reſidence at this place, his Royal Highneſs Prince Henry of Pruſſia, accompanied by the Duke of Sun</p><p>derland, viſited Upſal, and choſe this opportunity to ſee the Academical Laboratory. Scheele was accordingly appointed by the Univerſity to exhibit ſome chemical experiments to them. This office he undertook, and ſhewed ſome of the moſt curious proceſſes in chemiſtry. The two Princes aſked him many queſtions, and expreſſed their approbation of the anſwers which he returned to them. The Duke aſked him what countryman he was, and ſeemed to be much pleaſed when Scheele informed him that he was born at Stralſund, At their departure they told the profeſſor, who was preſent, that they ſhould eſteem it a favour if he would permit the young man to have free acceſs to the Laboratory, as often as he choſe, to make experiments.</p><p>In the year 1777 Scheele was appointed by the Medical College to be apothecary at Koping. It was at that place that he ſoon ſhewed the world how great a man he was, and that no place or ſituation could confine his abilities. When he was at Stockholm he ſhewed his acuteneſs as a chemiſt, as he diſcovered there the new and wonderful acid contained in the ſparry fluor. It has been confidently aſſerted, that Scheele was the firſt who diſcovered the nature of the aerial acid; and that whilſt he was at Upſal he made many experiments to prove its properties. This circumſtance might probably have furniſhed Bergman with the means of handling this ſubject more fully. At the ſame place he began the ſeries of excellent experiments on that remarkable mineral ſubſtance, manganeſe; from which inveſtigation he was led to make the very valuable and intereſting diſcovery of the dephlogiſticated marine acid. At the ſame time he firſt obſerved the ponderous earth.</p><p>At Koping he finiſhed his diſſertation on Air and Fire; a work which the celebrated Bergman moſt warmly recommended in the friendly preface which he wrote for it. The theory which Scheele endeavours to prove in this treatiſe is, that fire confiſts of pure air and phlogiſton. According to more recent opinions (if inflammable air be phlogiſton), water is compoſed of theſe two principles. Of theſe opinions we may ſay, in the words of Cicero, " <hi rend="italic">Opiniones tam variae ſunt, tamque inter ſe diſſidentes, ut alterum profecto fieri potest, ut earum nulla, alterum certe non potest ut plus una, vera fit. ”</hi> The author’s merit in this work, excluſive of the encomiums of Bergman, was ſufficient to obtain the approbation of the public; as the ingenuity diſplayed in handling ſo delicate a ſubject, and the many new and valuable obſervations<note anchored="true" n="1" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="smallcaps">(a)</hi> Scheele mentions in this work, in a curſory way, the decompoſition of common ſalt by the calx of lead. Mr Turner, a gentleman who happily unites the ſkill of the manufacturer with the knowledge of the philoſophic chemiſt, has alſo all the merit of this diſcovery, as he obſerved the ſame fact, without having been indebted to Scheele’s hint on this ſubject. Mr Turner has done more; he has converted this diſcovery to ſome uſe in the arts; he produces mineral alkali for ſale, ariſing from this decompoſition; and from the lead, which is united to the marine acid he forms the beautiful pigment called the <hi rend="italic">patent yellow.</hi></p></note> <hi rend="smallcaps">(a)</hi> which are diſperſed through the treatiſe, juſtly entitled the author to that fame which his book procured him. It was ſpread abroad through every country, became ſoon out of print, was reprinted, and tranſlated into many languages. The Engliſh tranſiation is enriched with the notes of that accurate and truly philoſophic genius Richard Kirwan, Eſq.</p><p>Scheele now diligently employed himſelf in contributing to the Tranſactions of the Academy at Stockholm.<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0705.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0699"/>
He firſt pointed out a new way to prepare the ſalt of benzoin. In the ſame year he diſcovered that arſenic, freed in a particular manner from phlogiſton, partakes of all the properties of an acid, and has its peculiar affinities to other ſubſtances.</p><p>In a Diſſertation on Flint, Clay, and Alum, he clearly overturned Beaume’s opinion of the identity of the ſiliceous and argillaceous earths. He publiſhed an Analyſis of the Human Calculus. He ſhewed alſo a mode of preparing mercurius dulcis in the humid way, and improved the proceſs of making the powder of Algaroth. He analyſed the mineral ſubſtance called <hi rend="italic">molybdena,</hi> or flexible black lead. He diſcovered a beautiful green pigment. He ſhewed us how to decompoſe the air of the atmoſphere. He diſcovered that ſome neutral ſalts are decompoſed by lime and iron. He decompoſed plumbago, or the common black lead. He obſerved, with peculiar ingenuity, an acid in milk, which decompoſes acetated alkali; and in his experiments on the ſugar of milk, he diſcovered another acid, different in ſome reſpects from the above-mentioned acid and the common acid of ſugar. He accompliſhed the decompoſition of tungſtein, the component parts of which were before unknown, and found in it a peculiar acid earth united to lime. He publiſhed an excellent diſſertation on the different forts of aether. He found out an eaſy way to preſerve vinegar for many years. His inveſtigation of the colouring matter in Pruſſian blue, the means he employed to ſeparate it, and his diſcovery that alkali, ſal ammoniac, and charcoal, mixed together, will produce it, are ſtrong marks of his penetration and genius. He found out a peculiar ſweet matter in expreſſed oils, after they have been boiled with litharge and water. He ſhewed how the acid of lemons may be obtained in cryſtals. He found the white powder in rhubarb, which Model thought to be ſelenite, and which amounts to one-ſeventh of the weight of the root, to be calcareous earth, united to the acid of ſorrel. This ſuggeſted to him the examination of the acid of ſorrel. He precipitated acetated lead with it, and decompoſed the precipitate thus obtained by the vitriolic acid, and by this proceſs he obtained the common acid of ſugar; and by ſlowly dropping a ſolution of fixed alkali into a ſolution of the acid of ſugar, he regenerated the acid of ſorrel. —From his examination of the acids contained in fruits and berries, he found not one ſpecies of acid alone, viz. the acid of lemon, but another alſo, which he denominated the malaceous acid, from its being found in the greateſt quantity in apples.</p><p>By the decompoſition of Bergman’s new metal (ſiderite) he ſhewed the truth of Meyer’s and Klaproth’s conjecture concerning it. He boiled the calx of ſiderite with alkali of tartar, and precipitated nitrated mercury by the middle ſalt which he obtained by this operation; the calx of mercury which was precipitated was found to be united to the acid of pholphorus; ſo that he demonſtrates that this calx was phoſphorated iron. He found alſo, that the native Pruſſian blue Contained the ſame acid. He diſcovered by the ſame means, that the perlate acid, as it was called, was not an acid <hi rend="italic">fui generis,</hi> but the phoſphoric united to a ſmall quantity of the mineral alkali. He ſuggeſted an improvement in the proceſs for obtaining magnefia from Epsom ſalt; he adviſes the adding of an equal weight</p><p>of common ſalt to the Epſom ſalt, ſo that an equal weight of Glauber’s ſalt may be obtained: but this will not ſucceed unleſs in the cold of winter. Theſe are the valuable diſcoveries of this great philoſopher, which are to be found in the Tranſactions of the Royal Society at Stockholm. Moſt of his eſſays have been publiſhed in French by Madame Picardet, and Monſ. Morveau of Dijon. Dr Beddoes alſo has made a very valuable preſent to his countrymen of an Engliſh tranſlation of a greater part of Scheele’s diſſertations, to which he has added ſome uſeful and ingenious notes. The following diſcoveries of Scheele are not, we believe, publiſhed with the reſt. He ſhewed what that ſubſtance is, which has been generally called ‘the earth of the fluor ſpar.’ It is not produced unleſs the fluor acid meet with ſiliceous earth. It appears from Scheele’s experiments to be a triple ſalt, conſiſting of flint, acid of fluor, and fixed alkali. Scheele proved alſo, that the fluor acid may be produced without any addition of the vitriolic or any mineral acid: the fluor is melted with fixed alkali, and the fluorated alkali is decompoſed by acetated lead. If the precipitate be mixed with charcoal dull, and expoſed in a retort to a ſtrong heat, the lead will be revived, and the acid of fluor, which was united to it, will paſs into the receiver poffeſſed of all its uſual properties. This ſeems to be an ingenious and unanſwerable proof of its exiſtence.</p><p>He obſerved, that no pyrophorus can be made unleſs an alkali be preſent; and the reaſon why it can be prepared from alum and coal is, that the common alum always contains a little alkali, which is added in order to make it chryſtallize; for if this be ſeparated from it, no pyrophorus can be procured from it. His laſt diſſertation was his very valuable obſervations on the acid of the gallnut. Ehrhart, one of Scheele’s moſt intimate friends, aſſerts, that he was the diſcoverer of both of the acids of ſugar and tartar. We are alſo indebted to him for that maſterpiece of chemical decompoſition, the ſeparation of the acid of phoſphorus from bones. This appears from a letter which Scheele wrote to Gahn, who has generally had the reputation of this great diſcovery. This acid, which is ſo curious in the eye of the chemiſt, begins to draw the attention of the phyſician. It was firſt uſed in medicine, united to the mineral alkali, by the ingenious Dr Pearſon. The value of this addition to the materia medica cannot be better evinced than from the increaſe of the demand for it, and the quantity of it which is now prepared and ſold in London.</p><p>We may ſtamp the character of Scheele as a philoſopher from his many and important diſcoveries. What concerns him as a man we are informed of by his friends, who affirm, that his moral character was irreproachable. From his outward appearance, you would not at firſt fight have judged him to be a man of extraordinary abilities; but there was a quickneſs in his eye, which, to an accurate obſerver, would point out the penetration of his mind. He mixed but little with the crowd of common acquaintance; for this he had neither time nor inclination, as, when his profeſſion permitted him, he was for the moſt part employed in his experimental inquiries. But he had a ſoul for friendſhip; nor could even his philoſophical purſuits withhold him from truly enjoying the ſociety of thoſe whom he could cſteem and love. Before he adopted any opinion, or a particular theory, he conſidered it with the greateſt attention; but<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0706.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0700"/>
when once his ſentiments were fixed, he adhered to them, and defended them with reſolution. Not but that he was ingenuous enough to ſuſſer himſelf to be convinced by weighty objections; as he has ſhewn that he was open to conviction.</p><p>His chemical apparatus was neither neat nor convenient; his laboratory was ſmall and confined; nor was he particular in regard to the veſſels which he employed in his experiments, as often the firſt phial which came to hand was placed in his ſand heat: ſo that we may juſtly wonder how ſuch diſcoveries, and ſuch elegant experiments, could have been made under ſuch unfavourable circumſtances. He underſtood none of the modern languages except the German and Swediſh; ſo that he had not the advantage of being benefited by the early intelligence of discoveries made by foreigners, but was forced to wait till the intelligence was conveyed to him in the flow and uncertain channel of tranſlation. The important ſervices which Scheele did to natural philoſophy entitled him to univerſal reputation; and he obtained it: his name was well known by all Europe, and he was member of ſeveral learned academies and philoſophical ſocieties.</p><p>It was often wiſhed that he would quit his retirement at Koping, and move in a larger ſphere. It was ſuggeſted to him, that a place might be procured in England, which might afford him a good income and more leiſure; and, indeed, latterly an offer was made to him of an annuity of 300l. if he would ſettle in this country. But death, alas! put an end to this project. For half a year before this melancholy event, his health had been declining, and he himſelf was ſenſible that he would not recover. On the 19th of May 1786, he was confined to his bed; on the 21ſt he bequeathed all of which he was poſſeſſed to his wife (who was the widow of his predeceſſor at Koping, and whom he had lately married); and on the ſame day he departed this life. So the world loſt, in leſs than two years, Bergman and Scheele, of whom Sweden may juſtly boaſt; two philoſophers, who were beloved and lamented by all their contemporaries, and whoſe memory poſterity will never ceaſe moſt gratefully to revere.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
