        <p><span class="font1">in the past.@@<sup>1</sup> For, while Rome had been extending her
                sway westward and eastward, while the treasury had&nbsp;been enriched, and while her
                nobles and merchants were&nbsp;amassing colossal fortunes abroad, the small
                freeholders&nbsp;throughout the greater part of Italy were sinking deeper&nbsp;into
                ruin under the pressure of accumulated difficulties.&nbsp;The Hannibalic war had
                laid waste their fields and&nbsp;thinned their numbers, and when peace returned to
                Italy&nbsp;it brought with it no revival of prosperity. The heavy&nbsp;burden of
                military service still pressed ruinously upon&nbsp;them,@@<sup>2</sup> and in
                addition they were called upon to compete&nbsp;with the foreign corn imported from
                beyond the sea,@@<sup>3</sup> and&nbsp;with the foreign slave-labour purchased by
                the capital of&nbsp;wealthier men. Farming became unprofitable, and the&nbsp;hard
                laborious life with its scanty returns was thrown&nbsp;into still darker relief when
                compared with the stirring life&nbsp;of the camps with its opportunities of booty,
                or with the&nbsp;cheap provisions, frequent largesses, and gay spectacles to&nbsp;be
                had in the large towns. The small holders went off to&nbsp;follow the eagles or
                swell the proletariate of the cities,&nbsp;and their holdings were left to run waste
                or merged in&nbsp;the vineyards, oliveyards, and above all in the great
                cattle-farms, of the rich, and their own place was taken by&nbsp;slaves. The evil
                was not equally serious in all parts of&nbsp;Italy. It was least felt in the central
                highlands, in&nbsp;Campania, and in the newly settled fertile valley of the&nbsp;Po.
                It was worst in Etruria and in southern Italy ; but&nbsp;everywhere it was serious
                enough to demand the earnest&nbsp;attention of Roman statesmen. Of its existence
                the&nbsp;government had received plenty of warning in the declining numbers of
                able-bodied males returned at the&nbsp;census,@@<sup>4</sup> in the increasing
                difficulties of recruiting for the&nbsp;legions,@@<sup>5</sup> in servile outbreaks
                in Etruria and Apulia,@@<sup>6</sup> and&nbsp;between 200 and 160 a good deal was
                attempted by way&nbsp;of remedy. In addition to the foundation of
                    twenty&nbsp;colonies,@@<sup>7</sup> there were frequent allotments of land
                to&nbsp;veteran soldiers, especially in Apulia and Samnium.@@<sup>8</sup>
                In&nbsp;180 40,000 Ligurians were removed from their homes&nbsp;and settled on
                vacant lands once the property of a&nbsp;Samnite tribe,@@<sup>9</sup> and in 160 the
                Pomptine marshes were&nbsp;drained for the purpose of cultivation.@@<sup>10</sup>
                But these efforts&nbsp;were only partially successful. The colonies planted
                in&nbsp;Cisalpine Gaul and in Picenum flourished, but of the&nbsp;others the
                majority slowly dwindled away, and two required recolonizing only eight years after
                their foundation.@@<sup>11&nbsp;</sup>The veterans who received land were unfitted
                to make&nbsp;good farmers ; and large numbers, on the first opportunity,&nbsp;gladly
                returned as volunteers to a soldier’s life. Moreover, after 160 even these efforts
                ceased, and with the&nbsp;single exception of the colony of Auximum in
                Picenum&nbsp;(157) nothing was done to check the spread of the evil,&nbsp;until in
                133 Tiberius Gracchus, on his election to the&nbsp;tribunate, set his hand to the
                work.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The remedy proposed by Gracchus@@<sup>12</sup> amounted in
                effect</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">to the resumption by the state of as much of the “common land” as was
                not held in occupation by authorized persons and conformably to the provisions of
                the&nbsp;Licinian law. Unauthorized occupiers were to be evicted ;&nbsp;in other
                cases the occupation was reduced to a maximum&nbsp;size of 1000
                    acres;@@<sup>13</sup> the public pastures were reclaimed&nbsp;for
                    agriculture.@@<sup>14</sup> And the land thus rescued for the community from the
                monopoly of a few was to be distributed&nbsp;in allotments.@@<sup>15</sup> It was a
                scheme which could quote in its&nbsp;favour ancient precedent as well as urgent
                necessity. Of&nbsp;the causes which led to its ultimate failure something&nbsp;will
                be said later on ; for the present we must turn to the&nbsp;constitutional conflict
                which it provoked. The senate&nbsp;from the first identified itself with the
                interests of the&nbsp;wealthy occupiers, and Tiberius found himself forced
                into&nbsp;a struggle with the senate, which had been no part of his&nbsp;original
                plan. He fell back on the legislative sovereignty&nbsp;of the assembly ; he
                resuscitated the half-forgotten powers&nbsp;of interference vested in the tribunate
                in order to paralyse&nbsp;the action of· the senatorial magistrates, and finally
                lost&nbsp;his life in an attempt to make good one of the weak&nbsp;points in the
                tribune’s position by securing his own re-election for a second year. But the
                conflict did not end with&nbsp;his death. It was renewed on a wider scale, and with
                a&nbsp;more deliberate aim by his brother Gaius, who on his&nbsp;election to the
                tribunate (123) at once came forward as&nbsp;the avowed enemy of the senate. The
                latter suddenly&nbsp;found its control of the administration threatened at
                a&nbsp;variety of points. On the invitation of the popular&nbsp;tribune the assembly
                proceeded to restrict the senate’s&nbsp;freedom of action in assigning the
                    provinces.@@<sup>16</sup> It regulated the taxation of the province of
                    Asia@@<sup>17</sup> and altered the&nbsp;conditions of military
                    service.@@<sup>18</sup> In home affairs it inflicted&nbsp;two serious blows on
                the senate’s authority by declaring&nbsp;the summary punishment of Roman citizens by
                the consuls on the strength of a senatus consultum to be a violation of the law of
                    appeal,@@<sup>19</sup> and by taking out of the&nbsp;senate’s hands the control
                of the newly established court&nbsp;for the trial of cases of magisterial
                misgovernment in the&nbsp;provinces.@@<sup>20</sup> Tiberius had committed the
                mistake of relying too exclusively on the support of one section only of&nbsp;the
                community ; his brother endeavoured to enlist on&nbsp;the popular side every
                available ally. The Latins and&nbsp;Italians had opposed an agrarian scheme which
                took from&nbsp;them land which they had come to regard as rightfully&nbsp;theirs,
                and gave them no share in the benefit of the allotments.@@<sup>21</sup> Gaius not
                only removed this latter grievance,@@<sup>22&nbsp;</sup>but ardently supported and
                himself brought forward the&nbsp;first proposals made in Rome for their
                    enfranchisement.@@<sup>23</sup></span></p>
