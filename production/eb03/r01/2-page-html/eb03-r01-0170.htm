<p><span class="font2">that the fame bodies which have been accomplices in our vices and virtues, ſhould alſo ſhare in our rewards&nbsp;and puniſhments. Now, granting they will, ſhall one&nbsp;ſet of particles be bound for the crimes, or be entitled&nbsp;to receive the rewards, of the animal ſyſtem, ſrom its firſt&nbsp;commencement to its diffolution ? or ſhall every particle&nbsp;∏fe up ſucceſſively, and receive its dividend of rewards&nbsp;and puniſhments for the vices and virtues that belonged'&nbsp;to the ſyſtern during the time that they were in union&nbsp;with the ſentient principle ? and is the hand that fell in&nbsp;defending a father to be (as is ſuppoſed in ſome of the&nbsp;eaſtern countries) rewarded in heaven ; while the other&nbsp;that ftruck him when the ſon became vicious, is diſmiffed&nbsp;into torments ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Finding this hypotheſis ſupported by neither Scripture nor reaſon, they next appeal to the ancient fathers. And they, it is confeffed, are for the reſurrection of the&nbsp;very ſame ſieſlr. But this notion is directly contrary to&nbsp;the Scriptures, which have ſaid, that fleſh and blood&nbsp;are not to inherit the kingdom of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But whatever be the bodies with which the dead are to be raifed at the general reſurrection, all mankind&nbsp;muſt appear in judgment, and receive ſentence accord-ing to the deeds done in the body, without regard, ſo&nbsp;far as we know, to their actions and conduct in the&nbsp;middle ſtate- After this ſentence, the righteous are to&nbsp;enter into celeſtial and eternal joys, and the wicked to&nbsp;fnffer the puniſhments of hell. Theſe puniſhments&nbsp;ſome have ſuppoſed to be everlaſting ; others think,&nbsp;that after ſome temporary puniſhment, the fouls, of the&nbsp;wicked are to be annihilated ; and others imagine, that&nbsp;after doing purgatorial penance for a while in hell, they&nbsp;are to be again received into favour ; inclining to ex-plain the denunciations of the Almighty as a child&nbsp;would do the threatenings of his mother, or a lover&nbsp;the affected chidings of his miftreſs (a).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RESUSCITATION, the fame with refurrection and revivification. See the preceding article and Re-animatΓon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The term </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">reſufiitation,</span><span class="font2"> however, is more particularly uſed by chemiſts for the reproducing a mixed body&nbsp;from its aſhes ; an ail to which many have pretended,,&nbsp;as to reproduce plants, &amp;c. from their aſhes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RETAIL, in commerce, is the felling of goods in fmall parcels, in oppofition to wholeſale. </span><span class="font1">See </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Com-jmerce.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RETAINER, a ſervant who does not continually dwell in the houſe of his maſter, but only attends up-on ſpecial occalions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RETAINING FEE, the firſt ſee given to a ſerjeant or counſellor at law, in order to make him ſure, and&nbsp;prevent his pleading on the contrary fide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RETALIATION, among civilians, the act of re-turning like for like.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RETARDATION, in phyfics, the act of dimi-niſhing the velocity of a moving body. See Gunnery, Mechanics, Pneumatics, and Projectiles-</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RETE MiRABiLE, in anatomy, a ſmall plexus or net-work of veffels in the brain, ſurrounding the pituitary gland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RETENTION is defined by Mr Locke to be, a faculty of the mind, whereby it keeps or retains thoſe&nbsp;fimple ideas it has once received, by ſenſation or reſiec-tion. See Metaphysics, Part I. Chap. ii.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Retention is alſo uſed, in medicine, &amp;c. for the ſtate of contraction in the ſolids or vaſcular parts of the&nbsp;body, which makes them hold faſt their proper eon-tents. In this ſenſe, retention is cppoſed to evacuation and excretion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RETICULAR </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">BODY </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(corpus rcticulare),</span><span class="font2"> in anato-&lt;∙ my, a very fine membrane, perforated, in the manner of&nbsp;a net, with a multitude of foramina. It is placed im-mediately under the cuticle; and when that is ſeparated&nbsp;from the cutis, whether by art or accident, this adheres&nbsp;firmly to it, and is fcarce poſſible to be parted from&nbsp;it, ſeeming rather to bc its inner fuperficies than a&nbsp;diſtinct ſubſtance. In regard to this, we are to obſerve, firſt, the places in which it is found, being all&nbsp;thoſe in which the ſenſe of feeling is moſt acute, as in&nbsp;the palms of the hands, the extremities of the fingers,&nbsp;and on the ſoles of the feet. The tongue, however, is&nbsp;the part where it is moſt accurately to be obſerved : it&nbsp;is more eaſily diſtinguiſhable there than anywhere elſe,:&nbsp;and its nature and ſtructure are moſt evidently ſeen&nbsp;there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Its colour in the Europeans is white ; but in the ne-groes and other black nations it is black ; in the tawny-it is yellowiſht the ſkin itſelf in both is white; and the. blackneſs and yellowneſs depend altogether on the co-lour of this membrane.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The ufes of the corpus reticulare are to preſerve the ſtructure of the other parts of the integuments, and?&nbsp;keep them in their determinate form and fituation. Its.&nbsp;apertures give paffage to the hairs and ſweat through&nbsp;the papillae and excretory ducts of the ſkin : it retains»&nbsp;theſe in a certain and determinate order, that they cannot be removed out of their places, and has ſome·&nbsp;ſhare in preſerving the ſoftneſs of the papille, which&nbsp;renders them fit for the ſenſe of feeling. See Anato--my, n<sup>0</sup> 83.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Reticulum, is a Latin word, fιgnifying a //#/&lt;? or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">cajling <sup>net</sup>∙</span><span class="font2"> It was applied by the Romans to a parti-'&nbsp;cular mode of conſtrncting their buildings. In the city·&nbsp;of Salino (ſee Sδlino) are ſtill to be ſeen remains of&nbsp;ſome walls, evidently of Roman origin from the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">reticulum.</span><span class="font2"> This ſtructure confiſts of ſmall pieces of baked&nbsp;earth cut lozengewiſe, and difpoſed with great regularity&nbsp;on the angles, ſo as to exhibit to the eye the appearance of&nbsp;cut diamonds ; and was called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">reticular,</span><span class="font2"> ſrom its reſem-blance to fiſhing-nets. The Romans always concealed&nbsp;it under a regular coating of other matter ; and Mr&nbsp;Houel informs us, that this was the only ſpecimen of&nbsp;it which he ſaw in all his travels through Sicily, Malta,,&nbsp;and Lipari. It appears to be the remains of fome baths,</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">(a) The French convention, whoſe principles are equally new, daring, and deſtructive of all that is decent or of good report, have decided this queſtion in a very ſummary way, by decreeing death to be an eternal ſleep ;&nbsp;a decree equally abſurd in itſelf and fatal in its conſequences. Since this article went to the preſs, however, we&nbsp;have learned, from the moſt reſpectable authority, that wild and abſurd as the opinion is, it has been induſtriouſly&nbsp;propagated in this country, and that in ſome places it has gained ground. The conſequences of this, were it to&nbsp;become general, muſt indeed be baneful beyond all conception; and we ſhall afterwards take occafion to expoſe the&nbsp;opinion and its nefarious conſequences at greater length than it is now poſſible to do in this place.
