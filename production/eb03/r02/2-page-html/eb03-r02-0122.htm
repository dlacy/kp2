<p><span class="font0">Γuch a terror into the Romans, that ſcarce any perſon durſt oppoſe him; and therefore, as he hated Collatinus,&nbsp;he openly accuſed him before the people, and without&nbsp;ceremony depoſed him from the Conſulſhip, baniſhing&nbsp;him at the ſame time from Rome. The multitude ac-quieſeed in every thing he ſaid, and refuſed to hear&nbsp;Collatinus ſpeak in his own defence ; ſo that the conſul was on the point of being driven out with ignominy&nbsp;and diſgrace, when Lucretius interpoſed, and prevailed&nbsp;upon Brutus to allow his colleague quietly to reſign&nbsp;the faſees, and retire of his own accord from the city.&nbsp;Brutus then, to remove all ſuſpicions of perſortal enmity, procured him a preſent of 20 talents out of the&nbsp;public treaſury, to which he added five of his own.&nbsp;Collatinus then retired to Lavinium, where he lived in&nbsp;peace, and at laſt died of old age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">After the abdication of Collatinus, Valerius was choſen in his room; and as his temper agreed much better ιvith Brutus than that of Collatinus, the two conſuls lived in great harmony. Nothing,however, could make the&nbsp;dethroned king forego the hope of recovering his kingdom by force. He firſt engaged the Volſci and Tar-quinienſes to join their forces in order to ſupport his&nbsp;rights. The conſuls marched out without delay to meet&nbsp;them. Brutus commanded the horſe and Valerius the&nbsp;foot, drawn up in a ſquare battalion. The two armies&nbsp;being in fight of each other, Brutus advanced with his&nbsp;cavalry, at the ſame time that A unx, one of Tarquin’s&nbsp;ſons, was coming forward with the enemy’s horſe, the&nbsp;king himſelf following with the legions. Arunx no&nbsp;ſooner diſcovered Brutus, than he made towards him&nbsp;with all the ſury of an enraged enemy. Brutus advanced towards him with no leſs ſpeed ; and as both&nbsp;were actuated only by motives of hatred, without&nbsp;thoughts of ſelſepreſervation, both of them were pierced&nbsp;through with their lances. The death of the two generals ſerved as a prelude to the battle, which continued&nbsp;with the utmoſt ſury till night, when it could not be&nbsp;known which ſide had got the victory, or which had</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">loſt the greateſt number of men. A report was ſpread, however, that a voice had been heard out of a neighbouring wood, declaring the Romans conquerors ; and&nbsp;this, probably a ſtratagem of Valerius, operated ſo&nbsp;powerfully on the ſuperſtitious minds of the Volſci,&nbsp;that they left their camp in confuſion, and returned to&nbsp;their own country. It is ſaid that Valerius, having&nbsp;cauſed the dead to be numbered, found that the Volſci&nbsp;had loſt 11,300 men, and the Romans only one ſhort&nbsp;of that number.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Valerius being left without a colleague in the con-ſulſhip, and having ſor ſome reaſons delayed to chooſe one, began to be ſuſpected by the people of aſpiring&nbsp;at the ſovereignty ; and theſe ſuſpicions were in ſome&nbsp;meaſure countenanced by his building a fine houſe on&nbsp;the ſteep part of the hill Palatinus, which overlooked&nbsp;the forum, and was by them conſidered as a citadel.&nbsp;But of this Valerius was no ſooner informed, than he&nbsp;cauſed this houſe to be pulled down, and immediately&nbsp;called an aſſembly of the people for the election of a&nbsp;conſul, in which he left them entirely free. They choſe&nbsp;Lucretius ; and, being aſhamed of having ſuſpected Valerius, they complimented him with a large ground-plot in an agreeable place, where they built him a&nbsp;houſe. The new conſul died a few days after his promotion, ſo that Valerius was once more left ſole go</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">vernor. In the interval betwixt the death of Lucretius and the choice of another conſul, Valerius gave the people ſo many ſtriking proofs of his attachment&nbsp;to their intereſt, that they beſtowed upon him the ſur-name of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Poplicola</span><span class="font0"> or “ popular j” nor was he ever call&lt;&nbsp;ed by another name afterwards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When Poplſeola’s year of conſulſhip expired, the Romans thought fit, in conſequence of the critical ſituation of affairs, to elect him a ſecond time, and joined with him T. Lucretius, the brother of the famous Lucretia. They began with reſtoring the cenfus and luſtrum ; and found the number of Roman citizens, at&nbsp;or above the age of puberty, to amount to 130,000.&nbsp;As they apprehended an attack from the Latins on account of Tarquin, they were at great pains to fortify&nbsp;Sinquirinum or Siugliuria, an important poſt on that&nbsp;ſide. Contrary to their expectations, however, the Latins remained quiet ; but an haughty embaſſy was received from Porſena king of Cluſium in Hetruria, commanding them either to take back the Tarquins to&nbsp;Rome, or to reſtore them their eſtates. To the firſt&nbsp;of theſe demands the conſuls returned an abſolute refuſal : and, as to the ſecond, they anſwered, that it was&nbsp;impracticable ; a part of thoſe eſtates having been conſecrated to Mars, and the reſt divided among indigent&nbsp;people, from whom they could not be recovered. The&nbsp;imminent danger which now threatened the city, procured Valerius the honour of a third conſulſhip ; and&nbsp;with him was joined Horatius Pulvilius, who had en</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">joyed the dignity for a few months before in the inter’ val betwixt the death of Lucretius and the expiration of&nbsp;the firſt conſulate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">While the Romans were making the moſt vigorous preparations for defence, Porſena, attended by his ſon&nbsp;Arunx and the exiles, marched towards the city at the&nbsp;head of a formidable army, which was quickly joined&nbsp;by a conſiderable body of Latins under Mamilius, the&nbsp;ſon-in law of Tarquin. The conſuls and the ſenate&nbsp;took all imaginable care to ſupply the common people&nbsp;with proviſions, leſt famine ſhould induce them to open&nbsp;the gates to Tarquin ; and they deſired the country&nbsp;people to lodge their effects in the fort Janiculum,&nbsp;which overlooked the city, and which was the only </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">for-</span><span class="font0">tified place poſſeſſed by the Romans on that ſide the&nbsp;Tiber. Porſena, however, ſoon drove the Romans out&nbsp;of this fort ; upon which the conſuls made all their&nbsp;troops paſs the river, and drew them up in order of&nbsp;battle to defend the bridge, while Porſena advanced to&nbsp;engage them. The victory was a long time doubtful j&nbsp;but at laſt the Romans fled. Horatius Codes, nephew&nbsp;to the conſul, with Sp. Lartius and T. Herminius,&nbsp;who had commanded the right-wing, poſted themſelves&nbsp;at the entrance of the bridge, and for a long time&nbsp;bravely defended it: but at laſt, the defenſive arms of&nbsp;Lartius and Herminius being broken, they retired; and&nbsp;then Horatius deſiring them to adviſe the conſuls from&nbsp;him to cut the bridge at the other end, he for a while&nbsp;ſuſtained the attack of the enemy alone. At laſt, being wounded in the thigh, and the ſignal given that&nbsp;the bridge was almoſt broken down, he leaped into&nbsp;the river, and ſwam acroſs it through a ſhower of darts.&nbsp;The Romans, in token of gratitude for this eminent&nbsp;ſervice, erected a ſtatue to him in the temple of Vulcan,&nbsp;gave him as much land as he himſelf with one yoke of&nbsp;oxen could plough in one day ; and each of the inha-</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
