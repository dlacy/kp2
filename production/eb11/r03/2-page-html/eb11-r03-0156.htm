<p><span class="font1">is due to a resemblance in shape. Rockets are used in pyrotechny for purpose of display, scattering showers of&nbsp;stars, coloured balls, &amp;c., on bursting (see </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Fireworks).</span><span class="font1"> They&nbsp;are also used in signalling, and especially as a part of lifesaving apparatus for wrecks (see </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lifeboat</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Life-Saving&nbsp;Service).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Large and heavy rockets, of which the head formed a projectile, had too a considerable vogue in the early part of the 19th century for war purposes. They were invented by Sir&nbsp;William Congreve </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.vf</span><span class="font1"> and employed by him both afloat in&nbsp;coast operations and in field operations. Brought to the&nbsp;notice of all armies by the fact that a rocket battery of the&nbsp;Royal Artillery served in the allied army in the Leipzig campaign, war rockets were introduced in many armies, being&nbsp;sometimes issued as an additional portion of the equipment&nbsp;of ordinary field batteries, sometimes reserved for special&nbsp;rocket batteries. The Congreve rocket was in use in the&nbsp;British army as late as i860. There were four natures—&nbsp;3-pounder, 6-pounder, 12-pounder and 24-pounder. The case&nbsp;was of sheet-iron, on to which was screwed a cylindro-conoidal&nbsp;head forming the projectile. The head was made hollow and&nbsp;could be filled with a bursting charge if a shell effect was&nbsp;desired, a base fuze being provided. The iron case contained&nbsp;the rocket composition, and </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font1">closed at the rear end by a&nbsp;metal plate with five holes or vents, and on the centre a bush&nbsp;into which the stick was screwed. These rockets were fired&nbsp;from rocket tubes on tripods, the tubes being provided with a&nbsp;tangent sight. Against masses of troops within easy range,&nbsp;the war rocket was considered an efficient engine; it was&nbsp;used also to set fire to buildings, but was always deficient&nbsp;in accuracy. Eventually the Congreve rocket was superseded&nbsp;by the Hale, of which two patterns were in use, the 9-pounder&nbsp;and the 24-pounder, for field and fortress warfare respectively.&nbsp;These had no sticks, and were centred by the arrangement&nbsp;of the vent, the gases, as they emerged from the vent, impinging upon a screw-formed tail, to which they imparted the&nbsp;necessary rotation. These rockets were fired from a trough.&nbsp;The maximum effective range of the 9-pounder Hale rocket&nbsp;was about 1200 yards. The use of these engines was discontinued in the British service about 1885. On the continent of Europe they had disappeared more than twenty&nbsp;years before. Austria, the last power to use them, broke up&nbsp;her rocket batteries in 1867.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">ROCKINGHAM, CHARLES WATSON WENTWORTH, 2ND</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">marquess of</span><span class="font1"> (1730-1782), twice prime minister of England, was the son of Thomas Watson Wentworth (c. 1690-1750),&nbsp;who was created earl of Melton in 1733 and marquess of Rockingham in 1746. The family of Watson was descended from&nbsp;Sir Lewis Watson (1584-1653), son and heir of Sir Edward&nbsp;Watson (d. 1616) of Rockingham Castle in Northamptonshire.&nbsp;For his services to the king during the Civil War Sir Lewis&nbsp;was created Baron Rockingham in 1645. His grandson Lewis,&nbsp;the 3rd baron (1655-1724), was created earl of Rockingham&nbsp;in 1714, and was succeeded by his grandson Lewis (c. 1709-1745), whose brother Thomas, the 3rd earl, died unmarried&nbsp;in February 1746, when the earldom became extinct.

The vast&nbsp;estates of the Wentworths had passed to Edward’s son, Thomas,&nbsp;who took the additional name of Wentworth, and then to his&nbsp;son, the ist marquess of Rockingham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Charles Watson Wentworth was born in 1730 on the 19th of March (according to some, the 13th of May), and was educated&nbsp;at Westminster school and St John’s College, Cambridge.&nbsp;He showed his spirit as a boy by riding across from Wentworth&nbsp;to Carlisle in 1746 to join the duke of Cumberland in his pursuit&nbsp;of the Young Pretender. He was created earl of Malton in&nbsp;the peerage of Ireland in September 1750, and succeeded his&nbsp;father as 2nd marquess of Rockingham in December of the&nbsp;same year. In 1751^he became lord-lieutenant of the North&nbsp;and East Ridings of Yorkshire and a lord of the bedchamber,&nbsp;and in 1760 was made a knight of the Garter. After George III.&nbsp;had begun his policy of dividing the great Whig families, those&nbsp;Whig noblemen and gentlemen who did not choose to join&nbsp;the sections headed by the Grenvilles, the duke of Bedford,&nbsp;or any other great noblemen, selected as their chief the young&nbsp;marquess of Rockingham.
