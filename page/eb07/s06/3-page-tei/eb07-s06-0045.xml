Great miseries were suffered by the people, from the excesses of every kind committed by the French troops, and their heavy requisitions and exactions. The small canton of Unterwalden refused to swear fidelity to the new constitution of the Helvetic republic, but after a desperate struggle it was subdued ; the inhabitants were massacred without distinction of sex or age ; and that district, once peaceful and happy, was left a scene of horrible desolation. During the campaign of 1799, Switzerland was the theatre of the struggle between the great powers of Austria, Russia, and France. The mountain cantons were in consequence utterly ruined, a considerable part of the country rendered uncultivated, and the population reduced to little short of actual starvation. The Helvetic directory was suppressed in 1800, and an executive commission substituted in its room ; and about seven months after, this commission dissolved the councils and convoked a new legislature. A general diet was called in September 1801, for the purpose of re-organizing thc constitution of the country. Meanwhile the treaty which was signed at Luneville between France and Austria, guaranteed the independence of the Helvetic republic, and the French troops were consequently ordered to evacuate Switzerland. Their departure was the signal for a general revolt. All the old factions were awakened afresh. The Pays de Vaud formed itself into a single republic ; Uri, Schwytz, and Unterwalden took up arms against the Helvetian government ; and the towns of Zürich, Basel, and Schaffhausen renounced their allegiance. A civil war appeared inevitable, when Napoleon Bonaparte offered himself as arbitrator between the contending parties, and ordered Marshal Ney to advance with a body of troops to the frontiers of Switzerland to enforce compliance with his mandates. The existing government was dissolved, a provisional government established, and deputies from all thc cantons were ordered to assemble at Paris to deliberate upon a constitution for their country. Several months were spent in debates ; and Napoleon, after he had heard and reflected on their representations, promulgated an act of mediation, which appears to have been drawn up with a view of reconciling opposite factions, and of fairly meeting various interests. It restored the old federative system, but introduced very considerable improvements. The act of mediation was promulgated 19th February 1803 ; and the Helvetic general government having been dissolved, and the new constitution put in force, the French troops finally evacuated the country.</p><p>From that time till 1814 Switzerland enjoyed internal peace ; and during the gigantic wars which at that momentous period raged throughout Europe, this country rested in security amid the din of battles and the crash of falling empires, and made rapid progress in the arts of industry, and in the career of intellectual and social improvement. On the downfall of Napoleon the act of mediation was dissolved. The integrity of the country was guaranteed by the congress of Vienna in 1815. The territories formerly dependent on the bishop of Basel, which had been annexed to France, together with Valais, Neuchâtel, and Geneva, were ceded to it as new cantons, and a constitution, based on the act of mediation, was framed for the whole cantons, now amounting to twenty-two. On the 7th of August 1815 the federal compact was finally signed by all the deputies in the diet assembled at Zürich. The deputies then repaired in procession to the cathedral, where they bound themselves by a solemn oath, and in the name of their constituents, to the faithful observance of its enactments.</p><p>During the fifteen years which elapsed from 1815 to 1830, Switzerland enjoyed profound tranquillity. The general condition of the country was prosperous, and education was improved in several districts ; but the civil and criminal laws remained in a defective state ; the press was under a strict censorship, and various anomalies existed in the institutions of many of the cantons. Petitions were from time to time presented for the revision of the constitution of 1814, but were everywhere rejected by the councils. The first alteration of this state of things took place in the canton of Ticino in May and June 1830, and the example was speedily followed by all the other representative cantons of Switzerland. The new constitution established equality of political rights among all the citizens of the state ; the direct system of electing all the members of the legislature, the elections to take place every four years ; separation of the three powers, legislative, executive, and judicial ; publicity of debates ; liberty of the press, subject to fixed laws against libels ; inviolability of person and property, and the right of petition. No tax can be imposed unless it is sanctioned by a majority of two thirds in the great council. The present constitution cannot be modified until twelve years shall have elapsed from its enactment, and then any alterations proposed in it must be submitted to the approval of the primary assemblies of the people. These alterations in their constitution were peaceably adopted by the most of the cantons ; but in some of them popular tumults arose, which however were speedily suppressed by the firmness and prudence of the diet.</p><p>In 1834 the tranquility of Switzerland was endangered by a considerable body of Polish, German, and Italian refugees, who had taken up their residence in Switzerland. In the month of January, some hundreds of these refugees made a sudden attack on the dominions of the king of Sardinia, in expectation of combined attacks and insurrections in other parts of the Sardinian monarchy. The Sardinian government made strong remonstrances to the confederation concerning this violation of the neutrality of the Swiss territory ; and the courts of Austria, Prussia, and other German states, whose territories border on Switzerland, joined in these remonstrances. After some negociations, the matter was brought to an amicable termination by the Swiss governments promising in future to send away from their territory all those who sliould attempt to disturb the tranquillity of the states.</p><p>An attempt was made in the diet of 1832, and again in that of 1834, to procure a revision of the federal pact, but it terminated without any result. The last eight years have been years of severe trial for Switzerland, but she has safely passed through them, and has succeeded in maintaining both lier internal tranquillity and her external independence.</p><p>Switzerland lies between 45° 50' and 47° 40' north latitude, and 6° and 10° 30' east longitude. Its extent from east to west is about 210 miles, and from north to south about 130 miles. Its area is estimated to contain about 11,000 square geographical miles. Switzerland forms part of the high land of central Europe. It rises above the plains of Lombardy on the south, and the plains of Dijon or Burgundy on the west. On the east it is connected by the Alps with the high lands of Tyrol and Bavaria, and on the north it adjoins the elevated plain of Suabia ; from which it is separated only by the bed of the Rhine. It is bounded by mountains on the west, south-west, and east, but is open to the north on the side of Germany. The lower parts of Switzerland are generally more than 1200 feet above the level of the sea, and nearly 1000 feet higher than the plains of Lombardy, but the greater part of the surface is much higher. In point of romantic and picturesque scenery, Switzerland is reckoned the finest country in Europe. It is a singular assemblage of high mountains, deep valleys, rivers, and lakes. Two distinct ranges of mountains traverse Switzerland; the chain of the Jura, which stretches from south-west to north-east, and is about 240 or 250 miles in length, and from thirty-five to forty in breadth ; and the chain of thc Alps, which is much more extensive, and covers the greater part of the country with its nume-</p></body></text></TEI>
