<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">It dispersed, however, without result, war having again broken out between France and Austria. As the French plenipotentiaries&nbsp;were leaving the town they were waylaid and assassinated by&nbsp;Hungarian hussars. The object and instigators of this deed have&nbsp;remained shrouded in mystery, but the balance of evidence seems&nbsp;to indicate that the Austrian authorities had ordered a violent&nbsp;seizure of the ambassadors’ papers, to avoid damaging disclosures&nbsp;with regard to Austrian designs on Bavaria, and that the soldiers&nbsp;had simply exceeded their instructions. The Baden revolution of&nbsp;1849 began at Rastatt with a military mutiny and ended here a&nbsp;few months later with the capture of the town by the Prussians.&nbsp;Rastatt is now a fortress of the German empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">RASTELL, the name of two early English printers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">I. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John Rastell </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Rastall, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">printer and author, was&nbsp;born at London towards the end of the 15th century.&nbsp;He was educated at Oxford, and married Elizabeth, the&nbsp;sister of Sir Thomas More. He was a man of considerable&nbsp;learning and, although not bred to the law like his son,&nbsp;showed his devotion to legal studies by his writings. He&nbsp;went into the printing business about the year 1514, and&nbsp;produced </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Liber assisarum</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">, with a preface by himself. His&nbsp;first dated publication was </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Abbreviamentum librorum legum&nbsp;Anglorum</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1517). He also printed </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Wydow Edyth&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">(1525), </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A Dyaloge of Syr Thomas More</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1529), and a&nbsp;number of other books. The last dated piece from his&nbsp;press was </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Fabyl’s Ghoste</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1533), a poem. He lived “at&nbsp;the sygne of the meremayd at Powlysgate. ” John Rastell,&nbsp;the Jesuit, who has been frequently confounded with him,&nbsp;was no relation. By his will, dated 20th April 1536, he&nbsp;appointed Henry VIII. one of his executors; administration was granted on the renunciation of the executorship&nbsp;by the king on 18th July 1536. It is a curious document,&nbsp;and contains a long account of the testator’s religious&nbsp;belief. Rastell was occupied upon a concordance at the&nbsp;time of his death; its publication was provided for by the&nbsp;will (see Arber’s </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Registers of Comp, of Stationers,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> ii. 8, 9).&nbsp;He died at London, leaving two sons, —William, printer&nbsp;and judge (see below), and John, a justice of the peace. </span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Rastell’s chief writings are the following. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Pastyme of People; the Chronycles of dyuers Realmys and most specyally of the&nbsp;Rcalme of Englonde</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1529), now of extreme rarity; a note in the&nbsp;catalogue of the British Museum says, “the only perfect copy&nbsp;known. ” It ranges from the earliest times to Richard III., and&nbsp;was edited by Dibdin in 1811 for the quarto series of English&nbsp;chronicles. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A new Boke of Purgatory,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> 1530, being dialogues on&nbsp;the subject between “Comyngo au Almayne a Christen Man, and&nbsp;one Gyngemyn a Turke. ” This was answered by John Frith, producing Rastell’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Apology against John Fryth,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> also answered by the&nbsp;latter. The controversy is said to have ended in Rastell’s conversion to the Reformed religion. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Expositioncs terminorum legum&nbsp;anglorum</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> (in French, also translated into English, 1527; reprinted&nbsp;as recently as 1812 as </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Lcs Termes de la Ley). The Abbreviacion&nbsp;of Statutis</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1520), the first abridgment of the statutes in English,&nbsp;with an interesting preface by Rastell, giving reasons for the innovation; down to 1625 fifteen editions appeared.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">II.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">William Rastell </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">(c. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">1508-1565), printer and judge,&nbsp;son of the above, was born in London about 1508. At&nbsp;the age of seventeen he went to the university of Oxford,&nbsp;but did not take a degree, being probably called home to&nbsp;superintend his father’s business. The first work which&nbsp;bears his own imprint was </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A Dyaloge of Sir Thomas More&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">(1531), a reprint of the edition published by his father in&nbsp;1529. He also brought out a few law books, some poetry,&nbsp;an edition of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Fabyaris Cronycle</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1533), and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Apologye&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">(1533) and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Supplycacyon of Soulys</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> of his uncle Sir&nbsp;Thomas More. His office was “ in Fletestrete in saynt&nbsp;Brydys chyrche yarde. ” He became a student at Lincoln’s&nbsp;Inn on 12th September 1532, and gave up the printing&nbsp;business two years later. In 1547 he was appointed&nbsp;reader. On account of his religion he left England for&nbsp;Louvain; but upon the accession of Mary he returned,&nbsp;and was made sergeant-at-law in October 1555. He was&nbsp;one of the seven sergeants who gave the famous feast that&nbsp;year in the Inner Temple Hall (see Dugdale’s </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Orig. Jurid.,&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">1680, p. 128). His patent as judge of the Queen’s Bench</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">was granted on 27th October 1558. One of his predecessors, John Boteler, had also been printer and judge. Rastell continued on the bench until 1562, when he retired&nbsp;to Louvain without the queen’s licence. By virtue of a&nbsp;special commission issued by the barons of the Exchequer&nbsp;on the occasion an inventory of his goods and chattels was&nbsp;taken. It furnishes an excellent idea of the modest nature&nbsp;of the law library (consisting of twenty-four works) and of&nbsp;the chambers of an Elizabethan judge (see </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Law Magazine,&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">February 1844). He died at Louvain on 27th August 1565.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">It is difficult to distinguish between the books written by him and those by his father. The following are believed to be his: </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A&nbsp;Collecdon of all the Statutes</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1557), </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A Table collected of the Yeares of&nbsp;the Kynges of Englande</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1561), both frequently reprinted witli continuations, and </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A Colleccion of Entrees, of Declaracions,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> &amp;c. (1566),&nbsp;also frequently reprinted. The entries are not of Rastell’s own&nbsp;drawing, but have been selected from printed and MS. collections;&nbsp;their “ pointed brevity and precision ” are commended by Story.&nbsp;He supplied tables or indexes to several law books, and edited </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">La&nbsp;novel natura brevium de Monsieur Anton. Fitzherbert</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The&nbsp;Workes of Sir T. More in the English Tonge</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1557). He is also&nbsp;stated to have written a life of Sir T. More, but it has not come&nbsp;down to us.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">RASTRICK, an urban sanitary district in the West Riding of Yorkshire, is situated on an acclivity near the&nbsp;Calder, and on the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway 5&nbsp;miles south-east of Halifax and 3½ north of Huddersfield.&nbsp;It possesses woollen and silk manufactures, and there are&nbsp;stone quarries in the neighbourhood. The ancient chapel&nbsp;of St Matthew was replaced in 1798 by a church in the&nbsp;Grecian style, which was restored in 1879. A school was&nbsp;founded in 1701 by Mrs Mary Law, who also endowed a&nbsp;charity for poor widows. The population of the urban&nbsp;sanitary district (area, 1371 acres) in 1871 was 5896, and&nbsp;in 1881 it was 8039.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">RAT. Under the article </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Mouse </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">(vol. xvii. p. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">5) </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">an account has been already given of the relationships and&nbsp;chief allies of the animals known as rats, and the present&nbsp;article is confined to the two species to which the name&nbsp;rat is most strictly applicable. These are the so-called&nbsp;old English black rat, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Mus rattus,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> and the common brown&nbsp;or Norway rat, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">M. decumanus.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> The first of these is a comparatively small&nbsp;and lightly built animal, seldom&nbsp;exceeding about&nbsp;7 inches in length,&nbsp;with a slender&nbsp;head, large ears&nbsp;(see fig., A), and&nbsp;a long thin scaly&nbsp;tail about 8 or 9&nbsp;inches in length.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Its colour is, at least in all temperate climates, a&nbsp;peculiar shining&nbsp;bluish black,&nbsp;rather lighter on&nbsp;the belly, the&nbsp;ears, feet, and&nbsp;tail being also&nbsp;black; but in tropical regions it is represented by a grey&nbsp;or rufous-backed and white-bellied race to which the&nbsp;name of Alexandrian rat (</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">M. alexandrinus)</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> has been&nbsp;applied, owing to its having been first discovered at&nbsp;Alexandria, but which cannot be considered to be really&nbsp;specifically distinct from the true black rat.
