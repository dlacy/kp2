(Sir Philip), was born, as is ſuppoſed, at Penſhurſt in Kent in the year 1554: His father was Sir Henry Sidney, an Iriſh gentleman, and his mother Mary the eldeſt daughter of John Dudley duke of Northumberland. He was ſent when very young to Chriſt- church college at Oxford, but left the univerſity at 17 to ſet out on his travels. After visiting France, Germany, Hungary, and Italy, he returned to England in 1575, and was next year ſent by Queen Elizabeth as her ambaſſador to Randolph emperor of Germany. On his return he viſited Don John of Auſtria, governor of the Netherlands, by whom he was received with great reſpect. In 1579, when Queen Elizabeth ſeemed on the point of concluding her long projected marriage with the duke of Anjou, Sir Philip wrote her a letter, in which he diſſuaded her from the match with unuſual elegance of expreſſion, as well as force of reaſoning, About this time a quarrel with the earl of Oxford occaſioned his withdrawing from court ; during which retirement he is ſuppoſed to have written his celebrated romance called <hi rend="italic">Arcadia.</hi></p><p>In 1585, after the queen’s treaty with the United States, he was made governor of Fluſhing and maſter of the horſe. Here he diſtinguiſhed himſelf ſo much both by his courage and conduct, that his reputation roſe to the higheſt pitch. He was named, it is pretended, by the republic of Poland as one of the competitors for that crown, and might even have been elected had it not been for the interference of the queen. But his illustrious career was ſoon terminated ; for in 1586 he was wounded at the battle of Zutphen, and carried to Arnheim, where he soon after died. His body was brought to London, and buried in St Paul’s cathedral. He is deſcribed by the writers of that age as the moſt perfect model of an accompliſhed gentleman that could be formed even by the wanton imagination of poetry or fiction. Virtuous conduct, polite converſation, heroic va-<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0468.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s04-0462"/>
lour, and elegant erudition, all concurred to render him the ornament and delight of the Engliſh court : and as the credit which he enjoyed with the queen and the earl of Leiceſter was wholly employed in the encouragement of genius and literature, his praiſes have been tranſmitted with advantage to poſterity. No perſon was ſo low as not to become an object of his humanity. After the battle of Zutphen, while he was lying on the field mangled with wounds, a bottle of water was brought him to relieve his thirſt ; but obſerving a ſoldier near him in a like miſerable condition, he ſaid, <hi rend="italic">This man's necessity is ſtill greater than mine ;</hi> and reſigned to him the bottle of water. Beſides his <hi rend="italic">Arcadia,</hi> he wrote ſeveral ſmaller pieces both in proſe and verſe, which have been publiſhed.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sidney</hi> (Algernon), was the ſecond ſon of Robert earl of Leiceſter, and of Dorothy eldest daughter of the earl of Northumberland. He was born about the year 1617. During the civil wars he took part againſt the king, and diſtinguished himſelf as a colonel in the army of the parliament. He was afterwards appointed one of king Charles’s judges, but declined appearing in that court. During the uſurpation of Cromwel, Sidney, who was a violent republican, retired to the country, and ſpent his time in writing thoſe diſcourſes on government which have been ſo deſervedly celebrated. After the death of the Protector, he again took part in the public tranſactions of his country, and was abroad on an embaſſy to Denmark when king Charles was reſtored. Upon this he retired to Hamburgh, and afterwards to Francfort, where he reſided till 1677, when he returned to England and obtained from the king a pardon. It has been affirmed, but the ſtory deserves no credit, that during his residence abroad king Charles hired ruffians to asſaſſinate him. After his return he made repeated attempts to procure a seat in parliament, but all of them proved unſucceſsful. After the intention of the commons to ſeclude the duke of York from the throne had been defeated by the ſudden diſſolution of parliament, Sidney joined with eagerneſs the councils of Russel, Eſſex, and Monmouth, who had reſolved to oppoſe the duke’s ſucceſſion by force of arms. Frequent-meetings were held at London; while, at the same time, a let of ſubordinate conſpirators, who were not, however, admitted into their confidence, met and embraced the moſt deſperate reſolutions. Keiling, one of theſe men, diſcovered the whole conſpiracy ; and Algernon Sidney, together with his noble aſſociates, was immediately thrown into priſon, and no art was left unattempted in order to involve them in the guilt of the meaner conſpirators.</p><p>Howard, an abandoned nobleman, without a ſingle ſpark of virtue or honour, was the only witneſs againſt Sidney ; but as the law required two, his diſcourſes on government, found unpubliſhed in his cloſet, were conſtrued into treaſon, and declared equivalent to another witneſs. It was in vain for Sidney to plead that papers were no legal evidence ; that it could not be proved they were written by him ; and that if they were, they contained nothing treaſonable. The defence was over ruled ; he was declared guilty, condemned, and executed ! His attainder was reverſed in the firſt year of king William.</p><p>He was a man of extraordinary courage ; ſteady even to obſtinacy ; of a ſincere but rough and boiſterous</p><p>temper. Though he proſeſſed his belief in the Christian religion, he was an enemy to an eſtabliſhed church, and even, according to Burnet, to every kind of public worſhip. In his principles he was a zealous republican: government was always his favourite ſtudy ; and his eſsays on that ſubject are a proof of the progreſs which he made.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
