It remains to say that the moral&nbsp;characteristics of the Ruff exceed even anything that&nbsp;might be inferred from what has been already stated.&nbsp;By no one have they been more happily described than by&nbsp;Wolley, in a communication to Hewitson </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">{Eggs of Brit.&nbsp;Birds,</span><span class="font2"> 3d ed., p. 346), as follows : —</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“The Ruff, like other fine gentlemen, takes much more trouble with his courtship than with his duties as a husband. Whilst the&nbsp;Reeves are sitting on their eggs, scattered about the swamps, he&nbsp;is to be seen far away flitting about in flocks, and on the ground&nbsp;dancing and sparring with his companions. Before they are confined to their nests, it is wonderful with what devotion the&nbsp;females are attended by their gay followers, who seem to be each&nbsp;trying to be more attentive than the rest. Nothing can be more&nbsp;expressive of humility and ardent love than some of the actions of&nbsp;the Ruff. He throws himself prostrate on the ground, with every&nbsp;feather on his body standing up and quivering ; but he seems as&nbsp;if he were afraid of coming too near his mistress. If she flies off,&nbsp;he starts up in an instant to arrive before her at the next place of&nbsp;alighting, and all his actions are full of life and spirit. But none&nbsp;of his spirit is expended in care for his family. He never comes to&nbsp;see after an enemy. In the [Lapland] marshes, a Reeve now and&nbsp;then flies near with a scarcely audible </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ka-ka-kuk</span><span class="font1"> ; but she seems a&nbsp;dull bird, and makes no noisy attack on an invader.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Want of space forbids a fuller account of this extremely interesting species. Its breeding-grounds extend from&nbsp;Great Britain@@<sup>1</sup> across northern Europe and Asia ; but the&nbsp;birds become less numerous towards the east. They&nbsp;winter in India, reaching even Ceylon, and Africa as far&nbsp;as the Cape of Good Hope. The Ruff also occasionally&nbsp;visits Iceland, and there are several well-authenticated&nbsp;records of its occurrence on the eastern coast of the&nbsp;United States, while an example is stated </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">{Ibis,</span><span class="font2"> 1875, p.&nbsp;332) to have been received from the northern part of&nbsp;South America.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">(a. n.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RUFINUS, </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tykannius (Turkanius, Toranus),</span><span class="font2"> the well-known contemporary of Jerome, was born at or near&nbsp;Aquileia about the year 345. In early life he studied&nbsp;rhetoric, and while still comparatively young he entered&nbsp;the cloister as a catechumen, receiving baptism about 370.&nbsp;About the same time a casual visit of Jerome to Aquileia&nbsp;led to the formation of a close and intimate friendship&nbsp;between the two students, and shortly after Jerome’s&nbsp;departure for the East Rufinus also was drawn thither (in&nbsp;372 or 373) by his interest in its theology and monasticism.&nbsp;He first settled in Egypt, hearing the lectures of Didymus,&nbsp;the Origenistic teacher at Alexandria, and also cultivating&nbsp;friendly relations with Macarius and other ascetics in the&nbsp;desert. In Egypt, if not even before leaving Italy, he had&nbsp;become intimately acquainted with Melania, a wealthy and&nbsp;devout Roman matron, who since the death of her husband&nbsp;had devoted all her means to religious and charitable&nbsp;works ; and when she removed to Palestine, taking with&nbsp;her a number of clergy and monks on whom the persecutions of Valens had borne heavily, Rufinus ultimately&nbsp;(about 378) followed her. While his patroness lived in a&nbsp;convent of her own in Jerusalem, Rufinus, in close cooperation with her and at her expense, gathered together a&nbsp;number of monks in a monastery on the Mount of Olives,&nbsp;devoting himself at the same time with much ardour to&nbsp;the study of Greek theology. When Jerome came to reside&nbsp;at Bethlehem in 386 the friendship formed at AquiIeia was&nbsp;renewed. Another of the intimates of Rufinus was John,&nbsp;bishop of Jerusalem, and formerly a Nitrian monk, by&nbsp;whom he was ordained to the priesthood in 390. In 394,&nbsp;in consequence of the attack upon the doctrines of Origen&nbsp;made by Epiphanius of Salamis during a visit to&nbsp;Jerusalem, a fierce quarrel broke out, which found Rufinus&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">and Jerome ranged on different</span><span class="font2"> sides; and, though three</span></p>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@1</sup> In England of late years it has been known to breed only in one locality, the name or situation of which it is not desirable to publish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">years afterwards a formal reconciliation was brought about between Jerome and John through the intervention of&nbsp;third parties, the breach between Jerome and Rufinus remained unhealed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the autumn of 397 Rufinus embarked for Rome, where, finding that the theological controversies of the East&nbsp;were exciting much interest and curiosity, he published a&nbsp;Latin translation of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Apology</span><span class="font2"> of Pamphilus for Origen,&nbsp;and also (398-399) a somewhat free rendering of the&nbsp;7rept αρχών of that author himself. In the preface to the&nbsp;latter work he had referred to Jerome as an admirer of&nbsp;Origen, and as having already translated some of his works ;&nbsp;this allusion proved very annoying to the subject of it,&nbsp;who was now exceedingly sensitive as to his reputation&nbsp;for orthodoxy, and the consequence was a bitter pamphlet&nbsp;war, very wonderful to the modern onlooker, who finds it&nbsp;difficult to see anything discreditable in the accusation&nbsp;against a Biblical scholar that he had once thought well of&nbsp;Origen, or in the countercharge against a translator that&nbsp;he had avowedly exercised editorial functions as well.&nbsp;Some time during the pontificate of Anastasius (398-402)&nbsp;Rufinus was summoned from Aquileia to Rome to vindicate&nbsp;his orthodoxy, but he excused himself from personal&nbsp;attendance in a written </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Apologia pro fide sua</span><span class="font2"> ; the pope in&nbsp;his reply expressly condemned Origen, but leniently left&nbsp;the question of Rufinus’s orthodoxy to his own conscience.&nbsp;In 408 we find Rufinus at the monastery of Pinetum (in&nbsp;the Campagna?); thence he was driven by the arrival of&nbsp;Alaric to Sicily, being accompanied by Melania in his&nbsp;flight. In Sicily he was engaged in translating the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Homilies</span><span class="font2"> of Origen when he died in 410.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">RUGBY, a market-town of Warwickshire, is finely situated on a table-land rising from the southern bank of&nbsp;the Avon, at the junction of several railway lines, and&nbsp;near the Grand Junction Canal, 30 miles E.S.E. of&nbsp;Birmingham, and 20 S.S.W. of Leicester. It is a well-built town, with a large number of modern houses erected&nbsp;for private residences. It occupies C, gravel site, is well&nbsp;drained, and has a good supply of water. It owes its&nbsp;importance to the grammar school, built and endowed by&nbsp;Laurence Sheriff, a merchant grocer and servant to Queen&nbsp;Elizabeth, and a native of the neighbouring village of&nbsp;Brownsover. The endowment consisted of the parsonage of&nbsp;Brownsover, Sheriff’s mansion house in Rugby, and one-third (8 acres) of his estate in Middlesex, near the Foundling Hospital, London, which, being let on building leases,&nbsp;gradually increased to about £5000 a year.
