<p><span class="font0">liberties at an earlier period. The charter of 1145 gave the burgesses the borough of Richmond to hold for ever in fee farm at an annual&nbsp;rent of £29. Other charters were granted by Earl Conan in 1150,&nbsp;by Earl John II. in 1268 and by Edward III. (the first royal charter)&nbsp;in 1328, and confirmed in subsequent reigns. A charter of incorporation was granted by Queen Elizabeth under the title of aider-men and burgesses in 1576, and another by Charles II. in 1668 under&nbsp;the name of mayor and aldermen. This last, though superseded later,&nbsp;was restored in the reign of James II. and, until the passing of the&nbsp;Municipal Reform Act of 1835, was regarded as the governing&nbsp;charter of the borough. Although Richmond received a summons as&nbsp;early as 1328, it was not represented in parliament until 1584, from&nbsp;which time it usually sent two members, ln 1867 the number was&nbsp;reduced to one. Since 1885 the representation has been merged in&nbsp;the Richmond division of the North Riding. The charter of Earl&nbsp;John II. points to the existence of a market before 1268, but there is&nbsp;no grant of it extant. In 1278, Edward I. granted the same earl a&nbsp;yearly fair to be held at Richmond from the 3rd to the 16th of September inclusive. Queen Elizabeth granted the burgesses a market&nbsp;every Saturday, a market every fortnight for animals and a fair&nbsp;each year on the vigil of Palm Sunday. At one time there appear to&nbsp;have been as many as four annual fairs. There is now only one,&nbsp;which takes place on the 2nd and 3rd of November. The weekly&nbsp;market is still held on Saturday, and there is a fortnightly market for&nbsp;cattle. In the middle ages Richmond had an important market for&nbsp;corn and wool. There is evidence later of traffic in lead, and also of&nbsp;a flourishing manufacture of hand-knitted stockings. As the town&nbsp;possesses the only railway station in Swaledale, the market is still of&nbsp;consequence. But the stocking industry decayed with the introduction of machinery. William the Lion of Scotland was imprisoned&nbsp;in the castle in the reign of Hemy 11., but otherwise the town owes its&nbsp;importance chiefly to its lords. The honour was a valuable possession&nbsp;in the middle ages, and it was usually in royal or semi-royal hands.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RICHMOND, the capital of Virginia, U.S.A., the county-seat of Henrico county, and a port of entry, on the James river (at the head of navigation), about 100 m. S. by W. of&nbsp;Washington, D.C., and about 125 m. by water from the Atlantic&nbsp;Ocean. Pop. (1850) 27,570; (i860) 37,910; (1870) 51,038;&nbsp;(1880) 63,600; (1890) 81,388; (1900)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85,050, of whom</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">32,230 were negroes and 2865 were foreign-born; (1910 census) 127,628. Richmond is served by the Atlantic Coast&nbsp;Line, the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio, IheSeaboardAirLineTheSouthern&nbsp;and the Richmond, Fredericksburg &amp; Potomac railways, and&nbsp;by the Old Dominion, the Virginia Navigation and the Chesapeake steamship lines. The city has a beautiful situation&nbsp;on the hilly ground (maximum elevation, about 250 ft. above&nbsp;sea-level) along the north and east banks of the James, at a&nbsp;bend where the river changes its south-easterly course for one&nbsp;almost due south. It occupies seven hills, from which fact&nbsp;it has been called “ the Modern Rome.” The western stretch&nbsp;of the river, opposite the city, breaks into rapids which have a&nbsp;fall of about 116 ft. in 9 m. and provide abundant water power.&nbsp;Belle Isle (the site of a Confederate prison camp during the&nbsp;Civil War), about 1/2m long by about 1/4m wide, is in this part&nbsp;of the river; a little farther down stream are a group of small&nbsp;islets, and opposite the south-eastern boundary of the city is&nbsp;Mayo’s Island. Within the city’s lines the river is crossed&nbsp;by two bridges (to Manchester) for vehicles and pedestrians,&nbsp;and three railway bridges. The river has been improved by&nbsp;Federal engineers since 1870; in June 1909 (up to which time&nbsp;$1,799,033 had been expended for improvements) there was&nbsp;a channel 100 ft. wide and 18 ft. deep, nearly continuously&nbsp;from Hampton Roads to the Richmond wharf, and the maximum draft at low water was 16.1 ft.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">About three4ourths of the city’s total street mileage (120 m.) is paved, Belgian block or macadam being used on the principal&nbsp;thoroughfares. About 637-8 acres are devoted to city parks,&nbsp;among which are William Byrd Park (300 acres), in the western part&nbsp;of the city, Joseph Bryan Park (262-6 acres), Chimborazo Park&nbsp;(29 acres), near its eastern boundary, Gambles Hill Park (8-8&nbsp;acres), Monroe Square (7J acres), Jefferson Park (6.3 acres) and&nbsp;Marshall Square (7 acres). The State Capitol Square (10 acres) is&nbsp;not owned by the city. Half a mile N.W. of the city are the Fair&nbsp;Grounds, where a state fair is held annually.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Of Richmond’s public buildings, several have great historic interest. St John’s Episcopal church, built in 1740 (and subsequently much enlarged), is noted especially as the meeting-place of the Virginia Convention of March 1775, before which&nbsp;Patrick Henry made a famous speech, ending, “ I know not&nbsp;what course others may take, but as for me, Give me liberty,&nbsp;or give me death!” The Capitol (begun in 1785 and completed in 1792—the wings were added in 1906) was designed&nbsp;from a model and plans of the Maison Carrée, at Nlmes, supplied by Thomas Jefferson, while he was minister to France.&nbsp;Aaron Burr was tried for treason and then for misdemeanour&nbsp;in this building in 1807, the Virginia secession convention met&nbsp;here in 1861, and during the Civil War the sessions of the Confederate Congress were held here. In its rotunda is Jean&nbsp;Antoine Houdon’s full-length marble statue of Washington,&nbsp;provided for by the Virginia General Assembly in 1784, and&nbsp;erected in 1796; its base bears a fine inscription written by&nbsp;James Madison. In a niche is a Houdon bust of Lafayette,&nbsp;a replica of the original presented to the city of Paris by the&nbsp;state of Virginia. The Old Stone House (the oldest building&nbsp;in the city) was erected as a residence in 1737, and is now used&nbsp;for a museum. Masons’ Hall, whose corner-stone was laid in&nbsp;1785, is said to be the oldest exclusively Masonic building in&nbsp;the United States. The Executive Mansion of the Confederate&nbsp;States of America, built in 1819, purchased by the city in 1862,&nbsp;and leased to the Confederate government and occupied by&nbsp;President Jefferson Davis in 1862-65, was acquired in 1890&nbsp;by the Confederate Memorial Library Society, and is now a&nbsp;Confederate Museum with a room for each state of the Confederacy and a general library in the “ Solid South ” room;&nbsp;it has valuable historical papers, collectedby the Southern&nbsp;Historical Society, and the society has published a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Calendar&nbsp;of Confederate Papers</span><span class="font0"> (1908). The formerresidence of Chief-Justice John Marshall, built in 1795, is still standing; and the&nbsp;Lee-Mansion, which was the war-time residence of General&nbsp;Robert E. Lee’s family, has been occupied, since 1893, by&nbsp;the Virginia Historical Society (organized 1831; reorganized&nbsp;1847) as the repository of a valuable library and collection of&nbsp;portraits of historical interest. Libby Prison, which stood&nbsp;on the northern bank of a canal, near the river, in the eastern&nbsp;part of the city, was taken down in 1888-89, and its materials&nbsp;removed to Chicago, where it was reconstructed, in as nearly&nbsp;as possible its original form, and became the Libby Prison&nbsp;War Museum.@@<sup>1</sup> The Valentine Museum is in a house on&nbsp;Eleventh and Clay Streets, in which Aaron Burr was entertained while he was on trial, and which with $50,000 and his&nbsp;collections was devised to a board of trustees in 1892 by Mann&nbsp;S. Valentine. The museum includes 3300 books, many being&nbsp;of the 15th and 16th centuries, a department of engravings,&nbsp;a Virginia Room with portraits and relics, some tapestries,&nbsp;an excellent collection of casts and valuable Ainerican&nbsp;archaeological specimens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The more modern buildings include the City Hall, a fine granite structure (completed in 1893), with a tower 180 ft. tall;&nbsp;the Library building which houses the state library (about&nbsp;80,000 volumes, with many portraits and a valuable collection&nbsp;of old manuscripts), the State Law Library and also the offices&nbsp;of most of the state officials; the Post-Office and Customs&nbsp;House; the State Penitentiary; the Chamber of Commerce;&nbsp;and, among the religious edifices, the Sacred Heart Cathedral&nbsp;(Roman Catholic), presented to the city by Mr and Mrs Thomas&nbsp;F. Ryan; the Monumental Church, built on the site of the&nbsp;Richmond Theatre, in the burning of which, in 1811, Acting-Governor George W. Smith and fifty-nine others lost their lives;&nbsp;and St Paul’s Church, where Jefferson Davis was attending&nbsp;services, on the 2nd of April 1865, when he received news from</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@1</sup> As built in Richmond, in 1845 by Luther Libby, it was a brick structure, three storeys high in front and four in the rear. It had&nbsp;six rooms, each about 100X45 ft., was used as a tobacco warehouse and a ship-chandlery until 1861, and then until the capture&nbsp;of Richmond was used as a prison, chiefly for Federal officers.&nbsp;Frequently it was terribly overcrowded (by as many as 1200 prisoners at a time), the inmates often suffered great privations, and&nbsp;many died or were physically disabled for the remainder of their&nbsp;lives.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
