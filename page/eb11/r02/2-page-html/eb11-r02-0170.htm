<p><span class="font1">exploited, except for the mineral springs which yield waters highly esteemed. Almost all the products of the island are exported,&nbsp;so that the import trade is very varied. Cattle are imported from&nbsp;Madagascar; rice, the chief article of food, from Saigon and India;&nbsp;petroleum, largely used in manufactories, from America and Russia;&nbsp;almost everything else comes from France, to which country go&nbsp;the great majority of the exports. Over 75% of the shipping is&nbsp;under the French flag.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Commerce.</span><span class="font1">—The total trade amounted in i860 to the value of £4,464,000 (the highest during the century); in 1900, to £1,533,240.&nbsp;In 1905 the imports were valued at £727,000 and the exports at&nbsp;£428,000. Of the imports £500,000 were from France or French&nbsp;colonies; of the exports £388,000 went to France or French colonies.&nbsp;The Currencyconsistsof notes of the Banquede la Réunion (guaranteed by the government) and nickel token money. Neither the notes&nbsp;nor the nickel money have any currency outside Réunion; the rate&nbsp;of exchange varies from 5 to 20%.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Administration and Revenue.—</span><span class="font1">Réunion is regarded practically as a department of France. It sends two deputies and one senator&nbsp;to the French legislature, and is governed by laws passed by that&nbsp;body. All inhabitants, not being aliens, enjoy the franchise, no&nbsp;distinction being made between whites, negroes or mulattoes, all&nbsp;of whom are citizens. At the head of the local administration is&nbsp;a governor who is assisted by a secretary-general, a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">procureur&nbsp;général,</span><span class="font1"> a privy council and a council-general elected by the&nbsp;suffrages of all citizens. The governor has the right of direct&nbsp;communication and negotiation with the government of South&nbsp;Africa and all states east of the Cape. The council-general has wide&nbsp;powers, including the fixing of the budget. For administrative&nbsp;purposes the island is divided into two arrondissements, the Windward, with five cantons and nine communes, and the Leeward,&nbsp;with four cantons and seven communes. The towns are subject&nbsp;to the French municipal law. The revenue, largely dependent on&nbsp;the prosperity of the sugar trade, declined from an average of&nbsp;£163,765 in the five years 1895-99 to an average of £147,225 in the&nbsp;five years 1900-4. For the same periods the average colonial&nbsp;expenditure, whicn includes the loss incurred in maintaining the&nbsp;harbour and railway, increased from £224,508 to £225,088. Deficits are made good by grants from France.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History.—</span><span class="font1">Réunion is usually said to have been first discovered in April 1513 by the Portuguese navigator Pedro Mascarenhas, and his&nbsp;name, or that of Mascarene Islands, is still applied to the archipelago of which it forms a part ; but it seems probable that it must&nbsp;be identified with the island of Santa Apollonia discovered by&nbsp;Diego Fernandes Pereira on the 9th of February 1507. It was&nbsp;visited by the Dutch towards the close of the 16th century, and&nbsp;by the English early in the 17th century. When in 1638 the island&nbsp;was taken possession of by Captain Gaubert, or Gobert, of Dieppe, it&nbsp;was still uninhabited; a more formal annexation in the name of&nbsp;Louis XIIL was effected in 1643 by Jacques Pronis, agent of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Compagnie des Indes</span><span class="font1"> in Madagascar; and in 1649 Étienne de&nbsp;Flacourt, Pronis’s more eminent successor, repeated the ceremony&nbsp;at a spot which he named La Possession. He also changed the&nbsp;name of the island from Mascarenhas to Bourbon. By decree of&nbsp;the Convention in 1793, Bourbon in turn gave place to Réunion,&nbsp;and, though during the empire this was discarded in favour of île&nbsp;Bonaparte, and at the Restoration people naturally went back to&nbsp;Bourbon, Réunion has been the official designation since 1848.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The first inhabitants were a dozen mutineers deported from Madagascar by Pronis, but they remained only three years (1646-49).&nbsp;Other colonists went thither of their own will in 1654 and 1662. In&nbsp;1664 the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Compagnie des Indes orientales de Madagascar,</span><span class="font1"> to whom a&nbsp;concession of the island was granted, initiated a regular colonization&nbsp;scheme. Their first commandant was Étienne Régnault, who in&nbsp;1689 received from the French crown the title of governor. The&nbsp;growth of the colony was very slow, and in 1717 there were only&nbsp;some 2000 inhabitants. It is recorded that they lived on excellent&nbsp;terms with the pirates, who from 1684 onward infested the neighbouring seas for many years. In 1735 Bourbon was placed under&nbsp;the governor of the Ile de France (Mauritius), at that time the illustrious Mahé de Labourdonnais. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Compagnie des Indes orientales</span><span class="font1"> gave up its concession in 1767, and under direct administration&nbsp;of the crown liberty of trade was granted. The French Revolution&nbsp;effected little change in the island and occasioned no bloodshed;&nbsp;the colonists successfully resisted the attempts of the Convention&nbsp;to abolish slavery, which continued until 1848 (when over 60,000&nbsp;negroes were freed), the slave trade being, however, abolished in&nbsp;1817. During the Napoleonic wars Réunion, like Mauritius, served&nbsp;the French corsairs as a rallying place from which attacks on Indian&nbsp;merchantmen could be' directed. In 1809 the British attacked the&nbsp;island, and the French were forced to capitulate on the 8th of July&nbsp;1810; the island remained in the possession of Great Britain&nbsp;until April 1815, when it was restored to France. From that period&nbsp;the island has had no exterior troubles. The negro population,&nbsp;upon whom in 1870 the Third Republic conferred the full rights of&nbsp;French citizenship including the vote, being unwilling to labour in&nbsp;the plantations, the immigration of coolies began in i860, but in&nbsp;1882 the government of India prohibited the further emigration&nbsp;of labourers from that country, in consequence of the inconsiderate&nbsp;treatment of the coolies by the colonists. Réunion has also suffered&nbsp;from the disastrous effects of cyclones. A particularly destructive&nbsp;storm swept over the island in March 1879, and in 1904 another&nbsp;cyclone destroyed fully half of the sugar crop and 75% of the&nbsp;vanilla crop.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">REUS, a city of N.E. Spain, in the province of Tarragona, on the Saragossa-Tarragona railway, 4 m. N. of Salou, its port&nbsp;on the Mediterranean. Pop. (1900) 26,681. Reus consists of&nbsp;two parts, the old and the new, separated by the Calle Arrabal,&nbsp;which occupies the site of the old city wall. The old town&nbsp;centres in the Plaza del Mercado, from which narrow and&nbsp;tortuous lanes radiate in various directions; the new one dates&nbsp;from about the middle of the 18th century, and its streets are&nbsp;wide and straight. There is an active trade in the agricultural&nbsp;products of the fertile region around the city. The local&nbsp;industries developed considerably hetween 1875 and 1905, and&nbsp;the city has important flour, wine and fruit export houses.&nbsp;There is a model farm belonging to the municipality in the&nbsp;suburbs. Reus has excellent primary, normal and higher-grade state schools, many private schools, an academy of fine&nbsp;arts and a public library. The hospitals and foundling refuge,&nbsp;the institute and the town hall are handsome modem buildings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The earliest records of Reus date from ahout the middle of the 13 th century. Its modem prosperity is traced to about&nbsp;the year 1750, when a colony of English settled here and established a trade in woollens, leather, wine and spirits. The&nbsp;principal incidents in its political history arose out of the&nbsp;occurrences of 1843 (see Spain, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History),</span><span class="font0"> in connexion with&nbsp;which the town received the title of city, and Generals Zurbano&nbsp;and Prim were made counts of Reus. The city was the birthplace of General Prim (1814-1870) and of the painter Mariano&nbsp;Fortuny (1839-1874).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">REUSCH, FRANZ HEINRICH (1823-1900), Old Catholic theologian, was bom at Brilon, in Westphalia, on 4th December&nbsp;1823.
