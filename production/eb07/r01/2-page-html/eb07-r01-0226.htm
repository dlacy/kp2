<p><span class="font1">Rhone, between the several elevations are narrow, and have a soil v—' poor and stony, except in that division on the rivers Saone&nbsp;and Rhone which includes some level tracts of greater extent, well cultivated, adorned with fine trees, and presenting a mixture of corn-fields, meadows, and vineyards. The&nbsp;chief rivers are the Rhone and the Saone, the latter of which&nbsp;falls into the former near Lyons, having received the water&nbsp;of the Izeron, the Garon, the Gier, with that of several&nbsp;smaller streams, which empty themselves at length into the&nbsp;Mediterranean Sea. Both the Rhone and the Saone are&nbsp;navigable through the whole of their course within this department. The climate is mild, but, from the vicinity of the&nbsp;mountains, is very variable, and from the same cause vegetation is late in the spring. The productions are, the common domestic animals, wax, honey, and abundance of game,&nbsp;wild fowl, and fish. The produce of corn is deficient for&nbsp;tile annual supply by about six weeks’ consumption. Hemp,&nbsp;flax, poppies, rapeseed, saffron, almonds, chestnuts, and potatoes, are extensively grown. The vine is extensively cultivated, and those on the banks of both the Saone and&nbsp;Rhone have, under a variety of names taken from the respective districts, acquired great celebrity. There are some,&nbsp;but not considerable, mines of copper, and others of vitriol&nbsp;and of coal. The manufacturing industry is great. The&nbsp;silk manufacture is the most extensive, and is chiefly carried on in and around the city of Lyons, the capital of the&nbsp;department.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rhone, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mouths of the,</span><span class="font1"> a department in the south of France, formed out of the western part of the ancient province. It extends in north latitude from 43. 12. to 44. 1.,&nbsp;and in east longitude from 4. 18. to 4. 46., comprehending&nbsp;2003 square miles, or 512,991 hectares, equal to 1,282,382&nbsp;English acres. It is bounded on the north by the department of Vaucluse, on the east by that of the Var, on the&nbsp;south by the Mediterranean, and on the west by the department of Gard. It is divided into three arrondissements, and&nbsp;these into twenty-seven cantons and 106 communes, containing, in 1836, 362,325 inhabitants. They chiefly adhere&nbsp;to the Romish church, though there are about 5000 Protestants, and in the city of Marseilles many Jews. They&nbsp;speak a peculiar patois, nearly the same as, in the time of&nbsp;the Troubadours, was the written language of Provence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The surface of the eastern and southern portions of the department is mountainous. A range of hills extends from&nbsp;the department of the Var. Of one of them, San Venture,&nbsp;the height is 3120 feet. In the northern part is a chain of&nbsp;hills extending from Vaucluse, beginning on the banks of&nbsp;the Durance, and stretching from east to west to the neighbourhood of the Rhone, and rising to the height of 2500&nbsp;feet above the level of the sea. The south-west part is&nbsp;wholly a level plain, full of morasses, and including the&nbsp;island of Camargue and the island Plan, in which, though&nbsp;some spots are fertile, yet the greater portion exhibits either&nbsp;heaps of pebbles or unhealthy marshes. The river Rhone&nbsp;is the chief stream, into which many others empty themselves before it reaches the sea. The navigation of that&nbsp;river is hazardous on account of its having three outlets,&nbsp;the passages through which are very variable, sometimes&nbsp;one being passable, and then in a few days nearly closed,&nbsp;when another is opened. To remedy this inconvenience,&nbsp;a canal has been opened from Arles to the small haven of&nbsp;Bouc, near the sea. There are several smaller canals, which&nbsp;serve partly for the purpose of communication, and in some&nbsp;measure for those of irrigation. One of the most important public works recently undertaken in France is the navigable canal which terminates in this department. It connects together the tw o great rivers the Rhine and the Rhone.&nbsp;It was begun in 1804, and was originally called the Canal&nbsp;Napoleon: it was afterwards designated the Canal of Monsieur ; and it now bears the more appropriate name of the&nbsp;Canal of the Rhine and Rhone. It was completed in 1832,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">R H U</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">at an expense of'26,640,000 francs, or about L.1,200,000. Rhubarb. The whole length is about 210 miles; and in its progress&nbsp;it comes into direct communication with other great rivers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is divided into four portions. The first commences at the Saone, and proceeds to Dole, where it joins the Doubs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The second portion is connected with Orchamps, Besan-con, Baume, Clival, Lisle, and Vougeancourt, where it terminates. The third portion passes by Montbeliard, Bu-rogne, Valdieu, Mulhausen, Brisach, and Grapenstadt, where the canal enters the river Die, which falls into the&nbsp;Rhine half a mile above Strasburg. The fourth part consists of branches from Mulhausen to Basel and Huningen,&nbsp;fed by water from the Rhine at the latter place. There is&nbsp;a sanguine anticipation that this last branch will form a&nbsp;cheap communication between Switzerland and the Mediterranean. In one part of its progress it communicates&nbsp;with the Seine, and is thus adapted to supply articles of great&nbsp;weight and little original cost, such as iron, w'ood, and stone,&nbsp;to the city of Paris.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As nearly one third of the surface of this department, consisting of mountains, small lakes, and morasses, is uncultivated, it does not produce a sufficient supply of com for its own consumption. The corn is not thrashed, but, as in&nbsp;other warm countries, is trodden out by oxen. Neither&nbsp;cows nor horses are numerous, though on the island of Camargue many of the latter, of a small race, sire bred, almost&nbsp;in a state of wildness. The sheep are numerous, and are&nbsp;moved to the hills or to the plains, according; to the state of&nbsp;the pasturage. The chief agricultural productions on which&nbsp;the department depends for procuring the means of subsistence, are oil, wine, and silk. The olive-trees are abundant, but some severe winters have destroyed many of them,&nbsp;and diminished the price of oil one third.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Besides wine, the vineyards yield a great quantity of raisins of various excellent descriptions, which form an important source of wealth, as do other dried fruits, especially plums. A large portion of the grapes is converted into&nbsp;brandy. The cultivation of silk is very much diffused, but&nbsp;nowhere an exclusive pursuit, and does not yield more&nbsp;than 100,000 pounds of raw silk. The sea-fishery gives&nbsp;employment to a great number of persons ; and salt being&nbsp;plentitvilly produced by natural evaporation, much of the&nbsp;fish taken in this department is cured for exportation. The&nbsp;only mines are those of coal; nor does their annual produce exceed 5000 tons. There are manufactures of silk,&nbsp;cotton, and other articles, chiefly confined to die cities of&nbsp;Marseilles and Aix, which likewise carry on the principal&nbsp;export trade, including the productions already noticed, and&nbsp;also figs, almonds, capers, coral, and essences of flowers, together with wool.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RHUBARB. The drug well known by this name is the root of some species of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rheum,</span><span class="font1"> an important genus of the natural order </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Polygonaeece,</span><span class="font1"> Juss., and referred to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Enneandria&nbsp;Trigynia</span><span class="font1"> in the Linnsean classification. The roots of all the&nbsp;species are thick and fleshy, generally a good! deal branched,&nbsp;and striking deep into the earth. The leaves and stems are&nbsp;annual. The leaves, which are radical and petiolate, rise in&nbsp;spring, coming up in a thick head folded together, and gradually expanding. The footstalks of the leaves are thick,&nbsp;fleshy, and juicy, varying in length in the different species&nbsp;from a few inches to two feet. The leaves themselves are&nbsp;spreading, and very large, being sometimes two feet in diameter. The flowering stems begin to rise at the end of spring,&nbsp;come into flower in June, and ripen their seeds in August&nbsp;and September. The flowers are in a large terminal panicle&nbsp;or compound raceme. They consist of a coloured six parted perianth. The seeds are three cornered, winged, and&nbsp;have the withered perianth adhering to their base. The&nbsp;rhubarbs are extensively cultivated in this country for the&nbsp;sake of the footstalks, and likewise for the medicinal roots.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When grown for the sake of the latter, they should be sown</span></p>
