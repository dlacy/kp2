<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">RED WING, a city of the United States, capital of Goodhue county, Minnesota, occupies a commanding site&nbsp;on a plateau encircled by high bluffs (nearly 300 feet&nbsp;high), on the west bank of the Mississippi, 41 miles south&nbsp;of St Paul on the La Crosse division of the Chicago and&nbsp;St Paul Railroad ; it is also the eastern terminus of the&nbsp;Cannon Valley branch of the same railway. Red Wing&nbsp;has an opera-house and a music-hall ; it trades in lumber,&nbsp;manufactures earthenware, waggons and carriages, furniture, flour, leather, and boots and shoes, and exports large&nbsp;quantities of wheat. The population was 4260 in 1870&nbsp;and 5876 in 1880; in 1885 it was estimated at 8000,&nbsp;including 1050 employés in manufactories.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">REED, a term applied to several distinct species of large, water-loving grasses. The common or water reed,&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Phragmites communis,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> Trin. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Arundo pliragmites</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">, L.), occurs along the margins of lakes, fens, marshes, and placid&nbsp;streams, not only throughout Britain but over the Palæ-arctic and Nearctic regions, and even in South Australia.&nbsp;Another very important species is </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Psamma arenaria,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> R. and&nbsp;S. (</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Ammophila</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Arundo arundinacea,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> Host.), the sea-reed&nbsp;or marram grass, a native of the sandy shores of Europe&nbsp;and North Africa. Both species have been of notable&nbsp;geological importance, the former binding the soil and so&nbsp;impeding denudation, and actually converting swamp into&nbsp;dry land, largely by the aid of its tall (5 to 10 feet) close&nbsp;set stems, which not only break the currents of water&nbsp;around them, and so cause deposition of their sediment,&nbsp;but furnish in themselves an important annual contribution&nbsp;to the incipient soil. The latter species, of which the&nbsp;branching rootstocks may be traced 30 or even 40 feet, is&nbsp;of still greater importance in holding sand-dunes against&nbsp;the encroachments of the sea, and for this purpose has not&nbsp;only been long protected by law but has been extensively&nbsp;planted on the coasts of Norfolk, Holland, Gascony, &amp;c.&nbsp;Other reeds are </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Calamagrostis</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> (various species), </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Gynérium&nbsp;argenteum</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> (pampas grass), </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Deyeuxia,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> &amp;c., also </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Arundo&nbsp;Donax,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> the largest European grass (6 to 12 feet high),&nbsp;which is abundant in southern Europe. Reeds have been&nbsp;extensively used from the earliest times in thatching and&nbsp;in other branches of construction, and also for arrows,</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">REEVE, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Clara </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(1725-1803), </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">one of the imitators of Horace Walpole in Gothic romance, was born at Ipswich&nbsp;in </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">1725. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">She was an industrious woman of letters, and&nbsp;produced many works in prose and verse, including an&nbsp;interesting sketch of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Progress of Romance</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">; but her&nbsp;only eminent success was the romance of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Old English&nbsp;Baron</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(1777). </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">In her theory about the use of the supernatural, as in chronological position, she stands midway&nbsp;between Walpole and Mrs Radcliffe. Though she owned&nbsp;Walpole as a master, she declined to follow as far as he&nbsp;went in supernatural incident; she admits a castle and a&nbsp;haunted wing and the ghost of a murdered man, but&nbsp;draws the line before statues dropping blood, pictures that&nbsp;groan and walk out of their frames, and suchlike improbabilities. She was the daughter of a Suffolk clergyman,&nbsp;and died at Ipswich in </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">1803.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">REFEREE, in law, is a person to whom a matter is delegated by a superior for report or decision. The principal use of the word occurs in the practice of the House&nbsp;of Commons and of the High Court of Justice. The Court&nbsp;of Referees is a court to which the House of Commons&nbsp;commits the decision of all questions of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">locus standi</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">,—that&nbsp;is, the right of petitioners to be heard in opposition to&nbsp;private Bills. A referee is also associated with members&nbsp;of the House as a member of every committee on an opposed&nbsp;Bill, but may not vote. Under the Judicature Act, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">1873,&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">cases are submitted to either official or special referees for&nbsp;inquiry and report, or for trial. Inquiry and report may&nbsp;be directed in any case,—trial only by consent of the parties,&nbsp;or in any matter requiring any prolonged examination of&nbsp;documents or accounts, or any scientific or local investigation which cannot be tried in the ordinary way </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(36 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">37&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Viet. c. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">66, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ss. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">56, 57 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">; Rules of the Supreme Court, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">1883,&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Ord. xxxvi.).</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">HE period occupied by the great movement known as the Protestant Reformation stands identified, for&nbsp;the most part, with the period which marks the transition&nbsp;from the mediaeval to the modern era in European history.&nbsp;Taken within its narrowest limits, it may be looked upon&nbsp;as commencing with the year 1517 and as finding a certain&nbsp;consummation with the year 1545. In the former year&nbsp;Luther’s theses, published at Wittenberg,@@<sup>1</sup> represent the&nbsp;commencement of that direct and open renunciation of&nbsp;mediaeval doctrine which he initiated; in the latter year&nbsp;the assembling of the council of Trent marks the renewed&nbsp;sanction and promulgation of that doctrine whereby an&nbsp;insuperable barrier was erected between the communion&nbsp;of Rome and the churches of Protestantism. From that&nbsp;time each communion possessed its distinctive organization and formulary of faith, and the struggles which&nbsp;subsequently took place between Romanism and Protestantism represent, not attempts to bring about or to</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">resist reform (whether of discipline or of doctrine), but endeavouis on the part of both communions to bring&nbsp;about, if possible, the extinction of the opposed form of&nbsp;faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">But, although the contest which Luther initiated had, long before his death, resulted in complete and irreparable&nbsp;rupture between the contending parties, it is certain that&nbsp;in order to understand the true nature and origin of that&nbsp;contest we must go back to events long anterior to 1517 ;&nbsp;while in order fully to estimate its effects we must follow&nbsp;the history of events long after 1545. In Germany, for&nbsp;example, the Reformation can hardly be regarded as finding even a formal consummation before the peace of Augsburg (1555) ; in Switzerland the movement went on with&nbsp;important modifications down to the death of Calvin in&nbsp;1564 ; in France the onward progress was not materially&nbsp;checked before the massacre on the eve of St Bartholomew&nbsp;(1572); in Bohemia its independent and peculiar fortunes&nbsp;found a final solution only with the battle of the White&nbsp;Hill in 1620; while in England and in Scotland, in the&nbsp;Netherlands, in Scandinavia, in Italy and in Spain, the</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
