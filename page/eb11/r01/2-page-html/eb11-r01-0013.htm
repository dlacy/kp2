<p><span class="font0">exquisite versification was not denied. But there is no doubt that in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Britannicus</span><span class="font0"> the defects of Racine display themselves&nbsp;pretty clearly to any competent critic. The complete nullity&nbsp;of Britannicus himself and of Junie, and the insufficient attempt&nbsp;to display the complex and dangerous character of Nero are&nbsp;not redeemed by Agrippina, who is really good, and Burrhus,&nbsp;who is solidly painted as a secondary character. Voltaire calls&nbsp;it “ la pièce des connaisseurs, ” a double-edged compliment.&nbsp;The next play of Racine has, except </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Phèdre,</span><span class="font0"> the most curious&nbsp;history of all. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">“ Bérénice</span><span class="font0">, ” says Fontenelle succinctly, “ fut&nbsp;un duel, ” and he acknowledges that his uncle was not the&nbsp;conqueror. Henrietta of Orleans proposed (it is said without&nbsp;letting them know the double commission) the subject to&nbsp;Corneille and Racine at the same time, and rumour gives no&nbsp;very creditable reasons for her choice of the subject. Her&nbsp;death preceded the performance of the two plays, both of which,&nbsp;but especially Racine’s, were successful. There is no doubt&nbsp;that it is the better of the two, but Claude Chapelle’s not unfriendly criticism in quoting the two lines of an old song—</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“Marion pleure, Marion crie,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Marion veut qu'on la marie”—</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">is said to have annoyed Racine very much, and it has a most malicious appropriateness. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bajazet,</span><span class="font0"> which was first played on&nbsp;4th January 1672, is perhaps better. As a play, technically&nbsp;speaking, it has great merit, but the reproach commonly brought&nbsp;against its author was urged specially and with great force&nbsp;against this by Corneille. It is impossible to imagine anything&nbsp;less Oriental than the atmosphere of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bajazet;</span><span class="font0"> the whole thing&nbsp;is not only French but ephemerally French—French of the day&nbsp;and hour; and its ingenious scenario and admirable style&nbsp;scarcely save it. This charge is equally applicable with the&nbsp;same reservations to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Mithridate,</span><span class="font0"> which appears to have been&nbsp;produced on 13th January 1673, the day after the author’s&nbsp;reception at the Academy. It was extremely popular, and Racine&nbsp;could hardly have lodged a more triumphant diploma piece.&nbsp;His next attempt, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Iphigénie,</span><span class="font0"> was a long step backwards and&nbsp;upwards in the direction of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Andromaque.</span><span class="font0"> It is not that the&nbsp;characters are eminently Greek, but that Greek tragedy gave&nbsp;Racine examples which prevented him from flying in the face&nbsp;of the propriety of character as he had done in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bérénice, Bajazet,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Mithridate,</span><span class="font0"> and that he here called in, as in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Andromaque,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">other passions to the aid of the mere sighing and crying which&nbsp;form the sole appeal of these three tragedies. It succeeded&nbsp;brilliantly and deservedly, but, oddly enough, the date of its&nbsp;appearance is very uncertain. It was acted at court on the&nbsp;18th of August 1674, but it does not seem to have been given to&nbsp;the public till the early spring of 1675.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The last and finest of the series of tragedies proper was the most unlucky. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Phèdre</span><span class="font0"> was represented for the first time on&nbsp;New Year’s Day 1677, at the Hôtel de Bourgogne. Within&nbsp;a week the opposition company or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">troupe du roi</span><span class="font0"> launched an&nbsp;opposition </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Phèdre</span><span class="font0"> by Nicolas Pradon. This singular competition, which had momentous results for Racine, and in&nbsp;which he to some extent paid the penalty of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">lex talionis&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">for his own rivalry with Corneille, had long been foreseen.&nbsp;Racine had from the first been bitterly opposed, and his&nbsp;enemies at this time had the powerful support of the duchess&nbsp;of Bouillon, one of Mazarin’s nieces, together with her brother&nbsp;the duke of Nevers and divers other personages of high position.&nbsp;These persons of quality, guided, it is said, by Madame&nbsp;Deshoulières, selected Pradon, a dramatist of little talent&nbsp;but of much facility, to compose a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Phèdre</span><span class="font0"> in competition with&nbsp;that which it was known that Racine had been elaborating.&nbsp;The partisans on both sides did not neglect means for correcting&nbsp;fortune. On her side the duchess of Bouillon is accused of&nbsp;having bought up the front places in both theatres for the&nbsp;first six nights; on his, Racine is said to have prevailed on&nbsp;the best actresses of the company that played Pradon’s piece&nbsp;to refuse the title part. There is even some ground for&nbsp;believing that he endeavoured to prevent the opposition play&nbsp;from being played at all. It was of no value, but the measures&nbsp;of the cabal had been so well taken that the finest tragedy&nbsp;of the French classical school was all but driven from the&nbsp;stage, while Pradon’s was a positive success. A war of&nbsp;sonnets and epigrams followed, during which it is said that&nbsp;the duke of Nevers menaced Racine and Boileau with the&nbsp;same treatment which Dryden and Voltaire actually received,&nbsp;and was only deterred by the protection which Condé extended&nbsp;to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The unjust cabal against his piece no doubt made a deep impression on Racine. But it is impossible to decide exactly&nbsp;how much influence this had on the subsequent change in his&nbsp;life. For thirteen years he had been constantly employed on a&nbsp;series of brilliant dramas. He now broke off his dramatic&nbsp;work entirely and in the remaining twenty years of his life&nbsp;wrote but two more plays, and those under special circumstances and of quite a different kind. He had been during&nbsp;his early manhood a libertine in morals and religion; he now&nbsp;married, became irreproachably domestic, and almost&nbsp;ostentatiously devout. No authentic account of this change&nbsp;exists; for that of Louis Racine, which attributes the whole&nbsp;to a sudden religious impulse, is manifestly little more than&nbsp;the theory of a son, pious in both senses of the word. Probably&nbsp;all the motives which friends and foes have attributed entered&nbsp;more or less into his action. At any rate, what is certain is&nbsp;that he reconciled himself with Arnauld and Port Royal&nbsp;generally, accepted, with whatever sincerity, their doctrine of&nbsp;the incompatibility of the stage and the Christian life, and&nbsp;on the 1st of June married Catherine de Romanet and definitely&nbsp;settled down to a quiet domestic life, alternated with the&nbsp;duties of a courtier. For his repentance was by no means a&nbsp;repentance in sackcloth and ashes. The drama was not then&nbsp;very profitable to dramatists, but Louis Racine tells us that&nbsp;his father had been able to furnish a house, collect a library&nbsp;of some value, and save 6000 livres. His wife had money,&nbsp;and he had possessed for some time (it is not certain how long)&nbsp;the honourable and valuable post of treasurer of France at&nbsp;Moulins. His annual “ gratification ” had been increased&nbsp;from 800 to 1500 livres, then to 2000, and in the October of&nbsp;the year of his marriage he and Boileau were made historiographers-royal with a salary of 2000 crowns. Besides all&nbsp;this he had, though a layman, one or two benefices. It would&nbsp;have been pleasanter if Louis Racine had not told us that his&nbsp;father regarded His Majesty’s choice as “ an act of the grace&nbsp;of God to detach him entirely from poetry. ” For the historiographer of Louis XIV. was simply his chief flatterer. However,&nbsp;little came of this historiography. The joint incumbents of&nbsp;the office made some campaigns with the king, sketched plans&nbsp;of histories and left a certain number of materials and memoirs;&nbsp;but they executed no substantive work. Racine, whether&nbsp;this be set down to his credit or not, was certainly a fortunate&nbsp;and apparently an adroit courtier. His very relapse into&nbsp;Jansenism coincided with his rise at court, where Jansenism&nbsp;was in no favour, and the fact that he had been in the good&nbsp;graces of Madame de Montespan did not deprive him of those&nbsp;of Madame de Maintenon. Neither in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Esther</span><span class="font0"> did he hesitate&nbsp;to reflect upon his former patroness. But a reported sneer&nbsp;of the king, who was sharp-eyed enough, “ Cavoie avec Racine&nbsp;se croit bel esprit; Racine avec Cavoie se croit courtisan, ”&nbsp;makes it appear that his comparatively low birth was not&nbsp;forgotten at Versailles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Racine’s first campaign was at the siege of Ypres in 1678, where some practical jokes are said to have been played on&nbsp;the two civilians who acted this early and peculiar variety of&nbsp;the part of special correspondent. Again in 1683, in 1687&nbsp;and in each year from 1691 to 1693 Racine accompanied the&nbsp;king on similar expeditions. The literary results of these&nbsp;have been spoken of. His labours brought him, in addition&nbsp;to his other gains, frequent special presents from the king,&nbsp;one of which was as much as 1000 pistoles. In 1690 he&nbsp;further received the office of “ gentilhomme ordinaire du roi, ”&nbsp;which afterwards passed to his son. Thus during the later&nbsp;years of his life he was more prosperous than is usual with&nbsp;poets. His domestic life appears to have been a happy one.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
