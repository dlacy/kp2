<p><span class="font0">“ Vaincre ou mourir pour Bruxelles,” he obtained arms from a local factory, and marched upon the capital. Here he took his&nbsp;place at once among the leaders of the revolutionary party. His&nbsp;influence saved the town-hall from pillage on 19th September.&nbsp;On the 24th a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">commission administrative</span><span class="font0"> was formed, of which&nbsp;Rogier became president. The energetic measures of this body&nbsp;and of its successor, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">gouvernement provisoire, soon</span><span class="font0"> freed the&nbsp;greater part of the country from the Dutch troops. Rogier was&nbsp;sent in October to suppress an outbreak among the colliers of&nbsp;Hainaut, and then as delegate of the provisional government to&nbsp;Antwerp, where the citadel still held out for Holland. He succeeded in arranging an armistice, and then, in the exercise of&nbsp;the absolute power with which he was invested, reorganized&nbsp;the entire administration of the city. He sat for Liège in the&nbsp;National Congress, voted for the establishment of a hereditary&nbsp;monarchy, and induced the congress to adopt the principle of an&nbsp;elective second chamber. In the long-drawn debates on the bestowal of the crown he ranged himself on the side of Louis Philippe :&nbsp;he first supported the candidature of Otto of Bavaria, and on&nbsp;his rejection declared for the duc de Nemours. Finally, when&nbsp;Louis Philippe declined the crown on behalf of his son, Rogier&nbsp;voted with the majority for Leopold of Saxe-Coburg. In June&nbsp;1831 he was appointed governor of the province of Antwerp,&nbsp;a post rendered exceptionally difficult by the continued presence&nbsp;of Dutch troops in the citadel. In October 1832 he was made&nbsp;minister of the interior in the Goblet-Devaux cabinet. In the&nbsp;following June he intervened in a quarrel in the chamber of&nbsp;deputies between Devaux and the Opposition leader, Alexandre&nbsp;Gendebien, claimed a prior right to give satisfaction, and fought&nbsp;a duel, in which he was severely wounded. During his term&nbsp;of office he carried, in the teeth of violent opposition, a law that&nbsp;established in Belgium the first railways on the continent of&nbsp;Europe, and thus laid the foundation of her industrial development. Owing to dissensions in the cabinet, he retired in 1834,&nbsp;together with Lebeau, and resumed the governorship of Antwerp.&nbsp;On Lebeau’s return to power in 1840, Rogier became minister&nbsp;of public works and education. The proposals that he made&nbsp;in the latter capacity were defeated by the determined opposition of the Clerical party, andon the resignation of the ministry&nbsp;in 1841, Rogier gave his support to a compromise on the subject&nbsp;of education, which passed into law in 1842. He led the Liberal&nbsp;party in Opposition till 1847, when he formed a cabinet in which&nbsp;he held the ministry of the interior. He at once embarked on a&nbsp;programme of political and economic reform. He took effective&nbsp;steps to remedy the industrial distress caused by the decay of&nbsp;the Flemish linen trade. The limits of the franchise were&nbsp;•extended; and as the result of the liberal policy of the government Belgium alone escaped the revolutionary wave that&nbsp;spread over the Continent in 1848. He passed a law in 1850&nbsp;organizing secondary education under the control of the State,&nbsp;and giving the clergy only the right of religious instruction.&nbsp;The Clerical party, though unable to defeat this measure, succeeded in shaking the position of the cabinet; and it was finally&nbsp;undermined, after Prince Louis Napoleon’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">coup P état</span><span class="font0"> of 1851,&nbsp;by the hostility of the French government, which found its&nbsp;political exiles welcomed by the liberal cabinet at Brussels.&nbsp;Rogier retired in October 1852, but was brought back into office&nbsp;by the liberal reaction of 1857. He again became president of&nbsp;the council and minister of the interior in a cabinet of which&nbsp;Frère-Orban was the most conspicuous member. The first&nbsp;important measure passed by the ministry was one for the&nbsp;fortification of Antwerp. In i860 the fear of French designs on&nbsp;the independence of Belgium led to a movement of reconciliation&nbsp;with Holland, and inspired Rogier to write the only one of his&nbsp;numerous poems that is likely to survive, his national anthem,&nbsp;“ La Nouvelle Brabançonne.” Some of the ministers resigning&nbsp;in 1861, on the question of recognizing the kingdom of Italy,&nbsp;the cabinet was reconstructed, and Rogier exchanged the&nbsp;ministry of the interior for that of foreign affairs. In this&nbsp;capacity he achieved a diplomatic triumph in freeing the&nbsp;navigation of the Scheldt, and thus enabling Antwerp to become&nbsp;the second port on the mainland of Europe. Defeated at</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Dinant, he sat for Tournai from 1863 till his death. His younger and more energetic colleague, Frere-Orban, gradually overshadowed his chief, and in 1868 Rogier finally retired from&nbsp;power. He continued, however, to take part in public life, and&nbsp;was elected president of the extraordinary session of the chamber&nbsp;of representatives in 1878. From this timb his age, his devoted&nbsp;patriotism and the unassuming simplicity of his life made him&nbsp;the idol of all classes. The fiftieth anniversary of the kingdom&nbsp;of Belgium in 1880, and two years later that of his entry into&nbsp;parliament, were the occasion of demonstrations in his honour.&nbsp;He died at Brussels on the 27th of May 1885, and his remains&nbsp;were accorded a public funeral.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">ROGUE, a word which came into use about the middle of the 16th century as a slang or “ cant ” term for a vagrant&nbsp;vagabond, answering to the modern “ tramp,” and was adopted&nbsp;into English legal phraseology together with “ vagabond ” in&nbsp;the Statute of Elizabeth 1572, “ rogue and vagabond ” and&nbsp;“ incorrigible rogue ” remaining as legal terms for certain classes&nbsp;of persons amenable to the law under the V agrancy Acts (see&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Vagrancy).</span><span class="font0"> The act of Elizabeth defined “ rogues, vagabonds&nbsp;and sturdy beggars ” as including “ idle persons going about&nbsp;and using subtle craft and unlawful games and all persons whole&nbsp;and mighty in body, but having neither land nor master, nor&nbsp;able to give an account how they get their living and all common&nbsp;labourers using loitering and refusing to work for the wages&nbsp;commonly given ” (Sir G. Nicholls’ </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History of the English Poor&nbsp;Law,</span><span class="font0"> ed. 1898 by H. G. Willink, vol, i. 159). The word has now&nbsp;the general meaning of a knave or rascal, though also used (by&nbsp;meiosis) as a term of playful or tender banter and in various&nbsp;special applications </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(e.g.</span><span class="font0"> a “ rogue ” elephant, one who has been&nbsp;driven out by the herd and lives a solitary life, becoming very&nbsp;savage and destructive. Gardeners also apply the word to a&nbsp;plant which does not come true from seed, showing some&nbsp;variation from the type).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The derivation of the word has been much disputed. It has usually been referred to Fr. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rogue,</span><span class="font0"> meaning proud, arrogant, which&nbsp;is variously derived from the Icelandic </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">hroke,</span><span class="font0"> rook, long-winded&nbsp;talker, or Breton </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rok,</span><span class="font0"> proud, haughty; cf. Irish and Gaelic </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rucas,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">pride. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">New English Dictionary,</span><span class="font0"> however, rejects this derivation, and considers possible a connexion with another early&nbsp;“ cant ” word “ roger,” a begging vagabond pretending to be a&nbsp;poor university scholar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROHAN, the name of one of the most illustrious of the feudal families of France, derived from that of a small town in Morbihan, Brittany. The family appears to have sprung from&nbsp;the viscounts of Porhoet, and claims connexion with the ancient&nbsp;sovereigns of Brittany. Since the 12th century it held an&nbsp;important place in the history of Brittany, and strengthened&nbsp;its position by alliances with the greatest houses in France.&nbsp;It was divided into several branches, the eldest of which, that&nbsp;of the viscounts of Rohan, became extinct in 1527. Of the&nbsp;younger branches the most famous is that of Guéménée, from&nbsp;which sprang the branches of Montbazon, Soubise and Gie.&nbsp;The seigneurs of Frontenay, an offshoot of this last branch,&nbsp;inherited by marriage the property of the eldest branch of the&nbsp;house. Hercule de Rohan, duc de Montbazon (1568-1654)&nbsp;served Henry III. and Henry IV. against the League, and was&nbsp;made by Henry IV. governor of Paris and the Isle of France,&nbsp;and master of the hounds. His grandson, Louis de Rohan-Guéménée, the chevalier de Rohan, who was notorious for his&nbsp;dissolute life, conspired with the Dutch against Louis XIV.&nbsp;and was beheaded in Paris in 1674. In the 18th century the&nbsp;Soubise branch furnished several prelates, cardinals and&nbsp;bishops of Strassburg, among others the famous cardinal de&nbsp;Rohan, the hero of the affair of the diamond necklace. The&nbsp;seigneurs of Gie, a branch founded by Pierre de Rohan (i453~&nbsp;1513), a cadet of the branch of Guéménée and marshal of&nbsp;France, were conspicuous on the Protestant side during the&nbsp;wars of religion. René de Rohan, seigneur of Pontivy and&nbsp;Frontenay, commanded the <sub>t</sub> Calvinist army in 1570, and</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
