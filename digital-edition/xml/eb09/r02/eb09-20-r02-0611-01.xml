<p><label>ROC</label>
or more correctly Rukh, a fabulous bird of enormous size which carries off elephants to feed its young. The legend of the roc, familiar to every one from the <hi rend="italic">Arabian Nights,</hi> was widely spread in the East; and in later times the home of the monster was sought in the direction of Madagascar, whence gigantic fronds of the <hi rend="italic">Raphia</hi> palm very like a quill in form appear to have been brought under the name of roc’s feathers (see Yule’s</p><p><hi rend="italic">Marco Polo,</hi> bk. iii. ch. 33, and <hi rend="italic">Academy,</hi> 1884, No. 620). Such a feather was brought to the Great Khan, and we read also of a gigantic stump of a roc’s quill being brought to Spain by a merchant from the China seas (Abu Hâmid of Spain, in Damiri, <hi rend="italic">s.v.).</hi> The roc is hardly different from the Arabian <hi rend="italic"><hi rend="sup"> l</hi> anka,</hi> already mentioned under Phcenix ; it is also identified with the Persian <hi rend="italic">simurgh,</hi> the bird which figures in Firdausi’s epic as the foster-father of the hero Zal, father of Rustam. When we go farther back into Persian antiquity we find an immortal bird, <hi rend="italic">amru,</hi> or (in the <hi rend="italic">Miηoi-khiradh) siηamru,</hi> which shakes the ripe fruit from the mythical tree that bears the seed of all useful things. Sinamrü and simurgh seem to be the same word. In Indian legend the <hi rend="italic">garuda</hi> on which Vishnu rides is the king of birds (Benfey, <hi rend="italic">Pαntschatantra,</hi> ii. 98). In the Pahlavi translation of the Indian story as represented by the Syrian <hi rend="italic">Kalilag and Damnag</hi> (ed. Bickell, 1876), the simurgh takes the place of the garuda, while Ibn al-Mokaffa' <hi rend="italic">(Calila et Dimna,</hi> ed. De Sacy, p. 126) speaks instead of the 'anka. The later Syriac, curiously enough, has <hi rend="italic">behmoth,—</hi> apparently the behemoth of Job transformed into a bird.</p><p>For a collection of legends about the roc, see Lane’s <hi rend="italic">Arabian Nights,</hi> chap. xx. notes 22, 62, and Yule, <hi rend="italic">τtt supra.</hi> Also see Bochart, <hi rend="italic">Hieroz.,</hi> bk. vi. ch. xiv. ; Darnin', i. 414, ii. 177 <hi rend="italic">sq.∙,</hi> Kazwini, i. 419 <hi rend="italic">sq. ;</hi> Ibn Batuta, iv. 305 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi> ; Spiegel, <hi rend="italic">Evan.
