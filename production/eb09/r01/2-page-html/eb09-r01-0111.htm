<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The rays of the sixth and last family, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Myliobatida,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">are popularly known under various names, such as “Devil-fishes,” “Sea-devils,”&nbsp;and “Eagle-rays.” In them the dilatation of the body, or rather&nbsp;the development of the pectoral fins, is carried to an extreme,&nbsp;whilst the tail is very thin and sometimes long like a whip-cord&nbsp;(fig. 3). Caudal spines are generally present and similar to those</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">of the sting-rays ; but in the pectoral fin a portion is detached and forms a “ cephalic ” lobe or pair of lobes in front of the snout.&nbsp;The dentition consists of perfectly flat molars, adapted for crushing&nbsp;hard substances. In some of the eagle-rays the molars are large&nbsp;and tessellated (fig. 4), in others extremely small. Of the twenty</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">species which are known, from tropical and temperate seas, the majority attain to a very large and some to an enormous size : one&nbsp;mentioned by Risso, which was taken at Messina, weighed 1250 lb.&nbsp;A foetus taken from the uterus of the mother (all eagle-rays are&nbsp;viviparous), captured at Jamaica and preserved in the British&nbsp;Museum, is 5 feet broad and weighed 20 if). The mother measured&nbsp;15 feet in width and as many in length, and was between 3 and 4&nbsp;feet thick. At Jamaica, where these rays are well known under the&nbsp;name of “ devil-fishes,” they are frequently attacked for sport’s sake,&nbsp;but their capture is uncertain and sometimes attended with danger.&nbsp;The eagle-ray of the Mediterranean </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(Myliobatis aquila)</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> has strayed&nbsp;as far northwards as the south coast of England. (A. C. G.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">RAY or </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Wray </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">(as he wrote his name till 1670), </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">John </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">(16281705־), sometimes called the father of English natural&nbsp;history, was the son of the blacksmith of Black Notley&nbsp;near Braintree in Essex. There he was born on 29th&nbsp;November 1628, or, according to other authorities, some&nbsp;months earlier. From Braintree school he was sent at the&nbsp;age of sixteen to Catherine Hall, Cambridge, whence he&nbsp;removed to Trinity College after about one year and three-quarters. His tutor at Trinity was Dr Duport, regius professor of Greek, and his intimate friend and fellow-pupil&nbsp;the celebrated Isaac Barrow. Ray was chosen minor fellow&nbsp;of Trinity in 1649, and in due course became a major&nbsp;fellow on proceeding to the master’s degree. He held&nbsp;many college offices, becoming successively lecturer in Greek&nbsp;(1651), mathematics (1653), and humanity (1655), prelector (1657), junior dean (1657), and college steward (1659&nbsp;and 1660) ; and according to the habit of the time he was&nbsp;accustomed to preach in his college chapel and also at&nbsp;Great St Mary’s before the university, long before he took&nbsp;holy orders. Among his sermons preached before his&nbsp;ordination, which was not till 23d December 1660, were&nbsp;the famous discourses on </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Wisdom of God in the Creation,</span><span class="font3"> </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">and on the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Chaos, Deluge, and Dissolution of the&nbsp;World.</span><span class="font3"> </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Ray’s reputation was high also as a tutor; he&nbsp;communicated his own passion for natural history to several&nbsp;pupils, of whom Francis Willughby is by far the most&nbsp;famous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Ray’s quiet college life came to an abrupt close when he found himself unable to subscribe to the Act of Uniformity of 1661, and was accordingly obliged to give up&nbsp;his fellowship in 1662, the year after Isaac Newton had&nbsp;entered the college. We are׳ told by Dr Derham in his&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font3"> </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of Ray that the reason of his refusal </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> was not (as&nbsp;some have imagined) his having taken the ‘ Solemn League&nbsp;and Covenant,’ for that he never did, and often declared&nbsp;that he ever thought it an unlawful oath; but he said he&nbsp;could not declare for those that had taken the oath that no&nbsp;obligation lay upon them, but feared there might.” From&nbsp;this time onwards he seems to have depended chiefly on&nbsp;the bounty of his pupil Willughby, who made Ray his&nbsp;constant companion while he lived, and at his death left&nbsp;him £60 a year, with the charge of educating his two sons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">In the spring of 1663 Ray started together with Willughby and two other of his pupils on a Continental&nbsp;tour, from which he returned in March 1666, parting&nbsp;from Willughby at Montpellier, whence the latter continued his journey into Spain. He had previously in three&nbsp;different journeys (1658, 1661, 1662) travelled through&nbsp;the greater part of Great Britain, and selections from his&nbsp;private notes of these journeys were edited by George&nbsp;Scott in 1760, under the title of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Mr Ray’s Itineraries.&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Ray himself published an account of his foreign travel&nbsp;in 1673, entitled </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Observations topographical, moral, and&nbsp;physiological, made on a Journey through part of the Low&nbsp;Countries, Germany, Italy, and France.</span><span class="font3"> </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">From this tour&nbsp;Ray and Willughby returned laden with collections, on&nbsp;which they meant to base complete systematic descriptions&nbsp;of the animal and vegetable kingdoms. Willughby undertook the former part, but, dying in 1672, left only an&nbsp;ornithology and ichthyology, in themselves vast, for Ray&nbsp;to edit; while the latter used the botanical collections for&nbsp;the groundwork of his </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Metliodus plantarum nova</span><span class="font3"> </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">(1682),&nbsp;and his great </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Ilistoria generalis plantarum</span><span class="font3"> </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">(1685). The&nbsp;plants gathered on his British tours had already been&nbsp;described in his </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Catalogus plantarum Angtise</span><span class="font3"> </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">(1670),&nbsp;which work is the basis of all later English floras.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">In 1667 Ray was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1669 he published in conjunction with Willughby&nbsp;his first paper in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Philosophical Transactions</span><span class="font3"> </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">on “ Experiments concerning the Motion of Sap in Trees.” They&nbsp;demonstrated the ascent of the sap through the wood of&nbsp;the tree, and supposed the sap to “ precipitate a kind of&nbsp;white coagulum or jelly, which may be well conceived to&nbsp;be the part which every year between bark and tree turns&nbsp;to wood, and of which the leaves and fruits are made.”&nbsp;Immediately after his admission into the Royal Society&nbsp;he was induced by Bishop Wilkins to translate his </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Real&nbsp;Character</span><span class="font3"> </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">into Latin, and it seems he actually completed&nbsp;a translation, which, however, remained in manuscript;&nbsp;his </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Metliodus plantarum nova</span><span class="font3"> </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">was in fact undertaken as&nbsp;a !)art of Wilkins’s great classificatory scheme.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">In 1673 Ray married Margaret Oakley of Launton (Oxford); in 1676 he went to Sutton Coldfield, and in 1677</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
