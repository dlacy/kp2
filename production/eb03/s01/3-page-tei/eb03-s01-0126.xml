Schorls are  likewiſe found in the mountains and mines of Niſelga, Kraſnavolok, and Sondala, as likewiſe between the Onega Lake and White Sea. Black ſchorl is likewiſe  found near the White Sea, and in the Altai, Ural, and Daurian mountains.</p><p>None of the tranſparent ſchorls have been found in Scotland as far as we have heard; but many varieties of the opake kinds have been found in various places, particularly in the iſland of Arran, where there is a bed of greeniſh horn-like ſchorl of immenſe extent near the harbour of Lamlaſh.</p><p>Fine ſpecimens of ſchorl are dear; the ruby ſchorl from Siberia, 25 to 50 rubles a ring ſtone; the green, when fine, from 15 to 30. The high price of the ruby ſchorl is owing to its novelty and rarity; and of the green, is owing to its paſſing for an emerald. The ſpeciſic gravity of ſchorl is 3,6.</p><p>SCHOTI A, in botany: A genus of the monogynia order, belonging to the decandria claſs of plants; and in the natural method ranking under the 33d order, <hi rend="italic">Lomentaceae.</hi> The calyx is ſemiquinquefid; the corolla has five petals, which are equal; the tube is turbinated, carnous, and perſiſtent. The legumen pedicellated, and contains two ſeeds; there is only one ſpecies, viz. the ſpecioſa, or African lignum vitæ.</p><p>SCHREBERA, in botany: A genus of the digynia order, belonging to the pentandria claſs of plant; and in the natural method ranking with thoſe of which the order is doubtful. The calyx is quinquepartite; the corolla funnel-ſhaped, with the filaments in the throat, and having each a ſcale at the baſe.</p><p>SCHREVELIUS (Cornelius), a laborious Dutch critic and writer, who has given the public ſome editions of the ancient authors more elegant than correct: his Greek Lexicon is eſteemed the beſt of all his works. He died in 1667.</p><p>SCHULTENS (Albert), profeſſor of Hebrew and of the eaſtern languages at Leyden, and one of the moſt learned men of the 18th century, was born at Groningen, where he ſtudied till the year 1706, and from thence continued his ſtudies at Leyden and Utrecht. Schultens at length applied himſelf to the ſtudy of Arabic books, both printed and in manuſcript; in which he made great progreſs. A ſhort time after he became miniſter of Waſſenar, and two years after profeſſor of the eaſtern tongues at Franeker. At length he was invited to Leyden, where he taught Hebrew and the eaſtern languages with extraordinary reputation till his death, which happened in 1750. He wrote many learned works; the principal of which are, 1. A Commentary on Job, 2 vols 4to. 2. A Commentary on the Proverbs. 3. <hi rend="italic">Vetus</hi> &amp; <hi rend="italic">regia  via Hebraizandi.</hi> 4. <hi rend="italic">Animadversiones philologicae &amp; criticae ad varia lora Veteris Testamenti.</hi> 6. An excellent Hebrew grammar, &amp;c. Schultens diſcovered in all his works found criticiſm and much learning. He maintained againſt Gouſſet and Drieſſen, that in order to have a perfect knowledge of Hebrew, it is neceſſary to join with it, not only the Chaldee and Syriac, but more particularly the Arabic.</p><p>SCHURMAN (Anna-Maria), a moſt extraordinary German lady. Her natural genius diſcovered itſelf at ſix years of age, when ſhe cut all ſorts of figures in</p><p>paper with her ſciſſars without a pattern. At eight, ſhe learned, in a few days, to draw flowers in a very agreeable manner. At ten, ſhe took but three hours to learn embroidery. Afterwards ſhe was taught muſic, vocal and inſtrumental; painting, ſculpture, and engraving; in all of which ſhe ſucceeded admirably. She excelled in miniature-painting, and in cutting portraits upon glaſs with a diamond. Hebrew, Greek, and Latin, were ſo familiar to her, that the moſt learned men were aſtoniſhed at it. She ſpoke French, Italian, and Engliſh, fluently. Her hand-writing, in almoſt all languages, was ſo inimitable, that the curious preſerved ſpecimens of it in their cabinets. But all this extent of learning and uncommon penetration could not protect her from falling into the errors of Labadie, the famous French enthuſiaſt, who had been baniſhed France for his extravagant tenets and conduct. To this man ſhe entirely attached herſelf, and accompanied him wherever he went; and even attended him in his laſt illneſs at Altena in Holſtein. Her works, conſiſting of <hi rend="italic">De vitae humanae termino,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Dissertatio de ingenii muliebris ad doctrinam et meliores literas aptitudine,</hi> and her Letters to her learned correſpondents, were printed at Leyden in 1648; but enlarged in the edition of Utrecht, 1662, in 12mo, under the following title: <hi rend="italic">A. M. Schurman Opuſcula Hebraea, Graeca, Latina, Gallica, Proſaica, et Metrica.</hi> She publiſhed likewiſe at Altena, in Latin, A Defence of her attachment to Labadie, while ſhe was with him in 1673; not worth reading. She was born at Cologne in 1607, but reſided chiefly in Holland, and died in Frieſland in 1678.</p><p>SCHALBEA, in botany; a genus of the angio- ſpermia order, belonging to the didynamia claſs of plants. The calyx is quadriſid, with a ſuperior lobe; the lowermoſt longeſt, and emarginated.</p><p>SCHWARTS (Chriſtopher), an eminent hiſtory. painter, born at Ingolſtadt in 1550, who was diftinguiſhed by the appellation of the <hi rend="italic">German Raphael.</hi> He learned the firſt principles of the art in his own country, but finiſhed his ſtudies at Venice; when he not only made the works of Titian his models, but had the advantage of receiving ſome perſonal inſtructions from that illuſtrious matter. His performances were ſoon in the higheſt eſteem, as his manner of painting was very different from what the Germans had been accuſtomed to before that time: he was, therefore, invited by the elector of Bavaria to his court, and appointed his principal painter. He died in 1594; and his moſt capital works, as well in freſco as in oil, are in the palace at Munich, and in the churches and convents.</p><p>SCHWARTENBURG, a town and caſtle of Germany, and circle of Upper Saxony, in the landgravate of Thuringia, and capital of a county of the ſame name belonging to a prince of the houſe of Saxony. It is ſeated on the river Schwartz, 20 miles ſouth-eaſt of Erford, and 35 north of Cullembach. E. Long. 11. 27. N. Lat. 50. 45.</p><p>SCHWARTZEMBERG, a town of Germany, in the circle of Franconia, and capital of a principality of the ſame name. The caſtle is ſeated on the river Lee,  5 miles north-weſt of Nuremberg, and 20 eaſt of Wertzburg, ſubject to its own prince. E. Long. 10. 27. N. Lat. 49. 43.</p></body></text></TEI>
