<p><span class="font0">in such a case they must have been born Jews is nevertheless a rash one. Not the Jews only, who possess the written law, but the whole of pre-Christian mankind are&nbsp;in Paul’s conception ideally under the law,—under its&nbsp;bondage and curse. For all alike redemption is a redemption from the law’s penalty and dominion. Hence Paul&nbsp;can say even to born Gentiles, e^avarw^Te </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">tw vo/xw.</span><span class="font0"> But&nbsp;according to Baur and Mangold the decisive evidence for&nbsp;the Jewish Christian character of the Roman Christians&nbsp;is the whole substance of the present epistle. All its&nbsp;arguments have for their aim to establish and vindicate&nbsp;the free gospel of Paul as against the objections of the&nbsp;Judaizers. They therefore conclude that it can have been&nbsp;designed only for Judaistically-disposed readers whom Paul&nbsp;seeks by these representations to win for his gospel. This&nbsp;line of argument is at bottom sound, and Baur has rendered&nbsp;a real service by showing that the epistle is by no means&nbsp;an outline of the Pauline dogmatic as a whole, but is simply&nbsp;an elucidation of such points in it as were offensive to the&nbsp;Judaically-minded. A brief review of its contents will&nbsp;make this clear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The epistle falls into two unequal parts,—a theoretical (i.-xi.) and a hortatory (xii.-xvi.). The latter is almost of&nbsp;the nature of a mere appendix. The proper kernel of the&nbsp;epistle, that for the sake of which it came to be written, is&nbsp;found in the theoretical exposition of the first eleven chapters. These again fall into two sections,—chaps, i.- v. laying&nbsp;the positive foundations of the Pauline gospel as freed&nbsp;from the law, and chaps, vi.-xi. containing the vindication of&nbsp;that gospel against objectors. Having shown directly in&nbsp;chaps, i.-v. that we can attain righteousness and so salvation&nbsp;not along the path of legal observance but only along the&nbsp;path of faith, that is to say, believing apprehension of the&nbsp;mercy of God in Christ, he goes on in chap. vi. to refute&nbsp;point by point the positions of the Judaizers. He shows&nbsp;that in the freedom from the law the freedom to sin is by&nbsp;no means involved ; on the contrary, it is with the believer&nbsp;an inherent necessity that he should live a new life in his&nbsp;fellowship with Christ (chap, vi.), and precisely by that&nbsp;fellowship is he for the first time truly enabled so to live&nbsp;(chap. viii.). The law cannot give him this power ; it only&nbsp;commands, and does not at the same time give strength to&nbsp;obey. Hence, although good in itself, it has for men only&nbsp;a pernicious effect, inasmuch as by its injunctions sinful&nbsp;desire is excited (chap. vii.). A special objection of the&nbsp;Judaizers against the activity of Paul was also this,—that&nbsp;he should have turned to the heathen while still the greater&nbsp;part of Israel remained unconverted. His answer to this is&nbsp;contained in chaps, ix.-xi. On the one hand, it is Israel’s&nbsp;own fault to have rejected its salvation ; on the other hand,&nbsp;such has been God’s will. Israel is at present rejected in&nbsp;order that the heathen may step into the gap thus made.&nbsp;Yet the rejection of Israel is only for a time. By the admission of the heathen Israel is to be stirred to jealousy&nbsp;and thus at last to be also converted. Precisely in such&nbsp;intricate paths as these is the wonderful depth of the&nbsp;divine wisdom made manifest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Thus all the theoretical disquisitions of the epistle are in reality neither more nor less than a vindication and a&nbsp;polemic against the Jewish Christian point of view. But&nbsp;are we to conclude from this that the readers were themselves Jewisli Christians ? Such an inference has against&nbsp;it the fact that Paul, both at the beginning and at the&nbsp;close of his epistle, clearly designates them as Gentile&nbsp;Christians. In i. 5, 6, and i. 13-15, as well as in xv.&nbsp;15, 16, he appeals to his office as apostle of the Gentiles&nbsp;as justifying him in now writing to the church at Rome&nbsp;and in proposing further labours there. In xi. 13, also,&nbsp;the readers are spoken to as of Gentile birth. The&nbsp;arguments by which Baur and Mangold seek to weaken&nbsp;the force of this passage are very far-fetched. If, then,&nbsp;the Roman Christians were Gentiles by blood, the theory&nbsp;of Beyschlag, that they were Gentile Christians in origin&nbsp;but Jewish Christians by conviction, appears to have&nbsp;most to commend it in view of the contents of the&nbsp;epistle. If the epistle stopped short at the end of chap,&nbsp;xiii., we should indeed be compelled to adopt that theory.&nbsp;But the remaining chapters (xiv., xv.) suggest much&nbsp;rather that the majority were by conviction also Gentile&nbsp;Christians and emancipated from the law. For in the&nbsp;chapters specified Paul deals with a division that has&nbsp;arisen within the community. One section still remained&nbsp;in the bonds of the strictest legal scrupulosity: they&nbsp;regarded a vegetable diet (Ad^ara) as alone permissible,&nbsp;rejecting the use of animal food (xiv. 2), and they also&nbsp;observed certain days (xiv. 5), by which, there can be no&nbsp;doubt, the Jewish sabbaths and festivals must be understood. In fact they were legal Jewish Christians, but&nbsp;Jewish Christians who in their asceticism went beyond&nbsp;the precepts of Mosaism, which indeed prohibits the use&nbsp;of the flesh of unclean animals, but not animal food&nbsp;in general. Over against these Jewish Christian ascetics,&nbsp;called by Paul “the weak in the faith,” stood another&nbsp;section, whom he describes as “the strong.” They&nbsp;rejected these legal observances, taking their stand on&nbsp;the gospel as freed from the law. But the latter must&nbsp;have been in the majority, for they are exhorted by the&nbsp;apostle to have a tender regard for the weakness of their&nbsp;brethren, and not by any harsh terrorism to force them&nbsp;into any courses which might offend their consciences.&nbsp;Such an exhortation, as Weizsacker remarks, would have&nbsp;no meaning if the representatives of the freer view were&nbsp;not in the majority. The majority, then, of the church&nbsp;at Rome was Gentile Christian not only by origin but by&nbsp;conviction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Here two problems arise, neither of which received sufficient attention from critics before Baur : (1) How are&nbsp;we to explain the origin, outside the limits of Paul’s&nbsp;activity, of a Christian community thus free from the&nbsp;fetters of the law </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">1</span><span class="font0"> and (2) How came it about that Paul&nbsp;should have addressed to such a community a letter like&nbsp;this,—adapted, as it appears to be, for Jewishly-inclined&nbsp;readers ? As regards the first question, in the absence of&nbsp;adequate materials for a conclusive solution, our answer&nbsp;can only be conjectural. The problem is a difficult one,&nbsp;because, following Gal. ii., we must start with the assumption that the communities founded under the more direct&nbsp;influence of the original apostles did not reject the&nbsp;Jewish law. In seeking, then, to account for the existence&nbsp;of a community which had so done, we must carry with&nbsp;us the fact that within the wide limits of the Jewish&nbsp;Dispersion very various degrees of strictness in observance&nbsp;of the law were to be found. Even those who were in&nbsp;the truest sense members of the communities of the Dispersion can hardly have observed the law as strictly as&nbsp;did the Pharisees in Palestine. But the demands made&nbsp;on those “ God-fearing ” Gentiles who were wont to attach&nbsp;themselves, more or less' closely, to the Jewish communities must of course have been still more accommodating.&nbsp;If only they accepted the monotheistic religion and its&nbsp;worship without the use of images, the ceremonial precepts laid upon them were reduced to a bare minimum,—&nbsp;the observance of Sabbaths, and also of some laws regarding meat. Now the community at Rome seems to have&nbsp;chiefly arisen out of the circles of such “God-fearing”&nbsp;Gentiles. As Paul himself gained access for the preaching of the gospel, at Thessalonica, for example, principally&nbsp;among the “ God-fearing Greeks ” (Acts xvii. 4), so also&nbsp;in Rome do these seem to have been the main element in&nbsp;the church. On this assumption we can understand how</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
