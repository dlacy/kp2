<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">also have a supreme deity, called Tsui- or Tsuni-Koab (the wounded knee) by the colonial Hottentots, Heitsi-eibib&nbsp;(wooden face) by the Namaqua. He, too, like the highest&nbsp;god of the Bantu, is the ancestor of the race and the chief&nbsp;of souls and spirits. But the primitive myth current&nbsp;about him shows that he was originally a moon-god, contending with the spirit of darkness. The altars intended&nbsp;for sacrifices to this god are now called his graves, and the&nbsp;Bantu, who do not use them, call them chiefs’ graves.&nbsp;The great dilference between the religions of the Khoi-Khoin and the other Nigritians is the total absence of&nbsp;animal worship and of fetichism by which it is characterized. Even sorcery and magic are still very primitive&nbsp;among them. Therefore they must be considered as a&nbsp;distinct family among the African tribes, only allied to&nbsp;the so-called Bushmen (Ba-tua, Ba-roa, or Soaqua, Sonqua),&nbsp;who seem to be a degraded race, sunk to the lowest degree&nbsp;of savagery, but who likewise worship a highest god and&nbsp;by whom likewise fetichism is not practised.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Chinese Religions, and their Relation to the Mongolic and Ural-Altaic.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">—This is perhaps the most knotty point&nbsp;in the genealogical classification of religions. There are&nbsp;ethnologists (as Oscar Pescliel) who bring not only the&nbsp;Chinese, with their nearest relatives the Japanese and&nbsp;Coreans,—all Ural-Altaic or Turanian nations,—but also&nbsp;the whole Malay race, including the Polynesians and&nbsp;Micronesians, and even the aboriginal Americans, from&nbsp;the Eskimo to the Patagonians and Fuegians, under one&nbsp;and the same vast Mongoloid family. There is indeed&nbsp;some similarity in the religious customs of the Americans&nbsp;and of the so-called Turanians; and even in the Polynesian&nbsp;religions some points of contact with those of the former&nbsp;might be discovered. Still, such conformities are but few&nbsp;and not very important, and do not justify our going so&nbsp;far.@@<sup>1</sup> Other ethnologists, like Friedrich Müller, do not&nbsp;admit the Americans, including the Hyperboreans of&nbsp;North America and the north-west of Asia, nor the&nbsp;Malayans and the Polynesians as members of the Mongolian race. This, according to them, only comprises the&nbsp;Chinese and their relatives in Tibet and the Transgangetic&nbsp;peninsula, the Japanese and Coreans, and the Ural-Altaic&nbsp;or Turanian nations. Now Prof. Max Midler@@<sup>2</sup> tries to&nbsp;. show that the religions of all those groups of nations—let&nbsp;us say, of this Mongolian race—are also bound together by&nbsp;a close relationship, because not only their character is&nbsp;fundamentally the same, but even the same name of the&nbsp;highest god, Tien, Tengre, Tangara, Ac., is met with&nbsp;among most of them. Putting aside the argument taken&nbsp;from the common name of the supreme deity, which is all&nbsp;but general among the members of this ethnical family&nbsp;and seems to have come from the Chinese to some of the&nbsp;Mongolians,@@<sup>3</sup> we cannot deny the fact that not only in the&nbsp;Ural-Altaic and Japanese but also in the highly-developed&nbsp;Chinese religions the relation between the divine powers&nbsp;and man is purely patriarchal. Just as the chief of the&nbsp;horde—nay, even the son of heaven, the Chinese emperor—&nbsp;is regarded as the father of all his subjects, whom they&nbsp;are bound to obey and to venerate, so are the gods to&nbsp;their worshippers. The only difference is that the Chinese&nbsp;heaven-god Tien is an emperor like his earthly representative, ruling over the other spirits of heaven and earth as&nbsp;does the latter over the dukes of the empire and their&nbsp;subjects, while the Ural-Altaic heaven-god is indeed the&nbsp;most powerful being, invoked in the greatest difficulties,&nbsp;when he only is able to save, but no supreme ruler,— not</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">anything more than a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>,</sup>primus inter pares,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> every other god being absolute lord and master in his own domain. Now&nbsp;this difference is not one of character but of progress, and&nbsp;answers fully to the difference of the political institutions&nbsp;of which it is the reflex.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The high veneration for the spirits of the deceased fathers, which are devoutly worshipped among all the&nbsp;members of this religious family, is a necessary consequence of its patriarchal type. But this feature is not&nbsp;less predominant among nations belonging to wholly&nbsp;different races. Another striking characteristic of the&nbsp;Mongolic religions is their extensive magic and sorcery&nbsp;(Shamanism). One might say that even the gods and the&nbsp;heroes of epic poetry are sorcerers, and that what their&nbsp;worshippers value above all are the magical powers they&nbsp;possess. Shamans are most highly honoured. One of the&nbsp;Chinese religions, and in fact that which contains the most&nbsp;ancient elements, we mean Taoism, involves the most&nbsp;implicit belief in sorcery, and even Buddhism, as it was&nbsp;adopted by the Mongols and the Chinese, has degenerated&nbsp;to all but pure Shamanism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">We are thus fully justified in assuming a Mongolian or patriarchal family of religions, of which the following are&nbsp;the principal subdivisions :—</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Chinese Religions,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> being (a) the </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">Ancient National&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">religion, now superseded partly by (6) Confucianism and&nbsp;(c) Taoism, partly, though only several centuries later, by&nbsp;Chinese Buddhism. What the ancient national religion&nbsp;was can only be gathered from its survivals in the still&nbsp;existing faiths. Confucianism claims to be a restoration of&nbsp;the old and pure institutions of the fathers, though it may&nbsp;just as well be said to be a thorough reform, and Taoism&nbsp;is, according to some European scholars, the original&nbsp;Chinese religion in its latest development—we should say,&nbsp;in its most miserable degradation. At all events, in some&nbsp;form or another, it is much older than Lao-tsze (6tli century&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">b.c., </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">see </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Lao-tsze), </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">though it has availed itself of his&nbsp;mystical treatise </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Tao-te-King</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> as a sacred book. There&nbsp;may be some truth in both these conflicting assertions.&nbsp;Without venturing to speculate on the origin of the&nbsp;Chinese nationality, which according to some is a mixture&nbsp;of autochthons with more civilized foreign invaders (the&nbsp;Hundred Families), nor on the possibility that this ethnic&nbsp;dualism may be the source of the two streams of religious&nbsp;development in China, we have some ground to hold Confucius’s reform as the renewal of a much older reform&nbsp;(Chowkung’s or even earlier), limited to the learned and&nbsp;the greater part of the upper classes,—Taoism on the contrary being a revival of the ancient popular Chinese&nbsp;religion, to which the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Tao-te-King</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> had to give the appearance of a philosophical basis. Chinese Buddhism does not&nbsp;differ much from the latter, and is now equally despised.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Japanese Religions,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> where we have again the same&nbsp;triad, nearly parallel to the Chinese : (a) the old national&nbsp;religion Kami-no־madsu (the way, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> the wprship, of the&nbsp;gods), called frequently Sin-to (Chinese Shin-tao, the&nbsp;way or worship of the spirits), with the mikado as its&nbsp;spiritual head, just as Chinese Taoism had its popes; (</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">b)&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Confucianism, imported from China in the 7th century;&nbsp;and (c) Buddhism, imported from Corea and nearly exterminated in the 6th century, but reviving, and at last,&nbsp;in the beginning of the 7tli century, triumphant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Finnic</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> branch of the Ural-Altaic religions, all recognizing the same heaven-god Num, Yum, Yummal, Yubmel,&nbsp;Yumala, as supreme. The primitive unity of this subdivision has been demonstrated by Castren, the highest&nbsp;authority upon it. By far the best known of this family&nbsp;are its North-European members, the religions of the&nbsp;Lapps, the Esthonians, and the Finns, but the two last&nbsp;named are not pure specimens of Ural-Altaic worship, as</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>@@@3</sup> The resemblance of the Mongolian Tengre, Tangara, to the Sumerian or Accadian Dingira appears to be equally fortuitous as that&nbsp;of the Polynesian Tangaroa (Taaroa) to the Melanesian Ndengei.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
