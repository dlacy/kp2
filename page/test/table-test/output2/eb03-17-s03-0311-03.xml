in general, denotes any thing that reſembles a ſerpent ; hence the worm or pipe of a ſtill, twilled in a spiral manner, is termed a <hi rend="italic">terpentine worm.</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Serpentine</hi> <hi rend="italic">Stony</hi> a genus of magnesian earths, of which there are different ſpecies : 1. The fibroſus, compoſed of fibrous and coherent particles. This reſembles the aſbeſtos ſo much that it might be confounded with it, were not the fibres of the ſerpentine ſo cloſely coherent, that they cannot be diſtinguished when the ſtone is cut or poliſhed. The fibres themſelves are large, and ſeem to be twilled, There are two varieties, a dark green and a light one ; the former ſrom Germany, the latter from Sweden. 2. The zoeblitz ſerpentine, found near that place, of many different colours, as black, deep green, light green, red, bluish-grey, and white ; but the green colour is most predominant.</p><p>3. Porcelain earth mixed with iron. It is met with either diffusible in water or indurated. The former is found of a red colour from China and Montmartre. The water-clinkers, imported from ſome places in Germany, ſeem to be made of this kind of earth. There are two varieties of the indurated kind, viz. the martial ſoap-earth, of a red colour, from Jaſherg and oilier places in Norway, or black from ſome parts of Sweden.</p><p>4. The telgſton of the Swedes, the ſame with the lapis ollaris.. It is found in various places of Norway, as light grey, dark grey, whitiſh-yellow, and dark green. It is employed with great advantage for building fire-places, furnaces, &amp; c. the extremities of the ſtrata being turned towards the fire when it is ſlaty.</p><p>M. Magellan obſerves, that there is a great variety of colour as well as compoſition in this kind of ſtones ; it being found either white, green, brown, yellow, light- blue, black, ſpotted, or ſtreaked with veins of different colours. Its texture is either indistinct, obscurely laminar, or fibrous. The ſpecific gravity is from 2400 to 2650; and it is harder than ſoap-rock or steatites ; though not hard enough to strike fire with ſteel; being less ſmooth to the touch than ſteatites, but ſuſceptible of a good poliſh, looking like marble ; and is often met with in thin semitranſparent plates. It melts in a ſtrong heat without addition, and corrodes the crucibles, but hardens in a lower degree of heat. It is ilowly and partially soluble in acids, but does not efferveſce with them. According to Bayon’s analyſis, 100 parts of it contain about 41 or ſilex, or rattier mica; 33 of magnesia; 10 of argillaceous earth ; 12 of water, and about 3 of iron. That brought from Corsica contains a greater proportion of argil, and a ſmaller one of ſilex. The ſerpentine commonly ſo called, according to Fabroni, is a true lapis ollaris ; but has its name from being variegated with green, yellowiſh, and brown ſpots, like the ſkin of ſome ſerpents ; great quantities of it are found in Italy and Switzerland, where it is frequently worked into diſhes and other veſſels.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Serpentine</hi> verses, are ſuch as begin and end with the ſame word.
