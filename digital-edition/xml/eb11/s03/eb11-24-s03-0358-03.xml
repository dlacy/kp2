S. of Magdeburg by the railway to Halle and Leipzig. Pop. (1905) 17,786. It contains manufactories of chemicals, machinery, starch, white lead and various other articles, but is chiefly noted for its extensive salt springs and works, which produce about 75,000 tons of salt per annum. Large beds of rock-salt also occur in the neighbourhood, in which shafts have been sunk to a depth of more than 1200 ft. There is a harbour on the Elbe here, and a brisk trade is carried on in coal, grain and timber.</p><p>See Magnus, <hi rend="italic">Geschichte der Stadt Schönebeck</hi> (Berlin, 1880).</p></div></body></text></TEI>
