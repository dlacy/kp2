<p><span class="font2">The state first came under British influence in 1812. The chief, Venkat Raman Singh, was born in 1876, succeeded in 1880. and&nbsp;was created G.C.S.l. in 1897. During his minority the administration was reformed. He is Rajput of the Baghela branch of the&nbsp;Solanki race, and is descended from the founder of the Anhilwara&nbsp;Patan dynasty in Gujarat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The town of Rewa is 131 m. S. of Allahabad. Pop. (1901) 24, 608. It has a high school, also the Victoria and zenana hospitals and&nbsp;a model gaol. The political agent for Bagelkhand resides at&nbsp;Satna, on the East Indian railway: pop. (1901) 7471.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">REWA KANTHA, a political agency or collection of native states in India, subordinate to the government of Bombay. It&nbsp;stretches for about 150 m. between the plain of Gujarat and&nbsp;the hills of Malwa, from the river Tapti to the Mahi, crossing&nbsp;the Nerbudda or Rewa, from which it takes its name. The&nbsp;number of separate states is 61, many of which are under&nbsp;British jurisdiction. The only important one is Rajpipla&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(q.vf.</span><span class="font3"> It includes also five second-class states entitled Chota&nbsp;Udaipur, Bariya, Sunth, Lunawada and Balaimor. Total&nbsp;area, 4972 sq. m. In 1901 the population was 479,065, showing a decrease of 35 % in the decade, due to the results of&nbsp;famine. Estimated revenue, £140,000; tribute (mostly to the&nbsp;gaekwar of Baroda), £10,000. Many of the inhabitants belong&nbsp;to the wild tribes of Bhils and Kolis. The political agent, who&nbsp;is also collector of the British district of the Panch Mahals,&nbsp;resides at Godhra.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">REWARD, recompense, a gift or payment in return for services rendered. “ Reward ” and “ regard ” are forms of&nbsp;the same word. Old French, from which both words came&nbsp;into English, also had </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">rewarder</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">regarder</span><span class="font3"> (the latter form&nbsp;only surviving in modern French), from </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">re-,</span><span class="font3"> back, in return,&nbsp;and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">warder, garder,</span><span class="font3"> to watch, protect—ultimately a Teutonic&nbsp;word, from the base </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">war-,</span><span class="font3"> to defend; cf. “ ward ” and “ guard,”&nbsp;which are thus also doublets. In early use in English, “ reward and “ regard ” were interchangeable in meaning;&nbsp;thus in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Piers Plowman,</span><span class="font3"> xi. 129, “ Reson rod forth and tok&nbsp;reward of no man,” cf. “ The towne doth receave ... an annuall&nbsp;regard for the same ” (a 16th-century reference quoted by the&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">New English Dictionary</span><span class="font3"> from R. Willis and J. W. Clark, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Archil.&nbsp;Hist, of Univ. of Cambridge,</span><span class="font3"> 1886). In use the words are now&nbsp;distinct, “ regard ” being restricted to such meanings as attention, respect, esteem, consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In English law the offering of rewards presents two distinct aspects: (1) with reference to the nature of the information&nbsp;or act for the giving or doing whereof the reward is offered;&nbsp;(2) with reference to the nature of the relation created between&nbsp;the person offering and the person claiming the reward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">Courts of assize and quarter sessions are empowered to&nbsp;order the payment of rewards to persons who have been active&nbsp;in or towards the apprehension of persons charged with certain&nbsp;specified crimes against person and property (Criminal Law,&nbsp;1826, ss. 28, 29; Criminal Justice Administration Act 1851,&nbsp;ss. 7, 8). The rewards are payable according to a scale fixed&nbsp;by the home secretary. In the case of courts of quarter sessions&nbsp;the maximum is £5. Courts of assize may award a larger sum&nbsp;where extraordinary courage and diligence have been shown&nbsp;towards the apprehension. The sums awarded are paid out&nbsp;of the rate or fund chargeable with the costs of assizes and&nbsp;sessions. It is illegal to advertise for the recovery of stolen&nbsp;property (including dogs) on terms of not asking questions&nbsp;(Larceny Act 1861, s. 102; Larceny Advertisements Acts 1870,&nbsp;s. 3). The advertiser and the newspaper which publishes it&nbsp;incur a penalty of £50. (See </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Mirams</span><span class="font3"> v. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Our Dogs Publishing&nbsp;Co.,</span><span class="font3"> 1901, 2 K.B, 564.) It is a criminal offence at common&nbsp;law to offer any reward on terms leading to compounding a&nbsp;felony or sheltering the offender (2?. v. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Burgess,</span><span class="font3"> 1886, 16 Q.B.D.&nbsp;141), and under the Larceny Act 1861 Jss. 20, 101) it is criminal&nbsp;to accept a reward for recovery of stolen property without&nbsp;bringing the thief to justice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where a reward is lawfully offered for information the&nbsp;person who first supplies the required information, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font3"> satisfies&nbsp;the conditions on which the reward is payable, is entitled to</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">recover by action the reward offered. Performance of the conditions is an acceptance of the offer </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Carlill</span><span class="font3"> v. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Carbolic&nbsp;Smoke Ball Co.,</span><span class="font3"> 1893, i Q.B. 256, 270). Thus on an advertisement for information leading to the arrest and conviction of&nbsp;shop-breakers, T. gave information which led to the arrest of R.,&nbsp;who while in prison told the police whcrc to find thc thieves.&nbsp;T. was held entitled to the reward </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Tarner</span><span class="font3"> v. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Walker,</span><span class="font3"> 1866, L.R.&nbsp;i Q.B. 641). This rule applies even where the offer is general&nbsp;to all the world </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Williams</span><span class="font3"> v. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Carwardine,</span><span class="font3"> 1833, 4 B. &amp; Ad. 621;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Spencerv. Harding<sub>1</sub></span><span class="font3">  1870, L. R. 5 C.P. 561). It would seem that&nbsp;on grounds of public policy an offender could not claim the&nbsp;reward on Surrenderinghimselfto justice </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Bentv. Wakefield &amp;c.&nbsp;Bank,</span><span class="font3"> 1878, 4 C.P.D. 1,4). It is not clear whether officers of&nbsp;justice are by their office and duty debarred from claiming&nbsp;rewards offered for the arrest of offenders (Ibid. p. 5).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">REWARI, a town of British India, in Gurgaon district of thc Punjab, 32 m. S.W. of Gurgaon, on thc Rajputana-Malwa&nbsp;railway. Pop. (1901) 27,295. It is an important centre of&nbsp;trade, being thc junction for the Rewari-Bhatinda branch of&nbsp;the Rajputana railway. The chief manufacture is that of brass-ware for cooking utensils.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">REWBELL, JEAN FRANÇOIS (1747-1807), French politician, was born at Colmar (then in the department of&nbsp;Haut-Rhin) on the 8th of October 1747. He was president&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(bâtonnier)</span><span class="font3"> of the order of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">avocats</span><span class="font3"> in Colmar, and in 1789 was&nbsp;elected deputy* to the States-General by the Third Estate of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bailliage</span><span class="font3"> of Colmar-Schlestadt. In the Constituent Assembly&nbsp;his oratorical gifts, legal knowledge and austerity of life gave&nbsp;him much influence. During the session of the Legislative&nbsp;Assembly he exercised the functions of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">procureur syndic</span><span class="font3"> and was&nbsp;subsequently secretary-general of the department of Haut-Rhin.&nbsp;In the Convention he was a zealous promoter of the trial of&nbsp;Louis XVI., but was absent on mission at the time of thc king’s&nbsp;condemnation. He took part in thc reactionary movement&nbsp;which followed the fall of Robespierre, and became a member&nbsp;of the reorganized Committees of Public Safety and General&nbsp;Security. The moderation he displayed caused his election&nbsp;by seventeen departments to the Council of Five Hundred.&nbsp;Appointed a member of the Directory on the ist of October&nbsp;1795, he became its president in 1796, and retired by ballot in&nbsp;1799. He then entered the Council of Ancients. After the&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">coup P état</span><span class="font3"> of 18 Brumaire he retired from public life, and died&nbsp;at Colmar on the 23rd of November 1807.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">REYBAUD, MARIE ROCH LOUIS (1799-1879), French writer, economist and politician, was born at Marseilles on the&nbsp;15th of August 1799. After travelling in the Levant and in&nbsp;India, he settled in Paris in 1829. Besides writing for the&nbsp;Radical press, he edited the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Histoire scientifique et militaire de&nbsp;Vexpédition française en Egypte</span><span class="font3"> in ten volumes (1830-36) and&nbsp;Dumont d’Urville’s </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Voyage autour du monde</span><span class="font3"> (1833).

In&nbsp;1846 he abandoned his democratic views, and was elected liberal&nbsp;deputy for Marseilles. His </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Jérôme Paturot à la recherche de la&nbsp;meilleure des républiques</span><span class="font3"> (1848) was a satire on the new Republican ideas. After the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">coup P état</span><span class="font3"> of 1849 he ceased to take&nbsp;part in public life, and devoted himself entirely to the study of&nbsp;political economy. To this period belong his </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">La Vie de l'employé&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">(1855); </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">L'Industrie en Europe</span><span class="font3"> (1856); and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Études sur le&nbsp;régime de nos manufactures</span><span class="font3"> (1859).
