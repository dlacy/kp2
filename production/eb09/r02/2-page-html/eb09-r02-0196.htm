<p><span class="font0">(cod. 166), who was of opinion that he belonged to a remote age, shortly after Alexander, and that he served as&nbsp;model to all subsequent writers of romance, including&nbsp;Lucius. A preliminary letter to a friend, Faustinus, indicates by the Latin name a much later origin. The heroes&nbsp;visit the Celts and the Aquitanians, both unknown to the&nbsp;Greeks at an early period. Certain paragraphs of the life&nbsp;of Pythagoras by Iamblichus are nearly identical with passages in Diogenes, who in his turn has similar correspondence with parts of Nicomachus Gerasenus, who lived under&nbsp;Tiberius. The natural inference is that all three writers&nbsp;copied from the same source. Modern authorities place&nbsp;Diogenes at the beginning of the 3d century. The recitals&nbsp;of their travels given by the Arcadian Dinias, the Phoenician Dercyllis, and her brother Mantinias are such as&nbsp;would be imagined by persons who had never left their&nbsp;native hamlet. The itinerary of the routes followed by&nbsp;the different personages is extremely confused. By Thule&nbsp;the writer probably understood Iceland or Norway, deriving his information from Pytheas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Latin </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Apollonius of Tyre</span><span class="font0"> is undoubtedly derived from a lost Greek original, and therefore claims a place&nbsp;here, as representing one of the earliest love-stories we&nbsp;can assign to that literature. It may date from the 3d or&nbsp;4th century, and was perhaps translated into Latin verse&nbsp;in the 5th century. What we now possess (beyond the&nbsp;Anglo-Saxon version mentioned below) is a second Latin&nbsp;prose translation made in the l2th or 13th century. The&nbsp;first mention of the work is in a list of books belonging&nbsp;to Wando, abbot of Fontanelle (742), in the diocese of&nbsp;Rouen. The story runs that Antiochus, king of Syria,&nbsp;entertaining an undue affection for his daughter Tarsia,&nbsp;keeps oft' suitors by an unsolvable riddle. But Apollonius,&nbsp;king of Tyre, discovers the answer, is obliged to fly, and&nbsp;(as well as Tarsia) undergoes many trials from pirates and&nbsp;other persecutors. An abridgment is included in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Gesta&nbsp;Romanorum.</span><span class="font0"> An ancient Anglo-Saxon translation was&nbsp;printed by Thorpe in 1834. Gower derived his adaptation in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Confessio Amantis</span><span class="font0"> (bk. viii.) from the rhymed&nbsp;redaction of Godfrey of Viterbo (1185). This formed the&nbsp;foundation of Shakespeare’s Pericles (1609). The earliest&nbsp;English version (1510) is made from the French </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Appoldyn,&nbsp;Roy de Thire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The author of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Cyropædia</span><span class="font0"> has already been alluded to. Suidas mentions other writers of fictions of the name&nbsp;of Xenophon,—a native of Antioch, who wrote </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Babyloηica&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">like Iamblichus; a native of Cyprus, who composed a&nbsp;similar book under the title of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Cypτiaca<sup>,</sup>,</span><span class="font0"> and Xenophon&nbsp;of Ephesus, of whom alone we possess anything. This&nbsp;last is the author of the romance </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ephesiaca, or the Loves&nbsp;of Anthia and Abrocomas,</span><span class="font0"> of which the Monte Cassino MS.&nbsp;(first published in 1726) is the only one extant. His age&nbsp;is unknown : by Locella, one of his editors, he is placed&nbsp;in the time of the Antonines ; Peerlkamp, another editor,&nbsp;considers him to be the oldest of the romancers writing in&nbsp;Greek, and that similar writers imitate him closely. Some&nbsp;go so far as to regard him as an imitator of Achilles Tatius&nbsp;and of Heliodorus, and bring him down to the 5th or 6th&nbsp;century. The story runs that Anthia and Abrocomas are&nbsp;married, and, being forbidden by an oracle to travel, of&nbsp;course do so, and are captured by pirates, who take them&nbsp;to Tyre, where Manto, daughter of the chief, falls in love&nbsp;with Abrocomas. Repelled by him, she marries Mceris and&nbsp;accuses Abrocomas of an attempt to violate her. Mceris&nbsp;in his turn pays improper attentions to Anthia. The great&nbsp;beauty of the hero and heroine causes them many trials at&nbsp;the hands of pirates, brigands, and other stock ornaments&nbsp;of the Greek novel. The local names of the tales of&nbsp;Iamblichus and Xenophon were probably suggested by the&nbsp;Mιλψrιακα collected by the earlier writers Dionysius and</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Aristides of Miletus. This is the weakest of the class we have under review ; its only merit lies in a simple and&nbsp;natural style. By far the best of the romances is the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Æthiopica</span><span class="font0"> of Heliodorus of Emesa (g<sup>,</sup>.v.). From its&nbsp;first appearance and throughout the whole Byzantine&nbsp;period this work enjoyed a reputation which it has not&nbsp;entirely lost. Within recent times three Frenchmen of&nbsp;mark have praised it,—Amyot, who translated it; Racine,&nbsp;with whom it was a favourite ; and Boileau, who compared&nbsp;it with the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Telemaque</span><span class="font0"> of Fénelon. It influenced considerably the French romance-writers of the 17 th century,&nbsp;D’Urfé, Gomberville, and Mademoiselle de Scudéry. The&nbsp;dénoûment is imitated in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pastor Fido</span><span class="font0"> of Guarini ;&nbsp;Tasso drew from it the early life of Clorinda in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Geru-salemme Liberata</span><span class="font0"> ; and Raphael painted scenes from it.&nbsp;It was first brought to light in modern times in a MS.&nbsp;from the library of Matthias Corvinus, found at the sack&nbsp;of Buda (Ofen) in 1526, and printed at Basel in 1534.&nbsp;Other codices have since been discovered. The title is&nbsp;taken from the fact that the action of the beginning and&nbsp;end of the story takes place in Æthiopia. The daughter&nbsp;of Persine, wife of Hydaspes, king of Æthiopia, was born&nbsp;white through the effect of the sight of a marble statue&nbsp;upon the queen during pregnancy. Fearing an accusation&nbsp;of adultery, the mother gives the babe to the care of Sisi-mithras, a gymnosophist, who carries her to Egypt and&nbsp;places her in charge of Charicles, a Pythian priest. The&nbsp;child is taken to Delphi, and made a priestess of Apollo&nbsp;under the name of Chariclea. Theagenes, a noble Thessalian, comes to Delphi and the two fall in love with&nbsp;each other. He carries off the priestess with the help of&nbsp;Calasiris, an Egyptian, employed by Persine to seek for&nbsp;her daughter. Then follow many perils from sea-rovers&nbsp;and others, but the chief personages ultimately meet at&nbsp;Meroe at the very moment when Chariclea is about to be&nbsp;sacrificed to the gods by her own father. Her birth is&nbsp;made known, and the lovers are happily married. The&nbsp;rapid succession of events, the variety of the characters,&nbsp;the graphic descriptions of manners and of natural scenery,&nbsp;the simplicity and elegance of the style, give the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Æthiopica&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">great charm. Its chaste tone compares favourably with&nbsp;many of the other works of the same class.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Perhaps the most widely known is the delightful pastoral of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Daphnis and Chloe</span><span class="font0"> (or Λεσβιακά), generally attributed&nbsp;to Longus, a Greek sophist, who is supposed to have lived&nbsp;in the 4th or the early part of the 5th century. Longus&nbsp;shows traces of an imitation of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Æthiopica</span><span class="font0"> of Heliodorus,&nbsp;with whom he may be placed in the first rank of such&nbsp;writers. His work formed the model of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sireiηe</span><span class="font0"> of&nbsp;Honoré d’Urfé, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Diana</span><span class="font0"> of Montemayor, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Aminta</span><span class="font0"> of&nbsp;Tasso, and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Gentle Shepherd</span><span class="font0"> of Allan Ramsay, and has&nbsp;been translated into every European language. The translation of Amyot, afterwards revised by P. L. Courier, has&nbsp;made it extremely popular in France, where the subject has&nbsp;frequently been made use of by Gérard and other painters.&nbsp;The celebrated </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Paul et Virginie</span><span class="font0"> is an echo of the same&nbsp;story. Daphnis and Chipe, two children found by shepherds, grow up together, nourishing a mutual love which&nbsp;neither suspects. The development of this simple passion&nbsp;forms the chief interest, and there are few incidents.&nbsp;Chloe is carried off by the inevitable pirate, and ultimately&nbsp;regains her family. A few rivals alarm the peace of mind&nbsp;of Daphnis ; but the two lovers are recognized by their&nbsp;parents, and return to a married and happy life in the&nbsp;country. The picture of rural felicity and the innocent&nbsp;affection of the children make the charm of a book which&nbsp;comes nearer perhaps in spirit to the modern novel than&nbsp;any other of its class. Unfortunately there are details here&nbsp;and there which shock modern ideas of decent propriety.&nbsp;Achilles Tatius or Statius, an Alexandrian rhetorician of</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
