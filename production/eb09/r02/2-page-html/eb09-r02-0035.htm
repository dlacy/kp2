<p><span class="font1">RESINA, a town of Italy, 6 miles south-east of Naples and practically a southern continuation of Portici, is well&nbsp;known as the usual starting place for tourists on their&nbsp;way up Vesuvius, and as the nearest town to the buried&nbsp;city of Herculaneum. It had 13,626 inhabitants in 1881&nbsp;(commune 15,593).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RESINS. A resin is a secretion formed in special resin canals or passages of plants, from many of which, such&nbsp;as, for example, coniferous trees, it exudes in soft tears&nbsp;hardening into solid masses in the air. Otherwise it may&nbsp;be obtained by making incisions in the bark or wood of&nbsp;the secreting plant. Resin can also be extracted from&nbsp;almost all plants by treatment of the tissue with alcohol,&nbsp;and it is formed by the oxidation of essential oils, many&nbsp;authorities being of opinion that all true resins, which are&nbsp;in chemical composition oxidized hydrocarbons, result&nbsp;primarily from the action of oxygen on essential oils.&nbsp;Resinous substances are further produced by the dry&nbsp;distillation of numerous organic compounds and by the&nbsp;drying of fatty drying oils. Certain resins are obtained&nbsp;in a fossilized condition, amber being the most notable&nbsp;instance of this class, and African copal and the kaurie&nbsp;gum of New Zealand are also procured in a semi-fossil condition. The resins which are obtained as natural exudations&nbsp;are in general compound bodies containing more than one&nbsp;simple resin and varying proportions of essential oil. These&nbsp;compounds when soft are known as oleo-resins, and when&nbsp;imperfectly fluid they are called balsams. Other resinous&nbsp;products are in their natural condition mixed with gum or&nbsp;mucilaginous substances and known as gum-resins. Varying in constitution as these bodies do, they also difler&nbsp;widely in physical properties ; but the general conception&nbsp;of a resin is a noncrystalline body, insoluble in water,&nbsp;mostly soluble in alcohol, essential oils, ether, and hot fatty&nbsp;oils, combining -with alkalies to form resin soap, softening and melting under the influence of heat, not capable&nbsp;of sublimation, and burning with a bright but smoky&nbsp;flame. A typical resin is a transparent or translucent&nbsp;mass, with a vitreous fracture and a faintly yellow or brown&nbsp;colour, inodorous or having only a slight turpentine odour&nbsp;and taste. Many compound resins, however, from their&nbsp;admixture with essential oils, are possessed of distinct and&nbsp;characteristic odours. A series of gradations among resins&nbsp;may be traced from the hard glassy transparent copals&nbsp;through soft elemis and oleo-resins, semi-fluid balsams and&nbsp;fluid wood oils, to the most limpid essential oils. The&nbsp;hard transparent resins are principally used for varnishes&nbsp;and cement, while the softer odoriferous oleo-resins and&nbsp;gum-resins coutaining essential oils are more largely used&nbsp;for pharmaceutical purposes and incense. No systematic&nbsp;classification of resins lias yet been attempted, and there&nbsp;is much uncertainty as to the botanical source of some&nbsp;well-known commercial varieties, while the chemical constitution and relations of many still require elucidation.&nbsp;The following list embraces the principal resins of&nbsp;commerce, and particulars regarding the more important of&nbsp;these will be found under their respective headings.

<p><span class="font3">T</span><span class="font1">HE continued existence of an amœba in a pool of water, or of a white blood-cell in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">liquor sanguinis,</span><span class="font1"> depends upon a continual interchange of substances between&nbsp;the organism and the surrounding medium. The substances&nbsp;in question pass from the medium into the organism in a&nbsp;certain chemical form ; they pass from the organism into&nbsp;the surrounding medium with their chemical form modified. Regarding merely the initial and final stages of this&nbsp;reconstitution of chemical form, we may speak of it as&nbsp;being of the nature of an oxidation. This view does not&nbsp;profess to be comprehensive ; nevertheless, it is true that&nbsp;the metabolic and anabolic processes of cells, taken as a&nbsp;whole, resemble combustion at least to this extent that&nbsp;oxygen and oxidizable carbon take part in them, and that&nbsp;carbon dioxide results from them. Partly as a matter of&nbsp;tradition, and partly as a matter of convenience, physiologists have described the introduction of oxygen into the&nbsp;organism and the emission of carbon dioxide from it as&nbsp;the comρlemental portions of one process of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">respiration.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">Although such a combined consideration is not strictly&nbsp;philosophical, inasmuch as it leaves out of view the introduction of the carbon into the organism, yet it is extremely&nbsp;convenient because the two processes referred to do, in all&nbsp;classes of the animal kingdom from the highest to the&nbsp;lowest, involve the same organs and tissues in their performance. Respiration may therefore be defined as the&nbsp;aggregate of those processes which are concerned in the&nbsp;introduction of oxygen into the system and the escape of&nbsp;carbon dioxide from it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Respiration in such an organism as an amœba is extremely simple. The medium surrounding it contains a practically unlimited supply of oxygen, and is so vast that&nbsp;the carbon dioxide put out into the medium is quickly&nbsp;removed from the neighbourhood of the organism.
