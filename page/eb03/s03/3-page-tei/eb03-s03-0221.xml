He was put apprentice to a ſhoemaker ; but disliking this profeſſion, he abandoned it a few years after, and went to ſea. He was at first a cabin boy with Sir Chriſtopher Mynns, but applying to the ſtudy of navigation with indefatigable induſtry, his ſkill as a ſeaman ſoon raised him above that ſtation.</p><p>The corſairs of Tripoli having committed great outrages on the Engliſh in the Mediterranean, Sir John Narborough was ſent in 1674 to reduce them to reaſon. As he had received orders to try the effects of negociation before he proceeded to hostilities, he ſent Mr Shovel, who was at that time a lieutenant in his fleet, to demand ſatisfaction. The Dey treated him with a great deal of diſreſpect, and ſent him back without an anſwer. Sir John diſpatched him a second time, with orders to remark particularly the ſituation of things on ſhore. The behaviour of the Dey was worſe than ever. Upon Mr Shovel’s return, he informed Sir John that it would be poſſible, notwithſtanding their fortifications, to burn all the ſhips in the harbour. The boats were accordingly manned, and the command of them given to Lieut. Shovel, who ſeized the guardſhip, and burnt four others, without loſing a man. This action ſo terrified the Tripolins, that they ſued for peace.— Sir John Narborough gave ſo favourable an account of this exploit, that Mr Shovel was ſoon after made captain of the Sapphire, a fifth rate ſhip.</p><p>In the battle of Bantry-Bay, after the revolution, he commanded the Edgar, and, for his gallant behaviour in that action, was ſoon after knighted by king William. Next year he was employed in tranſporting an army into Ireland; a ſervice which he performed with ſo much diligence and dexterity, that the king raised him to the rank of rear-admiral of the blue, and delivered his commiſſion with his own hands. Soon after he was made rear admiral of the red, and ſhared the glory of the victory at La Hogue. In 1694, he bombarded Dunkirk. In 1703, he commanded the grand fleet in the Mediterranean, and did every thing in his power to aſſiſt the Proteſtants who were in arms in the Cevennes.</p><p>Soon after the battle off Malaga, he was preſented by prince George to Queen Anne, who received him graciouſly, and next year employed him as commander in chief.</p><p>In 1705 he commanded the fleet, together with the carls of Peterborough and Monmouth, which was ſent</p><p>into the Mediterranean; and it was owing to him chiefly that Barcelona was taken. After an unſucceſsful attempt upon Toulon, he ſailed for Gibraltar, and from thence homeward with a part of the fleet. On the 22d of October, at night, his ſhip, with three others, was caſt away on the rocks of Scilly. All on board periſhed. His body was found by ſome fiſhermen on the iſland of Scilly, who ſtripped it of a valuable ring, and afterwards buried it. Mr Paxton, the purſer of the Arundel, hearing of this, found out the fellows, and obliged them to diſcover where they had buried the body. He carried it on board his own ſhip to Portſmouth, from whence it was conveyed to London, and interred with great ſolemnity in Weſtminſter Abbey. A monument was afterwards erected to his memory by the direction of the Queen. He married the widow of his patron, Sir John Narborough, by whom he left two daughters, co-heireſſes.</p><p>SHOVELER, in ornithology, a ſpecies of <hi rend="smallcaps">A∙nλs.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">SHOULDER-blade,</hi> a bone of the ſhoulder, of a triangular figure, covering the hind part of the ribs, called by anatomiſts the <hi rend="italic">ſcapula</hi> and <hi rend="italic">omoplata.</hi> See <hi rend="smallcaps">Anatomy.</hi></p><p>SHOUT, <hi rend="smallcaps">clamour,</hi> in antiquity, was frequently uſed on eccleſiaſtical, civil, and military occaſions, as a ſign of approbation, and ſometimes of indignation.—Thus as Cicero, in an aſſembly of the people, was expoſing the arrogance of L. Antony, who had had the impudence to cauſe himſelf to be inſcribed the patron of the Romans, the people on hearing this raised a ſhout to ſhow their indignation. In the ancient military diſcipline, ſhouts were uſed, 1. Upon occasion of the general’s making a ſpeech or harangue to the army from his tribunal. This they did in token of their approving what had been propoſed. 2. Before an engagement, in order to encourage and ſpirit their own men, and fill the enemy with dread. This is a practice of great antiquity ; beſides which, it wants not the authority of reaſon to ſupport it ; for as mankind are endowed with two ſenſes, hearing and seeing, by which fear is raised in the mind, it may be proper to make uſe of the ear as well as the eye for that purpoſe. Shouts were alſo raised in the ancient theatre, when what was acted pleaſed the ſpectators. It was uſual for thoſe preſent at the burning of the dead to raiſe a great ſhout, and call the dead perſon by his name before they ſet fire to the pile.</p><p>SHOWER, in meteorology, a cloud condensed into <hi rend="smallcaps">Rain.</hi></p><p>SHREWMOUSE.
