<p><span class="font0">To expreſs X therefore as ſome function of √ </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">s </span><span class="font0">ſo as to anſwer theſe conditions, we ſee in general that X muſt be leſs than √∙<sup>r</sup>∙ And it muſt not be equal to&nbsp;any power of √<sup>,</sup>∙<sup>f</sup> whole index is leſs than unity, be-cauſe then would differ ſo much the more from unity as √Γ is greater. Nor muſt it be any multiple of&nbsp;√j ſuch as y√<sup>,</sup>j∙, for the ſame reaſem. If we make&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">X = √<sub>j</sub></span><span class="font0"> —K, K being a conſtant quantity, we may&nbsp;anſwer the firſt condition pretty well. But K muſt be&nbsp;very ſmall, that X may not become equal to nothing,&nbsp;except in ſome exceedingly ſmall value of √</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">s.</span><span class="font0"> Now&nbsp;the experiments will not admit of this, becauſe the ratio -  does not increaſe ſufficiently to correſpond with the velocities which we obſerve in certain ſlopes,&nbsp;unleſs we make K greater than unity, which again is in-conſiſtent with other experiments. We learn from ſuch&nbsp;canvaſſing that it will not do to make K a conſtant quantity. If we ſhould make it any fractionary power of √<sup>r</sup>x,&nbsp;it would make X = o, that is, nothing, when </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">s</span><span class="font0"> is = I,&nbsp;which is alſo contrary to experience. It would ſeem,&nbsp;therefore, that nothing will anſwer for K but ſome&nbsp;power of √h which has a variable index. The logarithm of </span><span class="font1">V<sup>z</sup></span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">j has this property. We may therefore&nbsp;try to make X = √r—log. √r. Accordingly if we try&nbsp;the equation V= , we ſhall find a</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">very great agreement with the experiments till the declivity becomes conſiderable, or about √-, which is much greater than any river. But it will not agree&nbsp;with the velocities obſerved in ſome mill courſes, and&nbsp;in pipes of a ſtill greater declivity, and gives a velocity&nbsp;that is too ſmall ; and in vertical pipes the velocity is&nbsp;not above one half of the true one. We ſhall get rid&nbsp;of molt of theſe incongruities if we make K conſiſt&nbsp;of the hyperbolic logarithm of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">V s</span><span class="font0"> augmented by a&nbsp;ſmall conſtant quantity, and by trying various values&nbsp;for this conſtant quantity, and comparing the reſults&nbsp;with experiment, we may hit on one ſufficiently exact&nbsp;for all practical purpoſes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Mr l)e Buat, after repeated trials, found that he would have a very great conformity with experiment&nbsp;by making K= log. λΛγ-{- i, 6, and that the Velocities&nbsp;exhibited in his experiments would be very well repreſented by the formula V ≈ -ji</span></p>

    <p><span class="font0">There is a circumſtance which our author ſeems tö have overlooked on this occaſion, and which is undoubtedly of great effect in theſe motions, viz. the mutual&nbsp;adhelion of the particles of water. This cauſes the&nbsp;water which is deſcending (in a vertical pipe for example) to drag more water after it, and thus greatly in-Creaſes its velocity. We have ſeeh an experiment in which&nbsp;the water iſſued from the bottom of a reſervoir through&nbsp;a long vertical pipe having a very gentle taper. It&nbsp;Was 15 feet long, one inch diameter at the upper end,&nbsp;and two inches at the lower. The depth of the water&nbsp;in the reſervoir was exactly one foot ; in a minute there&nbsp;were diſcharged 2<sub>τ</sub><sup>9</sup><sub>5</sub>∙ cubic feet of water. It muſt&nbsp;therefore have iſſued through the hole in the bottom of&nbsp;the reſervoir with the velocity of 8,8y feet per ſecond.&nbsp;And yet we know that this head of water could not&nbsp;make it paſs through the hole with a velocity greater&nbsp;than 6,y6 feet per ſecond. This increaſe muſt therefore have ariſen from the cauſe we have mentioned, and&nbsp;is a proof of the great intenſity of this force. We&nbsp;doubt not but that the diſcharge might have been&nbsp;much more increaſed by proper contrivances ; and we&nbsp;know many inſtances in water pipes where this effect&nbsp;is produced in a very great degree.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The following caſe is very diſtinct: Water is brought into the town of Dunbar in the county of Eaſt Lothian&nbsp;from a ſpring at the diſtance of about 3200 yards. It&nbsp;is conveyed along the firſt 1100 yards in a pipe of two&nbsp;inches diameter, and the declivity is 12 feet nine inches ; from thence the water flows in a pipe of 1⅛ diameter, with a declivity of 44 feet 3 inches, making in&nbsp;all 57 feet. When the work was carried as far as the&nbsp;two-inch pipe reached, the diſcharge was found to be&nbsp;27 Scotch pints, of 103⅛ cubic inches each in a minute.&nbsp;When it was brought into the town, the diſcharge&nbsp;was 28. Here it is plain that the deſcent along the&nbsp;ſecond ſtretch of the pipe could derive no impulſion&nbsp;from the firſt. This was only able to ſupply 2 7 pints*&nbsp;and to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">deliver</span><span class="font0"> it into a pipe of equal bore. It was not&nbsp;equivalent to the forcing it into a ſmaller pipe, and almoſt doubling its velocity. It muſt therefore have&nbsp;been </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">dragged</span><span class="font0"> into this ſmaller pipe by the weight of&nbsp;what was deſcending along it, and this water was exerting a force· equivalent to a head of 16 inches, increaſing&nbsp;the velocity from 14 to about 28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It muſt be obſerved, that if this formula be juft, there can be no declivity ſo ſmall that a current of water will not take place in it. And accordingly none&nbsp;has been obſerved in the ſurface of a ſtream when this&nbsp;did not happen. But it alſo ſhould happen with re-ſpect to any declivity of bottom. Yet we know that&nbsp;water will hang on the ſloping ſurface of a board without proceeding further. The cauſe of this ſeems to&nbsp;be the adheſiort of the water combined with its viſcidity. The viſcidity of a fluid preſents a certain force&nbsp;which muſt be overcome before any current can take&nbsp;place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A ſeries of important experiments were made by our author in order to aſcertain the relation between&nbsp;the velocity at the ſurface of any ſtream and that at</span></p>
