<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Abandonment of the Formular System, of Procedure@@<sup>1</sup> —</span><span class="font1"> The formular system, with its remit from the praetor to a sworn </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">judex </span><span class="font1">who was to try the cause, was of infinite advantage to the law;&nbsp;for the judgment was that of a free and independent citizen, untrammelled by officialism, fresh from some centre of business, and&nbsp;in full sympathy with the parties between whom he had to decide.&nbsp;Such a system was incompatible with the political arrangements&nbsp;of Diocletian and Constantine ; and it is with no surprise that&nbsp;we find the former of these sovereigns instructing the provincial&nbsp;governors that in future, unless when prevented by pressure of&nbsp;business (or, according to a later constitution of Julian’s, when&nbsp;the matter was of trifling importance), they were themselves to&nbsp;hear the causes brought before them from first to last, as had previously been the practice in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">extraordinariae cognitiones.</span><span class="font1"> The&nbsp;remit in such cases was not, as formerly, to a private citizen, but&nbsp;to what was called a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">judex pcdancus,</span><span class="font1"> probably a matriculated&nbsp;member of the local bar; and for a time his delegated authority&nbsp;was embodied in a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">formula</span><span class="font1"> after the old fashion. But even this&nbsp;exceptional use of it did not long survive, for an enactment by&nbsp;the two sons of Constantine, conceived in terms the most comprehensive, declared fixed styles to be but traps for the unwary, and&nbsp;forbade their use in any legal act whatever, whether contentious&nbsp;or voluntary. The result was, not only the formal disappearance&nbsp;of the distinction between the proceedings </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">in jure</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">in judicio,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">but the practical disappearance also of the distinctions between&nbsp;actions </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">in jus</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">in factum,</span><span class="font1"> and between </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">actiones directae</span><span class="font1"> and&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">actiones utiles,</span><span class="font1"> the conversion of the interdict into an </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">actio ex inter-dicto,</span><span class="font1"> admission of the power of amendment of the pleadings, condemnation in the specific thing claimed, if in existence, instead of&nbsp;its pecuniary equivalent, and execution accordingly by the aid of&nbsp;officers of the law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Under the new system a process was full from first to last of intervention by officials. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">in jus vocatio</span><span class="font1"> of the XII. Tables&nbsp;—the procedure by which a plaintiff himself brought his adversary&nbsp;into court—was a thing of the past. In the earlier part of the&nbsp;period the proceedings commenced with the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">litis denuntiatio</span><span class="font1"> introduced in the time of Marcus Aurelius and remodelled by Constantine ; but under Justinian (though probably begun before his&nbsp;reign) the initial step was what was called the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">libellus convenlionis.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">This wa3 a short and precise written statement addressed by the&nbsp;plaintiff to the court, explaining (but without detail) the nature&nbsp;of the action he proposed to raise and the claim he had to prefer ;&nbsp;this was accompanied with a formal undertaking to proceed with&nbsp;the cause and follow it out to judgment, under penalty of having&nbsp;to pay double costs to the defendant. If the judge was satisfied&nbsp;of the relevancy of the libel, he pronounced an interlocutor </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(inter-locutio)</span><span class="font1"> ordaining its service on the respondent; this was done by&nbsp;an officer of the court, who cited him to appear on a day named,&nbsp;usually at a distance of two or three months. The defendant,&nbsp;through the officer, put in an answer </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(libellus contradictionis),</span><span class="font1"> at&nbsp;the same time giving security for the proper maintenance of the&nbsp;defence and eventual satisfaction of the judgment. On the day&nbsp;appointed the parties were first heard on any dilatory pleas, such&nbsp;as defect of jurisdiction ; if none were offered, or those stated repelled, they then proceeded to expound their respective grounds&nbsp;of action and defence, each finally making oath of his good faith&nbsp;in the matter </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(juramentum calumniae),</span><span class="font1"> and their counsel doing&nbsp;the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">From this point, which marked the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">litis contcstatio</span><span class="font1"> or joinder of issue, the procedure was much the same as that </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">in judicio</span><span class="font1"> under the&nbsp;formular system. But in all cases in which the demand was that&nbsp;a particular thing should be given or restored, and the plaintiff&nbsp;desired to have the thing itself rather than damages, execution was&nbsp;specific and effected through officers of the law </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(manic militari).&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">Where, on the other hand, the condemnation was pecuniary, the&nbsp;usual course was for the judge, through his officers, to take possession of such things belonging to the defendant as were thought&nbsp;sufficient to satisfy the judgment </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(pignus in causa judicati captum),&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">and they were eventually sold judicially if the defendant still&nbsp;refused to pay ; the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">missio in bona</span><span class="font1"> of the classical period was rarely&nbsp;resorted to except in the case of insolvency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Falentinianian Law of Citations@@<sup>2</sup>—</span><span class="font1">This famous enactment, the production of Theodosius (II.), tutor of the youthful Valentinian III., was issued from Ravenna in the year 426, and&nbsp;was addressed to the Roman senate. It ran thus:—</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“We accord our approval to all the writings of Tapinian, Paul, Gaius, Ulpian, and Modestine, conceding to Gaius the same authority&nbsp;that is enjoyed by Paul, Ulpian, and the rest, and sanctioning the&nbsp;citation of all his works.

<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">tia)</span><span class="font1"> of those earlier writers whose treatises and statements of the law the aforesaid five have imported into their own works,—&nbsp;Scaevola, for example, and Sabinus, and Julian, and Marcellus,—and&nbsp;of all others whom they have been in the habit of quoting as authorities </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(omniumque quos illi eelebrarunt),</span><span class="font1"> provided always, as their&nbsp;antiquity makes them uncertain, that the texts of those earlier&nbsp;jurists are verified by collation of manuscripts. If divergent </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">dicta&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">be adduced, that party shall prevail who has the greatest number of&nbsp;authorities on his side ; if the number on each side be the same, that&nbsp;one shall prevail which has the support of Papinian ; but, whilst he,&nbsp;most excellent of them all, is to be preferred to any other single&nbsp;authority, he must yield to any two. [Paul’s and Ulpian’s notes&nbsp;on his writings, however, as already enacted, are to be disregarded. ]&nbsp;Where opinions are equal, and none entitled to preference, we leave&nbsp;it to the discretion of the judge which he shall adopt.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This constitution has always been regarded as a signal proof of the lamentable condition into which jurisprudence had sunk in&nbsp;the beginning of the 5th century. Constantine, a hundred years&nbsp;earlier, had condemned the notes of Ulpian and Paul upon Papinian. There were no longer any living jurists to lay down the law&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(jura condere)</span><span class="font1">; and, if it was to be gathered from the writings of&nbsp;those who were dead, it was well that the use of them should be&nbsp;regulated. The Valentiniauiau law proceeded so far in the same&nbsp;direction. It made a selection of the jurisconsults of the past&nbsp;whose works alone were to be allowed to be cited,—Papinian, Paul,&nbsp;Ulpian, and Modestine, the four latest patented counsel of any&nbsp;distinction ; Gaius, of authority previously only in the schools,&nbsp;but whose writings were now approved universally, notwithstanding that he had never possessed the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus respondendi</span><span class="font1"> ; and all the&nbsp;earlier jurists to whom those five had accorded their imprimator.&nbsp;But it went yet a step further, for it declared all of them, with the&nbsp;sole exception of Papinian, to be of the same authority, and degraded the function of the judge in most cases, so far at least as a&nbsp;question of law was concerned, to the purely arithmetical task of&nbsp;counting up the names which the industry of the advocates on&nbsp;either side had succeeded in adducing in support of their respective&nbsp;contentions. It is probable that, from the days of Hadrian down&nbsp;to Alexander Severus, when the emperor in his council had to frame&nbsp;a rescript or a decree, its tenor would be decided by the vote of the&nbsp;majority; but that was after argument and counter-argument,&nbsp;which must in many cases have modified first impressions. Taking&nbsp;the votes of dead men, who had not heard each other’s reasons for&nbsp;their opinions, was a very different process. It may have been&nbsp;necessary; but it can have been so only because a living jurisprudence had no existence,—because the constructive talent of the&nbsp;earlier empire had entirely disappeared.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">II. Axtejustinianian Collections of Statute and Jurisprudence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Gregorian and Hcrmogenian Codes.—</span><span class="font1">The first of these </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Codes</span><span class="font1"> I was a collection of imperial rescripts (with a few edicts, &amp;c.) made i&nbsp;by one Gregorianus in the very end of the 3d century, and probably :&nbsp;at the instigation of Diocletian, though whether in the East or the j&nbsp;West critics are unable to decide. The collection of Hermogenianus, i&nbsp;also of rescripts, seems to have been a supplement to the earlier&nbsp;one. As the latest enactment in it belongs to the year 365, the probability is that the collection was published about that time. Both&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Codes,</span><span class="font1"> although the work of private parties, received statutory recognition from Theodosius and Valentinian in their commission for&nbsp;the preparation of a collection of edictal law; and from the language&nbsp;of Justinian in reference to them there is reason to believe that in&nbsp;the courts they were regarded as authoritative, even to the ignoring&nbsp;of all rescripts not embodied in them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Theodosian Code and Post-Theodosian Novels.—</span><span class="font1">Three years': after the publication of the “law of citations” Theodosius nomi- s&nbsp;nated a commission to initiate the preparation of a body of law which,&nbsp;if his scheme had been carried into execution, would have rendered&nbsp;that of Justinian unnecessary. In a constitution some ten years&nbsp;later he explains the motives that had actuated him,—that he saw&nbsp;with much concern the poverty-stricken condition of jurisprudence&nbsp;and how very few men there were who, notwithstanding the prizes&nbsp;that awaited them, were able to make themselves familiar with the&nbsp;whole range of law; and that he attributed it very much to the&nbsp;multitude of books and the large mass of statutes through which it&nbsp;was dispersed, and which it was next to impossible for any ordinary&nbsp;mortal to master. His scheme was eventually to compile one single&nbsp;code from materials derived alike from the writings of the jurists,&nbsp;the Gregorian and Hermogenian collections of rescripts, and the&nbsp;edictal laws from the time of Constantine downwards. His language leaves no doubt that it was his intention to have this general&nbsp;code very carefully prepared, so as to make it a complete exponent&nbsp;of the law in force, which should take the place of everything,&nbsp;statutory or jurisprudential, of an earlier date. The collection of&nbsp;edicts which he directed his commissioners to prepare, and which&nbsp;was to contain all that had not been displaced by later legislation,&nbsp;even though some of them might be obsolete by disuse, was to be</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
