<p><span class="font0">reſearch they have displayed more ingenuity than judgement; and ſome have fancied that it may have exiſted as far back as the time of Ariſtotle; Dearchus, one of&nbsp;his diſciples, having written ſeveral works of this amuſing ſpecies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ Let us, however, be ſatisfied in deriving it from the Theagenes and Chariclea of Heliodorus, a biſhop who&nbsp;lived in the 4th century, and whoſe work has been lately&nbsp;tranſlated. This elegant prelate was the Grecian Fene-lon @@(a). Beautiful as theſe compoſitions are when&nbsp;the imagination of the writer is ſufficiently ſtored with&nbsp;accurate obſervations on human nature, in their birth,&nbsp;like many of the fine arts, they found in the zealots of&nbsp;religion men who oppoſed their progreſs. However&nbsp;Heliodorus may have delighted thoſe who were not in-ſenſible to the felicities of a fine imagination, and to&nbsp;the enchanting elegancies of ſtyle, he raiſed himſelf,&nbsp;among his brother eccleſiaſtics, enemies; who at length&nbsp;ſo far prevailed, that it was declared by a ſynod, that&nbsp;his performance was dangerous to young perſons, and&nbsp;that if the author did not ſuppreſs it, he muſt reſign his&nbsp;biſhoprick. We are told he preferred his romance&nbsp;to his biſhoprick. Even ſo late as in Racine’s time, it&nbsp;was held a crime to peruſe theſe unhallowed pages.&nbsp;He informs us, that the firſt effuſions of his muſe were&nbsp;in conſequence of ſtudying that ancient romance, which&nbsp;his maſter obſerving him to devour with the keenneſs of&nbsp;a famiſhed man, he ſnatched it from his hands and flung&nbsp;it in the fire; a ſecond copy experienced the ſame fate.&nbsp;What could Racine do? He bought a third, and took&nbsp;the precaution of devouring it ſecretly till he got it by&nbsp;heart; after which he offered it to his maſter with a&nbsp;ſmile to burn, if he choſe, like the others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The deciſion of theſe bigots was founded in their opinion of the immorality of ſuch works. They alleged,&nbsp;that the writers paint too warmly to the imagination,&nbsp;addreſs themſelves too forcibly to the paſſions; and in&nbsp;general, by the freedom of their repreſentations, hover&nbsp;on the borders of indecency. This cenſure is certainly&nbsp;well-founded. Many of the old romances, and even of&nbsp;the dramas, acted in Scotland two centuries ago, are&nbsp;ſuch as common proſtitutes would in this age think indecent. But we are at preſent concerned with the origin of romance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ The learned Fleury thinks that they were not known till the 12th century, and gives as their original the&nbsp;hiſtory of the dukes of Normandy. Verdier, whoſe&nbsp;opinion is of no great weight, ſays the invention of romance was owing to the Normans of France; and that&nbsp;theſe fictions being originally written in the old Norman language, they were intitled </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Normances;</span><span class="font0"> the name&nbsp;was afterwards altered to that of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Romances.</span><span class="font0"> The Spaniards, who borrowed them from the French, called&nbsp;them </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Romanzes,</span><span class="font0"> which alſo did the Italians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ Dom Rivet, one of the learned aſſociates of the con</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">gregation of St Maur, authors of the Literary Hiſtory of France, fixes their origin in the 10th century. He&nbsp;ſays, that the moſt ancient romance known was one&nbsp;which appeared in the middle of that century, under&nbsp;the title of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Philomena,</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">the Beloved.</span><span class="font0"> This romance&nbsp;contains the pretended exploits of Charlemagne before&nbsp;Narbonne. At Toulouſe, he tells us, they have pre-ſerved a copy of the Philomena in its original language;&nbsp;that is to ſay, the Romaunt or poliſhed; ſuch as was&nbsp;then ſpoken at court. They preferred this language&nbsp;to the Latin, which was then that of the. common&nbsp;people, but vitiated with their corruptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ So far have we travelled on the road of conjecture: we ſhall now turn into the path of fact. It is certain&nbsp;that theſe compoſitions derive their name from the language in which they were firſt written. Abbé Iraild&nbsp;has given us the character of the earlieſt romances,&nbsp;which we ſhall tranſcribe; for to add to what is well ex-preſſed, however it may pleaſe the vanity of a writer,&nbsp;ſeldom tends to the gratification of the reader.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">‘ The firſt romances were a monſtrous aſſemblage of hiſtories, in which truth and fiction were equally&nbsp;blended, but all without probability; a compoſition of&nbsp;amorous adventures, and all the extravagant ideas of&nbsp;chivalry. The incidents are infinitely multiplied; deſti-tute of connection, of order, and art. Theſe are the ancient and miſerable romances which Cervantes, in his&nbsp;celebrated ſatirical romance of Don Quixote, has covered with an eternal ridicule. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ It is, however, from theſe productions rather in their improved ſtate, that poets of all nations have drawn&nbsp;their richeſt inventions. The agreeable wildneſs of that&nbsp;fancy which characteriſed the eaſtern nations was caught&nbsp;by. the cruſaders. When they returned home, they&nbsp;mingled in their own the cuſtoms of each country. The&nbsp;Saracens, who were men like themſelves, becauſe they&nbsp;were of another religion, and were therefore- their enemies, were pictured under the tremendous form of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pay-dim Giants.</span><span class="font0"> The credulous reader of that day followed&nbsp;with trembling anxiety the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Red-croſs Knight.</span><span class="font0"> It was&nbsp;thus that fiction embelliſhed religion, and religion invigorated fiction. Such incidents have enlivened the&nbsp;cantos of Arioſto, and adorned the epic of Taffo.&nbsp;Spenſer is the child of their creation; and it is certain&nbsp;that we are indebted to them for ſome of the bold and&nbsp;ſtrong touches of Milton. ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Other circumſtances however have been aſſigned as the ſources of theſe extravagant fictions. “ Caſtles were,&nbsp;erected to repulſe the vagrant attacks of the Normans;&nbsp;and in France (from the year 768 to 987) theſe places&nbsp;became fatal to the public repoſe. The petty deſpots&nbsp;who raiſed theſe caſtles, pillaged whoever paſſed, and&nbsp;carried off the females who pleaſed them. Rapine, of&nbsp;every kind, was the privilege of Lords! Mezeray ob-ſerves, that it is from theſe circumſtances romancers</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">@@@(a) An ingenious and learned friend inquires,</span><span class="font0"><sup>,</sup> Is not the romance of the Golden Aſs, by Apuleius, to be conſidered. as an earlier ſpecimen than that of Heliodorus? ’ To this </span><span class="font1">our </span><span class="font0">author has no objection; but he would&nbsp;not warrant </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">any</span><span class="font0"> romance to be the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">firſt</span><span class="font0"> that ever was written. It is thus that ſome writers, more learned than&nbsp;ſagacious, have diſcovered the firſt inventor of epiſtolary correſpondence. A lady receives this honour: ſuch&nbsp;learning is deſperate! From the Aſiatic Reſearches and other publications on Oriental literature, we are led to&nbsp;believe, that the native country of </span><span class="font1">romance is the eaſt;</span><span class="font0"> </span><span class="font1">where it ſeems to have flouriſhed in all its extravagant&nbsp;grandeur from time immemorial,</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
