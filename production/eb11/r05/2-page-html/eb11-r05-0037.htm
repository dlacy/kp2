<body><h2><a name="caption1"></a><span class="font1">large number oi societies now active in the promotion of special branches of science.</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">From the time of its royal founder onwards the Royal Society has constantly been appealed to by the government for advice in connexion with scientific undertakings of national importance. The&nbsp;following are some of the principal matters of this character upon&nbsp;which the society has been consulted by, or which it has successfully&nbsp;urged upon the attention of, the government: the improvement&nbsp;and equipment of the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, in 1710, when&nbsp;it was placed in the sole charge of the society; the change of the&nbsp;calendar in 1752; ventilation of prisons; protection of buildings&nbsp;and ships from lightning; measurement of a degree, of latitude;&nbsp;determination of the length of a pendulum vibrating seconds;&nbsp;comparison of the British and French standards of length; the&nbsp;Geodetic Survey in 1784, and the General Trigonometrical. Survey&nbsp;begun in 1791; expeditions to observe the transits of Venus in 1761,&nbsp;1769 (commanded by Captain Cook), 1877 and 1882; the Antarctic&nbsp;expeditions of 1772 (under Captain Cook, whose voyage extended to&nbsp;the circumnavigation of the globe), of 1839 (under Ross), and 1900;&nbsp;observations for determining the density of the earth; Arctic&nbsp;expeditions of 1817 (in search of the North-West Passage), of 1819&nbsp;(under Parry), of 1827 (Parry and Ross), of 1845 (Franklin), of 1874&nbsp;(under Nares); numerous expeditions for observing eclipses of the&nbsp;sun; 1822, use of coal-tar in vessels of war; best manner of&nbsp;measuring tonnage of ships; 1823, corrosion of copper sheathing by&nbsp;sea-water; Babbage’s calculating machine; lightning-conductors&nbsp;for vessels of war; 1825, supervision of gas-works; 1832, tidal&nbsp;observations; 1835, instruments and tables for testing the strength&nbsp;of spirits; magnetic observatories in the colonies; 1862,.the great&nbsp;Melbourne telegraph; 1865, pendulum observations in India;&nbsp;1866, reorganization of the meteorological department; 1868, deep-sea research; 1872, “Challenger” expedition;. 1879, prevention&nbsp;of accidents in mines; 1881, pendulum observations; cruise of the&nbsp;“ Triton ” in Faroe Channel; 1883, borings in delta of Nile; 1884,&nbsp;Bureau des Poids et Mcsures; international conference on a prime&nbsp;meridian; 1888, inquiry into lighthouse illuminants; 1890, the&nbsp;investigation of colour-blindness; 1895, examination of the structure&nbsp;of a coral reef by boring; 1896, inquiry into cylinders for compressed&nbsp;gases; the establishment of an International Geodetic Bureau;&nbsp;1897, determination of the relations between the metric and imperial&nbsp;units of weights and measures; and, more recently, an inquiry into&nbsp;the volcanic eruptions in the West Indies; international seismological investigation; international exploration of the upper&nbsp;atmosphere; measurement of an arc of the meridian across Africa.&nbsp;In recent years also the society, acting at the request of the government, has taken the leading part in investigations, in. the course of&nbsp;which important discoveries have been made, in relation to various&nbsp;tropical diseases, beginning with the tsetse-fly disease of cattle in&nbsp;Africa, followed by investigations into malaria, Mediterranean fever&nbsp;and sleeping sickness. The society has standing committees, which&nbsp;advise the Indian government on matters connected with scientific&nbsp;inquiry in India and on the observatories of India. The society&nbsp;has taken a leading part in the promotion of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">International&nbsp;Catalogue of Scientific Literature from 1900,</span><span class="font0"> and of the International&nbsp;Association of Academics, which is composed of all the principal&nbsp;scientific academics of the world, meeting regularly to promote&nbsp;international action in questions of scientific interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In addition to the occasional services enumerated above, the Royal Society has exercised, and still exercises, a variety of important&nbsp;public functions of a more permanent nature. It still provides&nbsp;seven of the board of visitors of the Royal Observatory at Greenwich. From 1877 until the reconstitution of the Meteorological&nbsp;Office in 1906 the society nominated the meteorological council,&nbsp;which had the control of that office. The society has the custody&nbsp;of standard copies of the imperial standard yard and pound. The&nbsp;president and council have the control of the National Physical&nbsp;Laboratory, an institution established in 1899 in pursuance of the&nbsp;recommendations of a treasury committee appointed by H.M.&nbsp;government in response to representations from the Royal Society.&nbsp;The society had previously for many years had control of the&nbsp;Kew Observatory, now incorporated with the National Physical&nbsp;Laboratory, and still remains trustee of the Gassiot Fund, a fund&nbsp;established for the maintenance of the observatory. The society&nbsp;elects four of the nine members of the managing committee of the&nbsp;Lawes Agricultural Trust, and is officially represented on the&nbsp;governing bodies of a number of important scientific and educational&nbsp;institutions and of the principal public schools.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">One of the most important duties, which the Royal Society performs on behalf of the government is. the administration of the&nbsp;annual grant of £4000 for the promotion of scientific research.&nbsp;This grant originated in a proposal by Lord John Russell in 1849&nbsp;that at the close of the year the president and council should point&nbsp;out to the first lord of the treasury a limited number of persons to&nbsp;whom the grant of a reward or of a sum to defray the cost of experiments might be of essential service. This grant of £1000 afterwards&nbsp;became annual, and was continued until-1876. In that year an&nbsp;additional sum of £4000 for similar purposes was granted, and the&nbsp;two funds of £1000 and £4000 were administered concurrently until&nbsp;1881, in which year the two were combined in a single annual grant&nbsp;of £4000 under new regulations. Since 1896 parliament has also&nbsp;voted annually a grant of £1000 to be administered by the Royal&nbsp;Society in aid of scientific publications, not only those issued by&nbsp;itself, but also scientific matter published through other channels.&nbsp;One of the most useful of the society’s publications is the great&nbsp;catalogue of scientific papers—an index now in twelve quarto&nbsp;volumes, under authors’ names, of all the memoirs of importance&nbsp;in the chief English and foreign scientific serials from the year 1800&nbsp;to the year 1883. The work was prepared under the direction of the&nbsp;Royal Society. A continuation carrying the catalogue up to the&nbsp;end of the 19th century, and a subject index to the whole catalogue,&nbsp;have also been compiled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A statement.of the trust funds administered by the Royal Society will be found in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book</span><span class="font0"> published annually, and the origin&nbsp;and history of these funds will be found in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Record of the Royal&nbsp;Society</span><span class="font0"> (2nd ed. 1901). The income of the society is derived from&nbsp;the annual contributions and composition fees of the Fellows, from&nbsp;rents and from interest on various investments. The balance-sheet and an account of the estates and property are published in&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book.</span><span class="font0"> Five medals (the Copley, two Royal, the Davy and&nbsp;the Hughes) are awarded by the society every year; the Rumford&nbsp;and the Darwin medals biennially, the Sylvester triennially and&nbsp;the Buchanan quinquennially. The first of these originated in a&nbsp;beguest by Sir Godfrey Copley (1709), and is awarded “ to the&nbsp;living author of such philosophical research, either published or&nbsp;communicated to the society, as may appear to the council to be&nbsp;deserving of that honour ”; the author may be an Englishman or&nbsp;a foreigner. The Rumford medal originated in a gift from Count&nbsp;Rumford in 1796 of £1000 3% consols, for the most important&nbsp;discoveries in heat or light made during the preceding two years.&nbsp;The Royal medals were instituted by George IV., and are awarded&nbsp;annually for the two most important contributions to science published&nbsp;in the British dominions not more than ten years nor less than one&nbsp;year from the date of the award. The Davy medal was founded&nbsp;by the will of Mr John Davy, F.R.S., the brother of Sir Humphry&nbsp;Davy, and is given annually for the most important discovery in&nbsp;chemistry made in Europe or Anglo-America. An enumeration of&nbsp;the awards of each of the medals and the conditions of the awards&nbsp;are published in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book.</span><span class="font0"> The society also has the award&nbsp;of three research studentships, one founded in 1890 in memory of&nbsp;J. P. Joule, and the others created out of a bequest to the society by&nbsp;Sir William Mackinnon in 1897.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Under, the existing statutes of the Royal Society every candidate for election into the society must be recommended by a certificate&nbsp;in writing signed by six or more Fellows, of whom three at least&nbsp;must sign from personal knowledge. From the candidates so recommended the council annually select fifteen by ballot, and the&nbsp;names so selected are submitted to the society for election by ballot.&nbsp;Princes of the blood, however, and not more than two persons&nbsp;selected by the council on special grounds once in two years, may&nbsp;be elected by a more summary procedure. Foreign members, not&nbsp;exceeding fifty, may be selected by the council from among men of&nbsp;the greatest scientific eminence abroad, and proposed to the society&nbsp;for election. Every Fellow of the society is liable to an admission&nbsp;fee of £10 and an annual payment of £4; but, by aid of a fund&nbsp;established in 1878 for the purpose, the admission fees and £1 of&nbsp;the annual contribution of all the Fellows elected since that date&nbsp;have been remitted. The composition for annual payments is £60.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The anniversary meeting for the election of the council and officers is held on St Andrew’s Day. The council for the ensuing&nbsp;year, out of which are chosen the president, treasurer, principal&nbsp;secretaries, and foreign secretary, must consist of eleven members&nbsp;of the existing council and ten Fellows who are not members of&nbsp;the existing council. These are nominated by the president and&nbsp;council previously to the anniversary meeting. The session of the&nbsp;society is from November to June; the ordinary meetings are held&nbsp;on Thursdays during the session, at 4.30 p.m. The selection for&nbsp;publication from the papers read before the society is made by&nbsp;the “ Committee of Papers,” which consists of the members of the&nbsp;council for the time being aided by committees appointed for the&nbsp;purpose. The papers so selected are published either in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Philosophical Transactions</span><span class="font0"> (4to) or the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Proceedings of the Royal Society&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(8vo), and one copy of each of these publications is presented gratis&nbsp;to every Fellow of the society and to the chief scientific societies&nbsp;throughout the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The making and repealing of laws is vested in the council, and in every case the question must be put to the vote on two several&nbsp;days of their meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The text of the charters of the Royal Society is given in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Record,</span><span class="font0"> and in the same work will be found, lists of the presidents,&nbsp;treasurers, secretaries and assistant-secretaries from the foundation&nbsp;to the year 1900. The same work gives a chronological list.of all&nbsp;the Fellows, with dates of election, and an alphabetical index.&nbsp;Other histories are Thomson’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History of the Royal Society</span><span class="font0"> (1812);&nbsp;Weld’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History of the Royal Society;</span><span class="font0"> Bishop Sprat’s (1667), which&nbsp;consists largely of a defence of the society against the attacks of&nbsp;a priori philosophers; and Dr Birch’s (1756), which treats mainly&nbsp;of the society’s scientific work.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(R.
