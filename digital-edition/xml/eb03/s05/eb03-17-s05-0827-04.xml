a beautiful and extenſive valley in Perthſhire, bounded on the north by the lofty ridge of mountains called the <hi rend="italic">Grampians,</hi> and on the ſouth by the Ochils, which are rounded on the tops and covered with verdure. It is called <hi rend="italic">Strαtheαrn</hi> from the river Earn, which runs through the middle of it from west to eaſt for about 30 miles. On each side of the banks of this beautiful ſtream are many villages and country-ſeats diſtinguiſhed for romantic situations. Were we to single out any of the villages, we would mention Crieff, which ſtands on a fine ſtoping ground on the north side of the Earn, and has been much admired by travellers for its ſituation, and the variety, contraſt, singularity, and beauty of the prospect which it affords.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
