<p><span class="font0">Rumania was now comparatively, but not entirely, free from fears of serious foreign complications. Austria and&nbsp;Russia alike resented the decision to fortify Bucharest&nbsp;and the Sereth line, adopted by the Rumanian government in 1882. Relations with Russia had remained&nbsp;strained ever since the war. The delimitation of the&nbsp;Dobrudja frontier was still unsettled, and owing to</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Russian opposition was not finally disposed of till 1884. Expenses incurred during the war led to much controversy,&nbsp;especially when the Russian government claimed the return of&nbsp;£120,000 advanced to enable the Rumanians to mobilize, and&nbsp;considered by them as a free gift. A compromise was made,&nbsp;both parties withdrawing their claims, in April 1882.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Relations with Austria-Hungary were also on a very unpleasant footing. There were two principal subjects of discord —the navigation of the Danube </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.)</span><span class="font0"> and the “ national&nbsp;question,” t.e. the status of the Vlach communities outside&nbsp;Rumania, and especially in Transylvania and Macedonia (see&nbsp;Vlachs and Macedonia). The Danube question became&nbsp;acute in 1881, 1883 and 1899; the national question is a&nbsp;more permanent source of trouble, affecting Austria-Hungary,&nbsp;Greece, Turkey and Bulgaria. King Charles, who naturally&nbsp;favoured the ally of Germany, and Bratianu, who regarded&nbsp;Russian policy with suspicion, endeavoured to promote a&nbsp;better understanding with Austria-Hungary. But there was&nbsp;a strong anti-German party in the country, especially among&nbsp;the old boiars and the peasantry. Community of creed, ancient&nbsp;traditional influence, the entire absence of Russian merchants,&nbsp;and | the consequent avoidance of many small commercial&nbsp;rivalries, contributed to bring about a sort of passive preference&nbsp;for Russia, while the bitter disputes that had occurred with.&nbsp;Germany on the question of railway finance had left a very&nbsp;hostile feeling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In March 1883 the government decided to introduce various important changes into the constitution. Three electoral colleges&nbsp;were formed instead of four; a considerable addition&nbsp;was made to the numbers of the senate and chamber;&nbsp;trial by jury was established for press offences, except&nbsp;those committed against the royal family and the&nbsp;sovereigns of foreign states; these were to be&nbsp;tried by the ordinary tribunals without jury. A bill was&nbsp;passed endowing the crown with state lands, giving an annual&nbsp;rent of £24,000 in addition to the civil list fixed in 1866 at&nbsp;£49,000; another measure granted free passes on the railways&nbsp;and an allowance of £1 daily during the sitting of parliament&nbsp;to all senators and deputies. The revision of the constitution&nbsp;had estranged the two heads of the Liberal party, I. C. Bratianu,&nbsp;who was mainly responsible for the new measures, and C. A.&nbsp;Rosetti, who unsuccessfully advocated reforms of a far more&nbsp;democratic character. These two had been united by a most&nbsp;intimate friendship. One had never acted without the other.&nbsp;Rosetti was said to be the soul whilst Bratianu was the voice&nbsp;of the same personality. Henceforward Bratianu had sole&nbsp;control of the Liberal government. The revising chambers&nbsp;having fulfilled their special mandate, were dissolved in September 1884, and a new parliament assembled in November,&nbsp;the government, as usual, obtaining a large majority in both</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">houses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Since 1876 Bratianu had exercised an almost dictatorial power, and anything like a powerful parliamentary opposition&nbsp;had ceased to exist. But he had been too long in&nbsp;power; the numerous state departments were exclusively filled'with his nominees; and some pecuniary&nbsp;scandals, in which the minister of war and other&nbsp;high officials were implicated, helped to augument his&nbsp;fast-growing unpopularity. New parties were formed in&nbsp;opposition, and the National Liberal and Liberal-Conservative&nbsp;parties combined to attack him. The first of these maintained that the government should be essentially Rumanian,&nbsp;and, while maintaining friendly relations with foreign Powers,&nbsp;should in no wise allow them to interfere with interal affairs.&nbsp;They also advocated reduction of expenditure and the independence of the magistracy. The Liberal-Conservatives held&nbsp;generally the same views, but had as their ideal of foreign&nbsp;policy a guaranteed neutrality. Another party which now&nbsp;attracted considerable attention was that of the Junimists,&nbsp;or Young Conservatives. The name was taken from the&nbsp;Junimea, a literary society formed in Jassy in 1874 by P.&nbsp;Carp, T. Rosetti, and Maiorescu, and transformed into a political&nbsp;association in i88r. Their programme for home affairs involved the amelioration of the position of the peasantry and&nbsp;artisan classes, whose progress they considered had been&nbsp;overlooked, the irremovability of the magistracy, and a revision&nbsp;of the communal law in the sense of decentralization. In&nbsp;financial matters they advocated the introduction of a gold&nbsp;standard and the removal of the agio on gold, also the introduction of foreign capital to develop industries in the country;&nbsp;and as regards foreign policy, they were strong advocates of&nbsp;intimate and friendly relations with Austria-Hungary. Elections for a new chamber took place in February 1888, and the&nbsp;whole of the leaders of the opposition were elected, including&nbsp;Dimitrie Bratianu, the premier’s brother, and Lascar Catargiu.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">I. </span><span class="font0">C. Bratianu definitely retired on the 4th of April, after having&nbsp;held the premiership for twelve eventful years. Had he continued much longer in office it is probable that there would&nbsp;have been a revolutionary movement against the dynasty.&nbsp;During the previous parliament a Conservative manifesto,&nbsp;signed by Catargiu, D. Bratianu and other leaders of the&nbsp;opposition, openly threatened that if the ministers were not&nbsp;removed before the general election, the responsibility would&nbsp;be thrown, “ not on those who served the crowfi, but on him&nbsp;who bore it ”; and the name of Prince George Bibescu had&nbsp;beenjjpenly mentioned as a possible successor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">I n't he new chamber elected in October 1888 only five members of Bratianu’s party retained their seats. The most prominent&nbsp;statesman in the new Conservative-Junimist administration was P. Carp, who in the spring of 1889&nbsp;succeeded in passing a bill which authorized the&nbsp;distribution of state lands among the peasantry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Despite this admirable measure, he was unable to retain office, and three changes of ministry followed.&nbsp;The Conserva ti ve-Junimist parliament nevertheless restored&nbsp;tranquillity to the country. On the 22nd of May 1891, the&nbsp;25th anniversary of the king’s accession was celebrated with&nbsp;great enthusiasm. Meanwhile the gold standard had been&nbsp;introduced (1889), and the financial situation was regarded as&nbsp;satisfactory. In December 1891 a stable cabinet was at&nbsp;last formed by Lascar Catargiu. The new ministry during&nbsp;their four years’ tenure of office passed several useful measures&nbsp;through parliament. The state credit was improved by the conversion of the public debt; the sale of the state lands to the&nbsp;peasantry was actively continued; a law was passed making&nbsp;irremovable the judges of the court of appeal and the presidents&nbsp;of tribunals, and other important judicial reforms were carried&nbsp;out; a mining law was passed with the object of introducing&nbsp;foreign capital; and the commercial marine was developed&nbsp;by the formation of a state ocean service of passsenger and&nbsp;cargo steamers. Great reforms, which had been unsuccessfully&nbsp;attempted by former governments, were made in the service&nbsp;of public instruction and in the organization of the clergy.&nbsp;In 1893 and 1894 commercial and extradition treaties and a&nbsp;trade-mark convention were made with Great Britain, Austria-Hungary and Germany. Meanwhile the Liberal opposition&nbsp;was being reorganized. On the death of I. C. Bratianu, in&nbsp;1891, his brother Dimitrie was proclaimed chief of the united&nbsp;Liberal party, but he also died in June 1892, and the veteran&nbsp;statesman Dimitrie Sturdza was recognized as the head of the&nbsp;Liberals. In 1894 he started a very violent agitation in favour&nbsp;of the Rumanians in Hungary. Another popular opposition&nbsp;cry was “ Rumania for the Rumanians. ” The new mining&nbsp;law, among other concessions, gave foreigners the right to&nbsp;lease lands for long periods for the working of petroleum, and&nbsp;this was denounced by the opposition as being hostile to national&nbsp;interests, and also as being against the spirit of the constitution,</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
