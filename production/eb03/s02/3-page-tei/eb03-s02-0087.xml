Elizabeth could not reply, and therefore had recourſe to her uſual arts of treacherous negociation. New terms were propoſed to Mary, who would gladly have ſubmitted almoſt to any thing, provided ſhe could procure her freedom. It was propoſed, as had often been done before, to aſſociate the queen oſ Scots with her ſon in the government; but as this was to be referred to the king, who was in the hands of Elizabeth’s friends, and to the parliament, who were under the power of the ſame faction, it is eaſy to ſee that no ſuch aſſociation ever could take place, or indeed was ever intended.</p><p>After the death of Lenox, the conſpirators apprehended no further danger, little ſuppoſing that a prince ſo young and unexperienced could deliver himſelf from captivity. This, however, in the year 1583, he effected in the following manner. A convention of the eſtates had been ſummoned to meet at St Andrew’s. James, whom the earl of Arran, notwithſtanding his confinement at Kinneil, had found means to inſtruct and adviſe, pretended a deſire of viſiting his grand-uncle the earl of March, who reſided at St Andrew’s, and was for that purpoſe permitted to repair thither a few days before the convention. The better to deceive the earls of Gowrie, Angus, and Marre, who attended him, he took up his lodgings in an old inn, which was quite open and defenceleſs. But having expreſſed a deſire to ſee the caſtle of St Andrew’s, he was admitted into it; and colonel Stuart, who commanded the caſtle, after admitting a few of his retinue, ordered the gates to be ſhut. The earls of Argyle, Mariſchal, Montroſe, and Rothes, who were in concert with the king, haſtened to make him an offer of their ſwords. The oppoſite faction, being unprepared for hoſtilities, were filled with conſternation. Of all the conſpirators, the earl of Gowrie alone was admitted into the king’s preſence, by the favour of colonel Stuart, and received his pardon. The earls of March, Argyle, Gowrie, Mariſchal, and Rothes, were appointed to be a council lor aſſiſting the king in the management of his affairs; and ſoon after this James ſet out for Edinburgh. The king no ſooner found himſelf at liberty, than, by the advice of his privy council, he iſſued a proclamation of mercy to the conſpirators; but they, flattering themſelves with the hopes <hi rend="italic">of</hi> ſupport from Elizabeth, obſtinately refuſed to accept of his pardon. In conſequence of this, they were denounced rebels. Elizabeth failed not to give them underhand all the encouragement ſhe could, and the clergy uttered the moſt ſeditious diſcourſes againſt the king and government; and while they railed againſt Popery, they themſelves maintained openly the very characteriſtic and dinſtinguiſhing mark of Popery, namely, that the clerical was entirely independent of the civil power.</p><p>At laſt the rebels broke forth into open hoſtilſties; but by the vigilance of Arran, the earl of Gowrie, who had again begun his treaſonable practices, was committed to cuſtody; while the reſt, unable to oppoſe the Ring, who appeared againſt them with a formidable army, were obliged to fly into England, where Elizabeth, with her uſual treachery, protected them.</p><p>The earl of Gowrie ſuffered as a traitor; but the ſeverity exerciſed againſt him did not intimidate the clergy. They ſtill continued their rebellious practices, until the king being informed that they were engaged in a correſpondence with ſome of the fugitive lords, citations were given to their leaders to appear before the privy-council. The clergymen, not daring to appear, fled to England; and on the 20th of May 1584, the king ſummoned a convention of the eſtates, on purpoſe to humble the pride of the church in an effectual manner. In this aſſembly the raid of Ruthven was declared to be rebellion, according to a declaration which had formerly been made by the king. And, as it had grown into a cuſtom with the promoters of ſedition and the enemies of order, to decline the judgment of the king and the council, when called before them to anſwer for rebellious or contumelious ſpeeches, uttered from the pulpit or in public places, an ordination was made, aſſerting that they had complete powers to judge concerning perſons of every degree and function; and declaring, that every act of oppoſition to their juriſdiction ſhould be accounted to be treaſon. It was enacted, that the authority of the parliament, as conſtituted by the free votes of the three eſtates, was full and ſupreme; and that every attempt to diminiſh, alter, or infringe, its power, dignity, and juriſdiction, ſhould be held and puniſhed as treaſon. All juriſdictions and judgments, all aſſemblies and conventions, not approved of by the king and the three eſtates, were condemned as unlawful, and prohibited. It was ordained, that the king might appoint commiſſioners, with powers to examine into the delinquencies of clergymen, and, if proper, to deprive them of their benefices. It was commanded, that clergymen ſhould not for the future be admitted to the dignity of lords of the ſeſſion, or to the adminiſtration of any judicature civil or criminal. An ordination was made, which ſubjected to capital puniſhment all perſons who ſhould inquire into the affairs of ſtate with a malicious curioſity, or who ſhould utter falſe and ſlanderous ſpeeches in fermons, declamations, or familiar diſcourſe, to the reproach and contempt of the king, his parents, and progenitors. It was ordered that a guard, conſiſting of 40 gentlemen, with a yearly allowance to each of 2001. ſhould continually attend upon the king. This parliament, which was full of zeal for the crown, did not overlook the hiſtory of Buchanan, which about this time was exciting a very general attention. It commanded, that all perſons who were poſſeſſed of copies of his chronicle, and of his treatiſe on the Scottiſh government, ſhould ſurrender them within 40 days, under the penalty of 200 l. in order that they might be purged of the offenſive and extraordinary matters they contained. This ſtroke of tyranny was furious and ineffectual. Foreign nations, as well as his own countrymen, were filled with the higheſt admiration of the genius of Buchanan. It was not permitted that his writings ſhould ſuffer mutilation; they were multiplied in every quarter; and the ſeverity exerciſed againſt them only ſerved the more to excite curioſity, and to diffuſe his reputation.</p><p>While the parliamentary acts, which ſtruck againſt the importance of the church, were in agitation, the miniſters deputed Mr David Lindſay to ſolicit the king that no ſtatutes ſhould paſs which affected the eccleſiaſtical eſtabliſhment, without the conſultation of the general aſſembly. But the earl of Arran having intelligence of this commiſſion, defeated it, by committing Mr Lindſay to priſon as a ſpy for the diſcontented nobles.
