ment mordus en leur faisant la petite guerre que l’enfance livre à tout ce qui fuit, nous pouvons affirmer que leur dent ne produit aucun mauvais effet après la douleur du moment. Il suffit d’avoir vu un seul grand lézard vert, pour s’étonner que Linné ait pu confondre cette espèce avec le lézard gris.”@@1
It has been observed by the prince of Musignano (C. L. Bonaparte), that the Linnæan term
agilis
has been applied by the naturalists of different countries to that species of lizard which was most common or best known in their own. In this way several distinct kinds have been described under one name, and regarded as identical. The true
L. agilis of
Linn, is a northern species, which becomes rare in Italy, but is sufficiently common in France, and extends into Denmark and Sweden. Its history as a British reptile has been clearly illustrated only within a recent period by Mr Jenyns and others ; for the so-called
L. agilis
of the generality of British authors ought not to be so named.@@2 The actual species varies as usual in colour and markings ; but the most common hue of the upper parts is sandy-brown, with obscure longitudinal fasciæ of a darker brown, and a lateral series of black rounded spots, each marked with a yellowish-white dot or line in the centre. “ It is more timid,” says Mr Bell, “ and far less easily rendered familiar, than the beautiful green lizard
(L. viridis)
of Guernsey and the south of Europe. This latter species may be readily tamed, and taught to come to the hand for its food, and to drink from the hollow of the palm of any one to whom it is accustomed. It will lie coiled up between the two hands, enjoying the warmth, and not offering to escape. But it is very different from the present species, which appears not to be susceptible of any such attachment. It will indeed attempt to bite any one who handles it, which 1 have never known to occur with
L

viridis.
When in confinement it ceases to feed, conceals itself with extreme timidity when approached, and ultimately pines and dies.” Mr Bell has bestowed the English name of sand-lizard on this
L. agilis.
Our only other British species is the common viviparous lizard
(L. vivipara,
Jacquin,
Zootoca vivipara,
Bell@@3 ) confounded with the true
L. agilis
by many authors. “ This agile and pretty little creature,” Mr Bell observes, “ is the common inhabitant of almost all our heaths and banks in most of the districts of England, and extending even into Scotland ; it is also one of the few reptiles found in Ireland. On the continent its range does not appear to be very extensive ; it is not found in Italy, nor, I believe, in
France, and is very probably confined in a great measure to our own latitude. Its movements are beautifully gracile as well as rapid ; it comes out of its hiding-place during the warm parts of the day, from the early spring till autumn has far advanced, basking in the sun, and turning its head with a sudden motion the instant that an insect comes within its view ; and, darting like lightning upon its prey, it seizes it with its little sharp teeth, and speedily swallows it.” This species also varies greatly in its external aspect. The prevailing ground colour of the upper parts is greenish brown, with a dark brown dorsal line often interrupted ; a broad fascia extends parallel with this on each side, commencing behind the eyes, and extending to a greater or less distance down the tail ; and between these and the former are often one or more rows of black dots, and similar ones occur in many individuals in the broad lateral fascia. The under side of tlle body and base of the tail are orange, spotted with black in the male ; in the female grayish brown without spots. In reference to Mr Bell’s excellent account of this reptile, we take leave to add, that although it is no doubt entitled to the character of an ovo-viviparous species, the young are not always born at once from the body of the mother, that is, already freed from the encumbrance of the egg. We have several times kept gravid females in our possession, and on two occasions the membranous eggs were deposited unbroken, and the young lay within them for from two hours till a day and a half before they made their appearance. Their movements, however, were visible through the walls of their prison from the moment they were laid.
The more limited genus Algyra of Cuvier has the tongue, teeth, and pores of the lizards ; but the scales on the back and tail are ridged, those on the abdomen smooth and imbricated, and the collar is wanting. In the genus Tachydromus, Daudin, the scales on the back, and those beneath the tail and abdomen, are square and ridged ; the collar on the neck is absent, as well as the pores on the thighs, but on either side of the anal aperture there is a vesicle opening by a pore. The body and tail are both much elongated. The species run with great swiftness. See Plate CCCCXXXL fig. 3.

Laccrtay
that the palate is toothless, while it is armed in that last named.
@@@4 The great family of the

iβ divided by MM. Duméril and Bibron into forty-six genera, containing 146 species, the detailed descriptions of which occupy about 560 closely-printed pages in the work of those authors. (See
Erpétologie Générale,
tom. iv.). We regret that our restricted limits debar us from following their extended system, but we shall here present a tabular view of the genera and amount of species, partitioned in accordance with their geographical distribution.
