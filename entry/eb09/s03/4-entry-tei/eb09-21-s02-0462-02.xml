C. Baur and of the <hi rend="italic">dei minores</hi> of the Tübingen school. He was born at Michel-bach in Würtemberg on 10th February 1819, the son of a country clergyman, and entered the university of Tübingen· in 1836 as a student of theology, though with a predominant liking for classical philology. Under Baur’s influence he devoted himself to the study of ecclesiastical history, and his first work was <hi rend="italic">Der Montanismus u. die christliche Kirche des 2ten Jahrhunderts</hi> (1841), in which he was the first to point out that Montanism was much more than an isolated outbreak of eccentric fanaticism in the early church, though he introduced fresh misconceptions by connecting it with Ebionitism as he conceived the latter. This work, with other essays, brought Schwegler into conflict with the authorities of the church, in consequence of which he gave up theology as his professional study and chose that of philosophy. In 1843 he commenced in the Tübingen university the career of a teacher <hi rend="italic">(privat-docent)</hi> of philosophy and classical philology, and in 1848 was made extraordinary professor of the latter subject and soon after ordinary professor of history. His death took place on 5th January 1857.</p><p>His principal theological work was <hi rend="italic">Das nachapostolische Zeitalter</hi> (2 vols., 1846). It was this hook which first put before the world, with Schwegler’s characteristic boldness and clearness, the results of the critical labours of the earlier Tübingen school in relation to the first development of Christianity. Carl Schwarz says of it, “ This work—full though it was of youthful exaggerations and provocations, partisan as it was in its line of argument, untrue and abstract as its contrast of Paulinism and Petrinism was, and arbitrary as was its use of those party names—produced nevertheless by its masterly literary form (which reminds us of Strauss), and by its easy handling and presentation of all the important data, a powerful impression, and, although in many points of detail it is out of date, it may still be regarded as one of the ‘ standard works ’ of the school.” Schwegler published also an edition of the <hi rend="italic">Clementine Homilies</hi> (1847), and of Eusebius’s <hi rend="italic">Ecclesiastical History</hi> (1852). In the department of philosophy we have an edition of the <hi rend="italic">Metaphysics</hi> of Aristotle, with a translation and commentary (4 vols., 1847-48), the well-known sketch of the <hi rend="italic">History of Philosophy</hi> (1848), and a posthumous <hi rend="italic">Geschichte der Gricch. Philosophie</hi> (1859). In history he commenced a <hi rend="italic">Römische Geschichte</hi> (vols. i.-iii., 1853-58, 2d ed., 1869), which he brought down only to the laws of Licinius.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
