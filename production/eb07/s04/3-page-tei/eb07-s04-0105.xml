He gave also, after the example of Huygens, constructions for finding straight lines nearly equal to arches of a circle, and of which the degree of accuracy was greater. For example, he found that if A be put for the chord of an arch of a circle, and B for twice the chord of half the arch, and C be taken such that A+B : B : : B : C, then the arch itself is nearly equal to</p><p>—∆<hi rend="subscript">j</hi> but <hi rend="subscript">a</hi> little less, the error in the case of a 15</p><p>complete semicircle being less than its <hi rend="subscript">j</hi>j&gt;<hi rend="subscript">δβ</hi> part; and when the arch does not exceed 120°, it is less than its <hi rend="superscript">1</hi>/<hi rend="subscript">400000</hi> part ; and finally, for a quadrant the error is not greater than its <hi rend="superscript">1</hi>/<hi rend="subscript">300000</hi> part. And farther, that if D be such that A : B : :</p><p>„ <hi rend="subscript">v	v</hi> .	,	,	12C + 4B—D ,</p><p>B : D, then the arch is nearly equal to	⅛,	, but</p><p>J 5</p><p>a little greater, the error in the semicircle being less than its <hi rend="superscript">1</hi>/<hi rend="subscript">1000</hi> part, and in a quadrant less than its <hi rend="superscript">1</hi>/<hi rend="subscript">60000</hi> part.</p><p>Dr. Wallis gave, in his <hi rend="italic">Arithmetica Infinitorum,</hi> a singular expression for the ratio of the circle to the square of its diameter. He found that the former was to the latter as 1 to the product</p><p><hi rend="underline">3×3×5×5×7×7×9×9</hi>× 1<hi rend="underline">1 ×I1, &amp;</hi>c. 2×4×4×6×6×8×8×10×10×12</p><p>the fractions <hi rend="superscript">5</hi>/<hi rend="subscript">2</hi>, <hi rend="superscript">5</hi>/<hi rend="subscript">4</hi>, <hi rend="superscript">5</hi>/<hi rend="subscript">4</hi>, <hi rend="superscript">5</hi>/<hi rend="subscript">6</hi>, &amp;c., being supposed infinite in number. The products being supposed continued to infinity, we have the ratio exactly ; but if we stop at any finite number of terms, as must necessarily be the case in its application, the result will be alternately too great and too small, according as we take an odd or an even number of terms of the numerator and denominator.</p><p>An expression of another kind for the ratio of the circle to the square of the diameter was found by Lord Brounker. He showed that the circle being unity, the square of the diameter is expressed by the continued fraction 1</p><p>H	9</p><p><hi rend="italic">2+	</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">2+∞	</hi></p><p>2+l?_</p><p>2+,&amp;c</p><p>which is supposed to go on to infinity, the numerators 1, 9, 25, 49, <hi rend="italic">Sic.,</hi> being the squares of the odd numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, &amp;c. By taking two, three, four, &amp;c., terms of this fraction, we shall have a scries of approximate values, which are alternately greater and less than its accurate value.</p><p>Such were the chief discoveries relating to the quadrature of the circle made before the time of Newton ; many others, however, were quickly added by that truly great</p><p>man, as well as by his contemporaries. In particular, James Gregory found, that <hi rend="italic">t</hi> being put for the tangent, the arch is expressed by the very simple series</p><p><hi rend="italic">t</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">3</hi><hi rend="italic"> t</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">i</hi><hi rend="italic"> f . t</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">i</hi></p><p><hi rend="superscript">t</hi>—3^^^ 5—7" + 9— &amp;<hi rend="superscript">c</hi></p><p>By supposing that <hi rend="italic">t</hi>=1, in which case the arch is one eighth of the circumference, we have the corresponding arch expressed by the series</p><p><hi rend="superscript smallcaps">4</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">&lt;⅛M+⅛+*</hi><hi rend="superscript smallcaps">c</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">∙&gt;</hi></p><p>which was also given by Leibnitz as a quadrature of the circle in the <hi rend="italic">Acta Eruditorum</hi> in the year 1682, but was dis covered by him 1673. Gregory had however found the series under its general form several years before. This series is altogether inapplicable in its present form, on ac count of the slowness of its convergency ; for Newton has observed, that to exhibit its value exact to twenty places of figures, there would be occasion for no less than five thou sand millions of its terms, to compute which would take up above a thousand years.</p><p>The slowness of the convergency has arisen from our supposing <hi rend="italic">t</hi>=1. If we had supposed <hi rend="italic">t</hi> greater than 1, then the series would not have converged at all, but on the contrary diverged. But by giving to <hi rend="italic">t</hi> a value less than 1, then the rate of convergency will be increased, and that so much the more, as <hi rend="italic">t</hi> is smaller.</p><p>If we suppose the arch of which <hi rend="italic">t</hi> is the tangent to be 30°, then <hi rend="italic">t</hi> will be √<hi rend="superscript">1</hi>/<hi rend="subscript">3</hi>=<hi rend="superscript">1</hi>/<hi rend="subscript">3</hi>√3, and therefore half the circumference to radius unity, or the circumference to the diameter unity, will be</p><p>*∕<hi rend="superscript">12</hi>(<hi rend="superscript">1</hi>X3 <hi rend="superscript">+</hi>53<hi rend="superscript">3</hi>~73<hi rend="superscript">s +</hi> 9∑∙<hi rend="superscript">&amp;C</hi>')·</p><p>Mr. Machin, enticed by the easiness of the process, was induced, about the beginning of the last century, to continue the approximation as far as 100 places of figures, thus finding the diameter to be to the circumference as 1 to 3.14159,26535,89793,23846,26433,83279,50288,41971,69 399,37510,58209,74944,59230,78164,06286,20899,86280, 34825,34211,70680. After him, De Lagny continued it as far as 128 figures. But he has also been outdone; for in Radcliffe’s library at Oxford, there is a manuscript in which it is carried as far as 150 figures !</p><p>Although this last series, which was first proposed by Dr. Halley, gives the ratio of the diameter to the circumference with wonderful facility when compared with the operose method employed by Van Ceulen, yet others have been since found which accomplish it with still greater ease.</p><p>We have given such a method in our treatise on <hi rend="smallcaps">Algebra,</hi> (see article 272.) In the same treatise, (article 273), we have given a very elementary method, which may be understood by the mere elements of geometry.
