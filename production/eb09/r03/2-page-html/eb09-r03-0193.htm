<p><span class="font2">educational institutions comprise an academy of art and technical science, a naval school, an industrial school, a&nbsp;deaf and dumb asylum, &lt;fcc. In the Groote Markt (to&nbsp;the south of the Hoog Straat) stands the bronze statue of&nbsp;Erasmus (Gerrit Gerrits), erected by his fellow-citizens in&nbsp;1662 ; and his birth-house, now a tavern in Wijde Kerk-straat, is distinguished by a Latin inscription. The&nbsp;statue by Grefs of Gijsbert Karel van Hogendorp (1762-1834), a great Dutch statesman, gives his name to the&nbsp;Hogeudorpsplein, formerly Boymansplein, behind the&nbsp;museum ; in the “ Park,” which extends west along the&nbsp;bank of the Maas, is a marble statue by Strackée of Hendrik Tollens, tho Dutch poet ; and the Nieuwmarkt is&nbsp;adorned with a fountain in memory of the jubilee (1863)&nbsp;of the restoration of Dutch independence (1813). Extensive works for supplying the town with filtered water were&nbsp;constructed between 1870 and 187δ, the water in the&nbsp;river and - canals being rendered unwholesome by the&nbsp;sewerage, the treatment of which naturally presents great&nbsp;difficulties in a city lying in great part below high-water&nbsp;level. The most important industrial establishment is&nbsp;that of the Netherlands Steamboat Company, who are shipowners, shipbuilders, and engineers ; there are also extensive sugar-refineries and a great variety of smaller factories&nbsp;for the production of lead, iron, and copper wares, white&nbsp;lead, varnishes, tobacco and cigars, beer and vinegar,&nbsp;chocolate and confectionery, Ac. Rotterdam is, however,&nbsp;not so much a manufacturing as a commercial city, and&nbsp;its commercial progress has been very striking since the&nbsp;middle of the century. While in 1846 it had only&nbsp;321,764 tons out of the total of 1,024,705 tons which&nbsp;then represented the export trade of the Netherlands, in&nbsp;1883 it had 1,940,026 tons out of a total of 3,953,009&nbsp;tons. In 1850 it had only 27<sup>,</sup>9 per cent, of the outgoing&nbsp;vessels, and 35<sup>,</sup>77 per cent, of the tonnage; by 1870&nbsp;it had 35<sup>,</sup>60 per cent, of the vessels and 50<sup>-</sup>37 of the&nbsp;tonnage, and by 1883 43<sup>-</sup>75 per cent, of the vessels,&nbsp;and 49Ό8 of the tonnage. Rotterdam has thus become&nbsp;what Amsterdam formerly was—the principal port in&nbsp;the country. For steamers it is now, since the opening&nbsp;of the new waterway through the Hoek van Holland in&nbsp;1872, only two hours distant from the sea, and the channel&nbsp;is deep enough for vessels drawing 22 feet of water.@@<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>From 4471 vessels with a register tonnage of 1,688,700&nbsp;tons in 1873, the shipping clearing from the Netherlands&nbsp;by the new waterway had increased by 1884 to 8177&nbsp;vessels with register tonnage of 4,382,100 tons. Upwards of 18,000 emigrants left Europe by Rotterdam in&nbsp;1881. Besides its maritime trade Rotterdam commands&nbsp;a most extensive river traffic, not only with the towns&nbsp;of the Netherlands, but with those of Belgium and Germany. With Germany alone its Rhine traffic amounted&nbsp;in 1883 to 1,706,587 tons, against 2,021,644 for all the&nbsp;other ports of the Netherlands. On January 1, 1885,&nbsp;Rotterdam owned 43 sailing vessels and 50 steam-ships&nbsp;with </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">a uni</span><span class="font2">ted aggregate burden of 99,018 tons. Owing</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@1</sup> Previously the only direct way to the sea was by the Brielle (Brill) Channel, where in 1856 the fairway had gradually diminished&nbsp;in depth to δ feet at low water and 11 or 12 feet at high water. In&nbsp;1866 the works for the new waterway were commenced, and by&nbsp;November 1868 the canal from the Scheur (or northern arm of the&nbsp;Maas) across the Hoek had been dug. The seaward piers were completed to tho originally proposed length of (together) 2800 metres,&nbsp;but in 1871 they were prolonged to a total of 4300 metres, thus&nbsp;jutting out into the sea for more than a mile. Contrary to expectations the scour was not strong enough to widen the fairway; and&nbsp;works for this purpose were commenced in 1877, and at a later period&nbsp;the width of 900 metres between the piers was reduced to 700 metres&nbsp;by constructing an inner pier north of the south pier. The whole&nbsp;work has cost upwards of 23,000,000 guilders (£1,750,000)—15⅛&nbsp;millions expended up to 1879, and 7</span><span class="font0">∣</span><span class="font1"> between 1881 and 1884. With&nbsp;the exception of a contribution of not more than 3,000,000 from the&nbsp;city of Rotterdam, the entire sum has been paid by the state.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2">to the great increase of navigation and commerce tho berthing accommodation of the port frequently proves too&nbsp;small, though by the works at Fijenoord the length of tho&nbsp;quays has of late years been extended by about 8000&nbsp;metres. This island, two-thirds of which was purchased&nbsp;by tho town in 1591 and the remaining third in 1658,&nbsp;was dyked in 1795, and became the.seat of a building&nbsp;which has been in succession a pest-house, a military&nbsp;hospital, a naval college, and a private industrial school.&nbsp;The Netherlands Steamboat Company established its workshops there in 1825 ; and in 1873 the Rotterdam Trading&nbsp;Company began to construct the harbours and warehouses&nbsp;which have been purchased by the city. The population&nbsp;of the commune of Rotterdam, which did not much exceed&nbsp;20,000 in 1632, was 53,212 in 1796, 72,294 in 1830,&nbsp;88,812 in 1850, 105,858 in 1860, 132,054 in 1876, and&nbsp;148,102 in 1879-80. In 1870 the city contained&nbsp;111,256 inhabitants, the suburbs 3341, and the ships&nbsp;2478, and in 1884 the total, exclusive of the shipping,&nbsp;was 169,477.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rotterdam probably owes its origin to the ca6tles of Wena and Bulgei<sup>-</sup>Stein, of which the former was laid in ruins by tho Hoek&nbsp;party in 1426. In 1299 Count John I. granted the “good people&nbsp;of Rotterdam” the same rights as the burghers of Beverwijk, and&nbsp;freedom from toll in all his lands. In 1597 a sixth extension of the&nbsp;town’s area took place, and a seventh followed in 1609. Francis&nbsp;of Brederodeseized the place in 1488, but had to surrender it to tho&nbsp;emperor Maximilian in 1489. The Spaniards were in possession&nbsp;from April 9th to July 31st 1572, Iiavinggained entrance partly by&nbsp;treachery and partly by force (see Motley, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dutch Repτιblie,</span><span class="font1"> ii.). It&nbsp;was at a meeting of the states held at Rotterdam in June 1574&nbsp;that the relief of Leyden was determined on, though it was not&nbsp;till 1580 that the town obtained a vote in the assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ROUBAIX, a manufacturing town of France, the second in population in the department of Nord, lies to the&nbsp;north-east of Lille on the Ghent Railway and on the&nbsp;canal connecting the lower Deule with Scheldt by the&nbsp;Marq and Espierre. Several tramway lines traverse the&nbsp;town and connect it with various manufacturing centres in&nbsp;the neighbourhood. The population of Roubaix, which in&nbsp;1881 was 79,700 (the commune 91,757), is almost entirely&nbsp;manufacturing, and the trading firms of the town gave&nbsp;employment besides to an equally large number of hands&nbsp;in the vicinity. The weaving establishments number 300&nbsp;(250 for woollen or woollen and cotton goods), the leading&nbsp;products being fancy and figured stuffs for waistcoats,&nbsp;trousers, overcoats, and dresses, velvet, barége, Orleans,&nbsp;furniture coverings, and the like. The yearly production&nbsp;is estimated at &lt;£6,000,000, but the annual turnover exceeds &lt;£8,000,000, if all the industries of the place are&nbsp;taken into account. These include 70 wool-spinning mills,&nbsp;12 cotton mills, silk-works, wool-combing establishments,&nbsp;carpet manufactories, dye-houses, soap-works, machine-works, and foundries. Roubaix possesses several interesting churches, a library and art museum, a most interesting&nbsp;museum of local industries, communal schools of art and&nbsp;music, an industrial school for weaving, founded in 1857,&nbsp;a chamber of commerce dating from 1871, a chamber of&nbsp;arts and manufactures, a board of prud’hommes, and an&nbsp;agricultural and horticultural society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The prosperity of Roubaix has its origin in the first factory franchise, granted in 1469 by Charles the Bold to Peter of Roubaix, a descendant of the royal house of Britanny ; but the great&nbsp;development of the manufacturing industries of the town and tho&nbsp;growth of its population date from tho French Revolution. The&nbsp;population, which in 1804 was only 8700, had risen in 1861 to&nbsp;40,274, in 1S66 to 65,091, and in 1876 to 83,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ROUBILIAC, Louis </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">François</span><span class="font2"> (1695-1762), an able French sculptor. Born at Lyons in 1695, he became a&nbsp;pupil of Balthasar of Dresden and of N. Coustou. About&nbsp;the year 1720 he settled in London, and soon became the&nbsp;most popular sculptor of the time in England, quite superseding the established success of the Flemish Rysbraeck.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
