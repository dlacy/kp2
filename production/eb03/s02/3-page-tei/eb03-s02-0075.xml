By the letters of Throgmorton, the regent was advertiſed that the marriage of the queen of Scots with the duke of Norfolk was a certain and decided point; and he was counſelled to concur heartily and expeditiouſly in this tranſaction, that his conſent might not ſeem to have been extorted. Maitland of Lethington was recommended to him by this ſtateſman, as the perſon whom he ſhould chooſe to repreſent him in the Engliſh court, as he could negociate beſt the terms and mode of his ſecurity and of that of his party. In ſine, Throgmorton intreated him not to be troubled with any preciſe ſcruples or objections, for that his overthrow, if he reſiſted, would be inevitable; and, in the view of his ſervices and cordiality, he aſſured him, that no man’s friendſhip would be accepted with greater affection, and no man’s eſtimation be higher or more fortunate. The zeal of Throgmorton induced him alſo, upon this occaſion, to addreſs to Maitland a diſpatch, in which he was infinitely importunate to haſten his expedition to England, in the character to which he recommended him. He complimented him as the fitteſt perſon to open the match to the Engliſh queen, on the part of the regent and the Scottiſh nobility; and he repreſented the ſucceſs of the ſcheme to be infallible, as Elizabeth would never be ſo unwiſe as to put her own ſafety, the peace of her kingdom, and the preſervation of her people, in competition with the partial devices that might proceed from the vanity and the paſſions of any perſon whatſoever. He enumerated the names of the Engliſh nobility who had confederated to promote the marriage. He enlarged upon it as an expedient full of wiſdom, and as advantageous in the higheſt degree to religion and the ſtate. He pointed out the laſting and inſeparable connection of England and Scotland, as its happy and undoubted conſequence. For, if James VI. ſhould die, the ſceptres of the two kingdoms might devolve to an Engliſh prince; and if he ſhould attain to manhood, he might many the daughter of the duke of Norfolk, and unite, in his perfon, the two crowns.</p><p>Theſe weighty diſpatches employed fully the thoughts of the regent. The calls of juſtice and humanity were loud in the behalf of Mary; his engagements to Norfolk were preciſe and definitive; and the commiſſion of Elizabeth afforded him the command of the moſt important ſervices. But, on the other hand, the reſtoration of Mary, and her marriage, would put an end for ever to his greatneſs; and, amidſt all the ſtipulations which could be made for his protection, the enormity of his guilt was ſtill haunting him with ſuſpicions and terror. His ambition and his ſelfiſh ſenſibilities were an overmatch for his virtue. He practised with his partisans to throw obſtacles in the way of the treaty and the marriage; and, on the pretence of deliberating concerning the reſtoration of Mary, and on her divorce from Bothwel, a convention of the eſtates was ſummoned by him to aſſemble at Perth. To this aſſembly the letters of Elizabeth were recited; and her propoſitions were conſidered in their order. The full reſtoration of Mary to her dignity was accounted injurious to the authority of the king, and her aſſociation with her ſon in the government was judged improper</p><p>and dangerous; but it was thought that her deliverance from priſon, and her reduction to a private ſtation, were reaſonable expedients. No definitive decree, however, was pronounced. The letters of Mary were then communicated to this council, and gave riſe to vehement debates. She had written and ſubſcribed them in her character of queen of Scotland. This carriage was termed <hi rend="italic">inſolent</hi> and <hi rend="italic">imperious</hi> by the friends of the regent. They alſo held it unſafe to examine her re- queſts, till they ſhould be communicated to Elizabeth; and they inſinuated, that ſome inclement and partial device was concealed under the purpoſe of her divorce from the earl of Bothwel. The favourers of Mary endeavoured to apologize for the form of the letters, by throwing the blame upon her ſecretaries; and engaged, that while the commiſſaries, or judges, were proceeding in the buſineſs of the divorce, new diſpatches in the proper method ſhould be applied for and procured. They were heard with evident ſymptoms of diſpleaſure; and exclaimed, “that it was wonderful to them, that thoſe very perſons who lately had been ſo violent for the ſeparation of the queen and Bothwel ſhould now be ſo averſe ſrom it.” The partiſans of the regent replied, “that if the queen was ſo eagerly ſolicitous to procure the divorce, ſhe might apply to the king of Denmark to execute Bothwel as the murderer of her huſhand; and that then ſhe might marry the peſon who was moſt agreeable to her.” The paſſions of the two factions were inflamed to a moſt indecent extremity, and the convention broke up with ſtrong and unequivocal marks of hoſtility and anger.</p><p>Notwithſtandſhg the caution with which Mary and Norfolk carried on their intrigues, intimations of them had come to Elizabeth. Norfolk himſelf, by the advice of the earl of Pembroke, had ventured to diſcloſe his ſecret to Sir William Cecil, who affected to be friendly to him. The regent, in anſwer to her letters, tranſmitted to her the proceedings of the convention at Perth. The application of Mary for a divorce was a key to the ambitious hopes of the duke of Norfolk. She commanded Sir William Cecil to apply himſelf to diſcover the conſpiracy. This ſtateſman betrayed the confidence with which he had been entruſted; and Elizabeth, while the duke was attending her at Farnham, diſcovering a mixture of pleaſantry and paſſion, admoniſhed him to be careful on what pillow he repoſed his head. The earl of Leiceſter, alarmed by his fears, revealed to her at Titchfield the whole proceedings of the duke of Norfolk and his friends. Her fury was ungovernable; and at different times ſhe loaded Norfolk with the ſevereſt reproaches and contumely, for preſuming to think of a marriage with the queen of Scots without the fonction of her concurrence. Inſulted with her diſcourſe and her looks, abandoned by Leiceſter, and avoided by other nobles in whom he had confided, he felt his courage to forſake him. He left the court at Southampton without taking his leave, and went to London to the earl of Pembroke. New intimations of her diſpleaſure were announced to him, and he retired to his ſeat at Kinninghall in Norfolk. His friends preſſed him to take the field, and to commit his ſafety to the ſword; but having no inclination to involve his country in the miſeries of war, he rejected their advice; and addreſſing an apology to E-</p></body></text></TEI>
