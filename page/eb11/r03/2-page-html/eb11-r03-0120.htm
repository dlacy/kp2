<p><span class="font0">His works were published in 1693 by the Abbé Gallois, in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Recueil</span><span class="font0"> of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Mémoires de l’Académie des Sciences.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">ROBES (Fr. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">robe.</span><span class="font0"> Late Lat. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">roba, raupa,</span><span class="font0"> meaning (1) spoils, (2) robe, stuff, cf. Mod. Ital. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">roba,</span><span class="font0"> connected with a Teutonic&nbsp;root </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">raup, raub,</span><span class="font0"> German </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rauben</span><span class="font0"> and English </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rob),</span><span class="font0"> the name&nbsp;generally given to a class of official costume, especially as worn&nbsp;by certain persons or classes on occasions of particular solemnity.&nbsp;According to Du Cange, the word robe was earliest used, in&nbsp;the sense of a garment, of those given by popes and princes&nbsp;to the members of their household or their great officers.&nbsp;Thus Matthew Paris </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Chr on. Majora,</span><span class="font0"> Rolls Series, V. 38) tells&nbsp;how, in 1248, the pope gave to some Tatar envoys “ vestes&nbsp;pretiosissimas quas Robas vulgaritcr appellamus, de escarleto&nbsp;praeelecto, cum pellibus et furruris,” with which Du Cange&nbsp;compares the “ festiva indumenta ” given, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font0"> by King John&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">magnatum suorum multitudini</span><span class="font0"> at Christmas time (1214, Matt.&nbsp;Paris, Rolls Series, II. 520) and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">raubae papales Scutiferorum,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and the like, given by the popes to members of their households,&nbsp;after the fashion of a livery. It would, however, be perhaps&nbsp;going too far to assume that, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font0"> peers’ robes were originally&nbsp;the king’s livery, for there seems to be no proof that this was&nbsp;the case; but it is curious that in most early cases where robes&nbsp;are mentioned, if not of cloth of gold, &amp;c., they are of scarlet,&nbsp;furred. A robe is properly a long garment, and the term&nbsp;“ robes ” is now applied only in those cases where a long garment&nbsp;forms part of the official costume, though in ordinary usage&nbsp;it is taken to include all the other articles of dress proper to&nbsp;the costume in question. The term “ robes,” moreover, connotes a certain degree of dignity or honour in the wearer.&nbsp;We speak of the king’s robes of state, of peers’ robes, of the&nbsp;robes of the clergy, of academic robes, judicial robes, municipal&nbsp;or civic robes; we should not speak of the robes of a cathedral&nbsp;verger, though he too wears a long gown of ceremony, and it&nbsp;is even only by somewhat stretching the term “ robes ” that&nbsp;we can include under it the ordinary academical dress of the&nbsp;universities. In the case of the official costume of the clergy,&nbsp;too, a distinction must be drawn. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Vestimenta sacra</span><span class="font0"> are not&nbsp;spoken of as “ robes a priest is not “ robed ” but “ vested ”&nbsp;for Mass; yet the rochet and chimere of an English bishop,&nbsp;even in church, are more properly referred to as robes than as&nbsp;vestments, and while the cope he wears in church is a vestment&nbsp;rather than a robe, the scarlet cope which is part of his parliamentary full dress is a robe, not a vestment. For the sake of&nbsp;convenience the official, non-liturgical costume of the clergy&nbsp;Es dealt with under the general heading </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Vestments</span><span class="font0"> and the&nbsp;subsidiary articles </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(e.g. </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Cope).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The coronation robes of emperors and kings, representing as they do the sacerdotal significance of Christian kingship, are&nbsp;Sssentially vestments rather than robes (see </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Coronation).&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">Apart from these, however, are the royal robes of state; in&nbsp;the case of the king of England a crimson velvet surcoat and&nbsp;long mantle, fastened in front of the neck, ermine lined, with a&nbsp;deep cape or tippet of ermine.@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The subject of official robes is too vast for any attempt to be made to deal with it comprehensively here. All countries,&nbsp;East and West, which boast an ancient civilization have retained them in greater or less degree, and the tendency in&nbsp;modern times has been to multiply rather than to diminish&nbsp;their number. Even in republican France they survived the&nbsp;Revolution, at least in the universities and the law courts.&nbsp;But nowhere has custom been so conservative in this matter&nbsp;is in the United Kingdom, where in this as in other matters&nbsp;the wise Machiavellian principle has been followed of changing</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">the substance of institutions without altering their outward semblance. The present article, then, does not attempt to&nbsp;deal with any but British robes,@@<sup>2</sup> under the headings of&nbsp;(1) peers’ robes, (2) robes in the House of Commons, (3) robes&nbsp;of the Orders of Knighthood, (4) judicia! and forensic robes,&nbsp;(5) municipal and civic robes, (6) academic costume.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">PeerP Robes.—</span><span class="font0">As early as the end of the 14th century peers seem to have worn at their creation some kind of robe of honour;&nbsp;this we may conclude from the description of the investiture&nbsp;of the earI of Somerset in 1397 </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Rot. Part.</span><span class="font0"> iii. 343), which&nbsp;says: “ le dit Monsieur John fut amesnée devant le Roy en Parlement entre deux Contes, c’est assavoir Huntyngdon et Mares-chall, vestuz en un pane (Du Cange; </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">pannus=$. habitus vesti-mentum)</span><span class="font0"> come vesture de honor ”; while in accounts of various&nbsp;creations of about the same time </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Rot. Part.</span><span class="font0"> iii. 205, 206)&nbsp;are used the words “ advenienteque . . . prefato Duce honorifice&nbsp;. . . t ogato et orna to.” An early illustration of their use is to&nbsp;be found in an illumination on the foundation charter of King’s&nbsp;College, Cambridge (see fig. 1), which represents the peers as</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">early as 1446 wearing gowns, mantles and hoods of scarlet, furred with miniver, the mantle opening on the right shoulder&nbsp;and guarded with two, three or four bars of miniver, in the&nbsp;form of short stripes high up on the shoulder. The origin of&nbsp;these is as yet unknown, and it is not certain precisely when&nbsp;the peers’ velvet rohe of estate was first used. At the coronation of Henry VI. the king’s own parliament robe was of scarlet&nbsp;and miniver (Gregory’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chronicle,</span><span class="font0"> ed. Gairdner, Camden Soc.&nbsp;pp. 165-70), so the peers’ robes were certainly not yet of velvet;&nbsp;at that of Henry VII. (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rutland Papers,</span><span class="font0"> 1842; “ Device&nbsp;for the Coronation of Henry VII.”) the king had a robe of&nbsp;crimson velvet and ermine, but the “ lords temporall ” are&nbsp;only said to have been “ in their robes ”; at that of Henry VIII.&nbsp;(see Hall’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chronicle}</span><span class="font0"> the king in his progress through the city&nbsp;wore a crimson velvet robe furred with ermine, “ his knights&nbsp;and esquires for his body ” wore crimson velvet, and “ all the&nbsp;gentlemen,” &amp;c., scarlet, while we hear of the “ lords spiritual&nbsp;and temporal, and of their costly and rich apparel, of several&nbsp;devises and fashions,” and notably of the duke of Bucking -ham’s robe of gold and needlework (Stow’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Annals,</span><span class="font0"> p. 813),&nbsp;which would show that the velvet robe of estate was not yet&nbsp;worn at the king’s coronation. The duke of Richmond at his&nbsp;creation in 1525 (17 Henry VIII., see Brewer, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">State Papers,</span><span class="font0"> iv.&nbsp;639) is described as clad in robes of estate, and the description&nbsp;of the investiture says that “ the patent was read, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">robe,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">sword, cap and circlet put on,” and about this time references&nbsp;are found to the “ parliament robes ” of peers, implying that&nbsp;there were others.</span></p>
