<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">terpreting ’ in </span><span class="font0">111</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">s presence, and the budding intelligence of a third, ־who became the greatest Talmudist of his age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Rashi, though not the originator of all that he teaches in his commentary on the Talmud, had so digested the whole literature&nbsp;bearing on that stupendous work that his teaching, even when it&nbsp;appears to be imitative, is really creative. In his Biblical com-mentaries he has not, of course, grammatical and philological&nbsp;knowledge of the modern type, but he had a very fine sense for&nbsp;linguistic points, which was not equalled, much less surpassed, by&nbsp;the greatest rabbis who followed him. He gave satisfaction, if not&nbsp;to all, at least to the best of his time, and, as the great German&nbsp;poet says, “ he who has given satisfaction to the best of his time&nbsp;lives for all ages.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rashi’s Works.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">—A. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Bible Commentary</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> (פרוש).—Rashi commented on the whole of the Hebrew Bible except Job, chaps, xl. 21 to the end, and the books of Chronicles.@@<sup>1</sup> Kimhi’s is the only&nbsp;Rabbinical commentary which can be said to have successfully&nbsp;approached this great work in its influence on Jewish scholarship ;&nbsp;and on the Pentateuch Rashi had no rival. For centuries too his&nbsp;was the text-book in boys’ schools throughout the Jewish world—and&nbsp;in some countries it is so still, its depth and subtilty being com-bined with simplicity of exposition. Its currency is attested by&nbsp;more than a hundred supercommentaries, translations, extracts,&nbsp;and the like, of which there are about fifty in print. An eminent&nbsp;rabbi declares that Rashi may be substituted for the Targum “ in&nbsp;the reading of the weekly pericope ” (Reshal, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Yam shcl Shelomoh&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">on Kiddushin, ii. § 14). Rashi’s influence on Christian scholars has&nbsp;already been alluded to. N. de Lyra copied him so closely as to&nbsp;be called his “ape.”@@<sup>2</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Translations.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> —The whole commentary was rendered into Latin by </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Pellicanus </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(q.v</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">.), but never printed, and again by Breithaupt&nbsp;(3 vols. 4to, Gotha, 1710-14). This version includes the spurious&nbsp;commentary on Chronicles and is accompanied by notes. Of separate&nbsp;parts there are printed versions of Gen. i.-vi. (Scherzer, 1663), Gen.&nbsp;vi.-xi. (Abicht, 1705), Gen. xlix. (Loscani, 1710), Hosea (Mercier,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">1621) , Joel, Jonah (Leusden, 1656), Joel (Genebrard, 1563), Jonah,&nbsp;Zephaniali, Obadiah (Pontac, 1556), Obadiah (Crocius, 1673), Malachi&nbsp;(S. de Muis, 1618), Ps. xix. (Id., 1620), Proverbs (Giggieus, 1620),&nbsp;Canticles (Genebrard, 1570), Ruth (Carpzov, 1703), Esther (Aquinas,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">1622) . The Pentateuch was translated into German by L. Dukes&nbsp;(Prague, 1833-38, 8vo); Genesis w<sup>r</sup>as done by L. Haymann (Bonn,&nbsp;1833, 8vo). </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Editions,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> especially of the Pentateuch, are very numer-ous. Only some of the chief can here be named,—</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(a)</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> on the whole&nbsp;Bible, with the sacred text—Venice, 1545, 1595, 1607 (all three in&nbsp;4to) ; Cracow, 1610, 4to ; Basel, 1618, folio ; (</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">b</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">) Pentateuch with&nbsp;text (all sm. folio) —Bologna, 1482; Ixar, 1490; Lisbon and&nbsp;Naples, 1491 ; (c) Pentateuch without text—Reggio, 1475, folio&nbsp;(the first Hebrew book printed with date); </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">s. 1. ct a.,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> but before 1480,&nbsp;4to ; Soncino, 1487, folio. MSS. of Rashi on the whole Bible are&nbsp;very rare, and even those which are supposed to be such turn out,&nbsp;on examination, to be either incomplete or defective, or both. There&nbsp;lies a precious MS. in Leyden (1 Seal.) ; but it is a trifle defective&nbsp;in Exodus. St John’s College, Cambridge, possesses a still more&nbsp;ancient and precious MS. (A. 3; dated 1239) ; but it lacks the Penta-teuch and Ezra(-Nehemiah), and is defective in the end (though,&nbsp;it is true, only in Chronicles, which is not Rashi’s, as mentioned&nbsp;before). But MSS. of Rashi on the Pentateuch, both old and good,&nbsp;abound. There are few libraries in Europe that have not one or&nbsp;two of this commentary. It is to be hoped, therefore, that Dr A.&nbsp;Berliner, who has already edited critically Rashi on the Pentateuch&nbsp;(Berlin, 1866, 8vo), although not on the faith of a sufficient number&nbsp;of MSS., will soon issue a second and superior edition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">B. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Commentary on the Babylonian Talmud,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> @@<sup>3</sup>.קונטרס—Rashi&nbsp;had not been dead a hundred years when it was felt in the learned&nbsp;world that no such master in the Talmud had ever existed before&nbsp;him, and that without his aid and especially his corrections of the&nbsp;text (then only embodied in his commentary), the sea of the Baby-Ionian Talmud could not safely be sailed on. He became now the&nbsp;teacher even of the Jews in the East. He commented on the whole&nbsp;of the Talmud to which Gemara is attached (see </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Mishnah), </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">except&nbsp;on </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Nedarim</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> from leaf 22b to the end, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Nazir</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Tamid</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> from begin-ning to end, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Baba Bathra</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> from 29a to the end, and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Makkoth</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> from&nbsp;leaf 19b@@<sup>4</sup> to the end.

Ya’akob&nbsp;Nazir ; its relation to the author of the MS. commentary on Job (Camb.&nbsp;Univ. Lib., Dd. 8. 53) has still to be worked out. The commentary&nbsp;on Chronicles in which Rashi is three times cited by name (2 Chron.&nbsp;iii. 15, xxii. 11, and xxiii. 14) is the work of a German rabbi residing&nbsp;in Provence.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">massekhtoth death surprised him. Rashi on the Talmud has never been printed apart from the text, and so the first complete edition&nbsp;is that contained in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">editio princeps</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> of the Babylonian Talmud&nbsp;(Venice, 1520-23, folio). Portions had come out before with parts&nbsp;of the Talmud (Soncino, 1483, and elsewhere later). There are MSS.&nbsp;containing Rashi on isolated Talmudic treatises in various libraries :&nbsp;the Cambridge University Library and British Museum have six&nbsp;each, the Bodleian twelve, the Paris National Library seven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Religious Decisions</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> (פסקים) given by Rashi are to be found&nbsp;in various works, principally in the so-called </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Siddur</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> (i. and ii.) and&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Happardes</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> (Warsaw, 1870, folio)—called </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Happardes Haggadol</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> to&nbsp;distinguish it from the abridgment by R. Shemuel of Bamberg&nbsp;(13th century) called </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Likjcute Happardes</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> (Venice, 1519, 4to) — a&nbsp;work of which Rashi himself seems to have laid the foundation,&nbsp;though other literature on other subjects is now mixed up with it.&nbsp;Of the same nature are אסור והתר (kindly lent to the writer by&nbsp;Dr Merzbacher of Munich) and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Hoorah</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> (only in part printed).&nbsp;Various halakhoth, &amp;c., are also to be found in various mahzorim&nbsp;(</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> the Cambridge MS.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Poems</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> (פיוטים).—Rashi was no poet by profession and much&nbsp;less by genius; but he had a tenderly feeling heart, and saw the&nbsp;horrors of the first crusade; and he wrote </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Selihoth</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> (propitiatory&nbsp;and penitential prayers), which are by no means without their&nbsp;value. One is embodied in the additional service of the day of&nbsp;atonement and begins “ </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Tannoth Saroth</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> ” (Reshal’s </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Responsa,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> §&nbsp;xxix.), and several more, which form the acrostic Shelomoh bar&nbsp;Yishak, are found in the collection of the Selihoth of the Ash-kenazic rite. It is not improbable also that the Aramaic </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Reshuth&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">iv. to the Haphtarah in Targum (introduction to the prophetic&nbsp;portion as given in Yonathan b. 'Uzz'iel’s Aramaic paraphrase),&nbsp;which is to be found in the Reuchlinian Codex (De Lagarde,&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Prophetae chaldaice,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> Leipsic, 1872, 8vo, leaf 492), is his. It is&nbsp;much his style, and the acrostic is Shelomoh (and not שמעק). It&nbsp;is also very probable that </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Reshuth</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> v. is his. If so, he must have&nbsp;composed it when very young, as several expressions in it testify.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Le'azim</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> (לעזים).—In his commentaries Rashi, like R. Gersliom&nbsp;before him and others after him, often introduces French words&nbsp;(chiefly verbs and nouns) to give precision to his explanations.&nbsp;Of these </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Le'azim</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> there are certainly more than 3000, and they are&nbsp;most valuable to the student of old French. Unfortunately copyists,&nbsp;notably in Italy, and printers subsequently, have often substituted&nbsp;their own vernacular for the original French ; there are now even&nbsp;Russian words to be found in Rashi. Four hundred years ago&nbsp;explanations of some of these </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Le'azim</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> and of those of Kimhi were&nbsp;offered by the author of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Makre Dardeke</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> (Naples, 1488). Other&nbsp;contributions have followed intermittingly down to the present&nbsp;time (Brothers Bondi in </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Or Esther,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> Dessau, 1812; Dormitzer and&nbsp;Landau in </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Marpe Lashon,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> Odessa, 1865, 12mo). The labours of M.&nbsp;Arsene Darmsteter promise to be exhaustive, and are based on ex-tensive collations, see </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Romania,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> April 1872, p. 146 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">sq.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There is no satisfactory life of Rashi; most recent accounts rest on a </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font2"> by </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Zunz</span><span class="font2"> (1S22), which has not been reprinted in his collected works. (S. M. S.-S.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">RASHT (also Rascht, Rescht, Rashd, and Resht), a town in northern Persia, situated in 37° 18' N. lat. and&nbsp;49° 37' E. long., capital of the richly wooded maritime pro-vince of Gilan, contains from 15,000 to 20,000 inhabitants.&nbsp;Eastwick, who was there in 1861, accepts the former&nbsp;estimate, but states that the place was four times as popu-lous before the plague of 1831. The distance from Enzelli,&nbsp;on the southern shores of the Caspian, the actual port of dis-embarkation for passengers and goods from Russia, is about&nbsp;16 miles, of which 12 (to Pari Bazaar) are accomplished&nbsp;in an open boat, the last part by river, but for the most&nbsp;part over a widespread brackish lake or lagoon (</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">murdáb</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">),&nbsp;abounding in wild fowl, surrounded by reeds, and separated&nbsp;from the sea by a narrow belt of sand. From Pari Bazaar&nbsp;to Rasht the road, piercing through forest and swamp,&nbsp;had for many long years been memorable only for its&nbsp;puddles and pools, its ruts and ruggedness, but it has more&nbsp;recently undergone great improvement. As for the town&nbsp;itself, the tiled houses in the streets, and the lanes, lined&nbsp;with hedge and cottage, in the environs, impart a cheer-fulness to the locality little in unison with the sickly and&nbsp;fever-stricken faces and forms of the inhabitants. Yet the&nbsp;beauty and hazel eyes of the children, with their “ true&nbsp;English pink and white complexions” noticed by Eastwick,&nbsp;are not significant of inherited enervation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Rasht is the residence of a Russian and an English</span></p>
