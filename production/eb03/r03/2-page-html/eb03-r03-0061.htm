<p><span class="font0">and almoſt all the reſt of his life attached himſelf to ſome of the great lords, He attended marſhal Tallard&nbsp;into England, in quality of ſecretary, and here contracted a ſriendſhip with St Evremond. At his return&nbsp;to Paris, he was admitted into the politeſt company,&nbsp;lived among the courtiers, and ſeemed perfectly ſatisſied with his ſituation ; when, in 1708, he was proſe-cuted for being the author of ſome couplets, in which&nbsp;the characters of ſeveral perſons of wit and merit were&nbsp;blackened by the moſt atrocious calumnies. This pro-ſecution made much noife ; and Rouſſeau was baniſhed&nbsp;in 1712 out of the kingdom, to which he was never&nbsp;more to return, by a decree of the parliament of Paris,&nbsp;However, he always ſteadily denied, and even on his&nbsp;death-bed, his being the author of theſe couplets.—&nbsp;From the date of this ſentence he lived in foreign countries, where he found illuſtrious protectors. The count&nbsp;de Luc, ambaſſador of France, in Swiſſerland, took&nbsp;him into his family, and ſtudied to render his life agreeable. He took him with him to the treaty of Baden in</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">1714, where he was one of the plenipotentiaries, and preſented him to prince Eugene, who entertaining a&nbsp;particular eſteem'for him, took him to Vienna, and introduced him to the emperor’s court. Rouſſeau lived&nbsp;about three years with prince Eugene ; but having loſt&nbsp;his favour by ſatiriſing one of his miltreſſes, he retired to&nbsp;Bruſſels, where he afterwards uſually reſided, and where&nbsp;he met with much attention and much generoſity, as we&nbsp;ſhall ſoon mention.— It was here that his diſputes with&nbsp;Voltaireeommenced,with whom he had become acquainted at the college of Louis the Great, who then much&nbsp;admired his turn for poetry. At that time Voltaire aſ-ſiduouſly cultivated the acquaintance of Rouſſeau, and&nbsp;made him a preſent of all his works ; and Rouſſeau,&nbsp;flattered by his reſpect, announced him as a man who&nbsp;would one day be a glory to the age. The author of&nbsp;the Henriad continued to conſult him about his productions, and to laviſh on him the higheſt encomiums,&nbsp;while their friendſhip daily increaſed. When they again&nbsp;met at Bruſſels, however, they harboured the blackeſt&nbsp;malice againſt one another. The cauſe of this enmity,&nbsp;as Rouſſeau and his friends tell the ſtory, was a lecture&nbsp;which he had compoſed from his Epiſtie to Julia, new&nbsp;Urania. This piece frightened Voltaire, as it plainly&nbsp;diſcovered his rage againſt him. The young man, vexed at theſe calumnies, underſtood the whole as thrown&nbsp;out againſt him. This is what Rouſſeau aſſerts. But&nbsp;his adverſaries, and the friends of the poet whom he&nbsp;cried down, ſuſpected him, perhaps rather raſhly, of&nbsp;having employed ſarcaſms, becauſe he thought that his&nbsp;own reputation was in danger of being eclipſed by that&nbsp;of his rival. What is very ſingular, theſe two celebrated characters endeavoured each of them to prepoſſcſs&nbsp;the public with a bad opinion of the other, which they&nbsp;themſelves never entertained in reality, and to ſmother&nbsp;in their breaſt that eſteem for each other which, in de</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">fiance of all their exertions, ſtill held its place. Rouſſeau, from the period of this diſpute, always repre-fented Voltaire as a buffoon, as a writer poſſelfing neither taſte nor judgment, who owed all his ſucceſs to a particular mode which he purſued. As a poet he confi-dered him as inferior to Lucan, and little ſuperior to&nbsp;Pradon. Voltaire treated him ſtill worſe. Rouſſeau, according to him, was nothing better than a plagiariſt,&nbsp;who could make ſhiſt to rhime, but could not make&nbsp;any reflections ; that he had nothing but the talent of&nbsp;arranging words, and that he had even loſt that in foreign countries. He thus addreſſes him, in a piece little known :</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Aυffitδt le Dieu qui rrfinſpire T<sup>,</sup>arracha le luth et la lyre&nbsp;lpu’avoient cléjhonorés tes mains ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Tu n’es plus qu’un reptile immonde,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rebut du Pamojſe et du monde</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Enſeveli dans tes venins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In conſequence of the little eſteem in which Rouſſeau was held at Bruſſels, he could never forget Paris. The&nbsp;grand-prior of Vendôme, and the baron de Breteuil&gt;&nbsp;ſolicited the regent duke of Orleans to allow him t©&nbsp;return ; which favour was obtained. But our poet, before he would make uſe of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">lettres de rapel</span><span class="font0"> iſſued in&nbsp;his favour, demanded a review of his proceſs, which he&nbsp;wiſhed to be repealed, not as a matter of favour, but&nbsp;by a ſolemn judgment of court ; but his petition was&nbsp;refuſed. He then came over, in 1721, to England, where&nbsp;he printed </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">A Collection oſ his Works,</span><span class="font0"> in 2 vols ι 2mo,&nbsp;at London. This edition, publiſhed in 1723, brouglu&nbsp;him near 10,000 crowns, the wholeof which he placed in&nbsp;the hands of the Oſtend company. The affairs of this&nbsp;company, however, ſoon getting into contuſion, all&nbsp;thoſe who had any money in their hands loſt the whoſe&nbsp;of it, by wſhich unfortunate event Rouſſeau, when arrived at that age when he ſtood moſt in need of the&nbsp;comforts of fortune, had nothing to depend upon but&nbsp;the generoſity of ſome tnends. Boutet, public notary&nbsp;in Paris, was peculiarly generous and attentive to him.&nbsp;He found a ſtill greater aſylum in the Duke d’Arem-berg, whoſe table was open to him at all times ; who being obliged in 1733 to go into the army in Germany,&nbsp;ſettled on him a penſion of 1500 livres. But unfortunately he ſoon loſt his good opinion, having been-Jm-prudent enough to publiſh in a Journal (of which Voltaire accuſed him), that the duke d’Aremberg was the&nbsp;author of thoſe verſes for which he himſelf had been&nbsp;baniſhed France. He was therefore diſmiſſed from his&nbsp;table, and his pride would not allow him to accept of&nbsp;the penſion after this rupture. Bruſſels now became&nbsp;inſupportable to him ; and the count du Luc, and M.&nbsp;de Senozan, receiver-general of the church revenue, being informed of his difappointments,. invited him </span><span class="font1">to&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">come privately to Paris, in the hopes of procuring a&nbsp;diminution of the period of his baniſhment. Some&nbsp;time previous to this Rouſſeau had publiſhed two new&nbsp;letters ; one to P. Brumoi, on tragedy ; the other to&nbsp;Rollin, on hiſtory. It is laid, he expected from his&nbsp;letter to Brumoi to get the favour of all the Jeſuits ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">aud from the one to Rollin, the patronage of the Jan-ſeniſts. He had likewiſe written an Ode, in praiſe of Cardinal de Fleury, on Peace, which met with a favourable reception, although it was not equal to ſome&nbsp;of his former pieces. He imagined his return to Paris&nbsp;would be found no difficult matter. He attempted it,&nbsp;and found he could not obtain a paſs for a ſingle year.&nbsp;Some ſay, that Rouſſeau had irritated ſome perſons in&nbsp;power, by an allegory, called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Judgment of Pluto ;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">in which piece </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">he </span><span class="font0">deſeribes one of the principal judges,</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
