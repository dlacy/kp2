<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">It is just at tliis point that the Revival of Learning intervened to determine the course of the Renaissance. Medieval students possessed a considerable portion of the Latin ' classics, though Greek had become in the fullest sense of&nbsp;the phrase a dead language. Rut what they retained of&nbsp;ancient literature they could not comprehend in the right&nbsp;spirit. Between them and the text of poet or historian&nbsp;hung a veil of mysticism, a vapour of misapprehension.&nbsp;The odour of unsanctity clung around those relics of the&nbsp;pagan past. Men bred in the cloister and the lecture-room of the logicians, trained in scholastic disputations,&nbsp;versed in allegorical interpretations of the plainest words&nbsp;and most apparent facts, could not find the key which&nbsp;might unlock those stores of wisdom and of beauty.&nbsp;Petrarch first opened a new method in scholarship, and revealed what we denote as humanism. In his teaching lay&nbsp;the twofold discovery of man and of the world. For humanism, which was the vital element in the Revival of Learning,&nbsp;consists mainly of a just perception of the dignity of man&nbsp;as a rational, volitional, and sentient being, born upon this&nbsp;earth with a right to use it and enjoy it. Humanism&nbsp;implied the rejection of those visions of a future and&nbsp;imagined state of souls as the only absolute reality, which&nbsp;had fascinated the imagination of the Middle Ages. It&nbsp;involved a vivid recognition of the goodliness of man and&nbsp;nature, displayed in the great monuments of human power&nbsp;recovered from the past. It stimulated the curiosity of&nbsp;latent sensibilities, provoked fresh inquisition into the&nbsp;groundwork of existence, and strengthened man’s selfesteem by knowledge of what men had thought and felt&nbsp;and done in ages when Christianity was not. It roused a&nbsp;desire to reappropriate the whole abandoned provinces of&nbsp;mundane energy, and a hope to emulate antiquity in works&nbsp;of living loveliness and vigour. The Italians of the 14th&nbsp;century, more precocious than the other European races,&nbsp;were ripe for this emancipation of enslaved intelligence.&nbsp;In the classics they found the food which was required&nbsp;to nourish the new spirit; and a variety of circumstances, among which must be reckoned the pride of a&nbsp;nation boasting of its descent from the Populus Romanus,&nbsp;rendered them apt to fling aside the obstacles that had&nbsp;impeded the free action of the mind through many centuries. Petrarch not only set his countrymen upon the&nbsp;right method of studying the Latin classics, but he also&nbsp;divined the importance of recovering a knowledge of Greek&nbsp;literature. To this task Boccaccio addressed himself; and&nbsp;he was followed by numerous Italian enthusiasts, who&nbsp;visited Byzantium before its fall as the sacred city of a new&nbsp;revelation. The next step was to collect MSS., to hunt&nbsp;out, copy, and preserve the precious relics of the past.&nbsp;In this work of accumulation Guarino and Filelfo, Aurispa&nbsp;and Poggio, took the chief part, aided by the wealth of&nbsp;Italian patricians, merchant-princes, and despots, who were&nbsp;inspired by the sacred thirst for learning. Learning was&nbsp;then no mere pursuit of a special and recluse class. It was&nbsp;fashionable and it was passionate, pervading all society&nbsp;with the fervour of romance. For a generation nursed in&nbsp;decadent scholasticism and stereotyped theological formulae&nbsp;it was the fountain of renascent youth, beauty, and&nbsp;freedom, the shape in which the Helen of art and poetry&nbsp;appeared to the ravished eyes of mediaeval Faustus. It&nbsp;was the resurrection of the mightiest spirits of the past.&nbsp;“I go,” said Cyriac of Ancona, the indefatigable though&nbsp;uncritical explorer of antiquities, “I go to awake the&nbsp;dead ! ” This was the enthusiasm, this the vitalizing faith,&nbsp;which made the work of scholarship in the 15th century&nbsp;so highly strung and ardent. The men who followed it&nbsp;knew that they w<sup>r</sup>ere restoring humanity to its birthright&nbsp;after the expatriation of ten centuries. They were instinctively aware that the effort was for liberty of action,</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">thought, and conscience in the future. This conviction made young men leave their loves and pleasures, grave men&nbsp;quit their counting-houses, churchmen desert their missals,&nbsp;to crowd the lecture rooms of philologers and rhetoricians.&nbsp;When Greek had been acquired, !MSS. accumulated,&nbsp;libraries and museums formed, came the age of printers&nbsp;and expositors. Aldus Manutius in Italy, Froben in Basel,&nbsp;the Etiennes in Paris, committed to the press what the&nbsp;investigators had recovered. Nor were there wanting at&nbsp;the same time men who dedicated their powers to Hebrew&nbsp;and Oriental erudition, laying, together with the Grecians,&nbsp;a basis for those Biblical studies which advanced the&nbsp;Reformation. Meanwhile the languages of Greece and&nbsp;Rome had been so thoroughly appropriated that a final race&nbsp;of scholars, headed by Politian, Pontano, Valla, handled&nbsp;once again in verse and prose both antique dialects, and&nbsp;thrilled the ears of Europe with new-made pagan melodies.&nbsp;The church itself at this epoch lent its influence to the&nbsp;prevalent enthusiasm. Nicholas 'V. and Leo X., not to&nbsp;mention intervening popes who showed themselves tolerant&nbsp;of humanistic culture, were heroes of the classical revival.&nbsp;Scholarship became the surest path of advancement to&nbsp;ecclesiastical and political honours. Italy was one great&nbsp;school of the new learning at the moment when the German, French, and Spanish nations were invited to her&nbsp;feast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">It will be well to describe briefly, but in detail, what! this meeting of the modern with the ancient mind effected <sup>1&nbsp;</sup>over the whole field of intellectual interests. In doing !&nbsp;so, we must be careful to remember that the study of the&nbsp;classics did but give a special impulse to pent-up energies&nbsp;which were bound in one way or another to assert their&nbsp;independence. Without the Revival of Learning the direction of those forces would have been different; but that&nbsp;novel intuition into the nature of the world and man&nbsp;which constitutes what we describe as Renaissance must&nbsp;have emerged. As the facts, however, stand before us, it&nbsp;is impossible to dissociate the rejection of the other world&nbsp;as the sole reality, the joyous acceptance of this world as&nbsp;a place to live and act in, the conviction that “ the proper&nbsp;study of mankind is man,” from humanism. Humanism,&nbsp;as it actually appeared in Italy, was positive in its conception of the problems to be solved, pagan in its contempt for mediaeval mysticism, invigorated for sensuous&nbsp;enjoyment by contact with antiquity, yet holding in&nbsp;itself the germ of new religious aspirations, profounder&nbsp;science, and sterner probings of the mysteries of life than&nbsp;had been attempted even by the ancients. The operation&nbsp;of this humanistic spirit has now to be traced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">It is obvious that Italian literature owed little at the outset to the revival of learning. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Divine Comedy,<sup>1&nbsp;</sup></span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Canzoniere,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Decameron</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> were works of monumental art, deriving neither form nor inspiration imme-,&nbsp;diately from the classics, but applying the originality of&nbsp;Italian genius to matter drawn from previous mediaeval&nbsp;sources. Dante showed both in his epic poem and in his&nbsp;lyrics that he had not abandoned the sphere of contemporary thought. Allegory and theology, the vision and the&nbsp;symbol, still determine the form of masterpieces which for&nbsp;perfection of workmanship and for emancipated force of intellect rank among the highest products of the human mind.&nbsp;Yet they are not mediaeval in the same sense as the song&nbsp;of Roland or the Arthurian cycle. They proved that,&nbsp;though Italy came late into the realm of literature, her&nbsp;action was destined to be decisive and alterative by the&nbsp;introduction of a new spirit, a firmer and more positive&nbsp;grasp on life and art. These qualities she owed to her&nbsp;material prosperity, to her freedom from feudalism, to her&nbsp;secularized church, her commercial nobility, her political&nbsp;independence in a federation of small states.
