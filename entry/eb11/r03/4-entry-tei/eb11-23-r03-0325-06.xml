                <p><label>RIFLE</label> a firearm which may be shortly defined as a musket in which,
                    by grooves (cf. Ger. <hi rend="italic">riffeln,</hi> to groove) in the bore or
                    otherwise, the projectile is forced to rotate before leaving the barrel. This
                    rotatory motion, maintained during flight, equalizes any irregularities in the
                    form or weight of the bullet, and so lessens the tendency to depart from a
                    straight line, and also in a measure overcomes atmospheric resistance. Rifling
                    was invented about 1520, by Gaspard Koller or Kollncr, a gunmaker of Vienna,
                    according to some authorities; by August Kotter of Nuremberg, according to
                    others. It has been said</p>

                <p>that at first the grooves were made straight, with the object of admitting a
                    tight-fitting bullet and relieving the effects of fouling, and that the virtue
                    of spiral grooving was subsequently discovered by accident. But this theory is
                    unsupported. The earliest known rifle barrels have spiral grooving. The amount
                    of turn varied in old rifles from a half or three-quarters turn to one turn in
                    two to three feet. The form and depth of the grooving and the number of grooves
                    also greatly varied.</p>

                        >Arquebus, &amp;c.</hi> Rifles were at first used for amusement. There are,
                    however, instances of their occasional employment in war in the 17th and 18th
                    centuries. In 1631 the landgrave of Hesse had a troop of riflemen. Ten years
                    later Maximilian of Bavaria had several troops armed with rifled arquebuses.
                    Louis XIII. armed his bodyguard with rifles. Napoleon withdrew the rifle from
                    those of his troops to whom it had been issued during the wars of the Republic,
                    nor did the French make any considerable use of it again until 1830, when the
                    Chasseurs dOrleans were armed with it for the invasion of Algeria. The British
                    learnt the value of rifles during the American War of Independence, when the
                    government subsidized continental <hi rend="italic">Jägers</hi> armed with
                    rifles to oppose the American riflemen. After the war these corps disappeared,
                    and though they are now represented by the 60th (King’s Royal) Rifles, the
                    senior rifle corps in the British Army is the Rifle Brigade, raised in 1800 as
                    the 95th Regiment and armed with a flint-lock weapon known as “ Baker’s Rifle, ”
                    which weighed 9 j lb . The barrel was 2 j ft. long, its calibre 20-bore, with
                    seven grooves making a quarter-turn in its length. A small wooden mallet was at
                    first supplied with this rifle to make the ball enter the barrel, and it was
                    loaded with great difficulty. In 1826 Delvigne, a French infantry officer,
                    invented a breech with abrupt shoulders on which the spherical bullet was rammed
                    down until it expanded and filled the grooves. The objection was that the
                    deformed bullet had an erratic flight. Delvigne’s system was subsequently
                    improved upon by Thouvenin, who introduced into the breech an iron stem, upon
                    which the bullet, now of conical form, rested, and was expanded by a sharp blow
                    with the iron ramrod when loading. In William IV.’s reign the Brunswick
                    percussion rifle <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="1">
                        The percussion principle, invented by the Rev. Alexander John Forsyth
                        (1768-1843) in 1805, was not accepted for military arms until the
                        introduction of this rifle. A small and belated money grant was made to
                        Forsyth in 1843. See Major-General A. J.F. Reid’s memoir of Forsyth (1910).
                    </note> was introduced into the British rifle regiments. Its weight with bayonet
                    was 11 lb 5I oz.; length of barrel, 2 ft. 6 in., with two grooves making one
                    turn in the Iengthofthebarrel; weight of spherical belted bullet, 557 grs.;
                    diameter, 704 in.; charge of powder, 2 j drs. This rifle was not easily loaded,
                    soon fouled, and shot wild beyond 400 yds.lenght W. Greener produced a new
                    expansive bullet, an oval ball, a diameter and a half in length, with a flat
                    end, perforated, in which a cast metallic taper plug was inserted. The explosion
                    of the charge drove the plug home, expanded the bullet, filled the grooves and
                    prevented windage. A trial of the Greener bullet in August 1835 proved
                    successful. The range and accuracy of the rifle were retained, while the loading
                    was made as easy as with a smooth-bore musket. The invention was, however,
                    rejected by the military authorities on the ground that the bullet was a
                    compound one. In 1852 the Government awarded Minié, a Frenchman, £20,000 for a
                    bullet of the same principle adopted into the British service. In 1857 Greener
                    received a belated reward of £1000 for “ the first public suggestion of the
                    principle of expansion. ” The Minie bullet contained an iron cup in a cavity at
                    the base of the bullet. In 1851 a rifled musket of the Minie pattern was
                    introduced into the British army, and, though not generally issued, was used in
                    the Kaffir War of 1851, and in the Crimea. Its weight with bayonet was 10 Ib 81
                    oz., length of barrel 3 ft. 3 in., with four grooves making one turnin 72 in.;
                    diameter of bore -702 inch;</p>
                <p>charge of powder 2J drs., and sighted from 100 to 1000 yds The form of its bullet
                    was at first conoidal, afteiwards changed to cylindro-conoidal, with a
                    hemispherical iron' cup. In 1855 the Enfield rifle, having in a series of trials
                    competed favourably with the Minié and Lancaster rifles, was introduced into the
                    British army; it was used during the latter part of the Crimean war, having
                    there replaced the Minié rifle and the percussion musket,· and remained the
                    general weapon of the er,tire infantry until the introduction of the
                    breech-loader in the year 1867. This rifle weighed, with bayonet, 9 Ib 3 oz.,
                    barrel 39 in.; diameter of bore -577 in.; three-grooved, with one turn in 78 in.
                    It fired a bullet of cylindro-conoidal form with hollow base, weighing 530
                    grains, made up into cartridges and lubricated as for the Minié rifle, adapted
                    to this rifle by Pritchett, who was awarded £1000 by the Government. This bullet
                    was wrapped in greased paper round the cylindrical part half-way up its length.
                    Short rifles of the same pattern, with five-grooved barrels 2 ft. 9 in. long and
                    a sword bayonet, were supplied to the 60th Rifles and to the Rifle Brigade. Two
                    small carbines of the same principle were at this time introduced for the
                    cavalry and artillery, also a rifled pistol.</p>
                <p>In 1854, on the suggestion of General Lord Hardinge, Sir Joseph Whitworth, the
                    first mechanician of the day, began to consider the subject of rifling, and
                    after a long series of experiments the Whitworth rifle was produced with
                    hexagonal bore, 45-in. calibre, and with one turn in 20 in. It was tried at
                    Hythe in 1857, and completely defeated the Enfield rifle up to 1800 yds. upon a
                    fixed rest. This trial and Whitworth’s experiments proved the advantages of a
                    sharp twist, a smaller bore, and elongated projectile; but Whitworth’s rifle was
                    never adopted into the Government service, probably because the hexagonal
                    rifling wore badly, and owing to the difficulty of equal mechanical perfection
                    in all similar rifles and ammunition. Several improvements were subsequently
                    made in the sighting, grooving and some other details of the Enfield rifle. In
                    1855 a boxwood plug to the bullet was used.</p>
                <p>Between 1857 and 1861 four breech-loading carbines were experimentally introduced
                    in the cavalry—viz. Sharp’s, Terry’s, Green’s, and Westley-Richards’. Sharp’s
                    and other breechloading carbines and also Spencer repeating carbines were used
                    by the Federal cavalry in the American Civil War. The gcneraI adoption of the
                    breech-loading principle may be said to date from 1867. The Prussians were the
                    first to see its great advantages, and adopted the celebrated needle-gun(q.va
                    bolt-action weapon. In 1864</p>
                <p>and 1866 committees were appointed bythe British War Office to report on</p>
                <p>breech-loading arms,and after protracted experiments, Jacob Snider's method
                    ofconversion of the muzzle - loading Enfield to a breechloader (fig. 1) was</p>
                <p>adopted, with the metallic cartridge - case improved in 1867 by-Colonel Boxer,
                    R.A.All available Enfield rifles were thus converted, and new</p>
                <p>arms made with steel barrels instead of iron. Great Britain was the first to
                    adopt for her army a breech-loading</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r03-0327" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0350.jp2"/>
                <p>rifle with metallic cartridge-case, which secured the perfect obturation of the
                    breech. The Snider breech was a hinged block, a type much in favour at the time.
                    The French similarly converted their muzzle-loaders, the converted weapon being
                    known as the Tabatière or snuff-box. Other breech actions on the same principle
                    were the Austrian Werndl and the Bavarian Podewils and Werder rifles. But these
                    were only transitional arms. In 1866 France adopted the bolt-action Chassepdt
                        <hi rend="italic">(q.v.),</hi> in 1867 Sweden the Hagström, and Russia the
                    Carte; in 1868 Italy the Carcano. All these were breechloaders firing paper
                    cartridges containing their own means of ignition. After further experiments by
                    a fresh committee the Martini-Henry rifle (fig. 2) was definitely adopted by the
                    British Government in 1871, with the short chamber Boxer-Henry ammunition. This
                    rifle was a combination of Martini’s block action breech mechanism with Henry’s
                    barrel of 45-in. calibre, firing a <hi rend="italic">papered</hi> bullet of 480
                    grains from Boxer cases with a wad of wax lubrication at base of bullet, as
                    proposed by Henry. The Henry rifling had seven grooves with one turn in 22 in.;
                    the lands and the centres of the grooves were contained in the same circle.
                    About the same time or a little later the various powers re-armed their infantry
                    with breech-loaders of different patternsandnames, all of which were of about it
                    mm. (433 in.) calibre, and nearly all of the bolt-action type.</p>
                <p>The next stage in the history of military firearms was the introduction of the
                    repeating or magazine system. The Winchester rifle, an American invention which
                    appeared in 1865, was one of the earliest magazine rifles. This weapon was used
                    by Turkey to some extent in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78, but Germany was
                    the first great power to provide its army with a magazine rifle. In 1884 it
                    converted the 1871 pattern Mauserof 443-in. bore into a magazine rifle, holding
                    eight cartridges in a tube magazine in the fore end. In 1885 France followed
                    with the Lebel, which had an enormous advantage in its smokeless powder. In 1886
                    the question of the best calibre for small arms was reopened in England. In this
                    year, 1886, Austria had adopted a Mannlicher rifle, 433 bore, with a
                    straight-pull bolt. This rifle was the first adopted by any European nation
                    embodying Lee’s box magazine, an invention patented in 1879 and 1882, and
                    consisting of a box, in rear of and below the entrance to the chamber,
                    containing the cartridges. Another</p>
                <p>important improvement, the steel clip loader containing five cartridges, was also
                    introduced with this rifle. In 1888 these rifles were converted to .315 bore,
                    firing black powder cartridges; and in 1890, on the introduction of smokeless
                    powder, the sights were re-graduated. In 1887 the British SmallArms Committee,
                    after experiments with the small-calibre rifle invented in 1883 by the Swiss
                    Major Rubin, director of the Federal laboratory at Thun, recommended the small
                    calibre for adoption into the British service. The essential features of Rubin’s
                    system were the employment of a compound bullet with a leaden core in a copper
                    envelope, and the use of a compressed charge of black powder. In 1888 a pattern
                    of 303-01. calibre rifle, rifled on the Metford system and with the improved Lee
                    bolt and magazine, was approved for trial by British troops. The Metford rifling
                    is as follows:—diameter of bore, 30310.; depth of rifling, 004 in.; width of
                    lands, -023 in.; twist of rifling, one turn in to in. (left-hand); radial
                    grooves, seven in number. About 1862, and later, W. E. Metford had carried out
                    an exhaustive series of experiments on bullets and rifling. He invented the
                    important system of light rifling, with increasing spiral with a hardened
                    bullet. The Metford match rifle was prominent in all N.R.A. competitions from
                    1871 to 1894. In 1887 he laid down for the Small Arms Committee the proper
                    proportions for the grooving, spiral and cartridge chamber of the 303 military
                    rifle. This weapon proved satisfactory and was adopted by the War Office as the
                    Lee-Metford rifle, Mark I., in December 1888. It had a magazine of eight
                    cartridges. In 1891 the Alark II. pattern was approved, with a ten-cartridge
                    magazine, a simplified bolt, and many minor improvements. A magazine carbine
                    with barrel 2r in. long and a six-cartridge magazine, otherwise identical with
                    the Lee-Metford Mark II., was also approved. The Lee-Metford Mark II. rifle was
                    subsequently further improved in its rifling to resist the wear of smokeless
                    powder, and also in its bolt action, and became known as the Lee-Enfield rifle,
                    and under that name was officially adopted as the rifle of the British army. The
                    number of grooves were reduced from seven to five. Neither the Lee-Aletford nor
                    the Lee-Enfield has increasing spiral grooves, which are found inconvenient for
                    military arms from a manufacturing point of view <note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial" n="2"> Of all modem military rifles, the
                        Italian 1891 weapon alone has an increasing twist. </note> The L.AI. and
                    L.E. carbines are similar to the shorter models of the rifles, but are covered
                    for the whole length of the barrel by a wooden handguard and take only six
                    cartridges; the fore-sights are protected by wings on the nose-cap, and the
                    long-range sights are omitted. These, as also the Alartini-Metford and
                    Martini-Enfield carbines (falling-block action small-bores), have practically
                    been replaced by the “short” rifle described below.</p>
                <p>The efficiency of the modem small-bore magazine rifle is largely due to the
                    production of smokeless nitro-compound powder. France was the first country to
                    adopt, about 1885, a smokeless powder with the Lebel magazine rifle. It was
                    known as “ Vieille ” powder, or “ Poudre B ” (after General Boulanger). Since
                    then smokeless explosives have been universally adopted in all small-bore
                    magazine military rifles. The smokeless explosive known as “ Cordite ’’or“
                    Cordite Al.D.” (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Cordiie)</hi> is used for the
                    cartridges of the Lee-Aletford and Lee-Enfield rifles and rifle-calibre machine
                    guns.(H. S.-K.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Military Rifles of To-day.</hi> —About 1900, the various armies
                    were equipped with weapons of nearly equal efficiency. The weights varied
                    between 8} and 9J lb, the lengths between 49 and 52 in.; the calibres were 315,
                    311, 303, with one or two 256. None of the rifles were sighted to less than 2000
                    yds., and nearly all had a “ fixed ” or “ battle ” sight. All were bolt-action
                    rifles, and had a muzzle velocity of about 2000 f.s. (the -256 Mannlichers,
                    about 2300 f.s.). Except France, with the tube-magazine Lebel, Denmark and the
                    U.S.A. with the horizontal-box Krag-Jorgensen, and Great Britain, all nations
                    used multiple-loading by clip or charger. With Lebel and Krag-Jorgensen weapons,
                    multiple-loading is a practical impossibility, but in Great Britain the charger
                    was deliberately rejected. It was desired to use the rifle normally as a</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r03-0328" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0351.jp2"/>
                <p>single-loader, and to reserve the magazine (which held ten cartridges, or twice
                    as many as the multiple-loading Mausers, Mannlichers, &amp;c.) for emergencies.
                    But from about 1903 this equivalence of infantry weapons began to be disturbed
                    by two new influences: the tendency towards a “ short ” rifle, and the
                    introduction of the pointed bullet.</p>
                <p>In the first, Switzerland took the lead with the short Schmidt-Rubin in 1900. But
                    amongst the greater powers, England and the United States alone have followed
                    her example. At the close of the South African War Great Britain issued 1000
                    short Lee-Enfield rifles experimentally, and in 1903 the “ short rifle ” was
                    actually approved and issued generally. Since then it has been improved in
                    details. The barrel was shortened by 5 in., multiple-loading by charger was
                    introduced, and by the <hi rend="italic">Musketry Regulations</hi> of 1909
                    magazine fire was laid down as the normal, single-loading being forbidden. The
                    change met with very considerable opposition, especially from target-shooting
                    experts, who maintained that a long rifle, so perfected in details as to be
                    equal to the short in every point except in length, must be more accurate. The
                    view of the military authorities, which was maintained in spite of criticism,
                    was that for service purposes, and especially for prolonged snap-shooting, the
                    handier weapon was preferable. One important factor in the decision was the
                    desire to give the cavalry a weapon with which, when dismounted, it could fight
                    the infantry rifle on equal terms. A more serious objection than that of want of
                    superfine accuracy in bull’s-eye shooting was the loss of 5 in. of reach in
                    bayonet fighting. This objection was met in 1907 by the introduction of a new
                    pattern bayonet with a blade 5 in. longer. In 1908 the long Lee-Enfield and
                    Lee-Metford rifles in store were converted for charger-loading (fig. 3), fitted
                    with safety catches and</p>
                <p>The United States in 1904 replaced the Krag-Jorgensen (handloading horizontal
                    magazine) by the short Springfield. A sort of spring bayonet was at first fitted
                    to this rifle, but it was soon replaced by an ordinary sword bayonet.</p>
                <p>The pointed bullet (“ Spitz-geschoss'” or “S”) was introduced hy Germany in 1905,
                    and her example was quickly followed by France (balle D) and other powers. Its
                    advantage is a considerable flattening of the trajectory, chiefly on account of
                    the lessened resistance of the air. This latter allows of a reduction in the
                    sectional density and consequently in the weight of the bullet. Thus velocities
                    up to 2900 foot-seconds are realized, which enables the “ dangerous space ” to
                    be very greatly augmented (see fig. 20). The “ fixed sight ” range with the “ S”
                    bullet is 700 yds., as against the Lee-Enfield’s 500. It was announced in the
                    House of Commons in 1910 that a modified bullet was being experimented with, and
                    that some increase in the fixed-sight range was expected to be obtained, but the
                    relatively weak breech action of the Lee-Enfield—which is due chiefly to the
                    rearward position of the locking lugs—does not allow designers much freedom in
                    the matter of increasing velocities, as the chamber pressure has to be kept low.
                    It will be seen from the table that other rifles are constructed to stand a much
                    higher pressure.</p>
                <p>But both these improvements are destined to be eclipsed in importance by the
                    adoption of the automatic rifle. The application of the automatic principle to
                    the modem high-velocity small-arm of precision has been occupying the attention
                    of the small-arms experts of all armies and of numerous private inventors for
                    some years past. These numerous attempts have, in the case of the rifle, been
                    largely doomed to failure because of the necessary Umitations of space and
                    weight; although the automatic principle has been successfully applied both to
                    machine guns <hi rend="italic">(q.v.)</hi> and to pistols <hi rend="italic"
                        >(q.v.).</hi> In these weapons the work of extracting the empty
                    cartridge-case, re-loading and re-cocking, is accomplished either by the motive
                    power of the recoil or of the gas generated by the explosion of the powder, thus
                    enabling a rapid and continuous fire to be maintained to the fuU capacity of the
                    weapon’s magazine. In the case of machine guns the firing also is automatic, but
                    self-firing rifles are not very desirable as infantry weapons and in addition
                    are so heavy as to approximate to machine guns.</p>
                <p>Of the recoil-operated class of automatic rifles there are two subdivisions, “
                    short-recoil ” and “ long-recoil. ” In the former, which is most favoured by
                    inventors, the barrel, body and bolt recoil together for a short distance, about
                    } in., in which space the bolt is unlocked, and the bolt then recoils freely in
                    the body. The bolt is run forward in reloading by a spring. In the long-recoil
                    type the barrel, body and bolt recoil the whole distance, and the barrel and
                    body are run up by one spring, the bolt by another. Several such rifles have
                    been shown at the N.R.A. meetings at Bisley; the Rexer, Mauser and Woodgate
                    rifles being on the long-recoil, the Halle on the short-recoil principle.
                    Gas-operated rifles, like the Hotchkiss and Colt machine guns, have fixed
                    barrels and are worked by a portion of the powder-gases which is allowed to
                    escape from the barrel through a small hole near the muzzle, thence entering a
                    cylinder and working a piston in connexion with the breech mechanism. No
                    automatic rifle has as yet (August 1910) been issued as a service weapon by any
                    power, the problem of ensuring certainty in action under service conditions— <hi
                        rend="italic">i.e.</hi> with grit and dirt in the working parts—being the
                    principal difficulty.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Great Britain.—</hi> There are two principal types of
                    Lee-Metford and Lee-Enfield rifles in the service, the “ short ” and the “
                    chargerloading.” The former is carried by all units (cavalry included) of the
                    regular army, by the yeomanry cavalry of the Territorial Force, and by units of
                    the Officers’, Training Corps. The latter is used by the infantry of the
                    Territorial Force. There exist, further, the older, non-charger-loading
                    Lee-Metford and Lee-Enfield rifles, a few carbines of the same type, and some
                    Martini-Metford and Martini-Enfield carbines which have the *303 barrel and
                    cartridge with the falling-block Martini action. -45 Martini-Henry rifles and
                    carbines, and even Sniders, are still used by local police forces in some of the
                    smaller colonies.</p>
                <p>The “long” charger-loading Lee^Enfield is, converted, from earlier patterns by
                    the, addition of a charger guide, the stripping of the bolt-cover, and
                    improvements in the sighting. The action of the breech mechanism 1 is as follows
                    (the breech mechanism of the “ short ” rifle being practically the same) : The
                    breech is closed by a bolt (I) which slides in a bolt-way cut in the body; the
                    bolt-head (Io) abuts against the base of the cartridge when the rifle is loaded,
                    and when the knob is turned down the whole is locked. On the right side of the
                    bolt is a solid rib, and on the left side a lug; these support the bolt on
                    firing by contact with the “ resisting shoulder ” on the right, and the rear
                    face of the “ lug seating ” on the left of the body. Underneath the bolt there
                    are two recesses and two studs. The bolt-head is screwed to the bolt and is
                    fitted with an extractor claw. The bolt-head, instead of being rigidly attached
                    to the bolt, is so far independent that it remains stationary while the bolt is
                    revolved. Inside the bolt is the arrangement of striker (V) and spring (W), and
                    at its rear end, forming the Working connexion between trigger and striker, is
                    the “ cocking-piece ” (X) which 4s fitted with a safety-catch (not in the old
                    pattern rifle illustrated). This cocking-piece (which cannot turn) has a long
                    tongue projecting to the front, lying along the under side of the bolt, and the
                    front end of this tongue (Y), called the “ full-bent,”</p>
                <p><hi rend="sup">1</hi> The annexed figures show the old pattern weapon. In both
                    the existing patterns a safety catch is fitted, the magazine spring is of a
                    different shape and there is no bolt-cover. But the essential parts of the
                    action remain the same.</p>

                <p>engages the nose of the trigger sear when the weapon is loaded (a groove in the
                    tongue, called the " half-bent ” (Z), serves as a half-cock arrangement, and
                    could be used as a safety-catch if the proper safety-catch were damaged). The
                    trigger sear (K) is a bell-crank lever, the upper long arm of which is put in
                    and out of contact with the “ full-bent,” and the lower or short arm is
                    connected to the trigger. The magazine holds ten cartridges, which rest on a
                    platform, underneath which is the magazine spring that pushes the platform and
                    cartridges up. A “ cut-off ” is fitted in the “ long " and in some marks of the
                    “ short ” rifle. This is a sort of lid to the magazine, enabling the magazine to
                    be kept full while the rifle is being used as a single loader. But the present
                    musketry regulations forbid single-loading, and the cut-off is now only closed
                    for special. purposes, such as unloading a single cartridge (miss-fire, &amp;c.)
                    without unloading the magazine. The magazine is loaded by</p>
                <p>inserting a charger in the “ charger guides ” (these, attached to the body, form
                    a sort of bridge over the bolt) and forcing down the strip of cartridges into
                    the magazine (charger guides not shown in diagrams). The action of the mechanism
                    is as follows: Suppose that the rifle has been fired and the magazine is full.
                    On beginning to turn up the knob of the bolt, the latter is revolved, but the
                    cocking-piece (the tongue being held by a groove in the body) and the bolt-head
                    remain stationary. Soon, however, a cam on</p>
                <p>te bolt comes in contact with a stud on the cocking-piece and the latter is
                    brought slightly to the rear, pulling in the point of the striker and partly
                    compressing the spring. At the same time the lug on the left of the bolt, in
                    contact with the front face of a recess in the body (both being cut slantwise to
                    a screw pitch), forces the bolt and with it the claw of the extractor, which
                    grips the base of the cartridge-case, to slide backwards. a little. As the bolt
                    continues to turn the rib on the right of it comes up clear of the body and the
                    whole bolt, with the bolt-head, can thus be drawn back until the bolt-head comes
                    against the resisting shoulder on the</p>
                <p>right of the body and the extractor attached to it flings out the fired
                    cartridge-case. Another cartridge then comes up from the magazine and lies in
                    front of the bolt-head ready to be pushed home. At this moment (the beginning of
                    loading) the stud on the cocking-piece has fallen into one of the grooves on the
                    bolt, and as the bolt is pushed, forward the tongue or full-bent comes against
                    the nose of the trigger sear and is held there, while the rest of the bolt
                    mechanism goes on. Thus between the moving bolt and the fixed cocking-piece the
                    striker spring is further compressed, and when the sloping faces of the bolt
                    lugs and ribs engage the resisting portions of the body a last forward push is
                    given to the bolt and the spring is completely compressed, ready to propel the
                    striker forward when the full-bent is released from the nose of the sear. Figs.
                    5-8 of the older pattern rifle show the working of the breech mechanism. Instead
                    of the older single pull-off of the trigger the “short” rifle, like many
                    Continental weapons, has a double pull-off. This is provided for by suitably
                    shaping the portion of the trigger which is in contact with tne short arm of the
                    sear. The “ short ” rifle has also a somewhat different</p>
                <p>pattern of safety-catch.</p>
                <p>The sights of British service rifles up to 1903 were of a very simple type, the
                    fore-sight a “ barleycorn ” of triangular shape, and the back-sight a plain leaf
                    with sliding bar into which a V was cut, the tip of the fore-sight seen in the
                    middle of the V being brought on to the mark. In the long charger-loader this
                    form of back-sight has been greatly modified, and in the “ short ” rifle it has
                    been altogether abolished. The barleycorn fore-sight has been replaced in both
                    cases by an upright blade, protected from injury by two ears or wings, and the V
                    by a U aperture. For elevation the long rifle has still a slide on a vertical
                    leaf, but the movement of this slide is controlled no longer merely by its tight
                    fit but by a clamping screw. The sight of the short rifle is larger and also
                    quite different in appearance and principle. There is a leaf and on it a slide,
                    but the slide (controlled by clamping studs) works on a dam-shaped bed, its
                    position on the leaf, affecting the point of contact with the camshaped bed,
                    elevates the leaf to the required amount, the actual sighting U bein£ on the
                    extremity of the leaf. The short rifle has also a fine adjustment ” which admits
                    of minor changes of elevation within the usual 50 yds. graduation. Both the long
                    and the short rifles have “ wind-gauges,” or mechanisms for fine lateral
                    adjustment of the central U sighting aperture, so as to point the axis of the
                    barrel a little to the left or the right of the line of sight to compensate for
                    wind, error of the individual rifle, &amp;c. In both rifles, on the left side of
                    the stock, is a long-distance sight (graduated to 2800 yds.), which consists of
                    an aperture sight near the bolt and a dial and movable pointer near the
                    hand-guard. The short rifle is cased from breech to muzzle in a wooden
                    hand-guard ; all patterns of long rifle have only a short wooden hand-guard just
                    behind the back-sight bed. The bayonet in the long rifle is secured to the
                    fore-end by a spring catch and to the barrel by a ring passing over the muzzle.
                    This traditional, and still usual, arrangement has been abandoned in the short
                    rifle, as the vibration of the barrel on discharge is more or less checked by
                    the extra weight of the bayonet, and therefore the shooting of tne rifle differs
                    according as it is fired with or without the bayonet fixed. With the short rifle
                    the bayonet is fixed to two metal fastenings, a plug for the ring and a catch
                    for the handle.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Continental European Rifles.—</hi> These are for the most part
                    of the Mauser and the Männlicher types., The Mauser is a bolt weapon with box
                    magazine. The bolt is simple, without separate bolt-head, and is held by two
                    bolt-lugs at its front end engaging with recesses in the body (the German Mauser
                    has an extra lug near the. rear end). Near the rear end there is a cam-shaped
                    recess, which, engaging with a stud on the cocking-piecc, partially forces back
                    the cocking-piece and spring when the bolt is revolved. When the bolt lever is
                    turned up and the bolt begins to revolve, the cocking-piece and bolt plug, which
                    together form the connexion between the bolt and the trigger, do not revolve,
                    but are forced back slightly, so as to begin the compression of the striker
                    spring. Then, the bolt lever being so shapâl as to bear against an
                    inclined-plane edge on the body, the bolt comes back a little, and with it the
                    extractor jaw and the empty cartridge-case. Lastly, when the bolt has turned
                    through a right angle, all studs are opposite their slots and ways in the body,
                    and the bolt can be drawn back. At the farthest rearward position of the bolt
                    the cocking-stud on the cocking-piece. is well behind the nose of the trigger
                    sear, and is thus held when the bolt is pushed forward again, the spring being
                    thereby compressed. All Mauser rifles have a safety-catch and a double pull-off.
                    None have cut-offs except the Turlash pattem. All are constructed for clip or
                    charger loading, but the box magazine contains only five cartridges as against
                    the Lee-EnfieldS ten. Mauser rifles, which are perhaps the strongest and least
                    complicated of magazine arms, are used in the German, Belgian, Spanish,
                    Portuguese and Turkish armies, and were also used by the Bocrs in the South
                    African War. The type adopted by each of these nations differs from the rest in
                    details only. The German rifle has a long guardless sword bayonet, fixed to the
                    fore-end only and not connected with the barrel, and a peculiar form of
                    back-sight, which bears some resemblance to the</p>

                <p>slide and bed arrangement of the British “ short ” rifle. The special feature of
                    the Belgian Mauser is a thin steel casing fpr the barrel,</p>
                <p>which is supposed to act as a hand-guard or cooler and to free the barrel from
                    disturbing influences due to its connexion with the fore-end; but it is
                    expensive, and if strong adds unduly to the weight</p>
                <p>of the weapon. The older German magazine rifle, pattern 1888, had a barrel
                    casing, but this was given up when the new 1898 pattern was introduced. The
                    bayonets of the Belgian and Spanish patterns are very short knives.</p>
                <p>The Mannlicher rifle, which is extensively used for sporting and target work, has
                    been adopted for military purposes by various states, notably Austria-Hungary.
                    Both the 1890 and1895 patterns of Austrian Mannlicher have “ straight-pull”
                    bolts; that is, bolts which are not turned for locking. The</p>
                <p>bolts are in two parts, which telescope ” into each other. In the 1890 pattern
                    (see fig. 12), when the bolt I is home against the cartridge and the “ lever
                    cylinder I', which carries the bolt knob, is further pushed forward, the hinged
                    block R is caused to drop in front of the resistance-piece Q, and so locks the
                    bolt I against the cartridge. ln the 1895 pattern (see fig· !3), the final
                    pushing forward of the lever cylinder causes the head of the bolt 1 to turn and
                    projections on its head to lock into recesses SS just in rear of the breech. The
                    turning is due to helical feathers (20) on the inside of the lever cylinder I'
                    Working in grooves in the rear of the bolt I. The 1890 pattern has a double
                    pull-off. It will be seen from the figure that as the trigger is pulled the
                    bearing is taken first at (8) and then at (9). This gives, owing</p>
                <p>to the change of leverage, power at the commencement and rapidity at the end of
                    the pull. The weapon is a clip loader. The Dutch.</p>
                <p>Rumanian and other Mannlichers have not straight-pull bolts, but the usual
                    turn-over levers and locking-lugs.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">France.—</hi> The breech mechanism of this rifle (see fig. 15)
                    calls for no special remark. Its bolt is. very similar to that of the British
                    rifle. Its special peculiarity is the once popular tube magazine under the
                    fore-end. This has many defects as compared with the box magazine. It is more
                    cumbrous for the same number of cartridges; its feed and cut-off mechanism is
                    very complicated; the balance of the rifle is altered as the magazine empties;
                    the placing of the cartridges base to point, even when the bullet has a flat
                    point, is not unattended with danger, especially when the magazine is full and
                    the spiral spring strongly compressed; lastly, loading by any form of charger is
                    practically impossible .</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">United States.—</hi> Up to 1904 the U.S. army had the
                    Krag-Jorgensen rifle, in which, as shown in fig. 17, the magazine was placed
                    horizontally under the breech action. At this time most 01 the second line
                    troops had still the old-fashioned (black powder) Springfield rifle, a single
                    loader with a hinged block similar to the rifles of the “ sixties ” in Europe,
                    such as the Snider, the Tabatière and the Werndl. <note anchored="true"

                    1904, however, the regular army has been re-armed with a short rifle (fig. 18)
                    which in its action has a general resemblance to a Mauser. As at first issued,
                    the new Springfield had a rod bayonet which, whbe not in use, lay within the
                    fore-end of the stock, and when required was run forward and fastened by a
                    catch. This novelty was, however, soon discarded in favour of a sword bayonet 16
                    in. long. The United States navy had until about 1900 the Lee “ straight-pull ”

                <p>“ 30th year ” (1900) and “ 38th year ” (1907) rifles are bolt-action weapons,
                    with no special peculiarities. The <hi rend="italic">Swiss</hi> rifle
                    (Schmidt-Rubin). is a remarkable weapon of the straight-pull type, short, and
                    possessing a relatively low velocity. (X.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Use of the Rifle in War.—</hi> The study of “ musketry ” as
                    distinct from target shooting may be said to date from the Franco-German War.
                    Previously military students and practical soldiers concerned themselves rather
                    with the tactical question of fire-power—fire <hi rend="italic">versus</hi>
                    shock, bullet <hi rend="italic">versus</hi> bayonet and so on—</p>
                <p>than with the technical question of its application. This was natural enough in
                    the days of short-range fighting. But when bullets began to cause losses at 1000
                    yds. and more from the firing point, formations that presented the least
                    vulnerable target had to be discovered and tested, aiming grew more difficult as
                    the range increased, and firing by word of command in large units became
                    practically impossible. The very accuracy and range of modern weapons involved
                    new problems. The necessity, in the larger area of effective fire, of setting
                    the sights to the distance of the mark made further demands on fire-discipline
                    and brought up the difficult problem of judging distance. The possibilities of
                    varying the rate of fire conferred by the magazine rifle also demanded close
                    study. Each war, as it came, produced fresh evidence as to what was possible and
                    what was not in matters of fire-control, the best rate of fire for effect, the
                    range at which fire should be opened, and other half-tactical, half-technical
                    problems. Thus, although many points still remain in the region of controversy,
                    certain ideas and principles are almost universally accepted as the basis of
                    service musketry.</p>
                <p>The leading idea is that of the “ cone of dispersion.” A modern rifle, even fired
                    from a fixed rest under good conditions, will not place shot after shot in the
                    same spot, but the shot-marks on the target form a more or less close “ group.”
                    When to this error of the rifle and the ammunition there is added the personal
                    error of the marksman, the group is larger, and in the collective fire of a
                    squad it is larger still. Now the trajectories of bullets that do not strike in
                    the same place naturally do not coincide, and the group on the target is
                    represented in the air by a cone or sheaf of trajectories. The bullets of this
                    sheaf striking the ground on either side of the target form on the ground a much
                    elongated ellipse. The ellipse containing 90 % of the bullets fired is called
                    the <hi rend="italic">beaten zone.</hi> It is usual, however, to calculate from
                    the “ effective ” zone, or that which contains 75% of bullets. Within the
                    “effective” zone, and at its centre, is found the closely grouped “ nucleus ”
                    of</p>
                <p>The target aimed at and sighted for is at the centre of the zone (see fig. 19).
                    The height of the grouping on a vertical target compared to the depth of the
                    grouping on the ground is of course proportionate to the tangent of the angle of
                    descent; hence, small as is the group on a vertical target at 500 yds., the
                    beaten zone is no less than 320 yds. deep. For the same reason, as the range,
                    and consequently the angle of descent, increases, the beaten zone diminishes in
                    depth. Another factor is the “ dangerous space.” This is the space between “
                    first catch,” <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> the point at which the bullet (in a
                    sheaf, the lowest bullet) comes low enough to catch a man’s head, and“ first
                    graze,” that at which it strikes the ground. The extent of this dangerous space
                    varies of course with the height of the man’s head. In the case of a mounted
                    man, at 1000 yds., it is 105 yds., while in that of a sharpshooter lying down,
                    it is only 13 yds. (in addition of course to the beaten zone). As nowadays
                    nearly all targets, on service, are lying or three-quarters concealed figures,
                    the dangerous space as compared with the beaten zone is at such .a range too
                    small to count as a factor. It is, however, important at shorter ranges, 500
                    yds. and under (700 and under with the new pointed bullets). Here the advantages
                    of flat trajectory make themselves felt. Within this distance the bullet is at
                    no point in its career too high to be dangerous to a standing man or a horseman.
                    A lying figure is in danger at any distance beyond 350 yds. if the sights are
                    set to 500 yds. (front half of effective zone no yds., dangerous space 52 yds.).
                    This is the theory underlying the 500 yds. “ fixed sight ” or “ battle-sight,” a
                    setting which holds good for all less ranges, and can be put on the rifle
                    instantly and without looking at the back-sight graduations.</p>
                <p>These facts, taken in conjunction with the imperfections of the most skilful
                    individual marksmanship and the chances of wrong estimation of distance, are the
                    basis of the musketry training and practice of to-day. At the School of
                    Musketry, Hythe, the standard of judging distance is “ not more than</p>
                <p>50% of bullets. With the British 303 rifle in collective fire, the depths of
                    these zones are:—</p>

                <p>100 yds. wrong at any range. Now at 1000 yds. an error in judging distance of 13
                    yds. above or below the true range will cause all the shots of a particular
                    rifle to fall away from the target, and the better the marksman— <hi
                        rend="italic">i.e.</hi> the closer his group—the more necessary is
                    perfection in judging distance, a perfection which in reality seems
                    unattainable. The British, musketry regulations therefore lay it down that the
                    individual marksman’s fire at service targets is unprofitable at ranges of more
                    than 600 yds. Beyond that distance collective fire, controlled and directed by
                    an officer or non-commissioned officer, is the rule. The question as to whether
                    fire is to be opened in any given set of circumstances is decided by the
                    fire-director, who considers first whether the probable error in judging
                    distance is greater than half of the effective zone for the estimated range. If
                    it is so, he must order “ combined sights,” <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> half of
                    the units under his command use one elevation, the rest another, which method
                    artificially increases the dispersion of the bullets and thereby the probability
                    of the target being included in the zone. This, however, makes the fire less
                    effective, and in practice cannot profitably be used by any body of rifles of
                    less than 80 or 100. The commander of only a single section, therefore, however
                    tempting the target, must refrain from opening fire at all. At medium ranges,
                    however, controlled and directed fire is effective, and at such ranges troops
                    should still be sufficiently in</p>
                <p>hand to execute the fire-director’s orders. Within decisive ranges fire-direction
                    has to give place to fire-control. All that the strongest commander can enforce
                    is the opening and ceasing of fire when he gives the order, and success is
                    sought through making the individual soldier skilful at rapid and snap shooting.
                    Black bull’s-eyes on white targets are now used only to teach men to make
                    uniformly good shooting, which is shown by the closeness of the shot-grouping.
                    The rest of the musketry course is fired against grey-green “ head and shoulders
                    ” targets or brown silhouettes, and consists of slow, rapid and snap shooting,
                    from behind cover, at disappearing or running targets, &amp;c. In 1909 special
                    attention began to be paid to visual training, both as an aid to judging
                    distance and as an actual ingredient of fire-discipline. A method of indicating
                    targets which originated in the French army was adopted and improved upon,
                    consisting essentially of giving two or three conspicuous “ auxiliary marks,” in
                    artillery language, and naming the target with reference to them. Judging
                    distance is generally associated with fire-discipline practices, and men are
                    frequently exercised in locating and ranging upon a hidden skirmisher, 300-800
                    yds. away. Perhaps the most important modification of musketry training, within
                    recent years, has been the adoption of rapid fire in “ bursts,” as the normal
                    procedure for infantry, instead of slow continuous fire. The complete cessation
                    of fire at intervals enables the leaders to observe the</p>

                <p>progress of the engagement, to change their target, to economize ammunition, to
                    select the ground for the next rush and the next burst of fire, and to regain
                    control of the men, whom a prolonged fire-fight hypnotizes and rivets to the
                    ground. The chief use of “ slow ” fire, which is generally employed by
                    skirmishers working in pairs, is to keep the enemy under; the storm of
                    well-directed “ rapid fire ” the fire-director should hold in his own hands,
                    ready to release it at the right moment. Slow fire averages 3 rounds a minute,
                    rapid (aimed) S-12. The configuration of the ground has often a great influence
                    on fire effect. If the target is on a sharp forward slope, the beaten zone is
                    greatIy diminished in depth, ranging errors are no longer neutralized by the
                    flatness of trajectory and (the bullets meeting the ground at a steeper angle)
                    the dangerous space is reduced; if, on the other hand, the slope descends gently
                    in rear of the target so that the falling bullets instead of making a pattern
                    upon the ground, skim along parallel to the surface, the zone is increased. For
                    instance, at 1500 yds., if there is a reverse slope of about 5° in rear of the
                    target the depth of the beaten zone is tenfold that of the zone for the same
                    range on level ground. Similarly if the target is on the crest of a hill and the
                    firers below, the “ over ” half of the cone of fire may graze the reverse slope
                    or pass far above, according as the re-veise slope is gentle or sharp with
                    respect to the (line of sight.</p>
                <p>The normal position for the firing infantryman in action is</p>
                <p>lying; the kneeling position is used for firing from behind cover, the sitting
                    for firing down hill. Standing, formerly the usual position, is now employed
                    chiefly for firing behind cover with the rifle rested, and for snap-shooting
                    during an advance when it is undesirable to halt and lie down. As regards cover,
                    it may be mentioned that well-covered or intrenched troops generally shoot less
                    accurately than troops in the open, the soldier in security being loth to expose
                    himself Iong enough to take careful aim. This was particularly noticeable in the
                    Russo-Turkish War, and its effect is to create a zone of unaimed fire behind the
                    assailants’ fighting line, which sometimes causes serious losses to his supports
                    and reserves. The relation between the cone of dispersion of peace-time
                    experiments, even when these are specially designed to establish that relation
                    (for example, series fired in France by third-class shots, after a long march
                    without food), has never been satisfactorily established. An arbitrary figure of
                    one-tenth or one-twentieth of peace-time effect has generally been assumed as
                    representing war results, but some think that however the normal cone may be
                    multiplied or divided, no relation can be found between peace and war effect,
                    and that in battle the brave men aim and fire as if on the practice range, and
                    the rest fire absolutely at hazard. From a musketry point of view, this brings
                    again into the foreground the question of distance-judging, as, if the sights be
                    wrongly set, the more accurate the fire the less its effect, and a</p>

                <p>mistake would nullify even the small amount of aimed fire that can be reckoned
                    upon. Peace-time experiments have their value—and it is very great—in
                    establishing data as to the effect of fire on troops in different formations,
                    the limits of permissible error in ranging, &amp;c., on the principle that of
                    two methods, that which is proved to be better in peace would in much the same
                    proportion be found better in war. (C, F. A.)</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Match or Target Rifle.—</hi> The sport or pastime of target
                    shooting has many times changed its character, owing to the steady improvement
                    in the rifle and the different ranges or distances at which shooting is
                    practised. Range usually governs the construction of the target rifle,
                    long-range rifles not being necessarily the best weapons for a short range of,
                    say, 200 yds. Limitations—such as the amount of powder charge, weight of bullet
                    and rifle—are also usually imposed in order to place all competitors on equal
                    terms. The long-range match rifle is not the superior of the military rifle as a
                    weapon, but as a scientific shooting instrument is the best small-arm produced.
                    The ordinary target rifle is a hybrid arm, combining the points of the
                    long-range match, modern military and best sporting rifles. The miniature match
                    rifle is used for short-range practice.</p>
                <p>Shooting at fixed marks has been practised continuously in Switzerland from
                    medieval times. A club (“ Société de Pharquebuse et de la Navigation ”) has
                    existed in Geneva since 1474; and the Zürich “ Schützen-Gesellschaft ” since
                    about the same date. It is not clear at what period rifles were introduced in
                    these clubs. From the beginning of the 19th century up to 1844 the rifle
                    generally used in Great Britain had a polygrooved barrel -630 in. in diameter,
                    with spherical ball, and the arm weighed from 11 to 15 lb. It was not fired in
                    military fashion, but had a handle extending downwards fixed in front of the
                    trigger-guard, which was grasped by the left hand, the left arm being steadied
                    against the body. This method of shooting is still sometimes followed by Swiss
                    and German riflemen. Target shooting as a sport or business was rarely practised
                    in Great Britain until after the formation of the Volunteer Force in 1859. The
                    inauguration of the “ National Rifle Association ” in i860 opened a new and most
                    important era in the history and development of the rifle. This institution was
                    established “ for the encouragement of rifle corps and the promotion of rifle
                    shooting throughout Great Britain. ... As a national pastime to make the rifle
                    what the bow was in the days of the Plantagenets, the familiar weapon of those
                    who stand forth in the defence of their country,” The first meeting of the
                    N.R.A. was held at Wimbledon in i860. The first shot was fired by Queen Victoria
                        <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="4"> The “Queen's”
                        or " King’s ” prize is the highest distinction to which a rifle shot can
                        attain. The competition is one of three stages, the first and second
                        eliminating all but the best 100 competitors. The bronze medal of the N.R.A.
                        is awarded to the highest scorer in the first stage, the silver medal to the
                        leader in the second, and the King’s prize and N.R.A. gold medal to the
                        winner in the last stage: 71 shots in all are fired at distances up to 1000
                        yds., and the winners’ scores of late years have been 320 to 325 out of a
                        possible 355. Only the service rifle is allowed. </note> from a Whitworth
                    rifle on a machine rest, at 400 yds., and struck the bull’s-eye. The Whitworth
                    muzzle-loading rifle won many of the important prizes at this and subsequent
                    meetings prior to 1871. Its most important features, arrived at after exhaustive
                    experiments, were a smaller bore of 450 in., with a twist of rifling of one turn
                    in 20 in., and an elongated mechanically fitting projectile. Long-range rifle
                    construction is also largely indebted to Whitworth for the highly accurate and
                    superior tools and processes introduced by him in this branch of
                    manufacture.</p>
                <p>In 1866 and after, Metford’s system of hardened expanding bullets and shallow
                    rifling gradually superseded the mechanically fitting system of Whitworth, and
                    the Whitworth rifle gradually lost its position. In 1861, the Henry grooving for
                    a cylindrical bullet, a modification of the Whitworth, first appeared. In 1864,
                    Rigby, with a five-grooved rifle and a mechanically fitting bullet, tied with
                    the Whitworth rifle in the preliminary rifle trial of the N.R.A. at 1000 yds.,
                    and in a subsequent trial took the first place. By 1871 the Whitworth rifle bad
                    given place to the Metford system with hardened cylindrical bullets, shallow
                    rifling and increasing spiral. In 1867 the modern breech-loading rifle with a
                    metallic, cartridge was first introduced. The Metford system of rifling greatly
                    assisted its development. In this year Rigby also produced a new model
                    long-range rifle designed on the lines followed by Metford. In 1869 the Henry
                    barrel came to the front. In 1870 the Martini-Henry, the new service arm, won
                    the duke of Cambridge’s prize, the extreme range in this competition being 800
                    yds. In 1871 the Snider breech-loader replaced the Enfield muzzle-loader, and
                    the Martini-Henry replaced the Whitworth in the later stages-—800, 900 and 1000
                    yds.—of the Queen’s prize. The Metford barrel was also used in breech-loaders,
                    and the duke of Cambridge’s prize—for the first time fired at 1000 yds.—fell to
                    it. During the twenty-three years from 1871 to 1894 the Metford military match
                    rifle only four times failed to win this prize, while it took a preponderating
                    share of other prizes. The years 1872 and 1873 marked a decided advance in the
                    military breechloader, though for fine shooting the muzzle-loader still seemed
                    hard to equal. In 1875 a team of American riflemen first visited Wimbledon with
                    “ army-pattern ” breech-loading rifles, which were cleaned out after every shot,
                    and met with considerable success. A feature of their shooting was the “ back
                    position,” then a novelty. In 1877 the superiority of the cleansable and
                    cleansed breech-loader over the increased fouling of the muzzle-loader was
                    clearly demonstrated, though the muzzle-loader did not at once disappear. In
                    1878 the highest scores ever made with the muzzle-loader in Great Britain were
                    recorded, greater care in cleaning the rifle after every shot being
                    observed.</p>
                <p>In 1883 the N.R.A. Council altered the conditions, wiping out after every shot
                    was forbidden, but muzzle-loaders were not disqualified. The result was that the
                    American type of rifle disappeared. The poor shooting of the Martini at 1000
                    yds. induced the Council to take the retrograde step of reducing the maximum
                    range for the Queen’s prize to 900 yds. In 1890 the N.R.A. first met at the new
                    ranges at Bisley. This year was noticeable for the excellent shooting made in
                    the “ any ” rifle competitions by the Gibbs-Metford match rifle, particularly at
                    1000 yds. range. The accepted type was 461 calibre; 7 grooves 0045 in. in depth;
                    80 grains of special black gunpowder, and a bullet of 570 grains. In 1892 and
                    1893 the Lee-Metford 303 rifle with cordite ammunition was first used by the
                    army teams. In 1890 and later the Hon. T. F. Fremantle, Captain Gibbs and some
                    others used Metford’s copper-coated bullets in the Gibbs-Metford rifle with
                    success. In 1895 many match rifle shots followed their example. In 1895 and 1896
                    the -303 was equalled, and in some instances beaten, by the smaller-calibre
                    Mannlicher rifle. This was partly due to faulty Lee-Metford ammunition. The 303
                    now proved its superiority to the -450 Martini, especially at the longer ranges.
                    The Bisley meeting of 1896 practically closed the series of contests with both
                    the Martini and the military match rifles. The Volunteers were thenceforth armed
                    with the -303.</p>
                <p>The results of the Bisley meetings since 1895 have proved that rifles of the -303
                    class, the British -303 rifle particularly, are not so good for match rifles
                    pure and simple as the larger bores using black powder. The light bullets are
                    more subject to deflection by the wind at long ranges than the heavier
                    speed-retaining bullets of the larger bores. No nitro-powder used appears to
                    have equalled the black powder in regularity of shooting. At the same time the
                    object of the N.R.A. competitions is to encourage the use of the military
                    service rifle in the first place, and in the case of the “ any ” rifle
                    competitions to encourage the production of weapons of the highest efficiency
                    for military purposes. Acting on these principles the rifles allowed by the
                    N.R.A. regulations (1907) are classed as follows:— <hi rend="italic">Class

                    combination fore-sight have been sanctioned. No lateral adjustment of fore- or
                    back-sight is permitted. The miniature rifles allowed fall into two classes, “
                    military,” with open sights, only, and “ any,” with no restrictions as to sights
                    except that magnifying and telescopic sights are forbidden.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Modern American Target Rifles.</hi> —-In America, according to
                    some authorities, there are three recognized departments of target
                    shooting—namely off-hand shooting; shooting from a simple rest; and shooting
                    from a machine rest, with telescopic or any other sight. For the first two
                    classes small-bore rifles of 380 calibre or under only are used. The usual
                    weight is from 8 to 10 lb, with 28- or 30-in. barrel. Light charges for the
                    shorter ranges are used. In the 380 bore only 55 grains of powder with a
                    330-grain bullet is employed. In the second-class contests, from a simple rest,
                    the barrel is longer and the weight increased to just under 12 lb. The bore is
                    generally -380. The usual range is 200 yds. The third-class shooting from a
                    machine rest, generally with telescopic sights, is not much practised. Every
                    kind of rifle is employed, usually of large bore and weighing from 20 to 60 lb.
                    The long-range breech-loading match rifle, with which so much fine shooting was
                    done when wiping out after each shot was allowed, weighed about 10 lb; the
                    breech mechanism, any falling block, as the Sharp, Farquhar-son, Deeley, and
                    Edge or Wiley, that admitted the insertion of the cleaning rod at the breech;
                    length of barrel, 32 to 34 in.; seven or more grooves 003 to *005 in depth with
                    a complete turn in 20 in. A sharp continual spiral and very shallow grooves
                    constituted the feature of the American plan. Rigby’s plan was similar, with one
                    turn in 18 in. and eight grooves, the lands being about half the width of the
                    grooves. In the Wiley the grooves were fewer and wider. The Metford is an
                    increasing twist, starting with one turn in 60 in. and finishing with one in 20,
                    or sharper. The usual bore of the American long-range rifle was 458 or 461;
                    powder, 76 grains of special “ fouling ” rifle powder; elongated cylindrical
                    bullet of 540 grains. The pull-off was under 3 lb. During recent years
                    smaller-bore smokeless-powder rifles have also been used.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Continental Match Rifles.—</hi> The target rifle used by
                    continental marksmen for medium ranges is a modification of the old pattern
                    Swiss rifle, with scroll guard, hollowed butt plate and hair trigger. This
                    latter, a mechanical device to free the tumbler from the sear without sufficient
                    pull on the trigger to influence the aim, is disallowed in military arms.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Sporting Rifles.—</hi> Prior to 1845 smooth-bore guns with
                    double charge of powder and an ounce spherical ball were generally preferred to
                    rifles for sporting purposes and for large game; 16 - bore muzzle-loading rifles
                    were occasionally used by British sportsmen in the East Indies before that date,
                    firing 1 I drs. of powder with a spherical ounce ball. These rifles were sighted
                    to 200 yds., but the trajectory was high and the penetration weak; they were
                    also difficult to load when foul. The twist of the rifling was also too rapid,
                    causing the bullet to strip with heavy charges of powder. According to Captain
                    Forsyth and others, up to 1860 there was no known rifle suitable</p>
                <p>for sporting purposes in India. Rifles of 12-bore gauge, firing a spherical ball,
                    were subsequently made, with broad and shallow grooves making one turn in 10 ft.
                    The bullet, of the same diameter as the bore, was loaded with a thin patch that
                    took the grooving. These rifles proved very successful, possessing velocity
                    equal to a smooth-bore of the same calibre, accuracy for sporting distances,
                    flat trajectory and great striking power. In 1855 W. Greener produced the “ Cape
                    rifle ” for South African sport, calibre 450 or 500; rifling, two deep grooves
                    with one turn in 26 in., with a flanged bullet to fit the grooves; weight, 12
                    lb; sighted up to 1200 yds. This rifle was successful, and others were built by
                    Purdey, who in 1856 named the pattern “ Express Train.” Since that date the word
                    “ express ” has been generally used to denote a rifle possessing high velocity,
                    flat trajectory and long fixed-sight range. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial" n="6"> The term “ point-blank range ” is often used in this
                        connexion. Strictly speaking, there is no such thing as ” point-blank
                        range,” the bullet commencing to drop immediately it leaves the muzzle of
                        the rifle. The path or trajectory of the bullet if .fired horizontally is
                        therefore always a downward curve. The higher the muzzle velocity the
                        flatter is this curve. The “ fixed-sight,” or so-called “ point-blank ”
                        range, is usually taken at such range, generally 100 yds. with black powder,
                        and with such elevation as render the amount of drop of the bullet or curve
                        of its path practically immaterial for sporting purposes, say a maximum of
                        4I in. At shorter range this curve would therefore take the bullet so much
                        above the line of fixed-sight aim, and must where necessary be allowed for.
                        With the high-velocity small-bore rifle the fixed-sight range can be
                        increased to 200 yds. for the sporting rifle ; and for military purposes ’
                        in the field to 500 yds. and (with pointed bullets) even more. </note> In
                    America small-bore rifles were used earlier in the 19th century. The celebrated
                    Kentucky rifles were of various sizes, firing spherical balls of 90, 60 and 40
                    to the lb, and were renowned for their accuracy and fixed-sight range up to 100
                    yds. Some maintain that the express rifle was developed from the Kentucky model.
                    The modern express rifle may be defined as a breech-loading rifle with a height
                    of trajectory not exceeding 4! in. at 150 yds., with a muzzle velocity of at
                    least 1750 f.s. These rifles are usually 5- to 7-grooved, double-barrelled, with
                    26- to 28-in. barrels of 360, -400, 450, 500 and 577 bores, weighing
                    respectively from 6j to 7 lb, 7 to 8 lb, 7Î to 9 lb, 81 to 10 Ib and 10} to 12
                    lb. The respective average charges are : bullet,50 grains ; powder, 50 grains;
                    209 and 82; 270 and no; 340 and 130; 520 and 160; the fixed-sight ranges, 130,
                    160, 150,* 130 and 120 yds. Double and single express rifles of 303 bore with
                    26-in. barrels are also made.</p>
                <p>Since the invention of cordite powder and the advent of the small-bore
                    high-velocity rifle for military purposes, the variety of sporting rifles with
                    different-sized bores has increased. Sporting cordite express rifles are now
                    made, both single- and double-barrelled, of the following calibres: 256, 265,
                    276, 303, 310 ,360, 370, 375, 400, 450, 500, 577 and 600. Some of these
                    calibres, such as 500, 577 and 600, are seldom used with cordite. The 450
                    cordite express is the largest bore high-velocity rifle recommended.</p>
                <p>The modern small-bore military rifle already described possesses all the best
                    qualities of an express sporting rifle— namely accuracy, flat trajectory, high
                    muzzle velocity and long point-blank or fixed-sight range up to 200 yds. The
                    muzzle velocity of the *03 bore with black powder is 1850 f.s.; with cordite,
                    2100 f.s. The hollow-pointed or slit expanding bullet is generally used in these
                    high-velocity rifles, as in the black-powder express, for ordinary sporting
                    purposes, with the solid metal cartridge-case. The pointed bullet is also
                    sometimes used, generally with the 375 and 475 calibre rifles, and gives an
                    increased muzzle velocity of 2500 f.s. The trajectory of the cordite rifle is
                    stated to be 10 in. flatter at 200 yds. than that of a black-powder rifle of
                    similar calibre and corresponding charge. The variety of bores in sporting
                    rifles is due largely to restrictions on the importation of arms of the military
                    calibres (especially 303) into India and South Africa.</p>
                <p>The sights of sporting express rifles are of some variety, and are usually
                    designed and made with special care. The open V</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r03-0336" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0359.jp2"/>
                <p>back-sight on an ivory pyramid with two or three leaves up to 300 yds., and the
                    enamelled bead fore-sight, are the most usual form. The more elaborate Lyman and
                    Beech peep-sights are also popular. One or two varieties of telescope sight,
                    attachable to the barrel, are also made by some leading gunmakers, and have been
                    used with success in the field. Solid-drawn brass cartridge-cases are now always
                    used for sporting rifles, except occasionally for some of the larger bores, in
                    which paper cartridges may be used. The peculiarity of the express bullet is its
                    hollow point, which is intended to ensure the expansion of the projectile on
                    impact. This diminishes its penetration, but translates its velocity or energy
                    into “ shock.” If greater penetration is needed, the leaden bullet is hardened
                    with mercury or tin, or the military nickel-coated bullet is used. Explosive
                    bullets filled with detonating powder were at one time used in express and
                    large-bore rifles for large game. These are now practically abandoned, owing to
                    their uncertainty of action and the danger in handling them. The use of the
                    large 4- and 8-bore black-powder rifles is restricted to the hunting of large
                    and dangerous game. These are usually double-barrelled. The 4-hore weighs from
                    14 to 18 Ib with 20-in. barrels, and fires a charge of 12 to 14 drs. of powder,
                    with a spherical bullet of 1510 grs. The great weight of this rifle is against
                    its general use. The 8-bore rifle weighs from nJ to 15 Ib with 20- to 24-in.
                    barrels, with a charge of 8 to 12 drs. of powder with a spherical ball. These
                    rifles are accurate and effective up to 120 yds. Rook and rabbit rifles are
                    usually single-barrel breech-loading rifles of from 220 yards to 380 bore,
                    hammerless, ejectectors. The range is ordinarily restricted to 200 yds.</p>
                <p>Combined rifles and shot-guns are generally used in countries where the kind of
                    game to be met with is not known beforehand, and by emigrants who can only
                    afford one gun. These weapons are double-barrelled (450 rifle barrel and 16-bore
                    short harrel; or 500 rifle and 12-bore shot). Such a gun has many drawbacks,
                    being too heavy for a shot-gun and too light for a rifle, with a bad balance.
                    More modern combinations of the rifle and shot-gun are Holland’s “ Paradox,” a
                    smooth bore with the last three inches of the barrel ratchet-rifled, Lancaster’s
                    “ Colindian ” twisted oval bore, and Bland’s “ Eùôplia ” with “ invisible ”
                    undulating rifling. All these weapons fire heavy bullets more or less accurately
                    up to 100 yds., are also used as shot-guns, and are made double-or
                    single-barrelled and of various calibres, 12-bore being the most common. There
                    is also Greener’s “ under and over,” the rifle barrel being topmost (usually
                    16-bore shot-gun barrel and 450 rifle barrel). The Morris tube also enables a
                    shot-gun to be utilized as a small-bore rifle or a large rifle as a saloon rifle
                    for gallery practice. The automatic principle has not yet been applied to
                    sporting rifles.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Miniature Rifles.—</hi> In 1905 a War Office miniature or cadet
                    rifle for instruction purposes was officially adopted by the British military
                    authorities. The details of this rifle were determined by a committee, upon
                    which the National Rifle Association and the Society of Miniature Rifle Clubs
                    were represented. It is a single-loading bolt-action rifle of 22 calibre, with
                    military sights (the aperture sight being barred), shooting a rim-fire cartridge
                    having a 40-gr. bullet propelled by 5 grs. of black gunpowder or its equivalent
                    in some smokeless explosive. It is used at ranges from 25 yds. up to a maximum
                    of 200 yds. The official adoption of such a rifle was largely due to the
                    civilian rifle club movement, which was the outcome of the South African War,
                    and in which the Society of Miniature Rifle Clubs has played an important part.
                    Until the recent official adoption of the miniature rifle, the council of the
                    N.R.A. regarded marksmanship with the service rifle as its main object of
                    encouragement, and the service rifle itself as the orthodox weapon. The Society
                    of Miniature Rifle Clubs, on the other hand, makes the encouragement of the use
                    of low-power rifles its special object, with few restrictions as to type of
                    sights, rifle or ammunition. Numerous civilian rifle clubs have adopted the 22
                    calibre rifle, in many cases with aperture sights, with marked success, and
                    British rifle-makers were encouraged to cater for this new</p>
                <p>demand for low-power rifles. Such weapons can be far more widely and generally
                    used than the ordinary service weapon, owing to their smaller cost, cheaper
                    ammunition, absence of recoil, and their convenience for use at short covered
                    ranges in crowded centres of population. In many parts of Great Britain there is
                    practically no alternative between low-power short-range practice and no
                    shooting at all. The N.R.A. has now admitted the miniature *22 calibre rifle
                    upon equal terms with the service rifle. The miniature rifle has, to some
                    extent, taken the place of the Morris tube and “ adaptors ” previously used for
                    rifle practice at short ranges. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial" n="7"> In the military forces short-range practice now
                        takes two forms. —practice with Morris tube or miniature rifle, and practice
                        with the full-sized rifle and ammunition on specially protected 30-yd.
                        ranges. </note> The Morris, tube consists of a small-rifled barrel, usually
                    chambered for the 297/230-bore cartridge, and capable of being fitted inside the
                    barrel of the ordinary service weapon, which thus becomes available as a
                    miniature rifle for short-range practice. The Morris tube has been adopted by
                    the British War Ofike, and affords an excellent means of training the recruit. “
                    Adaptors ” are dummy cartridge-cases fitted into the breech of the ordinary
                    rifle, by means of which a shorter cartridge firing a lighter charge of powder,
                    but with a bullet of the same calibre as the rifle, can be used for short-range
                    practice. One of the first English miniature target rifles was the “
                    Sharpshooters’ Club ” rifle,, on the Martini principle, of -310 calibre,
                    manufactured and introduced by W. W. Greener, and suitable for ranges from 50 to
                    300 yds. This rifle was adopted by many rifle clubs, and in 1901 established a
                    record in the miniature rifle competition at Bisley. Miniature rifle shooting
                    has been much encouraged throughout the United Kingdom by the establishment of
                    tho Light Rifle Championship competition under the auspices of the Society of
                    Miniature Rifle Clubs. In 1907 Queen Alexandra, presented a cup for this event.
