All these rodents are remarkable for the manner in which the liver is divided into minute lobules. <hi rend="italic">Plagiodontia aedium,</hi>  another member of the group, is peculiar to Hayti. The. African cane-rats, <hi rend="italic">Thryonomys</hi>  (or <hi rend="italic">Aulacodus),</hi>  are large terrestrial rodents, ranging from the centre of the continent to the Cape, easily recognized by their deeply fluted incisors (see Coypu). The Octodontidae, which are exclusively South American, differ from the preceding, family by the tympanic bulla being filled with cellular bony tissue, and by the par-occipital process curving beneath it, while the cheek-teeth arc almost or completely rootless and composed of parallel plates. The first front toe may be absent. The more typical members of the family are rat-like burrowing rodents, living in communities. The typical genus is represented by the degu <hi rend="italic">(Octodcn degus)</hi>  and several nearly related species; other genera being <hi rend="italic">Ctenomys<hi rend="sub">i</hi>  Octodontomys (Neoctodon)<hi rend="sub">i</hi>  Aconaernys<hi rend="sub">i</hi>  Spalacopns</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">Abrocoma</hi>  the latter taking its name from its unusually soft fur. Among these, the tuco-tucos <hi rend="italic">(Ctenomys)</hi>  are characterized by their burrowing habits, almost rudimentary ears, small eyes, short tails and the kidneyshaped grinding-surfaces of their cheek-teeth. They take their name of tuco-tuco from their cry, which resembles the blows of a hammer on an anvil, and may be heard all day as the little rodents move, in their burrows, generally formed in sandy soil. In some districts the ground is undermined by these burrows, in which stores of food are accumulated. The species of <hi rend="italic">Octodon </hi>have larger ears, longer, tufted tails and the sides of the cheekteeth indented by plates of enamel; they are chiefly found in hedgerows and bushes, where they burrow. In <hi rend="italic">Abrocoma</hi>  the tail has no tuft, the ears are still larger and the lower cheek-teeth more complex than the upper ones. <hi rend="italic">Aconaemys</hi>  is an allied Chilean genus in which the enamel-folds meet across the molars. Several of these rodents live in the Andes, where the ground is. covered for months with snow. The second group of the family is formed by the genera <hi rend="italic">Loncheres<hi rend="sub">i</hi>  Dactylomys<hi rend="sub">i</hi>  Echilnolrnys<hi rend="sub">i</hi>  Proechimys</hi>  and a few others, the members of which are rat-like rodents, with long scaly or furry tails, and frequently flattened spines mingled with the fur of the back. Most species are brown above and whitish beneath, but in some the lighter tints extend on to the sides, shoulders and head, communicating a coloration somewhat like that of a guinea-pig (see Octodon). The North African gundis <hi rend="italic">(Ctenodactylus gundi </hi>and <hi rend="italic">Ct. vali)</hi>  are the types of an African family, which also includes the genera <hi rend="italic">Massoutiera<hi rend="sub">i</hi>  Pectinator</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">Petromys.</hi>  In the gundi the two inner toes of the hind-foot are furnished with a horny comb and bristles for the purpose of cleaning the fur, and the tail is very short ; but in <hi rend="italic">Pectinator</hi>  the tail is longer. <hi rend="italic">Petromys</hi>  has a still longer and more bushy tail, and no comb to the hind-feet. . The gundi is a diurnal species, inhabiting rocky districts, and having habits very similar to those of a jerboa. Of these <hi rend="italic">Ctenodactylus</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">Pectinator </hi>are characterized by the union of the incus and malleus of the internal ear, the free fibula and the almost rootless cheek-teeth. The premolar is very small, thus showing an approximation to the Myoidea, although in other respects <hi rend="italic">Petrornys</hi>  appears to approximate to the Hystricidae.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Picas and Hares.—</hi>The remaining rodents, which include two families—the picas (Ochotonidae) and the hares and. rabbits (Leporidae)—constitute a second sub-order, the Duplicidentata, differing from all the foregoing groups in possessing two pairs of incisors in the upper jaw (of which the second is small, and placed directly behind the large first pair), the enamel of which extends round to their postericr surfaces. At birth there are three pairs of incisors, but the outer one is soon lost. The incisive foramina are large and usually confluent; the bony palate is very narrow from before backwards; there is no alisphenoid canal; the fibula is welded to the tibia, and articulates with the calcanéum; and the testes are permanently external. All are terrestrial, and in many cases burrowing, in their, habits, and some of them are of extreme fleetness. The Ochotonidae are represented at the present day only by the single genus <hi rend="italic">Ochotona (Lagomys)<hi rend="sub">i</hi></hi>  which includes all the picas, or mouse-hares. They are small rodents with complete clavicles, fore- and hind-limbs of nearly equal length, no external tails and short ears. Skull depressed, frontals contracted and without post-orbital processes; <hi rend="italic">p.</hi>  } or j; molars rootless, with transverse enamel-folds, ln some cases the molar-formula is j. The genus includes about a score of species of guinea-pig-like animals, inhabiting chiefly the mountainous parts of Northern Asia (from 11,000 to 14,000 ft.), one species only being known from South-east Europe and several from the Rocky Mountains and Alaska.</p><p>From the picas the hares and rabbits (Leporidae) are distinguished by the imperfect clavicles, the more or less elongated hina-limbs, short recurved tail (absent in one case) and generally long ears. The skull is compressed, with large wing-shaped post-orbital</p><p>f&gt;rocesses (fig. 16); <hi rend="italic">p. §. </hi>With the exception of Australasia, the amily has a cosmopolitan distribution; and its numerous species resemble one another more or less closely in general external characters. In all the fore-limbs have five and the hind four digits; and the soles of the feet are densely clothed with hairs similar to those</p><p>covering the</p><p>legs; the inner</p><p>surface of the</p><p>checks being</p><p>hairy. Although the family has such a wide distribution, the greater number of the species are restricted to Europe, northern and central Asia and North America ;</p><p>South America having very few.</p><p>Till within the last few years the majority of naturalists followed the practice of including</p><p>all the members of the family in the genus <hi rend="italic">Lepus.</hi>  It is true that Mr E. Blyth long ago. proposed the name <hi rend="italic">Caprolagus </hi>for the remarkable spiny rabbit 01 the western Himalayas, while the generic name <hi rend="italic">Oryctolagus</hi>  was suggested later for the rabbit, and <hi rend="italic">Sylvilagus</hi>  for the American “ cotton-tails ” ; but none of these was accorded general acceptation. Of late years, however, zoologists have come to the conclusion that generic subdivisions of the Leporidae are advisable. In 1899 Dr Fcrsyth Major proposed a classification of the family in which a number of species were grouped with the spiny rabbit in the genus <hi rend="italic">Capro-Iagus<hi rend="sub">i</hi></hi>  whilst <hi rend="italic">Oryctolagus</hi>  was taken to include not only the common rabbit, but likewise the Cape hare. A more recent classification is that of Mr M. W. Lyon, in which by far the largest number of species of the family are retained in the original genus <hi rend="italic">Lepus<hi rend="sub">i</hi></hi>  which has also the widest geographical distribution of all the genera. It is typified by the blue hare <hi rend="italic">(Lepus timidus),</hi>  next to which comes the common hare <hi rend="italic">(L. europaeus)</hi>  and certain other allied forms. The jackass-hares of Mexico, &amp;c., such as <hi rend="italic">L. Californicus<hi rend="sub">i</hi></hi>  fcrm a second sub-group ; while these are in turn followed by the American hare <hi rend="italic">(L. americanus)</hi>  and its immediate relatives. The cottontails, or w<hi rend="sup">T</hi>ood-rabbits, of North and South America are regarded as forming a genus,<hi rend="italic">Sylvilagus<hi rend="sub">i</hi></hi>  by themselves, which includes the Brazilian and Paraguay hares, and appears to be chiefly distinguished by a certain feature in the parietal region of the skull. Under the name of <hi rend="italic">Oryctolagus Cuniculus<hi rend="sub">i</hi></hi>  the rabbit is considered to represent a genus by itself, specially characterized by the shortness of the ears and hind-feet. The swamp-rabbit <hi rend="italic">(L. palustris) </hi>and water-hare <hi rend="italic">(L. aquaticus)</hi>  of. the southern United States form the group <hi rend="italic">Limnotragus<hi rend="sub">i</hi></hi>  characterized by the harsher fur, the shorter ears, tail and hind-feet, and the complete fusion of the post-orbital process (which is so distinct in the typical hares) with the adjacent parts of the skull, so that neither notches nor. perforations are developed in this region. The short-tailed rabbit of the western United States <hi rend="italic">(Brachylagus idahoensis)</hi>  is the sole member of a group allied in general characters to the typical <hi rend="italic">Lepus<hi rend="sub">i</hi></hi>  but distinguished by the unusually short tail. Another group is <hi rend="italic">Prono-Iagus<hi rend="sub">i</hi></hi>  typified by. the. Cape thick-tailed hare, the so-called <hi rend="italic">Lepus Crassicaudatus<hi rend="sub">i</hi></hi>  which is externally similar to <hi rend="italic">Lcpus</hi>  proper, but has the skull and teeth of the general t&gt; pe of the next group. The tailless rabbit of Mount Popocatepetl, Mexico, originally described as a distinct generic type, under the name of <hi rend="italic">Romerolagus Uelsoni<hi rend="sub">i </hi></hi>is broadly distinguished by the entire absence of the tail, and the short ears and hind-feet, its general fcrm being like that of the Liu-Kiu rabbit, while, as in the latter, the post-orbital process of the skull is small, and represented only by the hinder half. Next come three remarkable rabbits from the Indo-Malay countries, all closely allied, although regarded as representing three generic groups, <hi rend="italic">Nesolagus<hi rend="sub">i</hi>  Caprolagus</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">Pentalagus.</hi>  In all three the skull is of the type 01 <hi rend="italic">Romerolagus.</hi>  The first is represented by the Sumatran rabbit, the so-called JV. <hi rend="italic">netscheri,</hi>  whicn apparently differs from the spiny rabbit mainly by the pattern of the cheekteeth. The spiny rabbit, separated from <hi rend="italic">Lepus</hi>  by Blyth in 1845 under the name of <hi rend="italic">Caprolagus hispidus,</hi>  is an inhabitant of Assam and the adjacent districts, and distinguished by its.harsh, bristly fur and short ears and tail. In the Liu-Kiu rabbit <hi rend="italic">(Pentalagus furnessi)</hi>  the coat is equally harsh, but the cars and hind-feet are shorter, and there arc only five (in place of the usual six) pairs of upper cheek-teeth. In the loss of the last upper molar, the.Liu-Kiu rabbit approximates to the picas, as does the tailless rabbit in the abortion of its caudal appendage. Mr.Lyon’s scheme seems to be the best attempt to explain the affinities of the members cf the gjoup. Whether all his genera be adopted, or.all. the species, be included in <hi rend="italic">Lepus<hi rend="sub">i</hi></hi>  must largely be a matter of individual opinion.</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
