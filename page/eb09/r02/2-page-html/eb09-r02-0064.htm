<p><span class="font1">a portrait painter in St Martin’s Lane, London, whence he afterwards removed to Great Newport Street, and&nbsp;finally, in 1760, to Leicester Square, where he continued&nbsp;to paint till his death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">His first reception on his return was hardly a favourable one. Hudson called to see his productions and told&nbsp;him, “ Reynolds, you don’t paint so well as when you&nbsp;left England.” Ellis, another accepted portrait painter&nbsp;of the time, who had studied under Kneller, exclaimed,&nbsp;“ This will never answer. Why, you don’t paint in the&nbsp;least like Sir Godfrey,”—adding, as he abruptly left the&nbsp;room, “ Shakespeare in poetry, Kneller in painting.” The&nbsp;verdict of the public, however, was all on the side of the&nbsp;young innovator. Lord Edgcumbe played the part of&nbsp;the generous patron, and exerted himself to obtain commissions for his protégé, of whose ability the portraits&nbsp;which he now produced—of the duchess of Hamilton,&nbsp;the countess of Coventry, Lord Holderness, and especially&nbsp;of his old friend Keppel—were sufficient guarantee. The&nbsp;artist’s painting-room was thronged with the wealth and&nbsp;fashion of London, “ with women who wished to be transmitted as angels, and with men who wished to appear as&nbsp;heroes and philosophers ” ; and he was already afloat upon&nbsp;that tide of prosperity which never ebbed till the day of&nbsp;his death. Various other artists contested with him for&nbsp;popular applause. First the Swiss Liotard had his&nbsp;moment of popularity ; and at a later period there was&nbsp;Opie, and the more formidable and sustained rivalry of&nbsp;Gainsborough and of Romney ; but in the midst of all,&nbsp;then as now, Reynolds maintained an admitted supremacy.&nbsp;And, if the magic of his brush brought him crowds of&nbsp;sitters, his charm qî manner gathered round him numerous&nbsp;friends. During the first year of his residence in London&nbsp;he had made the acquaintance of Dr Johnson, which,&nbsp;diverse as the two men were, became a friendship for life.&nbsp;To him Burke and Goldsmith, Garrick, Sterne, Bishop&nbsp;Percy, and, it seems, Hogarth, were before long added.&nbsp;At the hospitable dinner table of Reynolds such distinguished men enjoyed the freest and most unconstrained&nbsp;companionship, and most of them were members of the&nbsp;“Literary Club,” established, at the painter’s suggestion,&nbsp;in 1764.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In 1760 the London world of art was greatly interested by the novel proposal of the Society of Artists to exhibit&nbsp;their works to the public. The hall of the society was at&nbsp;their disposal for the purpose ; and in the month of April&nbsp;an exceedingly successful exhibition was opened, the precursor of many that followed. To this display Reynolds&nbsp;contributed four portraits. In 1765 the association&nbsp;obtained a royal charter, and became known as “ The&nbsp;Incorporated Society of Artists”; but much rivalry and&nbsp;jealousy was occasioned by the management of the various&nbsp;exhibitions, and an influential body of painters withdrew&nbsp;from the society, and proceeded to consider the steps that&nbsp;should be taken in order that their corporate existence&nbsp;might be recognized. They had access to the young king,&nbsp;George III., who promised his patronage and help. In&nbsp;December 1768 the Royal Academy was founded, and&nbsp;Reynolds was elected, by acclamation, its first president,&nbsp;an honour which more than compensated for his failure to&nbsp;obtain the appointment of king’s painter, which, the previous year, had been bestowed on Allan Ramsay, a more&nbsp;courtly but more commonplace artist. In a few months&nbsp;the king signified his approval of the election by knighting&nbsp;the new president, and intimating that the queen and&nbsp;himself would honour him with sittings for portraits to be&nbsp;presented to the Academy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Reynolds was fitted for his neλv position no less by his urbane and courteous manner and by his wide general&nbsp;culture than by his eminence as an artist. With unwearied&nbsp;assiduity, with unfailing tact, he devoted himself to&nbsp;furthering the interests of the new Academy. It was at&nbsp;his suggestion that the annual banquet was instituted.&nbsp;To the specified duties of his post he added the delivery&nbsp;of a presidential address at the distribution of the prizes,&nbsp;and his speeches on these occasions form the well-known&nbsp;“discourses” of Sir Joshua. Expressed as they are&nbsp;with simple elegance and perspicuous directness, these&nbsp;discourses alone would be sufficient to entitle their author&nbsp;to literary distinction ; indeed, when they were first&nbsp;delivered, it was thought impossible that they could be&nbsp;the production of a painter, and Johnson and Burke have&nbsp;been credited with their composition, in spite of the&nbsp;specific denials of both, and of Dr Johnson’s indignant&nbsp;exclamation—“ Sir Joshua, sir, would as soon get me to&nbsp;paint for him as to write for him ! ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the unwearied pursuit of his art, and in the calm enjoyment of his varied friendships, Sir Joshua’s life&nbsp;flowed on peacefully and happily enough. He was too&nbsp;prosperous and successful an artist altogether to escape&nbsp;the jealousy of his less fortunate and less capable brethren,&nbsp;and he suffered in this way sometimes, especially from&nbsp;the attacks of Barry, a painter who lived long enough&nbsp;to regret and, so far as he was able, to rectify his&nbsp;fault. In 1784, on the death of Ramsay, Reynolds was&nbsp;appointed painter to the king. Two years previously he&nbsp;had suffered from a paralytic attack ; but, after a month&nbsp;of rest, he was able to resume his painting with unabated&nbsp;energy and power. In the summer of 1789 his sight&nbsp;began to fail ; he was affected by the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gutta serena,</span><span class="font1"> but the&nbsp;progress of the malady was gradual, and he continued&nbsp;occasionally to practise his art till about the end of 1790.&nbsp;His last years were embittered by a most unfortunate&nbsp;disagreement with the Royal Academy, relative to the&nbsp;appointment of a professor of perspective. Under the&nbsp;impression that there was a conspiracy against him among&nbsp;the various members, he signified his intention of leaving&nbsp;the presidential chair, a resignation which he was afterwards induced to withdraw, and his final discourse was&nbsp;delivered on the 10th December 1790. He was still able&nbsp;to enjoy the companionship of his friends, and he exerted&nbsp;himself in an effort to raise funds for the erection of a&nbsp;monument in St Paul’s to Dr Johnson, who had died in&nbsp;1784. Towards the end of 1791 it was evident to the&nbsp;friends of Reynolds that he was gradually sinking. For a&nbsp;few months he suffered from extreme depression of spirits,&nbsp;the result of a severe form of liver complaint, and on the&nbsp;23d February 1792 this great artist and blameless gentleman passed peacefully away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Reynolds’s first discourse deals with the establishment of an academy for the fine arts, and of its value as being a repository&nbsp;of the traditions of the best of bygone practice, of “ the principles&nbsp;which many artists have spent their lives in ascertaining. ” In the&nbsp;second lecture the study of the painter is divided into three stages,&nbsp;—in the first of which he is busied with processes and technicalities,&nbsp;with the grammar of art, while in the second he examines what&nbsp;has been done by other artists, and in the last compares these&nbsp;results with nature herself. In the third discourse Reynolds treats&nbsp;of “the great and leading principles of the grand style”; and&nbsp;succeeding addresses are devoted to such subjects as “Moderation,”&nbsp;“Taste,” “Genius,” and “Sculpture.” The fourteenth has an&nbsp;especial interest as containing an appreciative but discriminating&nbsp;notice of Gainsborough, who had died shortly before its delivery ;&nbsp;while the concluding discourse is mainly occupied with a panegyric&nbsp;on Michelangelo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The other literary works of the president comprise his three essays in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Idler</span><span class="font0"> for 1759-G0 (“ On the Grand Style in Painting,”&nbsp;and “ On the True Idea of Beauty ”), his notes to Du Fresnoy’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Art&nbsp;of Painting,</span><span class="font0"> his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Remarks on the Art of the Low Countries,</span><span class="font0"> his&nbsp;brief notes in Johnson’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Shakespeare,</span><span class="font0"> and two singularly witty and&nbsp;brilliant fragments, imaginary conversations with Johnson, which&nbsp;were never intended by their author for publication, but, found&nbsp;among his papers after his death, were given to the world by his&nbsp;niece, the marchioness of Thomond.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But the literary works of Reynolds, excellent as these arc, were</span></p>
