        <p><span class="font1">delta in front of an outlet is proportionate to the size of the
                channel, and the length of the jetties required for lowering the bar by
                scour&nbsp;in front of any channel is proportionate to the discharge of
                the&nbsp;channel. Consequently, the conditions arc more unfavourable for&nbsp;the
                improvement of the outlets of the larger delta channels than&nbsp;of the smaller
                ones; though, on the other hand, the larger channels&nbsp;crossing the delta are
                generally more suitable for navigation on&nbsp;account of their size, and the
                natural depth-over their bars is greater&nbsp;owing to the larger
            discharge.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The discharge of the main branch of the Rhone, which formerly flowed
                into the Mediterranean and the Gulf of Foz through six&nbsp;mouths, was in 1852-57
                concentrated in the direct eastern&nbsp;channel by embankments along sides, which
                closed all the</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Iateral channels. The entire flow of the river, being thus discharged
                through the eastern outlets, increased for a time the depth over its bar&nbsp;from
                4i ft. to 9J ft.; but as the great volume of alluvium brought&nbsp;down, including
                an unusually large proportion of sand rolled along the&nbsp;bed of the river, was
                also all discharged through the one outlet, the&nbsp;bar soon formed again farther
                out, and naturally advanced with&nbsp;the delta in front of the outlet more rapidly
                than formerly when the&nbsp;deposit was distributed through six divergent mouths.
                Accordingly,&nbsp;the very moderate deepening produced by the embankments
                was&nbsp;not long maintained, and the average depth over the bar has
                not&nbsp;exceeded 6J ft. for many years past; the St Lpuis Canal was constructed to
                provide a deeper outlet for the navigation.@@<sup>1</sup> This want&nbsp;of success
                was due to the selection of an outlet opening on a sheltered,&nbsp;somewhat shallow
                bay, instead of a southern outlet discharging into&nbsp;deep water in the
                Mediterranean and having a deep littoral current&nbsp;flowing across it, and also
                resulted from the closing of all the other&nbsp;outlets, whereby the whole of the
                deposit, as well as all the discharge,&nbsp;was concentrated in front of the badly
                situated eastern outlet.&nbsp;The southern Roustan branch was reopened in 1893 to
                prevent the&nbsp;silting-up of the outlet of the St Louis Canal.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The Danube traverses its delta in three branches, the northern one of
                which, though conveying nearly two-thirds of the discharge&nbsp;of the river, is
                unsuitable for improvement owing to its&nbsp;splitting up along portions of its
                course into several&nbsp;channels, and eventually flowing into the sea through
                twelve&nbsp;mouths of a small independent delta advancing about 250 ft.
                annually&nbsp;across a shallow foreshore. The central Sulina branch was
                selected&nbsp;for improvement in 1858 in preference to the southern St
                George’s&nbsp;branch, which had a more favourably situated outlet and a
                better&nbsp;channel through the delta, on account of the much
                Smallerexpenditure&nbsp;required for carrying out jetties to the bar in front of the
                Sulina&nbsp;outlet, which was only half the distance from the shore of the
                bar&nbsp;of the St George’s outlet, owing to the much smaller discharge of&nbsp;the
                Sulina branch.@@<sup>2</sup> The jetties, begun provisionally in 1858
                and&nbsp;subsequently consolidated and somewhat extended, were
                finally&nbsp;completed in 1877. They increased the depth over the bar from&nbsp;an
                average of about 9 ft. previously to 1858 up to 2o| ft. in 1873,&nbsp;which was
                maintained for many years. In 1893, however, the&nbsp;increasing draught of vessels
                rendered a greater depth necessary;&nbsp;the wide inshore portion of the jetty
                channel was therefore narrowed&nbsp;by inner parallel jetties, and a powerful
                dredger was set to work in&nbsp;the jetty channel and outside, whereby the depth was
                increased to&nbsp;24 ft. in 1897, and was fairly maintained up to 1907, when a
                second&nbsp;dredger became necessary to cope with the shoaling. The
                somewhat&nbsp;small ratio of sediment to discharge in the Danube, the fineness of
                the&nbsp;greater portion of this sediment, its comparatively moderate
                amount&nbsp;owing to the small proportion of. the discharge flowing through
                the&nbsp;Sulina branch, and its partial dispersion by the southerly,
                littoral&nbsp;current and wave action, have prevented the rapid formation of
                a&nbsp;shoal in front of the Sulina outlet. Nevertheless, the lines of soundings are
                gradually advancing seawards in the line of the outlet&nbsp;channel, and there are
                signs of the formation of a new bar farther&nbsp;out, whilst the deposit to the
                south by the current and waves has&nbsp;deflected the deepest channel northwards.
                Accordingly, a prolongation of the jetties will eventually be necessary,
                notwithstanding&nbsp;the removal of a portion of the deposit from the outlet
                channel</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">by dredging..</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The selection of the outlet of the south pass of the Mississippi
                delta for improvement by parallel jetties in 1876-79, in spite of
                the&nbsp;south-west pass possessing a larger channel and a better&nbsp;depth over
                its bar, was due, as at the Danube, to motives&nbsp;of economy, as the bar of the
                south-west pass was twice as&nbsp;far off from the shore as that of the south pass
                (fig. 13). There fascine&nbsp;mattress jetties, weighted with limestone, and with
                large concrete&nbsp;blocks at their exposed ends (see Jetty), </span><span
                class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">2$</span><span class="font1"> and ii m.
                long, and&nbsp;curved slightly southwards at their outer ends to direct the
                sediment-bearing current more directly at right angles to the westerly&nbsp;littoral
                current, increased the depth of 8 ft. over the bar in 1875&nbsp;up to 31 ft. between
                the jetties and out to deep water (fig. 14).&nbsp;The prolonged current of the river
                produced by the jetties has, as&nbsp;at the Sulina outlet, carried the main portion
                of the heavier sediment into fairly deep water, so that the greatest advance of
                the&nbsp;foreshore in front of the south pass has occurred in the 70-ft.
                line&nbsp;of soundings, though the shallower soundings have also
            advanced.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The shoaling, however, in the jetty channel necessitated its
                reduction in width by mattresses and spurs from 1000 ft. to 600 ft., and
                also&nbsp;dredging to maintain the stipulated central depth of 30 ft., and 26
                ft&nbsp;depth for a width of 200 ft., out to deep water; whilst the
                outer&nbsp;channel was deflected to the east and narrowed by the
                alluvium&nbsp;carried westwards by the littoral current and also deposited in
                front&nbsp;of the jetty outlet. Accordingly, dredging has been
                increasingly&nbsp;needed to straighten the channel outsioe and maintain its
                depth&nbsp;and width ; and since the United States engineers took in hand
                its&nbsp;maintenance in 1901, the available depth of the outlet channel
                has&nbsp;been increased from 26 ft. up to 28 ft. by extensive suction
                dredging.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">In order to provide for the increasing requirements of sea-going
                vessels, the dredging of a channel 35 ft. deep and 1000 ft. wide,&nbsp;cut from the
                large south-west pass outlet to deep water in the gulf,&nbsp;was begun.at the end of
                1903; and jetties of fascine mattresses&nbsp;weighted with stone.and concrete blocks
                have been carried out about&nbsp;4 and 3 m.. respectively from the shore on each
                side of the outlet&nbsp;for maintaining the dredged channel @@3 (fig. 15). These
                works differ</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">from the prior improvement of the south pass in the adoption mainly
                of suction dredging for the formation of the channel in place of&nbsp;scour alone,
                so that it will be unnecessary to restrict the width of&nbsp;the jetty channel to
                secure the desired depth ; whilst as the discharge through the south-west pass is
                rather more than three times&nbsp;the discharge through the south pass,, and the bar
                is double the&nbsp;distance seawards of the outlet, the slightly converging jetties,
                in&nbsp;continuation of the south-west pass, are placed about 3400 ft.&nbsp;apart at
                their outer ends, and have been given about twice the&nbsp;length of the south pass
                jetties. As soon as the dredging of the&nbsp;channel has been completed (which
                depends on the appropriations&nbsp;granted by Congress) the south pass will be
                abandoned, and the&nbsp;south-west pass will form the navigable approach. Dredging
                will&nbsp;be required for preserving the depth of the outlet of the
                south-west&nbsp;pass; and when the large volume of sand and other alluvium
                discharged by the pass accumulates in front sufficiently to begin forming&nbsp;a bar
                farther out, an extension of the jetties will be necessary to&nbsp;maintain the
                elongated channel free from drift, and extend the&nbsp;scour, especially in
                flood-time.</span></p>

                >of </span><span class="font1">tideless rivers depends wholly on their fresh-water
                discharge, the condition of tidal rivers is due to the&nbsp;configuration of their
                outlet, the rise of tide at their mouth, the&nbsp;distance the tide can penetrate
                inland, and the space available&nbsp;for its reception. Accordingly, tidal rivers
                sometimes, even&nbsp;when possessing a comparatively small fresh-water
                discharge,&nbsp;develop under favourable conditions into large rivers in

                Tidal water&nbsp;is, indeed, unlimited in volume; but, unlike the
