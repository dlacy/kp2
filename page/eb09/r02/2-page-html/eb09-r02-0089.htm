<p><span class="font2">Fort de l’Écluse. About 5 j miles farther down occurs the famous Perte du Rhône, a’partially subterranean passage,&nbsp;now considerably modified by blasting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“ The rocks forming the funnel come so close at one. place that there is only a distance of about two feet from bank to bank, and a&nbsp;man of moderate height could stand with one foot on the French&nbsp;side and the other on the Savoy side and see between the beautiful&nbsp;river trembling as it were with rage and hastening to escape from&nbsp;the defile through which it is doomed to pass. A little way farther&nbsp;down the river lias hollowed out a passage about 30 feet wide, which&nbsp;retains this width for a depth of from 30 to 35 feet, when it contracts considerably. At this depth a stratum of harder rock has&nbsp;resisted the action of the water, which, however, has scooped out&nbsp;beneath it almost as much as above it. Along each side of the&nbsp;ravine the harder rock projects for eight or ten feet like a cornice.&nbsp;At first the water is seen through the opening down the middle ;&nbsp;but farther on great masses of rock from the walls of the ravine&nbsp;have fallen down, and, resting on the double cornice, conceal the&nbsp;river for a distance of some 60 paces.”@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During the summer floods the water filled the ravine far above the level of the fallen blocks, and the Perte&nbsp;du Rhône was no longer visible.</span><span class="font1">@@</span><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> The rocks through&nbsp;which the “ perte ” is cut belong to the Urgonian subdivision of the Cretaceous system,—the stratum which has&nbsp;been hollowed out being described as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">calcaire gris.</span><span class="font2"> Just&nbsp;below the ravine the Rhone is joined by the Valserine,&nbsp;which a little above Bellegarde passes through a “ perte ”&nbsp;of a similar character. Since 1871 the motive power of&nbsp;the main river has been utilized for the industries of Belle-garde ; a large tunnel 20 feet high and more than half a&nbsp;kilometre long brings the water from the south side of the&nbsp;perte to turbine wheels placed in the bed of the Valserine,&nbsp;and wire ropes transmit the power to the Bellegarde&nbsp;workshops on the plateau 400 feet above.</span><span class="font1">@@</span><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup> Below Belle-garde the river is deflected southwards by the western&nbsp;chain of the Jura. It receives from the left the Usses,&nbsp;the Fiar (which drains the lake of Annecy), and the&nbsp;emissary of the Lake of Bourget, the largest of the purely&nbsp;French lakes, and then at the junction of the Guiers (from&nbsp;the Grande Chartreuse) it turns north-west round the&nbsp;southern end of the Jura. The Ain (118 miles long),&nbsp;which joins it from the right, is navigable in the direction&nbsp;of the current, and in its upper waters has a “ perte ” of&nbsp;some interest. Farther down the main river meanders&nbsp;for a time with shifting channels in a bed about two&nbsp;miles broad, but it gathers into a single stream before&nbsp;its junction with the Saône. This important confluent&nbsp;(the ancient Arar, which according to Cæsar flows&nbsp;“ incredibili lenitate ”) has its source at Vioménil in the&nbsp;Vosges 1300 feet above the sea, and has been joined by&nbsp;the Doubs, which, rising in the district between the Jura&nbsp;and the Vosges, is famous for the beauty of its upper&nbsp;gorges and for the waterfall (70 feet) known as the Saut&nbsp;du Doubs.</span><span class="font1">@@</span><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup> Southwards from Lyons, where it is 530 feet&nbsp;above the sea, the united river continues to be still the&nbsp;“arrowy Rhone”; in the 61 miles from the Saône&nbsp;mouth to the Isére it falls 180 feet, in the 18 from the&nbsp;Isére to the Drome 56 feet, in the 38 from the Drome to&nbsp;the Ardèche 164, and in the 34 from the Ardèche to the&nbsp;Durance 88£. Those affluents, all except the last from&nbsp;the Savoy and Maritime Alps, are in general of little&nbsp;importance, but at times become formidable torrents.&nbsp;The same is true of the much shorter streams which bring&nbsp;down the waters from the eastern slopes of the Cevennes.&nbsp;During the inundation of the 10th September 1857, which&nbsp;has been frequently exceeded, the three streams the Doux,&nbsp;the Érieux, and the Ardèche poured into the Rhone&nbsp;49,000 cubic feet per second. At Fourques d’Arles, 25&nbsp;miles from the sea, the river begins to form its delta,&nbsp;breaking up into two main branches, the Grand Rhone&nbsp;passing from Arles south-east towards the Gulf of Fos,&nbsp;and the Petit Rhone south-west towards the Little Camargue. With all its rapidity of current and mass of waters&nbsp;it is not able to keep a clear passage to the sea through&nbsp;its own alluvium, which, according to M. Reclus’s estimate,&nbsp;has since the Gallo-Roman period added from 75 to 100&nbsp;square miles to the area of its delta.</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;">

<p><span class="font1">From the time that Marius caused his soldiers to excavate the Fossæ Marianæ which have left the name of Fos to the bay already&nbsp;mentioned the endeavour to maintain a navigable channel inland&nbsp;from the sea has perplexed successive generations. Vauban&nbsp;himself declared “ Les embouchures du Rhône sont incorrigibles.”&nbsp;The method of contracting and embanking a principal channel&nbsp;right out to sea failed, either because the embankments were&nbsp;not carried out far enough, or more probably because the tides&nbsp;of the Mediterranean are not sufficiently strong to aid in removing&nbsp;the alluvium. A canal constructed in 1802-1832 from Arles&nbsp;to Bouc (on the east side of the Gulf of Fos) proved too shallow&nbsp;for the new steam traffic. At length in 1863 a scheme brought&nbsp;forward by Hippolyte Peut in 1846 was adopted for the making&nbsp;of a canal, 11,480 feet long, 210 feet wide and 19⅜ feet deep&nbsp;at low tide, from Tour St Louis on the left bank of the Grand&nbsp;Rhone to the Anse de Repos in the Gulf of Fos. The canal was&nbsp;completed in 1871, and the quays of the port of St Louis by the&nbsp;close of 1878, at a cost of 26,000,000 francs. Hostile critics maintain that it will be possible to keep this channel open at the&nbsp;seaward end only by continual and costly dredging, but hitherto&nbsp;their fears seem exaggerated. The new port has been very successful, 1261 vessels (313,745 tons) entering in 1881 and 2317 vessels&nbsp;(448,757 tons) in 1882. The regulation of the river itself is still&nbsp;a problem. The rapidity of the current from Lyons downwards,&nbsp;the extremely shifting character of the channel, and the variations that take place in the volume of water are the great obstacles&nbsp;to be overcome. Two months of the year are lost for navigation&nbsp;through floods or lack of water or fogs or ice. At present (1885)&nbsp;a scheme combining the two systems of regularization and canalization is being carried out for the purpose of securing everywhere&nbsp;at low water a depth of 5 feet 3 inches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the beginning of the present century even passenger boats used to be hauled up the river by towing ropes, and when steam&nbsp;was introduced it was found that the vessels had to be specially&nbsp;constructed to make head against the current. The laying of a&nbsp;continuous chain all the way from Lyons to Arles is impracticable&nbsp;through the shifting character of the bed ; but several methods&nbsp;have been adopted to overcome the difficulties of the ascent. Thus&nbsp;some boats advance by means of long jointed levers which catch&nbsp;into the ground. Or a steel wire cable with one of its ends fixed at&nbsp;a given spot is unwound as a steam tug descends the stream and&nbsp;then the tug with its convoy of boats makes its way up again by&nbsp;simply winding in. Or two tugs are employed, the first going in&nbsp;advance of the other so far that the cable which it pays out takes&nbsp;a sufficient hold of the bottom to enable the second to haul by it.&nbsp;Or, lastly, Dupuy de Lome’s system is adopted, by which the&nbsp;boat grips the river bottom by means of two continuous chains&nbsp;perpetually sunk in front and emerging behind. The Saône is&nbsp;much more easily dealt with than the Rhone. It is navigable as&nbsp;far up as Port-sur-Saône, and a system of movable dams and sluices&nbsp;has been established to secure a depth of 6 to 7 feet at low water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The basin of the Rhone communicates with the Loire by the Canal du Centre (joining the Saône at Chalons), with the Seine by the&nbsp;Burgundy Canal (joining the Saône at St Jean de Losne), with the&nbsp;Rhine by a canal (1783-1834) which passes from the Saône at Saint&nbsp;Symphorien to the Doubs, and finally ends at Strasburg, and with&nbsp;the Meuse and the Belgian system by a canal (Canal de ΓEst)&nbsp;constructed since 1875 from the Saône to the Moselle.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">RHÔNE, a department of south-eastern France, deriving its name from the great river on which Lyons, its chief town, is situated, was formed in 1793 from the eastern portion of the department Rhône-et-Loire, comprising parts of&nbsp;Lyonnais and Beaujolais. It is bounded on the N. by&nbsp;Saône-et-Loire, on the E. by Ain and by Isère, on the S.&nbsp;and W. by Loire, and lies between 45° 27' and 46° 18'&nbsp;N. lat. and 4° 15' and 4° 53' E. long.
