        <p><span class="font1">had already (191) crossed the Ægean, and in concert with the fleets
                of Pergamum and Rhodes worsted the navy&nbsp;of Antiochus. In 190 the new consul L.
                Scipio, accompanied by his famous brother, the conqueror of Africa, led&nbsp;the
                Roman legions for the first time into Asia. At&nbsp;Magnesia, near Mount Sipylus in
                Lydia, he met and&nbsp;defeated the motley aιid ill-disciplined hosts of the
                    great&nbsp;king.@@<sup>1</sup> For the first time the West, under Roman
                leadership, successfully encountered the forces of the East, and&nbsp;the struggle
                began which lasted far on into the days of&nbsp;the emperors. The terms of the peace
                which followed&nbsp;the victory at Magnesia tell their own story
                clearly&nbsp;enough. There is no question, any more than in Greece,&nbsp;of
                annexation ; the main object in view is that of securing the predominance of Roman
                interests and influence&nbsp;throughout the peninsula of Asia Minor, and removing
                to&nbsp;a safe distance the only Eastern power which could be&nbsp;considered
                    dangerous.@@<sup>2</sup> The line of the Halys and the&nbsp;Taurus range, the
                natural boundary of the peninsula eastward, was established as the boundary between
                Antiochus&nbsp;and the kingdoms, cities, and peoples now enrolled as the&nbsp;allies
                and friends of Rome. This line Antiochus was forbidden to cross ; nor was he to send
                ships of war farther&nbsp;west than Cape Sarpedon in Cilicia. Immediately to
                the&nbsp;west of this frontier lay the small states of Bithynia and&nbsp;Paphlagonia
                and the immigrant Celtic Galatæ, and these&nbsp;frontier states, now the allies of
                Rome, served as a second&nbsp;line of defence against attacks from the east. The
                area&nbsp;lying between these “ buffer states ” and the Ægean was&nbsp;organized by
                Rome in such a way as should at once reward&nbsp;the fidelity of her allies and
                secure both her own paramount&nbsp;authority and safety from foreign attack.
                Pergamum and&nbsp;Rhodes were so strengthened—the former by the gift of&nbsp;the
                Chersonese, Lycaonia, Phrygia, Mysia, and Lydia, the&nbsp;latter by that of Lycia
                and Caria—as not only amply to&nbsp;reward their loyalty, but to constitute them
                effective props&nbsp;of Roman interests and effective barriers alike
                against&nbsp;Thracian and Celtic raids in the north and against aggression by Syria
                in the south. Lastly, the Greek cities on the&nbsp;coast, except those already
                tributary to Pergamum, were&nbsp;declared free, and established as independent
                allies of Rome.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">In a space of little over eleven years (200-189) Rome had broken the
                power of Alexander’s successors and&nbsp;established throughout the eastern
                Mediterranean a Roman&nbsp;protectorate. It remained to be seen whether this
                protectorate could be maintained, or whether Rome would be&nbsp;driven to that
                policy of annexation which she had adopted&nbsp;from the first in Sicily and
                Spain.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">It was in the western half of the protectorate in European Greece
                that the first steps in the direction of annexation were taken. The enthusiasm
                provoked by the liberation of the Greeks had died away, and its place had been taken
                by feelings of dissatisfied ambition or sullen resentment. Internecine feuds and
                economic distress had&nbsp;brought many parts of Greece to the verge of
                anarchy,&nbsp;and, above all, the very foundations of the settlement&nbsp;effected
                in 197 were threatened by the reviving power and&nbsp;aspirations of Macedon.
                Loyally as Philip had aided&nbsp;Rome in the war with Antiochus, the peace of
                Magnesia&nbsp;brought him nothing but fresh humiliation. He was&nbsp;forced to
                abandon all hopes of recovering Thessaly, and he&nbsp;had the mortification to see
                the hated king of Pergamum&nbsp;installed almost on his borders as master of the
                Thracian&nbsp;Chersonese. Resistance at the time was unavailing, but&nbsp;from 189
                until his death (179) he laboured patiently and&nbsp;quietly to increase the
                internal resources of his own kingdom,@@<sup>3</sup> and to foment, by dexterous
                intrigue, feelings of</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">hostility to Rome among his Greek and barbarian neighbours. His
                successor, Perseus, his son by a left-handed alliance, continued his father’s work.
                He made friends&nbsp;among the Illyrian and Thracian princes, connected himself by
                marriage with Antiochus IV. of Syria and with&nbsp;Prusias of Bithynia, and, among
                the Greek peoples, strove,&nbsp;not without success, to revive the memories of the
                past&nbsp;glories of Greece under the Macedonian leadership of the&nbsp;great
                    Alexander.@@<sup>4</sup> The senate could no longer hesitate.&nbsp;They were
                well aware of the restlessness and discontent in&nbsp;Greece ; and after hearing
                from Eumenes of Pergamum,&nbsp;and from their own officers, all details of Perseus’s
                intrigues&nbsp;and preparations they declared war.@@<sup>5</sup> The struggle,
                in&nbsp;spite of Perseus’s courage and the incapacity at the outset&nbsp;of the
                Roman commanders, was short and decisive. The&nbsp;sympathy of the Greeks with
                Perseus, which had been&nbsp;encouraged by the hitherto passive attitude assumed
                by&nbsp;Rome, instantly evaporated on the news that the Roman&nbsp;legions were on
                their way to Greece. No assistance came&nbsp;from Prusias or Antiochus, and
                Perseus’s only allies were&nbsp;the Thracian king Cotys and the Illyrian Genthius.
                The&nbsp;victory gained by L. Æmilius Paulus at Pydna (168)&nbsp;ended the
                    war.@@<sup>6</sup> Perseus became the prisoner of Rome,&nbsp;and as such died in
                Italy a few years later.@@<sup>7</sup> Rome had&nbsp;begun the war with the fixed
                resolution no longer of&nbsp;crippling but of destroying the Macedonian state.
                Perseus’s&nbsp;repeated proposals for peace during the war had been&nbsp;rejected;
                and his defeat was followed by the final extinction of the kingdom of Philip and
                    Alexander.@@<sup>8</sup> Macedonia, though it ceased to exist as a single state,
                was not&nbsp;definitely constituted a Roman province.@@<sup>9</sup> On the contrary,
                the mistake was made of introducing some of the&nbsp;main principles of the
                provincial system—taxation, disarmament, and the isolation of the separate
                communities—&nbsp;without the addition of the element most essential for
                the&nbsp;maintenance of order—that of a resident Roman governor.&nbsp;The four petty
                republics now created were each autonomous, and each separated from the rest by the
                prohibition&nbsp;of commercium and connubium, but no central
                controlling&nbsp;authority was substituted for that of the Macedonian king.&nbsp;The
                inevitable result was confusion and disorder, resulting&nbsp;finally (149-116) in
                the attempt of a pretender, Andriseus,&nbsp;who claimed to be a son of Perseus, to
                resuscitate the&nbsp;ancient monarchy.@@<sup>10</sup> On his defeat in 146 the
                senate&nbsp;hesitated no longer, and Macedonia became a Roman province, with a Roman
                magistrate at its head.@@<sup>11</sup></span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The results of the protectorate in Greece, if less dangerous to Roman
                supremacy, were quite as unfavourable to the maintenance of order. But from 189 to
                the&nbsp;defeat of Perseus in 167, no formal change of importance&nbsp;in the status
                of the Greek states was made by Rome. The&nbsp;senate, though forced year after year
                to listen to the&nbsp;mutual recriminations and complaints of rival communities and
                factions, contented itself as a rule with intervening just enough to remind the
                Greeks that their freedom&nbsp;was limited by its own paramount authority, and to
                prevent any single state or confederacy from raising itself too&nbsp;far above the
                level of general weakness which it was the&nbsp;interest of Rome to maintain. After
                the victory at&nbsp;Pydna, however, the sympathy shown for Perseus, exaggerated as
                it seems to have been by the interested representations of the Romanizing factions
                in the various states,</span></p>
