                of the Tiber from&nbsp;Rome to the sea was the subjugation of the petty Latin
                communities lying south of the river; and the tradition of the&nbsp;conquest and
                destruction of Politorium, Tellenae and Ficana&nbsp;is confirmed by the absence in
                historical times of any Latin&nbsp;communities in this district.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">With the reign of the fifth king Tarquinius Priscus a marked change
                takes place. The traditional accounts of the last three&nbsp;kings not only wear a
                more historical air than those of&nbsp;the first four, but they describe something
                like a transformation of the Roman city and state. Under the rule&nbsp;of these
                latter kings the separate settlements are for the first time&nbsp;enclosed with a
                rampart of colossal size and extent.<sup>@@1</sup> The low&nbsp;grounds are drained,
                and a forum and circus elaborately laid&nbsp;out; on the Capitoline Mount a temple
                is erected, the massive&nbsp;foundations of which were an object of wonder even to
                    Pliny.<sup>@@2&nbsp;</sup>To the same period are assigned the redi vision of the
                city area into&nbsp;four new districts and the introduction of a new military
                system.&nbsp;The kings increase in power and surround themselves with
                new&nbsp;splendour. Abroad, too, Rome suddenly appears as a powerful&nbsp;state
                ruling far and wide over southern Etruria and Latium.&nbsp;These startling changes
                are, moreover, ascribed to kings of&nbsp;alien descent, who one and all ascend the
                throne in the teeth&nbsp;of established constitutional forms. Finally, with the
                expulsion&nbsp;of the last of them—the younger Tarquin—comes a sudden&nbsp;shrinkage
                of power. At the commencement of the Republic&nbsp;Rome is once more a comparatively
                small state, with hostile&nbsp;and independent neighbours at her very doors. It is
                impossible&nbsp;to. doubt the conviction that the true explanation of this
                phenomenon is to be found in the supposition that Rome during this&nbsp;period
                passed under the rule of powerful Etruscan lords.<sup>@@3</sup> In&nbsp;the 7th and
                6th centuries b.c., and probably earlier still, the&nbsp;Etruscans appear as ruling
                widely outside the Emits of Etruria&nbsp;proper. They were supreme in the valley of
                the Po until their&nbsp;power there was broken by the irruption of Celtic tribes
                from&nbsp;beyond the Alps, and while still masters of the plains of
                Lombardy&nbsp;they estabEshed themselves in the rich lowlands of
                Campania,&nbsp;where they held their ground until the capture of Capua by&nbsp;the
                Samnite highlanders in 423 b.c. It is on the face of it&nbsp;improbable that? a
                power which had extended its sway from&nbsp;the Alps to the Tiber, and from the
                Liris to Surrentum, should&nbsp;have left untouched the intervening stretch of
                country between&nbsp;the Tiber and the Liris. And there is abundant evidence
                of&nbsp;Etruscan rule in Latium.<sup>@@4 </sup>According to Dionysius there
                was&nbsp;a time when the Latins were known to the Greeks as Tyrrhenians, and Rome as
                a Tyrrhenian city.<sup>@@5</sup> When Aeneas landed</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">in Italy the Latins were at feud with Turnus (Turrhenos? Dionys.
                i.64) of Ardea, whose close ally was the ruthless Mezentius,&nbsp;prince of Caere,
                to whom the Latins had been forced to pay a&nbsp;tribute of wine.<sup>@@6</sup> Cato
                declared the Volsci to have been once&nbsp;subject to Etruscan rule<sup>@@7</sup>
                and Etruscan remains found at&nbsp;Velitrae,<sup>@@8 </sup>as well as the second
                name of the Volscian Anxur,&nbsp;Tarracina (the city of Tarchon), confirm his
                statement. Nearer&nbsp;still to Rome is Tusculum, with its significant name, at
                Praeneste&nbsp;we have a great number of Etruscan inscriptions and bronzes,&nbsp;and
                at Alba we hear of a prince Tapxcrtos,<sup>@@9 </sup>lawless and cruel
                like&nbsp;Mezentius, who consults the <sup>u</sup> oracle of Tethys in
                Tyrrhenia.”&nbsp;Thus we find the Etruscan power encircling Rome on aU
                sides,&nbsp;and in Rome itself a tradition of the rule of princes of
                Etruscan&nbsp;origin. The Tarquinii come from south Etruria; their name&nbsp;can
                hardly be anything else than the Latin equivalent of the&nbsp;Etruscan Tarchon, and
                is therefore possibly a title ( = “ lord ”&nbsp;or “ prince ”) rather than a proper
                    name.<sup>@@10</sup> Even Servius Tullius&nbsp;was identified by Tuscan
                chroniclers with an Etruscan “ Mastarna.”<sup>@@11</sup> Again, what we are told of
                Etruscan conquests does&nbsp;not represent them as moving, like the Sabellian
                tribes, in large&nbsp;bodies and settEng down </span><span class="font0"

                and with their foUowers rule oppressively over alien&nbsp;and subject
                    peoples.<sup>@@12</sup> And so at Rome the story of the Tarquins&nbsp;implies
                not a wave of Etruscan immigration so much as a rule&nbsp;of Etruscan princes over
                conquered Latins.</span></p><div>
            <p><span class="font0">The achievements ascribed to the Tarquins are not less
                    characteristic. Their despotic rule and splendour contrast with the primitive
                    simplicity of the native kings. Only Etruscan&nbsp;builders, under the direction
                    of wealthy and powerful Etruscan&nbsp;lords, could have built the great cloaca,
                    the Servian wall, or the&nbsp;Capitoline temple,—monuments which challenged
                    comparison&nbsp;with those of the emperors themselves. Nor do the traces

                    at&nbsp;least possible that it was thanks to the extended rule and
                    wide&nbsp;connexions of her Etruscan rulers that Rome was first
                    brought&nbsp;into direct contact with the Greeks, who had long traded
                    with&nbsp;the Etruscan ports and influenced Etruscan
