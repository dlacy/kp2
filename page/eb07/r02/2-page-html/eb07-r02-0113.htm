<p><span class="font0">cal, or perhaps mythical, that it is utterly in vain to attempt to extract from it any thing like real history. It may have&nbsp;been merely meant to represent the period of the establishment of forms of laws and religion, which naturally follows&nbsp;that of founding a city and collecting a people. And as all&nbsp;ancient lawgivers assumed divine authority for the sanction&nbsp;of their institutions, so the Roman lawgiver is said to have&nbsp;obtained the instructions of Egeria. The legend is too&nbsp;beautiful to be lost, though too imaginative to be believed ;&nbsp;and we turn reluctantly from its evanescent loveliness, to&nbsp;the consideration of matter of a harsher mould.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">An interregnum again followed the death of Numa. At length Tullus Hostilius, a man of Latin or Romish extraction, was chosen by the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">curiœ ;</span><span class="font0"> and his election having&nbsp;been sanctioned by the auspices, he, like his predecessor,&nbsp;submitted to the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">comitia curiata</span><span class="font0"> the laws which conferred&nbsp;upon him full regal power. The new king was more desirous of military renown, than of the less dazzling fame&nbsp;which may be gained by cultivating the arts of peace. An&nbsp;opportunity was soon offered for indulging his warlike disposition. Plundering incursions had been made into each&nbsp;others’ territories by the borderers of the two states of Rome&nbsp;and Alba. Both nations sent ambassadors at the same time&nbsp;to demand redress. The Roman ambassadors had private&nbsp;orders from Tullus to be peremptory in their demands, and&nbsp;to limit their stay within the stated period of thirty days.&nbsp;They did so, and receiving no immediate satisfaction, returned to Rome. In the mean time, Tullus amused the&nbsp;Alban embassy by shews and banquets, till, when they&nbsp;opened their commission, he had it in his power to answer,&nbsp;that he had already in vain sought redress from Alba, and&nbsp;that now they must prepare for the events of a war, the&nbsp;blame of originating which was chargeable upon them. By&nbsp;this device Tullus thought to avoid the guilt of being the&nbsp;aggressor, and to secure the favour of the gods by the justice of his cause.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Under the command of Cluilius, the Albans sent a powerful army against Rome, and encamped about five miles from the city. There Cluilius died; and the Albans elected Mettius Fufetius in his stead. Tullus Hostilius, at the&nbsp;head of the Roman army, now drew near the Albans. But&nbsp;when the two armies were ready for a general engagement,&nbsp;Mettius, the Alban general, proposed to save the effusion of&nbsp;blood, by committing the fortune of the war to the valour&nbsp;of certain champions selected from either side. To this proposal Tullus agreed. It so happened that there were in each&nbsp;army three brothers, each three the children of one birth,&nbsp;whose mothers also were sisters, though their fathers belonged to different nations. The three Romans were named&nbsp;Horatii, the three Albans Curiatii. These youthful warriors were chosen to be the champions of their respective&nbsp;nations, and immediately prepared for the combat. It was&nbsp;agreed, that by the issue of this contest should be determined the dominion or subjection of each people. The two&nbsp;armies were drawn up in battle array, each on their own&nbsp;side of the boundary line that divided their territories. The&nbsp;young combatants advanced, and met on the very line. The&nbsp;combat began, and was sustained for some time with equal&nbsp;skill, courage, and ardour, while the two armies gazed on&nbsp;the eventful struggle with the suspended breath of intense&nbsp;anxiety. At length two of the Horatii fell at the feet of&nbsp;their antagonists ; a sight which called forth loud shouts of&nbsp;joy from the Albans, while the Romans remained quivering&nbsp;with suspense for the fate of their remaining champion,&nbsp;and the freedom of their country. Horatius was still unhurt, whilst the three Curiatii were all severely wounded. Believing himself more than a match for each singly, he feigned a flight to divide them. They pursued with unequal&nbsp;strength and speed, and were separated to considerable distances from each other. On a sudden he turned, rushed&nbsp;on the enemy nearest him, and slew him at a blow. With&nbsp;equal impetuosity he assailed and killed the second, while&nbsp;the third was hastening to render his brother aid. There&nbsp;was now but one combatant on either side, yet it could no&nbsp;longer be called a battle. Faint, exhausted, and dispirited,&nbsp;the third of tlle Curiatii sunk beneath the vigorous arm of&nbsp;the victorious Roman, who thus at once avenged his brothers, and won for his country the sovereign sway.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As the Romans were returning in triumph to the city, Horatius bearing the triple spoils, they were met at the Ca-penian gate by his sister, who had been betrothed to one&nbsp;of the Curiatii. When she beheld the bloody mantle of her&nbsp;lover, which she had wrought witll her own hands, borne&nbsp;aloft by her brother, she burst into loud lamentations, flinging loose her scattered locks. Horatius, enraged at her untimely grief and outcry, drew his sword and pierced her to&nbsp;the heart, exclaiming, “ So perish the Roman woman that&nbsp;shall bewail a foe.” For this tierce deed, Horatius was by&nbsp;the judges condemned to death. But he appealed to the&nbsp;people, and his father defended him, saying, that if his daughter had not deserved to die, he would himself have punished his son, in virtue of his own authority as a father. The&nbsp;people refused to stain the victory which Horatius had&nbsp;achieved for his country by shedding the blood of the conqueror, and therefore spared his life, but caused him to undergo the semblance of capital punishment, and perform&nbsp;certain expiating sacrifices and rites, which thenceforth became hereditary in the Horatian family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Notwithstanding the agreement which had been entered into between the Romans and the Albans, the latter were&nbsp;unwilling to forfeit their national independence without an&nbsp;additional struggle. This, however, they were desirous to&nbsp;avoid provoking single-handed. They accordingly encouraged the people of Fidenæ to revolt, hy giving them secret&nbsp;promises of assistance. Tullus Hostilius immediately levied&nbsp;a Roman army, and summoned the Albans to his aid. The&nbsp;two armies met, the Veientes being drawn up opposite to&nbsp;the Romans, and the Fidenates confronting the Albans.&nbsp;When the battle began, Mettius Fufetius, the Alban leader,&nbsp;wanted courage and decision to fulfil his own treacherous&nbsp;pledge ; he neither joined the Romans nor the Fidenates,&nbsp;but drawing his men off from the conflict, stood aloof, to&nbsp;watch the event and act accordingly. His defection struck&nbsp;a temporary panic into the Romans, which was speedily allayed by the bravery and skill of Tullus ; and his remaining aloof caused distrust in the Fidenates, who finally fled&nbsp;before the vigorous onset of their antagonists. Tullus gained a complete victory ; and concealing his knowledge of the&nbsp;treachery of Mettius, next day called an assembly of his&nbsp;whole army. The Albans came unarmed, and arrived first.&nbsp;The Romanscame next, wearing, as they had been directed,&nbsp;their swords hid beneath their mantles, and at a signal surrounded the Albans. Tullus then denounced the treachery&nbsp;of Mettius, and commanded him to be torn asunder by&nbsp;two chariots of four horses, as his mind had been divided&nbsp;between the Romans and the Fidenates in the battle. It&nbsp;was then decreed that Alba should be razed to the ground,&nbsp;and the whole Alban people removed to Rome, to prevent&nbsp;the possibility of future strife. Not only the walls of Alba,&nbsp;but every human habitation, was totally demolished, and the&nbsp;temples of the gods alone left standing in solitary majesty&nbsp;amid the ruins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But though Tullus had thus put an end to the separate existence of Alba, he did not reduce its inhabitants to slavery. He assigned them habitations on the Caelian hill,&nbsp;which had formerly been possessed by the followers of the&nbsp;Etruscan Lucumo, Caeles Vibenna. Those who had been&nbsp;of patrician rank at Alba were allowed to retain the same&nbsp;rank at Rome, and a new tribe was formed, called the Luceres. The construction and numbers of this tribe were the&nbsp;same as those of the other two ; so that the entire senate,&nbsp;composed of the beads of houses of the three tribes,</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
