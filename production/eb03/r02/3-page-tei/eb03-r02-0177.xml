Agrippa, the third time conſiſt, and finding all things ripe for his deſign, the people being highly pleaſed with his mild government, and the ſenate filled with his creatures, whoſe fortunes depended upon his holding the power he had uſurped, went by the advice of Agrippa and Mæcenas to the ſenate-houſe ; and there, in a ſtudied ſpeech, offered to reſign his authority, and put all again into the hands of the people upon the old foundation of the commonwealth ; being well appriſed, that the greater part of the conſcript fathers, whoſe intereſts were interwoven with his, would unanimouſiy preſs him to the contrary : Which happened accordingly ; for they not only interrupted him while he was ſpeaking, but, after he had done, unanimouſiy beſought him to take upon himſelf alone the whole government of the Roman empire. He, with a ſeeming reluctance, yielded at laſt to their requeſt, as if he had been compelled to accept of the ſovereignt. By this artifice he compaſſed his deſign, which was, to get the power and authority, which he had uſurped, confiιmed to him by the ſenate and people for the ſpace of io years : for he would not accept of it for a longer term, pretending he ſhould in that time be able to ſettle all things in ſuch peace and order that there would be no further need of his authority ; but that he might then eaſe himſelf of the burden, and put the government again into the hands of the ſenate and people. This method he took to render the yoke leſs heavy ; but with a deſign to renew his leaſe, if we may be allowed the expreſſion, as ſoon as the ten years were expired ; which he did accordingly from ten years to ten years as long as he lived, all the while governing the whole Roman empire with an abſolute and uncontrouled power. With this new authority the ſenate reſolved to diſtinguiſh him with a new name. Some of the conſcript fathers propoſed the name of <hi rend="italic">Romulus,</hi>  thereby to import that he was another founder of Rome; others offered other titles ; but the venerable name of <hi rend="italic">Auguſtus,</hi>  propoſed by Manutius Plancus, ſeemed preferable to all the reſt, as it expreſſed more dignity and reverence than authority, the moſt ſacred things, ſuch as temples, and places conſecrated by augurs, being termed by the Romans <hi rend="italic">Auguſta.</hi>  Octavianus himſell was inclined to aſſume the name of <hi rend="italic">Romulus ;</hi>  but, ſearing he ſhould be ſuſpected of affecting the kingdom, he declined it, and took that of <hi rend="italic">Auguſtus,</hi>  by which we ſhall henceforth diſtinguiſh him.</p><p>Though the whole power of the ſenate and people was now veſted in Auguſtus, yet, that he might ſeem to ſhare it with the conſcript fathers, he reſuſed to govern all the provinces ; aſſigning to the ſenate ſuch as were quiet and peaceable; and keeping to himſelf thoſe which, bordering upon barbarous nations, were moſt expoſed to troubles and wars, ſaying, He deſired the fathers might enjoy their power with eaſe and ſafety, while he underwent all the dangers and labours : but, by this politic conduct, he ſecured all the military power to himſelf ; the troops lying in the provinces he had choſen ; and the others, which were governed by the ſenate, being quite deſtitute of ſc.rces. The latter were called <hi rend="italic">ſenatorial,</hi>  and the former <hi rend="italic">imperial,</hi>  provinces. O∙ ver the provinces of both ſorts were ſet men of diſtinction, to wit, ſuch as had been conſuls or prætors, with the titles of <hi rend="italic">proconſul</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">proprietor ;</hi>  but the government of Egypt was committed to a private knight, Auguſtus ſearing left a perſon of rank, depending upon the wealth and ſituation of that country, might raiſe new diſturbances in the empire. All theſe governors held their employment only for a year, and were upon the arrival of their ſucceſſors to depart their provinces immediately, and not fail to be at Rome within three months at the fartheſt. This diviſion of the provinces was made, according to Ovid, on the ides of January ; whereas he was veſted by the ſenate and people with the ſovereign power on the ſeventh of the ides of the ſame month, as is manifeſt from the Narbonne marbles ; and ſrom that time many writers date the years of his empire. Thus ended the greateſt commonwealth, and at the ſame time began the greateſt monarchy, that had ever been known ; a monarchy which infinitely excelled in power, riches, extent; and continuance, all the empires which had preceded it..</p><p>It comprehended the greateſt and by ſar the beſt part of Europe, Aſia, and Aſrica, being near 4000 miles in length, and about half as much fin breadth. As to the yearly revenues of the empire, they have by a moderate computation been reckoned to amount to forty millions of our money. But the Romans themſelves now ran hodlong into all manner of luxury and effeminacy. The people were become a mere mob ; thoſe who w<hi rend="sup">,</hi>ere wont to direct mighty wars, to raiſe and depoſe great kings, to beſtow or take away potent empires, were ſe ſunk and debauched, that, if they had but bread and ſhows, their ambition went no higher. The nobility were indeed more polite than in former ages; but at the ſame time idle, venal, vicious, inſenſible of private virtue, utter .ſtrangers to public glory or diſgrace, void of zeal for the welfare of their country, and ſolely intent on gaining the favour of the emperor, as knowing that certain wealth and preferment were the rewards of ready ſubmiſſion, acquieſcence, and flattery. No wonder, therefore, that they loſt their liberty, without being ever again able to retrieve it.</p><p>Auguſtus, now abſolute maſter of the Roman empire, took all methods to ingratiate himſelf with his ſoldiers, by whoſe means he had attained ſuch a height of power. With this view, he diſperſed them through different parts of Iζaly in 32 colonies, that he might the more eaſily reaſſemble them on proper occaſions. He kept 25 legions conſtantly on foot, 17 of which were in Europe ; viz. eight on the Rhine, four on the Danube, three in Spain, and two in Dalmatia. The other eight were ſent into Aſia and Africa ; four of them being quartered in the neighbourhood of the Euphrates, two in Egypt, and two in Africa Propria, that is, the ancient dominions of Carthage. All theſe forces, amounting to 170,650 men, were conſtantly kept on foot by the Roman emperors for ſeveral ages. In the neighbourhood of Rome were always quartered 12 co-· horts, that is, about 10,∞0 men ; nine of which were called <hi rend="italic">prœtorian cohorts ;</hi>  the other three, <hi rend="italic">city cohorts. </hi>Theſe were eſtabliſhed as a guard to the emperor, and. to maintain peace and tranquillity in the city, but had· oſten a great ſhail* in the diſturbances which took place throughout the empire. Beſides theſe, Auguſtus con-,· fiant ly kept at ſea two powerful navies ; the one riding.</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
