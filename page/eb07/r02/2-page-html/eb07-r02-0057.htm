<p><span class="font1">able him readily to trace back their steps to the most elementary principles ; which is scarcely possible in any of the works of the most modem school of analysis. Professor&nbsp;Robison, however, seems rarely to have cultivated the higher&nbsp;mathematics for their own sake only, or any further than as&nbsp;they could be applied to the study of the phenomena of nature, or to the practice of the combinations of art : in fact,&nbsp;without some such limitation, there would be no track to&nbsp;guide us in the pathless regions of quantity and number,&nbsp;and their endless relations and functions. But besides the&nbsp;utility of the pure mathematics as a branch of early education, in exercising and fortifying the powers of the mind, it&nbsp;is impossible to foresee with certainty </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">how much</span><span class="font1"> of mathematics may be wanted by the natural philosopher in any&nbsp;given investigation ; and Professor Robison, as well as many&nbsp;others of his countrymen, would certainly have been the&nbsp;better for the possession of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a little more,</span><span class="font1"> as the author of the&nbsp;criticisms in the Imperial Review has already had occasion&nbsp;to remark.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">ROCHDALE, a market-town of the county of Lancaster, in the hundred of Salford, 197 miles from London and twelve from Manchester. It is situated in a fine valley on&nbsp;the river Roche, and is overlooked by the church, which&nbsp;stands on an eminence ascended by 118 steps. The hills&nbsp;around it abound in excellent coal. The chief occupation&nbsp;is the manufacture of flannels and other woollen goods. The&nbsp;parish is large, and contains twelve townships, two of which&nbsp;are in the west riding of Yorkshire. The population of the&nbsp;ten in Lancashire amounted in 1801 to 29,954, in 1811 to&nbsp;45,227, in 1821 to 48,112, and in 1831 to 58,441 ; that of&nbsp;the Yorkshire part amounted in 1831 to 15,997. By the&nbsp;parliamentary reform bill this town has received the privilege of electing one member to the House of Commons,&nbsp;but it has no municipal corporation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROCHE-BERNARD, a town of France, in the department of Morbihan, and arrondissement of Vannes.

<p><span class="font1">ROCHEFORT, an arrondissement of the department of the Lower Charente, in France, which extends over 295&nbsp;square miles. It comprises four cantons, divided into forty-two communes, and in 1836 contained 51,727 inhabitants.&nbsp;The capital is a city of the same name, about six miles from&nbsp;the mouth of the river Charente. The harbour is convenient and secure, and constantly contains many men of war.&nbsp;The wharfs are very well contrived, and vessels can take in&nbsp;or discharge the guns and other stores with great facility.&nbsp;It was first made a naval arsenal by Louis XIV. The city&nbsp;is surrounded with walls, and the harbour defended by strong&nbsp;forts. It is a regular, well-built city, with broad streets,&nbsp;containing five churches, a naval hospital, a school of navigation, and fine docks. There were, in 1836, 15,441 inhabitants, besides a garrison in the handsome barracks. There&nbsp;are establishments for making china, for refining sugar, and&nbsp;manufactories of ropes, cables, and sailcloth. Long. 0.2.54.&nbsp;W. Lat 45. 16. 10. N.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROCHEFOUCAULT, Francis Duke de la, prince of Marsillac, governor of Poitou, was born in 1603. He was&nbsp;the son of Francis, the first duke of Rochefoucault, and&nbsp;was distinguished equally by his courage and his wit. These&nbsp;shining qualities endeared him to all the nobility at court,&nbsp;who were ambitious of decorating themselves at once with&nbsp;the laurels of Mars and of Apollo. He wrote two excellent works; the one a book of Maxims, which, Voltaire says,&nbsp;has contributed more than any thing else to form the taste&nbsp;of the French nation ; and the other, Memoirs of the Regency of Queen Anne of Austria. It was partly at the instigation of the beautiful duchess de Longueville, to whom&nbsp;he had long been attached, that the duke de Rochefoucault&nbsp;engaged in the civil wars, in which he signalized himself,&nbsp;particularly at the battle of St Antoine. After the civil&nbsp;wars were ended, he thought of nothing but enjoying the&nbsp;calm pleasures of friendship and literature. His house became the rendezvous of every person of genius in Paris and&nbsp;Versailles. Racine, Boileau, and Savigné, found in his conversation charms which they sought for in vain elsewhere.&nbsp;He was not, however, with all his elegance and genius, </span><span class="font2">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">member of the French Academy. The necessity of making a public speech on the day of his reception was the&nbsp;only cause that he did not claim admittance. This nobleman, with all the courage he had displayed upon various&nbsp;critical occasions, and with his superiority of birth and understanding over the common run of men, did not think&nbsp;himself capable of facing an audience to utter only four lines&nbsp;in public, without being out of countenance. He died at&nbsp;Paris in 1680, aged sixty-eight, leaving behind him a character which has been variously drawn by those who during&nbsp;his life were proud of his friendship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROCHELLE, an arrondissement of the department of the Lower Charente, in France, extending over 310 square&nbsp;miles. It comprehends seven cantons, divided into fifty-five&nbsp;communes, and in 1836 contained 78,797 inhabitants. The&nbsp;capital is the city of the same name, the seat of the departmental government and of the courts of law.

It is the seat of a bishop,&nbsp;has a cathedral, one Protestant and five Catholic churches,&nbsp;and in the year 1836 had 14,857 inhabitants, who are traders in wine, brandy, salt, and other domestic products, and&nbsp;in all kinds of colonial articles. It is celebrated for its long&nbsp;siege when held by the Protestants in 1628, which was&nbsp;continued for thirteen months, and was attended with dreadful sufferings. Long. 1.14.17. W. Lat. 46.9. 33. N.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROCHESTER, an ancient city in the county of Kent, thirty miles from London. It is commonly supposed to have&nbsp;been founded by the ancient Britons. In the time of the&nbsp;Romans it was one of their military stations, but did not&nbsp;attain any great celebrity until more than a century after&nbsp;the arrival of the Saxons, who in the reign of King Ethel-bert, constituted it the seat of a bishop, and it was considered as a most important military station. By the Britons it&nbsp;was known under the name of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dourbrys ;</span><span class="font1"> tile Romans called&nbsp;it </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Durohrivœ,</span><span class="font1"> which the Saxons changed to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rοflcαster,</span><span class="font1"> from&nbsp;which its present name has been derived. It is situated on&nbsp;the river Medway, a stream which, rising in the centre of&nbsp;Kent, becomes navigable at Maidstone, and increases, till,&nbsp;near Rochester, it is affected by the tides, which reach&nbsp;it from the Thames at the Nore. At Rochester is the first&nbsp;bridge over that fine stream. This bridge, built in the&nbsp;reign of King John, with the exception of the bridges in&nbsp;London, was long deemed superior to any other in the&nbsp;kingdom in height, strength, and elegance. It consists of&nbsp;eleven arches, three of which have been rebuilt, and the&nbsp;whole, by modern improvement, widened and beautified,&nbsp;and ornamented with balustrades, panels, and bold copings.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
