<p><span class="font1">Hermogenes. At the revival of letters the treatise of Aphthonius once more became a standard text-book. Much popularity was&nbsp;enjoyed also by the exercises of Aelius Theon (of uncertain date;&nbsp;see Tiieon). (See further the editions of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rhetores Graeci&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">by L. Spengel and by Ch. Walz.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">During the first four centuries of the empire the practice of the art was in greater vogue than ever before or since. First,&nbsp;there was a general dearth of the higher intellectual&nbsp;interests: politics gave no scope to energy; philosophy&nbsp;was stagnant, and literature, as a rule, either arid or&nbsp;frivolous. Then the Greek schools had poured their&nbsp;rhetoricians into Rome, where the same tastes which&nbsp;revelled in coarse luxuiy welcomed tawdry declamation.&nbsp;The law-courts of the Roman provinces further created a&nbsp;continual demand for forensic speaking. The public teacher&nbsp;of rhetoric was called “ sophist,” which was now an&nbsp;academic title, similar to “ professor ” or “ doctor.”&nbsp;In the 4th century b.c. Isocrates had taken pride in&nbsp;the name of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">σοφιστήν,</span><span class="font1"> which, indeed, had at no time wholly lost&nbsp;the good, or neutral, sense which originally belonged to it.&nbsp;The academic meaning which it acquired under the early&nbsp;empire lasted into the middle ages (see Du Cange, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">s.v.,</span><span class="font1"> who&nbsp;quotes from Baldricus, “ Egregius Doctor magnusque Sophista&nbsp;Geraldus ”). While the word </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rhetor</span><span class="font1"> still denoted the faculty,&nbsp;the word </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sophistes</span><span class="font1"> denoted the office or rank to which the&nbsp;rhetor might hope to rise. So Lucian (“ Teacher of Rhetoricians,” § i) says: “ You ask, young man, how you are to&nbsp;become a rhetor, and attain in your turn to the repute of that&nbsp;most impressive and illustrious title, sophist.” Lucian also&nbsp;satirizes the discussions of the nature of rhetoric in his parody</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Parasite</span><span class="font1"> (cf. also his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bis Accusatus).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Vespasian (70-79 a.d.), according to Suetonius, was the first emperor who gave a public endowment to the teaching&nbsp;of rhetoric. Under Hadrian and the Antonines (a.d. 117-180)&nbsp;the public chairs of rhetoric became objects of the&nbsp;highest ambition. The complete constitution of the&nbsp;schools at Athens was due to Marcus Aurelius. The</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Philosophical school had four chairs </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(fipovoi)—</span><span class="font1">Platonic, Stoic, Peripatetic, Epicurean. The Rhetorical school had two chairs,&nbsp;one' for “ sophistic,” the other for “ political ” rhetoric. By&nbsp;“ sophistic ” was meant the academic teaching of rhetoric as&nbsp;an art, in distinction from its “ political ” application to the&nbsp;law-courts. The “ sophistical ” chair was superior to the&nbsp;“political” in dignity as in emolument,and its occupant was&nbsp;invested with a Jurisdiction over the youth of Athens similar&nbsp;to that of the vice-chancellor in a modern university. The&nbsp;Antonines further encouraged rhetoric by granting immunities&nbsp;to its teachers. Three “ sophists ” in each of the smaller towns,&nbsp;and five in the larger, were exempted from taxation </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Dig.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">xxvii.' r, 6, § 2). The wealthier sophists affected much personal&nbsp;splendour. PoIemon (6. a.d. 130) and Adrian of Tyre (c. a.d.&nbsp;170) are famous examples of extravagant display. The aim&nbsp;of the sophist was to impress the multitude. His whole stock-in-trade was style, and this was directed to astonishing by </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">tours&nbsp;de forée.</span><span class="font1"> The scholastic declamations were chiefly of&nbsp;two classes. (1) The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Suasoriae</span><span class="font1"> were usually on&nbsp;historical or legendary subjects, in which some course&nbsp;of action was commended or censured (cf. Juv. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Satf.</span><span class="font1"> These</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Suasoriae</span><span class="font1"> belonged to deliberative rhetoric (the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">βουλευτικόν yévos, deliber ativum genus).</span><span class="font1"> (2) The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Controversiae</span><span class="font1"> turned&nbsp;especially on legal issues, and represented the forensic rhetoric&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(bLKavLKov yevos, Judiciale genus).</span><span class="font1"> But it was the general&nbsp;characteristic of this period that all subjects, though formally&nbsp;“ deliberative ” or “ forensic,” were treated in the style and&nbsp;spirit of that third branch which Aristotle distinguished, the&nbsp;rhetoric of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">επίδειξή</span><span class="font1"> or “ display.” The oratory produced by&nbsp;the age of the academic sophists can be estimated from a large&nbsp;extant literature. It is shown under various aspects, and presumably at its best, by such writers as Dio Chrysostom at the&nbsp;end of the ist century, AeIius Aristides (see Aristides, Aelius)&nbsp;in the 2nd, the chief rhetorician under the Antonines, Themistius,&nbsp;Himerius and Libanius in the 4th. Amid much which is&nbsp;tawdry or vapid, these writings occasionally present passages&nbsp;of true literary beauty, while they constantly offer matter of&nbsp;the highest interest to the student.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the medieval system of academic studies, grammar, logic and rhetoric were the subjects of the trivium, or course&nbsp;followed during the four years of undergraduateship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Music, arithmetic, geometry and astronomy constituted the quadrivium, or course for the three years from the B.A. to thé M.A. degree. These were the seven&nbsp;liberal arts. In the middle ages the chief authorities on&nbsp;rhetoric were the latest Latin epitomists, such as Martianus&nbsp;CapeIla (5th cent.), Cassiodorus (5th cent.) or Isidorus (7th&nbsp;cent.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">After the revival of learning the better Roman and Greek writers gradually returned into use. Some new treatises were&nbsp;also produced. Leonard Cox (d. 1549) wrote </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Art or Craft of&nbsp;Rhetoryke,</span><span class="font1"> partly compiled, partly original, which was reprinted&nbsp;in Latin at Cracow. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Art of Rhetoriqiie,</span><span class="font1"> by Thomas Wilson&nbsp;(1553), afterwards secretary of state, embodied rules chiefly&nbsp;from Aristotle, with help from Cicero and Quintilian. About&nbsp;the same time treatises on rhetoric were published in France&nbsp;by Tonquelin (1555) and Courcelles (1557). The general aim&nbsp;at this period was to revive and popularize the best teaching&nbsp;of the ancients on rhetoric. The subject was regularly&nbsp;taught at the universities, and was indeed important.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">At Cambridge in 1570 the study of rhetoric was based on Quintilian, Hermogenes and the speeches of&nbsp;Cicero viewed as works of art. An Oxford statute of 1588&nbsp;shows that the same books were used there. In 1620 George&nbsp;Herbert was delivering lectures on rhetoric at Cambridge,&nbsp;where he held the office of public orator. The decay of rhetoric&nbsp;as a formal study at the universities set in during the 18th&nbsp;century. The function of the rhetoric lecturer passed over&nbsp;into that of correcting written themes; but his title remained&nbsp;long after his office had lost its primary meaning. If the theory&nbsp;of rhetoric fell into neglect, the practice, however, was encouraged&nbsp;by the public exercises (“ acts ” and “ opponencies ”) in the&nbsp;schools. The college prizes for “ declamations ” served the&nbsp;same purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The fortunes of rhetoric in the modern world, as briefly sketched above, may suffice to suggest why few modern writers&nbsp;of ability have given their attention to the subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Perhaps one of the most notable modern contributions to the art is the collection of commonplaces framed (in&nbsp;Latin) by Bacon, “ to be so many spools from which the threads&nbsp;can be drawn out as occasion serves,” a truly curious work of&nbsp;that acute and fertile mind. He called them “ Antitheta.” A&nbsp;specimen is subjoined:—</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">This is quite in the spirit of Aristotle’s treatise. The popularity enjoyed by Blair’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rhetoric</span><span class="font1"> in the latter part of the 18th and the earlier part of the 19th century was merited rather by&nbsp;the form than by the matter.

But undoubtedly the best modern&nbsp;book on the subject is Whately’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Elements of Rhetoric.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Starting from Aristotle’s view, that rhetoric is “ an offshoot from logic,” Whately treats it as the art of “ argumentative composition.” He considers it under four heads:</span></p>
