When we read at our fire- ſide the account of an engagement, or other intereſting operation of an army, our attention is generally ſo much engaged by the reſults, that we give but little to the movements which led to them, and produced them, and we ſeldom form to ourſelves any diſtinct notion of the conduct of the day. But a profeſſional man, or one accuſtomed to reflection, and who is not ſatisfied with the mere indulgence of eager curioſity, follows every regiment in its movements, endeavours to see their connection and the influence which they have had on the fate of the day, and even to form to himſelf a general notion of the whole ſcene of action at its different intereſting periods. He looks with the eye of the general, and  sees his orders ſucceed or fail.</p><p>But few trouble themſelves farther about the narration. The movement is ordered ; it is performed ; and the fortune of the day is determined. Few think how all this is brought about ; and when they are told that during the whole of the battle of Cuſtrin, Frederic the Great was in the upper room of a country inn, from whence he could view the whole field, while his aids de camp, on horseback, waited his orders in the yard below, they are ſtruck with wonder, and can hardly conceive how it can be done : but, on reflection, they ſee the poſſibility of the thing. Their imagination accompanies the meſſenger from the inn yard to the ſcene of action ; they hear the General’s orders delivered, and they expect its execution.</p><p>But when we think for a moment on the situation of the commander of a fleet, confined on board one ſhip, and this ſhip as much, or more cloſely, engaged, than any other of the fleet ; and when we reflect that here are no meſſengers ready to carry his orders to ſhips of the ſquadron at the diſtance of miles from him, and to deliver them with preciſion and diſtinctneſs, and that even if this were poſſible by sending small ſhips or boats, the viciſſitudes of wind and weather may render the communication ſo tedious that the favourable moment may be irretrievably lost before the order can be conveyed.—When we think of all theſe circumſtances, our thoughts are bewildered, and we are ready to imagine that a ſea-battle is nothing but the unconnected ſtruggle of individual ſhips ; and that when the admiral has once “ cried havoc, and let slip the dogs of war,” he has done all that his ſituation empowers him to do, and he muſt leave the fate of the day to the bravery and ſkill of his captains and bailors.</p><p>Yet it is in this ſituation, apparently the moſt unfavourable, that the orders of the commander can be conveyed, with a diſpatch that is not attainable in the operations of a laud army. The ſcene of action is unincumbered, ſo that the eye of the General can behold the whole without interruption. The movements which <hi rend="italic">it</hi> is poſſible to exccute are few, and they are preciſe. A few words are ſufficient to order them, and then the mere fighting the ſhips muſt always be left to their reſpective commanders. This ſimplicity in the duty to be performed has enabled us to frame a language fully adequate to the buſineſs in hand, by which a correſpondence can be kept up as far as the eye can ſee.
