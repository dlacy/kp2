                <p><label>RHODES</label>, a celebrated iſland in the Archipelago, the largeſt and
                    moſt eaſterly of the Cyclades, was known in ancient times by the names of <hi

                    differ-ent etymologies, among which it is difficult to find one preferable to
                    another. It is about 20 miles diſtant from the coaſts of Lycia and Caria, and
                    about 120 miles in compaſs.</p>
                <p>Several ancient authors aſſert, that Rhodes was formerly covered by the ſea, but
                    gradually raiſed its head above the waves, and became an iſland. Delos and

                    ſupported by ſuch a variety of other evidence as render it indubitable.
                        Philo<note anchored="true" place="margin" type="authorial" n="2"><hi
                            rend="italic">Philo de Mundo.</hi></note> aſcribes the event to the
                    decreaſe of the waters of the ocean. If his conjecture be not without
                    foundation, moſt of the iſles of the Archipelago, being lower than Rhodes, muſt
                    have had a ſimilar origin. But it is much more probable that the volcanic fires,
                    which in the fourth year of the 135th Olympiad, raiſed Theraſia and Thera, known
                    at preſent by the name of <hi rend="italic">Santorin,</hi> from the depths of
                    the ſea, and have in our days thrown out ſeveral ſmall iſſands adjacent, alſo
                    produced in ſome ancient era Rhodes and Delos.</p>
                <p>The firſt inhabitants of Rhodes, according to Diodorus Siculus, were called the <hi rend="italic">Telchinœ,</hi> who came originally from the iſland of
                    Crete. Theſe, by their ſkill in aſtrology, perceiving that the iſland was ſoon
                    to be drowned with water, left their habitations, and made room for the
                    Heliades, or grandſons of Phœbus, who took poſſeſſion of the iſland after that
                    god had cleared it from the water and mud with which it was over-whelmed. Theſe
                    Heliades, it ſeems. excelled all other men in learning, and eſpecially in
                    aſtrology ; invented navigation, &amp;c. In after ages, however, being
                    infeſt-ed with great ſerpents which bred in the iſſand, they had recourſe to an
                    oracle in Delos, which adviſed them to admit Phorbas, a Theſſalian, with his
                    followers, into Rhodes. This was accordingly done ; and Phorbas having deſtroyed
                    the ſerpents, was, after his death, honoured as a demigod. Afterwards a colony
                    of Cretans ſettled in ſome part of the iſſand, and a little before the Trojan
                    war, Tlepolinius the ſon of Hercules, who was made king of the whole iſland, and
                    governed with great juſtice and moderation.</p>
                <p>After the Trojan war, all the ancient inhabitants were driven out by the
                    Dorians, who continued to be maſters of the iſland for many ages. The government
                    was at firſt monarchical ; but a little before the expedition of Xerxes into
                    Greece, a republican form of go-vernment was introduced ; during which the
                    Rhodians applied themſelves to navigation, and became very powerful by ſea,
                    planting ſeveral colonies in diſtant. countries. In the time of the
                    Peloponneſian war, the republic of Rhodes was rent into two factions, one of
                    which favoured the Athenians, and another the Spar-tans ; but at length the
                    latter prevailing, democracy was aboliſhed, and an ariſtocracy introduced. About
                    351 B. C. we ſind the Rhodians oppreſſed by Mauſo-lus king of Caria, and at laſt
                    reduced by Artemiſia his widow. In this emergency, they applied to the Athenians
                    ; by whoſe aſſiſtance, probably, they regained their liberty.</p>
                <p>From this time to that of Alexander the Great, the Rhodians enjoyed an
                    uninterrupted tranquillity. To him they voluntarily ſubmitted ; and were on that
                    ac</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r01-0216" facs="gri_33125011196389_0222.tif"/>
                <p>count highly favoured by him : but no ſooner did they hear ofhis death, than
                    they drove out the Macedonian garriſons, and once more became a free people.
                    About this time happened a dreadful inundation at Rhodes ; which, being
                    accompanied with violent ſtorms of rain, and hailſtones of an extraordinary
                    bigneſs, beat down many houſes, and killed great numbers of the inhabitants. As
                    the city was built in the form of an amphitheatre, and no care had been taken to
                    clear the pipes and conduits which conveyed the water into the ſea, the lower
                    parts of the city were in an inſtant laid under water, ſeveral houſes quite
                    covered, and the inha-bitants drowned before they could get to the higher
                    places. As the deluge increaſed, and the violent ſhowers continued, ſome of the
                    inhabitants made to their ſhips, and abandoned the place, while others miſerably
                    periſhed in the waters. But while the city was thus threatened with utter
                    deſtruction, the wall on a ſudden burſt aſunder, and the water diſcharging
                    itſelf by a violent current into the ſea, unexpectedly delivered the inhabitants
                    from all danger.</p>
                <p>The Rhodians ſuffered greatly by this unexpected accident, but ſoon retrieved
                    their loſſes by a cloſe application to trade. During the wars which took place
                    among the ſucceſſors of Alexander, the Rhodians ob-ſerved a ſtrict neutrality ;
                    by which means they enriched themſelves ſo much, that Rhodes became one of the
                    moſt opulent ſtates of that age ; inſomuch that, for the common good of Greece,
                    they undertook the <hi rend="italic">piratic war,</hi> and, at their own
                    charge, cleared the ſeas of the pirates who had for many years infeſted the
                    coaſts of Europe and Aſia. However, notwithſtanding the neu-trality they
                    profeſſed, as the moſt advantageous branch-es of their commerce were derived
                    from Egypt, they were more attached to Ptolemy, king of that country, than to
                    any of the neighbouring princes, when there-fore Antigonus, having engaged in a
                    war with Ptolemy about the iſland of Cyprus, demanded ſuccours of them, they
                    earneſtly intreated him not to compel them to de-clare war againſt their ancient
                    friend and ally. But this anſwer, prudent as it was, drew upon them the
                    diſpleaſure of Antigonus, who immediately ordered one of his admirals to ſail
                    with his fleet to Rhodes, and ſeize all the ſhips that came out of the harbour
                    for Egypt. The Rhodians, finding their harbour blocked up by tlie fleet of
                    Antigonus, equipped a good number of galleys, fell upon the enemy, and obliged
                    him, with tlie loſs of many ſhips, to quit his ſtation. Hereupon Antigonus,
                    charging them as aggreſſors, and beginners -of an unjuſt war, threatened to
                    beſiege their city with the ſtrength of his whole army. The Rhodians endeavoured
                    by frequent embaſſies to appeaſe his wrath ; but all their remonſtrances ſerved
                    rather to provoke than allay his reſentment : and the only terms upon which he
                    would hearken to any accommodation were, that the Rhodians ſhould declare war
                    againſt Ptolemy, that they ſhould admit his fleet into their harbour, and that
                    an hundred of the chief citizens ſhould be delivered up to him as hoſtages for
                    the performance of theſe articles. The Rhodians ſent ambaſſadors to all their
                    allies, and to Ptolemy in particular, imploring their aſſiſtance, and
                    repreſenting to the latter, that their attachment to his intereſt had drawn upon
                    them the danger to which they were expoſed. The prepartions on both ſides were
                    immenſe. As Antigonus was near fourſcore years of age at that time, he committed
                    the whole management of the war to his ſon Demetrius, who appeared before the
                    city of Rhodes with 200 ſhips of war, 170 tranſ-ports having on board 40,000
                    men, and 1000 other veſſels laden with proviſions and all ſorts of warlike
                    engines. As Rhodes had enjoyed for many years a pro-found tranquillity, and been
                    free from all devaſtations, the expectation of booty, in the plunder of ſo
                    wealthy a city, allured multitudes of pirates and mercenaries to join Demetrius
                    in this expedition ; inſomuch that the whole ſea between the continent and the
                    iſland was covered with ſhips ; which ſtruck the Rhodians, who had a proſpect of
                    this mighty armada from the walls, with great terror and conſternation.</p>
                <p>Demetrius, having landed his troops without the reach of the enemy’s machines,
                    detached ſeveral ſmall bodies to lay waſte the country round the city, and cut
                    down the trees and groves, employing the timber, and materials of the houſes
                    without the walls, to fortify his camp with ſtrong ramparts and a treble
                    paliſade ; which work, as many hands were employed, was finiſhed in a few days.
                    The Rhodians, on their part, prepared for a vigorous defence. Many great
                    commanders, who had ſignalized themſelves on other occaſions, threw themfelves
                    into the city, being deſirous to try their ſkill in military affairs againſt
                    Demetrius, who was reputed one of the moſt experienced captains in the conduct
                    of ſieges that antiquity had produced. The beſieged began with diſmiſſing from
                    the city all ſuch perſons as were uſeleſs ; and then taking an account of thoſe
                    who were capable of bearing arms, they found that the citizens amounted to 6000,
                    and the foreigners to 1000. Liberty was promiſed to all the ſlaves who ſhould
                    diſtinguiſh themſelves by any glorious action, and the public engaged to pay the
                    maſters their full ranſom. A proclamation was likewiſe made, declaring, that
                    whoever died in defence of their country ſhould be buried at the expence of the
                    public ; that his parents and children ſhould be maintained out of the treaſury
                    ; that fortunes ſhould be given to his daughters ; and his ſons, when they were
                    grown up, ſhould be crowned and preſented with a complete ſuit of armour at the
                    great ſolemnity of Bacchus ; which decree kindled an incre-dible ardour in all
                    ranks of men.</p>
                <p>Demetrius, having planted all his engines, began to batter with incredible fury
                    the walls on the ſide of the harbour ; but was for eight days ſucceſſively
                    repulſed by the beſieged, who ſet ſire to moſt of his warlike en-gines, and
                    thereby obliged him to allow them ſome reſpite, which they made good uſe of in
                    repairing the breaches, and building new walls where the old ones were either
                    weak or low. when Demetrius had repaired his engines, he ordered a general
                    aſſault to be made, and cauſed his troops to advance with loud ſhouts, thinking
                    by this means to ſtrike terror into the enemy. But the beſieged were ſo ſar from
                    being intimidated, that they repulſed the aggreſſors with great ſlaughter, and
                    performed the moſt aſtoniſhing feats of bravery. Demetrius returned to the
                    aſſault next day ; but was in the fame manner forced to retire, after having
                    loſt a great number of men, and ſome officers of diſtinction. He had ſeized, at
                    his ſirſt landing, an eminence at a fmall diſtance from the city ; and, having
                    fortified this advantageous poſt, he cauſed ſeveral batteries to be erected
                    there, with engines, which inceſſantly diſcharged</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r01-0217" facs="gri_33125011196389_0223.tif"/>
                <p>againſt the walls ſtones of 150 pounds weight. The towers, being thus furiouſly
                    battered night and day, began to totter, and ſeveral breaches were opened in the
                    walls : but the Rhodians, unexpectedly ſallying out, drove the enemy from their
                    poſt, overturned their machines, and made a moſt dreadful havock ; inſomuch that
                    ſome of them retired on board their veſſels, and were with much ado prevailed
                    upon to come aſhore again.</p>
                <p>Demetrius now ordered a ſcalade by ſea and land at the ſame time ; and ſo
                    employed the beſieged, that they were at a loſs what place they ſhould chiefly
                    de-fend. The attack was carried on with the utmoſt fury onall ſides, and the
                    beſieged defended themſelves with the greateſt intrepidity. Such of the enemy as
                    advan-ced firſt were thrown down from the ladders, and mi-ſerably bruiſed.
                    Several of the chief officers, having mounted the walls to encourage the
                    ſoldiers by their example, were there either killed or taken priſon-ers. After
                    the combat had laſted many hours, with great ſlaughter on both ſides, Demetrius,
                    notwith-ſtanding all his valour, thought it neceſſary to retire, in order to
                    repair his engines, and give his men ſome days reft,</p>
                <p>Demetrius being ſenſible that he could not reduce the city till he was maſter of
                    the port, after having refreſhed his men, he returned with new vigour againſt
                    the fortifications which defended the entry into the harbour, when he came
                    within the caſt of a dart, he cauſed a vaſt quantity of burning torches and
                    firebrands to be thrown into the Rhodian ſhips, which were riding there ; and at
                    the fame time galled, with dreadful ſhowers of darts, arrows, and ſtones, ſuch
                    as offered to extinguiſh the flames. However, in ſpite of their utmoſt efforts,
                    the -Rhodians put a ſtop to the fire ; and, having with great expedition manned
                    three of their ſtrongeſt ſhips, drove with ſuch violence againſt the veſſels on
                    which the enemy’s machines were planted, that they were ſhattered in pieces, and
                    the engines diſmounted and thrown into the ſea. Exceſtus the Rhodian admiral,
                    being encouraged by this ſuccefs, attacked the enemy’s fleet with his three
                    ſhips, and ſunk a great many veſſels ; but was himſelf at laſt taken priſoner :
                    the other two veſſels made their eſcape, and</p>
                <p>regained the port.</p>
                <p>As unfortunate as this laſt attack had proved to De-metrius, he determined to
                    undertake another ; and, in order to ſucceed in his attempt, he ordered a
                    machine of a new invention to be built, which was thrice the height and breadth
                    of thoſe he had lately loſt. when the work was finiſhed, he cauſed the engine to
                    be placed near the port, which he was reſolved, at all adventures, to force. But
                    as it was upon the point of entering the harbour, a dreadful ſtorm ariſing,
                    drove it againſt the ſhore, with the veſſels on which it had been reared. The
                    beſieged, who were attentive to improve all favourable conjunctures, while the
                    tempeſt was ſtill raging, made a ſally againſt thoſe who defended the eminence
                    mentioned above ; and, though repulſed ſeveral times, carried it at laſt,
                    obliging the Demetrians, to the number of 400, to throw down their arms and
                    ſubmit. After this victory gained by the Rhodians, there arrived to their aid
                    150 Gnoſ-ſians, and 500 men fent by Ptolemy from Egypt, moſt of them being
                    natives of Rhodes, who had ſerved among the king’s troops.</p>
                <p>Demetrius being extremely mortified toſee all his batteries againſt the harbour
                    rendered ineffectual, re-ſolved to employ them by land, in hopes of carrying the
                    city by aſſault, or at leaſt reducing it to the neceſſity of capitulating, with
                    this view, having got together avaſt quantity of timber and other materials, he
                    framed the famous engine called <hi rend="italic">helepolis,</hi> which was by
                    many degrees larger than any that, had ever been invented before. Tts baſis was
                    fquare, each ſide being in length near 50 cubits, and made up of ſquare pieces
                    of timber, bound together with plates of iron. In the middle part he placed
                    thick planks, about a cubit diſtance from each other ; and on theſe the men were
                    to ſtand who forced the engine forward. The whole was moved upon eight ſtrong
                    and large wheels, whoſe felloes were ſtrengthened with ſtrong iron plates. In
                    order to facilitate and vary the move-ments of the helepolis, caſters were
                    placed under it, whereby it was turned in an inſtant to what ſide the workmen
                    and engineers pleaſed. From each of the four angles a large pillar of wood was
                    carried to about the height of 100 cubits, and inclining to each other; the
                    whole machine conſiſting of nine ſtories, whoſe dimenſions gradually leſſened in
                    the aſcent. The firſt ſtory was ſupported by 43 beams, and the laſt by no more
                    than nine. Three ſides of the machine were plated over with iron, to prevent its
                    being damaged by the fire that might be thrown from the city. In the front of
                    each ſtory were windows of the ſame ſize and ſhape as the engines that were to
                    be diſcharged from thence. To each window were ſhutters, to draw up for the
                    defence of thoſe who managed the machines, and to deaden the force of the ſtones
                    thrown by the enemy, the ſhutters being covered with ſkins ſtuffed with wool.
                    Every ſtory was furniſhed with two large ſtaircaſes, that whatever was neceſſary
                    might be brought up by one, while others were going down by the other, and ſo
                    every thing may be diſpatched without tumult or confuſion. This huge machine was
                    moved forwards by 3000 of the ſtrongeſt men of the whole army ; but the art with
                    which it was built greatly facilitated the motion. Demetrius cauſed likewiſe to
                    be made ſeveral teſtudoes or pent houſes, to cover his men while they advanced
                    to ſill up the trenches and ditches ; and invented a new ſort of galleries,
                    through which thoſe who were employed at the ſiege might paſs and re-paſs at
                    their pleaſure, without the leaſt danger. He employed all his ſeamen in
                    levelling the ground over which the machines were to be brought up, to the ſpace
                    of four furlongs. The number of workmen who were employed on this occaſion
                    amounted to 30,000.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, the Rhodians, obſerving theſe formidable preparations, were
                    buſy in raiſing a new wall within that which the enemy intended to batter with
                    the helepolis. In order to accompliſh this work, they pulled down the wall which
                    ſurrounded the theatre, ſome neighbouring houſes, and even ſome temples, after
                    having ſolemnly promiſed to build more magnifi-cent ſtructures in honour of the
                    gods, if the city were preſerved. At the ſame time, they ſent out nine of their
                    beſt ſhips to ſeize ſuch of the enemy’s veſſels as they could meet with, and
                    thereby diſtreſsthem for</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r01-0218" facs="gri_33125011196389_0224.tif"/>
                <p>want of proviſions. As thefe ſhips were commanded by their braveſt ſea-officers,
                    they ſoon returned with an immenſe booty, and a great many priſoners. Among
                    other veffels, they took a galley richly laden, on board of which they ſound a
                    great variety of valuable ſurni-ture, and a royal robe, which Phila herſelf had
                    wrought and ſent as a preſent to her huſhand Demetrius, accompanied with a
                    letter written with her own hand. The Rhodians ſent the furniture, the royal
                    robe, and even the letter, to Ptolemy ; which exaſperated Deme-trius to a great
                    degree.</p>
                <p>while Demetrius was preparing to attack the city, the Rhodians having affembled
                    the people and magiſtrates to conſult about the meaſures they ſhould take, ſome
                    propoſed in the affembly tbe pulling down of tlie ſtatues of Antigonus and his
                    ſon Demetrius, wliich till then had been held in the utmoſt veneration. But this
                    propoſal was generally rejected with indignation, and their prudent conduct
                    greatly allayed the wrath both of Antigonus and Demetrius. However, the latter
                    continued to carry on the ſiege with the utmoſt vigour, thinking it would
                    reflect no ſmall diſhonour on him were he obliged, to quit the place without
                    making himſelf maſter of it. He cauſed the walls to be ſecretly undermined :
                    but, when they were ready to ſall, a deſcrter very opportunely gave notice of
                    the whole to the townſmen ; who haviag, with all expedition, drawn a deep trench
                    all along the wall, began to countermine, and, meeting the enemy under ground,
                    obliged them to abandon the work, while both parties guarded the mines, one
                    Athenagoras a Mileſian, who had been ſent to the affiſtance of the Rhodians by
                    Ptolemy with a body of mercenaries, promiſed to betray the city to the
                    Demetrians, and let them in thro’ the mines in the night-time. But- this was
                    only in order to enſnare them ; for Alexander, a noble Ma-cedonian, whom
                    Demetrius had ſent with a choice body of troops to take poffeffion of a poſt
                    agreed on, no ſooner appeared, but he was taken priſoner by the Rhodians, who
                    were waiting for him under arms. — Athenagoras was crowned by the ſenate with a
                    crown of gold, and preſented with ſive talents of ſilver.</p>
                <p>Demetrius now gave over all thoughts of undermining the walls, and placed all
                    his hopes of reducing the city in the battering-engines which he had contrived.
                    Having therefore levelled the ground under the walls, he brought up his
                    helepolis, with four teſtudoes on each ſide of it. Two other teſtudoes of an
                    extraordinary ſize, bearing battering-rams, were like-wife moved forwards by
                    1000 men. Each ſtory of the helepolis was ſilled with all ſorts of engines for
                    diſcharging of ſtones, arrows, and darts, when all things were ready, Demetrius
                    ordered the ſignal to be given ; when his men, ſetting up a ſhout, affaulted the
                    city on all ſides both by ſea and land. But, in the heat of the attack, when the
                    walls were ready to fall by the repeated ſtrokes of the battering-rams, am
                    baſſadors arrived from Cnidus, earneſtly ſolicſting Demetrius to fuſpend all
                    further hoſtilities, and at the fame time giving him hopes that they ſhould
                    prevail upon the Rhodians to ſubmit to an honourable capitulation. A fuſpenfipn
                    of arms was accordingly agreed on, and ambaſſadors fent from both ſſdes. But the
                    Rhodians refaſmg to capitulate on the conditions Offered them, the attack was
                    renewed with ſo much fury, and the machines played off in ſo briſk a manner,
                    that a large tower built with ſquare ſtones, and the wall that flanked it, were
                    battered down. The beſie-ged, nevertheleſs, fought in the breach with fo much
                    courage and reſolution, that the enemy, after various unſucceſsſul attempts,
                    were forced to abandon the en-tepriſe, and retire.</p>
                <p>In this conjuncture, a fleet which Ptolemy had freighted with 300,000 meaſures
                    of corn, and different kinds of pulſe for the ufe of the Rhodians, ar-rived very
                    ſeaſonably in the port, nothwithſtandiug the vigilance of the enemy’s ſhips,
                    which cruized on the coaſts of the iſſand to ſurpriſe them. A few days after
                    came in fafe two other fleets, one ſent by Caf-ſander, with 100,000 buſhels of
                    barley; the other by Lyſimachus, with 400,000 buſhcts of corn and as many oſ
                    barley. This ſeaſonable and plentiful ſupply arriving when the city began to
                    ſuffer for want of proviſions, inſpired the beſieged with new courage, and
                    raiſed their drooping ſpirits. Being thus animated, they formed a deſign of
                    ſetting the enemy’s engines on ſire ; and with this view ordered a body of men
                    to ſally out the night enſuing, about the ſecond watch, with torches and
                    ſirebrands, having ſirſt placed on the walls an incredible number of engines, to
                    diſcharge ſtones, arrows, darts, and fire-balls, againſt thoſe who ſhould
                    attempt to oppoſe their detachment. The Rhodian troops, purſuant to their
                    orders, all on a ſudden fallied out, and advancing, in ſpite of all oppoſition,
                    to the batteries, ſet them on ſire, while the engines from the walla played
                    inceffantly on thoſe who endeavoured to extinguiſh the flames. The Demetrians on
                    this occaſion fell in great numbers, being incapable, in the darknefs of the
                    -night, either to ſee the engines that continually difeharged ſhowers of ſtones
                    and arrows upon them, or to join in one body and repulſe the enemy. The
                    conflagration was ſo great, that ſeveral plates of iron falling from the
                    helepolis, that vaſt engine would have been entirely conſumed, had not the
                    troops that were ſtationed in it with all poffible fpeed quenched the fire with
                    water, before prepared, and ready in the apart-ments of the engine againſt ſueh
                    accidents. Deme-trius, fearing leſt all his machines ſhould be conſumed, called
                    together, by ſound of trumpet, thoſe whoſe province it was to move them ; and,
                    by their help, brought them off before they were entirely deſtroyed. When it was
                    day, he commanded all the darts and arrows that had been ſhot by the Rhodians to
                    be carefully gathered, that he might from their number form ſome judgement of
                    the number of machines in the city. Above 800 firebrands were found on the fpot,
                    and no fewer than 1500 darts, all diſcharged in a very ſmall portion of the
                    night. This ſtruck the prince himſelf with no ſmall terror ; for he never
                    imagined that they would have been able to bear the charges of ſuch formidable
                    preparations. However, after having cauſed the ſſain to be buried, and given
                    directions for the curing of the wounded, he applied himſelf to the repairing of
                    his machines, which had bccn diſmounted and rendered quite unſerviceable.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, the 'beſieged, improving the reſpite allowed them by the
                    removal of the machines, built a third wall in the form of a crefcent, which
                    took in all that part that was moſt expoſed to the enemy s batteries ; and,
                    beſides, drew a deep trench behind the</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r01-0219" facs="gri_33125011196389_0225.tif"/>
                <p>breach, to prevent the enemy from entering the city that way. At the ſeme time,
                    they detached a ſquadron of their beſt ſhips, under the command of Amyntas, who
                    made over to the continent of Alia ; and there meeting with ſome privateers who
                    were commiſſioned by Demetrius, took both the ſhips and the men, among whom were
                    Timocles the chief of the pirates, and ſeveral other officers of diſtinction
                    belonging to the fleet of Demetrius. On their return, they fell in with ſeveral
                    veſſels laden with corn for the enemy’s camp, which they likewiſe took,, and
                    brought into the port. Theſe were ſoon followed by a numerous fleet of ſmall
                    veſſels loaded with corn and proviſions ſent them by Ptolemy, together with 1500
                    men, commanded by Antigonus a Macedonian of great experience in military
                    affairs.— Demetrius, in the mean time, having repaired his machines, brought
                    them up anew to the walls ; which he inceſſantly battered till he opened a great
                    breach and threw down ſeveral towers. But when he came to the aſſault, the
                    Rhodians, under the command of Aminias, defended themfelves with ſuch refolution
                    and intrepidity, that he was in three ſucceſſive attacks repulſed with great
                    laughter, and at laſt forced to retire. The Rhodians likewiſe, on this occaſion,
                    loſt ſeveral officers ; and amongſt others, the brave Aminias their commander.</p>
                <p>while the Rhodians were thus ſignalizing 'them-ſelves in the defence of their
                    country, a ſecond embaſſy arrived at the camp of Demetrius from Athens and the
                    other cities of Greece, ſoliciting Demetrius to compote matters, and ſtrike up a
                    peace with the Rhodians. At the requeſt of the ambaſſadors, who were in all
                    above 50, a ceſſation of arms was agreed upon; but the terms offered by
                    Demetrius being anew rejected by the Rhodians, the ambaſſadors returned home
                    without being able to bring the contending parties to an agreement. Hoſtilities
                    were therefore renewed; and Demetrius, whoſe imagination was fertile in
                    expedients for ſucceeding in his projects, formed a detachment of 1500 of his
                    beſt troops, under the conduct of Alcimus and Mancius, two officers of great
                    reſolution and <hi rend="italic">experience,</hi> ordering them to enter the
                    breach at mid-night, and, forcing the entrenchment behind it, to poſſeſs
                    themſelves of the polls about the theatre, where it would be no difficult matter
                    to maintain themſelves againſt any efforts of the townſmen. In order to
                    facilitate the execution of fo important and dangerous an undertaking, and amuſe
                    the enemy with falſe attacks, he at the ſame time, upon a ſignal given, ordered
                    the reft of the army to ſet up a ſhout, and attack the city on all ſides both by
                    ſea and land. By this means he hoped that, the beſieged being alarmed in all
                    parts, his detachment might find an opportunity of forcing the entrenchments
                    which covered the breach, and afterwards of ſeizing the advantageous poll about
                    the theatre. This feint had all the ſucceſs the prince could expect ; for the
                    troops having ſet up a ſhout from all quarters, as if they were advancing to a
                    general nſſault, the detachment commanded by Alcimus and Mancius entered the
                    breach, and fell upon thoſe who defended the ditch, and the wall that covered
                    it, with ſuch vigour, that, having ſlain the moſt part of them and put the reſt
                    in confuſion, they advanced to the theatre, and ſeized on the poſt adjoining to
                    it. This occaſioneda general uproar in the city, as if it hadbeen already taken
                    : but the commanding officers diſpatched orders to the ſoldiers on the ramparts
                    not to quit their poſts, nor ſtir from their reſpective ſtations. Having thus
                    ſecured the walls, they put themſelves at the head of a choſen body of their own
                    troops, and of thoſe who were lately come from Egypt, and with theſe charged the
                    enemy’s detachment. But the darkneſs of the night prevented them from diſlodging
                    the enemy and regaining the advantageous poſts they had ſeized. Day, however, no
                    ſooner appeared, than they renewed their attack with wonderful bravery. The
                    Demetrians without the walls, with loud ſhouts endeavoured to animate thoſe who
                    had entered the place, and inſpire them with resolution to maintain their ground
                    till they were relieved with freſh troops. The Rhodians being ſenſible that
                    their fortunes, liberties, and all that was dear to them in the world, lay at
                    ſtake, fought like men in the utmoſt deſpair, the enemy defending their poſts
                    for ſeveral hours without giving ground in the leaſt. At length the Rhodians,
                    encouraging each other to exert themfelves in defence of their country, and
                    animated by the example of their leaders, made a laſt effort, and, breaking into
                    the very heart of the enemy’s battalion, there killed both their commanders.
                    After their death the reſt were eaſily put in diforder, and all to a man either
                    killed or taken prifoners. The Rhodians like-wile on this occaſion loſt many of
                    their beſt commanders ; and among the reſt Damotetis, their chief magiſtrate, a
                    man of extraordinary valour, who had ſignalized himſelf during the whole time of
                    the ſiege.</p>
                <p>Demetrius, not at all diſcouraged by this check, was making the neceſſary
                    preparations for a new aſſault, when he received letters from his father
                    Antigonus, enjoining him to conclude a peace with the Rhodians upon the beſt
                    terms he could get, left he ſhould loſe his whole army in the ſiege of a lingle
                    town. From this time Demetrius wanted only ſome plauſible pretence for breaking
                    up the ſiege. The Rhodians likewiſe were now more inclined to come to an
                    agreement than formerly ; Ptolemy having acquainted them that he intended to
                    tend a great quantity of corn, and 3000 men to their aſſiſtance, but that he
                    would firſt have them try whether they could make up matters with Demetrius upon
                    reaſonable terms. At the fame time ambaſſadors arrived from the Ætolian
                    republic, ſoliciting the contending parties to put an cnd to a war which might
                    involve all the eaſt in endleſs calamities.</p>
                <p>An accident which happened to Demetrius in this conjuncture, did not a little
                    contribute towards the wiſhed-for pacification. This prince was preparing to
                    advance his helepolis againſt the city, when a Rhodian engineer found means to
                    render it quite uſeleſs. He undermined the tract of ground over which the
                    helepolis was to paſs the next day in order to approach the walls. Demetrius,
                    not ſuſpecting any ſtratagem of this nature, cauſed the engine to be moved
                    forward, which coming to the place that was undermined, ſunk ſo deep into the
                    ground that it was impoſſible to draw it out again. This misfortune, if we
                    believe Vegetius and Vitruvius, determined Demetrius to hearken to the Ætolian
                    ambaſſadors, and at laſt to ſtrike up a peace upon the following conditions:
                    That the republic of Rhodes ſhould be maintained in the full enjoyment of their
                    ancient rights, privileges, and liberties, without any foreign garriſon ; that
                    they ſhould renew their ancient alliance</p>

                <p>with Antigonus, and affiſt him in his wars againſt all ſtates and princes except
                    Ptolemy king of Egypt ; and that,Tor the effectual performance of the articles
                    ſtipu-lated between them, they ſhould deliver ioo hoſtages, ſuch as Demetrius
                    ſhould make choice of, except thoſe who bore any public employment.</p>
                <p>Thus was the ſiege raiſed, after it had continued a whole year ; and the
                    Rhodians amply rewarded all thoſe who had diſtinguiſhed themſelves in the
                    ſervice of their country. They alſo ſet up ſtatues to Ptolemy, Caffander, and
                    Lyſimachus ; to all of whom they paid the higheſt honours, eſpecially to the
                    ſirſt, whom they worſhipped as a god. Demetrius at his departure preſented them
                    with the helepolis, and all the other machines which he had employed in
                    battering the city ; from the ſale of which, with ſome additional ſums of their
                    own, they erected the famous coloffus. After this they applied themfelves
                    entirely to trade and navigation ; by which means they became quite maſters of
                    the ſea, and much more opulent than any of the neigh-bouring nations. As far as
                    lay in their power, they endeavoured to preſerve a neutrality with regard to the
                    jarring nations of the eaſt. However, they could not avoid a war with the
                    Byzantines, the occaſion oſ which was as follows : The Byzantines being obliged
                    to pay a yearly tribute of 80 talents to the Gauls, in order to raife this ſum,
                    they came to a refolution of laying a toll on all ſhips that traded to the
                    Pontic ſea. This reſolu-tion provoked the Rhodians, who were a trading nation,
                    above all the reſt. For this reafon they immedi-ately diſpatched ambaſſadors to
                    the Byzantines, complaining of the new tax ; but as the Byzantines had no other
                    method of ſatisfying the Gauls, they perfiſted in their reſolution. The Rhodians
                    now declared war, and prevailed upon Pruſſas king of Bithynia, and Attalus king
                    of Pergamus, to affiſt them ; by which confederacy the Byzantines were ſo
                    intimidated, that they agreed to exact no toll from ſhips trading to the Pontic
                    ſea, the demand which had been the occaſion of the war.</p>
                <p>About this time happened a dreadful earthquake, which threw down the coloſſus,
                    the arſenal, and great part of the city-walls of Rhodes <hi rend="italic">y</hi> which calamity the Rhodians improved to their advantage, ſending
                    ambaſſadors to all the Grecian princes and ſtates, to whom their loſſes were ſo
                    much exaggerated, that their countrymen obtained immenſe ſums of money under
                    pretence of repairing them. Hiero king of Syracuſe preſented them with 100
                    talents ; and, beſides, exempted from all tolls and duties ſuch as traded to
                    Rhodes. Ptolemy king of Egypt gave them ico talents, a million of mea-fures of
                    wheat, materials for building 20 quinqueremes and the like number of triremes ;
                    and, beſides, ſent them 100 architects, 300 workmen, and materials for tepairing
                    their public buildings, to a great value, pay-ing them moreover 14 talents
                    a-year for the mainte-nance of the workmen whom he ſent them. Antigo-Bus gave
                    them 100 talents of ſilver, with 10,000 pieces of timber, each piece being 16
                    cubits long ; 7000 planks ; 3000 pounds of iron, as many of pitch and re-Jin,
                    and 1000 meaſures of tar. Chryſeis, a woman of diftinction, ſent them 100,000
                    meaſures of wheat, and 3000 pounds of lead. Antiochus exempted from all taxes
                    and duties the Rhodian ſhips trading to his do-ttinioas i preſented them with 10
                    galley s, and 200,000</p>
                <p>meafures of corn, with many other things of great value. Pruſias, Mithridates,
                    and all the princes then reigning in Aſia, made them proportionable preſents :
                    in ſhort, all the Greek towns and nations, all the princes of Europe and Aſia,
                    contributed, according to their ability, to the relief of the Rhodians on that
                    occa« ſion ; inſomuch that their city not only ſoon rofe from its ruins, but
                    attained to an higher pitch of ſplendor than ever.</p>
                <p>In the year 203 B. C. the Rhodians engaged in a war with Philip of Macedon. This
                    monarch had invaded the territories of Attalus king of Pergamus ; and becauſe
                    the Rhodians ſeemed to favour their ancient friend, ſent one Heraclides, by
                    birth a Tarentine, to ſet ſirc to their fleet ; at the ſame time that he
                    diſpatch-ed ambaffadors into Crete, in order to ſtir up the Cretans againſt the
                    Rhodians, and prevent them from ſending any affiſtance to Attalus. Upon this war
                    was im-mediately proclaimed. Philip at ſiril gained an incon-ſiderable advantage
                    in a naval engagement ; but the next year was defeated with the lofs of 11,000
                    men, while the Rhodians loſt but 60 men and Attalus 70. After this he carefully
                    avoided coming to an engagement at ſea either with Attalus or the Rhodians. The
                    combined fleet, in the mean time, faffed towards the iſland of Ægina in hopes of
                    intercepting him : but having failed in their purpoſe, they failed to Athens,
                    where they concluded a treaty with that people ; and,, on their return, drew all
                    the Cyclades into a confederacy againſt Philip. But while tlie allies were
                    thus-walling xheir time in négociations, Philip, having divided his forces into
                    two bodies, ſent one, under the cum· rhand of Philocles, to ravage the Athenian
                    territories £ and put the other aboard his fleet, with orders to ſail to
                    Meronea·, a city on the north ſide of Thrace. He then marched towards that city
                    himſelf with a body of forces, took it by affault, and reduced a great many
                    others ; ſo that the confederates would, in all pro-bability, have had little
                    reaſon to boaſt of their succeſs, had not the Romans come to their afliftance,
                    by whoſe help the war was foon terminated to their advantage. In the war which
                    took place between the Romans and Antiochus the Great king of Syria, the
                    Rhodians were very uſeful allies to the former. The beſt part of their fleet was
                    indeed delhoyed by a trea-cherous contrivance of Polyxeniades the Syrian
                    admi-ral ; but they ſoon fitted out another, and defeated a. Syrian iquudron
                    commanded by the celebrated Hannibal, the Carthaginian commander ; after which,
                    in con-junction with the Romans, they utterly defeated the whole Syrian fleet
                    commanded by Polyxeniades ; which, together with the lofs of the battle of
                    Magneſia, ſo di-ſpirited Antiochus, that he ſubmitted to whatever eon-ditions
                    the Romans pleaſed.</p>
                <p>For theſe ſerviees the Rhodians were rewarded with the provinces oſ Lycia and
                    Cana ; but tyrannizing over the people in a terrible manner, the Lycians applied
                    to the Romans for protection. This was readily granted ; but the Rhodians were
                    ſo much diſpleaſed with their interfering in this matter, that they ſecretly
                    favoured Perſes in the war which broke out between him and the Roman republic.
                    For this offence the two provinces above-mentioned were taken ſrom them ; but
                    the Rhodians, having baniſhed or put death thoſe who had favoured Perſes, were
                    again admitted into ſa-</p>

                <p>vour, and greatly honoured by the ſenate. In the Mithridatic war, their alliance
                    with Rome brought upon them the king of Pontus with all his force; but having
                    loſt the greateſt part of his fleet before the city, he was obliged to raiſe the
                    ſiege without performing any remarkable exploit. In the war which Pompey made on
                    the Cilician pirates, the Rhodians aſſiſted him with all their naval force, and
                    had a great ſhare in the victories which he gained. In the civil war between
                    Cæſar and Pompey, they aſſiſted the latter with a very numerous fleet. After his
                    death they ſided with Cæſar; which drew upon them the reſentment of C. Caſſius,
                    who advanced to the iſland of Rhodes with a powerful fleet, after having reduced
                    the greateſt part of the continent. The Rhodians, terrified at his approach,
                    ſent ambaſ-ſadors intreating him to make up matters in an amicable manner, and
                    promiſing to ſtand neuter, and recal the ſhips which they had ſent to the
                    aſſiſtance of the triumviri. Caſſius inſiſted upon their delivering up their
                    fleet to him, and putting him in poſſeſſion both of their harbour and city. This
                    demand the Rhodians would by no means comply with, and therefore began to put
                    themſelves in a condition to ſtand a ſiege; but firſt ſent Archelaus, who had
                    taught Caſſius the Greek tongue while he ſtudied at Rhodes, to intercede with
                    his diſciple in their behalf. Archelaus could not, with all his authority,
                    prevail upon him to moderate his demands; wherefore the Rhodians, having created
                    one Alexander, a bold and enterpriſing man, their prætor or prytanis, equipped a
                    fleet of 33 ſail, and ſent it out under the command of Mnaſeus, an experienced
                    ſea-officer, to offer Caſſius battle. Both fleets fought with incredible
                    bravery, and the victory was long doubtful: but the Rhodians, being at length
                    overpowered by numbers, were forced to return with their fleet to Rhodes; two of
                    their ſhips being ſunk, and the reſt very much damaged by the heavy ſhips of the
                    Romans. This was the firſt time, as our author obſerves, that the Rhodians were
                    fairly overcome in a ſea-fight.</p>
                <p>Caſſius, who had beheld this fight from a neighbouring hill, having refitted his
                    fleet, which had been no leſs damaged than that of the Rhodians, repaired to
                    Loryma, a ſtronghold on the continent belonging to the Rhodians. This caſtle he
                    took by aſſault; and from hence conveyed his land-forces, under the conduct of
                    Fannius and Lentulus, over into the iſland. His fleet Conſiſted of 80 ſhips of
                    war and above 203 tranſports. The Rhodians no ſooner ſaw this mighty fleet
                    appear, but they went out again to meet the enemy. The ſecond engagement was far
                    more bloody than the firſt; many ſhips were ſunk, and great numbers of men
                    killed on both ſides. But victory anew declared for the Romans; who immediately
                    blocked up the city of Rhodes both by ſea and land. As the Rhodians had not had
                    time to furniſh the city with ſufficient ſtore of proviſions, ſome of the
                    inhabitants, fearing that if it were taken either by aſſault or by famine,
                    Caſſius would put all the inhabitants to the ſword, as Brutus had lately done at
                    Xanthus, privately opened the gate to him, and put him in poſſeſſion of the
                    town, which he nevertheleſs treated as if it had been taken by aſſault. He
                    commanded 50 of the chief citizens, who were ſu-ſpected to favour the adverſe
                    party, to be brought before him, and ſentenced them all to die; others, to the
                    number of 25, who had commanded the fleet or army</p>
                <p>becauſe they did not appear when ſummoned, he pro-ſcribed. Having thus puniſhed
                    ſuch as had either acted or ſpoken againſt him or his party, he commanded the
                    Rhodians to deliver up to him all their ſhips, and whatever money they had in
                    the public treaſury. He then plundered the temples; ſtripping them of all their
                    valuable furniture, veſſels, and ſtatues. He is ſaid not to have left one ſtatue
                    in the whole city, except that of the ſun; bragging, at his departure, that he
                    had ſtripped the Rhodians of all they had, leaving them nothing but the ſun. As
                    to private perſons, he commanded them, under ſevere penalties, to bring to him
                    all the gold and ſilver they had, promiſing, by a public crier, a tenth part to
                    ſuch as ſhould diſcover any hidden trea-ſures. The Rhodians at firſt concealed
                    ſome part of their wealth, imagining that Caſſius intended by this proclamation
                    only to terrify them; but when they found he was in earneſt, and ſaw ſeveral
                    wealthy citizens put to death for concealing only a ſmall portion of their
                    riches, they deſired that the time prefixed for the bringing in their gold and
                    ſilver might be prolonged. Caſſius willingly granted them their requeſt; and
                    then through fear they dug up what they had hid under ground, and laid at his
                    feet all they were worth in the world. By this means he extorted from private
                    perſons above 8000 talents. He then fined the city in 500 more; and leaving L.
                    Varus there with a ſtrong garriſon to exact the fine without any abatement, he
                    returned to the continent.</p>
                <p>After the death of Caſſius, Marc Antony reſtored the Rhodians to their ancient
                    rights and privileges 5-beſtowing upon them the iſlands of Andros, Naxos, Tenos,
                    and the city of Myndus. But theſe the Rhodians ſo oppreſſed and loaded with
                    taxes, that the ſame Antony, though a great friend to the Rhodian republic, was
                    obliged to diveſt her of the ſovereignty over thoſe places, which he had a
                    little before ſo liberally beſtowed upon her. From this time to the reign of the
                    Emperor Claudius we find no mention made of the Rhodians. That prince, as Dion
                    informs us, deprived them of their liberty for having crucified ſome Roman
                    citizens. However, he ſoon reſtored them to their former condition, as we read
                    in Suetonius and Tacitus. The latter adds, that they had been as often deprived
                    of, as reſtored to, their liberty, by way of puniſhment or reward for their
                    different behaviour, as they had obliged the Romans with their aſſiſtance in
                    foreign wars, or provoked them with their ſeditions at home. Pliny, who wrote in
                    the beginning of Veſpaſian’s reign, ſtyles Rhodes a <hi rend="italic">beautiſul
                        and free town.</hi> But this liberty they did not long enjoy, the iſland
                    being ſoon after reduced by the lame Veſpaſian to a Roman province, and obliged
                    to pay a yearly tribute to their new mailers. This province was called the <hi
                        rend="italic"> province of the iſlands.</hi> The Roman pretor who governed
                    it reſided at Rhodes, as the chief city under his juriſdiction; and Rome,
                    notwith-ſtanding the eminemt ſervices rendered her by this republic, thenceforth
                    treated the Rhodians not as allies, but vaſſals.</p>
                <p>The iſland of Rhodes continued ſubject to the Romans till the reign of the
                    emperor Andronicus; when Villaret, grand-maſter of the knights of Jeruſalem,
                    then reſiding in Cyprus, finding himſelf much expoſed to the attacks of the
                    Saracens in that iſland, reſolved to exchange it for that of Rhodes. This iſland
                    too was</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0222" facs="gri_33125011196389_0228.tif"/>
                <p>almoſt entirely occupied by the Saracens; Andronicus the eaſtern emperor
                    poſſeſſing little more in it than a caſtle. Neverthleſs he refuſed to grant the
                    inveſtiture of the iſland to Villaret. The latter, without ſpending time in
                    fruitleſs negociations, ſailed directly for Rhodes, where he landed his troops,
                    proviſions, and warlike ſtores, in ſpite of the oppoſition made by the Saracens,
                    who then united againſt the common enemy. As Villaret foreſaw that the capital
                    muſt be taken before he could reduce the iſland, he inſtantly laid ſiege to it.
                    The inhabitants defended themſelves obſtinately, upon which the grand-maſter
                    thought proper to turn the ſiege into a blockade; but he ſoon found himſelf ſo
                    cloſely ſurrounded by the Greeks and Saracens, that he could get no ſupply
                    either of forage or proviſions for his army. But having at length obtained a
                    ſupply of proviſions by means of large ſums borrowed of the Florentines, he came
                    out of his trenches and attacked the Saracens, with a full reſolution either to
                    conquer or die. A bloody fight enſued, in which a great number of the braveſt
                    knights were killed: but at length the Saracens gave way, and fled to their
                    ſhips; upon which the city was immediately aſſaulted and taken. The</p>
                <p>Greeks and other Chriſtians had their lives and liberties given them, but the
                    Saracens were all cut to pieces. The reduction of the capital was followed by
                    that of all the other places of inferior ſtrength throughout the iſland; and in
                    four years after their landing, the whole was ſubjugated, and the conquerors
                    took the title of the <hi rend="italic">Knights of Rhodes.</hi> For many years
                    thoſe knights continued the terror of the Saracens and Turks, and ſuſtained a
                    ſevere ſiege from Mohammed II. who was compelled to abandon the enterpriſe; but
                    at length the Turkiſh ſultan Solyman reſolved at all events to drive them from
                    it. Before he undertook the expedition, he ſent a meſſage commanding them to
                    depart the iſland without delay; in which caſe he promiſed that neither they nor
                    the inhabitants ſhould ſuffer any injury, but threatened them with his utmoſt
                    vengeance if they refuſed his offer. The knights, however, proving ob-ſtinate,
                    Solyman attacked the city with a fleet of 400 ſail and an army of 140, 000 men.</p>
                <p>The trenches were ſoon brought cloſe to the coun-terſcarp, and a ſtrong battery
                    raiſed againſt the town; which, however, did but little damage, till the ſultan
                    being informed by a ſpy of this particular, and that he was in danger of
                    receiving ſome fatal ſhot from the tower of St John which overlooked his camp,
                    he planted a battery againſt that tower, and quickly brought it down. Solyman,
                    however, finding the whole place in ſome meaſure covered with ſtrong
                    fortifications of ſuch height as to command all his batteries, ordered an
                    immenſe quantity of ſtones and earth to be brought; in which ſo great a number
                    of hands were employed night and day by turns, that they quickly raiſed a couple
                    of hillocks high enough to overtop the city-walls. They plied them accordingly
                    with ſuch a continual fire, that the grand-maſter was obliged to cauſe them to
                    be ſtrongly propped within with earth and timber. All this while the beſieged,
                    who, from the top of the grand-maſter’s palace, could diſcover how their
                    batteries were planted, de-moliſhed them with their cannon almoſt as faſt as
                    they raiſed them.</p>
                <p>Here the enemy thought proper to alter their measures, and to plant a ſtrong
                    battery againſt the tower of</p>
                <p>St Nicholas, which, in the former ſiege by Mohammed, had reſiſted all the
                    efforts of the then grand-vizier. This the baſhaw of Romania cauſed to be
                    battered with 12 large pieces of braſs cannon, but had the mortification to ſee
                    them all diſmounted by thoſe of the tower; to prevent which in future, he
                    ordered them to be fired only in the night, and in the day had them covered with
                    gabions and earth. This had ſuch ſucceſs, that, alter 500 cannon-ſhot, the wall
                    began to ſhake and tumble into the ditch; but he was ſurpriſed to find another
                    wall behind it, well terraced, and bordered with artillery, and himſelf obliged
                    either to begin afreſh or give up the enterpriſe: and yet this laſt was what
                    Soly-ιhan preferred, when he was told of its being built on a hard rock,
                    incapable of being ſapped, and how firmly it had held out againſt all the effort
                    of Mohammed’s vizier. The next attack was therefore ordered by him to be made
                    againſt the baſtions of the town, and that with a vaſt number of the largeſt
                    artillery, which continued firing during a whole month; ſo that the new wall of
                    the baſtion of England was quite demoliſhed, though the old one ſtood proof
                    againſt all their ſhot. That of Italy, which was battered by 17 large pieces of
                    cannon, was ſtill worſe damaged; upon which Mar-tinengo the engineer adviſed the
                    grand-maſter to cauſe a ſally to be made on the trenches of the enemy out</p>
                <p>of the breach, whilſt he was making freſh entrenchments behind it. His advice
                    ſucceeded; and the 200 men that ſallied out ſword in hand having ſurpriſed the
                    Turks in the trench, cut moſt of them in pieces. At the ſame time a new
                    detachment, which was ſent to repulſe them, being obliged, as that engineer
                    rightly judged, to paſs by a ſpot which lay open to their artillery, were
                    likewiſe moſtly deſtroyed by the continual fire that came from it, whilſt the
                    aſſailants were employed in filling up ſeveral fathoms of the trench before they
                    retired. By that time the breach had been repaired with ſuch new works, that all
                    the efforts to mount it by aſſault proved equally ineffectual and de-ſtructive.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately for the beſieged, the continual fire they had made cauſed ſuch a
                    conſumption of their powder, that they began to feel the want of it; the
                    perfidious d’Amarald, whoſe province it had been to viſit the magazines of it,
                    having amuſed the council with a falſe report, that there was more than
                    ſufficient to maintain the ſiege, though it ſhould laſt a whole twelve-month.
                    But here the grand-maſter found means to ſupply in ſome meaſure that unexpected
                    defect, by the cautious provifion he had made of a large quantity of ſaltpetre,
                    which was immediately ground and made into gunpowder, though he was at the ſame
                    time obliged to order the engineers to be more ſparing of it for the future, and
                    to make uſe of it only in the defence of ſuch breaches as the enemy ſhould make.</p>
                <p>All this while the Turks had not gained an inch of ground; and the breaches they
                    had made were ſo ſud-denly either repaired or defended by new entrenchments,
                    that the very rubbiſh of them muſt be mounted by aſſault. Solyman, therefore,
                    thought it now adviſable to ſet his numerous pioneers at work, in five different
                    parts, in digging of mines, each of which led to the baſtion oppoſite to it.
                    Some of theſe were countermined by a new invented method of Martinengo; who, by
                    the help of braced ſkins, or drums, could diſcover</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0223" facs="gri_33125011196389_0229.tif"/>
                <p>where the miners were at work. Some of theſe he perceived, which he cauſed to be
                    opened, and the miners to be driven out by hand grenàdoes; others to be
                    ſmothered, or burned, by ſetting fire to gunpowder. Yet did not this hinder two
                    conſiderable ones to be ſprung, which did a vaſt deal of damage to the baſtion
                    of England, by throwing down about fix fathoms of the wall, and filling up the
                    ditch with its rubbiſh: whereupon the Turks immediately climbed up ſword in hand
                    to the top of it, and planted ſeven of their ſtan-dards upon the parapet; but
                    being ſtopped by a tra-verſe, the knights, recovering from their ſurpriſe, fell
                    upon them with ſuch fury, that they were obliged to abandon it with great loſs.
                    The grand-maſter, who was then at church, quickly came to the place with his
                    ſhort pike in his hand, attended by his knights, encouraging all he met with,
                    burghers, ſoldiers, and others, to fight bravely in defence of their religion
                    and country, and arrived time enough to aſſiſt in the taking down their
                    ſtandards, and driving down the enemy by the way they came up. In vain did the
                    vi-zier Muſtapha endeavour to prevent their flight by killing ſome of the
                    foremoſt with his ſword, and driving the reſt back; they were obliged to abandon
                    the ba-ſtion, and, which was ſtill worſe, met with that death in their flight,
                    which they had ſtrove to ſhun from the fire-arms which were diſcharged upon them
                    from the ramparts. Three ſangiacs loſt their lives in this attack, beſides ſome
                    thouſands of the Turks; the grand-maſter, on his ſide, loſt ſome of his braveſt
                    knights, particularly his ſtandard-bearer.</p>
                <p>The attacks were almoſt daily renewed with the ſame ill ſucceſs and loſs of men,
                    every general ſtriving. to ſig-nalize himſelf in the ſight of their emperor. At
                    length the old general Peri, or Pyrrus, having haraſſed the troops which guarded
                    the baſtion of Italy for ſeveral days ſucceſſively without intermiſſion, cauſed
                    a ſtrong detachment, which he had kept concealed behind a cavalier, to mount the
                    place by break of day, on the 13th of September; where, finding them overcome
                    with ſleep and fatigue, they cut the throats of the ſentinels, and, ſliding
                    through the breach, were juſt going to fall upon them. The Italians, however,
                    quickly recovered themſelves and their arms, and gave them an υb-ſtinate
                    repulfe. The conteſt was fierce and bloody on both ſides; and the baſhaw, ſtill
                    ſupplying his owe with new reinforcements, would hardly have failed of
                    overpowering the other, had not the grand maſter, whom the alarm had quickly
                    reached, timely intervened, and, by his preſence, as well as example, revived
                    his Rhodians, and thrown a ſudden panic among the enemy. Pyrrus, deſirous to do
                    ſomething to wipe off the diſ-grace of this repulſe, tried his fortune next on
                    an adjoining work, lately railed by the grand-maſter Carettii: but here his
                    ſoldiers met with a ſtill worſe treatment, being almoſt overwhelmed with the
                    hand-grenadoes, melted pitch, and boiling oil, which came pouring upon them,
                    whilſt the forces which were on the adjacent flanks made as great a ſlaughter of
                    thoſe that fled; in-ſomuch that the janiſſaries began to reſume their old
                    murmuring tone, and cry out that they were brought thither only to be
                    ſlaughtered.</p>
                <p>The grand vizier Muſtapha, afraid leſt their complaints ſhould reach his matter,
                    agreed at length, as the laſt reſort, to make a freſh attempt on the baſtion</p>
                <p>of England, whilſt, to cauſe a diverſion, the baſhaw Ahmed ſprung ſome freſh
                    mines at an oppoſite part of the city. This was accordingly executed on the 17th
                    of September; when the former, at the head of five battalions, reſolutely
                    mounted or rather crept up the breach, and, in ſpite of the fire of the Engliſh,
                    advanced ſo far as to pitch ſome ſtandards on the top; when, on a ſudden, a
                    crowd of Engliſh knights, commanded by one Bonk, or Burk, ſallied out of their
                    entrenchments, and, aſſiſted by ſome other officers of diſtinc-tion, obliged
                    them to retire, though in good order, Muſtapha, provoked at it, led them back,
                    and killed ſeveral knights with his own hand; and had his men ſupported him as
                    they ought, the place muſt have been yielded to him: but the fire which was made
                    from the adjacent batteries and muſketry diſconcerted them to ſuch a degree,
                    that neither threats nor entreaties could prevent their abandoning the
                    enterpriſe, and dragging him away with them by main force. The Rhodians loſt in
                    that action ſeveral brave knights, both Engliſh and German; and, in particular,
                    John Burk, their valiant commander: but the Turks loſt above 3000 men, beſides
                    many officers of diſtinction. Much the fame ill ſucceſs having attended Ahmed
                    with his mines, one of which had been opened, and the other only bringing ſome
                    fathoms of the wall down, he was alſo obliged to-retreat; his troops, though
                    ſome of the very beſt, being forced to diſperſe themſelves, after having borne
                    the fire and fury of the Spaniſh and Auvergnian knights as long as they were
                    able.</p>
                <p>By this time Solyman, aſhamed and exaſperated at his ill ſucceſs, called a
                    general council; in which he made ſome ſtinging reflections On his vizier, for
                    having repreſented the reduction of Rhodes as a very eaſy enterpriſe. To avoid
                    the effects of the ſultan’s reſent-ment, the ſubtle Muſtapha declared, that
                    hitherto they had fought the enemy as it were upon equal terms, as if they had
                    been afraid of taking an ungenerous advantage of their ſuperiority, by which,
                    ſaid he, we have given them an opportunity of oppoſing us with their united
                    force wherever we attacked them. But let us now reſolve upon a general aſſault
                    on ſeveral ſides of the town; and ſee what a poor defence their ſtrength, thus
                    divided, will be able to make againſt our united force. The advice was
                    immediately approved by all, and the time appointed for the execution of it was
                    on the 24th of that month, and every thing was ordered to be got ready againſt
                    that day. Accordingly the town was actually aſſaulted at four different parts,
                    alter having ſuffered a continual fire for ſome time from their artillery in
                    order to widen the breaches; by which the grand-maſter eaſily underſtood their
                    delign, and that the baſtions of England and Spain, the poſt of Provence, and
                    terrace of Italy, were pitched upon for the aſſault, and took his precautions
                    accordingly.</p>
                <p>The morning was no ſooner come, than each party mounted their reſpective breach
                    with an undaunted bravery, the young lultan, to animate them the more, having
                    ordered his throne to be reared on an eminence, whence he could ſee all that was
                    done. The Rhodians, on the other hand, were no leſs diligent in repulling them
                    with their cannon and other fire-arms, with their melted lead, boiling oil,
                    ſtink-pots, and other uſual expedients. The one ſide aſcend the ſcaling ladders,
                    ferleſs of all that oppoſed them; the other overturn</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0224" facs="gri_33125011196389_0230.tif"/>
                <p>their ladders and ſend them tumbling down headlong into the ditches, where they
                    were overwhelmed with ftones, or diſpatched with darts and other miſſile
                    weapons. The baſtion of England proves the ſcene of the greateſt ſlaughter and
                    bloodſhed; and the grand-maſter makes that his poſt of honour, and, by his
                    preſence and example, inſpires his men with freſh vigour and bravery, whilſt the
                    continual thunder of his artillery makes ſuch horrid work among the aſſailants
                    as chills all their courage, and forces them to give way: the
                    lieutenant-general, who commands the attack, leads them back with freſh vigour,
                    and mounts the breach at the head of all; immediately after comes a cannonball
                    from the Spaniſh baſtion, which overturns him dead into the ditch. This
                    diſaſter, inſtead of fear and dread, fills them with a furious deſire of
                    revenging his death: but all their obſtinacy cannot make the Rhodians go one
                    ſtep back, whilſt the prieſts, monks, young men and old, and even women of every
                    rank and age, aſſiſt them with an uncommon ardour and firmneſs; ſome in
                    overwhelming the enemy with ſtones; others in deſtroying them with melted lead,
                    ſulphur, and other combuſtibles; and a third ſort in ſupplying the combatants
                    with bread, wine, and other refreſh-ments.</p>
                <p>The aſſault was no leſs deſperate and bloody on the baſtion of Spain, where the
                    knights, who guarded it, not expecting to be ſo ſoon attacked, and aſhamed to
                    ſtand idle, were aſſiſting the baſtion of Italy; which gave the Turks an
                    opportunity to mount the breach, and penetrate as far as their intrenchments,
                    where they planted no leſs than 30 of their ſtandards on them. The grand-maſter
                    was quickly appriſed of it, and ordered the baſtion of Auvergne to play againſt
                    them; which was done with ſuch diligence, and ſuch continual fire, whilſt the
                    Rhodians enter the baſtion by the help of their caſemates, and, ſword in hand,
                    fall upon them with equal fury, that the Turks, alike beſet by the fire of the
                    artillery and the arms of the Rhodian knights, were forced to abandon the place
                    with a con-ſiderable loſs. The aga with great bravery rallies them afreſh, and
                    brings them back, by which time the grand-maſter likewiſe appeared. The fight
                    was renewed with greater fierceneſs; and ſuch ſlaughter was made on both ſides,
                    that the grand-maſter was obliged to draw 200 men out of St Nicholas tower to
                    his aſſiſtance: theſc were commanded by ſome Roman knights, who led them on with
                    ſuch ſpeed and bravery, that their very</p>
                <p>appearance on the baſtion made the janiſſaries draw back; which Solyman
                    obſerving from his eminence, cauſed a retreat to be ſounded, to conceal the
                    diſgrace of their flight. In theſe attacks there fell about 15, 000 of his belt
                    troops, beſides ſeveral officers of diſtinction. The loſs of the beſieged -was
                    no leſs conſiderable, if we judge from the ſmall number of their forces; but the
                    greateſt of all to them was that of tome of their braveſt and moſt diſtinguiſhed
                    knights and commanders, many of whom were killed, and ſcarce <hi rend="sup">,</hi> any eſcaped unwounded. But the moſt dreadful fate of all had like to have
                    fallen on the favourite vizier Muſtapha, who had pro-poſed this general aſſault:
                    the ill ſucceſs of which had ſo enraged the proud ſultan, that he condemned him
                    to be ſhot with arrows at the head of his army; which dreadful ſentence was juſt
                    ready to be executed, when the oldbaſhaw, by his intreaties, obtained a
                    ſuſpenſion of it, in hopes that, when his fury was abated, he ſhould alſo obtain
                    his pardon.</p>
                <p>Solyman, however, was ſo diſcouraged by his ill ſuc-ceſſes, that he was on the
                    point of raiſing the ſiege, and would have actually done fo, had he not been
                    diverted from it by the advice which he received from an Albanian deſerter, ſome
                    ſay by a letter from the traitor d'Amarald, that the far greater part of the
                    knights were either killed or wounded, and thoſe that remained altogether
                    incapable of ſuſtaining a freſh aſſault. This having determined him to try his
                    fortune once more, the command of his forces was turned over to the baſhaw
                    Achmed; and, to ſhow that he deſigned not to ſtir till he was maſter of the
                    place, he ordered a houſe to be built on the adjacent mount Philermo for his
                    winter-quarters. Achmed marched directly againſt the baſtion of Spain, which had
                    ſuffered the moſt; where, before he could open the trenches, his men fell thick
                    and threefold by the conſtant fire both of ſmall and great guns from the baſtion
                    of Auvergne. He loſt ſtill a much greater number in rearing a rampart of earth
                    to cover the attack, and give him an opportunity of ſapping the wall; and, as
                    ſoon as he ſaw a large piece fall, ordered his men to mount the breach. They
                    were no ſooner come to the top, than they found a new work and entrenchments
                    which Martinengo had reared; and there they were welcomed with ſuch a briſk fire
                    from the artillery, that they were glad to recover their trenches with the
                    utmoſt precipitation, after having loſt the much greater part of their men. The
                    attack was renewed, and a reciprocal fire continued with great obſtinacy, till a
                    muſket-ſhot deprived that indefatigable engineer of one of his eyes, and the
                    order of his aſſiduous ſervices for ſome time. The grand-maſter, having ordered
                    him to be carried to his palace, took his place, and kept it till he was quite
                    cured, which was not till 34 days after; and continued all the time in the
                    intrenchments with his handful of knights, ſcarcely allowing himſelf reſt night
                    or day, and ever ready to expoſe himſelf to the greateſt dangers, with an ardour
                    more becoming a junior officer than an old worn-out ſovereign; which made his
                    knights more laviſh of their own lives than their paucity and preſent
                    circum-ſtances could well admit of.</p>
                <p>Soon after this, the treaſon of D’Amarald was discovered, and he was condemned
                    to death and executed; but by this time the city was reduced to the laſt
                    extremity. The pope, emperor, and other crowned heads, had been long and often
                    importuned by the grand-maſter for ſpeedy aſſiſtance, without ſucceſs; and, as
                    an addition to all the other diſaſters, thoſe ſuc-cours which were ſent to him
                    from France and England periſhed at ſea. The new ſupply which he had ſent for of
                    proviſions from Candia had the ſame ill fate; ſo that the winds, ſeas, and every
                    thing, ſeemed combined to bring on the deſtruction of that city and order. The
                    only reſource which could be thought of, under ſo diſmal a ſituation, was, to
                    ſend for the few remaining knights and forces which were left to guard the other
                    iſlands, to come to the defence of their capital, in hopes that, if they could
                    ſave this, the others might in time be recovered, in caſe the Turks ſhould ſeize
                    upon them.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, Solyman, grown impatient at the ſmall ground his general had
                    gained, gave him expreſs orders to renew the attack with all imaginable ſpeed</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0225" facs="gri_33125011196389_0231.tif"/>
                <p>and vigour, before the ſuccours which he apprehended were coming from Europe,
                    obliged him to raiſe the ſiege. Achmed inſtantly obeyed, railed a battery of 17
                    large cannon againſt the baſtion of Italy, and quickly after made himſelf maſter
                    of it, obliging the garriſon to retire farther into the city. Here the
                    grand-maſter was forced to demoliſh two of the churches, to prevent the enemy’s
                    ſeizing on them; and, with their materials, cauſed ſome new works and
                    entrenchments to be made to hinder their proceeding farther.</p>
                <p>The Turks, however, gained ground every day, though they ſtill loſt vaſt numbers
                    of their men: at length the 30th of November came, when the grand-maſter, and
                    both the beſiegers and beſieged, thought the laſt aſſault was to be given. The
                    baſhaw Pyrrus, who commanded it, led his men directly to the entrenchments; upon
                    which the bells of all the churches ſounded the alarm. The grand-maſter, and his
                    few knights, troops, and citizens, ran in crowds, and in a confuſed diſorderly
                    manner, to the entrenchments, each fighting in his own way, or rather as his
                    fear directed him. This attack would have proved one of the moſt deſperate that
                    had yet been felt, had not a moſt vehement rain intervened, which carried away
                    all the earth which the enemy had reared to ſerve them as a rampart againſt the
                    artillery of the baſtion of Auvergne; ſo that being now quite expoſed to their
                    continual fire, they fell in ſuch great numbers, that the baſhaw could no longer
                    make them ſtand their ground, but all precipitately fled towards their camp.
                    This laſt repulfe threw the proud ſultan into ſuch a fury, that none of his
                    officers dared to come near him; and the ſhame of his having now ſpent near ſix
                    whole months with ſuch a numerous army before the place, and having loſt ſuch
                    myriads of his brave troops with ſo little advantage, had made him quite
                    deſperate, and they all dreaded the conſequences of his reſentment.</p>
                <p>Pyrrus at length, having given it time to cool, ventured to approach him, and
                    propoſe a new project to him, which, if approved, could hardly fail of ſucceſs;
                    which was, to offer the town a generous capitulation; and he obſerved, that in
                    caſe the ſtubborn knights ſhould reject it, yet being now reduced to ſo ſmall a
                    number, as well as their forces and fortifications almoſt deſtroyed, the
                    citizens, who were moſt of them Greeks, and leſs ambitious of glory than
                    ſolicitous for their own preſer-vation, would undoubtedly accept of any
                    compoſition that ſhould ſecure to them their lives and effects.</p>
                <p>This propoſal being reliſhed by the ſultan, letters were immediately diſperſed
                    about the city in his name, exhorting them to ſubmit to his government, and
                    threatening them at the fame time with the moſt dreadful effects of his
                    reſentment if they perſiſted in their obſtinacy. Pyrrus likewiſe diſpatched a
                    Genoeſe to approach as near as he could to the baſtion of Auvergne, and to
                    intreat the knights to take pity of ſo many of their Chriſtian brethren, and not
                    expoſe them to the dreadful effects which muſt follow their refuſal of a
                    capitulation, ſo generouſly offered them at their laſt extremity. Other agents
                    were likewiſe employed in other places: to all of whom the grand-maſter ordered
                    ſome of his men to return this anſwer, That his order never treated with
                    infidels but with ſword in hand. An Albanian was ſent next with a letter from
                    the ſultan to him, who met with the fame repulſe;</p>
                <p>after which, he ordered his men to fire upon any that ſhould preſent themſelves
                    upon the ſame pretence; which was actually done. But this did not prevent the
                    Rhodians from liſtening to the terms offered by the Turks, and holding frequent
                    cabals upon that ſub-ject; in which the general maſſacre of a town taken by
                    aſſault, the dreadful ſlavery of thoſe that eſcaped, the rape of their wives and
                    daughters, the deſtruction of their churches, the profanation of their holy
                    relics and ſacred utenſils, and other dire conſequences of an obſtinate refuſal,
                    being duly weighed againſt the ſul-tan’s offers, quickly determined them which
                    party to take. The grand-maſter, however, proving inexorable to all their
                    intreaties, they applied to their Greek metropolitan, who readily went and
                    repreſented all theſe things to him in the moſt pathetic terms: Yet he met with
                    no better reception; but was told, that he and his knights were determined to be
                    buried under the ruins of the city if their ſwords could no longer defend it,
                    and he hoped their example would not permit them to ſhow leſs courage on that
                    occaſion. This anſwer produced a quite contrary effect; and, as the citizens
                    thought delays dangerous at ſuch a juncture, they came in a body to him by the
                    very next morning, and plainly told him, that if he paid no greater regard to
                    their preſervation, they would not fail of taking the moſt proper meaſures to
                    preſerve the lives and chaſtity of their wives and children.</p>
                <p>This reſolution could not but greatly alarm the grand-maſter; who thereupon
                    called a council of all the knights, and informed them himſelf of the condition
                    of the place. Theſe all agreed, particularly the engineer Martinengo, that it
                    was no longer defenſible, and no other reſource left but to accept the ſultan’s
                    offers; adding, at the ſame time, that though they were all ready, according to
                    the obligations of their order, to fight to the laſt drop of their blood, yet it
                    was no leſs their duty to provide for the ſafety of the inhabitants, who, not
                    being bound by the ſame obligations, ought not to be made a ſacrifice to their
                    glory. It was therefore agreed, with the grand-maſter’s conſent, to accept of
                    the next offers the ſultan ſhould make. He did not let them wait long: for the
                    fear he was in of a freſh ſuccour from Europe, the intrepidity of the knights,
                    and the ſhame of being forced to raiſe the ſiege, prevailed upon him to hang out
                    his pacific flag, which was quickly anſwered by another on the Rhodian ſide;
                    upon which the Turks, coming out of their trenches, delivered up the ſultan’s
                    letter for the grand-maſter, to the grand-prior of St Giles, and the engineer
                    Martinengo. The terms offered in it by Soly-man appeared ſo advantageous, that
                    they immediately exchanged hoſtages; and the knights that were ſent to him had
                    the honour to be introduced to him, and to hear them confirmed by his own mouth,
                    though not without threats of putting all to fire and ſword in caſe of refuſal,
                    or even delay. Two ambaſſadors were forthwith ſent to him, to demand a truce of
                    three days to ſettle the capitulation and intereſts of the inhabitants, who were
                    part Greeks and part Latins; but this was abfolutely refuſed by the impatient
                    monarch, out of a ſuſpicion of the rumoured ſuccour being near, and that the
                    truce was only to gain time till it was come.</p>
                <p>He therefore ordered the hoſtilities to be renewed</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0226" facs="gri_33125011196389_0232.tif"/>
                <p>with ſreſh fury; in which the Rhodians made a moſt noble defence, conſidering
                    their ſmall number, and that they had now only the barbican or falſe bray of the
                    baſtion of Spain left to defend themſelves, and once more repulſed the enemy: at
                    which the ſultan was ſo enraged, that he reſolved to overpower them by numbers
                    on the next day; which was, after a ſtout defence, ſo effectually done, that
                    they were forced to abandon that outwork, and retire into the city. In the
                    meanwhile, the burghers, who had but a day or two before raiſed a freſh uproar
                    againſt the grand-maſter, under pretence that he was going to give them up a
                    prey to an infidel who regarded neither oaths nor ſolemn treaties, perceiving
                    their own danger, came now to deſire him to renew the negociations, and only
                    begged the liberty of ſending one of their deputies along with his, to ſecure
                    their intereſts in the capitulation. He readily conſented to it; but gave them a
                    charge to ſhow the baſhaw Achmed the treaty formerly concluded between Bajazet
                    and his predeceſſor d’Aubuſſon, in which the former had entailed a dreadful
                    curſe on any of his ſuc-ceſſors that ſhould infringe it. This was done, in hopes
                    that the ſhowing it to his maſter, who valued himſelf ſo much upon his ſtrict
                    obſervance of his law, might produce ſome qualm in him which might lengthen the
                    agreement, for they were ſtill as much in hopes of a ſuccour from Europe as he
                    was in fear of it; but to their great ſurpriſe, Achmed had no ſooner peruſed
                    than he tore it all in pieces, trampled it under his feet, and in a rage ordered
                    them to be gone. The grand-maſter found no other reſource than to fend them back
                    to him the next day; when that miniſter, who knew his matter’s impatience to
                    have the affair concluded, quickly agreed with them upon the terms, which were
                    in ſubſtance as follow:</p>
                <p>I. That the churches ſhould not be profaned. 2. That the inhabitants ſhould not
                    be forced to part with their children to be made janiſſaries. 3. That they
                    ſhould enjoy the free exerciſe of their religion. 4. That they ſhould be free
                    from taxes during five years. 5. That thoſe who had a mind to leave the iſland
                    ſhould have free leave to do ſo. 6. That iſ the grand-maſter and his knights had
                    not a ſufficient number of veſſels to tranſport themſelves and their effects
                    into Candia, the ſultan ſhould ſupply that defect. 7. That they ſhould have 12
                    days allowed them, from the ſigning of the articles, to lend all their effects
                    on board. 8. That they ſhould have the liberty of carrying away their relics,
                    chalices, and other ſacred utenſils belonging to the great church of St John,
                    together with all their ornaments and other effects. 9. That they ſhould
                    likewiſe carry with them all the artillery with which they were wont to arm the
                    galleys of the order- 10. That the iſlands belonging to it, together with the
                    caſtle of St Peter, ſhould be delivered up to the Turks. 11. That, for the more
                    eaſy execution of theſe articles, the Turkiſh army ſhould be removed at ſome
                    miles diſtance from the capital. 12.That the aga of the janiſſaries, at the head
                    of 4000 of his men, ſhould be allowed to go and take poſſeſſion of the place.</p>
                <p>From this time the iſland of Rhodes has been ſubject to the Turks ; and, like
                    other countries ſubject to that tyrannical yoke, has loſt its former importance.
                    The air is good, and the foil fertile, but ill cultivated. The capital is
                    ſurrounded with triple walls and double ditches, and is looked upon to be
                    impregnable. It is inhabited by Turks and Jews; the Chi iſtians being obliged to
                    occupy the ſuburbs, as not being allowed to ſtay in the town during the night.
                    The town is ſituated in E. Long. 28. 25. N. Lat. 36. 54.</p>
