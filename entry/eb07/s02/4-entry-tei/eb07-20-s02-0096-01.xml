in <hi rend="italic">Ancient Geography,</hi> a people of Gallia Celtica, situated on the Sequana, to the south of the Parisii, near the confluence of the Jeauna or Yonne with the above-mentioned river. Their most considerable exploit was their invasion of Italy, and the taking and burning of Rome, as related under that article. This was done by a colony of them long before transported into Italy, and settled on the Adriatic. Their capital, Agendicum, in Gaul, was in the lower age called Senones, now Sens. In Italy the Senones extended themselves as far as the river Ã†sis, but were afterwards driven beyond the Rubicon, which became the boundary of Gallia Cisalpina.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
