<p><span class="font0">men had been killed and wounded in three weeks. The Russians strengthened their works around the captured forts in such a way as&nbsp;effectually to prevent farther advance, and the Japanese 3rd Army&nbsp;had now to resign itself to a methodical siege. Small sorties,&nbsp;partial attacks@@<sup>1</sup> and duels between the Japanese guns and the&nbsp;generally more powerful ordnance of the fortress continued.&nbsp;The siege approaches were first directed against theTemple-Waterworks group, which was stormed on the 19th and&nbsp;20th of September. Pan-Lung was connected with the&nbsp;Japanese lines by covered ways, approaches were begun&nbsp;towards several of the eastern forts, and on the 20th of September</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">180-Metre Hill was stormed, though the crest was untenable under the fire from 203-Metre Hill. The Japanese were now beginning&nbsp;to pay more attention to the western side of the fortress, and from&nbsp;the 19th to the 22nd there was hard fighting around 203-Metre Hill,&nbsp;the attack being eventually repulsea with the loss of 2000 men.&nbsp;Operations in the west were thereupon abandoned for the time being,&nbsp;and the eastern forts remained the principal objective of the attack.&nbsp;Heavier howitzers had been sent for from Japan, and on the 1st of&nbsp;October the first batteries of 28 centimetre (11 in.) howitzers came&nbsp;into action. They fired a shell weighing 485 lb, with a bursting&nbsp;charge of 17 lb. On the 12th, the Japanese took the trenches&nbsp;between the Waterworks Redoubt and Erh-Lung, and cut the water-supply. Saps were then pushed on against Erh-Lung, and to help in&nbsp;their progress a Russian advanced work called <sup>11</sup> G ” was captured&nbsp;on the 16th, by a skilfully combined attack of infantry and artillery.&nbsp;From this time forward there was a desperate struggle at the sap-heads on the north front.@@<sup>2</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On the 26th of October another assault was made on Chi-Kuan</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@1 </sup>A particular feature of these constant night-fights was the effective use of the defenders’ searchlight, not only to show up the&nbsp;enemy but to blind him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@2 </sup>Hand grenades and extemporized trench mortars were used on both sides with very great effect. The Japanese hand grenades&nbsp;consisted of about 1 lb of high explosive in a tin case; the Russian&nbsp;cases were of all sorts, including old Chinese shell. The • Japanese&nbsp;employed wire-netting screens to stop the Russian grenades.&nbsp;Various means were tried for the destruction of entanglements.&nbsp;Eventually it was found that the best plan was to sap through&nbsp;them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Fort and Battery, and was continued at intervals, varied by Russian counter-attacks, till the 2nd of November. By this time the&nbsp;Japanese were becoming disheartened. They had incurred an&nbsp;additional loss of 13,000 men without substantial gain, except à&nbsp;lodgment on the counterscarp of Sung-Shu. This prepared the way&nbsp;for mining, which had already been begun at Erh-Lung. On the&nbsp;17th of November seven mines were exploded at Sung-Shu, which&nbsp;blew in the back of the counterscarp galleries. At Erh-Lung on the&nbsp;20th of November three mines were exploded, which half filled the,&nbsp;ditch, and the Japanese later on sapped across to the escarp over&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">débris.</span><span class="font0"> At Chi-Kuan, the counterscarp gallery had been breached&nbsp;by an ill-managed Russian mine on the 23rd of October and the&nbsp;Japanese got in through the breach and made a lodgment. They&nbsp;aid not, however, get possession of the whole of the counterscarp&nbsp;galleries before about the middle of November. On the 22nd&nbsp;of November the Japanese assaulted the trench round Chi-Kuan&nbsp;battery. It was captured and retaken by counter-attack twice&nbsp;between 6 p.m. and 1 a.m. In this fight each side was using corpses&nbsp;as breastworks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On the 26th of November another assault was made on the same lines as that of the 30th of October. By this time the besiegers were&nbsp;sapping under the escarps of the northern forts, and* it would have&nbsp;been better to delay. But the situation was serious in the extreme.&nbsp;In Manchuria Kuropat.kin’s army had reasserted itself. From&nbsp;Europe Rozhestvenski’s squadron was just setting sail for the Far&nbsp;East. Marshal Oyama sent his principal staff officers to stimulate&nbsp;Nogi to fresh efforts, and some exhausted units of the besieging army&nbsp;were replaced by fresh troops from Japan. With 100,000 men and&nbsp;this urgent need of immediate victory, Nogi and the marshal’s staff&nbsp;officers felt bound to make a third general assault. The siege w’orks&nbsp;had indeed made considerable progress. The ditches of Sung-Shu&nbsp;and Erh-Lung were partially filled. They held most of the ditch&nbsp;of Chi-Kuan Fort and were cutting down the escarp, and two&nbsp;parallels had been made only 30 yds. from the Chinese Wall at&nbsp;*G ” and Pan-Lung.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The general attack was made at 1 p.m. At Sung-Shu the stormers got into the fort, but suffered much from the artillery on the western&nbsp;side of the Lun-ho valley, and w’ere beaten out of it again in 20&nbsp;minutes; 2000 men tried in vain to get up the Lun-ho valley to take&nbsp;Sung-Shu in rear. At Erh-Lung they could not get over the outer&nbsp;parapet. At “ G ” they took a portion of the Chinese Wall and lost</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
