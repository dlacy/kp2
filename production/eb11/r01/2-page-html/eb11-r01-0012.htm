<p><span class="font1">of the four friends which La Fontaine draws in his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Psyche, </span><span class="font1">Racine figuring as Acante, “ qui aimait extrêmement les jardins,&nbsp;les fleurs, les ombrages, ’’ in which surroundings he helped to&nbsp;compose the lampoon of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chapelain décoiffé</span><span class="font1"> on a writer who had&nbsp;helped him with criticism, obtained royal gifts for him, and, in&nbsp;a fashion, started him in the literary career.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We have no definite details as to Racine’s doings during the year 1664, but in February 1665 he read at the Hôtel&nbsp;de Nevers before La Rochefoucauld, Madame de la Fayette,&nbsp;Madame de Sévigné, and other scarcely less redoubtable judges&nbsp;the greater part of his second acted play, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Alexandre le Grand,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">or, as Pomponne (who tells the fact) calls it, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Porus.</span><span class="font1"> It was&nbsp;anxiously expected by the public, and Molière’s company&nbsp;played it on the 4th of December—Monsieur, his wife Henrietta&nbsp;of England, and many other distinguished persons being present.&nbsp;The gazetteer, Adrien Perdou de Subligny vouches for its&nbsp;success, and the receipts were good and steady. But a fortnight&nbsp;afterwards </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Alexandre</span><span class="font1"> was played, “ de complot avec M. Racine, ”&nbsp;says La Grange, by the rival actors (who had four days before&nbsp;performed it in private) at the Hôtel de Bourgogne. A vast&nbsp;amount of ink has been spilt on this question, but no one has&nbsp;produced any valid justification for Racine. That the piece&nbsp;failed at the Palais Royal, as is stated in the earliest attempt&nbsp;to excuse Racine, and the only one made in his lifetime, is not&nbsp;true. His son simply says that he was “ mécontent des acteurs, ”&nbsp;which indeed is self-evident. It is certain that Molière and he&nbsp;ceased to be friends in consequence of this proceeding; and&nbsp;that Molière was in fault no one who has studied the character&nbsp;of the two men will easily believe. If, however, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Alexandre&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">was the occasion of showing the defects of Racine’s character&nbsp;as a man, it raised him vastly in public estimation as a poet.&nbsp;He was now for the first time proposed as a serious rival to&nbsp;Corneille. There is a story that he read the piece to the author&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cid</span><span class="font1"> and asked his verdict. Corneille praised the piece&nbsp;highly, but not as a drama, “ Il l’assurait qu’il n’était pas propre&nbsp;à la poésie dramatique. ” There is no reason for disbelieving&nbsp;this, for the character of Alexander could not fail to shock&nbsp;Corneille, and he was notorious for not mincing his words.&nbsp;The contrast between the two even at this early period was&nbsp;accurately apprehended and put by Saint Evremond in his&nbsp;masterly </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dissertation sur l'Alexandre,</span><span class="font1"> but this was not published&nbsp;for a year or two. To this day it is the best criticism of the&nbsp;faults of Racine, though not, it may be, of the merits, which&nbsp;had not yet been fully seen. It may be added that in the preface&nbsp;of the printed play the poet showed the extreme sensitiveness&nbsp;to criticism which perhaps excuses, and which certainly often&nbsp;accompanies, a tendency to criticize others. These defects&nbsp;of character showed themselves still more fully in another&nbsp;matter. The Port Royalists, as has been said, detested the&nbsp;theatre, and in January 1666 Nicole, their chief writer, spoke&nbsp;in one of his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lettres sur les visionnaires,</span><span class="font1"> directed against Desmurets de Saint-Sulin, of dramatic poets as “ empoisonneurs&nbsp;publics. ’’ Racine immediately published a letter to the author.&nbsp;It is very smartly written, and if Racine had contented himself&nbsp;with protesting against the exaggeration of the decriers of&nbsp;the stage there would have been little harm done. But he&nbsp;filled the piece with personalities, telling an absurd story of&nbsp;Mère Angélique Arnauld’s supposed intolerance, drawing a&nbsp;ridiculous picture of Le Maître (a dead man and his own special&nbsp;teacher and friend), and sneering savagely at Nicole himself.&nbsp;The latter made no reply, but two lay adherents of Port Royal&nbsp;took up the quarrel with more zeal than discretion or ability.&nbsp;Racine wrote a second pamphlet as bitter and personal as the&nbsp;first, but less amusing, and was about to publish it when fortunately Boileau, who had been absent from Paris, returned&nbsp;and protested against the publication. It remained accordingly unprinted till after the author’s death, as well as a preface to both which he had prepared with a view to publishing&nbsp;them together and so discharging the accumulated resentment&nbsp;arising from a long course of “ excommunications. ’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">After this disagreeable episode Racine’s life, for ten years and more, becomes simply the history of his plays, if we except&nbsp;his liaisons with the actresses Mademoiselle du Parc and Mademoiselle de Champmeslé, and his election to the Academy on&nbsp;the 17th of July 1673. Mademoiselle du Parc (marquise de&nbsp;Gorla) was no very great actress, but was very beautiful, and&nbsp;she had previously captivated Molière. Racine induced her&nbsp;to leave the Palais Royal company and join the Hôtel. She&nbsp;died in 1668, and long afterwards the infamous Catherine&nbsp;Voisin accused Racine of having poisoned her. Mademoiselle&nbsp;de Champmeslé was plain, but an admirable actress, and apparently very attractive in some way, for not merely Racine&nbsp;but Charles de Sévigné and many others adored her. For five&nbsp;years before his marriage Racine seems to have been her </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">amant&nbsp;en titre,</span><span class="font1"> but long afterwards, just before his own death, when&nbsp;he heard of her mortal illness, he spoke of her to his son without&nbsp;a flash of tenderness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The series of his unquestioned dramatic triumphs began with </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Andromaque,</span><span class="font1"> and this play may perhaps dispute with </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Phèdre&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Athalie</span><span class="font1"> the title of his masterpiece. It is much more&nbsp;uniformly good than </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Phèdre,</span><span class="font1"> and the character of Hermione&nbsp;is the most personally interesting on the French tragic stage.&nbsp;It is said that the first representation of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Andromaque</span><span class="font1"> was on&nbsp;10th November 1667, in public and by the actors of the Hôtel&nbsp;de Bourgogne, but the first contemporary mention of it by the&nbsp;gazettes, prose and verse, is on the 17th, as performed in the&nbsp;queen’s apartment. Perrault, by no means a friendly critic as&nbsp;far as Racine is concerned, says that it made as much noise as&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cid,</span><span class="font1"> and so it ought to have done. Whatever may be&nbsp;thought of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">tragédie pathétique</span><span class="font1"> (a less favourable criticism&nbsp;might call it the “ sentimental tragedy ”), it could hardly be&nbsp;better exemplified than in this admirable play. A ferocious&nbsp;epigram of Racine’s own tells us that some critics thought&nbsp;Pyrrhus too fond of his mistress, and Andromache too fond&nbsp;of her husband, but in the contemporary depreciations is to&nbsp;be found the avowal of its real merit. Pyrrhus was taken by&nbsp;Floridor, the best tragic actor by common consent of his time,&nbsp;and Orestes by Montfleury, also an accomplished player. But&nbsp;Mademoiselle du Parc, who played Andromache, had generally been thought below, not above, her parts, and Mademoiselle&nbsp;des Oeillets, who played the difficult rôle of Hermione, was&nbsp;old and had few physical advantages. No one who reads&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Andromaque</span><span class="font1"> without prejudice is likely to mistake the secret&nbsp;of its success, which is, in few words, the application of the&nbsp;most delicate art to the conception of really tragic passion.&nbsp;Before leaving the play it may be mentioned that it is said&nbsp;to have been in the part of Hermione, three years later, that&nbsp;Mademoiselle de Champmeslé captivated the author. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Andromaque</span><span class="font1"> was succeeded, at the distance of not more than a year,&nbsp;by the charming comedietta of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Les Plaideurs.</span><span class="font1"> We do not know&nbsp;exactly when it was played, but it was printed on the 5th of&nbsp;December 1668. Many anecdotes are told about its origin&nbsp;and composition. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Wasps</span><span class="font1"> of Aristophanes, and the known&nbsp;fact that Racine originally destined it, not for a French company, but for the Italian troupe which was then playing the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Commedia dell'arte</span><span class="font1"> in Paris, dispense us from enumerating&nbsp;them. The result is a piece admirably dramatic, but sufficiently literary to shock the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">profanum vulgus,</span><span class="font1"> which too&nbsp;frequently gives the tone at theatres. It failed completely,&nbsp;the chief favouring voice being, according to a story sufficiently&nbsp;well attested and worthy of belief even without attestation,&nbsp;that of the man who was best qualified to praise and who might&nbsp;have been most tempted to blame of any man then living.&nbsp;Molière, says Valincourt, the special friend of Racine, said in&nbsp;leaving the house, “ Que ceux qui se moquoient de cette pièce&nbsp;meritoient qu’on se moquoient d’eux. ’’ But the piece was&nbsp;suddenly played at court a month later; the king laughed,&nbsp;and its fortunes were restored. It need only be added that, if&nbsp;Louis XIV. admired </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Les Plaideurs,</span><span class="font1"> Napoleon did not, and&nbsp;excluded it from his travelling library. It was followed by a&nbsp;very different work, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Britannicus,</span><span class="font1"> which appeared on 13th&nbsp;December 1669. This was much less successful than </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Andromaque,</span><span class="font1"> and seems to have held its own but </span><span class="font0">a </span><span class="font1">very few nights.&nbsp;Afterwards it became very popular, and even from the first the</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
