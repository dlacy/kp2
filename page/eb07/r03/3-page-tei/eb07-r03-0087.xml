This vast space is chiefly inhabited by Cossacks, colonised warriors, divided into several regiments ; and although other colonists, as peasants, shopkeejpers, &amp;c. have established themselves there, the population does not at present exceed 45,000. The Cossacks are privileged to trade with the Kirghises, without paying the taxes of either of the three guilds ; in their military capacity they mount guard in turn at the different posts; their leisure time is employed in the rearing of cattle, gardening, hunting, and fishing. The territory they occupy is for the most part very fertile, especially between the forty-ninth and fifty-first degrees of latitude, where the soil spontaneously produces fruit-trees, melons, tobacco, &amp;c.; whilst in the most eastern part, the solitary but picturesque and fruitful valleys of Altai, rich in every description of odoriferous flowers and aromatic herbs, enable the inhabitants to rear innumerable swarms of bees, and to furnish the greatest part of Siberian honey. Several manufactories, especially that of leather, have been established in the towns ; but trade is yet in its infancy, and scarcely developed. Its progress and improvement will doubtless hereafter enhance the value of the natural productions of these regions, amongst which must be reckoned the lakes of salt water so numerous in the steppes. Important as they are in relation to trade and commerce, these lakes likewise present to the naturalist a series of interesting phenomena. Their waters hold so great a quantity of salt in solution, that the action of the summer heat is of itself sufficient to convert it into crystals, which, carried towards the banks by the action of the waves, form there shoals of salt of an immense extent. Magazines have been formed upon the borders of Lake Ko-riak, the only one situated on the right bank of the Irtysh, and the salt therein preserved generally amounts to several millions of poods. Large quantities of this article are annually carried across the Irtysh to Tobolsk. But however rich this lake may be, it is less so than three others, the Karashack, the Kalkaman, and the Djémantons, situated in the steppes on the right bank of the Irtysh. Each of these basins is from twenty to twenty-five versts in circumference; and the action of the solar rays produces in them, during the summer season, crystals of salt so numerous, that by mutual contact they at length form thick and solid arches, which, like winter ice, cover the surface of the lakes. These masses are frequently nine inches thick ; the action of the air whitens the upper layers; the lower ones preserve a bluish tint, which in some places assumes a beautiful violet hue ; and the solidity of these crystal fields is such that horses, chariots, and even camels, pass over them with the greatest safety. Ten other lakes are also found between the Irtysh and Redoubt of Siberia.</p><p>The mines of Russian Asia are by far more productive than those of any other portion of the empire, as from them is extracted the whole of the gold, silver, platina, and lead, nine tenths of the copper, and eleven twelfths of the iron which is brought into use. Zinc, arsenic, and bismuth, together with precious stones, are also found. These mines are situated in the Uralian and Altaian ranges of mountains. It is in those parts of these chains which face Siberia, that is, the eastern slope of the Ural, and the northern declivities of the Altai, with its secondary branches, that are found the veins of precious metal. The best account of these mines is that contained in a recent book of travels by Gustav Rose. @@<hi rend="sup">1</hi> “ The sand containing small particles of gold occurs along the eastern declivity of the Uralian range, in numerous places north of 56° north latitude, and extends</p><p>beyond 60° north latitude. It occurs in the western decli- </p><p>vity likewise, but only in a few places, and contains less gold. On the Siberian side of the range, the sand from which the gold is extracted contains about one and a half or two solotnik of gold in a pood, or from 1/2280 to 1/1920 that which contains less is at present not worked.” But Mr Rose says that even sand containing only 1/7680 of gold can still be washed with profit. “ The expenses in washing sand containing between and of gold amount commonly to two fifths of its net produce. Sometimes sand is found of which 1/600 and even 1/300 is gold. A small quantity of silver is always mixed with the gold ; it amounts to between two and eleven parts in one hundred. Near the Altai Mountains, likewise, gold sand has been discovered in some places, and they have begun working it The first establishment for working this sand in the Ural was made in 1814, at Beresowsk, near Ikaterineburg, and since that time they have been increasing in number and extent Last year (1836) the produce of all the Russian mines gave 27,885 marcs of gold, of which more than two thirds were derived from the washing of the sand.” The platina mines are situated on the western declivity of the Ural, about the parallel of 57° 40' north. They are six in number, and lie at a short distance from one another. “ In the most northern, called Sukhowissimokoi, the discovery of the sand containing platina was made in 1825, and at the other places it was found soon afterwards. The proportion of platina is much larger than that of gold, as it amounts on an average to    of the whole mass. Sometimes pieces are found</p><p>weighing some ounces, and even half a pound and upwards. A small quantity of gold is united with platina. In 1834 platina was discovered in layers of serpentine. The produce of platina in 1836 amounted to 8270 marcs.” @@<hi rend="sup">2</hi></p><p>The field opened for researches is so vast, that years of methodical and persevering examination have not yet been sufficient to explore all the valleys and summits of these immense chains, a vast extent not having yet been visited by the officers of the Mining Board. The examination of these parts, as yet almost unknown, is pursued with the greatest regularity. The two chains, the Ural and the Altai, are divided into several mining districts. In each of them the officers to whom is confided the direction of the works, send out every summer detachments of discovery, whose duty it is to examine in detail the mountains assigned to them, the point at which the expedition stopped the preceding year being generally that of departure for the new one. We have already stated the quantities of metal which these mines produce annually. With regard to the diamonds, Mr Rose states that only small stones are found, their number up' to July 1833 amounting only to thirty-three.</p><p>The manufactures are few and unimportant, with the ex-ception of spirits and leather, which are made to a consi-derable extent at Tobolsk,and the towns in the neighbour-hood. There are here 114 tanneries, besides a number of establishments for soap-boiling and the melting of tallow. Cotton and woollen are begun to be manufactured into coarse stuffs in one or two parts. The breweries, but especially the distilleries, are more numerous than any other manufacturing objects. Making corn-spirits is a royal monopoly, but in some of the Asiatic cities it is let to farm by the government. The chief commerce is internal, between the several provinces whose productions are most different from each other. Trade is carried on to a great extent at Tobolsk, the capital of the country. With the exception of the clergy and persons employed in the service of government, almost all are engaged in it, exchanging the produce</p><lb/><lb/><p><hi rend="italic">@@@ Reise nach dem U~al, dem Altai, und dem Kaspischen Meere,</hi>  von Augustav Rose, vol. i.
