<p><span class="font1">again partly laid bare in 1869 and the following years. This has often, but wrongly, been called the palace of Augustus; we should&nbsp;rather see in it the dwelling-rooms of the Flavian palace. Adjoining&nbsp;it is the so-called stadium of the Palatine (“ Hippodromus” on&nbsp;Plan), begun by Domitian, enlarged by Hadrian, and much altered or&nbsp;restored by Severus. The greater part of the outer walls and the&nbsp;large exedra or apse at the side, with upper floor for the emperor’s&nbsp;seat, are of the time of Hadrian, as is shown by the brick stamps,&nbsp;and the character of the brick facing, which much resembles that&nbsp;of the Flavian time (bricks ij in. and joints J in. thick).<sup>@@1</sup> The&nbsp;stadium is surrounded with a colonnade of engaged shafts, forming&nbsp;a sort of aisle with gallery over it. Except those at the curved end,&nbsp;which are of Hadrian’s time, these piers are of the time of Severus,&nbsp;as are also all the flat piers along the outer wall,—one opposite each&nbsp;of those in the inner line. Severus restored the galleries after the&nbsp;great fire of </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font1"> 19</span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">i.</span><span class="font1"> This building was the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">hippodromus Palatii\&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">the word here means, not a racecourse, but a garden (Plin.</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Epp*</span><span class="font1"> 5,6,19).</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">handsome rooms, forming a palace on the south-east side and at the south-west end of the stadium. These rooms were partly destroyed&nbsp;and partly hidden by the later palace of Severus, the&nbsp;foundations of which in many places cut through and&nbsp;render useless the highly decorated rooms of Hadrian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The finest of these which is now visible is a room with a large window opening into the stadium near the south angle; it has&nbsp;intersecting barrel vaults, with deep coffers, richly ornamented in&nbsp;stucco. The oval structure shown in the plan (fig. 10), with other&nbsp;still later additions, belongs to the 6th century; in its walls, of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">opus&nbsp;mixtum,</span><span class="font1"> are found brick stamps of the reign of Theodoric, c. 500.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The palace of Septimius Severus was very extensive and of enormous height; it extends not only all over the south angle of the&nbsp;Palatine but also a long way into the valley of the Circus&nbsp;Maximus and towards the Coelian. This part (like&nbsp;Caligula’s palace) is carried on very lofty arched substructures, so as to form a level, uniform with the top of the hill,&nbsp;on which the grand apartments stood. The whole height from the&nbsp;base of the Palatine to several storeys above its summit must have&nbsp;been enormous. Little now remains of the highest storeys, except&nbsp;part of a grand staircase which led to them. Extensive baths,&nbsp;originally decorated with marble linings and mosaics in glass and</span></p>
