<p><span class="font0">off the bell which summoned the citizens. Thus fell the last of the Slavonic republics. Ryazan was next added&nbsp;to the Muscovite territory. The prince, being accused of&nbsp;having contracted an alliance with the khan of the Crimea,&nbsp;tied to Lithuania, where he died in obscurity. Novgorod Severski was annexed soon after, and by a war with&nbsp;Sigismund I. Basil got back Smolensk. He was doomed,&nbsp;however, to suffer from an invasion of the Mongols of the&nbsp;Crimea, and is said to have signed a humiliating treaty to&nbsp;save his capital, whereby he acknowledged himself the&nbsp;tributary of the khan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Meanwhile at home Basil exercised absolute authority ; Russia now exhibited the spectacle of an Asiatic despotism.&nbsp;He entered into negotiations with many foreign princes.&nbsp;Herberstein, the German ambassador, who has left us such&nbsp;an interesting account of the Russia of this time, has told&nbsp;us of the great splendour of his court. We now come to&nbsp;the reign of the terrible Ivan, who has left his name&nbsp;written in blood upon the annals of Russia, and ruled for&nbsp; the long period of fifty-one years (1533-1584). It was a&nbsp;fortunate thing for the aggrandizement of the empire&nbsp;that, instead of having a succession of weak sovereigns,&nbsp;who only ruled a short time, it had three such vigorous&nbsp;potentates as Ivan III., Basil, and Ivan IV., whose united&nbsp;reigns extended over a hundred and twenty-two years.&nbsp;The grand-duke Basil at his death left two sons, Ivan and&nbsp;Yuri, under the guardianship of his second wife Helen&nbsp;Glinska. She had come into Russia from Lithuania, her&nbsp;family having been proscribed by the Polish king Alexander&nbsp;on the accusation of having plotted against his life. The&nbsp;grand-duchess ruled with great ability, but died in 1538,&nbsp;having been, as is supposed, poisoned. The two young&nbsp;princes then became the victims of the intrigues of the&nbsp;chief families, especially those of Shuiski and Belski.&nbsp;Ivan early gave proof of a vigorous understanding, whereas&nbsp;his younger brother Yuri appears to have been half-witted.&nbsp;In 1543, when only in his thirteenth year, Ivan determined&nbsp;to emancipate himself from the galling yoke of the boiars,&nbsp;and by a kind of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">coup el'etat</span><span class="font0"> threw off their tutelage, and&nbsp;caused Shuiski to be torn to pieces by dogs. After this,&nbsp;for some time, he was under the influence of his maternal&nbsp;relations. In January 1547 Ivan was crowned by the&nbsp;metropolitan Macarius, and took the title of czar, or tsar,&nbsp;a Slavonic form of the Latin Cæsar. He soon afterwards&nbsp;celebrated his marriage with Anastasia Romanova. The&nbsp;same year a great conflagration took place at Moscow.&nbsp;The mob affected to believe that this had been caused by&nbsp;the Glinskis, who were very unpopular, and massacred a&nbsp;member of that family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">After this time Ivan seems to have committed himself very much to the guidance of the priest Silvester and&nbsp;Alexis Adasheff. This was the happiest portion of his&nbsp;reign, for he was also greatly under the influence of his&nbsp;amiable wife. To this period also belongs a recension&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sudebnik</span><span class="font0"> of his grandfather Ivan III. (1550),&nbsp;and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Stoglaff,</span><span class="font0"> or Book of the Hundred Chapters, by&nbsp;which the affairs of the church were regulated (1551).&nbsp;In the following year Ivan became master of Kazan, and&nbsp;two years later of Astrakhan. The power of the Mongols&nbsp;was no.v almost broken. Triumphant in the south and&nbsp;the east, he then turned his attention to the north, being&nbsp;anxious to open up a means of communication with the&nbsp;west. He anticipated the plans which Peter the Great&nbsp;was destined to carry out long afterwards. He was thus&nbsp;brought into collision with the Swedes and the Teutonic&nbsp;Knights. When Ivan sent a German named Schlitt to&nbsp;procure the assistance of some foreign artisans, they were&nbsp;stopped by the Germans and prevented from entering&nbsp;Russian territory. In consequence of this, war afterwards&nbsp;broke out between Ivan and the Order. In 1558 the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Russian army invaded Livonia, and took several towns, whereupon the Order made an alliance with Sigismund&nbsp;Augustus of Poland. But, while Russia was busy with&nbsp;this war, a great change was taking place in the home&nbsp;policy of Ivan. He threw off the influence of Silvester&nbsp;and Adasheff, who were both banished. From this time&nbsp;may be said to date the commencement of the atrocities of&nbsp;this czar which have earned him the epithet constantly&nbsp;added to his name. He was especially moved by the&nbsp;treason of Prince Andrew Kurbski, who, having lost a&nbsp;battle with the Poles, was too much afraid of the wrath of&nbsp;his imperial master to venture again into his clutches.&nbsp;He accordingly fled to the king of Poland, by whom he&nbsp;was well received, and from his safe retreat he commenced&nbsp;an angry correspondence with the czar, reproaching him&nbsp;with his cruelties (see below, p. 104). The answer of&nbsp;Ivan has been preserved. In it he dwells upon the degrading subjection in which he had been kept by his early&nbsp;advisers, and attempts to justify his cruelties by saying&nbsp;that they were only his slaves whom he had killed, over&nbsp;whom God had given him power of life and death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In December 1564 Ivan retired with a few personal friends to his retreat at Alexandrovskoe, near Moscow,&nbsp;where he passed his time pretty much as Louis XI. did at&nbsp;Plessy-les-Tours, for he resembled the French monarch&nbsp;both in his cruelty and his superstition. The boiars,&nbsp;afraid that the monarch was about to quit them for ever,&nbsp;went in crowds to Alexandrovskoe to supplicate him to&nbsp;return to Moscow. This he finally consented to do, and&nbsp;on his return established his bodyguard of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">oprùhniks,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">who were the chief agents of his cruelty. In the year in&nbsp;which he retired to Alexandrovskoe we have the establishment of a printing-press at Moscow. Ivan now commenced&nbsp;a long series of cruelties. To this period belong the deposition and perhaps murder of Philip, the archbishop of Moscow ; the execution of Alexandra, the widow of his brother&nbsp;Yuri ; the atrocities committed at Novgorod, which seems&nbsp;to have fallen under the tyrant’s vengeance for having&nbsp;meditated opening its gates to the king of Poland ; and,&nbsp;lastly, the terrible butcheries on the Red Square </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">[Krasnaia&nbsp;Plostchad).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It was in the reign of Ivan that the English first had dealings with Russia. In 1553, while Edward VI. was&nbsp;on the throne, three ships were sent out under Willoughby&nbsp;and Chancellor to look for a north-east passage to China&nbsp;and India. Willoughby and the crews of two of the ships&nbsp;were frozen to death, but Chancellor arrived safely in the&nbsp;White Sea, and thence proceeded to the court of Ivan, by&nbsp;whom he was favourably received. The English secured&nbsp;great trading privileges from Ivan, and established factories in the country. In one of his mad sallies, Ivan&nbsp;actually wrote to Queen Elizabeth (1570) asking for a&nbsp;safe retreat in her dominions if he should be driven out&nbsp;by his own subjects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Ivan was continually waging war in the Baltic territory with the Teutonic Knights, in which, although on the&nbsp;whole unsuccessful, he committed great cruelties. But in&nbsp;1571 he was obliged to suffer another invasion of the&nbsp;Mongols of the Crimea, who, to quote the quaint language&nbsp;of an English resident, burned “ the Mosco every stick ”&nbsp;(Hakluyt’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Voyages,</span><span class="font0"> i. 402). On the death of Sigismund&nbsp;Augustus of Poland in 1572, when the crown of that&nbsp;country had become elective, the family of the Jagiettos&nbsp;being now extinct, Ivan declared himself one of the competitors. The successful candidate was the French prince&nbsp;Henry of Valois, but he soon fled from his new kingdom,&nbsp;and, on the throne again becoming vacant, the redoubtable&nbsp;Stephen Batory was chosen, who proved a formidable foe&nbsp;to the tyrant now growing old. In consequence of the&nbsp;successes of Stephen, Ivan was obliged to abandon all his</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
