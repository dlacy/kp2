In all probability, however, the inſignificancy of the fiiſt reformer was the reaſon why he was not perſecnted and exterminated at his firſt beginning, as others had been before him. Another reaſon probably might be, that he did not at once at-tack the whole errors of Popery, but brought about his reformation gradually, probably as it occurred to him-ſelf, and as we have related in the account of his life.</p><p>The Reformation, began in the city of wittemberg in Saxony, but was not long confined either to that city or province. In 1520 the Franciſcan friars, who had the care of promulgating indulgences in Switzer-land, were oppofed by 'Zuinglius, a man not inferior in underſtanding and knowledge to Luther himfelf. He proceeded with the greateſt vigour, even at the very be-ginnſhg, to overturn the whole fabric of Popery ; but his opinions were declared erroneous by the univerſities of Cologne and Louvain. Notwithſtanding this, the magiſtrates of Zurich approved of his proceedings ; and that whole canton, together with thoſe of Bern, Baſil, and-Chaſſauſen, embraced his opinions.</p><p>In Germany, Luther continued to make great ad-vances, without being in the leaſt intimidated by the eccleſiaſtical cenſures which were thundered againſt him from all quarters, he being continually protected by the German princes either from religious or political mo-tives, ſo that his adverſaries could not accompliſh his deſtruction as they had done that of others. The princes, who were upon bad terms with the court of Rome, took advantage of the ſucceſs of the new doctrines; and in their own dominions eaſily overturned a church which had loſt all the reſpect and veneration of the inferior ranks. The court of Rome had diſobliged ſome of the ſmaller princes in the north of Germany, whom the Pope probably thought too inſigniſicant to be worth the managing, and they univerſally eſtabliſhed the Reformation in their own dominions. Melancthon, Car-loſtadius, and other men of eminence, alſo greatly forwarded the work of Luther ; and in all probability the Popiſh hierarchy would have ſoon come to an end, in the northern parts of Europe at leaſt, had not the emperor Charles V. given a fevere check to the progrefs of reformation in Germany. In order to follow out the ſchemes dictated by his ambition, he thought it neceſſary to ingratiate himſelf with the pope ; and the moſt effectual method of doing this was by deſtroying Luther. The Pope’s legates inſiſted that Luther ought to be condemned by the diet of worms without either trial or hearing ; as being a moſt notorious, avowed, and incorrigible heretic. However, this appeared unjuſt to the members of the diet, and he was ſummoned to appear ; which he accordingly did without heſitation *. There is not the leaſt doubt that his appearance there had been his laſt in this world, had aot the aſtoniſhing reſpect that was paid him, and the crowds who came daily to ſee him, deterred his judges from delivering the church from the author of ſuch a peſtſlent hereſy ; which they were*ſtrongly ſolicited by the pope’s party to do. He was therefore permitted to depart with a ſafe conduct ſor a certain time ; after which he was in the ſtate of a profcribed criminal, to whom it was unlawful to perform any of the offices of humanity.</p><p>During the confinement of Luther in a caſtle near warburg, the Reformation advanced rapidly 5 almoſt every city in Saxony embracing the Lutheran opinions. At this time an alteration in the eſtabliſhed forms of worſhip was firſt ventured uponatwktemberg,by aboliſh-ing the celebration of private maffes, and by giving the cup as well as the bread to the laity in the Lord’s flipper. In a ſhort time, however, the new opinions were condemned by the univeiſtty of Paris, and a refutation of them was attempted by Henry VIII. of England. But Luther was not to be thus intimidated. He pub-hihed his animadverfions on both with as much acrimony as if he had been refuting the meaneſt adverſary ; and a controverfy managed by ſuch illuſtrious antagoniſts drew a general attention, and the Reformers daily gained new converts both in France alld England.</p><p>But while the efforts of Luthcr were thus everywhere crowned with ſuccefs, the diviſions began to prevail which have ſince fo much agitated the reformed church-es. The firſt diſpute was between Luther and Zuinglius concerning the manner in which the body and blood of Chriſt were preſent in the euchariſt. Luther and his followers, though they had rejected the notion of tranfubſtantiation, were nevertheleſs of opinion that the body and blood of Chriſt were really preſent in the Lord’s ſupper, in a way which they could not pretend to explain. Carloſtadt, who was Luther’s colleague, firſt ſuggeſted another view of the ſubject, which was afterwards confirmed and illuſtrated by Zuinglius, namely, that the body and blood of Chriſt were not really prefent in the euchariſt ; and that the bread and wine were no more than external fymbols to excite the remembrance of Chriſt’s fufferings in the minds of thoſe who received it. Both parties maintained their tenets with the utmoſt obſtinacy ; and, by their diviſions, firſt gave their adverſaries an argument againſt them, which to this day the Catholics urge with great force ; namely, that the Proteſtants are fo divided, that it is impoffible to know who is right or wrong ; and that there cannot be a ſtronger proof than theſe diviſions, that the whole doc-trine is falfe.</p><p>To theſe inteſtſhe diviſions were added the horrors of a civil war, occaſioned by oppreffion on the one hand, and enthuſiaſm on the other. In 1525, a great number of ſeditious fanatics aroſe ©n a ſudden in different parts of Germany, took arms, united their forces, and made war againſt the empire, laying waſte the country with ſire and ſword, and committing everywhere the greateſt cruelties. The greateſt part of this furious mob was compofed of peaſants and vaſſals, who groaned under heavy burdens, and declared that they were no longer able to bear the deſpotic government of their chiefs ; and hence this ſedition had the name of <hi rend="italic">the ruſlic war,</hi>  or the <hi rend="italic">war oſ the peaſants.</hi>  At ſirſt this rabble declared, that they had no other motives than the redreſs of their grievances ; but no ſooner had the enthuſiaſſ Munzer, or Munſſer, the anabaptiſt, put himſelf at their head, than the face of things was entirely changed, and the civil commotions in Saxony and Thuringia exceedingly increaſed, of which an account is given under the article Anabaptists.</p><p>In the mean time Frederic, ſurnamed the <hi rend="italic">Wiſe,</hi>  elector of Saxony, and Luther’s great patron, departed this life, and was ſueceeded by his brother John.
