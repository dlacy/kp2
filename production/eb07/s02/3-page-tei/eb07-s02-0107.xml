He wrote several treatises on history and the works of nature ; but there is only one of them extant, which is a very indifferent poem on the Remedies of Diseases. He was murdered at a festival by the order of Caracalla. He had a library that contained sixty-two thousand volumes, which Quintus Serenus Sammonicus, his son, gave to Gordian the younger, to whom he was preceptor.</p><p>SERES, a people of the Farther Asia, bounded on the west by Scythia without Imaus, on the north and east by Terra Incognita, and on the south by India beyond the Ganges. According to these limits, their country answers nearly to Cathay or Northern China. Mela places them between the Indi and Scythæ, and perhaps beyond the Indi, if we distinguish them from the Sinæ. The ancients commend them for their cotton manufactures, different from the produce of the bombyces or silk-worms, called <hi rend="italic">seres</hi> by the Greeks ; and hence <hi rend="italic">serica</hi> means silk.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Seres,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Sims,</hi> a city of European Turkey, in the province of Rumelia, and the circle of the Bay of Contessa. It stands on a fine plain watered by the rivers Egrifu and Stromza ; but it is considered as unhealthy. It is surrounded with walls, which are in a neglected state. It contains ten mosques, several Greek and Armenian churches, and about thirty thousand inhabitants. It is the chief market for cotton wool, which is extensively cultivated on the fertile plains around it. It has also a considerable trade in rice, tobacco, and fruits of all kinds.</p><p>SERGE, a woollen quilted stuff, manufactured on a loom with four treddles, after the manner of rateens, and other stuffs that have the whale. The goodness of serges is known by the quilting, as that of cloths by the spinning. Of serges there are various kinds, denominated either from their different qualities or from the places where they are wrought. The most considerable is the London serge, which is now highly valued abroad.</p><p>The method of making the London serge we shall now describe. For wool, the longest is chosen for the warp, and the shortest for the woof. Before either kind is used, it is first scoured, by putting it into a copper of liquor somewhat more than lukewarm, composed of three parts of water and one of urine. After being kept long enough in it for the liquor to dissolve and take off the grease, it is stirred briskly about with a wooden peel, taken out of the liquor, drained, washed in a running water, and dried in the shade ; it is then beaten with sticks on a wooden rack to drive out the coarser dust and filth, and picked clean with the hands. Thus far prepared, it is greased with oil of olives, and the longest part, destined for the warp, is combed with large combs heated in a small furnace. To clear off the oil again, the wool is put in a liquor composed of hot water with soap melted in it ; whence being taken out, wrung, and dried, it is spun on the wheel.</p><p>As to the shorter wool, intended for the woof, it is only carded on the knee with small cards, and then spun on the wheel, without being scoured of its oil. It must be remarked, that the thread for the warp is always to be spun</p><p>much fincr, and better twisted, than that of the woof. The wool both for the warp and the woof being spun, and the thread divided into skains, that of the woof is put on spools fit for the cavity or eye of the shuttle, and that for the warp is wound on a kind of wooden bobbins to fit it for warping. When warped, it is stiffened with a kind of size, of which that made of the shreds of parchment is considered as the best, and when dry it is put on the loom.</p><p>When mounted on the loom, the workman, raising and lowering the threads, which are passed through a reed, by means of four treddles placed underneath the loom, which he makes to act transversely, equally, and alternately, one after another, with his feet, in proportion as the threads are raised and lowered, throws the shuttle across from one side to the other ; and, each time that the shuttle is thrown, and the thread of the woof is crossed between those of the warp, strikes it with the frame to which the reed is fastened ; through those teeth the threads of the warp pass ; and this stroke he repeats twice or thrice, or even more, till he judges the crossing of the serge sufficiently close. Thus he proceeds till the warp is all filled with woof.</p><p>The serge, now taken off the loom, is carried to the fuller, who scours it in the trough of his mill with a kind of fat earth called fuller’s earth, first purged of all stones and filth. After three or four hours’ scouring, the fuller’s earth is washed out in fair water, brought by little and little into the trough, out of which it is taken when all the earth is cleared ; then, with a kind of iron pincers, all the knots, ends, and straws sticking out on the surface on either side are pulled off ; and then it is returned into the fulling trough, where it is worked with water somewhat more than lukewarm, with soap dissolved in it, for nearly two hours. It is next washed till such time as the water becomes quite clear, and there be no signs of soap left, when it is taken out of the trough, the knots again pulled off, and put on the tenter to dry, taking care as fast as it dries to stretch it out both in length and breadth, till it be brought to its just dimensions. When well dried, it is taken off the tenter, and dyed, shorn, and pressed.</p><p>SERGEANT, or S<hi rend="smallcaps">erjeant</hi>, <hi rend="italic">at Law,</hi> or of the Coif, is the highest degree, taken at the common law, as that of doctor is of the civil law ; and as these are supposed to be the most learned and experienced in the practice of the courts, there is one court appointed for them to plead in by themselves, which is the Common Pleas, where the common law of England is most strictly observed. But they are not restricted from pleading in any other court, where the judges, who cannot have that honour till they have taken the degree of sergeant-at-law, call them brothers.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sergean-tat-Arms,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Mace,</hi> an officer appointed to attend the person of the king, to arrest traitors and such persons of quality as offend, and to attend the lord high steward when sitting in judgment on a traitor.</p><p>There are four other sergeants-at-arms, created in the same manners one, who attends the lord chancellor ; a second, the lord treasurer ; a third, the speaker of the House of Commons ; and a fourth, the lord mayor of London on solemn occasions.</p><p><hi rend="italic">common </hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps">Sergeant,</hi> an officer in the city of London, who attends the lord mayor and court of aldermen on court days, and is in council with them on all occasions, within and without the precincts or liberties of the city.
