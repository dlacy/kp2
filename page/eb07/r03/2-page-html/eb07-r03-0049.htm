<p><span class="font0">closest friendship. The princess, being a zealous admirer of the French </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">économistes,</span><span class="font0"> could make her conversation&nbsp;both amusing and instructive. She retailed all her statistical knowledge ; and finding the empress a willing hearer,&nbsp;she spoke of her in every company as a prodigy of knowledge, judgment, and philanthropy. Whilst the emperor,&nbsp;by his buifoonery and attachment to foreign manners, was&nbsp;daily incurring more and more the hatred of his subjects,&nbsp;the popularity of his wife was rapidly increasing ; and some&nbsp;persons about the court expressed their regret that so much&nbsp;knowledge of government, such love of humanity, and such&nbsp;ardent wishes for the prosperity of Russia, should only furnish conversations with Catharina Romanovna (the Princess&nbsp;Dashkoff). The empress and her favourite did not let these&nbsp;expressions pass unobserved, but continued their studies in&nbsp;concert ; and whilst the former was employed on her famous&nbsp;code of laws for a great empire, the latter always reported&nbsp;progress, till the middling circles of Moscow and St Petersburg began to speak familiarly of the blessings which they&nbsp;might enjoy if these speculations could be realized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Meanwhile Peter III. was giving fresh cause of discontent. He had recalled from Siberia Count Munnich, who was indeed a sensible, brave, and worthy man ; but Munnich,&nbsp;as he was smarting under the effects of Russian despotism,&nbsp;and had grounds of resentment against most of the great&nbsp;families, did not much discourage the emperor’s unpopular&nbsp;conduct, trying only to moderate it and give it a system.&nbsp;Peter, however, was impatient He publicly ridiculed the&nbsp;exercise and evolutions of the Russian troops ; and hastily&nbsp;adopting the Prussian discipline, without digesting and fitting it for the constitution of his own forces, he completely&nbsp;ruined himself by disgusting the army.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the midst of these imprudences, indeed, Peter was ’sometimes disturbed by the advice of virtuous counsellors.&nbsp;But these remonstrances produced only a temporary gleam&nbsp;of reformation, and he soon relapsed into his accustomed sensuality. What he lost in popularity was gained by&nbsp;the emissaries of Catherine. Four regiments of guards,&nbsp;amounting to eight thousand men, were speedily brought&nbsp;over by the three brothers Orlof, who had contrived to ingratiate themselves with their officers. The people at large&nbsp;were in a state of indifference, out of which they were partially roused by the following means. A little manuscript was&nbsp;handed about, containing principles of legislation for Russia,&nbsp;founded on natural rights, and on the claims of the different&nbsp;classes of people, which, insensibly formed, became so familiar as to appear natural. In that performance was proposed a convention of deputies from all the classes, and&nbsp;from every part of the empire, to converse, but without authority, on the subjects of which it treated, and to inform&nbsp;the senate of the result of their deliberations. It passed</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">for the work of her majesty, and was much admired.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">While Catherine was thus high in the public esteem and affection, the emperor took the alarm at her popularity, and&nbsp;in a few days came to the resolution of confining her for&nbsp;life, and then of marrying his favourite. The servants of&nbsp;that lady betrayed her to her sister, who imparted the intelligence to the empress. Catherine saw her danger, and&nbsp;mstantly formed her resolution. She must either tamely&nbsp;submit to perpetual imprisonment, and perhaps a cruel and&nbsp;ignominious death, or contrive to hurl her husband from&nbsp;his throne. No other alternative was left her, and the consequence was what was undoubtedly expected. The proper steps were taken. Folly fell before abilities and address,&nbsp;and in three days the revolution was accomplished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When the emperor saw that all was lost he attempted to enter Cronstadt from Oranienbaum, a town on the Gulf&nbsp;of Finland, thirty versts, or nearly twenty-six miles, from&nbsp;St Petersburg. The sentinels at the harbour presented&nbsp;their muskets at the barge ; and though they were not&nbsp;loaded, and the men had no cartridges, he drew back.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Munnich received him again, and exhorted him to mount his horse and head his guards, swearing to live and die&nbsp;with him. He said, “ No, I see it cannot be done without&nbsp;shedding much of the blood of my brave Holsteiners. I&nbsp;am not worthy of the sacrifice.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Six days had already elapsed since the revolution, and that great event had been apparently terminated without&nbsp;any violence that might leave odious impressions upon the&nbsp;mind of the public. Peter had been removed from Peterhof to a pleasant retreat called Ropscha, about thirty miles&nbsp;from St Petersburg ; and here he supposed he should be&nbsp;detained but a short time previous to his being sent into&nbsp;Germany. He therefore transmitted a message to Catherine,&nbsp;desiring permission to have for his attendant a favourite negro, and that she would send him a dog, of which he was&nbsp;very fond, together with his violin, a bible, and a few romances ; telling her that disgusted with the wickedness of&nbsp;mankind, he was resolved henceforth to devote himself to&nbsp;a philosophical life. However reasonable these requests,&nbsp;not one of them was granted, and his plans of wisdom were&nbsp;turned into ridicule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the mean time the soldiers were amazed at what they had done. They .could not conceive by what fascination&nbsp;they had been hurried so far as to dethrone the grandson&nbsp;of Peter the Great, in order to give his crown to a German&nbsp;woman. The majority, without plan or consciousness of&nbsp;what they were doing, had been mechanically led on by the&nbsp;movements of others ; and each individual now reflecting&nbsp;on his baseness, after the pleasure of disposing of a crown&nbsp;had vanished, was filled only with remorse. The sailors,&nbsp;who had never been engaged in the insurrection, openly&nbsp;reproached the guards in the tippling-houses with having&nbsp;sold their emperor for beer. One night a band of soldiers&nbsp;attached to the empress took the alarm, from an idle fear,&nbsp;and exclaimed that their mother was in danger, and that&nbsp;she must be awaked, that they might see her. During the&nbsp;next night there was a fresh commotion more serious than&nbsp;the former. So long as the life of the emperor left a pretext for inquietude, it was thought that no tranquillity was&nbsp;to be expected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On the sixth day of the emperor’s imprisonment at Rop-scha, Alexei Orlof, accompanied by an officer named Tep-loff, came to him with the news of his speedy deliverance, and asked permission to dine with him. According to the&nbsp;custom of that country, wine glasses and brandy were&nbsp;brought previous to dinner ; and while the officer amused&nbsp;the czar with some trifling discourse, his chief filled the&nbsp;glasses, and poured a poisonous mixture into that which he&nbsp;intended for the prince. The czar, without any distrust&nbsp;swallowed the potion, on which he immediately experienced&nbsp;the most severe pains ; and on his being offered a second&nbsp;glass, on pretence of its giving him relief, he refused it, with&nbsp;reproaches against him that offered it. He called aloud for&nbsp;milk, but the two monsters offered him poison again, and&nbsp;pressed him to take it A French valet-de-chambre, greatly&nbsp;attached to him, now ran in. Peter threw himself into his&nbsp;arms, saying in a faint tone of voice, “ It was not enough,&nbsp;then, to prevent me from reigning in Sweden, and to deprive me of the crown of Russia. I must also be put to&nbsp;death.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The valet-de-chambre presumed to intercede for his master ; but the two miscreants forced this dangerous witness out of the room, and continued their ill treatment of&nbsp;the czar. In the midst of this tumult the younger of the&nbsp;Princes Baratinsky came in, and joined the two former.&nbsp;Orlof, who had already thrown down the emperor, was&nbsp;pressing upon his breast with both his knees, and firmly&nbsp;griping his throat with his hand. The unhappy monarch&nbsp;now struggling with that strength which arises from despair, the two other assassins threw a napkin round his neck,&nbsp;and put an end to his life by suffocation.</span></p>
