Before his arrival in Italy, Cinna had been killed in a mutiny of his own troops ; and none of the other leaders possessed talent and influence enough to make head against him. After a short but severe struggle, Sylla prevailed, and immediately commenced his dreadful, deliberate, and systematic course of retribution. All who had either taken part directly with Marius, or who were suspected of attachment to the democratic party, were put to death without mercy, and, what was almost more terrible,'apparently without wrath. Sylla even produced publicly a list of those whom hehad doomed to death, and offered a reward for the heads of each. He thus set the example of proscription which was afterwards so fatally imitated in the various convulsions of the state. His next step was to depopulate entirely several of those Italian states which had joined the Marian faction, and to parcel out the lands among his own veteran troops, whom he thus at once rewarded and disbanded in the only manner likely to reconcile them to peaceful habits. Having thus satiated his revenge, his next care was to reform and re-construct the constitution and government of the state, shattered to pieces by iong and fierce intestine convulsions. He caused himself to be appointed dictator for an unlimited time. He restrained tbe influence of the tribunes, by abolishing their legislative privileges, reformed and regulated the magistracy, limited the authority of governors of provinces, enacted police regulations for the maintenance of public tranquillity, deprived several of the Italian states of their right of citizenship, and having supplied the due number of the senate by additions from the equestrian order, he restored to it the possession of the judicative power.</p><p>Having at length completed his career as a political reformer, Sylla voluntarily resigned his dictatorship, which he had held for nearly three years, declared himself ready to answer any accusation that could be made against him during his administration, walked unmolested in the streets as a private person, and then withdrew to his villa near Cumæ, where he amused himself with hunting and other rural recreations. Whether his retirement might have remained long undisturbed by the relatives of his numerous victims, cannot be known, as he died in the year after his abdication of power, leaving, by his own direction, the following characteristic inscription to be engraved on his tomb: “Here lies Sylla, who was never outdone in good offices by his friend, nor in acts of hostility by his enemy.”</p><p>The civil wars between Marius and Sylla may be considered even more worthy the careful study of the historian, than those between Pompey and Cæsar, fbr a right understanding of the circumstances which led to the destruction of Roman liberty, as the latter but concluded what the former had begun. Indeed, the strife between Marius and Sylla was itself the natural sequel of that contest between the aristocratic and the democratic factions, if they ought not rather to be termed the factions of wealth and poverty, which gave rise to the sedition of the Gracchi, and which being conducted on both sides with no spirit of mutual concession, none of mutual regard for the public welfare, deepened into the most bitter and rancorous animosity, such as could end in nothing but mutual destruction. Ofthe worst spirit of democracy, we see in Marius what may be called a personification ; fierce, turbulent, sanguinary, relentless ; brave to excess, but savagely ferocious ; full of wily stratagems, in order to gain his object, then dashing from him every hard-won advantage by his reckless brutality. On the other hand, the aristocratic spirit had its representa</p><p>tive in Sylla ; haughty, cautious, and determined, forming his schemes with deep forethought, prosecuting them with deliberate perseverance, and abandoning them with cold contempt when his object was accomplished. He held his dictatorial sway till he had satiated his revenge, and re-established, as he thought, the government on an aristocratical basis, then scornfully laid aside his power, and yielded himself to voluptuous indulgence. By these men it was madeclearly evident that Rome no longer possessed sufficient public or private virtue to maintain her republican institutions ; that she was tottering on the very brink of a complete and final revolution, leading with fatal certainty to a military despotism ; and the only question was, whether her despotic ruler should be a Marius or a Sylla ; whether he should spring from among the democratic populace, or the aristocratic nobility ; a question not long to be left in doubt.</p><p>Many of the laws enacted by Sylla were of a very wise and beneficial character, though their general aim was too manifestly the restoration of aristocratic power to the senate. What effect his personal influence, had his life been prolonged, might have had in consolidating his political reforms, cannot certainly be known, though it may very safely be conjectured that not even his power could long have prevented new convulsions. The malady lay too deep to be reached by any merely political measures of a remedial nature. It had its essence in the degeneracy and moral turpitude of the entire body of the republic, both nobles and people, which there was nothing in their external circumstances to prevent, or in their national religion to heal. Besides, as in the recent wars and revolutions, almost all property had experienced a change of possessors, there were vast numbers throughout all Italy eager for a counter revolution. Several young men also of abilities and ambition, were prepared to emulate the career of Marius or of Sylla, which could not be done without a renewal of that contest, the heavings of which had not yet wholly subsided. Of these, the chief were Lepidus, Crassus, Pompey, and Sertorius, and perhaps Lucullus.</p><p>Very soon after tile death of Sylla, the consul Lepidus, made an attempt to rescind the laws of Sylla. In this he was opposed both by his colleague Catulus, and by Pompey, who was now the head of the aristocratic party, to which he had attached himself before its final triumph over the Marian faction. Lepidus was declared a public enemy, defeated in battle, fled to Sardinia, and there died.</p><p>A more dangerous and protracted contest was waged in Spain, to which country Sertorius had withdrawn, and gathered around him the relics of the Marian party. For six years did this virtuous and heroic republican maintain a successful struggle against the whole power of Rome, defeated successive consular armies, and baffled even the experience of Metellus, with the skill and energy of Pompey. At length he was basely assassinated by Perpenna ; and upon the loss of their leader, his forces were easily subdued by Pompey, and Spain was reduced to obedience.</p><p>Before the termination of the Spanish war, one still more dangerous commenced in the very heart of Italy. Spartacus, a celebrated gladiator, a Thracian by birth, escaped from the gladiatorial training school at Capua, along with some of his companions, and was soon followed by great numbers of other gladiators. Bands of desperate men, slaves, murderers, robbers, pirates, flocked to him from all quarters ; and he soon found himself at the head of a force able to bid defiance to Rome. Four consular armies were successively defeated by this daring adventurer, and Rome itself was considered in imminent danger. But subordination could not be maintained in an army composed of such materials. Spartacus purposed to march into Gaul, invite Sertorius to join him, and then together march on Rome. Had this plan been carried into effect, Rome in all proba-</p><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
