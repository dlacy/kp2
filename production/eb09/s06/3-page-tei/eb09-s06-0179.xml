The non-appearance of this genus in Cuba is very remarkable.	<hi rend="smallcaps">(a. n.)</hi></p><p>SUGDEN, <hi rend="smallcaps">Edward Burtenshaw.</hi> See Sτ <hi rend="smallcaps">Leonards, Lord.</hi></p><p>SUHL, a manufacturing town in an isolated portion of Prussian Saxony, is picturesquely situated on the Lauter, on the southern slope of the Thuringian Forest, 6<hi rend="superscript">1</hi>/<hi rend="subscript">2</hi> miles to the north-east of Meiningen and 29 miles to the southwest of Erfurt. The armourers of Suhl are mentioned as early as the 9th century, but they enjoyed their highest vogue from 1550 to 1634. The knights of south Germany especially prized the swords and armour of this town, and many of the weapons used in the mediæval campaigns against the Turks and in the Seven Years’ War are said to have been manufactured at Suhl. Its old popular name of the “ armoury of Germany ” is more appropriate, however, to its past than to its present position, for, already seriously crippled by the ravages of the Thirty Years’ War and by frequent conflagrations, it has suffered considerably in more modern times from the competition of other towns, especially since the introduction of the needle-gun. It still contains, however, large factories for firearms (military and sporting) and side arms, besides iron-works, machine- works, potteries, and tanneries. The once considerable manufacture of fustian has declined. A brine spring (Soolquelle) at the foot of the neighbouring Domberg is said to have given name to the town. The population in 1880 was 9937 and 10,605 in 1885. Suhl, made a town in 1527, belonged to the early principality of Henneberg, and formed part of the possessions of the kingdom of Saxony assigned to Prussia by the congress of Vienna.</p><p>SUICIDE. The phenomenon of suicide has at all times attracted a large amount of attention from moralists and social investigators. Though of very small dimensions, even in the countries where it is most prevalent, its existence is rightly looked upon as a sign of the presence of maladies in the body politic which, whether remediable or not, deserve careful examination. To those who look at human affairs from a theological standpoint, suicide necessarily assumes a graver aspect, being regarded, not as a minute and rather obscure disease of the social organism, but as an appalling sign of the tendency of man to resist the will of God. Compare <hi rend="smallcaps">Felo de Se. As</hi> a great number of persons are, either directly or indirectly, under the influence of the theological bias, and as the act of suicide is in itself of a striking character to the imagination, the importance of the phenomenon from a sociological point of view has been to some extent exaggerated, especially in those countries of the Continent where suicides are most numerous. Moreover, the matter has during the last twenty years become of direct interest to the Governments of those countries where the whole able-bodied male population are more or less under the control of a military organization ; for, rightly or wrongly, a portion of the recent considerable increase in the suicide rate of Prussia, Saxony, Austria, and France is attributed to dislike of military service. It may be observed in passing that the</p><p>suicide rate among soldiers is high in all countries, Great Britain not excepted, as was shown by Mr W. H. Millar in the <hi rend="italic">Journal of the Statistical Society,</hi> vol. xxxvii., 1874, and more recently by Dr Ogle in the same <hi rend="italic">Journals</hi> vol. xlix. (March), 1886. As enlistment is voluntary in the United Kingdom, the alleged dislike to conscription cannot be the sole cause of the high rate prevailing in some of the Continental states. Before referring to the more general characteristics of suicide, it will be well to furnish some idea of its magnitude in relation to the category of social phenomena to which it belongs, namely, death. The following tables are constructed for this purpose.
