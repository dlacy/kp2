<p><span class="font3">able. It is true Niebuhr@@<sup>1</sup> hazards another very ingenious conjecture. He thinks that Tarquinius may have been him-'self one oι the tribe of the Luceres, that Priscus may have&nbsp;been a name belonging to him, as one of a Priscan gens,&nbsp;or house, ana that the legend of his Etruscan conquests and&nbsp;acknowledged sovereignity may have some connexion with&nbsp;the much more ancient tradition of the fabulous Tuscan&nbsp;hero, Tarchon, to which the name Tarquinius itself may allude. It is sufficiently evident, that there did exist at some&nbsp;remote period, an intimate intercourse between Rome and&nbsp;the Etrusci ; and there appears to have been some connexion between this Etruscan influence and the tribe ofthe&nbsp;Luceres. What the exact nature and extent of this Etruscan intercourse and influence were, it seems a hopeless task&nbsp;to inquire, and it would be fruitless to indulge in framing&nbsp;conjectures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is stated, that Tarquinius wished to add to the centuries of the Equites, established by Romulus, three new centuries, and to call them by his own name, and the names&nbsp;of his friends. In this intention he was opposed by the&nbsp;augur Attus Navius, who affirmed that what had been instituted with augury, could not be changed without it, and&nbsp;that the omens forbade any change. The king, in order to&nbsp;cast discredit on the art ofthe augur, asked him to divine&nbsp;whether what he was then thinking of could be done. The&nbsp;augur observed the omens, and answered that it could. “ I&nbsp;was thinking,” said the king, “ whether you could cut this&nbsp;whetstone in two with a knife.” Navius instantly took the&nbsp;whetstone, and cut it sheer asunder, to the amazement of&nbsp;the king. This proof of the augur’s skill caused Tarquinius to desist from his intention to its full extent ; and he&nbsp;.merely added to each of the former centuries a second or&nbsp;latter century under the same name. In this legend may&nbsp;be contained an account of the opposition which Tarquinius&nbsp;experienced from the patrician body, when he purposed to&nbsp;raise a number of the most distinguished of the free citizens&nbsp;to the equestrian rank,—an opposition to which he was&nbsp;so far obliged to yield.@@<sup>2</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It has been already stated, that the constitution of Rome@@<sup>3 </sup>was founded on the patriarchal principle, as to its essential&nbsp;characteristic, while the numerical divisions of the government by tens were arbitrary, so far as can be traced. Every&nbsp;head of a house was an integral member of the state, as a&nbsp;free citizen ; but there is no very manifest reason why&nbsp;houses should have been aggregated into </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">tens,</span><span class="font3"> or curiæ,&nbsp;these into other </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">tens</span><span class="font3"> forming the senate, or patres, of one&nbsp;hundred. But this division or rather aggregation having been&nbsp;adopted, it influenced all the arrangements of the body politic, both in peace and war. While there was but one&nbsp;people, the followers of Romulus, there was but one tribe,&nbsp;the Ramnenses, or, as some term it, the Ramnes, and the senate amounted to one hundred. Upon the junction ofthe&nbsp;Sabines, there were two tribes, the Titienses or Tities being added, and consequently the senate then numbered two&nbsp;hundred. The elevation of the third tribe, the Luceres,&nbsp;completed the number of curiæ, decuriæ, tribes, and senators, till thirty and three hundred became the ruling numbers in this division.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is worth remarking, that, according to the statement of ancient authors, when Romulus formed the Pomœrium,&nbsp;including all that composed ancient Rome, his city merely&nbsp;contained one thousand wretched huts, clustered together on&nbsp;the Palatine hill. Now, if it could be shewn that the union&nbsp;of ten families formed a house, ten houses a curia, and ten&nbsp;curiæ the entire tribe, we should have the exact number of&nbsp;the first huts erected on the Palatine, and of the primitive&nbsp;mansions of the Roman fathers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The army followed in its construction the numerical ar</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font3">rangement of the people. The earliest Roman legion could contain no more than the male inhabitants of Rome, which&nbsp;would be at that time only a thousand capable of bearing&nbsp;arms. As the senate was formed from the hundred chief&nbsp;men of the curiæ, so there were an hundred of the braves&nbsp;selected from the curiæ to fight on horseback. Thus th</span><span class="font0">∣</span><span class="font3">&nbsp;equites, or knights, were at first equal in number with tin&nbsp;senate, and equal in rank, as members of the curiæ, thougl&nbsp;not senators, because not the heads of the curiæ. Whel&nbsp;the senate was increased to three hundred, by the additior&nbsp;of the other two tribes, there were also three centuries oι&nbsp;hundreds of knights, retaining the proportion. The legion&nbsp;would then consist of 3000 infantry, and 300 cavalry ; and&nbsp;though in later periods the numbers of the infantry were&nbsp;increased, 300 continued to be the legitimate number of&nbsp;cavalry in a legion. Although the name remained, the&nbsp;numbers fluctuated according to the dictates of policy or necessity, so that when we read of a century, we are not to&nbsp;assume that an hundred is meant, and neither more nor&nbsp;less.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Adopting recognised terms and divisions, Servius, in his endeavours to improve the constitution of Rome, divided&nbsp;the large body of unprivileged yet free citizens, the plebs,&nbsp;or true commons, into thirty tribes, according to the thirty&nbsp;curiæ of the senatorial patricians. Of these thirty tribes&nbsp;four were contained in the city itself, and the remaining&nbsp;twenty-six in the lands that had been added to the dominions of Rome by conquest. Each tribe was under the dominion of a magistrate of their own body, called a Tribunus.&nbsp;There were also judges appointed, three for each tribe, to&nbsp;determine private causes among the plebeian citizens.&nbsp;For the appointment of these official persons, and other matters connected with their own interests, the plebeians were&nbsp;empowered to hold their own meetings, called the comitia&nbsp;tributa. These were held on the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">nundinœ,</span><span class="font3"> or market days,&nbsp;when the country people came to Rome, and in the forum&nbsp;or market-place adjacent to the comitium, or meeting place&nbsp;of the patricians, but quite distinct from it. These comitia&nbsp;tributa were entirely plebeian, and at first referred only to&nbsp;the decision of disputes respecting private rights among the&nbsp;plebeians themselves. They were not convoked by the patricians, nor held under patrician auspices. They had nothing to&nbsp;do with national affairs as such, but were confined entirely&nbsp;to the private business of </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">tile </span><span class="font3">plebeian order. Neither had&nbsp;the patricians at first any thing to do with this plebeian assembly : they formed no part of it, and had no authority&nbsp;over it. Yet, though thus distinct from the state in its original formation, it gave an organized form to the plebeian&nbsp;body, which soon proved its importance, as the very thews&nbsp;and sinews of the body politic, and therefore essential to its&nbsp;growth and strength.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The institution of the comitia tributa, though at first of an entirely private character with reference to the state,&nbsp;tended to the formation of a new assembly, in which all&nbsp;the orders of the people were included, and arranged&nbsp;for the discussion of public affairs. It was not possible&nbsp;that the plebeian body could be so far organized as to have&nbsp;its own, magistracy, elected by itself in an assembly of its&nbsp;own, without producing an early necessity for its admission into the state ; for organization both gives power, and&nbsp;the consciousness of power, in the body politic. The most&nbsp;natural occasion and mode ofits admission, had amilitary origin and character, like mostof the other Roman institutions.&nbsp;Though the patricians and plebeians remained completely&nbsp;distinct in their civic character, and in the time of peace, yet&nbsp;in the time of war they acted together in one great body, tl ιe&nbsp;army. The arrangements of the army were therefore those&nbsp;which led to their junction in another aspect, and were in</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
