<p><span class="font1">of time, very few specimens now remain, the regals are often mentioned in old wills and inventories, such as the list of Henry VIII.’s musical instruments made after his death by Sir Philip Wilder&nbsp;(Brit. Mus. Harleian MS. 1415, fol. 200 seq.), in which no fewer than&nbsp;thirteen pairs of single and five pairs of double regals are mentioned.&nbsp;Monteverde scored for the regals in his operas, and the instrument is&nbsp;described and figured by S. Virdung in 1511, Martin Agricola in&nbsp;1528, and Ottmar Luscinius in 1536, as well as by Michael Praetorius&nbsp;in 1618.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(K. S.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">REGALIA (Lat. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">regalis,</span><span class="font2"> royal, from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">rex,</span><span class="font2"> king), the ensigns of royalty. The crown (see Crown and Coronet) and sceptre&nbsp;(see Sceptre) are dealt with separately. Other ancient symbols&nbsp;of royal authority are bracelets, the sword, a robe or man tIe,&nbsp;and, in Christian times, a ring. Bracelets, as royal emblems,&nbsp;are mentioned in the Bible in connexion with Saul (2 Sam. i. 10),&nbsp;and they have been commonly used by Eastern monarchs.&nbsp;In Europe their later use seems to have been fitfully confined&nbsp;to England, although they were a very ancient ornament for&nbsp;kings among the Teutonic races. Two coronation bracelets&nbsp;are mentioned among the articles of the regalia ordered to be&nbsp;destroyed at the time of the Commonwealth, and two new&nbsp;ones were made at the Restoration. These are of gold, 1½ in.&nbsp;in width, and ornamented with the rose, thistle, harp and&nbsp;fleur-de-lis in enamel round them. They have not been used&nbsp;for modern coronations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The sword is one of the usual regalia of most countries, and is girded on to the sovereign during the coronation. In England&nbsp;the one sword has been developed into five. The Sword of&nbsp;State is borne before the sovereign on certain state occasions,&nbsp;and at the coronation is exchanged for a smaller sword, with&nbsp;which the king is ceremonially girded. The three other swords&nbsp;of the regalia are the “ Curtana,” the Sword of Justice to the&nbsp;Spirituality, and the Sword of Justice to the Temporality.&nbsp;The Curtana has a blade cut off short and square, indicating&nbsp;thereby the quality of mercy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The mantle, as a symbol of royalty, is almost universal, but in the middle ages other quasi-priestly robes were added to&nbsp;it (see Coronation). The English mantle was formerly made&nbsp;of silk; latterly cloth of gold has been used. The ring, by&nbsp;which the sovereign is wedded to his kingdom, is not of so wide&nbsp;a range of usage. That of the English kings held a large ruby&nbsp;with a cross engraved on it. Recently a sapphire has been&nbsp;substituted for the ruby. Golden spurs, though included&nbsp;among the regalia, are merely used to touch the king’s feet,&nbsp;and are not worn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The orb and cross was not anciently placed in the king’s hands during the coronation ceremony, but was carried by&nbsp;him in the left hand on leaving the church. It is emblematical&nbsp;of monarchical rule, and is only used by a reigning sovereign.&nbsp;The idea is undoubtedly derived from the globe with the figure&nbsp;of Victory with which the Roman emperors are depicted. The&nbsp;larger orb of the English regalia is a magnificent ball of gold,&nbsp;6 in. in diameter, with a band round the centre edged with&nbsp;gems and pearls. A similar band arches the globe, on the&nbsp;top of which is a remarkably fine amethyst 1½ in. in height,&nbsp;upon which rests the cross of gold outlined with diamonds.&nbsp;There is a smaller orb made for Mary II., who reigned jointly&nbsp;with King William III.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The English regalia, with one or two exceptions, were made for the coronation of Charles II. by Sir Robert Vyner. The&nbsp;Scottish regalia preserved at Edinburgh comprise the crown,&nbsp;dating, in part, from Robert the Bruce, the sword of state&nbsp;given to James IV. by Pope Julius II., and two sceptres.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Besides regalia proper, certain other articles are sometimes included under the name, such as the ampulla for the holy oil, and&nbsp;the coronation spoon. The ampulla is of solid gold in the form of&nbsp;an eagle with outspread wings. It weighs 10 oz., and holds 6 oz.&nbsp;of oil. The spoon was not originally used for its present purpose.&nbsp;It is of the 12th or 13th century, with a long handle and egg-shaped bowl. Its history is quite unknown.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">REGENERATION OF LOST PARTS. A loss and renewal of living material, either continual or periodical, is a familiar&nbsp;occurrence in the tissues of higher animals. The surface of&nbsp;the human skin, the inner lining of the mouth and respiratory&nbsp;organs, the blood corpuscles, the ends of the nails, and many&nbsp;other portions of tissues are continuously being destroyed and&nbsp;replaced. The hair of many mammals, the feathers of birds,&nbsp;the epidermis of reptiles, and the antlers of stags are shed and&nbsp;replaced periodically. In these normal cases the regeneration&nbsp;depends on the existence of special formative layers or groups&nbsp;of cells, and must be regarded in each case as a special adaptation&nbsp;, with individual limitations and peculiarities, rather than&nbsp;as a mere exhibition of the fundamental power of growth and&nbsp;reproduction displayed by living substance. Many tissues,&nbsp;even in the highest animals, are capable of replacing an abnormal loss of substance. Thus in mammals, portions of&nbsp;muscular tissue, of epithelium, of bone, and of nerve, after&nbsp;accidental destruction or removal, may be renewed. The&nbsp;characteristic feature of such cases appears to be, in the higher&nbsp;animals at any rate, that lost cells are replaced only from cells&nbsp;of the same morphological order—epiblastic cells from the&nbsp;epiblast, mesoblastic from the mesoblast, and so forth. It is&nbsp;also becoming clear that, at least in the higher animals, regeneration is in intimate relation with the central nervous system.&nbsp;The process is in direct relation to the general power of growth&nbsp;and reproduction possessed by protoplasm, and is regarded by&nbsp;pathologists as the consequence of “ removal of resistances to&nbsp;growth.” It is much less common in the tissues of higher&nbsp;plants, in which the adult cells have usually lost the power of&nbsp;reproduction, and in which the regeneration of lost parts is&nbsp;replaced by a very extended capacity for budding. Still,&nbsp;more complicated reproductions of lost parts occur in many&nbsp;cases, and are more difficult to understand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In Amphibia the entire epidermis, together with the slime-glands and the integumentary sense-organs, is regenerated by the epidermic&nbsp;cells in the vicinity of the defect. The whole limb of a Salamander&nbsp;or a Triton will grow again and again after amputation. Similar&nbsp;renewal is either rarer or more difficult in the case of Siren and Proteus. In frogs regeneration of amputated limbs does not usually&nbsp;take place, but instances have been recorded. Chelonians, crocodiles&nbsp; and snakes are unable to regenerate lost parts to any extent,&nbsp;while lizards and geckoes possess the capacity in a high degree.&nbsp;The capacity is absent almost completely in birds and mammals.&nbsp;In coelenterates, worms, and tunicates the power is exhibited in a&nbsp;very varying extent. In Hydra, Nais, and Lumbriculus, after&nbsp;transverse section, each part may complete the whole animal.&nbsp;In most worms the greater, and in particular the anterior part,&nbsp;will grow a new posterior part, but the separated posterior portion&nbsp;dies. In Hydra, sagittal and horizontal amputations result in the&nbsp;completion of the separated parts. In worms such operations&nbsp;result in death, which no doubt may be a mere consequence of the&nbsp;more severe wound. Extremely interesting instances of regeneration are what are called “ Heteromorphoses,” where the removed&nbsp;part is replaced by a dissimilar structure. The tail of a lizard,&nbsp;grown after amputation, differs in structure from the normal tail:&nbsp;the spinal cord is replaced by an epithelial tube which gives off no&nbsp;nerves; the vertebrae are replaced by an unsegmented cartilaginous tube; very frequently “super-regeneration&quot; occurs, the&nbsp;amputated limb or tail being replaced by double </span><span class="font2">or </span><span class="font1">multiple&nbsp;new structures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">J. Loeb produced many heteromorphoses on lower animals. He lopped off the polyp head and the pedal disc of a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tubularia,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">and supported the lopped stem in an inverted position in the sand;&nbsp;the original pedal end, now superior, gave rise to a new polyp head,&nbsp;while the neck-end, on regeneration, formed a pedal disc. In&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cerianthus,</span><span class="font1"> a sea-anemone, and in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cione,</span><span class="font1"> an ascidian, regeneration&nbsp;after his operations resulted in the formation of new mouth-openings&nbsp;in abnormal places, surrounded by elaborate structures characteristic of normal mouths. Other observers have recorded heteromorphoses in Crustacea, where antennulae have been regenerated&nbsp;in place of eyes. It appears that, in the same fashion as more&nbsp;simply organized animals display a capacity for reproduction of&nbsp;lost parts greater than that of higher animals, so embryos and&nbsp;embryonic structures generally have a higher power of renewal&nbsp;than that displayed by the corresponding adult organs or organisms.&nbsp;Moreover, experimental work on the young stages of organisms has&nbsp;revealed a very striking series of phenomena, similar to the hetero-morphoses in adult tissues, but more extended in range. H. Driesch,&nbsp;O. Hertwig and others, by separating the segmentation spheres,&nbsp;by destroying some of them, by compressing young embryos by&nbsp;glass plates, and by many other means, have caused cells to develop</span></p>
