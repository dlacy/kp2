<p><span class="font2">rence in 1723, of the writings on the motion of rivers. From them we have extracted the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">only precise observations&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">which are to be found in the whole work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Po Grande receives no river from Stellata to the sea, and its slope in that interval is found most surprisingly&nbsp;uniform, namely, six inches in the mile (reduced to English&nbsp;measure). The breadth in its great freshes is 759 feet at&nbsp;Lago Scuro, with a very uniform depth of thirty-one feet.&nbsp;In its lowest state (in which it is called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Po Magra),</span><span class="font2"> its&nbsp;breadth is not less than 700, and its depth about ten and a&nbsp;half.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Rheno has a uniform declivity from the Ponte Emilio to Vigarano of fifteen inches per mile. Its breadth in its greatest freshes is 189 feet, and its depth nine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Signor Corrade in his report says, that in the state of the great freshes the velocity of the Rheno is most exactly&nbsp;four fifths of that of the Po.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Grandi says, that, according to many observations of his own, a great fresh in the Rheno employs twelve hours to&nbsp;come from Ponte Emilio to Vigarano, which is thirty miles.&nbsp;This is a velocity of forty-four inches per second. And, by&nbsp;Corrade<sup>,</sup>s proportion, the velocity of the Po Grande must&nbsp;be fifty-five inches per second.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Montanari’s observation gives the Po Magra a velocity of thirty-one inches per second.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Let us compare these velocities with the velocities calculated by Du Buat’s formula.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The hydraulic mean depths </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">d</span><span class="font2"> and D of the Rheno and Po in the great freshes, deduced from the above measures,&nbsp;are 98∙6 and 344 inches; and their slopes s and S are 5⅛¾&nbsp;and ttj¼stj. This will give</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">307 (√D-0∙1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sub>v</sub>,g_L √</span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:line-through;">g + χ∙6</span><span class="font3">—θ'<sup>3</sup> (*<sup>z</sup>D—0-1) =52-176 inches, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">307(√5-0∙l) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, _</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:line-through;">√sL√s~+W ~ <sup>θ</sup>&quot;<sup>3 (Vd</sup>~ °<sup>-1)</sup> = <sup>4θ</sup>'<sup>727 inche8</sup>∙</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">These results differ very little from the velocities above mentioned. And if the velocity corresponding to a depth&nbsp;of thirty-one feet be deduced from that observed by Mon-tanari in the Po Magra ten feet deep, on the supposition&nbsp;that they are in the proportion of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vd,</span><span class="font2"> it will be found to be&nbsp;about fifty-three and a half inches per second.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This comparison is therefore highly to the credit of the theory, and would have been very agreeable to Du Buat&nbsp;had he known it, as we hope it is to our readers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We have collected many accounts of water-pipes, and made the comparisons, and we flatter ourselves that these&nbsp;have enabled us to improve the theory. They shall appear in their proper place ; and we may just observe here,&nbsp;that the two-inch pipe, which we formerly spoke of as conveying the water to Dunbar, should have yielded only 25</span><span class="font1">∣</span><span class="font2">&nbsp;Scotch pints per minute by the formula, instead of 27 ; a&nbsp;small error.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We have, therefore, no hesitation in saying, that this single formula of the uniform motion of water is one of the&nbsp;most valuable presents which natural science and the arts&nbsp;have received during the course of this century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">307</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">calculated for every declivity that can occur in water-pipes, canals, or rivers, is given in the article Water-works.&nbsp;Aided by this, which supersedes the only difficult part of&nbsp;the computation, a person can calculate the velocity for any</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">proposed case in less than five minutes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We have now established in some measure a Theory of Hydraulics, by exhibiting a general theorem which expresses the relation of the chief circumstances of all such&nbsp;motions as have attained a state of permanency, in so far as</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font2">this depends on the magnitude, form, and slope of the channel. This permanency we have expressed by the term train, saying that the stream is </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">in train.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We proceed to consider the subordinate circumstances contained in this theorem; such as, 1st, The forms which&nbsp;nature or art may give to the bed of a running stream, and&nbsp;the manner of expressing this form in our theorem. 2d, The&nbsp;gradations of the velocity, by which it decreases in the different filaments, from the axis or most rapid filament to the&nbsp;border ; and the connection of this with the mean velocity,&nbsp;which is expressed by our formula. 3d, Having acquired&nbsp;some distinct notions of this, we shall be able to see the&nbsp;manner in which undisturbed nature works in forming the&nbsp;beds of our rivers, the forms which she affects, and which&nbsp;we must imitate in all their local modifications, if we would&nbsp;secure that permanency which is the evident aim of all her&nbsp;operations. We shall here learn the mutual action of the&nbsp;current and its bed, and the circumstances which insure&nbsp;the stability of both. These we may call the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">regimen</span><span class="font2"> or the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">conservation</span><span class="font2"> of the stream, and may say that it is </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">in regimen,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">in conservation.</span><span class="font2"> This has a relation, not to the dimensions and the slope alone, or to the accelerating force and&nbsp;the resistance arising from mere inertia ; it respects immediately the tenacity of the bed, and is different from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">the&nbsp;train.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">4th, These pieces of information will explain the deviation of rivers from the rectilineal course, the resistance occasioned by these deviations, and the circumstances on which the regimen of a winding stream depends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">§ 1. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Of the Forms of the Channel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The numerator of the fraction which expresses the velocity of a river in train has √</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">d</span><span class="font2"> for one of its factors. That form, therefore, is most favourable to the motion which gives&nbsp;the greatest value to what we have called the hydraulic&nbsp;mean depth </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">d.</span><span class="font2"> This is the prerogative of the semicircle,&nbsp;and here </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">d</span><span class="font2"> is equal to half the radius ; and all other figures&nbsp;of the same area are the more favourable, as they approach&nbsp;nearer to a semicircle. This is the form, therefore, of ail&nbsp;conduit-pipes, and should be taken for aqueducts which are&nbsp;built of masonry. Ease and accuracy of execution, however,&nbsp;have made engineers prefer a rectangular form ; but neither&nbsp;of these will do for a channel formed out of the ground.&nbsp;We shall soon see that the semicircle is incompatible with&nbsp;a regimen ; and if we proceed through the regular polygons,&nbsp;we shall find that the half hexagon is the only one which&nbsp;has any pretensions to a regimen ; yet experience shows us,&nbsp;that even its banks are too steep for almost any soil. A dry&nbsp;earthen bank, not bound together by grass roots, will hardly&nbsp;stand with a slope of forty-five degrees ; and a canal which&nbsp;conveys running waters will not stand with this slope.&nbsp;Banks whose base is to their height as four to three will&nbsp;stand very well in moist soils, and this is a slope very usually given. Tllis form is even affected in the spontaneous&nbsp;operations of nature, in the channels which she digs for the&nbsp;rills and rivulets in the higher and steeper grounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This form has some mathematical and mechanical properties which entitle it to some further notice. Let ABEC (fig. 12) be such a trapezium, and AHGC the rectangle&nbsp;of equal width and depth. Bisect HB and EG by the verticals FD and KI, and draw the verticals 5B, eE. Because&nbsp;AH : HB = 3 : 4, we have AB = 5, and BD = 2, and&nbsp;FD = 3, and BD + DF = B A. From these premises it follows, that the trapezium ABEC</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">has the same area with the rect</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">angle FDIK ; for HB being bi</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">sected in D, the triangles AOF,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">BOD are equal. Also the border</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ABEC, which is touched by the</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">passing stream, is equal to FDIK.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
