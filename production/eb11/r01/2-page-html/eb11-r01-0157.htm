<p><span class="font1">Besides the publications already mentioned, he was author of the following;—</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ansichten der Volkswirthschaft, </span><span class="font1">1821; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Malthus&nbsp;und Say über die Ursachen der jetzigen Handelsstockung,</span><span class="font1"> 1821;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Grundriss der Kameralwissenschaft oder Wirthschaftslehre,</span><span class="font1"> 1823;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Über die Kameralwissenschaft, Entwickelung ihres Wesens und ihrer&nbsp;Theile,</span><span class="font1"> 1825; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Über die Landwirthschaft der Rheinpfalz,</span><span class="font1"> 1830; and&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Geschichte des Pfluges,</span><span class="font1"> 1845.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rau founded in 1834 the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Archiv der politischen Ökonomie und Polizeiwissenschaft,</span><span class="font1"> in which he wrote a number of articles, afterwards issued in separate form: amongst them may be named those&nbsp;on the debt of Baden, on the accession of Baden to the Zollverein,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">on </span><span class="font1">the crisis of the Zollverein in the summer of 1852, on the American&nbsp;banks, on the English poor law, on List’s national system of political&nbsp;economy and on the minimum size of a peasant property.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RAUCH, CHRISTIAN DANIEL (1777 -1857), German sculptor, was born at Arolsen in the principality of Waldeck on&nbsp;the 2nd of January 1777. His parents were poor and unable to&nbsp;place him under efficient masters. His first instructor taught&nbsp;him little else than the art of sculpturing gravestones, and&nbsp;Professor Ruhl of Cassel could not give him much more. A&nbsp;wider field of improvement opened up before him when he&nbsp;removed to Berlin in 1797; but he was obliged to earn a&nbsp;livelihood by becoming a royal lackey, and to practise his art in&nbsp;spare hours. Queen Louisa, surprising him one day in the act of&nbsp;modelling her features in wax, sent him to study at the Academy&nbsp;of Art. Not long afterwards, in 1804, Count Sandrecky gave&nbsp;him the means to complete his education at Rome, where&nbsp;William von Humboldt, Canova and Thorwaldsen befriended&nbsp;him. Among other works, he executed bas-reliefs of “ Hippolytus and Phaedra,” “ Mars and Venus wounded by Diomede,’’&nbsp;and a “ Child praying.’’ In 1811 Rauch was commissioned&nbsp;to execute a monument for Queen Louisa of Prussia, The&nbsp;statue, representing the queen in a sleeping posture, was&nbsp;placed in a mausoleum in the grounds of Charlottenburg, and&nbsp;procured great fame for the artist. The erection of nearly all&nbsp;public statues came to be entrusted to him. There were, among&nbsp;others, Bülow and Scharnhorst at Berlin, Blücher at Breslau,&nbsp;Maximilian at Munich, Francke at Halle, Dürer at Nuremberg,&nbsp;Luther at Wittenberg, and the grand-duke Paul Frederick at&nbsp;Schwerin. At length, in 1830, he began, along with Schinkel&nbsp;the architect, the models for a colossal equestrian monument at&nbsp;Berlin to Frederick the Great. This work was inaugurated with&nbsp;great pomp in May 1851, and is regarded as one of the masterpieces of modern sculpture. Princes decorated Rauch with&nbsp;honours and the academies of Europe enrolled him among their&nbsp;members. A statue of Kant for Königsberg and a statue of&nbsp;Thaer for Berlin occupied his attention during some of his last&nbsp;years; and he had just finished a model of “ Moses praying&nbsp;between Aaron and Hur ’’ when he was attacked by his last&nbsp;illness. He died on the 3rd of December 1857.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RAUCOURT, MLLE (1756-1815), French actress, whose real name was Françoise Marie Antoinette Saucerotte, was&nbsp;born in Nancy on the 3rd of March 1756, the daughter of an&nbsp;actor, who took her to Spain, where she played in tragedy at the&nbsp;age of twelve. By 1770 she was back in France at Rouen, and&nbsp;her success as Euphémie in Belloy’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Gaston el Bayard</span><span class="font2"> caused&nbsp;her to be called to the Comédie Française, where in 1772 she&nbsp;made her </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">début</span><span class="font2"> as Dido. She played all the classical tragedy&nbsp;parts to crowded houses, until the scandals of her private life&nbsp;and her extravagance ended her popularity. In 1776 she&nbsp;suddenly disappeared. Part of the ensuing three years she was&nbsp;in prison for debt, but some of the time she spent in the capitals&nbsp;of northern Europe, followed everywhere by scandal. Under&nbsp;protection of the queen she reappeared at the Théâtre Français&nbsp;in 1779, and renewed her success in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Phèdre,</span><span class="font2"> as Cleopatra, and&nbsp;all her former rôles. At the outbreak of the Revolution she&nbsp;was imprisoned for six months with other royalist members of&nbsp;the Comédie Française, and she did not reappear upon that&nbsp;stage until the close of 1793, and then only for a short time.&nbsp;She deserted, with a dozen of the best actors in the company,&nbsp;to found a rival colony, but a summons from the Directory&nbsp;brought her back in 1797. Napoleon gave her a pension, and&nbsp;in 1806 she was commissioned to organize and direct a company&nbsp;that was to tour Italy, where, especially in Milan, she was&nbsp;enthusiastically received. She returned to Paris a few months&nbsp;before her death on the 15th of January 1815. Her funeral&nbsp;was the occasion of </span><span class="font1">a </span><span class="font2">riot. The clergy of her parish having&nbsp;refused to receive the body, the crowd broke in the church&nbsp;doors, and were only restrained from further violence by the&nbsp;arrival of an almoner sent post-haste by Louis XVIII. She is&nbsp;buried at Père Lachaise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RAUDNITZ (Czech </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Roudnice nad Labem),</span><span class="font2"> a town of Bohemia, Austria, 44 m. N. of Prague by rail. Pop. (1900) 7986, mostly&nbsp;Czech. It is situated on the Elbe, and its chief attraction&nbsp;lies in the interesting and valuable collections in its château,&nbsp;which has belonged to the princely family of Lobkowitz since&nbsp;the beginning of the 17th century. These include a library&nbsp;with a large number of the earliest specimens of printing and&nbsp;valuable MSS., together with a scries of pictures from the&nbsp;time oI Charles V. to the Thirty Years’ War. In 1350 Cola di&nbsp;Rienzi, “ the last of the tribunes,’’ was confined by the emperor&nbsp;Charles IV. in the castle, which occupied the site of the present&nbsp;château, previous to his despatch under arrest to the pope at&nbsp;Avignon. In 1184 Raudnitz is mentioned as belonging to the&nbsp;see of Prague. The title of duke of Raudnitz was conferred on&nbsp;the head of the family of Lobkowitz by the emperor Joseph II.&nbsp;in 1786.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RAUMER, FRIEDRICH LUDWIG GEORG VON (1781-1873), German historian, was born at Wörlitz in Anhalt on the 14th of&nbsp;May 1781. His father (d. 1822), as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kammerdirektor</span><span class="font2"> in Anhalt,&nbsp;did excellent service to agriculture. After studying at the&nbsp;Joachimsthal Gymnasium, Berlin, and at the universities of&nbsp;Halle and Göttingen, Raumer began to practise law, and rose&nbsp;in the civil service under Hardenberg, the chancellor. He was&nbsp;made a professor at the university of Breslau in 1811, and&nbsp;in 1819 he became professor of political science and history&nbsp;at Berlin, holding the chair until 1847, and giving occasional&nbsp;lectures until 1853. In 1815 he had carried on historical investigations in Venice, and in the two following years he had&nbsp;travelled in Germany, Switzerland and Italy. In 1848 he was&nbsp;elected a member of the German parliament at Frankfort,&nbsp;where he associated himself with the right centre, supporting&nbsp;the proposal for a German empire under the supremacy </span><span class="font1">of&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">Prussia; and he was one of the deputation which offered the&nbsp;imperial crown to Frederick William IV. After the break-down of the German parliament, Raumer returned to Berlin,&nbsp;where he was made a member of the first chamber of the Prussian&nbsp;parliament. He died at Berlin on the 14th of June 1873.&nbsp;Raumer’s style is direct, lucid and vigorous, and in his day&nbsp;he was a popular historian, but judged by strictly scientific&nbsp;standards he does not rank among the first men of his time.</span></p>
