            <p>STANLEY CONTD and more comprehensive spirit of Christianity throughout the land.” Of his mother her
                son not only spoke, after her death in 1862, as “the guardian genius” that “had
                nursed his very mind and heart,” but described her as “gifted with a spiritual
                insight which belonged to that larger sphere of religion which is above and beyond
                the passing controversies of the day.” Arthur was their third child. His elder
                brother, Owen, died in 1850 at Sydney, after concluding, as commander of the
                “Rattlesnake” frigate, the survey of the Coral Sea. His sister Mary, well known for
                her work in the hospitals at Scutari and among the poor in London, died in 1880.
                Arthur was a child of highly sensitive organization and precocious intellectual
                activity. His boyish letters, journals, and poems were singularly like in their
                characteristic points to his later writings. But his extreme shyness and silence
                gave no promise of the social gifts which afterwards added so largely to his
                influence. At the age of fourteen his health, at one time alarmingly delicate, so
                far improved as to warrant his parents in sending him to Rugby, where Dr Arnold had
                been recently appointed head master. He remained at Rugby from 1829 to 1834, and of
                all Arnold’s pupils may be said to have been the one who most fully responded to the
                influence of his master’s teaching and character. In 1834 he became an undergraduate
                of Balliol College, Oxford, having obtained a scholarship in the previous year.
                Among his tutors at Balliol was Mr Tait, afterwards archbishop of Canterbury, and
                among his junior fellow scholars Benjamin Jowett, afterwards professor of Greek and
                master of Balliol. Arthur Stanley, after obtaining the Ireland scholarship and
                Newdigate prize for a remarkable English poem (on the Gipsies), was placed in the
                first class in 1837. In 1839, after a period of residence and study at Oxford, he
                was elected fellow of University College, and in the same year was admitted to holy
                orders. In 1840 he left England for a prolonged tour in Greece and Italy, and on his
                return settled at Oxford, where he resided from October 1841 for the next ten years,
                being actively engaged during term time as tutor of his college. He very shortly
                became an influential element in university life. His personal relations to his
                pupils were of a singularly close and affectionate nature, and the charm of his
                social gifts and genial character won him friends on all sides. His literary
                reputation was early established by the profound impression made by his <hi
                    rend="italic">Life of Arnold,</hi> whose sudden death had occurred in 1842, and
                whose biography, published in 1844, at once secured for its young author a high
                place among English writers. In 1845 he was appointed select preacher, and published
                in 1847 a volume of <hi rend="italic">Sermons and Essays on the Apostolic Aye,</hi>
                which not only laid the foundation of his fame as a preacher, but also marked his
                future position as a theologian. In university politics, which at that time wore
                mainly the form of theological controversy, he from the first took the place which
                he always retained of an uncompromising advocate of comprehension and toleration. As
                an undergraduate he had entirely sympathized with Dr Arnold in resenting the
                agitation led by, but not confined to, the High Church party in 1836 against the
                appointment of Dr Hampden to the regius professorship of divinity. As a young M.A.,
                during the long-continued agitation which followed the publication in 1841 of Tract
                No. 90, and which ended in the withdrawal of the present Cardinal Newman from the
                English Church, he used all his influence to protect from formal condemnation the
                leaders and tenets of the “Tractarian” party. In 1847 he did his utmost to resist
                the movement set on foot at Oxford against Dr Hampden’s appointment to the bishopric
                of Hereford. Finally, in 1850, in an article published in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Edinburgh Review</hi> in defence of the “Gorham judgment,” which had
                secured</p>
            <p>the position in the English Church of the Evangelical clergy, he asserted two
                principles which he maintained to the end of his life,—first, “ that the so-called
                supremacy of the crown in religious matters was in reality nothing else than the
                supremacy of law,” and, secondly, “ that the Church of England, by the very
                condition of its being, was not High, or Low, but Broad, and had always included,
                and been meant to include, opposite and contradictory opinions on points even more
                important than those at present under discussion.”</p>
            <p>It was not only in theological but in academical matters that his sympathies were on
                the liberal side. Though on many points of essentially conservative tendencies, he
                was greatly interested in university reform, and towards the end of his residence at
                Oxford acted as secretary to the royal commission appointed in 1850 to report on and
                to suggest improvements in the administrative and educational system of the
                university. Of the important changes in both these respects which, in the face of
                much opposition at the university, were carried out in due time under the sanction
                of parliament by an executive commission, Stanley, who took the principal share in
                drafting the report printed in 1852, was a strenuous advocate. These changes
                included the transference of the initiative in university legislation from the sole
                authority of the heads of houses to an elected and representative body, the opening
                of college fellowships and scholarships to competition by the removal of local and
                other restrictions, the non-enforcement at matriculation of subscription to the
                Thirty-nine Articles, and various steps taken to increase the usefulness and
                influence of the professoriate.</p>
            <p>Before the report was issued, Stanley, who had lost his father in 1849, and both his
                brothers, Captain Stanley mentioned above, and Charles, secretary to the governor of
                Van Diemen’s Land, within a few months of the same date, was appointed to a canonry
                in Canterbury cathedral. He held the office from 1851 till his return to Oxford.
                During his residence at Canterbury he published his <hi rend="italic">Memoir</hi> of
                his father Bishop Stanley (1851), and completed his <hi rend="italic">Commentary on
                    the Epistles to the Corinthians</hi> (1855). In the winter and spring of 1852-53
                he made the tour in Egypt and the Holy Land, the result of which was his well-known
                volume on <hi rend="italic">Sinai and Palestine,</hi> first published in 1856. In
                1857 he travelled in Russia, and collected much of the materials for his subsequent
                    <hi rend="italic">Lectures on the Greek Church,</hi> published in 1861. His <hi
                    rend="italic">Memorials of Canterbury,</hi> published in 1855, displayed the
                full maturity of his power of dealing with the events, scenes, and characters of
                past history which had marked him from childhood. Towards the close of the same
                period he accepted the office of examining chaplain to Dr Tait, his former tutor at
                Balliol and afterwards successor to Arnold at Rugby, on his transference from the
                deanery of Carlisle to the see of London.</p>
            <p>At the close of 1856 Stanley was appointed by the crown to the professorship of
                ecclesiastical history, a post which, with the canonry at Christ Church attached to
                the office, he held till 1863. In the first of three inaugural lectures the new
                professor announced his intention of beginning his treatment of the subject with
                “the first dawn of the history of the church,” the call of Abraham; and the first
                two volumes of his <hi rend="italic">History of the Jeιυish Church,</hi> published
                in 1863 and 1865, consist of the substance of lectures delivered by him in his
                capacity as professor. In 1861 he published the volume on the Greek Church already
                referred to. His second residence at Oxford was marked by the same power of winning
                personal influence which had distinguished him as a college tutor, and by the
                efforts which he made, in his wider sphere as professor, to bring together in social
                intercourse</p>
