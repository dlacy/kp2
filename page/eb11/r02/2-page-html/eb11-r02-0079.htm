Such a mode of artificial&nbsp;propagation, familiar in horticultural operations, has been made&nbsp;use of in such animals as sponges, and has been performed&nbsp;experimentally in hydroids and some worms. In many Protozoa&nbsp;asexual reproduction by simple division is a normal event. In&nbsp;Coelentera it is common, the plane of division usually passing&nbsp;through the long axis of the body, as in Actinians and many&nbsp;Hydroids, or being horizontal, as in the repeated divisions by&nbsp;which medusae are produced from an asexual polyp; the new&nbsp;individual may separate completely, or serve to build up a&nbsp;colonial or compound organism. In some Turbellarians&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Microslomum)</span><span class="font1"> and Chaetopods </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Syllis, Myrianida, Nereis,&nbsp;Eunice viridis</span><span class="font1"> (the palolo-worm of Samoa), asexual reproduction&nbsp;occurs in a form that is partly fission and partly budding;&nbsp;portions are constricted transversely or laterally, very much&nbsp;smaller than the whole animal, and these grow out into new&nbsp;animals which may separate or remain attached in chains. In&nbsp;Salps, chains are formed sometimes by transverse constriction,&nbsp;sometimes by budding. True budding is much more common&nbsp;than fission; it occurs in Protozoa, Coelentera, Sponges,&nbsp;Polyzoa, Tunicates and some Flatworms and Chaetopods, the&nbsp;bud being a multicellular portion of the tissues which is partly&nbsp;or completely separated from the parent before it proliferates&nbsp;into the new form. In various larval stages of many animals,&nbsp;asexual reproduction by fission or budding may be produced&nbsp;experimentally or may occur naturally. It has been suggested&nbsp;that cases of identical twins in vertebrates and many monstrous&nbsp;forms, including even dermoid cysts, are due to embryonic&nbsp;asexual fission or budding. The artificial subdivision of young&nbsp;embryos has been performed successfully by several investigators (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Heredity).</span><span class="font1"> In </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lumbricus Irapezoides</span><span class="font1"> the gastrula&nbsp;stage of the embryo divides and each half produces a complete&nbsp;individual; and multiplication by budding is common at various&nbsp;stages of the life-history of many parasitic worms.

<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">B. Sexual.—</span><span class="font1">Apart from the special and probably secondary •cases presently to be considered under the subheading </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">parthenogenesis,</span><span class="font1"> sexual reproduction or amphimixis may be defined as&nbsp;the production of a new organism from a zygote, and a zygote&nbsp;may be defined as the cell resulting from the conjugation of two&nbsp;gametes or sexual cells derived from the specialized reproductive&nbsp;tissue of the parent or parents. In asexual reproduction by&nbsp;spore formation, the spore proliferates without the aid of another&nbsp;spore; in true sexual reproduction the gametes may be regarded&nbsp;as special kinds of spores which appear in two forms, the eggcell, ovum or female gamete not proceeding to proliferate into&nbsp;a new organism until it has been stimulated by partial or&nbsp;complete fusion with the other form, the spermatozoon or male&nbsp;gamete. The act of fusion or conjugation in question is usually&nbsp;spoken of as fertilization, and the zygote, or starting-point of&nbsp;the new organism, is the fertilized egg-cell. Among protozoa&nbsp;and the lower plants there occur a series of forms of conjugation&nbsp;leading towards the specialized form characteristic of the sexual&nbsp;reproduction of higher animals. The conjugation may be&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Isogamous<sub>t</sub></span><span class="font1">  that is to say the conjugating cells may be actually&nbsp;or at least apparently indistinguishable. Tftie fusion between&nbsp;the cells may be complete, or may concern only the nuclei. The&nbsp;conjugation may be followed by reproduction, or may apparently&nbsp;have no relation to reproduction. In true sexual reproduction&nbsp;the conjugation is </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">heterogamous, i.e.</span><span class="font1"> the gametes are unhke;&nbsp;the fusion is chiefly nuclear, and the process is the prelude of the&nbsp;•development of the zygote into the. new organism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In all the Metazoa the gametes arise from special reproductive tissues which are supposed to contain (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Heredity)</span><span class="font1"> the&nbsp;reproductive material or germ-plasm. In the lower (or simpler&nbsp;and possibly degenerate Metazoa) the reproductive or germinal&nbsp;tissue consists of a few cells, sometimes in a group, sometimes&nbsp;scattered and sometimes migratory; in the vast majority of the&nbsp;Metazoa the germinal tissue becomes aggregated in distinct&nbsp;organs, of which those that give rise to ova or female gametes&nbsp;are known as the ovaries, and those that give rise to the spermatozoa or male gametes are known as the testes. The ovary&nbsp;and the testis are the primary reproductive organs; the details of&nbsp;their anatomy and position in the various groups need not be&nbsp;discussed here (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Reproductive System).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The male gamete or spermatozoon was first seen in 1677 by Ludwig van Hammen, a pupil of A. Leeuwenhoek, with the&nbsp;microscope that had been constructed by his master. Leeuwenhoek, under the influence of the current preformationist&nbsp;ideas, interpreted these actively moving bodies in the seminal&nbsp;fluids as preformed germs and described them as animalculae&nbsp;Spermetia or spermatozoa. Throughout the 18th century the&nbsp;general tendency was to regard them as parasites of no consequence in fertilization. In 1837 R. Wagner established that&nbsp;they were present in all sexually mature males and absent in&nbsp;infertile male hybrids, and in 1841 A. Kolliker showed that they&nbsp;were cells proliferated in the testes. The spermatozoon is one&nbsp;of the smallest of known cells, frequently being no more than one&nbsp;hundred thousandth of the size of the ovum, although the&nbsp;extraordinary case of a small </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cypris</span><span class="font1"> has been recorded in which&nbsp;the spermatozoa are longer than the animal. It is produced in&nbsp;enormous quantities and relatively to other minute cells is&nbsp;extremely tenacious of Ufe. It may retain its vitaUty in the male&nbsp;organism for a long time after it has become a separate cell,&nbsp;and may exist for lengthy periods in the female organism. The&nbsp;queen-bee is impregnated only once, and the spermatozoa may&nbsp;remain functional within her body for three years. Lord&nbsp;Avebury (Sir J. Lubbock) has described the case of a female ant&nbsp;which laid fertile eggs thirteen years after she had been impregnated. It is undoubted that in snakes, birds and many&nbsp;mammals, fertUization may not take place for many days after&nbsp;impregnation. The spermatozoa, with a few exceptions, are&nbsp;actively motile, being elongated in shape, with a Vibratile tail&nbsp;sometimes provided with a swimming membrane. In a few&nbsp;cases, chiefly of crustaceans, the spermatozoa are spherical with&nbsp;radiating processes, but are capable of amoeboid movements.&nbsp;The ceU nucleus is generally situated near the rounded or pointed&nbsp;extremity, with a centrosome immediately behind it, whilst the&nbsp;scanty protoplasm forms the body and vibratile tail; but there&nbsp;appears to be no general significance in the various configurations that occur amongst different animals. The process of&nbsp;spermatogenesis, or production of spermatozoa from the permanent ceUs of the testis, varies extremely amongst different&nbsp;animals and has been the subject of many elaborate investigations and much confusing nomenclature. Two factors are&nbsp;involved: first, the arrangements to produce a very large crop&nbsp;of ceUs so to provide for the enormous numbers of spermatozoa&nbsp;produced by most animals; and second, the final changes of shape&nbsp;and of nucleus by which the ripe spermatozoa arise from the&nbsp;indifferent testis-ceUs, and these processes may to a certain&nbsp;extent overlap. The point of general significance relates to the&nbsp;nuclear changes. The nuclear matter that occurs in the tissue&nbsp;cells of animals, when these cells divide, breaks up into a number&nbsp;of chromosomes constant for each kind of animal, and the final&nbsp;stage of ceU division is such that each chromosome splits and&nbsp;contributes a half to each daughter cell, so that the latter come&nbsp;to contain the number of chromosomes pecuUar to the animal in&nbsp;which they occur. In the case of spermatozoa, however, a&nbsp;“ reducing ” division occurs, in which the chromosomes instead&nbsp;of dividing distribute themselves equally between the two&nbsp;daughter ceUs, with the result that each of the latter contains&nbsp;only half the number pecuUar to the species. In its simplest&nbsp;form, what occurs in the last stage of spermatogenesis is that one&nbsp;cell breaks up into four spermatozoa by two successive divisions,&nbsp;the first of which is normal and the second reducing. The&nbsp;nuclear matter of spermatozoa, therefore, contains half the&nbsp;number of chromosomes normal to the tissue ceUs of the species,&nbsp;and we shall see later that a similar reduction takes place in the&nbsp;formation of the egg. Further complicâtions, however, exist,&nbsp;at least in certain forms. In 1891 H. Henking showed that in a&nbsp;Hemipteran insect of the genus </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pyrrochoris,</span><span class="font1"> two kinds of&nbsp;spermatozoa are produced in equal numbers, and F. </span><span class="font0">C. </span><span class="font1">Paulmier</span></p>
