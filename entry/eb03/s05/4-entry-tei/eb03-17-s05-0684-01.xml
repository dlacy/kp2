 in natural hiſtory, a genus of talcs, compoſed of large plates viſibly separate, and of extreme thinneſs ; and each fiſſile again ſeparated into a number of plates ſtill finer. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Talc.)</hi> Of this genus there are three ſpecies : 1. The white ſhining ſpecularis, with large and broad leaves, commonly called <hi rend="italic">iſinglaſs and Muſcovy glaſs</hi>; its lamellae, or leaves, are extremely thin, elaſtic, and tranſparent ; it makes not the leaſt efferveſcence with aquafortis, and is not eaſily calcined in the fire. It is imported in great quantities; the miniature-painters cover their pictures with it ; the lantern-makers ſometimes uſe it instead of horn ; and minute objects are uſually preſerved between two plates of it, for examination by the microſcope. 2. The bright brown ſpecularis, with broad leaves ; a very valuable ſpecies, though inferior to the former. 3. The purple bright ſpecularis, with broad leaves, which is the moſt elegant of all the talcs, and not leſs beautifully tranſparent than the firſt kind.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
