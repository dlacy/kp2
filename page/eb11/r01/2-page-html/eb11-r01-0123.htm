<p><span class="font2">presidential candidate of his party. In March 1807 he lost the chairmanship of the Ways and Means Committee. Possessing considerable wit, great readiness, and a showy if somewhat bombastic eloquence, he would undoubtedly have risen&nbsp;to high influence but for his strong vein of eccentricity and his&nbsp;bitter and ungovernable temper. The championship of state’s&nbsp;rights was carried by him to an extreme utterly quixotic, inasmuch as he not only asserted the constitutional right of Virginia&nbsp;to interpose her protest against the usurpation of power at&nbsp;Washington, but claimed that the protest should be supported&nbsp;by force. From December 1825 to March 1827 he served in&nbsp;the United States Senate, and in April 1826 he was forced to&nbsp;fight a duel with Henry Clay, on account of his violent abuse&nbsp;of that statesman in the course of a debate. In 1830 he was&nbsp;sent by President Jackson on a special mission to Russia, but&nbsp;remained in St Petersburg only ten days, then spent almost&nbsp;a year in England, and on his return in October 1831 drew&nbsp;$21,407 from the United States Treasury for his services. He&nbsp;died of consumption at Philadelphia on the 24th of June 1833.&nbsp;Though his political life was full of inconsistencies—he was even&nbsp;capable of advocating the passage of a bill on one day and of&nbsp;opposing the passage of the same bill on the next—he generally&nbsp;adhered to the principles enunciated by the Republican party&nbsp;in its earliest years, and throughout his later career, in numerous&nbsp;speeches, he laboured to bring about the identification of slavery&nbsp;with the theory of states’ rights. In this he was the natural&nbsp;precursor of Calhoun. His last will was disputed in the law&nbsp;courts, and the jury returned a verdict that in the later years&nbsp;of his life he was not of sane mind. He was always in theory&nbsp;opposed to slavery, and by the will which was accepted by the&nbsp;courts, freed his own slaves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The best biography is that by Henry Adams, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">John Randolph </span><span class="font1">(Boston, 1882), in the “ American Statesmen Series.” There is also&nbsp;a biography, which, however, contains many inaccuracies, by Hugh&nbsp;A.

<p><span class="font2">RANDOLPH, PEYTON (1721-1775), American politician, was bom at Tazewell Hall, Williamsburg, Virginia, in 1721, a&nbsp;son of Sir John Randolph (1693-1737), the king’s attorney for&nbsp;Virginia. He graduated at the College of William and Mary,&nbsp;studied law at the Inner Temple, London, and in 1748 was&nbsp;appointed the king’s attorney for Virginia.@@<sup>1</sup> Randolph wrote&nbsp;the address of remonstrance to the king in behalf of the Burgesses against the suggested stamp duties in 1764. His policy&nbsp;was conservative and moderate, and in May 1765 he opposed&nbsp;Patrick Henry’s radical “ Stamp Act Resolutions.” In 1766&nbsp;he resigned as king’s attorney and was succeeded by his brother&nbsp;John (1727-1784). In 1769 he acted as moderator of the&nbsp;privately convened assembly which entered into the nonimportation&nbsp; agreement, and in May 1773 he became chairman&nbsp;of the first Virginia intercolonial committee of correspondence.&nbsp;He presided over the provincial convention of August 1774,&nbsp;and was a member of the First Continental Congress, of which&nbsp;he was president from the 5th of September to the 22nd of&nbsp;October 1774. He was re-elected to Congress in March 1775,&nbsp;and on the 10th of May was again chosen to preside, but on&nbsp;the 24th he left to attend a meeting at Williamsburg of the&nbsp;Virginia Burgesses. He then returned to Congress, of which&nbsp;John Hancock had meanwhile been made president. Randolph&nbsp;died of apoplexy in Philadelphia on the 22nd of October 1775.&nbsp;He was provincial grand-master of the Masons of Virginia,&nbsp;and was an intimate friend of Washington.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RANDOLPH, THOMAS (1523-1590), English diplomatist, son of Avery Randolph, a Kentish gentleman, was educated at&nbsp;Christ Church, Oxford, and in 1549 became principal of Pembroke College, Oxford, then known as Broadgates Hall. During</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2">the reign of Mary, Randolph, who was a -zealous Protestant, sought refuge in Paris, where he cultivated the society of&nbsp;scholars. Returning to England after the accession of Elizabeth, he was soon employed as a confidential diplomatic agent&nbsp;of the English queen in Scotland. Here he succeeded in gaining&nbsp;the confidence of the Protestant party, with whom he became&nbsp;a person of great influence. Randolph’s despatches from&nbsp;Scotland between 1560 and 1585 supply important materials&nbsp;for the history of the political intrigues of that period.&nbsp;Randolph, who had hitherto remained ostensibly on terms of&nbsp;friendship with Mary Queen of Scots, exerted his influence on&nbsp;instructions from Elizabeth to prevent Mary’s marriage with&nbsp;Darnley; but in 1566 he was driven from Scotland on the&nbsp;charge of having fomented Murray’s rebellion, and he then&nbsp;obtained government employment of secondary importance in&nbsp;England. In 1568 he undertook a mission to Russia which&nbsp;resulted in the concession by Ivan the Terrible of certain&nbsp;privileges to English merchants; and in 1570 he returned to&nbsp;Scotland, where, after the murder of the regent Murray in&nbsp;January of that year, he “ succeeded,” says Andrew Lang,&nbsp;“ in making civil war inevitable; he himself was in high spirits,&nbsp;as always when mischief was in hand.” After carrying through&nbsp;certain diplomatic business in France in 1573 and 1576, Randolph returned in January 1581 to Scotland, where the earl of&nbsp;Morton, the regent, had been arrested a few days previously.&nbsp;Randolph, acting on Elizabeth’s instructions, intrigued with&nbsp;Angus and the Douglases in favour of a plot to seize the person&nbsp;of the young King James, and to save Morton by laying violent&nbsp;hands on the earl of Lennox. Douglas of Whittingham, who&nbsp;was employed in the intrigue, on being arrested made revelations which imperilled Randolph, and the latter prudently&nbsp;withdrew to Berwick before the execution of Morton in June&nbsp;1581. In 1585, when he next visited Scotland, he was more&nbsp;successful, being instrumental in arranging a treaty between&nbsp;England and Scotland. For the next four years he was chancellor of the exchequer in England, and he died in London in&nbsp;June 1590. Randolph married, in 1571, Anne, daughter of&nbsp;Thomas Walsingham. He was a personal friend of George&nbsp;Buchanan, in whose </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">History of Scotland </span><span class="font2">he took a lively interest,&nbsp;and he has been credited, though on doubtful evidence, with&nbsp;the authorship of a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font2"> of the historian in Latin.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">RANDOLPH, THOMAS (1605-1635), English poet and dramatist, was born near Daventry in Northamptonshire, and&nbsp;was baptized on the 15th of June 1605. He was educated at&nbsp;Westminster and at Trinity College, Cambridge. He took&nbsp;his B.A. degree in 1628, proceeded M.A. in 1632 and became&nbsp;a major fellow of his college in the same year. He soon gave&nbsp;promise as a writer of comedy. Ben Jonson, not an easily&nbsp;satisfied critic, adopted him as one of his “ sons.” He&nbsp;addressed three poems to Jonson, one on the occasion of his&nbsp;formal “ adoption,” another on the failure of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The New Inn,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">and the third an eclogue, describing his own studies at&nbsp;Cambridge. He lived with his father at Little Houghton in&nbsp;Northamptonshire for some time, and afterwards with William&nbsp;Stafford of Blatherwick, at whose house he died before completing his thirtieth year. He was buried in Blatherwick&nbsp;church on the 17th of March 1634-35, and his epitaph was&nbsp;written by Peter Hausted, the author of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Rival Friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Randolph’s reputation as a wit is attested by the verses addressed to him by his contemporaries and by the stories&nbsp;attached to his name. His earliest printed work is </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Aristippus,&nbsp;Or, The Joυiall Philosopher. Presented in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">private shew,&nbsp;To which is added, The Conceited Pedlar</span><span class="font2"> (1630). It is a gay&nbsp;interlude burlesquing a lecture in philosophy, the whole piece&nbsp;being an argument to support the claims of sack against small&nbsp;beer. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Conceited Pedlar</span><span class="font2"> is an amusing monologue delivered&nbsp;by the pedlar, who defines himself as an “ individuum vagum,</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@1</sup> ln 1754 the Burgesses sent him to London to argue against the governor’s demand for a fee of one pistole on every land patent ;&nbsp;his plea was successful, but the governor superseded him with George&nbsp;Wythe, who resigned in Randolph’s favour upon his return from&nbsp;England. The Burgesses voted Randolph £2500 with the grant of&nbsp;£20,000 to Governor Dinwiddie for Indian warfare; the governor&nbsp;would not approve this appropriation, however, until Randolph&nbsp;apologized for leaving his office without the governor’s permission.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
