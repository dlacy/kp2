<p><label>RONDA</label>
a city of Spain, in the kingdom of Granada, and province of Andalusia. Ronda is about four thousand five hÎ¹mdred feet above the level of the sea, but being surrounded with mountains of vast elevation, it is, in fact, with regard to them, a largely extended valley. The mountains that surround it are more or less covered with snow throughout the whole year; and it is conveyed to the cities of Seville, Cadiz, Gibraltar, and other places, for the daily consumption of their luxurious inhabitants. The plain on which the city stands is one of the most verdant and fertile spots in this the best part of Spain. This city, long a Roman station, under the name of Arunda, abounds with inscriptions, monuments, and ruins of that people, which has been diligently explored by sundry antiquarians. The inhabitants amount to about twenty thousand. Longevity is</p><p>so very general, that it is a proverb in Andalusia, that in Ronda a man at eighty is still a boy. The public buildings are numerous, but not striking, though some of the churches and convents have the ornaments and riches so commonly belonging to spiritual edifices in this country.</p>
