<p><span class="font2">on each side from the base of the culmen to the eye, is in the adult bird in breeding-apparel (with rare exceptions) a further&nbsp;characteristic. Otherwise the appearance of all these birds may&nbsp;be briefly described in the same words—head, breast and upper&nbsp;parts generally of a deep glossy black, and the lower parts and tip&nbsp;of the secondaries of a pure white, while the various changes of&nbsp;plumage dependent on age or season are alike in all. In habits&nbsp;the razorbill closely agrees with the true guillemots, laying its&nbsp;single egg (which is not, however, subject to the same variety of&nbsp;coloration as in the guillemot) on the ledges of cliffs, but it is said&nbsp;as a rule to occupy higher elevations, and when not breeding to&nbsp;keep farther out to sea. On the east side of the Atlantic the&nbsp;Razorbill has its breeding stations from the North Cape to&nbsp;Brittany, besides several in the Baltic, while in winter it passes&nbsp;much farther to the southward, and is sometimes numerous in&nbsp;the Bay of Gibraltar, occasionally entering the Mediterranean,&nbsp;but apparently never extending east of Sicily or Malta. On the&nbsp;west side of the Atlantic it breeds from 70<sup>o</sup> N. lat. on the eastern&nbsp;shore of Baffin’s Bay to Cape Farewell, and again on the coast&nbsp;of America from Labrador and Newfoundland to the Bay of&nbsp;Fundy, while in winter it reaches Long Island.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A.

English&nbsp;writers in the early years of the 19th century used the form&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ghrazzie,</span><span class="font2"> and Dixon Denham in his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Travels</span><span class="font2"> (1826) styles the&nbsp;raiding force itself the ghrazzie. The modern English form is&nbsp;copied from the French, while the Portuguese variant is </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">gazia,&nbsp;gaziva.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">RÉ, ÎLE DE, an island of western France, belonging to the department of Charente-Inférieure, from the nearest mainland&nbsp;point of which it is distant about 2 m. The island has an area&nbsp;of nearly 33 sq. m., with a breadth varying from 1 to 4½ m. and&nbsp;a length of 15 m. It is separated from the coast of Vendee on&nbsp;the N. by the Pertuis Breton, some 6 m. broad, and from the&nbsp;island of Oléron on the S. by the Pertuis D’Antioche, 7½ m.&nbsp;broad. The coast facing the Atlantic is rocky and inhospitable,&nbsp;but there are numerous harbours on the landward side, of which&nbsp;the busiest is La Flotte. Towards the north-west extremity of&nbsp;the island there is a deep indentation, the Fier d’Ars, which leaves&nbsp;an isthmus only 230 ft. wide, strengthened by a breakwater.&nbsp;The north coast is fringed by dunes and by the salt-marshes&nbsp;which are the chief source of livelihood for the inhabitants.&nbsp;Some of them are employed in fishing, oyster-cultivation and&nbsp;the collection of seaweed for manure; the island has corn-lands&nbsp;and vineyards, the latter covering about half its surface, and&nbsp;produces good figs and pears. Apart from its orchards it is&nbsp;now woodless, though once covered by forests. There are two&nbsp;cantons, St Martin (pop. in 1906, 8362) and Ars-en-Ré (pop.&nbsp;4711) forming part </span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font2">the arrondissement of La Rochelle. St&nbsp;Martin, the capital, which has a secure harbour and trade in&nbsp;wine, brandy, salt, &amp;c., was fortified by Vauban in 1681 and used&nbsp;to be the dépôt for convicts on their way to New Caledonia. In&nbsp;1627 it repulsed an English force after a siege of three months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">READE, CHARLES (1814-1884), English novelist and dramatist, the son of an Oxfordshire squire, was born at Ipsden,&nbsp;Oxfordshire, on the 8th of June 1814. He entered Magdalen&nbsp;College, Oxford, proceeded B.A. in 1835, and became a fellow&nbsp;of his college. He was subsequently dean of arts, and vice-president of Magdalen College, taking his degree of D.C.L. in&nbsp;1847. His name was entered at Lincoln’s Inn in 1836; he was&nbsp;elected Vinerian Fellow in 1842, and was called to the bar in&nbsp;1843. He kept his fellowship at Magdalen all his life, but after&nbsp;taking his degree he spent the greater part of his time in London.&nbsp;He began his Iiterary career as a dramatist, and it was his own&nbsp;wish that the word “ dramatist ” should stand first in the&nbsp;description of his occupations on his tombstone. He was&nbsp;dramatist first and novelist afterwards, not merely chronologically but in his aims as an author, always having an eye to&nbsp;stage-effect in scene and situation as well as in dialogue. His&nbsp;first comedy, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Ladies’ Battle,</span><span class="font2"> appeared at the Olympic&nbsp;Theatre in May 1851. It was followed by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Angelo</span><span class="font2"> (1851), </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">A&nbsp;Village Tale</span><span class="font2"> (1852), </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Lost Husband</span><span class="font2"> (1852), and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Gold</span><span class="font2"> (1853).&nbsp;But Reade’s reputation was made by the two-act comedy,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Masks and Faces,</span><span class="font2"> in which he collaborated with Tom Taylor.&nbsp;It was produced in November 1852, and later was expanded&nbsp;into three acts. By the advice of the actress, Laura Seymour,&nbsp;he turned the play into a prose story which appeared in 1853 as&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Peg Woffington.</span><span class="font2"> He followed this up in the same year with&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Christie Johnstone,</span><span class="font2"> a close study of Scottish fisher folk, an&nbsp;extraordinary </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tour de force</span><span class="font2"> for the son of an English squire,&nbsp;whether we consider the dialect or the skill with which he enters&nbsp;into alien habits of thought. In 1854 he produced, in conjunction with Tom Taylor, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Two Loves and a Life,</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The&nbsp;King’s Rival·,</span><span class="font2"> and, unaided, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Courier of Lyons</span><span class="font2">—well known&nbsp;under its later title, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Lyons Mail—</span><span class="font2">and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Peregrine Pickle.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">In the next year appeared </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Art,</span><span class="font2"> afterwards known as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Nance&nbsp;Oldfield.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">He made his name as a novelist in 1856, when he produced </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">It’s Never Too Late to Mend,</span><span class="font2"> a novel written with the purpose of&nbsp;reforming abuses in prison discipline and the treatment of&nbsp;criminals. He described prison life with a fidelity which&nbsp;becomes at times tedious and revolting; but the power of the&nbsp;descriptions was undeniable, and the interest was profound.&nbsp;The truth of some of his details was challenged, and the novelist&nbsp;defended himself with vigour against attempts to rebut his&nbsp;contentions. Five minor novels followed in quick succession,—&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Course of True Love never did run Smooth</span><span class="font2"> (1857), </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Jack of&nbsp;all Trades</span><span class="font2"> (1858), </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Aulobiography of a Thief</span><span class="font2"> (1858), </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Love Me&nbsp;Little, Love Me Long</span><span class="font2"> (1859), and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">White Lies</span><span class="font2"> (1860), dramatized&nbsp;as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Double Marriage.</span><span class="font2"> Then appeared, in 1861, his masterpiece, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Cloister and the Hearth,</span><span class="font2"> relating the adventures of&nbsp;the father of Erasmus. He had dealt with the subject two years&nbsp;before in a short story in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Once a Week,</span><span class="font2"> but, seeing its capabilities,&nbsp;expanded it; and the work is now recognized as one of the&nbsp;finest historical novels in existence. Returning from the 15th&nbsp;century to modern English life, he next produced another&nbsp;startling novel with a purpose, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hard Cash</span><span class="font2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in which he</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">strove to direct attention to the abuses of private lunatic asylums. Three more such novels, in two of which at least the&nbsp;moral purpose, though fully kept in view, was not allowed to&nbsp;obstruct the flow of incident, were afterwards undertaken,—&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Paul Play</span><span class="font2"> (1869), in which he exposed the iniquities of ship-knackers, and paved the way for the labours of Samuel Plimsoll;&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Put Yourself in his Place</span><span class="font2"> (1870), in which he grappled with&nbsp;the tyrannous outrages of trades-unions; and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">A Woman-Hater&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">(1877), in which he exposed the degrading conditions of village&nbsp;life. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Wandering Heir</span><span class="font2"> (1875), of which he also wrote a&nbsp;version for the stage, was suggested by the Tichborne trial.&nbsp;Outside the line of these moral and occasional works Reade&nbsp;produced three elaborate studies of character,—</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Griffith Gaunt&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">(1866), </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">A Terrible Temptation</span><span class="font2"> (1871), </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">A Simpleton</span><span class="font2"> (1873). The&nbsp;first of these was in his own opinion the best of his novels, and&nbsp;his own opinion was probably right. He was wrong, however,&nbsp;in his own conception of his powers as a dramatist. At intervals&nbsp;throughout his Ûterary career he sought to gratify his dramatic&nbsp;ambition, hiring a theatre and engaging a company for the&nbsp;representation of his own plays. An example of his persistency&nbsp;was seen in the case of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Foul Play.</span><span class="font2"> He wrote this in 1869 in&nbsp;combination with Mr Dion Boucicault with a view to stage&nbsp;adaptation. The play was more or less a failure; but he&nbsp;produced another version alone in 1877, under the title of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">A&nbsp;Scuttled Ship,</span><span class="font2"> and the failure was pronounced. His greatest&nbsp;success as a dramatist attended his last attempt—</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Drink</span><span class="font2">—an&nbsp;adaptation of Zola’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">L’Assommoir,</span><span class="font2"> produced in 1879. In that&nbsp;year his friend Laura Seymour, who had kept house for him&nbsp;since 1854, died. Reade’s health failed from that time, and he&nbsp;died on the 11th of April 1884, leaving behind him a completed&nbsp;novel, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">A Perilous Secret,</span><span class="font2"> which showed no falling off in the arts&nbsp;of weaving a complicated plot and devising thrilling situations.</span></p>
