To the above-mentioned means oſ aI-luring by trailing, way-baiting, and calling, is added another of a very material efficacy, which is, the uſe of oil of rhodium, which, like the marum Syriacum in thc caſe of cats, has a very extraordinary faſcinating power on theſe animals. This oil is extremely dear, and therefore ſparingly uſed. It is exalted in a ſmall quantity in the place, and at the entrance of it, where the rats are intended to be taken ; particularly at the time when tlicy are to be laſt brought together, in order to their deſtruction ; and it is uſed alfi&gt; by fτnearing it on the ſurface of ſome of the implements uſed in taking by the method below deſcribed ; and the effect it has in taking off their caution and dread, by the delight they appear to have in it, is very extraordinary.</p><p>It is uſual, likewife, for tlie operator to diſguiſe his figure as well as ſcent, which is done by putting on a fort of gown or cloak, of one colour, that hides the natural form, and makes him appear like a poſt or fome ſuch inanimate thing ; which habit muſt likewiſe be ſcented as above, to overpower the ſmell of his perſon and beſides this, he is to avoid all motion till he has ſe-cured his point of having all the rats in his power.</p><p>when the rats are thus enticed and collected, where time is afforded, and the whole in any houſe and outbuildings are intended to be cleared away, they are ſuffered to regale on what they moſt like, which is ready prepared for them, and then to go away quietly for two or three nights ; by which means thoſe that are not allured the firſt night are brought afterwards, either by their fellows, or the effects of the trailing, &amp;c. and will not fail to come duly again, if they are not diſturbed or moleſted. But many of the rat-catchers make ſhort -er work, and content themſelves with what can be brought together in one night or two ; but this is never effectual, unleſs· where the building is ſmall and en-tire, and the rats but few in number..</p><p>The means of taking them, when they are brought together, are various. Some entice them into a very large bag, the mouth of which- is ſufficiently capacious to cover nearly the whole floor of the place where they are collected ; which is done by fmearing fome veffel, placed in the middle of the bag, with oil of rhodium, and laying in the bag baits of food. This bag, which before lay ſtat on the ground with the mouth ſpread open, is to be fuddenly cloſed when, the rats are all in.. Others drive or fright them, by ſtight noiſes or motions, into a bag of a long form, the mouth of which, after all the rats, are come in, is drawn up to the opening of the place by whieh they entered, all other ways of retreat being ſeeured. others, again, intoxicate or poiſon them, by mixing with the repaſt prepared for them the cocu-Ius Indicus, or the nux vomica. They direct four oun-ces of the coculus Indieus, with twelve ounces of oatmeal, and two ounces of treacle or honey, made into a moiſt paſte with ſtrong-beer : but if the nux vomica be uſed, a much leſs proportion will ſerve than, is here given of the coculus. Any ſimilar compoſition of theſe drugs, with that kind of food the rats are moſt fond of, and which has a ſtrong flavour, to hide that of tlie drugs, will equally well anſwer the end. If indeed the coculus Indicus be well p⅛wdered, and infuſed in ſtrong-beer for ſome time, at leaſt half the quantity here directed will ſerve as well as the quantity before-men-tioned. when the rats appear to be thoroughly in</p><lb/><p>toxicated with the coculus, or ſick with the nux vomica, they may be taken with the hand, and put into a bag or cage, the door of the place being firſt drawn to, leſt thoſe who have ſtrength and ſenſe remaining eſcape.</p><p><hi rend="italic">RAT-Iſland,</hi>  a ſmall detached part of the iſland of Lundy, off the north coaſt of Devon. ’ Though noted in Donn’s map of the county, it is not worth mention here, but as giving opportunity to ſubjoin a farther notice of Lundy, which iſland was purchaſed a few years ſince by Mr Cleveland Μ.
