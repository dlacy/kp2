<p><span class="font0">churches, trees, flowers and herbs were drawn with wonderful precision, minuteness of detail and delicacy of hand, solely&nbsp;to recall some specific aspect of nature or art, of which he&nbsp;wished to retain a record. In his gift for recording the most&nbsp;subtle characters of architectural carvings and details, Ruskin&nbsp;has hardly been surpassed by the most distinguished painters..</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1853 </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Stones of Venice</span><span class="font0"> was completed at Herne Hill, and he began a series of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Letters</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Notes</span><span class="font0"> on pictures and&nbsp;architecture. In this year </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(aet.</span><span class="font0"> 34) he opened the long series of&nbsp;public lectures wherein he came forward as an oral teacher and&nbsp;preacher, not a little to the alarm of his parents and amidst&nbsp;a storm of controversy. The Edinburgh Lectures (November&nbsp;1853) treated Architecture, Turner, and Pre-Raphaelitism.&nbsp;The Manchester Lectures (July 1857) treated the moral and&nbsp;social uses of art, now embodied in /I </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Joy for Ever.</span><span class="font0"> Some other&nbsp;lectures are reprinted in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">On the Old Road</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Two Paths&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(1859). These lectures did not prevent the issue of various&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Notes</span><span class="font0"> on the Royal Academy pictures and the Turner collections;&nbsp;works on the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Harbours of England</span><span class="font0"> (1856); on the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Elements of&nbsp;Drawing</span><span class="font0"> (1857); the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Elements of Perspective</span><span class="font0"> (1859); and at last,&nbsp;after prolonged labour, the fifth and final volume of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Modern&nbsp;Painters</span><span class="font0"> was published in i860 </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(aet.</span><span class="font0"> 41). This marks an epoch&nbsp;in the career of John Ruskin; and the year i860 closed the&nbsp;series of his works on art strictly so called; indeed, this was&nbsp;the last of his regular works in substantial form. The last forty&nbsp;years of his life were devoted to expounding his views, or rather&nbsp;his doctrines, on social and industrial problems, on education,&nbsp;morals and religion, wherein art becomes an incidental and&nbsp;instrumental means to a higher and more spiritual life. And&nbsp;his teaching was embodied in an enormous series of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lectures,&nbsp;Letters, Articles, Selections</span><span class="font0"> and serial pamphlets. These are&nbsp;now collected in upwards of thirty volumes in the final edition.&nbsp;The entire set of Ruskin’s publications amounts to more than&nbsp;fifty works having distinctive titles. For some years before&nbsp;i860 Ruskin had been deeply stirred by reflecting on the condition of all industrial work and the evils of modern society.&nbsp;His lectures on art had dealt bitterly with the mode in which&nbsp;buildings and other works were produced. In 1854 he joined&nbsp;Mr F^ D. Maurice, Mr T. Hughes, and several of the new school&nbsp;of painters, in teaching classes at the Working Men’s College.&nbsp;But it was not until i860 that he definitely began to propound&nbsp;a new social scheme, denouncing the dogmas of political&nbsp;economy. Four lectures on this topic appeared in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Cornhill&nbsp;Magazine</span><span class="font0"> until the public disapproval led the editor, then W. M.&nbsp;Thackeray, to close the series. They were published in 1862&nbsp;as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Unto this Last.</span><span class="font0"> In the same year he wrote four papers in&nbsp;the same sense in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Fraser's Magazine,</span><span class="font0"> then edited by J. A.&nbsp;Froude; but he in turn was compelled to suspend the issue.&nbsp;They were completed and ultimately issued under the title&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Munera Pulveris.</span><span class="font0"> These two small books contain the earliest&nbsp;and most systematic of all Ruskin’s efforts to depict a new social&nbsp;Utopia: they contain a vehement repudiation of the orthodox&nbsp;formulas of the economists; and they are for the most part&nbsp;written in a trenchant but simple style, in striking contrast to&nbsp;the florid and discursive form of his works on art.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1864 Ruskin’s father died, at the age of 79, leaving his son a large fortune and a fine property at Denmark Hill. John&nbsp;still lived there with his mother, aged 83, infirm, and failing&nbsp;in sight, to whom came as a companion their cousin, Joanna&nbsp;Ruskin Agnew, afterwards Mrs Arthur Severn. At the end&nbsp;of the year 1864 Ruskin delivered at Manchester a new series&nbsp;of lectures—not on art, but on reading, education, woman’s&nbsp;work and social morals—the expansion of his earlier treatises&nbsp;on economic sophisms. This afterwards was included with a&nbsp;Dublin lecture of 1868 under the fantastic title of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sesame and&nbsp;Lilies</span><span class="font0"> (perhaps the most popular of his social essays), of which&nbsp;44,000 copies were issued down to 1900. He made this, in&nbsp;1871, the first volume of his collected lectures and essays, the&nbsp;more popular and didactic form of his new Utopia of human&nbsp;life. It contains, with </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Fors,</span><span class="font0"> the most complete sketch of&nbsp;his conception of the place of woman in modem society. In&nbsp;the very characteristic preface to the new edition of 1871 he&nbsp;proposes never to reprint his earlier works on art; disclaims&nbsp;many of the views they contained, and much in their literary&nbsp;form; and specially regrets the narrow Protestantism by&nbsp;which they were pervaded. In the year 1866 he published&nbsp;a little book about girls, and written for girls, a mixture of&nbsp;morals, theology, economics and geology, under the title of&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ethics of the Dust',</span><span class="font0"> and this was followed by a more important&nbsp;and popular work, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Crown of Wild Olive.</span><span class="font0"> This in its ultimate&nbsp;form contained lectures on “ Work,” “ Traffic,” “ War,” and&nbsp;the “ Future of ^England.” It was one of his most trenchant&nbsp;utterances, full of fancy, wit, eloquence and elevated thought.&nbsp;But a more serious volume was </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Time and Tide</span><span class="font0"> (1867), a series&nbsp;of twenty-five letters to a workman of Sunderland, upon various&nbsp;points in the Ruskinian Utopia. This little collection of&nbsp;“ Thoughts,” written with wonderful vivacity, ingenuity and&nbsp;fervour, is the best summary of the author’s social and economic&nbsp;programme, and contains some of his wisest and finest thoughts&nbsp;in the purest and most masculine English that he had at his&nbsp;command. In 1869 he issued the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Queen of the Air,</span><span class="font0"> lectures&nbsp;on Greek myths, a subject he now took up, with some aid from&nbsp;the late Sir C. Newton. It was followed by some other occasional pieces; and in the same year he was elected Slade professor of art in the university of Oxford. He now entered&nbsp;on his professorial career, which continued with some intervals&nbsp;down to 1884, and occupied a large part of his energies. His&nbsp;lectures began in February 1870, and were so crowded that they&nbsp;had to be given in the Sheldonian Theatre, and frequently were&nbsp;repeated to a second audience. He was made honorary fellow&nbsp;of Corpus Christi, and occupied rooms in the college. In&nbsp;1871 his mother died, at the age of 90, and his cousin, Miss&nbsp;Agnew, married Mr Arthur Severn. In that year he bought&nbsp;from Mr Linton, Brant wood, an old cottage and property on&nbsp;Coniston Lake, a lovely spot facing the mountain named the&nbsp;Old Man. He added greatly to the house and property, and&nbsp;lived in it continuously until his death in 1900. In 1871, one&nbsp;of the most eventful years of his life, be began </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Fors Clavigera,</span><span class="font0"> a&nbsp;small serial addressed to the working men of England, and published only by Mr George Allen, engraver, at Keston, in Kent,,&nbsp;at 7d., and afterwards at iod., but without discount, and&nbsp;not through the trade. This was a medley of social, moral&nbsp;and religious reflections interspersed with casual thoughts&nbsp;about persons, events and art. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Fors</span><span class="font0"> means alternatively&nbsp;Fate, Force or Chance, bearing the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Clavis,</span><span class="font0"> Club, Key or&nbsp;Nail, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font0"> power, patience and law. It was a desultory exposition of the Ruskinian ideal of life, manners and society,&nbsp;full of wit, play, invective and sermons on things in general.&nbsp;It was continued with intervals down to 1884, and contained&nbsp;ninety-six letters or pamphlets, partly illustrated, w’hich origin&nbsp;ally filled eight volumes and are now reduced to four.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The early years of his Oxford professorship were occupied by severe labour, sundry travels, attacks of illness and another&nbsp;cruel disappointment in love. In spite of this, he lectured,&nbsp;founded a museum of art, to which he gave pictures and drawings and £5000; he sought to form at Oxford a school of drawing;&nbsp;he started a model shop for the sale of tea, and model lodgings&nbsp;in Marylebone for poor tenants. At Oxford he set his pupils&nbsp;to work on making roads to improve the country. He now*&nbsp;founded ‘‘St George’s Guild,” himself contributing £7000,&nbsp;the object of which was to form a model industrial and social&nbsp;movement, to buy lands, mills and factories, and to start&nbsp;a model industry on co-operative or Socialist lines. In connexion with this was a museum for the study of art and&nbsp;science at Sheffield. Ruskin himself endowed the museum with&nbsp;works of art and money; a full account of it has been given&nbsp;in Mr E. T. Cook’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in Ruskin</span><span class="font0"> (1890), which contains&nbsp;the particulars of his university lectures and of his economic&nbsp;and social experiment^. It is unnecessary to follow out the&nbsp;history of these somewhat unpromising attempts. None of&nbsp;them came to much good, except the Sheffield museum, which&nbsp;is an established success, and is now transferred to the town.&nbsp;In </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Fors,</span><span class="font0"> which was continued month by month for seven years,&nbsp;Ruskin poured out his thoughts, proposals and rebukes on</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
