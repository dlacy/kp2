(Marie de Rabutin, Marquisse de), a French lady, was born in 1626. When only a year old ſhe lost her father, who was killed in the deſcent of the Engliſh on the iſle of Rhe, where he commanded a company of volunteers. In 1644 ſhe married the Marquis of Sevigne, who was ſlain in a duel by the Chevalier d’Albret, in 1651. She had by him a son and a daughter, to the education of whom ſhe afterwards religiouſly devoted herſelf. Her daughter was married in 1669 to the Count of Grignan, who conducted her to Provence. Madame de Sevigné consoled herſelf by writing frequent letters to her daughter. She fell at laſt the victim to her maternal tenderness. In one of her viſits to Grignan, ſhe fatigued herſelf ſo much during the ſickneſs of her daughter, that ſhe was ſeized with a fever, which carried her off on the 14th of January 1696. We have two portraits of Madame de Sevigné ; the one by the Compte de Buſſi, the other by Madame de la Fayette. The firſt exhibits her defects ;the ſecond her excellencies. Buſſi deſcribes her as a lively gay coquette, a lover of flattery, fond of titles, honour, and diſtinction : M. de la Fayette as a woman of wit and good ſenſe, as poſſeſſed of a noble foul, formed for diſpenſing benefits, incapable of debaſing herſelf by avarice, and bleſſed with a generous, obliging, and faithful heart. Both theſe portraits are in ſome meaſure juſt. That ſhe was vain-glorious, appears evident from her own letters, which, on the other hand, exhibit undoubted proofs of her virtue and goodneſs of heart.</p><p>This illuſtrious lady was acquainted with all the wits of her age. It is ſaid that ſhe decided the famous dispute between Perrault and Boileau concerning the preference of the ancients to the moderns, thus, “ The ancients are the fineſt, and we are the prettieſt.” She left behind her a moſt valuable collection of letters, the best edition of which is that of 1775, in 8 vols 1 2mo. “<note anchored="true" n="1" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>[mu] Siede de Louis XIV. tom, ii.</p></note> Theſe letters (says Voltaire) are filled with anecdotes, written with freedom, and in a natural and animated ſtyle ; are an excellent crſticiſm upon ſtudied letters of wit, and ſtill more upon thoſe fictitious letters which aim at the epiſtolary ſtyle, by a recital of falſe ſentiments and feigned adventures to an imaginary correspondent.” It were to be wiſhed that a proper ſelection had been made of theſe letters. It is difficult to read eight volumes of letters, which, though inimitably written, preſent frequent repetitions, and are often filled with trifles. What makes them in general perhaps ſo intereſting is, that they are in part hiſtorical. They may be looked upon as a relation of the manners, the ton, the genius, the faſhions, the etiquette, which reigned in the court of Louis XIV. They contain many curious anecdotes nowhere else to be found : But theſe excellencies would be ſtill more ſtriking, were they ſometimes ſtripped of that multitude of domeſtic affairs and minute incidents which ought naturally to have died with the mother and the daughter. A volume entitled <hi rend="italic">Sevigniana</hi> was publiſhed at Paris in 1756, which is nothing more than a collection of the fine ſentiments, literary and hiſtorical anecdotes, and moral apothegms, ſcattered throughout theſe letters.<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0331.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0325"/>
