<p><span class="font0">jejune, its handling was timid, while its coloration and tonality were dry, not to say thin. Such was Rossetti’s advent in art&nbsp;under the Pre-Raphaelite banner. The picture’s reception&nbsp;was not encouraging, nor did the next work from his hands&nbsp;induce him to emerge from that proud exclusiveness in which&nbsp;all such minds as his are content to abide. The diverse moods&nbsp;of the other Brothers chose otherwise, but of Rossetti’s immediate circle it has been truly said: “ It appears that of&nbsp;seven young men and Brethren five have attained eminent&nbsp;positions, four of them being pre-eminent, although for years&nbsp;after the society was formed no single member, whatever his&nbsp;position might be, escaped insult, obloquy and wicked and&nbsp;malicious misrepresentation. The more conspicuous the&nbsp;Brother [e.g. Millais], the more outrageously was he attacked. ”&nbsp;No estimate of Rossetti’s genius, his triumph and his life as&nbsp;a whole can be justly based without ample allowance being&nbsp;made for the circumstances which attended his advent as a&nbsp;painter. “ Ecce Ancilla Domini I” the smaller picture which&nbsp;is now in the National Gallery of British Art at Millbank, was&nbsp;the one perfect outcome of the original motive of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood by its representative and typical&nbsp;member. It is replete with the mystical mood which then&nbsp;ruled the painter’s mind; that mood chose what may be&nbsp;called virginal white and its harmonies as its aptest coloration,&nbsp;and the intense light of morning sufficed for its tonality. It&nbsp;was exhibited at the Portland Gallery in 1850. After these&nbsp;pictures were finished, the outside world saw no more of Rossetti&nbsp;as a painter until it had prepared itself to see modem art from&nbsp;a higher plane than before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In December 1850 there appeared the first number of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Germ,</span><span class="font0"> a magazine (which lasted for only four numbers) in which&nbsp;Rossetti had a leading place as the poet in verse and prose. The&nbsp;influence of Robert Browning upon Rossetti was more potent&nbsp;in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Germ</span><span class="font0"> than in that splendid romance in water-colours&nbsp;called “ The Laboratory,” where a court lady of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ancien&nbsp;régime</span><span class="font0"> visits an old poison-monger to obtain from him a fatal&nbsp;potion for her rival in love. This wonderful gem of colour,&nbsp;glowing in lurid and wicked passion and voluptuous suggestion,&nbsp;marked the opening of the artist’s second period and signalized&nbsp;his departure from that phase of Pre-Raphaelitism of which&nbsp;“ Ecce Ancilla Domini!” was the crowning achievement, and,&nbsp;so far as he was concerned, the artistic </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ne plus ultra,</span><span class="font0"> Millais&nbsp;and the other Brothers remained faithful during several years&nbsp;yet to come. Later in 1850, Rossetti produced the original,&nbsp;which is in ink, of the famous “ Hesterna Rosa,” a gambling&nbsp;scene of men and their mistresses in a tent by lamplight, while&nbsp;pallid dawn gathers force between the trees without. Then&nbsp;came from his hands “ Borgia,” which, like “ The Laboratory,”&nbsp;is in water-colours, and, like “ Hesterna Rosa,” is a sardonic&nbsp;tragedy. “ How they met Themselves ” came next, and, in&nbsp;illustrating a legend similar to that of the Doppelgänger,&nbsp;affirmed the force, the originality and the tragic passion of&nbsp;Rossetti’s genius. Two lovers are walking in a twilight wood,&nbsp;where they are confronted suddenly by their apparitions, portending death. The year 1852 produced “ Giotto painting&nbsp;Dante’s Portrait,” and saw a new development of the painter’s&nbsp;mind and mood, dashed with a humour not often to be seen in&nbsp;him. In its somewhat dry coloration it differed from the ardent&nbsp;jewel-like glow and deeper gloom of “ Borgia ” and its successor&nbsp;and the sumptuous visions of womanhood in later pictures.&nbsp;“ Found,” Rossetti’s sole contribution of the sort which Mr&nbsp;Holman Hunt affected, was begun somewhere about this period;&nbsp;but this piece of pictorial moralizing (the analogue of the poet’s&nbsp;own “Jenny”), vigorous and intensely pathetic as it is, was&nbsp;never really finished by its author, being, indeed, far remote&nbsp;from Rossetti’s inner self, which was rather ovcr-scomful of&nbsp;didactic art, and thoroughly indisposed towards attempts to&nbsp;ameliorate anybody’s condition by means of pictures. Nor did&nbsp;the stringency of naturalistic painting suit his mood or his&nbsp;experience. Nevertheless, what is his in the existing picture&nbsp;remains a masterpiece of poetry with exquisitely finished parts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Passing a few fine but comparatively unimportant drawings, such as “Lancelot and Guinevere at the Tomb of Arthur,”&nbsp;“ Lancelot looking at the Dead Lady of Shalott,” “ Mariana&nbsp;of the South,” “ Sir Galahad,” “ The Blue Closet,” and various&nbsp;works owing subjects to the Arthurian cycle of romances, we&nbsp;may note that the artist illustrated by five cuts </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Poems by Alfred&nbsp;Tennyson,</span><span class="font0"> on which Millais and Mr Holman Hunt were also&nbsp;engaged, and which was published by Moxon in 1857. As in&nbsp;“ Ecce Ancilla Domini !” we had virginal white and morning&nbsp;light employed to strengthen the mystical significance of the&nbsp;design, so in “ Borgia ” Venetian voluptuousness and sensuous&nbsp;splendours obtained, and in “ The Blue Closet ” is a very potent&nbsp;and suggestive exercise intended to symbolize the association&nbsp;of colour with music. The last is one of the subtlest of the&nbsp;artist’s “inventions,” and it shows how he had developed upon&nbsp;“ Borgia ” an artistic sympathy which is but too likely to be&nbsp;“ caviare to the general.” “ The Wedding of St George ” is&nbsp;not so fine; nor was “ Lancelot’s Dream of the Sangreal,”&nbsp;Rossetti’s part in the luckless decorations of the Oxford Union@@<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>(1857-58); nor are “ Guinevere and Sir Lancelot,” “ Galahad&nbsp;in the Chapel ” and other Arthurian examples quite worthy&nbsp;of his art. “ Bocca Baciata,” the super-sensuous portrait of a&nbsp;woman, a work of wonderful fire, and the pictures on the pulpit&nbsp;at Llandaff Cathedral, marked the expiration of the second&nbsp;epoch in Rossetti’s art and the beginning of a new, the third,&nbsp;last and most powerful of all the phases of his career. The&nbsp;picture “ Dr Johnson at the Mitre,” when the “ pretty fools ”&nbsp;consulted the lexicographer anent Methodism, is a good example&nbsp;of his humour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1861 Rossetti produced several fine designs for stained glass, and in the revival of stained-glass painting as an art he&nbsp;had a larger share than has frequently been ascribed to him.&nbsp;The practice of designing upon a large scale, and employment&nbsp;of masses of splendid though deep-toned colours, had probably&nbsp;something to do with the prodigious development of his powers&nbsp;and the enlargement of his views as regards painting which took&nbsp;effect at this period (1862-63). At this time a striking and&nbsp;highly imaginative triptych, representing three events in the&nbsp;careers of Paolo and Francesca, was produced; it is a great&nbsp;improvement upon an earlier design. There is unprecedented&nbsp;energy in the group of the lovers embracing in the garden-house&nbsp;just as they have paused in reading the fatal romance. The&nbsp;composition of this group, with the circular window behind their&nbsp;figures, is as fine as it was comparatively novel in Rossetti’s,&nbsp;practice. Its lurid coloration was so thoroughly in harmony&nbsp;with the pathos of the subject that in this respect the work&nbsp;excelled all the painter had previously produced. The same&nbsp;elements, energy, a sympathetic and poetic scheme of colour, and&nbsp;composition of a fine order, combined with far greater force and&nbsp;originality in “ The Bride,” or “ The Beloved,” that magnificent&nbsp;illustration of The Song of Solomon. The last named is a&nbsp;life-size group of powerfully coloured and diversely beautiful&nbsp;damsels accompanying their mistress with music and with song&nbsp;on her way to the bridegroom. This picture, as regards its&nbsp;brilliance, finish, the charms of four lovely faces and the&nbsp;splendour of its lighting, occupies a great place in the highest&nbsp;grade of modern art of all the world. It is likewise, so far as the&nbsp;qualities named are concerned, the crowning piece of Rossetti’s&nbsp;art, and stands for him much as the “ Sacred and Profane Love ”&nbsp;of Titian represents that master. Very fine, indeed, but hardly&nbsp;so passionate and virile, is the “ Beata Beatrix,” now in the&nbsp;National Gallery of British Art with “ Ecce Ancilla Domini !”&nbsp;which he produced thirteen years earlier. These works belong&nbsp;to a category of fine and quite original examples, all replete with</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@1</sup> In 1857, Rossetti, when in Oxford with William Morris, conceived the design.of filling the bays above the gallery in the then new Union debating room (now the library) with paintings from&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Morte d'Arthur,</span><span class="font0"> arid he enlisted the co-operation of several of&nbsp;his artistic circle, including. Burne-Jones ana William Morris, in&nbsp;the work, which was begun in August. Morris’s picture was “ Sir&nbsp;Palomides watching Tristram and Iseult,” Burne-Jones’s “ Nimue&nbsp;luring Merlin.” Unfortunately the walls were too new and not&nbsp;properly prepared for painting; the colour soon began to fade and&nbsp;wear off, and in the course of twenty years or so the pictures&nbsp;became almost indistinguishable.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
