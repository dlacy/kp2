<p><span class="font1">first three passages cited above are all by the priestly (post-exile) author and go together. Jacob is settled by his son Joseph in&nbsp;the land of Rameses and from the same Rameses the exodus&nbsp;naturally takes place. The older narrative speaks not of the&nbsp;land of Rameses but of the land of Goshen; it seems probable,&nbsp;therefore, that the later author interprets an obsolete term by&nbsp;one current in his own day, just as the Septuagint in Gen. xlvi. 28&nbsp;names instead of Goshen Heroopolis and the land of Rameses.&nbsp;Heroopolis lay on the canal connecting the Nile and the Red Sea,&nbsp;and not far from the head of the latter, so that the land of&nbsp;Rameses must be sought in Wādi Tūmīlāt near the line of the&nbsp;modern fresh-water canal. In Exod. i. 11, again, the store-cities or arsenals which the Hebrews built for Pharaoh are&nbsp;specified as Pithom and Raamses, to which the Septuagint adds&nbsp;Heliopolis. Pithom also takes us to the Wādi Tūmīlāt. But&nbsp;did the Israelites maintain a continuous recollection of the&nbsp;names of the cities on which they were forced to build, or were&nbsp;these names rather added by a writer who knew what fortified&nbsp;places were in his own time to be seen in Wādi Tūmīlāt? The&nbsp;latter is far the more likely case, when we consider that the old&nbsp;form of the story of the Hebrews in Egypt is throughout deficient in precise geographical data, as might be expected in a&nbsp;history not committed to writing till the Israelites had resided&nbsp;for centuries in another and distant land. The post-exile or&nbsp;priestly author indeed gives a detailed route for the exodus&nbsp;(which is lacking in the older story), but he, we know, was a&nbsp;student of geography and might supplement tradition by what&nbsp;he could gather from traders as to the caravan routes.@@<sup>1</sup> And at&nbsp;all events to argue that, because the Hebrews worked at a city&nbsp;named after Rameses, they did so in the reign of the founder, is&nbsp;false reasoning, for the Hebrew expression might equally be&nbsp;used of repairs or new works of any kind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It appears, however, from remains and inscriptions that Rameses II. did build in Wādi Tūmīlāt, especially at Tell&nbsp;Maskhūta, which Lepsius therefore identified with the Raamses&nbsp;of Exodus. This identification is commemorated in the name&nbsp;of the adjacent railway station. But Naville’s excavations&nbsp;found that the ruins were those of Pithom and that Pithom was&nbsp;identical with the later Heroopolis. Petrie found sculptures of&nbsp;the age of Rameses II. at Tel Rotãb, in the Wādi Tūmīlāt west&nbsp;of Pithom, and concludes that this was Rameses. The Biblical&nbsp;city is probably one of those named Prameses, “ House of&nbsp;Ramesses,” in the Egyptian texts.</span></p><h2><a name="caption1"></a><span class="font0">See Pithom; and W. M. F. Petrie, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hyksos and Israelite Cities, </span><span class="font0">p. 28 et sqq.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(W. R. S., F. Ll. G.)</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">RAMESWARAM, a town of British India, in the Madura district of Madras, on the island of Pambam in Palk Straits. It&nbsp;contains one of the most venerable Hindu shrines, founded,&nbsp;according to tradition, by Rama himself, which for centuries has&nbsp;been the resort of thousands of pilgrims from all parts of India.&nbsp;The great temple, with its pillared corridors 700 ft. long, is&nbsp;perhaps the finest example of Dravidian architecture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RAMIE </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">(Rhea, China-grass),</span><span class="font1"> the product of one or more species of the genus </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Boehmeria,</span><span class="font1"> a member of the order Urticaceae&nbsp;and nearly allied to the stinging nettle genus (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Urtica),</span><span class="font1"> from&nbsp;which, however, it differs in absence of stinging hairs. Some&nbsp;confusion has arisen in the use of the various terms China-grass, Ramie and Rhea. Two plants are concerned. One,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Boehmeria nivea,</span><span class="font1"> China-grass, has been cultivated by the&nbsp;Chinese from very early times under the name </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tschou-ma.</span><span class="font1"> The&nbsp;other, probably a variety of the same species (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Boehmeria nivea, </span><span class="font1">var. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">tenacissima)</span><span class="font1">, though sometimes regarded as a distinct&nbsp;species (B. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">tenacissima),</span><span class="font1"> is the Ramie (Malay </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">zāmī)</span><span class="font1"> of the Malay&nbsp;Islands and the Rhea of Assam.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Boehmeria nivea</span><span class="font1"> is a shrubby plant with the growth of the common nettle but without stinging hairs, sending up each&nbsp;season a number of straight shoots from a perennial underground rootstock. The long-stalked leaves recall those of the&nbsp;nettle in their shape and serrated margin, but their backs are</span></p><h2><span class="font0"><sup>@@@1</sup> From the position of the words it is even not unlikely that &quot; Pithom and Raamses ” may be the addition of a redactor, and that&nbsp;the first author of Exod. i. 11 only spoke generally of store-cities.</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">clothed with a downy substance and have a silvery appearance. The minute greenish flowers are closely arranged along a slender&nbsp;axis. This variety has been cultivated by the Chinese for many&nbsp;years, and the fibre, which is obtained from it by a tedious&nbsp;hand-process, has been used more or less as a substitute for silk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The variety </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">tenacissima</span><span class="font1"> differs in its more robust habit and larger leaves, which are pale green on the face and a very much&nbsp;paler green on the bark. They are not downy, however, and&nbsp;this affords a ready means of distinction from true China-grass.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Boehmeria nivea</span><span class="font1"> is sometimes found wild in India, Malaya,&nbsp;China and Japan, and is probably a native of further India and&nbsp;Malaya. China-grass and ramie are widely cultivated not only&nbsp;in China, Formosa, Japan, India and Malaya, but also in&nbsp;Queensland, Mauritius, the Cameroons, the West Indies, Brazil,&nbsp;Mexico and the southern states of North America, and also&nbsp;in south Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The plant, which attains a height of from 3 to 8 ft., is grown from seed, cuttings or layers, or by division of the&nbsp;roots. It is easy to cultivate, and thrives in almost any soil,&nbsp;but especially in a naturally rich, moist, light, loamy soil.&nbsp;For the best growth a good and equally distributed rainfall is&nbsp;necessary. Sudden changes of weather result in irregularities&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">in </span><span class="font1">growth, and these have a tendency to produce plants the&nbsp;fibres of which vary in strength. Liberal manuring is necessary,&nbsp;as the plant withdraws a large quantity of valuable constituents&nbsp;from the soil. The plants should be cut when the flower is&nbsp;beginning to fall and the seed to form.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is stated that two to four crops per season may be obtained on suitable ground, each crop yielding about 4 tons of stems&nbsp;per acre. With only two crops per year, and a 4% yield of fibre,&nbsp;the resulting product would nearly reach one-third of a ton per&nbsp;acre. When proper attention is given to the choice of ground,&nbsp;and to planting, there is not much difficulty in the way of&nbsp;raising a good crop; the trouble arises in the extraction of the&nbsp;fibre.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The stems when ripe are cut down, and after the leaves and small branches have been removed, the outer cover and the&nbsp;layers of fibre are stripped off in the form of ribbons. These&nbsp;ribbons contain the bark, the fibre and a quantity of very&nbsp;adhesive gum. The Chinese remove this bark and as much of&nbsp;the gum as possible before the plant has dried. This hand-process is naturally a slow and tedious one, and many decorticators have been invented to supplant it. The action of all&nbsp;these decorticators is very similar. The ramie stalks are fed&nbsp;into the machine, and during their passage are beaten by 12 to&nbsp;20 rapidly revolving blades. These break the stalks into small&nbsp;pieces, and leave the bark and fibre in long ribbons. At the&nbsp;same time, part of the gum is squeezed out between the beaters&nbsp;and the anvil. Up to the present, however, these machines have&nbsp;not been very successful. They usually bruise or otherwise&nbsp;injure the fibre, and they do not squeeze out the gum thoroughly.&nbsp;If the gum be allowed to dry on the ribbons it is difficult to&nbsp;remove it, and the chemicals employed in the degumming, if not&nbsp;thoroughly removed by washing, often injure the fibre to such&nbsp;an extent that the ultimate fabric or article is soon decomposed.&nbsp;If, however, the ribbons be degummed immediately, or soon&nbsp;after the plants are cut down, the gum will be much more easily&nbsp;extracted—indeed it might be possible to remove it then by&nbsp;boiling water or steam. The fibre cannot be expected to&nbsp;make much headway until the operations of decorticating and&nbsp;degumming are successfully carried out on or near the growing&nbsp;grounds; and, until a proficient decorticator is made, the fibre&nbsp;should be stripped by hand and the degumming operation begun&nbsp;immediately. By this method the least possible damage would&nbsp;result to the fibre, no waste material would be shipped, and a&nbsp;clean fibre would be placed on the market.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The fibre possesses some very valuable properties; it is not only much stronger than any other known fibre, but almost&nbsp;equals silk in its brilliance. This latter property, however, is&nbsp;now challenged by mercerized cotton. It successfully resists&nbsp;atmospheric changes, is easily dyed and is affected but little by&nbsp;moisture. On the other hand, articles manufactured from it are</span></p>
