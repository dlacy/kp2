<p><span class="font1">stake, and which became a forfeit to the exchequer. (The original practice probably was for the stake to be deposited by both parties&nbsp;in the hands of the pontiffs before they were heard by the judge&nbsp;or judges; after judgment that of the gainer was restored to him,&nbsp;while that of the loser was retained for religious uses.) The magistrate also made arrangements for the interim possession of the&nbsp;land by one or other of the litigants (but preferably, it is thought,&nbsp;by the possessor), taking security from him that, if he was eventually unsuccessful, it should be returned to his opponent, along with&nbsp;all the fruits and profits drawn in the interval. At the trial, as both&nbsp;parties were vindicants, there must have been a certain burden&nbsp;of proof upon both sides. The vindicant, one may believe, must&nbsp;have been required to establish in the first instance that the thing&nbsp;he claimed had at some time been his; and then, but probably not&nbsp;till then, the counter-vindicant would have to prove a later title in&nbsp;his person sufficient to exclude that of his opponent. The judgment,&nbsp;as already observed, necessarily involved a finding on the main&nbsp;question; but in form it was a declaration as to the sacrament:&nbsp;that. of the party who prevailed .was declared to be just, and that&nbsp;of his unsuccessful opponent unjust.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Looking at this ritual as a whole, the conviction is irresistible that it could not have been so devised by one brain. It reveals&nbsp;and combines three distinct stages in the history’ of procedure—&nbsp;appeal to arms and self-help, appeal to the gods and the spiritual&nbsp;power, appeal to the civil magistrate and nis judicial office. As&nbsp;Gellius says, the real and substantial fight for might, that in olden&nbsp;days had been maintained at the point of the spear, had given&nbsp;place to a civil and festucarian combat in which words were the&nbsp;weapons, and which was to be settled by the interposition of .the&nbsp;praetor. But this does not explain the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sacramentum.</span><span class="font1"> Various&nbsp;theories have been proposed to account for it. According to Gaius,&nbsp;it was nothing more than the sum of money staked by each of&nbsp;the parties, uhieh was forfeited originally to sacred and afterwards to public uses by him who was unsuccessful, as a penalty&nbsp;for his rashly running into litigation; and substantially the same&nbsp;explanation is given by Festus in one of his definitions of the word.&nbsp;But this is far from satisfactory, for it involves the apparent&nbsp;absurdity of declaring that a penalty imposed by law could be&nbsp;just in the case of the party who was in the right, and unjust in&nbsp;the case of him who was in the wrong. There is another definition&nbsp;in Festus— “ a thing is said to be done </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sacramento</span><span class="font1"> when the sanction&nbsp;of an oath is interposed ”—that lends support to the opinion that&nbsp;there was a time when parties to a question of right were required&nbsp;to take an oath to the verity of their respective assertions; that&nbsp;they were also required concurrently to deposit five bullocks or&nbsp;five sheep, according to the nature or value of the thing in dispute,&nbsp;to abide the issue of the inquiry;<sup>@@1 </sup>that the question for determination was whose oath was just and whose unjust; and that he who&nbsp;was found to have sworn unjustly forfeited his cattle or sheep as&nbsp;a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">piamentum—</span><span class="font1">a peace-offering to the outraged deity—while the&nbsp;other party reclaimed his from the repository in which they had been&nbsp;detained in the interval.<sup>@@2</sup> It was made an opportunity doubtless&nbsp;by the priests to get some profit for their temples.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">The writers who adopt this view are far from being unanimous as to details. But there seems to be enough to render it more than&nbsp;probable that, at an intermediate stage between the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">vera solida vis&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">of ancient, times and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">vis civilis et festucaría</span><span class="font1"> which Gellius and&nbsp;Gaius depict, there was a procedure by appeal to the gods through&nbsp;means of oaths of verity sworn by the parties, in the manner and&nbsp;with the consequences that have been indicated. That in time it&nbsp;should have dropped out of the ritual is quite in the order of things.&nbsp;Its tendency was to become a mere form, imposing no real restraint&nbsp;on reckless litigation. The restraint was rather in the dread of&nbsp;forfeiture of the sacramental cattle, sheep or money that would&nbsp;follow a verdict that an oath had been unjust. And it must have&nbsp;been felt besides that it was unfair to brand a man as a false-swearer, needing to expiate his offence by an offering to the godr,&nbsp;whose oath had been perfectly honest. That he should suffer a&nbsp;penalty.for his imprudence in not having taken more care to ascertain&nbsp;his position, and for thus causing needless annoyance to others,&nbsp;was reasonable, but did not justify his being dealt with as one who&nbsp;had knowingly outraged the deity to whom he had appealed. So&nbsp;the oath—the original </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sacramentum—</span><span class="font1">disappeared, the name passing by a natural enough process to the money which had been&nbsp;wont to be deposited before the oath was sworn, but which now&nbsp;ceased to be an offering in expiation by a false-swearer, and became&nbsp;a mere penalty (forfeited to the state) of rash litigation </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(poena&nbsp;temer</span><span class="font1">e </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">litizantis).</span><span class="font1"> So when </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">praedes</span><span class="font1"> later took the place of actual&nbsp;deposits, they became bound as state debtors for the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sacramentum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It may well be assumed that in most cases the finding of the court as to the justness or unjustness of the respective sacraments of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Í</span><span class="font1">jarties was the end of the case—that it was at once accepted and oyally given effect to.. If in favour of the party to whom interim&nbsp;possession had been given by the magistrate there could be no&nbsp;difficulty; he retained.the object in dispute with the fruits and&nbsp;profits he had drawn in the interval between </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">litis contestatio</span><span class="font1"> and&nbsp;judgment. If, however, the finding was for the other party, and&nbsp;amicable arrangement was not come to, it is not clear what*course&nbsp;was followed. Gaius says that in awarding interim possession&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(vindicias dicere)</span><span class="font1"> the praetor required the grantee to give security&nbsp;by sureties </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(praedes) to</span><span class="font1"> his adversary for restitution to the latter&nbsp;in the event of his success; while Festus preserves a law of the&nbsp;XII. Tables which, according to Mommsen’s rendering, declared&nbsp;that, when it turned out that interim possession had been awarded&nbsp;to the wrong party, it was to be in such party’s power to demand&nbsp;the appointment of three arbiters who should ascertain the value&nbsp;of the object of vindication and its fruits, and assess the damages&nbsp;due for non-restitution at double the amount. This provision&nbsp;seems to have been intended to afford the wrongful interim possessor,&nbsp;who was not in a position to make specific restitution to his successful opponent, a means of avoiding the apprehension and imprisonment which were the statutory consequences of failure to&nbsp;implement a judgment. It is probable that in time this duplicated&nbsp;money payment came to be regarded as the satisfaction to which&nbsp;the successful party in a vindication was entitled in every case in&nbsp;which, no matter for what reason,, he was unable to obtain the&nbsp;thing itself and its fruits.from their interim possessor; that consequently an </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">arbitrium lili aestimandae,</span><span class="font1"> or reference to arbiters&nbsp;to assess their value, resulted in every such case; and that it was&nbsp;to assure its payment that the praetor required the party to whom&nbsp;the interim possession was.awarded to give to. his opponent the&nbsp;sureties </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(praedes litis et vindiciarum)</span><span class="font1"> to whom Gaius alludes.<sup>@@3</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This procedure in the sacramental action for vindication of land was applicable to every kind of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">manus</span><span class="font1"> which a man could claim to&nbsp;have over persons or things, though necessarily with variations more&nbsp;or less important in the ritual. But the sacramental action was also&nbsp;quite common for claims </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">in personam.</span><span class="font1"> As regards personal actions,&nbsp;the ordinarily received opinion, which rests, however, on slender&nbsp;foundations, is that from the first the parties met on equal terms;&nbsp;that, if it was a case of money debt, the creditor commenced the&nbsp;proceedings with the averment that the defendant owed him the&nbsp;sum in question,—“ I. say that you ought to pay me </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(dare oportere)&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">iooo </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">asses</span><span class="font1"> that this was met with a denial; and that a sacramental challenge followed on either, side. All are agreed that the&nbsp;remit was to a single </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">judex</span><span class="font1"> after an interval of thirty days from the&nbsp;proceedings </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">in jure*</span><span class="font1"> that where the claim was. for a definite sum the&nbsp;plaintiff had to establish his case.to the letter; and that his sacrament was necessarily declared unjust if he failed to prove his claim&nbsp;by a single penny.

<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@1 </sup>It was the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lex Aternia Tarpeia</span><span class="font1"> of the year 454 B.c. that commuted the five bullocks and five sheep into 500 and 50 lb of copper respectively (Cie. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">De Rep.</span><span class="font1"> ii. 35, § 60, where the words usually&nbsp;printed “ de multae sacramento ” should read “ dc multa et sacra-mento ”). See Festus, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">s.v. </span><span class="font1"><sup>lt</sup> Peculatus ” (in Bruns, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Fontes).</span><span class="font1"> As to&nbsp;the relative value of oxen and sheep, it is interesting to note that,&nbsp;by the customs of the modern Ossetians, ten sheep are also held&nbsp;to be equivalent to one ox. See Kovalewsky, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Coutume contem-poraine,</span><span class="font1"> p. 11. For the pounds’ weight of raw metal the XII.&nbsp;Tables substituted the same number of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">asses,</span><span class="font1"> declaring that 500&nbsp;should be the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">summa sacramenti</span><span class="font1"> when the cause of action was&nbsp;worth 1000 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">asses</span><span class="font1"> or more, 50 when worth less or the question one&nbsp;of freedom or slavery (Gai. iv. 14).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@2 </sup>Varro, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">De L. L.</span><span class="font1"> v. 180, says that, even after the. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">summa sacramenti</span><span class="font1"> had been converted into money, it was deposited </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ad pontem </span><span class="font1">—some bridge, he does not say which, where tncre was a sacred&nbsp;“ pound.” (Curiously enough, the Irish spelling of &quot; pound ”&nbsp;is “pont”; Skcat’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Etym. Diet., s.v.</span><span class="font1"> “Pound.’<sup>7</sup>) A most ingenious and plausible explanation was suggested by Danz in 1867,&nbsp;jn the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Zeitschr. f. Rechts gesch.</span><span class="font1"> vi. 359. Recalling the facts that&nbsp;there had been discovered in the Tiber Island </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sacella</span><span class="font1"> of Jupiter&nbsp;Jurarius and Dius Fidius, the two deities to whom solemn oaths&nbsp;were usually addressed, and that the island was spoken of as “ inter&nbsp;duos pontes,” because connected with both banks of the. river&nbsp;by bridges bearing no particular names, he suggested that the island&nbsp;may have been the place to which disputants resorted to make&nbsp;their </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sacramenta,</span><span class="font1"> and that the cattle, sheep or money were deposited&nbsp;in a place for the purpose before the bridge was crossed. Much&nbsp;the same explanation was offered by Huschkc two years later in his&nbsp;book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Das alte römische Jahr</span><span class="font1"> (Breslau, 1869), p. 360, apparently&nbsp;without being aware , of Danz’s speculation. He adds, on the&nbsp;authority of the Iguvine Tables, that, while bullocks were offered&nbsp;to Jupiter, only sheep were offered to Dius Fidius. The island,&nbsp;he thinks, must have been selected as neutral ground to which&nbsp;all parties might have access, and which obviated intrusion into</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">the temples of the two gods on the Capitol and Quirinal respectively. And it is to its use as the scene of the sacramental procedure that&nbsp;he attributes its name of “ holy island,” rather than.to the fact of&nbsp;its having been the seat of the temple of Aesculapius. Huschke&nbsp;recurs to and enforces this view in his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Multa und Sacramentum&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(1874), p. 410, where he docs refer to Danz’s paper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@3 </sup>Another theory is that, while the interim possessor could not be proceeded against, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">praedes,</span><span class="font1"> who were really bound in his place&nbsp;and not merely as accessories, were directly subject to execution&nbsp;as debtors of the state.
