.</p><p>Sweden and Norway form together one geographical region, situated between 4° and 32° E. Long., and 55 <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi> and 71° N. Lat. The greatest length, from Falsterbo in the province of Malmo, to Cape Nordkun in Finmark, exceeds 1000 geographical miles, and the superficial area is about 292,700 English square miles, of which 170,150 are in Sweden. Throughout the length of the peninsula, from the Varangerfiord in the north-east to the Scagerack in the south-west, a line of lofty and rugged mountains, hills, and table-lands extends for 1110 miles, forming the water-shed between the shores of the ocean and the basin of the Baltic Sea. Numerous rivers, which have their source at the base of this range, empty themselves into the Gulf of Bothnia. The principal of these are the Tomea, which, with its affluent the Muonio, forms the boundary between Swedish and Russian Lapmark ; the Kalix, the Ranea, the Lulea, the Pitea, the Sildut or Skellestia, the Unea, and Windel ; the Gildea, the Angerman, the Indals, the Ljusne, and Dahl. The Gotha is the outlet of Lake Wenner, and runs into the Cattegat at Gottenburg.</p><p>The lakes of Sweden are numerous, and cover a large space of the surface of the country. The principal of these are the Wenner, which, after those of Ladoga and Onega, is the largest in Europe ; it is ninety miles in length by thirty- six at its greatest breadth, and covers an area of 2136 square miles. The Wetter measures eighty-two miles in length by sixteen at its greatest breadth ; but is generally much narrower, and only contains 830 square miles. The Malar extends from Stockholm, nearly seventy miles in length ; it is crowded with islands, and presents throughout the greatest variety of beautiful scenery. At Stockholm it communicates, by a narrow strait, with an arm of the Baltic Sea, forming a very intricate navigation of sixty miles between the open sea and the capital.</p><p>Sweden is not more fortunate in its soil than in its climate. It cannot boast of any of those deep rich alluvial deposits which elsewhere usually occupy a large portion of low and well-watered countries. Coarse sand or gravel, but partially covered over with a thin layer of fertile soil, forms in general the champaign country ; and, besides the woods, which occupy more than three fourths of its surface, a large portion is covered with lakes, morasses, rivers, and with inconceivable numbers of boulder-stones or isolated rocks of every size. The surface has been thus numerically represented in square miles: Woods, 137,420; lakes, marshes, &amp;c., 11,900; meadows, pastures, &amp;c., 7350; arable land, 3480; total, 170,150 square miles. The soil of Norway is of much the same character as that of Sweden, in both the vegetation being abridged by the length and the severity of the winter : thc soil remains always poor ; and the paucity of alluvial tracts, with the prevalence of rock, seldom far beneath, and often forming the surface, materially detract from the quality as well as the quantity of the soil. In some parts however it is very rich, and the valleys in particular are celebrated for their luxuriant fertility ; but even there much of the soil is thin, and obstructed by rocky knobs rising above its surface.</p><p>In the most favoured situations of Sweden, as at Lund in Schonen, the mean temperature of the year does not exceed 45° Fahr., while at the North Cape it is at the freezing point ; the extreme cold, however, is modified by the elevations of the land, and its proximity to the sea. At North Cape, lat. 70° N., potatoes, broccoli, and gooseberries, are raised with some difficulty ; one degree farther south a little barley makes its appearance. In lat. 68° 20', at Enonte- keis, the crops of barley yield a remunerating harvest once in the three years. Rye and hemp cannot be successfully cultivated beyond 66°, nor oats beyond 64° ; this latter is also the general limit of garden cultivation. The cherry-tree, alder, and maple cease to thrive beyond 63° ; the ash and willow beyond 62° ; the elm, lime, and oak beyond 61° ; and the natural beech-woods do not extend beyond 57°. The mulberry, the chestnut, and the walnut arrive at perfection in Schonen, 54°. In the southern parts of the country an elevation of 500 feet above the level of the sea is found to have the same effect on the climate and vegetation as 175 miles of north latitude, a thousand feet as 300 miles, and two thousand feet as 630 miles ; but the<pb facs="chi.12945678-1526170221_Page_0045.jpf" xml:id="eb07-21-s06-0030"/>
effect is of course more rapid and powerful as we advance to the north.</p><p>The inhabitants consist of Swedes, Lapons or Laps, and Finns. The Swedes are a branch of the same family as the Danes and Norwegians, and speak a dialect of the same language, considerably modified, however, by the consequences of the long political separation and international enmity of the two nations. Books are translated from the one language to the other ; but the vulgar tongue, the language of the peasantry in Sweden and Norway, differs not much more than broad Scotch from Cockney English. The roots of words, construction, and idioms are the same in both, or have a common origin.</p><p>In 1751 the population of Sweden amounted to 1,785,727, in 1800 to 2,347,303, and in 1830 to 2,888,082. Norway in 1825 contained 1,051,318 inhabitants, and in 1836 the population was 1,200,000, showing an increase of nearly 150,000 during the preceding ten years. In Sweden the annual number of births is one to twenty-eight of the population, in Norway one to thirty-four. In Sweden the marriages are one in 112, in Norway one in 130; but in Sweden the mortality is one in thirty-four and a half, and in Norway only one in forty-eight. The standing army amounts to 33,000 ; but in the time of war it may be raised by conscription to 240,000. In 1825 the inhabitants of the towns of Sweden amounted to 279,645, or about one tenth of the population. Stockholm had then a population of 97,183, Gottenburg 26,702, Carlserona 11,943. All the other towns are little better than villages.</p><p>The Swedes are represented to be a brave, hardy, generous, and enterprising people, distinguished by a happy union of courage and steadiness, fine genius, and natural probity of disposition. They are said, however, to be greatly addicted to drunkenness ; and this unfortunate habit is the fruitful source of many evils, both moral and physical.<note anchored="true" n="1" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> Laing’s Travels in Sweden, p. 110.</p></note> In 1835 one person out of every 114 of the population was accused, and one out of every 140 convicted, of some criminal offence.</p><p>With the exception of a few congregations in Stockholm and other principal towns, the Swedes are all Lutherans, and Lutheranism is the established religion of the state. Other sects are now allowed the free exercise of worship ; but Catholics and all other dissenters are excluded from the diet and higher offices of state. In the whole kingdom there are 2490 congregations, viz, 1147 country parishes, and 129 town charges, with 1214 annexed chapels in the larger parishes. The whole personal establishment consists of 3193 clergy, and 3753 sextons or parish-clerks, organists, and church servants. The hierarchy consists of one archbishop of Upsala, and eleven bishops, viz. of Lund, Gottenburg, Wexio, Calmar, Linkioping, Skara, Carlstadt, Wisby, Westeraas, Strangnæs, and Hernosand ; seventy archdeacons, and 192 probsts (provosts or deans). The archbishop’s income is rated at about L.2000 sterling a year, the bishops at more than L.600 each, and the archdeacons and probsts from L.400 to L.700 each. None of the inferior clergy has less than L.120, while many have as much as L.300, besides parsonage-houses and glebe-lands. The clergy, as a body, have been always distinguished for piety and morality, and yet among their people religious feeling and moral purity are at a very low ebb ; their religion indeed has become little better than a system of rites and ceremonies. There is, however, a spirit of religious enthusiasm spreading in the north of Sweden, especially among the new colonists or squatters in Lapland ; but this spirit the clergy attempt to extinguish. These religionists are called Læseren, or readers, from their reading the scriptures; but they do not form a sect having internal</p><p>communion and regulations. They are however numerous ; their numbers are said to be increasing, and their meetings for preaching are attended by people from great distances. The Catholics throughout the kingdom do not amount to 2000, the greater part of whom reside in the capital, and the whole are foreigners. The Swedenborgians, the only sect which the country has produced, are also comparatively few. The Jews scarcely exceed 1000 individuals, and have four synagogues, at Stockholm, Gottenburg, Norrkoping, and Carlscrona.</p><p>Of the whole population, including even the Laps, it is reckoned that the proportion of grown persons unable to read is less than one in a thousand. This general diffusion of elementary education is ascribed to the zeal of King Gustaf-Wasa (Gustavus Vasa, 1523-1560), and his immediate successors. John III., in 1574, ordered that the nobleman who had no knowledge of book-learning should forfeit his nobility ; Charles XI., in 1684, required the clergy to have every Swedish subject taught to read ; and made it a law that no marriage should be celebrated unless the parties had previously taken the Lord’s Supper; and that none should be admitted to the communion-table who could not read, and was not instructed in religion. Parish schools, however, are only found where there happen to have been lands or rents bequeathed for their endowment ; and these in some parishes are ambulatory, in others fixed. It is supposed that more than half of all the parishes have no schools ; but the deficiency is supplied by the people themselves, who teach their children at home in the leisure hours of their long winters. The king, however, in his speech at the opening of the present diet, 1840, has recommended the establishment of a primary sch∞l in every parish. In the provincial towns there are gymnasia, or high schools, which prepare youth for the universities. They are under the care of the bishops, and, besides the higher branches of Greek and Roman literature, their course often embraces the oriental languages, and the leading doctrines of theology. There are two universities, one at Upsala, and the other at Lund. In these the teachers may be divided into three classes: 1. professors ; 2. adjuncts, or privileged teachers in different sciences, who give instruction privately or publicly to the students, and who are expectants of professorships; and 3. the masters in modern languages, exercises, and other inferior branches. Of the theological faculty there are four professors at Upsala, and four at Lund ; of the juridical faculty, two at each ; of the medical and surgical, five at each ; of the philosophical and literary, fourteen at Upsala, and ten at Lund.</p><p>The constitution is of a mixed character, in which the executive and administrative departments are managed by a hereditary king and his ministers, while the legislative is vested conjointly in the king and a diet of four chambers, elected by the nobles, clergy, burghers, and peasants. The noble families are reckoned at about 2400. The head of each is by right a member of the diet, but seldom more than 400 take any part in its proceedings. The clergy have sixty representatives, including the archbishop and bishops, of whom the primate is always president The burghers are elected by eighty-five cities and towns; Stockholm returning ten, Gottenburg three, Norrkoping two, and each of the rest one. The peasantry have between 140 and 150 representatives, chosen by districts ; and these, as well as the burghers, are required to possess a certain amount of qualification in property ; and each of their chambers has a president, appointed by the king. During the session each member of the last three orders receives a small pecuniary compensation, paid by his constituents, the amount of which is voluntary. The diet meets at intervale of five years, and<pb facs="chi.12945678-1526170221_Page_0046.jpf" xml:id="eb07-21-s06-0031"/>
then sits for three months certain, but generally longer. Practically, the power of the diet rests in the nobility and clergy. But the most important branch of the constitution is the council of state, which consists of one minister for justice, one for foreign affairs, other six councillors, and the chancellor of the court, and is attended by the four secretaries of state, who have the four departments of home affairs; military and naval affairs ; finances, trade, customs, and post-office ; and affairs of the church, general education, and the poor. The king can do nothing, except in military and diplomatic affairs, without consulting this council, which must keep a protocol of its proceedings, in which each member has a right to explain his opinions.</p><p>Relatively to its means, Sweden is much more heavily taxed than either England or France, and yet the public revenues raised by taxation do not amount to L.2,000,000 sterling. According to the report of 1832, the sum was 20,247,339 dollars banca, or L. 1,687,278 sterling, of which more than one half was raised by a direct land-tax, the remainder by customs and other indirect means.</p><p>Since the beginning of the present century, the agriculture of Sweden has experienced great improvement. The Swedes have become exporters of grain to a considerable extent ; and as seven ninths of the population are engaged in the cultivation of the soil, a large proportion of which is still unproductive from want of cultivation, the quantity might be very greatly increased. The whole annual produce of the soil is estimated at forty-five millions of dollars. Within a few years land has risen considerably in value ; and this is owing to the exertions of the agricultural societies established in the provinces, and the great interest which the landed proprietors now take in the management and improvement of their estates. The cultivation of the potato has indeed been the mainspring in the improvement of Swedish agriculture. Not only has it precluded the necessity of using the bark of trees as a miserable substitute for bread, but has occasioned the public and private magazines to be completely filled with grain ; and the greatest difficulty with which cultivators have at present to contend, is the want of a market for their surplus stock.</p><p>Both horses and horned cattle are small in Sweden. The former, however, are active and spirited, the latter afford excellent milk and beef. The sheep are generally of an inferior kind ; but great pains have been taken to improve them by crosses with the Spanish, French, and English breeds. Towards the sixty-third degree, sheep disappear, and are superseded by goats, which are most numerous in the woodland districts of Dalarne and Nordland. The seedtime is in May, the harvest in August, and as the fine weather is short and warm, the labours of the farmer are then very constant and fatiguing, while a great number of people are required to reap the crops, for whom there is no employment during winter, when the country is all covered with snow. This will ever remain an obstacle to agricultural improvement, especially in the northern districts. The average of the harvests throughout the kingdom for seven years has been found to be three good, three middling, and one a failure. The average rate of fecundity is four and three seventh grains for one.</p><p>Both the sea and the fresh waters swarm with fish, which afford employment and subsistence to many of the inhabitants. The fresh waters contain perch, pike, salmon, trout, grayling, char, roach, bleak, and eels ; but of all these the salmon is the most important object of industry and trade. They are more abundant in the northern rivers than in those of the south, and fisheries are established on most of them. The sea-fish are not less numerous or important. Herrings are sometimes caught in incredible numbers at Gottenburg, though at other times they entirely forsake the coast.</p><p>Next to agriculture, the mines of Sweden arc the chief source of her wealth. Throughout the kingdom, iron exists in great abundance. The mountain Gellivara, in Lapmark, 1800 feet high, is one mass of the richest iron ore ; but its situation beyond the polar circle (in lat. 67° 20' N.), far from the sea, and in an unpeopled wilderness, deprives it of its value. In various other places, however, there are similar hills, and even islands of compact iron ore are to be found near the coast. About the year 1683, the quantity of iron forged in Sweden in one year amounted to 9690 tons, but in the course of the next century a great increase took place. Between the years 1759-60, the average annual produce amounted to 328,766 Swedish pounds, and has continued very nearly the same to the present time, though it is represented as being now in a state of great activity and prosperity. The quantity of bar-iron produced in the year ending 1st November 1839 is stated at 276,000 skip pounds, and of manufactured iron 33,600, which, added to 11,600 of the latter, and 126,700 of the former, on hand at 1st November 1838, made a total of 448,000 skip pounds. Of this amount, 304,896 were exported, 283,500 in the shape of bar, and 21,390 manufactured; the prices during the year having been ten bank rix-dollars, or L.1. 5s. 10d. sterling the skip pound, which is equal to 280 pounds, or a quarter of a ton avoirdupois. The forests of Sweden occupy more than one half of its surface ; and the abundance of wood thus supplied is of the highest utility in working the mines and smelting the ores. Swedish iron is superior in ductility and malleability to all others ; a superiority which is attributed in part to the use of wood instead of coal or peat in their furnaces. The number of mines in all Sweden is 586 ; and of these no fewer than 361 are close together in the heart of the kingdom, in Nerike, Westmanland, and part of Dalarne. Danemora, the principal iron mine, produces yearly about 4000 tons of metal, which is particularly adapted to the manufacture of steel. Next to iron, copper forms the most important of the mineral riches of Sweden. The principal mine has long been at Fahlun, but the produce scarcely exceeds 1,000,000 pounds. The most important of the other copper-mines are those of Hakanbo in Nerike, Nyakopparberg in Nyko- pingslan, Atvedaberg in Linkopingslan, at Areskuta in Jemtland, and Ryddarshytta and Bastras in Westeraaslan. The whole copper produced in Sweden in 1824 was 814 tons, of the value of L.51,777 sterling. Gold is also found at Fahlun and in some other places ; but the produce is too small to pay the expense. Silver is also produced to the extent of about 3000 marks annually ; but the expense is so great that it is proposed to relinquish the working. Fahlun likewise produces sulphur and vitriol. In Scania, near Helsingfors, there is a small bed of coal ; and cobalt, to the value of about L.12,000 sterling, is also produced in Sweden.</p><p>The manufactures are in a very low state. Every art and trade has its own corporate rights and monopolies, which operate as a complete bar to improvement ; and of the total population only about one-seventieth part is engaged in manufactures and trade of every kind. Coarse linens are the chief manufacture. Machinery for spinning wool and cotton has been introduced, but the experiment is too recent to warrant a decided opinion as to its ultimate success. The other articles of manufacture are such common goods as are required to supply the ordinary wants of the people.</p><p>The general trade of Sweden is in almost as low a state as its manufactures. The principal exports consist of articles of native produce, in their raw or manufactured state. Iron ranks first, then timber, copper, tar, and grain. The principal imports are sugar, coffee, tobacco, salt or smoked fish, salt, leather, hemp, silk, cotton, and wine, chiefly articles of domestic comfort or luxury. Mr Laing states the amount of the mercantile shipping at only 30,439 tons ; but Forsell states it as having been.<pb facs="chi.12945678-1526170221_Page_0047.jpf" xml:id="eb07-21-s06-0032"/>
in 1831, 137,514 tons, or 1122 vessels. The principal mercantile ports are Stockholm and Gottenburg.</p><p>Sweden is divided into twenty-four <hi rend="italic">lans,</hi> or governments, which are subdivided into <hi rend="italic">fogderier,</hi> or districts.
