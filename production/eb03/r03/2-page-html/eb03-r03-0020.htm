<p><span class="font0">the ſtrands till they really break : and we believe that, in the general practice of making large hawſers, many&nbsp;of the outer yarns in the ſtrands, eſpecially thoſe which&nbsp;chance to be outermoſt in the laid rope, and are therefore moſt ſtrained, are broken during the operation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But there is another conſideration which ſhould alſo make us give no greater twiſt in any part of the operation than is abſolutely neceſſary for the firm coheſion of&nbsp;the parts, and this independent of the ſtrain to which&nbsp;the fibres or yarns are ſubjected. Twiſting cauſes all&nbsp;the fibres to lie obliquely with reſpect to the axis or&nbsp;general direction of the rope. It may juſt happen that&nbsp;one fibre or one yarn ſhall keep in the axis, and remain&nbsp;ſtraight ; all the reſt muſt be oblique, and the more&nbsp;oblique as they are farther from the axis, and as they&nbsp;are more twiſted. Now it is to be demonſtrated,&nbsp;that when any ſtrain is given to the rope in the direction of its length, a ſtrain greater than this is actually&nbsp;excited on the oblique fibres, and ſo much the greater&nbsp;as they are more oblique ; and thus the fibres which&nbsp;are already the weakeſt are expoſed to the greateſt&nbsp;ſtrains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Let CF (fig. 13.) repreſent a fibre hanging from a hook, and loaded with a weight F, which it is juſt able&nbsp;to bear, but not more. This weight may repreſent the&nbsp;abſolute force of the fibre. Let ſuch another fibre be&nbsp;laid over the two pulleys A, B (ſig. 14.), which are in&nbsp;a horizontal line AB, and let weights F and</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ſ,</span><span class="font0"> equal&nbsp;to the former, be hung on the ends of this fibre, while&nbsp;another weight R, leſs than the ſum of F and ∕, is hung&nbsp;on the middle point C by a hook or thread. This weight&nbsp;wfill draw dowm the fibre into ſuch a poſition ACB,&nbsp;that the three w<sup>τ</sup>eights F, R, andj<sup>f</sup>, are in equilibrio by&nbsp;the intervention of the fibre. We affirm that this weight&nbsp;R is the meaſure of the relative ſtrength of the fibre in&nbsp;relation to the form ACB ; for the fibre is equally&nbsp;ſtretched in all its parts, and therefore in every part it&nbsp;is ſtrained by the force F. If therefore the weights F&nbsp;and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">f</span><span class="font0"> are held faſt, and any addition is made to the&nbsp;weight R, the fibre muſt break, being already ſtrained&nbsp;to its full ſtrength; therefore R meaſures its ſtrength&nbsp;in relation to its ſituation. Complete the parallelogram&nbsp;ACBD, and draw the diagonal CD ; becauſe AB is&nbsp;horizontal, and AC=BC, DC is vertical, and coincides with the direction CR, by which the weight R&nbsp;acts. The point C is drawn by three forces, wfiιich are&nbsp;in equilibrio. They are therefore proportional to the&nbsp;ſides of a triangle, which have the ſame directions ; or,&nbsp;the force acting in the direction CA is to that acting&nbsp;in the direction CR as CA to CD. The point R is&nbsp;ſupported by the two forces CA, CB, which are equivalent to CD ; and therefore the weight F is to the&nbsp;weight R as CA is to CD. Therefore the abſolute&nbsp;ſtrengths of the two fibres AC, BC, taken ſeparately,&nbsp;are greater than their united ſtrengths in relation to&nbsp;their poſition wfitlι reſpect to CR : and ſince this proportion remains the ſame, whatever equal weights are&nbsp;hung on at F and</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ſ,</span><span class="font0"> it follows, that when any ſtrain&nbsp;DC is made to act on this ſibre in the direction DC,&nbsp;it excites a greater ſtrain on the fibre, becauſe CA and&nbsp;•CB taken together are greater than CD. Each fibre&nbsp;ffuſtains a ſtrain greater than the half of CD.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Now let the weight R be turned round the axis CR. This will cauſe the two parts of the fibre ACB to lap&nbsp;round each other, and compoſe aTwiſted line or cord</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">CR, as in fig. 15. and the parallelogram ACBD will remain of the ſame form, by the yielding of the weights&nbsp;F and</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ſ,</span><span class="font0"> as is evident from the equilibrium of forces.&nbsp;The fibre wfill always aſſume that form which makes&nbsp;the ſides and diagonal in the proportion of the weights.&nbsp;While the fibres lap round each other, they are ſtrained&nbsp;to the ſame degree, that is, to the full extent of their&nbsp;ſtrength, and they remain in this degree of ſtrain in&nbsp;every part of the line or cord CR. If therefore each&nbsp;of the fibres lias the ſtrength AB, the cord has the&nbsp;ſtrength DC ; and if F and</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ſ</span><span class="font0"> be held faſt, the ſmalleſt&nbsp;addition to R will break the cord. The ſum of the&nbsp;abſolute ſtrength of the two fibres of which this thread&nbsp;is compoſed is to the ſum of their relative ſtrengths, or&nbsp;to the ſtrength of the thread, as AC-{-CB is to CD, or&nbsp;as AC is to EC.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If the weights F and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ſ</span><span class="font0"> are not held faſt, but allowed to yield, a heavier weight </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span class="font0"> may be hung on at C with-out breaking the fibre ; ſor it will draw it into another&nbsp;poſition A </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">c</span><span class="font0"> B, ſuch that </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span class="font0"> ſhall be in equilibrio wfith F&nbsp;and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ſ.</span><span class="font0"> Since F and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ſ</span><span class="font0"> remain the ſame, the fibre is as&nbsp;much ſtrained as before. Therefore make </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">c a, cb</span><span class="font0"> equal&nbsp;to C A and' CB, and complete the parallelogram </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a c b d.&nbsp;cd</span><span class="font0"> wfill now be the meaſure of the weight r, becauſe it&nbsp;is the equivalent of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">c a</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">cb.</span><span class="font0"> It is evident that </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">cd&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">is greater than CD, and therefore the thread formed by&nbsp;the lapping of the ſibre in the poſition </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a c b</span><span class="font0"> is ſtronger&nbsp;than the former, in the proportion of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">c d</span><span class="font0"> to CD, or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">c e&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">to CE. The cord is therefore ſo much ſtronger as the&nbsp;fibres are more parallel to the axis, and it muſt be&nbsp;ſtrongeſt of all when they are quite parallel. Bring the&nbsp;pulleys A, B cloſe to each other. It is plain that if&nbsp;we hang on a weight R leſs than the ſum of F and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">f,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">it cannot take down the bight of the fibre; but if equal&nbsp;to them, although it cannot pull it down, it will keep&nbsp;it dow<sup>r</sup>n. In this caſe, wfiιen the fibres are parallel to&nbsp;each other, the ſtrength of the cord (improperly ſo&nbsp;called) is equal to the united abſolute ſtrengths of the&nbsp;fibres.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is eaſy to ſee that the length of each of the fibres which compoſe any part CR of this cord is to the&nbsp;length of the part of the cord as AC to EC ; and this&nbsp;is the caſe even although they ſhould lap round a cylinder of any diameter. This will appear very clearly to&nbsp;anyperfon who conſiders the thing with attention. Let&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a c</span><span class="font0"> (ſig. 16.) be an indefinitely ſmall portion of the&nbsp;fibre which is lapped obliquely round the cylinder, and&nbsp;let HKG be a ſection perpendicular to the axis. Draw&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a e</span><span class="font0"> parallel to the axis, and draw </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e c</span><span class="font0"> to the centre of the&nbsp;circle HKG, and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a e'</span><span class="font0"> parallel to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ec.</span><span class="font0"> It is plain that </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e'e&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">is the length of the axis correſponding to the ſmall portion </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">n c,</span><span class="font0"> and that </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e'e</span><span class="font0"> is equal to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a ς.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Hence we derive another manner of expreſſing the ratio of the abſolute and relative ſtrength; and we may&nbsp;ſay that the abſolute ſtrength of a fibre, wfiιich has the&nbsp;ſame obliquity throughout, is to its relative ſtrength as&nbsp;the length of the ſibre to the length of the cord of&nbsp;which it makes a part. And we may ſay, that the&nbsp;ſtrength of a rope is to the united abſolute ſtrength ρf&nbsp;its yarns as the length, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">oi</span><span class="font0"> the cord to the length of the&nbsp;yarns ; for although the yarns are in various ſtates of&nbsp;obliquity, they contribute to the ſtrength of the cord&nbsp;in as much as they contribute immediately to the ſtrength&nbsp;oſ the ſtrands. The ſtrength of the yarns is to that of&nbsp;the ſtrands as the length of the yarns to that of the</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
