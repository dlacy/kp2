<p><label>RYBINSK</label>
or Ruibinsk, a town of Russia, in the government of Yaroslavl, 60 m. by river N.W. of Yaroslavl. It is connected by rail (186 m.) with Bologoye, on the line between St Petersburg and Moscow. It derives its importance from its situation on the Volga, opposite the mouth of the Sheksna, which connects the Volga with the regions around Lake Ladoga. Rybinsk has also an active trade in agricultural products from the neighbouring districts. The permanent population, which was 25,223 in 1897, is increased in the summer by nearly 100,000 workers from different parts of Russia.</p>
