                <p><label>RUSSELL, LORD WILLIAM</label>
                    <hi rend="italic">(1639^1683),</hi> English politician, was the third son of the
                    1st duke of Bedford and was born on the 29th of September 1639. About 1654 he
                    was sent to Cambridge with his elder brother Francis (on whose death in 1678 he
                    obtained the courtesy title of Lord Russell). On leaving the university, the two
                    brothers travelled abroad, visiting Lyons and Geneva, and residing for some
                    while at Augsburg. William’s account of his impressions is spirited and
                    interesting. He was at Paris in 1658, but had returned to Woburn in December
                    1659. At the Restoration he was elected for the family borough of Tavistock. For
                    a long time he appears to have taken no part in public affairs, but rather to
                    have indulged in the follies of court life and intrigue; for both in 1663 and
                    1664 he was engaged in duels, in the latter of which he was wounded. In 1669 he
                    married Rachel (1636-1723), second daughter of the 4th earl of Southampton, and
                    widow of Lord Vaughan, thus becoming connected with Shaftesbury, who had married
                    Southampton’s niece. With his wife Russell always lived on terms of the greatest
                    affection and confidence. She corresponded with Tillotson and other
                    distinguished men, and a collection of her admirable letters was published in
                    1773.</p>
               <p>It was not until the formation of the <hi rend="sup">a</hi> country party,” in
                    opposition to the policy of the Cabal and Charles’s French-Catholic plots, that
                    Russell began to take an active part in affairs. He then joined Cavendish,
                    Birch, Hampden, Powell, Lyttleton and others in vehement antagonism to the
                    court. With a passionate hatred and distrust of the Catholics, and an intense
                    love of political liberty, he united the desire for ease to Protestant
                    Dissenters. His first speech appears to have been on the 22nd of January 1673,
                    in which he inveighed against the stop of the exchequer, the attack on the
                    Smyrna fleet, the corruption of courtiers with French money, and <hi rend="sup"
                        >a</hi> the ill ministers about the king.” He also supported the proceedings
                    against the duke of Buckingham. In 1675 he moved an address to the king for the
                    removal of Danby (see Leeds, Duke of) from the royal councils, and for his
                    impeachment. On the 15th of February 1677, in the debate on the fifteen months’
                    prorogation, he moved the dissolution of parliament; and in March 1678 he
                    seconded the address praying the king to declare war against France. The enmity
                    of the country party against Danby and James, and their desire for a dissolution
                    and the disbanding of the army, were greater than their enmity to Louis. The
                    French king therefore found it easy to form a temporary alliance with Russell,
                    Hollis and the opposition leaders, by which they engaged to cripple the king’s
                    power of hurting France and to compel him to seek Louis’s friendship,—that
                    friendship, however, to be given only on the condition that they in their turn
                    should have Louis’s support for their cherished objects. Russell in particular
                    entered into close communication with the marquis de Ruvigny (Lady Russell’s
                    maternal uncle), who came over with money for distribution among members of
                    parliament. By the testimony of Barillon, however, it is clear that Russell
                    himself utterly refused to take any part in the intended corruption.</p>
               <p>By the wild alarms which culminated in the Popish Terror Russell appears to have
                    been affected more completely than his otherwise sober character would have led
                    people to expect. He threw himself into the party which looked to Monmouth as
                    the representative of Protestant interests, a grave political blunder, though he
                    afterwards was in confidential communication with Orange. On the 4th of November
                    1678 he moved an address to the king to remove the duke of York from his person
                    and councils. At the dissolution of the pensionary parliament, he was, in the
                    new elections, returned for Bedfordshire. Danby was at once overthrown, and in
                    April 1679 Russell was one of the new privy cpuncil formed by Charles on the
                    advice of Temple. Only six days after this we find him moving for a committee to
                    draw up a bill to secure religion and property in case of a popish successor. He
                    does not, however, appear to have taken part in the exclusion debates at this
                    time. In June, on the occasion of the Covenanters’ rising in Scotland, he
                    attacked Lauderdale personally in full council.</p>
               <p>In January 1680 Russell, along with Cavendish. Capell, Powell, Essex and
                    Lyttleton, tendered his resignation to the king, which was received hy Charles “
                    with all my heart.” On the 16th of June he accompanied Shaftesbury, when the
                    latter indicted James at Westminster as a popish recusant; and on the 26th of
                    October he took the extreme step of moving “how to suppress popery and prevent a
                    popish successor”; while on the 2nd of November, now at the height of his
                    influence, he went still further by seconding the motion for exclusion in its
                    most emphatic shape, and on the 19th carried the bill to the House of Lords for
                    their concurrence. The limitation scheme he opposed, on the ground that monarchy
                    under the conditions expressed in it would be an absurdity. The statement, made
                    by Echard alone <hi rend="italic">(Hist, of England,</hi> ii.), that he joined
                    in opposing the indulgence shown to Lord Strafford hy Charles in dispensing with
                    the more horrible parts of the sentence of death—an indulgence afterwards shown
                    to Russell himself—is entirely unworthy of credence. On December 18 he moved to
                    refuse supplies until the king passed the Exclusion Bill. The prince of Orange
                    having come over at this time, there was a tendency on the part of the
                    opposition leaders to accept his endeavours to secure a compromise on the
                    exclusion question. Russell, however, refused to give way a hair’s-breadth.</p>
               <p>On the 26th of March 1681, in the parliament held at Oxford, Russell again
                    seconded the Exclusion Bill. Upon the dissolution he retired into privacy at his
                    country seat of Stratton in Hampshire. It was, however, no doubt at his wish
                    that his chaplain -wrote the <hi rend="italic">Life of Julian the Apostate,</hi>
                    in reply to Dr Hickes’s sermons, in which the lawfulness of resistance in
                    extreme cases was defended. In the wild schemes of Shaftesbury after the
                    election of Tory sheriffs for London in 1682 he had no share; upon the violation
                    of the charters, however, in 1683, he began Seriously to consider as to the best
                    means of resisting the government, and on one occasion attended a meeting at
                    which treason, or what might be construed as treason, was talked. Monmouth,
                    Essex, Hampden, Sidney and Howard of Escrick were the principal of those who met
                    to consult. On the breaking out of the Rye House Plot, of which neither he,
                    Essex, nor Sidney had the slightest knowledge, he was accused by informers of
                    promising his assistance to raise an insurrection and compass the death of the
                    king. Refusing to attempt to escape, he was brought before the council, when his
                    attendance at the meeting referred to was charged against him. He was sent on
                    the 26th of June 1683 to the Tower, and, looking upon himself as a dying man,
                    betook himself wholly to preparation for death. Monmouth offered to appear to
                    take his trial, if thereby he could help Russell, and Essex refused to abscond
                    for fear of injuring his friend’s chance of escape. Before a committee of</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r05-0867" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0924.jp2"/>
               <p>the council Russell, on the 28th of June, acknowledged his presence at the
                    meeting, but denied all knowledge of the proposed insurrection. He reserved his
                    defence, however, until his trial. He would probably have saved his life but for
                    the perjury of Lord Howard. The suicide of Essex, the news of which was brought
                    into court during the trial, was quoted as additional evidence against him, as
                    pointing to the certainty of Essex’s guilt. On July 19 he was tried at the Old
                    Bailey, his wife assisting him in his defence. Evidence was given by an informer
                    that, while at Shaftesbury’s hiding-place in Wapping, Russell had joined in the
                    proposal to seize the king’s guard, a charge indignantly denied by him in his
                    farewell paper, and that he was one of a committee of six appointed to prepare
                    the scheme for an insurrection. Howard, too, expressly declared that Russell had
                    urged the entering into communications with Argyll in Scotland. Howard’s perjury
                    is clear from other witnesses, but the evidence was accepted. Russell spoke with
                    spirit and dignity in his own defence, and, in especial, vehemently denied that
                    he had ever been party to a design so wicked and so foolish as those of the
                    murder of the king and of rebellion. It will be observed that the legality of
                    the trial, in so far as the jurors were not properly qualified and the law of
                    treason was shamefully strained, was denied in the act of 1 William &amp;
                    Mary which annulled the attainder. Hallam maintains that the only overt act of
                    treason proved against Russell was his concurrence in the project of a rising at
                    Taunton, which he denied, and which, Ramsay being the only witness, was not
                    sufficient to warrant a conviction.</p>
               <p>Russell was sentenced to die. Many attempts were made to save his life. The old
                    earl of Bedford offered £50,000 or £100,000, and Monmouth, Legge, Lady Ranelagh,
                    and Rochester added their intercessions. Russell himself, in petitions to
                    Charles and James, offered to live abroad if his life were spared, and never
                    again to meddle in the affairs of England. He refused, however, to yield to the
                    influence of Burnet and Tillotson, who endeavoured to make him grant the
                    unlawfulness of resistance, although it is more than probable that compliance in
                    this would have saved his life. He drew up, with Burnet’s assistance, a paper
                    containing his apology, and he wrote to the king a letter, to be delivered after
                    his death, in which he asked Charles’s pardon for any wrong he had done him. A
                    suggestion of escape from Lord Cavendish he refused. He behaved with his usual
                    quiet cheerfulness during his stay in the Tower, spending his last day on earth
                    as he had intended to spend the following Sunday if he had reached it. He
                    received the sacrament from Tillotson, and Burnet twice preached to him. Having
                    supped with his wife, the parting from whom was his only great trial, he slept
                    peacefully, and spent the last morning in devotion with Burnet. He went to the
                    place of execution in Lincoln’s Inn Fields with perfect calmness, which was
                    preserved to the last. He died on the 21st of July 1683, in the forty-fourth
                    year of his age. His attainder was reversed in 1689, and his son Wriothesley
                    (1680-1711) succeeded his grandfather as 2nd duke of Bedford in 1700.</p>
               <p>A true and moderate summing-up of his character will be found in his <hi
