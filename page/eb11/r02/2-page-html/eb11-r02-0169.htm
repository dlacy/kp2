<p><span class="font0">The outer enclosure runs across the island in a N. and S. direction; the inner forms a kind of parabola with its arms (Rempart du Tremblet on the S. and Rempart du Bois Blanc on the N.)&nbsp;stretching E. to the sea and embracing not only the volcano&nbsp;proper but also the great eastward slope known as the Grand&nbsp;Brûlé. The 30 m. of mountain wall round the volcano is perhaps unique in its astonishing rcguIarity. It encloses an area&nbsp;of about 40 sq. m. known as the Grand Enclos. There are&nbsp;two principal craters, each on an elevated cone,—the more&nbsp;westerly, now extinct, known as the Bory Crater (8612 ft.),&nbsp;after Bory de St Vincent, the geologist, and the more easterly&nbsp;called the Burning Crater or Fournaise (8294 ft.). The latter&nbsp;is partially surrounded by an “ enclosure ” on a small scale&nbsp;with precipices 200 ft. high. Eruptions, though not infrequent&nbsp;(thirty were registered between 1735 and i860), are seldom&nbsp;serious; the more noteworthy are those of 1745, 1778, 1791,&nbsp;1812, i860, 1870, 1881. Hot mineral springs are found on the&nbsp;flanks of the Piton des Neiges; the Source de Salazie (discovered&nbsp;in 1831) lies 2860 ft. above sea-level, has a temperature of 90°,&nbsp;and discharges 200 to 220 gallons per hour of water impregnated&nbsp;with bicarbonate of soda, and carbonates of magnesium and&nbsp;lime, iron, &amp;c.; that of Cilaos (discovered in 1826) is 3650 ft.&nbsp;above the sea with a temperature of 100°; and that of Mafate&nbsp;2238 ft. and 87°.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Vertically Réunion may be divided into five zones. The first or maritime zone contains all the towns and most of the&nbsp;villages, built on the limited areas of level alluvium occurring&nbsp;at intervals round the coast. In the second, which lies between&nbsp;2600 and 4000 ft., the sugar plantations made a green beIt&nbsp;round the island and country houses abound. The third zone&nbsp;is that of the forests; the fourth that of the plateaus, where&nbsp;European vegetables can be cultivated; and above this extends&nbsp;the region of the mountains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Climate.—</span><span class="font2">The year divides into two seasons—that of heat and rain from November to April, that of dry and more bracing weather&nbsp;from May to October. The prevailing winds are from the S.E.,&nbsp;sometimes veering round to the S., and more frequently to the&nbsp;N.E.; the W. winds are not so steady (three hundred and seven&nbsp;days of E. to fifty-eight of W. wind in the course of the year). It&nbsp;is seldom calm during the day, but there is usually a period of&nbsp;complete repose before the land wind begins in the evening.&nbsp;Several years sometimes pass without a cyclone visiting the island ;&nbsp;at other times they occur more than once in a single “ winter.”&nbsp;The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">raz de marée</span><span class="font2"> occasionally does great damage. On the leeward&nbsp;side of the island the winds are generally from the W. and S.W.,&nbsp;and bring little rain. Mist hangs almost all day on the tops of the&nbsp;mountains, but usually clears on at night. On the coast and lower&nbsp;zones on the windward side the mean temperature is about 73° F.&nbsp;in the “ winter ” and 78° F. in the “ summer.” On the leeward&nbsp;side the heat is somewhat greater. In the Salazie cirque the mean&nbsp;annual average is 66° F.*, at the Plaine des Palmistes 62° F. The&nbsp;rainfall is very heavy on the windward side, some stations registering&nbsp;160 in. a year, while on the “ dry ” side of the island not more than&nbsp;50 in. are registered. Gn the mountain heights snow falls every&nbsp;year, and ice is occasionally seen. In general the island is healthy,&nbsp;but fever is prevalent on the coast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Fauna and Flora.—</span><span class="font2">The fauna of Réunion is not very rich in variety of species. The mammals are a brown maki </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Lemur mongoz,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">Linn.) from Madagascar, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pteropus edwardsii</span><span class="font2"> now nearly extinct,&nbsp;several bats, a wild cat, the tang or tamec </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Centetes setosus,</span><span class="font2"> Denn.),&nbsp;several rats, the hare, and the goat. Among the more familiar&nbsp;birds are the “ oiseau de la vierge ” </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Muscipeta borbonica),</span><span class="font2"> the tec-tec </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Pratincola sybilla), Certhia borbonica,</span><span class="font2"> the cardinal (</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">FouAia&nbsp;madagascariensis),</span><span class="font2"> various swallows, ducks, &amp;c. The visitants&nbsp;from Madagascar, Mauritius and even India, are very numerous.&nbsp;Lizards and frogs of more than one species are common, but there&nbsp;is only one snake </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Lycodon aulicum)</span><span class="font2"> known in the island. Various&nbsp;species of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Gobius,</span><span class="font2"> a native species of mullet, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Nestis cyprinoides,&nbsp;Osphronamus olfax</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Doules rupestris</span><span class="font2"> are among the freshwater&nbsp;fishes. Turtles, formerly common, are now very rare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the forest region of the island there is a belt, 4500-5000 ft. above the sea, characterized by the prevalence of dwarf bamboo&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Bambusa alpina)·,</span><span class="font2"> and above that is a similar belt of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Acacia&nbsp;heterophylla.</span><span class="font2"> Besides this last the best timber-trees are </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Casuarina&nbsp;Iaterifolia<sub>1</sub> Foetida mauritiana, Imbricaria petiolaris, Elaeodendron&nbsp;orientale, Calophyllum spurium</span><span class="font2"> (red tacamahac), </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Terminalia borbonica, Parkia speciosa.</span><span class="font2"> The gardens of the coast districts display&nbsp;a marvellous wealth of flowers and shrubs, partly indigenous and&nbsp;partly gathered from all parts of the world. Among the indigenous&nbsp;varieties may be noted the vacoa </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Pandanus utilis)</span><span class="font2"> and the aloe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A species of coffee plant is also indigenous. Fruits grown in the island, are: the banana, thc coco-nut, bread-fruit and jack-fruit,&nbsp;thc bilimbi, the carambola, the guava, the litchi, the Japanese&nbsp;medlar, the mango-steen, the tamarind, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Abelmoschus Csculentus,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">the chirimoya, the papaya, &amp;c. Forests originally covered nearly&nbsp;the whole island; the majority of the land has been cleared by the&nbsp;inhabitants, but there are still some 200 sq. m. of forest land and the&nbsp;administration has in part replanted the higher districts, such as&nbsp;Salazie, with eucalyptus and caoutchouc trees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Inhabitants.—</span><span class="font2">The inhabitants are divided into various classes, the creoles, the mulattoes, 1 the negroes, and lndians and other&nbsp;Asiatics. The creole population is descended from the first French&nbsp;settlers, chiefly Normans and Bretons, who married Malagasy&nbsp;women. Later settlers included European women, but the presence&nbsp;of non-European blood is so common among thc creoles that the&nbsp;phrase ” Bourbon white ” was given in Mauritius to linen of doubtful cleanness. Three kinds of creoles are recognized—those of the&nbsp;towns and coasts, those of the mountains, and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">petits créoles,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">originally a dass of small farmers living in the uplands, now reduced&nbsp;to a condition of poverty and dependence on the planters. TThe&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">créoles blancs de villes,</span><span class="font2"> the typical inhabitants of the island, are in&nbsp;general of a somewhat weak physique, quick-witted and of charming&nbsp;manners, brave and very proud of their island, but not of strong&nbsp;character. The mixed races tend to approximate to a single type,&nbsp;one . in which the European strain predominates. The creole&nbsp;patois is French mixed with a considerable number of Malagasy&nbsp;and Indian words, and containing many local idioms. The population, about 35,000 towards the close ol the 18th century, was in&nbsp;1849, at the period of the liberation of the slaves, 120,000, of whom&nbsp;60,800 were newly freed negroes. Thereafter coolies were introduced from India, and in 1870 the population had increased to&nbsp;212,000.. In 1882 the government of India ceased to authorize&nbsp;the emigration of coolies to Réunion, and in consequence of that&nbsp;and other economic causes the population decreased. In 1902&nbsp;the inhabitants numbered 173,315. Of these 13,492 were British&nbsp;Indians, 4496 Malagasy, 9457 foreign-born negroes, and 1378&nbsp;Chinese. Of the native born the creoles numbered about 3000, the&nbsp;remainder being negroes or of mixed race. Among the Indian&nbsp;population the males are as three to one to the females, and the&nbsp;birth-rate is lower than the death-rate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Towns and Communication.—</span><span class="font2">St Denis, the capital </span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font2">the island, lies on the N. coast. It had in 1902 a population of 27,392. It&nbsp;is built in the form of an amphitheatre, and has several fine public&nbsp;buildings and centrally, situated botanic gardens, lt is the seat&nbsp;of a bishopric, a court of first instance and an appeal court. It&nbsp;has an abundant supply of pure water. The only anchorage for&nbsp;vessels is an open roadstead. . St Pierre (pop. 28,885), the chief&nbsp;town on the leeward side of the island, has a small artificial harbour.&nbsp;Between St Pierre and St Denis, and both on the leeward shore,&nbsp;are the towns of St Louis (pop. 12,54.1) and St Paul (pop. 19,617).&nbsp;A few miles N. ol St Paul on the S. side of Cape Pointe des Galets&nbsp;is the port of the same name, the only considerable harbour in the&nbsp;island. It. was completed in 1886 at a cost </span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font2">£2,700,000, covers&nbsp;40 acres, is well protected, and has 28 ft. of water. A railway&nbsp;serving, the port goes round the coast from St Pierre, by St Paul,&nbsp;St Denis, &amp;c., to St Benoît (a town on the E. side of the island w*ith&nbsp;a pop. of 12,523), a distance of 83I m. This line.is carried through&nbsp;a tunnel nearly 61 m. long between La Possession and St Denis.&nbsp;Besides the railway the lower parts of the island are well provided&nbsp;with roads. There is regular steamship communication between&nbsp;Pointe des Galets, Marseilles, Havre and Madagascar. Telegraphic&nbsp;communication with all parts of the world was established in 1906&nbsp;when a cable connecting Réunion with Tamatave and Mauritius&nbsp;was laid.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;text-decoration:underline;">eh</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Industries.—The Sugar Plantations.—</span><span class="font2">The area of the cultivated lands is estimated at 148,200 acres (or 230 scj. m.), of which 86,4.50&nbsp;acres are under sugar-cane, the remainder being under either maize,&nbsp;manioc, potatoes, haricots, or coffee, vanilla and cocoa. The&nbsp;sugar-cane, introduced in 1711 by Pierre Parat, is now the staple&nbsp;crop. In the 18th century the first place belonged to coffee (introduced from Arabia in 1715) and to the clove tree, brought from the&nbsp;Dutch Indies by Pqivre at the risk of his life. Both are now cultivated on a very limited scale. Vanilla, introduced in 1818, was not&nbsp;extensively cultivated till about 1850. Bourbon vanilla, as it is&nbsp;called, is of high character, and next to sugar is the most important&nbsp;article Of cultivation in the island. There are small plantations&nbsp;of cocoa and cinchona; cotton-growing was tried, but proved unsuccessful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The sugar industry has suffered greatly from the competition with beet sugar and the effects of bounties, also from the scarcity&nbsp;of labour, from the ravages of the phylloxera (which made its&nbsp;appearance in 1878) and from extravagant methods of manufacture. It was not until 1906 that steps were taken for the creation&nbsp;of central sugar mills and refineries, in consequence of the compulsory shutting down of many small mills. Rum is largely distilled and forms an important article, of export. There are also&nbsp;manufactories for the making of geranium essence, St Pierre being&nbsp;thc centre of this industry. Other articles exported are aloe fibre&nbsp;and vacoa casks. The mineral wealth of the island has not been</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
