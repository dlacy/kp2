<p><span class="font1">ROLLOCK, Robert (1555-1599), the first principal of the university of Edinburgh, was the son of David Rollock&nbsp;of Powis near Stirling, and was born in 1555. He received&nbsp;his early education at the school of Stirling from Thomas&nbsp;Buchanan, a nephew of George Buchanan, and after&nbsp;graduating at St Andrews became regent of philosophy&nbsp;there in 1580. In 1583 he was appointed by the Edinburgh town council sole “ regent ” of the “ town’s college ”&nbsp;(“Academia Jacobi Sexti”), and three years later he&nbsp;received from the same source the title of “ principal or&nbsp;first master,” and also, with consent of the presbytery,&nbsp;professor of theology. From 1587 he also preached&nbsp;regularly to large audiences every Sunday morning at 7&nbsp;A.M., and ultimately, yielding to urgent entreaties, he&nbsp;accepted “ the full burden of one of the eight ministers of&nbsp;the city.” He took a prominent part in the somewhat&nbsp;troubled church politics of the day, and distinguished&nbsp;himself among his compeers by gentleness and tact, as&nbsp;well as ability. In 1593 he was appointed, along with&nbsp;some others, by parliament to confer with the popish lords,&nbsp;and in 1597 it was through his mediation with the king&nbsp;that the ministers of Edinburgh, banished in consequence&nbsp;of a “tumult” in December 1596, were permitted to&nbsp;return. For his eminent services he was chosen moderator&nbsp;of the General Assembly held at Dundee in May 1597.&nbsp;His death took place at Edinburgh on 8th February 1599.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">ROLLS, Master of the, is the third member of the Supreme Court of Judicature in England, the lord chancellor, president of the Chancery Division, being the first and&nbsp;the lord chief justice, president of the Queen’s Bench&nbsp;Division, being the second. At first he was the principal&nbsp;clerk of the Chancery and as such had charge of the&nbsp;records of the court, especially of the register of original&nbsp;writs and of all patents and grants under the great seal.&nbsp;Until the end of the 15th century he was called either&nbsp;the clerk or the keeper of the rolls, and he is still formally&nbsp;designated as the master or keeper of the rolls. The&nbsp;earliest mention of him as master of the rolls is in 11 Hen.&nbsp;VII. c. 18 ; and in 11 Hen. VII. c. 24 he is again described&nbsp;as clerk of the rolls, showing that his official designation&nbsp;still remained unsettled. About the same period, however,&nbsp;the chief clerks of the Chancery came to be called masters&nbsp;in Chancery and the clerk, master, or keeper of the rolls&nbsp;was always the first among them whichever name they&nbsp;bore. In course of time, from causes which are not very&nbsp;easy to trace, his original functions as keeper of the records&nbsp;passed away from him and he gradually assumed a jurisdiction in the Court of Chancery second only to that of&nbsp;the lord chancellor himself. In the beginning he only&nbsp;heard causes in conjunction with the other masters in&nbsp;Chancery and his decrees were invalid until they had&nbsp;been approved and signed by the lord chancellor. But&nbsp;later on he heard causes without assistance and his decrees&nbsp;held good until they were reversed on petition either to&nbsp;the lord chancellor or afterwards to the lords justices of&nbsp;appeal (15 and 16 Viet. c. 83). Before any judge with&nbsp;the formal title of vice-chancellor was appointed the master&nbsp;of the rolls was often spoken of as vice-chancellor. By 1&nbsp;and 2 Viet. c. 94 the custody of the records was restored&nbsp;to him, and he is chairman of the State Papers and&nbsp;Historical Manuscripts Commissions. Under 38 and 39</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Viet. c. 77 and 39 and 40 Viet. c. 59 he now always sits with the lords justices in the Court of Appeal, whose&nbsp;decisions can be questioned only in the House of Lords.&nbsp;The master of the rolls was formerly eligible to a seat in&nbsp;the House of Commons,—a privilege enjoyed by no other&nbsp;member of the judicial bench ; but he was deprived of it&nbsp;by the Supreme Court of Judicature Act of 1873 (36 and&nbsp;37 Viet. c. 66), which provides that all judges of the High&nbsp;Court of Justice and the Court of Appeal shall be incapable of being elected to or sitting in the House of Commons. The master of the rolls is always sworn of the privy&nbsp;council.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH, the name generally given to that very numerous body of Christians who acknowledge the pope, or bishop of Rome, as head of their&nbsp;church. This name also signifies that the Roman Catholic&nbsp;Church is “ Roman in its centre and catholic in its circumference.” The number of Catholics throughout the world&nbsp;is variously estimated, some statisticians placing it as low&nbsp;as 152,000,000, others at 213,518,000, and others at&nbsp;218,000,000. The author of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Katholischer Missions-Atlas</span><span class="font1"> (Rev. O. Werner, S.J.), largely furnished with Propaganda returns, distributes them as follows :—in Europe,&nbsp;150,684,050; in Asia, 8,311,800; in Africa, 2,656,205;&nbsp;in both Americas, 51,422,566 ; in Australia and adjacent&nbsp;islands, 443,442; total, 213,518,063. But he considers&nbsp;that this calculation gives less than the whole number of&nbsp;Catholics throughout the world, and adds nearly a million&nbsp;more, making the total 214,370,000. Dr Hugo Franz&nbsp;Brachelli, superior of the Austrian Statistical Department,&nbsp;in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Die Staaten Europα<sup>,</sup>s</span><span class="font1"> for 1884, gives the number of&nbsp;Catholics in Europe as 155,900,000, distributed mainly&nbsp;as follows :—</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">The supreme pontiff, who traces his succession from St Peter (see Popedom), is regarded by Catholics as “ vicar&nbsp;of Christ, head of the bishops, and supreme governor of&nbsp;the whole Catholic Church, of whom the whole world is&nbsp;the territory or diocese.” He is also patriarch of the&nbsp;West, bishop of Rome and its district, and temporal prince&nbsp;over the states of the church known as the Pontifical&nbsp;States—though the exercise of the last prerogative has&nbsp;been in abeyance since the events of 1859 and 1870.&nbsp;The pope has a primacy or supremacy, not only of honour&nbsp;but of power, authority, and immediate jurisdiction, over&nbsp;the universal church. When he is canonically elected,&nbsp;and has given his consent to the election, he possesses,&nbsp;without any other confirmation, authority over the whole&nbsp;church, even though at his election he may not have been&nbsp;either bishop, priest, deacon, or subdeacon, but a simple&nbsp;layman. In the early ages of the church subdeacons were&nbsp;occasionally elected, deacons more frequently, and bishops&nbsp;rarely. In the 11th century Gregory VII., previously&nbsp;known as the deacon Hildebrand, was ordained priest after&nbsp;his election and consecrated bishop later. The first pope&nbsp;invested with the episcopal dignity prior to his election&nbsp;to the pontificate was Formosus, bishop of Porto, elected</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
