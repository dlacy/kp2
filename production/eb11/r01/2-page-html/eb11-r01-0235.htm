<p><span class="font2">Their first minister was Jonas Michaelius, pastor in New Amsterdam of the “ church in the fort ” (now the Collegiate&nbsp;Church of New York City). The second </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">domine,</span><span class="font2"> Everardus&nbsp;Bogardus (d. 1647), migrated to New York in 1633 with Governor&nbsp; Wouter van Twiller, with whom he quarrelled continually;&nbsp;in the same year a wooden church “ in the fort ” was built; and&nbsp;in 1642 it was succeeded by a stone building. A minister,&nbsp;John van Mekelenburg (Johannes Megapolensis) migrated to&nbsp;Rensselaerwyck manor in 1642, preached to the Indians—&nbsp;probably before any other Protestant minister—and after 1649&nbsp;was settled in New Amsterdam. With the access of English&nbsp;and French settlers, Samuel Drisius, who preached in Dutch,&nbsp;German, English and French, was summoned, and he laboured&nbsp;in New Amsterdam and New York from 1652 to 1673. On Long&nbsp;Island John T. Polhemus preached at Flatbush in 1654-76.&nbsp;During Peter Stuyvesant’s governorship there was little toleration&nbsp;of other denominations, but the West India Company reversed&nbsp;his intolerant proclamations against Lutherans and Quakers.&nbsp;About 1659 a French and Dutch church was organized in&nbsp;Harlem. The first church in New Jersey, at Bergen, in 1661,&nbsp;was quickly followed by others at Hackensack and Passaic.&nbsp;After English rule in 1664 displaced Dutch in New York, the&nbsp;relations of the Dutch churches there were much less close with&nbsp;the state Church of Holland; and in 1679 (on the request of&nbsp;the English governor of New York, to whom the people of&nbsp;New Castle appealed) a classis was constituted for the ordination&nbsp;of a pastor for the church in New Castle, Delaware. The Dutch&nbsp;strongly opposed the establishment of the Church of England,&nbsp;and contributed largely toward the adoption (in October 1683)&nbsp;of the Charter of Liberties which confirmed in their privileges&nbsp;all churches then “ in practice ” in the city of New York and&nbsp;elsewhere in the province, but which was repealed by James II.&nbsp;in 1686, when he established the Church of England in New&nbsp;York but allowed religious liberty to the Dutch and others.&nbsp;The Dutch ministers stood by James’s government during&nbsp;Leisler’s rebellion. Under William III., Governors Sloughter&nbsp;and Fletcher worked for a law (passed in 1693 and approved&nbsp;in 1697) for the settling of a ministry in New York, Richmond,&nbsp;Westchester and Queen's counties; but the Assembly foiled&nbsp;Fletcher’s purpose of establishing a Church of England clergy,&nbsp;although he attempted to construe the act as applying only to&nbsp;the English Church. In 1696 the first church charter in New&nbsp;York was granted to the Reformed Protestant Dutch Church&nbsp;(now the Collegiate Church) of New York City; at this time&nbsp;there were Dutch ministers at Albany and Kingston, on Long&nbsp;Island and in New Jersey; and for years the Dutch and English&nbsp;(Episcopalian) churches alone received charters in New York&nbsp;and New Jersey—the Dutch church being treated practically&nbsp;as an establishment—and the church of the fort and Trinity&nbsp;(Episcopalian; chartered 1697) were fraternally harmonious.&nbsp;In 1700 there were twenty-nine Reformed Dutch churches out&nbsp;of a total of fifty in New York. During the administration&nbsp;of Governor Edward Hyde, Lord Cornbury, many members&nbsp;joined the Episcopal Church and others removed to New Jersey.&nbsp;The Great Awakening crowned the efforts of Theodore J.&nbsp;Frelinghuysen, who had come over as a Dutch pastor in 1720&nbsp;and had opposed formalism and preached a revival. The&nbsp;Church in America in 1738 asked the Classis of Amsterdam (to&nbsp;whose care it had been transferred from the West India Company) for the privilege of forming a Coetus or Association with&nbsp;power to ordain in America; the Classis, after trying to join&nbsp;the Dutch with the English Presbyterian churches, granted&nbsp;(1747) a Coetus first to the German and then to the Dutch&nbsp;churches, which therefore in September 1754 organized them selves&nbsp; into a classis. This action was opposed by the church&nbsp;of New York City, and partly through this difference and&nbsp;partly because of quarrels over the denominational control&nbsp;of King’s College (now Columbia), five members of the Coetus&nbsp;seceded, and as the president of the Coetus was one of them&nbsp;they took the records with them; they were called the Conferentie; they organized independently in 1764 and carried on&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">a </span><span class="font2">bitter warfare with the Coctus (now more properly called&nbsp;the American Classis), which in 1766 (and again in 1770) obtained&nbsp;a charter for Queen’s (now Rutgers) College at New Brunswick.&nbsp;But in </span><span class="font1">1771-72 </span><span class="font2">through the efforts of John H. Livingston&nbsp;(1746-1825), who had become pastor of the New York City church&nbsp;in 1770, on the basis of a plan drafted by the Classis of Amsterdam&nbsp; Coetus and Conferentie were reunited with a substantial&nbsp;independence of Amsterdam, which was made complete in&nbsp;1792 when the Synod (the nomenclature of synod and classis&nbsp;had been adopted upon the declaration of American Independence&nbsp;) adopted a translation of the eighty-four Articles of Dort&nbsp;on Church Order with seventy-three “explanatory articles.”@@<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>In 1800 there were about forty ministers and one hundred&nbsp;churches. In 1819 the Church was incorporated as the Re-formed Protestant Dutch Church; and in 1867 the name was&nbsp;changed to the Reformed Church in America. Preaching in&nbsp;Dutch had nearly ceased in 1820, but about 1846 a new Dutch&nbsp;immigration began, especially in Michigan, and fifty years later&nbsp;Dutch preaching was common in nearly one-third of the churches&nbsp;of the country, only to disappear almost entirely in the next&nbsp;decade. Union with other Reformed churches was planned&nbsp;in 1743, in 1784, in 1816-20, 1873-78 and 1886, but unsuccessfully; however, ministers go from one to another charge&nbsp;in the Dutch and German Reformed, Presbyterian, and to a less&nbsp;degree Congregational churches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A conservative secession “ on account of Hopkinsian errors ” in 1822 of six ministers (five then under suspension) organized&nbsp;a General Synod and the classes of Hackensack and Union&nbsp;(central New York) in 1824; it united with the Christian Re-</span><span class="font1">formed </span><span class="font2">Church, established by immigrants from Holland after&nbsp;1835, to which there was added a fresh American secession&nbsp;in 1882 due to opposition (on the part of the seceders) to secret&nbsp;societies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The organization of the Church is: a General Synod (1794); the (particular) synods of New York (1800), Albany (1800), Chicago&nbsp;(1856) and New Brunswick (1869) ; classes, corresponding to the&nbsp;presbyteries of other Calvinistic bodies; and the churches, numbering, in 1906, 659. The agencies of the Church are: the Board&nbsp;of Education, privately organized in 1828 and adopted by the&nbsp;General Synod in 1831; a Widows’ Fund (1837) and a Disabled&nbsp;Ministers’ Fund; a Board of Publication (1855); a Board of&nbsp;Domestic Missions (1831; reorganized 1849) with a Church Building&nbsp;Fund and a Woman’s Executive Committee; a Board of Foreign&nbsp;Missions (1832) succeeding the United Missionary Society (1816),&nbsp;which included Presbyterian, Dutch Reformed and Associate Re-formed Churches, and which was merged (1826) in the American&nbsp;Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, from which the&nbsp;Dutch Church did not entirely separate itself until 1857; and a&nbsp;Woman’s Board of Foreign Missions (1875). The principal missions&nbsp;are in India at Arcot (1854; transferred in 1902 to the Synod of&nbsp;S. India) and at Amoy in China (1842) ; and the work of the Church&nbsp;in Japan was very successful, especially under Guido Fridolin&nbsp;Verbeck@@<sup>2</sup> (1830-1898), and 1877 native churches built up by Presbyterian and Dutch Reformed missionaries were organized as the&nbsp;United Church of our Lord Jesus Christ in Japan. There is also&nbsp;an Arabian mission, begun privately in 1888 and transferred to the&nbsp;Board in 1894.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The colleges and institutions of learning connected with the Church are: Rutgers, already mentioned; Union College (1795), the outgrowth of Schenectady Academy, founded in 1785 by Dirck Romeyn,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">a </span><span class="font1">Dutch minister; Hope College (1866; coeducational) at Holland,&nbsp;Michigan, originally a parochial school (1850) and then (1855)&nbsp;Holland Academy; the Theological Seminary at New Brunswick&nbsp;(</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">q.v.</span><span class="font1">); and the Western Theological Seminary (1869) at Holland,&nbsp;Michigan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In 1906 (according to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin 103</span><span class="font1"> (1909) of the Bureau of the U.S. Census) there were 659 organizations with 773 church edifices&nbsp;reported and the total membership was 124,938. More than one-half of this total membership (63,350) was in New York state, the&nbsp;'principal home of the first great Dutch immigration; more than&nbsp;one-quarter (32,290) was in New Jersey; and the other states were:&nbsp;Michigan (11,260), Illinois (4962), Iowa (4835), Wisconsin (2312),&nbsp;and Pennsylvania </span><span class="font0">(1979). </span><span class="font1">The Church was also represented in Minnesota, S. Dakota, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Indiana, Ohio, Kansas,&nbsp;N. Dakota, S. Carolina, Washington and Maryland—the order&nbsp;being that of rank in number of communicants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Christian Reformed Church, an “ old school ” secession, had in 1906, 174 organizations, 181 churches and a membership of 26,669,</span></p>
