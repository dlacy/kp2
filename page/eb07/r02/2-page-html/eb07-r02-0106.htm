<p><span class="font0">ture ; and the cynical hardihood with which she paints scenes from which any woman would turn aside, is perhaps&nbsp;the very worst proof which French literature at present&nbsp;presents of a degraded standard of delicacy and right feel-mg among the female sex, we cannot deny that she appears&nbsp;to us to possess far greater talent, even genius, though misdirected, than any ofthe other ephemeral novelists to which&nbsp;we have alluded. In particular, she has an imagination singularly alive to natural beauty ; her pictures of scenery are&nbsp;frequently captivating; and one evening landscapeof Venice,&nbsp;in her </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lettres Venetiennes,</span><span class="font0"> has the combined charm of deep&nbsp;sensibility and truth. By far the most pleasing of her novels, because it in a great measure keeps in tlle background&nbsp;her peculiar opinions, is </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">André.</span><span class="font0"> And yet even the general&nbsp;purity and right feeling of the tale is marred and interrupted by some passages which English readers at least would&nbsp;wish to blot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The field of the novel or romance is not that which has been cultivated in Germany with the most success. The&nbsp;labourers indeed have been many, the produce most abundant, but the quality of the harvest is at best equivocal.&nbsp;Down to the time of Goethe and Tieck, the German literature of fiction was almost entirely imitative, deriving both&nbsp;its form and spirit from other nations. Since their time, if&nbsp;it presents a greater air of originality, it has generally assumed a character so fantastic, so unreal, so unlike all that&nbsp;we have been accustomed to associate with the idea of a&nbsp;novel, that it is extremely difficult to comprehend what is&nbsp;really the conception of the word entertained in Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As we have no very high idea of the German prose fictions, the space which we propose to devote to them&nbsp;will be extremely limited ; for we shall confine ourselves&nbsp;to a mere indication of the successive phases which the&nbsp;German romance has presented. In doing so, it seems&nbsp;unnecessary to go back beyond the latter portion of the&nbsp;eighteenth century, or to revive the names of w<sup>,</sup>orks and&nbsp;authors which even the Germans themselves have forgotten, The earlier part of the eighteenth century had been&nbsp;occupied with numerous imitations of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Robinson Cmsοe&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">of Defoe, or of the family pictures of Richardson, the merits of which are not of a nature to demand notice in the&nbsp;present sketch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the Greek romances of Wieland, (1763—1812), such as the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Agathon,</span><span class="font0"> the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Aristippus, Peregrinus Proteus,</span><span class="font0"> and&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Agαthodiimoη,</span><span class="font0"> the same didactic tendency is observable&nbsp;which distinguishes those of Voltaire, but without their cy-nyical and mocking tone, and with a much greater power,&nbsp;if not of actually inventing character, at least of working&nbsp;up the scanty materials furnished by history into a consistent and plausible portrait of the historical personages of&nbsp;antiquity; as in his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Socrates,</span><span class="font0"> and still more perhaps in his&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Aristippus.</span><span class="font0"> The main fault of his novels, besides this didactic tone, which pervades them all, is the frequent repetitions which they contain of the same views and personages. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Agathon</span><span class="font0"> in one manner, and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Abderites</span><span class="font0"> in the&nbsp;other, contain the germ of almost all Wieland’s other writings. The sceptical Hippias, for instance, only puts off’ the&nbsp;Athenian stole in Agathon, to assume the mantle of tlle&nbsp;Calendar ; the Danæ of that novel revives again in Theo-clea and Devidassi ; the youth of Athagon, in Delphi, is&nbsp;the prototype of that of Peregrinus in Parium ; and many&nbsp;such instances must occur to any one familiar with Wieland. He is a mannerist, in short, as to his matter, and the&nbsp;mannerism extends even to his style, which, though flowing&nbsp;and facile, has not a little of the solemn loquacity of Boc-</span><span class="font1">c </span><span class="font0">lccio. This diffuseness is less felt in his shorter tales, where&nbsp;his philosophy is not so obtrusively displayed ; and for this&nbsp;reason we prefer hisZ&gt;on </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sylvia de Rοsαlvα,—</span><span class="font0">the history of&nbsp;a quixotic believer in fairyism, gradually converted to common sense by the extravagant demands which are made&nbsp;upon his belief, assisted by the charms of a mortal beauty,—&nbsp;and his little romance of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Salamander and the Statue,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">to his more elaborate and aspiring compositions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The influence of the novels of Richardson and of Fielding reappears about this time in a liberal effusion of family novels, some pourtraying the serious and sentimental, others&nbsp;the comic aspect of domestic life. Among the sentimental&nbsp;novelists, Augustus La Fontaine (1758—1831) may be considered as the most successful, and undoubtedly the most&nbsp;popular. He painted life as he had seen it iii the little&nbsp;German towns, villages, and chateaux of respectable proprietors about him, or as he had witnessed it during his campaigns as army chaplain, without ornament or alteration,&nbsp;without any pretension to imagination ; and though there&nbsp;is at times something vulgar and tawdry in his sentimentalism, there is also a great deal of quiet simple nature in such&nbsp;scenes of common life and domestic happiness as he has exhibited in his family of Haller ; and a tone of frankness and&nbsp;good humour, which carries the reader pleasingly along&nbsp;through incidents and characters that in themselves are&nbsp;common-place enough.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The comedy of family life found numerous representatives, of whom Wetzel, Müller, Schulz, and Hippel, attracted some notice in their day and generation. Even yet the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Siegfried von Lindenberg</span><span class="font0"> of Müller, which appeared&nbsp;about 1779, and of which many editions have appeared, may&nbsp;be admitted to be a natural and amusing performance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A union of the sentimental with the comic in these domestic pictures was attempted at a somewhat later date in thc very singular novels of Richter, (1763—1825), a man&nbsp;of high powers, which he knew not how to use. and which&nbsp;were alloyed in no common degree by false taste, and an incurable affectation of singularity. His earliest novel, the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Gronlαndische Processe,</span><span class="font0"> appeared in 1784. The tricks and&nbsp;claptraps to which Sterne occasionally descends, we find&nbsp;habitual with Richter. The very titles of some of his works,&nbsp;such as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Selections from the Papers ofthe Devil, or Recreations under the Cranium of α Giantess,</span><span class="font0"> and the absurd devices by which he generally introduces his narration, as in&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hesperus,</span><span class="font0"> where a series of letters is represented as&nbsp;mysteriously conveyed to the author in letter-bags tied&nbsp;round the neck of a shock-dog, betray a mind anxious&nbsp;to astonish by fantastic conceits, and insensible to the&nbsp;beauty of simplicity. The constant recurrence of these instances of literary quackery, the want of connexion which&nbsp;his chaotic narrations exhibit, combined with the visionary&nbsp;cast of his views, justifying his own remark, that the empire of the Germans was peculiarly that of the air, has been&nbsp;fatal, and we think justly, to all attempts to naturalize Richter in this country. His pathos we think in the worst style&nbsp;of false, and often meaningless, effusions of sentimentality ;&nbsp;but as a quiet humourist, blending good feeling with his&nbsp;satire, he is often very successful. In this respect we admit the truth of the observations of Mr. Carlyle, from whose&nbsp;estimate of Richter’s genius we in other respects fundamentally differ : “ It is on the strength of this, and its accompanying endowments, that his main success as an artist depends. His favourite characters have always a dash of the&nbsp;ridiculous in their circumstances, in their composition, perhaps in both. They are often men of no account, vain, poor,&nbsp;ignorant, feeble ; and we scarcely know how it is that we&nbsp;love them ; for the author all along has been laughing no&nbsp;less heartily than we at their ineptitudes. Yet so it is; his&nbsp;Fibel, his Fixlein, his Siebenkâs, even his Schmelzle, insinuate themselves into our affections ; and their ultimate&nbsp;place is closer to our hearts than that of many more splendid heroes. This is tlle test of true humour ; no wit, no&nbsp;sarcasm, no knowledge, will suffice ; not talent, but genius,&nbsp;will accomplish the result.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A strong contrast to these pictures of ordinary life, whether serious or comic, was presented by the mass of roman-</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
