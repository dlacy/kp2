a kind of glaſs of a dark blue colour, which when levigated appears of a moſt beautiful colour ; and if it could be made ſufficiently fine, would be an excellent ſuccedaneum for ultramarine, as not only reſiſting all kinds of weathcr, but even the moſt violent fires. It is prepared by melting one part of calcined cobalt with two of flint powder, and one of pot-aſh.<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0548.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s04-0542"/>
At the bottoms of the crucibles in which the ſmalt is manufactured we generally find a regulus of a whitiſh colour inclining to red, and extremely brittle. This is melted afreſh, and when cold ſeparates into two parts ; that at the bottom is the cobaltic regulus, which is employed to make more of the ſmalt ; the other is biſmuth.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
