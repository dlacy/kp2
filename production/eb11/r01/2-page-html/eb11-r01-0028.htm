<p><span class="font0">indicates, moreover, that the true absorption bands in a gas of sufficiently low density must be extremely narrow. There&nbsp;is direct evidence that many of the more permanent gases do&nbsp;not sensibly emit light on being subjected to high temperature&nbsp;alone, when chemical action is excluded, while others give&nbsp;in these circumstances feeble continuous spectra; in fact,&nbsp;looking at the matter from the other side, the more permanent&nbsp;gases are very transparent to most kinds of radiation, and&nbsp;therefore must be very bad radiators as regards those kinds.&nbsp;The dark radiation of flames has been identified with that&nbsp;belonging to the specific radiation of their gaseous products&nbsp;of combustion. There is thus ground for the view that the&nbsp;impacts of the colliding molecules in a gas, or rather their&nbsp;mutual actions as they swing sharply round each other in&nbsp;their orbits during an encounter, may not be sufficiently violent&nbsp;to excite sensibly the free vibrations of the definite periods&nbsp;belonging to the molecules. But they may produce radiation&nbsp;in other ways. While the velocity of an electron or other&nbsp;electric charge is being altered, it necessarily sends out a stream&nbsp;of radiation. Now the orbital motions of the electrons in an&nbsp;actual molecule must be so adjusted, as appears to be theoretically possible, that it does not emit radiation when in a&nbsp;steady state and moving with constant velocity. But in the&nbsp;violent changes of velocity that occur during an encounter&nbsp;this equipoise will be disturbed, and a stream of radiation,&nbsp;without definite periods, but such as might constitute its share&nbsp;of the equilibrium thermal radiation of the substance, may be&nbsp;expected while the encounter lasts. At very high temperatures&nbsp;the energy of this thermal radiation in an enclosure entirely&nbsp;overpowers the kinetic energy of the molecules present, for the&nbsp;former varies as T <sup>4</sup>, while the latter measures T itself when&nbsp;the number of molecules remains the same. The radiation&nbsp;which can be excited in gases, confined as it is to extremely&nbsp;narrow bands in the spectrum, may indeed be expected to&nbsp;possess such intensity as to be thermally in equilibrium with&nbsp;extremely high temperatures. That the same gases absorb&nbsp;such radiations when comparatively cold and dark does not,&nbsp;of course, affect the case, because emissive and absorptive&nbsp;powers are proportional only for incident radiations of the&nbsp;intensity and type corresponding to the temperature of the&nbsp;body. Thus if our adiabatic enclosure of § 3 is prolonged into&nbsp;a tube of unlimited length which is filled with the gas, then&nbsp;when the temperature has become uniform that gas must send&nbsp;back out of the tube as much radiation as has passed down the&nbsp;tube and been absorbed by it; but if the tube is maintained&nbsp;at a lower temperature, it may return much less. The fact&nbsp;that it is now possible by great optical dispersion to make the&nbsp;line-spectra of prominences in the middle of the Sun’s disk&nbsp;stand out bright against the background of the continuous&nbsp;solar spectrum, shows that the intensities of the radiations of&nbsp;these prominences correspond to a much higher temperature&nbsp;than that of the general radiating layer underneath them;&nbsp;their luminosity would thus seem to be due to some cause&nbsp;(electric or chemical) other than mere temperature. On the&nbsp;other hand, the general reversing gaseous layer which originates&nbsp;the dark Fraunhofer lines is at a lower temperature than the&nbsp;radiating layer; it is only when the light from the lower layers&nbsp;is eclipsed that its own direct bright-line spectrum flashes out.&nbsp;It is not necessary to attribute this selective flash-spectrum to&nbsp;temperature radiation; it can very well be ascribed to fluor-escence stimulated by the intense illumination from beneath.&nbsp;When the radiation in a spectrum is constituted of wide&nbsp;bands it may on these principles be expected to be in equilibrium with a lower temperature than when it is constituted&nbsp;of narrow fines, if the total intensity is the same in the cases&nbsp;compared; this is in keeping with the easier excitation of&nbsp;band spectra (cf. the banded absorption spectra), and with the&nbsp;fact that various gases and vapours do appear to emit band&nbsp;spectra more or less related to the temperature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">15. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Constitution of Spectra. —</span><span class="font0">In the problem of the unravelling&nbsp;of the constitutions of the very complex systems of spectral&nbsp;lines belonging to the various kinds of matter, considerable&nbsp;progress has been made in recent years. The beginning of&nbsp;definite knowledge was the discovery of Balmer in 1885, that&nbsp;the frequencies of vibration (n) of the hydrogen lines could&nbsp;be represented, very closely and within the limits of error of&nbsp;observation, by the formula </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">n</span><span class="font0"> ∝ 1 - 4</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">m</span><span class="font0"><sup>-2</sup>, when for </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">m</span><span class="font0"> is substituted the series of natural numbers 3, 4, 5,... 15. Soon&nbsp;afterwards series of related lines were picked out from the&nbsp;spectra of other elements by Liveing and Dewar. Rydberg&nbsp;conducted a systematic investigation on the basis of a modification of Balmer’s law for hydrogen, namely, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">n</span><span class="font0">=</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">n<sub>0</sub></span><span class="font0">-N ∕ (</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">m</span><span class="font0">+μ)<sup>2</sup>.&nbsp;He found that in the group of alkaline metals three series of&nbsp;lines exist, the so-called principal and two subordinate series,&nbsp;whose frequencies fit approximately into this formula, and&nbsp;that similar statements apply to other natural groups of elements; that the constant N is sensibly the same for all series&nbsp;and all substances, while </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">n<sub>o</sub></span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">μ</span><span class="font0"> have different values for&nbsp;each; and that other approximate numerical relations exist.&nbsp;In each series the lines of high frequency crowd together towards a definite limit on the more refrangible side; near this&nbsp;limit they would, if visible, constitute a band. The principal&nbsp;or strongest series of lines shows reversal very readily. The&nbsp;lines of the first subordinate series are usually nebular, while&nbsp;those of the second subordinate or weakest series are sharp;&nbsp;but with a tendency to broaden towards the less refrangible&nbsp;side. In most series there are, however, not more than six&nbsp;lines visible: helium and hydrogen are exceptions, no fewer&nbsp;than thirty lines of the principal series of the latter having&nbsp;been identified, the higher ones in stellar spectra only. But&nbsp;very remarkable progress has recently been made by R. W.&nbsp;Wood, by exciting fluorescent spectra in a metallic vapour,&nbsp;and also by applying a magnetic field to restore the lines sensitive&nbsp;to the Zeeman effect after the spectrum has been cut off by&nbsp;crossed nicols. The large aggregates of lines thus definitely&nbsp;revealed are also resolved by him into systems in other ways; when the stimulating light is confined to one period, say a&nbsp;single bright line of another substance, the spectrum excited&nbsp;consists of a limited number of lines equidistant in frequency,&nbsp;the interval common to all being presumably the frequency of&nbsp;some intrinsic orbital motion of the molecule. In this way the&nbsp;series belonging to some of the alkali metals have been obtained&nbsp;nearly complete.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Simultaneously with Rydberg, the problem of series was attacked by Kayser and Runge, who, in reducing their extensive&nbsp;standard observations, used the formula </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">n</span><span class="font0">=A+B</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">m<sup>-</sup></span><span class="font0">+C</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">m</span><span class="font0"><sup>-4</sup>,&nbsp;higher terms in this descending series being presumed to be&nbsp;negligible. This cannot be reconciled with Rydberg’s form,&nbsp;which gives on expansion terms involving </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">m</span><span class="font0"><sup>-3</sup>; but for the&nbsp;higher values of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">m</span><span class="font0"> the discrepancies rapidly diminish, and do&nbsp;not prevent the picking out of the lines, the frequency-differences&nbsp;between successive lines then varying roughly as the inverse&nbsp;squares of the series of natural numbers. For low values of&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">m</span><span class="font0"> neither mode of expression is applicable, as was to be ex-pected; and it remains a problem for the future to ascertain&nbsp;if possible the rational formula to which they are approximations. More complex formulas have been suggested by Ritz&nbsp;and others, partly on theoretical grounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Considered dynamically, the question is that of the deter-mination of the formula for the disturbed motions of the system which constitutes the molecule. Although we are still far from&nbsp;any definite line of attack, there are various indications that&nbsp;the quest is a practicable one. The lines of each series, sorted&nbsp;out by aid of the formulae above given, have properties in&nbsp;common: they are usually multiple lines, either all doublets&nbsp;in the case of monad elements, or generally triplets in the case&nbsp;of those of higher chemical valency; in very few cases are the&nbsp;series constituted of single lines. It is found also that the&nbsp;components of all the double or triple lines of a subordinate&nbsp;series are equidistant as regards frequency. In the case of a&nbsp;related group of elements, for example the alkaline metals,&nbsp;it appears that corresponding series are displaced continually&nbsp;towards the less refrangible end as the atomic weight rises; it&nbsp;is found also that the interval in frequency between the double</span></p>
