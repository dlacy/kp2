once a celebrated city of Sicily, and the capital of the island. It was built, according to Thucydides and Strabo, by Archias, one of the Heraclidæ, who came from Corinth into Sicily in the ſecond year of the 11th Olympiad, deriving its name from a neighbouring marſh named <hi rend="italic">Syraco.</hi> What form of government firſt prevailed in the city is not known. Many have suppoſed it originally to have been governed by kings : but if this was the case, the monarchical government muſt have continued only for a very ſhort time ; ſince Aristotle, Diodorus Siculus, and Juſtin, mention it as being very early ſubject to a democracy. The hiſtory, however, is obſcure and unimportant till the time of Gelon, when it firſt began to make a conſpicuous figure.</p><p>Gelon was born in the city of Gela in Sicily, of the family of Telines, who had been created prieſt of the infernal gods. He ſignalized himſelf in a war carried on by Hippocrates tyrant of Gela againſt the Syracuſians, whom he defeated in a pitched battle, and had well nigh taken their city afterwards. Having thus become very powerful among his countrymen, he ſoon found means to ſeize on the ſovereignty for himſelf. In a ſhort time, having put himſelf at the head of ſome Syracuſian exiles, he marched towards that place, where he was received with loud acclammations by the section to which they belonged ; and by their means obtained poſſeſſion of the city.</p><p>Gelon, in order to people the capital of his new dominions, firſt demoliſhed the neighbouring city of Camarina, and tranſplanted the inhabitants to Syracuſe. Soon after, entering into a war with the Megareans, he defeated them, took and raſed their cities, and in like manner tranſplanted the people. Syracuſe thus became very powerful, and full of inhabitants ; and the friendſhip of Gelon was courted both by Athens and Lacedraemon at the time of the Perſian in vaſion. His aſſistance, however, was afterwards rejected, as he insisted upon being made commander in chief either of the fleet or the army. In the mean time the Carthaginians had entered into a treaty with the Persians ; by which it was agreed, that the former ſhould attack thoſe of the Greek name in Sicily and Italy, in order to divert them from aſſiſting one another. Sicily was accordingly invaded by the Carthaginians with a vaſt army; but they were utterly overthrown by Gelon, as is related under the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Carthage,</hi> n⁰ 7 — 9. After this victory, the people out of gratitude obliged him to take upon himſelf the title of king ; which till that time he had refuſed. A decree alſo passed without oppoſition, by which the crown was settled on his two brothers Hiero and Thraſybulus after his death.</p><p>The new king, inſtead of keeping his ſubjects in greater awe, ſtudied the more to make them happy as he found his power increaſed ; and, according to Diodorus Siculus, was the firſt man who became more virtuous by being raiſed to a throne. He was particularly famous for his honeſty, truth, and ſincerity ; is ſaid never to have wronged the meaneſt of his ſubjects, nor ever to thave promiſed a thing which he did not perform.</p><p>Gelon died in the year 471 B. C. after having reigned three or four years; and was ſucceeded by his brother Hiero, whoſe character is differently drawn by different historians. He was twice en and in a war with the Agrigentines, and drove from their habitations the people of Catana and Naxus, settling in their room a colony of Syracuſians and Peloponneſians. He is highly celebrated in the odes of Pindar ; and it is certain that His court was the reſort of men of wit and learning, to whom he behaved in the moſt courteous manner and with the greateſt liberality.</p><p>In 459 B C. Hiero was ſucceeded by Thraſybulus ; who proving a tyrant, was in ten months driven out, and a popular government reſtored ; which continued for the space of 55 years. Several persons continued for ſome time to aſpire at the ſovereign power ; and to rid themſelves of theſe aſpiring geniuſes, the inhabitants made a law not unlike that of the oſtraciſm at Athens. By this law they were to write on a leaf the names of thoſe whom they supposed to be powerful enough to aſpire at the crown ; and when the leaves were counted, he who had the moſt suffrages againſt him was, without further inquiry, banished for five years. This method of weakening the intereſts of the overgrown citizens was called <hi rend="italic">petalism,</hi> from the Greek word πεταλον, signifying a leaf ; but being found to be productive of great inconveniences, by driving out of the country all thoſe who were moſt capable of governing the commonwealth, the law was repealed ſoon after it had been enacted.</p><p>About this time the Syracuſians entered into a war with the Siculi, which terminated in the total ſubjection of the latter ; after which Syracuſe became ſo powerful, that it in a manner gave law to the whole iſland. The Greek cities indeed enjoyed a perfect liberty ; but they all acknowledged Syracuſe as their metropolis : by degrees, however, the latter began to assume ſuch an authority over them as was totally inconſiſtent with liberty ; and this occasioned many wars, which involved them in much diſtreſs and danger. They began with the Leontines, whoſe territory they laid waste, and reduced their city to great ſtraits. Leontini was an Athenian colony ; and this furniſhed the Athenians, who had already meditated the conqueſt of Sicily, with a pretence to attack the Syracuſians with their whole force. Under colour of aſſiſting their countrymen, therefore, they ſent a fleet of 250 ſail to Sicily : but the Leontines, ſensible<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0261.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0255"/>
that their pretended allies aimed at nothing leſs than the conqueſt of the whole iſland, concluded a peace with Syracuſe ; and the diſappointed Athenians vented their rage upon thoſe who had adviſed and conducted the expedition.</p><p>In 416 B. C. a diſpute happening between the inhabitants of Egeſta and Selinus concerning ſome lands which the latter bad ſeized, the Egeſtines applied for aſſiſtance to Agrigentum, Syracuſe, and even to Carthage. But as none of these ſtates choſe to intereſt themſelves in their quarrel, they applied at laſt to the Athenians, who joyfully accented of the opportunity of again interfering in the affairs of Sicily. Though the Egestines were but an inconſiderable people, they had engaged to pay all the troops that ſhould be employ coin the war; but this appearing doubtful to the Athenians, they ſent ambaſſadors to inquire into the ſtate of the island in general, and particularly that of Egeſta. The Egeſtines impoſed on theſe ambaſſadors by producing a great number of gold and ſilver veſſels which they had borrowed for the purpose ; ſo that the populace of Athens, dreaming of nothing but conqueſts to be made without any expence, became obſtinately bent on the war. Nicias, a man of great influence at Athens, attempted to ſhow, that as Athens was then engaged in a dangerous war with Sparta, it was impossible to spare a force ſufficient to reduce the iſland ; but the contrary opinion being eſpouſed by Alcibiades, at that time the moſt eloquent ſpeaker in Athens, Nicias was overruled, and obliged to engage in the expedition. The force he required was only 5000 land forces and 100 galleys, with which, however inadequate to the purpose it may ſeem, the Athenians were ſo sure of ſucceſs, that the officers, before they ſet sail, had a conference with the ſenate concerning the diſpoſal of the Sicilians. In this conference it was agreed, that the Selinuntines and Syracuſians their ſuppoſed allies ſhould be carried off and sold for flaves, and the reſt obliged to pay an annual tribute and live according to the Athenian laws.</p><p>With theſe ſanguine expectations the Athenian forces embarked to the number of 7000; for such was their eagerneſs for the expedition, that 2000 more enliſted themſelves than Nicias had required. They firſt sailed to the iſland of Egina, and from thence to Corcyra, where they had appointed the place of rendezvous for their allies and the tranſports. On their arrival they ſet sail again, and landed on the coaſt of Italy, with a view to engage some of the Italian cities in their quarrel ; but finding this impossible, they ſent ſome ships to cruiſe off the coaſt of Sicily, in order to find out a proper place for landing, and at the ſame time to know what treasure the Egeſtines could contribute towards carrying on the war, which had been undertaken for their take. Theſe, on their return, acquainted the generals, that the Egeſtines had impoſed on them, and were a poor indigent people, who had only 30 talents in the treaſury. On this information a council of war was called, in which Nicias gave it as his opinion that they ſhould ſail to Selinus, which had been the firſt occasion of this expedition ; and then, if the Egeſtines performed their promiſe, and ſupplied the army with a month’s pay, to oblige the Selinuntines and Egeſtines to come to an agreement, and then return to Athens without engaging in ſuch an expenſive war. Alcibiades, however, again oppoſed Nicias ; thinking it highly diſhonourable to return home without doing any thing, after having been at the expence of fitting out an armament. He therefore urged, that they ſhould solicit the cities of Sicily to enter into a confederacy againſt the Syracuſians and Selinuntines ; and, in caſe they found them diſpoſed to come into their measures, to attack either Syracuſe or Selinus. Another of the Athenian genera’s was for laying ſiege immediately to Syracuſe ; but the opinion of Alcibiades prevailing, they ſet ſail ſor Sicily. Having accordingly landed in that iſland, they reduced ſeveral places ; but Alcibiades in the mean time being recalled, Nicias and Lamachus were left to conduct the war as they best could. At firſt they were ſucceſsful, poſſeſſing themſelves of a ſtrong poſt, and put the Syracuſians to flight ; ſoon after which they received conſiderable ſupplies both of men, money, and provisions, from Athens, as well as from their Sicilian allies, The Syracuſians alſo received aſſiſtance from the Lacedaemonians under the command of an experienced officer named <hi rend="italic">Gylippus.</hi> Before theſe arrived, the Athenians had poſſeſſed themſelves of an important poſt named <hi rend="italic">Epipola,</hi> which being a very ſteep hill, stood without the city and commanded it. Immediately after this the city was inveſted in form. The inhabitants made frequent and vigorous sallies ; but were always repulſed with loſs. In one of theſe ſallies Lamachus was ſlain ; and thus Nicias became sole commander. He then cauſed the canals to be cut by which water was conveyed into the city ; upon which the Syracuſians began to think of capitulating. From this, however, they were soon after prevented by the arrival of Gylippus with the Spartan auxiliaries. On this they prepared for making vigorous ſallies, in order to facilitate the entrance of Gylippus. While they were making theſe preparations, Gylippus himſelf appeared at the held of 3000 foot and 200 horſe. Making directly for Epipolæ, where Nicias had fortified himſelf in a caſtle named <hi rend="italic">Labdalon,</hi> he drew up his ſmall army under the walls ; and ſent an herald to Nicias, letting him know that he would allow him only five days to leave Sicily. To this meſſage Nicias returned no anſwer ; but Gylippus ſoon after attacked the fort, carried it by ſtorm, and put to the ſword all the Athenians that were in it. This opened for him a way into the city, where he was received with loud acclamations.</p><p>The fortune of the war was again changed. The Athenians gained an advantage by land, but were next day defeated with considerate loss. The Syracuſians received freſh ſupplies from Corinth, and the Athenians from their own country. Many engagements both by ſea and land took place, in which the ſucceſs was ultimately in favour of the Syracuſians At laſt the Athenian affairs were totally ruined by the loſs of a ſea-fight, in which 60 of their ships were taken or deſtroyed, and the reſt left quite unſerviceable. In this deſperate ſituation it was determined to abandon their ſhips, and retire that very night to the city of their confederates. The Syracuſian commander, suſpecting that this would be the caſe, ordered all his forces to be in readiness to prevent them from effecting their purpoſe. But as the people were then in the height of their rejoicing for the late victory, they refuted to take up arms again until they had reſted for ſome days. On this Hermocrates the general ſent to the Athenian camp ſome horsemen, who were to paſs for friends, and to adviſe Nicias not to quit his camp, which was well fortified, ſince the Syracuſians lay in ambush for him, and has ſeized on all the paſſes leading to the cities of their allies. To this false advice Nicias gave too eaſy credit, and did not march out till the third day, when his antagoniſt Hermocrates had prevailed upon his forces to march out. The Athenians and their allies alſo marched out to the number of no leſs than 40,000 ; but finding themſelves ſhut up on all sides, and being obliged to fight, their way through every outlet, they ſoon sunk into the deepeſt despair. Nicias did his utmoſt to encourage them ; and at laſt ſucceeded ſo far that they marched out in two bodies, both drawn up in proper order. The vanguard led by Nicias continued to keep together, and advanced in good order ; but half the rear, commanded by Demoſthenes, lost their way in the night, and were obliged to surrender. Ni-<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0262.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0256"/>
cias being informed <hi rend="italic">of</hi> this misfortune, offered to pay the whole expence <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the war, provided he was allowed to march off with his men. But this being rejected, he ſet out, tho’ galled all the way by ſhowers of darts from his enemies. Arriving at a rivet called <hi rend="italic">Aſmarus,</hi> they ruſhed into it without any order; in which confuſion the Syracuſian cavalry attacked them ſo deſperately, that 18,000 periſhed, and the river for many miles was dyed with their blood. On this occaſion the Athenians were ſo preſſed with thirſt, that, unmindful of their danger, they drank the waters of the river all bloody as they were, which gave their enemies the better opportunity of ſlaughtering them without resiſtance. The remainder ſurrendered, on the ſingle condition of having their lives ſaved ; but the terms were ſhamefully broke by the Syracuſians. The generals were firſt ignominiouſly whipt, and then put to death : the common ſoldiers were thruſt down into quarries, where they were allowed only two ſmall meaſures of flour and one of water a-day ; and where, being crowded upon one another, they ſuffered inexpreſſible miſeries for many months. Moſt of them periſhed by this cruel treatment, and the few who ſurvived were sold for ſlaves.</p><p>The war was ſcarce ended, when a new and formidable invaſion by the Carthaginians took place ; but the event of that expedition was as unfortunate to the Carthaginians as the former had been, of which a particular account is given under the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Carthage,</hi> n⁰ 12. <hi rend="italic">et seq.</hi></p><p>In the mean time, however, a conſiderable revolution had happened in Syracuſe. The city of Agrigentum had been taken by the Carthaginians, and of the few inhabitants who eſcaped, ſome fled to Syracuſe, where they accuſed the Syracuſian commanders of having betrayed the city into the hands of the enemy. Dionyſius, a man of great valour and addreſs, but who had become very obnoxious to the populace, took this opportunity of attempting to retrieve his credit. He therefore ſupported the accuſations brought againſt his countrymen by the Agrigentines, and even impeached the magiſtrates as having a ſecret intelligence with the enemy, and attempting to introduce an oligarchy. As his ſpeech was entirely levelled againſt the more wealthy citizens, it was very agreeable to the lower claſs : the commanders were inſtantly degraded ; and others, among whom was Dionyſius, were appointed. Having once gained this point, he began to conſider how he might get all his colleagues turned out. For this purpoſe he never joined in any council of war with the other commanders, nor imparted to them his reſolutions, giving out that he could not truſt them, and that they had more regard for their own intereſt than the welfare of their country. But while he was proceeding in this manner, the more prudent part of the citizens, perceiving what he aimed at, complained of him to the ſenate and magiſtrates, and fined him as a diſturber of the public peace. According to the laws, the fine was to be paid before he could ſpeak in public, and the circumſtances of Dionyſius did not allow him to discharge it. In this dilemma he was aſſiſted by Philiſtus the hiſtorian, a man of great wealth, who not only paid this fine for him, but encouraged him to speak his mind freely, as it became a zealous citizen to do, promiſing to pay all the fines that ſhould be laid upon him.</p><p>Being extricated out of this difficulty, Dionyſius next proceeded to inveigh, with all the eloquence he was maſter of, againſt thoſe who by means of their power or intereſt were able to oppoſe his deſigns, and by degrees brought them into diſcredit. His next ſcheme was to get thoſe exiles recalled whom the nobility had baniſhed at different times ; as thinking that they would ſupport him with all their power, as well out of gratitude as out of hatred to the oppoſite party. Having gained this point alſo, he next found means to ingratiate himſelf with the ſoldiery to ſuch a degree, that, under pretence of taking proper meaſures for refilling the Carthagrinians, he was choſen commander in chief, with abſolute and unlimited power. This was no ſooner done, than, pretending that his life was in danger, he choſe out 1000 men for his guard, whom he attached to his intereſt by great promises. As no perſon durſt now oppoſe him, he poſſeſſed himſelf of the citadel, where all the arms and proviſions were kept ; after which he publicly took the title of king of Syracuſe in the year 404 B. C.</p><p>The Syracuſians did not tamely ſubmit to their new maſter : but Dionyſius managed matters ſo well, that their frequent revolts anſwered no other purpoſe than more certainly to entail ſlavery on themſelves; and he was allowed to poſſeſs the throne without much oppoſition till his death, which happened in the year 366 B. C.</p><p>On the death of Dionyſius, he was ſucceeded by his ſon, called also <hi rend="italic">Dionyſius.</hi> He was naturally of a mild and peaceable temper, averſe from cruelty, and inclined to learning ; but his father, to whom all merit, even in his own children, gave umbrage, ſtifled as far as poſſible his good qualities by a mean and obſcure education. He no ſooner aſcended the throne, than Dion, brother to Ariſtomache the other wife of Dionyſius the Elder, undertook to correct the faults of his education, and to inſpire him with thoughts ſuitable to the high ſtation in which he was placed. For this purpoſe he ſent for the philoſopher Plato, under whose care he immediately put the young king. This inſtantly produced a reformation on Dionyſius ; but the courtiers, dreading the effects of the philoſopher’s inſtructions, prevailed on him to baniſh Dion, and to keep Plato himſelf in a kind of impriſonment in the citadel. At laſt, however, he ſet him at liberty ; upon which Plato returned to his own country.</p><p>Dion, in the mean time, viſited ſeveral of the Grecian cities, and at laſt took up his reſidence in Athens ; but the honours which were everywhere paid him, raiſed ſuch jealouſies in the breaſt of the tyrant, that he stopped his revenue, and cauſed it to be paid into his own treaſury. In a ſhort time Dionyſius again ſent for Plato ; but finding it impoſſible to diſſolve the friendſhip between him and Dion, diſgraced, and placed him in a very dangerous ſituation, in the midſt of aſſaſſins who hated him. Not daring, however, to offer him any violence, he allowed him ſoon after to depart ; revenging himſelf on Dion, whoſe eſtate he fold, and gave his wife Arete in marriage to Timocrates one of his own flatterers.</p><p>Dion now reſolved to revenge himſelf on the tyrant for the many injuries he had ſuſtained, and at once to deliver his country from the oppression under which it groaned. He began with raising foreign troops privately, by proper agents, for the better execution of his deſign. Many Syracuſians of diſtinction entered into his ſcheme, and gave him intelligence of what paſſed in the city; but of the exiles, of whom there were upwards of 1000 diſperſed up and down Greece, only 25 joined him ; ſo much were they awed by the dread of the tyrant. The troops were aſſembſed at the iſland of Zacynthus, in number only about 800 ; but who had all been tried on many occaſions, were well diſciplined, and capable of animating by their example the forces which Dion hoped to find in Sicily. When they were about to ſail, Dion acquainted them with his deſign, the boldneſs of which at firſt occaſioned no ſmall conſternation among them ; but Dion ſoon removed their fears, by telling them that he did not lead them as ſoldiers, but as officers, to put them at the head of the Syracuſians and all the people of Sicily, who were ready to receive them with open<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0263.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0257"/>
arms, Having then embarked in two ſmall trading vessels, they arrived in 12 days at Cape Pachynum near Syracuſe. Their pilot adviſed them to land immediately, left they ſhould be overtaken by a violent ſtorm, which he perceived was approaching ; but Dion, judging it improper to land ſo near the enemy, commanded him to put to ſea again, and double the Cape. — This was no ſooner done than the ſtorm came on ; and the two vessels were driven on the coaſt of Africa, where they were in great danger of being loſt. At laſt they arrived at the port of Minoa, not far from Agrigentum. Here they received intelligence that Dionyſius had ſet sail for Italy, attended by a fleet of 80 galleys. On this Dion reſolved to take advantage of the tyrant’s abſence ; and immediately set sail for Syracuſe. On his march he prevailed upon the inhabitants of Agrigentum, Gela, Camarina, and other cities, to join him. As ſoon as he entered the territories of Syracuſe, multitudes flocked to him ; and as nobody appeared to oppose him, he boldly entered the city, where he quickly found himſelf at the head of 50,000 men. As ſoon as he had landed in Sicily, Timocrates, to whom his wife Arete had been given by Dionyſius, and to whom the care of the city had been left, dispatched a courier to let the tyrant know the danger in which he was. The messenger, when almoſt at his journey’s end, found himſelf ſo much oppressed by fatigue, that he could not help lying down on the ground to take ſome reſt. In the mean time, a wolf, ſmelling ſome meat which he had in his wallet, came to the place, and carried off the bag in which was the meat, together with the diſpatches. By this means Dionyſius was prevented from receiving a timely account of Dion’s arrival ; ſo that when he entered the citadel by ſea, seven days after Dion’s arrival, he found his affairs in a desperate ſituation. Upon this he had recourſe to artifice ; and having amuſed the Syracuſians by a feigned negotiation, until he obſerved that they kept a negligent guard, he attacked them all at once with ſuch fury, that he had almoſt taken the city. But Dion encouraged the ſoldiers by his example ſo much, that he at laſt obtained a complete victory ; for which they preſented him with a crown of gold.</p><p>It was not long, however, before the ungrateful Syracuſians began to think of conferring quite different rewards on their benefactor. Dionyſius had the addrefs to render him ſuſpected by the multitude ; at the ſame time that Heraclides, an excellent officer, but a ſecret enemy to Dion, did all that lay in his power to ſink his credit. In a ſhort time Dionyſius was obliged to fly into Italy : after which Heraclides, in order to ingratiate himſelf with the populace, propoſed a new division of lands ; inſinuating, that they could never enjoy perfect liberty as long as there was so much inequality in wealth and power among the citizens. This ſcheme was oppoſed by Dion, in conſequence of which a general combination was formed againſt him ; and he was deſerted by all excepting the foreign troops whom he had brought with him into the iſland. The Syracuſians ſolicited even theſe to abandon the cauſe of their general : but their offers were rejected with diſdain ; and Dion, with his faithful adherents, getting clear of the tumultuous and riotous populace, took the road to Leontini. The rabble pursued him, but were ſoon driven back : and Dion reſided for ſome time at Leontini, where he was received with all the reſpect due to his character.</p><p>In the mean time, the citadel ſtill continued in the hands of the adherents of Dionyſius. Being blocked up on all ſides, they were reduced to great ſtraits, and were actually making proposals of capitulation, when Nypſius, an experienced general, and greatly attached to Dionyſius, appeared with a numerous ſquadron of galleys, and a large fleet of tranſports laden with proviſions. The general landed his men, and got them into the citadel ; but almoſt all his galleys and ſhips laden with corn were ſunk or taken. This victory proved the ruin of the Syracuſians ; for, giving themſelves up to feaſting and debauchery, the enemy sallied out in the night time from the citadel, and maſſacred the citizens without mercy. Being thus made ſenſible of the error they had committed, an embaſſy was sent to Dion, intreating him to return and lave the city a second time. To this he agreed without heſitation, and inſtantly ſet out on his march ; but in the mean time, as the ſoldiers of Dionyſius, ſatiated with ſlaughter, had retired into their fortreſs, the ungrateful Syracuſians began to repent of their having ſent an embaſſy to Dion. The chief commanders, therefore, ſent meſſengers to ſtop his march ; but as ſome of his friends ſent deputies to him at the ſame time, deſiring him to pay no regard to the former meſſage, he proceeded on his journey. The infatuated multitude ſeized the gates in order to diſpute his entrance ; but they paid dear for their frenzy. The Dionyſians again ſallied out upon them, and made ſuch ſlaughter, that one would have thought they had left none alive in the city. As the troops of the tyrant well knew that Dion was haſtening to the relief of the city, they uſed their utmoſt endeavours to deſtroy it entirely before his arrival ; for, after they had murdered all the inhabitants they could find, they ſet fire to the houſes, by which great numbers periſhed. During this confuſion Dion unexpectedly arrived ; and having briſkly attacked the enemy, at laſt defeated them with great ſlaughter, driving the remainder into the citadel. During the reſt of the night, inſtead of refreſhing themſelves after their fatigues, they aſſiſted in extinguiſhing the fire ; which was not done without great danger and difficulty. The citadel ſoon after ſurrendered ; and Dion allowed Apollocrates the tyrant’s ſon, who commanded there, to retire with five galleys to his father. As ſoon as Dion entered the citadel, he was met by his ſiſter and wife Arete, whom he received with affection, notwſthſtanding her having lived ſo long with Timocrates. He then left the Syracuſians in possession of the citadel, rewarded his followers, diſmissed his guards, and continued to live like a private citizen.</p><p>As ſoon as Dion had got posseſſion of the city, Heraclides had ſubmitted to him, and been received into favour ; but as his ſeditious and turbulent behaviour ſtill continued, Dion at laſt gave orders to put him to death. This action, however necessary, ſo affected the mind of Dion, that he became melancholy ; and ever after imagined himſelf haunted by a frightful spectre, reſembling a woman of gigantic ſtature, with the haggard looks and air of a fury. In a ſhort time after he loſt his life, through the baſe treachery of Calippus, or Gylippus, who pretended to be his intimate friend, and who immediately after cauſed his wife and ſiſter to be carried to priſon.</p><p>Calippus having thus removed Dion, ſoon made himſelf maſter of Syracuſe, where he committed all manner of cruelties ; but was driven out, and forced to fly to Rhegium, where he was murdered with the ſame dagger which had killed Dion. In 350 B. C. Dionyſius again made himſelf maſter of Syracuſe ; and being exaſperated by his past misfortunes, tyrannized worſe than ever. The Syracuſians first had recourſe to Icetas tyrant of Leontini ; but as the Carthaginians took this opportunity to invade them with a powerful fleet and army, they were obliged to apply to the Corinthians. By them Timoleon, a celebrated commander, was ſent to the aſſiſtance of the Syracuſians, whom he found in a very diſtreſſed ſituation ; Icetas being maſter of the city, the Carthaginians of the harbour, and Dionyſius of the citadel. As all parties were equally the enemies of Diony-<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0264.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0258"/>
fius, he found it impoſſible to hold out, and therefore ſurendered himſelf to Timoleon, by whom he was ſent to Corinth ; where at laſt he was reduced to the necessity of teaching a ſchool for his ſupport.</p><p>After the expulſion of the tyrant, Timeleon withdrew to Catana, leaving only 400 Corinthians, under the command of an experienced officer named <hi rend="italic">Leon,</hi> to guard the citadel. Theſe were immediately beſieged by Icetas and the Carthaginians, but Timoleon found means to relieve them in ſpite of all oppoſition ; and having diſperſed emiſſaries through the army of Mago the Carthaginian general, exhorting the mercenary Greeks to forſake him, he was ſo much intimidated, that in ſpite of all the remonstrances Icetas could make, he ſet ſail for Africa, leaving his colleague to carry on the war in the beſt manner he could.</p><p>The day after the departure of Mago, Timoleon aſſaulted the city ſo briſkly, that the troops of Icetas were driven from the walls, and the Corinthians became masters of the place. Timoleon, by sound of trumpet, invited the inhabitants to come and aſſiſt in demoliſhing the citadel and other caſtles, which he called the ne <hi rend="italic">sts of tyrants ;</hi> after which he cauſed edifices to be erected in the place where the citadel had ſtood, for the adminiſtration of juſtice. He found the city in a moſt miſerable ſituation : for many having periſhed in the wars and seditions, and others having fled to avoid the oppreſſion of tyrants, Syracuse, once ſo wealthy and populous, was now become almoſt a deſert ; inſomuch that the horſes were fed on the graſs which grew on the market-place. Timoleon ſupplied the city with inhabitants from Corinth and other cities of Greece, at the ſame time that great multitudes from Italy and the other parts of Sicily reſorted thither. Timoleon diſtributed the lands among them <hi rend="italic">gratis ;</hi> but. fold the houſes, and with the money ariſing from the ſale eſtabliſhed a fund for the ſupport of the poor. Having thus reſtored Syracuſe, he in like manner delivered all the Greek cities of Sicily from the tyrants who had taken poſſeſſion of them, all of whom he put to death. After this he resigned his authority, and led a retired life, honoured in the higheſt degree by the Syracusians, and by all the cities in Sicily. After his death he was honoured as a god ; the expence of his funeral was defrayed by the public; ſports, with horſe-races and gymnaſtic exerciſes, were held annually on the day of his death ; and it was decreed, that whenever the Syracusians were at war with the barbarians, they ſhould ſend to Corinth for a general.</p><p>For 20 years the Syracusians enjoyed the fruits of Timoleon’s victories ; but new diſturbances ariſing, in a ſhort time another tyrant ſtarted uρ, who exceeded all that had gone before him in cruelty and other vices. This was the celebrated Agathocles, of whoſe exploits againſt the Carthaginians a full account is given under the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Carthage,</hi> n⁰ 33—53. He was poiſoned by one Moenon in the year 289 B. C. after having reigned 28 years, and lived 95.— A ſucceſſion of tyrants followed, till at laſt the city, being held by two rivals, Tœnion and Soſiſtratus, who made war within the very walls, Pyrrhus king of Epirus was invited into Sicily, in order to put an end to theſe distractions. He willingly complied with the invitation ; and was everywhere received with loud acclamations, as the deliverer not only of Syracuſe, but of all Sicily. As he had a fine army of 30,000 foot and 5000 horſe, with a fleet of 200 ſail, he drove the Carthaginians from place to place, till he left them only the two ſtrong poſts of Eryx and Lilybæum. The former of theſe he took by aſſault, and was himſelf the firſt man who mounted the walls, after having killed a great number of Africans with his own hand. The Mamertines likewiſe, who had conquered a conſiderable part of the iſland, were everywhere defeated and driven out, till at laſt they were ſhut up in the city of Messana. The Carthaginians, alarmed at the rapidity of his conquests, ſent ambasſadors with propoſals of peace upon very advantageous terms ; but Pyrrhus, puffed up with the expectation of reducing the whole iſland, refuſed to hearken to any terms unleſs they would inſtantly abandon it. So firm was he in the belief of this, that he cauſed his son take upon him the title of <hi rend="italic">king of Sicily ;</hi> but in the mean time, having diſpleaſed the Sicilians by his arbitrary behaviour, they deſerted from him in ſuch numbers that he was glad to ſet out for Italy, for which retreat the embaſſies he received from the Samnites, Tarentines, and other Italians, furnished him with an honourable pretext. He embarked in the ſhips which he had brought with him from Italy ; but was met at ſea by the Carthaginians, who sunk 70 of his veſſels, and diſperſed or took the reſt ; ſo that he ſaved himſelf in Italy only with 12 vesſels, the poor remains of a fleet of 200 ſail. No ſooner were the Mamertines appriſed of his departure, than they diſpatched a body of 18,000 men to haraſs him after his landing. Theſe, having paſſed the ſtraits before him, posted themſelves in the road which Pyrrhus must take in marching by land to Tarentum ; and concealing themſelves among woods and rocks, attacked him unexpectedly, and with great reſolution. But Pyrrhus behaved on this occasion with his uſual bravery. The attack being made on his rear, he haſtened thither, and made a dreadful slaughter of the enemy, till a wound on his head obliged him to retire. As he was ſuppoſed to be diſabled by this wound, a proud Mamertine, of an extraordinary ſize, and ſhining in bright armour, advanced, and with a loud voice challenged the king of Epirus, if he was yet alive, to a single combat. Pyrrhus immediately turned about, and making a dreadful appearance by reaſon of the blood which ran down his face, flew at this new champion, on whoſe head he diſcharged ſuch a furious blow, that he cleft his body aſunder ; one half falling to the right, and the other to the left. This incredible feat, which has ſince been aſcribed to other warriors, perhaps with as much truth as to Pyrrhus, ſo much intimidated the Mamertines, that they allowed his troops to continue their march unmoleſted.</p><p>After the departure of Pyrrhus, Hiero the ſon of Hierocles, a deſcendant of Gelon the firſt king of Syracuſe, was choſen general of the forces, along with another named Ar <hi rend="italic">temidorus.</hi> The two gcnerals had nothing more at heart than to put an end to the confusion and diſorder which reigned in the city ; for which reaſon they entered it at the head of their forces. On this occaſion Hiero diſcovered extraordinary talents for government. By mere dint of insinuation and addreſs, without ſhedding blood, or hurting a single citizen, he calmed the minds of the people ; reconciled the factions ; and ſo gained the affections of all, that he was inveſted with the whole civil as well as military power in the ſtate. Soon after this, he married the daughter of one of the firſt citizens ; and having distinguiſhed himſelf by his exploits againſt the Mamertines, was unanimouſly elected king of Syracuſe, in the year 265 B. C.</p><p>Some time after Hiero’s acceſſion to the throne, he again defeated the Mamertines, and reduced them to ſuch ſtraits, that they were obliged to call in the Romans to their aſſiſtance. The conſequences of this have been fully related under the articles <hi rend="smallcaps">Rome</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Carthage,</hi> Hiero, who had allied himſelf with the Carthaginians, being himſelf defeated by the Romans, and finding his allies unable to protect him againſt the power of that republic, concluded an alliance with them ; and continued faithful to them even in the time of the ſecond Punic war, when they were in the greateſt diſtreſs. In his reign flouriſhed the celebrated mathematid cian Archimedes, whoſe genius he employed in fortifying<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0265.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0259"/>
the city of Syracufe, by innumerable machines, in ſuch a manner as rendered it abſolutely impregnable to every method of attack known at that time.</p><p>Hiero died about 211 B. C. and was ſucceeded by his grandſon Hieronymus: but he imprudently forſook the counſels of his grandfather, and entered into an alliance with the Carthaginians. Soon after this he was murdered, in consequence of his tyranny and cruelty, and the greateſt disorders took place in the city ; which Hannibal, though then in Italy, found means to foment, in hopes of keeping the Syracuſians in his intereſt. This indeed he effected ; but as his own affairs in Italy began to decline, he could not prevent Marcellus from landing in Sicily with a formidable army, which the Sicilians could by no means reſiſt. Syracuſe was soon inveſted ; but the machines invented by Archimedes baffled all attempts to take it by aſſault. It was 22 miles in compaſs, and conſiſted properly of live cities in one, viz. Ortygia, Acradina, Tyche, Neapolis, and Epipolæ. Ortygia was a ſmall iſland very near the continent, and might be called the <hi rend="italic">citadel of Syracuse,</hi> being joined to Acradina by a bridge. The immenſe preparations which the conſul had made for taking the city by ſtorm, could not have failed to accompliſh his purpoſe, had the place been otherwise defended than by the contrivance of Archimedes. The Roman fleet conſiſted of 60 quinqueremes, beſides a far greater number of other ſhips. The decks were covered with ſoldiers armed with darts, slings, and bows, to drive the beſieged from the ramparts, which on the side of Acradina were waſhed by the ſea, and to facilitate the approach to the walls. But a machine of Marcellus’s own invention was what he chiefly depended on. He had faſtened together ſidewiſe eight galleys of different lengths, which made but one large body, and were rowed only by the oars of the outermoſt galleys. Theſe eight galleys thus joined, ſerved only as a baſis for a machine, which was raised up higher than the higheſt towers of the walls, and had at the top a platform guarded with parapets in front and on each ſide. This machine was called a s <hi rend="italic">ambuca,</hi> from its reſemblance to a muſical inſtrument of that name, not unlike an harp. The conſul’s deſign was to bring his sambuca to the foot of the walls of Acradina ; but, while it was at a conſiderable diſtance (and it advanced very slow, being moved only by two ranks of rowers), Archimedes discharged from one of his engines a vaſt ſtone, weighing, according to Plutarch’s account, 1250 pounds, then a second, and immediately after a third ; all which, falling upon the sambuca with a dreadful noiſe, broke its ſupports, and gave the galleys upon which it ſtood ſuch a violent ſhock that they parted, and the machine which Marcellus had raiſed upon them at a vaſt trouble and expence was battered to pieces. At the ſame time, ſeveral other machines, which were not viſible without the walls, and consequently did not lessen the confidence of the Romans in the aſſault, played inceſſantly upon their ſhips, and overwhelmed them with ſhowers of ſtones, rafters, and beams pointed with iron ; inſomuch that Marcellus, being at a loſs what to do, retired with all poſſible haste, and ſent orders to his land-forces to do the ſame ; for the attack on the land-side was attended with no better success, the ranks being broken and thrown into the utmoſt confuſion by the ſtones and darts, which flew with ſuch noiſe, force, and rapidity, that they ſtruck the Romans with terror, and daſhed all to pieces before them.</p><p>Marcellus, ſurprised, though not diſcouraged, at this artificial ſtorm, which he did not expect, held a council of war, in which it was reſolved, the next day before ſunrise, to come up cloſe under the wall, and keep there. They were in hopes by this means to secure themselves againſt the terrible ſtorm of ſtones and darts which fell on the ſhips when at a diſtance. But Archimedes had prepared engines which were adapted to all diſtances. When the Romans therefore had brought their ſhips cloſe under the wall, and thought themſelves well covered, they were unexpectedly overwhelmed with a new ſhower of darts and ſtones, which fell perpendicularly on their heads, and obliged them to retire with great precipitation. But they were no ſooner got at ſome diſtance, than a new ſhower of darts overtook them, which made a dreadful havock of the men, while ſtones of an immenſe weight, diſcharged from other machines, either diſabled or broke in pieces moſt of their galleys. This loſs they ſuſtained, without being able to revenge it in the least on the enemy. For Archimedes had placed moſt of his engines behind the walls, and not only out of the reach, but even out of the fight, of the enemy ; ſo that the Romans were repulſed with a dreadful slaughter, without seeing the hand that occaſioned it ; as if they had been lighting, to uſe Plutarch’s expreſſion, not with men, but with the gods themſelves. What moſt haraſſed the Romans in the attack by ſea, was a sort of crow with iron claws, faſtened to a long chain, which was let down by a kind of lever. The weight of the iron made it fall with great violence, and drove it into the planks oſ the galleys. Then the beſieged, by a great weight of lead at the other end of the lever, weighed <hi rend="italic">it</hi> down, and conſequently raiſed up the iron of the crow in proportion, and with it the prow of the galley to which it was faſtened, linking the poop at the ſame time into the water. After this the crow letting go its hold all of a ſudden, the prow of the galley fell with ſuch force into the ſea, that the whole vessel was filled with water, and sunk. At other times, the machines, dragging ſhips to the ſhore by hooks, daſhed them to pieces againſt the points of the rocks which projected under the walls. Other veſſels were quite lifted up into the air, there whirled about with incredible rapidity, and then let fall into the ſea, and sunk, with all that were in them. How theſe ſtupendous works were effected, few, if any, have hitherto been able to comprehend.</p><p>The troops under the command of Appius ſuffered no leſs in this second attack than the fleet. In the whole space of ground which the army, when formed, took up, the laſt files as well as the firſt were overwhelmed with ſhowers of darts and flints, against which they could not poſſibly defend themſelves. When they had with infinite trouble brought the mantelets and covered galleries, under which they were to work the rams, near the foot of the wall, Archimedes discharged ſuch large beams and ſtones upon them as cruſhed them to pieces. If any brave Roman ventured to draw too near the wall, iron hooks were immediately let down from above, which, taking hold of his clothes or ſome part of his body, lifted him up in the air and daſhed out his brains with the fall. Marcellus, though at a loſs what to do, could not however forbear expreſſing himſelf with pleaſantry : Shall we perſiſt, said he to his workmen, in making war upon this Briareus, upon this giant with an hundred hands? But the ſoldiers were ſo terrified, that if they law upon the walls only a ſmall cord, or the leaſt piece of wood, they immediately turned their backs and fled, crying out, that Archimedes was going to diſcharge ſome dreadful machine upon them.</p><p>The consuls, finding themſelves thus defeated in every attempt, turned the ſiege into a blockade, reduced moſt of the other places in the iſland, and defeated the forces which were ſent againſt them ; and at laſt Marcellus made himſelf maſter of Syracuſe itſelf, of which the following account is given by Mr Hooke. “ He took the opportunity of a feſtival, when the ſoldiers and citizens had drunk plentifully, to make a detachment ſcale the walls of Tyche, in that part<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0266.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0260"/>
of it which was neareſt to Epipolæ, and which was ill guarded. He preſently after posseſſed himſelf of Epipolæ ; whereupon the inhabitants of Neapolis, as well as Tyche, ſent deputies to him, and ſubmitted. Marcellus granted life and liberty to all of free condition, but gave up thoſe quarters of the city to be plundered.</p><p>“ Notwithſtanding this, there was a great deal yet to do. Acradina and Ortygia, which were ſtrongly fortified, ſtill held out ; Hippocrates and Himilco arrived with their troops to the relief of the besieged ; and the Romans were forced to exert all their bravery and ſkill to maintain the advantages they had gained.</p><p>“ But now a plaque made terrible havock in both armies. At the firſt breaking out of the peſtilence, the Sicilians, who ſerved under Hippocrates and Himilco, diſbanded themſelves, and returned to their reſpective homes ; but all the Carthaginian ſoldiers periſhed, together with thoſe two generals. The Romans ſuffered leſs by the infection ; becauſe, having been a long time before Syracuſe, they were seaſoned to the air and water of the country.</p><p>“ About this time Bomilcar arrived on <hi rend="smallcaps">.</hi> the coaſt of Sicily from Carthage, with a fleet of 130 galleys and 700 ſhips of burden ; but was long hindered by contrary winds from doubling the cape of Pachynum. Epicydes, fearing the Carthaginian might sail back to Africa, left the command of Acradina to the generals of the mercenaries, and went to Bomilcar, in order to perſuade him to fight the Roman fleet. The admiral would not engage, but sailed away to Tarentum with all his galleys, ordering his ſhips of burden to return to Africa. Epicydes, thus fruſtrated of his hopes, and knowing himſelf unable to defend a city already half taken, retired to Agrigentum ; whereupon the Syracuſians maſſacred the commanders appointed by him, choſe new praetors to govern in the town, and ſent deputies to Marcellus to treat of peace. In the mean time, the deſerters, fearing to be given up to the vengeance of the Romans, perſuaded the mercenaries that they alſo would have the ſame fate, inſtantly the ſoldiers ran to arms, put to death the new prætors, together with many of the Syracuſians, and plundered part of the city. After this slaughter they choſe six generals, three to command in Acradina, and three in Ortygia. Upon the return of the deputies from Marcellus, the mercenaries finding that their caſe was different from that of the deſerters, and that there was no deſign againſt their lives, became perfectly satisfied, and the negotiation went on. During the courſe of the treaty, Marcellus found means to corrupt Mericus, a Spaniard, one of the six generals choſen by the ſoldiers, and engaged him to admit the Romans into that part of the city where he commanded. Mericus, the better to accompliſh this deſign, feigned an extraordinary zeal for the preſervation of that place ; pretended not to like that deputies ſhould have leave to go out and in at pleaſure ; and propoſed, that for the greater ſecurity of the town, each general ſhould have a diſtinct quarter aſſigned him, and be reſponſible for any neglect of duty in it. The motion was agreed to ; and upon the diviſion, that diſtrict of Ortygia which extended from the fountain of Arethuſa to the mouth of the great port fell to his care. Marcellus, informed of what was done, took his meaſures accordingly. He ſent a body of troops to that side where Mericus commanded, and the Spaniards admitted them at the gate of Arethuſa. At the ſame time, the proconſul ordered a falſe attack to be made on Acradina ; which drawing almoſt all the ſoldiers of the garriſon thither, Ortygia was in a manner left defenceleſs. Foreseing this, he had detached another party of ſoldiers to take advantage of it. Theſe entered Ortygia almoſt without fighting ; upon which the deſerters made their eſcape, the Romans giving them way ; and the Syracuſians in Acradina, thus delivered from the fear of the deſerters, immediately opened their gates to Marcellus, who thereby became master of the whole city.</p><p>“ And now the conqueror, who is ſaid to have wept during the ſiege with compaſſion for the inhabitants, gave up both Ortygia and Acradina to be plundered by his army, after he had ſecured the late king’s treasures for the uſe of his republic, and the ſtatues, paintings, and principal ornaments of Syracuſe to illuſtrate his triumph. The soldiers had orders to ſpare the lives of the citizens ; but they were cruel in their avarice, slew many of them, and among the reſt the incomparable Archimedes. He was very intent on a demonſtration in geometry, and calmly drawing his lines, when a ſoldier entered the room, and clapped a ſword to his throat. “ Hold ! (ſaid Archimedes) one moment, and my demonſtration will be finished." But the ſoldier, equally regardleſs of his prayer and his de- demonstration, killed him iniſtantly. There are different accounts of the manner of his death ; but all agree that Marcellus regretted it extremely, and ſhowed a ſingular favour to his relations for his ſake.”</p><p>The city of Syracuſe continued ſubject to the weſtern empire till its declenſion, when the iſtand of Sicily ; being ravaged by different barbarians, the capital alſo underwent various revolutions ; till at laſt, in the 9th century, it was ſo deſtroyed by the Saracens, that very few traces of its ancient grandeur are now to be ſeen. “ The ancient city of Syracuſe was of a triangular form, and conſiſted of five parts or towns. The circuit, according to Strabo, amounted to 180 ſtadia, or 22 Engliſh miles, and four furlongs. An account (says Mr Swinburne) which I once ſuſpected of exaggeration ; but, after spending two days in tracing the ruins, and making reasonable allowances for the encroachments of the ſea, I was convinced of the exactneſs of his meaſurement.</p><p>“ At preſent it is ſtrongly fortified towards the land, and the ditches of the bastions form the communications between the two havens. It is very weak towards the ſea, but the ſhelves render it hazardous to debark on that side. The garriſon is one oſ the beſt appointed in the kingdom, but the heights of Acradina command the works.</p><p>About eighteen thousand inhabitants are now contained in it. The dwellings are far from being memorials of ancient Syracuſan architecture or opulence. In any other ſituation they might be thought tolerable ; but to obſervers who reflect on the ſtyle of thoſe buildings that probably once covered the ſame ground, the preſent edifices muſt have a mean appearance. The ancient temple of Minerva is now turned into a cathedral. The walls of the cella are thrown down, and only as much left in pillars as is neceſſary to ſupport the roof ; the intercolumniations of the peryſtile are walled up. This temple is built in the old Doric proportions uſed in the reſt of Sicily ; its exterior dimenſions are 185 feet in length and 75 in breadth. There are alſo some remains of Diana’s temple, but now ſcarcely diſcernible. Besides theſe, there are few ruins in the iſland ; and one is ſurpriſed that any ſhould exiſt in a place which has been ſo often laid waſte by enemies, and ſo often ſhaken by earthquakes.</p><p>“ Every object here imprints a melancholy ſenſation on the mind, while it draws a compariſon between the preſent humble ſtate of things and their once flourishing condition. The ancients have left pompous descriptions of the traffic carried on in this well ſituated port, the almoſt incredible wealth poſſeſſed by its citizens, and the ſplendid edifices upon which they laviſhed a great part of their riches. I had already viewed (says Mr Swinburne) the deſert sites<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0267.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0261"/>
of many great ancient cities, and had as often mourned over their remains, but never did I feel the impreſſion of pity and regret ſo ſtrong as in wandering among the ruins of Syracuſe.”</p></div></body></text></TEI>
