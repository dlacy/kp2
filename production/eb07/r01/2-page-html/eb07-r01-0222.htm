The corn does not suffice for the consumption. Wheat is&nbsp;only grown in a few favoured spots ; the greater portion of&nbsp;bread-corn is rye, and potatoes are extensively cultivated&nbsp;as a substitute for grain. The valleys afford good fattening and dairy land ; but the black cattle are for the most&nbsp;part brought from Germany when young, and on the pastures here yield good butter, cheese, and meat The breed&nbsp;of sheep has been much neglected. The horses are a small&nbsp;race, and not numerous. The hills have extensive vineyards, and produce abundance of wine, some of which is&nbsp;good, and forms an article of considerable export trade.&nbsp;The best sorts are those furnished in the vicinity of Colmar, Turkheim, and Befort. There are a great number of&nbsp;fruit-trees, but especially of cherries, from which a distillation is made ; and the spirit called ki</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rchenwasser</span><span class="font0"> is highly&nbsp;valued in Switzerland. This is a mining district, which&nbsp;formerly produced silver, copper, and lead ; but the operations are now chiefly directed to obtaining iron and coal.&nbsp;These are the foundations of the chief manufactures, which&nbsp;employ a great number of hands in making cast and hammered iron, and ironmongery goods of various descriptions.&nbsp;There are several paper-mills, and many for spinning both&nbsp;cotton and flax. There are also manufactures of wool and&nbsp;hosiery. Much potash is also made, and some porcelain&nbsp;and glass. These are the basis of what trade exists. The&nbsp;capital of the department is the city of Colmar, with 15,958&nbsp;inhabitants in 1836.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RHODE Island, one of the United States of North America, is bounded on the north and east by Massachusetts, on the south by the Atlantic Ocean, and on the west&nbsp;by Connecticut. It is forty-nine miles in length by twenty-nine in breadth, and contains an area of one thousand&nbsp;three hundred and fifty square miles, which lie between&nbsp;4L 22. and 42. 3. of north latitude, and longitude 71. 6.&nbsp;and 71. 38. west from Greenwich. This portion of country includes what was formerly known by the name of&nbsp;Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, originally constituting two plantations or provinces. Compared with its&nbsp;limited extent, Rhode Island is a very diversified state. In&nbsp;the north-west part the country is hilly and broken, but it&nbsp;becomes gradually level towards the Atlantic Ocean. The&nbsp;state may be divided into three natural sections : the first,&nbsp;constituting four fifths of the whole, is a pretty hilly parallelogram, lying west from Narragansett Bay ; the second&nbsp;consists of the delightful islands of Narragansett Bay ; and&nbsp;the third section is a small irregular slip lying along Massachusetts, and east from Narragansett This bay extends&nbsp;from north to south through nearly the whole length of the&nbsp;state, and embosoms a number of islands, of which the&nbsp;most important are Rhode Island, Connecticut, Prudence,&nbsp;Patience, Hope, Dyer’s, and Hog Islands. Block Island,&nbsp;in the Atlantic, lying south of the state, is the most southerly land belonging to it. These islands, and the country&nbsp;bordering on the bay, are of great fertility, and are celebrated for their fine cattle, their numerous flocks of sheep,&nbsp;and the abundance and excellence of their butter and&nbsp;cheese. The state generally is better adapted to grazing&nbsp;than tillage. A large portion of the western and northwestern part of it has a thin and lean soil, which affords&nbsp;small crops of New England productions. Cider is made&nbsp;for exportation. Corn, rye, barley, oats, and in some places&nbsp;wheat, are produced in quantities sufficient for home consumption ; and the various kinds of grasses, fruits, culinary&nbsp;roots and plants, are in great abundance and perfection.&nbsp;In some parts iron is found in large quantities ; copper is&nbsp;also met with ; and the state abounds in limestone, particularly the county of Providence. Anthracite coal is wrought&nbsp;on the island which gives name to the state, but it- is not&nbsp;held in high estimation. There are several rivers in this&nbsp;state, but their courses are short : the principal are called&nbsp;Pawtucket, Providence, Pawtuxet, Pawcatuc, and Wood&nbsp;Rivers. These, and also the bays, swarm with many varieties of excellent fish. The climate is as salubrious as that&nbsp;of any other part of America, and more temperate than&nbsp;that of the other New England states, particularly on the&nbsp;islands where the ocean breezes have the usual effect of&nbsp;tempering the heat of summer and moderating the cold of&nbsp;winter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The island called Rhode Island, situated in the bay of Narragansett, and which gives name to the state, is about&nbsp;fifteen miles in length from north to south, and three and&nbsp;a half in breadth. It is divided into three townshlps, Newport, Portsmouth, and Middletown. This island is highly&nbsp;celebrated for its salubrity, and here numbers of invalids&nbsp;resort from southern climates. It is also of great fertility,&nbsp;and noted for its breeds of sheep, neat cattle, and horses.&nbsp;The whole is under high cultivation, and in some months&nbsp;of the year presents so delightful an appearance as to have&nbsp;obtained for it the name of the Eden of America.

<p><span class="font0">In no state in the Union is so large a proportion of the population and capital employed in manufactures as in&nbsp;Rhode Island. The principal article is cotton goods, for&nbsp;the manufacture of which there are above one hundred mills,&nbsp;many of them extensive establishments. For the year ending September 1836, there were eighty sets of machinery&nbsp;in operation for the manufacture of other kinds of goods,&nbsp;including broad cloths, satinets, jeans, linseys, and the&nbsp;like. The quantity of wool produced was 265,261 pounds,&nbsp;valued at 133,957 dollars. Iron, ardent spirits, and some&nbsp;other articles, are likewise amongst the manufactures of&nbsp;Rhode Island. The exports consist chiefly of flax-seed,&nbsp;lumber, horses, cattle, beef, pork, fish, poultry, and cotton&nbsp;and linen goods. For the year ending September 1836,&nbsp;the exports of domestic produce were to the amount of&nbsp;212,297 dollars, and of foreign produce 16,123 dollars; the&nbsp;total value of exports being 228,420 dollars, which appears&nbsp;to be considerably less than in some previous years. The&nbsp;value of the imports for the same period was 555,199 dollars. The amount of shipping of this state may be reckoned at about fifty thousand tons ; but so rapidly have commerce and manufactures extended, that a period of only a&nbsp;couple of years is sufficient to produce an increase in these&nbsp;branches of industry which could not have been looked for&nbsp;in such a limited space of time. In 1837 the banks were&nbsp;sixty-two in number, having specie to the amount of 243,482&nbsp;dollars, a circulation of 1,864,132 dollars, and a capital of&nbsp;9,837,171 dollars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Amongst the institutions of Rhode Island is Brown University, at Providence, a flourishing seminary. Academies are established in all the principal towns, and the state&nbsp;pays ten thousand dollars per annum for the support of free&nbsp;schools. The most numerous religious sect is that of the&nbsp;Baptists, who have about eighteen churches. There are,&nbsp;besides, the usual religious diversities which characterise a&nbsp;North American state, including many Friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Among the public works of this state may be mentioned the New York, Providence, and Boston Railway, extending from Stonington in Connecticut to Providence in Rhode Island. About forty miles of it lie in the latter state.&nbsp;It is connected with another railroad, and forms part of a&nbsp;line from Boston to New York. Other works of the kind&nbsp;are in progress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The population of Rhode Island in 1839 may be estimated as amounting to at least 125,000. The capital of the state is Providence, an account of which will be found&nbsp;under that head.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
