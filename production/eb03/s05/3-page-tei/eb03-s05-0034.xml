It is full of ſmall protuberances, with a hole in each, by which it sucks in and throws out the water. It is very common on the Britiſh coaſt, and is frequently ſeen ſurrounding fucuſes. It is found alſo on the ſhores of North America, Africa, and in the Eaſt Indies. When newly taken out of the ſea, it is of a bright orange colour, and full of gelatinous fleſh ; but when dry, it becomes whitiſh, and when broken has the appearance of crumb of bread. If rubbed on the hand, it will raiſe bliſters ; and if dried in an oven, its power of flinging is much increaſed, eſpecially that variety of it which is found on the ſea-coaſt of North America.</p><p>6.	<hi rend="italic">Palmata,</hi> palmated ſponge, is like a hand with fingers a little divided at the top. -The mouths are a little prominent, and irregularly diſpoſed on the ſurface. It is found on the beach at Brighthelmſtone. It is of a reddiſh colour, inclining to yellow, and of the ſame ſoft woolly texture with the ſpongia oculata, fig. 4.</p><p>7.	<hi rend="italic">Coronata,</hi> coronet ſponge, is very ſmall, consiſting of a single tube ſurrounded at top by a crown or little ſpines. The tube is open at the top. The rays that compoſe the little crown are of a bright, ſhining pearl colour ; the body is of a pale yellow. It has been found in the harbour of Emſworth, between Suſſex and Hampſhire.</p><p>8.	<hi rend="italic">Botryoides,</hi> grape ſponge, is very tender and branched, as if in bunches : the bunches are hollow, and are made up of oblong oval figures having the appearance of grapes ; and each bunch is open at top. This ſpecies is of a bright, ſhining colour. The openings at the top are evidently the mouths by which the animal imbibes and diſcharges moisture. When the ſurface is very much magnified, it appears covered with little maſſes of triple, equidiſtant, ſhining ſpines.</p><p>9.	<hi rend="italic">Lacustris,</hi> creeping ſponge, has erect, cylindrical, and obtuſe branches. It is found in lakes in Sweden and England.</p><p>10.	<hi rend="italic">Fluviatilis,</hi> river ſponge, is green, erect, brittle, and irregularly diſpoſed in numerous branches. It abounds in many parts of Europe, in the freſh rivers of Ruſſia and England, but particularly in the river Thames. It ſcarcely exhibits any ſymptoms of life, is of a fiſhy ſmell : its pores or mouths are ſometimes filled with green gelatinous globules. It differs very little from the lacuſtris.</p><p>So early as the days of Aristotle ſponges were ſuppoſed to poſſeſs animal life ; the persons employed in collecting them having obſerved them ſhrink when torn from the rocks, thus exhibiting ſymptoms of senſation. The ſame opinion prevailed in the time of Pliny : But no attention was paid to this ſubject till Count Marsigli examined them, and declared them vegetables. Dr Feyſonell, in a paper which he ſent to the Royal Society in the year 1752, and in a ſecond in 1757, affirmed they were not vegetables, but the production of animals ; and has accordingly described the animals, and the proceſs which they performed in making the ſponges. Mr Ellis, in the year 1762, was at great pains to diſcover theſe animals. For this purpoſe he diſſected the ſpongia urens, and was ſurpriſed to find a great number of ſmall worms of the genus of nereis or sea-ſcolopendra, which had pierced their way through the ſoft ſubſtance of the ſponge in queſt of a ſafe retreat. That this was really the caſe, he was fully aſſured of, by inſpecting a number of ſpecimens of the ſame sort of ſponge, juſt fresh from the ſea. He put them into a glaſs filled with ſea-water; and then, inſtead of ſeeing any of the little animals which Dr Peyſonell described, he obſerved the papillæ or ſmall holes with which the papillæ are ſurrounded contract and dilate themſelves. He examined another variety of the ſame ſpecies of ſponge, and plainly perceived the ſmall tubes inſpire and expire the water. He therefore concluded, that the ſponge is an animal, and that the ends or openings of the branched tubes are the mouths by which it receives its nouriſhment, and diſcharges its excrements.</p><p>SPONSORS, among Christians, are thoſe perſons who, in the office of baptiſm, anſwer or are ſureties for the perſons baptized.</p><p>SPONTANEOUS, a term applied to ſuch motions of the body and operations of the mind as we perform of ourſelves without any conſtraint.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">SPOON-bill,</hi> in ornithology.

He was educated in the univerſity of Glaſgow, and ſucceeded his father in the parſonage of Calder when but 18 years of age. In 1601 he attended Lodowick duke of Lennox as his chaplain, in an embaſſy to the court of France for confirming the ancient amity between the two nations, and returned in the ambaſſador’s retinue through England. When he entered into the archbiſhopric of Glasgow, he found there was not 100 l. Sterling of yearly revenue left ; yet ſuch was his care for his ſucceſſors, that he greatly improved it, and much to the satisfaction of his dioceſe. After having filled this ſee 11 years, he was raised to that of St Andrew’s in 1615, and made primate and metropolitan of all Scotland. He presided in ſeveral aſſemblies for reſtoring the ancient diſcipline, and bringing the church of Scotland to ſome sort of uniformity with that of England. He continued in high esteem with king James I. nor was he leſs valued by king Charles I. who was crowmed by him in 1633, in the abbey-church of Holyroodhouſe. In 1635, upon the death of the earl of Kinnoul chancellor of Scotland, our primate was advanced to that poll ; but had ſcarcely held it four years, when the contuſions beginning in Scotland, he was obliged to retire into England ; and being broken with age, grief, and ſickness, died at London in</p></body></text></TEI>
