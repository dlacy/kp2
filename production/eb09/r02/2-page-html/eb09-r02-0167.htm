<p><span class="font0">in comœdiis et tragœdiis prurienter festum faciunt et super ceteras romaucias, mimos, et bardanos cantitare delectantur.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Of his popularity in the latter half of the loth and in the 16th centuries there are many signs. Just one passage must be quoted as of special importance because&nbsp;closely followed by Grafton, Stow, and Camden. It is&nbsp;from Mair’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Historia Majoris Bmtanniæ tam Angliæ quam&nbsp;Scotiæ,</span><span class="font1"> which appeared in 1521.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“Circa hæc teuιpora [Ricardi Primi], ut auguror, Robertus Hudus Anglus et Parvus Joannes latrones famatissimi in nemoribus&nbsp;latuerunt, solum opulentorum virorum bona deripientes. Nullum&nbsp;nisi eos iuvadentem vel resistentem pro suarum rerum tuitione&nbsp;occideruut. Centum sagittarios ad ρugnam aptissimos Robertus&nbsp;latrociniis aluit, quos 400 viri fortissimi invadere non audebant.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rebus hujus Rοbcrti gcstis iota Britannia in cαntibus utitur.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">F∙&lt;υminam nullam opprimi permisit nec pauperum bona surripuit,&nbsp;verum eos ex abbatum bonis sublatis opipare pavit. Viri rapinam&nbsp;improbo, sed latronum omnium bumanissimus et princeps erat.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the Elizabethan era and afterwards mentions abound ; see the works of Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, Drayton,&nbsp;Warner, Munday, Camden, Stow, Braithwaite, Fuller, «fee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Of the ballads themselves, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Robin Hood and the Monk</span><span class="font1"> is possibly as old as the reign of Edward II. ; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Robin Hood&nbsp;and the Potter</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Robyn and Gandelyn</span><span class="font1"> are certainly not&nbsp;later than the 15th century. Most important of all is </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">A&nbsp;Lytell Geste of Robyn Hode,</span><span class="font1"> which perhaps was first printed&nbsp;about 1490, although the earliest extant complete copy&nbsp;belongs to about 1520. This is evidently founded on&nbsp;older ballads ; we read in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Seconde Eytte,</span><span class="font1"> 11. 176 and&nbsp;177 :</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“He wente hym forthe full mery syngynge,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As men have told in tale. ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In fact it does for the Robin Hood cycle what a few years before Sir Thomas Malory had done for the Arthurian&nbsp;romances,—what in the 6th century b.c. Pisistratus is said&nbsp;to have done for the Homeric poems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">These are the facts about him and his balladry. Of conjectures there is no end. He has been represented as&nbsp;the last of the Saxons,—as a Saxon holding out against&nbsp;the Norman conquerors so late as the end of the 12th&nbsp;century (see Thierry’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Harman Conquest,</span><span class="font1"> and compare&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ivanhoe).</span><span class="font1"> Others maintain that he was a follower of&nbsp;Simon de Montfort. A third theory associates him with&nbsp;the earl of Lancaster of Edward II.’s time : Hunter believed&nbsp;that he could identify him with a certain Robin Hood&nbsp;mentioned in the Exchequer accounts of this reign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For our part, we are not disinclined to believe that the Robin Hood story has some historical basis, however fanciful and romantic the superstructure. We parallel it with&nbsp;the Arthurian story, and hold that, just as there was&nbsp;probably a real Arthur, however different from the hero&nbsp;of the trouvères, so there was a real Hood, however now&nbsp;enlarged and disguised by the accretions of legend. That&nbsp;Charlemagne and Richard I. of England became the subjects of romances does not prevent our believing in their&nbsp;existence ; nor need Hood’s mythical life deprive him of&nbsp;his natural one. Sloth in Langland’s poem couples him,&nbsp;as we have seen, with Randle, earl of Chester; and no&nbsp;one doubts this nobleman’s existence because he had&nbsp;“ rymes ” made about him. We believe him to have been&nbsp;the third Randle (see Bishop Percy’s Folio MS., ed. Hales&nbsp;and Furnivall, i. 260). And possibly enough Hood was&nbsp;contemporary with that earl, who “ flourished ” in the&nbsp;reigns of Richard I., John, and Henry III. Wyntown&nbsp;and Major, as we have seen, assign him to that period.&nbsp;It is impossible to believe with Hunter that he lived so&nbsp;late as Edward II.’s reign. This would leave no time for&nbsp;the growth of his myth ; and his myth was, as is evident&nbsp;from what we have already said and quoted, full grown&nbsp;in the first half of the 14th century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But, whether he lived or not, and whenever he lived, it is certain that many mythical elements are contained in&nbsp;his story. Both his name and his exploits remind us of&nbsp;the woodland spirit Robin Goodfellow and his merry&nbsp;pranks. He is fond of disguising himself, and devoted to&nbsp;fun and practical jokes. And the connexion of the May&nbsp;games with him points to a fusion with some older memory,&nbsp;—with some sun-god. In fact, the outlaw would seem to&nbsp;have become a centre around which gathered and settled&nbsp;older traditions of men and of spirits and of gods. Folklore that was rapidly perishing thus gave itself a new consistency and life. The name Robin (a French form from&nbsp;Rob, which is of course a short form for Robert) would&nbsp;serve both for “the shrewd and knavish sprite”—the&nbsp;German Knecht Ruprecht (see Grimm’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Teut. Myth.,</span><span class="font1"> p.&nbsp;504, trans. Stallybrass)—and for the bandit (see “Roberdes&nbsp;Knaues ” in the Prologue of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Piers the Plowman,</span><span class="font1"> 1. 44 and&nbsp;the note in Warton’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hist, of Eng. Poet.,</span><span class="font1"> ii. 95, ed. 1840).&nbsp;The name Hood is still a common enough surname, of&nbsp;which the earlier shape is Odo (see “ Houdart,” »fee., in&nbsp;Larchey’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Diet, des Homs)</span><span class="font1"> ; notice too the name Hudson.&nbsp;But it also reminds one of the German familiar spirit&nbsp;Hudekin, or possibly of the German Witikind (see Wright’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Essays on the Middle Ages,</span><span class="font1"> ii. 207). How certain it is&nbsp;that the Robin Hood story attracted to it and appropriated&nbsp;other elements is illustrated by its subsequent history,—&nbsp;its history after the 14th century. Thus later on we find&nbsp;it connected with the Morris dance ; but the Morris dance&nbsp;was not known in England before the 16th century, or&nbsp;late in the 15th. And the form of the story was greatly&nbsp;modified in the beginning of the 17th century to suit the&nbsp;ideas of the age. It was then that a peer was imported&nbsp;into it, and the yeoman of the older version was metamorphosed into the earl of Huntingdon, for whom in the&nbsp;following century Stukeley discovered a satisfactory pedigree ! At last, with the change of times, the myth ceased&nbsp;growing. Its rise and development and decay deserve a&nbsp;more thorough study than they have yet received.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">What perhaps is its greatest interest as we first see it is its expression of the popular mind about the close of&nbsp;the Middle Ages. Robin Hood is at that time the people’s&nbsp;ideal as Arthur is that of the upper classes. He is the&nbsp;ideal yeoman as Arthur is the ideal knight. He readjusts&nbsp;the distribution of property : he robs the rich and endows&nbsp;the poor. He is an earnest worshipper of the Virgin, but&nbsp;a bold and vigorous hater of monks and abbots. He is&nbsp;the great sportsman, the incomparable archer, the lover&nbsp;of the greenwood and of a free life, brave, adventurous,&nbsp;jocular, open-handed, a protector of women. Observe his&nbsp;instructions to Little John :—</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ Loke ye do no housbonde lιanno That tylleth with his plough.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">No more ye shall no good y eman That walketh by grene wode shawe,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Ne no knyght ne no squyer That wolde be a good felawe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">These bysshoppes and tlιyse archebysshoppes Ye shall them bete and bynde ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The hye sheryfe of Notynghamo Hym holde in your mynde.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">And we are told</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ Robin loved our dere lady</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For doute of dedely synne ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Wolde he never do company h&lt;arme</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">That ony woman was ynue. ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">See also Drayton’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Polyolbioη,</span><span class="font1"> Song xxvi. The story is localized in Barnsdale and Sherwood, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font1"> between Doncaster and Nottingham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The best collections of the Robin Hood poems are those of Ritson (8vo, 1795) and Gutch (2d ed., 1847), and of Professor Child in the 5th&nbsp;volume of his invaluable </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">English and Scotch Ballads.</span><span class="font0"> The versions&nbsp;in the Percy Folio MS. are unhappily mutilated; but they should be&nbsp;consulted, for they are all more or less unique, and that on “Robin&nbsp;Hoode his death ” is of singular interest. The literary and artistic&nbsp;value of the Robin Hood ballads cannot be pronounced consider*</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
