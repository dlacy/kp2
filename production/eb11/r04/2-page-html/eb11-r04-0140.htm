<p><span class="font1">households the philosopher, generally a Greek, played the part of a director of consciences. The influence of these doctrines is&nbsp;shown in the humane provisions of the civil law as elaborated&nbsp;in the Antonine period, which did much to mitigate the lot of&nbsp;the slave and to smooth the process by which freedom might&nbsp;be attained.@@<sup>1</sup> Above all, a religious movement which drew its&nbsp;motive power not from Greek philosophy, but from Oriental&nbsp;mysticism, carried the human race far from its old moorings,&nbsp;and culminated in the triumph of Christianity. All the Eastern&nbsp;cults—whether of Cybele, of Isis, of the Syrian Baalim or of&nbsp;the Persian Mithras—had this in common, that they promised&nbsp;to their adherents redemption from the curse of the flesh and a&nbsp;glorious immortality after death; and this fact gave them an&nbsp;irresistible attraction for the disillusioned and overburdened&nbsp;subjects of the emperors. The religion of Mithras, whose&nbsp;doctrines were specially suited to the military temperament,&nbsp;made its way wherever the armies of the empire were stationed,&nbsp;and seemed likely at one moment to become universal; but&nbsp;it was forced to yield to Christianity, which refused to tolerate&nbsp;any rival, faced the empire with a claim to absolute dominion&nbsp;in the spiritual sphere, and at length made that claim good&nbsp;(see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Roman Religion; Mithras; Great Mother of the&nbsp;Gods).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Marcus Aurelius died in 180, and the reign of his worthless son, Commodus </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">(a.d.</span><span class="font1"> 180-93), was followed by a century of war&nbsp;and disorder, during which nothing but the stern rule&nbsp;of soldier emperors saved the empire from dissolution.&nbsp;The first and ablest of these was Septimius Severus&nbsp;(193-211), whose claims were disputed by Clodius</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Albinus in the West, and by Pescennius Niger in the East; in these struggles rival Roman forces, for the first time since the&nbsp;accession of Vespasian, exhausted each other in civil war.@@<sup>2&nbsp;</sup>Severus emphasized strongly the military character of the&nbsp;Principate; he abstained from seeking confirmation for his&nbsp;authority from the senate, and deprived that body of most of&nbsp;the share in the government which it still retained; he assumed&nbsp;the title of proconsul in Rome itself, made the prefect of the&nbsp;guard the vicegerent of his authority, and heaped privileges&nbsp;upon the army, which, although they secured its entire devotion&nbsp;to his family, impaired its efficiency as a fighting force and&nbsp;thus weakened Rome in face of the barbarian invader.@@<sup>3</sup> He&nbsp;succeeded in founding a short-lived dynasty, which ended with&nbsp;the attempt of the virtuous but weak Alexander (222-35) to&nbsp;restore the independence of the senate. This led to a military&nbsp;reaction, and the elevation of the brutal Maximinus, a Thracian&nbsp;peasant, to the throne. The disintegration of the empire was&nbsp;the natural result; for the various provincial armies put forward&nbsp;their commanders as claimants to the purple. A hundred ties&nbsp;bound them closely to the districts in which they were stationed;&nbsp;their permanent camps had grown into towns, they had families&nbsp;and farms; the unarmed provincials looked to them as their :&nbsp;natural protectors, and were attached to them by bonds of&nbsp;intermarriage and by long intercourse. Now that they found&nbsp;themselves left to repel by their own efforts the invaders from&nbsp;without, they reasonably enough claimed the right to ignore the&nbsp;central authority which was powerless to aid them, and to choose&nbsp;for themselves </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">imperatores</span><span class="font1"> whom they knew and trusted.&nbsp;These “ tyrants, ” as they were called when unsuccessful, sprang&nbsp;up in ever-increasing numbers, and weakened Rome’s power&nbsp;of resistance to the new enemies who were threatening her&nbsp;frontiers—the Alamanni and Franks, who broke through the&nbsp;German </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">limes</span><span class="font1"> in 236; the Goths, who crossed the Danube in&nbsp;247, raided the Balkan provinces, and defeated and slew the&nbsp;emperor, Decius, in 251, and the restored Persian kingdom of&nbsp;the Sassanidae (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Persia),</span><span class="font1"> whose rulers laid claim to all&nbsp;the Asiatic possessions of Rome and in 260 captured Antioch&nbsp;and made the emperor, Valerian, a prisoner. During the&nbsp;reign of Gallienus, the son of Valerian (260-68), the evil&nbsp;reached its height. The central authority was paralysed; the Romanized districts beyond the Rhine&nbsp;were irrevocably lost; the Persians were threatening&nbsp;to overrun the Eastern provinces; the Goths had formed a&nbsp;fleet of 500 sail which harried Asia Minor and even Greece&nbsp;itself, where Athens, Corinth, Sparta and Argos were sacked;&nbsp;and the legions on the frontiers were left to repel the enemies&nbsp;of Rome as best they could. A provincial empire was&nbsp;established by M. Cassianius Latimus Postumus in Gaul and&nbsp;maintained by his successors, M. Piavonius Victorinus and&nbsp;C. Pius Esuvius Tetricus.@@<sup>4</sup> Their authority was acknowledged,&nbsp;not only in Gaul and by the troops on the Rhine, but by the&nbsp;legions of Britain and Spain; and under Postumus at any rate&nbsp;(259-69) the existence of the Gallic Empire was justified by&nbsp;the repulse of the barbarians and by the restoration of peace&nbsp;and security to the provinces of Gaul. On the Danube, in&nbsp;Greece and in Asia Minor none of the “ pretenders ” enjoyed&nbsp;more than a passing success. In the Far East, the Syrian&nbsp;Odaenathus, prince of Palmyra@@<sup>5</sup> (g.r.), though officially only&nbsp;the governor of the East </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{dux Orientis)</span><span class="font1"> under Gallienus,&nbsp;drove the Persians out of Asia Minor and Syria,&nbsp;recovered Mesopotamia, and ruled Syria, Arabia,</span></p><div>

His young son Vaballathus (Wahab-allath) succeeded&nbsp;him in his titles, but* the real power was vested in his&nbsp;widow Zenobia, under whom not only the greater part of Asia&nbsp;Minor but even the province of Egypt was forcibly added to&nbsp;the dominions governed by the Palmyrene prince, who ceased&nbsp;to acknowledge the supremacy of Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Gallienus was murdered at Milan in 268, and after the brief reign of Claudius II. </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">(a.d.</span><span class="font1"> 268-70), who checked the advance&nbsp;of the Goths, Aurelian (270-75) restored unity to&nbsp;the distracted empire. Palmyra was destroyed and&nbsp;Zenobia led a prisoner to Rome (in 273) and in the next&nbsp;year the Gallic empire came to an end by the surrender&nbsp;of Tetricus. Aurelian, it is true, abandoned the province of Dacia, but the defences of the Danube were&nbsp;strengthened, and in 276 Probus repulsed the Franks and&nbsp;Alamanni, who had been pressing on the Rhine frontier for&nbsp;some forty years. Finally, Carus (282) recovered Armenia and&nbsp;Mesopotamia from the Persians and restored the frontier fixed&nbsp;by Septimius Severus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Although any serious loss of territory had been avoided, the storms of the 3rd century had told with fatal effect upon the&nbsp;general condition of the empire. The “ Roman&nbsp;peace ” had vanished; not only the frontier territories, but the central districts of Greece, Asia Minor,&nbsp;and even Italy itself, had suffered from the ravages&nbsp;of war, and the fortification of Rome by Aurelian&nbsp;was a significant testimony to the altered condition of&nbsp;affairs. War, plague and famine had thinned the population&nbsp;and crippled the resources of the provinces. On all sides,&nbsp;land was running waste, cities and towns were decaying, and&nbsp;commerce was paralysed. Only with the greatest difficulty&nbsp;were sufficient funds squeezed from the exhausted taxpayers&nbsp;to meet the increasing cost of the defence of the frontiers. The&nbsp;old established culture and civilization of the Mediterranean&nbsp;world rapidly declined, and the mixture of barbaric rudeness&nbsp;with Oriental pomp and luxury which marked the court, even&nbsp;of the better emperors, such as Aurelian, was typical of the&nbsp;general deterioration* which was accelerated by the growing;&nbsp;practice of settling barbarians on lands within the empire,&nbsp;and of admitting them freely to service in the Roman&nbsp;army.</span></p><div>
