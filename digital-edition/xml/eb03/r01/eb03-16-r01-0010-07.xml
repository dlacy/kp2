              <p>               <label>RAS-EL-FEEL</label>, one of the frontier provinces of Abyssinia, of which
                    the late celebrated traveller Mr Bruce was made governor while in that country.
                    It is but of ſmall extent, and in its moſt proſperous ſtate contained only <hi
                        rend="sub"> 39</hi> villages. The climate is extremely hot, in Mr Bruce’s
                    opinion one of the hotteſt in the world. He informs us, that on the firſt day of
                    March, at three o’clock in the afternoon, the thermometer ſtood at 114° in the
                    ſhade, and in the evening at 82° ; though at ſunriſe it
                    had been no higher than 61. Notwithſtand-ing this appearance of extreme heat,
                    however, the ſen-ſation was by no means intolerable ; they could hunt at
                    mid-day, and felt the evenings rather cold. The ſod is a fat, looſe, black
                    earth, which our author ſays is the ſame from 13° to 1 6° of north latitude-; at
                    leaſt till we come to the deſerts of Atbara, where the tropical rains ceaſe.
                    This conntry divides that of the Shan-galla into two parts, nearly equal. Theſe
                    people in-habit a belt of land about 60 miles broad, all along the northern
                    frontier of Abyſſinia, excepting two large gaps or ſpaces which have been left
                    open for the ſake of commerce, and which are inhabited by ſtrangers, to-keep the
                    Shangalla in awe. The latter trade in gold, which they pick up in the ſtreams as
                    it is waſhed down from the mountains ; for there are no mines in their country,
                    neither is there any gold in Abyſſinia, excepting wliat is imported from this or
                    ſome other country’. The Shangalla are the natural enemies of the inhabitants of
                    Ras-el-Feel, and much blood has been ſhed in the various incurſions they have
                    made upon one ano-ther ; thougſh of late thoſe of Ras-el-Feel, by the
                    aſſiſtance of the emperors, have been enabled to keep the Shangalla at bay.</p>
