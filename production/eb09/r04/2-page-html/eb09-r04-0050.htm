<p><span class="font0">novels of England. Among the most conspicuous of these writers was the celebrated Alexander Herzen, author of&nbsp;a striking romance, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Kto Vinovat ?</span><span class="font0"> (“ Who is to Blame ? ”),&nbsp;which he published under the assumed name of Iskander.&nbsp;The public career of Herzen is well known. The freedom&nbsp;of his opinions soon embroiled him with the authorities.&nbsp;He was exiled to Perm, and, seizing the first opportunity&nbsp;which offered itself of passing the Russian frontiers, he&nbsp;spent the remainder of his life chiefly in France and&nbsp;England, and died at Geneva in 1869. His celebrated&nbsp;journal </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Kolokol</span><span class="font0"> (“ The Bell ”) had a great circulation. A&nbsp;novelist of repute was Goncharoff, his two chief works&nbsp;being </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">A Common-place Story</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Oblomoff.</span><span class="font0"> Grigorovich&nbsp;has written </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Fisherman</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Emigrants.</span><span class="font0"> Pisemski,&nbsp;another novelist of the realistic type, is the author of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The&nbsp;Man of St Petersburg</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lieshi (“</span><span class="font0"> The Wood Demons”).&nbsp;Other novelists of celebrity are Saltikoff, who writes under&nbsp;the name of Stchedrin, and whose </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Provincial Sketches</span><span class="font0"> published a few years ago made a great sensation and have&nbsp;been followed by </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Letters to My Aunt</span><span class="font0"> and other works ;&nbsp;Dostoïevski (d. 1881), author of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Poor People, Letters from&nbsp;the House of the Dead</span><span class="font0"> (describing his impressions of Siberia,&nbsp;whither he was banished in consequence of a political&nbsp;offence), a powerful writer ; and Ostrovski. We may also&nbsp;add Ryeshetnikoff, who takes his characters from the&nbsp;humbler classes ; he died at the early age of thirty-nine.&nbsp;All these are disciples of the school of Dickens and&nbsp;Thackeray. Count A. Tolstoi, also celebrated as a dramatist, has written an historical novel entitled </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Prince Sert-brianni.</span><span class="font0"> Count L. Tolstoi is author of a work of fiction&nbsp;describing the war of 1812, which has gained great celebrity in Russia, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Voina i Mir</span><span class="font0"> (“War and Peace”). Novelists&nbsp;of the French school are Krestovski, Stebnitzki, and Bobo-rikin. During 1885 a new writer of merit, Kozolenko,&nbsp;appeared, who describes Siberian life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On September 4, 1883, died Ivan Turgenieff, aged sixty-four, the most eminent Russian novelist, and perhaps&nbsp;the only Russian man of letters universally known. His&nbsp;celebrity dates from his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Memoirs of a Sportsman,</span><span class="font0"> in which&nbsp;he appears as the advocate of the Russian </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">muzhik</span><span class="font0"> or peasant. He had witnessed in his youth many sad scenes at&nbsp;his own home, where his mother, a wealthy lady of the&nbsp;old school, treated her serfs with great cruelty. The poet&nbsp;devoted all his energies to procure their emancipation. This&nbsp;work was followed by a long array of tales, too well known&nbsp;to need recapitulation here, which have gained their author&nbsp;a European reputation, such as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dvorianskoe Gnezdo</span><span class="font0"> (“A&nbsp;Nest of Gentle People ”), one of the most pathetic tales&nbsp;in any language, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Nov</span><span class="font0"> (“Virgin Soil”), and others; nor&nbsp;can the minor tales of Turgenieff be forgotten, especially&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Mumu,</span><span class="font0"> a story based upon real life, for the dumb doorkeeper was a serf of his mother’s, and experienced her ill-treatment. His last two works were </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Poetry in Prose</span><span class="font0"> and&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Clara Milixh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In Belinski the Russians produced their best critic. For thirteen years (1834-1847) he was the Aristarchus&nbsp;of Russian literature and exercised a healthy influence.&nbsp;In his latter days he addressed a withering epistle to&nbsp;Gogol on the newly-adopted reactionary views of the&nbsp;latter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Since the time of Karamzin the study of Russian history has made great strides. He was followed by&nbsp;Nicholas Polevoi, who wrote what he called the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History of&nbsp;the Russian People,</span><span class="font0"> but his work was not received with&nbsp;much favour and has now fallen into oblivion. Polevoi&nbsp;was a self-educated man, the son of a Siberian merchant ;&nbsp;besides editing a well-known Russian journal </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The&nbsp;Telegraph,</span><span class="font0"> he was also the author of many plays, among&nbsp;others a translation of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hamlet.</span><span class="font0"> Since his time, however,&nbsp;the English dramatist has been produced in a more&nbsp;perfect dress by Kroneberg, Druzhinin, and others. In&nbsp;the year 1879 died Sergius Solovieff, whose </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History of&nbsp;Russia</span><span class="font0"> had reached its twenty-eighth volume, and&nbsp;fragments of the twenty-ninth were published after his&nbsp;death. This stupendous labour lacks something of the&nbsp;critical faculty, and perhaps may be described rather as a&nbsp;quarry of materials for future historians of Russia than an&nbsp;actual history. During 1885 the Russians have had to&nbsp;mourn the loss of Kostomaroff, the writer of many valuable&nbsp;monographs on the history of their country, of which those -on Bogdan Khmelnitzki and the False Demetrius deserve&nbsp;special mention. From 1847 to 1854 Kostomaroff, who&nbsp;had become obnoxious to the Russian Government, wrote&nbsp;nothing, having been banished to Saratoff, and forbidden to&nbsp;teach or publish. But after this time his literary activity&nbsp;begins again, and, besides separate works, the leading&nbsp;Russian reviews, such as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Old and New Russia, The Historical Messenger,</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger of Europe,</span><span class="font0"> contain&nbsp;many contributions from his pen of the highest value.&nbsp;In 1885 also died Constantine Kavelin, the author of&nbsp;many valuable works on Russian law, and Kalatcheff, who&nbsp;published a classical edition of the old Russian codes.&nbsp;Hovaiski and Gedeonoff have attempted to upset the&nbsp;general belief that the founders of the Russian empire were&nbsp;Scandinavians. Their opinions have been alluded to above&nbsp;(p. 87). A good history of Russia was published by&nbsp;Ustrialoff (1855), but his most celebrated work was his&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Tzarstvovanie Petra Velikago</span><span class="font0"> (“Reign of Peter the Great”);&nbsp;in this many important documents first saw the light, and&nbsp;the circumstances of the death of the unfortunate Alexis&nbsp;were made clear. Russian writers of history have not&nbsp;generally occupied themselves with any other subject than&nbsp;that of their own country, but an exception may be found&nbsp;in the writings of Granovski, such as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Abbé Suger</span><span class="font0"> (1849)&nbsp;and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Four Historical Portraits</span><span class="font0"> (1850). So also Kudriav-tzoff, who died in 1850, wrote on “The Fortunes of Italy,&nbsp;from the Fall of the Roman Empire of the West till its&nbsp;Reconstruction by Charlemagne.” He also wrote on “ The&nbsp;Roman Women as described by Tacitus.” We may add&nbsp;Kareyeff, now professor at AVarsaw, who has written on&nbsp;the condition of the French peasantry before the Revolution. Other writers on Russian history have been Pogo-dine, who compiled a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History of Russia till the invasion of&nbsp;the Mongols,</span><span class="font0"> 1871, and especially Zabielin, who has written&nbsp;a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History of Russian Life from the most Remote Times&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(1876), and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Private Lives of the CzaAnas</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Czars&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(1869 and 1872). Leshkoff has written a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History of Russian Law to the 18th Century,</span><span class="font0"> and Tchitcherin a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History of&nbsp;Provincial Institutions in Russia in the 17th Century</span><span class="font0"> (1856).&nbsp;To these must be added the work of Zagoskin, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History of&nbsp;Law in the State of Muscovy</span><span class="font0"> (Kazan, 1877). Prof. Michael&nbsp;Kovalevski, of the university of Moscow, is now publishing an excellent work on </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Communal Land Tenure,</span><span class="font0"> in which&nbsp;he investigates the remains of this custom throughout&nbsp;the world. Of the valuable history of Russia by Prof.&nbsp;Bestuzheff-Riumin (1872) one volume only has appeared;&nbsp;the introductory chapters giving an account of the sources&nbsp;and authorities of Russian history are of the highest value.&nbsp;It is the most critical history of Russia which has yet&nbsp;appeared. In 1885 Dubrovin published an excellent history of the revolt of Pugatcheff. The valuable work by&nbsp;Messrs Pipin and Spasovich, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History of Slavonic Literatures,</span><span class="font0"> is the most complete account of the subject, and&nbsp;has been made more generally accessible to Western students by the German translation of Pech. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History of&nbsp;Slavonic Literature</span><span class="font0"> by Schafarik, published in 1826, has&nbsp;long been antiquated. Previous to this, a history of&nbsp;Russian literature by Paul Polevoi had appeared, which has&nbsp;gone through two editions. It is modelled upon Chambers’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Cyclopaedia of English Literature.</span><span class="font0"> The account of</span></p>
