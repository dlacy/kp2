To compel them to return to the church of Rome by the violent methods of perſecution : or, a. That a reconciliation ſhould be made, upon fair, can-did, and equitable terms, by engaging each of the par-ties to temper their zeal with moderation, to abate re-¢iprocaliy the rigour of their pretenſions, and remit fomething of their reſpective claims. The third expedient was moſt generally approved of, being peculiarly agreeable to all who had at heart the welfare of the empire ; nor did the pope ſeem to look upon it either with averfion or contempt. Various conferences therefore were he’d between perſons eminent for piety and learning on both ſides ∙ and nothing was omitted that might have the leaſt tendency to calm the animoſities and heal the diviſions which reigned between the con. tending parties. But the differences were too great to admit of a reconciliation ; and therefore the votaries of Rome had recourſe to the powerful arguments of imperial edicts, and the force of the ſecular arm. Οη the i ρth of November, a ſevere decree was iſſued out by the expreſs order of the emperor (during the abſence <hi rend="italic">of</hi>  the Heſſian and Saxon princes, who were the chief ſupporters of the Proteſtant cauſe), in which every thing was manifeſtly adapted to deject the friends of religious liberty, excepting only a faint and dubious promiſe of engaging the pope to aſſemble a general council about fiκ months after the ſeparation oſ the diet. In this de-créé the dignity and excellence of the Popiſh religion were extolled beyond meaſure, a new degree of ſeverity and force was added to that which had been publiſhed at Worms againſt Luther aιjd his adherents, the changes which had been introduced into the doctrine and diſcipline of the Proteſtant churches were ſeverely eenſured, and a ſolemn order was addreſied to the princes,cities, and ſtates, who had thrown off the Papal yoke, to return to their allegiance to Rome, on pain of incurring the indig-nation and vengeance of the emperor as the patron and protector of the church. Of this formidable decree thc ejector of βaxonyand confederated princeswere noſooner informed, than they affembled in order to deliberate on the meaſures proper to be taken in ſuch a criſis. In the years 1530 and 1531 they met, fiiſt at Smalcald, and afterwards at Francfort, where they formed a ſo-lemn alliance and confederacy, with the intention of defending vigorouſly their religion and liberties againſt the dangers and encroachments with which they were threa-tened by the edict of Augſhurg, without attempting, however, any thing· offenſive againſt the votaries of Rome ; and into this confederacy they invited th¢ kings of England, France, Denmark, &amp;c. leaving no means unemployed that might corroborate and cement this important alliance,</p><p>This confederacy was at firſt oppoſed by Luther, from an apprehenſion of the calamities and troubles which it might produce j but at laſt, perceiving the neceſſity of it, he conſented ; though he uncharitably, as well as imprudently, refuſed to comprehend in it the followers of Zuinglius among thc Swiſs, together with the German ſtates and cities who had adopted the fen-timents and confeſſion of Bucer. In the invitation ad-dreffed to Henry VIII. of England, whom the con-federate princes were willing to declare the head and protector of their league, the following things, among</p><p>others, were «tpr¢ſtly ſtipulated : That the king fliauïd encourage, promote, and maintain, the true doctrine of Chriſt as it was contained in the confeſſion of Augf- ' burg, and deiend the fame at the next general council : that he ſhould not agree to any council lummoned bv the biſhop of Rome, but proteſt againſt it ; and neither ſubmit to its decrees, nor ſuffer them to be reſpected in his dominions: that he ſhould never allow the Roman pontiſt to have any pre-eminence or juriſdiction in his dominions ; that he ſhould advance 100,000 crowns for the uſe of the confederacy, and double that ſum if it became neceffary : all which articles the confederate pιinces were equally obliged to obſerve on their part.</p><p>I o theſe demands the king replied, that he would mam-tain and promote the true doctrine of Chriſt ; but, at the fame time, as the true ground of that doctrine lay only in the holy Scriptures, he would not accept at any one’s hand what ſhould he his own faith, or that of his kingdom j and therefore deſired that they would ſend over two learned men to confer with him, in order to promote a religious union between him and the confederates. However, he declared himſelf of their opinion with 1 egard to the meeting of a free general council, and promiſed to join with them in all fuch councils for the defence of the true doctrine ; hut thought the regula-tion of the ceremonial part of religion, being a matter of indifference, ought to be left to the choice of each ſovereign for his own dominions. After this the king gave them a ſecond anſwer more full and fatisfactory ; but afteι the execution oſ queen Anne, this negociatioπ came to nothing. Ο11 the one hand, the king grew cold when he perceived that the confederates were no longer of uſe to him in ſupporting the validity of hi<hi rend="sub">3 </hi>marriage 5 and, on the other hand, the German princes became ſenſible that they could never fucceed with. Henry unleſs they allowed him an abſolute dictatorſhip in matters of religion.</p><p>while every thing thus tended to an open war be-tween the two oppoſite parties, the elector Palatine, and the elector of Mentz, offered their mediation, and en-deavouιed to procure a reconciliation. I he emperor himſelf, for various reaſons, was at this time inclined to peace : for, on the one hand, he ſtood in need of ſuccours againſt the Turks, which the Proteſtant princes refuſed to grant as long as the edicts of worms and Augſhurg remained in force ; and, on the other, the election of his brother Ferdinand to the dignity of king of the Romans, which had been carried by a majority of votes at the diet of Cologne in 1531, was by the fame pιinces conteſted, as being contrary to the fundamental laws of the empire. In conſequence of all this, after many negociations and projects of reconciliation, a treaty of peace was concluded at Nuremberg in 1532, between the emperor and the Proteſtant princes, on the following conditions ; <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi>  That the latter ſhould furniſh a ſubſidy for carrying on the war againſt the Turks, and acknowledge Ferdinand lawful king of the Romans; and that the emperor on his part ſhould abrogate and annul the edicts of worms and Augſhurg·, and allow the Lutherans the free and undiſturbed exerciſe of their religious doctrine and diſcipline, until a rule of faith was fixed either in the free general council that was to be affembled in the fpace of ſix months, or in a diet of the empire.</p><p>f&gt;oon after the concluſion of the peace at Nuremberg</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
