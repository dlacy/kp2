However, they were diverted from this purpoſe by an information that Octavianus and Antony were now upon their march, with 40 legions to oppoſe them. Brutus now, therefore, moved to have their army paſs over into Greece and Macedonia, and there meet the enemy <hi rend="italic">γ</hi>  but Caſſius ſo far prevailed as to have the Rhodians and Lycians firſt reduced, who had refuſed their uſual contribution. This expe&lt;Jtion was immediately put in execution, and extraordinary contributions were raiſed by that means, the Rhodians having ſcarce any thing leſt but their lives *. The Lycians ſuffered ſtill more ſeverely ; for having ſhut themſelves up in the city of Xanthus, they defended the place againſt Brutus with ſuch fury, that neither his art nor intreaties could prevail upon them to ſurrender. At length, the town being ſet on fire, by their attempting to burn the works of the Romans, Brutus, inſtead of laying hold on this opportunity to ſtorm the place, made every effort to preſerve it, intreating his ſoldiers to try all means of extinguiſhing the fire : but the deſperate phrenzy of the citizens was not to be mollified. Far from thinking themſelves obliged to their generous enemy for the efforts which were made to ſave them, they reſolved to periſh in the flames. Wherefore, inſtead of extinguiſhing, they did all in their power to augment the fire, by throwing in wood, dry reeds, and all kinds of fuel. Nothing could exceed the diſtreſs of Brutus upon ſeeing the townſmea, thus reſolutely bent on deſtroying themſelves : he rede about the fortifications, ſtretching out his hands to the Xanthians, and conjuring them to have pity on therm· ſelves and their city ; but, inſenſible to his expoſtula-tions, they ruſhed into the flames with deſperate obſtinacy, and the whole ſoon became an heap of« undi-ſtinguiſhable ruin. At this horrid ſpectacle, Brutus offered a reward to every ſoldier who would bring him a Lycian alive. The number of thoſe whom it was poſſible to ſave from their own fury amounted to no more than 150.</p><p>Brutus and Caſſius met once more at Sardis, where, after the uiual ceremonies were paſſed between them, they reſolved to have a private conference together, when, after much altercation, they were at laſt perfectly reconciled. After which, night coming on, Caſſius invited Brutus and his friends to an entertainment. Upon retiring home, it was that Brutus, as Plutarch tells the ſtory, ſaw a ſpectre in his tent. It was in the dead of the night, when the whole camp was per* ſectly quiet, that Brutus was employed in reading by a lamp that was juſt expiring. On a ſudden he thought he heard a noiſe as if ſomebody entered ;. and looking towards the door, he perceived it open. A gigantic figure, with a frightful aſpect, ſtood before him, and &lt; continued to gaze upon him with filent ſeverity. At<hi rend="sup">, </hi>laſt Brutus had courage to ſpeak to it : “ Art thou a daemon or a mortal man? and why comeſt thou to me?”</p><p>“ Brutus,” replied the phantom, “ I am thy evil genius, thou ſhalt ſee me again at Philippi.” “ Well then,” anſwered Brutus, without being diſcompoſed,</p><p>“ we ſhall meet again.” Upon which the phantom vaniſhed ; and Brutus calling to his ſervants, allied if they had ſeen any thing ; to which replying in the negative, he again reſumed his ſtudies. But as he was ſtruck with ſo ſtrange an occurrence, he mentioned it the next day to Caſſius, who, being an Epicurean, aſeribed it to the effect of imagination too much exerciſed by vigilance and anxiety. Brutus appeared ſatisfied with this ſolution of his late terrors ; and, as Antony and Octavianus were now advanced into Macedonia, they ſoon after paſſed over into Thrace, and advanced to the city of Philippi, near which the forces of the triumvirs were poſted.</p><p>A battle ſoon enſued ; in which the republicans were defeated, and Caſſius killed, as is related in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Philippi.</hi></p><p>The firſt care of Brutus, when he became the ſole general, was to aſſemble the diſperſed troops of Caſſius, and animate them with freſh hopes of victory. As they had loſt all they poſſeſſed by the plundering of their camp, he promiſed them 2000 denarii each man to make up their lofles. This once more inſpired them with new ardour ; they admired the liberality of their general, and with loud ſhouts proclaimed his former intrepidity. Still, however, he had not confidence ſufficient to face the adverſary, who offered him battle the enſuing day. His aim was to ſtarve his enemies, who were in extreme want of proviſions, their fleet having been lately defeated. But his ſingle opinion was over-ruled by the reſt of his army, who now grew every day more confident of their ſtrength, and more arrogant to their new general. He was, therefore, at laft, after a reſpite of 20 days, obliged to comply with their ſolicitations to try the fate of the battle. Both armies being drawn out, they remained a long while oppoſite to each other without offering to engage. It is ſaid that he himſelſ had loſt much of his natural ardour by having again ſeen the ſpectre the night preceding : however, he encouraged his men as much as poſſible, and gave the ſignal for battle within three hours of fun-ſet. Fortune again declared againſt him; and the two triumviri expreſsly ordered by no means to ſuffer the general to eſcape, for fear he ſhould renew the war. Thus the whole body of the enemy ſeemed chiefly intent on Brutus alone, and his capture ſeemed inevitable. In this deplorable exigence, Lucilius his friend reſolved, by his own death, to effect the general’s delivery., Upon perceiving a body of Thracian horſe cloſely purſuing Brutus, and juſt upon the point of taking him, he boldly threw himſelf in their way, telling them that he was. Brutus. The Thracians, overjoyed with ſo great a prize, immediately diſpatched ſome of their companions, with the news of their ſucceſs, to the army. Upon which, the ardour of the purſuit now abating, Antony marched out to meet his priſoner ; ſome ſilently deploring the fate of ſo virtuous a man ; others reproaching that mean deſire of life for which he conſented to undergo captivity. Antony now feeing the Thracians approach, began to prepare ~ himſelf for the interview ; but the faithful Lucilius, advancing with a cheerful air, owned· the deceit that he had put upon him : on which the triumvir, ſtruck with ſo much fidelity, pardoned him upon the ſpot; and from -, that time forward loaded him with benefits, and hαfo∙ noured him. with his friendſhip..</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
