<p><span class="font2">escaped to Belgium, where he issued a pamphlet defending his action during the Commune. On his failure to appear before&nbsp;the court he was condemned to death, and remained in Belgium&nbsp;until 1879, when he was included in the amnesty proclaimed by&nbsp;Grévy. During his exile he continued his active collaboration&nbsp;on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">La République française.</span><span class="font2"> In 1873 he fought a duel with Paul&nbsp;de Cassagnac, and he acted as second to Clémenceau more&nbsp;than once. He energetically defended the republic against the&nbsp;Boulangist agitation, and took an equally courageous part in the&nbsp;Dreyfus affair. In the Picquart-Henry duel he was second to&nbsp;Colonel Picquart. He succeeded Clémenceau as editor of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Aurore,</span><span class="font2"> in which Zola’s letter “J’accuse ” bad appeared, and&nbsp;was president of the Association of Republican Journalists. In&nbsp;1903 he became senator for Corsica, and died on the 10th of&nbsp;August 1908.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In addition to his purely political writings, Arthur Ranc published political novels of the Second Empire, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sous l<sup>,</sup>empire</span><span class="font1"> (1872) and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Le&nbsp;roman d'une conspiration</span><span class="font1"> (1868).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">RANCÉ, ARMAND JEAN LE BOUTHILLIER DE </span><span class="font1">(1626-</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"></span><span class="font2">1700), founder of the Trappist Cistercians. He was born in Paris of a noble and influential family of Normandy; hence,&nbsp;being destined to the ecclesiastical state, he was when ten years&nbsp;old commendatory abbot of La Trappe and two other abbeys,&nbsp;prior of two priories, and canon of Nôtre Dame, Paris. At&nbsp;twelve he published a translation of Anacreon. He went&nbsp;through his course of theological studies with great distinction,&nbsp;defeating Bossuet at the Baccalaureat in theology. He was&nbsp;ordained in 1651, and embarked on the ambitious and worldly&nbsp;career of a court abbé in the days of Louis XIV. But after a&nbsp;few years he underwent a complete change of life, and in 1662&nbsp;he retired to his abbey of La Trappe, of which he became&nbsp;regular abbot in 1664 and introduced an austere reform (see&nbsp;Trappists). The best known episode of his subsequent fife&nbsp;was the “ Contestation ’’ with Mabillon on the lawfulness of&nbsp;monks devoting themselves to study, which De Rancé denied.&nbsp;He resigned his abbacy in 1695, owing to declining health, and&nbsp;died in 1700.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">RANCH, a term in current usage among the English-speaking peoples for a large farm, particularly one for cattle or horse-breeding. The word came into use in this application in the&nbsp;western states of North America, and was an adaptation of&nbsp;the Spanish-American </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">rancho,</span><span class="font2"> herdsmen’s huts; in Spanish a&nbsp;gathering of people having their meals in common, a mess.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RANCHI, a town and district of British India, in the Chota Nagpur division of Bengal. The town, which is situated on&nbsp;the Chota Nagpur plateau, about 2100 ft. above sea-level, is&nbsp;the headquarters of both the division and the district. Pop.&nbsp;(1901) 25,970. It is an important centre of local trade and&nbsp;the headquarters of the German Lutheran mission. There are&nbsp;a high school and an industrial school, and it is proposed to&nbsp;found here a residential college for all Bengal. The cantonments, formerly called Doranda, accommodate a detachment&nbsp;of native infantry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The District of Ranchi, formerly called Lohardaga after the town which was its headquarters, has an area of 7128 sq. m.&nbsp;It consists of two tablelands, of which the higher rises to about&nbsp;2000 ft. The whole area is broken by hills and undulations,&nbsp;which are terraced for rice. The steep slopes are covered&nbsp;with a dense forest, where wild animals still abound, but no&nbsp;profit is derived from the timber. The principal rivers are the&nbsp;Subanarekhà and the North and South Koel. In 1901 the&nbsp;population was 1,187,925, showing an increase of 5·2% in the&nbsp;decade. Christians form 10% of the total. The district was&nbsp;affected by the famine of 1896-1897, and still more severely by&nbsp;that of 1900. Rice is everywhere the staple crop, with some&nbsp;millets and pulses. Tea cultivation has been introduced, but&nbsp;does not flourish. The only industry on a large scale is the&nbsp;manufacture of shellac. Myrobalans are also exported. Iron&nbsp;and soapstone are worked in small quantities. Hopes of profitable gold-mining in the quartz veins of the schist formation&nbsp;have proved abortive. There is no railway in the district,&nbsp;though surveys have been made to connect with the Bengal-Nagpur line.</span></p><h2><a name="caption1"></a><span class="font2">See F. B.

<p><span class="font2">RAND, a Dutch word meaning border, edge, used in South Africa to designate a low rounded range of hills; specifically&nbsp;it is an abbreviated form of Witwatersrand, an elevated ridge&nbsp;in the southern Transvaal, forming the water-parting between&nbsp;the basins of the Orange and Limpopo. The Rand is famous&nbsp;for its gold-bearing reefs (see Gold), and the word is often&nbsp;used as a synonym for the mining industry carried on over a&nbsp;great part of its area, or for Johannesburg (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">q.v.</span><span class="font2">), the city which&nbsp;that industry created.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RANDALL, SAMUEL JACKSON (1828-1890), American politician, was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on the&nbsp;10th of October 1828. He was educated in the public schools&nbsp;and in the University Academy, Philadelphia. In 1858-1859&nbsp;he was a Democratic member of the state Senate. During the&nbsp;Civil War he served as a private in the Union army for ninety&nbsp;days in 1861, and two years later took part in the Gettysburg&nbsp;campaign as a volunteer. From 1863 until his death he was&nbsp;a Democratic representative in Congress. During the session of&nbsp;1874-1875 he first gained a national reputation by the masterful&nbsp;manner in which he prevented the Republican majority from&nbsp;passing the Force Bill or Federal Election law. Under his&nbsp;leadership discipline and party harmony were established&nbsp;among the Democrats for the first time after the Civil War.&nbsp;He was speaker of the House from December 1876 to March&nbsp;1881, during a period marked by rancorous debates concerning&nbsp;the disputed Hayes-Tilden presidential election. With the&nbsp;disappearance of the Reconstruction questions and the emergence of the tariff issue, however, his influence began to wane.&nbsp;As the leader of the Protectionist wing of the party he was&nbsp;superseded by the tariff reform advocates, such as John G.&nbsp;Carlisle, William R. Morrison, and Roger Q. Mills, Carlisle&nbsp;defeating him for the speakership in 1883. He died in Washington, D.C., on the 13th of April 1890.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RANDAN, a name for a boat rowed by three persons, stroke and bow using a single oar each and the central person a pair of&nbsp;sculls. The word is of unknown origin, and can hardly be connected with a slang term for a row or spree, which is found as&nbsp;early as the beginning of the 18th century and is generally taken&nbsp;as a variation of “ random,’’ haphazard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RANDAZZO, a town of Sicily, in the province of Catania, at the N. foot of Mount Etna, 43 m. N. by W. of Catania by rail,&nbsp;and 26 m. direct. Pop. (1901) 11,798. It has considerable&nbsp;remains of architecture of the 13th and 14th centuries, including&nbsp;three Norman churches and some interesting palaces. The&nbsp;former contain some fine sculptures and goldsmith’s work&nbsp;(Mauceri in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">L'Arte,</span><span class="font2"> 1906, 185). It is the nearest town to the&nbsp;summit of Etna (9 m.), and is one of the points from which the&nbsp;ascent may be made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RANDERS, a town of Denmark, capital of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">amt</span><span class="font2"> (county) of its name in Jutland, on the Gudenaa at the point where it&nbsp;begins to widen into Randers Fjord, an inlet of the Cattegat.&nbsp;Pop. (1901) 20,057. The town is 15 m. from the open&nbsp;Cattegat and the harbour has 15 ft. depth on the bar. The&nbsp;chief exports are butter and eggs; the chief imports sugar,&nbsp;petroleum, coal and iron. Two railways run north to Aalborg,&nbsp;continuing the main East Jutland fine from the south, and an&nbsp;eastward branch serves Grenaa and Aebeltoft on the coast.&nbsp;Though a place of considerable antiquity—being mentioned in&nbsp;1086 as the meeting-place of insurgents against Knud, the saint&nbsp;—Randers has few remains of old buildings and bears the stamp&nbsp;of a compact, modem manufacturing town that owes its importance to its distilleries, manufactories of gloves, railway&nbsp;carriages, &amp;c. St Marten’s church dates from the 14th century,&nbsp;but was frequently altered and enlarged down to 1870. It has&nbsp;good woodwork of the 17th century. The high school is housed</span></p>
