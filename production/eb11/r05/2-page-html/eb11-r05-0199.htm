As a result, the climate is very humid, the rainfall being probably at least ioo in. annually, and&nbsp;the slopes are furrowed by numberless streams, the most important fed by the glaciers of the upper region, and afterwards&nbsp;flowing in deeply cut valleys between the outer spurs. From&nbsp;the innermost recesses between Mounts Stanley, Speke and&nbsp;Baker, the main branches of the Mobuku descend to the east,&nbsp;while the four principal streams on the west unite to form the&nbsp;Butagu, the drainage on both sides ultimately finding its way&nbsp;to the Semliki, either directly or through Lake Dweru and&nbsp;the Albert Edward Nyanza.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As in other ranges of Central Africa the vegetation displays well-marked zones, varying with the altitude; but owing to&nbsp;the lower level to which the cloud descends on the west&nbsp;(probably an outcome of the general climatic régime of Central&nbsp;Africa, as the range lies between the east African plateau&nbsp;and the relatively low-lying basin of the Congo), the limits of&nbsp;the several zones reach a lower level on the west than on the&nbsp;east. They have been defined as follows by AIr R. B. Woosnam&nbsp;of the British Museum scientific expedition of 1006-7:—</span></p>

The boundaries between the zones are not of course hard and fast&nbsp;lines, but merely indicate the levels between which the&nbsp;respective forms are specially characteristic, though they&nbsp;occur also in higher or lower zones. The forest zone is perhaps&nbsp;the best marked, being visible from a distance as a dark ring.&nbsp;On the west it merges in part with the low-lying forest of the&nbsp;SemIiki valley. Owing to the abundance of moisture, mosses,&nbsp;hepaticae and lichens are prevalent in several of the zones,&nbsp;and bogs, with Vaccinium and other low-growing plants, are&nbsp;common above the forest zone. IIeIichrysums are abundant&nbsp;in the zone immediately below the snow, where they form large&nbsp;bushes. The larger mammals are found chiefly on the lower&nbsp;slopes, but bushbuck, pigs, leopards, monkeys, a hyrax and a&nbsp;serval cat occur at higher altitudes. The birds include kites,&nbsp;buzzards, ravens, sun-birds, touracos, a large swift, and various&nbsp;warblers and other small kinds. The upper limit of human&nbsp;settlement, with cultivation of colocasia and beans, has been&nbsp;placed at 6700 ft.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Attempts have been made to identify the range with the “ Mountains of the Moon ” of Ptolemy and other ancient writers,&nbsp;the snows of which were thought to feed the Nile lakes. But&nbsp;in view of the extreme vagueness of the statements and the&nbsp;absence of all detailed knowledge of the geography, it is far&nbsp;more likely that the rumours of snowy mountains really&nbsp;referred to Mounts Kenya and Kilimanjaro, especially as they&nbsp;seem to have been obtained rather from the east coast than&nbsp;from the direction of the Nile. In modern times the existence&nbsp;of a snowy range in this part of Africa was first made known&nbsp;by Sir Henry Stanley during the Emin Pasha relief expedition&nbsp;of 1887-89, though hints of high mountains had been obtained&nbsp;by Stanley himself and by Romolo Gessi in 1876 and by others&nbsp;from the neighbourhood of the Albert Nyanza. Stanley named&nbsp;the main mass Ruwenzori, and outlying eastern peaks he&nbsp;called Mt. Gordon Bennett, Mt. Lawson, Mt. Edwin Arnold,&nbsp;&amp;c.—the last named lying N.E. of Lake Dweru. Subsequently&nbsp;Stanley’s own name was given to the chief summit. One of&nbsp;Stanley’s officers, Lieut. Stairs, ascended the western slopes&nbsp;to over 10,000 ft. in 1889, and partial ascents were afterwards made by Dr Stuhlmann, Mr Scott Elliot, Mr J. E.&nbsp;Moore, Sir Harry Johnston, Atr Douglas Freshfield, and others.&nbsp;Early in 1906 some of the secondary ridges above the snowline were scaled by Messrs Grauer, Tegart and Maddox, and&nbsp;by Dr Wollaston and other members of the British Museum&nbsp;expedition, while later in the year the duke of the Abruzzi led&nbsp;a well-equipped expedition, including various scientists, to&nbsp;the upper parts of the range, and with the help of trained&nbsp;Alpine guides ascended not only the culminating twin summits&nbsp;(which he named Margharita and Alexandra after the queens&nbsp;of Italy and England), but all the principal snow-cIad peaks.&nbsp;The expedition produced for the first time a detailed map of&nbsp;the upper region, and threw much light on the geology and&nbsp;natural history of the range.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RUYSBROEK </span><span class="font0">(OrRuYSBROECK)<sub>i</sub>JANVAN </span><span class="font1">(1293-1381), Dutch mystic, was born at Ruysbroek, near Brussels, in 1293. In&nbsp;1317 he was ordained priest and became vicar of St Gudule,&nbsp;Brussels. When sixty years of age he withdrew with a few&nbsp;companions to the monastery of Groenendael, near Waterloo,&nbsp;giving himself to meditation and mystical writing, and to a&nbsp;full share of the practical tasks of the society. He was known as&nbsp;the “ Ecstatic Teacher,” and formed a link between the Friends&nbsp;of God and the Brothers of the Common Life, sects which helped&nbsp;to bring about the Reformation. Ruysbroek insisted that&nbsp;“ the soul finds God in its own depths,” and noted three stages&nbsp;of progress in what he called “ the spiritual ladder ” of Christian&nbsp;attainment: (1) the active life, (2) the inward life, (3) the&nbsp;contemplative life. He did not teach the fusion of the self in&nbsp;God, but held that at the summit of the ascent the soul still&nbsp;preserves its identity. His works, of which the most important&nbsp;were </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">De vera Contemplatione</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">De septem gradibus amoris,</span><span class="font1"> wære&nbsp;published in 1848 at Hanover; also </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Reflections from the Mirror of&nbsp;a Mystic</span><span class="font1"> (1906) and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Die Zierde der geistlichen Hochzeit</span><span class="font1"> (1901).</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RUYSDAEL (or Ruisdaal), JACOB VAN (c. 1628-1682), the most celebrated of the Dutch landscapists, w’as born at&nbsp;Haarlem. He appears to have studied under his father Izaak&nbsp;Ruysdael, a landscape painter, though other authorities make&nbsp;him the pupil of Berghcm and of Albert van Everdingen.&nbsp;The earliest date that appears on his paintings and etchings is&nbsp;1645. Three years later he was admitted a member of the&nbsp;gild of St Luke in Haarlem; in 1659 he obtained the freedom&nbsp;of the city of Amsterdam, and in 1668 his name appears there&nbsp;as a witness to the marriage of Hobbema. During his lifetime&nbsp;his works were little appreciated, and he seems to have suffered&nbsp;from poverty. In 1681 the sect of the Mennonites, with whom&nbsp;he was connected, petitioned the council of Haarlem for his&nbsp;admission into the almshouse of the town, and there the artist&nbsp;died on the 14th of March 1682.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The works of Ruysdael may be studied in the Louvre and the National Gallery, London, and in the collections at the&nbsp;Hague, Amsterdam, Berlin, and Dresden. His favourite&nbsp;subjects are simple woodland scenes, similar to those of Everdingen and Hobbema. He is especially noted as a painter of&nbsp;trees, and his rendering of foliage, particularly of oak leafage,&nbsp;is characterized by the greatest spirit and precision. His views&nbsp;of distant cities, such as that of Haarlem in the possession of&nbsp;the marquess of Bute, and that of Katwdjk in the Glasgow&nbsp;Corporation Galleries, clearly indicate the influence of Rembrandt. He frequently paints coast-scenes and sea-pieces,&nbsp;but it is in his rendering of lonely forest glades that we find&nbsp;him at his best. The subjects of certain of his mountain&nbsp;scenes seem to be taken from Norway, and have led to the&nbsp;supposition that he had travelled in that country. We have,&nbsp;however, no record of such a journey, and the works in question&nbsp;are probably merely adaptations from the landscapes of Van</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
