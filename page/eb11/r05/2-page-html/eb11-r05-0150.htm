<p><span class="font0">public generally, as the tsar’s equal in rank and dignity. His immediate successors, being men of humble origin and submissive character, made no pretensions to such an exalted&nbsp;position, but when the haughty, ambitious and energetic Nikon,&nbsp;who enjoyed in large measure the affection and favour of the&nbsp;devout Tsar Alexius, became patriarch, he took Philaret as his&nbsp;model, and propounded, like the popes in western Europe,&nbsp;the doctrine that the spiritual is higher than the temporal&nbsp;power, the former corresponding to the sun and the latter to&nbsp;the moon in the firmament. In accordance with this view he&nbsp;declared that the patriarch was the image of Christ, the head&nbsp;of the Church, and was therefore subject to no earthly authority,&nbsp;and he complained of the tsar’s interference in ecclesiastical&nbsp;affairs. His pretensions and his haughty dictatorial manner at&nbsp;last exhausted the tsar’s patience, and he was formally deposed&nbsp;and exiled to a monastery. As no voice was raised in his defence&nbsp;and the decision of the ecclesiastical council which condemned&nbsp;him was universally accepted without protest, we must conclude that the conflict was not really between Church and State&nbsp;but simply between the haughty, ambitious Patriarch Nikon&nbsp;and the devout, long-suffering Tsar Alexius. The incident&nbsp;afforded a new proof, where no proof was required, that the&nbsp;autocratic power in Russia was supreme. In order to prevent&nbsp;such incidents in future, Peter the Great abolished the patriarchate altogether, and entrusted the administration of the&nbsp;Church to a synod entirely dependent on the government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Much more important in its consequences was Nikon’s activity as an ecclesiastical reformer. During the Russian Dark Ages&nbsp;certain clerical errors had crept into the liturgical books&nbsp;and certain peculiarities had been adopted in the ritual.&nbsp;These had been detected and pointed out by learned&nbsp;ecclesiastics of Kiev, where some of the ancient learning of&nbsp;Byzantium had been preserved, and Nikon determined to make&nbsp;the necessary corrections. He determined also to introduce into&nbsp;the Church many desirable reforms. His project was approved&nbsp;by an ecclesiastical council and was supported by the tsar, but it&nbsp;met with violent opposition from a large section of the clergy, and&nbsp;it alarmed the ignorant masses, who regarded any alterations&nbsp;in the ritual, however insignificant they might be, as heretical&nbsp;and very dangerous to salvation. When put into execution&nbsp;the project produced in the Russian Church a great schism and&nbsp;numerous fantastic sects. The cruel persecutions instituted by&nbsp;the authorities with a view to securing conformity increased&nbsp;the number and fanaticism of the schismatics and heretics, and&nbsp;created among them a widespread belief that the reign of&nbsp;Antichrist, foretold in the Apocalypse, was at hand. In support&nbsp;of this idea, independently of the ecclesiastical innovations,&nbsp;many significant facts could be adduced. Numerous foreigners&nbsp;had been allowed to settle in Moscow and to build for themselves a heretical church, and their strange unholy customs had&nbsp;been adopted by not a few courtiers and great dignitaries.&nbsp;Matveyev, the most influential of the boyars, had married a&nbsp;foreigner who conversed freely with her husband’s male friends,&nbsp;contrary to the Muscovite notions of respectability and decorum,&nbsp;and his house, in which the tsar was a frequent visitor, was&nbsp;furnished and decorated in foreign fashion. Books on mundane&nbsp;•subjects, not at all conducive to the spiritual edification of the&nbsp;faithful, were read by the tsar’s counsellors, and a theatre had&nbsp;been erected, in which the tsar often witnessed very unedifying&nbsp;dramas and ballets. Worst of all, the Orthodox tsar occasionally abandoned the decorous flowing robes of his venerated&nbsp;ancestors, and appeared publicly in the unseemly costume of&nbsp;heretical foreigners, whilst his consort, when carried through&nbsp;the streets in a Utter, did not conceal her face from the public&nbsp;gaze. Such innovations troubled deeply the pious souls of the&nbsp;conservative Muscovites, and confirmed them in their repugnance&nbsp;to. accept the ecclesiastical reforms. Though this original&nbsp;fanaticism gradually cooled and the rigorists had to make many&nbsp;concessions to the exigencies of practical life, a large section of the&nbsp;Russian people remained outside the official fold, so that at the&nbsp;present day, if we may credit the most competent authorities,&nbsp;the schismatics and heretics number more than twelve millions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">While the Muscovites of the upper classes were thus beginning to abandon their old oriental habits, their government was&nbsp;preparing to make a political evolution of a similar kind.&nbsp;Notwithstanding the efforts of the Poles and the&nbsp;Military Orders to exclude Russia from the shores of the&nbsp;Baltic and keep her in a state of isolation, she was coming slowly&nbsp;into closer relations with central and western Europe. The&nbsp;emperor, the governments of England, Holland, France and&nbsp;Sweden, and even the Grand Turk made advances to the tsar.&nbsp;Some of them wished to gain him as an ally against their rivals,&nbsp;whilst others hoped to obtain from him commercial privileges&nbsp;and permission to trade directly with Persia. The political&nbsp;and the commercial proposals were alike received with coldness,&nbsp;because the native diplomatists had aims which could not be&nbsp;reconciled completely with the policy of any other country,&nbsp;and the native merchants were afraid of foreign competition.&nbsp;The negotiations gave, therefore, little tangible result, but they&nbsp;helped to prepare the way for the new order of things which was&nbsp;soon to be introduced by Alexius’s son, Peter the Great.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Before reaching the new order of things, the country had to pass through an internal crisis similar to that which followed&nbsp;the death of Ivan the Terrible, but not nearly so severe. Alexius&nbsp;had been twice married and had left several children by each of&nbsp;his wives, and, as generally happened in such cases, a struggle&nbsp;for power ensued between the two rival families. The late tsar’s&nbsp;eldest son, Theodore, was weak in health and died&nbsp;without male issue after an uneventful reign of six&nbsp;years (1676-82). As the second son, Ivan, next in&nbsp;the order of succession, was almost an imbecile, the third son,&nbsp;Peter, born of the second marriage, was proclaimed tsar, and his&nbsp;maternal relations became the dominant faction, but their&nbsp;triumph was of very * short duration. An ambitious, energetic sister of Ivan, well known in Russian history as Sophia&nbsp;Alexeyevna,instigated the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">stryeltsi(slrelitz),</span><span class="font0"> as the troops&nbsp;of the unreformed standing army were called, to upset&nbsp;the arrangement. After making a tumult in the Kremlin and assassinating several of the men in power, they insisted&nbsp;that Ivan should be proclaimed tsar conjointly with&nbsp;Peter, and that Sophia should act as regent during the&nbsp;minority of the two young sovereigns. She accepted&nbsp;unhesitatingly the difficult and dangerous post, and ruled autocratically for seven years (1682-S9), but this did not satisfy her&nbsp;ambition. Having discovered that Peter, who had reached the&nbsp;age of seventeen, was thinking of taking the administration into&nbsp;his own hands, she conspired against him with the commander&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">stryeltsi</span><span class="font0"> and some of his maternal relations; but she was&nbsp;circumvented by the rival faction and interned in a convent, and&nbsp;Peter’s mother was put in her place. The importance of these&nbsp;incidents, which are very characteristic of poUtical life in the&nbsp;tsardom of Muscovy, will appear in the sequel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If Peter really thought of taking the administration into his own hands, he very soon abandoned the idea and returned to&nbsp;the irregular suburban life he had led during his half-sister’s regency—associating with foreigners who could&nbsp;teach him the mechanical arts of the West, drilling&nbsp;troops, building and saihng boats, forming projects&nbsp;for the creation of a great navy, indulging pubUcly in&nbsp;Bacchanalian revels and boisterous amusements not at all&nbsp;to the taste of his pious countrymen, and appearing in Moscow&nbsp;as Orthodox tsar only on great ceremonial occasions. Already&nbsp;the desire to make his country a great naval power was becoming&nbsp;his ruling passion, and when he found by experience that the&nbsp;White Sea, Russia’s sole maritime outlet, had great practical&nbsp;inconveniences as a naval base, he revived the project of getting&nbsp;a firm footing on the shores of the Black Sea or the Baltic.&nbsp;At first he gave the preference to the former,- and with the&nbsp;aid of a flotilla of small craft, constructed on a tributary of the&nbsp;Don, he succeeded in capturing Azov from the Turks. Greatly&nbsp;elated by this success, he recommended to the council of boyars&nbsp;the construction of a powerful fleet for carrying on war with&nbsp;the infidel, and he himself went abroad to learn more about&nbsp;shipbuilding and useful foreign inventions, and to prepare</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
