the blue expanſe of air or atmoſphere. For the reaſon of its blue colour and concave figure, ſee <hi rend="smallcaps">Optics.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sky,</hi> one of the greateſt of the Weſtern Islands of Scotland, ſo called from <hi rend="italic">Skianach,</hi> which in the Erſe dialect ſignifies <hi rend="italic">winged,</hi> becauſe the two promontories of Valerneſs and Troterniſh, by which it is bounded on the north-weſt and north-eaſt, are ſuppoſed to reſemble wings. The iſland lies between the ſhire of Roſs and the weſtern part of Lewis. According to the computation of Mr Pennant, Dr Johnſon, and Dr Campbell, it is 60 miles in length, and nearly the ſame in width where broadeſt ; according to others it is 50 miles in length, and in ſome places 30 broad. The iſland of Sky is divided between two proprietors ; the ſouthern part belongs to the laird of Macleod, ſaid to be lineally deſcended from Leod ſon to the black prince of Man ; the northern diſtrict, or barony of Troterniſh, is the property of Lord Macdonald, whoſe anceſtor was Do-<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0526.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s04-0520"/>
nald, king or lord of the Iſles, and chief of the numerous clan of Macdonalds, who are counted the moſt warlike of all the Highlanders. Sky is part of the ſhire of Inverneſs, and formerly belonged to the dioceſe of the Iſles : on the ſouth it is parted from the main land by a channel three leagues in breadth ; tho’, at the ferry of Glenelly, it is ſo narrow that a man may be heard calling for the boat from one side to the other. Sky is well provided with a variety of excellent bays and harbours.</p><p>The face of the country is roughened with mountains, ſome of which are ſo high as to be covered with ſnow on the top at midſummer ; in general, their ſides are clothed with heath and graſs, which afford good paſturage for ſheep and black cattle. Between the mountains there are ſome fertile valleys, and the greater part of the land towards the ſea-coaſt is plain and arable. The iſland is well watered with a great number of rivers, above 30 of which afford ſalmon ; and ſome of them produce black muſcles in which pearls are bred, particularly the rivers Kilmartin and Ord : Martin was aſſured by the proprietor of the former, that a pearl hath been found in it valued at 20 l. Sterling. Here is alſo a conſiderable number of freſh- water lakes well ſtored with trout and eels. The largeſt of theſe lakes takes its denomination from St Columba, to whom is dedicated a chapel that ſtands upon a ſmall iſle in the middle of the lake. Sky likewiſe affords ſeveral cataracts, that roar down the rocks with great impetuoſity. That the iſland has been formerly covered with woods, appears from the large trunks of fir and other trees daily dug out of the bogs and peat- marſhes in every part of this country.</p><p><note anchored="false" n="1" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>Statistical Account of Scotland, vol. xvi. p. 140.</p></note> From the height of the hills, and proximity of the ſea, the air ſeldom continues long of the ſame temperature ; ſometimes it is dry, oftener moiſt, and in the latter end of winter and beginning of ſpring cold and piercing ; at an average, three days in twelve throughout the year ſcarcely free from rain, far leſs from clouds. Theſe, attracted by the hills, ſometimes break in uſeful and refreſhing ſhowers ; at other times ſuddenly burſting, pour down their contents with tremendous noiſe, in impetuous torrents that deluge the plains below, and render the ſmalleſt rivulet impaſſable ; which, together with the ſtormy winds ſo common in this country in the months of Auguſt and September, frequently blaſt the hopes, and diſappoint the expectations, of the husbandman. Snow has been often known to lie on the ground from three to ſeven weeks ; and on the higheſt hills, even in the middle of June, ſome ſpots of it are to be ſeen. To this various temperature of the air, and uncertainty of weather, the fevers and agues, headache, rheumatiſms, colds, and dyſenteries, which are the prevailing diſtempers, may be aſcribed. That it is far, however, from being unwholeſome, is ſufficiently evinced by experience ; for the inhabitants are, in general, as ſtrong and healthy, and arrive at as advanced an age, as thoſe who live in milder climates, and under a ſerener ſky. The gout is ſcarcely known in this iſland.</p><p>The soil is generally black, though it likewiſe affords clay of different colours ; ſuch as white, red, and blue, and in ſome places fuller’s earth. It is, however, much leſs adapted for agriculture than for paſture, and ſeldom, unleſs in very good years, ſupplies itſelf with a ſufficiency of provisions. Yet, though the soil is not very fertile or rich, it might with proper management be made to produce more plentiful crops. But the generality of the farmers are ſo prejudiced in favour of old cuſtoms, and indeed ſo little inclined to induſtry, that they will not eaſily be prevailed on to change them for better ; eſpecially if the alteration or amendment propoſed be attended with expence. Therefore, with reſpect to improvements in agriculture, they are ſtill much in the ſame ſtate as they were 20 or 30 years ago. Ploughs, on a new and improved model, that in compariſon to the advantages derived from them might be had at a moderate expence, have lately been introduced into ſeveral diſtricts around, where their good effects are manifeſt, in improving the crops and diminishing the labour of man and beaſt ; but the laird of Raaſay and one other gentleman are the only perſons in Portree that have uſed them. The <hi rend="italic">caſcroim,</hi> a crooked kind of ſpade, is almoſt the only inſtrument for labouring the ground uſed among the ordinary claſs of tenants. The average crops of corn are 8000 bolls.</p><p>When Mr Knox viſited this iſland in 1786, the number of inhabitants amounted to 15,000 : but ſome gentlemen who reſided there affirmed there were 16,000. It is divided into eight pariſhes, in each of which there is a ſchool, beſides three charity-ſchools in different places.</p><p>The minerals found here are lead and iron ore, which, however, have never been wrought to any advantage. Near the village of Sartle, the natives find black and white marcaſites, and variegated pebbles. The Appleſglen, in the neighbourhood oſ Loch-fallart, produces beautiful agates of different ſizes and colours; ſtones of a purple hue are, after great rains, found in the rivulets: cryſtal, of different colours and forms, abounds in ſeveral parts of the iſland, as well as black and white marble, free-ſtone, lime-ſtone, and talc: ſmall red and white coral is found on the ſouthern and weſtern coaſts in great abundance. The fuel conſiſts chiefly of peat and turf, which are impregnated with iron ore and ſaltpetre ; and coal has been diſcovered in ſeveral diſtricts.</p><p>The wild birds of all forts moſt common in the country are, ſolan geeſe, gulls, cormorants, cranes, wild geeſe, and wild ducks ; eagles, crows, ravens, rooks, cuckoos, rails, woodcocks, moor-fowl, partridges, plover, wild pigeons, and blackbirds, owls, hawks, ſnipes, and a variety of ſmall birds. In mild ſeaſons, the cuckoo and rail appear in the latter end of April ; the former disappears always before the end of June; the latter ſometimes not till September. The woodcock comes in October, and frequently remains till March. The tame sorts oſ fowl are geeſe, ducks, turkeys, cocks, pullets, and tame pigeons.</p><p>The black cattle are here expoſed to all the rigours of the ſevere winter, without any other provender than the tops of the heath and the alga marina ; ſo that they appear like mere ſkeletons in the ſpring ; though, as the graſs grows up, they ſoon become plump and juicy, the beef being ſweet, tender, and finely interlarded.— The amphibious animals are ſeals and otters. Among the reptiles they reckon vipers, aſps, weaſels, frogs, toads, and three different kinds of ſerpents ; the firſt ſpotted black and white, and very poiſonous ; the ſecond yel-<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0527.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s04-0521"/>
low, with brown ſpots ; and the third of a brown colour, the ſmalleſt and leaſt poiſonous.</p><p>Whales and cairbans, or sun-fiſh, come in ſometimes to the sounds after their prey, but are rarely purſued with any ſucceſs. The fiſhes commonly caught on the coaſt are herrings, ling, cod, ſcate, haddock, mackerel, lythe, ſye, and dog-fiſh. The average price of ling at home is L. 13, 13 s. <hi rend="italic">per</hi> ton ; when sold, one by one, if freſh, the price is from 3 d. to 5 d. ; if cured, from 5 d. to 7d. The barrel of herrings ſeldom falls under 19 s. which is owing to the great difficulty of procuring ſalt, even ſometimes at any price ; and the ſame cauſe prevents many from taking more than are ſufficient for their own uſe.</p><p>The kyle of Scalpe teems with oyſters; in ſuch a manner, that after ſome ſpring-tides, 20 horſe-loads of them are left upon the ſands. Near the village of Bern- ftill, the beach yields muſcles ſufficient to maintain 60 perſons <hi rend="italic">per</hi>; this providential ſupply helps to ſupport many poor families in times of ſcarcity.</p><p>The people are ſtrong, robuſt, healthy, and prolific. They generally proſeſs the Proteſtant religion ; are honeſt, brave, innocent, and hoſpitable. They ſpeak the language, wear the habit, and obſerve the cuſtoms that are common to all the Hebrides. The meconium in new-born infants is purged away with fresh butter : the children are bathed every morning and evening in water, and grow up ſo ſtrong, that a child of 10 months is able to walk alone : they never wear ſhoes or ſtockings before the age of eight or ten, and night-caps are hardly known ; they keep their ſeet always wet ; they lie on beds of ſtraw or heath, which laſt is an excellent reſtorative : they are quick of apprehenſion, ingenious, and very much addicted to muſic and poetry. They eat heartily of fiſh ; but ſeldom regale themſelves with fleſh-meat : their ordinary food conſiſts of butter, cheeſe, milk, potatoes, colewort, brochan, and a diſh called <hi rend="italic">oon,</hi> which indeed is no other than the froth of boiled milk or whey raiſed with a ſtick like that uſed in making chocolate.</p><p>A sort of coarſe woollen cloth called <hi rend="italic">cloa,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">caddoes,</hi> the manufacture of their waves, made into ſhort jackets and trouſers, is the common dreſs of the men. The philibeg is rarely worn, except in ſummer and on Sundays ; on which days, and ſome other occasions, thoſe in better circumſtances appear in tartans, a bonnet, and ſhort hoſe, and ſome in a hat, ſhort coat, waiſtcoat, and breeches, of Scotch or Engliſh manufacture. The women are in general very cleanly, and ſo exceſſively fond of dreſs, that many maid-ſervants are often known to lay out their whole wages that way.</p><p>There are two fairs held annually at Portree, to which almoſt every part of Sky sends cattle. The firſt is held in the end of May, and the ſecond in the end of July. The fair commonly continues from Wedneſday till the Saturday following. The commodities which are sold in theſe are horſes, cows, ſheep, goats, hides, butter, cheeſe, fiſh, and wool. The cattle fold in theſe fairs ſwim over to the main land through a mile or half a mile of ſea. Thouſands of theſe are yearly exported, at from L. 2 to L. 3 each. Many of them are driven to England, where they are fatted for the market, and counted delicious eating.</p><p>In Sky appear many ruins oſ Daniſh forts, watch-</p><p>towers, beacons, temples, and ſepulchral monuments. All the forts are known by the term <hi rend="italic">Dun ;</hi> ſuch as Dun-Skudborg, Dun-Derig, Dun-Skerineſs, Dun-Da- vid, &amp; c.</p><p><hi rend="italic">SKY-Colour.</hi> To give this colour to glaſs, ſet in the furnace a pot of pure metal of fritt from rochetta or barilla, but the rochetta fritt does beſt ; as ſoon as the metal is well purified, take for a pot of twenty pounds of metal six ounces of braſs calcined by itſelf; put it by degrees at two or three times into the metal, ſtirring and mixing it well every time, and diligently ſkimming the metal with a ladle : at the end of two hours the whole will be well mixed, and a proof may be taken ; if the colour be found right, let the whole ſtand 24 hours longer in the furnace, and it will then be fit to work, and will prove of a moſt beautiful ſky colour.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
