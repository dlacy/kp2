                <p><label>SCANDIUM</label>, [symbol Sc, atomic weight 44·1 (O = 16)], one of the
                    rare earth metals. It was isolated in 1879 by L. F. Nilson and was shown by
                    Cleve to be identical with the ekaboron predicted by D. Mendeléeff. The
                    separation of scandium from wolframite (which contains 0·14-0·16% of rare
                    earths) is given by R. J. Meyer (<hi rend="italic">Zeit.</hi>
                    <hi rend="italic">anorg. Chem.</hi> 1908, 60, p. 134), but it seems impossible
                    to obtain a perfectly pure specimen of the oxide. The salts of scandium are all
                    colourless, the chloride and bromide corresponding in composition to ScX·12HO;
                    the fluoride is anhydrous. The sulphate combines with the alkaline sulphates to
                    form double salts of the type Sc(SO)·3KSO. A large number of salts, both of
                    inorganic and organic acids, have been described by Sir W. Crookes (<hi
                        rend="italic">Phil. Trans.</hi> 1908, 209, A. p. 15); those of the fatty
                    acids are in most cases more soluble in cold than in hot water.</p>
