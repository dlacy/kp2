a well-known town and fortress of Hindustan, in the province of Bejapoor, and the Mahratta territories. Its foundation is on a rock, which stands on the westernmost point of a hill, rising from a base of from seven to eight miles in length from east to west. The passage to it is very narrow, only admitting one person at a time. It was taken by Sevajee, the founder of the Mahratta power, in 1673, and by Aurungzebe in 1690; but was retaken soon after the death of that monarch, in 1707. It capitulated to the British after a very short resistance in 1818 ; and being afterwards surveyed by British officers, they declared that it might be defended by two hundred troops against any force. This place owes its celebrity chiefly to its having been the state-prison of the legitimate sovereign of the Mahrattas, who was confined here by his chief minister the peishwa, who usurped the real power, while the deposed rajah was still honoured with the empty forms of royalty, and his name inserted in all public records. The representative of the Satarah rajah, though divested of all real power, was still recognised as the pageant of royalty ; and the country adjacent to Satarah, in consequence of his residence, enjoyed an exemption from all military license.<pb facs="chi.28490931-1526160593_Page_708.jpf" xml:id="eb07-19-s01-0653"/>
The father of the late rajah was a commandant of horse ; but being unfortunately of the blood of Sevajee, he was immured in the state-prison of Satarab. He died in 1808, and the Peishwa Bajerow immediately proceeded from Poo- nah, his residence, to superintend his obsequies, and to invest his successor with his empty dignity, and the misery of a prison thereto annexed. The Peishwa Bajerow was expelled from his throne in 1818, in consequence of joining in the coalition of the native powers against the British ; and it was determined to take the Satarah rajah from his confinement as a state prisoner, and to reinstate him in a portion of his ancient dominions. The territory granted him, and which he now enjoys, is bounded by the Western Ghaut Mountains, on the south by the Warner and Krishna rivers, on the north by the Neera and Beema rivers, and on the east by the frontier of the nizamâ€™s dominions. The whole area occupies 11,000 square miles.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
