                which is interrupted by green prairies. Viewed from a rising&nbsp;ground, the
                landscape presents a pleasing variety of corn-field and&nbsp;forest, while the
                horizon is broken by the bell-towers of numerous&nbsp;villages along the banks of
                the streams.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Viewed as a whole, the flora of the forest region must be regarded as
                European-Siberian ; and, though certain Species disappear towards&nbsp;the east,
                while new ones make their appearance, it maintains, on&nbsp;the whole, the same
                characters throughout from Poland to Kamchatka. Thus the beech </span><span

                class="font1"> a characteristic tree&nbsp;of western Europe, is unable to face the
                continental climate of&nbsp;Russia, and does not penetrate beyond Poland and the
                southwestern provinces, reappearing again in the Crimea. The silver

                class="font1"> does not extend over Russia, and the oak does not cross
                the&nbsp;Urals. On the other hand, several Asiatic species (Siberian
                pine,&nbsp;larch, cedar) grow freely in the north-east, while several
                shrubs&nbsp;and herbaceous plants, originally from the Asiatic steppes,
                have&nbsp;spread into the south-east. But all these do not greatly alter
                the&nbsp;general characters of the vegetation. The coniferous forests of&nbsp;the
                north contain, besides conifers, the birch </span><span class="font1"

                the&nbsp;south-west). The hornbeam is prevalent in the Ukraine, and the&nbsp;maple
                begins to appear in the south part of the coniferous region.&nbsp;In the forest
                region no fewer than 772 flowering species are found,&nbsp;of which 568 dicotyledons
                occur in the Archangel government (only&nbsp;436 to the east of the White Sea, which
                is a botanical limit for many&nbsp;species). In central Russia the species become
                still more numerous,&nbsp;and, though the local floras cannot yet be considered
                complete, they&nbsp;number from 850 to 1050 species in the separate governments,
                and&nbsp;about 1600 in the best explored parts of the south-west. Corn
                is&nbsp;cultivated throughout this region. Its northern limits—which are&nbsp;sure
                to advance still farther as the population increases—almost&nbsp;reach the Arctic
                coast at the Varanger Fiord ; farther east they&nbsp;hardly extend to the north of
                Archangel, and the limit is still&nbsp;lower towards the Urals. The northern
                frontier of rye closely corresponds to that of barley. Wheat is cultivated in South
                Finland,&nbsp;but in western Russia it hardly passes 58° K. lat. Its true
                domains&nbsp;are the oak region and the Steppes. Fruit-trees are cultivated
                as&nbsp;far as 62° N. in Finland, and as far as 58° in the east. Apricots&nbsp;and
                walnuts flourish at Warsaw, but in Russia they do not extend&nbsp;beyond 50°.
                Apples, pears, and cherries are grown throughout the&nbsp;oak region.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Region of
                the Steppes,</span><span class="font1"> which covers all southern Russia, may be
                subdivided into two zones—an intermediate zone and that of&nbsp;the Steppes proper.
                The Ante-Steppe of the preceding region and&nbsp;the intermediate zone of the
                Steppes include those tracts where&nbsp;the West-European climate struggles with the
                Asiatic, and where&nbsp;a struggle is being carried on between the forest and the
                Steppe.&nbsp;It is comprised between the summer isotherms of 59° and 63°,
                being&nbsp;bounded on the south by a line which runs through Ekaterinoslaff&nbsp;and
                Lugan. South of this line begin the Steppes proper, which&nbsp;extend to the sea and
                penetrate to the foot of Mount Caucasus.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The Steppes proper are very fertile elevated plains, slightly
                undulated, and intersected by numerous ravines which are dry in&nbsp;summer. The
                undulations are scarcely apparent to the eye as it&nbsp;takes in a wide prospect
                under a blazing sun and with a deep-blue&nbsp;sky overhead. Not a tree is to be
                seen, the few woods and&nbsp;thickets being hidden in the depressions and deep
                valleys of the&nbsp;rivers. On the thick sheet of black earth by which the Steppe
                is&nbsp;covered a luxuriant vegetation develops in spring ; after the old&nbsp;grass
                has been burned a bright green covers immense stretches,&nbsp;but this rapidly
                disappears under the burning rays of the sun and&nbsp;the hot easterly winds. The
                colouring of the Steppe changes as&nbsp;if by magic, and only the silvery plumes of
                the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">kovyl
                (Stipa&nbsp;pennata)</span><span class="font1"> wave under the wind, giving the
                Steppe the aspect of a&nbsp;bright yellow sea. For days together the traveller sees
                no other&nbsp;vegetation ; even this, however, disappears as he nears the
                regions&nbsp;recently left dry from the Caspian, where salted clays covered
                with&nbsp;a few </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
                >Salsolaeeæ,</span><span class="font1"> or mere sands, take the place of the
                black-earth.&nbsp;Here begins the Aral-Caspian desert. The Steppe, however, is
                not&nbsp;so devoid of trees as at first sight appears. Innumerable clusters&nbsp;of
                wild cherries </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Prunus
                Chamaecerasus),</span><span class="font1"> wild apricots </span><span class="font1"

                the depressions of the surface and on the slopes of&nbsp;the ravines, giving the
                Steppe that charm which manifests itself in&nbsp;the popular poetry. Unfortunately
                the spread of cultivation is fatal&nbsp;to these oases (they are often called “
                islands ” by the inhabitants) ;&nbsp;the axe and the plough ruthlessly destroy
                them.</span></p>

                marshy bottoms of the ravines, and in the valleys of streams and rivers,

                various willows </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"

                physiognomy of the Steppe. The&nbsp;prairies are superseded by wheat-fields, and

                farther east.</span></p>

                poplar become quite common. The number&nbsp;of species of herbaceous plants rapidly
                increases, while beyond the&nbsp;Volga a variety of Asiatic species join the
                West-European flora.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
                >Circum-Mediterranean Region</span><span class="font1"> is represented by a narrow
                strip of land on the south coast of the Crimea, where a climate&nbsp;similar to that
                of the Mediterranean coast has permitted the&nbsp;development of a flora closely
                resembling that of the valley of the&nbsp;Arno. Of course, human cultivation has not
                yet acclimatized&nbsp;there the same variety of plants as that imported into Italy
                since&nbsp;the Romans. It has even destroyed the rich forests which sixty&nbsp;years
                ago made deer-hunting possible at Khersones. The olive&nbsp;and the chestnut are
                rare ; but the beach reappears, and the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">Rinus Pinaster</span><span class="font1"> recalls the
                Italian pines. At a few points, such as&nbsp;the Nikitsky garden and Alupka, where
                plants have been acclimatized by human agency, the Californian </span><span

                the&nbsp;Lebanon cedar, many evergreen trees, the laurel, the cypress, and&nbsp;even

                excelsa)</span><span class="font1"> flourish. The&nbsp;grass vegetation is very
                rich, and, according to lists still incomplete, no fewer than 1654 flowering plants
                are known. On the&nbsp;whole, the Crimean flora has little in common with that of
                the&nbsp;Caucasus, where only 244 Crimean species have as yet been
                    found.@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The fauna of European Russia does not very materially differ from
                that of western Europe. In the forests not many animals&nbsp;which have disappeared
                from western Europe have held their&nbsp;ground ; while in the Urals only a few—now
                Siberian, but formerly&nbsp;also European—are met with. On the whole, Russia belongs
                to&nbsp;the same zoo-geographical region as central Europe and northern&nbsp;Asia,
                the same fauna extending in Siberia as far as the Yenisei&nbsp;and Lena. In
                south-eastern Russia, however, towards the Caspian,&nbsp;we find a notable admixture
                of Asiatic species, the deserts of that&nbsp;part of Russia belonging in reality
                rather to the Aral-Caspian&nbsp;depression than to Europe.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">For the zoo-geographer only three separate sub-regions appear on the
                East-European plains—the tundras, including the Arctic&nbsp;islands, the forest
                region, especially the coniferous part of it, and&nbsp;the Ante-Steppe and Steppes
                of the black-earth region. The Ural&nbsp;mountains might be distinguished as a
                fourth sub-region, while&nbsp;the south coast of the Crimea and Caucasus, as well as
                the Caspian&nbsp;deserts, have their own individuality.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">As for the adjoining seas, the fauna of the Arctic Ocean off the
                Norwegian coast corresponds, in its western parts at least, to that&nbsp;of the
                North Atlantic Gulf Stream. The White Sea and the Arctic&nbsp;Ocean to the east of
                Svyatoi Nos belong to a separate zoological&nbsp;region connected with, and hardly
                separable from, that part of the&nbsp;Arctic Ocean which extends along the Siberian
                coast as far as to&nbsp;about the Lena. The Black Sea, of which the fauna was
                formerly&nbsp;little known but now appears to be very rich, belongs to the
                Mediterranean region, slightly modified, while the Caspian partakes of&nbsp;the
                characteristic fauna inhabiting the lakes and seas of the Aral-Caspian
                depression.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">In the region of the tundras life has to contend with such
                unfavourable conditions that it cannot be abundant. Still, the reindeer frequents it
                for its lichens, and on the drier slopes of the moraine deposits four species of
                lemming, hunted by the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"

                has lost some of its representatives within historic times, is still&nbsp;rich. The
