<p><span class="font0">he applied himſelf to the military art and to civil government. He had alſo a very ſingular natural defect, which, had it not been conquered, would have rendered him for ever incapable of accompliſhing what he afterwards did. This was a vehement dread of water ;&nbsp;which is thus accounted for. When he was about five&nbsp;years of age, his mother went with him in a coach, in&nbsp;the ſpring-ſeaſon ; and paſſing over a dam where there&nbsp;was a conſiderable water-fall, whilſt he lay aſleep in her&nbsp;lap, he was ſo ſuddenly awaked and frightened by the&nbsp;ruſhing of the water, that it brought a fever upon him ;&nbsp;and after his recovery he retained ſuch a'dread of that&nbsp;element, that he could not bear to ſee any ſtanding water, much leſs to hear a running ſtream. This averſion,&nbsp;however, he conquered by jumping into water ; and&nbsp;afterwards became very fond of that element.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Being aſhamed of the ignorance in which he had been brought up, he learned almoſt of himſelf, and&nbsp;without a maſter, enough of the High and Low Dutch&nbsp;languages to ſpeak and write intelligibly in both. He&nbsp;looked upon the Germans and Hollanders as the moſt&nbsp;civilized nations ; becauſe the former had already erected ſome of thoſe arts and manufactures in Moſcow,&nbsp;which he was deſirous of ſpreading throughout his empire ; and the latter excelled in the art of navigation,&nbsp;which he conſidered as more neceſſary than any other.&nbsp;During the adminiſtration of the princeſs Sophia, he&nbsp;had formed a deſign of eſtabliſhing a maritime power in&nbsp;Ruſſia ; which he accompliſhed by the means which we&nbsp;have recorded in his life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Having reformed his array, and introduced new diſcipline among them, he led his troops againſt the Turks; ſrom whom, in 1696, he took the fortreſs of Azov,&nbsp;and had the ſatisfaction to ſee his fleet defeat that of&nbsp;the enemy. On his return to Moſcow were ſtruck the&nbsp;firſt medals which had ever appeared in Ruſſia. The&nbsp;legend was, “ Peter the first, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">the auguβ emperor of&nbsp;Rujfia.”</span><span class="font0"> On the reverſe was Azov, with theſe words,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ViSorious by fire and water.</span><span class="font0"> Notwithſtanding this ſucceſs, however, Peter , was very much chagrined at having his ſhips all built by foreigners ; having beſides as&nbsp;great an inclination to have an harbour on the Baltic as&nbsp;on the Euxine Sea. Theſe conſiderations determined&nbsp;him to ſend ſome of the young nobility oſ his empire&nbsp;into foreign countries, where they might improve. In&nbsp;1697 he ſent 69 young Ruffians into Italy ; moſt of&nbsp;them to Venice, and the reſt to Leghorn, in order to&nbsp;learn the method of conſtructing their galleys. Forty&nbsp;more were ſent out by his direction for Holland, with&nbsp;an intent to inſtruct themſelves in the art of building&nbsp;and working large ſhips : others were appointed for&nbsp;Germany, to ſerve in the land-forces, and to learn&nbsp;the military diſcipline of that nation. At laſt he reſolved to travel through different countries in perſon,&nbsp;that he might have the opportunity of profiting by his&nbsp;own obſervation and experience. Of this journey we&nbsp;have given a ſhort account elſewhere ; and ſhall here&nbsp;only add, that in executing his great deſign, he lived&nbsp;and worked like </span><span class="font1">a </span><span class="font0">common carpenter. He laboured&nbsp;hard at the forges, rope-yards, and at the ſeveral mills&nbsp;for the ſawing of timber, manufacturing of paper, wiredrawing, &amp;c. In acquiring the art of a carpenter, he&nbsp;began -with purchaſing </span><span class="font1">a </span><span class="font0">boat, to which he made a&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">maſt </span><span class="font0">himſelf, and by degree« he </span><span class="font1">executed every </span><span class="font0">part </span><span class="font1">of&nbsp;the conſtruction of a ſhip·</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">Beſides this, Peter frequently went ſrom Sweden to Amſterdam, where he attended the lectures of the celebrated Ruyſeh on anatomy. He alſo attended the lectures of burgomaſter Witſen on natural philoſophy.&nbsp;From this place he went for a few days to Utrecht,&nbsp;in order to pay a viſit to King William III. of England ; and on his return ſent to Archangel a 60 gun&nbsp;ſhip, in the building of which he had aſſiſted with his&nbsp;own hands. In 1698 he went over to England, where&nbsp;he employed himſelf in the ſame manner as he had done&nbsp;in Holland. Here he perfected himſelf in the art of&nbsp;ſhip-building ; and having engaged a great number of&nbsp;artificers, he returned with them to Holland ; from&nbsp;whence he ſet out for Vienna, where he paid a viſit to&nbsp;the emperor; and was θn the point of ſetting out for Venice to finiſh his- improvements, when he was informed&nbsp;of a rebellion having broken out in his dominions.&nbsp;This was occaſioned by the ſuperſtition and obſtinacy&nbsp;of the Ruffians, who having an almoſt invincible attachment to thçir old ignorance and barbariſm, had reſolved&nbsp;to dethrone the Czar on account of his innovations.&nbsp;But Peter arriving unexpectedly at Moſcow, quickly&nbsp;put an end to their machinations, and took a moſt ſevere revenge on thoſe wſho had been guilty. Having&nbsp;then made great reformations in every part of his empire, in 1700 he entered into a league with the kings&nbsp;of Denmark and Poland againſt Charles XII. of Sweden. The particulars of this famous war are related&nbsp;under the article Sweden. Here we ſhall only obſerve,&nbsp;that, from the conclufion of this war, Sweden ceaſed&nbsp;not only to be a formidable enemy to Ruſſia, but even&nbsp;loſt its political conſequence in a great meaſure altogether.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Peter applied himſelf to the cultivation of commerce, arts, and ſciences, with equal aſſiduity as to the pursuits&nbsp;of war ; and he made ſuch acquiſitions of dominion&nbsp;even in Europe itſelf, that he may be ſaid, at the time&nbsp;of his death, to have been the moſt powerful prince of&nbsp;his age. He was unfortunate in the Czarovitz his eldeſt ſon, whom he contrived to get rid oſ by the&nbsp;forms of juſtice (ſee Peter I. note b),' and then ordered his wife Catharine to be crowned with the ſame&nbsp;magnificent ceremonies as if ſhe had been a Greek em-preſs, and to be recogniſed as his ſucceſſor ; which ſhe&nbsp;accordingly was, and mounted the Ruſſian throne upon&nbsp;the deceaſe of her huſhand. She died, after a glorious&nbsp;reign, in 1727, and was ſucceeded by Peter II. a minor, ſon toi the Czarovitz. Many domeſtſe revolutions&nbsp;happened in Ruſſia during the ſhort reign of this prince;&nbsp;but none was more remarkable than the diſgrace and&nbsp;exile of Prince Menzikoff, the favourite general in the&nbsp;two late reigns, and eſteemed the richeſt ſubject in </span><span class="font1">Eu</span><span class="font0">rope. Peter died of the ſmall-pox in 1730.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Notwithſtanding the deſpotiſm of Peter the Great and his wife, the Ruſſian ſenate and nobility, upon the&nbsp;death of Peter II. ventured to ſet aſide the order of&nbsp;ſucceſſion which they had eſtabliſhed. The male iſſue&nbsp;of Peter was now extinguiſhed ; and the duke of Hol-ſtein, ſon to his eldeſt daughter, was by the deſtination&nbsp;of the late empreſs intitled to the crown : but the Ruffians, for political reaſons, filled their throne with Anne&nbsp;ducheſs of Courland, ſecond daughter to John, Peter’s&nbsp;eldeſt brother ; though her elder fitter the ducheſs of&nbsp;Mecklenburgh was alive. Her reign was extremely&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">prυfperous : and though ſhe accepted of the </span><span class="font0">crown u»&lt;</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
