<p><span class="font0">horrid execrations, and always insisted that he did the fact from his own motive, and that he could accuse nobody. On&nbsp;the day of his execution, after he had made the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">amende</span><span class="font0"> before the church of Nôtre Dame, he was carried to the Grève ;&nbsp;and, being placed upon a scaffold, was tied to a wooden engine&nbsp;in the shape of a St Andrew’s cross. The knife with which&nbsp;he did the murder being fastened in his right hand, it was&nbsp;first burned in a slow fire ; then the fleshy parts of his body&nbsp;were torn with red-hot pincers, and melted lead, oil, pitch,&nbsp;and rosin poured into the wounds. The people refused to&nbsp;ray for him ; and when, according to the sentence that had&nbsp;een pronounced upon him, he came to be dragged to pieces&nbsp;by four horses, one of those that were brought appearing to&nbsp;be but weak, a spectator offered his own, with which the criminal was much moved. He was very earnest for absolution, which his confessor refused, unless he would reveal his&nbsp;accomplices. “ Give it me,” said he, “ upon condition that&nbsp;I have told the truth ;” which the priest eventually did. His&nbsp;body was so robust that it resisted the force of the horses ;&nbsp;and the executioner was at length obliged to cut him into&nbsp;quarters, which the people dragged through the streets.&nbsp;Such was the miserable fate of this fanatical assassin, who&nbsp;deprived France of one of her best and greatest kings. He&nbsp;was believed by the populace to have been set on by the&nbsp;Jesuits, although, whilst suffering the most horrible torments, he declared that he had no accomplices, and had&nbsp;done the deed from motives of his own.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RAY, John, a celebrated naturalist, and the son of Mr Roger Ray, a blacksmith, was born at Black Notly, in Essex, in 1628. He received the rudiments of learning at&nbsp;the grammar-school of Braintree ; and in 1644 was admitted into Catharine Hall, Cambridge, whence he afterwards removed to Trinity College in that university. He&nbsp;took the degree of master of arts, and became at length a&nbsp;senior fellow of the college ; but his intense application to&nbsp;his studies having injured his health, he was obliged at his&nbsp;leisure hours to exercise himself by riding or walking in&nbsp;the fields, which led him to the study of plants. He noted&nbsp;from Johnson, Parkinson, and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Phytologia Britannica,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">the places where curious plants grew ; and in 1658 he rode&nbsp;from Cambridge to the city of Chester, whence he proceeded to North Wales, visiting many places, and amongst&nbsp;others the famous hill of Snowdon, and returning by Shrewsbury and Gloucester.
