<p><span class="font2">RABBAN BAR SAUMA (fl. 1280-1288), Nestorian traveller and diplomatist, was born at Peking about the middle of the 13th&nbsp;century, of Uigur stock. While still young he started on a&nbsp;pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and travelling by way of Tangut,&nbsp;Khotan, Kashgar, Talas in the Syr Daria valley, Khorasan,&nbsp;Maragha and Mosul, arrived at Ani in Armenia. Warnings of&nbsp;the danger of the routes to southern Syria turned him from his&nbsp;purpose; and his friend and fellow-pilgrim, Rabban Marcos,&nbsp;becoming Nestorian patriarch (as Mar Yaballaha III. ) in 1281,&nbsp;suggested Bar Sauma’s name to Arghun Khan, sovereign of the&nbsp;Ilkhanate or Mongol-Persian realm, for a European embassy,&nbsp;then contemplated. The purpose of this was to conclude an&nbsp;anti-Moslem alliance, especially against the Mameluke power,&nbsp;with the chief states of Christendom. On this embassy Bar&nbsp;Sauma started in 1287, with Arghun’s letters to the Byzantine&nbsp;emperor, the pope and the kings of France and England. In&nbsp;Constantinople he had audience of Andronicus II.; he gives an&nbsp;enthusiastic description of St Sophia. He next travelled to&nbsp;Rome, where he visited St Peter’s, and had prolonged negotiations with the cardinals. The papacy being then vacant, a&nbsp;definite reply to his proposals was postponed, and Bar Sauma&nbsp;passed on to Paris, where he had audience of the king of France&nbsp;(Philip the Fair). In Gascony he apparently met the king of&nbsp;England (Edward I. ) at a place which seems to be Bordeaux,&nbsp;but of which he speaks as the capital of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Alanguitar (i. e.</span><span class="font2"> Angleterre). On returning to Rome, he was cordially received by the&nbsp;newly elected pontiff Nicolas IV., who gave him communion on&nbsp;Palm Sunday, 1288, allowed him to celebrate his own Eucharist&nbsp;in the capital of Latin Christendom, commissioned him to visit&nbsp;the Christians of the East, and entrusted to him the tiara which&nbsp;he presented to Mar Yaballaha. His narrative is of unique&nbsp;interest as giving a picture of medieval Europe at the close of&nbsp;the Crusading period, painted by a keenly intelligent, broadminded and statesmanlike observer.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">RABBET, in carpentry and masonry, the name for a rectangular groove or slot cut in the edge of a' piece of wood or stone, to which another corresponding piece can be fitted (see&nbsp;Joinery and Masonry). The word is an adaptation of the&nbsp;O. Fr. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">rabat</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">rabbat,</span><span class="font2"> from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">rabattre, i. e. abattre,</span><span class="font2"> beat back, abate,&nbsp;to make a recess, and is thus a doublet of “ rebate ” (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">q. υ. </span><span class="font2">)</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span class="font2"> which&nbsp;is now frequently used instead of “ rabbet, ” the joint being also&nbsp;known as a “ rebated joint. ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RABBI, a Hebrew word meaning “ my master, ” “ my teacher. ” It is derived from the adjective </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">rab</span><span class="font2"> (in Aramaic,&nbsp;and frequently also in Hebrew, “ great ”), which acquired in&nbsp;modern Hebrew the signification of “lord, ” in relation to servants&nbsp;or slaves, and of “ teacher, ” “ master, ” in relation to the&nbsp;disciple. The master was addressed by his pupils with the&nbsp;word </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">rabbi</span><span class="font2"> (“my teacher”), or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">rabbenu</span><span class="font2"> (“our teacher”). It&nbsp;became customary to speak of Moses as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Moshe rabbenu </span><span class="font2">(</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;</span><span class="font2"> our&nbsp;teacher Moses ”). Jesus makes it a reproach against the&nbsp;scribes that they cause themselves to be entitled by the people&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">rabbi (ῥaββí,</span><span class="font2"> Matt, xxiii. 7): and He Himself is saluted by the&nbsp;disciples of John as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">rabbi</span><span class="font2"> (John i. 38, where the word is explained&nbsp;as equivalent to διδάσκαλϵ). As an honorary title of the&nbsp;scribes, with whose name it was constantly linked, “ Rabbi ”&nbsp;only came into use during the last decades of the second Temple.&nbsp;Hillel and Shammai, the contemporaries of Herod, were mentioned without any title. Gamaliel I., the grandson of Hillel,&nbsp;was the first to whose name the appellation </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rabban</span><span class="font2"> (the same as&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">rabbon,</span><span class="font2"> and also pronounced as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ribbon, </span><span class="font2">cf.</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"> ῥaββουví,</span><span class="font2"> Mark x. 51;&nbsp;John xx. 16) was prefixed. This title, a higher distinction than&nbsp;that of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">rabbi,</span><span class="font2"> is in tradition borne only by the descendants of&nbsp;Gamaliel I., the last being Gamaliel III., the son of Jehuda I.&nbsp;(Aboth ii. 2), and by Joḥanan b. Zaccai, the founder of the&nbsp;school of Jamnia (Jabneh). Otherwise all Tannaites (see&nbsp;Tanna), the scholars of the Mishnah period, were distinguished&nbsp;by the title of “ rabbi. ” The Jehuda I. mentioned above, the&nbsp;redactor of the Mishnah, was honoured as the “ Rabbi ”&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">κar' έζοχήν</span><span class="font2"> (“ par excellence ”), and in the tradition of the&nbsp;houses of learning, if it was necessary to speak of him or to cite&nbsp;his opinions and utterances, he was simply referred to as&nbsp;“ Rabbi, ” without the mention of any name. Scholars who were&nbsp;not definitely ordained—and among these were men of high&nbsp;distinction—were simply mentioned by their names without&nbsp;the Rabbi-title. In the post-Talmudic age the Qaraites, who&nbsp;rejected the tradition of the Talmud, designated the Jews who&nbsp;adhered to that tradition as Rabbanites. Similarly the term&nbsp;Rabbins, or Rabbis, is applied to modern Jewish clergy. The&nbsp;plural </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">rabbanim</span><span class="font2"> was employed to describe the later Jewish&nbsp;scholars (so, for example, in the historian Abraham Ibn Daud,&nbsp;12th century). By “rabbinical literature” is understood the&nbsp;post-Talmudic Jewish literature; in particular, so far as its&nbsp;subject is the literature of the tradition and its contents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rab became a proper name as the standing nomenclature of the celebrated amora, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Abba Arika (q.υ.), </span><span class="font2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(W. Ba. )</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RABBIT, the modern name of the well-known rodent, formerly called (as it still is in English legal phraseology) Cony, @@</span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sup>1&nbsp;</sup></span><span class="font2">a member of the family </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Leporidae</span><span class="font2"> (see Rodentia). Till recently&nbsp;the rabbit has generally been known scientifically as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Lepus cuniculus,</span><span class="font2"> but it is now frequently regarded, at least by systematic&nbsp;naturalists, as the representative of a genus by itself, under the&nbsp;name of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Oryctolagus cuniculus.</span><span class="font2"> Some zoologists, indeed, include&nbsp;in the same genus the South African thick-tailed hare, but by&nbsp;others this is separated as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pronolagus crassicaudatus.</span><span class="font2"> From the&nbsp;hare the wild rabbit is distinguished externally by its smaller&nbsp;size, shorter ears and feet, the absence or reduction of the black&nbsp;patch at the tip of the ears, and its greyer colour.

The familiar name for&nbsp;toasted cheese, “ Welsh rabbit, ” is merely a joke, and the alteration&nbsp;to “ Welsh rare-bit ” is due to a failure to see the joke, such as it&nbsp;is. Parallels may be found in “ Prairie oyster, ” the yolk of an egg&nbsp;with vinegar, pepper, &amp;c. added; or “Scotch woodcock, ” a savoury&nbsp;of buttered eggs on anchovy toast.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
