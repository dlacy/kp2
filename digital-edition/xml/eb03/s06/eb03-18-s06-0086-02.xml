in medicine, a ſickneſs with a ſenſation of a load at the ſtomach, uſually proceeding from ſome error in diet, either with regard to the quantity or quality of the food taken. Sometimes, however, a ſurfeit is only a plethora from indolence and full but improper feeding ; in which case perſpiration is defective ; and eruptions form themſelves on the ſkin.</p><p>A ſurfeit from animal food, as muſcles, putrid fleſh, &amp;c. is beſt remedied by the uſe of vegetable acids, which may be taken diluted with water, a vomit being premiſed, and this even though a vomiting and purging both attend.</p><p>When an exceſs of feeding is the cauſe, the primæ viæ being evacuated, and the nature of the plethora attended to, that the load may be properly evacuated, the indication of cure will be, to recover the perſpiratory diſcharge, conſiſtent with which diuretics may be uſed in preference to medicines which produce any other evacuation.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Surfeit,</hi> in farriery.
