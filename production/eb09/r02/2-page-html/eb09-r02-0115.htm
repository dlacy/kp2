<p><span class="font1">city is so limited that its population increases very slowly. The so-called suburbs on the other hand, with their broad&nbsp;and quiet boulevards on the site of the former fortifications,&nbsp;are steadily growing and undergoing new improvements.&nbsp;The St Petersburg suburb, connected with the city by an&nbsp;avenue of trees, is the seat of the wealthy German&nbsp;aristocracy and merchant community. The rich “poly-technicum” and the new theatre are situated there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Few antiquities of the mediæval town still remain. The oldest church, the “Domkirche,” founded in 1204,&nbsp;was burned in 1547, and the present building dates from&nbsp;the second half of the 16th century. Its organ, with a&nbsp;gas-engine of 4-horse power, and 6826 pipes—dating&nbsp;from 1883—is said to be the largest in the world. St&nbsp;Peter’s church, with a beautiful tower 440 feet high, was&nbsp;erected in 1406. The castle, built in 1494-1515 by the&nbsp;master of the Knights of the Sword, Walter von Plettenberg—a spacious building often rebuilt—is now the seat&nbsp;of the governor-general and the Russian authorities. The&nbsp;“ House of the Black Heads ” (opposite the elegant new&nbsp;town-house), which was the seat of a military corporation founded in 1232, and subsequently became the meeting place of the wealthier youth of the place, has some&nbsp;valuable contents. Of the recent erections, the polytechnic, the exchange, the municipal picture gallery, the&nbsp;monument of Herder, who lived at Riga towards the end&nbsp;of the last century, the gymnasiums of Lomonossofi and&nbsp;Alexander I., and the large bonded warehouse are worthy&nbsp;of notice. The esplanade (where a Greek cathedral now&nbsp;stands), the quiet Wöhrmaun’s Park, and the well-shaded “ Kaiserliche” Park are much visited. The environs&nbsp;of Riga are undergoing constant improvement, and some of&nbsp;them, such as Dubbeln and the sea-bathing resorts of Bilder-liugshof and Majorenhof, have numerous, visitors in summer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1867 Riga had a population of 102,590 (city, 18,246 ; St Petersburg suburb, 27,155 ; Moscow suburb, 41,318 ; Mitau&nbsp;suburb, 15,871). On December 25, 1881 it had 168,728 inhabitants, the suburbs alone showing an increase of 64,263 (city,&nbsp;20,091; suburb of St Petersburg, 45,345; of Moscow, 73,705;&nbsp;and of Mitau, 29,587). About one half of the population is&nbsp;German, the remainder being Russian and Lettish in nearly equal&nbsp;proportions, with some 2000 Esthonians and nearly 5000 foreigners.&nbsp;The life of the city has a German character throughout, but the&nbsp;Russians (many of whom were serfs until 1861), and still more the&nbsp;Letts and Esthonians, also display a steadily progressive intellectual&nbsp;life. Both are seeking to counteract the German influence by&nbsp;increasing the number of their educational institutions, the Letts&nbsp;also by the stage and the press. The larger commerce is wholly&nbsp;in German and (to a less extent) English hands. Owing to its&nbsp;communication by water and rail with the forests of White Russia&nbsp;and Volhynia, Riga is a great mart for timber, which in value&nbsp;stands third among the exports. Flax and linseed occupy the&nbsp;first place, Riga being the chief Russian port for the extensive&nbsp;fiax-producing region of north-west Russia. Owing to the great railway which crosses the country from Riga to Smolensk, afterwards&nbsp;dividing into two branches, to Orenburg and Tsaritsyn on the&nbsp;lower Volga respectively, Riga is also the great storehouse and&nbsp;place of export for hemp coming by rail from west central Russia,&nbsp;and for corn, Riga merchants sending their buyers as far east&nbsp;as Tamboff. Oats, in particular, are extensively exported to England from the central provinces. Tallow, leather, tobacco, rugs,&nbsp;feathers, and other minor items add considerably to the total&nbsp;value of the exports. The competition of the port of Libau (with&nbsp;exports amounting in 1882 to 31,473,590 roubles) is counterbalanced by the steady development of the Russian railway&nbsp;system, so that the exports of Riga, which in 1851-1860 averaged&nbsp;17,737,000 roubles, and were 23,964,000 in 1866, amounted in 1882&nbsp;to 64,159,076 roubles or £6,415,900 (food stuffs, £1,706,300 ; raw&nbsp;produce, £4,690,170, including timber, £1,295,520 ; and manufactured wares, £19,436). The imports, consisting chiefly of salt,&nbsp;fish, wine, and cotton, with metals, machinery, coal, oils, fruits,&nbsp;tobacco, and other minor articles, are also rapidly increasing&nbsp;(4,876,OOO roubles in 1851-1860, 6,751,000 roubles in 1866, and&nbsp;34,304,100 roubles in 1882). The food stuffs (salt, fish, tobacco,&nbsp;wine, oils, &amp;c. ) reached £514,847 ; raw produce (chiefly cotton,&nbsp;coal, and metal), £2,043,804 ; and manufactured wares, £871,132.&nbsp;In 1882 the port was visited by 2347 foreign vessels of 906,200&nbsp;tons burden ; of these 537 (367,110 tons) were from Great Britain ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">161 vessels of 89,990 tons, engaged in the coasting trade, also entered the port. Riga is in railway communication with Libau&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(via</span><span class="font0"> Mitau), and with St Petersburg </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(via</span><span class="font0"> Dünaburg), Warsaw, and&nbsp;central Russia ; the traffic is very active,—no less than 11,247,000&nbsp;cwts. of various wares having been brought to Riga by rail, and&nbsp;844,000 cwts. shipped on the Düna.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The manufactures of the town and neighbourhood are yearly developing ; the chief items are woollen cloth, cottons, machinery,&nbsp;metal wares, cigars, corks, glass, and paper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The educational institutions include, besides the polytechnic, a Greek seminary, four gymnasiums, some ten private schools for&nbsp;secondary education of boys and girls, and a comparatively large&nbsp;number of primary schools. The municipal library contains very&nbsp;interesting materials relating to the history of the Baltic provinces.&nbsp;The book trade is rapidly extending.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History.—</span><span class="font0">Riga was founded in 1158, as a storehouse at the mouth of the Düna, by a few Bremen merchants. Its name is&nbsp;supposed to be derived from Righ-ö, an island formerly separated&nbsp;from the mainland by a branch of the Diina. About 1190 the&nbsp;Augustinian monk Meinhard erected a monastery there, and in&nbsp;1199-1201 Bishop Albert I. of Livonia obtained from Innocent III.&nbsp;permission for German merchants to land at the new settlement,&nbsp;and chose it for his seat, exercising his power over the neighbouring district in connexion with the Teutonic Knights. As early&nbsp;as the first half of the 13th century the young city obtained the&nbsp;right of electing its own magistracy, and enlarged the walls erected&nbsp;during Albert l.’s time. It joined the Hanseatic League, and from&nbsp;1253 refused to recognize the rights of the bishop and the knights.&nbsp;Early in the 14th century Riga repelled the attack of the Kuron&nbsp;ruler Lamehinas, and during the next century it had to contend&nbsp;with the knights. In 1420 it fell once more under the rule of the&nbsp;bishop, who maintained his authority until 1566, when it was&nbsp;abolished in consequence of the Reformation. Sigismund III., king&nbsp;of Poland, took Riga in 1547, and in 1558 the Russian commander&nbsp;Prince Serebryanyi reached the town, burned its suburbs and many&nbsp;ships on the Düna, and remained for three days under the walls of&nbsp;the fort. In 1561 Gotthard Kettler publicly abdicated his mastership of the order of Knights of the Sword, and Riga, together with&nbsp;southern Livonia, became a Polish possession ; after some unsuccessful attempts to reintroduce Roman Catholicism, Stephen Batory&nbsp;recognized the religious freedom of the Protestant population.&nbsp;Throughout the 17th century Riga—which for nearly three centuries&nbsp;had been a wealthy centre of the commerce of the whole region,&nbsp;and was at this time visited by from three to five hundred&nbsp;ships annually—became a bone of contention between Sweden,&nbsp;Poland, and Russia. In 1621 Gustavus Adolphus took it from&nbsp;Poland, and held it against the Poles and the Russians who besieged&nbsp;it in 1656. During the Northern War it was courageously defended,&nbsp;but after the battle of Poltava it succumbed, and was taken in July&nbsp;1710 by Sheremetyeff. In 1781 it was made by Russia the capital&nbsp;of the Riga viceroyalty, but fifteen years later, the viceroyalty having&nbsp;been abolished, it was made and still remains the capital of Livonia.&nbsp;In 1812, the approach of the French being apprehended, the suburbs were burnt. Riga still maintains many of its old municipal&nbsp;institutions. The “magistrate” of Riga exercises patrimonial&nbsp;rights over a district comprising several communes around the&nbsp;city.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(P. A. K.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RIGAUD, Hyacinthe (1659-1743), French painter, born at Perpignan 20th July 1659, was the descendant of a&nbsp;line of painters. Having early lost his father, he was sent&nbsp;by his mother to Montpellier, where he studied under Pezet&nbsp;and was helped by Ranc, then to Lyons, and in 1681&nbsp;to Paris. There, whilst following the regular course of&nbsp;academical instruction, Rigaud produced a great number of&nbsp;portraits so good that Lebrun advised him to give up going&nbsp;to Rome and to devote himself wholly to this class of&nbsp;work. Rigaud, although he had obtained the Great Prize,&nbsp;followed this advice, and for sixty-two years painted at the&nbsp;rate of thirty to forty portraits a year, all carried through&nbsp;with infinite care by his own hand. He had a magnificent&nbsp;emphatic manner appropriate to the rendering of the&nbsp;pompous types of the age, but, although some of his most&nbsp;famous works belong to the class of official portraiture, his&nbsp;talent showed to even greater advantage in the painting of&nbsp;subjects whose life and position admitted of less formal&nbsp;treatment. His portraits of himself, of the sculptor Desjardins (Louvre), of Mignard, and of Lebrun (Louvre) may&nbsp;be cited as triumphs of a still more attractive, if less imposing, character than that displayed in his grand representations of Bossuet (Louvre) and Louis XIV. (Louvre),&nbsp;while his beautiful portraits of his mother, Marie Serre</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
