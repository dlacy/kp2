<p><label>RICHARDS, HENRY BRINLEY</label>
(1819-1865), English pianist and composer, was born at Carmarthen, and educated at the Royal Academy of Music in London, where later he was a professor. He took much interest in Welsh music and in the Eisteddfod gatherings. He was a prolific composer, but is perhaps principally remembered for writing the song “ God bless the Prince of Wales ” (1862), which has been adopted as an English national anthem.</p>
