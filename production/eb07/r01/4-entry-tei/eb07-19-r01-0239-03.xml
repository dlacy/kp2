<p><label>RIDING</label>
. See Horsemanship.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Riding, in naval affairs, is the state of a shipâ€™s being retained in a particular station, by means of one or more cables with their anchors, which are for this purpose sunk into the bottom of the sea, &amp;c. in order to prevent the vessel from being driven at the mercy of the wind or current. A rope is said to</hi> <hi rend="italic">ride,</hi> when one of the turns by which it is wound about the capstern or windlass lies over another, so as to interrupt the operation of heaving.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Riding</hi> <hi rend="italic">Athwart,</hi> the position of a ship which lies across the direction of the wind and tide, when the former is so strong as to prevent her from falling into the current of the latter.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Riding</hi> <hi rend="italic">between the Wind and Tide,</hi> the situation of a vessel at anchor, when the wind and tide act upon her in direct opposition, in such a manner as to destroy the effort of each other upon her hull ; so that she is in a manner balanced between their reciprocal force, and rides without the least strain on her cables. When a ship does not labour heavily, or feel a great strain when anchored in an open road or bay, she is said to ride easy. On the contrary, when she pitches violently into the sea, so as to strain her cables, masts, or hull, it is called <hi rend="italic">riding hard,</hi> and the vessel is termed a <hi rend="italic">bad roader.</hi></p>
