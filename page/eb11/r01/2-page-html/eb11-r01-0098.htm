<p><span class="font2">of the interference of light to this phenomenon. His not wholly satisfactory explanation was mathematically examined in 1835&nbsp;by Richard Potter </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Camb. Phil. Trans.</span><span class="font2">, 1838, 6, 141), who,&nbsp;while improving the theory, left a more complete solution to&nbsp;be made in 1838 by Sir George Biddell Airy </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Camb. Phil. Trans.,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">1838, 6, 379).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The geometrical theory first requires a consideration of the path of a ray of light falling upon a transparent sphere. Of the total&nbsp;amount of light falling on such a sphere, part is reflected or&nbsp;scattered at the incident surface, so rendering the drop&nbsp;visible, while a part will enter the drop. Confining our&nbsp;attention to a ray entering in a principal plane, we will&nbsp;determine its deviation, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i. e.</span><span class="font1"> the angle between its directions of&nbsp;incidence and emergence, after one, two, three or more internal&nbsp;reflections. Let EA be a ray incident at&nbsp;an angle </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i</span><span class="font1"> (fig. 1); let AD be the refracted&nbsp;ray, and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span class="font1"> the angle of refraction. Then&nbsp;the deviation experienced by the ray at&nbsp;A is </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i—r.</span><span class="font1"> If the ray suffers one internal&nbsp;reflection at D, then it is readily seen that,&nbsp;if DB be the path of the reflected ray, the&nbsp;angle ADB equals 2r, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i. e.</span><span class="font1"> the deviation of&nbsp;the ray at D is </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">π-2r.</span><span class="font1"> At B, where the&nbsp;ray leaves the drop, the deviation is the&nbsp;same as at A, viz. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i-r.</span><span class="font1"> The total deviation of the ray is consequently given by D = 2(</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i</span><span class="font1">-</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span class="font1">)+π-2</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span class="font1">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Similarly it may be shown that each internal reflection introduces a supplementary deviation of π-2</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span class="font1">; hence, if the ray be reflected&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">n</span><span class="font1"> times, the total deviation will be D=2(</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i</span><span class="font1">-</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span class="font1">)+</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">n</span><span class="font1">(π-2</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span class="font1">).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The deviation is thus seen to vary with the angle of incidence; and by considering a set of parallel rays passing through the same&nbsp;principal plane of the sphere and incident at all angles, it can be&nbsp;readily shown that more rays will pass in the neighbourhood of&nbsp;the position of minimum deviation than in any other position&nbsp;(see Refraction). The drop will consequently be more intensely&nbsp;illuminated when viewed along these  directions of minimum devia-tion, and since it is these rays with which we are primarily concerned,&nbsp;we shall proceed to the determination of these directions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Since the angles of incidence and refraction are connected by the relation sin </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i=μ</span><span class="font1"> sin </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span class="font1"> (Snell’s Law), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">μ</span><span class="font1"> being the index of refrac-tion of the medium, then the problem may be stated as follows:&nbsp;to determine the value of the angle </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i</span><span class="font1"> which makes D = 2 (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i</span><span class="font1">-</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span class="font1">) +</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">n</span><span class="font1">(π-2</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span class="font1">)&nbsp;a maximum or minimum, in which </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span class="font1"> are connected by the&nbsp;relation sin </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i=μ</span><span class="font1"> sin r, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">μ</span><span class="font1"> being a constant. By applying the method&nbsp;of the differential calculus, we obtain cos </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i=</span><span class="font1">√{(</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">μ</span><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup>-1)∕(</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">n</span><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup>+2n)} as&nbsp;the required value; it may be readily shown either geometrically&nbsp;or analytically that this is a minimum. For the angle </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i</span><span class="font1"> to be real,&nbsp;cos </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i</span><span class="font1"> must be a fraction, that is </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">n</span><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup>+2</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">n</span><span class="font1">&gt;μ<sup>2</sup>-1, or (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">n</span><span class="font1">+1)<sup>2</sup>&gt;μ<sup>2</sup>.&nbsp;Since the value of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">μ</span><span class="font1"> for water is about ⅘, it follows that </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">n </span><span class="font1">must&nbsp;be at least unity for a rainbow to be formed; there is obviously&nbsp;no theoretical limit to the value of », and hence rainbows of higher&nbsp;orders are possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">So far we have only considered rays of homogeneous light, and it remains to investigate how lights of varying refrangibilities will&nbsp;be transmitted. It can be shown, by the methods of the differential&nbsp;calculus or geometrically, that the deviation increases with the&nbsp;refractive index, the angle of incidence remaining constant. Taking&nbsp;the refractive index of water for the red rays as <sup>108</sup>/<sub>81</sub>, and for&nbsp;the violet rays as <sup>109</sup>/<sub>81</sub>, we can calculate the following values for&nbsp;the minimum deviations corresponding to certain assigned values&nbsp;of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">n.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">To this point we have only considered rays passing through a principal section of the drop; in nature, however, the rays impinge&nbsp;at every point of the surface facing the sun. It may be readily&nbsp;deduced that the directions of minimum deviation for a pencil of&nbsp;parallel rays lie on the surface of cones, the semi-vertical angles of&nbsp;which are equal to the values given in the above table. Thus, rays&nbsp;suffering one internal reflection will all lie within a cone of about&nbsp;42°; in this direction the illumination will be most intense; within&nbsp;the cone the illumination will be fainter, while, without it, no light&nbsp;will be transmitted to the eye.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Fig. 2 represents sections of the drop and the cones containing the minimum deviation rays after 1, 2, 3 and 4 reflections; the order&nbsp;of the colours is shown by the letters R (red) and V (violet). It is&nbsp;apparent, therefore, that all drops transmitting intense light after&nbsp;one internal reflection to the eye will lie on the surfaces of cones&nbsp;having the eye for their common vertex, the line joining the eye to&nbsp;the sun for their axis, and their semi-vertical angles equal to about&nbsp;41° for the violet rays and 43° for the red rays. The observer will, therefore, see a coloured band, about 2° in width, and coloured&nbsp;violet inside and red outside. Within the band, the illumination&nbsp;will be faint; outside the band there will be perceptible darkening&nbsp;until the second bow comes into view. Similarly, drops transmitting rays after two internal reflections will be situated on covertical&nbsp;and coaxial cones, of which the semi-vertical angles are 51° for the&nbsp;red rays and 54° for the violet. Outside the cone of 54° there will be&nbsp;faint illumination; within it, no secondary rays will be transmitted&nbsp;to the eye. We thus see that the order of colours in the secondary&nbsp;bow is the reverse of that in the primary; the secondary is half as&nbsp;broad again (3°), and is much fainter, owing to the longer path of the&nbsp;ray in the drop, and the increased dispersion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Similarly, the third, fourth and higher orders of bows may be investigated. The third and fourth bows are situated between the&nbsp;observer and the sun, and hence, to be viewed, the observer must&nbsp;face the sun. But the illumination of the bow is so weakened by the&nbsp;repeated reflections, and the light of the sun is generally so bright,&nbsp;that these bows are rarely, if ever, observed except in artificial&nbsp;rainbows. The same remarks apply to the fifth bow, which differs&nbsp;from the third and fourth in being situated in the same part of the&nbsp;sky as the primary and secondary bows, being just above the&nbsp;secondary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The most conspicuous colour band of the principal bows is the red; the other colours shading off into one another, generally with considerable blurring. This is due to the superposition of a great&nbsp;number of spectra, for the sun has an appreciable apparent diameter,&nbsp;and each point on its surface gives rise to an individual spectrum.&nbsp;This overlapping may become so pronounced as to produce a rain-bow in which colour is practically absent; this is particularly so&nbsp;when a thin cloud intervenes between the sun and the rain, which&nbsp;has the effect of increasing the apparent diameter of the sun to as&nbsp;much as 2° or 3°. This phenomenon is known as the “ white&nbsp;rainbow ” or “ Ulloa’s Ring or Circle, ” after Antonio de Ulloa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We have now to consider the so-called spurious bows which are sometimes seen at the inner edge of the primary and at the outer&nbsp;edge of the secondary bow. The geometrical theory can&nbsp;afford no explanation of these coloured bands, and it has&nbsp;been shown that the complete phenomenon of the rainbow&nbsp;is to be sought for in the conceptions of the wave theory of light.&nbsp;This was first suggested by Thomas Young, who showed that the&nbsp;rays producing the bows consisted of two systems, which, although&nbsp;emerging in parallel directions, traversed different paths in the drop.&nbsp;Destructive interference between these superposed rays will therefore occur, and, instead of a continuous maximum illumination in&nbsp;the direction of minimum deviation, we should expect to find&nbsp;alternations of brightness and darkness. The later investigations of&nbsp;Richard Potter and especially of Sir George Biddell Airy have proved&nbsp;the correctness of Young’s idea. The mathematical discussion&nbsp;of Airy showed that the primary rainbow is not situated directly&nbsp;on the line of minimum deviation, but </span><span class="font0">at </span><span class="font1">a slightly greater value;&nbsp;this means that the true angular radius of the bow is a little less than&nbsp;that derived from the geometrical theory. In the same way, he&nbsp;showed that the secondary bow has a greater radius than that&nbsp;previously assigned to it. The spurious bows he showed to consist&nbsp;of a series of dark and bright bands, whose distances from the&nbsp;principal bows vary with the diameters of the raindrops. The&nbsp;smaller the drops, the greater the distance; hence it is that the&nbsp;spurious bows are generally only observed near the summits of the&nbsp;bows, where the drops are smaller than at any lower altitude. In&nbsp;Airy’s investigation, and in the extensions by Boitel, J. Larmor,&nbsp;E. Mascart and L. Lorentz, the source of light was regarded as a&nbsp;point. In nature, however, this is not realized, for the sun has an&nbsp;appreciable diameter. Calculations taking this into account have&nbsp;been made by J. Pernter </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Neues über den Regenbogen,</span><span class="font1"> Vienna, 1888)&nbsp;and by K. Aichi and T. Tanakadate </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Jour. College of Science,</span><span class="font1"> Tokyo,&nbsp;1906, vol. xxi. art. 3).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Experimental confirmation of Airy’s theoretical results was af-forded in 1842 by William Hallows Miller </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Camb. Phil. Trans.</span><span class="font1"> vii. 277). A horizontal pencil of sunlight was admitted by a vertical&nbsp;slit, and then allowed to fall on a column of water supplied by </span><span class="font0">a </span><span class="font1">jet&nbsp;of about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>50</sub>th of an inch in diameter. Primary, secondary and&nbsp;spurious bows were formed, and their radii measured; a comparison of these observations exhibited agreement with Airy’s&nbsp;analytical values. Pulfrich </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Wied. Ann.,</span><span class="font1"> 1888, 33, 194) obtained&nbsp;similar results by using cylindrical glass rods in place of the column&nbsp;of water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In accordance with a general consequence of reflection and refraction, it is readily seen that the light of the rainbow is partially polarized, a fact first observed in 1811 by Jean Baptiste Biot (see&nbsp;Polarization).</span></p>
