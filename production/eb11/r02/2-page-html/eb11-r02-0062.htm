<p><span class="font2">RENNELL, JAMES (1742-1830), British geographer, was born on the 3rd of December 1742, near Chudleigh ih Devonshire.&nbsp;His father, an officer in the Artillery, was killed in action shortly&nbsp;after the birth of his son. He entered the navy as a midshipman in 1756, and was present at the attack on Cherbourg&nbsp;(1758), and the disastrous action of St Cast in the same year.&nbsp;At the end of the Seven Years’ AVar, seeing no chance of promotion, he entered the service of the East India Company, and&nbsp;was appointed surveyor of the Company’s dominions in Bengal&nbsp;(1764), with the rank of captain in the Bengal Engineers. To&nbsp;this work he devoted the next thirteen years. In 1766 he&nbsp;received a severe wound in an encounter with some Sannyasis,&nbsp;or religious fanatics, from which he never thoroughly recovered;&nbsp;and in 1777 he retired as major on a pension of £600 a year.&nbsp;The remaining fifty-three years of his life were spent in London,&nbsp;and were devoted to geographical research chiefly among the&nbsp;materials in the East India House. His most valuable works&nbsp;include the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bengal Atlas</span><span class="font2"> (1779), the first approximately correct&nbsp;map of India (1783), the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Geographical System of Herodotus</span><span class="font2"> (1800),&nbsp;the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Comparative Geography of Western Asia</span><span class="font2"> (1831), and important studies on the geography of northern Africa—in introductions to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Travels</span><span class="font2"> of Mungo Park and Hornemann—and&nbsp;the currents of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. He also&nbsp;contributed papers to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Archaeologia</span><span class="font2"> on the site of Babylon, the&nbsp;island of St Paul’s shipwreck, and the landing-place of Caesar&nbsp;in Britain. He was elected F.R.S. in 1781; and he received&nbsp;the Copley medal of the Royal Society in 1791, and the gold&nbsp;medal of the Royal Society of Literature in 1825. While in&nbsp;India he had married (1772) Jane Thackeray, a great-aunt of&nbsp;the novelist. He died on the 29th of March 1830, and was&nbsp;buried in the nave of Westminster Abbey.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">RENNES, a town of western France, formerly the capital of Brittany and now the chief town of the department of Ille-et-Vilaine. Pop. town, 62,024; commune, 75,640. Rennes is&nbsp;situated at the meeting of the Ille and the Vilaine and at the&nbsp;junction of several fines of railway connecting it with Paris&nbsp;(232 m. E.N.E.), St Malo (51 m. N.N.W.), Brest (155 m.&nbsp;W.N.W.). A few narrow winding streets with old houses are&nbsp;left in the vicinity of the cathedral, but the town was for the&nbsp;most part rebuilt on a regular plan after thé seven days’ fire of&nbsp;1720. Dark granite was used as building material. The old&nbsp;town or Ville-Haute, where the chief buildings are situated,&nbsp;occupies a hill bounded on the south by the Vilaine, on the&nbsp;west by the canalized IUe. The Vilaine flows in a deep hollow&nbsp;bordered with quays and crossed by six bridges leading to the&nbsp;new town or Ville-Basse on its left bank. The cathedral of&nbsp;Rennes was rebuilt in a pseudo-ionic style between 1787 and&nbsp;1844 on the site of two churches dating originally from the&nbsp;4th century. The west façade with its twin towers was finished&nbsp;in 1700 and is in the Renaissance style. The interior is richly&nbsp;decorated, a German altar-piece of the 15th century being&nbsp;conspicuous for its carving and gilding. The archbishop’s&nbsp;palace occupies in part the site of the abbey dedicated to St&nbsp;Melaine, whose church is the sole specimen of n-i3th century architecture among the numerous churches in the town.&nbsp;A colossal statue of the Virgin was placed above its dome in&nbsp;1867. The Mordelaise Gate, by which the dukes and bishops&nbsp;used to make their state entry into the town, is a curious example&nbsp;of 15th-century architecture, and preserves a Latin inscription&nbsp;of the 3rd century, a dedication by the Redones to the emperor&nbsp;Gordianus. The finest building in Rennes is the old parliament&nbsp;house (now the law-court), designed by Jacques Debrosse in&nbsp;the 17th century, and decorated with statues of legal celebrities,&nbsp;carving, and paintings by Jean Jouvenet and other well-known&nbsp;artists. The town haU was erected in the first half of the 18th&nbsp;century. It contains the library and the municipal archives,&nbsp;which are of great importance for the history of Brittany. In&nbsp;the Palais Universitaire, a modern building occupied by the&nbsp;university, there are scientific collections and important galleries&nbsp;of painting and sculpture, the chief work being the “ Perseus&nbsp;delivering Andromeda ” of Paul Veronese. About 2 m. from&nbsp;the town is the castle (16th century) of La Prévalaye, a hamlet&nbsp;famous for its butter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Rennes is the seat of an archbishop and a prefect, headquarters of the X. army corps and centre of an </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">académie</span><span class="font2"> (educational division). Its university has faculties of law, science and letters, and a preparatory school of medicine and pharmacy,&nbsp;and there are training colleges, a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">lycée</span><span class="font2"> and schools of agriculture,&nbsp;dairying, music, art, architecture and industry </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(École pratique).&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">The town is also the seat of a court of appeal, of a court of&nbsp;assizes, of tribunals of first instance and commerce, and of a&nbsp;chamber of commerce, and has a branch of the Bank of France.&nbsp;Tanning, iron-founding, timber-sawing and the production of&nbsp;furniture and wooden goods, flour-milling, flax-spinning and the&nbsp;manufacture of tenting and other coarse fabrics, bleaching and&nbsp;various smaUer industries are carried on. Trade is chiefly in&nbsp;butter made in the neighbourhood, and in grain, flour, leather,&nbsp;poultry, eggs and honey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Rennes, the chief c.ty of the Redones, was formerly (like some other places in Gaul) caUed Condate (hence </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Condat,</span><span class="font2"> Condé),&nbsp;probably from its position at the confluence of two streams.&nbsp;Under the Roman empire it was included in Lugdunensis Tertia,&nbsp;and became the centre </span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font2">various Roman roads still recognizable&nbsp;in the vicinity <sup>r</sup>Fhe name </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Urbs Rubra</span><span class="font2"> given to it on the oldest&nbsp;chronicles is explained by the bands of red brick in the foundations of its first circuit of walls. About the close of the 10th&nbsp;century Conan Ie Tort, count of Rennes, subdued the whole&nbsp;province, and his son and successor Geoffrey first took the title&nbsp;duke of Brittany. The dukes were crowned at Rennes, and&nbsp;before entering the city by the Mordelaise Gate they had to&nbsp;swear to preserve the privileges of the church, the nobles and&nbsp;the commons of Brittany. During the War of Succession the&nbsp;city more than once suffered siege, notably in 1356-57, when&nbsp;Bertrand du Gu’escfin saved it from capture by the Engfish&nbsp;under Henry, first duke of Lancaster. The parlement of&nbsp;Brittany, founded in 1551, held its sessions at Rennes from 1561,&nbsp;they having been previously shared with Nantes. During the&nbsp;troubles of the League Phifip Emmanuel, duke of Mercoeur,&nbsp;attempted to make himself independent at Rennes (1589), but&nbsp;his scheme was defeated by the loyalty of the parlement.&nbsp;Henry IV. entered the city in state on the 9th of May 1598.&nbsp;In 1675 an insurrection at Rennes, caused by the taxes imposed&nbsp;by Louis XIV. in spite of the advice of the parlement, was&nbsp;cruelly suppressed by Charles, duke of Chaulnes, governor of&nbsp;the province. The parlement was banished to Vannes till 1689,&nbsp;and the inhabitants crushed with forfeits and put to death in&nbsp;great numbers. The fire of 1720, which destroyed eight hundred&nbsp;houses, completed the ruin of the town. At the beginning of&nbsp;the Revolution Rennes was again the scene of bloodshed, caused&nbsp;by the discussion about doubling the third estate for the convocation of the states-general. In January 1789, Jean Victor&nbsp;Moreau (afterwards general) led the law-students in their&nbsp;demonstrations on behalf of the parlement against the royal&nbsp;government. During the Reign*of Terror Rennes suffered less&nbsp;than Nantes, partly through the courage and uprightness of the&nbsp;mayor, Jean Leperdit. It was soon afterwards the centre of the&nbsp;operations of the Republican army against the Vendeans. The&nbsp;bishopric, founded in the 5th century, in 1859 became an archbishopric, a rank to which it had previously been raised from&nbsp;1790 to 1802. In 1899 the revision of the sentence of Captain&nbsp;Alfred Dreyfus was carried out at Rennes.</span></p>
