<p><span class="font1">apparently about 1645, in the picture exhibited in the winter exhibition at Burlington House in 1885. Reverence and awe are shown in every attitude of the Tobit family. A similar lofty treatment is&nbsp;to be found in the “ Christ as the Gardener,” appearing to Mary, of&nbsp;1638 (Buckingham Palace).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We have now arrived at the year 1640, the threshold of his second manner, which extended to 1654, the middle age of&nbsp;Rembrandt. During the latter part of the previous decade we&nbsp;find the shadows more transparent and the blending of light&nbsp;and shade more perfect. There is a growing power in every&nbsp;part of his art. The coldness of his first manner had disappeared,&nbsp;and the tones were gradually changing into golden-brown. He&nbsp;had passed through what Bode calls his “ Sturm-und-Drang ”&nbsp;period of exaggerated expression, as in the Berlin Samson, and&nbsp;had attained to a truer, calmer form of dramatic expression, of&nbsp;which the “ Manoah ” of Dresden is a good example (1641).&nbsp;The portraits painted “ to order ” became more rare about this&nbsp;time, and those which we have are chiefly friends of his circle,&nbsp;such as the “ Mennonite Preacher ” (C. C. Ansloo) and the&nbsp;“ Gilder,” a fine example of his golden tone, formerly in the&nbsp;Morny collection and now in America. His own splendid&nbsp;portrait (1640) in the National Gallery illustrates the change in&nbsp;his work. It describes the man well—strong and robust, with&nbsp;powerful head, firm and compressed lips and determined chin,&nbsp;with heavy eyebrows, separated by a deep vertical furrow, and&nbsp;with eyes of keen penetrating glance—altogether a self-reliant&nbsp;man that would carry out his own ideas, careless whether his&nbsp;popularity waxed or waned. The fantastic rendering of himself&nbsp;has disappeared; he seems more conscious of his dignity and&nbsp;position. He has now many friends and pupils, and numerous&nbsp;commissions, even from the stadtholder; he has bought a large&nbsp;house in the Breedstraat, in which during the next sixteen years&nbsp;of his life he gathers his large collection of paintings, engravings,&nbsp;armour and costume which figure afterwards in his inventory.&nbsp;His taste was wide and his purchases large, for he was joint&nbsp;owner with picture-dealers of paintings by Giorgione and Palma&nbsp;Vccchio, while for a high-priced Marcantonio Raimondi print&nbsp;he gave in exchange a fine impression of his “ Christ Healing&nbsp;the Sick,” which has since been known as the “ Hundred Guilder&nbsp;Print.” The stadtholder was not a prompt payer, and an&nbsp;interesting correspondence took place between Rembrandt and&nbsp;Constantin Huygens, the poet and secretary of the prince. The&nbsp;Rembrandt letters which have come down to us are few, and&nbsp;these are therefore of importance. Rembrandt puts a high&nbsp;value on the picture, which he says had been painted “ with&nbsp;much care and zeal,” but he is willing to take what the prince&nbsp;thinks proper; while to Huygens he sends a large picture as a&nbsp;present for his trouble in carrying through the business. There&nbsp;is here no sign of the grasping greed with which he has been&nbsp;charged, while his unselfish conduct is seen in the settlement of&nbsp;the family affairs at the death of his mother in 1640.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The year 1642 is remarkable for the great picture formerly known as the “ Night Watch,” but now more correctly as the “ Sortie&nbsp;of the Banning Cock Company,” another of the landmarks of Rembrandt’s career, in which twenty-nine life-sized civic guards are&nbsp;introduced issuing pell-mell. from their club house. Such gilds&nbsp;of arquebusiers had been painted admirably before by Ravesteyn&nbsp;and notably by Frans Hals, but Rembrandt determined to throw&nbsp;life and animation into the scene, which is full of bustle and movement. The dominant colour is the citron yellow uniform of the&nbsp;lieutenant, wearing a blue sash, while a Titian-like red dress of a&nbsp;musketeer, the black velvet dress of the captain, and the varied&nbsp;green of the girl and drummer, all produce a rich and harmonious&nbsp;effect. The background has become dark and heavy by accident&nbsp;or neglect, and the scutcheon on which the names are painted is&nbsp;scarcely to be seen. It is to be observed that, as proved by the&nbsp;copy by Gerrit Lundens in the National Gallery, it represents not a&nbsp;“ night watch,” except in name, but a day watch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But this year of great achievement was also the year of his great loss, for Saskia died in </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">i6a2,</span><span class="font1"> leaving Rembrandt her sole trustee&nbsp;for her son Titus, but with full use of the money till he should&nbsp;marry again or till the marriage of Titus. The words of the will&nbsp;express her love for her husband and her confidence in him. With&nbsp;her death his life was changed. Bode has remarked that there&nbsp;is a.pathetic sadness in his pictures of the Holy Family—a favourite&nbsp;subject at this period of his life, All of these he treats with the&nbsp;naïve simplicity of Reformed Holland, giving us the real carpenter's&nbsp;shop and the mother watching over the Infant reverently and&nbsp;lovingly, with a fine union of realism and idealism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The street in which he lived was full of Dutch and Portuguese Jews, and many a Jewish rabbi sat to him. He accepted or invented&nbsp;their turbans and local dress as characteristic of the people. But&nbsp;in his religious pictures it is not the costume we look at; what&nbsp;strikes us is the profound perception of the sentiment of the story,&nbsp;making them true to all time and independent of local circumstance.&nbsp;A notable example of this feeling is to be found in the “ Woman&nbsp;Taken in Adultery ” of the National Gallery, painted in 1644 in&nbsp;the manner of the “ Simeon ” of the Hague. Beyond the ordinary&nbsp;claims of art, it commands our attention from the grand conception&nbsp;of the painter who here, as in other pictures and etchings, has invested&nbsp;Christ with a majestic dignity which recalls Lionardo and no other.&nbsp;A similar lofty ideal is to be found in his various renderings of the&nbsp;“ Pilgrims at Emmaus,” notably in the Louvre picture of 1648,&nbsp;in which, as Mrs Jameson says, &quot; he returns to those first spiritual&nbsp;principles which were always the dowry of ancient art.” From the&nbsp;same year we have the. “ Good Samaritan ” of the Louvre, the story&nbsp;of which is told with intense pathos. The helpless suffering of the&nbsp;wounded man,.the curiosity of the boy on tiptoe, the excited faces&nbsp;at the upper window, are all conveyed with masterly skill. In these&nbsp;last two pictures we find a broader touch and freer handling, while&nbsp;the tones pass into a dull yellow and brown with a marked predilection for deep rich red. Whether it was that this scheme of&nbsp;colour found no favour with the Amsterdamers, who, as Hoog-straten tells us, could not understand the “ Sortie,” it seems certain&nbsp;that Rembrandt was not invited to take any leading part in the&nbsp;celebration of the congress of Westphalia (1648).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rembrandt touched no side of art without setting his mark on it, whether in still life, as in his dead birds or the “ Slaughtered Ox ”&nbsp;of the Louyre (with its repetitions at Glasgow and Budapest), or&nbsp;in his drawings of elephants and lions, all of which are instinct with&nbsp;life. But at this period of his career we come upon a branch of&nbsp;his art on which he left, both in etching and impainting, the stamp&nbsp;of his genius, viz. landscape. Roeland Roghman, but ten years&nbsp;his senior, evidently influenced his style, for the resemblance between&nbsp;their works is so great that, as at Cassel, there has been confusion&nbsp;of authorship. Hercules Seghers also was much appreciated by&nbsp;Rembrandt, for at his sale eight pictures by this master figure in&nbsp;the inventory, and Vosmaer discovered that Rembrandt had worked&nbsp;on a plate by Seghers and had added figures to an etched “ Flight&nbsp;into Egypt.' The earliest pure landscape known to us from Rem-brandt’s hand is that at the Ryks Museum (1637-38), followed in&nbsp;the latter year by those at Brunswick<sub>f</sub>Cracow and Boston (U.S.A.),&nbsp;and that dated 1638 and belonging to Mr G. Rath in Budapest.&nbsp;Better known is the “ Winter Scene ” of Cassel (1646), silvery and&nbsp;delicate. As a rule in his painted landscape he aims at grandeur&nbsp;and poetical effect, as in the “ Repose of the Holy Family ” of&nbsp;1647 (formerly called the “ Gipsies ”), a moonlight effect, clear&nbsp;even in the shadows. The “ Canal ” of Lord Lansdowne, and the&nbsp;“ Mountain Landscape with Approaching Storm,” the sun shining&nbsp;out behind the heavy clouds, are both conceived and executed in&nbsp;this spirit. A similar poetical vein runs through the “ Castle&nbsp;on the Hill ” of Cassel, in which the beams of the setting sun strike&nbsp;on the castle while the valley is sunk in the shades of approaching&nbsp;night. More powerful still is the weird effect of Lord Lansdowne's&nbsp;“ Windmill,” with its glow of light and darkening shadows. In&nbsp;all these pictures light with its magical influences is the theme of&nbsp;the poet-painter. From the number of landscapes by himself in&nbsp;the inventory of his sale, it would appear that these grand works&nbsp;were not. appreciated by his contemporaries. The last of the&nbsp;landscape series dates from 1655 or 1656, the close of the middle&nbsp;age or manhood of Rembrandt, a period of splendid power. In the&nbsp;“ Joseph Accused by Potiphar's Wife ” of 1654 we have great&nbsp;dramatic vigour and perfect mastery’ of expression, while the&nbsp;brilliant colour and glowing effect of light and shade attest his&nbsp;strength. To this period also belongs the great portrait of himself&nbsp;in the Fitzwilliam Museum at Cambridge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But evil days were at hand. The long-continued wars and civil troubles had worn out the country, and money was scarce.&nbsp;Rembrandt’s and doubtless Saskia’s means were tied up in his&nbsp;house and in his large collection of valuable pictures, and we find&nbsp;Rembrandt borrowing considerable sums of money on the security&nbsp;of his house to keep things going. Perhaps, as Bode suggests,&nbsp;this was the reason of his extraordinary activity at this time.&nbsp;Then, unfortunately, in this year of 1654, we find Rembrandt&nbsp;involved in the scandal of having a child by his servant Hendrickje&nbsp;Jaghers or Stoffels, as appears by the books of the Reformed&nbsp;Church at Amsterdam. He recognized the child and gave it 'the&nbsp;name of Cornelia, after his much-loved mother, but there is no&nbsp;proof that he married the mother, and the probability is against&nbsp;such a marriage, as the provisions of Saskia’s will would in that&nbsp;case have come into force, and her fortune would have passed&nbsp;at once to her son Titus. Hendrickje* seems to have continued</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
