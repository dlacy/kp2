For gondoliers who have loſt the race often declare, that witchcraft had been practiſed againſt them, or certainly they muſt have won the day. Such a ſuppoſition prevents a poor fellow from thinking ill of himſelf ; an opinion that might be favourable to him another time.</p><p>The courſe is about four miles. Tlie boats ſtart ſrom a certain place, run through the great winding canal, which divides the town into two parts, turn round a picket-, and, coming back the fame way, go and ſeize the prize, which is fixed at the acuteſt angle of the great canal, on the convex ſide, ſo that the point of fight may he the more extended, and the prize ſeized in the ſight of the ſpectators on both ſides.</p><p>According to the number of competitors, different races are performed in different ſorts of boats ; ſome with ∙ one oar and others with two. The prizes propoſed are four, indicated by four flags of different colours, with the different value of the prizes marked upon them.— Theſe flags, public and glorious monuments, are the prizes to which the competitors particularly aſpire. But the government always adds to each a genteel ſum of money ; befides that the conquerors, immediately after the victory, are ſurroundtd by all the <hi rend="italic">beau monde,</hi>  who congratulate and make them pref<hi rend="sup">,</hi>μts ; after which they go, bearing their honourable trophy in their hand, down the whole length of the canal, and receive the applauſe of innumerable fpectat0r3.</p><p>This grand canal, ever ſtriking by the ſingularity and beauty of the buildings which border it, is, upon theſe occaſions, covered with an infinity of ſpectators, in all ſorts of barges, boats, and gondolas. The element on whieh they move is ſearcely ſeen ; but the noiſe of' oars, the agitation of arms and bodies in perpetual motion, indicate tbe fpectacle to be upon the water. At certain diſtances, on each ſide of the ſhore, are erected little amphitheatres and ſcaffoldings, where are placed bands of muſic ; the harmonious found of which predominates now and then over the buzzing nυile of the people. Some days before a <hi rend="italic">regata,</hi>  one may ſee on the great canal many boats for pleafιue and entertainment. The young noble, the citizen, the rich artizan, mounts a long boat of ſix or eight oars ; his gondoliers decorated with rich and ſingular dreffes, and the veffel itſelf adorned with various ſtuffs. Among thc nobles there are always a number who are at a conſiderable expence in theſe decorations ; and at the <hi rend="italic">regate</hi>  it-ſelf ' exhibit on the water perſonages of mythologie ſtory, with the heroes of antiquity in their train, or amufe themſelves with repreſenting the coſtumi of different nations ; in ſhort, people contribute with a mad fort of magnificence, from all quarters, to this maſque-rade, the favourite diverlion of the venetians. But theſe great machines, not being the lefs in motion on account of their ornaments, are not merely deſtined to grace the ſhow : they are employed at the regata, at every moment, to range the people, to protect the courſe, and to keep the avenue open and clear to the goal. The nobility, kneeling upon cuſhions at the prow of their veffels, are attentive to theſe matters, and announce their orders to the moſt reſtive, by darting at them Jittle gilded or ſilvered balls, by means of certain bows, with which they are furniſhed on this occaſion.</p><p>And this is the only appearance of coercion in the VC-uetian police on theſe days of the greateſt tumult : nor is there to be ſeen, in any part of the city, a body of guards or patrol, nor even a gun or a halbert. The mildneſs of the nation, its gaiety, its education in the habit oſ believing that the government is ever awake, that it knows and fees every thing ; its reſpectfid attachment to the body of patricians ; the ſole afpect of certain officers of the police in their robes, diſperſed in different places, at once operate and explain that tran-quillity, that ſecurity, which we ſee in the midſt oſ the greateſt confuſion, and that ſurpriſing docility in ſo lively and fiery a people. Regattas have been attempted on the river Thames, but they were but humble imitations oſ tbe venetian amuſement.</p><p>REGEL, or Rigel, a fixed ſtar oſ the ſirſt magnitude, in Orion’s leſt foot.</p><p>REGENERATION, ill theology, the act of being born again by a ſpiritual birth, or the change oſ heart and life experienced by a perſon who ſorſakes a courſe oſ vice, and ſincerely embraces a life oſ virtne and piety.</p><p>REGENSBURG, or Ratisbon. See Ratisbon.</p><p>REGENT, one who governs a kingdom during the minority or abſence oſ the king.</p><p>In France, the queen-mother had the regency oſ the kingdom during the minority oſ the king, under the title oſ <hi rend="italic">queen-regent.</hi></p><p>In England, the methods oſ appointir∕ this guardian or regent have been ſo various, and the duration oſ his power ſo uncertain, that ſrom hence alont it may be collected that his office is unknown to the common law ; aud therefore (as Sir Edward Coke ſays, 4 Inſt. 58.) the ſureſt way is to have him made by authority oſ the great council in parliament. The earl of Pembroke by his own authority affumed in very troubleſome times the regency oſ Henry III. who was then only nine years old ; but was declared of full age by the pope at 17, confirmed the great charter at ιb, and took upon him the adminiſtration oſ the government at 20. A guardian and councils oſ regency were named for Edward III. by the parliament, which depofed his father ; the young king being then 1 5, and not affuming the government till three years after, when Richard II. ſucceeded' at the age of 11, the duke oſ Lancaſter took upon him the management oſ the kingdom till the parliament met, rvhich appointed a nominal council to affiſthim. Henry V. on his death-bed named a regent and a guar-dian ſor his infant ſon Henry VI. then nine months old t but the parliament altered his diſpoſition, and appointed a protector and council, with a ſpecial limited authority. Both theſe princes remained iu a ſtate oſ pupilage till the age oſ 23. Edward V. at tlie age oſ 13, was recommended by his father to the care oſ the duke of <hi rend="sub">f</hi>Glouceſter; who was declared protector by the privy-council. The ſtatutes 25 Hen. VIII. c. 12. and 28' Hen. VIII. c. 7. provided, that the fucceiſor, if a male and under 18, or if a female and under 16, ſhould he till ſuch age in tbe governance of his or her natural mother, (if approved by the king), and ſuch other counſellors as his majeſty ſhould by will or otherwiſe appoint : and he accordingly appointed his 16 executors· to have the government of his ion Edward VI. and the kingdom, which executors elected the eaιl of Hartford protector. Tlιe ſtatutes 24 Geo. II. c. 24. in caſe the crown ſhould deſcend to any of the children of Frederic late prince of wales under the age of 18, appointed the prîncefs dowager ;—and that of 5 Geo.
