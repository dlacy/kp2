<p><span class="font0">tion. And fir will safely bear a strain of two tons for every square inch. But we are obliged to give the tie-beam&nbsp;much larger dimensions, that we may be able to connect it&nbsp;with the foot of the rafter by a mortise and tenon. Iron&nbsp;straps are also frequently added. By attending to this office of the tie-beam, the judicious carpenter is directed to&nbsp;the proper form of the mortise and tenon, and of the strap.&nbsp;We shall consider both of these in a proper place, after we&nbsp;become acquainted with the various strains at the joints of&nbsp;a roof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">These large dimensions of the tie-beam allow us to load it with the ceilings without any risk, and even to lay floors&nbsp;on it with moderation and caution. But when it has a great&nbsp;bearing or span, it is very apt to bend downwards in the&nbsp;middle, or, as the workmen term it, to sway or swag ; and&nbsp;it requires a support. The question is, where to find this&nbsp;support. What fixed points can we find with which to&nbsp;connect the middle of the tie-beam ? Some ingenious carpenter thought of suspending it from the ridge by a piece&nbsp;of timber BD (fig. 15), called</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">by our carpenters the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">king-post.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It must be acknowledged, that</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">there was very great ingenuity</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">in this thought. It was also per</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">fectly just. For the weight of</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">the rafters BA, BC tends to</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">make them fly out at the foot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This is prevented by the tie-</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">beam, and this excites a pressure, by which they tend to compress each other. Suppose them without weight, and that a great weight is laid on the ridge B. This can be supported&nbsp;only by the abutting of the rafters in their own directions AB&nbsp;and CB, and the weight tends to compress them in the opposite directions, and, through their intervention, to stretch&nbsp;the tie-beam. If neither the rafters can be compressed, nor&nbsp;the tie-beam stretched, it is plain that the triangle ABC&nbsp;must retain its shape, and that B becomes a fixed point&nbsp;very proper to be used as a point of suspension. To this&nbsp;point, therefore, is the tie-beam suspended by means of the&nbsp;king-post. A common spectator unacquainted with carpentry views it very differently, and the tie-beam appears to&nbsp;him to carry the roof. The king-post appears a pillar resting on the beam, whereas it is really a string ; and an iron&nbsp;rod of one sixteenth of the size would have done just as&nbsp;well. The king-post is sometimes mortised into the tie-beam, and pins put through the joint, which gives it more&nbsp;the look of a pillar with the roof resting on it. This does&nbsp;well enough in many cases. But the best method is to&nbsp;connect them by an iron strap like a stirrup, which is bolted&nbsp;at its upper ends into the king-post, and passes</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">round the tie-beam. In this way a space is commonly left between the end of the kingpost and the upper side of the tie-beam. Here&nbsp;the beam plainly appears hanging in the stirrup ; and this method allows us to restore the&nbsp;beam to an exact level, when it has sunk by&nbsp;the unavoidable compression or other yielding&nbsp;of the parts. The holes in the sides of the&nbsp;iron strap are made oblong instead of round ;&nbsp;and the bolt which is drawn through all is made&nbsp;to taper on the under side ; so that driving it&nbsp;farther draws the tie-beam upwards. A notion of this may&nbsp;be formed by looking at fig. 16, which is a section of that&nbsp;post and beam.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It requires considerable attention, however, to make this suspension of the tie-beam sufficiently firm. The top of the&nbsp;king-post is cut into the form of the arch-stone of a bridge,&nbsp;and the heads of the rafters are firmly mortised into this&nbsp;projecting part. These projections are called joggles, and&nbsp;are formed by working the king-post out of a much larger&nbsp;piece of timber, and cutting off the unnecessary wood from</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">the two sides ; and, lest all this should not be sufficient, it is usual in great works to add an iron plate or strap of three '&nbsp;branches, which are bolted into the heads of the king-post&nbsp;and rafters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The rafters, though not so long as the beam, seem to stand as much in need of something to prevent their bending, for they carry the weight of the covering. This cannot&nbsp;be done by suspension, for we have no fixed points above&nbsp;them. But we have now got</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">a very firm point of support</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">at the foot of the king-post.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Braces,</span><span class="font0"> or rather </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">struts,</span><span class="font0"> ED,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">FD (fig. 17), are put under the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">middle of the rafters, where</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">they are slightly mortised, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">their lower ends are firmly</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">mortised into joggles formed</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">on the foot of the king-post.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As these braces are very powerful in their resistance to compression, and the king-post equally so to resist extension, the points E and F may be considered as fixed ; and the&nbsp;rafters being thus reduced to half their former length, have&nbsp;now four times their former relative strength.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Roofs do not always consist of two sloping sides meeting ( in a ridge. They have sometimes a flat on the top, with t&nbsp;two slopping sides. They are sometimes formed with a<sup>t,&nbsp;</sup>double slope, and are called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">kirb</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">mansarde roofs.</span><span class="font0"> They <sup>r</sup>'&nbsp;sometimes have a valley in the middle, and are then called&nbsp;M roofs. Such roofs require another piece, which may be&nbsp;called the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">truss-beam,</span><span class="font0"> because all such frames are called&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">trusses,</span><span class="font0"> probably from the French word </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">trousse,</span><span class="font0"> because&nbsp;such roofs are like portions of plain roofs </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">troussés</span><span class="font0"> or shortened.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A flat-topped roof is thus constructed. Suppose the three rafters AB, BC, CD (fig. 18),&nbsp;of which AB and CD are&nbsp;equal, and BC horizontal. It&nbsp;is plain that they will be in&nbsp;equilibrio, and the roof have&nbsp;no tendency to go on either&nbsp;side. The tie-beam AD withstands the horizontal thrusts&nbsp;of the whole frame, and the&nbsp;two rafters AB and CD are&nbsp;each pressed in their own directions in consequence of their abutting with the middle&nbsp;rafter or truss-beam BC. It lies between them like the&nbsp;key-stone of an arch. They lean towards it, and it rests&nbsp;on them. The pressure which the truss-beam and its&nbsp;load excites on the two rafters is the very same as if the&nbsp;rafters were produced till they meet in G, and a weight&nbsp;were laid on these equal to that of BC and its load. If&nbsp;therefore the truss-beara is of a scantling sufficient for carrying its own load, and withstanding the compression from&nbsp;the two rafters, the roof will be equally strong, whilst it&nbsp;keeps its shape, as the plain roof AGD, furnished with&nbsp;the king-post and braces. We may conceive this another&nbsp;way. Suppose a plain roof AGD, without braces to support the middle B and C of the rafters. Then let a&nbsp;beam BC be put in between the rafters, abutting upon little&nbsp;notches cut in the rafters. It is evident that this must prevent the rafters from bending downwards, because the points&nbsp;B and C cannot descend, moving round the centres A and&nbsp;D, without shortening the distance BC between them. This&nbsp;cannot be without compressing the beam BC. It is plain&nbsp;that BC may be wedged in, or wedges driven in between&nbsp;its ends B and C and the notches in which it is lodged.&nbsp;These wedges may be driven in till they even force out&nbsp;the rafters GA and GD. Whenever this happens, all the&nbsp;mutual pressure of the heads of these rafters at G is taken&nbsp;away, and the parts GB and GC may be cut away, and the</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
