<p><span class="font0">The earl defended himſelf with ſuch reſolution, that he had diſpatched one of the aggreſſors, when a gentleman paſſing that way took his part, and diſarmed&nbsp;another, on which the third ſought his ſafety in flight.&nbsp;This generous aſſiſtant was a diſhanded officer of good&nbsp;family and fair reputation, bpt reduced to poverty ;&nbsp;and his lordihip rewarded his bravery by refigning to&nbsp;him his poſt of captain of the guards. He at length&nbsp;returned to London ; when he was made matter of the&nbsp;horſe to the ducheſs of York, and married the lady&nbsp;Frances, eldeſt daughter of Richard earl of Burlington, who had been the wife of Colonel Courtney. He&nbsp;here diſtinguiſhed himſelf by his writings : and in imitation of thoſe learned and polite aſſtmblies with which&nbsp;he had been acquainted abroad, began to form a ſo-,ciety ſor refining and fixing the ſtandard of the Engliſh language, in which his great friend Mr Dryden&nbsp;was a principal aſſiſtant. This ſcheme was entirely defeated by the religious commotions which enſued on&nbsp;king James’s acceſſion to the throne. In 1683 he was&nbsp;ſeized with the gout ; and being too impatient of pain,&nbsp;he permitted a bold French empiric to apply a repelling medicine, in order to give him preſent relief; which&nbsp;drove the diſtemper into his bowels, and in a ſhort time&nbsp;put a period to his life, in January 1684. He was&nbsp;buried with great pomp in Weſtrmnſter-abbey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">His poems, which are not numerous, are in the body of Engliſh poetry collected by Dr Johnſon. His&nbsp;*<sup>t</sup> Eſſay on Tranſlated Verſe,” and his tranſlation of&nbsp;<sup>te</sup> Horace’s Art of Poetry,” have great merit. Waller addreſſed a poem to his lordſhip upon the latter,&nbsp;when he was 73 years of age. “ in the writings of&nbsp;this nobleman we view (fays Fenton) the image of a&nbsp;mind naturally ſerious and folid ; richly furniſhed and&nbsp;adorned with all the ornaments of art and ſcience ; and&nbsp;thoſe ornaments unaffectedly diſpoſed in the moſt regular and elegant order. His imagination might probably have been more fruitful and ſprightly, if his judgement had been leſs ſevere ; but that ſeverity (delivered&nbsp;in a maſculine, clear, ſuccinct ftyle) contributed to&nbsp;make him ſo eminent in the didactical manner, that no&nbsp;man, with juſtice, can affirm he was ever equalled by&nbsp;any of our nation, without confeſſing at the ſame time&nbsp;that he is inferior to none. In ſome other kinds of&nbsp;writing his genius ſeems to have wanted fire to attain&nbsp;the point of perfection ; but who can attain it ? He&nbsp;was a man of an amiable diſpoſition, as well as a good&nbsp;poet ; as Pope, in his * Eſſay on Criticifm,<sup>,</sup> hath teſti-fied in the following lines :</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">--Roſcommon not more learn’d than good,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">With manners generous as his noble blood ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To him the wit of Greece and Rome was known,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">And every author’s merit but his own.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We muſt allow of Roſcommon, what Fenton has not mentioned ſo diſtinctly as he ought, and, what is&nbsp;yet very much to his honour, that he is perhaps the&nbsp;only correct writer in verſe before Addiſon ; and that,&nbsp;if there are not ſo many or ſo great beauties in his com-poſitions as in thoſe of ſome contemporaries, there are&nbsp;at leaſt fewer faults. Nor is this his higheſt praiſe ; for&nbsp;Pope has celebrated him as the only moral writer of&nbsp;King Charles’s reign :</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Unhappy Dryden ! in all Charles’s days,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Roſcommon only boaſts uaſpotted lays.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Of Roſcommon’s woιks, the judgment of the public ſeems to be right. He is elegant, but not great ; he&nbsp;never labours after exquiſite beauties, and he ſeldom&nbsp;falls into groſs faults. Hrs verſi cation is ſmooth, but&nbsp;rarely vigorous, and his rhymes are remarkably exact.&nbsp;He improved taſte, if he did not enlarge knowledge,&nbsp;and may be numbered among the benefactors to Engliſh literature.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">Rose</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;"> oſ Jericho,</span><span class="font0"> ſo called becauſe it grows in the plain of Jericho, though it did not originally grow&nbsp;there. It has perhaps been ſo named by travelers who&nbsp;did not know that it was brought from Arabia Petræa.&nbsp;Roſe buſhes are frequently found in the fields about&nbsp;Jericho; but they are of a ſpecies much inferior to thoſe&nbsp;ſo much extolled in Scripture, the flowers of which&nbsp;ſome naturaliſts pretend to have in their cabinets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ The roſe ſhrub of Jericho (ſays Mariti) is a ſmall<sup>, </sup>plant, with a buſhy root, about an inch and a half in'&nbsp;length. It has a number of Items which diverge from'&nbsp;the earth : they are covered with few leaves ; but it is&nbsp;loaded with flowers, which appear red when in bud,&nbsp;turn paler as they expand, and at length become white&nbsp;entirely. Theſe flowers appear to me to have a great&nbsp;reſemblaace to thoſe of the elder-tree ; with this difference, that they are entirely deſtitute of ſmell. The&nbsp;ſtems never riſe more than four or five inches from the&nbsp;ground. This ſhrub ſheds its leaves and its flowers as it&nbsp;withers. Its branches then bend in the middle, and&nbsp;becoming entwined with each other to the top, form a&nbsp;kind of globe. This happens during the great heats ;&nbsp;but during moiſt and rainy weather they again open&nbsp;and expand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ In this country of ignorance and ſuperſtſtſhn, people do not judge with a philoſophical eye of the alternate ſhutting and opening of this plant : it appears&nbsp;to them to be a periodical miracle, which heaven operates in order to make known the events of this world.&nbsp;The inhabitants of the neighbouring cantons come and&nbsp;examine theſe ſhrubs when they are about to undertake a journey, to form an alliance, to conclude any&nbsp;affair of importance, or on the birth of a ſon. If the&nbsp;ſtems of the plants are open, they do not doubt of fuc-ceſs ; but they account it a bad omen to ſee them ſhut,&nbsp;and therefore renounce their project if it be not too&nbsp;late.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ This plant is neither ſubject to rot nor to wither. It will bear to be tranſplanted ; and thrives without degenerating in any kind of ſoil whatever.”</span></p>
