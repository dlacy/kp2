<p><span class="font0">de Roussillon, Engelier the Gascon, Ivon and Ivoire, and the flower of the Frankish army. They had nearly reached the&nbsp;summit of the pass when Oliver, who had mounted a high rock,&nbsp;saw the advancing army of the Saracens, 400,000 strong. In&nbsp;vain Oliver begged Roland to sound his horn and summon&nbsp;Charlemagne to his aid. A description of the hattle, a series&nbsp;of single combats, follows. Oliver, with his sword Hauteclêre,&nbsp;rivalled Roland with Durendal. After the first fight, a second&nbsp;division of the pagan army appears, then a third. Roland’s&nbsp;army was reduced to sixty men before he consented to sound&nbsp;his horn. Presently all were slain but Roland and Oliver,&nbsp;Turpin and another. Finally, when the Saracens, warned of&nbsp;the return of Charlemagne, had retreated, Roland alone survived on the field of battle. With a last effort he blew his&nbsp;horn once more, and heard before he died the sound of Charlemagne’s battlecry of “ Montjoie.” Charlemagne pursued the&nbsp;enemy, and destroyed their army. The raising of a second&nbsp;army by Baligant, the emir of Babylon, and its defeat by the&nbsp;emperor, who slays Baligant in single combat, is obviously an&nbsp;interpolation in the original narrative. The trouvère then&nbsp;relates the return of the Franks, the burial of the heroes of&nbsp;Roncevaux, and, at great length, the trial of Ganelon at Aix,&nbsp;his execution, and that of his thirty kinsmen, and the death of&nbsp;Alde, Roland’s betrothed and Oliver’s sister, when she heard&nbsp;the news of Roland’s death. The trial of Ganelon is one of&nbsp;the most curious parts of the story, providing, as it does, a full&nbsp;account of the Frankish criminal procedure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Relations between the Earlier Forms of the Legend.—</span><span class="font0">The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pseudo-Tnrpin</span><span class="font0"> represents a different recension of the story, and is throughout clerical in tone. It was the trouvère of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chanson&nbsp;de Roland</span><span class="font0"> who developed the characters into epic types; he&nbsp;invented the heroic friendship of Roland and Oliver, the motives&nbsp;of Ganelon’s treachery, and many other details. The famous&nbsp;fight between Roland and the giant Ferragus appears in the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pseudo-Turpin</span><span class="font0"> (chapter xviii.), but not in the poem. The&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chanson de Roland</span><span class="font0"> presupposes the existence of a whole cycle&nbsp;of epic poetry, probably in episodic form; it contains allusions&nbsp;to many events outside the narrative, some of which can be&nbsp;explained from other existing chansons, while others refer to&nbsp;narratives which are lost. In lines 590-603 of the poem Roland&nbsp;gives a list of the countries he has conquered for Charles, from&nbsp;Constantinople and Hungary on the east to Scotland on the&nbsp;west. Of most of these exploits no trace remains in extant&nbsp;poems, but his capture of Bordeaux, of Nobles, of Carcassonne,&nbsp;occur in various compilations. Roland was variously represented by the romancers as the son of Charlemagne’s sister&nbsp;Gilles or Berte and the knight Milon d’Anglers. The romantic&nbsp;episode of the reconciliation of the pair with Charlemagne&nbsp;through Roland’s childish prattle </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">{Berte et Milon)</span><span class="font0"> is probably&nbsp;foreign to the original legend. In the Scandinavian versions&nbsp;Roland is the son of Charlemagne and his sister, a recital probably borrowed from mythology. His </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">enfances,</span><span class="font0"> or youthful&nbsp;exploits, were, according to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Aspremont,</span><span class="font0"> performed in Italy&nbsp;against the giant Eaumont, but in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Girais de Viane</span><span class="font0"> his first taste&nbsp;of battle is under the walls of Vienne, where Oliver, at first his&nbsp;adversary, becomes his brother-in-arms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Other Versions.—</span><span class="font0">Most closely allied to the Oxford </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Roland</span><span class="font0"> are (a) a version in Italianized French preserved in a 13th or 14th century&nbsp;MS. in the library of St Mark, Venice (MS. Fr. iv.) ; (δ) the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ruolantes&nbsp;Liet</span><span class="font0"> (ed. W. Grimm, Göttingen, 1838) of the Swabian priest Konrad&nbsp;(fl. 1130), who gave, however, a pious tone to the whole;@@<sup>1</sup>, (c) the&nbsp;8th branch of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Karlamagnussaga</span><span class="font0"> (ed. C. Unger, Christiania,&nbsp;i860), and the Danish version of that compilation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the 12th century the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chanson de Roland</span><span class="font0"> was modernized by replacing the assonance by rhyme, and by amplifications and&nbsp;additions. Several MSS. of this rhymed recension, sometimes&nbsp;known as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Roncevaux,</span><span class="font0"> are preserved. In the prose compilations of&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Galien</span><span class="font0"> and in David Aubert’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Conquîtes de Charlemagne</span><span class="font0"> (1158) the&nbsp;story kept its popularity for many centuries. In England tne story&nbsp;was understood in the original French, and the English romances&nbsp;of Charlemagne </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.)</span><span class="font0"> are mostly derived from late and inferior&nbsp;sources. In Spain the legend underwent a curious transformation.&nbsp;Spanish patriotism created a Spanish ally of Marsile, Bernard del&nbsp;Carpio, to be the rival and victor of Roland. It was in Italy that&nbsp;the Roland legend had its greatest fortune : Charlemagne and Roland&nbsp;appear in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Paradiso</span><span class="font0"> (canto xviii.) of Dante ; the statues of Roland&nbsp;and Oliver appear on the doorway of the cathedral of Verona;&nbsp;and. the French </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">chansons de geste</span><span class="font0"> regularly appeared in a corrupt&nbsp;Italianized French. The Roland legend passed through a succession&nbsp;of revisions, and, as the. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Spagna,</span><span class="font0"> forming the 8th book of the great&nbsp;compilation of Carolingian romance, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Reali di Francia,</span><span class="font0"> kept its&nbsp;popularity down to the Renaissance. The story of Roland (Orlando)&nbsp;in a greatly modified form is the subject of the poems of Luigi Pulci&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Morgante Maggiore,</span><span class="font0"> 1481), of Matteo Boiardo </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Orlando innamorato,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">i486), of Ariosto </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Orlando furioso,</span><span class="font0"> 1516), and of Francesco Berni&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Orlando,</span><span class="font0"> 1541).</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@1</sup> A proof of the popularity of the legend in Germany is supplied by the so-called Roland statues, of which perhaps the most famous&nbsp;example is that of Bremen. Mention of a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">statua Rolandi</span><span class="font0"> is made in&nbsp;a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Privilegium</span><span class="font0"> granted by Henry V. to the town of Bremen in 1111.&nbsp;The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rolandssäule</span><span class="font0"> were probably symbolic of. the judicial rights&nbsp;possessed by the towns where they are found, and it has been suggested&nbsp;that the word arises from false etymology with </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rothlandsaide,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">red-land-pillar, the symbol of the possession of the power of life&nbsp;and death.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>

<p><span class="font0">ROLANDSECK, a village of Germany, in the Prussian Rhine province, delightfully situated on the left bank of the Rhine,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">8 m. above Bonn, with a station on the railway Cologne-Coblenz. The place consists almost entirely of villas and is a favourite&nbsp;summer resort. Crowning the vine-clad hills behind it lie the&nbsp;ruins of the castle, a picturesque ivy-covered arch, whence a&nbsp;fine view is obtained of the Siebengebirge and the Rhine valley&nbsp;as far as Bonn. Immediately below RoIandseck in mid-river&nbsp;is the island of Nonnenwerth, on which is a nursing school&nbsp;under the conduct of Franciscan nuns, established in 1850. The&nbsp;convent which formerly stood here was founded in 1122 and&nbsp;secularized in 1802. Tradition assigns the foundation of the&nbsp;castle of Rolandseck to Charlemagne’s paladin, Roland. It&nbsp;was certainly built at a very early date, as it was restored by&nbsp;Frederick, archbishop of Cologne, in 1120, and it was a fortress&nbsp;until the end of the 15th century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROLL, ALFRED PHILIPPE (1846- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;), French painter,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">was born in Paris on the ist of March 1846. Pupil of Gerome and Bonnat at the École des Beaux Arts, he made his&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">début</span><span class="font0"> at the Salon in 1870 with “ Environs of Baccarat ” and&nbsp;“ Evening,” and attracted the widest attention in 1875 by&nbsp;his colossal painting of “ The Flood at Toulouse ” (now at&nbsp;the Havre Museum). All his early work is imbued with the&nbsp;spirit of romanticism under the influence of Géricault, whilst&nbsp;his colour tended to Bolognese heaviness with a strong leaning&nbsp;towards dark shadows in the flesh painting, in which he closely&nbsp;followed Courbet. In 1877 he showed at the Salon the “ Fête&nbsp;of Silenus ” (now at the Ghent Museum), a painting of such&nbsp;vivid colour-and exuberant life that it recalls the work of&nbsp;Jordaens. About this time he began to devote himself to the&nbsp;realistic rendering of modern life, especially among the working&nbsp;classes, and together with romantic subjects he abandoned&nbsp;his earlier heavy colouring, and devoted himself to the study&nbsp;of free light. His “ Miners’ Strike ” of 1880 (now at the Valenciennes Museum) placed him in the front rank of modern French&nbsp;painters, and from that date his career was one of continuous&nbsp;and brilliant success.
