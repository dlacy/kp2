<p><span class="font0">CHAPTER I.—THE REGAL PERIOD.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">C ontributomes to People, Customs, and Law.—</span><span class="font0">The union of the Latin, Sabine, and, to a small extent, Etruscan&nbsp;bands that, as conquerors or conquered, old settlers or new&nbsp;immigrants, together constituted the first elements of the&nbsp;Roman people, did not necessarily involve contemporaneous&nbsp;adoption of identical institutions or identical notions of&nbsp;law. Although they were descended from the same Indo-European stock, and inherited the same primitive ideas&nbsp;about religion and government, those ideas must have&nbsp;been modified in the course of centuries of separate and&nbsp;independent development. The characteristics of the Latin&nbsp;race are said to have been its sense of the importance of&nbsp;discipline and the homage it paid to power and might;&nbsp;those of the Sabines were their religious feeling and their&nbsp;reverence for the gods ; the characteristic of the Etruscans&nbsp;was their subservience to forms and ceremonies in matters&nbsp;both divine and human. Corresponding influences are&nbsp;very manifest in the growth of Rome’s early public institutions, civil, military, and religious. It does not seem too&nbsp;much to say that these same influences are traceable also&nbsp;in the institutions of the private law. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">pαtma potestas,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">with the father’s power of life and death over his children ;&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">manus</span><span class="font0"> and the husband’s power over his wife; the&nbsp;doctrine that those things chiefly was a man entitled to&nbsp;call his own which he had taken by the strength of his&nbsp;arm ; the right which a creditor had of apprehending and&nbsp;imprisoning his defaulting debtor and reducing him to&nbsp;slavery,—all these seem to point to a persuasion that&nbsp;might made right. The religious marriage ceremony and&nbsp;the recognition of the wife as mistress of the household&nbsp;and participant in its sacred offices as well as its domestic&nbsp;cares ; the family council of kinsmen, maternal as well as&nbsp;paternal, who advised the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">2xRerfαmiliαs</span><span class="font0"> in the exercise of&nbsp;the domestic jurisdiction ; the practice of adoption, to&nbsp;obviate the extinction of a family and to prevent its deceased members being deprived of the prayers and sacrifices necessary for the repose of their souls,—these seem&nbsp;to have flowed from a different order of ideas and to bear&nbsp;evidence of Sabine descent. Etruscan influence could&nbsp;make itself felt only at a later date; but to it may possibly be attributed the strict regard that came to be&nbsp;required to the observance of ceremonials and words of&nbsp;style in the more important transactions both of public&nbsp;and private life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">While it can hardly be doubted that the result of the union of Latins and Sabines was that regulations were at&nbsp;once adopted which should apply to their public life as a&nbsp;united people, it is not only conceivable but probable that&nbsp;each tribe, as regarded the private relations of its members,&nbsp;continued for a time to accord a preference to its own&nbsp;ideas and traditions of right and law, and that the amalgamation was a gradual process, partly silent, partly due&nbsp;to regal or pontifical intervention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Patricians, Clients, and Plebeians.—</span><span class="font0">There was part of the law of Rome that even in the empire was known by&nbsp;the name of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Jus Quimtium,</span><span class="font0"> the Law of the Spearmen ; and&nbsp;this in the regal period constituted its main element.&nbsp;The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Quirites</span><span class="font0"> were the members of the gentile houses,&nbsp;organized in their curies, primarily for military and&nbsp;secondarily for political purposes. They alone of the&nbsp;rapidly increasing population settled round the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">urbs guad-rata</span><span class="font0"> ranked as citizens, down at least to the time of&nbsp;Servius Tullius. They alone could consult the gods&nbsp;through the medium of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">auspicia,</span><span class="font0"> and participate in the&nbsp;services offered to the tutelary deities of Rome. From&nbsp;their number the king drew his council of elders, and&nbsp;they alone could take part in the curiate comitia, the&nbsp;assembly of the warriors. They alone could contract a&nbsp;lawful marriage and make a testament ; in a word, it was&nbsp;they alone that were entitled directly to the benefit of&nbsp;Rome’s peculiar institutions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">These prerogatives they enjoyed as members of the gentile houses. Patrician Rome was a federation of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">g entes&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">or clans, the clans aggregations of families bearing a&nbsp;common name, and theoretically at least tracing their&nbsp;descent from a common ancestor. Whether or not the&nbsp;traditional account of the numerical proportion of families&nbsp;to clans and of clans to curies has any substantial historical&nbsp;foundation, and whatever may be the explanation of the&nbsp;method by which the symmetry on which the old writers&nbsp;dwell with so much complacency was attained, it is beyond&nbsp;doubt that the gentile organization was common to the&nbsp;two races at least that contributed most largely to the&nbsp;citizenship of Rome, and that it was made the basis of the&nbsp;new arrangements. Federation necessitated the appointment of a common chieftain and common institutions,&nbsp;religious, military, political, and judicial. But it was long&nbsp;before these displaced entirely the separate institutions of&nbsp;the federated </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">gentes.</span><span class="font0"> Every clan had its own cult, peculiar&nbsp;to its own members ; this was the universal bond of&nbsp;association in those early times. It had its common property and its common burial-place. It must have had&nbsp;some common council or assembly, for we read not only&nbsp;of special gentile customs but of gentile statutes and&nbsp;decrees. Instances are on record of wars waged by individual </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">gentes</span><span class="font0"> ; so they must have had the right to require&nbsp;military service alike from their </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">gentiles</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">gentilicii.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">Widows and orphans of deceased clansmen were under the&nbsp;guardianship of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">gens,</span><span class="font0"> or of some particular member&nbsp;of it to whom the trust was specially confided. If a clansman left no heirs, his property passed to his fellow gentiles.&nbsp;Over the morals of its members the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">gens</span><span class="font0"> exercised supervision and discipline, interfering to prevent prodigality&nbsp;and improvidence, restraining abuses of the domestic&nbsp;authority, and visiting with censure and probably in grave&nbsp;cases with punishment any breach of faith or other dishonourable conduct ; and it is difficult to suppose that,&nbsp;within its own limits, it was not constantly called upon,&nbsp;through the medium of its chief, to act the part of peacemaker and arbiter. Finally, its members were always&nbsp;entitled to rely upon its assistance, to have maintenance&nbsp;when indigent, to be ransomed from captivity, to be upheld&nbsp;in their just disputes and quarrels, and to be avenged&nbsp;when killed or injured.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The successes of the burgesses in one petty war after another deprived many small communities of their independent existence, leaving their members bereft alike of&nbsp;their religion, their territory, and their means of subsistence. These had to turn elsewhere for protection, and in&nbsp;large numbers they sought it from their conquerors. To&nbsp;many others, both voluntary immigrants and refugees from&nbsp;other cities, the new settlement proved a centre of attraction. It was quite ready to receive them, but as subjects&nbsp;only, not as citizens. Following a custom familiar to both&nbsp;Latins and Sabines, the new-comers invoked the protection&nbsp;of the heads of patrician families of repute, to whom they&nbsp;attached themselves as free vassals. The relationship was&nbsp;known as that of patron and client. (See Patron and&nbsp;Client, vol. xviii. p. 412.) The client became a dependent&nbsp;member of his patron’s clan,—not </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">gentilis,</span><span class="font0"> however, but&nbsp;only </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">gentilicius.</span><span class="font0"> His patron had to provide him with all&nbsp;that was necessary for his sustenance and that of his wife</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
