<p><span class="font2">lines of a series diminishes with the atomic weight, and is proportional to its square. These relations suggest that the atomic weight might here act in part after the manner of a load attached&nbsp;to a fundamental vibrating system, which might conceivably&nbsp;be formed on the same plan for all the metals of the group;&nbsp;such a load would depress all the periods, and at the same time&nbsp;it would split them up in the manner above described, if it&nbsp;introduced dissymmetry into the vibrator. The discovery of&nbsp;Zeeman that a magnetic field triples each spectral line, and&nbsp;produces definite polarizations of the three components, in&nbsp;many cases further subdividing each component into lines&nbsp;placed usually all at equal intervals of frequency, is explained,&nbsp;and was in part predicted, by Lorentz on the basis of the electron&nbsp;theory, which finds the origin of radiation in a system of unitary&nbsp;electric charges describing orbits or executing vibrations in the&nbsp;molecule. Although these facts form substantial sign-posts,&nbsp;it has not yet been found possible to assign any likely structure&nbsp;to a vibrating system which would lead to a frequency formula&nbsp;for its free periods of the types given above. Indeed, the view&nbsp;is open that the group of lines constituting a series form a&nbsp;harmonic analysis of a single fundamental vibration not itself&nbsp;harmonic. If that be so, the intensities and other properties&nbsp;of the lines of a series ought all to vary together; it has in&nbsp;fact been found by Preston, and more fully verified by Runge&nbsp;and others, that the lines are multiplied into the same number&nbsp;of constituents in a magnetic field, with intervals in frequency&nbsp;that are the same for all of them. When the scries consists of&nbsp;double or triple lines the separate components of the same&nbsp;compound line are not affected similarly, which shows that&nbsp;they are differently constituted. The view has also found&nbsp;support that the different behaviours of the various groups of&nbsp;lines in a spectrum show that they belong to independent&nbsp;vibrators. The form of the vibration sent out from a molecule&nbsp;into the aether depends on the form of the aggregate hodograph&nbsp;of the electronic orbits, which is in keeping with Rayleigh’s&nbsp;remark that the series-laws suggest the kinematic relations of&nbsp;revolving bodies rather than the vibrations of steady dynamical&nbsp;systems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">According to Rydberg, there is ground for the view that a natural group of chemical elements have all the same type of&nbsp;series spectrum, and that the various constants associated with&nbsp;this spectrum change rapidly in the same directions in passing&nbsp;from the elements of one group to the corresponding ones of&nbsp;the following groups, after the manner illustrated in graphical&nbsp;representations of Mendeléeff’s law by means of a continuous&nbsp;wavy curve in which each group of elements lies along this&nbsp;same ascending or descending branch; the chemical elements&nbsp;thus being built up in a series of types or groups, so that the&nbsp;individuals in successive groups correspond one to one in a&nbsp;regular progression, which may be put in evidence by connecting them by transverse curves. Illustrations have been&nbsp;worked out mathematically by J. J. Thomson of the effect of&nbsp;adding successive outer rings of electrons to stable vibrating&nbsp;collocations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The frequencies of the series of very close lines which constitute a single band in a banded spectrum are connected by a law of quite different type, namely, in the simpler cases </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">n</span><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> =&nbsp;A-B</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">m</span><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup>. It may be remarked that this is the kind of relation&nbsp;that would apply to a row of independent similar vibrators in&nbsp;which the neighbours exert slight mutual influence of elastic&nbsp;type.

<p><span class="font2">the type above stated. Dynamical systems of this kind are illustrated by the Lagrangean linear system of connected bodies,&nbsp;such as, for example, a row of masses fixed along a tense cord,&nbsp;and each subject to a restoring elastic force of its own in addition&nbsp;to the tension of the cord. A single spectral line might thus&nbsp;be transformed into a band of this type, as the effect of disturbance arising from slight elastic connexions established in&nbsp;the molecule between a system of similar vibrators.

<p><span class="font2">RADICAL (Lat. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">radix,</span><span class="font2"> a root), in English politics, a term applied to politicians who desire to make </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">thorough,</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">radical,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">changes in the constitution and in the social order generally.&nbsp;Although it had been used in a somewhat similar way during&nbsp;the reign of Charles II., the term Radical, in its political sense,&nbsp;originated about the end of the 18th century, probably owing&nbsp;its existence to Charles James Fox, who, in 1797, declared&nbsp;that “ radical reform ” was necessary. The ideas of the first&nbsp;Radicals were borrowed largely from the authors of the French&nbsp;Revolution. The word was more generally employed during&nbsp;the disturbed period between the close of the Napoleonic wars&nbsp;and the passing of the great Reform Bill of 1832, and was&nbsp;applied to agitators like Henry Hunt and William Cobbett.&nbsp;After the Reform Bill had become law, the advocates of violent&nbsp;change were drawn into the Chartist movement, and the&nbsp;Radicals became less revolutionary both in speech and object.&nbsp;Thus in 1842 an observer writes: —“ The term Radical, once&nbsp;employed as a name of low reproach, has found its way into&nbsp;high places, and is gone forth as the title of a class who glory&nbsp;in their designation. ’’ About this time many members of&nbsp;Parliament were known as Radicals, among these men being&nbsp;George Grote and Joseph Hume. The Radicals never formed&nbsp;a distinct party in the House of Commons, and subsequently&nbsp;they formed simply the advanced section of the Liberal party.&nbsp;For a few years in the 19th century the wearing of a white hat&nbsp;was looked upon as the distinguishing mark of a Radical, a&nbsp;hat of this colour having been worn by Hunt when addressing&nbsp;meetings.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">RADIOACTIVITY. The subject of radioactivity deals with phenomena exhibited by a special class of bodies of high atomic&nbsp;weight of which uranium, thorium, radium and actinium are the&nbsp;best known examples. These substances possess the property&nbsp;of spontaneously emitting radiations of a special character&nbsp;which are able to penetrate through matter opaque to ordinary&nbsp;light. The beginning of this subject dates from 1896, and&nbsp;was an indirect consequence of the discovery of the X rays&nbsp;made a few months before by Röntgen. It was known that&nbsp;the production of X rays in a vacuum tube was accompanied&nbsp;by a strong phosphorescence of the glass, and it occurred to&nbsp;several investigators that ordinary substances made phos-phorescent by visible light might emit a penetrating radiation&nbsp;similar to X rays. Following out this idea, H. Becquerel (1), @@<sup>l&nbsp;</sup>a distinguished French physicist, exposed amongst other&nbsp;substances a phosphorescent compound of uranium, uranium-</span></p>
