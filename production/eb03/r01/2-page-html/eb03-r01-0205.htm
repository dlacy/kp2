<p><span class="font0">the Auſtrſans, whom he repulſed.<sup>1</sup> Hearing, however, of tile defeat of Dillon, he retreated. A third parry&nbsp;advanced to Furnes, but afterwards withdrew. La&nbsp;Fayette at the fame time advanced towards Bouvines,&nbsp;half way to Namur, from which he afterwards retreated.&nbsp;The whole of theſe expeditions were ill contrived, in as&nbsp;much as they divided the French undiſciplined troops,&nbsp;and expoſed them in ſmall bodies to the attack of veteran forces. The Auſtrians were ſome time before&nbsp;they attempted to retaliate. At length, however, on&nbsp;the iith of June, they attacked M. Gouvion, who&nbsp;commanded the advanced guard of La Fayette’s army&nbsp;near Maubeuge. M. Gouvion was killed by a rolling&nbsp;bullet ; but La Fayette himſelf having come up, the&nbsp;Auſtrians abandoned the field. In the mean time, matters were haſtening in Paris towards a violent criſis.&nbsp;Two parties, both of which were hoſtile to the preſent&nbsp;conſtitution, had gradually been formed in the ſtate.&nbsp;The one wiſhed to give more effectual fupport to the&nbsp;royal authority, by eſtabliſhing a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">finale</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">two chambers,</span><span class="font0"> to prevent the king’s vote from being the ſole&nbsp;check upon popular enthuſiaſm. The other party wiſh-ed to ſet aſide royalty altogether, and to hazard the&nbsp;bold experiment of converting France into a republic.&nbsp;Theſe laſt were ſupported by the Jacobin club, which&nbsp;had now contrived to concentrate in itſelf an immenſe&nbsp;maſs of influence. Innumerable popular ſocieties were&nbsp;eſtabliſhed in every town and village throughout the&nbsp;provinces, with theſe a regular correſpondence was&nbsp;kept up by writing and by emiſſaries. Thus ſchemes&nbsp;and notions were inſtantaneouſly propagated through a&nbsp;great empire, and all the violent ſpirits which it con-tained were enabled to act in concert : Eut the more&nbsp;immediate engine of the republican party conſiſted of&nbsp;the immenſe population of the metropolis, whom they&nbsp;now endeavoured to keep in conſtant alarm. For this&nbsp;pnrpoſe they alleged, that an </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Auſtrian Committee,</span><span class="font0"> that is&nbsp;to fay, a confpiracy in favour of the enemies of the coun-try, exiſted among the friends of the court. Μ. M.&nbsp;Genfonné and Briſſot even offered in the aſſembly to&nbsp;prove the exiſtence of this pretended Auſtrian committee. À report was next circulated, that the king&nbsp;intended to abſeond from the capital on the 23d of&nbsp;May. Fiis majeſty publicly contradicted theſe accuſa-tions as calumnies, but they made no ſmall impreffion&nbsp;upon the minds of the public. New decrees were now&nbsp;made againſt the refractory clergy, but theſe his majeſty&nbsp;reſuſed to ſanction. A propoſal was alſo made and decreed in the aſſembly to form a camp of 20,000. men&nbsp;under the walls of Paris, and that for this levy every&nbsp;canton in thc kingdom ſhould contribute one horſeman&nbsp;and four infantry. The national guard of Paiis diſ-liked the propoſal, and the king gave to it his negative.&nbsp;Indeed at this time the king ſeems to have come to a&nbsp;reſolution oſ ſtanding out againſt the Jacobin party, to&nbsp;which he had ſor ſome time yieldedt The miniſtry&nbsp;were therefore diſmiſſed, excepting M. Dumourier, and&nbsp;others were appointed in their ſtead. By this event&nbsp;Dumourier loſt die confidence of the Jacobin club. Hé&nbsp;ſaw his error, reſigned his office, and joined the army!&nbsp;In the mean time a decree had been paſſed, authoriſing&nbsp;tb.e manufactory of pikes for the purpoſe of arming&nbsp;cheaply the lower claſs of citizens. Ail means were&nbsp;uſcd to render^the king odious by inflammatory .wri-</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">tings and harangues ; </span><span class="font0">and </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">in both of theſe the noted </span><span class="font0">incendiary Marat took the lead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On the 20th of June M. Roederer, the Procureur Ge- _ neral Syndic informed the national aſſembly, that, con-trary to law, formidable bodies of armed men were preparing to preſent petitions to the king, and to the national aſſembly. A part of them ſpeedily appeared&nbsp;with St Huruge and Santerre a brewer at their head.&nbsp;They marched through the hall in a proceffion that&nbsp;laſted two hours, at four o’clock in the afternoon, to&nbsp;the number of about 40,000. They ſurrounded the&nbsp;Thuilleries. The gates were thrown open; and on an&nbsp;attempt to break the door of the apartment, where the&nbsp;king then was, he ordered them to be admitted. His&nbsp;filler the princefs Elizabeth never departed from his&nbsp;ſide during four or ſive hours that he was ſurrounded&nbsp;by the multitude, and compelled to liſten to every ini&nbsp;dignity. Ali this while Petion, the mayor of Paris,&nbsp;was unaccountably abſent. He at length, however,&nbsp;arrived, and alſo a deputation from the aſſembly. The&nbsp;queen, with her children and the princeſs de Lamballe,&nbsp;were in the mean time in the council-chamber, where,&nbsp;though protected from violence, they were yet expoſed&nbsp;to much infult. At laſt, in conſequence of the approach&nbsp;of evening, and of the entreaties of Petion, the multitude gradually diſperſed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The indignities ſuſſered on this day by the royal ſa-mily were in ſome reſpects not unfavourable to their cauſe. A great number of the moſt reſpectable inhabitants of the capital were aſhamed of fuch proceedings.&nbsp;They complained of them ſeverely in a petition to the&nbsp;aſſembly, and addreſſes to the ſame purpoſe were re-ceived from ſeveral departments. The directory of the&nbsp;department of Paris, at the head of which were M;.&nbsp;Rochefaucault and M. Tulleyrand, publiſhed a declaration diſapproving· of the conduct of the mayor, and of&nbsp;M. Manuel the procureur of the commune, whom they.&nbsp;afterwards ſuſpended from their offices, although they&nbsp;were ſpeedily reſtored by a decree of the aſſembly. At&nbsp;the ſame time, La Fayette leaving his army fuddenly,&nbsp;appeared on the 26th at the bar of the national aſſembly. Iffe declared that he came to exprefs the indignation which the whole army felt on account of the&nbsp;events of the 20th : he called upon the aſſembly to pu-niſh the promoters of theſe events, and to diſſolve the&nbsp;factious clubs. The ſudden appearance of La Fayette&nbsp;threw the Jacobins into conſternation, and from that&nbsp;period they never ceaſed to calumniate him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On the iſt of July, on the motion of M. Jean de Brie, tlie aſſembly ordered'a proclamation to be made,&nbsp;that </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">the country was in danger.</span><span class="font0"> On the 6th, the king&nbsp;gave intimation that the king of Pruffia was marching&nbsp;with 52,000 men to co-operate againſt France. The&nbsp;French arms were at this time fomewhat ſuccefsful in&nbsp;the Auſtrian Netherlands ; but the cabinet ſpeedily&nbsp;thought it neceſſary to order the armies to retreat : a&nbsp;meaſure which was. afterwards ■ publicly cenfured by&nbsp;Marſhall Luckner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On the 7th, a lingular, ſcene occurred in the nation-al aſſembly. At the inſtant that M. Briſſot was about to commence an oration, M.
