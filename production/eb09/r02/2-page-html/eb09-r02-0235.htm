<p><span class="font0">and the practice of every now and then drafting the younger members of families to colonies diminished the number of those who had a claim to participate. But the simplest plan of avoiding the&nbsp;difficulty was for the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias</span><span class="font0"> to regulate his succession by&nbsp;testament ; and there can be little doubt that originally such a&nbsp;deed was had recourse to, not so much for instituting a stranger&nbsp;heir when a man had no issue—according to patrician notions his&nbsp;duty then was to perpetuate his family by adopting a son—as for&nbsp;partitioning the succession when he had more children than one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There were two sorts of testaments made use of by the patricians of the regal period,—that made in the comitia&nbsp;of the curies </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{test. calatis comitiis)</span><span class="font1"> and that made in the&nbsp;presence of a few comrades on the eve of battle </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{test, in&nbsp;prociηctu faxtunι).</span><span class="font1"> The first at least—and the second was&nbsp;just a substitute for it on an emergency—was far from&nbsp;being an independent exercise of the testator’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">voluntas.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">For, though in course of time, and under the sanction of&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">uti legassit ita jus esto</span><span class="font1"> of the XII. Tables, the curies&nbsp;may have become merely the recipients of the oral declaration by the testator of his last will, in order that they&nbsp;might testify to it after his death, it is impossible not to&nbsp;see in the comitial testament what must originally have&nbsp;been a legislative act, whereby the testator’s peers, for&nbsp;reasons which they and the presiding pontiffs thought&nbsp;sufficient, sanctioned in the particular case a departure&nbsp;from the ordinary rules of succession. The pontiffs were&nbsp;there to protect the interests of religion, and the curies to&nbsp;protect those of the testator’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gens</span><span class="font1"> ; and it is hardly conceivable that a testament could have been sanctioned by&nbsp;them which so far set at nought old traditions as to deprive&nbsp;a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">filiusfamilias</span><span class="font1"> of his birthright, at least in favour of a&nbsp;stranger.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Family, Property, and Succession amongst the Plebeians. </span><span class="font1">—If perfect identity of law and custom cannot be assumed&nbsp;to have existed amongst the patricians in the earliest&nbsp;years of Rome, far less can it be supposed to have existed&nbsp;amongst the heterogeneous population that constituted&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">plebs.</span><span class="font1"> A large proportion of them, it is true, were of&nbsp;Latin descent, to whom gentile institutions and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">manus&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">patria potestas</span><span class="font1"> of the family were nothing strange ;&nbsp;but alongside of them were other tribes that Rome had&nbsp;vanquished, who had very different traditions, and some&nbsp;of whom, as is thought by one or two writers of note,&nbsp;laid more store on female kinship than on that through&nbsp;males. From the moment that any of the former became&nbsp;part of the Roman </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">plebs</span><span class="font1"> everything like gentile organization was of course suppressed ; public policy could not suffer&nbsp;the continuance of what might have proved an element&nbsp;of danger to the state. The inevitable consequence was&nbsp;a disturbance of the whole family system. Having no&nbsp;longer any clansmen to stand by them in emergencies, to&nbsp;avenge their quarrels and deaths, and to act as guardians&nbsp;of their widows and orphans, the plebeians of Latin origin&nbsp;seem to have drawn closer in their ideas to their fellows&nbsp;of Etruscan and Hellenic descent, and to have transferred&nbsp;their regards to the circle of their relatives by blood and&nbsp;marriage </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{cognati et adfines).</span><span class="font1"> It is remarkable that, notwithstanding the pre-eminence given to agnates by the&nbsp;XII. Tables in matters of tutory and succession, the law&nbsp;reserved to the cognates, as distinguished from the agnates,&nbsp;certain rights and duties that in patrician Rome must have&nbsp;belonged to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gens,—</span><span class="font1">for example, the duty of prosecuting the murderer (originally of avenging the death) of&nbsp;a kinsman, and the right of appeal against a capital sentence pronounced upon a kinsman. This can only have&nbsp;been because in olden times, when agnation was unknown&nbsp;as distinct from the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gens,</span><span class="font1"> it was plebeian practice to entrust&nbsp;those rights and duties to the sobrinal circle of cognates.</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the discussions on the Canuleian law in the year 309</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">u.c. it suited the line of argument of patrician orators to decry plebeian unions as something not deserving of the&nbsp;name of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">nuptiae,</span><span class="font1"> and to stigmatize them as mere </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">matm-ηιonia,—</span><span class="font1">relations entered into between men and women&nbsp;for the sake of making the latter mothers, but involving&nbsp;none of those features that characterized patrician marriage.</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup> That there may have been laxity amongst many&nbsp;of the plebeians in their domestic relations is extremely&nbsp;probable. The ceremony of confarreation was denied to&nbsp;them, and coemption (as seems likely) was not yet invented, so that the only way of contracting a marriage&nbsp;that was open to them was simple interchange of consent,&nbsp;which was not legally creative of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">manus.</span><span class="font1"> Whether it was&nbsp;creative of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">patria potestas</span><span class="font1"> over the issue of the union may&nbsp;be doubted. Some of the plebeians may have been of&nbsp;opinion that it did create it and may </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">de facto</span><span class="font1"> have exercised the right it conferred, while others may have been&nbsp;indifferent as to whether it did or not ; but we may be&nbsp;very sure that the patricians denied its possibility, on&nbsp;the ground that it was a prerogative of Roman citizens,&nbsp;amongst whom the plebeians had no claim to rank.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The accounts of the early distributions of land amongst the plebeians are even more uncertain than those we have&nbsp;of its distribution amongst the patricians. They had undoubtedly become freeholders in large numbers before the&nbsp;Servian reforms. But they probably attained that position&nbsp;only by gradual stages. There are indications that their&nbsp;earliest grants from the kings in their character of royal&nbsp;clients (as Cicero calls them) were only during pleasure ;&nbsp;but latterly, as they increased in numbers and importance,&nbsp;they obtained concessions of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">heredia</span><span class="font1"> varying in extent from&nbsp;two to seven jugers. That those who had the means also&nbsp;frequently acquired land by purchase from the state may&nbsp;be taken for granted. In fact there is good reason to&nbsp;believe that by the time of Servius the plebeians were as&nbsp;free to hold land in private property as the patricians,&nbsp;although the stages by which they reached equality in&nbsp;this respect are uncertain and difficult to follow. As for&nbsp;movable property their rights in it were presumably the&nbsp;same as those of the patricians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As regards the law of succession it may safely be assumed that by custom at all events the children of a plebeian usually took his estate on his death. But, as he was not a&nbsp;member of a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gens,</span><span class="font1"> there was no provision for the devolution of his succession on failure of children. The want of&nbsp;them he could not supply by adrogation, as he had for&nbsp;long no access to the assembly of the curies ; and it is very&nbsp;doubtful if adoption of a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">filiusfamilias</span><span class="font1"> was known before&nbsp;the reforms of Servius Tullius. The same cause that disqualified him for adrogating a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias</span><span class="font1"> disqualified&nbsp;him for making a testament </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">calatis comitiis</span><span class="font1"> ; and even one&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">in procinctu</span><span class="font1"> was impossible, since, although before the&nbsp;time of Servius plebeians may occasionally have served&nbsp;in the army, they were not citizens, and so had not the&nbsp;requisite capacity for making a testament. Until therefore the XII. Tables introduced the succession of agnates a&nbsp;plebeian unsurvived by children was necessarily heirless,—&nbsp;that is to say, heirless in law. But custom seems to have&nbsp;looked without disfavour on the appropriation of his&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">heredium</span><span class="font1"> by an outsider : a brother or other near kinsman&nbsp;would have the earliest opportunity, and, if he maintained&nbsp;his possession of it in the character of heir for a reasonable period, fixed by the XII. Tables at a year, the law&nbsp;dealt with him as heir, and in course of time the pontiffs&nbsp;imposed upon him the duty of maintaining the family </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sacra.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">This was the origin, and a very innocent and laudable one,</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
