<p><span class="font0">frequently ſigned by the letters F. R. C. which ſome among them interpret </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">fratres roris cοcti ;</span><span class="font0"> it being pretended, that the matter of the philoſophers Hone is&nbsp;dew concocted, exalted, &amp;c. Some, who are no&nbsp;friends to free-maſonry, make the preſent flouriſhing ſociety c*' .ree-mafons a branch of Roſicrucians ; or rather&nbsp;the Roſicrucians themſelves, under a new name or relation, viz. as retainers to building. And it is certain,&nbsp;there are ſome free-maſons who have all the characters&nbsp;of Roſicrucians ; but how the æra and original oſ ma-ſonry (ſee Masonry), and that of Roſicrucianiſm, here&nbsp;fixed from Naudæus, who has written expreſsly on the&nbsp;ſubject, conſiſt. we leave others to judge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Notwithſtanding the pretended antiquity oſ the Roſicrucians, it is probable that the alchemiſts, Paracelſiſts, or fire-philoſophers, who ſpread themſelves through al∙&nbsp;moſt all Europe about the cloſe of the iixteenth century, aſſumed about this period the obſcure and ambiguous title of Roſicrucian brethren, which commanded&nbsp;at firſt ſome degree of reſpect, as it ſeemed to be borrowed from the arms of Luther, which were a croſs&nbsp;placed upon a roſe. But the denomination evidently&nbsp;appears to be derived from the ſcience of chemiſtry. It&nbsp;is not compounded, ſays Moſheim, as many imagine, of&nbsp;the two words </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">roſa</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">crux,</span><span class="font0"> which ſignify roſe and&nbsp;croſs, but of the latter of theſe words, and the Latin&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rοs,</span><span class="font0"> which ſigniſies dew. Of all natural bodies, dew&nbsp;was deemed the moſt powerful diſſolvent of gold ; and&nbsp;the croſs, in the chemical language, is equivalent to&nbsp;light, becauſe the figure of a croſs -R exhibits, at the&nbsp;ſame time, the three letters of which the word ∕κx<sup>,</sup>, or&nbsp;iight, is compounded. Now </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">lux</span><span class="font0"> is called, by this ſect,&nbsp;the leed or menftruum of the red dragon, or, in other&nbsp;words, that groſs and corporeal light which, when properly digeſted and modified, produces gold. Hence it&nbsp;follows, if this etymology be admitted, that a Roſicrucian philoſopher is one who, by the intervention and aſ-ſiſtance of the dew, ſeeks for light, or, in other words,&nbsp;the ſubſtance called the philoſopher’s ſtone. The true&nbsp;meaning and energy of this denomination did not eſcape&nbsp;the penetration and ſagacity of Gaſſendi, as appears </span><span class="font1">by&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Examen Philoſophiai Fludclαηα,</span><span class="font0"> ſect. ιy. tom. iii. p.&nbsp;261. And it was more fully explained by Renaudot,&nbsp;in his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Conferences Publiques,</span><span class="font0"> tom. iv. p. 87.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">At the head of theſe fanatics were Robert Fludd, an Engliſh phyſician, Jacob Behmen, and Michael Mayer ;&nbsp;but if rumour may be credited, the preſent Illuminated&nbsp;have a head of higher rank. The common principles, which ſerve as a kind of centre of union to the&nbsp;Roſicrucian ſociety, are the following : They all maintain, that the diſſolution of bodies, by the power of&nbsp;fire, is the only way by which men can arrive at true&nbsp;wiſdom, and come to diſcern the firſt principles of&nbsp;things. They all acknowledge a certain analogy and&nbsp;harmony between the powers of nature and the doctrines of religion; and believe that the Deity governs&nbsp;the kingdom of grace by the ſame laws with which he&nbsp;rules the kingdom of nature ; and hence they are led to&nbsp;uſe chemical denominations to expreſs the truths of religion. They all hold, that there is a fort of divine energy, or foul, diffuſed through the frame of the uni-verſe, which ſome call the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">argheus,</span><span class="font0"> others the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">univerfal&nbsp;fpirit,</span><span class="font0"> and which others mention under different appellations. They all talk in the moſt ſuperſtitious manner&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font0">what they call the ſignatures </span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font0">things, </span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font0">the </span><span class="font1">power</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">ROSKILD, formerly the royal reſidence and metropolis of Denmark, ſtands at a ſmall diſtance front the Bay of Iſefiord, not far from Copenhagen. In its.&nbsp;flouriſhing ſtate it was of great extent, and comprifed∙&nbsp;within its walls 27 churches, and as many convents.—&nbsp;Its preſent circumference is ſearcely half an Engliſh&nbsp;mile, and it contains only about 1620 ſou.ls. The&nbsp;houſes are of brick, and of a neat appearance. The&nbsp;only remains of its original magnificence are the ruins&nbsp;of a palace and of the cathedral, a brick building with&nbsp;two ſpires, in which the kings of Denmark are interred»&nbsp;Little of the original building now remains. According to Holberg, it was conſtructed of wood, and afterwards built with ſtone, in the reign of Canute.—&nbsp;From an inſcription in the choir, it appears to have been&nbsp;founded by Harold V I. who is ſtyled king of Denmark,&nbsp;England, and Norway. Some verſes, in barbarous&nbsp;Latin, obſcurely allude to the principal incidents of&nbsp;his life ; adding, that he built this church, and died&nbsp;in 980.—See Coxe’s Travels into Poland, Ruſſia, Sweden, and Denmark, vol. ii. p. $25.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">ROSLIN, or Roskelvn, a place in the county of Mid Lothian in Scotland, remarkable for an ancient&nbsp;chapel and caille. The chapel was founded in 1446,&nbsp;by St Clare, prince of Orkney, for a provoſt, fix prebendaries, and two ſinging-boys. The outſide is ornamented with a multitude of pinnacles, and variety of&nbsp;ludicrous ſculptuie. The inſide is 69 feet long, the&nbsp;breadth 34, ſupported by two rows of cluſtered pillars, between ſeven and eight feet high, with an aiſle&nbsp;on each ſide. The arches are obtuſely Gothic. Theſe&nbsp;arches are continued acroſs the ſide-aiſles, but the centre&nbsp;of the church is one continued arch, elegantly divided&nbsp;into compartments, and finely ſculptured. The capitals&nbsp;of the pillars are enriched with foliage, and a variety&nbsp;of figures ; and amidſt a heavenly concert appears a cherubim blowing the ancient Highland bagpipes. The&nbsp;caille is ſeated on a peninſulated rock, in a deep glen&nbsp;far beneath, and acceſſible by a bridge of great height.&nbsp;This had been the ſeat of the great lamily of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sinclair.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">Of this houſe was Oliver, favourite of James </span><span class="font1">V. </span><span class="font0">and&nbsp;the innocent cauſe of the loſs of the battle of Solway&nbsp;Moſs, by reaſon of the envy of the nobility </span><span class="font1">on </span><span class="font0">account&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font0">his being preferred </span><span class="font1">to </span><span class="font0">the command.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
