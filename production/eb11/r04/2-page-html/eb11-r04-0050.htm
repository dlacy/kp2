<p><span class="font2">in the recognition of the efficacy of </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">certain acts </span><span class="font2">done in presence of two or three of the clergy and thereafter recorded in the church&nbsp;registers; in the disabilities as to marriage and succession with&nbsp;which heretics and apostates were visited, and in a variety of minor&nbsp;matters. Of greater importance were three features for which it&nbsp;was directly responsible—the repeal of the caduciary provisions of&nbsp;the Papia-Poppaean law, the penalties imposed upon divorce, and&nbsp;the institution of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">episcopates audientia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The purpose of the caduciary law was to discourage celibacy and encourage fruitful marriages; but legislation in such a spirit could&nbsp;not possibly be maintained when celibacy had come to be inculcated&nbsp;as a virtue* and as the peculiar characteristic of a holy life. The&nbsp;penalties alike of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">orbitas</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">coelibatus</span><span class="font2"> were abolished by Constantine&nbsp;in the year 320. The legislation about divorce, from the first of&nbsp;Constantine’s enactments on the subject down to those of Justinian,&nbsp;forms a miserable chapter in the history of the law. Not one.of&nbsp;the emperors who.busied himself with the matter, undoing the ill*&nbsp;advised, work of his predecessors and substituting legislation, of his&nbsp;own quite as complicated and futile, thought of interfering with the&nbsp;old principle that divorce ought to be as free as marriage and independent of the sanction or decree of a judicial tribunal. Justinian&nbsp;was the first who, by one of his Novels, imposed a condition on parties&nbsp;to a divorce of common accord </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(communi consensu)</span><span class="font2">, namely, that&nbsp;they should both enter a convent, otherwise it should be null.; but,&nbsp;so distasteful was this to popular feeling, and so little conducive to&nbsp;improvement of the tone of morals within the conventual precincts,&nbsp;that it was repealed by his successor. The legislation of Justinian’s&nbsp;predecessors and the bulk of his own were levelled at one-sided repudiations, imposing, penalties, personal and patrimonial (1) upon&nbsp;the author of a repudiation on some ground the law did not recognize^&nbsp;as. sufficient—ana the lawful grounds varied almost from reign to&nbsp;reign—and (2) upon the party whose misconduct gave rise to a&nbsp;repudiation that was justifiable. The bishop’s court </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(episcopate&nbsp;judicium, episcopates audientia)</span><span class="font2"> had its origin in the practice of the&nbsp;primitive Christians, in accordance with the apostolic precept, of&nbsp;submitting their differences to one or two of their brethren in the&nbsp;faith, usually a presbyter or bishop, who acted as arbiter. On the&nbsp;state recognition of Christianity the practice obtained legislative&nbsp;sanction, Constantine giving the bishop’s court concurrent jurisdiction with the ordinary civil courts where both parties preferred&nbsp;the former, and by a later enactment (whose authenticity, however,&nbsp;is open to some doubt) going so far as to empower one of the parties&nbsp;to a suit to remove it to the ecclesiastical tribunal against the will&nbsp;of the other. He also declared that the judgments were to be&nbsp;enforced by the civil courts.<sup>@@1</sup> For various reasons, advantage was&nbsp;taken of this power of . resorting to the bishop to an extent which&nbsp;seriously interfered with the proper discharge of his spiritual&nbsp;functions, so that in 398 Arcadius in the Eastern Empire judged&nbsp;it expedient to revert to Constantine’s original rule, and, at least&nbsp;as regarded laymen, to limit the right of resort to the episcopal&nbsp;judicatory to cases in which both parties consented. The same&nbsp;thing was done by Valentinian in the Western Empire in 452. It&nbsp;is impossible to say with any approach to exactitude what effect&nbsp;this intervention of the clergy as.judges in ordinary civil causes—&nbsp;for they had no proper criminal jurisdiction—had on the development of the law. But it can hardly have been without some&nbsp;influence in still further promoting the tendency to subordinate act&nbsp;and word to will and intention, to deal leniently with technicalities,&nbsp;and to temper the rules of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">jus civile</span><span class="font2"> with equity and considerations of natural right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">A bandonment of the. Formular System of Procedure.<sup>@@2</sup> -</span><span class="font2">The formular system, with its remit from the praetor to a sworn </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">judex</span><span class="font2"> who was&nbsp;to try,the cause, was of infinite advantage to the law; for&nbsp;the judgment was as a rule that of a free and independent&nbsp;citizen* untrammelled by officialism, fresh from some centre&nbsp;of business, chosen by, and in full sympathy with, the&nbsp;parties between whom he had to decide. Such a system&nbsp;was incompatible with the autocratic government of Diocletian and&nbsp;Constantine; and it is with no surprise that we find the former of&nbsp;these sovereigns instructing the provincial governors that in future,&nbsp;unless w'hen prevented by . pressure of business (or, according to&nbsp;a later constitution of Julian’s, when the matter was of trifling&nbsp;importance), they were not to remit them but were themselves to hear&nbsp;the causes brought.before them from first to last, as had previously&nbsp;been the practice in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">extraordinariae cognitiones.</span><span class="font2"> The remit in&nbsp;the excepted cases was not, as formerly, to a private citizen, but&nbsp;to what was called a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">judex pedaneus,</span><span class="font2"> who acted as an inferior substitute of the magistrate and was probably a matriculated member&nbsp;of the local bar; and for a time his delegated authority was embodied</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2">in a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">formula</span><span class="font2"> after the old fashion. But even this exceptional use of it did not long survive, for an enactment by the two sons of&nbsp;Constantine, conceived in terms the most comprehensive, declared&nbsp;fixed styles to be but traps for the unwary, and forbade their use&nbsp;in any legal act whatever, whether contentious or voluntary. The&nbsp;result was, not only the formal disappearance of the distinction&nbsp;between the proceedings </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">in jure</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">in judicio (judicium</span><span class="font2"> receiving&nbsp;a more extensive meaning) but the practical (though not formal)&nbsp;disappearance also of the distinctions between actions </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">in jus</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">in&nbsp;factum,</span><span class="font2"> and between </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">actiones directae</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">actiones utiles,</span><span class="font2"> the conversion of the interdict into an </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">actio ex interdicto,,</span><span class="font2"> admission of the&nbsp;power of amendment of the pleadings, condemnation in the specific&nbsp;thing claimed, if in existence, instead of its pecuniary equivalent,&nbsp;and execution accordingly by the aid of officers of the law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Under the new system a process was full from first to last of intervention by officials. Tnc </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">in jus vocatio</span><span class="font2"> of the XII. Tables&nbsp;—the procedure by which a plaintiff himself brought his adversary&nbsp;into court—became a thing of the past. So also did the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">vadimonium.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">In the earlier part of the period the proceedings commenced with&nbsp;the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">litis denuntiatio</span><span class="font2"> introduced in the time of Marcus Aurelius and&nbsp;remodelled by Constantine; but under Justinian (though probably&nbsp;begun before his reign) the initial step was what was. called the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">libellus conventionis.</span><span class="font2"> This was a short and precise written statement addressed by the plaintiff to the court, explaining (but without detail) the nature of the action he proposed to raise and the&nbsp;claim he was making, which was accompanied by a formal undertaking to proceed with the cause and follow it out to judgment,&nbsp;under penalty of having to pay double costs to the defendant. If&nbsp;the judge was satisfied of the relevancy of the libel, he pronounced&nbsp;an interlocutor </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(interlocutio)</span><span class="font2"> ordaining its service on the respondent;&nbsp;this was done by an officer of the court, who cited him to appear on&nbsp;a day named, usually at a distance of one or two months. The&nbsp;defendant, through the officer, had to. put in an answer </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(libellus&nbsp;contradictions), </span><span class="font2">at the same time giving security for the proper&nbsp;maintenance of the defence and eventual satisfaction of the judgment. If defendant did not appear after three summonses the&nbsp;case was heard and decree given in his absence. On the day appointed the parties or their procurators were first heard on any&nbsp;dilatory pleas, such as defect of jurisdiction;if none were offered,&nbsp;or those stated repelled, they then proceeded to expound their&nbsp;respective grounds of action and defence, each finally making oath&nbsp;of his good faith in the matter </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(juramentum calumniae),</span><span class="font2"> and their&nbsp;counsel doing the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">From this point, which marked the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">litis contestatio</span><span class="font2"> or joinder of issue, the procedure was much the same as that </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">in judicio</span><span class="font2"> under the&nbsp;formular system. Evidence was taken and judgment given. But&nbsp;in all cases in which the demand was that a particular thing should&nbsp;be given or restored, and the plaintiff desired to have the thing&nbsp;itself rather than damages, execution might be specific and effected&nbsp;through officers of the law </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(manu militari).</span><span class="font2"> Where, on the other&nbsp;hand, the condemnation was pecuniary, the usual course, where&nbsp;performance was not made, was for the judge, through his officers,&nbsp;to take possession of such things belonging to the defendant as&nbsp;were thought sufficient to satisfy the judgment </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(pignus </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">causa&nbsp;judicati captum),</span><span class="font2"> and they were eventually sold judicially if the&nbsp;defendant still refused to pay; the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">missio in bona</span><span class="font2"> of the classical&nbsp;period was not resorted to except in the case of insolvency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Valentinian Law of Citations.<sup>@@3</sup> </span><span class="font2">This famous enactment, the production of Theodosius (II.), tutor of the youthful Valentinian III., was issued from Ravenna in the year 426,&nbsp;and was addressed to the Roman senate. It ran thus:—</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“ We accord our approval of all the writings of Papinian, Paul, Gaius, Ulpian and Modestine, conceding to Gaius the same authority that is enjoyed by Paul, Ulpian&nbsp;and the rest, and sanctioning the citation of all his works. We&nbsp;ratify also the jurisprudence </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(scientia)</span><span class="font2"> of those earlier writers whose&nbsp;treatises and statements of the law the aforesaid five have imported into their own works,—Scaevola, for example, and Sabinus<sub>r&nbsp;</sub>and Julian* and Marcellus,—and of all others whom they have been&nbsp;in the habit of quoting as authorities </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(omniumque quos illi celebrar-unt),</span><span class="font2"> provided always, as their antiquity makes them uncertain,&nbsp;that the texts of those earlier jurists are verified by collation of&nbsp;manuscripts.<sup>@@4</sup> If divergent </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">dicta</span><span class="font2"> be adduced* that party shall&nbsp;prevail who has the greatest number of authorities on his side; if&nbsp;the number on each side.be the same, that one shall prevail which&nbsp;has the support of Papinian; but, whilst he, most excellent of them&nbsp;all, is to be preferred to any other single authority, he must yield&nbsp;to any two. [Paul’s and Ulpian’s notes on his writings, however,&nbsp;as already enacted, are to be disregarded.] Where opinions are&nbsp;equal, and none entitled to preference, we leave it to the discretion&nbsp;of the judge which he shall adopt.”</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
