<p><span class="font1">very similar to that of the hare, but is smaller and lighter, with a slenderer muzzle and a longer and narrower palate. Besides&nbsp;these characters, the rabbit is separated from the hare by&nbsp;the fact that it brings forth its young naked, blind, and helpless; to compensate for this, it digs a deep burrow in the earth&nbsp;in which they are born and reared, while the young of the hare&nbsp;are born fully clothed with fur, and able to take care of themselves, in the shallow depression or “ form ” in which they&nbsp;are produced. The weight of the rabbit is from 2½ to </span><span class="font0">3 ℔</span><span class="font1">,&nbsp;although wild individuals have been recorded up to more than&nbsp;5 ℔. Its general habits are too well known to need detailed&nbsp;description. It breeds from four to eight times a year, bringing&nbsp;forth each time from three to eight young; its period of gestation is about thirty days, and it is able to bear when six months&nbsp;old. It attains to an age of about seven or eight years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The rabbit is believed to be a native of the western half of the Mediterranean basin, and still abounds in Spain, Sardinia,&nbsp;southern Italy, Sicily, Greece, Tunis and Algeria; and many&nbsp;of the islands adjoining these countries are overrun with these&nbsp;rodents. Thence it has spread, partly by man’s agency, north-wards throughout temperate western Europe, increasing rapidly&nbsp;wherever it gains a footing; and this extension is still going&nbsp;on, as is shown by the case of Scotland, where early in the&nbsp;19th century rabbits were little known, while they are now&nbsp;found in all suitable localities up to the extreme north. It has&nbsp;also gained admittance into Ireland, and now abounds there&nbsp;as much as in England. Out of Europe the same extension&nbsp;of range has been going on. In New Zealand and Australia&nbsp;rabbits, introduced either for profit or sport, have increased&nbsp;to such an extent as to form one of the most serious pests&nbsp;that the farmers have to contend against, as the climate and&nbsp;soil suit them perfectly and their natural enemies are too few&nbsp;and too lowly organized to keep them within reasonable bounds.&nbsp;In North America about thirty species and twice as many geographic races (subspecies) are known, and the occurrence&nbsp;of several distinct fossil forms shows that the genus has long&nbsp;been established. The chief variety is the common grey or&nbsp;cottontail (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lepus floridanus).</span><span class="font1"> For the “jack-rabbit, ” see&nbsp;Hare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The rabbit has been domesticated from an early period. Little doubt exists amongst naturalists that all the varieties of the domestic&nbsp;animal are descended from </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Oryctotagus cuniculus.</span><span class="font0"> The variations&nbsp;which have been perpetuated and intensified by artificial selection are,&nbsp;with the exception of those of the dog, greater than have been induced&nbsp;in any other mammal. For not only has the weight been more than&nbsp;quadrupled in some of the larger breeds, and the structure of the&nbsp;skull and other parts of the skeleton greatly altered, but the proportionate size of the brain has been reduced and the colour and&nbsp;texture of the fur altered in a remarkable manner. The lop-eared breed is the oldest English variety, and has been cultivated&nbsp;carefully since about 1785, the aim of the breeder being directed&nbsp;to the development of the size of the ears, and with such success&nbsp;that they sometimes measure more than 23 in. from tip to tip&nbsp;and exceed 6 in. in width. This development, which is accompanied by changes in the structure of the skull, depends on breeding the animals in warm damp hutches, without which the best&nbsp;developed parents fail to produce the desired offspring. In colour&nbsp;lop-eared rabbits vary greatly. The Belgian hare is a large breed&nbsp;of a hardy and prolific character, which closely resembles the hare&nbsp;in colour, and is not unlike it in form. Some years ago these rabbits&nbsp;were sold as “ leporides ” or hybrids, produced by the union of the&nbsp;hare and the rabbit; but the most careful experimenters have failed&nbsp;to obtain any such hybrid, and the naked immature condition in&nbsp;which young rabbits are born as compared with the clothed and&nbsp;highly developed young hare renders it unlikely that hybrids could&nbsp;be produced. Nor does the flesh of the Belgian rabbit resemble&nbsp;that of the hare in colour or flavour. A closely allied variety,&nbsp;though of larger size, is known as the Patagonian rabbit, although&nbsp;it has no relation to the country after which it is called.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Angora rabbit is characterized by the extreme elongation and fineness of the fur, which in good specimens reaches 6 or 7 in.&nbsp;in length, requiring great care and frequent combing to prevent&nbsp;it from becoming matted. The Angoras most valued are albinos,&nbsp;with pure white fur and pink eyes; in some parts of the Continent&nbsp;they are kept by the peasants and clipped regularly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Amongst the breeds which are valued for the distribution of colour on the fur are the Himalayan and the Dutch. The former&nbsp;is white, but the whole of the extremities—viz. the nose, the ears,&nbsp;tail and feet—are black or very dark in colour. This very pretty&nbsp;breed has no connexion with the mountains from which it takes&nbsp;its name, but is a variety produced by careful breeding and selection.&nbsp;Though produced by crossing, it now generally breeds true to colour,&nbsp;at times throwing back, however, to the silver greys from which it&nbsp;was derived. The rabbits known as Dutch are small, and valued&nbsp;for the disposition of the colour and markings. The entire body&nbsp;behind the shoulder-blades is uniformly coloured, with the exception of the feet; the anterior part of the body, including the fore&nbsp;legs, neck, and jaws, is white, the cheeks and ears being coloured.&nbsp;In some strains the coloured portion extends in front of the fore&nbsp;legs, leaving only a ring of white round the neck. The more&nbsp;accurately the coloured portion is defined, the higher is the animal&nbsp;esteemed. The silver grey is a uniform-coloured breed, the fur of&nbsp;which is a rich chinchilla grey, varying in depth in the different&nbsp;strains. From the greater value of the fur, silver greys have been&nbsp;frequently employed to stock warrens, as they breed true to colour&nbsp;in the open if the ordinary wild rabbits are excluded. Other&nbsp;colours known, as silver fawn and silver brown, are closely related.&nbsp;A blue breed has been recently introduced. The largest and&nbsp;heaviest of all is the Flemish giant, with iron-grey fur above and&nbsp;white below. Other breeds include the Japanese, with an orange&nbsp;coat, broadly banded on the hind-quarters with black; the&nbsp;pink-eyed and short and thick-furred albino Polish; the Siberian,&nbsp;probably produced by crossing the Himalayan with the Angora;&nbsp;and the black-and-tan and blue-and-tan.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RABBŪLĀ, a distinguished bishop of the Syrian church early in the 5th century. He was a native of Ḳenneshrīn,&nbsp;a town some few miles south of Aleppo and the seat of a bishopric. His father was a heathen priest, and though his mother&nbsp;was a devoted Christian he continued in pagan belief and&nbsp;practice until some time after his marriage. During a journey&nbsp;to his country estates he was converted to Christianity partly&nbsp;through coming in contact with a case of miraculous healing&nbsp;and partly through the teaching and influence of Eusebius,&nbsp;bishop of Ḳenneshrīn, and Acacius, bishop of Aleppo. With&nbsp;all the energy of his fiery nature he threw himself into the&nbsp;practice of Christian asceticism, sold all his possessions, and&nbsp;separated from his wife and kinspeople. He resided for some&nbsp;time in a monastery, and then passed to a life of greater hardship as a solitary hermit. On the death of Diogenes, bishop of&nbsp;Edessa, in the year 411-412, Rabbūlā was chosen his successor,&nbsp;and at once accepted the position offered him, without any of&nbsp;the customary show of reluctance. As a bishop he was marked&nbsp;by extraordinary energy, by the continued asceticism of his&nbsp;personal life, by his magnificent provision for all the poor&nbsp;and suffering in his diocese, by his care for discipline among&nbsp;the clergy and monks who were under his authority, and latterly&nbsp;by the fierce determination with which he combated all heresies&nbsp;and especially the growing school of the followers of Nestorius.&nbsp;On one occasion he visited Constantinople and there preached&nbsp;before Theodosius II. (who was then favourable to Nestorius)&nbsp;and a great congregation a sermon in denunciation of Nestorian doctrine, of which a portion survives in the Syriac&nbsp;version. @@<sup>1</sup> He became the friend of Cyril of Alexandria, with&nbsp;whom he corresponded, and whose treatise </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">De recta fide</span><span class="font1"> he translated into Syriac. @@<sup>2</sup> After a busy episcopal life of twenty-four&nbsp;years he died in August 435, and was immensely lamented by&nbsp;the people of his diocese. His successor was the Nestorian&nbsp;Ibas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The literary remains of Rabbūlā are small in bulk, and are mostly to be found in Overbeck. Perhaps his main importance&nbsp;to the historian of Syriac literature lies in the zeal with which&nbsp;he strove to replace the Diatessaron or Gospel Harmony of&nbsp;Tatian by the edition of the separate Gospels, ordering that&nbsp;a copy of the latter should be placed in every church and should</span></p>
