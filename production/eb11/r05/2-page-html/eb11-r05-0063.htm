<p><span class="font0">RUDOLPH II. (1552-1 ór2), Roman emperor, son of the emperor Maximilian II. by his wife Maria, daughter of the&nbsp;emperor Charles V., was born in Vienna on the 18th of July&nbsp;1552. In 1563 he was sent to Spain, where his natural abilities&nbsp;were improved by a good education, but he lacked the frank&nbsp;and tolerant spirit of his father, resembling rather his uncle&nbsp;Philip II. of Spain. In 1572 he was crowned king of Hungary,&nbsp;three years later king of Bohemia; and in October 1575 he&nbsp;was chosen king of the Romans, or German king, at Regensburg,&nbsp;becoming emperor on his father’s death in October 1576. The&nbsp;importance of Rudolph’s reign is negative rather than positive,&nbsp;consisting more in what he did not do than in what he did;&nbsp;although it is questionable whether any ruler could have prevented the religious struggles of Germany and the Thirty Years’&nbsp;War.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The more active part of the emperor’s life was the period from his accession to about 1597. During that time he attended&nbsp;the infrequent imperial diets, and took an interest in the struggle&nbsp;in the Netherlands and the defence of the empire against the&nbsp;Turks. He was at times suspicious of the papal policy, while&nbsp;his relations with Spain were somewhat inharmonious. As a&nbsp;convinced Roman Catholic he forwarded the progress of the&nbsp;counter-reformation, and in general the tolerant policy of&nbsp;Maximilian II. was reversed. Political as well </span><span class="font1">as </span><span class="font0">religious&nbsp;privileges were attacked; the administration was conducted&nbsp;by Germans; and the result was a considerable amount of&nbsp;discontent which became very pronounced about the opening&nbsp;of the 17th century. Concurrently with the growth of this&nbsp;unrest Rudolph had become increasingly subject to attacks&nbsp;of depression and eccentricity, which were so serious as to&nbsp;amount almost to insanity. In 1604, after a war with&nbsp;Turkey had been in progress since 1593, many of the&nbsp;Hungarians rebelled against Rudolph and chose Stephen&nbsp;Bocskay as their prince. By this time the members of the&nbsp;Habsburg family were thoroughly alarmed at the indifference&nbsp;or incompetence of the emperor; and their anxieties were not&nbsp;diminished by the knowledge that he was in feeble health,&nbsp;was unmarried, and had refused to take any steps towards&nbsp;securing the election of a successor. In April 1606 they&nbsp;declared Rudolph incapable of ruling, and recognized one of&nbsp;his younger brothers, the archduke Matthias, afterwards emperor,&nbsp;as their head; and in the following June Matthias, having&nbsp;already with the emperor’s reluctant consent taken the conduct&nbsp;of affairs into his own hands, made peace by granting extensive&nbsp;concessions to the rebellious Hungarians, and concluded a&nbsp;treaty with the sultan in November of the same year. Then&nbsp;shaking off his lethargy Rudolph prepared to renew the war&nbsp;with the Turks; a move which Matthias met by throwing&nbsp;himself upon the support of the national party in Hungary.&nbsp;Matthias also found adherents in other parts of his brother’s&nbsp;dominions, with the result that in June 1608 the emperor was&nbsp;compelled to cede to him the kingdom of Hungary together&nbsp;with the government of Austria and Moravia. Rudolph now&nbsp;sought the aid of the princes of the empire, and even of the&nbsp;Protestants; but he had met with no success in this direction&nbsp;when trouble arose in Bohemia. Having at first rejected&nbsp;the demand of the Bohemians for greater religious liberty,&nbsp;the emperor was soon obliged to yield to superior force, and in&nbsp;1609 he acceded to the popular wishes by issuing the Letter&nbsp;of Majesty </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Majestatsbrief),</span><span class="font0"> and then made similar concessions&nbsp;to his subjects in Silesia and elsewhere. A short reconciliation&nbsp;with Matthias was followed by further disorder in Bohemia,&nbsp;which was invaded by Rudolph’s cousin, the archduke Leopold&nbsp;(1586-1632). The Bohemians invoked the aid of Matthias,&nbsp;who gathered an army; and in 1611 the emperor, practically&nbsp;a prisoner at Prague, was again forced to cede a kingdom&nbsp;to his brother. Rudolph died at Prague, his usual place of&nbsp;residence, on the 20th of January 1612, and was succeeded&nbsp;as emperor by Matthias.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rudolph was a clever and cultured man, greatly interested in chemistry, alchemy, astronomy and astrology; he was a&nbsp;patron of Tycho Brahe and Kepler, and was himself something&nbsp;of a scholar and an artist. He was the greatest collector of his&nbsp;age, his agents ransacking Europe to fill his museums with rare&nbsp;works of art. His education at the Spanish court and an&nbsp;hereditary tendency to insanity, however, made him haughty,&nbsp;suspicious and consequently very unpopular, while even in his&nbsp;best djiys the temper of hismind was that of a recluse rather&nbsp;than of a ruler.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The sources for the life and times of Rudolph II. are somewhat scanty, as many of the official documents of the reign, which were&nbsp;kept at Prague and not at Vienna, were destroyed, probably during&nbsp;the Thirty Years’ War.

<p><span class="font0">RUDOLPH, or Raoul (d. 936), king of the Franks and duke of Burgundy, was a son of Richard duke of Burgundy, and was&nbsp;probably a member of the Carolingian family. He became&nbsp;duke of Burgundy on his father’s death in 921, and having&nbsp;married Emma, daughter of Robert duke of the Franks,&nbsp;assisted his father-in-law to drive the Frankish king, Charles&nbsp;III. (the Simple), from his throne. Robert then became king&nbsp;of the Franks, and when he was killed in battle in June 923 he&nbsp;was succeeded by Rudolph, who was crowned at Soissons in&nbsp;the following month. Giving Burgundy to his brother-in-law&nbsp;Giselbert of Vergi (d. 956), the new king was fully occupied in&nbsp;resisting the attacks of the Normans, and in combating the&nbsp;partisans of Charles the Simple; but his enterprises were mainly&nbsp;unsuccessful, and his authority was not generally recognized.&nbsp;But when engaged in a struggle with his brother-in-law, Herbert&nbsp;II. count of Vermandois, over the possession of the county&nbsp;of Laon, Rudolph experienced happier fortunes. At Limoges&nbsp;a great victory was gained over the Normans, whose duke,&nbsp;William I., did homage to him in 933; invasions of Aquitaine&nbsp;led to his recognition as king by the powerful lords of that&nbsp;district; and Herbert of Vermandois was defeated and put to&nbsp;flight. In 935 peace was made between these rivals; and on&nbsp;the r4th of January 936 Rudolph died at Auxerre, leaving no&nbsp;sons.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RUDOLPH (d. 1080), German king, and duke of Swabia, opponent of the emperor Henry IV., was a son of Kuno count&nbsp;of Rheinfelden, who possessed estates in both Burgundy and&nbsp;Swabia. He received the duchy of Swabia from Agnes, regent&nbsp;and mother of the young king, Henry IV., in 1057, and two&nbsp;years later married the king’s sister Matilda (1045-1060), and&nbsp;was made administrator of the kingdom of Burgundy, or Arles.&nbsp;Differences soon arose between the king and his brother-in-law’,&nbsp;whose loyalty was suspected during the Saxon War of 1073.&nbsp;When Henry was excommunicated and deposed by pope&nbsp;Gregory VII., the princes met at Forchheim, and elected&nbsp;Rudolph as German king. He renounced the right of investiture, disclaimed any intention of making the crown hereditary&nbsp;in his family, and was crowned at Mainz on the 27th of March&nbsp;1077. He found no support in Swabia, but, uniting with the&nbsp;Saxons, won two victories over Henry’s troops, and, in 1080,&nbsp;was recognized by the pope. On the 15th of October 1080,&nbsp;Rudolph was severely wounded at Hohenmölsen, and died the&nbsp;next day. He was buried at Merseburg, where his beautiful&nbsp;bronze tomb is still to be seen.</span></p>
