He enacted a law, by which every person who should seek kingly power was pronounced accursed, so that any man might kill him without fear of punishment. In the presence of the assembly of the people, (the populus, ί. <hi rend="italic">e.</hi>  the comitia curiata,) he caused the ensigns of consular power to be lowered ; thus acknowledging the supreme authority of that assembly. But his best act was the passing of that law, <hi rend="italic">flex de provocatione,) </hi>which gave to all Roman citizens the right of appeal to the assembly of the people from the sentence of any magistrate. This was the first law enacted by the comitia centuriata ; and as soon as it was passed Valerius took away the axes from the bundles of rods which were borne before the consuls. This right of appeal existed only in the city itself, and within a mile of it. Beyond that distance the military power of the consuls remained unlimited, and the axes were borne and used as formerly. The enactment of these laws obtained for Valerius the surname of Poplicola.</p><p>As soon as they were passed, he held the comitia for the election of a consul in the room of Brutus. Spurius Lucretius was chosen ; and he dying within a few days, Marcus Horatius Pulvillus was elected to complete his year. About this time occurred that famous treaty between Rome and Carthage, mentioned by Polybius, and which is perhaps the best proof of the power of Rome under her latter kings. Ardea, Antium, Aricia, Circeii, and Terracina, are mentioned in such terms as to cause them to be regarded as subject cities, and Rome stipulates for them as well as for herself. The treaty was signed by Brutus and Horatius ; whence a difficulty has arisen, as these two were not at any time colleagues in the consular office. But Gibbon@@<hi rend="sup">1</hi> has shewn that such treaties were signed by the<hi rend="italic">feciales</hi>  more properly than by the consuls ; and there is no reason for doubting that Brutus and Horatius may have been conjoined in that office.</p><p>In the mean while Tarquinius, finding the inability of the Veientians and Tarquinians to replace him on the throne, applied to Lars Porsenna, king of Clusium, at that time the most powerful of all the Etruscan monarchs. Porsenna raised a great army, and marched towards Rome. He was met by the Romans near the fortress on the Janiculum ; but almost at the first encounter they took to flight, and the Etrurians pursued them impetuously as they sought safety by crossing the bridge. Horatius Cocles, seeing the danger that the city might be taken at once if the enemy should enter it along with the flying Romans, posted himself on the bridge, made head against the pursuers, and called on his countrymen to cut down the bridge between him and the city. Spurius Larcius, and Titus Herminius lent their aid in the heroic deed. When the bridge was nearly cut through, Codes sent back his two companions, and singly maintained his post. At length the crash of the falling beams, and the shouts of his countrymen gave him to know that the deed was done ; when calling on the god of the Tiber to receive him, he plunged into the stream, and, accoutered as he was, swam in safety to the shore, through the missile weapons of the enemy, which showered fast and thick around him.</p><p>Thus was the city saved from that sudden danger ; but all its peril was not over. Porsenna not only retained possession of the Janiculum, but sending his army across the river in boats, pillaged the country, cut off all supplies, and reduced Rome to the utmost distress by famine. In this emergency, a noble youth, Caius Mucius, undertook to rid his country of this dangerous enemy. He made his way into the camp of Porsenna, and entered into the very prae</p><lb/><p>torium, where he saw a person royally attired, and seated on a chair of state. Supposing this to be the king, Mucius sprung upon him, and stabbed him to the heart. He was immediately siezed, and led before Porsenna, whose secretary he had thus killed. There he acknowledged his deed, and told the king that his danger was by no means over. Porsenna threatened him with death by torture, unless he would divulge the plots by which his life was threatened. Mucius immediately stretched forth his right hand and thrust it into the fire of an altar which was burning before the king, saying, “ Behold how much I regard your threats of torture.” He held it in the flames till it was consumed, without a feature of his stern countenance indicating that he felt the pain. Porsenna, struck with his noble daring and contempt of suffering, commanded him to be set at liberty. Mucius then told him, in requital of his generosity, that he was only one of three hundred patrician youths who had vowed to kill Porsenna ; and that he must prepare for their attempts, which would be not less daring than his own. From that time Mucius was called Scaevola, or the left-handed, because he had thus lost the use of his right hand.</p><p>Alarmed by the dangers which threatened him from foes so determined, Porsenna offered terms of peace to the Romans. A treaty was at length concluded, according to which Porsenna ceased to maintain the cause of the Tar-quinian family ; but demanded the restitution of all the lands which the Romans had at any time taken from the states of Etruria, and that twenty hostages, ten youths and ten maidens of the first houses, should be given up to him for security that the treaty would be faithfully observed. The legend relates that Clœlia, one of the hostages, escaping from the Etrurian camp, swam across the Tiber on horseback, amidst showers of darts from her baffled pursuers ; but that the Romans, jealous of their reputation for good faith, sent her back to the camp of Porsenna. Not to be outdone in generosity, he gave to her and her female companions their freedom, and permitted her to take with her half of the youths ; while she, with the delicacy of a Roman maiden, selected those only who were of tender years. The Romans then, at the final settlement of the treaty, sent as a present to Porsenna, an ivory throne and sceptre, a golden crown, and a triumphal robe, the offerings by which the Etruscan cities had once acknowledged the sovereignty of Tarquinius.</p><p>When Porsenna quitted Rome, he entered the Latian territories, and attacked Aricia, the chief town of Latium. The Aricians being aided by the other Latian cities, and also by the Cumans, under the command of Aristodemus, defeated the Etruscans in a great battle, and put a stop to their aggressions. Thc Romans received the fugitives from Porsenna’s army, and treated them with great kindness ; in requital for which Porsenna restored to them thelands which he had conquered beyond the Tiber.</p><p>Such is an outline of the poetical legends respecting the great war against Porsenna. It is, however, clear from other accounts and indications,@@<hi rend="sup">2</hi> that Porsenna took the city, deprived it of one-third of its land, as was customary, imposed a tribute upon it, received the usual recognitions of sovereign authority, and even deprived the Romans of the use of metal in any other form than those employed in the purposes of agriculture, that they might not have it in their power to revolt. In this latter statement, we have again an incidental hint of the eastern origin and customs of the Etruscans ; in proof of which, reference may be made to the way in which the Philistines tyrannized over the Israelites during one of their periods of conquest.
