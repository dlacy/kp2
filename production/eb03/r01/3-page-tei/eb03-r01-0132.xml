Thoſe of the French academy, made un-der greater preffures, gave a much ſmaller reſiſtance ; and the very experiments adduced in ſupport of this theory are extremely deficient, wanting fully Jd of what the theory requires. The reſiſtances by experiment were 15∣ and 26J, and the theory required 20⅜ and 39, The equation, however, deduced ſrom the theory is greatly deficient in the expreſſion of the preffures cau' fed by the accumulation and depreſſion, ſtating the</p><p>heights of them as ≈ —, They can never be ſo high,</p><p>3 ?</p><p>becauſe the heaped up water flows off at the ſides, and it alſo comes in behind by the ſides j ſo that the preſſure is much leſs than half the weight oſ a column whoſe</p><p>height is —; both becauſe the accumulation and de-2∙P</p><p>preffion are leſs at the ſides than in the middle, and be-cauſe, when the body is wholly immerſed, the accumu-Jation is greatly diminiſhed. Indeed in this caſe the final equation does not include their effects, though as real in this caſe as when part of the body is above water.</p><p>Upon the whole, we are ſomewhat ſurpriſed that an author of D’Ulioa’s eminence ſhould have adopted a theory ſo unneceſſarily and ſo improperly embarraſſed with foreign circumſtances ; and that Mr Prony ſhould have inferted it with the explanation by which he was to abide, in a work deſtined ſor practical uſe.</p><p>This point, or the effect oſ deep immerſion, is ſtill much esnteſted ; and it 13 a received opinion, by many not ac-cuſtomed to mathematical reſearches, that the reſiſtance is greater in greater depths. This is aſſumed as an important principle by Mr Gordon, author of <hi rend="italic">A Theory of Naval Architecture ;</hi>  but on very vague and flight grounds ; and the author ſeems unacquainted with the manner of reafoning on ſuch ſubjects. It ſhall be con-ſidered afterwards.</p><p>with theſe corrections, it may be aſſerted that theory and experiment agree very well in this reſpect, and that the reſiſtance may be aſſerted to be in the duplicate ratio of the velocity,</p><p>we have been more minute on this ſubject, becaujfe it is the leading propofition in the theory of the ac</p><lb/><p>tion of fluids., Newton’s demonſtration of it take» na notice of the manner in which the various particles of the fluid are put into motion, or the motion which each in particular acquires. He only ſhows, that if there ba nothing concerned in the communication but pure ⅛-ertia, the ſum total of the motions of the particles, eſti-mated in the direction of the bodies motion, or that of the ſtream, will be in the duplicate ratio of the velocity. It was therefore of importance to ſhow that thia part of the theory was juſt, To do this, we had to conſider the effect of every circumſtance which could be combined with the inertia of the fluid, AU theſe had been forefeen by that great man, and are moſt briefly, though perſpicuouſly, mentioned in the laſt ſ¢hoHum to prop. 36. B.
