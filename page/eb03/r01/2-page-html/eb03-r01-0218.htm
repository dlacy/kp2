<p><span class="font1">Mountain, by the aſſiſtance of the Jacobin club, had now acquired a complete aſcendancy over the city of&nbsp;Paris. The Girondiſts or Briſſotines propoſed therefore to remove the convention from the capital ; and to&nbsp;prevent this, rhe </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mountain</span><span class="font1"> reſolved to make the ſame&nbsp;uſe of the people of the capital -againſt the Girondiſt&nbsp;party that they had formerly done againſt the monarch&nbsp;on the </span><span class="font0">I </span><span class="font1">oth of Auguſt. It is unneceſſary to ſtate in&nbsp;detail all the tumults that occurred either in Paris or in&nbsp;the convention during the remaining part of the month&nbsp;of May. On the 31ft, at four o’clock in the morning,&nbsp;the tociin was founded, the generale was beat, and the&nbsp;alarm guns fired. All was commotion and terror. The&nbsp;citizens flew to arms, and aſſembled round tbe convention. Some deputations demanded a decree of accuſation againſt 35 of its members. The day, however, was&nbsp;ſpent without deciſion. On the afternoon of the iſt&nbsp;of June an armed force made the ſame demand. On&nbsp;the 2d of June this was repeated, the tocſin again&nbsp;founded, and an hundred pieces of cannon ſurrounded&nbsp;the national hall. At laſt Barfere mounted the tribune. He was confidered as a moderate man, and reſpected by both parties ; but he now artfully deſerted&nbsp;the Girondiſts. He invited the denounced members&nbsp;voluntarily to reſign their character of repreſentatives.&nbsp;Some of them complied, and the preſident attempted&nbsp;to diſſolve the ſitting ; but the members were now&nbsp;imprifoned in their own hall. Henriot, commander of&nbsp;the armed force, compelled them to remain ; and the&nbsp;obnoxious deputies, amounting to upwards of 90 in&nbsp;number, were put under arreſt, and a decree of denunciation againſt them ſigned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is obvious, that on this' occaſion the liberties of France were trodden under foot. The minority of the&nbsp;national repreſentatives, by the aſſlſtance of an armed&nbsp;force raiſed in the capital, compelled the majority to&nbsp;ſubmit to their meaſures, and took the leading members&nbsp;prifoners. Thus the city of Paris aſſumed to itſelf the&nbsp;whole powers of the French republic ; and the nation&nbsp;was no longer governed by repreſentatives freely cliofen,&nbsp;but by a minority of their members, whoſe ſentiments&nbsp;the city of Paris and the Jacobin club had thought ſit to&nbsp;approve of. Human hiſtory is a maſs of contradictions.&nbsp;The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mountain</span><span class="font1"> party came into power by preaching liberty, and by violating its fundamental principles. How&nbsp;ſar the plea of political neceffity may excuſe their con-duct, we ſhall not venture to decide explicitly. Certain&nbsp;it is, however, that they ſoon commenced a career of&nbsp;the moſt terrible energy both at home and abroad that&nbsp;is to be found in the annals of nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The ſirſt refult of their victory in the capital was ca-lamitous to the republic at large. Briſſot and ſome other deputies eſcaped, and endeavoured to kindle the&nbsp;flames of civil war. In general, however, the influence&nbsp;of the Jacobin club, and of its various branches, was&nbsp;ſuch, that the north of France adhered to the convention as it ſtood ; but the ſouthern departments were&nbsp;ſpeedily in a ſtate of rebellion. Tlie department of&nbsp;Lyons declared the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mountain</span><span class="font1"> party outlawed. Marfeilles and Toulon followed tlie example of Lyons, and&nbsp;entered into a confederacy, which has ſince been known&nbsp;by the appellation of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Faderaliſm.</span><span class="font1"> The departments of&nbsp;La Gironde and Calvades broke out into open revolt.&nbsp;In ſhort, the whole of France was in a ſtate of violent&nbsp;convulſion. Still, however, the enthuſiaſtic garriſons&nbsp;of Mentz and Valenciennes protected it againſt the ſm«&nbsp;mediate entrance of a foreign force, and allowed leiſure&nbsp;for one of its internal factions to gain an aſcendancy,&nbsp;and thereafter to protect its independence. In the&nbsp;mean time, the political entliuſiaſm of all orders of per-fons was ſuch, that even tlie female ſex did not eſcape&nbsp;its contagion. A young woman of the name of Charlotte Cordé, in tlie beginning of July, came from the&nbsp;department of Calvades to devote her life for what ſhe&nbsp;thought the cauſe of freedom and of her country. She&nbsp;requeſted an interview with </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Marat,</span><span class="font1"> the moſt obnoxious&nbsp;of the Mountain party. Having obtained it, and con-verſed with him calmly for ſome time, ſhe ſuddenly&nbsp;plunged a dagger in his breaſt, and walked careleſsly&nbsp;out of the houſe. She was immediately ſeized and&nbsp;condemned. At the place of execution ſhe behaved&nbsp;with infinite conſtancy, ſhouting </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vive la république.</span><span class="font1"> The&nbsp;remains of Marat were interred with great ſplendor,&nbsp;and the convention attended his funeral. His party&nbsp;perhaps derived advantage from the manner of his&nbsp;death, as it ſeemed to fatten the odious charge of affaſ-ſination upon their antagoniſts, and gave them the appearance of ſuffering in the cauſe of liberty. The&nbsp;truth is, that aſſaffination was ſanctioned by both parties under pretence of defending the liberties of the republic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">One of the ſirſt acts of the Mountain junto after their triumph was to ſiniſh the republican conftitution.&nbsp;Previous to tlieir fall, the Girondiſts liad brought forward tlie plan of a conſtitution, chiefly the work of&nbsp;Condorcet; but it never was ſanctioned by the convention, and was too intricate to be practically uſeful.&nbsp;The new conſtitution now framed, which was afterwards ſanctioned by the nation, but has never yet been&nbsp;put in practice, aboliſhes the former mode of electing&nbsp;the repreſeutatives of the people through the medium&nbsp;of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">electoral</span><span class="font1"> aſtemblies, and appoints them to be choſen&nbsp;immediately by the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">primary</span><span class="font1"> aſſemblies, which are made&nbsp;to conſiſt of from 200 to 600 citizens, each man vo-ting by ballot or open vote at his option. There is··&nbsp;one deputy for every 40,000 individuals, and population is the ſole baſis of repreſentation. The elections&nbsp;take place every year on the iſt of May. Electoral&nbsp;aſtemblies are ſtill retained ſor one purpoſe. Every&nbsp;200 citizens in the primary aſſemblies name one elector ;&nbsp;and an aſſembly of all the electors of the department is&nbsp;afterwards held, which elects candidates ſor the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">executive&nbsp;council,</span><span class="font1"> or miniſtry of the republic. The legiſſative body&nbsp;choofes out of this liſt of candidates the members of&nbsp;the executive council. One half of this council is renewed by each legiſſature in the laſt month of the ſeſc&nbsp;ſlon. Every law, after it is paſſed by the legiſſative&nbsp;body, is ſent to the department. Iſ in more than half&nbsp;of the departments the tenth of the primary aſſemblies&nbsp;of each have not objected to it, it becomes effectual..&nbsp;Trial by jury is eſtabliſhed. National conventions may&nbsp;be called for altering the conſtitution, and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">muß</span><span class="font1"> be call-ed, if · required by the tenth of the primary affemblies&nbsp;of eacll department in a majority of the departments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The publication of tliis conſtitution procured no ſmall degree of applauſe to the convention and the&nbsp;Mountain party. The rapidity with which it was&nbsp;formed (being only a fortnight) ſeemed to caſt a juſt&nbsp;reproach upon the ſſowneſs of their antagoniſts, and it&nbsp;was regarded as a proof of their being decidedly ſe-</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
