                >radix)</span><span class="font1">, the underground part&nbsp;of a plant. This is
                the popular meaning of the word. In its&nbsp;botanical use the term is more
                restricted (see below). The&nbsp;various other meanings have all developed from
                this, its primary,&nbsp;significance. Of these the principal are: the source or
                origin&nbsp;of a condition, state, quality, &amp;c.; the base or embedded part
                of&nbsp;a structure of the body, such as a nail, tooth, the hair, &amp;c.;&nbsp;in
                mathematics, a number, quantity or dimension which&nbsp;produces a given expression
                when multiplied by itself a&nbsp;requisite number of times; and in philology an
                ultimate&nbsp;element of language, incapable of further analysis. A particular
                extension of the primary meaning is that which applies&nbsp;the word generally to a
                class of plants, such as the turnip&nbsp;or carrot, whose root is fleshy, and edible
                either by man or&nbsp;domestic animals.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The embryo of a typical plant, for instance a pea plant (fig. 1), has
                an ascending axis which will grow into the shoot,&nbsp;and a descending axis or
                radicle which will grow into the root.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">When the seed germinates, the radicle is the first to appear;&nbsp;it
                grows downwards, and its&nbsp;primary function is to act as a&nbsp;holdfast for the
                plant; its most&nbsp;important function, however, is&nbsp;the absorption of water
                and&nbsp;dissolved nutrient substances&nbsp;from the soil, and it* also frequently
                serves for storage of foodstuffs. The root is distinguished&nbsp;from underground
                shoots by not&nbsp;bearing leaves and by having&nbsp;its apex (growing point)
                protected by a cap (root-cap), which&nbsp;can be clearly seen by making a median
                vertical section&nbsp;through the root-tip; the cap&nbsp;protects it in its passage
                through the soil. The root also&nbsp;generally bears root-hairs, slender unicellular
                outgrowths of&nbsp;the outer layer, borne in the&nbsp;region a little behind the
                root-tip. It is by means of the&nbsp;root - hairs especially that the&nbsp;root is
                brought into close relation with the soil particles and&nbsp;absorbs the nutrient
                materials in&nbsp;solution in the water which surrounds these particles.
                The&nbsp;older root-hairs are continually&nbsp;dying off, so that they are
                borne&nbsp;only on a small part of the area&nbsp;behind the apex. Branches
                of&nbsp;the root, which repeat the form&nbsp;and structure of the main
                root,&nbsp;are developed in regular succession from above
                downwards&nbsp;(acropetal), and owing to the fact&nbsp;that they originate in a
                definite&nbsp;position in the interior of the&nbsp;root (endogenous) they
                develop&nbsp;in longitudinal rows and have&nbsp;to break through the
                overlying&nbsp;tissue of the parent root (fig. 2). True forking of the
                root&nbsp;(dichotomy) occurs in the Lycopodiaceae (the shoots of which&nbsp;also
                branch dichotomously), but is unknown in the higher</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">plants.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Roots which originate elsewhere than as acropetal outgrowths of a
                main root are known as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
                >adventitious,</span><span class="font1"> and may</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">arise on any part of a plant. They are especially numerous on
                underground stems, such as the under side of rhizomes,&nbsp;and also develop from
                stem nodes under favourable conditions,&nbsp;such as moisture and absence of light;
                a young shoot or a&nbsp;cutting placed in moist soil quickly forms adventitious
                roots.&nbsp;They may also arise from leaves under similar conditions, as,&nbsp;for
                instance, from begonia leaves when planted in soil.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The forms of roots depend on their shape and mode of branching. When
                the central axis goes deep into the ground in a tapering manner,*&nbsp;without
                dividing, a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
                >tap-root</span><span class="font1"> is produced. This kind of root is sometimes
                shortened, and becomes swollen by storage of food-stuffs,&nbsp;forming the
                </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">conical</span><span
                class="font1"> root of carrot, or </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">the fusiform</span><span class="font1"> or
                spindle-shaped&nbsp;root ofradish, or the </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">napiform</span><span class="font1"> root of turnip. In
                ordinary forest&nbsp;trees the first root protruded continues to elongate and forms
                a&nbsp;long primary root-axis, whence secondary axes come off. In&nbsp;primary
                plants, especially Monocotyledons, the primary axis soon&nbsp;dies and the secondary
                axes take its place. When the descending&nbsp;axis is very short, and at once
                divides into thin, nearly equal&nbsp;fibrils, the root is called </span><span
                class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">fibrous,</span><span class="font1"> as in
                many grasses (fig. 4); when&nbsp;the fibrils are thick and succulent, the root is
