Being aware that little reliance could be placed on the accounts received from the distant provinces, and stimulated by the curiosity of an active temperament, he resolved to visit every province in the empire. In his visit to Britain, he followed the same policy which he had shewn with regard to the East ; and instead of attempting a further reduction of Caledonia, relinquished a portion of Agricola’s conquests, and erected a new wall, as a boundary-line of defence, from the Solway Firth to the Tyne, near Newcastle. He traversed Gaul and Germany, and revisited Asia, where he allayed some commotions that had arisen during his absence. Africa was also honoured by his presence. He spent a winter at Athens, again traversed the eastern provinces and Egypt, and then gratified his learning and his taste by another temporary residence in Greece. He was passionately fond of literature and the fine arts, and possessed of no inconsiderable attainments; and by his patronage of the productions of genius, he called forth another Augustan age, though not of equal brilliancy.</p><p>During his reign, the persecutions of the Christians were renewed with great barbarity ; and the emperor scarcely seemed to think it worth his ½dfile to protect that most unoffending class of his subjects. To the Jews he shewed nothing but insulting cruelty. He gave orders that a Roman colony should be established at Jerusalem, and changed its name to Ælia Capitolina. These indignities led to a fierce insurrection of the Jews, headed by an impostor who pretended to be the Messiah, and assumed the name of Barco-hab, (the son of a star). A furious and sanguinary war, of nearly three years duration, almost entirely destroyed the very name and nation of the Jews, and it was decreed a capital crime if any Jew should again come within Judea.</p><p>After his return to Rome, he adopted Commodus Verus as his successor, and on his death, Titus Antoninus. He was soon afterwards seized with dropsy, and the sufferings he endured made him almost frantic. Neither the attention ofhis physicians, nor the company of philosophers and poets could sooth him. Death at length terminated his sufferings at Baiæ, in the sixty-third year of his age, and after a reign of twenty-one years.</p><p>T. Aurelius Antoninus, the adopted son and successor of Adrian, next ascended the throne. The first care of his reign was to prevent the senate from dishonouring the name of Adrian, by whose somewhat peevish and cruel conduct during his last illness, they had been offended. Not only did he succeed in this attempt, but the amiable anxiety which he displayed to protect the memory of his predecessor, earned for him the honourable designation of <hi rend="italic">the pious ;</hi>  hence the name Antoninus Pius, by which he is bcst known in history. It had been arranged by Adrian, not only that Antoninus should succeed him, but also that Antoninus should adopt both Marcus Aurelius as his immediate successor, and Cesonius Commodus Verus, the son of that Verus whom he had first adopted. This arrangement Antoninus Pius immediately ratified, by giving his daughter Faustina in marriage to Aurelius, while he tolerated the profligate conduct of Verus, solely out of regard to the memory of Adrian.</p><p>The reign of Antoninus Pius furnishes few materials for the historian, passing away like a placid dream in the midst of universal tranquillity. It was undoubtedly the most peaceful and happy period that ever Rome knew, whether as a republic or an empire. It seemed to realise the ideal speculations of those philosophical politicians who looked for good government or rational happiness then, and then only, when philosophers should be kings, or kings philosophers. It is no mcan portion of his praise, that he put an end to the persecution of the Christians throughout the empire. Few and slight were the wars of this reign. Of these, perhaps the most memorable was that waged in</p><p>Britain by Lollius Urbicus, who not only repressed the incursions of the Caledonians, but recovered the district between the wall of Adrian, and the line of forts erected by Agricola. By the directions of the emperor, the newly acquired territory was secured by a complete wall, consisting of ditch and rampart, along the line traced by Agricola, and since known as the wall of Antoninus, or Graham’s dike.</p><p>But the character of Antoninus was a more powerful protection to the Roman dominions than armies and military ramparts: so highly were his virtues respected through the world, that contending princes referred their disagreements to his arbitration, rather than to the fierce decision of the sword. The administration of all public affairs was conducted with the same spirit as if under the eye of the emperor, because every instance of malversation was immediately checked by removal from office, every instance of fidelity and judgment rewarded by the perpetuation of official rank. While the financial department was managed with the utmost frugality, no expenditure was spared which was evidently beneficial to the welfare of the community, in the foundation or improvement of useful institutions, such as the erection of public schools, and the maintenance of teachers. A liberal and enlightened encouragement was also given to commerce, with the view of rendering Rome the mistress of arts, as well as of arms, the centre of an empire acquired by the sword, but consolidated by civilization.</p><p>. Thus peaceful, happy, and beloved, Antoninus Pius reigned for a period of about twenty-three years, and died of a fever at one of his villas, universally regretted, and leaving to his own family nothing but his private property, and the inestimable heritage of a name, against which not even calumny had dared to insinuate a charge.</p><p>Marcus Aurelius, called also Antoninus from having been adopted by his predecessor, and the Philosopher, from his proficiency in learning and his attachment to the opinions of the Stoics, succeeded to the throne, witll the cordial approbation of both senate and people. According to the arrangement of Adrian, Aurelius associated with himself in tlle empire Lucius Verus, a person of a very dissimilar character, to whom he gave his daughter in marriage. This dissimilarity however rendering any thing like rivalry impossible was perhaps the cause of the cordial harmony which subsisted between the colleagues during the course of their common reign. Verus took the command of the army which was sent against the Parthians, over whom, by the skill and valour of his generals, he obtained several considerable victories, and captured several towns, while he was himself revelling in debaucheries at Antioch. At the conclusion of this war, Verus returned to enjoy the honours of a triumph which he had no share in obtaining. Unfortunately, the eastern army brought with it to Rome the infliction of a pestilential disease which was then raging in Asia, and which soon spread its ravages throughout almost the whole of the Roman empire. A dreadful inundation of the Tiber about the same time laid a large part of tlle city under water, and swept away immense quantities of graih from the fields and the public storehouses. This was followed by a famine which consumed great numbers, in spite of tlle utmost exertions of the emperor.</p><p>While thus weakened by pestilence and famine, the empire was assailed by a most formidable confederacy of tlle Germanic nations. The Marcomanni, and other tribes of similar origin, began to press forward with great force upon the Dacian province. The two emperors left Rome to take the field in person against these dangerous antagonists. Verus died, however, soon after the beginning of the war, leaving Aurelius to take the sole command, and to exchange his philosophic studies for the din of arras. He proved himself not unequal to the task, although the war was protracted and chequered by various vicissitudes, vic∙</p></body></text></TEI>
