<p><span class="font0">Though he wrote a large volume, containing </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font0">theory of light and colours totally oppoſite to Newton’s, he&nbsp;has publiſhed many differtations on optical phenomena&nbsp;on the Newtonian principles, expreſsly becaufe hi6 own&nbsp;principles </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">non ideo facile anſam prod ebat analyfi inftru-endœ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Not a ſhadow of argument is given for the leading principle in this theory, t&gt;z⅛. that the velocity of the jet&nbsp;is the ſame with the velocity of the ſtream. None can&nbsp;be given, but faying that the preffure is equivalent to its&nbsp;production ; and this is affirming the very thing he la-bours to prove. The matter of fact is, that the velocity of the jet is greater than that of the ſtream, and&nbsp;may be greater almoſt in any proportion, which curious circumſtance was difcovered and ingeniouſly explained long ago by Daniel Bernoulli in his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hydrodyna-mica.</span><span class="font0"> It is evident that the velocity muſt be greater,&nbsp;were a ſtream of ſand to come againſt the plane, what&nbsp;goes through would indeed preſerve its velocity unchanged : but when a real ſiuid ſtrikes the plane, all that&nbsp;does not paſs through is deflected on all ſides ; and by&nbsp;theſe deflections forces are excited, by which the filaments which ſurround the cylinder immediately fronting&nbsp;the hole are made to preſs this cylinder on all fides, and&nbsp;as it were ſqueeze it between them : and thus the particles at the hole muſt of neceſſity be accelerated, and&nbsp;the velocity of the jet muſt be greater than that of the&nbsp;ſtream. λVe are diſpoſed to think that, in a fluid perfectly incompreſſible, the velocity will be doubled, or at&nbsp;leaſt increafed in the proportion of ι to √L If the&nbsp;fluid is in the finalleſt degree compreſſible, even in the&nbsp;very ſmall degree that water is, the velocity at the ſirſt&nbsp;impulſe may be much greater. D. Bernoulli found that&nbsp;a column of water moving y feet per ſecond, in a tube&nbsp;ſome hundred feet long, produced a velocity of 136&nbsp;ſeet per fecond in the firſt moment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There being this radical defect in the theory of Mr Euler, it is needleſs to take notice of its total inſuſſi-ciency for explaining oblique impulſesand the refiſtance&nbsp;of curvilineal prows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">we are extremely ſorry that our readers are deriving ſo little advantage from all that we have ſaid ; and that&nbsp;having taken them by the hand, we are thus obliged to&nbsp;grope about, with only a few ſcattered rays of light to&nbsp;direct our ſteps. Let us ſee what aſſiſtance we can get&nbsp;from Mr d’Alembert, who has attempted a folution of&nbsp;this problem in a method entirely new and extremely&nbsp;ingenious. He ſaw clearly that all the followers of&nbsp;Newton had forſaken thc path which he had marked&nbsp;out for them in the ſecond part of his inveſtigation, and&nbsp;had merely amuſed themſelves with the mathematical&nbsp;difcuſſions with which his introductory hypothefis gave&nbsp;them an opportunity of occupying themſelves. He&nbsp;paid the deſerved tribute oſ applauſe to Daniel Bernoulli for having introduced the notion of pure preſſure&nbsp;as the chief agent in this bufineſs ; and he ſaw that he&nbsp;was in the right road, and that it was from hydroſtati-cal principles alone that we had any chance of explaining the phenomena of hydraulics. Bernoulli had only&nbsp;confidered the preſſures which were excited in conſequence of the curvilineal motions of the particles. Mr&nbsp;d’Alembert even thought that thefe preſſures were not&nbsp;the conſequences, but tlie caufes, of theſe curvilineal&nbsp;motions. No internal motion can happen in a fluid-blit in conſequence of an unbalanced preſſure ; and every</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">ſuch motion will produce an inequality of preffure, which will determine the ſucceeding motions. He there-fore endeavoured to reduce all to the diſcovery of thofe&nbsp;diſturbing preſſures, and thus to the laws of hydroſta-tics. Fie had long before this hit on a very refined&nbsp;and ingenious view oſ the action of bodies on each&nbsp;other, which had enabled him to ſolve many of the moſt&nbsp;difficult problems concerning the motions of bodies, ſuch&nbsp;as the centre of oſcillation, of ſpentaneous converſion,&nbsp;the preceſſion of the equinoxes, &amp;c. &amp;c. with great facility and elegance. He ſaw that the fame principle&nbsp;would apply to the action of fluid bodies. The principle is this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">&quot; In whatever manner any number of bodies are ſuppofed to act on each other, and by theſe actions come to change their preſent motions, if we conceive that the motion which&nbsp;each body would have in the following infant ( if it became&nbsp;free), is refolved into two other motions ; one of which is&nbsp;the motion which it really takes in the following infant ;&nbsp;the other will be fuch, that iſ each body had no other motion but this ſecond, the whole bodies would have remained&nbsp;in equilibria.” VIe</span><span class="font0"> here obſerve, that &quot; the motion&nbsp;which each body would have in the following inſtant,&nbsp;if it became free,” is a continuation of the motion&nbsp;which it has in the firſt inſtant. It may therefore perhaps be better expreſſed thus :</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">If the motions of bodies, anyhow acting on each other, be cοnfdered in two confecuùve irfants, and if we conceive&nbsp;the motion which it has in the frf infant as compounded of&nbsp;two others, one of which is the motion which it actually&nbsp;takes in the ſecond infant, the other is ſueh, that if each&nbsp;body had only thoſe ſecond motions, the whole fyfem would&nbsp;have remained in equilibrio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The propoſition itſelf is evident. For if theſe fe-cond motions be not ſuch as that an equilibrium of thc whole ſyftem would reſult from them, the other component motions would not be thoſe which the bodies&nbsp;really have after the change ; for they would neceſſari.&nbsp;ly be altered by theſe unbalanced motions. See D’A-lembert </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">IIffai de Dynamique.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Aſſiſted by this inconteſtable principle, Mr d’Alem-bert demonſtrates, in a manner equally new and fimple, thofe propofitions which Newton had ſo cautioufly deduced from his hypothetical fluid, ſhowing that they&nbsp;were not limited to this hypothefis, *u∕z. that the motions produced by fimilar bodies, limilarly projected in&nbsp;them, would be fimilar ; that whatever were the preſ-ſures, the curves deſcribed by the particles would be the&nbsp;ſame ; and that the refiſtance3 would be proportional&nbsp;to the ſquares of the velocities. He then comes to confider the fluid as having its motions conſtrained by the&nbsp;form oſ the canal or by ſolid obſtacles interpoſed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">we ſhall here give a ſummary account of his fundamental propofitioπ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is evident, that if the body ADCE (fig. 16.) did not form an obſtruction to the motion of the water, the&nbsp;particles would deſcribe parallel lines TF, OK, PS, &amp;c.&nbsp;But while yet at a diſtance from the body in F, K, S,&nbsp;they gradually change their directions, and deſcribe the&nbsp;curves FM, K </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">nι,</span><span class="font0"> S </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">n,</span><span class="font0"> fo much more incflrvated as they&nbsp;are nearer to the body. At a certain diſtance ZY this&nbsp;curvature will be inſenſible, and the fluid included in&nbsp;the fpace ZYHQjvill move uniformly as if the fo!id&nbsp;body were not there. The motions on the other fide&nbsp;oi the axis AC will be the ſame ; and we need only</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
