<p><span class="font0">was plundered by Ethelred, king of Mercia, and subsequently it suffered severely from the ravages of the Danes. About 930, when&nbsp;three mints were established there by Athelstan, it had grown&nbsp;to be one of the principal ports of the kingdom. λ∖ illiam the Conqueror granted the town to his half-brother Odo, bishop ot Bayeux,&nbsp;who, on account of his connexion in the conspiracy in favour of&nbsp;Robert, duke of Normandy, was besieged in the castle and deprived&nbsp;of his possessions. In 1130 and again in 1137 the city was nearly&nbsp;destroyed by fire. A grand tournament was held at the castle by&nbsp;Henry III. in 1251. The city was visited in 1522 by Henry VIII.&nbsp;accompanied by the emperor Charles V., and in 1573 Elizabeth&nbsp;remained there five days. Charles II. passed through it on his&nbsp;way to London at the Restoration, and at the Revolution James II.&nbsp;embarked at the port on his way to France. The bishop’s see was&nbsp;founded in 600, and the city received its first charter of incorporation from Henry II. in 1165. It has returned members to parliament since the 23d of Edward I.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROCHESTER, a city of the United States, capital of Monroe county, New York, lies 229 miles to the west of&nbsp;Albany (43° 9' 22&quot;<sup>-</sup>44 N. lat. and 77° 36' 50&quot;<sup>,</sup>97 W. long.),&nbsp;in a rich agricultural region, upon a plateau on both banks&nbsp;of the Genesee river, 7 miles from its mouth at Lake&nbsp;Ontario and 263 feet above the lake level. There are&nbsp;three falls in the river of 96, 26, and 83 feet respectively&nbsp;within the city limits, the banks below the first fall varying in height from 100 to 210 feet. To this abundant&nbsp;water-power of the Genesee, supplemented by the transportation facilities afforded by the Erie Canal and the&nbsp;various railway connexions, Rochester mainly owes its&nbsp;progress and prosperity. The streets of the city are generally wide, and well paved and lighted (partly by electricity), and trees and flowering plants are abundant.&nbsp;Rochester is an important railway centre. The New York&nbsp;Central Railroad, with elevated tracks through the city,&nbsp;has two lines east to Syracuse, two west to Buffalo and&nbsp;Niagara Falls respectively, and one north to Charlotte,&nbsp;where connexion is made with the Rome, Watertown, and&nbsp;Ogdensburg line; a branch of the New York, Lake Erie,&nbsp;and Western Railway connects with the main line at&nbsp;Corning and with the Buffalo branch at Avon ; the Rochester and Pittsburgh Railway runs south to Salamanca,&nbsp;and the Genesee Valley Railway to Olean, crossing the&nbsp;West Shore Railway a short distance south of the city&nbsp;line ; and there are also railway lines to Irondequoit Bay&nbsp;and Windsor beach, and about 30 miles of street railway,&nbsp;radiating from the centre in all directions. The manufactures of Rochester are numerous and varied. Though&nbsp;no longer at the head of the flour industry, it still possesses&nbsp;twenty mills, capable of producing 2900 barrels daily.&nbsp;The principal manufacture is that of ready-made clothing,&nbsp;the sales reaching $9,000,000 annually. In its boot and&nbsp;shoe trade the city ranks fourth in the country (5000&nbsp;hands ; annual sales, $6,500,000). There are also sixteen&nbsp;breweries and ten malt-houses ; some eighty or ninety&nbsp;cigar-makers and tobacconists have a total output of&nbsp;about 2,000,000 lb of tobacco, 18,000,000 cigars, and&nbsp;140,000,000 cigarettes; while furniture-making employs&nbsp;1000 hands. The lumber business is extensive; and of&nbsp;late years the city has been one of the principal centres&nbsp;for the distribution of the anthracite and bituminous coal&nbsp;of Pennsylvania. Its numerous nurseries are a peculiar&nbsp;feature of the place ; and there is a great variety of other&nbsp;industries. The main supply of water is brought in iron&nbsp;conduits (147 miles of pipe) from Hemlock Lake, 29 miles&nbsp;to the south ; an additional supply for subsidiary purposes&nbsp;is drawn from the Genesee river (ll∣ miles of pipe). The&nbsp;total cost of the works has been $3,744,749. The princi&nbsp;pal cemetery, Mount Hope, with an area of 200 acres, is&nbsp;exceedingly picturesque and well cared for. Rochester&nbsp;has two State institutions, the Western House of Refuge&nbsp;and the Western New York Institution for Deaf Mutes.&nbsp;The former, opened in 1849, is a substantial structure of&nbsp;brick, with accommodation for 600 inmates, built at a&nbsp;cost of $373,000; it receives juvenile delinquents committed by magistrates ; they are instructed in trades and&nbsp;labour upon the farm belonging to the refuge. The institution for deaf mutes (1875) instructs about 160 pupils&nbsp;annually. Among the eleemosynary institutions of the&nbsp;city are the Rochester city hospital, St Mary’s hospital,&nbsp;the Rochester, St Patrick’s, St Mary’s, St Joseph’s, and&nbsp;the Jewish orphan asylums, the home for the friendless,&nbsp;the industrial school, the church home, the home of industry, and the home for truant children. There are&nbsp;75 churches, including the Roman Catholic cathedral, 6&nbsp;Baptist, 10 Methodist Episcopal, 10 Protestant Episcopal,&nbsp;11 Presbyterian, 5 Lutheran, and 11 Roman Catholic&nbsp;churches, and 5 Jewish synagogues. The public school&nbsp;system of Rochester includes a free academy (cost $125,000)&nbsp;and thirty grammar-schools (with classes in the orphan&nbsp;asylums), in which 200 teachers are engaged and 10,000&nbsp;pupils taught. There are also thirty private institutions,&nbsp;academies, seminaries, and parochial schools. The university of Rochester was established in 1850, under Baptist&nbsp;auspices ; its faculty consists of a president and ten professors, and the annual attendance of students is about 160.&nbsp;It has two buildings,—Anderson Hall and Sible Hall.&nbsp;The Rochester theological seminary (Baptist), founded in&nbsp;1850 and housed in two commodious buildings—Trevor&nbsp;and Rockefeller Halls—has eight professors and about&nbsp;seventy students, besides a German department. Other&nbsp;public libraries in addition to those of the university and&nbsp;the theological seminary are the central and Reynolds.&nbsp;There are four English and two German daily newspapers,,&nbsp;and twelve weekly and nine monthly publications. Among,&nbsp;edifices not already mentioned are the city-hall, the United&nbsp;States Government building, the court-house, the Warner&nbsp;astronomical observatory, the Rochester and East Side&nbsp;savings banks, the Powers buildings, with their famous&nbsp;art gallery, and the Warner and Kimball factories. The&nbsp;population (89,366 in 1880) was estimated at 115,000 in&nbsp;1885; the area of the city, which is divided into sixteen&nbsp;wards, is 4 square miles. The assessed valuation of real&nbsp;and personal property in 1885 was $40,952,070, and the&nbsp;debt was $5,249,000.</span></p>
