<p><span class="font1">lie has used the details of tradition, of local scenes, of religious usage, to embody it, he has built up in the form of an epic poem the most enduring and the most artistically&nbsp;constructed monument of national grandeur.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The second great poet of the time—Horace (65-8)—holds a lower place in the reverence of the world, but is perhaps&nbsp;as much loved and is even more largely and familiarly&nbsp;known. He is both the realist and the idealist of his age.&nbsp;If we want to know the actual lives, manners, and ways&nbsp;of thinking of the Romans of the generation succeeding&nbsp;the overthrow of the republic it is in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Satires</span><span class="font1"> and partially in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Epistles</span><span class="font1"> of Horace that we shall find them.&nbsp;If we ask what there was in the life of that time of more&nbsp;exquisite or more piquant charm, of more elevated enthusiasm, of graver experience, to stir the fancy and move the&nbsp;mood of imaginative reflexion, it is in the lyrical poems of&nbsp;Horace that we shall find the most varied and trustworthy&nbsp;answer. He was prepared for his double task by the&nbsp;experience of life and his strong hold on the actual world,&nbsp;and by drinking long and deeply of the purer and more&nbsp;remote sources of Greek inspiration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">His literary activity extends over about thirty years and naturally divides itself into three periods, each marked by&nbsp;a distinct character. The first—extending from about 40&nbsp;to 29—is that of the composition of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Epodes</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Satires.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">In the former he imitates the Greek poet Archilochus, but&nbsp;takes his subjects from the men, women, and incidents of&nbsp;the day. They are the expression of the least happy part&nbsp;of his career and the least estimable side of his nature.&nbsp;His humorous observation of life and the more serious&nbsp;grain in his character found more congenial occupation in&nbsp;perfecting the national work of Lucilius than in introducing “ the Parian iambics to Latium.” Personality is the&nbsp;essence of his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Epodes</span><span class="font1">; in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Satires</span><span class="font1"> it is used merely as&nbsp;illustrative of general tendencies. In the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Satires</span><span class="font1"> we find&nbsp;realistic pictures of social life, and the conduct and opinions of the world submitted to the standard of good feeling&nbsp;and common sense. The style of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Epodes</span><span class="font1"> is pointed and&nbsp;epigrammatic, that of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Satires</span><span class="font1"> natural and familiar.&nbsp;The hexameter no longer, as in Lucilius, moves awkwardly&nbsp;as if in fetters, but, like the language of Terence, of&nbsp;Catullus in his lighter pieces, of Cicero in his letters to&nbsp;Atticus, adapts itself to the everyday intercourse of life.&nbsp;The next period is the meridian of his genius, the time&nbsp;of his greatest lyrical inspiration, which he himself associates with the peace and leisure secured to him by his&nbsp;Sabine farm. The spirit of the child who had lost himself&nbsp;on Monte Voltore seemed to come back to him in his lonely&nbsp;wanderings among the Sabine hills. The life of pleasure&nbsp;which he had lived in his youth comes back to him, not&nbsp;as it was in its actual distractions and disappointments,&nbsp;but in the idealizing light of meditative retrospect. He&nbsp;had not only become reconciled to the new order of things,&nbsp;but was moved by his intimate friendship with Maecenas&nbsp;to aid in raising the world to sympathy with the imperial&nbsp;rule through the medium of his lyrical inspiration, as Virgil&nbsp;had through the glory of his epic art. With the completion of the three books of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Odes</span><span class="font1"> he cast aside for a time&nbsp;the office of the “ vates,” and resumed that of the critical&nbsp;spectator of human life, but in the spirit of a moralist&nbsp;rather than a satirist. He feels the increasing languor of&nbsp;the time as well as the languor of advancing years, and&nbsp;seeks to encourage younger men to take up the role of&nbsp;lyrical poetry, while he devotes himself to the contemplation of the true art of living. Self-culture rather than&nbsp;the fulfilment of public or social duty, as in the moral&nbsp;teaching of Cicero, is the aim of his teaching; and in this&nbsp;we recognize the influence of the empire in throwing the&nbsp;individual back on himself. As Cicero tones down his&nbsp;oratory in his moral treatises, so Horace tones down the&nbsp;fervour of his lyrical utterances in his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Epistles,</span><span class="font1"> and thus&nbsp;produces a style combining the ease of the best epistolary&nbsp;style with the grace and concentration of poetry,—the style,&nbsp;as it has been called, of “ idealized common sense,” that of&nbsp;the “urbanus’’and cultivated man of the world who is&nbsp;also in his hours of inspiration a genuine poet. In the&nbsp;last decennium of his life he resumed for a time, under&nbsp;pressure of the imperial command, his lyrical function, and&nbsp;produced some of the most exquisite and mature products&nbsp;of his art. But his chief activity is devoted to criticism.&nbsp;He first vindicates the claims of his own age to literary&nbsp;pre-eminence, and then seeks to stimulate the younger&nbsp;writers of the day to what he regarded as the manlier&nbsp;forms of poetry, and especially to the tragic drama, which&nbsp;seemed for a short time to give promise of an artistic&nbsp;revival. It seems strange that, although he must have&nbsp;known the writings of Propertius and the earlier writings&nbsp;of Ovid, he has no word of recognition for them. And,&nbsp;though he writes to Tibullus with friendly regard, he&nbsp;seems to value him as a student of philosophy more than&nbsp;as a poet, and says nothing to indicate that he believed&nbsp;his work would be more enduring than that of Titius or&nbsp;Julius Floras or lulus Antonius.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But the poetry of the latter half of the Augustan age destined to survive did not follow the lines either of lyrical&nbsp;or of dramatic art marked out for them by Horace. The&nbsp;latest form of poetry adopted from Greece and destined to&nbsp;gain and permanently to hold the ear of the world was the&nbsp;elegy. From the time of Mimnermus this form seems to&nbsp;have presented itself as the most natural vehicle for the&nbsp;poetry of pleasure in an age of luxury, refinement, and&nbsp;incipient decay. Its facile flow and rhythm seem to adapt&nbsp;it to the expression and illustration of personal feeling.&nbsp;It goes to the mind of the reader through a medium of&nbsp;sentiment rather than of continuous thought or imaginative&nbsp;illustration. The greatest masters of this kind of poetry&nbsp;are the elegiac poets of the Augustan age,—Tibullus, Propertius, and Ovid. Of these Tibullus (d. 19) is the most&nbsp;refined and tender. As the poet of love he gives utterance&nbsp;to the pensive melancholy rather than to the pleasures&nbsp;associated with it. In his sympathy with the life and&nbsp;beliefs of the country people he shows an affinity both to&nbsp;the idyllic spirit and to the piety of Virgil. There is&nbsp;something, too, in his fastidious refinement and in his&nbsp;shrinking from the rough contact of life that reminds us&nbsp;of the English poet Gray.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A poet of more strength and more powerful imagination, but of less refinement in his life and less exquisite taste&nbsp;in his art, is Propertius (c. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">50-c. 15),</span><span class="font1"> “the Roman Callimachus.” His youth was a more stormy one than that of&nbsp;Tibullus, and was passed, not like his, among the “healthy&nbsp;woods ” of his country estate, but amid all the licence of&nbsp;the capital. His passion for Cynthia, the theme of his&nbsp;most finished poetry, is second only in interest to that of&nbsp;Catullus for Lesbia; and Cynthia in her fascination and&nbsp;caprices seems a more real and intelligible personage than&nbsp;the idealized object first of the idolatry and afterwards of&nbsp;the malediction of Catullus. Propertius is a less accomplished artist and a less equably pleasing writer than either&nbsp;Tibullus or Ovid, but he shows more power of dealing&nbsp;gravely with a great or tragic situation than either of&nbsp;them, and his diction and rhythm give frequent proof of a&nbsp;concentrated force of conception and a corresponding movement of imaginative feeling which remind us of Lucretius.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The most facile and brilliant of the elegiac poets and the least serious in tone and spirit is Ovid (43 </span><span class="font0">B.C.-17 </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.),&nbsp;the latest in order of time. As an amatory poet he is the&nbsp;poet of pleasure and intrigue rather than of tender sentiment or absorbing passion. Though he treats his subject&nbsp;in relation to himself with more levity and irony than real</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
