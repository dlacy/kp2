<p><span class="font1">the time of Ælian this Iliad of Dares, priest of Hephæstus at Troy, was believed to exist. Nothing has since been&nbsp;heard of it ; but an unknown Latin writer living between&nbsp;400 and 600 took advantage of the tradition to compile&nbsp;what he styled </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Daretis Phrygii de Excidio Trojæ Histoma.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">It is in prose, and professes to be translated from an old&nbsp;Greek manuscript. Of the two works that of Dares is&nbsp;the later, and is inferior to Dictys. The matter-of-fact&nbsp;form of narration recalls the poem of Quintus Smyrnæus.&nbsp;Both compilations lack literary merit ; the gods and everything supernatural are suppressed ; even the heroes are&nbsp;degraded. The long success, however, of the two works&nbsp;distinguishes them above all apocryphal writings, and they&nbsp;occupy an important position in literary history on account&nbsp;of the impetus they gave to the diffusion of the Troy&nbsp;legend throughout western Europe. The Byzantine writers&nbsp;from the 7th to the 12th century exalted Dictys as a first-class authority, with whom Homer was only to be contrasted as an inventor of fables. Western people preferred&nbsp;Dares, because his history was shorter, and because, favouring the Trojans, he flattered the vanity of those who believed that people to have been their ancestors. Many&nbsp;MSS. of both writers were contained in old libraries ; and&nbsp;they were translated into nearly every language and turned&nbsp;into verse. In 1272 a monk of Corbie translated “sans&nbsp;rime </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">L'Estoire de Troiens et de Troie</span><span class="font1"> [de Dares] du Latin&nbsp;en Roumans mot à, mot ” because the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Roman de Troie</span><span class="font1"> (to&nbsp;be mentioned lower down) was too long. Geoffrey of&nbsp;Waterford put Dares into French prose ; and the British&nbsp;Museum possesses three Welsh MS. translations of the&nbsp;same author,—works indeed of a much later period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We know that the taste for Greek letters was never entirely lost in western Europe. Eginhard tells how&nbsp;Charlemagne understood Greek and how he encouraged&nbsp;the study. Alcuin states, with pardonable pride, that the&nbsp;library at York contained “ Græcia vel quidquid trans-misit clara Latinis,” which may, however, simply refer to&nbsp;Latin translations. Under any circumstances, however,&nbsp;this knowledge must have been confined to a few. It&nbsp;was through Latin that the Middle Ages knew the ancient&nbsp;world, and in that language read the Pseudo-Dares and&nbsp;Dictys, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Fables</span><span class="font1"> of Æsop, and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Iliad</span><span class="font1"> of Homer.</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>1&nbsp;</sup>Through these translations came many of the traces of Greek&nbsp;literature which occur in the fabliaux and romances. How&nbsp;numerous these traces were in the Arthurian cycle will be&nbsp;pointed out. The tale of the Dog of Montargis, familiar&nbsp;to readers of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Milles et Amys</span><span class="font1"> (Carolingian cycle), is derived&nbsp;from Plutarch. Cerberus may be found in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chanson&nbsp;d'Antioche</span><span class="font1"> ; the story of Tarquin in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chanson de geste&nbsp;Moniage Guillaume</span><span class="font1"> ; the judgment of Paris in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Foulkes de&nbsp;Candie</span><span class="font1"> ; and Cupid and Psyche in the romance of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Parten-opex of Blois.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For a thousand years the myth of descent from the dispersed heroes of the conquered Trojan race was a sacred literary tradition throughout western Europe, of which a&nbsp;possible survival still remains in the popular phrase which&nbsp;speaks of a generous and courageous fellow as a Trojan.&nbsp;The classical traditions of extensive colonization subsequent&nbsp;to the Trojan War were adopted by Western nations at a&nbsp;very early date. The first Franco-Latin chroniclers considered it a patriotic duty to trace their history to the&nbsp;same origin as that of Rome, as told by the Latin poets of&nbsp;the Augustan era; and in the middle of the 7th century&nbsp;Fredegarius Scholasticus </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Rer. Gall. Script.,</span><span class="font1"> ii. 461) relates&nbsp;how one party of the Trojans settled between the Rhine,</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">the Danube, and the sea. In a charter of Dagobert occurs the statement, “ex nobilissimo et antiquo Trojanorum&nbsp;reliquiarum sanguine nati.” The fact is repeated by&nbsp;chroniclers and panegyrical writers, who also considered&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">History of Troy</span><span class="font1"> by Dares to be the first of national&nbsp;books. Succeeding kings imitated their predecessors in&nbsp;giving official sanction to their legendary origin : Charles&nbsp;the Bald, in a charter, uses almost the same words as&nbsp;Dagobert—“ ex præclaro et antiquo Trojanorum sanguine&nbsp;nati.” In England a similar tradition had been early&nbsp;formulated, as appears from the Pseudo-Nennius (put&nbsp;together between the 7th and 9th centuries) and Geoffrey&nbsp;of Monmouth. Otto Frisingensis (12th century) and other&nbsp;German chroniclers repeat the myth, and the apocryphal&nbsp;hypothesis is echoed in Scandinavian sagas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the llth century the tale of Troy became the theme of Neo-Latin verse. About 1050 a monk named Bernard&nbsp;wrote </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">De Excidio Trojæ,</span><span class="font1"> and in the middle of the 12th&nbsp;century Simon Chèvre d’Or followed with another poem&nbsp;on the fall of the city and the adventures of Æneas, blending the Homeric and Virgilian records. We now come to&nbsp;a work on the same subject in a modern language, which&nbsp;in its own day and for centuries afterwards exercised an&nbsp;extraordinary influence throughout Europe. Benoît de&nbsp;Sainte-More, the Anglo-Norman trouvère who wrote in&nbsp;verse </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chroniques des Dues de Normandie,</span><span class="font1"> composed in&nbsp;England, under the eyes of Henry IL, about the year 1184&nbsp;a poem in 30,000 lines entitled </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Roman de Troie.</span><span class="font1"> It forms&nbsp;a true Trojan cycle and embraces the entire heroic history&nbsp;of Hellas. The introduction relates the story of the Argonauts, and the last 2680 verses are devoted to the return&nbsp;of the Greek chiefs and the wanderings of Ulysses. With&nbsp;no fear of chronological discrepancy before his eyes, Benoît&nbsp;reproduces the manners of his own times, and builds up a&nbsp;complete museum of the 12th century,—its arts, costumes,&nbsp;manufactures, architecture, arms, and even religious terms.&nbsp;Women are repeatedly introduced in unwarranted situations ; they are spectators of all combats. The idea of&nbsp;personal beauty is different from that of the old Greeks ;&nbsp;by Benoît good-humour, as well as health and strength,&nbsp;is held to be one of its chief characteristics. The love-pictures are another addition of the modern writer. We&nbsp;find traces of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Odyssey</span><span class="font1"> of Homer and the trilogy of&nbsp;Æschylus</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup> as well as of Ovid and Virgil. The author&nbsp;speaks enthusiastically of Homer, but his chief source of&nbsp;information was the pseudo-annals of Dictys and Dares,&nbsp;more especially the latter, augmented by his own imagination and the spirit of the age. It is to Benoît alone that&nbsp;the honour of poetic invention is due, and in spite of its&nbsp;obligation for a groundwork to Dictys and Dares we may&nbsp;justly consider the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Roman de Troie</span><span class="font1"> as an original work.&nbsp;From this source subsequent writers drew their notions of&nbsp;Troy, mostly without naming their authority and generally&nbsp;without even knowing his name. This is the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chef d'œuvre&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">of the pseudo-classical cycle of romances: it shows the&nbsp;most lofty conception, and in it poetical imagination has&nbsp;the freest and most lively play. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Roman de Troie</span><span class="font1"> was&nbsp;extremely popular. When Benoît, by reason of his lengthiness, failed to please, the Latin version of Guido revived&nbsp;general interest. The story passed through every country&nbsp;of Europe, first in verse and then as a prose fiction, and&nbsp;portions of it furnished matter for the genius of Boccaccio,&nbsp;Chaucer, and Shakespeare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The first work inspired by the success of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Roman de Troie</span><span class="font1"> was the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">De bello Trojaηo</span><span class="font1"> of Joseph of Exeter, in six&nbsp;books, a genuine poem of no little merit, written soon after&nbsp;Benoit’s work or about the years 1187-88. It was directly</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">@@@<sup>1</sup> The name of Homer never ceased to be held in honour ; but he is invariably placed in company with the Latin poets. Few of those&nbsp;who praised him had read him except in the Latin redaction in 1100&nbsp;verses which passed under the name of Pindar. It supplied the chief&nbsp;incidents of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Iliad</span><span class="font0"> with tolerable exactness and was taught in&nbsp;schools.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
