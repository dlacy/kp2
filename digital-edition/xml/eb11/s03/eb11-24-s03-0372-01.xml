According to the story, which is probably true, the name arose from a chance spectator’s exclamation “ there she scoons,” <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> glides, slips free, at the launch of the first vessel of this type at Gloucester, Massachusetts, in 1713, her builder being one Andrew Robinson. The spelling “ schooner ” is due to a supposed derivation from the Dutch <hi rend="italic">schooner,</hi> but that and the other European equivalents, Ger. <hi rend="italic">Schoner,</hi> Dan. <hi rend="italic">skonnert,</hi> Span. and Portuguese <hi rend="italic">escuna,</hi> &amp;amp;c., are all from English. “ To scoon,” according to Skeat, is a Scottish (Clydesdale) dialect word, meaning to skip over water like a flat stone, and is ultimately connected with the root, implying quick motion, seen in shoot, scud, &amp;amp;c. In American colloquial usage “ schooner ” is applied to the covered prairie-wagons used by the emigrants moving westward before the construction of railways, and to a tall, narrow, lager-beer glass.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
