<p><span class="font0">nominated one to ſucceed him, the law will paſs without oppoſition.” Having thus ſpoken, he diſmiſſed the aſſembly, after having ſummoned them to meet again&nbsp;the next day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">And now Gracchus, being ſoured with the oppoſition he had met with from the rich, and from his obſtinate&nbsp;colleague, and being well appriſed that the law would&nbsp;paſs in any form in which he ſhould think fit to propoſe it, reſolved to revive it as it was at firſt paſſed,&nbsp;without abating any thing of its ſeverity. There was&nbsp;no exception in favour of the children in families ; or&nbsp;reimburſement promiled to thoſe who ſhould part with&nbsp;the lands they poſſeſſed above </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ξoo</span><span class="font0"> acres. The next day&nbsp;the people being aſſembled in vaſt crowds on this extraordinary occaſion, Gracchus made freſh applications&nbsp;io Octavius, but to no purpoſe; he obſtinately perſiſted&nbsp;in his oppoſition. Then Gracchus turning to the people,&nbsp;“ Judge you, (ſaid he), which of.us deſerves to be deprived of his office.” At theſe words the firſt tribe&nbsp;voted, and declared ſor the depoſition of Octavius. Upon which Gracchus, iulpending the ardour of the tribes,&nbsp;made another effort to bring over his opponent by gentle&nbsp;methods. But all his endeavours proving ineffectual,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">the other tribes went on to vote in their turns, and followed the example of the firſt. Of 35 tribes, 17 had already declared againſt Octavius, and the 18∙th was juſt&nbsp;going to determine the affair, when Gracchus, being&nbsp;willing to try once more whether he could reclaim his&nbsp;colleague, ſuſpended the collecting of the ſuffrages; and&nbsp;addreſſing Octavius in the moſt preſſing terms, conjured&nbsp;him not to expoſe himſelf, by his obſtinacy, to ſo great&nbsp;a diſgrace, nor to give him the grief of having caſt a&nbsp;blennſh upon his colleague and friend, which neither&nbsp;time nor merit would ever wipe off. Octavius, however, continuing obſtinate, was depoſed, and the law&nbsp;paſſed as Gracchus had propoſed it the laſt time.&nbsp;The depoſed tribune was dragged from the roſtra by&nbsp;the incenſed multitude, who would have inſulted him&nbsp;further, had not the ſenators and his friends facilitated&nbsp;his eſcape.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Licinian law being thus revived with one conſent both by the city and country tribes, Gracchus cauſed the people to appoint triumvirs, or three com-miſſioners, to haften its execution. In this commiſſion&nbsp;the people gave Gracchus the firſt place ; and he had&nbsp;intereſt enough to get his father-in-law Appius Claudius, and his brother Caius Gracchus, appointed his&nbsp;colleagues. Theſe three ſpent the whole ſummer in&nbsp;- travelling through all the Italian provinces, to examine&nbsp;•what lands were held by any perſon above 500 acres, in&nbsp;order to divide them among the poor citizens. When&nbsp;Gracchus returned from his progreſs, he found, by the&nbsp;death of his chief agent, that his abſence had not abated either the hatred of the rich, or the love of the poor,&nbsp;toward him. As it plainly appeared that the deceaſed&nbsp;had been poiſoned, the tribune took this occaſion to&nbsp;apply himſelf again to his protectors, and implore their&nbsp;aſſiſtance againſt the violence and treachery of his-ene-mies. The populace, more attached after this accident&nbsp;to their hero than ever, declared they would ſtand by&nbsp;him to the laſt drop of their blood ; and this their zeal&nbsp;encouraged him to add a new clauſe to the law, viz.&nbsp;that the commiſſioners ſhould likewiſe inquire what&nbsp;lands had been uſurped from the republic. This was&nbsp;touching the ſenators in a moſt tender point ; for moſt</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">of them had appropriated to themſelves lands belonging to the republic. But after all, the tribune, upon a ſtrict&nbsp;inquiry, found that the lands taken from the rich would&nbsp;not be enough to content all the poor citizens. But&nbsp;the following accident eaſed him of this difficulty, and&nbsp;enabled him to ſtop the murmurs of the malcontents ,&nbsp;among the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Attalus Philometer, king of Pergamus, having bequeathed his dominions and effects to the Romans, Eudemus the Pergamean brought his treaſures to Rome at this time ; and Gracchus immediately got a new law&nbsp;paſſed, enacting, that this money ſhould be divided&nbsp;among the poor citizens who could not have lands ;&nbsp;and chat the diſpoſal of the revenues of Pergamus&nbsp;ſhould not be in the ſenate, but in the comitia. By&nbsp;theſe ſteps Gracchus moſt effectually humbled the ſenate; who, in order to diſcredit him among the people,&nbsp;gave out that Eudemus, who had brought the king’s&nbsp;will to Rome, had leſt with Gracchus the royal diadem&nbsp;and mantle of Attalus, which the law-making tribune&nbsp;was to uſe wher*he ſhould be proclaimed king of Rome.&nbsp;But theſe reports only ſerved to make Gracchus be&nbsp;more upon his guard, and to inſpire the people with&nbsp;an implacable hatred againſt the rich who were the&nbsp;authors of them. Gracchus being now, by his power-over the minds of the multitude, abſolute mälter of their&nbsp;ſuffrages, formed a deſign of raiſing his father-in-law&nbsp;Appius Claudius to the conſulate next year, of promoting his brother Caius to the tribuneſhip, and getting&nbsp;himſelf continued in the ſame office. The laſt was&nbsp;what moſt nearly concerned him ; his perſon, as long&nbsp;as he was in office; being ſacred and inviolable. As&nbsp;the ſenate was very active in endeavouring to get ſuch&nbsp;only elected into the college of tribunes as were enemies&nbsp;to Gracchus and his faction, the tribune left no ſtone&nbsp;unturned to ſecure his election. He told the people,&nbsp;that the rich had reſolved to aſſaſſinate him as ſoon as&nbsp;he was out of his office ; he appeared in mourning, as&nbsp;was the cuſtom in the greateſt calamities ; and bringing&nbsp;his children, yet young, into the forum, recommended&nbsp;them to the people in ſuch terms, as ſhowed that he&nbsp;deſpaired of his own preſervation. At this fight the&nbsp;populace returned no anſwer, but by outcries and menaces againſt the rich.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When the day appointed for the election of new tribunes came, the people were ordered to aſſemble in&nbsp;the capitol in the great court before the'temple of Jupiter. The tribes being met, Gracchus produced his&nbsp;petition, intreating the people to continue him one year&nbsp;longer in the office of tribune, in conſideration of the·&nbsp;great danger to which he was expoſed, the rich having&nbsp;vowed his deſtruction as ſoon as his perſon ſhould be no-more ſacred. This was indeed an unuſual requeſt, it&nbsp;having been long cuſtomary not to continue any tribune&nbsp;in his office above a year. However, the tribes began·&nbsp;to vote, and the two firſt declared for Gracchus. Hereupon the rich made great clamours ; which terrified&nbsp;Rubrius Varro, who preſided in the college of tribunes&nbsp;that day, to ſuch a degree, that he reſigned his place to&nbsp;Q. Mummius, who offered to preſide in. his room. But&nbsp;this raiſed a tumult among the tribunes themſelves ; ſo-that Gracchus wiſely diſmiſſed the aſſembly, and order·*&nbsp;ed them to meet again the next day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the mean time the people, being ſenſible of what importance it was to them to preſerve the life of fo</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
