or <hi rend="smallcaps">Scheichs</hi>, is a name which is applied by the Arabs to their nobles. “ Among the Bedouins,” says Niebuhr, “ it belongs to every noble, whether of the highest or the lowest order. Their nobles are very numerous, and compose in a manner the whole nation ; the plebeians are invariably actuated and guided by the schiechs, who superintend and direct in every transaction. The schiechs and their subjects are bom to the life of shepherds and soldiers. The greater tribes rear many camels, which they either sell to their neighbours, or employ them in the carriage of goods, or in military expeditions. The petty tribes keep flocks of sheep. Among those tribes which apply to agriculture, the schiechs live always in tents, and leave the culture of their grounds to their subjects, whose dwellings are wretched huts. Schiechs always ride on horses or dromedaries, inspecting the conduct of their subjects, visiting their friends, or hunting. Traversing the desert, where the horizon is wide as on the ocean, they perceive travellers at a distance. As travellers are seldom to be met with on those wild tracts, they easily discover such as pass that way, and are tempted to pillage them when they find their own party the strongest.” «</p></div></body></text></TEI>
