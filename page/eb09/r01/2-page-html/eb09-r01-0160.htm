<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Reicha first visited Paris in 1799. In 1802 he removed to Vienna, where he spent some happy years in close&nbsp;intercourse with Beethoven, and the veteran Haydn. His&nbsp;permanent settlement at Paris took place in 1808. In&nbsp;1817 he succeeded Mehul as professor of counterpoint at&nbsp;the Conservatoire. In 1831 he was made a knight of the&nbsp;Legion of Honour; and in 1835 he was admitted as a&nbsp;member of the Institute in the place of Boieldieu. He&nbsp;died at Paris, May 28, 1836.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">REICHENAU, a picturesque island in the Untersee or western arm of the lake of Constance, is 3 miles in length&nbsp;by 1 in breadth, and is connected with the east bank by a&nbsp;causeway three quarters of a mile long. It belongs to the&nbsp;duchy of Baden, and comprises the three parishes of Ober-zell, Mittelzell, and Unterzell, with a joint population of&nbsp;1463 in 1880. The soil is very fertile, and excellent wine&nbsp;is produced in sufficient quantity for exportation. The&nbsp;Benedictine abbey of Reichenau, founded in 724, was long&nbsp;celebrated for its wealth and for the services rendered by&nbsp;its monks to the cause of learning. In 1538 the abbey,&nbsp;which had previously been independent, was subordinated&nbsp;to the see of Constance, and in 1799 it was secularized.&nbsp;The abbey church, dating in part from the 9th century,&nbsp;contains the tomb of Charles the Fat, who retired to this&nbsp;island in 887, after losing the empire of Charlemagne.&nbsp;It now serves as the parish church of Mittelzell, and the&nbsp;churches of Oberzell and Unterzell are also interesting&nbsp;buildings of the Carlovingian era.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">REICHENBACH, a manufacturing town of Saxony, in the province of Zwickau, lies in the hilly district known as&nbsp;the Voigtland, 50 miles to the south of Leipsic. The chief&nbsp;industrial products are woollen cloth, merino, cashmere,&nbsp;flannel, and shawls. Its importance is of recent origin,&nbsp;and the population, amounting to 16,509 in 1880, has&nbsp;trebled itself within the last fifty years. The earliest&nbsp;notice of the town occurs in a document of 1212, and it&nbsp;acquired municipal rights in 1367.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">REICHENBACH, a cotton-manufacturing town of Prussian Silesia, with 7225 inhabitants (1880) and an old castle, lies 30 miles to the south-south-west of Breslau, and&nbsp;demands mention chiefly from its connexion with several&nbsp;important historical events. In 1762 Frederick the Great&nbsp;gained a victory here over the Austrians; by the Reichen-bach convention of 1790 England and the other powers&nbsp;guaranteed the subsistence of the Turkish empire; and&nbsp;in 1813 a treaty, afterwards ratified at Prague, was concluded here between Austria and the allies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">REICHENBACH, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Georg von </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(1772-1826), astronomical instrument maker, was born at Durlach in Baden on August 24, 1772. He first served as an officer of&nbsp;artillery, and afterwards held several civil appointments&nbsp;in Bavaria. Already from 1796 he was occupied with&nbsp;the construction of a dividing engine; in 1804 he&nbsp;founded, with Liebherr and Utzschneider, an instrumentmaking business in Munich; and in 1809 he established,&nbsp;with Fraunhofer and Utzschneider, equally important&nbsp;optical works at Benedictbeuern, which were moved to&nbsp;Munich in 1823. He withdrew from both enterprises in&nbsp;1814, and founded with Ertel a new optical business, from&nbsp;which also he retired in 1820. He died at Munich on&nbsp;May 21, 1826.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Reichenbach’s principal merit is his having introduced into observatories the meridian or transit circle, combining the transit&nbsp;instrument and the mural circle into one instrument. This had&nbsp;already been done by Roemer about 1704, but the idea had not&nbsp;been adopted by any one else, the only exception being the transit&nbsp;circle constructed by Troughton for Groombridge in 1806. The&nbsp;transit circle in the form given it by Reichenbach had one finely-divided circle attached to one end of the horizontal axis and read</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">by four verniers on an “Alhidade Circle,” the unaltered position of which was tested by a spirit level. The instrument came almost&nbsp;at once into universal use on the Continent (the first one was made&nbsp;for Bessel in 1819), but in England the mural circle and transit&nbsp;instrument were not superseded for many years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">REICHENBERG (Bohem. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Liberec),</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> a town of Bohemia, with an independent jurisdiction, lies on the Neisse, about&nbsp;50 miles to the north-east of Prague and not far from&nbsp;the Saxon and Prussian frontiers. It is the centre of the&nbsp;important cloth manufacture of northern Bohemia, and is&nbsp;the third town of Bohemia in size and the second in&nbsp;industrial importance. Its cloth factories employ about&nbsp;7000 workpeople and produce goods to the annual value&nbsp;of upwards of a million sterling, while weaving is also&nbsp;extensively prosecuted as a domestic industry. Other&nbsp;important manufactures are cotton, yarn, machinery, and&nbsp;liqueur. Trade is carried on in the raw materials and&nbsp;finished products of the various industries. The most&nbsp;prominent buildings are the town-house, of 1601; the&nbsp;chateau of Count Clam Gallas; the Dekanalkirche, of&nbsp;the 16th century; the Protestant church, a handsome&nbsp;modern Romanesque edifice; the hall of the cloth-workers ;&nbsp;the new law courts; the new theatre; and the weaving&nbsp;school. The population in 1880 was 28,090.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Reichenberg is first mentioned in a document of 1348, and from 1622 to 1634 was among the possessions of the great Wallenstein,&nbsp;since whose death it has belonged to the Gallas and Clam Gallas&nbsp;families. The woollen industry was introduced about the middle&nbsp;of the 16th century. In 1866 Reichenberg was the headquarters&nbsp;of Prince Charles Frederick of Prussia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">REICHENHALL, a small town and watering-place of Upper Bavaria, is finely situated in an amphitheatre of&nbsp;lofty mountains, on the river Saale or Saalach, 1570 feet&nbsp;above the level of the sea and 9 miles to the south-west of&nbsp;Salzburg. As indicated by its name, in which the syllable&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">hall</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> corresponds, according to a well-known linguistic&nbsp;law, to the Latin </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sal,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> Reichenhall possesses several copious&nbsp;saline springs, producing upwards of 11,500 tons of salt&nbsp;per annum. The water of some of the springs, the sources&nbsp;of which are 50 feet below the surface of the soil, is so&nbsp;strongly saturated with salt (up to 24 per cent.) that it is&nbsp;at once conducted to the boiling houses, while that of the&nbsp;others is first submitted to a process of evaporation.&nbsp;Reichenhall is the centre of the four chief Bavarian saltworks, which are connected with each other by brine conduits having an aggregate length of 60 miles. The surplus&nbsp;brine of Berchtesgaden is conducted to Reichenhall, and&nbsp;thence, in increased volume, to Traunstein and Rosenheim,&nbsp;which possess larger supplies of timber for use as fuel in&nbsp;the process of boiling. Since 1846 Reichenhall has&nbsp;become one of the most fashionable spas in Germany, and&nbsp;it is now visited annually by about five thousand patients,&nbsp;besides many thousand passing tourists. The resident&nbsp;population in 1880 was 3271, almost all Roman Catholics.&nbsp;The saline springs are used both for drinking and bathing,&nbsp;and are said to be efficacious in scrofula and incipient&nbsp;tuberculosis. In addition to numerous large hotels, the&nbsp;most prominent edifices are the Romanesque church,&nbsp;recently restored, and the handsome and extensive buildings of the salt-works.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The brine springs of Reichenhall are mentioned in a document of the 8th century, and were perhaps known to the Romans ; but&nbsp;almost all trace of the antiquity of the town was destroyed by a&nbsp;conflagration in 1834. The brine conduit to Traunstein dates&nbsp;from 1618. The environs abound in numerous charming Alpine&nbsp;excursions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">REICHSTADT, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Duke of. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">See </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Napoleon </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">II. (vol. xvii. p. 226). The title is derived from the little towu of&nbsp;Reichstadt in northern Bohemia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">REID, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Mayne </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(1818-1883), captain in the United States army, was in his generation one of the most popular&nbsp;of writers of stories of adventure.
