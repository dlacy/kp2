<p><span class="font0">reality it is older than 1532, and may be the direct subject of Bordigné’s allusion six years earlier. What does, however, seem probable is that the first book of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pantagruel&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(the second of the whole work) was composed with a&nbsp;definite view to this chap book and not to the existing&nbsp;first book of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Gargantua,</span><span class="font0"> which was written afterwards&nbsp;when Rabelais discovered the popularity of his work and&nbsp;felt that it ought to have some worthier starting-point than&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Grandes Chroniques.</span><span class="font0"> The earliest known and dated&nbsp;edition of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pantagruel</span><span class="font0"> is of 1533, of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Gargantua</span><span class="font0"> 1535,&nbsp;though this would not be of itself conclusive, especially as&nbsp;we actually possess editions of both which, though undated, seem to be earlier. But the definite description of&nbsp;Gargantua in the title as “ Père de Pantagruel,” the omission of the words “ second livre ” in the title of the first&nbsp;book of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pantagruel</span><span class="font0"> while the second and third are duly&nbsp;entitled “tiers” and “quart,” the remarkable fact that&nbsp;one of the most important personages, Friar John, is absent&nbsp;from book ii., the first of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pantagruel,</span><span class="font0"> though he appears&nbsp;in book i. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Gargantua),</span><span class="font0"> and many other proofs show the&nbsp;order of publication clearly enough. There is also in&nbsp;existence a letter of Calvin, dated 1533, in which he speaks&nbsp;of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pantagruel,</span><span class="font0"> but not of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Gargantua,</span><span class="font0"> as having been&nbsp;condemned as an obscene book. Besides this, 1533 saw the&nbsp;publication of an almanac, the first of a long series which&nbsp;exists only in titles and fragments, and of the amusing&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Prognostication Pantagrueline</span><span class="font0"> (still, be it observed, Panta-grueline, not Gargantuine). Both this and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pantagruel&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">itself were published under the anagrammatic pseudonym&nbsp;of “Alcofribas Nasier,” shortened to the first word only&nbsp;in the case of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Prognostication.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This busy and interesting period of Rabelais’s life was brought to a close apparently by his introduction or réintroduction to Jean du Bellay. They had been, it has been&nbsp;said, schoolfellows, but Bellay does not appear among the&nbsp;list of Rabelais’s friends in the first years of his emancipation. From 1534, however, he and the other members of&nbsp;his family appear as Rabelais’s chief and constant patrons&nbsp;during the remainder of his life. It was just before Christmas that Jean du Bellay, passing through Lyons on an&nbsp;embassy to Rome, engaged Rabelais as physician. The&nbsp;visit did not last very long, but it left literary results in&nbsp;an edition of a description of Rome by Marliani, which&nbsp;Rabelais published in September 1534. It is also thought&nbsp;that the first edition of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Gargantua</span><span class="font0"> may have appeared&nbsp;this year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the spring <sup>-</sup>of 1535 the authorities of the Lyons hospital, considering that Rabelais had twice absented&nbsp;himself without leave, elected Pierre de Castel in his&nbsp;room ; but the documents which exist do not seem to&nbsp;infer that any blame was thought due to him, and the&nbsp;appointment of his successor was once definitely postponed&nbsp;in case he should return. An epigram of Dolet shows&nbsp;that at least once and probably about this time he performed a public dissection. At the end of 1535 Rabelais&nbsp;once more accompanied Jean du Bellay, now a cardinal,&nbsp;to Rome and stayed there till April in the next year. This&nbsp;stay furnishes some biographical documents of importance&nbsp;in the shape of letters to Geoffroy d’Estissac, of the already-mentioned </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Supplicatio pro Apostasia,</span><span class="font0"> and of the bull of&nbsp;absolution which was the reply to it. This bull not only&nbsp;freed Rabelais from ecclesiastical censure but gave him the&nbsp;right to return to the order of St Benedict when he chose,&nbsp;and to practise medicine. He took advantage of this bull&nbsp;and became a canon of St Maur. The monastery having&nbsp;but recently become collegiate, there seems to have been&nbsp;some technical difficulty which necessitated a new supplication. In the next year (1537) we find Rabelais present&nbsp;at a dinner where the friends of Étienne Dolet met to&nbsp;congratulate him on his pardon for the homicide of</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Compaing. The luckless printer has left a poem on the occasion, and two other writers, Salmon Macrin and&nbsp;Nicholas Bourbon, have also left poems of this date expressing the regard in which Rabelais was generally held.&nbsp;Now, too, he took his doctor’s degree at Montpellier,&nbsp;lectured on the Greek text of Hippocrates, and next year&nbsp;made a public anatomical demonstration. During these&nbsp;two years he seems to have resided either at Montpellier&nbsp;or at Lyons. But in 1539 he entered the service of&nbsp;Guillaume du Bellay-Langey, elder brother of Jean, and&nbsp;would appear to have been with him (he was governor of&nbsp;Piedmont) till his death on 9th January 1543. Rabelais&nbsp;wrote a panegyrical memoir of Guillaume, which is lost,&nbsp;and the year before saw the publication of an edition of&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Gargantua</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pantagruel,</span><span class="font0"> book i., together (both had&nbsp;been repeatedly reprinted separately), in which some&nbsp;dangerous expressions were cut away. Nothing at all is&nbsp;known of his life, whereabouts, or occupations till the&nbsp;publication of the third book, which appeared in 1546,&nbsp;“ avec privilège du roi,” which had been given in September 1545.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Up to this time Rabelais, despite the condemnation of the Sorbonne referred to above, had experienced nothing&nbsp;like persecution or difficulty. Even the spiteful or treacherous act of Dolet, who in 1542 reprinted the earlier form&nbsp;of the books which Rabelais had just slightly modified,&nbsp;seems to have done him no harm. But the storm of persecution which towards the end of the reign of Francis I. was&nbsp;fatal to Dolet himself and to Despériers, while it exiled&nbsp;and virtually killed Marot, did not leave Rabelais scatheless.&nbsp;There is no positive evidence of any measures taken or&nbsp;threatened against him ; but it is certain that he passed&nbsp;nearly the whole of 1546 and part of 1547 at Metz in&nbsp;Lorraine as physician to the town at the salary of 120&nbsp;livres, that Sturm speaks of him as having been “cast&nbsp;out of France by the times ” (with the exclamation </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">φευ των&nbsp;χρόνων)</span><span class="font0"> in a contemporary letter, and that he himself in a&nbsp;letter, also contemporary, though it is not clear whether it&nbsp;is of 1546 or the next year, gives a doleful account of his&nbsp;pecuniary affairs and asks for assistance. At Francis’s&nbsp;death on 31st March 1547 Du Bellay went to Rome, and&nbsp;at some time not certain Rabelais joined him. He was&nbsp;certainly there in February 1549, when he dates from Du&nbsp;Bellay’s palace a little account of the festivals given at&nbsp;Rome to celebrate the birth of the second son of Henry II.&nbsp;and Catherine de’ Medici. This account, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sciomachie&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">as it is called, is extant. In the same year a monk of&nbsp;Fontevrault, Gabriel du Puits-Herbault, made in a book&nbsp;called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Theotimus</span><span class="font0"> the first of the many attacks on Rabelais.&nbsp;It is, however, as vague as it is violent, and it does not&nbsp;seem to have had any effect. Rabelais had indeed again&nbsp;made for himself protectors whom no clerical or Sorbonist&nbsp;jealousy could touch. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sciomachie</span><span class="font0"> was written to the&nbsp;cardinal of Guise, whose family were all-powerful at court,&nbsp;and Rabelais dedicated his next book to Odet de Chatillon,&nbsp;afterwards cardinal, a man of great influence. Thus Rabelais&nbsp;was able to return to France, and was presented to the&nbsp;livings of Meudon and St Christophe de Jambet. It may,&nbsp;however, surprise those who have been accustomed to hear&nbsp;him spoken of as “ curé de Meudon ” and who have read&nbsp;lives of him founded on legend to find that there is very&nbsp;little ground for believing that he ever officiated or resided&nbsp;there. He certainly held the living but two years, resigning it in January 1552 along with his other benefice, and&nbsp;it is noteworthy that at the episcopal visitation of 1551&nbsp;he was not present. To this supposed residence at Meudon&nbsp;and to the previous stay at Rome, however, are attached&nbsp;two of the most mischievous items of the legend, though&nbsp;fortunately two of the most easily refutable. It is said that&nbsp;Rabelais met and quarrelled with Joachim du Bellay the</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
