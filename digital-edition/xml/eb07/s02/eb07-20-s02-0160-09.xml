known formerly by the Turkish name Achtiar, an important naval arsenal and city belonging to Russia, in the peninsula of the Crimea. It is situated at the south-west point, has an extensive and commodious port, and its depth renders it secure at all seasons and during all winds. By a decree of 1804, it was declared that Sevastopol was to be considered thereafter as a port exclusively for the use of the imperial navy ; merchant-ships are therefore not admitted, unless forced in by stress of weather, or when requiring repairs from accidents. The fortifications do not surround the city, but it is defended by six strong batteries towards the sea, and has commonly a garrison of 4000 men.</p><p>The fleet, whose head-quarters is at this place, consisted in 1793 of eight ships of the line and twelve frigates and smaller vessels; in the year 1817 it had reached twelve ships of the line, carrying 918 guns, four frigates with 164 guns, seventeen brigs, and eighteen smaller vessels ; in 1823 it consisted of fourteen ships of the line, ten frigates, and a number of small craft ; and in 1838 it had been augmented to sixteen ships of the line, with a large number of frigates, gun-boats, &amp;c.</p><p>The city has the appearance of an amphitheatre on the south side of the port : its white walls and gaudy domes, rising amid green trees, give it a peculiarly lively look. The streets are wide and regular, and intersect each other at right angles, but none of them have any pavement. The houses have of late been increasing in number, and are built in the modern style of Italian architecture. A public garden, with terraces rising one above the other, has been lately formed upon a rising elevation in the middle of the town, and has a very pleasing effect.</p><p>The place is well supplied with the necessaries, and even the luxuries, of life ; but good water is not abundant, and fuel is scarce. The population, ten years ago, amounted to 22,000 persons; not more than one tenth were civil inhabitants. Since that period, with the increase of the marine, the numbers have probably been augmented. The lazaretto is situated in long. 33. 29. E. and lat. 44. 35. N.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
