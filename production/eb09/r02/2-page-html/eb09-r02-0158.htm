But before Robert had reached the capital he was summoned&nbsp;back by Gregory VII., his suzerain, to rescue him from&nbsp;the emperor Henry IV., by whom he was being besieged&nbsp;in Rome. After capturing and sacking the city in May&nbsp;1084 and conducting Gregory to a place of safety in&nbsp;Salerno, Guiscard resumed his operations against Alexius,&nbsp;defeating the united Greek and Venetian fleets, and raising&nbsp;the siege of Corfu in November 1084. While still engaged&nbsp;in active warfare he died of pestilence at Cephalonia on&nbsp;17th July 1085. He was succeeded in the dukedom by&nbsp;his younger son Roger Bursa, whose son William died&nbsp;without issue in 1127. Guiscard’s eldest son was Marc&nbsp;Bohemond </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ROBERTS, David (1796-1864), landscape painter, was born at Stockbridge, Edinburgh, on 24th October 1796.&nbsp;At an early age he manifested a great love for art ; but&nbsp;his father, a shoemaker, wished him to follow the same&nbsp;trade. He was, however, apprenticed for seven years to&nbsp;a painter and house-decorator; and during this time he&nbsp;employed his evenings in the earnest study of art. For&nbsp;the next few years his time was divided between work&nbsp;as a house-painter and as a scene-painter, and he even&nbsp;appeared occasionally on the boards as an actor in pantomimes. In 1820 he formed the acquaintance of Clarkson&nbsp;Stanfield, then painting at the Pantheon, Edinburgh, by&nbsp;whose advice and example he greatly profited and at whose&nbsp;suggestion he began his career as an exhibitor, sending three&nbsp;pictures in 1822 to the “Exhibition of Works by Living&nbsp;Artists,” held in Edinburgh. In the same year he removed&nbsp;to London, where he worked for the Coburg Theatre, and&nbsp;was afterwards employed, along with Stanfield, at Drury&nbsp;Lane. In 1824 he exhibited at the British Institution a&nbsp;view of Dryburgh Abbey, and sent two works to the first&nbsp;exhibition of the Society of British Artists, which he had&nbsp;joined, and of which he was elected president in 1831.&nbsp;In the same autumn he visited Normandy, and the works&nbsp;which were the results of this excursion began to lay the&nbsp;foundation of the artist’s reputation,—one of them, a view&nbsp;of Rouen Cathedral, being sold for eighty guineas. By&nbsp;his scenes for an opera entitled </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Seraglio,</span><span class="font2"> executed&nbsp;two years later, he won much contemporary praise, and&nbsp;these, along with the scenery for a pantomime dealing with&nbsp;the naval victory of Navarino, and two panoramas executed&nbsp;jointly by him and Stanfield, were among his last work for&nbsp;the theatres. In 1829 he exhibited his imposing subject&nbsp;the Departure of the Israelites from Egypt, a commission&nbsp;from Lord North wick, in which the style of the painter&nbsp;first becomes clearly apparent ; and three years afterwards&nbsp;he travelled in Spain, and passed over to Tangiers, returning in the end of 1833 with a supply of effective sketches,&nbsp;which were speedily elaborated into attractive and popular&nbsp;paintings. His Interior of Seville Cathedral was exhibited&nbsp;in the British Institution in 1834, and sold for £300 ; and&nbsp;he executed a fine series of Spanish illustrations for the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Landscape Annual</span><span class="font2"> of 1836, a publication to which he contributed for four years; while in 1837 a selection of his&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Picturesque Sketches in Spain</span><span class="font2"> was reproduced by lithography, many of the subjects being carefully retouched&nbsp;on. the stone by the artist’s own hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In 1838 Roberts made a long tour in the East, sailing up the Nile, visiting Luxor and Karnak, and afterwards&nbsp;making his way to the Holy Land. He thus accumulated&nbsp;a vast collection of sketches of a class of scenery which&nbsp;had hitherto been hardly touched by British artists, and&nbsp;which appealed to the public with all the charm of novelty.&nbsp;The next ten years of his life were mainly spent in elaborating these materials. Many Eastern subjects were painted,&nbsp;and an extensive series of drawings was lithographed by&nbsp;Louis Haghe in the superb work, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sketches in the Holy</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Land and Syria,</span><span class="font2"> 1842-49. In 1851, and again in 1853, Roberts visited Italy, painting the Ducal Palace, Venice,&nbsp;bought by Lord Londesborough, the interior of the Basilica of St Peter’s, Rome, Christmas Day, 1853, and Rome&nbsp;from the Convent of St Onofrio, presented to the Royal&nbsp;Scottish Academy. His last volume of illustrations, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Italy,&nbsp;Classical, Historical, and Picturesque,</span><span class="font2"> was published in&nbsp;1859. He also executed, by command of the queen, a&nbsp;picture of the opening of the Great Exhibition of 1851,—&nbsp;a laborious and rather uncongenial task. In 1839 he was&nbsp;elected an associate, and in 1841 a full member of the&nbsp;Royal Academy; and in 1858 he was presented with the&nbsp;freedom of the city of Edinburgh. The last years of his&nbsp;life were occupied with a series of views of London from&nbsp;the Thames. He had executed six of these and was at&nbsp;work upon a picture of St Paul’s Cathedral, when on 25th&nbsp;November 1864 he was seized with an attack of apoplexy&nbsp;and expired the same evening.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The quality of Roberts’s work is exceedingly equal and uniform during his whole career. The architecture, which is so prominent&nbsp;a feature in his paintings, is introduced with great picturesqueness&nbsp;and an easy command of its salient points, but with little care for&nbsp;the minutiæ of detail. His art was conventional, essentially scenic&nbsp;and spectacular in character, showing effective composition and an&nbsp;unerring instinct for broad general effect, but destitute of that close&nbsp;adherence to nature, that delicacy and truth of tone and colour,&nbsp;which are becoming increasingly characteristic of the productions&nbsp;of the English school. Something of the scene-painter appears in&nbsp;all his works, and his certainty and speed of execution were undoubtedly founded upon his early practice for the stage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font0"> of Roberts, compiled from his journals and other sources by James Ballantine, with etchings and pen-and-ink sketches by the artist, appeared in&nbsp;Edinburgh in 1S66.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ROBERTSON, Frederick William (1816-1853), one of the most brilliant and influential preachers of modern&nbsp;times, was born in London, on 3d February 1816. The&nbsp;first five years of his life were passed at Leith Fort, where&nbsp;his father, a captain in the Royal Artillery, was then resident. The impressions made upon the child in those early&nbsp;years were never effaced ; the military spirit entered into&nbsp;his blood, and throughout life he was characterized by the&nbsp;qualities of the ideal soldier,—courage, self-devotion, sense&nbsp;of duty, hatred of cruelty and meanness, chivalrous defence&nbsp;of the weak. In 1821 Captain Robertson retired to&nbsp;Beverley, where the boy was educated first at home, then&nbsp;at the grammar-school. At the age of fourteen he spent&nbsp;a year at Tours, from which he returned to Scotland and&nbsp;continued his education at the Edinburgh Academy and&nbsp;university. His father, who had remarked and fostered&nbsp;his singular nobility of character, his passion for purity&nbsp;and truthfulness, and his deepening religious feeling, noλv&nbsp;proposed that he should choose the church as his profession, but received the decisive answer, “Anything but&nbsp;that ; I am not fit for it.” At the age of eighteen he was&nbsp;accordingly articled to a solicitor in Bury St Edmunds,&nbsp;but the uncongenial and sedentary employment broke down&nbsp;his health in a year’s time. It was then resolved to yield&nbsp;to his deep-rooted craving for a military career : his name&nbsp;was placed upon the list of the 3d Dragoons then serving&nbsp;in India, and for two years he devoted himself with ardour&nbsp;to the work of preparing for the army. But, by a singular&nbsp;conjuncture of circumstances and at the sacrifice of his own&nbsp;natural bent to his father’s wish, he matriculated at Braze-nose College, Oxford, just two weeks before his commission was put into his hands. Oxford he did not find&nbsp;wholly congenial to his intensely earnest spirit, but he&nbsp;read hard, and, as he afterwards said, “ Plato, Aristotle,&nbsp;Butler, Thucydides, Sterne, Jonathan Edwards, passed like&nbsp;the iron atoms of the blood into my mental constitution.”&nbsp;At the same time he made a careful study of the Bible,&nbsp;committing to memory the entire New Testament both in&nbsp;English and in Greek. The Tractarian movement had&nbsp;no attraction for him, although he admired some of its</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
