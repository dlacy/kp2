Hence has ariſen an opinion that the iſland of Sicily was originally joined to the continent, but afterwards ſeparated by an earthquake or ſome other natural cauſe. This ſeparation, however, is reckoned by the moſt judicious among the ancients to be fabulous ; and they content themſelves with ſpeaking of it as a thing ſaid to have happened.</p><p>Anciently this iſland was called <hi rend="italic">Sicania, Sicilia,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Trinacria</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Triquetra;</hi> the two former it had from the Sicani and Siculi, who peopled a conſiderable part of the country ; the two latter from its triangular figure. Its firſt inhabitants, according to the moſt reſpectable ancient authors, were the Cyclopes and Laeſtrigones, who are ſaid to have ſettled in the countries adjoining to Mount Etna ; but of their origin we know nothing, except what is related by the poets. After them came the Sicani, who called themſelves the original inhabitants of the country ; but ſeveral ancient hiſtorians inform us that they came from a country in Spain watered by the river Siconus. Diodorus, however, is of opinion, that the Sicani were the moſt ancient inhabitants of this iſland. He tells us that they were in poſſeſſion of the whole, and applied themſelves to cultivate and improve the ground in the neighbourhood of Etna, which was the moſt fruitful part of the iſland : they built ſeveral ſmall towns and villages on the hills to ſecure themſelves againſt thieves and robbers ; and were governed, not by one prince, but each city and diſtrict by its own king. Thus they lived till Etna began to throw out flames, and forced them to retire to the weitern parts of the iſland, which they continued to inhabit in the time of Thucydides. Some Trojans, after the deſtruction of their city, landed in the iſland, ſettled among the Sicani, and built the cities of Eryx and Egesta, uniting themſelves with them, and taking the general name of Elymi or Elymæi. They were afterwards joined by ſome Phocenſes, who ſettled here on their return from the ſiege of Γroy.</p><p>After the Sicani had for many ages enjoyed an undiſturbed poſſeſſion of the whole of Sicily, or ſuch parts of it as they choſe to inhabit, they were viſited by the Siculi, who were the ancient inhabitants of Auſonia properly ſo called ; but being driven out from thence by the Opici, they took refuge in the iſland of Sicily. Not being contented with the narrow bounds allowed them by the Sicani, they began to encroach upon their neighbours ; upon which a war enſuing, the Sicani were utterly defeated, and confined to a corner of the iſland, the name of which was now changed from <hi rend="italic">Sicania</hi> into that of <hi rend="italic">Sicilia.</hi></p><p>About 300 years after the arrival of the Siculi, the iſland firſt began to be known to the Greeks, who eſtabliſhed various colonies, and built many cities in different parts of the iſland ; and it is only from the time of their arrival that we have any hiſtory of the iſland. The firſt of the Greeks that came into Sicily were the Chalcidians of Eubœa, under the conduct of Thucles, who built Naxus, and a famous altar of Apollo, which, as Thucydides tells us, was ſtill ſtanding in his time without the city. The year after, which was, according to Dionyſius Halicarnaſſenſis, the third of the 17th Olympiad, Archias the Corinthian, one of the Hera</p><p>clidae, laid the foundations of Syracuſe. Seven years after, a new colony of Chalcidians founded Leontini and Catana, after having driven out the Siculi, who inhabited that tract. About the ſame time Lamis, with a colony from Megara, a city of Achaia, ſettled on the river Pantacius, at a place called <hi rend="italic">Trotilum,</hi> where his adventurers lived ſome time in common with the Chalcidians of Leontini ; but, being driven from thence by the Leontines, he built the city of Thapſus, where he died. Upon his death, the colony left Thapſus ; and under the conduct of Hyblon king of the Siculi, founded Megara Hyblæa, where they reſided 245 years, till they were driven out by Gelon tyrant of Syracuſe. During their abode at Megara, they ſent one Pamilus, who was come from Megara in Achaia, their original city, to build Selinus. This city was founded about 100 years after the foundation of Megara. Antiphemua and Entimus, the former a Rhodian, the other a Cretan, led each a colony of their countrymen, and jointly built the city of Gela on a river of the ſame name, eſtabliſhing in their new ſettlement the Doric cuſtoms, about 45 years after the founding of Syracuſe. The inhabitants of Gela founded Agrigentum 108 years after their arrival in Sicily, and introduced the ſame cuſtoms there. A few years after, Zancle was built by the pirates of Cumæ in Italy ; but chiefly peopled by the Chalcidians, Samians, and Ionians, who choſe rather to ſeek new ſettlements than live under the Perſian yoke. Some time after, Anaxales, tyrant of Rhegium, drove out the ancient proprietors ; and, dividing his lands amongſt his followers, called the city <hi rend="italic">Meſſana</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Meſſene,</hi> which was the name of his native city in Peloponneſus. The city of Himera was founded by the Zancleans under the direction of Eucleides, Simus, and Sacon ; but peopled by the Chalcidians and ſome Syracuſan exiſes, who had been driven out by the contrary faction.</p><p>The Syracuſians built Acræ, Chasmenæ, and Camarina ; the firſt 70 years, the second 90, and the third 135, after the foundation of their own city. This is the account which Thucydides, a moſt judicious and exact writer, gives us of the various nations, whether Greeks or Barbarians, who ſettled in Sicily. Strabo counts among the ancient inhabitants of Sicily the Morgetes, who being driven out of Italy by the Oenotrians, ſettled in that part of the iſland where the ancient city of Morgantium ſtood. The Campani, who aſſumed the name of <hi rend="italic">Mamertini,</hi> that is, <hi rend="italic">invincible warriors,</hi> and the Carthaginians, who ſettled very early in Sicily, ought likewiſe to be counted among the ancient inhabitants of the iſland.</p><p>Before this period the hiſtory of Sicily is blended with fables like the early hiſtory of almoſt every other country. After the ſettlement of the Greeks in the iſland, its various revolutions have been traced from their ſeveral ſources by many writers ; but by none with greater accuracy than Mr Swinburne. From his account of his Travels in the Two Sicilies, we have therefore taken the following conciſe hiſtory of this kingdom, which will at once gratify ſuch of our readers as intereſt themſelves in the fate of a generous people who long ſtruggled in vain for freedom ; and at the ſame time afford them a ſpecimen of the entertainment they may receive from the very elegant work of the author,</p></body></text></TEI>
