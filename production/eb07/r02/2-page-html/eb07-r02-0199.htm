<p><span class="font0">drawn through the centre of gravity, when in any other situation, would be on that side of P towards which this centre has been moved. Therefore, by the rules of pendulous bodies, it tends to come back. This would be more remarkably the case if the points of suspension C and D were&nbsp;on the same side of the point P with the points of attachment A and B ; for in this case the new point of intersection of the lines of support would shift to the opposite side,&nbsp;and be still further from the vertical line through the new&nbsp;position of the centre of gravity. But if the points of suspension and of attachment are on opposite sides of P, the&nbsp;new point of intersection may shift to the same side with&nbsp;the centre of gravity, and lie beyond the vertical line. In&nbsp;this case the equilibrium is tottering. It is easy to perceive,&nbsp;too, that if the equilibrium of suspension from tile points C&nbsp;and D be stable, the equilibrium on the props AE and BF&nbsp;must be tottering. It is not necessary for our present purpose to engage more particularly in this discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is plain that, with respect to the mere momentary equilibrium, there is no difference in the support by threads,&nbsp;props, or planes, and we may substitute the one for the&nbsp;other. We shall find this substitution extremely usefιd,&nbsp;because we easily conceive distinct notions of the support of&nbsp;a body by strings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Observe farther, that if the whole figure be inverted, and strings be substituted for props, and props for strings,&nbsp;the equilibrium will still obtain. For by comparing fig. 5&nbsp;with fig. 6, we see that the vertical line through the centre&nbsp;of gravity will pass through the intersection of the two&nbsp;strings or props ; and this is all that is necessary for the&nbsp;equilibrium ; only it must be observed in the substitution&nbsp;of props for threads, and of threads for props, that if it be&nbsp;done without inverting the whole figure, a stable equilibrium becomes a tottering one, and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">vice versa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This is a most useful proposition, especially to the unlettered artisan, and enables him to make a practical use of problems which the greatest mechanical geniuses have found&nbsp;it no easy task to solve. An instance will show the extent&nbsp;and utility of it. Suppose it were required to make a mansard or kirb roof whose width</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">is AB (fig. 7), and consisting of the four equal rafters&nbsp;AC, CD, DE, EB. There&nbsp;can be no doubt but that&nbsp;its best form is that which&nbsp;will put all the parts in&nbsp;equilibrio, so that no ties or&nbsp;stays may be necessary for&nbsp;opposing the unbalanced</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">thrust of any part of it. Make a chain </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">acdeb (fig.</span><span class="font0"> 8) of four equal pieces, loosely connected bypin-joints, round&nbsp;which the parts are perfectly moveable. Suspend&nbsp;this from two pins α, ⅛,&nbsp;fixed in a horizontal line.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This chain or festoon will arrange itself in such a&nbsp;form that its parts are in&nbsp;equilibrio. Then we know&nbsp;that if the figure be inverted, it will compose the&nbsp;frame or truss of a kirb-roof </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">aγlιb,</span><span class="font0"> which is also&nbsp;in equilibrio, the thrusts of&nbsp;the pieces balancing each</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">other in the same manner that the mutual pulls of the hanging festoon </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">acdeb</span><span class="font0"> did. If the proportion of the height </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">df </span><span class="font0">to the width </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ab</span><span class="font0"> is not such as pleases, let the pins </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a, b</span><span class="font0"> be&nbsp;placed nearer or more distant, till a proportion between the&nbsp;width and height is obtained which pleases, and then make</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">the figure ACDEB, fig. 7, similar to it. It is evident that this proposition will apply in the same&nbsp;manner to the determination of the&nbsp;form of an arch of a bridge ; but&nbsp;this is not a proper place for a further discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We are now enabled to compute all the thrusts and other pressures which are exerted by the&nbsp;parts of a roof on each other and&nbsp;on the walls. Let AB (fig. 9) be&nbsp;a beam standing anyhow obliquely, and G its centre of gravity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Let us suppose that the ends of it are supported in any directions&nbsp;AC, BD, by strings, props, or&nbsp;planes. Let these directions meet&nbsp;in the point </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">P of</span><span class="font0"> the vertical line&nbsp;PG passing through its centre of&nbsp;gravity. Through G draw lines&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ga, Gb</span><span class="font0"> parallel to PB, PA. Then&nbsp;The weight of the beam&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">f PG</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The pressure or thrust at A &gt; is proportional to √ </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pa </span><span class="font0">And the pressure at B&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">J&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">( P⅛.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For when a body is in equilibrio between three forces, these forces are proportional to the sides of a triangle which&nbsp;have their directions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In like manner, if A </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">g</span><span class="font0"> be drawn parallel to P </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">b,</span><span class="font0"> we shall have</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Weight of the beam </span><span class="font1">1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">tPg</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Thrust on A &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt; proportional to √ PA</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">And thrust on B &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">j&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">[Ag</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Or, drawing Bχ parallel to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pa,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Weight of the beam </span><span class="font1">1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i </span><span class="font0">Pχ</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Thrust at A &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;proportional to √ Bχ</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">And thrust at B &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;( PB,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It cannot be disputed that, if strength alone be considered, the proper form of a roof is that which puts the whole in equilibrio, so that it would remain in that shape&nbsp;although all the joints were perfectly loose or flexible. If&nbsp;it has any other shape, additional ties or braces are necessary for preserving it, and the parts are unnecessarily strained. When this equilibrium is obtained, the rafters which&nbsp;compose the roof are all acting on each other in the direction of their lengths ; and by this action, combined with&nbsp;their weights, they sustain no strain but that of compression, the strain of all others that they are the most able to&nbsp;resist. We may consider them as so many inflexible lines&nbsp;having their weights accumulated in their centres of gravity. But it will allow an easier investigation of the subject, if we suppose the weights to be at the joints, equal to&nbsp;the real vertical pressures which are exerted on these points.&nbsp;These are very easily computed ; for it is plain, that the&nbsp;weight of the beam AB (fig. 9) is to the part of this weight&nbsp;that is supported at B as AB to AG. Therefore, if W&nbsp;represent the weight of the beam, the vertical pressure at&nbsp;AG</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">B will be W × L_, and the vertical pressure at A will be Ab&nbsp;BG</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">W × ξ-θ. In like manner, the prop BF being considered</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">as another beam, and/as its centre of gravity and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">w</span><span class="font0"> as its ∕<sup>,</sup>F</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">weight, a part of this weight, equal to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">w</span><span class="font0"> × g=, is support-AG</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ed at B, and the whole vertical pressure at B is W X γθ ∕F</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">+ w × —. </span><span class="font0">And thus we greatly simplify the consideration of the mutual thrusts of roof frames. We need hard-</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
