Pz is therefore a tangent, and perpendicular to PH, and will meet RT in ſome point Q__of the line MN. The particle P is in a ſtate of rotation round the axis CGr, and its velocity is to the velocities round A« or <hi rend="italic">^Αb</hi>  as Pz to P/' or PN. The triangles PRN and OPN are ſimilar. For PN the tangent is perpendicular to the radius OP, and PR is perpendicular to ON. There-</p><p>PR PN</p><p>fore OP : PN=PR : RN, and RN=-^p-. But</p><p>the velocity of P round the axis B3 is OP.⅛.

Therefore fine NRT : fine NT R = fine GED : fine GDE. But RNT= EGD, for NR is perpendicular to EG and NT (being parallel to IF) is perpendicular to DG. Therefore TR is perpendicular to ED, and Cc is parallel to ED, and the rotation of the particle P is round an axis parallel to ED.</p><p>And ſince RN, RF, RT, are as the volocities <hi rend="italic">b, a<hi rend="sub">i </hi></hi>c, round theſe different axes, and are proportional to EG, DG, DE, we have <hi rend="italic">c</hi>  to <hi rend="italic">a</hi>  or to <hi rend="italic">b</hi>  as ED to GD Or GE, and the propoſition is demonſtrated.</p><p>This theorem may be thus expreſſed in general terms.</p><p>If a body revolves round an axis paſſing through its centre of gravity with the angular velocity «, while this axis is carried round another axis, alſo paſſing through its centre of gravity, with the angular velocity <hi rend="italic">b,</hi>  theſe two motions compoſe a motion of every particle of the body round a third axis, lying in the plane of the other two, and inclined to each of the former axes in angles whoſe fines are inverſely as the angular velocities round them ; and the angular velocity round this new axis is to that round one of the primitive axes as the fine of inclination of the two primitive axes is to the line of the inclination of the new axis to the other primitive axis.</p><p>When we ſay that we owe the enunciation of this theorem to P. Friſi, we grant at the ſame time that ſomething like it has been ſuppoſed or aſſumed by other authors. Newton ſeems to have conſidered it as true, and even evident, in homogeneous ſpheres ; and this has been tacitly acquieſced in by the authors who followed him in the problem of the preceſſion. Inferior writers have careleſsly aſſumed it as a truth. Thus Nollet, Graveſande, and others, in their contrivances for exhibiting experiments for illuſtrating the compoſition of vortices, proceeded on this aſſumption. Even authors of more ſcrupulous reſeareh have ſatisſied themſelves with a very imperfect proof. Thus Mr Landen, in his excellent diſſertation on rotatory motion, Philoſophical Tranſactions, Vol. LXVII. contents himſelf with ihow-mg, that, by the equality and oppoſite directions of the motions round the axes A <hi rend="italic">a</hi>  and B <hi rend="italic">b,</hi>  the point C will be at reſt, and from thence concludes that CG <hi rend="italic">c</hi>  will be the new axis of rotation. But this is exceedingly haſty (note alſo, that this diſſertation was many years poſte-rior to that of P. Friſi) : For although the ſeparate motions of the point C may be equal and oppoſite, it is by no means either a mathematical or a mechanical conſequence that the body will turn round the axis C <hi rend="italic">c.</hi></p><p>In order that the point C may remain at reſt, it is neceſſary that all tendencies to motion be annihilated : this is not even thought of in making the aſſumption. Friſi has ſhown, that in the motion of every particle· round the axis C c, there is involved a motion round the two axes A <hi rend="italic">a</hi>  and B <hi rend="italic">b<hi rend="sub">i</hi></hi>  with the velocities <hi rend="italic">a</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">b ;</hi>  and it is a conſequence of this, and of this only, that the impulſes which would ſeparately produce the rotations of every particle round A <hi rend="italic">a</hi>  and B <hi rend="italic">b</hi>  will, either in ſucceſſion or in conjunction, produce a rotation round Cλ Moreover, Mr Landen’s not having attended to this, has led him, as we imagine, into a miſtake refpe ⅜β the velocity with which the axis changes its poſition ; and though his proceſs exhibits the path of evagation with accuracy, we apprehend that it does not aſſign the true times of the axes arriving at particular points of this path.</p><p>It follows from this propoſition, that if every particle of a body, whether ſolid or fluid, receives in one inſtant a ſeparate impulſe, competent to the production of a motion of the particle round an axis wfith a certain angular velocity, and another impulſe competent to the production of a motion round another axis with a certain velocity*, the combined effect of all theſe impulſions will be a motion of the whole ſyſtem round a third axis given in poſition, with an angular velocity which is alſo given : and this motion will obtain without any ſe-paration or diſunion of parts ; for we ſee that a motion round two axes conſtitute a motion round a third axis in every particle, and no ſeparation would take place although the ſyſtem were incoherent like a main of fand, except by the action of the centrifugal forces ariſing from rotation. Mr Simpſon therefore erred in his ſolution of the problem of the preceſſion, by ſuppo-ſing another force neceſſary for enabling the particles of the fluid ſpheroid to accompany the equator when diſplaced from its former ſituation. The very force which makes the diſplacement produces the accompaniment, as far as it obtains, which we ſhall ſee preſent-ly is not to the extent that Mr Simpſon and other authors who treat this problem have ſuppoſed.</p><p>For the ſame reaſon, if a body be turning round any axis, and every particle in one inſtant get an impulſe preciſely ſuch as is competent to p∣oduce a given angular velocity round another axis, the body will turn, round a third axis given in poſition, with a given angular velocity : for it is indifferent (as it is in the ordinary compoſition of motion) whether the forces act on a particle at once or in lucceſſion. The final motion is the ſame both in reſpect of direction and velocity.</p><p>Laſtly, when a rigid body acquires a rotation round an axis by the action of an impulſe on one part of it, and at the ſame time, or afterwards, gets an impulſe on any part which, alone, would have produced a certain rotation round another axis, the effect of the combined actions will be a rotation round a third axis, in terms of this propoſition ; for when a rigid body acquires a motion round an axis, not by the ſimultaneous impulſe of the preciſely competent force on each particle, but by an impulſe on one part, <hi rend="italic">there has been propagated tβ every particle</hi>  (by means of the connecting forces) an impulſe preciſely competent to produce the motion which the particle really acquires ; and when a rigid body, al-</p></body></text></TEI>
