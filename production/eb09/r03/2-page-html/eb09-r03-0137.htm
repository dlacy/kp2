        <p><span class="font1">under the Albergo di Catena near the Piazza Montanara. This temple
                was begun by Augustus in 36 ιs.c.,@@<sup>1</sup> after his Sicilian&nbsp;victory
                over Sextus Pompeius, and finished in 28 B. c.@@<sup>2</sup> A glowing&nbsp;account
                of the splendours of these buildings is given by Propertius&nbsp;</span><span
                class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{El.,</span><span class="font1"> ii. 3).
                Inside the cella were statues of Apollo between Latona&nbsp;and Diana by Scopas,
                Praxiteles, and Timotheus respectively (Plin., </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">H.N^.,</span><span class="font1"> xxxvi. 4) ; round the
                walls were statues of the nine Muses (Juv., vii. 37). The pediment had sculpture by
                Bupalus&nbsp;and Arehermus of Chios (Plin., </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">H.N.,</span><span class="font1"> xxxvi. 4), and on the
                apex&nbsp;was Apollo in a quadriga of gilt bronze. The double door was&nbsp;covered
                with ivory reliefs of the death of the Niobids and the&nbsp;defeat of the Gauls at
                Delphi. The Ancyra inscription records that Augustus sold eighty silver statues of
                himself and with the money “ offered golden gifts” to this temple, dedicating them
                both in his&nbsp;own name and in the names of the original donors of the
                    statues.@@<sup>3&nbsp;</sup>The Sibylline books were preserved under the statue
                of Apollo (Suet., </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
                >Axιg.,</span><span class="font1"> 31); and within the cella were vases, tripods,
                and statues of gold and silver, with a collection of engraved gems dedicated by
                Marcellus (see Plin., </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
                >H.N.,</span><span class="font1"> xxxvii. 5). On each side of&nbsp;the porticus was
                a large library, one Latin and the other Greek ;@@<sup>4&nbsp;</sup>and a third side
                of the great enclosure was occupied by a large hall&nbsp;where the Senate
                Occasionallymet (Tac., </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
