a town of the west riding of the county of York, in the wapentake of Barkston Ash. It is situated on the great road from Doncaster to York, 185 miles from</p><p>London. It was once a place of more importance than it is at present, having been the seat of an archbishop, of whose palace no vestige now remains ; but there is a fine old church. The place is celebrated for its cherry-orchards, and for a peculiar kind of plums. The population of the town amounted in 1821 to 1144, and in 1831 to 1155; but the parish extends over six other townships, whose aggregate population amounted in 1821 to 2916, and in 1831 to 3068.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
