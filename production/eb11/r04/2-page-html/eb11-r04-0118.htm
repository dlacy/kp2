<p><span class="font2">Both the western and eastern Mediterranean now acknowledged the suzerainty of Rome, but her relations with the two were from the first different. The West fell to her as the prize&nbsp;of victory over Carthage, and, the Carthaginian power broken,&nbsp;there was no hindrance to the immediate establishment in&nbsp;Sicily, Sardinia, Spain, and finally in Africa, of direct Roman&nbsp;rule. To the majority, moreover, of her western subjects&nbsp;she brought a civilization as well as a government of a higher&nbsp;type than any before known to them. And so in the West she&nbsp;not only formed provinces but created a new and wider Roman&nbsp;world. To the East, on the contrary, she. came as the liberator&nbsp;of the Greeks; and it was only slowly that in this part of the&nbsp;Empire her provincial system made way. In the East, moreover,&nbsp;the older civilization she found there obstinately held its ground.&nbsp;Her proconsuls governed and her legions protected the Greek&nbsp;communities, but to the last the East remained in language,&nbsp;manners and thought Greek and not Roman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Period</span><span class="font2"> C: </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Period of the Revolution</span><span class="font2"> (146-49 </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.).</span><span class="font2">—In the course of little more than a century, Rome had&nbsp;become the supreme power in the civilized world. By&nbsp;all men, says Polybius, it was taken for granted that&nbsp;nothing remained but to obey the commands of the Romans.@@<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>For the future the interest of Roman history centres in her&nbsp;attempts to perform the two Herculean tasks which this unique&nbsp;position laid upon her,—the efficient government of the subject&nbsp;peoples, and their defence against the barbarian races which&nbsp;swarmed around them on all sides. They were tasks under&nbsp;which the old republican constitution broke down, and which&nbsp;finally overtaxed the strength even of the marvellous organiza</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">tion framed and elaborated by Augustus and his successors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Although in its outward form the old constitution had undergone little change during the age of war and conquest from 265 to 146,@@<sup>2</sup> the causes, both internal and external,&nbsp;which brought about its fall had been silently at work&nbsp;throughout. Its form was in strictness that of a&nbsp;moderate democracy. The patriciate had ceased to&nbsp;exist as a privileged caste,@@<sup>3</sup> and there was no longer&nbsp;any order of nobility recognized by the constitution. The&nbsp;senate and the offices of state were in law open to all,@@<sup>4</sup> and the&nbsp;will of the people in assembly had been in the most explicit&nbsp;and unqualified manner declared to be supreme alike in the&nbsp;election of magistrates, in the passing of laws, and in all matters&nbsp;touching the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">caput</span><span class="font2"> of a Roman citizen. But in practice the&nbsp;constitution had become an oligarchy. The senate,&nbsp;not the assembly, ruled Rome, and both the senate&nbsp;and the magistracies were in the hands of a class&nbsp;which, in defiance of the law, arrogated to itself the&nbsp;title and the privileges of a nobility.@@<sup>5 </sup>The ascendancy of the&nbsp;senate is too obvious and familiar a fact to need much illustration here. It was but rarely that the assembly was called upon&nbsp;to decide questions of policy, and then the proposal was usually&nbsp;made by the magistrate in obedience to the express directions&nbsp;of the senate.@@<sup>6</sup> In the enormous majority of cases the matter&nbsp;was settled by a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">senatus consultum.</span><span class="font2"> without any reference to</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2">the people at all. The assembly decides for war or peace,@@<sup>7 </sup>but the conduct of the war and the conditions of peace are&nbsp;matters left to the senate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.).</span><span class="font2"> Now and then the assembly&nbsp;confers a command upon the man of its choice, or prolongs the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">hnperium</span><span class="font2"> of a magistrate,@@<sup>8</sup> but, as a rule, these and all questions,&nbsp;connected with foreign affairs are settled within the walls of&nbsp;the* senate-house.@@<sup>9</sup> It is the senate which year after year&nbsp;assigns the commands and fixes the number and disposition of&nbsp;the military forces,@@<sup>10</sup> directs the organization of a new province,@@<sup>11&nbsp;</sup>conducts negotiations, and forms alliances. Within Italy,&nbsp;though its control of affairs was less exclusive, we find that,&nbsp;besides supervising the ordinary current business of administration, the senate decides questions connected with the Italian&nbsp;allies, sends out colonics, allots lands, and directs the suppression of disorders. Lastly, both in Italy and abroad it managed&nbsp;the finances.@@<sup>12</sup> Inseparably connected with this monopoly of&nbsp;affairs to the exclusion of the assembly was the control which&nbsp;in practice, if not in theory, the senate exercised over the&nbsp;magistrates. The latter had become what Cicero wrongly&nbsp;declares they were always meant to be, merely the subordinate&nbsp;ministers of the supreme council,@@<sup>13</sup> which assigned them their&nbsp;departments, provided them with the necessary equipment,&nbsp;claimed to direct their conduct, prolonged their commands,&nbsp;and rewarded them with triumphs. It was now at once the&nbsp;duty and the interest of a magistrate to be </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">in auctoritate senatus,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">“ subject to the authority of the senate,” and even the once&nbsp;formidable </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tribuni plebis</span><span class="font2"> are found during this period actively&nbsp;and loyally supporting the senate, and acting as its spokesmen&nbsp;in the assembly.@@<sup>14</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The causes of this ascendancy of the senate are to be found firstly in the fact that the senate was the only body capable&nbsp;of conducting affairs in an age of incessant war. The&nbsp;voters in the assembly, a numerous, widely scattered&nbsp;body, could not readily be called together, and when&nbsp;assembled were very imperfectly qualified to decide momentous&nbsp;questions of military strategy and foreign policy. The senate, on&nbsp;the contrary, could be summoned in a moment,@@<sup>15</sup> and included in&nbsp;its ranks all the skilled statesmen and soldiers of the commonwealth. The subordination of the magistrates was equally&nbsp;the result of circumstances, for, as the numbers of the magistrates, and also the area of government, increased, some central&nbsp;controlling power became absolutely necessary to prevent&nbsp;collisions between rival authorities, and to secure a proper-division of labour, as well as to enforce the necessary concert&nbsp;and co-operation.@@<sup>16</sup> No such power could be found anywhere&nbsp;in the republican system but in the senate, standing as it&nbsp;necessarily did in the closest relations with the magistrate,&nbsp;and composed as it was increasingly of men who were or had&nbsp;been in office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Once more, behind both senate and magistrates, lay the whole power and influence of the new nobility.@@<sup>17</sup> These </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">nobiles-</span><span class="font2">were essentially distinct from the older and more legitimate patrician aristocracy. Every patrician was of&nbsp;course noble, but the majority of the “ noble families ”&nbsp;in 146 were not patrician but plebeian.@@<sup>18</sup> The title&nbsp;had been gradually appropriated, since the opening of the&nbsp;magistracies, by those families whose members had held&nbsp;curulc office, and had thereby acquired the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ius imagiwum.</span><span class="font2"> It&nbsp;was thus in theory within the reach of any citizen who could&nbsp;win election even to the curule aedileship, and, moreover, it&nbsp;carried with it no legal privileges whatsoever.
