<p><label>RAIL</label>
(German <hi rend="italic">Balle,</hi> French <hi rend="italic">Bâle,</hi> Low Latin <hi rend="italic">Ballus),</hi> originally the English name of two birds, distinguished from one another by a prefix as Land-Rail and Water-Rail, but latterly applied in a much wider sense to all the species which are included in the Family <hi rend="italic">Ballidæ</hi> of Ornithology.</p><p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Land-Rail,</hi> also very commonly known as the Corn-Crake, and sometimes as the Daker-Hen, is the <hi rend="italic">Ballus crex</hi> of Linnaeus and <hi rend="italic">Crex pratensis</hi> of recent authors. Its monotonous grating cry, which has given it its common name in several languages, is a familiar sound throughout the summer nights in many parts of the British Islands ; but the bird at that season very seldom shews itself, except when the mower lays bare its nest, the owner of which, if it escape beheading by the scythe, may be seen for an instant before it disappears into the friendly covert of the still standing grass. In early autumn the partridge-shooter not unfrequently flushes it from a clover-field or tangled hedgerow ; and, as it rises with apparent labour and slowly flies away to drop into the next place of concealment, if it fall not to his gun, he wonders how so weak-winged a creature can ever make its way to the shores if not to the interior of Africa, whither it is almost certainly bound ; for, with comparatively few individual exceptions, the Land-Rail is essentially migratory—nay more than that, it is the <hi rend="italic">Ortygometra</hi> of classical authors —supposed by them to lead the <hi rend="smallcaps">Quail</hi> <hi rend="italic">(supra,</hi> p. 146) on its voyages—and in the course of its wanderings has now been known to reach the coast of Greenland, and several times that of North America, to say nothing of Bermuda, in every instance we may believe as a straggler from Europe or Barbary. The Land-Rail needs but a brief description. It looks about as big as a Partridge, but on examination its appearance is found to be very deceptive, and it will hardly ever weigh more than half as much. The plumage above is of a tawny brown, the feathers being longitudinally streaked with blackish brown ; beneath it is of a yellowish white ; but the flanks are of a light chestnut. The species is very locally distributed, and in a way for which there is at present no accounting. In some dry upland and corn-growing districts it is plentiful; in others, of apparently the same character, it but rarely occurs ; and</p>

<p>the same may be said in regard to low-lying marshy meadows, in most of which it is in season always to be heard, while in others having a close resemblance to them it is never met with. The nest is on the ground, generally in long grass, and therein from nine to eleven eggs are commonly laid. These are of a cream-colour, spotted and blotched with light red and grey. The young when hatched are thickly clothed with black down, as is the case in nearly all species of the Family.</p><p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Water-Rail,</hi> locally known as the Skiddy or Bill-cock, is the <hi rend="italic">Ballus aquaticus</hi> of Ornithology, and seems to be less abundant than the preceding, though that is in some measure due to its frequenting places into which from their swampy nature men do not often intrude. Having a general resemblance to the Land-Rail, <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="1"> Formerly it seems to have been a popular belief in England that the Land-Rail in autumn transformed itself into a Water-Rail, resuming its own characters in spring. The writer has met with several persons who had serious doubts on the subject! </note> it can be in a moment distinguished by its partly red and much longer bill, and the darker coloration of its plumage—the upper parts being of an olive brown with black streaks, the breast and belly of a sooty grey, and the flanks dull black barred with white. Its geographical distribution is very wide, extending from Iceland (where it is said to preserve its existence during winter by resorting to the hot springs) to China; and though it inhabits Northern India, Lower Egypt, and Barbary, it seems not to pass beyond the tropical line. It never affects upland districts as does the Land-Rail, but always haunts wet marshes or the close vicinity of water. Its love-note is a loud and harsh cry, not continually repeated as is that of the Land-Rail, but uttered at considerable intervals and so suddenly as to have been termed “explosive.” Besides this, which is peculiar to the cock-bird, it has a croaking call that is frog-like. The eggs resemble those of the preceding, but are more brightly and delicately tinted.</p><p>The various species of Rails, whether allied to the former or latter of those just mentioned, are far too numerous to be here noticed. Hardly any part of the world is without a representative of the genera <hi rend="italic">Crex</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Rallus,</hi> and every considerable country has one or perhaps more of each—though it has been the habit of systematists to refer them to many other genera, the characters of which are with difficulty found. Thus in Europe alone three other species allied to <hi rend="italic">Crex pratensis</hi> occur more or less abundantly ; but one of them, the Spotted Rail or Crake, has been made the type of a so-called genus <hi rend="italic">Porzana,</hi> and the other two, little birds not much bigger than Larks, are considered to form a genus <hi rend="italic">Zctpornia.</hi> The first of these, which used not to be uncommon in the eastern part of England, has a very near representative in the Carolina Rail or Sora, <hi rend="italic">Crex Carolina, of</hi> North America, often there miscalled the Ortolan, just as its European analogue, <hi rend="italic">C. porzana,</hi> is in England often termed the Dotterel. But, passing over these as well as some belonging to genera that can be much better defined, and other still more interesting forms of the Family, as <hi rend="italic">Aphanapteryx</hi> <hi rend="smallcaps">(Birds, vol. iii. p. 733), Coot (vol. vi. p. 341), Moor-Hen (vol. xvi. p. 808), and Ocydrome (vol. xvii. p. 722), a few words must be said of the more distant group formed by the South-American</hi> <hi rend="italic">Hcliornis,</hi> and the African and Indian <hi rend="italic">Podica,</hi> comprising four or five species, to which the name ‘ ‘ Finfoots ” has been applied — from the lobes or flaps of skin that fringe their toes. Though for a long while placed among the <hi rend="italic">Poclicipcdidie</hi> <hi rend="smallcaps">(Grebe, vol. xi. p. 79), their osteology no less than their habits appear to indicate their alliance with the Rails, if they be not members of the Family</hi> <hi rend="italic">Ralliclae</hi> ; but they seem to shew the extreme modification of that type in adaptation to aquatic life. Then again the curious genus <hi rend="italic">Mesites</hi> of Madagascar, whose systematic place has been so long in doubt, has been referred by Prof. Alph. Milne-Edwards (rt?i?i. <hi rend="italic">Sc. Naturclle,</hi> ser. 6, vii. art. 2) to the neighbourhood of the Rails, though offering some points of resemblance to the Herons. On the other hand the Jacanas (vol. xiii. p. 531) or <hi rend="italic">Parridse,</hi> which from their long toes were once thought to belong to the Rails, are now generally admitted to be Limicoline, while the genus <hi rend="italic">Aramus</hi> —the Courlan or Limpkin of the Southern United States—still occupies a very undetermined position. On the whole the <hi rend="italic">Rallidae</hi> constitute a group of birds which, particularly as regards their relations to some other remarkable forms, of which the Sun-Bittern, <hi rend="italic">Eurypyga,</hi> and Kagu, <hi rend="italic">Rhinochetus,</hi> may especially be named, well deserve greater attention from the systematist, and any ornithologist in want of a subject could hardly find one more likely to reward his labours if he were only to carry them out in a judicious way. Based on the safe ground of anatomy, but due regard being also had to the external characters, habits, and other peculiarities of this multifarious group, a monograph might be produced of surpassing interest, and one that in its bearings on the doctrine of evolution would be likely to prove a telling record.
