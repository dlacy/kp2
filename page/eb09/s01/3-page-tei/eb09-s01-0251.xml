            <p>oldest Eastern Scandinavian runic inscriptions, dating from a period before the
                beginning of the literature, as well as in many modern Eastern Scandinavian
                dialects. For, having regard to the Scandinavian dialects generally, we must adopt
                quite a different classification from that indicated by the dialects which are
                represented in the literature. We now pass on to review the latter and their
                history.</p>
            <p>I. <hi rend="smallcaps">Icelandic.</hi>—In ancient times Icelandic was by far the
                most important of the Scandinavian languages, in form as well as in literature. To
                avoid ambiguity, the language before the Reformation (about 1530-40) is often called
                old Icelandic.</p>
            <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Old Icelandic</hi> was spoken not only in Iceland, but also in
                Greenland, where Icelandic colonists lived for a lengthened period (983- about
                1400). Our knowledge of its character is almost exclusively derived from the
                remarkably voluminous literature, @@<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> dating from the
                middle of the 12th century, and written in the Latin alphabet, adapted to the
                special requirements of this language. Nothing is preserved of older runic
                literature.@@2 Indeed, Old Icelandic possesses only very few runic monuments (about
                forty), all of them almost worthless from a philological point of view. The oldest,
                the inscription on the church door of Valpjofstaðr, dates from the beginning of the
                13th century,@@<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> and is consequently later than the
                oldest preserved manuscripts @@<hi rend="superscript">4</hi> in the Latin alphabet,
                some of which are as old as the end of the 12th century. A small fragment (Cod. AM.
                237, fob) of a <hi rend="italic">Book of Homilies</hi> (of which a short specimen is
                given below) is considered the oldest of all. About contemporary with this is the
                oldest part of an inventory entitled <hi rend="italic">Reykjaholts máldage.</hi>
                From about 1200 we possess a fragment (Cod. Reg. old sign. 1812) of the only
                existing Old Icelandic <hi rend="italic">glossary, </hi>and from the first years of
                the 13th century the <hi rend="italic">Stockholm Book of Homilies</hi> (Cod. Holm.
                15, 4to), which from a philological point of view is of the greatest importance,
                chiefly on account of its very accurate orthography, which is especially noticeable
                in the indication of quantity; from the early part of the same century comes the
                fragment (Cod. AM. 325, 2, 4to) entitled <hi rend="italic">Agrip</hi> (“abridgment”
                of the history of Norway), probably a copy of a Norwegian original, also
                orthographically important. Among later manuscripts we may mention, as
                philologically interesting, the <hi rend="italic">Annales Regii</hi> (Cod. Reg.
                2087) from the beginning of the 14th century, orthographically of great value; the
                rich manuscript of miscellanies, <hi rend="italic">Hauksbók</hi> (Codd. AM. 371,
                544, 675, 4to), a great part of which is written with Haukr Erlendsson’s (+1334) own
                hand; and, above all, three short essays, in which some Icelanders have tried to
                write a grammatical and orthographical treatise on their own mother-tongue, all
                three appearing as an appendix to the manuscripts of the <hi rend="italic">Prose
                    Edda. </hi>The oldest and most important of these essays (preserved in the Cod.
                Worm, from about 1330) is by an unknown author of about 1150, and is probably
                intended to be a continuation of a lost work of the first grammarian of Iceland,
                Póroddr Rúnameistari (who flourished at the beginning of the 12th century); the
                second (the oldest known manuscript of which is preserved in the Cod. Ups., c. 1290)
                is perhaps the work of the famous Snorri Sturloson (+1241); the third (the oldest
                manuscript in Cod. AM. 748, 4to, of the beginning of the 14th century) is by
                Snorri’s nephew Ólafr Hvítaskáld (+1259), and is no doubt based partly upon pórodd’s
                work above mentioned, partly and chiefly upon Priscian and Donatus.@@<hi
                    rend="superscript">5</hi></p>
            <p>The oldest form of the Icelandic language is, however, not preserved in the
                above-mentioned earliest manuscripts of the end of the 12th century, which are
                written in the language of their own age, but in far later ones of the 13th century,
                which contain poems by the oldest Icelandic poets, such as the renowned Egill
                Skallagrimson (about 930) and the unknown authors of the so-called Edda-songs. In
                spite of the late date of the manuscripts, the metrical form has been the means of
                preserving a good deal of the ancient language. But, as already remarked, during the
                10th and 11th centuries this dialect differs but little from Norwegian, though in
                the 12th this is no longer the case.</p>
            <p>We may here contrast a specimen of the above-mentioned oldest Icelandic manuscript
                (from the end of the 12th century) with an almost contemporary Norwegian one (Cod.
                AM. 619; see below):—</p>

            <p>Apart from the fact that the language is, generally speaking, archaic, we find in the
                Icelandic text two of the oldest and most essential characteristics of Icelandic as
                opposed to Norwegian, viz., the more complete vowel assimilation (pionosto, <hi
                    rend="italic">tyonasto ; cf.</hi> also, <hi rend="italic">e.g., </hi>Icel. <hi
                    rend="italic">kollokom,</hi> Norw. <hi rend="italic">kallaðum,</hi> we called)
                and the retention of initial <hi rend="italic">h</hi> before <hi rend="italic">r
                    (hreinlcga, rasinlega), I,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">n.</hi> other differences,
                some of which occur at this period, others a little later, are— in Icel. lengthening
                of <hi rend="italic">a, o, u</hi> before <hi rend="italic">If, Ig, Ik, Im,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Ip</hi> (as Icel. <hi rend="italic">halfr,</hi> Norw. and
                oldest Icel. <hi rend="italic">halfr,</hi> half); later still, also of <hi
                    rend="italic">a, i,</hi> ii, and <hi rend="italic">y</hi> before <hi
                    rend="italic">ng</hi> and <hi rend="italic">nk</hi>; Icel. <hi rend="italic"
                    >di</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ey</hi> for older and (ϕy (as in Icel. <hi
                    rend="italic">daema, heyra,</hi> Norw. and oldest Icel. <hi rend="italic"
                    >dϕma,</hi> to deem, <hi rend="italic">hϕyra,</hi> to hear); Icel. termination
                of 2nd plur. of verbs in -8 (p) or <hi rend="italic">-t,</hi> but Norw. often in <hi
                    rend="italic">-r</hi> (as Icel. <hi rend="italic">taktið, -t,</hi> Norw. <hi
                    rend="italic">takir,</hi> you take). These points may be sufficient to
                characterize the language of the earlier ‘classical” period of Icelandic (about
                1190-1350). At the middle of the 13th century the written language undergoes
                material changes, owing in a great measure, no doubt, to the powerful influence of
                Snorri Sturloson. Thus in unaccented syllables <hi rend="italic">i</hi> now appears
                for older <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">u</hi> (at first only when
                followed by one or more consonants belonging to the same syllable) for <hi
                    rend="italic">o</hi> ; the passive ends in <hi rend="italic">-z</hi> for <hi
                    rend="italic">-sk.</hi> The other differences from Norwegian, mentioned above as
                occurring later, are now completely established. With the beginning of the 14th
                century there appear several new linguistic phenomena : a <hi rend="italic">u</hi>
                is inserted between final <hi rend="italic">r</hi> and a preceding consonant (as in
                    <hi rend="italic">ríkur,</hi> mighty); <hi rend="italic">o</hi> (pronounced as
                an open <hi rend="italic">o)</hi> passes into <hi rend="italic">ö</hi> (the
                character <hi rend="italic">ö</hi> was not introduced till the 16th century), or
                before <hi rend="italic">ng, nk</hi> into <hi rend="italic">au</hi> (as <hi
                    rend="italic">long, fioll,</hi> pronounced <hi rend="italic">laung, fiöll)</hi>;
                c before <hi rend="italic">ng, nk</hi> passes into <hi rend="italic">ei</hi>; a
                little later <hi rend="italic">e</hi> passes into <hi rend="italic">ie,</hi> and the
                passive changes its termination from -z, oldest <hi rend="italic">-sk,</hi> into <hi
                    rend="italic">-zt</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">-zst)</hi> (as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >kallazt,</hi> to be called). The post-classical period of old Icelandic
                (1350-1530), which is, from a literary point of view, of but little importance,
                already shows marked differences that are characteristic of Modern Icelandic ; as
                early as the 15th century we find <hi rend="italic">ddl </hi>for <hi rend="italic"
                    >ll</hi> and <hi rend="italic">rl</hi> (as <hi rend="italic">falla,</hi>
                pronounced <hi rend="italic">faddla,</hi> to fall), <hi rend="italic">ddn</hi> for
                    <hi rend="italic">nn</hi> and <hi rend="italic">rn</hi> (as <hi rend="italic"
                    >horn,</hi> pron. <hi rend="italic">hoddn,</hi> horn); about the year 1500 <hi
                    rend="italic">ve</hi> after <hi rend="italic">h </hi>passes into <hi
                    rend="italic">vo,</hi> in other positions to <hi rend="italic">vo</hi> (as <hi
                    rend="italic">hvelpr,</hi> pron. <hi rend="italic">xvolpur, </hi>whelp; <hi
                    rend="italic">kvern,</hi> pron. <hi rend="italic">kvöm,</hi> mill), etc.</p>
            <p>Although dialectical differences are not altogether wanting, they do not occur to any
                great extent in the Old Icelandic literary language. Thus, in some manuscripts we
                find <hi rend="italic">ft</hi> replaced by <hi rend="italic">fst (oft, ofst,</hi>
                often); in manuscripts from the western part of the island there appears in the 13th
                and 14th centuries a tendency to change <hi rend="italic">If, rf</hi> into <hi
                    rend="italic">lb, rb (tolf, tolb,</hi> twelve ; <hi rend="italic">porf,
                    porb,</hi> want), &amp;c. To what extent the language of Greenland differed from
                that of Iceland we cannot judge from the few runic monuments which have come down to
                us from that colony.</p>
            <p>Apart from the comparatively inconsiderable attempts at a grammatical treatment of
                old Icelandic in the Middle Ages which we have mentioned above, grammar as a science
                can only be said to have commenced in the 17 th century. The first grammar, written
                by the Icelander Runolphus Jonas (+1654), dates from 1651. His contemporary and
                compatriot Gudmund Andreae (+1654) compiled the first dictionary, which was not,
                however, edited till 1683 (by the Dane Petrus Resenius, +1688). The first scholars
                who studied old Icelandic systematically were H. K. Rask (1787-1832), whose works
                    @@<hi rend="superscript">6</hi> laid the foundation to our knowledge of the
