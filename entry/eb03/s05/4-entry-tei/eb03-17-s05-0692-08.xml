 in botany : A genus of plants belonging to the claſs of <hi rend="italic">diaecia,</hi> and to the order of <hi rend="italic">pentandria ;</hi> and in the natural ſyſtem arranged under the 12th order, <hi rend="italic">Hοlοracea.</hi> The male calyx is quinquepartite ; there is no corolla : the female calyx is quadrifid ; no corolla ; there are four ſtyles, and one ſeed within the indurated calyx. There are only two ſpecies, the oleracea and fera. I. The <hi rend="italic">oleracea,</hi> common ſpinage, has ſeſſile fruits and ſagittated leaves. It has been cultivated in Britain ſince 1568, but it is not known from what country it was originally brought. When intended for winter uſe, it ſhould be ſown on an open ſpot of ground in the latter end of July ; obſerving to do it if poſſible when the weather is rainy. When the young plants are come up, the weeds muſt be deſtroyed, and the plants left at about five inches aſunder. The ground being kept clear of weeds, the ſpinage will be fit for uſe in October. The way of gathering it to advantage is only to take off the longeſt leaves, leaving thoſe in the centre to grow bigger; and at this rate a bed of ſpinage will furniſh the table for a whole winter, till the ſpinage ſown in spring is become fit for uſe, which is common in April. 2. The f <hi rend="italic">era,</hi> wild ſpinage, produces its fruit on footſtalks.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
