<p><span class="font2">RAPIER, the name given to two distinct types of sword. Originally the “ rapier ” (Fr. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">rapière</span><span class="font2">) was a long two-edged and&nbsp;pointed weapon with a wide cup hilt, used together with the&nbsp;dagger in fencing and duelling chiefly as a thrusting weapon,&nbsp;the cut taking a secondary position. This was the typical&nbsp;duelling sword of the 16th and 17th centuries. In the 18th&nbsp;century the “ small-sword ” took its place; this was a pointed&nbsp;weapon only, the “ cut ” having entirely dropped out, and the&nbsp;dagger being discarded. The word rapieris of doubtful origin.&nbsp;Du Cange (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Glossarium, s.v. </span><span class="font2">&quot; Rapparia”) quotes an example&nbsp;of the word used as an adjective to qualify </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">espée</span><span class="font2"> as early as&nbsp;1474, and gives as a conjectural derivation Gr. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ῥαπίξϵιν</span><span class="font2"> = Lat.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">caedere,</span><span class="font2"> to cut. Skeat (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Etym. Dict.,</span><span class="font2"> 1910) follows the suggestion&nbsp;of Diez that </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">rapière</span><span class="font2"> is from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">raspière,</span><span class="font2"> a rasper or poker, and was&nbsp;a name given in contempt by the old cut-and-thrust fencers to the&nbsp;new weapon. Spanish has </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">raspadera,</span><span class="font2"> a raker, and there are&nbsp;several 16th and 17th century quotations alluding to the contempt with which the rapier was greeted, and to its Spanish&nbsp;origin (see Fencing and Sword).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RAPIN, PAUL DE (1661-1725), sieur of.Thoyras, French historian, was the son of Jacques de Rapin, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">avocat</span><span class="font2"> at Castres&nbsp;(Tarn), where he was born on the 25th of March 1661. He&nbsp;was educated at the Protestant academy of Saumur, and in 1679&nbsp;became an advocate, but soon afterwards entered the army.&nbsp;The revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, and the death of&nbsp;his father led him to come to England; but, unable to find&nbsp;employment there, he crossed to Holland and enlisted in the&nbsp;company of French volunteers at Utrecht commanded by&nbsp;Daniel de Rapin, his cousin-german. He accompanied the&nbsp;prince of Orange to England in 1688, and during the Irish&nbsp;campaign he took part in the siege of Carrickfergus and the&nbsp;battle of the Boyne, and was wounded at the battle of Limerick.&nbsp;Soon afterwards he was promoted captain; but in 1693 he&nbsp;resigned in order to become tutor to the earl of Portland’s son.&nbsp;After travelling with his charge, he settled with his family in&nbsp;Holland, first at the Hague, then, for economy’s sake, at Wesel,&nbsp;in 1707, where he began his great work, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">L'Histoire d'Angleterre.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">Though he was of a strong constitution, the seventeen years’&nbsp;application ruined his health. He died in 1725.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Raρin was also the author of a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dissertation sur les Whigs et les Torys</span><span class="font1"> (1717). </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">L'Histoire d' Angleterre,</span><span class="font1"> embracing the period from&nbsp;the invasion of the Romans to the death of Charles I., was printed&nbsp;at the Hague in 1724 in 8 vols. It was translated into English&nbsp;and improved with notes by Tindal, in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">2</span><span class="font1"> νols. folio, 1725-31. Rapin’s&nbsp;history of England was almost the only one available in France in&nbsp;the first half of the 18th century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RAPOPORT, SAMUEL JUDAH LÖB (1790-1867), Jewish scholar, was born at Lemberg in 1790. After various experiences&nbsp;in business, Rapoport became successively rabbi of Tarnopol&nbsp;(1837) and of Prague (1840). He was one of the founders of the&nbsp;new learning in Judaism. His chief work was the first part of&nbsp;an (unfinished) encyclopaedia ('</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Erekh Millin,</span><span class="font2"> 1852). Equally&nbsp;notable were his biographies of the Gaon Saadiah, Nathan&nbsp;author of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Arnkh,</span><span class="font2"> the Gaon Hai, Eleazar Kalir and others.&nbsp;He died at Prague in 1867.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(I. A.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RAPPAREE, properly </span><span class="font0">a </span><span class="font2">short pike (Irish, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">rapaire</span><span class="font2">) ; the term being hence applied in the war in Ireland from 1688-92 to the&nbsp;Irish irregular soldiers armed with this weapon. It thus&nbsp;became synonymous with robber or freebooter, and in 1707&nbsp;appears in the title of an act (6 Anne, cap. 11) “for the more&nbsp;effectual suppression of . . . robbers and rapparees.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RAPPOLTSWEILER (French </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ribeauville</span><span class="font2">)</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span class="font2"> a town of Germany, in the imperial province of Alsace-Lorraine. Pop. (1905) 5986.&nbsp;It lies at the entrance of the valley of the Strengbach, under&nbsp;the eastern slope of the Vosges mountains, 33 m. S.W. of Strass-burg on the railway to Basel, being connected with its station&nbsp;on that line, 2½ m. distant, by a tramway. It is in part surrounded by ancient walls, and has many picturesque medieval&nbsp;houses, and two old churches, of St Gregory and St Augustine,&nbsp;both fine Gothic buildings. The town hall contains a valuable&nbsp;collection of antiquities. The Carolabad, a saline spring with&nbsp;a temperature of 64° F., which had a great repute in the middle&nbsp;ages, was rediscovered in 1888, and made Rappoltsweiler a&nbsp;watering-place. The industries include the spinning and&nbsp;weaving of cotton and wool, printing, dyeing and tanning,&nbsp;while there is a brisk trade in wine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Rappoltsweiler, known in the 8th century as Rathaldovilare, passed from the bishops of Basel to the lords of Rappoltstein,&nbsp;who were among the most famous nobles in Alsace. The lord&nbsp;of Rappoltstein was the king or protector of the wandering&nbsp;minstrels of the land, who purchased his protection by paying&nbsp;him a tax. When the family became extinct in 1673 this&nbsp;office of king of the pipers </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Pfeiferkönig)</span><span class="font2"> passed to the counts&nbsp;palatine of Zweibrücken-Birkenfeld. The minstrels had a&nbsp;pilgrimage chapel near Rappoltsweiler, dedicated to their&nbsp;patron saint, Maria von Dusenbach, and here they held an&nbsp;annual feast on the 8th of September. Near the town are the&nbsp;ruins of three famous castles, Ulrichsburg, Girsberg and Hohrappoltstein, which formerly belonged to the lords of Rappoltstein.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">RARE EARTHS, in chemistry, the name given to </span><span class="font0">a </span><span class="font2">group of oxides of certain metals which occur in close association&nbsp;in some very rare minerals. Although these metals resemble&nbsp;each other in their chemical relationships, it is convenient to&nbsp;subdivide them into three groups: the cerium, terbium and&nbsp;ytterbium groups. The first includes scandium (Sc, 441∙1),&nbsp;yttrium (Y, 89∙0), lanthanum (La, 139·0), cerium (Ce, 140∙25),&nbsp;praseodymium (Pr, 140·6), neodymium (Nd, 144∙3), and samarium (Sa, 150·4); the second includes europium (Eu, 152∙0),&nbsp;gadolinium (Gd. 157∙3), and terbium (Tb, 159·2); and the third&nbsp;includes dysprosium (Dy, 162·5), holmium (Ho, ?) erbium&nbsp;(Er, 167·4), thulium (Tm, 168∙5), ytterbium or neoytterbium&nbsp;(Yb, 172∙0), and lutecium (Lu, 174·0); the letters and numbers&nbsp;in the brackets are the symbols and atomic weights (international). Although very rare, a large number of minerals&nbsp;contain these metals; they are chiefly found in Scandinavia,&nbsp;parts of the Urals, America and Australia, generally associated&nbsp;with Archean and eruptive rocks, and more rarely with sedimentary deposits. They are usually silicates, but many&nbsp;complex tantalates, niobates, phosphates, uranates and fluorides&nbsp;occur. The chief mineral species are monazite, a phosphate&nbsp;of the cerium metals, containing thorium (this mineral supplies the ceria and thoria employed in making incandescent gas&nbsp;mantles); cerite, a hydrated silicate of calcium and the cerium&nbsp;metals; gadolinite, a silicate of beryllium, iron, and the&nbsp;yttrium metals; samarksite, a niobate and tantalate of both&nbsp;the cerium and yttrium metals, with uranium, iron, calcium,&nbsp;etc.; and keilhauite, a titanosilicate of yttrium, iron, calcium&nbsp;and aluminium; other species are fergusonite, orthite, aeschynite, euxenite and thorianite.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The chemistry of this group may be regarded as beginning with Cronstedt’s description of the mineral cerite from Bastnaës&nbsp;in 1751, and the incorrect analyses published by T. O</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">. </span><span class="font2">Bergman&nbsp;and Don Fausto d’Elhuyar in 1784. Ten years later Gadolin&nbsp;investigated the mineral subsequently named gadolinite, which&nbsp;had been found at Ytterby in 1788 by Arrhenius. This discovery of a new earth was confirmed by A. G. Ekeberg in 1799,&nbsp;who named the base yttria. Cerite was examined simultane-ously by Klaproth in Germany and by Berzelius and Hisinger&nbsp;in Sweden; and a new base was discovered in 1803 which the&nbsp;Swedish chemists named ceria. Both these oxides have proved&nbsp;to be mixtures. In 1839 Mosander separated “ ceria ” into true&nbsp;ceria and an earth which he termed lanthana (Gr. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">λαvθάveιv,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">to lie hidden), and in 1841 he showed that his lanthana contained another base, which he called didymia (Gr. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">διδύμοι,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">twins). This didymia was separated in 1879 by Lecoq de Boisbaudran into a new base, samaria, and a residual didymia&nbsp;which was shown by Auer von Welsbach in 1885 to consist of&nbsp;a mixture of two bases, praseodidymia and neodidymia; moreover, samaria was split by Demarçay in 1900 into true samaria&nbsp;and a new base named europia. In 1843 Mosander also split</span></p><div style="border-right:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
