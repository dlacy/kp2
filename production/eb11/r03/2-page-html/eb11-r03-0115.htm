<p><span class="font1">ROBERT-FLEURY, JOSEPH NICOLAS (1797-1890), French painter, was born at Cologne. He was sent by his family to&nbsp;Paris, and after travelling in Italy returned to France and&nbsp;made his first appearance at the Salon in 1824; his reputation, however, was not established until three years later, when&nbsp;he exhibited “ Tasso at the Convent of St Onophrius.” Endowed with a vigorous original talent, and with a vivid imagination, especially for the tragic incidents of history, he soon rose&nbsp;to fame, and in 1850 succeeded Granet as member of the&nbsp;Académie des Beaux-Arts. In 1855 he was appointed professor&nbsp;and in 1863 director of the École des Beaux-Arts, and in the&nbsp;following year he went to Rome as director of the French&nbsp;Academy in that city. Among his chief works are: “ A&nbsp;Reading at Mme. de Sévigné’s,” “ Scene of St Bartholomew,”&nbsp;“ Henry IV. taken to the Louvre after his Assassination ”&nbsp;(1836); “Triumphal Entry of Clovis at Tours” (1838), at&nbsp;the Versailles Museum; “Le Colloque de Poissy ” (1840), at&nbsp;the Luxembourg Museum in Paris; “ The Children of Louis&nbsp;XVI. in the Temple” (1840); “Marino Faliero ”; “An&nbsp;Auto-da-fé,” “ Galileo before the Holy Office,” at the Luxembourg Museum; “ Christopher Columbus received by the&nbsp;Spanish Court” (1847), at the same gallery; “The Last&nbsp;Moments of Montaigne” (1853); and “Charles V. in the&nbsp;Monastery of Yuste ” (1857). Hc died in Paris in 1890.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">His son, </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tony Robert-Fleury</span><span class="font1"> (1837- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;), French painter,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">was bom in Paris, and studied under his father and under Delaroche and Léon Coignet. His first picture at the Salon,&nbsp;in 1866, was a large historical composition of the “ Warsaw&nbsp;Massacres on April 8, i86r.” In the following year his “ Old&nbsp;Women in the Place Navone, Rome ” was bought for the&nbsp;Luxembourg Museum, as was also the “ Last Day of Corinth ”&nbsp;in 1870. In 1880 he painted a ceiling for the Luxembourg,&nbsp;representing “ The Glorification of French Sculpture.” Tony&nbsp;Robert-Fleury became president of the Société des Artistes&nbsp;français in succession to Bouguereau. He acquired a great&nbsp;reputation for his historical compositions and portraits; and&nbsp;from his atelier have issued a great number of the best-known&nbsp;painters of our day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROBERTS, DAVID (1796-1864), Scottish painter, was bom at Stockbridge, Edinburgh, on the 24th of October 1796. He&nbsp;was apprenticed by his father, a shoemaker, for seven years to&nbsp;a painter and house-decorator; and during this time he employed his evenings in the study of art. In 1820 he formed the&nbsp;acquaintance of Clarkson Stanfield, then painting at the Pantheon, Edinburgh, at whose suggestion he sent three pictures&nbsp;in 1822 to the Exhibition of Works by Living Artists, held&nbsp;in Edinburgh. In the same year he removed to London,&nbsp;where he worked for the Coburg Theatre, and was afterwards&nbsp;employed, along with Stanfield, at Drury Lane. In 1824 he&nbsp;exhibited at the British Institution a view of Dryburgh Abbey,&nbsp;and sent two works to the first exhibition of the Society of&nbsp;British Artists, of which he was elected president in 1831.&nbsp;In the same autumn he visited Normandy, and the works&nbsp;which were the results of this excursion began to lay the foundation of the artist’s reputation—one of them, a view of Rouen&nbsp;Cathedral, being sold for eighty guineas. His scenes for an&nbsp;opera, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Seraglio,</span><span class="font1"> executed two years later, and the scenery&nbsp;for a pantomime dealing with the naval victory of Navarino,&nbsp;and two panoramas executed jointly by him and Stanfield,&nbsp;were among his last work for the theatres. In 1829 he exhibited&nbsp;the “ Departure of the Israelites from Egypt,” in which his style&nbsp;first becomes apparent; three years afterwards he travelled in&nbsp;Spain and Tangiers, returning in the end of 1833 with a supply&nbsp;of effective sketches, elaborated into attractive and popular&nbsp;paintings. His “ Interior of Seville Cathedral ” was exhibited&nbsp;in the British Institution in 1834, and sold for £300; and he&nbsp;executed a fine series of Spanish illustrations for the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Landscape&nbsp;Annual</span><span class="font1"> of 1836, while in 1837 a selection of his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Picturesque&nbsp;Sketches in Spain</span><span class="font1"> was reproduced by lithography.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In 1838 Roberts made a long tour in the East, and accumulated a vast collection of sketches of </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font1">class of scenery which had&nbsp;hitherto been hardly touched hy British artists, and which&nbsp;appealed to the public with all the charm of novelty. The&nbsp;next ten years of his life were mainly spent in elaborating&nbsp;these materials. An extensive series of drawings w<sup>T</sup>as lithographed by Louis Haghe in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sketches in the Holy Land and&nbsp;Syria,</span><span class="font1"> 1842-1849. In 1851, and again in 1853, Roberts visited&nbsp;Italy, painting the “ Ducal Palace, Venice,” bought by Lord&nbsp;Londesborough, the “ Interiorof the Basilicaof St Peter’s, Rome,”&nbsp;“ Christmas Day, 1853,” and “ Rome from the Convent of St&nbsp;Onofrio,” presented to the Royal Scottish Academy. His last&nbsp;volume of illustrations, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Italy, Classical, Historical and Picturesque,</span><span class="font1"> was published in 1859. He also executed, by command of&nbsp;Queen Victoria, a picture of the opening of the Great Exhibition&nbsp;of 1851. In 1839 he was elected an associate and in 1841 a&nbsp;full member of the Royal Academy; and in 1858 he was presented with the freedom of the city of Edinburgh. The last&nbsp;years of his life were occupied with a series of views of London&nbsp;from the Thames. He had executed six of these, and was at&nbsp;work upon a picture of St Paul’s Cathedral, when, on the 25th&nbsp;November 1864, he died suddenly of apoplexy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font1"> of Roberts, compiled from his journals and other sources by James Ballantine, with etchings and pen-and-ink sketches by&nbsp;the artist, appeared in Edinburgh in 1866.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Roberts, G.C.B., was bom at Cawmpore, InjJia, on the 30th of September 1832. Educated at Eton, Sandhurst and Addis-combe, he obtained a commission in the Bengal Artillery on&nbsp;12th December 1851. In the following year he w*as posted to&nbsp;a field battery at Peshawar, where he also acted as aide-de-camp to his father, who commanded the Peshawar division.&nbsp;In 1856 Roberts was appointed to the quartermaster-general’s&nbsp;department of the staff, in which he remained for twenty-two&nbsp;years, passing from one grade to another until he became&nbsp;quartermaster-general in India. On the outbreak of the&nbsp;Mutiny in 1857, Roberts, at first, was staff officer to the movahle&nbsp;column operating against the mutineers in the Punjab, successively commanded by Colonels Neville Chamberlain and&nbsp;John Nicholson, but, towards the end of June, he joined the&nbsp;Delhi Field Force, and was deputy assistant quartermaster-general with the artillery during the operations against Delhi.&nbsp;He was wounded in the fight of the 14th of July, but w*as&nbsp;sufficiently recovered in September to take command as a&nbsp;regimental officer of the left half of No. 2 Siege Battery during&nbsp;the siege. He rejoined the headquarters staff for the assault,&nbsp;and took part in the storm and subsequent seven days’ fighting&nbsp;in the city. He then accompanied Colonel Greathed’s column&nbsp;to Cawnpore, and during September and October was present&nbsp;at the actions of Bulandshahr, Aligarh, Agra, Bithur and&nbsp;Kanauj. He served under Sir Colin Campbell at the second&nbsp;relief of Lucknow in November, at the battle of Cawmporc on&nbsp;the 6th of December, and the subsequent pursuit and defeat&nbsp;of the Gwalior contingent near Shinrajpur. Roberts distinguished himself at the engagement of Khudaganj, on the&nbsp;2nd of January 1858, by capturing, in single-handed combat,&nbsp;a standard from two sepoys, and also by cutting dowm a sepoy&nbsp;about to kill a sowar. For these acts of gallantry he was&nbsp;recommended for the Victoria Cross. He was present at the&nbsp;reoccupation of Fatehgarh on the 6th of January, the storm of&nbsp;Mianganj in February, the siege and capture of Lucknow in&nbsp;March, and the action at Kursi on the 22nd of that month,&nbsp;after which he wænt home on sick leave. For his services in the&nbsp;Mutiny he was seven times mentioned in despatches, received&nbsp;the medal with three clasps, the Victoria Cross, and on his&nbsp;promotion to captain, in October i860, a brevet majority. On&nbsp;the 17th of May 1859 he married, at Waterford, Miss Nora&nbsp;Bews, and on his return to India w<sup>T</sup>as entrusted with the organization of the viceroy’s camps during the progresses through&nbsp;Oudh, the North-West Provinces, the Punjab and Central India&nbsp;in i860 and 1861.
