<p><span class="font1">gious elevation. In one of these, under the equatorial sun, stands the city of Quito, in the midst of extensive fields of&nbsp;barley, oats, wheat, and gardens containing apples, pears,&nbsp;and gooseberries, and, in short, all the grains and fruits of&nbsp;the cooler parts of Europe; and although the vine is also&nbsp;there in perfection, the olive is wanting. Not a dozen miles&nbsp;from it, in the low countries, the sugar-cane, the indigo,&nbsp;and all the fruits of the torrid zone, find their congenial heat,&nbsp;and the inhabitants swelter under a burning sun. At a&nbsp;small distance on the other hand tower aloft the pinnacles&nbsp;of Pichincha, Corambourou, and Chimboraçao, crowned&nbsp;with never-melting snows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The individual mountains of this stupendous range cut off therefore all communication between the Pacific Ocean&nbsp;and the inland continent; and no rivers are to be found on&nbsp;the west coast of South America which have any considerable length of course or body of waters. The country is&nbsp;drained, like Africa, in the opposite direction. Not 100&nbsp;miles from the city of Lima, the capital of Peru, which lies&nbsp;almost on the sea-shore, and just at file foot of the high&nbsp;Cordilleras, arises out of a small lake the Maragnon or&nbsp;Amazons river, which, after running northward for about&nbsp;100 miles, takes an easterly direction, and crosses nearly&nbsp;the broadest part of South America, and falls into the great&nbsp;western ocean at Para, after a course of not less than 4095&nbsp;miles. In the first half of its descent it receives a few&nbsp;middle-sized rivers from the north, and from the south it&nbsp;receives the great river Combos, springing from another&nbsp;little lake not fifty miles distant from the head of the Maragnon, and enclosing between them a wide extent of country. It then receives the Yuta, the Yuerva, the Cuchi-vara, and Parana Mire, each of which is equal to the Rhine;&nbsp;and then the Madeira, which has flowed above 1300 miles.&nbsp;At their junction the breadth is so great that neither shore&nbsp;can be seen by a person standing up in a canoe; so that&nbsp;the united stream must be about six miles broad. In this&nbsp;form it rolls along through a flat country, covered with impenetrable forests, and most of it as yet untrodden by human feet. Mr Condamine, who came down the stream,&nbsp;says that all is silent as the desert, and the wild beasts and&nbsp;numberless birds crowd round the boat, eyeing it as some&nbsp;animal of which they did not seem afraid. The bed was&nbsp;cut deep through an equal and yielding soil, which seemed&nbsp;rich in every part, if he could judge by the vegetation,&nbsp;which was rank in the extreme. What an addition to&nbsp;the possible population of this globe! A narrow slip along&nbsp;each bank of this mighty river would equal in surface the&nbsp;whole of Europe, and would probably exceed it in general&nbsp;fertility; and although the velocity in the main stream was&nbsp;considerable, he observed that it was extremely moderate,&nbsp;nay almost still, at the sides; so that in those parts where&nbsp;the country was inhabited, the Indians paddled up the river&nbsp;with perfect ease. Boats could go from Para to near the&nbsp;mouth of the Madeira in thirty-eight days, which is nearly&nbsp;1200 miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Not far from the head of the Maragnon, the Cordilleras send off a branch to the north-east, which reaches and&nbsp;ranges along the shore of the Mexican Gulf; and the Rio&nbsp;Grande de Sta Martha occupies the angle between the&nbsp;ridges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Another ridge ranges with interruption along the east coast of Terra Firma, so that the whole waters of this country are collected into the Oroonoko. In like manner, the&nbsp;north and east of Brazil are hemmed in by mountainous&nbsp;ridges, through which there is no considerable passage;&nbsp;and the ground sloping backwards, all the waters of this&nbsp;immense tract are collected from both sides by many considerable rivers into the great river Paraguay, or Rio de la&nbsp;Plata, which runs down the middle of the country for more&nbsp;than 1400 miles, and falls into the sea through a vast mouth,&nbsp;in latitude 35°.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Thus the whole of South America seems as if it had been formerly surrounded by a mound, and been a great basin.&nbsp;The ground in the middle, where the Parana, the Madeira,&nbsp;and the Plata, take their rise, is an immense marsh, uninhabitable on account of its exhalations, and quite impervious&nbsp;in its present state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The manner in which the continent of North America is watered, or rather drained, has also some peculiarities.&nbsp;By looking at the map, one will observe, first of all, a general division of the whole of the best-known part into two,&nbsp;by the valleys in which the beds of the rivers St Lawrence&nbsp;and Mississippi are situated. The head of this is occupied&nbsp;by a singular series of fresh-water seas or lakes, viz. the&nbsp;Lakes Superior and Michigan, which empty themselves into&nbsp;Lake Huron by two cataracts. This again runs into Lake&nbsp;Erie by the river Detroit, and the Erie pours its water into&nbsp;the Ontario by the famous Fall of Niagara, and from the&nbsp;Ontario proceeds the great river St Lawrence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The ground to the south-west of the Lakes Superior and Erie is somewhat lower, and the middle of the valley is occupied by the Mississippi and the Missouri, which receive&nbsp;on both sides a number of smaller streams, and, having&nbsp;joined, proceed to the south under the name Mississippi.&nbsp;In latitude 37° this river receives into its bed the Ohio, a&nbsp;river of equal magnitude, and the Cherokee river, which&nbsp;drains all the country lying at the back of the United&nbsp;States, separated from them by the ranges of the Appalachian Mountains. The Mississippi is now one of the chief&nbsp;rivers on the globe, and proceeds due south till it falls into&nbsp;the Mexican Bay through several shifting mouths, which&nbsp;greatly resemble those of the Danube and the Nile, having&nbsp;run above 1200 miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The elevated country between this bed of the Mississippi and St Lawrence and the Atlantic Ocean is drained on the&nbsp;east side by a great number of rivers, some of which are&nbsp;very considerable, and of long course; because instead of&nbsp;being nearly at right angles to the coast, as in other countries, they are in a great measure parallel to it. This is&nbsp;more remarkably the case with Hudson’s river, the Delaware, Potomac, and Rappahannoc. Indeed the whole of&nbsp;North America seems to consist of ribs or beams laid nearly&nbsp;parallel to each other from north to south, and the rivers&nbsp;occupy the interstices. All those which empty themselves&nbsp;into the bay of Mexico are parallel and almost perfectly&nbsp;straight, unlike what are seen in other parts of the world.&nbsp;The westernmost of them all, the North river, as it is&nbsp;named by the Spaniards, is nearly as lone as the Mississippi.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">PART I, —THEORY OF THE MOTION OF RIVERS AND </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">canals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The importance of this subject needs no commentary. Every nation, every country, every city is interested in it.&nbsp;Our wants, our comforts, and our pleasures require a knowledge of it. We must conduct the water of rivers to the&nbsp;centre of our dwellings; we must secure ourselves against&nbsp;their ravages; we must employ them to drive those machines which, by compensating for our personal weakness,&nbsp;make a few able to perform the work of thousands; we&nbsp;employ them to water and fertilize our fields, to decorate&nbsp;our mansions, to cleanse and embellish our cities, to preserve or extend our demesnes, to transport from county to&nbsp;county every thing which necessity, convenience, or luxury,&nbsp;has rendered precious to man: for these purposes we must&nbsp;confine and govern the mighty rivers, we must preserve or&nbsp;change the beds of the smaller streams, draw off from them&nbsp;what shall water our fields, drive our machines, or supply</span></p>
