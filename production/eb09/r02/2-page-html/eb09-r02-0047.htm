<p><span class="font1">blood differs from arterial blood chiefly in the relative amounts of O and CO<sub>2</sub> it contains. Which of these&nbsp;substances is it whose deviation from the arterial standard&nbsp;causes stimulation 1 It so happens that we can experimentally separate the two factors. If an animal be placed&nbsp;in a chamber of some inert gas, such as nitrogen, the&nbsp;escape of CO., from the lungs is unimpeded and no accumulation of CO<sub>2</sub> in the blood is brought about ; nevertheless&nbsp;dyspnoea and asphyxia follow as if the entrance of air to&nbsp;the windpipe had been interrupted. Here there is no&nbsp;accumulation of CO<sub>2</sub> in the blood, but total deficiency of O.&nbsp;On the other hand, if an animal be placed in a chamber&nbsp;containing a large excess of CO<sub>2</sub> beyond the standard of&nbsp;expired air, but at the same time a superabundant supply&nbsp;of O, no dyspnoea supervenes, and no asphyxia threatens.&nbsp;The animal may suffer from drowsiness (for CO<sub>2</sub> is narcotic&nbsp;in its effects), but true dyspnoea never occurs so long as&nbsp;the supply of O is sufficient. There is little doubt therefore that the absence of O from venous blood is the essential condition of its stimulating property.</span></p>

It is not, however, in every case served&nbsp;by special air-containing organs or lungs. Indeed the&nbsp;essential interchange of respiration goes on wherever the&nbsp;blood comes into sufficiently close contact with oxygen.&nbsp;For example, the air which happens to be swallowed with&nbsp;our food is so closely in contact with the blood of the&nbsp;intestinal vessels that an interchange of gases occurs, constituting a true intestinal respiration. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mammalia</span><span class="font1"> all&nbsp;possess true lungs. In birds also there are lungs, but the&nbsp;mechanism of respiration is unlike that of man, since the&nbsp;diaphragm is wanting. There are, in birds, besides lungs,&nbsp;“air sacs” lying among the viscera and communicating&nbsp;with cavities in the bones, these sacs being supplied with&nbsp;air from the lungs. Reptiles and some amphibians breathe&nbsp;by lungs, other amphibians breathe by gills, as also do the&nbsp;young of some of the air-breathing </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Amphibia</span><span class="font1"> (frogs).&nbsp;Fishes breathe by gills, using the O dissolved in water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Many invertebrates respire in air, which is carried into the midst of their tissues in tracheæ or air-tubes branched&nbsp;like a tree ; other invertebrates breathe by gills in water ;&nbsp;others again have lungs. In some the oxygenized water&nbsp;is carried into the body along a series of tubes—the&nbsp;water-vascular system ; and in still simpler animals the&nbsp;general surface of the body seems to serve the respiratory&nbsp;function.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a. g.*)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RESTIF, Nicolas Edme (1734-1806), called Restif de la Bretonne (the form Retif, though occasionally&nbsp;used by the author himself, and adopted by M. Monselet,&nbsp;has the less authority), was born at Sacy in the present&nbsp;department of the Yonne, France, on 23d October 1734.&nbsp;His father was a farmer of not the lowest rank, and the&nbsp;vanity of Restif has preserved or invented an extraordinary&nbsp;genealogy (supposed to date from his grandfather’s time)&nbsp;in which the family is traced to the Roman emperor&nbsp;Pertinax. This Restif did not take very seriously, but he&nbsp;is himself almost the only authority for the details of his&nbsp;own career, which he has voluminously recorded, and these&nbsp;details are in part so incredible, in part so obviously distorted by various motives, that it is very hard to do more&nbsp;than discover the general outline of his life. He was&nbsp;well educated—partly if not chiefly by his own devotion&nbsp;to books—he was apprenticed to a printer at Auxerre, and,&nbsp;having served his time, went to Paris. Here he worked&nbsp;as a journeyman printer for some time (indeed he continued his manual work for the greater part of his life),&nbsp;and in 1760 he married Anne or Agnes Lebègue, a&nbsp;relation of his former master at Auxerre. He soon&nbsp;tired of her, and has left the most unfavourable pictures&nbsp;of her morals and temper. In the early years of their&nbsp;married life they were but little together, and for the last&nbsp;twenty they never saw each other; but Restif’s own&nbsp;account is sufficient to show that certainly not all, and probably very few, of the faults were on the wife’s side. It&nbsp;was not till five or six years after his marriage that Restif,&nbsp;who by his own account had written voluminously from&nbsp;his earliest youth but had published nothing, appeared as&nbsp;an author, and from that time to his death on February&nbsp;2, 1806, he produced a bewildering multitude of books&nbsp;(amounting to something like two hundred volumes, and&nbsp;many of them printed with his own hand) on almost every&nbsp;conceivable variety of subject. The most noteworthy are&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Le Pied de Fanxhette,</span><span class="font1"> a novel (1769); </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Le Pornographe&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(same date), a plan for regulating prostitution which is said&nbsp;to have been actually carried out by the emperor Joseph&nbsp;IL, while not a few detached hints have been adopted&nbsp;by Continental nations; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Le Paysan Perverti</span><span class="font1"> (1774), a&nbsp;novel in which much of his own experience is worked in ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">La Vie de Mon Père</span><span class="font1"> (1779), a really remarkable monument of filial piety; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Les Contemporaines</span><span class="font1"> (42 vols., 1780-85), a vast collection of short stories showing at once Restif’s&nbsp;fertility of invention, his narrative faculty, and his accurate&nbsp;observation of the manners of Paris ; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ingenue Saxancour&gt;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">also a novel (1789) ; and, lastly, the extraordinary autobiography of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Monsieur Nicolas</span><span class="font1"> (16 vols., 1794-97; the last two&nbsp;are practically a separate and much less interesting work),&nbsp;in which at the age of sixty he has set down voluminously&nbsp;his remembrances, his notions on ethical and social points,&nbsp;his hatreds, and above all his numerous or innumerable&nbsp;loves real and fancied. The original editions of these, and&nbsp;indeed of all his books, have long been bibliographical&nbsp;curiosities owing to their rarity, the beautiful and curious&nbsp;illustrations which many of them contain, and the quaint&nbsp;typographic system in which most are composed. The&nbsp;author’s life during this long period was a singular mixture&nbsp;of hard work and perpetual falling in love. He seems to&nbsp;have really seen society of the most varied kind, though&nbsp;in this as in all other matters he certainly exaggerates and&nbsp;perhaps invents in a way which makes it impossible to discern the exact truth. Some of his books sold well, and, as&nbsp;has been said, he was always industrious as an author or&nbsp;a printer and sometimes as both. But he had repeated&nbsp;losses, and though never in actual want was never in easy&nbsp;circumstances. He was arrested once during the Revolution but had no difficulty in getting off ; indeed he seems to&nbsp;have been a convinced republican. In 1795 he received a&nbsp;gratuity of 2000 francs from the Government, and just&nbsp;before his death Napoleon gave him a place in the ministry&nbsp;of police, which he did not live to take up. After his&nbsp;death Cubières Palmeaux, a gentleman literary-hack of the&nbsp;day, wrote his life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Restif de la Bretonne undoubtedly bolds a remarkable place in French literature, though the rarity and curious character of his&nbsp;books have sometimes induced his editors and commentators to&nbsp;take too high a view of his merits. He was inordinately vain, of&nbsp;extremely relaxed morals, and perhaps not entirely sane. His&nbsp;books were written with such haste and in such bulk that they can&nbsp;only be praised with great allowance. Their licence of subject and&nbsp;language renders some if not most of them r∣uite unfit for general&nbsp;perusal. But when every deduction is made there will remain on&nbsp;a just estimate the facts that Restif had a singular and profound&nbsp;knowledge of the human heart ffhe second title of his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Monsieur</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
