<p><span class="font1">directed the rehearsals and performances of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Der Ring</span><span class="font1"> at Bayreuth, and in 1877 paid his first visit to England to conduct the Wagner&nbsp;Festival at the Albert Hall. There in 1879 he founded the&nbsp;Richter Concerts, which were a revelation to London musical&nbsp;circles of the masterly personality of the conductor, and his&nbsp;influence upon the orchestra; in 1885 he became conductor of&nbsp;the Birmingham Triennial Festival, and was created Mus.&nbsp;Doc. Oxon. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">honoris causa.</span><span class="font1"> In 1882 Richter also conducted a&nbsp;famous series of performances of Wagner’s works (including the&nbsp;first in England of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Die Meistersinger</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tristan}</span><span class="font1"> at Drury Lane,&nbsp;and in 1900 became conductor of the Hallé Orchestra in Manchester. He had estabIished his position as one of the most&nbsp;richly gifted and the most experienced of modern conductors,&nbsp;supreme in the interpretation of Beethoven, Wagner and&nbsp;Brahms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RICHTER, JEREMIAS BENJAMIN (1762-1807), German chemist, was born at Hirschberg in Silesia on the 10th of March&nbsp;1762, became a mining official at Breslau in 1794, and in 1800&nbsp;was appointed assessor to the department of mines and chemist&nbsp;to the royal porcelain factory at Berlin, where he died on the&nbsp;4th of April 1807. To him belongs the merit of carrying out&nbsp;some of the earliest determinations of the quantities by weight&nbsp;in which acids saturate bases and bases acids, and of arriving&nbsp;at the conception that those amounts of different bases which&nbsp;can saturate the same quantity of a particular acid are equivalent to each other. He was thus led to conclude that chemistry is&nbsp;a branch of applied mathematics and to endeavour to trace a law&nbsp;according to which the quantities of different bases required&nbsp;to saturate a given acid formed an arithmetical, and the&nbsp;quantities of acids saturating a given base a geometrical, progression. His results were published in his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Anfangsgrilnden&nbsp;der Stöchiometrie oder Messkunst chemischer Elemente</span><span class="font1"> (1792-94),&nbsp;and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Über die neueren Gegenstände in der Chemie</span><span class="font1"> (1792-1802),&nbsp;but it was long before they were properly appreciated, or he&nbsp;himself was accorded due credit for them. This was partly&nbsp;because some of his work was wrongly ascribed to C. F. Wenzel&nbsp;by Berzelius through a mistake which was only corrected in&nbsp;1841 by Germain Henri Hess (1802-1850), professor of chemistry&nbsp;at St Petersburg, and author of “ the laws of constant heat-sums&nbsp;and of thermoneutrality ” (see </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Thermochemistry).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RICHTER, JOHANN PAUL FRIEDRICH (1763-1825), usualIy called </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Jean Paul,</span><span class="font1"> famous German humorist, was born at&nbsp;Wunsiedel, in Bavaria, on the 21st of March 1763. His father&nbsp;was a schoolmaster and organist at Wunsiedel, but in 1765 he&nbsp;became a pastor at Joditz near Hof, and in 1776 at Schwarzenbach, where he died in 1770. After attending the gymnasium at Hof, Richter went in 1781 to the Universityof Leipzig.&nbsp;His original intention was to enter his father’s profession, but&nbsp;theoIogy did not interest him, and he soon devoted himself&nbsp;wholly to the study of literature. Unable to maintain himself&nbsp;at Leipzig he returned in 1784 to Hof, where he lived with his&nbsp;mother. From 1787 to 1789 he served as a tutor at Töpen,&nbsp;a village near Hof; and afterwards he taught the children of&nbsp;several families at Schwarzenbach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Richter began his career as a man of letters with </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Gronland-ischc Prozesse</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Atiswahl aus des Teufels Papieren,</span><span class="font1"> the former of which was issued in 1783-84, the latter in 1789. These&nbsp;works were not received with much favour, and in later life&nbsp;Richter himself had little sympathy with their satirical tone.&nbsp;His next book, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Die unsichtbare Loge,</span><span class="font1"> a romance, published in&nbsp;1793, had aIl the qualities which were soon to make himfamous,&nbsp;and its power was immediately recognized by some of the best&nbsp;critics of the day. Encouraged by the reception of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Die unsichtbare Loge,</span><span class="font1"> he sent forth in rapid succession </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hesperus</span><span class="font1"> (1795),&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Biographische Belustigungen unter der Gehirnschale einer Riesin&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(1796), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Leben des Quintus Pixlein</span><span class="font1"> (1796), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Blumen- Frucht- und&nbsp;Dornenstilcke, oder Ehestand, Tod und Hochzeit des Armenadvokaten Siebenkäs</span><span class="font1"> (1796-97), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Der Jubelsenior</span><span class="font1"> (1797), and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Das&nbsp;Kampaner Tal</span><span class="font1"> (1797). This series of writings won for Richter&nbsp;an assured place in German literature, and during the rest of&nbsp;his life every work he produced was welcomed by a wide circle&nbsp;of admirers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">After his mother’s death he went in 1797 to Leipzig, and in the following year to Weimar, where he had much pleasant&nbsp;intercourse with Herder, by whom he was warmly appreciated.&nbsp;He did not become intimate with Goethe and Schiller, to both&nbsp;of whom his literary methods were repugnant; but in Weimar,&nbsp;as elsewhere, his remarkable conversational powers and his&nbsp;genial manners made him a favourite in general society. In 1801&nbsp;he married Caroline Meyer, whom he met in Berlin in 1800.&nbsp;They lived first at Meiningen, then at Coburg; and finally,&nbsp;in 1804, they settled at Bayreuth. Here Richter spent a quiet,&nbsp;simple and happy life, constantly occupied with his work as a&nbsp;writer. In 1808 he was fortunately delivered from anxiety&nbsp;as to outward necessities by the prince-primate, </span><span class="font0">K</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">. </span><span class="font1">T. von&nbsp;Dalberg, who gave him a pension of a thousand florins. Before&nbsp;settling at Bayreuth, Richter had published his most ambitious&nbsp;novel, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Titan</span><span class="font1"> (1800-3); and this was followed by </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Plegeljahre&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(1804-5), two works which he himself regarded as his masterpieces. His later imaginative works were </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dr Katzenbergers&nbsp;Badereise</span><span class="font1"> (1809), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Des Peldpredigers Schmelzle Reise nach Plätz&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(1809), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Leben Pibels</span><span class="font1"> (1812), and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Der Komet, oder Nikolaus&nbsp;Marggraf</span><span class="font1"> (1820-22). In </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vorschule der Aesthetik</span><span class="font1"> (1804) he&nbsp;expounded his ideas on art; he discussed the principles of&nbsp;education in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Levana, oder Erziehungslehre</span><span class="font1"> (1807); and the&nbsp;opinions suggested by current events he set forth in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Priedens-predigt</span><span class="font1"> (1808), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dämmerungen für Deutschland</span><span class="font1"> (1809), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mars&nbsp;und Phobus Thronwechsel im Jahre 1814</span><span class="font1"> (1814), and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Politische&nbsp;Pastenpredigten</span><span class="font1"> (1817). In his last years he began </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Wahrheit&nbsp;aus Jean Pauls Leben,</span><span class="font1"> to which additions Jrom his papers&nbsp;and other sources were made after his death by C. Otto and&nbsp;E. Förster. In 1821 Richter lost his only son, a youth of the&nbsp;highest promise; and he never quite recovered from this&nbsp;shock. He died of dropsy, at Bayreuth, on the 14th November&nbsp;1825.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Schiller said of Richter that he would have been worthy of admiration “ if he had made as good use of his riches as other&nbsp;men made of their poverty.” And it is true that in the form&nbsp;of his writings he never did full justice to his great powers. In&nbsp;working out his conceptions he found it impossible to restrain&nbsp;the expression of any powerful feeling by which he might&nbsp;happen to be moved. He was equally unable to resist the&nbsp;temptation to bring in strange facts or notions which occurred&nbsp;to him. Hence every one of his works is irregular in structure,&nbsp;and his style lacks directness, precision and grace. But his&nbsp;imagination was one of extraordinary fertility, and he had a&nbsp;surprising power of suggesting great thoughts by means of the&nbsp;simplest incidents and relations. The love of nature was one&nbsp;of Richter’s deepest pleasures; his expressions of religious&nbsp;feelings arc also marked by a truly poetic spirit, for to Richter&nbsp;visible things were but the symbols of the invisible, and in the&nbsp;unseen realities alone he found elements which seemed to him&nbsp;to give significance and dignity to human life. His humour,&nbsp;the most distinctive of his qualities, cannot be dissociated from&nbsp;the other characteristics of his writings. It mingled with all&nbsp;his thoughts, and to some extent determined the form in which&nbsp;he embodied even his most serious reflections. That it is sometimes extravagant and grotesque cannot be disputed, but it is&nbsp;never harsh nor vulgar, and generally it springs naturally from&nbsp;the perception of the incongruity between ordinary facts and&nbsp;ideal laws. Richter’s personality was deep and many-sided;&nbsp;with all his wilfulness and eccentricity he was a man of a pure&nbsp;and sensitive spirit, with a passionate scorn for pretence and&nbsp;an ardent enthusiasm for truth and goodness.</span></p>
