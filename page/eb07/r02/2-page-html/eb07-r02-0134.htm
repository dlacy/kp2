<p><span class="font1">The extensive conquests which arose out of these wars, gave occasion to the full development of the leading views&nbsp;of Rome, respecting the political relations in which it was&nbsp;her pleasure to place the conquered with regard to herself.&nbsp;The chief means to which, even from the earliest times, the&nbsp;Romans had recourse for the foundation of their dominion&nbsp;over the conquered, and at the same time for the prevention of the too great increase of the needy classes at Rome,&nbsp;was the establishment of colonies of their own citizens, which&nbsp;served also as garrisons in the captured cities in which they&nbsp;were settled. Each colony had its own internal constitution,&nbsp;formed generally on the model of that of the mother-city ;&nbsp;hence it naturally became an object of Roman policy to keep&nbsp;the colonies in perfect dependence. This colonial system&nbsp;of the Romans, which necessarily arose out of the custom&nbsp;of depriving the conquered of their lands and liberty, assumed its main features in the Samnite war, and gradually embraced the whole of Italy. But the relations subsisting&nbsp;between Rome and the Italian nations were extremely various in kind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A few cities and nations enjoyed the full privileges of Roman citizenship ; in some instances, however, even these&nbsp;were precluded from the right of voting in the comitia.&nbsp;These were the municipal states. The privileges of the&nbsp;colonies were of a more restricted nature : they were indeed&nbsp;in possession of their own civic government, but had no&nbsp;share whatever either in the comitia or the magistracies of&nbsp;Rome. The other inhabitants of Italy were either federates </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(socii, fœdere juncti),</span><span class="font1"> or subjects </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(dedititii).</span><span class="font1"> The federates preserved their own internal form of government,&nbsp;but were obliged to furnish tribute and auxiliary troops.&nbsp;Their further relation with Rome depended upon the specific&nbsp;terms of their league. The most advantageous of these&nbsp;terms were in favour of the Latins, though each of the Latin&nbsp;cities had its own separate league ; as the rest of the Italian&nbsp;nations had their separate treaty, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(jus Ralieum).</span><span class="font1"> The subjects, on the other band </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(dedititii),</span><span class="font1"> were deprived of their&nbsp;internal constitutions, and were governed by Roman magistrates, annually renewed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The internal constitution of Rome itself, now completed, bore the aspect of a democracy, inasmuch as equality of&nbsp;rights existed both for nobles and commons. Yet this democracy was modified by expedients so various and intricate ; the rights of the people, the senate, and the magistrates, fitted so accurately into each other, and were so firmly supported by the national religion, connecting every thing&nbsp;with determinate forms, that there seemed to be no immediate reason to fear tlle evils of anarchy, or of military despotism; though the democratic character threatened the&nbsp;one, and the warlike temper of the nation the other, of these&nbsp;dangers. To obtain a right view of the constitution of&nbsp;Rome, thus modified, a few sentences stating the main outline may be given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This constitution was not, as must already have been seen, the work of one great master-mind, but was the result of&nbsp;long contentions, innumerable temporary expedients, yielding successively as better were devised, aggressions mutually made by the opposing parties in their hour of strength,&nbsp;and concessions in that of weakness ; aud that steady equipoise obtained by the well-balanced action of opposing principles, knit together into the firmest and closest union by&nbsp;repeated heavings, subsidings, and conjunctions. The rights&nbsp;of the people consisted in the legislative power, so far as&nbsp;fundamental national principles were concerned, and in the&nbsp;election of the magistrates. The distinction between the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">comitia tributa,</span><span class="font1"> as independent of the senate, and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">comitia centuriata,</span><span class="font1"> as dependent on the senate, still existed&nbsp;as to form, but had lost all its importance, the difference between patricians and plebeians being now merely nominal,&nbsp;and the establishment of the city tribes excluding the too&nbsp;great influence of the mere populace upon the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">comitia tributa.</span><span class="font1"> The rights of the senate consisted in administering&nbsp;and debating all ordinary national affairs, whether foreign&nbsp;relations, (war and peace only excepted, in which the consent of the people was necessary), financial concerns, or&nbsp;matters regarding domestic peace and security. But the&nbsp;manner in which the senate was supplied and maintained&nbsp;must have made it by far the most skilful political body at&nbsp;tllat time in the world. For a considerable period magisterial power had been the exclusive privilege of the patrician&nbsp;and senatorial order ; but after the plebeians obtained equal&nbsp;access to these offices, the highest rank and power in the&nbsp;state offered a stimulus for exertion to the ambitious career&nbsp;of mental ability from every class and order, thus concentrating the collected mind of the nation, and from it forming a ruling body of unequalled wisdom, genius, and enterprise. The rights and rank of magistrates were founded on&nbsp;their right to the greater or lesser auspices, no public affair&nbsp;being undertaken without the auspices. He only, therefore, who was in possession of the rights of the greater auspices, could hold the highest civil and military power as&nbsp;dictator, consul, or prætor ; such was not the case with those&nbsp;who held only the lesser auspices. The union of the highest civil and military power in the person of the same individual was not without inconvenience and danger; but military despotism was in some measure guarded against by&nbsp;the prohibition of any magistrate from possessing military&nbsp;command within Rome itself. But perhaps the most important of all the principles combined in the constitution of&nbsp;Rome, was the existence and recognised authority of its code&nbsp;of laws. To the sacred voice of public national law could&nbsp;appeal be made at all times, and on every occasion ; and&nbsp;every civic struggle terminated by the addition of some new&nbsp;enactment, which defined the rights and privileges of the&nbsp;contending parties, and left a rule of conduct and a principle of appeal to succeeding ages. This ideal impersonation&nbsp;of law formed, on the one hand, a safeguard against the encroachments of the ruling power, or the deliberative body ;&nbsp;while, on the other, the intemperate fervour of popular will&nbsp;was equally within its controlling influence. Religion&nbsp;and law were the ruling elements of the Roman constitution ; and upon their inherent truth, purity, and power, or&nbsp;the reverse, depended the duration, or the ruin, of Roman&nbsp;virtue and Roman dominion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rome having now obtained the sovereignty of all Italy, was not long in finding employment for her victorious arms&nbsp;in another country. Sicily was the new field on which the&nbsp;strength of Rome was tried, and the Carthaginians were her&nbsp;new antagonists. It appears that a body of Samnite, or&nbsp;Sabellian youth, quitting their homes under the vow of a&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sewred spring,</span><span class="font1">@@<sup>1</sup> had become mercenaries to Agathocles.&nbsp;After his death they seized upon the city Messina, in Sicily,&nbsp;and committed the grossest outrages upon the inhabitants.&nbsp;Having thus made the citizens, and indeed all the inhabitants of Sicily their enemies, these mercenaries (known by&nbsp;the name Mamertines, from the god Mamers, or Mars)&nbsp;sought the protection of the Romans. Some of them had&nbsp;previously applied to the Carthaginians ; and while the Romans were hesitating about lending assistance to such disgraceful allies, the Carthaginians, somewhat less scrupulous,&nbsp;sent a body of troops, and took possession of the citadel of&nbsp;Messina. There had already been such intercourse between&nbsp;Rome and Carthage, as to make each city in some measure&nbsp;aware of the power and ambition of the other. The Roman&nbsp;senate speedily perceived, that if the Carthaginians obtained possession of Sicily, their own prospects of aggrandise-</span></p><div>
