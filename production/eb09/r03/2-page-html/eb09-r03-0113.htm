<p><span class="font0">mortally, and, on his departure for Avignon in 1357 to assist the threatened pontiff, immediately conceded to the&nbsp;latter the supremacy of the senate. And the pope, instead&nbsp;of two senators, hastened to name a single one of foreign&nbsp;birth. This was a shrewd device of Albornoz and another&nbsp;blow to the nobles, with whom he was still at war. Thus&nbsp;was inaugurated, by the nomination of Raimondo de’&nbsp;Tolomei in 1358, a series of foreign senators, fulfilling the&nbsp;functions of a podestà, and changed every six months,&nbsp;together with their staff of judges, notaries, and knights.&nbsp;The people approved of this reform as being inimical to&nbsp;the nobles and favourable to the preservation of liberty.&nbsp;Hitherto the senators had been assisted, or rather kept in&nbsp;check, by the thirteen representatives of the regions.&nbsp;These were now replaced by seven reformers, in imitation&nbsp;of the priors of Florence, the better to follow that city’s&nbsp;example. The reformers were soon the veritable chiefs of&nbsp;the republic. They first appeared in 1360, were either&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">popolani</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">cavallerotti,</span><span class="font0"> and were elected by ballot every&nbsp;three months. When Albornoz returned to Italy, although&nbsp;desirous to keep Rome in the same subjection as the other&nbsp;cities, he had first to vanquish Ordelaffi and reduce&nbsp;Bologna. The latter enterprise was the more difficult task,&nbsp;and provoked a lengthy war with Matteo Visconti of&nbsp;Milan. Thus Rome, being left to herself, continued to be&nbsp;governed by her reformers ; and the nobles, already shut&nbsp;out from power, were also excluded from the militia,&nbsp;which had been reorganized, like that of Florence, on the&nbsp;democratic system. Three thousand men, mostly archers,&nbsp;were enrolled under the command of two banderesi, “ in&nbsp;the likeness,” says M. Villani, “ of our gonfaloniers of the&nbsp;companies,” with four </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">antepositi</span><span class="font0"> constituting a supreme&nbsp;council of war. And the whole body was styled the&nbsp;“ Felix Societas Balestrariorum et Pavesatorum. ” It was&nbsp;instituted to support the reformers and re-establish order&nbsp;in the city and Campagna, to keep down the nobles and&nbsp;defend the republic. It fulfilled these duties with much,&nbsp;and sometimes excessive, severity. Banderesi and antepositi had seats in the special council beside those of the&nbsp;reformers, as, in Florence, the gonfaloniers of the companies were seated beside the priors. Later these officials&nbsp;constituted the so-called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">signoriα dei banderesi.</span><span class="font0"> In&nbsp;1362, the Romans having subjected Velletri, which was&nbsp;defended by the nobles, the latter made a riot in Rome.&nbsp;Thereupon the banderesi drove them all from the city,&nbsp;killed some of their kindred, and did not even spare the&nbsp;cavallerotti. The fight became so furious that from gate&nbsp;to gate all Rome w<sup>y</sup>as in arms, and even mercenaries were&nbsp;hired. But in the end renewed submission was made to&nbsp;the pope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On the death of Innocent VI. in 1362, an agreement was concluded with his successor Urban V. (1362-70), also&nbsp;a Frenchman, who was obliged to give his sanction to the&nbsp;government of the reformers and banderesi. And then,&nbsp;Albornoz being recalled in disgrace to Avignon, and afterwards sent as legate to Naples, these Roman magistrates&nbsp;were able, with or without the co-operation of the foreign&nbsp;senator, to rule in their own way. They did justice on&nbsp;the nobles by hanging a few more ; and they defended&nbsp;the city from the threatening attacks of the mercenaries,&nbsp;who had now become Italy’s worst foes. It was at this&nbsp;period that the Roman statutes were revised and rearranged in the compilation erroneously attributed by&nbsp;some writers to Albornoz, which has come down to us&nbsp;supplemented by alterations of a later date.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But now the popes, being no longer in safety at Avignon, really decided to return to Italy. Even Urban</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">V. had to pay ransom to escape from the threatened&nbsp;attacks of the free companies. The Romans implored his&nbsp;return, and he was further urged to it by the Italian&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">literati</span><span class="font0"> with Petrarch at their head. In April 1367 he&nbsp;finally quitted Avignon, and, entering Rome on the 16th&nbsp;October, was given the lordship of the city. Cardinal&nbsp;Albornoz had fallen mortally ill at Viterbo, but, though&nbsp;unable to accompany the pope to Rome, had, before dying,&nbsp;suggested his course of action. Certainly Urban showed&nbsp;much acumen in profiting by the first burst of popular&nbsp;enthusiasm to effect quick and dexterous changes in the&nbsp;constitution of the republic. After naming a senator, he&nbsp;abolished the posts of reformers and banderesi, substituting&nbsp;three conservators, or rather a species of municipal council,&nbsp;alone charged with judicial and administrative powers,&nbsp;which has lasted to the present day. The thirteen leaders&nbsp;of the regions and the consuls of the guilds still sat in the&nbsp;councils, which were left unsuppressed. But all real power&nbsp;was in the hands of the pope, who, in Rome, as in his other&nbsp;cities, nominated the principal magistrates. Thus, by&nbsp;transforming political into civil institutions and concentrating the supreme authority in his own grasp, Urban V.&nbsp;dealt a mortal blow to the liberties of Rome. Yet he felt&nbsp;no sense of security among a people who, after the first&nbsp;rejoicings over the return of the Holy See, were always on&nbsp;the brink of revolt. Besides he felt himself a stranger in&nbsp;Italy, and was so regarded. Accordingly, in April 1370&nbsp;he decided to return to France; on the 20th of that month&nbsp;he wrote from Viterbo that no change was to be made in&nbsp;the government; and he died in Avignon on the 19th of&nbsp;December.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Romans retained the conservators, conferring on them the political power of the reformers ; they re-established the banderesi with the Florentine title of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">executores&nbsp;justitiαe</span><span class="font0"> and the four antepositi with that of consiliarii.&nbsp;Thus the “ Felix Societas Balestrariorum et Pavesatorum&nbsp;Urbis ” was restored, and the two councils met as before.&nbsp;The new French pope, Gregory XI. (1370-78), had to be&nbsp;content with obtaining supremacy over the Senate and&nbsp;the possession of the Castle St Angelo. It was a difficult&nbsp;moment for him. The Florentines had come to an open&nbsp;rupture with his legates, and had adopted the expedient of&nbsp;inviting all the cities of the Roman state to redeem their lost&nbsp;freedom. Accordingly in 1375 many of them rose against&nbsp;the legates, who were mostly French and regarded with&nbsp;dislike as foreigners. Florentine despatches, full of classical&nbsp;allusions and chiefly composed by the famous scholar,&nbsp;Secretary Coluccio Salutati, were rapidly sent in all&nbsp;directions. Those addressed to the Romans were specially&nbsp;fervid, and emphatically appealed to their patriotism and&nbsp;memories of the past. But the Romans received them&nbsp;with doubt and mistrust, for they saw that the revolution&nbsp;threatened to dismember the state, by promoting the&nbsp;independence of every separate city. Besides, while&nbsp;maintaining their republic, they also desired the pope’s presence in Rome. Nevertheless they went with the current&nbsp;to the extent of reforming their constitution. In February&nbsp;1376 they nominated Giovanni Cenci captain of the people,&nbsp;and gave him uncontrolled power over the towns of the&nbsp;patrimony and the Sabine land. The conservators, with&nbsp;their new political authority, the executores, the antepositi,&nbsp;and the two councils were all preserved, and a new magistracy was created, the “Très Gubernatores Pacis et&nbsp;Libertatis Reipublicae Romanae. ” This answered to the&nbsp;Eight (afterwards Ten) of War in Florence, likewise&nbsp;frequently called the Eight of Liberty and Peace. It was&nbsp;this Council of Eight that was now directing the war&nbsp;against the pope and braving his sentence of excommunication ; and their fiery zeal had won them the title of the&nbsp;Holy Eight from the Florentines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Realizing that further absence would cost him his state, Gregory XI. quitted Avignon on the 13th September&nbsp;1376, and, reaching Corneto in December, despatched to</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
