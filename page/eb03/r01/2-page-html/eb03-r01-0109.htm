<p><span class="font1">which reaſon they kill </span><span class="font0">it whenever they perceive this </span><span class="font1">retardation. But in what manner the remora performs&nbsp;this, we have no account.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">REMORSE, in its worſt ſenſe, means that pain or anguiſh which one feels after having committed fome&nbsp;bad action. It alſo means tenderneſs, pity, or ſym-pathetic forrow. It is moſt generally uſed in a bad&nbsp;ſenfe, and is applied to perſons who feel compunction&nbsp;for feme great crime, as murder and ſuch like. Mur-ders which have been committed with the utmoſt cir-cumſpection and ſecrecy, and the authors of which&nbsp;could never have been diſcovered by any human inveſtigation, have bcen frequently unfolded by the remorſe&nbsp;and confeſſion of the perpetrators, and that too many&nbsp;years afterwards. Οί this there are numerous inſtances,&nbsp;which are well authenticated, and which are ſo generally&nbsp;known that it is needleſs to relate them here. See Repentance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">REMPHAN, an idol or Pagan god whom St Stephen ſays the Iſraelites worſhipped in the wilderneſs as they paſſed from Egypt to the land of Promiſe : “Yea,&nbsp;ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the ſtar of&nbsp;your god Remphan ; figures which ye made to worſhip&nbsp;them.” That the martyr here quotes the foIlowing&nbsp;words of the prophet Amos, all commentators are a-greed : &quot; Ye have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch,&nbsp;and Chiun your images, the ſtar of your god, which&nbsp;ye made to yourfelves.” But if this coincidence be-tween the Chriſtian preacher and the Jewiſh prophet&nbsp;be admitted, it follows, that </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chiun</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Remphan</span><span class="font1"> are&nbsp;two names of one and the fame deity. This is indeed&nbsp;farther evident from the </span><span class="font0">LXX </span><span class="font1">tranſlators having ſub-ſtituted in their verſion the word ι<sup>,</sup>α&lt;i&gt;α&gt;'<sub>j</sub> inſtead of&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chiun,</span><span class="font1"> which we read in the Hebrew and Engliſh&nbsp;Bibles. But the queſtion which ſtill remains to be anſwered is, what god was worſhipped by the name of&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Remphan, Raiphan,</span><span class="font1"> cr </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chiun ?</span><span class="font1"> for about the other divi-nity here mentioned there is no difputc. See Moloch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">That </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chiun</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Remphan</span><span class="font1"> was an Egyptian divinity, cannot be queſtioned ; for at the era of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Exodus</span><span class="font1"> the&nbsp;Hebrews muſt have been ſtrangers to the idolatrous worſhip of all other nations ; nor are they ever accuſed of&nbsp;any other than Egyptian idolatries during their 40&nbsp;years wanderings in the wilderneſs, till towards the end&nbsp;of that period that they became infected by the Moa-bites with the worſhip of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Baal-peor.</span><span class="font1"> That </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Moloch, Mo-leck, Melek,</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Milcom,</span><span class="font1"> in its original acceptation denotes&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">king</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chief,</span><span class="font1"> is known to every oriental ſcholar ; and&nbsp;therefore when it is uſed as the name of a god, it undoubtedly ſignifies the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">fun,</span><span class="font1"> and is the fame divinity&nbsp;with the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Egyptian Oβris.</span><span class="font1"> Reaſoning in this way many&nbsp;critics, and we believe Selden is in the number, have&nbsp;concluded that </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chiun,</span><span class="font1"> and of courſe </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Remphan,</span><span class="font1"> is the&nbsp;planet </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Saturn ;</span><span class="font1"> becauſe </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chiun</span><span class="font1"> is written </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ciun, Cevaη,&nbsp;Ceuan, Chevvin ;</span><span class="font1"> all of which are modern oriental names&nbsp;of that planet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But againſt this hypotheſis inſurmountable objections preſent themſelves to our minds. It is univerſally allowed (ſee Polytheism), that the firſt objects of idolatrous worſhip were theÿh» and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">moon,</span><span class="font1"> conſidered</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">as the king and queen </span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font1">heaven. The fixed ſtars, indeed, and the planets, were afterwards gradually admit -ted into the Pagan rubric ; but we may be ſure that thoſe would be firſt aſſociated with the two prime luminaries which moſt refembled them in brightneſs, and&nbsp;were ſuppoſed to be moſt benignant to man. But&nbsp;the planet Saturn appears to the naked eye with ſo&nbsp;feeble a luſtre, that, in the infancy of aſtronomy, it&nbsp;could not make ſuch an impreffidn on the mind as to&nbsp;excite that admiration which we muſt conceive to have&nbsp;always preceded planetary worſhip. It is to be ob-ſerved, too, that by the Pagan writers of antiquity&nbsp;Saturn is conſtantly repreſented as a ſtar of baleful influence. He is termed the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">leaden planet ;</span><span class="font1"> the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">planet of&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">malevolent afpect <sub>i</sub></span><span class="font1">  the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">difmal,</span><span class="font1"> the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">inhumaneβar.</span><span class="font1"> That&nbsp;the Egyptians, at ſo early a period as that under conſi-deration, ſhould have adored as one of their greateſt&nbsp;g®ds a planet obfcure in its appearance, diſtant in its&nbsp;ſituation, and baleful in its influence, is wholly incredible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There is, however, another ſtar which they might naturally adore, and which we know they actually did&nbsp;adore, as one of their moſt beneficent gods, at a very&nbsp;early period. This is the ασ7fαxvω∕ <sub>or</sub> </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">σnςu&gt;ς</span><span class="font1"> <sub>0</sub>f the&nbsp;Greeks, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">earns</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">βella canicularis</span><span class="font1"> of the Romans,&nbsp;and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">dog-βar</span><span class="font1"> of modern Eurbpe. By the Egyptians it was called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sothis</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Soth,</span><span class="font1"> which ſignifies y⅛∕i√y,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">beηeβeηce, fecundity ;</span><span class="font1"> and it received this name, becauſe&nbsp;making its appearance ip the heavens at the very time&nbsp;when the Nile overflowed the country, it was ſuppoſed&nbsp;to regulate the inundation. Οη this account Plutarch </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(If.&nbsp;et Oβr.}</span><span class="font1"> tells us, they believed the foul of their illuſtrious&nbsp;benefactreſs </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ifis</span><span class="font1"> to have tranſmigrated into the ftar0'o∕Z&gt;zj,∙&nbsp;which they therefore worſhipped as the divinity which&nbsp;rendered their country fruitful. It made its appearance, too, on the firſt day of the month </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Thοth(K),</span><span class="font1"> which·&nbsp;was the beginning of the Egyptian year, and as ſuch&nbsp;celebrated with feaſting and feſtivity ; and being by&nbsp;much the brighteſt ſtar in the heavens, Horopollo&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(cap.</span><span class="font1"> 3.) informs us it was conſidered as ſovereign&nbsp;over the reſt. A combination of fo many import-ant circumſtances might have induced a people leſs ſuperſtitious than the Egyptians to pay divine homage&nbsp;to that glorious luminary, which was confounded with&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Iβs,</span><span class="font1"> who had been long regarded with the higheſt ve-neration ; and as Iſis was the wife and lifter of oſiris,&nbsp;and always aſſociated with him, the ſtar of Iſis or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Remphan</span><span class="font1"> was naturally aſſociated with </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Moloch,</span><span class="font1"> the fame with·&nbsp;oſiris.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But it will be aſked, how the ſtar which by the E-gyptians was called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Soth</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sothis</span><span class="font1"> came to be woiſhip-ped by the Hebrews under the appellation of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chiun</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Remphan ?</span><span class="font1"> This is a very pertinent queſtion, and we ^&nbsp;ſhall endeavour to anſwer it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Every one knows that the pronunciation of oriental, words is very uncertain ; and that as the vowels were&nbsp;often omitted in writing, it is of very little importance&nbsp;to the meaning how they be ſupplied, provided we re-tain the radical conſonants. The word </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chiun</span><span class="font1"> may with&nbsp;equal propriety be written </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Kiun, Kion,</span><span class="font1"> or even </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Kyoη,</span></p><div><a name="caption1"></a><h3><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">(a)</span><span class="font0"> This was the caſe at a very remote period ; but- it is otherwiſe at preſent, owing to the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">Precession</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"> of the Equinoxes.</span><span class="font0"> See that article.</span></h3></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
