<p><label>REMBRANDT</label>
(Van Rhin), a Flemiſh painter and engraver of great eminence, was born in 16c6, in a mill upon the banks of the Rhine, from whence he derived his name of <hi rend="italic">Van Rhin.</hi> This maſter was born -with a creative- genius, which never attained perfection. It was ſaid of him, that he" would have invent" ed painting, if he had not found it already difcovered, without ſtudy, without the aſſiſtance of any maſter, but by his- own inſtinctj he formed rules, and a certain practical method for colouring ; and the mixture produced the defιgκed effect. Nature is not ſet off to the greateſt advantage in his pictures; but there is ſuch. a ſtriking truth and ſimplicity in them,, that his heads, particularly his - portraits, ∙. ſeem animated, and rifing from the canvas. He was fond of ſtrong contraſts of light and fiιade⅛ The light entered in his working-room only by a hole, in- the manner of a camera obſcura, by which he judged with greater certainty of his product</p><p>■ tions...

<p>*where the characters do not ſtrike <hi rend="sup">,</hi> unlefs they are exaggerated. He did not purſue the method of the Fle-milh painters of ſiniſhing his pieces. He fometimes gave his light ſuch thick touches, that it ſeemed more like modelling than painting. A head of his has been ſhown, the noſe of which was fo thick of paint, as that which he copied from nature. He was told one day, that by his peculiar method of employing colours, his pieces appeared rugged and uneven—he replied, he was a painter, and not a dyer. He took a pleaſure in dreſſing his figures in an extraordinary manner : with this view he had collected a great number of eaſtern caps, ancient armour, and drapery long ſince out of faſhion. when he was adviſed to conſult antiquity to attain a better taſte in drawing, as his was uſually heavy and uneven, he took his counſellor to the cloſet where theie old veſtments were depoſited, -faying, by way of deri-ſion, thoſe were his antiques.</p><p>Rembrandt, like moſt men of genius, had many caprices. Being one day at work, painting a whole family in a ſingle picture, word being brought him that his monkey was dead, he was ſo affected at the loſs of this animal, that, without paying any attention to the perſons who were fitting for their pictures, he painted the monkey upon the ſame canvas. This whim could not ſail of diſpleafing thoſe the piece was deſigned for; but he would not efface it, chooſing rather to loſe the dale of his picture.</p><p>This freak will appear ſtill more extraordinary in Rembrandt, when it is conſidered that hc was extremely avaricious ; which vice daily grew upon him. He practiſed various ſtratagems to Fell his prints at a high price. The public were very deſirous of purchafing them, and not without reaſon. In his prints the ſame taſte prevails as in his pictures ; they are rough and irregular, but pictureſque. In order to heighten the value of his prints, and increaſe their price, he made his ſon fell them as if he had purloined them from his father ; others he expofed at public ſales, and went thither himſelf in diſguſſe to bid ſor them ; ſometimes fie gave out that he was going to leave Holland, and iettle in another conntry. Theſe ſtratagems were ſuc-eeſsful, and he got his own price for his prints. At other times he would print his plates half finiſhed, and expoſe them to ſale ; he afterwards finiſhed them, and they became ſrtſh plates, when they wanted retouch-ing, he made ſome alterations in them, which promoted the ſale of his prints a third time, though they differed but little ſrom the firſt impreſſions.</p><p>His pupils, who were not ignorant of his avarice, one day painted ſome pieces of money upon cards ; and Rembrandt no ſooner ſaw them, than he was going to take them up. Hc was not angry at the pleaſantry, but his avarice ſtill prevailed. He died in 1674.</p>
