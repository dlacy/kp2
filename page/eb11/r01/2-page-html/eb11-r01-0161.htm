<p><span class="font3">acanthus leaves; but the rest of the church is due to native architects. The lofty presbytery and the crypt under it belong&nbsp;to the 12th century. The walls of the interior were stripped&nbsp;of their marble panelling by Sigismondo Malatesta in 1449, for&nbsp;the adornment of his church at Rimini. The apse has mosaics&nbsp;of the 6th and 7th centuries. The 18th-century series of portraits of the archbishops of Ravenna is no doubt copied from&nbsp;an earlier original. There are a number of fine carved sarcophagi&nbsp;in the church (5th to 8th century). The building activity of&nbsp;the Gothic kings was continued by Justinian, to whose time we&nbsp;owe the completion of S. Vitale and S. Apollinare in Classe, and&nbsp;some of the mosaics in S. Appollinare Nuovo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The buildings of a subsequent period are of minor im-portance, but the basilica of S. Maria in Porto near the ancient harbour (1096 sqq.), a basilica with open roof, with&nbsp;frescoes by masters of the Rimini school, may be noticed. The&nbsp;massive concrete substructures of the campanile are attributed&nbsp;to an old lighthouse. The tomb of Dante, who died at Ravenna&nbsp;in 1321, is close to S. Francesco; it is a square-domed structure,&nbsp;with a relief by Pietro Lombardo (1482) representing the poet,&nbsp;and a sarcophagus below, in an urn within which lie the poet’s&nbsp;remains. Close by is a small court with early Christian sarcophagi, containing the remains of the Braccioforte family. The&nbsp;secularized monastery of Classe, in the town, built by the monks&nbsp;of S. Apollinare in Classe in 155 sqq. as a refuge from the malaria,&nbsp;which prevailed at Classe itself, with fine 17th-century cloisters,&nbsp;contains the important museum, which has Roman and By-zantine antiquities, inscriptions, sculptures, jewelry, &amp;c.—&nbsp;including the possible remains of a suit of gold armour of&nbsp;Theodoric—and a collection of Italian woodcuts; also the&nbsp;library with rare MSS. and incunabula (among the former the&nbsp;best extant MS. of Aristophanes). The Accademia, close by,&nbsp;has a few pictures by local masters, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">c.g.</span><span class="font3"> N. Rondinelli (end of&nbsp;15th century), of no great importance, and a fine recumbent&nbsp;statue of Guidarello Guidarelli, a condottiero of Ravenna, and&nbsp;a partisan of Caesar Borgia (d. 1501), by Tullio Lombardo (?)&nbsp;or Severo da Ravenna (?).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the Piazza Vittorio Emanuele are two granite columns erected by the Venetians, in 1483, with statues of SS. Apollinaris&nbsp;and Vitalis. The cloisters of S. Maria di Porto erected in the&nbsp;town in the 16th century (owing to malaria, as in the case of those&nbsp;of Classe), and of S. Vitale, are pleasing 16th-century structures.&nbsp;The 15th-century castle in the north-east corner of the town&nbsp;erected by the Venetians is a picturesque brick building. The&nbsp;famous </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">pineto</span><span class="font3"> or pinewood of Ravenna, which already existed&nbsp;in Odoacer’s time, and has been sung by poets since Dante, lies&nbsp;some 5 in. south of Ravenna.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">History.—</span><span class="font3">Strabo mentions </span><span class="font1">a </span><span class="font3">tradition that Ravenna was founded by Thessalians, who afterwards, finding themselves&nbsp;pressed by the Etrurians, called in their Umbrian neighbours&nbsp;and eventually departed, leaving the city to their allies. Pliny,&nbsp;on the other hand, calls it Sabine. Throughout the valley of&nbsp;the Po the Gauls took the place of the Etrurians as a conquering&nbsp;power; but Ravenna may possibly have retained its Umbrian&nbsp;character until, about the year 191 b.c., by the conquest of the&nbsp;Boii, the whole of this region passed definitely under the dominion&nbsp;of Rome. Either as a colonia or a municipium, Ravenna remained for more than two centuries an inconsiderable city of&nbsp;Gallia Cisalpina, chiefly noticeable as the place in which Caesar&nbsp;during his ten years’ command in Gaul frequently resorted in&nbsp;order to confer with his friends from Rome, and from which&nbsp;he started for his advance into Italy. At length under Augustus&nbsp;it suddenly rose into importance, when that emperor selected&nbsp;it as the station for his fleet on “ the upper sea.” Two hundred&nbsp;and fifty ships, said Dion (in a lost passage quoted by Jordanes),&nbsp;could ride at anchor in its harbour. At the same time Augustus&nbsp;conducted a branch of the Po (the fossa Augusta) through the&nbsp;city into the sea. It also became important for the export&nbsp;of timber from the Alps. Strabo, writing probably a few&nbsp;years after Ravenna bad been thus selected as a naval arsenal,&nbsp;gives us a description of its appearance which certainly corresponds more closely with modem Venice than with modern</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Ravenna. “ It is the largest of all the cities built in the lagoons, but entirely composed of wooden houses, penetrated in all&nbsp;directions by canals, wherefore bridges and boats are needed&nbsp;for the wayfarer. At the flow of the tide a large part of the sea&nbsp;comes sweeping into it; and thus, while all the muddy deposit&nbsp;of the rivers is swept away, the malaria is at the same time&nbsp;removed, and by this means the city enjoys so good a sanitary&nbsp;reputation that the government has fixed on it as a place for&nbsp;the reception and training of gladiators.” On the other hand,&nbsp;good water was proverbially difficult to obtain at Ravenna—&nbsp;dearer than wine, says Martial, who has two epigrams on the&nbsp;subject. Trajan, however, built an aqueduct nearly 20 miles long,&nbsp;which was restored by Theodoric in 503. Of this some traces&nbsp;still exist in the bed of the Ronco above Ravenna. Flics and&nbsp;frogs were also complained of, and Sidonius, writing in the&nbsp;5th century, complains bitterly of the “ feculent gruel ” (</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">cloacalis puls)</span><span class="font3"> which filled the canals of the city, and gave forth fetid&nbsp;odours when stirred by the poles of the bargemen. The port&nbsp;of Ravenna, situated about 3 miles from the city, was named&nbsp;Classis. A long line of houses called Caesarea connected it&nbsp;with Ravenna, and in process of time there was such a continuous series of buildings that the three towns seemed like&nbsp;one. It was a municipium under the Empire, as the inscriptions show, but it seems to have had magistrates rather suited&nbsp;to a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">υicus</span><span class="font3"> or village, its importance being due entirely to the&nbsp;naval station (cf. the state of things at </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Mediolanum,</span><span class="font3"> Milan).&nbsp;It had large gilds of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">fabri</span><span class="font3"> (smiths and carpenters) and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">centonarii&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">(firemen).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Of Roman Ravenna nothing remains above ground, though a little has been found by excavation, including a mosaic&nbsp;pavement at Classe near S. Severo (Ricci, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">οp. cit.</span><span class="font3"> p. 50). Among&nbsp;the tombs many of the poorer under the Empire were simply&nbsp;formed of amphorae, in which the body was placed. A pre-historic station was found in 1894 at S. Zaccaria near Ravenna,&nbsp;belonging to a Terramare (E. Brizio in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Nοtizie degli Scaυi,</span><span class="font3"> 1896,&nbsp;85). In </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">A.D. </span><span class="font3">339 it is spoken of as having previously been the&nbsp;chief town of Picenum, but having recently been assigned to&nbsp;Aemilia. It was connected with Ariminum, 33 miles to the&nbsp;south by the coast road, the Via Popillia, which ran on north&nbsp;to Hatria, and joined the road between Patavium and Altinum&nbsp;at Ad Portum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The great historical importance of Ravenna begins early in the 5th century, when Honorius, alarmed by the progress of&nbsp;Alaric in the north of Italy, transferred his court hither. From&nbsp;this date (404) to the fall of the Western Empire in 476 Ravenna&nbsp;was the chief residence of the Roman emperors. Here Stilicho&nbsp;was slain; here Honorius and his sister Placidia caressed and&nbsp;quarrelled; here Valentinian III. spent the greater part of his&nbsp;life; here Majorian was proclaimed; here the little Romulus&nbsp;donned his purple robe; here in the pinewood@@<sup>1</sup> outside the city&nbsp;his uncle Paulus received his decisive defeat from Odoacer.&nbsp;Through all these changes Ravenna maintained its character&nbsp;as an impregnable “ city in the sea,” not easily to be attacked&nbsp;even by a naval power on account of the shallowness and devious&nbsp;nature of the channels by which it had to be approached. Odoacer,&nbsp;like the emperors who had gone before him, made Ravenna his&nbsp;chief place of residence, and here he shut himself up when&nbsp;Theodoric the Ostrogoth had invaded Italy and defeated him&nbsp;in two battles. Theodoric’s siege of Ravenna lasted for three&nbsp;years (489-492), and was marked by one bloody encounter in the&nbsp;pinewood on the east of it. The Ostrogoth collected a fleet and&nbsp;established a severe blockade, which at length caused Odoacer&nbsp;to surrender the city. The terms, arranged through the intervention of John, archbishop of Ravenna, were not observed by</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>@@@1 </sup>The great pinewood to the east of the city, which is still one of the great glories of Ravenna, must therefore have been in existence already in the 5th century. Byron’s description,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“ [The] immemorial wood Rooted where once the Adrian wave flowed o’er,”&nbsp;is probably true; but there is no evidence that it was in historic&nbsp;time that this change took place. It may be conjectured that the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pineta grew</span><span class="font2"> on a large peninsula somewhat resembling the Lido</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">of Venice.</span></p><div style="border-right:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
