            <p>ROMFORD, a market-town of the county of Essex, in the parish of Hornchurch and
                hundred of Havering, eleven miles from London. The population was, in 1801, 3179; in
                1811, 3244 ; in 1821, 3777 ; and in 1831, 4294.</p>
            <p>ROMILLY, Samuel, one of the most enlightened and virtuous public men whom England has
                ever possessed, was, as his family-name indicates, the descendant of a
                French family. He was the son of a jeweller in London, and was born there on the 1st
                of March 1757.</p>
            <p>The education of this child, destined in time to occupy so distinguished a place, was
                conducted for some time with even less care than might have been expected from the
                station held by his family. But, heartily disliking his father’s business, he was at
                length allowed to change it for professional employments, though as yet in an
                inferior department. At the age of sixteen he was articled to one of the six clerks
                in chancery ; and in the easy mechanical duties of his master’s chambers, relieved
                by the zealous prosecution of his studies both in English and Latin, passed several
                years of his life. He then resolved on coming to the bar, a step which, he informs
                us, all his friends, with one exception, considered as highly imprudent. One
                circumstance which helped to determine Romilly was very interesting ; the purchase
                of a seat in the office in which he had been articled would have cost a sum which he
                knew it would be inconvenient for his father to advance.</p>
            <p>He had completed his twenty-first year when he entered himself at Gray’s Inn,
                becoming, at the same time, a pupil of an able equity-draftsman. General reading
                both in English and Latin, translation habitually practised from the latter language
                into the former, the composition of a few political essays for the newspapers, and
                occasional attendance on the houses of parliament, now alternated with a closeness
                of application to legal study, which, after a time, injured his health, and
                compelled him to retire, first to Bath, and afterwards to the continent. At Geneva
                he became acquainted with some of the men who were then beginning to attract notice
                in that city ; and, among acquaintances thus made, the most valuable was that of
                Dumont. After visiting some of the nearest scenery of the Leman Lake, and of Savoy,
                Romilly proceeded to Paris, where he met D’Alembert, Diderot, and other eminent
                men.</p>
            <p>On the last day of Easter term 1783, he was called to the bar. For some years
                afterwards, he obtained an increasing employment in the drawing of chancery
                pleadings ; but during this time, as he says himself, he had hardly once occasion to
                open his lips in court. In the spring of 1784, he went upon the midland circuit,
                which he continued to frequent until, even as admitted in his own modest Memoir, he
                was decidedly its leader. His chancery business, however, to which at length he
                entirely devoted himself, had become very great before he confined himself entirely
                to town ; and his principal reason for remaining so long on the circuit, is assigned
                by himself in one of his calmly characteristic expressions of honourable ambition :
                he desired to qualify himself for being a <hi rend="italic">judge.</hi></p>
            <p>Long before he left the circuit, he had attained a distinguished position in the eyes
                of those who were qualified to appreciate him, not merely as a lawyer, but as a
                statesman. In 1784, he became acquainted with Mirabeau, who was then in London, and
                of whose character he appears to have formed an exceedingly just estimate. Mirabeau
                was the medium through which Romilly became known to Lord Lansdowne, and thus to the
                leaders of that political party of which he had throughout been an honest and warm
                adherent. To that nobleman he was recommended, both by the hearty praises of
                Mirabeau, and by a pamphlet he had written, called “ A Fragment on the
                Constitutional Power and Duties of Juries.” Lord Lansdowne, directing Romilly’s
                attention to a recent sanguinary tract on Criminal Punishments, induced him to write
                an an-</p>
            <p>swer, which was published anonymously, under the title of “ Observations on a late
                Publication, entitled ‘ Thoughts on Executive Justice.’ ” In the mean time he
                continued vigorously to prosecute in private the inquiries into the Reform of the
                Laws, especially the Criminal Laws, of which he had thus begun to announce publicly
                the parts.</p>
            <p>In the vacation of 1788, he paid a third visit to Paris. Introductions from England,
                and other circumstances, brought Romilly and his fellow-traveller Dumont into
                intercourse, upon this occasion, with many men distinguished then, and with others
                still more celebrated in the bloody struggle that was about to ensue. Mirabeau at
                this time translated into French, and published, observations made by Romilly on the
                Hospital and Prison of Bicêtre. This pamphlet had the honour to be suppressed by the
                police of Paris, but in the original English was afterwards printed by the author
                himself in an obscure London periodical. In July 1789, Romilly wrote a pamphlet
                which was afterwards published ; “ Thoughts on the Probable Influence of the French
                Revolution on Great Britain.” But the lively interest he took in the events which
                emerged in Paris, while he was engaged in composing these remarks, led him back to
                that city in August of the same year ; and he now saw, both in public and private,
                many of the persons who had become most distinguished in the National Assembly.
                Dumont’s observations upon the eventful summer of 1789 in France, were translated
                into English by Romilly, and, with the addition of some observations by himself on
                England, were published in 1792, receiving the title of “ Groenvelt’s Letters.” Many
                of Romilly’s opinions on the progress of the French Revolution are contained in
                his published correspondence with Dumont, Madame Gautier, Dugald Stewart, and
                others, and in a diary which he kept during a journey to Paris in the autumn of
                1802.</p>
            <p>While Romilly was thus advancing to the highest rank in his profession, and had
                gained the confidence and admiration of some of the best statesmen in England, his
                domestic position underwent a most beneficial change, the immediate cause of which
                was a visit paid to Lord Lansdowne. In his private Memoirs he thus speaks of a
                person whom he accidentally met on this occasion. “ I saw in her the most beautiful
                and accomplished creature that ever blessed the sight and understanding of man. A
                most intelligent mind, an uncommonly correct judgment, a lively imagination, a
                cheerful disposition, a noble and generous way of thinking, an elevation and heroism
                of character, and a warmth and tenderness of affection, such as is rarely found even
                in her sex, were among her extraordinary endowments. I was captivated alike by the
                beauties of her person and the charms of her mind. A mutual attachment was formed
                betwecn us, which at the end of little more than a year was consecrated by marriage.
                All the happiness I have known in her beloved society, all the many and exquisite
                enjoyments which my dear children have afforded me, even my extraordinary success in
                my profession, the labours of which, if my life had not been so cheered and
                exhilarated, I never could have undergone,— all are to be traced to this trivial
                cause.” The object of this beautiful eulogium was the eldest daughter of Mr Gar-bett
                of Knill Court in Herefordshire. His marriage with this lady took place in January
                1798, when he had nearly completed his forty-first year.</p>
            <p>He continued to be chiefly occupied in the discharge of his duties as a leader of the
                Chancery bar for several years, after which he united with these the other
                avocations that have given to his name so distinguished a place in the list
                of British statesmen. In the autumn of 1805 he had received from the Prince of Wales
                the offer of a seat in parliament, which he declined upon grounds strongly marking
                his sturdy independence of character. These reasons were the same which, many years
                before, had made him interfere to prevent a similar offer from being addressed to
                him by Lord</p>
