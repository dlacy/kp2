<hi rend="smallcaps">Thomas</hi> (1605-1634), an English poet, was born in Northamptonshire in 1605. He was educated at Westminster and Cambridge, and soon gave promise as a writer of comedy. Ben Jonson, not an easily satisfied critic, adopted him as one of his “ sons.” The ease and melody of his verse and the quickness of his wit and fancy justify the favour with which the youth was received by the magnates of literature. Unhappily he died under thirty in 1634, before his powers had reached their maturity. His principal works are— <hi rend="italic">The Muses’ Looking-Glass, a Comedy ״, Amyntas, or the Impossible Dowry,</hi> a pastoral acted before the king and queen ; <hi rend="italic">Aristippus, or the Jovial Philosopher״, The Conceited Pedlar; The Jealous Lovers, a Comedy; Hey for Honesty, down with Knavery, a Comedy״,</hi> and several other poems. His w־orks have recently been edited by W. Carew Hazlitt.</p>
