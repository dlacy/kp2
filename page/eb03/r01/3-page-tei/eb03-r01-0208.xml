General Clairfait bad joined him with 15,000 Auſtrians, and a conſiderable body of Heſſians, along with 20,000 French emigrants; amounting in all to 90,000 men. To oppoſe theſe, Dumourier had only j 7,000 men collected near the point from which thc enemy were approaching in I^uxemboulg. The French emigrants had given the duke of Brunſwick- ſuch an account of the diffracted ſtate of their own country, and of the pretended diſaf-fection of ail orders of men towards the ruling faction in Paris, tliat no reſiſtance of any importance was expected. when the combined troops, conſiſting either of ſteady Auſtrian or Hungarian battalions, or of tliofe well diſciplinecl Pruffians wliich the great Frederick had inured to the beſt military diſcipline, were reviewed in Germany before ſetting out on their march, it is faid that the ſpectators, among whom tlic French canſe was not unpopular, beheld them with anxiety and regret, and pitied the unhappy conntry againſt which this irreſiſtible force was directed. The ſoldiers and their officers regarded themſelves as departing for a hunting match, or an e-xcurſion of pleaſure ; and many of the uſual accommodations of an army were ill attended to, ſuch as hoſpitals, &amp;c. The beginning of their progreſs into France juſtiſied theſe expectations. Long-wy ſurrendered after a ſiege of <hi rend="italic">15</hi>  hours, although well fortified, poffeffed of a garrifon of 3500 men, and defended by 71 pieces of cannon. The news of this event irritated the aſſembly fo much, that they decreed; that, when retaken, the houſes of the citizens ſhonld be razed to the ground ; and,, diſtruftful of the officers of the army, they decreed that the municipal officers of a town ſhould hereafter have power to controul the de-liberations of the- council of war. Verdun was next ſummoned ; and here the municipality compelled the governor M. Bèaurepiare to ſurrender. That officer, diſappointed and enraged, ſhot himſelf dead with a pi-ſtol in preſence of the council, and on the 2d of Sep-tember the Pruffian troops entered the town.</p><p>The news of this ſecond capture, and of the ap-p-roach of the Pruffians, fpread an ſuſſant alarm through Paris. It was propoſed to raiſe a volunteer army, which ſhould ſet out immediately to meet the enemy. The -common council, which was now led by Robefpierre, Danton, Marat, and others of the moſt ſanguinary character, ordered the alarm-guns to be fired, and the populace to be ſummoned- to meet in the Champ de Mars to enroll themſelves to march againſt the enemy. The people aſſembled, and either in conſequence of a premeditated plan, or, which is not very probable, of an inſtantaneous movement, a number of voices exclaimed, that " the domeſtic foes of the na-tion ought to be deſtroyed before its foreign enemies were attacked.”</p><p>Parties of armed men proceeded without delay to the priſons where the non-juring clergy, the Swiſs offi-cers, and thoſe confined ſince the 10th of Auguſt on account of practices againſt the ſtate, were detained in cuſtody. They took out the priſoners one by one, gave them a kind of mock trial before a jury of them-ſelves, acquitted ſome few, and murdered the reft. A-mong theſe laſt was the princeſs de Lamballe. She was taken from her bed before this bloody tribunal, and maffacred; her head was carried by the populace to the Temple, to be ſeen by the queen, whoſe friend ſhe was.</p><p>Thefe maſſacrcs laſted for two days, and upwards oſ 1000 perfons were put to death. There is ſcarce any thing in hiſtory that can be repreſented as parallel to them ; they were committed, it is ſaid, by lefs than 300 men, in the midſt of an immenſe city, which heard of them with horror, and in the vicinity of thc national affembly, which, by going in a body, could have put an end to them. But ſuch was the confuſion and diſmay of theſe two diſgraceſul days, that no man dared to ſtir ſrom his own houſe ; and every one belie-ved that the whole city, excepting his own ſtreet, was engaged in maffacre and bloodſhed. The national guards were all ready at their reſpective poſts, but no man directed them to act : and there is too much reaſon· to ſuſpect that Santerre and the chiefs of the com-mune connived, at leaſt, at the tranſaction.</p><p>In the mean time, general Dumourier was taking the beſt meafures to protract the march of the enemy till the army of Kellerman, conſiſting of 20,000 men, could join him from Lorraine, and that of Bournonville from Flanders, amounting to 13,000; together with whatever new levies Luckner might be able to ſend him from Chalons. The foreſt of Argonne extends from north to ſouth upwards of 40 miles ; it lay direct-ly in the route of the duke of Brunſwick, who muſt either force his way acroſs it, or make a circuit of 40 miles by the paſs of Grandpré on the north, or by Bar-leduc on tbe ſouth. The paſs that lay directly in his route was that of Bieſme. After ſurveying Dillon’s poſition here, he left a party of 20,000 men to watch it ; and with the main body of his army took the cir-cuitous rout by Grandpré on the north. Here Du-mourier waited to receive him, and was attacked on the 12th and 13th without ſucceſs: but on the 14th, the attack of the Pruffians was irreſiſtible, and Dumourier retreating, gave up the paſs. On his march he was ſo violently preffed by the advanced cavalry of the Pruſ-ſians, that his army, at one time, was ſeized with a pa* nic, and fled before 1500 men ; who, if they had puſh-ed their advantage, might have diſperſed it. On the 15th, however, Dumourier encamped at St Menehould, and began to fortify it. Bournonville’s army joined Dumourier on the 17th. The duke ef Brunſwick formed a plan of attacking Kellerman before his junc-tion could be completed. That general arrived on the 19th within a mile of Dumourier’s camp ; the project-ed attack took place ; the Pruffians, manoeuvred- with thcir ufual coolneſs and addreſs ; they attempted to ſurround Kellerman’s army, but this could not be ac-compliſhed. The French troops- preſerved excellent order, while the national vivacity was conſtantly ſhowing itſelf in their ſhouts and patriotic ſongs : 40O French were killed, and 500 wounded ; the lofs of the Pruffians was much greater : and,, in the face of the enemy, Kellerman joined Dumourier at the end of the engagement without oppoſition. At the time that the attack was made on the army of Kellerman, an at-tempt was made to force Dillon’s camp at Bieſme by the 20,000 men that had been left in its vicinity, but without ſucceſs ; and this large detachment was thus prevented from croffing the foreſt of Argonne and join-ing the dnke of Brunſwick. It is to be obſerved, that</p><p>. in theſe engagements the French owed their ſuperiority chiefly to the excellence of their artillery ; a circum-ftance which ſerved to convince their enemies that they</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
