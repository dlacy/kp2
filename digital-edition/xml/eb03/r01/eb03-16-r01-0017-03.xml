<p><label>RAY</label>
(John), a celebrated botaniſt, was the ſon of Mr Roger Ray a blackſmith, and was born at Black Notly in Eſſex in 1628. He received the ſirſt rudiments of learning at the grammar-ſchool at Braintree ; and in 1644 <hi rend="sup">was</hi> admitted into Catharine hall in Cambridge, from whence he afterwards removed to Trinity college in that univerſity. He took the degree of maſter of arts, and became at length a ſenior fellow of the college ; but his intenſe application to his ſtudies having injured his health, he was obliged at his leiſure hours to exerciſe himſelf by riding or walking in the fields, which led him to the ſtudy of plants. He noted from Johnſon, Parkinſon, and the <hi rend="italic">Phytologia Britannica,</hi> the places where curious plants grew ; and in 1658 rode from Cambridge to the city of Cheſter, from whence he went into North wales, viſiting many places, and among others the famous hill of Snowdon ; returning by Shrewhury and Glouceſter. In 1660 he publiſhed his <hi rend="italic">Catalogus Plantarum circa Cantabrigiam naf-centium,</hi> and the ſame ycar w’as ordained deacon and prieſt. In 1661 he accompanied Francis willoughby, Eſq; and others in ſearch of plants and other natural curioſities, in the north of England and Scotland ; and the next year made a weſtern tour from Cheſter, and through wales, to Cornwall, Devonſhire, Dorfetſhire, Hampſhire, wiltſhire, and other counties. He afterwards travelled with Mr willoughby and other gen-tlemen through Holland, Germany, Italy, France, &amp;c. took ſeveral tours in England, and was admitted fellow of the Royal Society. In 1672, his intimate and beloved friend Mr willoughby died in the 37th year of his age, at Middleton Hall, his ſeat in Yorkſhire ;</p><p>" to the infinite and unſpeakable loſs and grief (ſays Mr Ray) of myſelf, his friends, and all good men.” There having been the cloſeſt and ſincereſt friendſhip between Mr willoughby and Mr Ray, who were men of fimilar natures and taſtes, from the time of their being fellow collegians, Mr willoughby not only confided in Mr Ray, in his lifetime, but alſo at his death : for he made him one of the executors of his will, and -charged him with the education of his fons Francis and</p><p>Thomas, leaving him alſo for life 60 Ï. per annum. I he eldeſt of theſe young gentlemen not being four years of age, Mr Ray, as a faithful truſtee, betook himſelf to the inſtruction of them ; and for their uſe compoſed his <hi rend="italic">Nomenclator Claficus,</hi> which was pub'iſh-ed this very year, 1672. Francis the eldeſt dying before he was of age, the younger became Lord Middle-ton. Not many months after the death of Mr willoughby, Mr Ray loſt another of his beſt friends, bi-ſhop wilkins ; whom he viſited in London the 8th of November 1672, and found near expiring by a total ſuppreffion of urine for eight days. As it is natural for the mind, when it is hurt in one part, to ſeek relief from another ; ſo Mr Ray, having loſt ſome oſ his beſt friends, and being in a manner left deſtitute, conceived thoughts of marriage ; and accordingly, in June <hi rend="sup">1</hi> 673, did actually marry a gentlewoman of about 20 years of age, the daughter of Mr o∏kley of Launton in oxfordſhire. Towards the end of this year, came forth his " obſervations Topographical, Moral, &amp;c.” made in foreign countries; to which was addcd his <hi rend="italic">Catalogue Stirpium in exteris regiοnibus obfervatarum :</hi> and about the ſame time, his <hi rend="italic">Collection oſ unuſual or local IsηgIfh wo <hi rend="sup">r</hi> ^ds,</hi> which he had gathered up in his travels through the counties of England. After having pub-hſhed many books on fubjects foreign to his profeffion, he at length reſolved to publiſh in the character of a divine, as well as in that of a natural philoſopher : in which view he publiſhed his excellent demonſtration of the being and attributes of God, entitled <hi rend="italic">The Wifdom ot God manſefled tn the Works oſ the Creation,</hi> 8vo, 1697. The rudiments of this work were read in ſome college lectures ; and another collection of the fame kind he enlarged and publiſhed under the title of <hi rend="italic">Three Pyficο-theοlogical Diſcourſes, concerning the Chaos, Deluge, and Diffolution of the World,</hi> 8vo, 1692. He died in 1705. He was modeſt, affable, and communicative ; and was</p><p>diſtinguiſhed by his probity, charity, fobriety, and piety. He wrote a great number of works ; the principal of which, beſides thoſe already mentioned, are, 1. <hi rend="italic">Catalogue Plantarum AηgIηε.</hi> 2. <hi rend="italic">Dictionariotum Trilinguefe-cundum locos communes.</hi> 3. <hi rend="italic">H'ιfloria Plantarum, Species, hactenus éditas, aliafque ιnfuper rnultas noviter inventas et defcriptas complectens,</hi> 3 vols. 4. <hi rend="italic">Methodus Plantarum nova, cum Tabulis,</hi> 8vo, and ſeveral other works on plants. 6. <hi rend="italic">Synopfis Methodica Animalium quadrupe-dum et Serpentini generis,</hi> 8vo⅛ 6. <hi rend="italic">Synopfis Methodica A-vium et Pifcium. η.
