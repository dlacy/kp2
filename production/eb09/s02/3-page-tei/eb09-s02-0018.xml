It is a city of contrasts—mediæval architecture of the true Swabian type and modern manufactures mingling curiously together. The cathedral, formerly the church of the abbey of All Saints (Allerheiligen), is a massive basilica founded in 1104 and completed in 1453; its great bell (1486) bears the inscription <hi rend="italic">Vivos voco, mortuos plango, fulgura frango,</hi> which suggested Schiller’s “Song of the Bell” and the opening of Longfellow’s <hi rend="italic">Golden Legend.</hi> On the Rebhügel above the town rises the castle of Munoth (1564-1590) with bomb-proof casemates, and a tower whose top is reached by a spiral ascent up which one can ride or drive. In Herrenacker Platz stands the Imthurneum, a building erected (1864) and presented to the town by a Swiss citizen, resident in London, for the “ promotion of æsthetic and scientific culture ” ; it contains a theatre, concert-rooms, &amp;c. The public library (28,000 volumes) possesses the printed and MS. collections of Johann von Müller, who was born at Schaffhausen in 1752, and his monument adorns the promenade of the Vesenstaub. In the museum is preserved the famous Keszlerloch “find.” Among the industrial establishments of the city and vicinity are ironworks, waggon and carriage factories, woollen and cotton factories, breweries, distilleries, and champagne factories. The population of the commune was 10,303 in 1870 and 11,795 in 1880.</p><p>Schaffhausen (Latinized as <hi rend="italic">Scafusia</hi> or Græcized into <hi rend="italic">Probatopolis) </hi>first appears in the 9th century, and had already attained the rank of an imperial city in 1264.</p><p>SCHALCKEN, <hi rend="smallcaps">Godfried</hi> (1643—1706), genre and portrait painter, was born at Dort in 1643, and studied under Van Hoogstraten, and afterwards under Gerhard Douw, whose works his earlier genre-pictures very closely resemble. He visited England and painted several portraits, of which the half-length of William III., now in the Museum, Amsterdam, is a good example. In this work he shows an effect of candle-light, which he also introduced— frequently with fine effect—in many of his subject-pictures. These may be studied in the collections at Buckingham Palace, the Louvre, Vienna, and Dresden. He executed several Scriptural subjects—such as that of the Wise and Foolish Virgins, at Munich—of very indifferent merit. He died at The Hague in 1706.</p><p>SCHAMYL <hi rend="italic">(f.e., </hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Samuel),</hi> prophet and hero of the Caucasian mountaineers, was born in 1797. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Caucasus, </hi>vol. V. p. 258. After his defeat and capture he passed ten years in Russia, where he was well treated. In 1870 he went on pilgrimage to Mecca, and died at Medina in March of the following year.</p><p>SCHANDAU, a small town of Saxony, is situated on the right bank of the Elbe, at the mouth of the little valley of the Kirnitzsch, 21 miles to the south-east of Dresden, and 4 miles from the Bohemian frontier. Its position in the heart of the romantic “Saxon Switzerland” gives it an importance to which on other grounds it is not entitled, and thousands of tourists make it their headquarters in summer. The stationary population in 1880 was 3301.</p><p>SCHARNHORST, <hi rend="smallcaps">Gerhard Johann David von </hi>(1756-1813), Prussian general, celebrated as the author of the so-called “ Krümpersystem,” or short-service system (see vol. ii. p. 594), by which the Prussian nation was prepared for the war of liberation, was a Hanoverian by birth, and served in the Hanoverian army from 1778 to 1801, when he passed into Prussian service, and soon became the leader in the reconstruction of its forces. In the war with France in 1813 he accompanied Blücher as ,</p><p>chief of the general staff, but received a severe wound in the first battle (Grossgörschen), which soon after was followed by his death. The first part of an extensive and important biography of Scharnhorst by Lehmann has recently appeared (Leipsic, 1886).</p><p>SCHÄSSBURG (Hung. <hi rend="italic">Segesvár),</hi> chief town of the Transylvanian county of Nagy-Küküllö, Hungary, stands on the river Nagy-Küküllö, 24 miles east-south-east of Maros-Vásárhely, in 46° 10' N. lat., 24° 47' E. long. It consists of two parts,—the one which formerly served as a fortress on the top of a hill, and the other in the valley below,—the two being connected by a covered passage. Schässburg is the seat of various public offices and of a district court of justice; its other institutions include a Franciscan convent, a Protestant upper gymnasium, a teachers’ institute and seminary, two savings banks, a free library, hospital, barracks, &amp;c. As a station on the eastern system of the Hungarian State Railways, Schässburg has a good woollen and linen trade, as well as exports of wine and fruit. Among its principal buildings an old Gothic church and the lofty town-hall are specially worthy of mention. The population in 1884 amounted to 8810, the majority being Germans (Saxons), and the remainder Roumanians and Hungarians.</p><p>Schässburg was founded by Saxon colonists at the end of the 12th century ; its Latin name was <hi rend="italic">Castrum Sex.</hi> The most important event in its history was the battle on the 31st July 1849, in which the Hungarian army under Bern was defeated by the overwhelming numbers of the Russian General Lüders. The great national poet, Petöfi, was last seen, and is generally believed to have met his end, in this engagement.</p><p>SCHAUMBURG-LIPPE. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Lippe.</hi></p><p>SCHEELE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Karl Wilhelm</hi> (1742-1786), an eminent chemist, was born at Stralsund, the capital of Pomerania, which then belonged to Sweden, on the 19th December 1742. His father was a merchant, and Karl Wilhelm was the seventh of a family of eleven. In due time the boy was sent to school, but he did not care for the languages, and as he showed a strong taste for pharmacy he was apprenticed at the age of fourteen to an apothecary in Gothenburg, called Bauch, with whom he stayed for eight years. He was thoughtful and silent, and very punctual and precise in discharge of his duties. His spare time and great part of his nights were devoted to the experimental examination of the different bodies which he dealt with, and the careful study of the standard works on chemistry. By these means he acquired a large store of knowledge and great practical skill and manipulative dexterity. In 1765 he removed to Malmö, and resided for five years with Kalström, an apothecary, whence he removed to Stockholm, to Scharenberg, also an apothecary. While here he wrote out an account of his experiments with cream of tartar, from which he had isolated tartaric acid, and sent it to Bergman, the leading chemist in Sweden. Bergman somehow neglected it, and this caused for a time a reluctance on Scheele’s part to become acquainted with that savant, but the paper, through the instrumentality of Retzius, was ultimately communicated to the Academy of Sciences at Stockholm. In 1771 Scheele finished an elaborate inquiry into the composition of the beautiful mineral fluor-spar, and showed that it consisted of lime and a peculiar acid which he called fluor acid. He misunderstood, however, the true character of the decomposition he had effected, and gave an erroneous explanation of it. His experiments had been conducted in glass vessels, and he was not aware that what he actually got was the fluo-silicic acid. This mistake was subsequently pointed out and corrected by some other chemists. He left Stockholm in 1773 and took up his residence at Upsala. Here he made the acquaintance of Gahn, assessor of mines at Fahlun, through whose mediation he was at length introduced to</p></body></text></TEI>
