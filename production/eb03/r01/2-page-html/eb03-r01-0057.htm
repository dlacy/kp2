<p><span class="font2">clination particularly led him, and his inquiries were not confined to any one part of it. His memoirs, his ob-ſervations, his diſcoveries on the formation of ſhells, ſpiders, muſcles, the marine-flea, the berry which affords&nbsp;tbe purple colour, and on the cauſe of the n,umbnefs of&nbsp;the torpedo, excited the curioſity of the public, and&nbsp;early procured our author the character of an able, curious, and entertaining naturaliſt:. Filled with zeal for&nbsp;the welfare and advantage of ſoeiety, and the progreſs&nbsp;and perfection of arts, he endeavoured in all his τe-ſearches to promote the public good. We were indebt-ed to him for the difcovery of the Turquois mines&nbsp;in Languedoc. Fie alſo found out a ſubſtance, which&nbsp;is. uſed to give falfe ſtones a colour, which is obtained&nbsp;from a certain ſiſh called in the French </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">dble</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ablete *&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">on account of its whiteneſs, and which is the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bleak</span><span class="font2"> or&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Blay</span><span class="font2"> of our writers fi. His experiments on the art of&nbsp;turning iron into ſteel obtained him a penſion of 12,oco&nbsp;livres ; and this reward was be continued to the Academy to ſupport the expence which might accrue in this&nbsp;art.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">He continued his inquiries on the art of making tin andporcelain£, and endeavoured to render our thermome-ters more uſeful than thoſe of former times : he compoſed&nbsp;a curious hiſtory of rivers where gold duſt is found in&nbsp;F rance ; and gave ſo ſimple and eaſy a detail of the art&nbsp;of gathering this duſt, that perſons have been employed&nbsp;for that purpofe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">He alſs made curious and important obfervations on tbe nature of flints, on the banks of foſſil ſhells, from&nbsp;whence is obtained in Touraine an excellent manure for&nbsp;land ; as likewiſe on birds and their preiervation·, on their&nbsp;method of budding neſts ; on infects ; and a great num-ber of other ſubjects, not leſs curious than uſeful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">He imagined at ſirſt, that a certain varniſh would keep eggs freſh ; but the waſte of time and money, &amp;c.&nbsp;ſhowed him the.inconveniences of ſuch a proceſs. He&nbsp;afterwards adopted the method practiſed for time imme-morial in Greece and the iſlands of the Archipelago,&nbsp;which is to ſteep or immerſe eggs in oil, or melted tat ;&nbsp;by this means, not being expofed to the air or to froſt,&nbsp;they are well preſerved, and contract no bad ſmell. An-other experiment ſtill more important, made by our au-thor, was to introduce into France the art of hatching&nbsp;fowl and birds, as practiſed in Egypt, without covering&nbsp;the eggs. Active, ſedulous, and attentive, he was ear-ly in his ſtudy, often at ſix in the morning. Exact in&nbsp;his experiments and obfervations, he let no circumftance&nbsp;efcape him. His writings muſt be of great uſe to future&nbsp;philoſophers. In ſociety, he was diſtinguiſhed through&nbsp;life for his modeſt and agreeable behaviour. His probity, benevolence, goodnefs oſ heart, and other ami-able qualities, as well natural as acquired, endeared&nbsp;him to his countrymen. He di d in the 76th year of&nbsp;his age, on the 18th of october 1757, and left this&nbsp;world -filled with ſentiments of piety. His death was&nbsp;the conſequence of a fall, which happened at the caſtle&nbsp;of Barnardiere on the Maine, where he went to pafs his&nbsp;vacation. He bequeathed to the Academy of Sciences&nbsp;his manuſcripts ajjd all his natural productions. His&nbsp;works are, 1. A very great number of memoirs and&nbsp;«bſervations on different parts of natural hiſtory ; they&nbsp;are printed in the collections of the Academy of Sciences.&nbsp;≤. A large work printed feparately in 6 vols in 4to, in-titled, A Natural Hiſtory of Infects. This important</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font2">work contain? a defcription of vaſt numbers of câterpil-lers, moths⅛ gall infects, flies with two and four wings, lady-birds, and thoſe ephεmeron flies which live only in&nbsp;that form a few hou∣∙s ; and laſtly, of thofe ſingular and&nbsp;wonderful infects, which are called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">polypes,</span><span class="font2"> which being&nbsp;cut .into ſeveral pieces, each piece lives, grows, and be-comes an infect, and affords to our eyes a great number&nbsp;of prodigies*. The works of M. de Reaumur are exact,&nbsp;cui ious, intereſting, and very ingenious. They are written with much candour, clearncſs, and elegance ; but it&nbsp;muſt be ackowledged his manner is ſomewhat too dif-fuſe. But we muſt not deceive the rçader; he often&nbsp;raiſes our expectations, and does' not give us all the ſa-tisfaction we prdmiſe ourfelves from his writings. .Hιa&nbsp;method of raiſing poultry, in particular, rather disappoints us. He ſpared neither care, time, nor expence,&nbsp;to render it practicable : he flattered himſelf and his&nbsp;countrymen with the greateſt hopes ; but notwithſtaſid-ing his aſſiduons induſtry, and vaſt charges, it proved&nbsp;abortive. The late M∙ l’Advocat recommended him tq&nbsp;obtain better information from Egypt on the ſuhject <sub>i</sub>j&nbsp;arid if poſſible to procure a perſon verſed in the art to&nbsp;inſtruct him in it ; but his death prevented the completion of the ſcheme. If the native of Egypt had arrived, ſhowed M. de. Reaumur a better method than&nbsp;his own, and practiſed it with ſucceſs, as iu. his country, the community would have been benefited ; on the&nbsp;other hand, he would have ſeen, had it failed, that the&nbsp;climate of France was not proper for fuch experiments.&nbsp;M∙ Maillet, conſul at Cairo, to whom Monſieur the re-gent had written to obtain the art, offered to ſend over&nbsp;a native of Egypt, if the government would pay the&nbsp;expence of his voyage, and allow him a penfion of 1500&nbsp;livres. M. Maillet rightly judged, whey he preferred&nbsp;this method of proceeding. M. de Reaumur was not&nbsp;ignorant of the defign ; but he flattered himſelf, that&nbsp;his efforts would be ſucceſsful without further aid, and&nbsp;thought he ſhould acquire ſome honour. He certainly&nbsp;had great talents, induſtry, ſagacity, and every other&nbsp;requiſite which are neceſſary in ſuch attempts ; but it is&nbsp;morally impoſſible that a fingle man, in a different, cli,&nbsp;mate, can attain ſuch knowledge in an art as thoſe who&nbsp;Live in a more favourable country, and have had the&nbsp;experience oſ. many ages to profit by : however M. dc&nbsp;Reaumur may have been unſucceſsſul, poſterity is in-debted to him ſor his repeated trials. He has removed&nbsp;ſome difficulties in the road, and thoſe that travel ſt&nbsp;may diſcover what he only ſaw at a diſtance.</span></p>
