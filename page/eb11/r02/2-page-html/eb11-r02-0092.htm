<p><span class="font0">inward to meet its fellow at the back of the bladder, just above the prostate. The whole length of the vas is 12-to 18 in. and&nbsp;it is remarkable for the great thickness of its muscular walls,&nbsp;which gives it the feeling of a piece of whipcord when rolled&nbsp;between the finger and thumb.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A little above the globus major a few scattered tubules are found in children in front of the cord; these form the rudimentary structure known as the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">organ of Giraldbs</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">paradidymis.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">As the vas deferens approaches the prostate it enlarges and&nbsp;becomes slightly sacculated to act as a reservoir for the secretion&nbsp;of the testis; this part is the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ampulla</span><span class="font0"> (see fig. 2).</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font0">The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">vesiculae seminales</span><span class="font0"> are sac-like diverticula, one on each side, from the lower part of the ampullae of the vasa deferentia.&nbsp;They are about 2 in. long and run outward behind the bladder&nbsp;and parallel to the upper margin of the prostate for some&nbsp;little distance, but usually turn upward near their blind&nbsp;extremity. When carefully dissected and unravelled each is&nbsp;found to consist of a thick tube, about 5 in. long, which is&nbsp;sharply bent upon itself two or three times, and also has several&nbsp;short, sac-like pouches or diverticula. The vesiculae seminales&nbsp;are muscular sacs with a mucous lining which is thrown into a&nbsp;series of delicate net-like folds. The convolutions are held&nbsp;together by the pelvic cellular tissue, and by involuntary muscle&nbsp;continuous with that of the bladder. It is probable that these&nbsp;vesicles are not reservoirs, as was at one time thought, but form&nbsp;some special secretion which mixes with that of the testes.&nbsp;Where the vesiculae join the ampullae of the vasa deferentia the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ejaculatory ducts</span><span class="font0"> are formed; these are narrow and thin-walled,</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font0">and run, side by side, through the prostate to open into the floor of the prostatic urethra.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">prostate</span><span class="font0"> is partly a muscular and partly a glandular structure, situated just below the bladder and traversed by the urethra; it is of a somewhat conical form with the base upward&nbsp;in contact with the bladder. Both vertically and transversely it&nbsp;measures about an inch and a quarter, while antero-posteriorly it&nbsp;is only about three-quarters of an inch, though its size is liable to&nbsp;great variation. It is enclosed in a fibrous capsule from which it&nbsp;is separated by the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">prostatic plexus of veins</span><span class="font0"> anteriorly. It is often&nbsp;described as formed of three lobes two lateral and a median or&nbsp;posterior, but careful&nbsp;sections and recent&nbsp;research throw doubt</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">on the existence of the last.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Microscopically the prostate consists of&nbsp;masses of long, slender, slightly branching&nbsp;glands, embedded in&nbsp;unstriped muscle and&nbsp;fibrous tissue ; these&nbsp;glands open by delicate ducts (about&nbsp;twenty in * number)&nbsp;into the prostatic&nbsp;urethra, which will be&nbsp;described later. In&nbsp;the anterior part of&nbsp;the gland are seen&nbsp;bundles of striped&nbsp;muscle fibres, which&nbsp;are of interest when&nbsp;the comparative anatomy of the gland&nbsp;is studied: they are&nbsp;better seen in young&nbsp;than in old prostates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">male urethra </span><span class="font0">begins at the bladder&nbsp;and runs through the&nbsp;prostate and perineum&nbsp;to the penis, which it&nbsp;traverses as far as the&nbsp;tip. It is divided into&nbsp;a prostatic, membranous and spongy part,&nbsp;and is altogether about&nbsp;8 inches in length.&nbsp;The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">prostatic urethra&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">runs downward&nbsp;through the prostate&nbsp;rather nearer the anterior than the posterior part. It is about an inch and a quarter long, and&nbsp;in the middle of the gland it bends forward forming an&nbsp;angle (see fig. 5); here it is from a third to half an inch&nbsp;wide, though at the base and apex of the prostate it is&nbsp;narrower. When it is slit open from in front a longitudinal&nbsp;ridge is seen in its posterior wall, which is called the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Verumon-Ianurn</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">crista urethra,</span><span class="font0"> and on each side of this is a longitudinaI&nbsp;depression, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">prostatic sinus,</span><span class="font0"> into which numerous ducts of the&nbsp;prostate open, though some of them open-on to the antero-lateral&nbsp;surface. Near the lower part of the verumontanum is a little&nbsp;pouch, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">utrtixdus rnasculinus,</span><span class="font0"> about one-eighth of an inch&nbsp;deep, the opening of which is guarded by a delicate membranous&nbsp;circular fold, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">male hymen.</span><span class="font0"> Close to the opening of the&nbsp;utriculus the ejaculatory ducts, already mentioned, open into the&nbsp;urethra by very small apertures. The part of the urethra above&nbsp;the openings of these ducts really belongs to the urinary system&nbsp;only, though it is convenient to describe it here.
