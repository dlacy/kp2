<p><span class="font1">RUSSELL, JOHN (1745-1806), British portrait painter in pastel, was born at Guildford, Surrey. At an early age he&nbsp;entered the studio of Francis Cotes, R.A., from whom he&nbsp;derived his artistic education, and set up his own studio in&nbsp;1767. Russell was a man of remarkable religious character,&nbsp;a devout follower of Whitefield. He began an elaborate introspective diary in. Byrom’s shorthand in 1766 and continued&nbsp;it to the time of his death. In it he records his own mental&nbsp;condition and religious exercises, entering with a certain morbid&nbsp;ingenuity into long disquisitions, and only occasionally recording information concerning his sitters. His religious life is&nbsp;the key to his complex character, as it actuated his whole career.&nbsp;He obtained the gold medal at the Royal Academy for figure&nbsp;drawing in 1770 and exhibited from the beginning of the&nbsp;Academy down to 1805. He was the finest painter in crayons&nbsp;England ever produced, and although he painted in oil, in&nbsp;water-colours and in miniature, it was by his works in crayon&nbsp;that his reputation was made. He -wrote the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Elements of&nbsp;Painting in Crayon</span><span class="font1">, and described in it his method. He made&nbsp;his own crayons, blending them on his pictures by a peculiar&nbsp;method termed “ sweetening?’ This he carried out with his&nbsp;fingers, rubbing in the colours and softening them in outline,&nbsp;uniting colour to colour so accurately that they melt into one&nbsp;another with a characteristic cadence. His pastel work is to&nbsp;oil painting “ what the vaudeville is to the tragedy or the&nbsp;sonnet to the epic.” His colours were pure and his blending&nbsp;so perfect that no change is to be seen in his works since they&nbsp;were executed. Sir Joseph Banks, writing in 1789 respecting&nbsp;his portraits of the president, of Lady, Mrs and Miss Banks,&nbsp;stated that “ the oil pictures of the present time fade quicker&nbsp;than the persons they are intended to present, but the colours&nbsp;made use of by Russell will stand for ever,” and in that prophecy&nbsp;is so far justified.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">An important picture by him hangs in the Louvre (“ Child with Cherries ”), and two, including <sup>u</sup> The Old Bathing Man&nbsp;at Brighton,” are owned by the crown. At the Royal Academy,&nbsp;of which he was a member, he exhibited three hundred and&nbsp;. thirty works, and his portraits were engraved by Collyer,&nbsp;Turner, Heath, Dean, Bartolozzi, Trotter and other prominent&nbsp;engravers. Russell received warrants of appointment to the&nbsp;king, queen, prince of Wales and the duke of York. He was&nbsp;interested in astronomy, *a friend of Sir W. Herschell, and&nbsp;no mean mathematician. He drew an exceedingly accurate&nbsp;map of the moon, and invented a piece of complicated mechanism for exhibiting its phenomena, publishing a pamphlet,&nbsp;illustrated by his own drawings, describing the apparatus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Two of his sons inherited their father’s talent, and one of them, William (1780-1870), exhibited five fine portraits in the&nbsp;Royal Academy.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RUSSELL, JOHN (d. 1494), English bishop and chancellor, was admitted to Winchester College in 1443, and in 1449 went&nbsp;to Oxford as fellow of New College. He resigned his fellowship&nbsp;in 1462, and appears to have entered the royal service. In&nbsp;April 1467 and January 1468 he was employed on missions to&nbsp;Charles the Bold at Bruges. He was there again in February&nbsp;1470 as one of the envoys to invest Charles with the Garter:&nbsp;the Latin speech which Russell delivered on this last occasion&nbsp;was one of Caxton’s earliest publications, probably printed for&nbsp;him at Bruges by Colard Mansion (see Blades, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Life of Caxton,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">i. p. vii, ii. 29-31). In May 1474 he was promoted to be&nbsp;keeper of the privy seal, and retained his office even after his&nbsp;consecration as bishop of Rochester on the 22nd of September&nbsp;1476, and translation to Lincoln on the 9th of September 1480.&nbsp;As a trusted minister of Edward IV., he was one of the executors&nbsp;of the king’s will; but on the 13th of May 1483 he accepted&nbsp;the office of chancellor in the interest of Richard of Gloucester,&nbsp;apparently with great reluctance. He retained the great seal&nbsp;till the 29th of July 1485. Russell was above all things an&nbsp;official, and was sometimes employed by Henry VII. in public&nbsp;affairs. But his last years were occupied chiefly with the&nbsp;business of his diocese, and of the university of Oxford, of&nbsp;which he had been elected chancellor in 1483. He died at&nbsp;Nettleham on the 30th of December 1494, and was buried at&nbsp;Lincoln Cathedral.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Sir Thomas More calls Russell “ a wise manne and a good, and of much experience, and one of the best-learned men,&nbsp;undoubtedly, that England had in hys time.” Two English&nbsp;speeches composed by Russell, for the intended parliament&nbsp;of Edward V., and the first parliament of Richard III., arc&nbsp;printed in Nichols’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Grants of Edward V.</span><span class="font1"> (Camden Soc.).

<p><span class="font1">RUSSELL, JOHN RUSSELL, </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ist Earl (1792-1878), British statesman, third son of the 6th duke of Bedford, by Georgiana&nbsp;Elizabeth Byng, second daughter of the 4th yiscount Torrington, was born in London on the 18th of August 1792. He was&nbsp;sent to a private school at Sunbury in 1800, and from 1803 to&nbsp;1804 he was at Westminster School, but was then -withdrawn&nbsp;on account of his delicate health. From 1805 to 1808 he was&nbsp;with a private tutor at Woodnesborough, near Sandwich.&nbsp;After travelling in Scotland and in Spain, he studied from the&nbsp;autumn of 1809 to 1812 at the university of Edinburgh, then&nbsp;the academic centre of Liberalism, and dwelt in the house of&nbsp;Professor John Playfair. On leaving the university, he travelled&nbsp;in Portugal and Spain, but on the 4th of May 1813 he was&nbsp;returned for the ducal borough of Tavistock and thereupon&nbsp;came back to England.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In foreign politics Lord John Russell’s oratorical talents were especially shown in his struggles to prevent the union&nbsp;of Norway and Sweden. In domestic questions he cast in his&nbsp;lot with those who opposed the repressive measures of 1817,&nbsp;and protested that the causes of the discontent at home should&nbsp;be removed by remedial legislation. When failure attended&nbsp;all his efforts he resigned his seat for Tavistock in March 1817,&nbsp;and meditated permanent withdrawal from public life, but&nbsp;was dissuaded from this step by the arguments of his friends,&nbsp;and especially by a poetic appeal from his friend Tom Moore.&nbsp;In the parliament of 1818-20 he again represented the family&nbsp;borough in Devon, and in May 1819 began his long advocacy&nbsp;of parliamentary reform by moving for an inquiry into the&nbsp;corruption which prevailed in the Cornish constituency of&nbsp;Grampound. During the first parliament (1820-26) of George IV.&nbsp;he sat for the county of Huntingdon, and secured in 1821&nbsp;the disfranchisement of Grampound, but the seats were not&nbsp;transferred to the constituency which he desired. Lord John&nbsp;Russell paid the penalty for his advocacy of Catholic emancipation with the loss in 1826 of his seat for Huntingdon county,&nbsp;but he found a shelter in the Irish borough of Bandon Bridge.&nbsp;He led the attack against the Test Acts by carrying in February&nbsp;1828 with a majority of forty-four a motion for a committee&nbsp;to inquire into their operations, and after this decisive victory&nbsp;they were repealed (9th of May 1828). He warmly supported&nbsp;the Wellington ministry when it realized that the king’s government could only be carried on by the passing of a Catholic&nbsp;Relief Act (April 1829). For the greater part of the shortlived parliament of 1830-31 he served his old constituency of&nbsp;Tavistock, having been beaten in a contest for Bedford county&nbsp;at the general election by one vote; and when Lord Grey’s</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
