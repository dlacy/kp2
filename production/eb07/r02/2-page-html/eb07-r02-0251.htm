<p><span class="font2">52. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To find the proportion of the velocities of the impelled and working points which give the greatest performance when the weight and power are both given, we may&nbsp;treat the formula which expresses the work, that is, the&nbsp;accelerating force, or W, as a fluxionary quantity, and find&nbsp;its maximum. Thus, to find the radius of the wheel by&nbsp;which the weight will be raised with the greatest velocity,&nbsp;we have to difterentiate the quantity denoted by U, on the ■&nbsp;supposition that </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">α</span><span class="font2"> is variable, and make the result equal to&nbsp;zero. This will give an equation from which </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font2"> will he obtained in terms of P, W, and A ,∙ and it will be observed,&nbsp;that as K varies with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">a,</span><span class="font2"> the value of K in terms of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font2"> must&nbsp;be substituted in the value of U before the differentiation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">53. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The friction may be taken account of by considering&nbsp;it as a quantity to be added to the weight W. Let/ = the&nbsp;co-efficient of friction, and c = radius of the pivots supporting the machine, then the friction will be expressed&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">by fc</span><span class="font2"> (P + W), and we have only to substitute WA +&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">fc</span><span class="font2"> (P + W) for WA in the above expression for U.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">54. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the fixed pulley, the velocities of P and&nbsp;W are equal, and we have also </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font2"> = A. If we denote the&nbsp;weight of the pulley by Q, then its mass will be Q +- </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">g,</span><span class="font2"> and&nbsp;(18) its moment of inertia = ½ Qo<sup>2</sup> -÷- </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">g ;</span><span class="font2"> therefore the formula for the accelerating force with which P descends or W&nbsp;rises will be</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">55. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now proceed to consider the motion of a solid&nbsp;body which is entirely free.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">When a solid body or rigid system is impressed at a single point by a force of which the direction does not pass through&nbsp;the centre of gravity, the body, if free to move in every </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">di</span><span class="font2">rection, acquires two motions, one progressive, and equal to&nbsp;that which would have resulted if the direction of tlle force&nbsp;had passed through the centre of gravity, and the other rotatory, and equal to that which would have resulted if the&nbsp;body had been only at liberty to move round a fixed axis&nbsp;passing through the centre of gravity, and perpendicular to&nbsp;the plane which contains that centre, and the line of the direction of the impelling force.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2">56. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to demonstrate this proposition, let HKL (fig.&nbsp;12) be a section of the body passing through G the centre of&nbsp;gravity, and containing the line in</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">which the force is directed ; let P</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">be the point at which the given</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">force F is applied, and PA its direc</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">tion ; through G draw GA perpen</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">dicular to PA, and let PA repre</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">sent the intensity of the force F.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Bisect AP in B, produce AG un</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">til GC = AG, and through C draw</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">CD, CE perpendicular to AC, and make each equal to AB. If we now conceive a force represented by DC to be applied&nbsp;at D in the direction DC, and another force represented by&nbsp;EC to be applied at E in the direction EC, these two forces&nbsp;being equal, and acting in opposite directions, will destroy&nbsp;each other, or produce no movement in the body, and the&nbsp;motion which actually takes place in consequence of the application of the force PA at P, will be the same as would&nbsp;result from the application of the four forces PB, BA, DC,&nbsp;EC. Now it is evident, that if the two forces BA and DC&nbsp;acted alone, they would produce no rotatory motion about&nbsp;the axis passing through G, for their moments BA ∙ AG&nbsp;and DC ∙ CG are equal, and they tend to turn the body in&nbsp;opposite directions. But the same two forces both tend to&nbsp;give the body a progressive motion ; and as the resultant of&nbsp;two equal and parallel forces is a force equal to their sum,&nbsp;and acting at the point which bisects the distance between&nbsp;their directions, the initial progressive motion of the body&nbsp;in consequence of the forces BA and DC will be the same&nbsp;as if the force PA = F were applied at the point G in the&nbsp;direction parallel to PA. We have now to consider the&nbsp;two remaining forces PB and EC. As these two forces act&nbsp;on the line AC in opposite directions, their resultant is nothing, or their separate tendencies to produce a progressive&nbsp;motion in the centre of gravity of the body, are counteracted by their joint effort. But they conspire in tending&nbsp;to produce a rotatory motion in the same direction about&nbsp;the axis passing through G ; and the moment of the first in&nbsp;respect of that axis being PB ∙ AG, and that of the second&nbsp;EC ∙ CG, the sum of their moments is (PB + EC) AG or&nbsp;PA ∙ AG. The whole effect of these two forces is therefore&nbsp;to produce the same initial angular velocity about the axis&nbsp;through G, perpendicular to HKL, as would be produced&nbsp;by the single force PA applied at the point A ; and it has&nbsp;been shown, that the whole effect of the forces BA and&nbsp;DC is to produce the same progressive movement of the&nbsp;centre of gravity as if the single force PA were applied&nbsp;at that point, consequently the proposition is demonstrated,&nbsp;and it appears that the two motions produced by the application of a force which is not directed towards the centre of gravity may be considered independently of each&nbsp;other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">57. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let V = the progressive velocity of the centre of&nbsp;gravity in the direction parallel to PA ; then the mass of the&nbsp;body being M, we have the force F = MV, and consequently V = F -+ M. Again, if we make AG = </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">l,</span><span class="font2"> the angular&nbsp;velocity produced by the force F applied at A is </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">w</span><span class="font2"> = F ∙ </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">l&nbsp;÷ fridm</span><span class="font2"> (14), therefore V : </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">w :: Jridm</span><span class="font2"> : MZ. Now, since&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">fridm</span><span class="font2"> and M are both known from the nature of the body,&nbsp;it follows, that when the distance Z is given, the ratio of the&nbsp;progressive motion of the centre of gravity to the velocity&nbsp;of angular rotation can be found ; and, conversely, when the&nbsp;ratio of the two velocities is given, the distance Z can be&nbsp;found. For example, let </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">s</span><span class="font2"> be the space described by the&nbsp;centre of gravity while the body makes one revolution about&nbsp;its axis, then 2w is the space described, in consequence of&nbsp;the rotatory motion, by a point of the body whose distance from the axis = 1, and the above proportion gives&nbsp;,2» </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">fridm</span></p>
