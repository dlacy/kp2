<p><span class="font1">In 1765 the association obtained a royal charter, and became known as “ The Incorporated Society of Artists ”; but much&nbsp;rivalry and jealousy were occasioned by the management of&nbsp;the various exhibitions, and an influential body of painters&nbsp;withdrew from the society. They had access to the young&nbsp;king, George III., who promised his patronage and help. In&nbsp;December 1768 the Royal Academy was founded, and Reynolds,&nbsp;whose adhesion to the movement was for a time doubtful, was&nbsp;hailed by acclamation its first president, an honour which more&nbsp;than compensated for his failure to obtain the appointment&nbsp;of king’s painter, which, the previous year, had been bestowed&nbsp;on Allan Ramsay. In a few months the king signified his&nbsp;approval of the election by knighting the new president, and&nbsp;intimating that the queen and himself would honour him with&nbsp;sittings for portraits .to be presented to the Academy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Reynolds was in every way fitted for his new position, and till the late Lord Leighton the Academy never had so good a&nbsp;figure-head. He did not take any part in the educational work&nbsp;of the new institution, but on the social side he set the Academy&nbsp;on the lines it has followed with the greatest worldly success&nbsp;ever since. It was at his suggestion that the annual banquet&nbsp;was instituted. To the specified duties of his post he added&nbsp;the delivery of a presidential address at the distribution of the&nbsp;prizes, and his speeches on these occasions form the well-known&nbsp;“ Discourses ■” of Sir Joshua. These discourses alone would&nbsp;be sufficient to entitle their author to literary distinction;&nbsp;indeed, when they were first delivered, it was thought impossible&nbsp;that they could be the production of a painter, and Johnson&nbsp;and Burke have been credited with their composition, in spite&nbsp;of the specific denials of both, and of Dr Johnson’s indignant&nbsp;exclamation— “ Sir Joshua, sir, would as soon get me to paint&nbsp;for him as to write for him! ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Sir Joshua was too prosperous and successful an artist altogether to escape the jealousy of his less fortunate or less&nbsp;capable brethren, and it must on the other side be admitted&nbsp;that his attitude towards some of his contemporaries was&nbsp;wanting in generosity. His relations with Gainsborough, who&nbsp;on his part was in fault, would require more space for discussion&nbsp;than can here be afforded, but he was not just either to Hogarth&nbsp;or to Richard Wilson. It may be added that though Reynolds’s&nbsp;friends were genuinely fond of him, his was not a nature that&nbsp;could inspire or feel any great warmth of personal feeling.&nbsp;Cosmo Monkhouse in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dictionary of National Bwgraphy&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">speaks of “ the beauty of his disposition and the nobility of&nbsp;his character,” but adds: “ he was a bom diplomatist.” The&nbsp;latter phrase gives the real key to his character. Without&nbsp;going so far as fully to endorse the sentiment of Mrs Thrale’s&nbsp;famous line about a “ heart too frigid ” and a “ pencil too&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">warm,” </span><span class="font1">we must agree with a recent writer that the attitude&nbsp;of Reynolds towards his fellow men and women was one&nbsp;of detachment. Hence we regard Reynolds as a man with&nbsp;tempered admiration, and reserve our enthusiasm for his art.&nbsp;In 1784, on the death of Ramsay, Reynolds was appointed&nbsp;painter to the king. Two years previously he had suffered&nbsp;from a paralytic attack; but, after a month of rest, he was&nbsp;able to resume his painting with unabated energy and power.&nbsp;In the summer of 1789 his sight began to fail; he was affected&nbsp;by the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gutta serena,</span><span class="font1"> but the progress of the malady was gradual,&nbsp;and he continued occasionally to practise his art till about the&nbsp;end of 1790, delivering his final discourse at the Academy on&nbsp;the ioth of December. He was still able to enjoy the companionship of his friends, and he exerted himself in an effort to raise&nbsp;funds for the erection of a monument in St Paul’s to Dr&nbsp;Johnson, who had died in 1784. Towards the end of 1791 it&nbsp;was evident to the friends of Reynolds that he was gradually&nbsp;sinking. For a few months he suffered from extreme depression of spirits, the result of a severe form of liver complaint,&nbsp;and on the 23rd of February 1792 this great artist and blameless&nbsp;gentleman passed peacefully away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As a painter Reynolds stands, with Gainsborough, just behind the very first rank. There can be no question of placing him by&nbsp;the side of the greatest Venetians or of the triumvirate of the 17th&nbsp;century, Rubens, Rembrandt, Velasquez; but, if he fail also to&nbsp;equal either Hals or Van Dyck, this is due, not to any defect in&nbsp;his natural capacity, but to deficiencies in his education combined&nbsp;with thc absence in his case of that splendid artistic tradition on&nbsp;which thc others leaned. He could not draw the figure properly;&nbsp;nor could he as a rule compose successfully on anything like a&nbsp;monumental scale. English painters in his early days possessed a&nbsp;sound technique, and most of Hogarth’s best pictures are perfectly&nbsp;well preserved as well as beautifully painted but Reynolds was not&nbsp;content with the tried methods Hudson could have taught him.&nbsp;In the desire to compass that creaminess, that juicy opulence in&nbsp;colour and texture, of which he conceived the idea before the&nbsp;ltalian journey, and which he found realized in the works of the&nbsp;Venetians and Correggio, he embarked on all sorts of fantastic&nbsp;experiments in pigments and media, so that Haydon exclaimed,&nbsp;“ The wonder is that thc picture did not crack beneath the brush! ”&nbsp;The result was the speedy ruin of many of his own productions,&nbsp;and he inaugurated an era of uncertainty in method which seriously&nbsp;compromised the efforts of his successors in the English school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The motive for this procedure may explain if it do not justify it. Ile was all his life intensely in earnest about his art, devoured&nbsp;by what he himself calls “ a perpetual desire to advance ”; and he&nbsp;accounts for his own uncertainty partly from his want of training,&nbsp;and partly from his “ inordinate desire to possess every kind of&nbsp;excellence ” he saw in the works of others. Now if this mental&nbsp;energy led him into hazardous attempts to find a royal road to the&nbsp;painter’s ideal, it acted well upon his design in lending to it a certain&nbsp;intellectual solidity, which gives it an advantage over the slighter,&nbsp;though at times more exquisite, productions of the pencils of&nbsp;Gainsborough or Romney. The weight and power of the art of&nbsp;Reynolds are best seen in those noble male portraits, “ Lord Heath-field,” <sup>11</sup> Johnson,” “ Sterne,” “ Goldsmith,” “ Gibbon,” “ Burke,”&nbsp;“,Fox,” <sup>11</sup> Garrick,that are historical monuments as well as&nbsp;sympathetic works of art. In this category’ must be included his&nbsp;immortal “ Mrs Siddons as the Tragic Muse.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In portraits of this order Reynolds holds the field, but he is probably more generally admired for his studies of women and of&nbsp;children,.of which the Althorp portraits OftheSpencerfamilyare&nbsp;classic examples. Nature had singled out Sir Joshua to endow’ him&nbsp;with certain gifts in which he has hardly an equal. No portrait&nbsp;painter has been more happy in his poses for single figures, or has&nbsp;known better how to control by good taste the piquant, the accidental, the daring, in mien and gesture.. “Viscountess Crosbie ”&nbsp;is a striking instance. When dealing with more than one figure&nbsp;he was not always so happy, but the ‘‘ Duchess of Devonshire&nbsp;and her Baby,” the “ Three Ladies decking a Figure of Hymen,”&nbsp;and the “ Three Ladies Waldegrave ” are brilliant successes. He&nbsp;was felicitous too in his arrangement of drapery, often following&nbsp;his own fashion of investing his graceful dames in robes of ideal cut&nbsp;and texture, quite apart from the actual clothes worn at the time.&nbsp;Few painters, again, have equalled the president in dainty and at&nbsp;the same time firm manipulation of the brush. The richness of&nbsp;his deeper colouring is at times quite Venetian. For pure delight&nbsp;in the quality of paint and colour we cannot do better than go to&nbsp;the “ Angels’ Heads ” of the National Gallery, or the “ Nelly&nbsp;O’Brien ” in the Wallace Collection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">lt corresponds with what has been noted as Reynolds’s habit of mind in regard to older art to find him throughout his life hankering&nbsp;after success in what he was fond of calling the “grand style”&nbsp;in “ historical painting.” His failure here is as notorious as his&nbsp;brilliant success in the field of art for which nature had equipped&nbsp;him. His “ Ugolino,” his “ Macbeth,” his “ Cardinal Beaufort,”&nbsp;have no real impressiveness, while his greatest effort in the “ historic ” style, the “ Infant Hercules ” at St Petersburg, resulted in&nbsp;his most conspicuous disaster.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is in the “ Discourses ” that Reynolds unfolds these artistic theories that contrast so markedly with his own practice. The&nbsp;first discourse deals with the establishment of an academy for the&nbsp;fine arts, and of its value as being a repository of the traditions of&nbsp;the best of bygone practice, of “ the principles which many artists&nbsp;have spent their lives in ascertaining.” In the second lecture the&nbsp;study of the painter is divided into three stages,—in the first of&nbsp;which ItV is ousied with processes and technicalities, with the&nbsp;grammar of art, while in the second he examines what has been&nbsp;done by other artists, and in the last compares these results with&nbsp;Nature herself. In the third discourse Reynolds treats of “ the&nbsp;great and leading principles of the grand style”; and succeeding&nbsp;addresses are devoted to such subjects as “ Moderation,” “ Taste,”&nbsp;“ Genius,” and “ Sculpture.” The fourteenth has an especial&nbsp;interest as containing a notice of Gainsborough, who had died&nbsp;shortly before it\delivery; while the concluding discourse is mainly&nbsp;occupied with a panegyric on Michelangelo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The other literary works of the president comprise his three essays in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Idler</span><span class="font0"> for 1759-1760 (“ On the Grand Style in Painting,”&nbsp;and “ On the True Idea of Beauty ”), his notes to Du Fresnoy’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Art of Painting,</span><span class="font0"> his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Remarks on the Art of the Low Countries,</span><span class="font0"> his&nbsp;brief notes in Johnson’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Shakespeare,</span><span class="font0"> and two singularly witty and&nbsp;brilliant fragments, imaginary conversations with Johnson, which</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
