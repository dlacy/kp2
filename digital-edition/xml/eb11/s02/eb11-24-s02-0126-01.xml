                <p><label>SANĀ'I</label>, the common name of AbulmAjd Majdüd b. Adam, the earliest
                    among the great Ṣūfic poets of Persia, was a native of Ghazni (in Afghanistan).
                    He flourished in the reigns of the Ghaznevid sultans Ibrāhīm (1059-1099, 451-492
                    a.h.), his son Mas'ñd (1099-1114), and his grandson Bahräm (1118-1152). Persian
                    authorities are greatly at variance as to the dates of the poet’s birth and
                    death. At any rate, he must have been bom in the beginning of the second half of
                    the 11th century and have died between 1131 and 1150 (525 and 545 A.H.). He
                    composed chiefly <hi rend="italic">qaṣīdas</hi> in honour of his sovereign
                    Ibrāhīm and the great men of the realm, but the ridicule of a half-mad jester is
                    said to have caused him to abandon the career of a court panegyrist and to
                    devote his poetical abilities to higher subjects. For forty years he led a life
                    of retirement and poverty, and, although Bahrām offered him a high position at
                    court and his own sister in marriage, he remained faithful to his austere and
                    solitary life. But, partly to show his gratitude to the king, partly to leave a
                    lasting monument of his genius behind him, he began to write his great
                    double-rhymed poem on ethics and religious life, which served as model to the
                    masterpieces of Farïd-uddïn 'Attār and Jelāl ud-dīn Rūmī, the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Ḥadīqat ul·haqīqat,</hi> or “ Garden of Truth ” (also called <hi
                        rend="italic">Alkitãb alfakhrï),</hi> in ten cantos. This poem deals with
                    such topics as: the unity of the Godhead, the divine word, the excellence of the
                    prophet, reason, knowledge and faith, love, the soul, worldly occupation and
                    inattention to higher duties, stars and spheres and their symbolic lore, friends
                    and foes, separation from the world. One of SanaTs earliest disciples, Mahommed
                    b. 'Alī Raqqām, generally known as 'Ali al-Raffā, who wrote a preface to this
                    work, assigns to its composition the date 1131 (525 a.H.), and states besides
                    that the poet died immediately after the completion of his task. Now, Sanā'ī
                    cannot possibly have died in 1131, as another of his mathnawīs, the <hi
                        rend="italic">Ṭarīq-i-taḥqīq</hi>, or “ Path to the Verification of Truth,”
                    was composed, according to a chronogram in its last verses, in 1134 (528 a.h.),
                    nor even in 1140, if he really wrote, as the Ãtashkada says, an elegy on the
                    death of Amir Mu'izzī; for this court-poet of Sultan Sinjar lived till 1147 or
                    1148 (542 a.H.). It seems, therefore, that Taqī Kāshī is right in fixing
                    Sanā'ī's death in 1150 (545 A.H.), the more so as 'Alī al-Raffā himself
                    distinctly says in his preface that the poet breathed his last on the 11th of
                    Sha'bān, “ which was a Sunday,” and it is only in 1150 that this day happened to
                    be the first of the week. Sanā'ī left, besides the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Ḥadīqah</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Tarīq-i-taḥqīq,</hi> several other
                    Ṣūfic mathnawīs of similar purport: for instance, the <hi rend="italic">Sair
                        ul'ibād ilā’lma'ād,</hi> or “Man’s Journey towards the Other World ” (also
                    called <hi rend="italic">Kunüz-urrumüz,</hi> “ The Treasures of Mysteries”); the
                        <hi rend="italic">'Ishqnāma,</hi> or “Book of Love ”; the <hi rend="italic"
                        >'Aqlnāma</hi> or “ Book of Intellect the <hi rend="italic">Kärnäma,</hi> or
                    “ Record of Stirring Deeds,” &amp;amp;c.; and an extensive dīwān or collection
                    of lyrical poetry. His tomb, called the “ Mecca ” of Ghazni, is still visited by
                    numerous pilgrims.</p>
