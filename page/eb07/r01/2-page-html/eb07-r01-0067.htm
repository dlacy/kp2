<p><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font0">the universities of Oxford or of Cambridge. Yielding, ’ therefore, to necessity, he resolved to study surgery and&nbsp;pharmacy ; and was with this view bound apprentice to Dr&nbsp;Findlay, a physician in Frasersburgh. But though obliged to&nbsp;relinquish for a time his favourite studies, he did not think&nbsp;ignorance excusable in a surgeon any more than in a clergyman ; nor did he conceive that he would ever become eminent in the profession in which circumstances had placed him,&nbsp;merely by skill in setting a bone or compounding a medicine.&nbsp;He determined, therefore, to make himself acquainted with&nbsp;at least the outlines of the liberal arts and sciences ; and&nbsp;with this view he repaired in 1750 to King’s College, Aberdeen, where he obtained one of the bursaries or exhibitions&nbsp;which are there annually bestowed upon such candidates as&nbsp;display the most accurate knowledge of the Latin language.&nbsp;The small sum of five pounds, however, which none of these&nbsp;bursaries exceeds, was still inadequate to the expense of&nbsp;residence in college ; but our young student was soon destined to obtain a more valuable exhibition, also by his own&nbsp;merit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">During the long vacation he returned to his master Dr</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Findlay, and was by him intrusted with a very desperate case in surgery, of which his management may be said to&nbsp;have laid the foundation of his future fortunes. His skill&nbsp;and excellent character recommended him so effectually to&nbsp;Sir Alexander Ramsay of Balmain, that he presented him&nbsp;with a bursary of fifteen pounds a year, which commenced&nbsp;at the next session or term in the same college.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Sir Alexander, whom he visited during some of the vacations, was so well pleased with his conversation, that he promised him another bursary, in his gift, of L.25 a year,&nbsp;to commence immediately on the expiration of that which&nbsp;he enjoyed. This promise he performed in the beginning&nbsp;of the year 1755 ; and, at the solicitation of Dr Findlay,&nbsp;even paid the money in advance, to enable the exhibitioner&nbsp;to travel for the purpose of improving himself in his profession.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Thus provided, Mr Ramsay went to London, and studied surgery and pharmacy under the auspices of Dr Macaulay,&nbsp;in whose family he lived for two years, esteemed alike by&nbsp;him and by his lady. Afterwards, having passed the usual&nbsp;examination at Surgeons’ Hall, he served in his medical capacity for several years in the royal navy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Having met with an accident, by which his thigh-bone was fractured, he once more turned his thoughts towards&nbsp;the church ; and on coming home with Sir Charles Middleton he was admitted into orders ; after which he immediately returned to St Christopher’s, where he was presented&nbsp;by the governor to two rectories, valued at L.700 a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As soon as he took possession of his livings, in 1763, he married Miss Rebecca Akers, the daughter of a planter of&nbsp;the best family connections in the island, and began to regulate his household on the pious plan inculcated in his&nbsp;Essay on the Treatment and Conversion of the African&nbsp;Slaves in the British Sugar Colonies. He summoned all&nbsp;his own slaves daily to the prayers of the family, when he&nbsp;took an opportunity of pointing out to them their duty in&nbsp;the plainest terms, reproving those who had done amiss,&nbsp;and commending such as had shown anything like virtue.&nbsp;Although his serious studies were now theological, he considered himself as answerable to God, his country, and his&nbsp;own family, for a proper use of every branch of knowledge&nbsp;which he possessed. He therefore took the charge of several plantations around him in the capacity of a medical&nbsp;practitioner, and attended them with unremitting diligence&nbsp;and with great success. Thus he lived till the year 1777,&nbsp;when, relinquishing the practice of physic entirely, he paid&nbsp;a visit to the place of his nativity, which he had not seen&nbsp;since 1755. His mother, whose latter days he had made&nbsp;comfortable by a handsome annuity, had been dead for some&nbsp;years ; but he rewarded all who had been attentive to her,&nbsp;or in early life serviceable to himself ; and he continued the&nbsp;pension to his sister, who had a numerous family, for which&nbsp;her husband was unable to provide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">After remaining three weeks in Scotland, and nearly a year in England, during which time he was admitted into&nbsp;the confidence of Lord George Germaine, then secretary of&nbsp;state for the American department, Mr Ramsay was appointed chaplain to Admiral Barrington, at that time going out&nbsp;to take a command in the West Indies. Under this gallant&nbsp;officer, and afterwards under Lord Rodney, he was present&nbsp;at several engagements, where he displayed a fortitude and&nbsp;zeal for the honour of his country which would not have&nbsp;disgraced the oldest admiral. To the navy, indeed, he&nbsp;seems to have been strongly attached ; and, at an early period of his life, he wrote an Essay on the Duty and Qualifications of a Sea-officer, with such a knowledge of the&nbsp;service as would have done honour to the pen of the most&nbsp;experienced commander. Although caressed by the admirals under whom he served, Mr Ramsay once more quitted the naval service, and retired to his pastoral charge in&nbsp;the island of St Christopher’s. There, however, though the&nbsp;former animosities against him had entirely subsided, and&nbsp;though his friendship w<sup>r</sup>as now solicited by every person of&nbsp;consequence in the island, he remained but a little time.&nbsp;Sick of the life of a planter and of the prospect of slavery&nbsp;around him, he resigned his livings, and bidding adieu to&nbsp;the island, returned to England with his wife and family&nbsp;in the end of the year 1781. Immediately on his arrival,&nbsp;he was, through the interest of his steady friend Sir Charles&nbsp;Middleton, presented to the livings of Teston and Nettle-stead, in the county of Kent. Here he was soon determined, by the advice of those whom he most respected, to&nbsp;publish an Essay, which had been written many years before, on the Treatment and Conversion of African Slaves&nbsp;in the British Sugar Colonies. This publication involved&nbsp;him in controversies which embittered his life. The agitation given to his mind, and the fatigues he underwent in&nbsp;his endeavours to rescue from misery the most helpless portion of the human race, contributed to shorten a life which&nbsp;had been in no common degree useful. He had for some&nbsp;time been afflicted with a pain in his stomach, for which he&nbsp;was prevailed upon, though with great reluctance, to try&nbsp;the effects of air and exercise, by attempting a journey of a&nbsp;hundred miles. But in London, being seized with a violent vomiting of blood, he was unable to proceed and unfit to be removed hence ; and, in the house of Sir Charles&nbsp;Middleton, he ended his days, on the 20th of July 1789.&nbsp;His works, besides those to which we have already alluded,&nbsp;consist of a volume of Sea-Sermons, and a Treatise on&nbsp;Signals.</span></p>
