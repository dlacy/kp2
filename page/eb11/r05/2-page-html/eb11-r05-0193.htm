<p><span class="font0">RUTHIN </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Rhudd ddin<sub>)</sub> “</span><span class="font0"> red fortress”), a municipal and contributory parliamentary borough (with Denbigh and Holt)&nbsp;and market town of Denbighshire, N. Wales, situated on a hill&nbsp;rising from the river Clwyd, 21 m. from Chester, and 215 from&nbsp;London by rail. Pop. (1901) 2643. It is on the Great Western&nbsp;railway (Denbigh, Corwen &amp; Ruthin branch). Apart from&nbsp;the legends of Arthur and his limestone block (shown in the&nbsp;market-place), the first event of note in its history is its connexion with the de Grey de Ruthyn family (the first lord died&nbsp;*353)- Owen Glendower attacked it unsuccessfully in 1400.&nbsp;It was sold by the de Greys to Henry VII.. and Elizabeth gave&nbsp;it to the earl of Warwick. In 1646, after two months* siege,&nbsp;it was dismantled by the Parliamentarians. The new castle&nbsp;occupies the same site, and is built of the same coloured sandstone as the old. New buildings for the Free Grammar School&nbsp;(founded in 1595 by Gabriel Goodman, dean of Westminster, who&nbsp;also in 1590 had built the hospital for twelve decayed housekeepers), were opened in the town in 1893. The old (conventual)&nbsp;Anglican church of St Peter, once belonging to “ Les Bons-hommes,” and made collegiate in 1310 by John de Grey, has a&nbsp;Perpendicular north aisle roof, nearly 500 panels of carved oak,&nbsp;and cloisters which have been made into a house for the warden&nbsp;of the hospital. Agriculture is the staple, but there are chemical,&nbsp;aerated waters, bricks, terra-cotta and other manufactures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RUTHVEN, the name of a noble Scottish family which traces its descent from a certain Thor, who settled in Scotland&nbsp;during the reign of David I. In 1488 one of its members,&nbsp;Sir William Ruthven (d. 1528), was created a lord of parliament&nbsp;as Lord Ruthven. His eldest son William was killed at Flodden&nbsp;in 1513, and consequently his grandson William succeeded him&nbsp;in the title, and after holding the offices of extraordinary lord&nbsp;of session and keeper of the privy seal died in December 1552,&nbsp;leaving three sons. The eldest of these, Patrick, 3rd Lord&nbsp;Ruthven (c. 1520-1566), played an important part in the&nbsp;political intrigues of the 16th century as a strong Protestant&nbsp;and a supporter of the lords of the congregation. He favoured&nbsp;the marriage of Mary with Darnley, and was the leader of the&nbsp;band which murdered Rizzio. This event was followed by&nbsp;his flight into England, where he died on the 13th of June&nbsp;1566. Ruthven wrote for Queen Elizabeth a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Relation</span><span class="font0"> of the&nbsp;murder, which is preserved in MSS. in the British Museum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A descendant of the 1st Lord Ruthven in a collateral line, also named Patrick Ruthven (c. 1573-1651), distinguished himself in the service of Sweden, which he entered about 1606.&nbsp;As a negotiator he was very useful to Gustavus Adolphus&nbsp;because of his ability to “ drink immeasurably and preserve&nbsp;his understanding to the last,” and he also won fame on the&nbsp;field of battle. Having taken part in the Thirty Years’ War&nbsp;and been governor of Ulm, he left the Swedish service and&nbsp;returned to Scotland, where he was employed by Charles I.&nbsp;He defended Edinburgh Castle for the king in 1640, and when&nbsp;the Civil War broke out he joined Charles at Shrewsbury. He&nbsp;led the left wing at the battle of Edgehill, and after this engagement was appointed general-in-chief of the Royah'st army.&nbsp;For his services he was created Lord Ruthven of Ettrick in&nbsp;1639, earl of Forth in 1642 and earl of Brentford in 1644. The&nbsp;earl compelled Essex to surrender Lostwithiel, and was wounded&nbsp;at both battles of Newbury. But his faculties had begun to&nbsp;•decay, and in 1644 he was superseded in his command by Prince&nbsp;Rupert. After visiting Sweden on a mission for Charles II.,&nbsp;Brentford died at Dundee on the 2nd of February 1651. He&nbsp;left no sons and his titles became extinct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Patrick, 3rd Lord Ruthven, was succeeded as 4th lord by his son William (c. 1541-1584), who like his father was prominent in the political intrigues of the period and was also&nbsp;concerned in the Rizzio murder. In 1582 he devised the&nbsp;plot to seize King James VI., known as the raid of Ruthven,&nbsp;and he was the last-known custodian of the famous silver&nbsp;casket containing the letters alleged to have been written by&nbsp;Mary, queen of Scots, to Bothwell. In 1581 he was created&nbsp;earl of Gowrie, but all his honours were forfeited when he was&nbsp;attainted and executed in May 1584 (see Gowrie, 3RD Earl of).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The 2nd Lord Ruthven left a son, Alexander (d. 1599), the founder of the family of Ruthven of Freeland, and the grandfather of Sir Thomas Ruthven (d. 1673), on whom Charles II.&nbsp;bestowed the title of Lord Ruthven of Freeland in 1651. When&nbsp;his son David died unmarried in April 1701 the title of Baroness&nbsp;Ruthven was assumed by the latter’s sister, Jean (d. 1722),&nbsp;although according to some authorities the peerage had become extinct. It was, however, assumed in 1722 by Isobel&nbsp;(d. 1732), wife of James Johnson, who took the name of Ruthven&nbsp;on succeeding to the family estates; and their son, James&nbsp;Ruthven (d. 1783), took the title and was allowed to vote at&nbsp;the elections of Scots representative peers. In 1853 the barony&nbsp;again descended to a female, Mary Elizabeth Thornton (r. 1784-1864), the wife of Walter Hore (d. 1878). She and her husband&nbsp;took the name of Horc-Ruthven, and their grandson, Walter&nbsp;James Hore-Ruthven (b. 1838), became the 8th baron in 1864.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RUTILE, the most abundant of the three native forms of titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>); the other forms being anatase </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.)&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and brookite (g.v.). Like anatase, it crystallizes in the tetragonal system, but with different angles and cleavages, it being&nbsp;crystallographically related to cassiterite, with which it is iso-morphous. The crystals resemble cassiterite in their prismatic&nbsp;habit and terminal pyramid planes (fig. 1) and also in the twinning; the prism planes are striated vertically. Geniculated&nbsp;twins, with </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span class="font0"> (101) as twin-plane, are of frequent occurrence,&nbsp;and the twinning is usually several times repeated, giving rise&nbsp;to triplets (fig. 2), sextets and octets. Twin-lamellae are often</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">present in the crystals. Acicular crystals are sometimes twinned together to form reticulated skeletal plates to which the name&nbsp;“ sagenite,” from Gr. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">aayqvri</span><span class="font0"> (a net), is applied. A rarer type&nbsp;of twinning, on the plane (301), gives rise to heart-shaped or&nbsp;kite-shaped forms. There are distinct cleavages parallel to&nbsp;the faces of the prisms </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">m</span><span class="font0"> (no) and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font0"> (100). The colour is&nbsp;usually reddish-brown, though yellowish in the very fine needles,&nbsp;and black in the ferruginous varieties (“ nigrine ” and <sup>a</sup> ilmeno-rutile ”): the streak is pale brown. The name rutile, given&nbsp;by A. G. Werner in 1803, refers to the colour, being from the&nbsp;Latin </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rutilus</span><span class="font0"> (red). Crystals are transparent to opaque, and&nbsp;have a brilliant metallic-adamantine lustre. The hardness is&nbsp;61 and the specific gravity 4-2, ranging, however, up to 5-2&nbsp;in varieties containing 10% of ferric oxide. The refractive&nbsp;indices and the positive birefringence are high.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rutile occurs as a primary constituent in eruptive rocks, but more frequently in schistose rocks. As delicate, acicular crystals&nbsp;it is often enclosed in mica and quartz; in mica </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.)</span><span class="font0"> it gives&nbsp;rise to the phenomenon of asterism; and clear transparent quartz&nbsp;(rock-crystal) enclosing rutile is often cut as a gem under the&nbsp;name of “Venus’ hair stone” </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Veneris crinis</span><span class="font0"> of Pliny). Larger&nbsp;crystals occur in the cavities of granite and crystalline schists;&nbsp;very large twinned crystals have been found at Graves Mountain&nbsp;in Lincoln county, Georgia, and good specimens have been obtained&nbsp;from several places in Norway and tne Swiss and Tirolese Alps.&nbsp;As a secondary mineral, rutile in the form of minute needles is&nbsp;of wide distribution in various sedimentary rocks,, especially clays&nbsp;and slates. As rounded grains it is often met with in auriferous&nbsp;sands and gravels. The.mineral has little economic value: it&nbsp;has been uskl for imparting a yellow colour to glass and porcelain, and for this purpose is mined at Risdr and other places in&nbsp;Norway.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(L.
