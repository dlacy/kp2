<p><span class="font0">to minimize the loss of time, two vessels are provided which can be used alternately as generators and absorbers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Applications,—</span><span class="font1">Apart from the economical working of the machine itself, whatever system may be adopted, it is of&nbsp;importance that cold once produced should not be wasted,&nbsp;and it is therefore necessary to use some form of insulation to&nbsp;protect the vessels in which liquids are being cooled, or the&nbsp;rooms of ships’ holds in which the freezing or storage processes&nbsp;are being carried on. This insulation generally consists of&nbsp;materials such as charcoal, silicate cotton, granulated cork,&nbsp;small pumice, hair-felt, sawdust, &amp;c., held between layers of&nbsp;wood or brick, and forming a more or less heat-tight box. There&nbsp;is no recognized standard of insulation. For a cold store to be&nbsp;erected inside a brick or stone building, and to be maintained&nbsp;at an internal temperature of from 18° to 20° F., a usual plan is&nbsp;shown in fig. 5. The same insulation is used for the floors and</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ceilings, except that the wearing surface of the floor is generally made thicker than the inside lining of the sides. Should the&nbsp;walls or floor be damp, waterproof paper is added. Granulated&nbsp;cork has practically the same insulating properties as silicate&nbsp;cotton, and the same thicknesses may be used. About 10 in.&nbsp;of flake charcoal and vegetable silica, or 11 of small pumice,&nbsp;are required to give the same protection as 7 in. of good&nbsp;silicate cotton. Cork bricks made of compressed granulated&nbsp;cork are frequently used, a thickness of about 5 in. giving the&nbsp;same protection as 7 in. of silicate cotton. The walls and&nbsp;ceilings are finished off with a smooth coating of hard cement and&nbsp;the floors are protected by cement or asphalt, according to the&nbsp;nature of the traffic on them. For lager-beer cellars and&nbsp;fermenting rooms, for bacon-curing cellars, and for similar&nbsp;purposes, brick walls with single or double air spaces are used,&nbsp;and sometimes a space filled with silicate cotton or other insulating&nbsp; material. In Australia and New Zealand pumice,&nbsp;which is found in enormous quantities in the latter country,&nbsp;takes the place of charcoal and silicate cotton. In Canada air&nbsp;spaces are largely used either alone or in combination with&nbsp;silicate cotton or planer shavings. The air spaces, two or three&nbsp;in number, are formed between two layers of tongued and&nbsp;grooved wood, and the total thickness of the insulation is about&nbsp;the same as when silicate cotton alone is used. On board ship&nbsp;charcoal has been almost entirely employed, but silicate cotton&nbsp;and granulated cork are sometimes used. The material is either&nbsp;placed directly up to the skin of the vessel, and kept in place by&nbsp;a double lining of wood inside, in which case a thickness of&nbsp;about 10 in. is used depending upon the depth of the frames,&nbsp;or it is placed between two layers of wood, with an air space next&nbsp;the skin, in which case about 6 in. of flake charcoal is generally&nbsp;sufficient for the insulation of the holds, though for deck-houses&nbsp;and other parts exposed to the sun the thickness must be greater.&nbsp;A layer of sheet zinc or tin has frequently to be used as protection&nbsp; from rats. Given a certain allowable heat transmission,&nbsp;the principal points to be considered in connexion with insulation&nbsp;are, first cost, durability, weight and space occupied, the two&nbsp;last named being specially important factors on board ship.&nbsp;No exact rules can be laid down, as the conditions vary so&nbsp;greatly; and though experiments have been made to determine&nbsp;the actual heat conduction of various materials per unit of&nbsp;surface, thickness and temperature difference, the experience&nbsp;of actual practice is at present the only accepted guide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">With compressed-air machines which discharge the cold air direct into the insulated room or hold, a snow box is provided close&nbsp;to the outlet of the expansion cylinder to catch the snow and&nbsp;congealed oil. The air is distributed by means of wood air trunks&nbsp;with openings controlled by slides, and similar trunks are provided in connexion with the suction of the compresser to conduct&nbsp;the air back to the machine. With liquid machines of the compression&nbsp; and absorption system, the rooms are either cooled by means&nbsp;of cold pipes or surfaces placed in them, or by a circulation of air&nbsp;cooled in an apparatus separated from the rooms. The cold pipes&nbsp;may be direct-expansion pipes in which the liquid evaporates,&nbsp;or they may be pipes or walls through which circulates an uncongealable brine previously cooled to the desired temperature.&nbsp;The pipes are placed on the ceilings or sides according to circumstances&nbsp;, but they must be arranged so as to induce a circulation&nbsp;of air throughout the compartment and ensure every part being&nbsp;cooled. With what is termed the air circulation system the air is&nbsp;generally circulated by means of a fan, being drawn from the&nbsp;rooms through ducts, passed over a cooler, and returned again to&nbsp;the rooms by other ducts. In some coolers the cooling surfaces&nbsp;consist of direct-expansion pipes placed in clusters of convenient&nbsp;form ; in others brine pipes are used ; in others there is a shower of&nbsp;cold brine, and in some cases combinations of cold pipes and brine&nbsp;showers. Whether pipes in the rooms or air circulation give the&nbsp;best results is to some extent a matter of opinion, but at the&nbsp;present time the tendency is decidedly in favour of air circulation,&nbsp;at any rate for general cold storage purposes. Whichever system&nbsp;be adopted, it is important for economical reasons that ample&nbsp;cooling surface be allowed, and that all surfaces be kept clean and&nbsp;active, to make the difference between the temperature of the&nbsp;evaporating liquid and the rooms as small as possible. Small&nbsp;surfaces reduce first cost, but involve higher working expenses by&nbsp;decreasing the value of T<sub>1</sub>/(T<sub>2</sub>—T<sub>1</sub>), and thus demanding more&nbsp;energy, and consequently more fuel, to effect the given result than&nbsp;if larger surfaces were employed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The general arrangement of an ice factory for producing can ice is shown in fig. 6. The water to be frozen is contained in galvanized</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">or terned steel moulds suspended in a tank filled to the proper level with brine maintained at the desired temperature. The&nbsp;moulds are frequently arranged in frames, so that by means of&nbsp;an overhead crane one complete row is lifted at a time. When&nbsp;the water is frozen the moulds are dipped in a tank containing&nbsp;warm water, and on being tipped the blocks of ice fall out. Ordinary&nbsp;water contains air, and ice made from it is generally opaque, due&nbsp;to the inclusion of numerous small air-bubbles. To produce clear&nbsp;ice the water must be agitated during the freezing process, or&nbsp;previously boiled to get rid of the air. Distilled water is frequently&nbsp;used, as well as the water produced by the condensation of the&nbsp;steam from the engine, which of course must be thoroughly purified&nbsp;and filtered. It should be noted, however, that with an ice-making plant of moderate size and a steam-engine of good construction the weight of steam used will not nearly equal the weight&nbsp;of ice produced, so that the difference must be made up either by&nbsp;distillation, which is a costly process, or by ordinary water. Can&nbsp;ice is usually made in blocks weighing 56, 112 of 224 lb, and from&nbsp;4 to 8 in. thick. For cell ice ordinary water is used, agitated</span></p>
