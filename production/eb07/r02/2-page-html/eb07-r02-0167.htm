<p><span class="font0">avowed adherent, he expired in the thirtieth year of his reign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The three sons of Constantine had been named Cæsars by their father, and on his death they divided the empire among&nbsp;them. Constantine obtained Gaul, Spain, and Britain ; Constantius, the Asiatic provinces, with the capital, Constantinople ; and Constans, Italy and Africa. The late emperor&nbsp;had assigned provinces to his two nephews, Dalmatius and&nbsp;Hannibilianus ; but the three new emperors, on the ground&nbsp;of a false accusation, barbarously murdered their uncles, cousins, and every member of the imperial house, except two&nbsp;cousins, Gallus and Julian, one suffering under a hopeless&nbsp;malady, the other a mere child. This bloody deed did not&nbsp;long secure to the brothers the quiet possession of their&nbsp;dominions. A dangerous war arose in the East, where Constantius was unable to resist the growing power of the Persians, but suffered several heavy defeats, and was in danger&nbsp;of losing the whole of Mesopotamia, when the Persians were&nbsp;obliged to offer a peace, in consequence of their own dominions being assailed by the nomad tribes beyond the&nbsp;Oxus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the mean time, ambition had kindled a war between the other two imperial brothers, Constantine and Constans. Not&nbsp;satisfied with his portion of the empire, Constantine first&nbsp;seized upon Africa, and then attempted to wrest Italy&nbsp;from Constans. He crossed the Alps, and began to ravage&nbsp;the country round Aquileia ; when falling into an ambuscade&nbsp;he was slain, together with the greater part of his troops.&nbsp;Constans immediately took possession of his fallen brother’s&nbsp;dominions, and thus became the sovereign of two-thirds of&nbsp;the empire. Satisfied, apparently, with this great acquisition, he plunged into the most dissolute indulgences, refused&nbsp;to cede any portion to Constantius, and even allowed that&nbsp;prince to wage an unequal war against the Persians, refusing&nbsp;to lend him any assistance. At length his general, Magnentius, raised the standard of revolt. Constans fled towards Spain, but was overtaken and killed near the Pyrenees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">While Constantius was preparing to avenge the death of hisbrother,anew revolt broke out in ∏lyricum. The army of&nbsp;that province compelled their general, Vetranio, to assume&nbsp;the purple ; and Constantina, sister of the emperor, encouraged him to the deed, and even urged him to form an alliance with the usurper Magnentius, who had so recently slam&nbsp;her brother Constans. Not deeming it prudent to engage&nbsp;in a war of such magnitude without providing for the administration of affairs during his absence, Constantius placed&nbsp;his cousin Gallus in the rank of Cæsar, and advanced to Constantinople, which Vetranio had seized while the emperor&nbsp;was engaged in the Persian war. Pretending to be willing&nbsp;to admit Vetranio to an equal share of power with himself,&nbsp;he obtained permission to enter the imperial city ; and immediately roused the feeling of the army and the people so&nbsp;far, that they declared him sole emperor. Vetranio quietly&nbsp;submitted, his life was spared, and he retired to Prusa,&nbsp;where he spent the remainder of his life in calm seclusion.&nbsp;Maxentius, fully determined to maintain his usurped power,&nbsp;marched at the head of a strong army into Pannonia to&nbsp;meet Constantius. The hostile forces came to an encounter on the plains of Mursa, and a furious combat ensued.&nbsp;It terminated in favour of Constantius, but the victory&nbsp;was purchased by the loss of his bravest troops ; a loss&nbsp;which the exhausted state of the population could not adequately supply. Next summer Constantius gained possession of Italy ; and Maxentius having fled to Gaul, sustained&nbsp;there another defeat, and seeing further resistance in vain,&nbsp;put an end to his own life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Constantius was not long permitted to enjoy his triumph in tranquillity. His cousin Gallus, whom he had created Cæsar, instigated by the ambitious Constantina, and being himself of a morose and haughty disposition, caused so much</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">dissatisfaction in the provinces of the East, that Constantius was obliged first to recall him, and soon afterwards to put&nbsp;him to death. Of the race of Constantine the Great, there&nbsp;now remained only Julian, the cousin of the present emperor ; and he escaped the fate of his brother Gallus,&nbsp;partly in consequence of the intercession of the empress&nbsp;Eusebia, partly because he had hitherto preferred a scholar’s&nbsp;life to the dangerous eminence of military fame. He was&nbsp;permitted to prosecute his studies among the philosophers&nbsp;of Athens, from whom he imbibed that love of the mythology of ancient Greece, which led to his subsequent apostacy from Christianity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Having thus once more arranged the affairs of the empire, Constantine paid a visit to Rome, where he was received&nbsp;with demonstrations of the most flattering character. But&nbsp;he was again called away, in consequence of the Germanic&nbsp;tribes assailing the western, and the Persians the eastern provinces of the empire. He sent Julian to command the armies&nbsp;in Gaul, and to oppose the Germans, while he himself endeavoured to maintain the eastern provinces. In his campaigns he obtained but little success ; and was even compelled to abandon the siege of Bezade, which the Persians&nbsp;had taken. Mean while, Julian was distinguishing himself&nbsp;in a very remarkable manner in Gaul. Instead of a mere&nbsp;scholar, ignorant of every thing but the jargon of the sophists, as Constantius had thought him, he appeared at once,&nbsp;when in command of the army, an intrepid soldier, and a&nbsp;consummate general. The Franks he completely overthrew&nbsp;in several engagements, gained by his personal courage and&nbsp;his skilful conduct, even though the generals had secret orders rather to thwart than second his efforts. Having repelled the Germanic tribes, he crossed the Rhine, plunged&nbsp;through the morasses, penetrated the forests, and traversed&nbsp;the plains of Germany, spreading havoc and dismay among&nbsp;these ancient enemies of the empire. Constantius, envious&nbsp;of his renown, and jealous of his rising power, demanded from him the best legions of his army, on the pretext&nbsp;that their services were required in the Persian war. The&nbsp;legions refused to obey, and proclaimed Julian emperor.&nbsp;Both parties prepared for a war, to decide their pretensions to the imperial diadem ; but while Constantius was&nbsp;exerting himself to the utmost, and while his mind was filled&nbsp;with rage and apprehension, he was seized with a fatal illness, and left the throne to his rival without bloodshed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The high reputation of Julian, which had preceded him, procured tor him a triumphant reception at Constantinople.&nbsp;Immediately on his arrival, he began a rigorous reform in&nbsp;the whole administration ; banished the corrupt and servile&nbsp;ministers of his predecessor ; dismissed those whose sole&nbsp;employment had been to gratify the sensual and luxurious habits of the court; appointed men of talent and&nbsp;activity to administer the affairs of the empire ; and revived&nbsp;in Constantinople some of the forms of the ancient Roman&nbsp;constitution, particularly the senate and the consular title.&nbsp;But along with these reforms, he had planned a change of&nbsp;a much more extensive nature, nothing less than the subversion of Christianity, and the establishment of a somewhat&nbsp;reformed paganism in its stead. Trained as he was, in the&nbsp;philosophic lore of Greece, he imagined that he saw the&nbsp;deep mysteries of a true natural religion concealed beneath&nbsp;the fables of the heathen mythology ; and though he did not&nbsp;imagine the popular mind capableof understanding the deeper&nbsp;meaning, he purposed to remove some of the grossest parts&nbsp;of the external mythic rites, give these, so reformed, to the&nbsp;people, and retain the secret mysteries for the learned. All&nbsp;this, he was well aware, could not be accomplished at once.&nbsp;But he adopted the most subtle methods to promote his ulterior designs. He revoked all the edicts against idolatry ;&nbsp;discouraged Christianity, by removing Christians from all&nbsp;places of public honour and influence, and prohibiting them&nbsp;from teaching in the public schools, with the evident design</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
