<p><span class="font1">his early education at a school at Hammersmith, but when only fourteen he obtained temporary work in the secretary’s office&nbsp;of the East India Company. In 1800 he was appointed junior&nbsp;clerk on the establishment. In 1805 the East India Company&nbsp;decided to make Penang a regular presidency, and sent out&nbsp;a governor with a large staff, including Stamford Raffles, who&nbsp;was appointed assistant-secretary. On the eve of his departure&nbsp;he married Mrs Fancourt (Olivia Mariamne Devenish), widow&nbsp;of a surgeon on the Madras Establishment; she proved herself&nbsp;a helpful wife and counsellor to her husband in his rapid rise to&nbsp;fortune during the following nine years, dying prematurely in&nbsp;Java in November 1814. On his way out to Penang, Raffles&nbsp;began the study of the Malay language, and had mastered its&nbsp;grammar before his arrival. He continued his studies, finding&nbsp;a congenial fellow-worker and kindred spirit in John Leyden,&nbsp;who was invalided to Penang. In August 1806 Raffles was&nbsp;appointed acting secretary during the illness of that official,&nbsp;and in 1807 he received the full appointment. In the mean-time he had acted as Malay interpreter, which entailed heavy&nbsp;and unappreciated work in addition to his regular duties. In&nbsp;1808 his health gave way, and he was ordered for a change&nbsp;to Malacca. This proved a turning-point in his career. The&nbsp;East India Company had decided to abandon Malacca, and&nbsp;orders had been issued to dismantle it. Raffles perfected his&nbsp;study of Malay during his stay at this place, and learning from&nbsp;the Malays, with whom he mixed freely, that the abandonment&nbsp;of so important a position would be a grave fault, he drew up&nbsp;a report explaining the great importance of Malacca, and urging&nbsp;in the strongest manner its retention. This report was sent&nbsp;by the Penang authorities not only to London, but to the&nbsp;governor-general, the earl of Minto. The latter was so im-pressed by the report that he at once gave orders for suspending&nbsp;the evacuation of Malacca, and in 1809 the company decided&nbsp;to reverse its own decision. When the whole question was&nbsp;calmly considered in the light of subsequent events, many years&nbsp;later, the verdict was that Raffles had “ prevented the alienation&nbsp;of Malacca from the British Crown. ” A direct correspondence&nbsp;with Lord Minto was established by the mediation of Leyden,&nbsp;who wrote to Raffles that the governor-general would be gratified&nbsp;in receiving communications direct from him. In June 1810&nbsp;Raffles, of his own accord, proceeded to Calcutta, where Lord&nbsp;Minto gave him the kindest reception. Raffles remained four&nbsp;months in Calcutta, and gained the complete confidence of the&nbsp;governor-general. He brought Lord Minto round to his opinion&nbsp;that the conquest of the island of Java, then in the hands of&nbsp;the French, was an imperative necessity. To prepare the&nbsp;way for the expedition, Raffles was sent to Malacca as “ agent&nbsp;to the Governor-General with the Malay States. ” He did&nbsp;his work well and thoroughly—even to the extent of discovering&nbsp;that the short and direct route to Batavia by the Caramata&nbsp;passage would be safe for the fleet. In August 1811 the expedi-tion, accompanied by Lord Minto, and with Sir Samuel Auchmuty&nbsp;in command of the troops (11, 000 in number, half English and&nbsp;half Indian), occupied Batavia without fighting. On the 25th&nbsp;of the same month a battle was fought at Cornelis, a few miles&nbsp;south of Batavia, and resulted in a complete English victory.&nbsp;On the 18th of September the French commander, General&nbsp;Janssens, formally capitulated at Samarang, and the conquest&nbsp;of the island was completed. Lord Minto’s first act was to&nbsp;appoint Raffles lieutenant-governor of Java. From September&nbsp;1811 until his departure for England in March 1816, Raffles&nbsp;ruled this large island with conspicuous success and the most&nbsp;gratifying results. To give only one fact in support of this&nbsp;statement, he increased the revenue eightfold at the same time&nbsp;that he abolished transit dues, reduced port dues to one-third&nbsp;and removed the fetters imposed on trade and intercourse with&nbsp;the Javanese by Dutch officialdom. In his own words, his&nbsp;administration aimed at being “ not only without fear, but&nbsp;without reproach. ” He had a still greater ambition, which was,&nbsp;in his own words, “ to make Java the centre of an Eastern&nbsp;insular Empire, ” and to establish the closest relations of friend-ship and alliance with the Japanese, whom he described as “ a&nbsp;highly polished people, considerably advanced in science,&nbsp;highly inquisitive and full of penetration. ” It is interesting&nbsp;to note that when another great Englishman, Rajah Brooke,&nbsp;began his career in Sarawak in 1838, he announced: “ I go to&nbsp;carry Sir Stamford Raffles’s views in Java over the whole&nbsp;Archipelago. ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The policy of Raffles was based on the assumption that Java would be retained, but for reasons of European policy it was&nbsp;decided that it must be restored to Holland. After his return&nbsp;to England in 1816 he endeavoured to obtain a reconsideration&nbsp;of the question, but the decision taken was embodied in a treaty&nbsp;and beyond all possibility of modification. During his stay&nbsp;in England Raffles was knighted by the prince regent, published&nbsp;his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">History of Java</span><span class="font1"> (1817) and discussed with Sir Joseph Banks&nbsp;a project for the foundation in London of a zoological museum&nbsp;and garden on the model of the Jardin des Plantes at Paris.&nbsp;He also married his second wife, Sophia, daughter of T. W.&nbsp;Hull of Co. Down; he had many children by both marriages,&nbsp;but the only one to live beyond childhood was a daughter,&nbsp;who died fifteen years after her father’s death, and before she&nbsp;was twenty. He left, therefore, no direct descendants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In November 1817 Sir Stamford quitted England on his return to the East, where the lieutenant-governorship of Fort&nbsp;Marlborough (Sumatra) had been kept in reserve for him. His&nbsp;administration of Sumatra, which lasted from March 1818 till&nbsp;December 1823, was characterized by the same breadth of view,&nbsp;consistency of purpose and energy in action that had made&nbsp;his government of Java remarkable. He had not, however,&nbsp;done with the Dutch, who, on their recovery of Java, endeavoured&nbsp;to establish a complete control over the Eastern archipelago,&nbsp;and to oust British trade. This design Sir Stamford set himself&nbsp;to baffle, and although he was more frequently censured than&nbsp;praised by his superiors for his efforts, he had already met with&nbsp;no inconsiderable success in minor matters when, by a stroke&nbsp;of genius and unrivalled statecraft, he stopped for all time the&nbsp;Dutch project of a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">mare clausum</span><span class="font1"> by the acquisition and founding&nbsp;of Singapore on the 29th of January 1819.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In 1824 Sir Stamford returned to England, but unfortunately the differences between him and the East India Company had&nbsp;resulted in an accumulation of disputes which placed a severe&nbsp;strain on his enfeebled constitution. The memorials and statements that he had to compile for his own vindication would fill&nbsp;a large volume, but at last the court passed (12th of April 1826)&nbsp;a formal decision in his favour. It did not omit, however, to&nbsp;censure him for “ his precipitate and unauthorized emancipation&nbsp;of the Company’s slaves, ” or after his death to make his widow&nbsp;pay £10, 000 for various items, which included the expense of&nbsp;his mission to found Singapore! Harassed as he was by these&nbsp;personal affairs, he still found time to carry out his original&nbsp;scheme with regard to a zoological society in London. He&nbsp;took the largest part in the creation of the existing society,&nbsp;and his fine Sumatra collection formed its endowment. He&nbsp;was unanimously elected its president at the first meeting, and&nbsp;by a remarkable unanimity of opinion on the part of those who&nbsp;helped in the work, he has been recognized as “ the Founder&nbsp;of the Zoological Society. ” He was contemplating entering&nbsp;parliamentary life when his sudden death on his birthday,&nbsp;1826, ended his brilliant career at the early age of forty-five.&nbsp;Sir Frederick Weld, lieutenant-governor at Singapore, when&nbsp;unveiling the statue of his predecessor at that place in 1887,&nbsp;crystallized the thoughts of his countrymen and anticipated&nbsp;the verdict of history in a single sentence: “ In Raffles, England&nbsp;had one of her greatest sons. ”</span></p>
