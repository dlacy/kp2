These ' rivers fall into the Elbe on its right bank. On the left bank it receives the Moldau, which has two sources in Bohemia, and in Saxony unites with the Zwichau, and runs parallel to the Elbe till it joins that stream at Dessau. The White Elster rises in Voightland, with many curvatures reaches the suburbs of the city of Leipsig, and, receiving there the small river Pleisse, falls into the Saale, and is ultimately lost in the Elbe above Magdeburg. The only river that does not run to the Elbe is the Neisse, which rises in the eastern corner of the kingdom, and, passing into Silesia, is at length emptied into the Oder. There are no lakes in Saxony, nor any canals, except such as are used in the mining districts for conveying the ore to the mills.</p><p>As compared with most parts of Germany, the agriculture of Saxony is much advanced. Wherever the soil is capable of cultivation, it is worked with diligence ; and the more hilly and poorer soils have a good herbage, and yield pasture to numerous flocks and herds. The sides of the mountains towards the Elbe, from Pirna to Meissen, are covered with vines which yield both red and white wine ; the former from the vicinity of Pilnitz and Loschwitz, and the latter from that of Hoflasnitz, are the most valued ; but the great portion of the Saxon wines is of a very indifferent quality. The best of them are produced from the vineyards belonging to the king ; and though they are sold at the highest prices, it is very doubtful if the expenses of cultivation, and the rent which might be obtained for the land, do not exceed what is produced by the sale of the wines.</p><p>The whole of Saxony is highly productive of fruit, and the care and skill exercised in its cultivation is amply rewarded. Great destruction to the fruit-trees took place during the tremendous military conflicts of which the country was the theatre ; but still the orchards and gardens are very extensive, and new trees, planted since the wasting warfare of 1813, are beginning to yield their products. The calamities which proved injurious to the fruit-trees have lessened the number of cattle of every description ; in the year 1817, in many districts of the circle of Meissen, not a single head of cattle was to be found. The bee-hives were destroyed by the same events ; but the traces of these calamities have now disappeared, and the remembrance of them is scarcely adverted to by the rising generation. The sheep were preserved by being driven to the mountains, and since the war have vastly multiplied ; and the fineness of the wool, for the sake of which they are chiefly kept, has been most wonderfully increased, and excels the finest wools of Spain.</p><p>The arable land is chiefly cultivated on a three-course system, consisting of a fallow, winter sown grain, and spring sown grain. In some cases there is a fallow crop of flax, hemp, or potatoes. The winter corn that succeeds is generally rye, and sometimes, though less extensively, wheat ; the summer corn which follows is chiefly oats, and sometimes barley. The greater part of the arable land is in common fields, held under a feudal tenure, over which the lord of the manor has the right of depasturing his flocks between the harvest and the next seed time. The farming occupations are generally very small, and the increase of grain throughout the whole kingdom is said not to average more than five to one. The culture of potatoes has been very much extended of late years, and forms almost exclusively the food of the labouring classes in the mountainous districts. Tobacco, hemp, flax, wood, hops, and chiccory, are grown in some parts of the kingdom, but neither of them to the extent which the ∞nsumption of the country requires. The woods of the kingdom, since the separation of its best portions, are insufficient to furnish the inhabitants with the necessary fuel ; and though abundance of coal is found near Dresden, it is of so sulphureous a nature as to be deemed unwholesome, and is used only by those</p><p>who are unable to pay the high price for wood which its scarcity has created.</p><p>Saxony abounds in minerals, and though the veins in general are far from being of great thickness, the ore is tolerably rich ; which, added to superior skill and economy in working the mines and separating the metals, makes them very beneficial to the crown, to whom the greater portion of them belong. The mineralogical school of Frey- berg has had a wonderful influence, not only in Saxony, but in all parts of the world, in increasing the knowledge and in improving the practice of the operative labourers in the mining art. The annual produce of the silver-mines is about 400,000 ounces ; and besides this, they yield copper, lead, tin, iron, sulphur, quicksilver, bismuth, arsenic, and coal. Gold is found in very small quantities.</p><p>In no part of the Continent has manufacturing industry been carried to so great an extent, or occupied so large a proportion of the population, as in Saxony. Before the separation from it of the most productive agricultural provinces, it was calculated that two fifths of the inhabitants were employed in manufactures ; but since that unfortunate event, it is estimated that three fifths are occupied in commerce and manufactures, and only two fifths in agriculture. It is by the extent of its manufactures alone that the country can be furnished with the means of paying for those articles of the first necessity, of which a sufficiency is not now produced within it. The provinces which supplied com, fuel, and salt, have been ceded to Prussia, and those articles must be paid for by the sales of the minerals and manufactures. During the continuance of Napoleon’s continental system, the Saxon manufacturers enjoyed a most extensive trade, anil the encouragement thus obtained gave an impulse which directed the efforts and the capital of the country towards their perfection ; but the division of labour was not carried to such an extent, nor was the application of machinery so generally adopted, as to enable them to withstand the competition with British goods, which peace introduced into many of those markets that they had before almost exclusively supplied. It would include almost the whole catalogue of European manufactures to enumerate the respective kinds of goods made in Saxony. Woollens, linens, cottons, and silks for clothing ; iron, brass, and copper wares ; paper, leather, earthenware, hats, musical instruments, and turnery ware ; various chemical and dyeing preparations ; clocks, watches, swords, guns, and pistols, are all comprehended in the list of Saxon manufactures.</p><p>The commerce of a country whose inhabitants are chiefly occupied in manufactures, and produce an insufficiency of food for their own consumption, must necessarily be extensive. The trade of Saxony chiefly centres in the city of Leipsig, whence, at the time of the two annual fairs, the greater part of the manufactures are disposed of, and contracts are made for such foreign commodities as the supply of the country demands. As the fairs of Frankfort-on-the-Maine precede, and those of Frankfort-on-the-Oder follow’, the fairs of Leipsig, some portion of the trade is carried on by those channels. The roads leading to Leipsig are generally good, and trains of waggons loaded with goods are at all times to be seen proceeding to and from that place ; many of which come from Flanders, Holland, Hamburg, and Brunswick, on one side, and from Russia, Poland, and even Turkey, on the other. At the fairs of Leipsig the new books printed in most parts of Germany are brought for publication. There the publishers meet and exchange the works of one part of the country, where the German language is spoken, with those of another. So extensive is this trade, that it is said the commissions on it to the brokers and merchants of Leipsig amount to more than 40,000 rix-thalers a year. The whole sales at the fairs in that city are estimated, including the exports and imports, at about 20,000,000 rix-thalers, or more than L.3,000,000 sterling. Saxony disposes, in this</p></body></text></TEI>
