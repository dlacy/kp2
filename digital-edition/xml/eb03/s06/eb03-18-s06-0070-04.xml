an iſland of Aſia, the moſt weſtern of the Sunda Iſlands, and conſtituting on that side the boundary of the Eaſtern Archipelago. Its general direction is nearly north-weſt and ſouth-eaſt. The equator divides it into almoſt equal parts, the one extremity being in 5. 33. N. and the other in 5. 56. S. Lat. Acheen Head, at the north extremity of the iſland, is in longitude 95. 34. east. It lies expoſed on the ſouth-weſt side to the Indian Ocean ; the north point ſtretches into the bay of Bengal ; to the north-eaſt it is divided from the peninſula of Malacca by the ſtraits of that name ; to the eaſt by the ſtraits of Banca, from the iſland of that name ; to the ſouth-eaſt by the commencement of what are called the <hi rend="italic">Chineſe Seas</hi><note anchored="false" n="1" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>Brooke's Gazzetteer.</p></note> <hi rend="italic">;</hi> and on the ſouth by the ſtraits of Sunda, which ſeparate it from the iſland of Java. It is about 900 miles in length, but from 100 to 150 only in breadth. No account had been given of this iſland by any Engliſhman till the year 1778, when Mr Charles Miller (ſon of the late botanical gardener) publiſhed an account of the manners of a particular diſtrict, in the 68th volume of the Philoſophical Transactions. Theſe were the Battas, a people who live in the interior parts, called the <hi rend="italic">Caſſia Country.</hi> They differ from all the other inhabitants in language, manners, and cuſtoms. They eat the priſoners whom they take in war, and hang up their skulls as trophies in their houſes. He obſerves, however, that human fleſh is eaten by them <hi rend="italic">in terrorem,</hi> and not as common food, though they prefer it to all others, and ſpeak with peculiar raptures of the ſoles of the feet and palms of the hands. They expressed much ſurpriſe that the white people did not kill, much leſs eat, their priſoners. From<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0077.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0071"/>
this country the greateſt part of the caſſia that is ſent to Europe is procured. It abounds alſo with the camphire trees, which conſtitute the common timber in uſe ; and in theſe trees the camphire is found native, in a concrete form. It is remarkable, that in this ſtate it is ſold to the Chineſe at the price of 250l. or 300 l, <hi rend="italic">per</hi> cwt. but theſe dexterous artiſts contrive to furniſh the Europeans with it at about a quarter of that price. In 1783, Mr Marſden, who had been ſecretary to the preſident and council of Fort Marlborough, publiſhed a Hiſtory of Sumatra, with very copious particulars of the iſland. He repreſents it as ſurpaſſed by few in the beautiful indulgences of nature. A chain of high mountains runs through its whole extent ; the ranges in many parts being double and treble ; their altitude, though great, is not ſufficient to occaſion their being covered with ſnow during any part of the year. Between theſe ridges are extenſive plains, conſiderably elevated above the ſurface of the maritime lands. In theſe the air is cool ; and from this advantage they are eſteemed the moſt eligible portion of the country, are the best inhabited, and the moſt cleared from woods, which elſewhere, in general, throughout Sumatra, cover both hills and valleys with an eternal ſhade. Here too are found many large and beautiful lakes, that facilitate much the communication between the different parts. The heat of the ait is far from being ſo intenſe as might be expected from a country occupying the middle of the Torrid Zone ; and it is more temperate than many regions within the Tropics; the thermometer at the most ſultry hour, about two in the afternoon, generally fluctuating between 82 and 85 degrees. Mr Marſden divides the inhabitants into Malays, Acheneſe, Battas, Lampoons, and Rejangs ; and he takes the latter as his standard of deſcription, with reſpect to the perſons, manners, and customs, of the inhabitants. They are rather below the middle stature ; their bulk in proportion ; their limbs for the moil part flight, but well ſhaped, and particularly ſmall at the wrists and ancles ; and, upon the whole, they are gracefully formed. Their hair is ſtrong, and of a ſhining black. The men are beard- lefs, great pains being taken to render them ſo when boys, by rubbing their chins with a kind of quicklime. Their complexion is properly yellow, wanting the red tinge that conſtitutes a copper or tawny colour. They are in general lighter than the Mestees, or half-breed, of the reft of India; thoſe of the ſuperior claſs, who are not expoſed to the rays of the ſun, and particularly their women of rank, approaching to a degree of fairneſs. If beauty consisted in this one quality, ſome of them would ſurpass our brunettes in Europe. The major part of the females are ugly, many of them even to diſgust ; yet among them are ſome whoſe appearance is ſtrikingly beautiful, whatever composition of perſon, features, and complexion, that ſentiment may be the reſult of. Some of the inhabitants of the hilly parts are obſerved to have the ſwelled neck or goitre ; but they attempt no remedy for it, as theſe wens are conſistent with the higheſt health. The rites of marriage among the Sumatrans consist simply in joining the hands of the parties, and pronouncing them man and wife without much ceremony, excepting the entertainment which is given upon the occaſion by the father of the girl. The cuſtoms of the Sumatrans permit their having as many wives as they can pur- chaſe, or afford to maintain ; but it is extremely rare that an mſtance occurs of their having more than one, and that only among a tew of the chiefs. This continence they owe, in ſome meaſure, to their poverty. The dictates of frugality arc more powerful with them than the irregular calls of appetite, and make them decline an indulgence from which their law does not reſtrain them. Mothers carry their children, not on the arm as our nurſes do, but straddling on the hip, and uſually ſupported by a cloth which ties in a knot on the oppoſite ſhoulder. The children are nurſed but little ; are not confined by any ſwathing or bandages ; and being suffered to roll ab ut the floor, ſoon learn to walk and shift for themſelves. When cradles are uſed, they ſwing ſuſpended from the ceilings of the rooms.</p><p>The Sumatrans are ſo fond of cock-fighting, that a father on his death bed has been known to deſire his ion to take the firſt opportunity of matching a cock for a ſum equal to his whole property, under a blind conviction of its being invulnerable. When a cock is killed, or runs, the other must have ſufficient ſpirit and vigour left to peck at him three times on his being held up to him for that purpoſe, or it becomes a drawn battle ; and ſometimes an experienced cocker will place the head of his vanquished bird in ſuch an uncouth ſituation as to terrify the other, and. render him unable to give this proof of victory.</p><p>The wild beaſts of Sumatra are tgers, elephants, rhinoceroſes, bears, and monkeys. The tigers prove to the inhabitants both in their journeys and even their domeſtic occupations most deſtructive enemies. The number of people annually slain by theſe rapacious tyrants of the woods is al- moſt incredible. Whole villages have been depopulated by them ; yet from a ſuperſtitious prejudice, it is with difficulty they are prevailed upon, by a large reward which the India Company offers, to uſe methods of deſtroying them, till they have ſuſtained ſome particular injury in their own family or kindred. The ſize and strength of the ſpecies which prevails on this iſland is prodigious. They are ſaid to break with a ſtroke of their fore paw the leg of a horſe or a buffalo ; and the largeſt prey they kill is without difficulty dragged by them into the woods. This they uſually perform on the second night, being ſuppoſed on the firſt to gratify themſelves with fucking the blood only. Time is by this delay afforded to prepare for their deſtruc- tion, either by ſhooting them, or placing a veſſel of water ſtrongly impregnated with arſenic near the carcaſe, which is faſtened to a tree to prevent its being carried off. The tiger having ſatiated himſelf with the fleſh, is prompted to aſſuage his thirſt with the tempting liquor at hand, and pe- riſhes in the indulgence. Their chief ſubſiſtence is moſt probably the unfortunate monkeys with which the woods abound. They are described as alluring them to their fate by a faſcinating power, ſimilar to what has been ſuppoſed of the ſnake ; and, ſays Mr Marſden, “ I am not incredulous enough to treat the idea with contempt, having myſelf obſerved, that when an alligator or a crocodile, in a river, comes under an overhanging branch of a tree, the monkeys, in a ſtate of alarm and diffraction, crowd to the extremity, and, chattering and trembling, approach nearer and nearer to the amphibious monſter that waits to devour them as they drop, which their fright and number render almoſt unavoidable.” Theſe alligators likewise occaſion the loſs of many inhabitants, frequently deſtroying the people as they bathe in the river, according to their regular cuſtom, and which the perpetual evidence of the riſk attending it cannot deter them from. A ſuperſtitious idea of their ſanctity alſo preſerves them from moleſtation, although, with a hook of ſufficient strength, they may be taken without much difficulty. The other animals of Sumatra are buffaloes, a ſmall kind of horſes, goats, hogs, deer, bullocks, and hog-deer. This laſt is an animal ſomewhat larger than a rabbit, the head reſembling that of a hog, and its ſhanks and feet like thoſe of the deer. The bezoar ſtone found on this animal has been valued at 10 times its weight in gold ; it is of a dark brown colour, ſmooth on the outſide ; and the coat being taken off, it appears ſtill darker, with ſtrings running underneath the coat ; it will ſwim on the top of the water. If it be infu-<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0078.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0072"/>
ſed in any liquid, it makes it extremely bitter ; the virtues uſually attributed to this ſtone are cleaning the ſtomach, creating an appetitc, and ſweetening the blood.</p><p>Of birds they have a greater variety than of beaſts. The coo-ow, or Sumatran pheaſant, is a bird of uncommon beauty. They have ſtorks of prodigious ſize, parrots, dung-hill fowls, ducks, the largeſt cocks in the world, wood-pigeons, doves, and a great variety of ſmall birds, different from ours, and diſtinguished by the beauty of their colours. Of their reptiles, they have lizards, flying-lizards, and cameleons. The iſland swarms with insects, and their varieties are no leſs extraordinary than their numbers. Rice is the only grain that grows in the country ; they have sugar-canes, beans, peas, radiſhes, yams, potatoes, pumkins, and ſeveral kinds of pot-herbs unknown to Europe ; and here are to be found moſt of the fruits to be met with in other parts of the Eaſt Indies, in the greateſt perfection. Indigo, Braſil- wood, two ſpecies of the bread-fruit tree, pepper, benjamin, coffee, and cotton, are likewiſe the produce of this island, as well as caſſia and camphire mentioned above. Here alſo is the cabbage-tree and ſilk cotton tree ; and the foreſt contains a great variety of valuable species of wood, as ebony, pine, ſandal, eagle or aloes, teek, manchineel, and ironwood, and alſo the banyan tree. Gold, tin, iron, copper, and lead, are found in the country ; and the former is suppoſed to be as plentiful here as in Peru or Mexico. The fineſt gold and gold-duſt are found in the country of <hi rend="italic">Limong,</hi> immediately contiguous to the preſidency of <hi rend="italic">Fort Marlborough,</hi> to which the merchants repair annually for the purchase of opium, and ſuch other articles as they may be in want off, and give for them gold of ſo pure a nature as to contain little or no alloy.<note anchored="false" n="2" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>Asiatic Researches, vol. i.</p></note> The native indolence of the <hi rend="italic">Malay</hi> diſpoſition prevents them from collecting more than is ſufficient to ſupply the few and simple wants of a race of men as yet unenlightened by civilization and science, and ignorant of the full extent of the advantages of the country inhabited by them. The roads leading to this golden country are almoſt impervious ; affording only a ſcanty path to a tingle traveller, where whole nights muſt be paſſed in the open air, expoſed to the malignant influence of a hoſtile climate, in a country infeſted by the moſt ferocious wild beaſts. Theſe are circumſtances that have hitherto checked curioſity ; but perſeverance and ſtudied precaution will ſurmount the obſtacles they furniſh, and ſuch ciſcoveries might be made as would amply compenſate for the difficulties leading to them. The gold merchants who come from the neighbouring and leſs rich countries, give us ſuch accounts of the facility of procuring gold as border nearly on the marvellous, and would be altogether incredible, if great quantities of that metal produced by them did not in ſome degree evince the certainty of their accounts.</p><p>This great abundance of gold in Sumatra induces Mr Marſden to ſhppoſe that iſland to be the Ophir of Solomon ; a conjecture which, in his opinion, derives no ſmall rorce ſrom the word <hi rend="italic">Ophir's</hi> being really a <hi rend="italic">Malay</hi> ſubſtantive, of a compound ſenſe, ſignifying a mountain containing gold. The natives, he confeſſes, have no oral tradition on the ſubject ; and we have elſewhere made it probable, that Ophir was ſituated in a different quarter of the world (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Ophir).</hi> Beſides the metals and different ſpecies of wood which we have mentioned. Sumatra produces ſulphur, arſenic, ſalt- petre, and bees-wax, with edible birds-neſts, which are there commodities of great importance (ſee <hi rend="italic">BIRDS-Nests).</hi></p><p>The Engliſh and Dutch have factories on this iſland ; the principal one of the former being Fort Marlborough, on the ſouth weſt coaſt. The original natives of Sumatra are Pagans ; but it is to be obſerved, that when the Sumatrans. or any of the natives of the eaſtern iſlands, learn to read the Arabic character, and ſubmit to circumciſion, they are ſaid to become Malays ; the term <hi rend="italic">Malay</hi> being underſtood to mean <hi rend="italic">Musſulman.</hi> See ACHEEN.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
