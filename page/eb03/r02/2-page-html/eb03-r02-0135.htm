<p><span class="font0">Tlu6 generous behaviour in Camillus effected more than big arms could do : the magiſtrates of the town&nbsp;immediately ſubmitted to the ſenate, leaving to Camillus the conditions of their ſurrender ; who only&nbsp;fined them in a ſum of money to ſatisfy his army, and&nbsp;received them under the protection and into the alliance&nbsp;of Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Notwithſtanding the veneration which the virtues of Camillus had excited abroad, they ſeemed but little&nbsp;adapted to bring over the reſpect of the turbulent tribunes at home, as they raiſed ſome freſh accuſation&nbsp;againſt him every day. To their other charges they&nbsp;added that of his having concealed a part of the plunder of Veii, particularly two brazen gates, for his own&nbsp;uſe ; and appointed him a day on which to appear before the people. Camillus, finding the multitude ex-aſperated againſt him upon many accounts, deteſting&nbsp;their ingratitude, reſolved not to wait the ignominy&nbsp;of a trial ; but, embracing his wiſe and children, prepared to depart from Rome. He had already paſſed&nbsp;as far as one of the gates, unattended on his way, and&nbsp;unlamented. There he could ſuppreſs his indignation&nbsp;no longer ; but, turning his face to the capitol, and&nbsp;lifting up his hands to heaven, intreated all the gods&nbsp;that his country might one day be ſenſible of their&nbsp;injuſtice and ingratitude ; and ſo ſaying, he paſſed forward to take refuge at Ardea, where he afterwards&nbsp;learned that he had been fined 1500 aſes by the tribunes at home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Romans indeed ſoon had reaſon to repent their uſage of Camillus ; for now a more formidable enemy&nbsp;than ever they had met with threatened the republic i&nbsp;an inundation of Gauls, leaving their native woods, under the command of one Brennus, waſted every thing&nbsp;with fire and ſword. It is ſaid that one Cceditius, a&nbsp;man of the loweſt rank, pretended to have heard a miraculous voice, which pronounced diſtinctly theſe words:&nbsp;“ Go to the magiſtrates, and tell them that the Gauls&nbsp;draw near.” The meanneſs of the man made his warning deſpiſed ; though, when the event ſhowed the truth&nbsp;of his prediction, Camillus erected a temple to the unknown Deity, and the Romans invented ſor him the&nbsp;name of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Aius Locutius.</span><span class="font0"> Meſſeriger after meſſenger arrived with the news of the progreſs and devaſtations of&nbsp;the Gauls ; but the Romans behaved with as much ſecurity as if it had been impoſſible for them to have felt&nbsp;the effects of their depredations. At laſt envoys arrived at Rome, imploring the aſſiſtance of the republic&nbsp;againſt an army of Gauls, which had made an irruption&nbsp;into Italy, and now beſieged their city. The occaſion&nbsp;of the irruption and ſiege was this: Arunx, one of the&nbsp;chief men of Cluſium in Hetruria, had been guardian&nbsp;to a young lucumo, or lord of a lucumony, and had&nbsp;educated him in his houſe from his infancy. The lu-cumo, as ſoon as he was of an age to feel the force of&nbsp;paſſion, fell in love with his guardian’s wife ; and,&nbsp;upon the firſt diſeovery of their intrigffe, conveyed het&nbsp;away. Arunx endeavoured to obtain reparation for the&nbsp;injury he had received ; but the lucumo, by his intereſt&nbsp;and money, gained over the magiſtrates: ſo that the injured guardian, finding no protectors in Hetruria, reſolved to make his application to the Gauls. The people&nbsp;among all the Celtic nations, to whom he choſe to addreſs himſelf, were the Senones ; and, in order to engage them in his quarrel, he aquaînted them with the&nbsp;great plenty of Italy, and made them taſte of ſome Italian wines. Upon this the Senones reſolved to follow&nbsp;him ; and a numerous army was immediately formed,&nbsp;which paſſing the Alps, under the conduct of their Hetrurian guide, and leaving theCeltæ in Italy unmoleſted,&nbsp;fell upon Umbria, and poſſeſſed themſelves of a’J the&nbsp;country from Ravenna to Pſeenum. They were about&nbsp;ſix years in fettling themſelves in their new acquiſitions,&nbsp;while the Romans were carrying on the ſiege of Veii.&nbsp;At length Arunx brought the Senones before Cluſium,&nbsp;in order to beſiege that place, his wife and her lover&nbsp;having ſhut themſelves up there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The ſenate, being, unwilling to engage in an open war with a nation which had never offended them, ſent&nbsp;an embaſſy of three young patricians, all brothers, and&nbsp;of the Fabian family, to bring about an accommodation&nbsp;between the two nations. Theſe ambaſſadors, being arrived at the camp of the Gauls, and conducted into the&nbsp;council, offered the mediation of Rome; and demanded&nbsp;of Brennus, the leader of the Gauls, What injury the&nbsp;Cluſini had done him ; or what pretenſions any people&nbsp;from a remote country could have upon Hetruria ?&nbsp;Brennus anſwered proudly, that his right lay in his&nbsp;ſword, and that all things belonged to the bräve ; but&nbsp;that, without having recourſe to this primitive law of&nbsp;natnre, he had a juſt complaint againſt the Cluſians,&nbsp;who, having more lands than they could cultivate, had&nbsp;refuſed to yield to him thoſe they left untilled : And&nbsp;what other motives had you yourſelves, Romans (ſaid&nbsp;he), to conquer ſo many neighbouring nations ? You&nbsp;have deprived the Sabines, the Albans, the Fidenates,&nbsp;the Æqui, and the Volſei, of the beſt part of their territories. Not that we accuſe you of injuſtice ; but it&nbsp;is evident, that you thought this to be the prime and&nbsp;rrioſt ancient of all laws, to make the weak give way to&nbsp;the ſtrong. Forbear therefore to intereſt yourſelves for&nbsp;the Cluſini, or allow us to take the part of the people&nbsp;you have ſubdued.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Fabii were highly provoked at ſo haughty an anſwer; but, diſſembling their reſentment, deſired leave&nbsp;to gb into the town, under pretence of conferring with&nbsp;the magiſtrates. But they were no ſooner there, than&nbsp;they began to ſtir up the inhabitants to à vigorous defence ; nay, forgetting their character, they put themſelves at the head of the beſieged in a ſally, in which&nbsp;Q. Fabius, the chief of the ambaſſadors, flew with his&nbsp;own hand one of the principal officers of the Gauls.&nbsp;Hereupon Brennus, calling the gods to witneſs the per-fidiouſneſs of the Romans, and their violating the law&nbsp;of nations, immediately broke up the ſiege of Cluſium,&nbsp;and marched leiſurely to Rome, having ſent an herald&nbsp;before him to demand that thoſe ambaſſadors, who had&nbsp;ſo manifeſtly violated the law of nations, ſhould be delivered up to him. The Roman ſenate was. greatly&nbsp;perplexed between their regard for the law of nations&nbsp;and their affection for the Fabii. The wiſeſt of the&nbsp;ſenate thought the demand of the Gauls to be but juſt&nbsp;and reaſonable : however, as it concerned perſons of&nbsp;great conſequence and credit, the conſcript fathers re∙&nbsp;ferred the affair to the people aſſembled by curiæ. As&nbsp;the Fabian family was very popular, the curiæ were ſo&nbsp;far from coûdemning the three brothers, that, at the&nbsp;next election of military tribunes, they were choſen the</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
