a term which the modern improvements in knowledge have made it neceſſary to introduce into phyſico-mathematical ſcience. It was found convenient to diſtribute the doctrines of univerſal mechanics into two claſſes, which required both a different mode of conſideration and different principles of reaſoning.</p><p>Till the time of Archimedes little ſcience of this kind was poſſeſſed by the ancients, from whom we have received the firſt rudiments. His inveſtigation of the centre of gravity, and his theory of the lever, are the foundations of our knowledge of common mechanics ; and his theory of the equilibrium of floating bodies contains the greateſt part of our hydroſtatical knowledge. But it was as yet limited to the ſimpleſt caſes ; and there were ſome in which Archimedes was ignorant, or was miſtaken. The marquis Guido Ubuldi, in 1578, publiſhed his theory of mechanics, in which the doctrines of Archimedes were well explained and conſiderably augmented. Stevinus, the celebrated Dutch engineer, publiſhed about <hi rend="italic">20</hi> years after an excellent ſystem of mechanics, containing the chief principles which now form the ſcience of equilibrium among ſolid bodies. In particular, he gave the theory of inclined planes, which was unknown to the ancients, though it is of the very firſt importance in almoſt every machine. He even ſtates in the moſt expreſs terms the principle afterwards made the foundation of the whole of mecha nies, and publiſhed as a valuable discovery by Varignon, viz. that three forces, whoſe directions and intentities are as the sides of a triangle, balance each other. His theory of the preſſure of fluids, or hydrostaties, is no leſs eſtimable, including every thing that is now received as a leading principle in the ſcience. When we conſider the ignorance, even of the moſt learned, of that age in mechanical or phyſico-mathematical knowledge, we muſt conſider thoſe performances as the works of a great genius, and we regret that they are ſo little known, being lost in a croud of good writings on thoſe ſubjects which appeared ſoon after.</p><p>Hitherto the attention had been turned entirely to equilibrium, and the circumſtances neceſſary for producing it. Mechanicians indeed saw, that the energy of a machine might be ſomehow meaſured by the force which could be oppoſed or overcome by its intervention : but they did not remark, that the force which prevented its motion, but did no more than prevent it, was an <hi rend="italic">exact</hi> meaſure of its energy, becauſe it was in immediate equilibrio with the preſſure exerted by that part of the machine with which it was connected. If this oppoſed force was leſs, or the force acting at the other extremity of the machine was greater, the mechanicians knew that the machine would move, and that work would be performed ; but what would be the rate of its motion or its performance, they hardly pretended to conjecture. They had not ſtudied the action of moving forces, nor conceived what was done when motion was communicated.</p><p>The great Galileo opened a new field of ſpeculation in his work on Local Motion. He there considers a change of motion as the indication and exact and adequate meaſure of a moving force; and he considers every kind of preſſure as competent to the production of ſuch changes. — He contented himſelf with the application of this principle to the motion of bodies by the action of gravity, and gave the theory of projectiles, which remains to this day without change, and only improved by conſidering the changes which are produced in it by the reſiſtance of the air.</p><p>Sir Iſaac Newton took up this ſubject nearly as Galileo had left it. For, if we except the theory of the centrifugal forces ariſing from rotation, and the theory of pendulums, publiſhed by Huygens, hardly any thing had been added to the ſcience of motion. Newton conſidered the ſubject in its utmoſt extent ; and in his mathematical principles of natural philoſophy he conſiders every conceivable variation of moving force, and determines the motion reſulting from its action.—His firſt application of theſe doctrines was to explain the celeſtial motions ; and the magnificence of the ſubject cauſed it to occupy for a while the whole attention of the mathematicians. But the ſame work contained propoſitions equally conducive to the improvement of common mechanics, and to the complete underſtanding of the mechanical actions of bodies. Philoſophers began to make theſe applications alſo. They ſaw that every kind of work which is to be performed by a machine may be conſidered abſtractedly as a retarding force; that the impulſe of water or wind, which are employed as moving powers, act by means of preſſures which they exert on the impelled point of the machine ; and that the machine itſelf may be conſidered as an aſſemblage of bodies moveable in certain limited circumſtances, with determined directions and proportions of velocity. From all theſe considerations reſulted a general abſtract condition of a body acted on by known powers. And they found, that after all conditions of equilibrium were ſatisfied, there remains a ſurplus of moving force. They could now ſtate the motion which will enſue, the new reſiſtance which this will excite, the additional power which this will abſorb ; and they at laſt determined a new kind of equilibrium, not thought of by the ancient mechanicians, between the reſiſtance to the machine performing work and the moving power, which exactly balance each other, and is indicated, not by the <hi rend="italic">rest,</hi> but by the <hi rend="italic">uniform motion of</hi> the machine.—In like manner, the mathematician was enabled to calculate that precise motion of water which would completely abſorb, or, in the new language, balance the ſuperiority of preſſure by which water is forced through a sluice, a pipe, or canal, with a constant velocity.</p><p>Thus the general doctrines of motion came to be conſidered in two points of view, according as they balanced each other in a state of rest or of uniform motion. Theſe two ways of conſidering the ſame ſubject required both different principles and a different manner of reaſoning. The firſt has been named <hi rend="smallcaps">Statics,</hi> as ex-<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0737.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s05-0731"/>
preſſing that rest which is the test of this kind of equilibrium. The ſecond has been called <hi rend="smallcaps">Dynamics</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Universal Mechanics,</hi> becauſe the different kinds of motion are characteristic of the powers or forces which produce them. A knowledge of both is indiſpensably necessary for acquiring any uſeful practical knowledge of machines : and it was ignorance of the doctrines of accelerated and retarded motions which made the progreſs of practical mechanical knowledge ſo very slow and imperfect. The mechanics, even of the moderns, before Galileo, went no further than to ſtate the proportion of the power and reſiſtance which would be balanced by the intervention of a given machine, or the proportion of the parts of a machine by which two known forces may balance each other, This view of the matter introduced a principle, which even Galileo conſidered as a mechanical axiom, viz. that <hi rend="italic">what is gained in force by means of a machine is exactly ccmpenſated by the additional time which it obliges us to employ.</hi> This is falſe in every instance, and not only prevents improvement in the conſtruction of machines, but leads us into erroneous maxims of conſtruction. The true principles of dynamics teach us, that there is a certain proportion of the machine, dependent on the kind and proportion of the power and reſiſtance, which enables the machine to perform the greatest poſſible work.</p><p>It is highly proper therefore to keep ſeparate theſe two ways of conſidering machines, that both may be improved to the utmost, and then to blend them together in every practical diſcuſſion.</p><p>Statics therefore is preparatory to the proper study of mechanics ; but it does not hence derive all its importance. It is the ſole foundation of many uſeful parts of knowledge. This will be best ſeen by a brief enumeration.</p><p>1. It comprehends all the doctrines of the excitement and propagation of preſſure through the parts of ſolid bodies, by which the energies of machines are produced. A preſſure is exerted on the impelled point of a machine, ſuch as the float-boards or buckets of a mill-wheel. This <hi rend="italic">excites</hi> a preſſure at the pivots of its axle, which act on the points of ſupport. This must be understood, both as to direction and intenſity, that it may be effectually refilled. A preſſure is alſo excited at the acting tooth of the cog-wheel on the ſame axle, by which it urges round another wheel, exciting ſimilar preſſures on its pivots and on the acting tooth perhaps of a third wheel.—Thus a preſſure is ultimately excited in the working point of the machine, perhaps a wiper, which lifts a heavy stamper, to let it fall again on ſome matter to be pounded. Now ſtatics teaches us the intensities and direction of all thoſe preſſures, and therefore how much remains at the working point of the machine unbalanced by reſiſtance.</p><p>2. It comprehends every circumſtance which influences the liability of heavy bodies; the inveſtigation and properties of the centre of gravity ; the theory of the conſtruction of arches, vaults, and domes ; the attitudes of animals.</p><p>3. The ſtrength of materials, and the principles of conſtruction, ſo as to make the proper adjuſtment of ſtrength and ſtrain in every part of a machine, edifice, or structure of any kind. Statics therefore furniſhes us with what may be called <hi rend="italic">a theory of carpentry,</hi> and gives us proper instructions for framing floors, roofs, centres, &amp;c.</p><p>4. Statics comprehends the whole doctrine of the preſſure of fluids, whether liquid or aeriform, whether ariſing from their weight or from any external action. Hence therefore we derive our knowledge of the stability of ſhips, or their power of maintaining themſelves in a poſition nearly upright, in oppoſition to the action of the wind on their sails. We learn on what circumſtances of figure and ſtowage this quality depends, and what will augment or diminiſh it.</p><p>Very complete examples will be given in the remaining part of this work of the advantages of this ſeparate consideration of the condition of a machine at rest and in working motion ; and in what yet remains to be delivered of the hydraulic doctrines in our account of WATER-Works in general, will be perceived the propriety of ſtating apart the equilibrium which is indicated by the uniform motion of the fluid. The obſervations too which we have to make on the ſtrength of the materials employed in our edifices or mechanical ſtructures, will be examples of the inveſtigation of thoſe powers, preſſures, or ſtrains, which are excited in all their parts.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
