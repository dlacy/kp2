<p><span class="font1">that on the grant of the reversion the tenant should have the opportunity of objecting to the substitution of a new landlord.&nbsp;It was therefore necessary that he should attorn tenant to the&nbsp;purchaser. Without such attornment the grant was void, unless&nbsp;indeed attornment were compelled by levying a fine. The necessity of attornment was abolished by 4 &amp; 5 Anne c. 16. Its only&nbsp;use at present seems to be in the case of mortgage. A mortgagor&nbsp;in possession sometimes attorns tenant to the mortgagee in order&nbsp;that the latter may treat him as his tenant and distrain for his&nbsp;interest as rent. The legal view that rent was incident to the&nbsp;reversion led at common law to a destruction of Jhe rent by destruction of the reversion. This would chiefly happen in the case&nbsp;of an under-tenant and his immediate reversioner, if the intermediate became merged in the superior reversion. To obviate&nbsp;this difficulty it was provided by the Real Property Act 1845, § 9,&nbsp;that, on surrender or merger of a reversion expectant on a lease,&nbsp;the rights under it should subsist to the reversion conferring the&nbsp;next vested right. The question as to what covenants run with the&nbsp;reversion is one of the most difficult in law. The rule of common&nbsp;law seems to have been that covenants ran with the land but not&nbsp;with the reversion, that is to say, the benefit of them survived to&nbsp;a new tenant but not to a new landlord. The effect of the act&nbsp;of 32 Hen. VIII. c. 34, and of the Conveyancing Act 1881, has been&nbsp;to annex to the reversion as a general rule the benefit of the rent&nbsp;and the lessee’s covenants and the burden of the lessor’s covenant.&nbsp;Merely collateral covenants, however, do not run with the reversion,&nbsp;but are regarded as personal contracts between lessor and lessee.&nbsp;At common law on tne severance of a reversion a grantee of part&nbsp;of the reversion could not take advantage of any condition for&nbsp;re-entry, on the ground that the condition was entire and not&nbsp;severable. This doctrine was abolished by one of Lord St Leonard’s&nbsp;Acts in 1859. The Conveyancing Act 1881, § 12, now provides&nbsp;in wider terms than those of the act of 1859 that on severance of&nbsp;the reversion every condition capable of apportionment is to be&nbsp;apportioned. In order to guard against fraudulent concealment&nbsp;•of the death of a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">cestui que vie,</span><span class="font1"> or person for whose life any lands are&nbsp;held by another, it was provided by 6 Anne c. 18 that on application to the court of chancery by the person entitled in remainder,&nbsp;reversion or expectancy, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">cestui que vie</span><span class="font1"> should be produced to&nbsp;the court or its commissioners, or in default should be taken to be&nbsp;dead. In Scotland reversion is generally used in a sense approaching&nbsp;that of the equity of redemption of English law. A reversion is&nbsp;either legal, as in an adjudication, or conventional, as in a wadset:&nbsp;Reversions are registered under the system established by the Act&nbsp;1617 c. 16.</span></p>

Similar powers of remand or committal to&nbsp;prison during adjournments are given to justices in the exercise&nbsp;of their summary criminal jurisdiction, whether as to offences&nbsp;punishable only on summary conviction, or as to indictable&nbsp;offences with which it is proposed to deal summarily (Summary&nbsp;Jurisdiction Acts 1848, s. 16, and 1879, s. 24).</span></p>

For this purpose remand homes have been&nbsp;established.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">REMBRANDT (1606-1669). </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rembrandt Harmens van Rijn,</span><span class="font2"> Dutch painter, was born in Leiden on the 15th of July&nbsp;1606. It is onlywithin the past fifty years that we have come&nbsp;to know anything of his real history. A tissue of fables formerly&nbsp;represented him as ignorant, boorish and avaricious. These&nbsp;fictions, resting on the loose assertions of Houbraken </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(De Groote&nbsp;Schouburgh,</span><span class="font2"> 1718), have been cleared away by the untiring&nbsp;researches of Scheltema and other Dutchmen, notably by C.&nbsp;Vosmaer, whose elaborate work </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Rembrandt, sa vie et ses œuvres;&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">1868, 2nd ed., 1877) is the basis of Ourknowledgeof the man and&nbsp;of the chronological development of the artist.@@<sup>1</sup> Rembrandt’s&nbsp;high position in European art rests on the originality of his&nbsp;mind, the power of his imagination, his profound sympathy&nbsp;with his subjects, the boldness of his system of light and shade,&nbsp;the thoroughness of his modelling, his subtle colour, and above&nbsp;all on his intense humanity. He was great in conception&nbsp;and in execution, a poet as well as a painter, an idealist and&nbsp;also a realist; and this rare union is the secret of his power.&nbsp;From his dramatic action and mastery of expression Rembrandt&nbsp;has been well called “ the Shakespeare of Holland.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the beginning of the 17th century Holland had entered on her grand career of national enterprise. Science and literature&nbsp;flourished in her universities, poetry and the stage were favoured&nbsp;by her citizens, and art found a home not only in the capital&nbsp;but in the provincial towns. It was </span><span class="font1">a </span><span class="font2">time also of new ideas.&nbsp;Old conventional forms in religion, philosophy and art had&nbsp;fallen away, and liberty was inspiring new conceptions. There&nbsp;were no church influences at work to fetter the painter in the&nbsp;choice and treatment of his subject, no academies to prescribe&nbsp;rules. Left to himself, therefore, the artist painted the life of&nbsp;the people among whom he lived and the subjects which interested them. It was thus a living history that he painted—&nbsp;scenes from the everyday life and amusements of the people,&nbsp;as well as the civic rulers, the “ regents ” or governors of the&nbsp;hospitals and the heads of the guilds, and the civic guards who&nbsp;defended their towns. So also with refigious pictures. The&nbsp;dogmas and legends of the Church of Rome were no longer of&nbsp;interest to such a nation; but the Bible was read and studied&nbsp;with avidity, and from its page the artist drew directly the scenes&nbsp;of the simple narrative. Perhaps the earliest trace of this new&nbsp;aspect of Bible story is to be found in the pictures painted&nbsp;in Rome about the beginning of the 17th century by Adam&nbsp;Elsheimer of Frankfort, who had undoubtedly a great influence&nbsp;on the Dutch painters studying in Italy. These in their turn&nbsp;carried back to ' Holland the simplicity and the picturesque&nbsp;effect which they found in Elsheimer’s work. Among these,&nbsp;the precursors of Rembrandt, may be mentioned Moeyaert,&nbsp;Ravesteyn, Lastman, Pinas, Honthorst and Bramer. Influenced&nbsp;doubtless by these painters, Rembrandt determined to work out&nbsp;his own ideas of art on Dutch soil, resisting apparently every&nbsp;inducement to visit Italy. Though an admirer of the great&nbsp;Italian masters, he yet maintained his own individuality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Rembrandt was born at No. 3 Weddesteg, on the rampart at Leiden overlooking the Rhine. He was the fourth son of&nbsp;Gerrit Harmens van Rijn, a well-to-do miller. As the older&nbsp;boys had been sent to trade, his parents resolved that he should&nbsp;enter a learned profession. With this view he was sent to the&nbsp;High School at Leiden; but the boy soon manifested his dislike&nbsp;of the prospect, and determined to be a painter. Accordingly&nbsp;he was placed for three years under Swanenburch, a painter of&nbsp;no great merit, who enjoyed some reputation from his having&nbsp;studied in Italy. His next master was Lastman of Amsterdam,&nbsp;a painter of very considerable power. In Lastman’s works we&nbsp;can trace the germs of the colour and sentiment of his greater&nbsp;pupil, though his direct influence cannot have been great, as&nbsp;it is said by Orlers that Rembrandt remained with him only six&nbsp;months, after which time he returned to Leiden, about 1623.&nbsp;During the early years of his life at Leiden Rembrandt seems&nbsp;to have devoted himself entirely to studies, painting and etching&nbsp;the people around him, the beggars and cripples, every picturesque face and form he could get hold of. Life, character,</span></p>
