                Ordinem</hi>@@<hi rend="italic">1</hi>—The two-staged procedure, first <hi rend="italic">in jure</hi>  and then <hi rend="italic">in judicio,</hi>  constituted the <hi rend="italic">ordo judicioruin priva-torum.</hi>  Early in the empire, however, it became the practice in certain cases to abstain from adjusting a <hi rend="italic">formula</hi>  and making a remit to a <hi rend="italic">judex,</hi>  and to leave the cause in the hands of the magistrate from beginning to end. This course was adopted sometimes because the claim that was being made rested rather on moral than on legal right, and sometimes in order to avoid unnecessary disclosure of family misunderstandings. Thus, the earliest questions that were raised about testamentary trusts were sent for consideration and disposal to the consuls, apparently because, in the existing state of jurisprudence, it was thought incompetent for a beneficiary to maintain in reference to the heir (who had only been <hi rend="italic">requested </hi>to comply with the testator’s wishes) that he was bound in law <hi rend="italic">(dare oportere)</hi>  to pay him his bequest. Had the difficulty arisen at an earlier period, and in the heyday of the constructive energy of the praetors, they would probably have solved it with an <hi rend="italic">actio in factum.</hi>  As it was, it fell to the emperors to deal with it, and they adopted the method of <hi rend="italic">extraordinaria cognitio,</hi>  the jurisdiction which they in the first instance conferred on the consuls being before long confided to a magistrate specially designated for it,— the <hi rend="italic">praetor fideicommissarius.</hi>  Questions between tutors and their pupil wards in like manner began to be dealt with <hi rend="italic">extra ordinem, </hi>the cognition being entrusted by Marcus Aurelius to <hi rend="italic">a praetor tute-laris</hi>; while fiscal questions in which a private party was interested went to <hi rend="italic">a. praetor fisci,</hi>  whose creation was due to Nerva. Claims for aliment between parent and child or patron and freedman rested on natural duty rather than on legal right; they could not therefore well be made the subject-matter of a <hi rend="italic">judicium,</hi>  and consequently went for disposal to the consuls or the city prefect, and in the provinces to the governor. Questions of status, especially of freedom or slavery, at least from the time of Marcus Aurelius, were also disposed of <hi rend="italic">extra ordinem</hi>; and so were claims by physicians, advocates, and public teachers for their <hi rend="italic">honoraria,</hi>  and by officials for their salaries, the Romans refusing to admit that these could be recovered by an ordinary action of location. In all those extraordinary cognitions the procedure began with a complaint addressed to the magistrate, instead of an <hi rend="italic">in jus vocatio of</hi>  the party complained against; it was for the magistrate to require the attendance of the latter <hi rend="italic">(evocatio) if</hi>  he thought the complaint relevant. The decision was a <hi rend="italic">judicatura</hi>  or <hi rend="italic">decretum</hi>  according to circumstances.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Jural Remedies flowing directly from the
                Magistrate's Imperium.</hi>@@<hi rend="italic">2 </hi>—Great as were the results for the law of the multiplication and simplification of <hi rend="italic">judicia</hi>  through the formular system, it may be questioned whether it did not benefit quite as much from the direct intervention of the praetors in certain cases in virtue of the supreme power with which they were invested. This manifested itself principally in the form of (1) interdicts ; (2) praetorian stipulations; (3) <hi rend="italic">missio in possessionem</hi>  ; and (4) <hi rend="italic">in integrum restitutio.</hi></p><p>1. The interdicts@@<hi rend="sup">3</hi> have already been referred to as in use under the<hi rend="italic">regime</hi>  of the <hi rend="italic">jus civile</hi>; but their number and scope were vastly increased under that of the <hi rend="italic">jus praetorium.</hi>  The characteristic of the procedure by interdict was this,—that in it the praetor reversed the ordinary course of things, and, instead of waiting for an inquiry into the facts alleged by a complainer, provisionally assumed them to be true and pronounced an order upon the respondent, which he was bound either to obey or show to be unjustified. The order pronounced might be either restitutory, exhibitory (in both cases usually spoken of in the texts as a decree), or prohibitory:—restitutory, when, for example, the respondent was ordained to restore something he was alleged to have taken possession of by violent means, to remove impediments he had placed in the channel of a river, and so on ; exhibitory, when he was ordained to produce something he was unwarrantably detaining, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi>  the body of a freeman he was holding as his slave, or a will in which the complainer alleged that he had an interest; prohibitory, as, for example, that he should not disturb the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi>  of possession as between the complainer and himself, that he should not interfere with a highway, a watercourse, the access to a sepulchre, and so forth. If the respondent obeyed the order pronounced in a restitutory or exhibitory decree, there was an end of the matter. But frequently, and perhaps more often than not, the interdict was only the commencement of a litigation, facilitated by sponsions and restipulations, in which the questions had to be tried (1) whether the interdict or injunction was justified, (2) -whether there had been breach of it, and, (3) if so, what damages were due in consequence. The procedure therefore was often anything but summary.</p><p>In the possessory interdicts <hi rend="italic">uti possidetis</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">utrubi</hi>  in particular it was extremely involved, due to some extent to the fact that they were double interdicts <hi rend="italic">(interdicta duplicia), i.e.,</hi>  addressed indifferently to both parties. Gaius says, but, as most jurists think, erroneously, that they had been devised as ancillary to a litigation about ownership, and for the purpose of deciding which of the parties, as possessor, was to have the advantage of standing on the defensive in the <hi rend="italic">rei
                    vindicatio.</hi>@@<hi rend="italic">4</hi>That they were so used in his time, as in that of Justinian, cannot be doubted. But it is amazing that they should have been, for they were infinitely more cumbrous than the <hi rend="italic">vindicatio</hi>  to which they led up. Take the interdict <hi rend="italic">uti possidetis,</hi>  which applied to immovables, as <hi rend="italic">utrubi</hi>  did to movables. Both parties being present, the prsetor addressed them to this effect: “I forbid that one of you two who does not possess the house in question to use force in order to prevent the other who is in possession, provided he is so neither by clandestine or violent exclusion of the first, nor in virtue of a grant from him during pleasure, from continuing to possess as at present.” It is manifest that this decided nothing; it was no more than a prohibition of disturbance of the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi>  ; it left the question entirely open which of the parties it was that was in possession, and which that was forbidden to interfere. The manner of its explication was somewhat singular. Each of the parties was bound at once to commit what in the case of one of them must have been a breach of the interdict, by a pretence of violence offered to the other <hi rend="italic">(vis ex conventu)</hi>@@<hi rend="italic">5</hi>  each of them was thus in a position to say to the other —“We have both used force ; but it was you alone that did it in defiance of the interdict, for it is I that am in possession. ” The interim enjoyment of the fruits was then awarded to the highest bidder, who gave his stipulatory promise to pay for them to his adversary in the event of the latter being successful in the long run; penal sponsions and restipulations were exchanged upon the question which of them had committed a breach of the interdict; and on these, four in number, <hi rend="italic">formulae</hi>  were adjusted and sent to a <hi rend="italic">judex for</hi>  trial. If the procedure could not thus be explicated, because either of the parties declined to take part in the <hi rend="italic">vis ex conventu,</hi>  or the bidding, or the sponsions and restipulations, he was assumed to be in the wrong, and, by what was called a secondary interdict, required to abstain from disturbing the other “in all time coming.” Whatever we may think of the action system of the Romans in the period of the classical jurisprudence, one cannot help standing aghast at a procedure so cumbrous and complex as that of their possessory interdicts.</p><p>2.    A praetorian stipulation@@<hi rend="sup">6 </hi>was a stipulatory engagement imposed upon a man by a magistrate or judge, in order to secure a third party from the chance of loss or prejudice through some act or omission either of him from whom the engagement was exacted or of some other person for whom he was responsible. Although called praetorian, because the cases in which such stipulations were exigible were set forth in the<hi rend="italic">Edict,</hi>  there can be no question that they originated in the <hi rend="italic">jus civile</hi>; in fact they were just a means of assuring to a man in advance the benefit of an action of the <hi rend="italic">jus civile</hi>  whereby he might obtain reparation for any injury suffered by him through the occurrence of the act or omission contemplated as possible. Ulpian classifies them as cautionary <hi rend="italic">(cauti anales),</hi>  judicial, and common. The first were purely precautionary, and quite independent of any action already in dependence between the party moving the magistrate to exact the stipulation and him on whom it was desired to impose it. There were many varieties of them, connected with all branches of the law,— for example, the <hi rend="italic">cautio damni infecti,</hi>  security against damage to a man’s property in consequence, say, of the ruinous condition of his neighbour’s house, the <hi rend="italic">cautio usufructuaria</hi>  that property usufructed should revert unimpaired to the owner on the expiry of the usufructuary’s life interest, the sedilian stipulation against faults in a thing sold, and so forth. In all these cases the stipulation or <hi rend="italic">cautio</hi>  was a guarantee against future loss or injury, usually corroborated by sureties, and made effectual by an action on the stipulation in the event of loss or injury resulting. J udicial stipulations, according to Ulpian’s classification, were those imposed by a judge in the course of and with reference to an action in dependence before him, as, for example, the <hi rend="italic">cautio judicatum solvi</hi>  (that the defendant would satisfy the judgment), the <hi rend="italic">cautio de dolo</hi>  (that a thing claimed in the action would not be fraudulently impaired in the meantime), and many others. Common were such as might either be imposed by a magistrate apart from any depending action or by a judge in the course of one, such as that taken from a guardian for the faithful administration of his office, or from a procurator that his principal would ratify what he did.</p><p>3.    <hi rend="italic">Missio in possessionem</hi>  was the putting of a person in possession</p><p>@@@See Keller (as on p. 681, note 1), § 81; Bethmann-Hollweg (as in same note), vol. ii. § 122 ; Bekker (as in same note), vol. ii. chap. 23 ; Baron,<hi rend="italic">Gesch. d. röm.
