The rival armies met near Philippi ; and two separate battles were fought before the victory was decided. In the first, the division commanded by Cassius was defeated ; and he, thinking the battle lost, slew himself in despair. Brutus, however, had been victorious with his division ; and the two antagonist armies, rallying each on its unbroken half, remained ready for another trial of strength. This took place within about twenty days after the first, and on nearly the same ground. The struggle was fierce, obstinate, and bloody ; but at length the troops of Brutus gave way, fled, and were scattered in total rout and dismay. Brutus, disdaining to survive this, the last convulsive effort of the republic, fell on his own sword, and died. The conduct of Octavius and Antony, after their victory, bore a greater resemblance to that of Sylla and Marius, than of Cæsar, whose memory they would have more honoured by imitating his clemency, than by a bloody revenge of his death.</p><p>The utter ruin of the republican party was followed by a period of disgraceful intrigues, jarrings, and contests, amoyg the usurpers, and their corrupt friends and followers. Antony traversed Greece, and part of Asia, luxuriating in the pomp, the homage, the flatteries, and the voluptuousness of the East. At one time he meditated a war against the Parthians, to redeem the fame of Rome, which had been tarnished by the defeat of Crassus ; but meeting with Cleopatra, he abandoned his dreams of glory, and resigned himself to the debasing delights of loose licentiousness, beneath the syren spell of tllis abandoned beauty.</p><p>Octavius, on the other hand, returned to Italy, and prosecuted his deep-laid schemes for securing the sole possession of despotic power. He was repeatedly disturbed by the intrigues and the violence of Lucius, the brother, and Fulvia, the wife, of Antony ; but at last, the rupture having come to an open war, they were defeated ; their chief strength, Perusia, was taken, and Octavius secured in the undisturbed command of Italy. The tidings of this contest drew Antony from Egypt, and a war between him and Octavius seemed on the point of breaking out. At this juncture Fulvia died ; and instead of a war, a new alliance was formed between the jealous triumvirs, Antony receiving in marriage Octavia, the sister of Octavius. In this new division of the Roman dominions, Sextus Pompey was admitted to a participation.</p><p>But their hollow agreement was of no long duration. New jealousies arose between Octavius and Lepidus, and new wars with Pompey. Being defeated by Octavius, Sextus Pompey fled to Asia, and was there slain by one of Antony’s lieutenants. Lepidus was soon afterwards deprived of his share in the triumvirate ; and Antony and Octavius divided the whole power between them. Little cordiality subsisted between these partners, or rather rivals ; but a decided quarrel was delayed in consequence of their distance from each other, and the different regions in which they sought for an extension of fame and dominion. Antony was still desirous of triumphing over the Parthians, but he met with little success, except where his troops were led by Ventidius. Octavius 'found employment for his legions in Dalmatia and Pannonia, into which the arms of Rome had scarcely before penetrated. At length the conduct of Antony thoroughly disgusted all his friends at Rome. Octavia set out for the East, hoping to recall her husband to some sense of his duty to Rome, to her, and to himself; but the infatuated man, unable to break through the fascinations of Cleopatra, refused to see Octavia, ordered her to return home, and even sent her a divorce. This insult Octavius could not brook. Antony was deprived of his consulship by a decree of tlle senate, and both parties prepared for another war.</p><lb/><p>Mutual jealousy had long anticipated such a contest, and they were both in readiness at once to rush to the arbitration of arms. The forces of Antony were the more numerous ; those of Octavius the better disciplined, and led by generals of great skill and judgment. Their armaments, both military and naval, came within sight of each other on the opposite sides of the entrance to the gulf of Ambrasia in Epirus. For some time they remained comparatively inactive, watching each other’s movements. At length the two hostile fleets met off the promontory of Actium, that of Octavius led by Agriopa, that of Antony by himself and Cleopatra. The battle began, in sight of the land forces on either side, and was continued with equal courage and fortune, till Cleopatra, terrified by the dreadful scene, turned her galley and fled, followed by sixty of the Egyptian vessels, and soon after by Antony himself. The deserted fleet of Antony maintained a brave resistance for some hours after his flight ; but at length was completely overpowered and destroyed, three hundred ships being sunk or taken, and the whole strand covered with wrecks, and the bodies of the dead. For several days the army of Antony could not believe that he had deserted them ; and remained in anxious expectation of his arrival, to renovate his fortunes on a more stable element. When at last assured of his flight, they entered into terms witll the victor, who was now undisputed lord of both sea and land.</p><p>After this fatal battle, Antony continued his flight to Egypt, a prey at once to shame and to ungovernable τage. For some time he refused to see Cleopatra, whom he accused of having caused his overthrow. But having exhausted his wrath, he returned to the embrace of the ensnaring syren, and again gave himself up to the excesses of voluptuous enjoyment. Meanwhile, the cautious Octavius was drawing his toils closer around his victim. The defences of Egypt were taken or surrendered ; and in a short time Antony was reduced to such straits, that he could neither fight nor fly. Hemmed in, deserted by bis own troops, suspicious of the Egyptians, distracted by jealousy and rage, he lost all self-control, bursting into tierce gusts of frantic passion, then sinking into the stupor of despair. Even Cleopatra became alarmed with these storms of the furious madman, and caused a report to be spread that she was dead. This report roused the Roman in the heart of Antony ; and having nothing now on earth to love, and the path of ambition being closed, he threw himself on his own sword, but failed to inflict a wound immediately mortal. While struggling in the agonies of death, he was told that Cleopatra was still alive. Somewhat reviving at this intelligence, he caused himselfto be carried into the presence of Cleopatra, where, calling for a draught of wine, and fixing his eyes on the fascinating woman, for whose sake he had lost the world, he expired.</p><p>Octavius was now left without a rival, sole master of the Roman world. On seeing the body of Antony he betrayed some emotion ; but gave orders that the utmost attention should be paid to Cleopatra, and especially that she should be prevented from dying by her own hand, as he was anxious that she should adorn his triumphat Rome. She seems to have cherished the hope of gaining the same influence over him that she had enjoyed over Cæsar and Antony ; but the cold and passionless temper of Octavius was proof against her blandishments. Disappointed in this expectation, and dreading the disgrace of being led in captivity to adorn the triumph <hi rend="italic">of</hi>  her conqueror, she eluded the vigilance of her Roman guards, and having imbibed poison, either from the bite of an asp, or from the point of an envenomed needle, death rescued her from that indignity.</p><p>Egypt was then reduced to the form of a Roman province ; and its immense wealth was transported to Rome to replenish the exhausted treasury, and to pay the troops by whom the conquest was thus achieved. Soon after his return to Rome, Octavius received from the senate the ap-</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
