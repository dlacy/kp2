a name given by Mr Kirwan to a new metallic ſubſtance, ſuppoſed to be diſcovered by M. Monnet. It was met with in ſome lead founderies at a place named <hi rend="italic">Poulla οuen</hi> in Brittany; being ſeparated from the lead ore during its torrefaction. It reſembles lead in colour, weight, ſolubility in acids and other properties, but differs from it in being more fuſible, brittle, eaſily ſcoriſied and volatilized, and likewiſe not being miſcible with lead in fuſion. Meſſieurs Haſſenfratz and Girond contended, that this ſaturnite was nothing but a compound of different ſubſtances, and accordingly gave an analyſis of it as conſiſting of lead, copper, iron, ſilver, and ſulphur; the proportions of which muſt naturally vary according to the quality of the ore put into the furnace. M. Monnet, however, infilled that the ſubſtance analyſed by them was not that which he had diſcovered; but when he again viſited the mines above- mentioned, he could meet with none of the ſubſtance there which he found before.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
