<p><label>RELIGION</label>
(Religio) is a Latin word, derived, according to Cicero, <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="1"> <hi rend="italic">lie Natura Dcοrum,</hi> lib. ii. sect. 28, </note> from <hi rend="italic">relegere,</hi> to reconsider ; but, according to Servius and most modem grammarians, from <hi rend="italic">religare,</hi> to bind fast. The reason assigned by the Roman orator for deducing <hi rend="italic">religio</hi> from <hi rend="italic">relego,</hi> is in these words : “ Qui au-</p>
<pb xml:id="eb07-19-r01-0109" facs="eb07_19_Page_120.tif"/><p>tem omnia, quæ ad cultum deorum pertinerent, diligenter retractarent, et tanquam relegerent, sunt dicti <hi rend="italic">religiosi</hi> ex relegendo.” The reason given by Servius for his derivation of the word is “ quod mentem religio religet.” If the Ciceronian etymology be the true one, the word <hi rend="italic">religion</hi> will denote the diligent study of whatever pertains to the worship of the gods ; but, according to the other derivation, which we are inclined to prefer, it denotes that obligation which we feel on our minds from the relation in which we stand to some superior power. In either case, the import of the word religion is different from that of theology, since the former signifies a number of practical duties, and the latter a system of speculative truths. Theology is therefore the foundation of religion, or the science from which it springs ; for no man can study what pertains to the worship of superior powers till he believe that such powers exist, or feel any obligation on his mind from a relation of which he knows nothing. The subject, in as far as it can be discussed with advantage in a work of this kind, will accordingly be resumed under the former head. (See Theology.)</p>
