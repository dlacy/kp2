        <p><span class="font1">sympathy with the Greeks and reverence for their past. It is equally
                clear that no other course was open to them. For&nbsp;Rome to have annexed Greece,
                as she had annexed Sicily and&nbsp;Spain, would have been a flagrant violation of
                the pledges she&nbsp;had repeatedly given both before and during the war;
                the&nbsp;attempt would have excited the fiercest opposition, and would&nbsp;probably
                have thrown the Asiatic as well as the European&nbsp;Greeks into the arms of
                Antiochus. But a friendly and independent Greece would be at once a check on
                Macedon, a barrier&nbsp;against aggression from the East, and a promising field
                for&nbsp;Roman commerce. Nor while liberating the Greeks did Rome&nbsp;abstain from
                such arrangements as seemed necessary to secure&nbsp;the predominance of her own
                influence. In the Peloponnese,&nbsp;for instance, the Achaeans were rewarded by
                considerable&nbsp;accessions of territory; and it is possible that the Greek
                states,&nbsp;as allies of Rome, were expected to refrain from war upon
                each&nbsp;other without her consent.@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Antiochus III. of Syria, Philip’s accomplice in the proposal
                partition of the dominions of their common rival, Egypt,&nbsp;returned from the
                conquest of Cocle-Syria (198) to learn&nbsp;first of all that Philip was hard
                pressed by the Romans,&nbsp;and shortly afterwards that he had been
                decisively&nbsp;beaten at Cynoscephalae. It was already too late to&nbsp;assist his
                former ally, but Antiochus resolved at any rate&nbsp;to lose no time in securing for
                himself the possessions of the&nbsp;Ptolemies in Asia Minor and in eastern Thrace,
                which Philip&nbsp;had claimed, and which Rome now pronounced free and independent.
                In 197-96 he overran Asia Minorand crossed&nbsp;into Thrace.@@<sup>2</sup> But
                Antiochus was pleasure-loving,&nbsp;irresolute, and no general, and it was not until
                192&nbsp;that the urgent entreaties of the Aetolians, and the withdrawal&nbsp;of the
                Roman troops from Greece, nerved him to the decisive&nbsp;step of crossing the
                Aegean; even then the force he took with&nbsp;him was so small as to show that he
                completely failed to appreciate the nature of the task before him.@@<sup>3</sup> At
                Rome the prospect&nbsp;of a conflict with Antiochus excited great anxiety, and it
                was&nbsp;not until every resource of diplomacy had been exhausted that&nbsp;war was
                    declared,@@<sup>4</sup> and the real weakness which lay behind the&nbsp;once
                magnificent pretensions of the “king of kings” was revealed.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Had Antiochus acted with energy when in 192 he landed in Greece, he
                might have won the day before the Roman&nbsp;legions appeared. As it was, in spite
                of the warnings&nbsp;of Hannibal,@@<sup>5</sup> who was now in his camp, and of the
                Aetolians,&nbsp;he frittered away valuable time between his pleasures at
                Chalcis&nbsp;and useless attacks on petty Thessalian towns. In 191&nbsp;Glabrio
                landed at the head of an imposing force; and a&nbsp;single battle at Thermopylae
                broke the courage of Antiochus, who&nbsp;hastily recrossed the sea to Ephesus,
                leaving his Aetolian allies&nbsp;to their fate. But Rome could not pause here. The
                safety&nbsp;of her faithful allies, the Pergamenes and Rhodians, and of
                the&nbsp;Greek cities in Asia Minor, as well as the necessity of
                chastising&nbsp;Antiochus, demanded an invasion of Asia. A Roman fleet
                had&nbsp;already (191) crossed the Aegean, and in concert with the fleets
                of&nbsp;Pergamumand Rhodes worsted the navy of Antiochus.&nbsp;In 190 the new consul
                L. Scipio, accompanied by his&nbsp;famous brother, the conqueror of Africa, led the
                Roman legion&nbsp;for the first time into Asia. At Magnesia ad Sipylum, in
                Lydia,&nbsp;he met and defeated the motley and ill-disciplined hosts of
                the&nbsp;great king.@@<sup>6</sup> For the first time the West, under Roman
                leadership, successfully encountered the forces of the East, and&nbsp;the struggle
                began which lasted far on into the days of the&nbsp;emperors. The terms of the peace
                which followed&nbsp;the victory at Magnesia tell their own story
                clearly&nbsp;enough. There is no question, any more than in&nbsp;Greece, of
                annexation; the main object in view is that&nbsp;of securing the predominance of
                Roman interests and influence</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">throughout the peninsula of Asia Minor, and removing to a safe
                distance the only eastern power which could be
                    considered&nbsp;dangerous.@@<sup>7</sup> The line of the Halys and the Taurus
                range, the&nbsp;natural boundary of the peninsula eastward, was established&nbsp;as
                the boundary between Antiochus and the kingdoms, cities&nbsp;and peoples now
                enrolled as the allies and friends of Rome. This&nbsp;line Antiochus was forbidden
                to cross; nor was he to send ships&nbsp;of war farther west than Cape Sarpedon in
                Cilicia. Immediately&nbsp;to the west of this frontier lay Bithynia, Paphlagonia and
                the&nbsp;immigrant Celtic Galatae, and these frontier states, now the&nbsp;allies of
                Rome, served as a second line of defence against attacks&nbsp;from the east. The
                area lying between these “ buffer states ”&nbsp;and the Aegean was organized by Rome
                in such a way as should&nbsp;at once reward the fidelity of her allies and secure
                both her own&nbsp;paramount authority and safety from foreign attack.
                Pergamum&nbsp;and Rhodes were so strengthened—the former by the gift of
                the&nbsp;Chersonese, Lycaonia,Phrygia, Mysia and Lydia, the latter by that&nbsp;of
                Lycia and Caria—as not only amply to reward their loyalty,&nbsp;but to constitute
                them effective props of Roman interests and&nbsp;effective barriers alike against
                Thracian and Celtic raids in the&nbsp;north and Syrian aggression in the south.
                Lastly, the Greek cities&nbsp;on the coast, except those already tributary to
                Pergamum, were&nbsp;declared free, and established as independent allies of
                Rome.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">In a space of little over eleven years (200-189)</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Rome had broken the power of Alexander’s successors and established
                throughout the eastern Mediterranean a&nbsp;Roman protectorate.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">It was in the western half of this protectorate that the first steps
                in the direction of annexation were taken. The enthusiasm&nbsp;provoked by the
                liberation of the Greeks had died&nbsp;away, and its place had been taken by
                feelings of dissatisfied ambition or sullen resentment. Internecine&nbsp;feuds and
                economic distress had brought many parts&nbsp;of Greece to the verge of anarchy,
                and, above all, the&nbsp;very foundations of the settlement effected in 197
                were&nbsp;threatened by the reviving power and aspirations of&nbsp;Macedon. Loyally
                as Philip had aided Rome in the war&nbsp;with Antiochus, the peace of Magnesia
                brought him nothing&nbsp;but fresh humiliation. He was forced to abandon all hopes
                of&nbsp;recovering Thessaly, and he had the mortification to see the&nbsp;hated king
                of Pergamum installed almost on his borders as&nbsp;master of the Thracian
                Chersonese. Resistance at the time&nbsp;was unavailing, but from 189 until his death
                (179) he&nbsp;laboured patiently and quietly to increase the internal resources of
                his own kingdom,@@<sup>8</sup> and to foment, by dexterous intrigue,&nbsp;feelings
                of hostility to Rome among his Greek and barbarian&nbsp;neighbours. His successor,
                Perseus, his son by a left-handed&nbsp;alliance, continued his father’s work. He
                made friends among&nbsp;the Illyrian and Thracian princes, connected himself by
                marriage with Antiochus IV. of Syria and with Prusias of Bithynia,&nbsp;and, among
                the Greek peoples, strove, not without success,&nbsp;to revive the memories of the
                past glories of Greece under the&nbsp;Macedonian leadership of the great
                    Alexander.@@<sup>9</sup> The senate&nbsp;could no longer hesitate. They were
                well aware of the restlessness and discontent in Greece; and after hearing
                from&nbsp;Eumenes of Pergamum, and from their own officers, all details&nbsp;of
                Perseus’s intrigues and preparations, they declared war.@@<sup>10&nbsp;</sup>The
                struggle, in spite of Perseus’s courage and the incapacity at&nbsp;the outset of the
                Roman commanders, was short and decisive.&nbsp;The sympathy of the Greeks with
                Perseus, which had been&nbsp;encouraged by the hitherto passive.attitude assumed by
                Rome,&nbsp;instantly evaporated on the news that the Roman legions were&nbsp;on
                their way to Greece. No assistance came from Prusias or&nbsp;Antiochus, and
                Perseus’s only allies were the Thracian king Cotys&nbsp;and the Illyrian Genthius.
                The victory gained by L. Aemilius&nbsp;Paulus at Pydna^(i68) ended the
                    war.@@<sup>11</sup> Perseus&nbsp;became the prisoner of Rome, and as such died
                in&nbsp;Italy a few years later.@@<sup>12</sup> Rome had begun the war with
