(Denis de), a French writer, famous for being the projector of literary journals, was born at Paris in 1626. He ſtudied the law, and was admitted a counſellor in the parliament of Paris in 1652. It was in 1664 he ſchemed the plan of the <hi rend="italic">Journal des Sçavans;</hi> and the year following began to publiſh it under the name of Sieur de Heronville, which was that of his valet de chambre. But he played the critic ſo ſeverely, that authors, ſurpriſed at the novelty of ſuch attacks, retorted ſo powerfully, that M. de Sallo, unable to weather the ſtorm, after he had publiſhed his third Journal, declined the undertaking, and turned it over to the abbé Gallois; who, without preſuming to criticiſe, contented himſelf merely with giving titles, and making extracts. Such was the origin of literary journals, which afterwards ſprang up in other countries under different titles; and the ſucceſs of them, under judicious management, is a clear proof of their utility. M. de Sallo died in 1669.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
