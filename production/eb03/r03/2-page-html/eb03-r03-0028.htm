<p><span class="font0">Salvator Roſa is ſuſſiciently known as a painter ; but until now we never heard of him as a muſician.&nbsp;Among the muſical manuſcripts purchaſed at Rome&nbsp;by Dr Burney, was a muſic book of Salvator, in&nbsp;which are many airs and cantatas of different ιna-fters, and eight entire cantatas, written, ſet, and&nbsp;tranſcribed by this celebrated painter himſelf. From&nbsp;the ſpecimen of his talents for mufic here given, we&nbsp;make no ſcruple of declaring, that he had a truer genius for this ſcience, in point of melody, than any of his&nbsp;predeceſſors or cotemporaries : there is alſo a ſtrength&nbsp;of expreſſion in his verſes, which ſets him far above the&nbsp;middle rank as a poet. Like moſt other aitiſts of&nbsp;real original merit, he complains of the ill uſage of the&nbsp;world, and the difficulty he finds in procuring a bare&nbsp;fubſiſtence.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">ROSAMOND, daughter of Walter Lord Clifford, was a young lady of exquiſite beauty, fine accomplilh-ments, and bleſſed with a moſt engaging wit and ſweetneſs&nbsp;of temper. She had been educated, according to the&nbsp;cuſtom of the times, in the nunnery of Godſtow ; and&nbsp;the popular ſtory of her is as follows: Henry II. ſaw&nbsp;her, loved her, declared his paſſion, and triumphed over&nbsp;her honour. To avoid the jealouſy of his queen Elinor, he kept her in a wonderful labyrinth at Wood-ſtock, and by his connection with her had William&nbsp;Longſword earl of Saliſhury, and Geoffrey biſhop of&nbsp;Lincoln. O,n Henry’s abſence in France, however,&nbsp;on account of a rebellion in that country, the queen&nbsp;found mea∏6 to diſcover her, and though ſtruck with&nbsp;her beauty, ſhe recalled ſufficient reſentment to poiſon&nbsp;her. The queen, it is ſaid, diſeovered her apartment&nbsp;by a thread of ſilk ; but how ſhe came by it is differently related. This popular ſtory is not however ſupported by hiſtory ; ſeveral writers mention no more of her,&nbsp;than that the queen ſo vented her ſpleen on Roſamond&nbsp;as that the lady lived not long after. Other writers&nbsp;aſſert that ſhe died a natural death; and the ſtory of her&nbsp;being poiſoned is thought to have ariſen from the figure&nbsp;of a cup on her tomb. She was buried in the church&nbsp;of Godſtow, oppoſite to the high altar, where her body&nbsp;remained till it was ordered to be removed with every&nbsp;mark ol diſgrace by Hugh biſhop of Lincoln, in 1191.&nbsp;She was, however, by many conſidered as a faint after&nbsp;her death, as appears from an inſcription on a crois&nbsp;wſhich Leland ſays ſtood near Godſtow :</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">ſaved ; and as a token to them, ſhowed a tree which </span><span class="font1">ſhe </span><span class="font0">ſaid would be turned into a ſtone when ſhe was with&nbsp;the ſaints in heaven. Soon after her death this wonderful metamorphoiis happened, and the ſtone was .&nbsp;ſhown to ſtrangers at Godſtow till the time of the diſſo-lution.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">ROSCOMMON, a county of Ireland, in the province of Connaught, bounded on the well by the river Sue, on the eaſt by the Shannon, on the north by the&nbsp;Curlew mountains, on the ſouth and ſouth eaſt by the&nbsp;King’s county and part of Galway. Its length is 3 £&nbsp;miles, its breadth 28. The air of the county, both&nbsp;on the plains and mountains, is healthy ; the foil yields&nbsp;plenty of graſs with ſome corn, and feeds numerous&nbsp;herds of cattle. The Curlew mountains on the north&nbsp;are very high and ſteep ; and, till a road with great&nbsp;labour and difficulty was cut through them, were im-paffable.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">ROSCOMMON (Wentworth Dillon, earl of), a celebrated poet of the 17th century, was the ſon of&nbsp;James Dillon earl of Roſcommon ; and was born in&nbsp;Ireland, under the adminiſtration of the firſt earl of&nbsp;Strafford, who was his uncle, and from whom he received the name of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Wentworth</span><span class="font0"> at his baptiſm. He&nbsp;paffed his infancy in Ireland ; after which the earl of&nbsp;Strafford ſent for him into England, and placed him at&nbsp;his own ſeat in Yorkſhire, under the tuition of Dr Hall,&nbsp;afterwards biſhop of Norwich, who inſtructed him in&nbsp;Latin, without teaching him the common rules of grammar, which he could never retain in his memory, and&nbsp;yet he learnt to write in that language with claffical elegance and propriety. On the earl of Strafford’s being&nbsp;impeached, he went to complete his education at Caen&nbsp;in Normandy ; and after ſome years travelled to Rome,&nbsp;where he became acquainted with the moſt valuable remains of antiquity, and in particular was well ſkilled in&nbsp;medals, and learned to ſpeak Italian with ſuch grace and&nbsp;fluency, that he was frequently taken for a native.&nbsp;He returned to England ſoon after the Relloration, and&nbsp;was made captain of the band of penſioners ; but a diſ-pute with the lord privy-ſeal, about a part of his eſtate,&nbsp;obliged him to reſign his poſt, and reviſit his native country, where the duke of Ormond appointed him captain&nbsp;oſ the guards.
