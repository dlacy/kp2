Angelo and the baldacchino of St Peter’s ; the bronze weighed 450,000 lb. The bronze tiles of the dome were stolen long before by Constans IL, in 663, but on their way to Constantiiiople they were seized by the Saracens. The portico has eight columns on the front and three on the sides, all granite monoliths except the re</p><p>stored ones on the east</p><p>side,—sixteen in all. The</p><p>capitals are Corinthian, of</p><p>white marble ; the tym</p><p>panum (deτ0s) of the pedi</p><p>ment was filled with bronze</p><p>reliefs of the battle of the</p><p>gods and the giants.@@<hi rend="sup">2</hi> The</p><p>walls of the circular part,</p><p>nearly 20 feet thick, are of</p><p>solid tufa concrete, thinly</p><p>faced with brick. The</p><p>enormous dome, 142 feet 6</p><p>inches in span, is cast in</p><p>concrete made of pumice-</p><p>stone, pozzolana, and lime ;</p><p>being one solid mass, it</p><p>covers the building like a</p><p>shell, free from any lateral</p><p>thrust at the haunches.</p><p>Round the central opening</p><p>or liypæthrum still re</p><p>mains a ring of enriched</p><p>mouldings in gilt bronze,</p><p>the only bit left of the</p><p>bronze which once covered</p><p>the whole dome. The lower</p><p>story of the circular part</p><p>and the walls of the pro- '</p><p>jecting portico were covered</p><p>with slabs of Greek marble ;</p><p>a great part of the latter</p><p>still remains, enriched with</p><p>Corinthian pilasters and bands of sculptured ornament. The two upper stories of the drum were covered outside with hard stucco of pounded marble. Inside the whole was lined with a great variety of rich Oriental marbles. This magnificent interior, divided into two orders by an entablature supported on columns and pilasters, has been much injured by alteration ; but the materials are ancient, and the general effect is probably much the same as it was, not in the time of Agrippa, but after the restorations of Hadrian (Spart., <hi rend="italic">Hadr.,</hi>  181) and Severus, when the magnificently coloured porphyries and Oriental marbles were so largely used.@@<hi rend="sup">3</hi>  About 608 the Pantheon was given by Phocas to Boniface IV., who consecrated it as the church of S. Maria ad Martyres. In 1881-82 the destruction of a row of houses behind the Pantheon exposed remains of a grand hall with richly sculptured entablature on Corinthian columns, part of the great thermæ of Agrippa, which extend beyond the Via della Ciambella (fig. 24). A great part of the thermæ appears from the brick stamps to belong to an extensive restoration in the reign of Hadrian, and bricks of his time are even said to have been found in the facing of the Pantheon itself.@@<hi rend="sup">4 </hi>(See Baths, vol. iii. p. 434<hi rend="italic">sq.)</hi></p><p>Close by the Pantheon is the church of S.

Comm. Arch. Rom.,</hi>  1873). The most perfect is that of the 7th cohort near S. Crisogono in Tras-tevere, a handsome house of the 2d century, decorated with mosaic floors, wall-paintings, &amp;c.@@<hi rend="sup">7</hi></p><p>The excavations made in exposing the ancient church of S.

Arch. Crixt.,</hi>  1870, pt. iv.</p><p>Many remains exist of the Golden House@@<hi rend="sup">8</hi> of Nero, which show that this gorgeous palace covered an almost incredibly large space of ground, extending from the Palatine, over the Velia and the site of the temple of Venus and Rome, to the Esquiline, filling the great valley between the Coelian and the Esquiline where the Colosseum stands, and reaching far over the Esquiline to the great reservoir now called the “Sette Sale.” Noother extravagances or cruelties of Nero appear to have offended the Roman people so much as the erection of this enormous palace, which must have blocked up many important roads and occupied the site of a whole populous quarter. It was no doubt partly to make restitution for this enormous theft of land that Vespasian and Titus destroyed the Golden House and built the Colosseum and public thermæ of Titus @@<hi rend="sup">9</hi> on part of its site. Under the substructions of the latter building extensive remains of the Golden House still exist ; and at one point, at a lower level still, pavements and foundations remain of one of the numerous houses destroyed by Nero to clear the site. The great bronze colossus of Nero, 120 feet high (Suet., <hi rend="italic">Nero,</hi>  31), which stood in one of the porticus of the Golden House, was moved by Vespasian, with head and attributes altered to those of Apollo (Helios), on to the Velia ; and it was moved again by Hadrian, when the temple of Rome was built, on to the base which still exists near the Colosseum. Several coins show this colossus by the side of the Colosseum.</p><p>Under the Palazzo Doria, the church of S. Maria in Via Lata, and other neighbouring buildings extensive remains exist of a great porticus, with long rows of travertine piers ; this building appears to be represented on fragments of the marble plan with the words SAEPT ... LIA. This is probably the Septa Julia, begun by Julius Cæsar, and completed by Agrippa in 27 b,c., as the voting place for the Comitia Centuriata, divided into compartments, one for each century. The building contained rostra, and was also used for gladiatorial shows. Under the later empire it became a bazaar and resort of slave-dealers.</p><p>That curiously planned building on the Esquiline, in the new Piazza Vit. Emmanuele, where the so-called trophies of Marius once were placed (see drawing by Du Perac in his <hi rend="italic">Vestigj),</hi>  is one of the numerous castella or reservoirs from which the water of the various aqueducts was distributed in the quarters they were meant to supply. This was built by Severus Alexander at the termination of his Alexandrine aqueduct, opened in 225 (see Lamprid., <hi rend="italic">Hist. Aug. : Sev. Alex.,</hi>  25). The marble trophies are now set at the top of the Capitoline steps ; their quaιτy mark shows them to be of the time of Domitian : it consists of the following inscription, now not visible, as it is cut on the under part—IMP.

Its first rows of seats, which were of wood, were made under Tarquin I. (Liv., i. 56 ; Dionys., iii. 68). It was restored in 327 and 174 b.c. (Liv., viii. 20 ; xli. 27). In the reign of Julius Cæsar it was rebuilt with (for the first time) lower seats of stone (Plin.,<hi rend="italic">H.N.,</hi>  xxxvi. 24), the upper being still of wood (Suet., <hi rend="italic">Cæs.,</hi>  39) ; Dionysius (iii. 68) describes it as it was after this rebuilding. It was further ornamented with marble by Augustus, Claudius, and other emperors. The. wooden part was burnt in the great fire of Nero, and again under Domitian, by whom it was restored wholly in stone and marble, and lastly it was restored and enlarged by Constantine. In its later state it had a marble façade with three external tiers of arches with engaged columns, and (inside) sloping tiers of marble seats, supported on concrete raking vaults (Plin., <hi rend="italic">Raneg.,</hi>  51). A great part of these vaults existed in the 16th century, and is shown by Du Perac.
