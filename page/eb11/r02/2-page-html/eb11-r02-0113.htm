<p><span class="font1">upper anterior end of the quadrate; between the quadrate, the squamosaI and the long parietal process lies the likewise&nbsp;splint-like supratemporal, attached by most of its length to the&nbsp;parietal process. The jugal has only one arm, and this connects&nbsp;the maxilla with the postorbital, completing the posterior&nbsp;orbital border. There is a wide gap between jugal and quadrate.&nbsp;In Tejidae the arcade is the same, but the squamosal reaches the&nbsp;jugal, both meeting the postorbital. In </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lacerta</span><span class="font1"> the arcade is&nbsp;essentially the same, but the window is completely filled up by&nbsp;the postfrontal, which extends so far back as to reach the supra-temporal. In the Agamidae the&nbsp;arcade is strong and simplified.&nbsp;Postfrontal and postorbital are&nbsp;represented by one forked piece.&nbsp;This squamosal and the postfrontal mass are connected by the&nbsp;upper, miich up-curved end of· the&nbsp;jugal, which is thrust between&nbsp;them.

<p><span class="font1">The chameleons are peculiar. The posttemporal arcade, spanning a wide space, is formed by a long process of the supra-temporal - squamosal,&nbsp;which is directed up-and backwards to join&nbsp;the parietal, which extends back by a long&nbsp;unpaited process. The&nbsp;horizontal arch is broad&nbsp;and short, squamosal&nbsp;and postfrontal, forming a broad suture;&nbsp;below they are joined&nbsp;by the jugal; above&nbsp;the suture lies, in chameleon, a tiny piece,&nbsp;perhaps a vestige of&nbsp;the dislodged post</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">orbital.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The jugal bones, to continue the description of the appendicular parts of the skull, are firmly joined to lateral processes&nbsp;of the pterygoids by the ectopterygoids; further forwards&nbsp;they are extensively connected with the maxillaries. These&nbsp;rest against strong transverse palatine processes. The palatines form a medium symphysis; posteriorly they diverge&nbsp;together with the pterygoids, which articulate with the quad-</span><span class="font0">Supratemporal bridge, generally with the postorbital, sometimes&nbsp;also with the jugal. The more dorsal element is mentioned as&nbsp;supratemporal ; it is always smaller, and mostly restricted to the&nbsp;corner between the squamosal and the parietal process against&nbsp;which it rests. Either of these two elements articulate with the&nbsp;quadrate. Both elements are present in Labyrinthodonts and in&nbsp;most of the extinct groups of reptiles; among recent forms in&nbsp;Lacertidae, Varanidae, Tejidae; one three-armed piece in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sphenodon,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">chameleons and crocodiles, without, in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sphenodon</span><span class="font0"> at least, any trace&nbsp;of a compound nature; one piece, forked, in Agamidae; one simple</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">rates and with the basisphenoid by a pair of strong basiptery-goid processes. A slender vertical rod of bone, the columella cranii, arises from the dorsal surface of each pterygoid and,&nbsp;passing at a distance from the cranial capsule, is sutured to a&nbsp;short lateroventral process of the parietals Such a pair of&nbsp;columellæ exists in nearly all Lacertilia (distinguished by many&nbsp;systematists as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">KionocraniP)</span><span class="font1"> with the exception of the chameleons and the Amphisbaenidae. In many lizards, however,&nbsp;this columella, or epipterygoid, does not quite reach the parietal,&nbsp;leaning instead against the proötic; possibly it has been evolved&nbsp;out of the alisphenoid, and Chelonians seem to support this&nbsp;view. The premaxillary bone is single, except in the Skinks&nbsp;and in some Geckos; ventrally it touches the vomers which&nbsp;vary much in size; they are always paired although suturally&nbsp;connected; posteriorly they pass into, and fuse with, the&nbsp;palatines before these send off their maxillary processes. Between the vomer and its maxillary is a longitudinal hole. Often,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font1"> in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lacerla,</span><span class="font1"> the vomers enclose a median hole near their&nbsp;anterior end, for Jacobson’s organ. DorsalIy the premaxilla&nbsp;sends a median process backwards to the nasals. These are&nbsp;paired, and fuse together only in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Uroplates</span><span class="font1"> and in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Varanus.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">The external nasal fossae are sometimes very large, and their&nbsp;anterior half appears blocked by the ossified turbinals, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font1"> in&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Varanus</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tejus. </span><span class="font1">Prefrontals are always present, often&nbsp;fused with the lacrymals; in Heloderma, in Aniella and in&nbsp;chameleons the prefrontals extend so far back as to meet the&nbsp;postfrontals, excluding thereby the frontals from the orbital&nbsp;rim. The frontals are either paired, as in Varanus, Lacertidae,&nbsp;Heloderma, Anguidae, Scincidae<sub>i</sub>Anelytropsidae, Aniella, Amphis-baenidae, and in some Geckoninae; or they are fused into one&nbsp;bone, as in the Eublepharinae, chameleons, Tejidae, Iguanidae,&nbsp;Agamidae, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Xenosaurus.</span><span class="font1"> The parietals are double in the&nbsp;Geckos, in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Uroplates</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Xantusia*,</span><span class="font1"> in all the others they&nbsp;form one coössified mass, generally with a pineal foramen,&nbsp;except in Eublepharinae, Amphisbaenidae, Tejidae, in Aniella&nbsp;and other degraded forms. In the majority the pineal foramen lies in the middIe of the parietaI, but in the Iguanidae it&nbsp;is near the frontal, and actually in the frontal in chameleons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As regards the brain-case, there is a cartilaginous interorbital septum, connected posteriorly with the slender, bony presphenoid; ventrally on to this is fused a vestige of the&nbsp;parasphenoid, a narrow and thin splint which sometimes can&nbsp;be dislodged. The whole of the anterior wall of the brain-case&nbsp;is membranous, excepting a pair of separate ossifications,&nbsp;which do but rarely touch any of the cranial bones, as frontal,&nbsp;parietal or prootics. The ossifications are irregular in shape,&nbsp;each sending out a downward process which curves inwards&nbsp;almost to meet its fellow; between these issue the olfactory&nbsp;lobes. W. K. Parker recognized them as the alisphenoids;&nbsp;E. D. Cope named them postoptics, and remarked that in&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sphenodon</span><span class="font1"> they coexist with an. Orbitosphenoid bone. The&nbsp;proötic has a notch in its anterior lateral margin for the passage&nbsp;of the trigeminal nerve. The opisthotic portion of the petrosal&nbsp;mass is intimately fused with the lateral occipital bones and&nbsp;their paroccipital process, and sometimes, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.g. Tejus<sub>1</sub></span><span class="font1">  encloses&nbsp;with them many intricate recesses of the middle ear-chamber,&nbsp;which extend also into hollow and swollen thick downward&nbsp;processes of the basioccipital. These cavities of both sides&nbsp;communicate with each other through the cancellous substance&nbsp;of the basioccipital and basisphenoid. There are no Eustachian&nbsp;tubes opening into the mouth through the base of the skull.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The occipital condyle is tripartite, the lateral occipitals partaking of the articulation; very rarely, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font1"> in Amphis-baenidae (see fig. 22), the basioccipital portion is so much&nbsp;reduced that the skull articulates, by two very broad condyles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The halves of the under jaw are but loosely united, either by ligament only or by an at least very movable suture. The&nbsp;jaw is compound and the numerous constituent bones mostly&nbsp;retain their sutures. Besides the dentary and articular, angular&nbsp;and supra-angular on the lateral side, and the opercular&nbsp;or splenial on the inner side, there lies on the dorsal side the&nbsp;coronoid, six pairs in aU.
