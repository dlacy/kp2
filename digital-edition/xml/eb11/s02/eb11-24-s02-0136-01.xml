Sandals are only worn regularly among the peoples of Western civilization by friars, though forms of them are found among the peasants in Spain and the Balkans. They have in recent times been adopted by the extreme advocates of hygienic dress, especially for young children. In the early part of the 19th century a form of low, light slipper fastened by a ribbon crossed over the instep and round the ankle, and worn by women, was known as a sandal.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
