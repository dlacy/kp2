<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Retainer of Debt.—</span><span class="font2">In connexion with the administration of an estate under a will, it is the right of the personal representative—whether executor or administrator—of a deceased&nbsp;person to retain legal assets which have come into his hands&nbsp;towards the payment of a debt due to himself as against&nbsp;creditors of an equal degree, and this even though his debt is&nbsp;barred by the Statutes of Limitation. The privilege arose in&nbsp;all probability from the inability of the representative to sue&nbsp;himself, though it has been suggested that it is merely a corollary&nbsp;to the right of the representative to prefer one creditor to&nbsp;another of equal degree.@@<sup>1</sup> The principle of retainer is not&nbsp;looked upon with favour by courts of equity, and consequently&nbsp;it has long been the rule that there is no right to retain out of&nbsp;equitable assets. It was thought that the effect of the Land&nbsp;Transfer Act 1897 was to make all the assets of the deceased&nbsp;legal assets, and so extend the privilege to reality which had till&nbsp;then been exempt; this view, however, has been repudiated by&nbsp;the courts of equity, and it must now be taken that there is&nbsp;still no right to retain out of real estate.@@<sup>2</sup> It is a rule of the&nbsp;probate division to require a creditor administrator, to whom&nbsp;letters of administration are granted, to enter into a bond with&nbsp;two sureties not to prefer himself. This course, however, is&nbsp;not followed where administration is granted to a person as next&nbsp;of kin who happens also to be a creditor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The privilege is not lost by judgment for an account being given in a suit by other creditors for the administration of&nbsp;assets, and the representative may retain out of assets which&nbsp;come to his hand subsequent to such judgment. On the other&nbsp;hand, the appointment of a receiver deprives the representative&nbsp;of his right except as regards assets which come to his hands&nbsp;prior to the appointment of the receiver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RETALIATION, repayment of like with like, especially the return of hostile action, injuries or wrongs by similar action or&nbsp;injury, as in the primitive theory of punishment, an “ eye for&nbsp;an eye,” “ tooth for a tooth.” The Late Lat. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">retaliare</span><span class="font2"> was formed&nbsp;from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">lalis,</span><span class="font2"> such as, of the same quality as ; and this source also&nbsp;gave </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">talio, talionis,</span><span class="font2"> the name of this type of punishment. (See&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Punishment, Theory of,</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Roman Law, § </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Twelve Tables.)&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">A special form of retaliation is familiar in the imposition of&nbsp;differential import duties against the goods of a particular&nbsp;country (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tariees</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Protection).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RETENE (methyl isopropyl phenanthrene), CisH<sub>18</sub>, a hydrocarbon present in the coal-tar fraction, boiling above 360° C.; it also occurs in the tars obtained by the distillation of resinous&nbsp;woods. It crystallizes in large plates, which melt at 98-5° C. and&nbsp;boil at 390° C. It is readily soluble in warm ether and in hot&nbsp;glacial acetic acid. Sodium and boiling amyl alcohol reduce&nbsp;it to a tetrahydroretene, Jwhilst if it be heated with phosphorus and hydriodic acid to 260° C. a dodecahydride&nbsp;is formed. Chromic acid oxidizes it to retene quinone,&nbsp;phthalic acid and acetic acid. It forms a picrate which melts&nbsp;at 123-124° C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RETFORD (officially </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">East Retford),.</span><span class="font2"> a market town and municipal borough in the Bassctlaw parliamentary division of&nbsp;Nottinghamshire, England, 138I m. N. by W. from London by&nbsp;the Great Northern railway, the station being a junction with&nbsp;the Great Central railway. Pop. (1901) 12,340. The church&nbsp;of St Swithin dates from the 13th century, but was rebuilt&nbsp;in 1658 by a brief granted by Richard Cromwell. Modern&nbsp;buildings are the town hall, the corn exchange, the court house,&nbsp;and the covered markets. There is a large trade in corn and&nbsp;cheese, and the town possesses iron foundries, paper and corn&nbsp;mills, and india-rubber works. The town is governed by a&nbsp;mayor, 6 aldermen, and. 18 councillors. Area, 4656 acres.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The situation of Retford </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">CRedforde, Raiford),</span><span class="font1"> near one of the Roman roads and on the river Idle, where there was possibly a&nbsp;ford, may account for its origin. In 1086 the archbishop of York&nbsp;owned a mill at Retford, and Roger de Busli had rights here.&nbsp;Retford was a borough by prescription, and was in the hands of&nbsp;the crown when, in 1276, Edward I. granted it to the burgesses&nbsp;in fee-farm with the right of electing bailiffs. This charter was&nbsp;confirmed by Edward III., Henry VI. and Elizabeth. In 1607&nbsp;lames I. granted a. charter of incorporation to the bailiffs and&nbsp;burgesses, under which thc town was governed until 1835, when&nbsp;it was rcincorporated under a mayor. East Retford returned two&nbsp;members to parliament in 1315, and again from 1572 till 1885,&nbsp;when it was disfranchised. Henry III. granted the burgesses&nbsp;an eight-days’ fair at Holy Trinity, altered by Edward II. to&nbsp;St Gregory. Edward III. granted a six-days’ fair at St Margaret,&nbsp;and Henry VI. a four-days’ fair at St Matthew. Fairs are now&nbsp;held in March, June, July and December. The market held on&nbsp;Saturdays by prescription was sanctioned by Edward IIL and&nbsp;still exists.</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;">

<p><span class="font2">RETHEL, ALFRED (1816-1859), German historical painter, was born at Aix-la-Chapelle in 1816. He very early showed an&nbsp;interest in art, and at the age of thirteen he executed a drawing&nbsp;which procured his admission to the academy of Düsseldorf.&nbsp;Here he studied for several years, and produced, among other&nbsp;works, a figure of St Boniface which attracted much attention.&nbsp;At the age of twenty he removed to Frankfort, and was selected&nbsp;to decorate the walls of the imperial hall in the Römer with&nbsp;figures of famous men. At the same period he produced a&nbsp;series of designs illustrative of Old Testament history. Four&nbsp;years later he was the successful competitor for the work of&nbsp;ornamenting the restored council house of his native city with&nbsp;frescoes depicting prominent events in the career of Charlemagne,&nbsp;but the execution of this work was delayed for some six years.&nbsp;Meanwhile Rethel occupied himself with the production of easel&nbsp;pictures and of drawings; and in 1842 he began a striking series&nbsp;of designs dealing with the “ Crossing of the Alps by Hannibal,”&nbsp;in which the weird power which animates his later art becomes&nbsp;first apparent. In 1844 Rethel visited Rome, executing, along&nbsp;with other subjects, an altar-piece for one of the churches of&nbsp;his native land. In 1846 he returned to Aix, and commenced&nbsp;his Charlemagne frescoes. But mental derangement, remotely&nbsp;attributable, it is believed, to an accident from which he suffered&nbsp;in childhood, began to manifest itself. While he hovered between&nbsp;madness and sanity, Rethel produced some of the most striking,&nbsp;individual and impressive of his works. Strange legends are&nbsp;told of the effect produced by some of his weird subjects. He&nbsp;painted “ Nemesis pursuing a AIurderer ”—a flat stretch of landscape, with a slaughtered body, while in front is the assassin speeding away into the darkness, and above an angel-of vengeance.&nbsp;The picture, so the story goes, was won in a lottery at Frankfort&nbsp;by a personage of high rank, who had been guilty of an undiscovered crime, and the contemplation of his prize drove him&nbsp;mad. Another design which Rethel executed was “ Death the&nbsp;Avenger,” a skeleton appearing at a masked ball, scraping&nbsp;daintily, like a violinist, upon two human bones. The drawing&nbsp;haunted the memory of his artist friends and disturbed their&nbsp;dreams; and, in expiation, he produced his pathetic design of&nbsp;“ Death the Friend.” Rethel also executed a powerful series of&nbsp;drawings—“ The Dance of Death ”—suggested by the Belgian&nbsp;insurrections of 1848. It is by such designs as these, executed in&nbsp;a technique founded upon that of Durer, and animated by an&nbsp;imagination akin to that of the elder master, that Rethel is&nbsp;most widely known. He died at Düsseldorf on the ist of&nbsp;December 1859.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">His picture of “ Peter and John at the Beautiful Gate of the Temple,” is preserved in the Lelpzig Museum, and his “ St Boniface ” and several of his cartoons for the frescoes at Aix in the&nbsp;Berlin National Gallery. His Life, by Wolfgang Müller von&nbsp;Königswinter, was published in 1861.
