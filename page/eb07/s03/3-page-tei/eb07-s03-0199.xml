In cases where there is no boiler, a very small one must be erected, which can be placed on some part of the furnace, and will thus give off steam without any extra expenditure of fuel.</p><p>The most remarkable circumstance attending the use of this patent process, is the almost total absence of draught through the ash-pit, consequently little or no air passes up through the fire, while there is a rush of air <hi rend="italic">over the surface of the fuel.</hi> Hence the necessity of allowing air to flow in by the door of the furnace, or, which is better, by means of tubes placed in the chimney or flues, by which it is heated previous to its entrance ; because, as before stated, the admission of cold air must have a prejudicial effect. It is evident from this, that the combustion must proceed almost entirely by air supplied on the surface. Indeed, when properly applied, the supply of air through the ash-pit is almost reduced to nothing ; and accordingly the fire can be kept in good condition, even though the ash-pit is closed in front.</p><p>In addition to the consumption of smoke, the application of steam in this way is attended with another advantage ; the saving of fuel, which is certainly a great recommendation in its favour. Different statements have been given of the amount of saving effected ; but if we can place reliance in the reports given by the patentee, it seems to be considcrable.</p><p>Watt, from his numerous experiments, concluded, that for each pound of coal (English caking) consumed, rather more than eight pounds of water could be evaporated, thus requiring about eight pounds of coal for the cubic foot of water. Since his time, however, improvements in the construction of furnaces have been introduced, which have increased the amount of evaporation.</p><p>Mr. Watt’s maximum result with Wallsend caking coal, conducted with the greatest care, was 8.9 pound of water to the pound of coal. The lowest was 5.93, the mean 7.4.</p><p>Mr. Parkes of Warwick states the ordinary result with one pound of caking coal to be 7.5 pounds, evaporated from 212°, but by his improved method in the furnaces of other persons, it was 8.7, while by a similar mode with his own furnace, it was 10.32 pounds.</p><p>With one of the Cornish boilers, coated and covered with the greatest care, and in all other respects rendered as perfect as possible, the result was 11.8 pounds, and a similar result was more recently obtained by Henwood.</p><p>The following is a tabular view of the results of Watt and others, shewing the quantity of water evaporated, and the quantity of fuel required for the horse-power of an engine:</p><table><row><cell>EXPERIMENTS.</cell><cell><p>-</p><p>lbs. water to 1 lb. of English coal.</p></cell><cell>lbβ.

The experiments were conducted with Scotish coal ; and considering the heat given out by it, as compared to English caking coal, to be as three to four, the results will shew the amount of evaporation, or, which is the same thing, the quantity of fuel, used in comparison with what is given in the preceding table.</p><table><row><cell>EXPERIMENTS.</cell><cell><p>lbs. water to</p><p>1 lb. of <hi rend="italic">Scοtish </hi>coal.</p></cell><cell><p>lbs. water to</p><p>1 lb. of English coal.</p></cell><cell>lbs.
