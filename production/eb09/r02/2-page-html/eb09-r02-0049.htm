<p><span class="font0">RETZ, Jean François Paul de Gondi, Cardinal de (1614-1679), was born at Montmirail in 1614. The&nbsp;family was one of those which had been introduced into&nbsp;France by Catherine de’ Medici, but it had acquired great&nbsp;estates in Brittany and had been connected with the&nbsp;noblest houses of the kingdom. It may be added that&nbsp;Retz himself always spelt his designation “Rais,” and the&nbsp;spelling is not inconvenient for foreigners. He was the&nbsp;third son, and according to Tallemant des Réaux was&nbsp;made a knight of Malta on the very day of his birth.&nbsp;The death of his second brother, however, destined him&nbsp;for a closer connexion with the church. The family of&nbsp;Retz had military traditions, for the cardinal’s father,&nbsp;Philippe Emmanuel, was general of the galleys, and his&nbsp;grandfather Albert was marshal of France. But it had also&nbsp;much church influence, Retz’s uncle being archbishop of&nbsp;Paris, and, despite the very unclerical leanings of the future&nbsp;cardinal, which were not corrected by the teachings of St&nbsp;Vincent de Paul, who was his tutor, the intentions of his&nbsp;family never varied respecting him. It was in vain that,&nbsp;as he has recounted with some vanity in his famous&nbsp;memoirs, he flirted, fought duels, and endeavoured in&nbsp;every way to show that he had no vocation. His friends&nbsp;might have some excuse for doubting his aptitude for a&nbsp;more active career despite his vivacious temperament, for&nbsp;by unanimous consent his physical appearance was not&nbsp;that of a soldier. He was short, near-sighted, ugly&nbsp;(though his ugliness had much in common with that of&nbsp;Wilkes), and exceptionally awkward of hand and gesture.&nbsp;Retz, however, despite the little inclination which he felt&nbsp;towards clerical life, was not a man to leave any kind of&nbsp;career to which he had access untried. He entered into&nbsp;the disputes of· the Sorbonne with vigour, and when he&nbsp;was scarcely eighteen wrote the remarkable </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Conjuration de&nbsp;Eiesque,</span><span class="font0"> a little historical essay of which he drew the&nbsp;material from the Italian of Mascardi, but which is all his&nbsp;own in the negligent vigour of the style and the audacious&nbsp;insinuation, if nothing more, of revolutionary principles.&nbsp;It is said, though the anecdotes of this time are always&nbsp;suspicious, that Richelieu’s verdict after reading the&nbsp;pamphlet was “ voilà un homme dangereux.” However&nbsp;this may be, Retz received no preferment of importance&nbsp;during Richelieu’s life, and even after the minister’s death,&nbsp;though he was presented to Louis XIII. and well received&nbsp;(the king offered him a bishopric), he found a difficulty in&nbsp;attaining the object of his wishes, that is to say, the&nbsp;coadjutorship with reversion of the archbishopric of Paris.&nbsp;But almost immediately after the king’s death Anne of&nbsp;Austria appointed him to the coveted post on All Saints’&nbsp;Eve, 1643. Retz, who had according to some accounts&nbsp;already plotted against Richelieu, set himself to work to&nbsp;make the utmost political capital out of his position. His&nbsp;uncle, who was old, indolent, and absurdly proud, had&nbsp;lived in great seclusion ; Retz, on the contrary, by&nbsp;assiduously cultivating the parish </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">cures</span><span class="font0"> and distributing&nbsp;large sums in alms, gradually acquired a very great influence with the populace of the city. This influence he&nbsp;gradually turned against Mazarin—partly from the general&nbsp;dislike which the French nobles had to that low-born&nbsp;adventurer, but partly also, it would appear, because he&nbsp;himself was not in Mazarin’s place. No one had more to&nbsp;do than Retz with the outbreak of the Fronde in October&nbsp;1648, and his history for the next four years is the history&nbsp;of that confused and, as a rule, much misunderstood&nbsp;movement. Of the two parties who, sometimes in union&nbsp;and sometimes at variance with each other, opposed the&nbsp;system of absolute monarchy carried on by an omnipotent&nbsp;minister, Retz could only depend on the bourgeoisie, not&nbsp;on the nobles, and even in the case of the bourgeoisie&nbsp;he had little influence out of Paris. The fact, moreover, that although he had some speculative tendencies&nbsp;in favour of popular liberties, and even perhaps of republicanism, he represented no real political principle, as&nbsp;the parliament of Paris did and as did great nobles like&nbsp;La Rochefoucauld, inevitably weakened his position. His&nbsp;adroitness of intrigue and his boldness in action (which&nbsp;was even shown on the field of battle) served him little in&nbsp;the long run, and when the break up of the Fronde came&nbsp;he was left in the lurch, having more than once in the&nbsp;meanwhile been in no small danger from his own party.&nbsp;One stroke of luck, however, fell to him before his downfall. He was made cardinal almost by accident, and under&nbsp;a misapprehension on the pope’s part. Then, in 1652, he&nbsp;was arrested and imprisoned, first at Vincenues, then at&nbsp;Nantes ; he escaped, however, after two years’ captivity,&nbsp;and for some time wandered about in England and elsewhere. He made his appearance at Rome more than&nbsp;once, and had no small influence in the election of&nbsp;Alexander VII. He was at last, in 1662, received back&nbsp;again into favour by Louis XIV. and on more than one&nbsp;occasion formally served as envoy to Rome,—commissions&nbsp;which have left abundant records in the shape of official&nbsp;documents. Retz, however, was too shrewd, and perhaps&nbsp;too weary of political intrigue to attempt any interference&nbsp;with the new order of things at home, and he was glad in&nbsp;making his peace to resign his claims to the archbishopric&nbsp;of Paris. The terms were, among other things, his&nbsp;appointment to the rich abbacy of St Denis and his&nbsp;restoration to his other benefices with the payment of&nbsp;arrears.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The last seventeen years of Retz’s life were comparatively quiet, and were passed partly in his diplomatic duties (he was again in Rome at the papal election of&nbsp;1668), partly at Paris, partly at his estate of Commercy,&nbsp;but latterly at St Mihiel in Lorraine. His retirement&nbsp;to this place was made under circumstances which were&nbsp;unusual for the age. His debts were as enormous as his&nbsp;revenues were large, and, as the latter were almost entirely&nbsp;derived from ecclesiastical appointments, his creditors had&nbsp;no remedy. In 1675 he resolved to make over to them all&nbsp;his income except twenty thousand livres, and, as he said,&nbsp;to “ live for his creditors.” This plan he carried out,&nbsp;though he did not succeed in living very long, for he died&nbsp;at Paris on the 24th August 1679. One of the chief&nbsp;authorities for the last years of Retz is Madame de Sévigné,&nbsp;whose connexion he was by marriage. Great friendship&nbsp;existed between them, and the cardinal was especially&nbsp;devoted to Madame de Grignan, who seems to have treated&nbsp;him with her usual selfish indifference.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Retz and La Rochefoucauld, the greatest of the Frondeurs in literary genius, were personal and political enemies,&nbsp;and each has left a portrait of the other. La Rochefoucauld’s character of the cardinal is on the whole harsh but&nbsp;scarcely unjust, and one of its sentences formulates,&nbsp;though in a manner which has a certain recoil upon the&nbsp;writer, the great defect of Retz’s conduct,—“ Il a suscité&nbsp;les plus grands désordres dans l’état sans avoir un dessein&nbsp;formé de s’en prévaloir. ” The last two words indicate&nbsp;but too clearly the self-seeking which was the bane of the&nbsp;Fronde and of the French noblesse generally. But it is&nbsp;perfectly true that no general design of benefiting either&nbsp;himself or his country, or even any party or order in his&nbsp;country, can be traced in Retz’s conduct, and that he&nbsp;seems to have kindled the fires of civil war in pure gaiety&nbsp;of heart. He would have been less, and certainly less&nbsp;favourably, remembered if it had not been for his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Memoirs,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">which, with Madame de Sévigné’s notices, give a rather&nbsp;high idea of the amiability of his character at the same&nbsp;time that they confirm its levity, and above all prove his&nbsp;possession of remarkable literary faculty. They were</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
