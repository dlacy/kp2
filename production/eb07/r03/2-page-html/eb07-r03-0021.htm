<p><span class="font1">RUNCIMAN, Alexander, an eminent Scottish painter, was born in Edinburgh in the year 1736. He was the son&nbsp;of an architect, a profession which has a strong affinity to&nbsp;that of painting. The opportunity he thus enjoyed of examining his father’s drawings gave him an early propensity to the art in general, which he very soon evinced by&nbsp;making sketches of any remarkable object, either of nature&nbsp;or art, that happened to come in his way. We are unacquainted with the gradual progress of his fertile genius; but&nbsp;it is not to be supposed that he remained long satisfied with&nbsp;the delineations of straight lines, whilst the fascinating beauties of landscape lay open to his inspection. Water that&nbsp;falls over a rugged precipice in the form of cascades, or&nbsp;the foaming surges of the deep when carried like hoar frost&nbsp;with impetuosity into the air, both astonish and delight by&nbsp;their awful grandeur. These objects, and such as these,&nbsp;would naturally fire, at an early period, the genius of Runciman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">He was bound an apprentice to John and Robert Norry in the year 1750, the former of whom was a landscape-painter of very considerable eminence, and by his instructions our young artist made rapid progress. About the year&nbsp;1755, when only nineteen years of age, he began professionally to paint landscapes; from which it appeared that&nbsp;they were by no means first attempts, as they evinced his&nbsp;ardent application to study before he ventured to appear at&nbsp;the tribunal of the public. Yet although these were excellent, they were nothing more than the dawn of that distinguished eminence to which he afterwards attained. His&nbsp;reputation as a painter of landscape continued to increase&nbsp;during five years ; but such was the strength of his genius,&nbsp;and the amazing fertility of his invention, that he could not&nbsp;rest satisfied with eminence in a single department. About&nbsp;the year 1760 he successfully attempted historical painting, in which his mind had more ample scope than in pour-traying the solemn silence of a field, a humble cottage, or&nbsp;a shepherd void of ambition. Six years of his life were devoted to the study and practice of this important branch&nbsp;of the art, notwithstanding his situation was attended with&nbsp;numerous disadvantages. Great, however, as his attainments were in this department, he could never be satisfied&nbsp;with himself till he had studied in Italy those masterly&nbsp;performances which it was his highest ambition to imitate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">He accordingly set out for Italy in the year 1766, when just thirty years of age; and during a residence of five&nbsp;years in that enchanting country, where specimens of his&nbsp;favourite art are met with in all their grandeur and perfection, he continued to copy the best pictures of the ancient masters, in consequence of which his taste was very&nbsp;much corrected and improved. His conceptions were also&nbsp;greatly enlarged by the steady contemplation of so many&nbsp;works of the greatest and most celebrated artists. The&nbsp;art of composition, which it is of the first consequence for&nbsp;an historical painter to understand, was only to be acquired&nbsp;from the study of its principles, as they are exemplified in&nbsp;such highly-finished models ; and to these he applied himself with indefatigable industry. He caught the rich yet&nbsp;chaste colouring of the Venetian school with such truth that&nbsp;he was allowed to surpass all his competitors in this valuable&nbsp;quality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the year 1771, Runciman returned to his native  country in the full possession of such improvements as were&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">to </span><span class="font1">be expected from the opportunities he had enjoyed, and&nbsp;also with a judgment very much matured. It will readily be&nbsp;granted that he had now some claim upon the patronage of</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1">his country, and we are happy to add that this was not withheld ; for the Board of Trustees, and Sir James Clerk&nbsp;of Pennycuick, were amongst his patrons; and to Mr Robert&nbsp;Alexander in particular, a respectable merchant in Edinburgh, his country was more indebted for fostering his rising genius than to the whole of its nobility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">An academy for the study of drawing and painting was established in Edinburgh by the honourable trustees for&nbsp;the encouragement of the arts in Scotland, of which De la&nbsp;Cour and Pavilon, two French artists of some ability, were&nbsp;successively chosen masters. When Pavilon died in 1771,&nbsp;an application was made to Runciman to take charge of&nbsp;the academy, the laborious and interesting duties of which&nbsp;he discharged much to his own honour and the benefit of&nbsp;his country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">His masterly work in the hall of Ossian at Pennycuick, the seat of his patron Sir James Clerk, was projected and&nbsp;begun by him soon after his return to Edinburgh. The next&nbsp;performance of Runciman was the picture of the Ascension,&nbsp;painted on the ceiling above the altar of the episcopal chapel,&nbsp;Cowgate, Edinburgh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The fire and the feeling displayed in his King Lear were conceived and executed in a manner not inferior to those of&nbsp;Shakspeare; and the Andromeda, from which Legat took&nbsp;his highly-finished engraving, will bear a comparison, in&nbsp;colouring, with the works of Titian or Correggio. He appears to have regarded his own historical work of Agrippina landing the ashes of Germanicus her husband, as a&nbsp;capital performance, in the execution of which he had bestowed more than ordinary pains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Whilst his health permitted, which the painting of the hall of Ossian had much impaired, he continued to superintend&nbsp;the business of the academy, and devoted his leisure hours&nbsp;to the drawing of historical pieces. He enjoyed a competency from his office as teacher, which, with the emoluments arising from his other works, made him independent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Runciman as a man was possessed of great candour and simplicity of manners, having a happy talent for conversation, which made some of the most distinguished literary&nbsp;characters, such as Hume, Robertson, Kames, and Monboddo, extremely fond of his company; but his genuine&nbsp;worth, and his real goodness of heart, were only fully known&nbsp;to his most intimate friends. He could communicate information with great facility, and gave his best advice to&nbsp;young artists, with a view to facilitate the progress of their&nbsp;improvement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As a painter, his character has been elegantly drawn by a brother artist, Mr John Brown, who was better qualified&nbsp;than most men to make a proper estimate of his merits.&nbsp;“ Mr Runciman was an artist by nature, eminently qualified to excel in all those nobler parts of the art, the attainment of which depends upon the possession of the highest&nbsp;powers of the mind. Though for a long period of years&nbsp;labouring under every possible disadvantage, he completed&nbsp;works which, upon the whole, are equal to the best of those&nbsp;of his contemporaries, and in some respects it may be boldly asserted that they are superior. His fancy was fertile,&nbsp;his discernment of character keen, his taste truly elegant,&nbsp;and his conceptions always great. Though his genius seems&nbsp;to be best suited to the grand and serious, yet many of&nbsp;his works amply prove that he could move with equal success in the less elevated line of the gay and pleasing. His&nbsp;chief excellence was composition, the noblest part of the&nbsp;art, in which it is doubted whether he had any living superior. With regard to the truth, the harmony, the richness,&nbsp;and the gravity of colouring; in that style, in short, which&nbsp;is the peculiar characteristic of the ancient Venetian, and&nbsp;the direct contrast to the modern English school, he was&nbsp;unrivalled. His works, it must be granted, like all those&nbsp;of the present times, were far from being perfect; but it&nbsp;was Mr Runciman’s peculiar misfortune, that his defects</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
