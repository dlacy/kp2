The lakes of Sardinia are insignificant ; they are mostly formed by rain in winter, and are dried up in summer ; or by the overflowing of the sea from the dilapidated state of the embankments.</p><p>Mineral springs are numerous on the island, but are for the most part neglected. The principal are those of Sar- dara, Villa Cidro, and Fordongianus, in the Capo de Sotto ; and those at the foot of Castel Doria, at Codrongianus, and the Benetutti springs of the Goceana Mountains, on the Capo di Sopra. In a secondary rank may be noticed the thermal waters of Marrubin, of Iglesias, and of St Antonio. Aqua Cotta, at the eastern base of an insulated hillock near Villa Cidro, is a small but constantly limpid spring, of about 105° of Fahrenheit, close by a stream of potable water having a temperature of 60°, whilst that of the atmosphere is 64°. Here most of the cloth of the Campe- dano is fulled, the makers of it paying to the proprietor for the use of the water.</p><p>The climate of this kingdom varies excessively in the different provinces which compose it. In Savoy, in the valley of Aosta, and between the Alps of Piedmont, a real Swiss climate prevails. Often is to be seen in those valleys the summer in its glorious garb, when the surrounding hills have their tops and sides covered with snow. The air on them is too raw to bring forth the more tender fruits of Italy ; but in favoured spots the grapes ripen, and the sides of the hills yield abundance of chestnuts. Though changeable, the air in these districts is on the whole pure and healthful. The valley of Piedmont, according to Saussure’s division, has the climate of the north region of Italy, where the quicksilver falls below ten degrees. Even in the midst of summer the benumbing Tramonta winds descend from the heights, and night-frosts, which begin in November, continue till April. It is not unusual, in the neighbourhood of the mountains, to see the ground covered with snow during ten or twelve days. It is, however, not subject to the inconveniences of Southern Italy ; and neither the burning atmosphere of Calabria, nor the Sirocco, nor earthquakes, are experienced, nor the annoyance of the sharp-biting musquito. The mulberry trees, the vines, and the maize, flourish ; and the air, when not in the vicinity of rice-fields, has a balmy fragrance, and is remarkably pure and healthful. The coasts of the kingdom, from Nice to Genoa, are protected by the Apennines from the Tramonta winds, and the climate is that distinguished by Saussure as the second region of Italy, in which the olives and the agrumens attain perfection ; but the evils of the Sirocco or Mistrol winds are too often felt in the whole of the district.</p><p>The island of Sardinia has some peculiarities of climate. In times of antiquity, the unhealthiness of the island is alluded to by Martial, Cicero, Pausanias, Cornelius Nepos, Strabo, Tacitus, and Claudian ; and in later times the same character is given it by Dante. The chief agent of this insalubrity is found in the feculent miasma of marshes, beds of rivers and torrents, stagnant pools, and putrescent vegetation, in the vicinity of which it is always found deleteriously active, and which are well known to be quite adequate to the generation of malignant fevers. The common disease, called here <hi rend="italic">intemperie,</hi> appears to be somewhat different from the <hi rend="italic">malaria</hi> of Sicily and Italy ; for although equally or more acrimonious in effect, it does not produce the swelled bodies and sallow skins which are the pathognomonic symptoms of the latter. Both diseases usually commence when the summer heat, assisted by slight showers, disengages the impure gases from the low grounds ; and continue till the end of No</p><p>vember, when the heavy rains have precipitated the miasma, and purified the air. But they differ, in as much as malaria is generally supposed to be weak in its effects, unless imbibed during sleep ; whereas <hi rend="italic">intemperie,</hi> though worst at night, is dangerous at all times. Instances have been known of strangers landing for a few hours only, from Italian coasters, who were almost immediately carried off by its virulence ; indeed the very breathing of the air by a foreigner at night, or in the cool of the evening, is considered as certain a death in some parts, as if he had swallowed some poisonous drug. While the atmosphere is in this state, the natives never move abroad until an hour after sunrise, and they hasten home before sunset, carefully closing every door and window, or, if obliged to go out, carefully holding a handkerchief before the mouth. The extreme heat of the day is also carefully avoided, for they are apprehensive of the <hi rend="italic">colpo di sole,</hi> or stroke of the sun, attributing its frequency and fatal effects to the malignancy of the <hi rend="italic">intemperie.</hi></p><p>It is agreed on all sides that fire is an excellent antidote to this evil ; and it is recorded that the Lords of Oristano were wont, during the unhealthy season, to burn large fires around the town every night, to rarefy the mephitic exhalations. Most of the people remove from the plains to the higher grounds on St John’s day in June, when the air begins to be unsafe, although it does not become dangerous before August. Those who, from their circumstances, are obliged to remain, keep themselves well clad in thick woollens, to avert the ardent rays of the sun. Exertion, exposure to summer showers, and fatigue of every kind, are studiously avoided ; and a spare but good diet is adopted, with cool acidulated drinks. The migrations consequent on this distressing visitation, with the want of cottages, pastures, and enclosures, and the many extensive commons, give the plains of Sardinia a depopulated aspect, and may be adduced, among other causes, as a reason for the comparatively low consideration in which this once most fertile of the Tyrrhenian islands has been held. The contempt in which the inhabitants of the plains are held by those of the mountains, with the large fiefs in the hands of some of the nonresident nobles, are also serious obstacles to improvement.</p><p>The chief occupation of the inhabitants of this kingdom consists in the cultivation of the land, and is accordingly as varied as the surface of the soil, and as that of the climate, which depends on the elevation. Under the head of <hi rend="smallcaps">Lombardy</hi> will be found a detailed account of the agriculture of this district, the greater part of which may be adverted to as a description of what takes place in the richer portion of Sardinia, which belongs to the basin of the river Po, comprehending the greater part of the provinces of Turin, Cuneo, and Alessandria. In Savoy generally the cultivation is badly conducted. The cultivable land is divided into large portions, belonging to a few great proprietors, and is subdivided into smaller portions to tenants, who, without leases, transmit their lots from one generation to another, who pay neither money-rent nor labour to their superiors, but deliver to them or their agents one half the produce of the fields, whatever it may be, in its several kinds. The cattle on these lands are commonly the property of the lord, and are maintained on the produce of the soil, before the division is made of what it yields. The power of the tenants to transmit the land to their successors is combined with the power of subdividing it among their several children ; and this is carried to such an extent, as in Ireland and in some other countries, that it has led, and is leading, to such a subdivision that a great number of the farms barely raise sufficient food for the occupants, though their provisions are of the most humble and penurious kind. Savoy is annually deficient in corn to the extent of nearly one third of its consumption. This is in some measure made up by using chestnuts and potatoes as substitutes for bread ; though in Aosta and in some other</p></body></text></TEI>
