                in the provinces. On the attic the gods of the Danube&nbsp;provinces appear to the
                left, the submission of Mesopotamia on&nbsp;the right; the lowest panels represent
                negotiations with Germans (left) and Parthians (right); in the centre (as on
                the&nbsp;other face) wc have a military scene (recruiting in the provinces)&nbsp;to
                left, balancing the foundation of colonies and growth of the&nbsp;</span><span
                class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">proles Romana</span><span class="font0"> on
                the right. As the above description will&nbsp;show, this arch is, in respect of its
                significance, the most important monument of Roman historical art.
                Technically,&nbsp;the reliefs fall somewhat short of the best work of the
                Flavian&nbsp;period—the long panels of the archway, which represent a&nbsp;sacrifice
                offered by Trajan and his benefactions to the </span><span class="font0"
                style="font-style:italic;">municipia&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">of Italy, have
                not the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">verve</span><span
                class="font0"> of those from the Arch of Titus,&nbsp;but are at least as fine as the
                works executed for Trajan’s&nbsp;Forum.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">With the accession of Hadrian—the “ Greekling,” as he was called by
                his contemporaries—a short-lived renaissance of&nbsp;classicism set in. The eclectic
                modifications of Greek statuary&nbsp;types which it called forth do not fall within
                our province; but&nbsp;it should be noticed that in portraiture the most
                important&nbsp;work of this period was the idealized type of Antinous,
                here&nbsp;represented by a famous example (Plate I. fig. 6) in the&nbsp;Louvre,
                which invests the favourite of Hadrian with a divinity&nbsp;expressed in the terms
                of Hellenic art as well as a pathos which&nbsp;belongs to his own
                    time.@@<sup>1</sup> The historical monuments of this&nbsp;and the following
                reign are few in number, and lack the pregnancy of meaning and vigour of execution
                which distinguish&nbsp;those of the Trajanic period; mention may be made of
                three&nbsp;reliefs in the Palazzo dei Conservatori, one of which represents&nbsp;the
                apotheosis of an empress, and of the panels in the Palazzo&nbsp;Rondinini shown by
                the analogy of a medallion of Antoninus&nbsp;Pius to belong to his time. .This is
                also the place to take note&nbsp;of the ideal figures symbolical of the subject
                peoples of the&nbsp;Empire. Under Trajan Roman sculptors had produced the
                fine&nbsp;statues of Dacian captives which now adorn the Arch of Constantine; to the
                Hadrianic period belong the idealized figures&nbsp;of provinces, classical in pose
                and motive, several of which are&nbsp;in the Palazzo de
                Conservatori.@@<sup>2</sup></span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">We pass on to the period of Marcus Aurelius and Commodus, in which
                Roman art underwent a further transformation. The&nbsp;earliest monument of the time
                which calls for our attention&nbsp;is the base of the column (now destroyed) erected
                in honour of&nbsp;Antoninus Pius. Two of its faces are here shown (Plate
                IV.&nbsp;figs. 2i and 22), and the contrast is remarkable between
                the&nbsp;classicistic representation of the apotheosis of Antoninus
                and&nbsp;Faustina, witnessed by the ideal figures of Rome and the
                Campus&nbsp;Martius (holding an obelisk), and the realistic treatment of
                the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">decursio,</span><span
                class="font0"> a ceremony performed by detachments of the praetorian guard on horse
                and foot. We note the endeavour of the&nbsp;Roman sculptor to express more than his
                medium will allow,&nbsp;and his inadequate grasp of the laws of proportion and
                perspective. Discarding the classical standard and its conventions, the artist
                disposes his figures like a child’s toys, and,&nbsp;when confronted with the problem
                of the background, waves&nbsp;it aside and reduces the indication of the place of
                action to a&nbsp;few projecting ledges on which his puppets are supported.
                The&nbsp;reliefs of the Column of Marcus Aurelius suffer by comparison&nbsp;with
                those of Trajan’s Column. The story which the designer&nbsp;had to tell was
                doubtless less definite in outline; we cannot&nbsp;trace, as in the former instance,
                the march of events towards a&nbsp;dramatic climax, and there is some reason to
                think that, although&nbsp;the two bands of relief, separated (as on Trajan’s Column)
                by&nbsp;a figure of Victory, correspond generally with the “ Germanic ”&nbsp;and “
                Sarmatic ” wars of Marcus down to </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font0"> 175, the
                narrative&nbsp;is not strictly chronological; thus the fall of rain ascribed
                by&nbsp;Christian tradition to the prayers of the “ Thundering ” Legion&nbsp;(Plate
                IV. fig. 24) is represented at a very early stage, whereas&nbsp;our historians place
                it towards the close of the war. The&nbsp;figures arc smaller and at the same time
                more crowded than&nbsp;those upon Trajan’s Column, and the landscape </span><span
                class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font0">less
                intelligently rendered. The type of the rain-god, which is without&nbsp;doubt the
                creation of the Roman sculptor, is boldly conceived&nbsp;but scarcely artistic.
                Still the reliefs show that the designers&nbsp;of the time were making vigorous
                efforts to think for themselves, and for this reason possess a higher value than the
                more&nbsp;conventional panels now distributed between the attic of the&nbsp;Arch of
                Constantine and the Palazzo dei Conscrvatori, which&nbsp;seem to have decorated a
                triumphal arch set up in or after&nbsp;</span><span class="font1"
                style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font0"> 176.@@3 The
                portraiture of the time also shows the invasion of&nbsp;new principles. Even before
                the reign of Marcus we find a&nbsp;tendency to emphasize the contrast between hair
                and flesh,&nbsp;the face often showing signs of high polish. In the latter
                half&nbsp;of the 2nd century the contrast is heightened by a new method&nbsp;of
                treating the hair, which is rendered as a mass of curls deeply&nbsp;undercut and
                honeycombed with drill-holes; a fine example is&nbsp;the Commodus of the Palazzo dei
                Conservatori. The aim of&nbsp;the sculptor is to obtain an ornamental effect by the
                violent&nbsp;contrast of light and dark—an adaptation for the purposes
                of&nbsp;plastic art of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;"
                >chiaroscuro</span><span class="font0"> which more properly belongs
                to&nbsp;painting. This tendency may be seen at work in all branches&nbsp;of
                sculpture. The sarcophagi of the Antonine and later periods,&nbsp;with their crowded
                compositions and deep shadows, have the&nbsp;same pictorial effect; and in pure
                ornament the vivid Ulusionism&nbsp;of Flavian art disappears, and, though
                plant-forms are lavishly&nbsp;used—from the time of Trajan onwards we note a
                growing&nbsp;distaste for pure outlines, which are hidden beneath all-pervading
                acanthus foliage—</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">the interest of the sculptor</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">comes to lie more and more</span></p>

        <p><span class="font0">ened, whereas the reverse</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">is actually the case, for</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">even the figures on sarco</span></p>

        <p><span class="font0">ments in a pattern. The</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">reason is that pure darkness is set off against the high lights, and
                the whole surface being thus broken up, there&nbsp;remains no impression of
                depth.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">Under Septimius Scvcrus and his successors, Roman art drifts steadily
                in its new direction. The reliefs of his arch at&nbsp;the entrance to the Forum
                represent the emperor’s campaigns&nbsp;in the East in a compromise between
                bird’s-eye perspective&nbsp;and the “ continuous ” style which cannot be called
