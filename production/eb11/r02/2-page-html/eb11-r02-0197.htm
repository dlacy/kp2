<p><span class="font1">to the judge.” The true aim should be to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">prove</span><span class="font1"> your point, or seem to prove it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Here we may interpolate a comment which has a general bearing on Aristotle’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rhetoric.</span><span class="font1"> It is quite true that, if we start from the&nbsp;conception of rhetoric as a branch of logic, the phantom of logic&nbsp;in rhetoric claims precedence over appeals to passion. But Aristotle&nbsp;does not sufficiently regard, the question—What, as a matter of&nbsp;experience, is most persuasive? Logic may be more persuasive&nbsp;with the more select hearers of rhetoric; but rhetoric is for the&nbsp;many, and with the many appeals to passion will sometimes,&nbsp;perhaps usually, be more effective than syllogism. No formulation&nbsp;of rhetoric can correspond with fact which does not leave it absolutely to the genius of the speaker whether reasoning (or its phantom)&nbsp;is to be what Aristotle calls it, the </span><span class="font0">“</span><span class="font1"> body of proof ” (σώμα&nbsp;πίστίωΐ), or whether the stress of persuading effort should not be&nbsp;rather addressed to the emotions of the hearers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But we can entirely agree with Aristotle in his next remark, which is historical in its nature. The deliberative branch of&nbsp;rhetoric had hitherto been postponed, he observes, to the forensic.&nbsp;We have, in fact, already seen that the very origin of rhetoric&nbsp;in Hellas was forensic. The relative subordination of deliberative&nbsp;rhetoric, however unscientific, had thus been human. Aristotle’s&nbsp;next statement, that the master of logic will be the master of&nbsp;rhetoric, is a truism if we concede the essential primacy of thc&nbsp;logical element in rhetoric. Otherwise it is a paradox; and&nbsp;it is not in accord with experience, which teaches that speakers&nbsp;incapable of showing even the ghost of an argument have&nbsp;sometimes been the most completely successful in carrying&nbsp;great audiences along with them. Aristotle never assumes that&nbsp;the hearers of his rhetorician are as ot </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">χαρΙεντε$,</span><span class="font0"> the cultivated few; on the other hand, he is apt to assume tacitly—and&nbsp;here his individual bent comes out—that these hearers are not&nbsp;the great surging crowd, the όχλον, but a body of persons with&nbsp;a decided, though imperfectly developed, preference for sound&nbsp;logic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">What is the use of an art of rhetoric? ’ It is fourfold, Aristotle replies. Rhetoric is useful, first of all, because truth and justice&nbsp;are naturally stronger than their opposites. When&nbsp;awards are not duly given, truth and justice must have&nbsp;been worsted by their own fault. This is worth correcting, Rhetoric is then (i) </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">corrective.</span><span class="font0"> Next, it is (2) </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">instructive,</span><span class="font0"> as&nbsp;a popular vehicle of persuasion for persons who could not be&nbsp;reached by the severer methods of strict logic. Then it is</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(2) </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">suggestive.</span><span class="font0"> Logic and rhetoric are the two impartial arts;&nbsp;that is to say, it is a matter of indifference to them, as arts,&nbsp;whether the conclusion which they draw in any given case is&nbsp;affirmative or negative. Suppose that I am going to plead a&nbsp;cause, and have a sincere conviction that I am on the right side.&nbsp;The art of rhetoric will suggest to me what might be urged on&nbsp;the other side; and this will give me a stronger grasp of the&nbsp;whole situation. Lastly, rhetoric is (4) </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">defensive.</span><span class="font0"> Mental&nbsp;effort is more distinctive of man than bodily effort; and “it&nbsp;would be absurd that, while incapacity for physical self-defence&nbsp;is , a reproach, incapacity for mental defence should be no&nbsp;reproach.” Rhetoric, then, is corrective, instructive, suggestive, defensive. But what if it be urged that this art&nbsp;may be abused? The objection, Aristotle answers, applies&nbsp;to all good things, except virtue, and especially to the&nbsp;most useful things. Men'may abuse strength, health, wealth,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">generalship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The function of the medical art is not necessarily to cure, but to make such progress towards a cure as each case may&nbsp;admit. Similarly it would be inaccurate to say that&nbsp;the function of rhetoric was to persuade. Rather&nbsp;must rhetoric be defined as “ the faculty of discerning&nbsp;in every case the available means of persuasion.” Suppose&nbsp;that among these means of persuasion is some process of&nbsp;reasoning which the rhetorician himself knows to be unsound. That belongs to the province of rhetoric all the&nbsp;same. In relation to logic, a man is callcd a “ sophist ”&nbsp;with regard to his moral purpose (Trpoatpeats), </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font0"> if he&nbsp;knowingly used a fallacious syllogism. But rhetoric takes&nbsp;no account of the moral purpose. It takes account simply&nbsp;of the faculty (δύτα/xts)—the faculty of discovering any means</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">qf persuasion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Aristotle’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rhetoric</span><span class="font1"> is incomparably the most scientific work which exists on the subject. It may also be regarded as having&nbsp;determined the main lines on which the subject was&nbsp;treated by nearly all subsequent writers. The extant&nbsp;treatise on rhetoric (also by Aristotle?) entitled </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">'Fnrcpuih&nbsp;vp6s</span><span class="font1"> Άλίξα»*δρορ, formerly ascribed to Anaximenes of&nbsp;Lampsacus, was written at latest by 340 d.C. The&nbsp;introductory letter prefixed to it is probably a late forgery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Its relation towards Aristotle’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rhetoric</span><span class="font1"> is discussed in the article on Aristotle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">During the three centuries from thc age of Alexander to that of Augustus the fortunes of rhetoric were governed by&nbsp;the new conditions of Hellenism. Aristotle’s scientific&nbsp;method lived on in the Peripatetic school. Meanwhile&nbsp;thc fashion of florid declamation or strained conceits&nbsp;prevailed in the rhetorical schools of Asia, where, amid&nbsp;mixed populations, the pure traditions of the best&nbsp;Greek taste had been dissociated from the use of the&nbsp;Greek language. The “ Asianism ” of style which thus came&nbsp;to be constrasted with “ Atticism ” found imitators at Rome,&nbsp;among whom must be reckoned the orator Hortensius&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(c.</span><span class="font0"> 95 b.c.). Hermagorasof Temnos in Aeolis (c. 110&nbsp;b.c.) claims mention as having done much to revive&nbsp;a higher conception. Using both the practical rhetoric&nbsp;of the time before Aristotle and Aristotle’s philosophical rhetoric,&nbsp;he worked up the results of both in a new system,—following the&nbsp;philosophers so far as to give the chief prominence to “ invention.” He thus became the founder of a rhetoric which may&nbsp;be distinguished as the scholastic. Through the influence of&nbsp;his school, Hermagoras did for Roman eloquence very much&nbsp;what Isocrates had done for Athens. Above all, he counteracted the view of “ Asianism,” that oratory is a mere knack&nbsp;founded on practice, and recalled attention to the study of it&nbsp;as an art.@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Cicero’s rhetorical works are to some extent based on the technical system to which he had been introduced by Molon at&nbsp;Rhodes. But Cicero further made an independent&nbsp;use of the best among the earlier Greek writers,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Isocrates, Aristotle and Theophrastus. Lastly, he could draw, at least in the later of his treatises, on a vast fund of reflection&nbsp;and experience. Indeed, the distinctive interest of his contributions to the theory of rhetoric consists in the fact that his&nbsp;theory can be compared with his practice. The result of such&nbsp;a comparison is certainly to suggest how much less he owed to&nbsp;his art than to his genius. Some consciousness of this is perhaps,&nbsp;implied in the idea which pervades much of his writing on&nbsp;oratory, that the perfect orator is the perfect man. The same&nbsp;thought is present to Quintilian, in whose great work,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">De Institutione Oratoria,</span><span class="font0"> the scholastic rhetoric receives its most complete expression </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(c. </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d. 90).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Quintilian treats oratory as the end to which the entire mental and moral development of the student is to be directed. Thus&nbsp;he devotes his first book to an early discipline which should&nbsp;precede the orator’s first studies, and his last book to a discipline&nbsp;of the whole man which lies beyond them. Some notion of his&nbsp;comprehensive method may be derived from the circumstance&nbsp;that he introduces a succinct estimate of the chief Greek and&nbsp;Roman authors, of every kind, from Homer to Seneca (bk. x.&nbsp;§§ 46-131). After Quintilian, the next important name is that&nbsp;of Hermogenes of Tarsus, who under Marcus Aurelius&nbsp;made a complete digest of the scholastic rhetoric from&nbsp;the time of Hermagoras of Tcmnos (no B.c.). It is&nbsp;contained in five extant treatises, which are remarkable for&nbsp;clearness and acutenesè, and still more remarkable as having&nbsp;been completed before the age of twenty-five. Hermogenes&nbsp;continued for nearly a century and a half to be one of the chief&nbsp;authorities in the schools. Longinus (c. a.d. 260) published&nbsp;an </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Art of Rhetoric</span><span class="font0"> which is still extant; and the more&nbsp;celebrated treatise </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">On Sublimity (περί υφους),</span><span class="font0"> if not&nbsp;his work, is at least of the same period. In the later&nbsp;half of the 4th century Aphthonius </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.)</span><span class="font0"> composed the&nbsp;“ exercises ” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(προΎνμνάσματα)</span><span class="font0"> which superseded </span><span class="font2">the </span><span class="font0">work of</span></p>
