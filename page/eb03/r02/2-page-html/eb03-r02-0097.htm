<p><span class="font0">make accurate diſeoveries reſpecting </span><span class="font2">an </span><span class="font0">Jſland which was ſuppoſed to lie about 50<sup>w</sup> N. L. and about 300&nbsp;leagues W. of England : but he returned without having ſeen any ſuch iſland as that which he was appointed to ſurvey. In the war which ſoon followed this&nbsp;voyage of diſcovery, he was promoted to the rank of a&nbsp;rear-admiral, and was employed to bombard Havre-de-Grace ; which in 1759 and x 760 he conſiderably damaged, together with ſome ſhipping. In 1761 he was ſent&nbsp;on an expedition againſt Martinico, which was reduced&nbsp;in the beginning of the year 1762, and about the ſame&nbsp;time St Lucia ſurrendered to Captain Harvey. Both&nbsp;theſe iſlands were reſtored to the French at the peace of</span></p><a name="caption1"></a><h4><span class="font1"><sup>i763</sup>∙ <sub>e</sub> . <sub>1</sub> . , In reward for his ſervices, he was created a knight</span></h4>
<p><span class="font0">ς&gt;f the Bath ; but being inattentive, as many ſeamen are, to the rules of economy, his circumſtances became ſo&nbsp;embarraſſed that he was obliged to fly from his country,&nbsp;with very flight hopes of ever being able to return. He&nbsp;was in France when the ill-adviſed policy of that court&nbsp;made them take a decided part with America againſt&nbsp;Great Britain ; and it is ſaid that ſome men in power,&nbsp;no ſtrangers to the deſperate ſtate of Sir George’s affairs, offered him a high command in the French navy,&nbsp;if he would carry arms againſt his own country. This&nbsp;offer he rejected with becoming indignation. Soon after this gallant behaviour, the Duke de Chartres, afterwards the inſamous Orleans, told Sir George that he&nbsp;was to have a command in the fleet which was to be oppoſed to that under the command of his countryman&nbsp;Mr Keppel ; and with an inſulting air aſhed him what&nbsp;he thought would be the conſequence of their meeting ?&nbsp;“ That my countryman will carry your Highneſs with&nbsp;him to learn Engliſh,” was the high-ſpirited reply.—&nbsp;When the diviſions, which the mutual recriminations of&nbsp;Admiral Keppel and Sir Hugh Palliſer excited in the&nbsp;Britiſh navy, made it difficult for the miniſtry to procure experienced, and at the ſame time popular, commanders for their fleets, Lord Sandwich wrote to Sir&nbsp;George Bridges Rodney, offering him a principal command ; but the difficulty was ſor the veteran to find money to pay his accounts in France, ſo that he might be&nbsp;permitted to leave that kingdom- The money, it has&nbsp;been repeatedly affirmed, was advanced to him by the&nbsp;courtiers whoſe offer he had before indignantly rejected.&nbsp;He arrived, therefore, in England, and was again employed in the ſervice of his country. His firſt exploit&nbsp;after his appointment was in January 1780, when he&nbsp;took 19 Spaniſh tranſports bound to Cadiz from Bilboa,&nbsp;together with a 64 gun ſhip and 5 ſrigates, their convoy. Gn the 16th of the ſame month he fell in with&nbsp;the Spaniſh fleet, conſiſting of 11 ſail of the line, under&nbsp;the commmand of Don Juan de Langara ; of which one&nbsp;was blown up during the engagement, five were taken&nbsp;and carried into Gibraltar, among which was the admiral’s ſhip, and the reſt were much ſhattered. In April&nbsp;the ſame year, he fell in with the French fleet, under the&nbsp;command of Admiral Guichen, at Martinico, whom he&nbsp;obliged to fight, and whom he completely beat; though&nbsp;from the ſhattered ſtate of his own fleet, and the un-willingneſs of the enemy to riſk another action, he took&nbsp;none of their ſhips. The ſucceſsful efforts of our gallant&nbsp;admiral during the year 1780 were generally applauded through the nation. He received the thanks of&nbsp;both Houſea of Parliament, and addreſſes of thanks from</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">various parts of Great Britain, and the iſlands to which his victories were more particularly ſerviceable. In December the ſame year, he made an attempt, together&nbsp;with General Vaughan, on St Vincent’s, but failed. In&nbsp;1781, he continued his exertions, with much ſucceſs,&nbsp;in defending the Weſt India iſlands ; and, along with&nbsp;the above named general, he conquered St Euſtatius; on&nbsp;which occaſion his conduct to the inhabitants has been&nbsp;much, though perhaps unjuſtly, cenſured. The iſland&nbsp;was certainly a neſt of contraband traders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On the ί 2th of April 1782, he came to a cloſe action with the French fleet under Count de Graffe; du-ring which he ſunk one ſhip and took five, of which the admiral’s ſhip, the Ville de Paris, was one. The&nbsp;following year brought peace ; but, as a reward for his&nbsp;numerous ſervices, he had a grant of L. 2000 a-year&nbsp;for himſelf and his two ſucceſſors. He had long before&nbsp;been created a baronet, was rear-admiral of Great Britain, and at length was juſtly promoted to the peerape,&nbsp;by the title of Baron Rodney of Stoke, Somerſetſhire,&nbsp;and made vice-admiral of Great Britain, He was once&nbsp;alſo governor of Greenwich Hoſpital.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Lord Rodney had been twice married ; firſt to the ſiſttr of the Earl of Northampton, and ſecondly to the&nbsp;daughter of John dies, Eſq; with whom he did not re-ſide for ſeveral years before his death, which happened&nbsp;on the 24th of May 1792. He was ſucceeded in title&nbsp;and eſtates by his ſon George, who married in 1781&nbsp;Martha, daughter of the Right Hon. Alderman Harley, by whom he has iſſue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Of the private life of Lord Rodney we know but little. His attention to the wants of the ſeamen, and&nbsp;the warrant officers ſerving under him, indicated that&nbsp;humanity which is always allied to true courage. He&nbsp;has often, ſrom the number of diſhes which his rank&nbsp;brought to his table, ſelected ſomething very plain for&nbsp;himſelf, and ſent the reſt to the midſhipmens meſs.—&nbsp;His public tranſactions will tranſmit his name with honour to poſterity ; his bravery was unqueſtionable, and&nbsp;his ſucceſs has been ſeldom equalled. It has, indeed,&nbsp;been very generally ſaid, that his ſkill in naval tactics was&nbsp;not great, and that he was indebted to the ſuperior abilities of Capt. Young and Sir Charles Douglas for the&nbsp;manœuvres by which he was ſo ſucceſsful againſt Lan-gara and De Graſſe. But, ſuppoſing this to be true,&nbsp;it detracts not from his merit. A weak or fooliſh commander could not always make choice of the ableſt officers for his firſt captains, nor would ſuch a man be&nbsp;guided by their advice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Whatever was Lord Rodney’s ſkill in the ſcience of naval war, or however much he may have been beholden&nbsp;to the counſels of others, he certainly poſſeſſed himſelf&nbsp;the diſtinguiſhed merit of indefatigable exertion ; ſor he&nbsp;never omitted any thing within the compaſs of his power&nbsp;to bring the enemy to action. He therefore unqueſtion-ably deſerves the reſpect and the gratitude of his country. In the year 1783 the Houſe of Aſſembly in Ja.&nbsp;maica voted L. 1000 towards erecting a marble ſtatue&nbsp;to him, as a mark of their gratitude and veneration for&nbsp;his gallant ſervices, ſo timely and gloriouſly performed&nbsp;for the ſalvation of that iſland in particular, as well as&nbsp;the whole of the Britiſh Weſt India iſlands and trade&nbsp;in general. We have not, however, heard of any ſuch&nbsp;tribute being paid to him in Britain either before or&nbsp;ſince his death.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
