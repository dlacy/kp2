Bunsen, <hi rend="italic">Ann.,</hi>  1862, 122, p. 351). A somewhat similar process based on the varying solubilities of the corresponding alums has also been devised by Redtenbacher <hi rend="italic">(Jour, prak. Chem.,</hi>  1865, 95, p. 148). The metal is prepared by distilling the carbonate with carbon (an explosive compound similar to that obtained from potassium and carbon monoxide is liable to be formed simultaneously); by reducing the hydroxide with aluminium: 4RbOH+2Al = Rb<hi rend="sub">2</hi>O Al2O3+2Rb+2H<hi rend="sub">2 </hi>(N. Beketoff,<hi rend="italic">Ber.,</hi>  1888, 21, p. 424 ref.); by reducing the carbonate (C. Winckler, <hi rend="italic">Ber.,</hi>  1890, 23, p. 51) or the hydroxide with magnesium (H. Erdmann and P. Kothner, <hi rend="italic">Ann.,</hi>  1899, 294, p. 55); and by heating the fused chloride with calcium in an exhausted glass tube at 400-500° C. (L. Hackspill, <hi rend="italic">Comptes rendus,</hi>  1905, T41, p. 101). The metal was first obtained electrolytically in 19TO by electrolysing the fused hydroxide in a nickel vessel, with an iron wire cathode and iron cylinder anode; the product on cooling being opened under pyridine cooled by a freezing mixture (G. von Hcvesy, <hi rend="italic">Zeit. anorg. Chem.,</hi>  1910, 67, p. 242). It is a silvery white metal which melts at 38*5° C. and has a specific gravity of 1*52. It oxidizes rapidly on exposure to air, and decomposes cold water very rapidly. It closely resembles caesium and potassium in its general properties. The rubidium salts are generally colourless, mostly soluble in water and isomorphous with the corresponding potassium salts.</p><p>Rubidium hydride, RbH, was obtained in the form of colourless needles by H. Moissan <hi rend="italic">(Comptes rendus,</hi>  1903, 136, p. 587) from the direct combination of its constituent elements. It rapidly dissociates when heated in vacuo to 300° C. The existence of the oxide Rt^O appears to be doubtful, the results of Erdmann and Kdthner <hi rend="italic">(loc. cit.)</hi>  pointing to the formation of RbOa by the direct union of the metal with dry oxygen. E. Rengade <hi rend="italic">(Comptes rendus, </hi>1907, 144, p. 920), by partially oxidizing the tietal in a current of dry oxygen and removing excess of metal by distillation in vacuo, has obtained oxides of composition Rb^ (yellowish white), Rb<hi rend="sub">2</hi>O3 (black) and Rb<hi rend="sub">2</hi>O<hi rend="sub">4</hi>  (yellow). Rubidium hydroxide, RbOH, is a colourless solid which is formed by the action of rubidium on water, or by the addition of baryta water to a solution of rubidium sulphate. It is readily soluble in water, the solution being very alkaline and caustic. It melts at 301 °. Evaporation of the aqueous solution at 15° C. deposits a crystalline hydrated hydroxide of composition RbOH*2H<hi rend="sub">2</hi>O (R. de Forcrand,<hi rend="italic">Comptes rendus,</hi>  1909» 149, p. 1341). Rubidium chloride, RbCl, is formed on burning rubidium in chlorine, or on dissolving the hydroxide in aqueous hydrochloric acid. It crystallizes in colourless cubes and volatilizes when heated very strongly. It is soluble in water and combines with many metallic chlorides to form double salts. It combines also with iodine chloride and bromide and with bromine chloride and with bromine (H. L. Wells and H. L. Wheeler, <hi rend="italic">Amer. Jour. Sci.,</hi>  1891 (3), 43,</p><p>P Rubidium sulphate, Rl^SO«, is formed by the action of sulphuric acid on the carbonate or hydroxide of the metal, or by the action of milk of lime on rubidium alum, the excess of lime being precipitated by rubidium carbonate and the solution neutralized by sulphuric acid. It forms large colourless hexagonal crystals. Several sulphides of the metal have been described by W. Biltz and E. Wilke-Dorfurt <hi rend="italic">(Zeit. anorg. Chem.,</hi>  1906, 48, p. 297). The normal sulphide, Rb<hi rend="sub">2</hi>S*4HiO, is colourless, and when heated in aqueous solution with the requisite amount of sulphur is transformed into the yellow tetrasulpnide, Rb<hi rend="sub">2</hi>S<hi rend="sub">4</hi>*2H<hi rend="sub">2</hi>O. A pentasulphide, RthSfi, which crystallizes in red prisms melting at 223° C., is also obtained by the direct union of the normal sulphide with sulphur. When heated in a current of hydrogen it is transformed into the colourless disulphide, whilst if the heating be carried out in a current of nitrogen it yields the trisulphide, RbjSj’HjO. These sulphides are much less hygroscopic than the corresponding caesium compounds. Rubidium nitrate, RbNOn. obtained by the action of nitric acid on the carbonate, crystallizes in needles or prisms and when strongly heated is transformed into a mixture of nitrite and oxide. Rubidium ammonium, RbNH<hi rend="sub">8</hi>, was prepared by H. Moissan<hi rend="italic">(Comptes rendus,</hi>  1903, 136, p. ii77) by the action of liquid ammonia on rubidium. Tne product combines with acetylene to form rubidium acetylide acetylene, Rb2C<hi rend="sub">2</hi>*C<hi rend="sub">2</hi>H<hi rend="sub">2</hi>, which on heating in vacuo loses acetylene and leaves a residue of rubidium carbide Rb<hi rend="sub">2</hi>C<hi rend="sub">2</hi>  (ibid. p. 1217). Rubidium carbonate, Rt^COg, formed by the addition of ammonium carbonate to rubidium hydroxide, is a crystalline mass which melts in its water of crystallization when heated.</p><p>The atomic weight of rubidium was determined by R. Bunsen <hi rend="italic">(Pogg. Ann.,</hi>  1861, 113, p. 339), Picard <hi rend="italic">(Zeit. anal. Chem.,</hi>  1862, 1, p. 510) and Godeffroy <hi rend="italic">(Ann.,</hi>  1876, 181, p. 185), the methods being basea on the conversion of rubidium halides into the corresponding silver salt, and the values obtained vary from 85*40 to 85*50. The determination of E. H. Archibald <hi rend="italic">(Jour. Chem. Soe.,</hi>  1904, 85, p. 776) from the analysis of the chloride and bromide gives the mean value as 85*485 (0 = 16).</p><p>RUBINSTEIN, ANTON GRIGOROVICH (1829-1894), Russian pianist, born of Jewish parentage on the 28th of November 1829 at Wechwotynetz, in Podolia, was the son of a pencil manufacturer who migrated to Moscow. The Rubinstein family, at the dictate of Anton’s grandfather Roman Rubinstein, had all been baptized at the time of the ukase against the Jews issued in 1830 by the Tsar Nicholas. Anton was then one year old. Besides his mother he had but one teacher, the piano master Alexander Villoing, of whom he declared at the end of his own career that he had never met a better. In July 1838 Rubinstein appeared in the theatre of the Petrowski Park at Moscow; and in the year following he went to Paris after Villoing, and in 1840 played before Liszt. For some time after this Rubinstein travelled in Holland, Germany and Scandinavia, and reached England in 1842, where on the 20th of May he made his first appearance at a Choral Fund concert. In 1845, after a brief visit to Moscow in 1843, he went with his family (including his brother Nikolaus) to Berlin in order to complete his musical education. Dehn was their master, and Mendelssohn, whom Rubinstein had met previously in London, their best friend. The sudden death of Rubinstein’s father necessitated the withdrawal of his mother and Nikolaus to Moscow, while Anton, on Dehn’s advice, went to Vienna to seek a livelihood. Hence, after more hard study for nearly two years, he went with the flautist Heindl, and later alone, on a concert tour in Hungary; and the outbreak of the revolution in Vienna preventing his return there, he went via Berlin to St Petersburg, where the Grand Duchess Hélène appointed him Kammervirtuos. About this time an unfortunate error of the police nearly caused his expatriation to Siberia, from which he was saved by his patroness. During the next eight years Rubinstein spent most of his time in St Petersburg studying, playing and composing. His opera <hi rend="italic">Dmitri Donskoi</hi>  was produced there in 1851, and <hi rend="italic">Toms der Narr</hi>  in 1853. <hi rend="italic">Die Sibirischen Jäger,</hi>  written about the same time, was not produced. On the advice of his patroness and Count Wilhorski he visited Hamburg and Leipzig, and arrived for the second time in London in 1857, when at a Philharmonic concert he introduced his own concerto in G. In the following year he was in London again, having in the meantime been appointed Concert Director of the Royal Russian Musical Society. In 1862, in collaboration with Carl Schuberth, he founded the St Petersburg Conservatorium, of which he was director until 1867. In 1868 he travelled in Germany, France and England, and remained for some time in Vienna, where he introduced a large number of his own compositions. Thence he went to America in 1872 and 1873, when he returned to Russia, and after a short rest set off once more on concert tours. In this manner the rest of his life was spent, until in 1885 he began a series of historical recitals of immense interest, which he gave in most of the chief European capitals. He died on the 20th of November 1894.</p><p>In addition to the works already named, Rubenstein left compositions in almost every known form. Among other of his operas are <hi rend="italic">Die Kinder der Haide, F er amors (Latta Roukh), Nero, Der Dämon</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">Die Makkabäer,</hi>  this last perhaps more frequently played than all the others, of which the chief defect is their lack of dramatic point. On the subject of oratorio Rubinstein held original views, though his attempt to realize them in <hi rend="italic">Moses</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">Christus</hi>  was not completely successful, while his efforts in Berlin and London to found a Sacred Theatre failed entirely. Nevertheless he himself regarded the <hi rend="italic">Christus </hi>as his greatest achievement. The most familiar of his five symphonies are the “ Ocean ” and the “ Dramatic?’ He wrote scores on scores of pianoforte works, from complex concertos to the most commonplace <hi rend="italic">salonstücke',</hi>  abundance of concerted chamber-music, and a number of songs and duets, which enjoyed some popularity. He also published several books, including his <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">Die geistliche Oper.</hi></p></body></text></TEI>
