<p><span class="font1">1508 (Louvre); the “ Esztcrhazy Madonna,” probably the same year; as well as the “ Madonna del Cardellino ” (Uffizi), the&nbsp;“ Tempi Madonna ” (Munich), the “ Colonna Madonna ”&nbsp;(Berlin), the “ Bridgewater Madonna ” (Bridgewater House),&nbsp;and the “ Orleans Madonna ’’ (duc d'Aumale's collection).&nbsp;The “ Ansidei Madonna ” was bought in 1884 for the National&nbsp;Gallery from the duke of Marlborough for £70,000, more than&nbsp;three times the highest price ever before given for a picture.@@<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>It was painted for the Ansidei family of Perugia as an altar-piece in the church of S. Fiorenzo, and is a work of the highest&nbsp;beauty in colour, well preserved and very large in scale. The&nbsp;Virgin with veiled head is seated on a throne, supporting the&nbsp;Infant with one hand and holding a book in the other. Below&nbsp;stands S. Niccolo da Tolentino, for whose altar it was painted;&nbsp;he holds a book and a crozier, and is clad in jewelled mitre&nbsp;and green cope, under which appear the alb and cassock. On&nbsp;the other side is the Baptist, in red mantle and camel's-hair&nbsp;tunic, holding a crystal cross. The rich jewellery in this picture&nbsp;is painted with Flemish-like minuteness. On the border of the&nbsp;Virgin’s robe is a date, formerly read as </span><span class="font0">MDV </span><span class="font1">by Passavant&nbsp;and others; it really is </span><span class="font0">MDVI </span><span class="font1">or </span><span class="font0">MDVII. </span><span class="font1">If the later date is&nbsp;the true one, the picture was probably begun a year or two&nbsp;before. A. favourite method of grouping his Holy Families is&nbsp;that seen in the “ Madonna del Cardellino ’’ and the “ Bella Giar-diniera,” in which the main lines form a pyramid. This arrangement is also used in the “ Madonna del Giardino ” and in the larger&nbsp;group, including St Joseph and St Elizabeth, known as the&nbsp;“ Canigiani Holy Family, ’’ now at Munich, one of the least&nbsp;graceful of all Raphael’s compositions. The “ Entombment&nbsp;of Christ,’’ now in the Galleria Borghese in Rome, was painted&nbsp;during a visit to Perugia in 1507 for Lady Atalanta Baglioni, in&nbsp;memory of the death of her brave and handsome but treacherous&nbsp;son Grifonetto, who was killed in 1500 by his enemies the Oddi&nbsp;party.@@<sup>2</sup> The many studies and preliminary sketches@@3 for this&nbsp;important picture which exist in various collections show that&nbsp;it cost Raphael an unusual amount of thought and labour in its&nbsp;composition, and yet it is quite one of his least successful paintings, especially in colour. It is, however, much injured by&nbsp;scraping and repainting, and appears not to be wholly by his&nbsp;hand. The “ Madonna del Baldacchino,” one of the finest&nbsp;compositions of the Florentine period, owing much to Fra&nbsp;Bartolommeo, is also unsatisfactory in execution; being left&nbsp;unfinished by Raphael, it was completed by Ridolfo Ghirlandajo,&nbsp;by whom the ungraceful angels of the upper part and the canopy&nbsp;were wholly executed, and even designed. It was painted for&nbsp;the Dei family as an altar-piece for their chapel in S. Spirito,&nbsp;Florence. The “ St Catherine ’’ of the National Gallery was pro-bably painted in 1507; its cartoon, pricked for transference,&nbsp;is in the Louvre. In colouring it much resembles parts of the&nbsp;Borghese “ Entombment,’’ being quiet and grey in tone. To the&nbsp;Florentine period belong some of his finest portraits, and it&nbsp;is especially in these that da Vinci’s influence appears. The&nbsp;portraits of Angelo Doni and his wife Maddalena (Pitti) are vivid&nbsp;and carefully executed paintings, and the unknown lady with&nbsp;hard features (now in the Uffizi) is a masterpiece of noble&nbsp;realism and conscientious finish. The Czartoriski portrait,&nbsp;a graceful effeminate-looking youth with long hair and tapering&nbsp;hands, now moved to Cracow, is probably a work of this period;&nbsp;though worthy to rank with Raphael’s finest portraits, its&nbsp;authenticity has been doubted. Very similar in style is the&nbsp;Herrenhausen portrait, once attributed to Giovanni Bellini,&nbsp;but an undoubted work of Raphael, in his second manner;&nbsp;it also represents a young man with long hair, close-shaven chin,&nbsp;a wide cloth hat and black dress, painted in half-length. The</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">so-called Portrait of Raphael by himself at Hampton Court is a very beautiful work, glowing with light and colour, which&nbsp;may possibly be a genuine picture of about 1506. It represents&nbsp;a pleasant-looking youth with turned-up nose, not bearing&nbsp;the remotest resemblance to Raphael, except the long hair&nbsp;and black cap common to nearly all the portraits of this time.@@4 A fine but much-restored portrait of Raphael by himself, painted&nbsp;at Florence, exists in the Uffizi; it represents him at a very&nbsp;early age, and was probably painted during the early part of his&nbsp;stay in Florence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Third or Roman Period, 1508-1520.—</span><span class="font1">In 1508 Raphael was painting several important pictures in Florence; in September&nbsp;of that year we find him settled in Rome, from a letter addressed&nbsp;in the warmest terms of affectionate admiration to Francia, to&nbsp;whom he sent a sketch for his “Adoration of the Shepherds,” and&nbsp;promised to send his own portrait in return for that which&nbsp;Francia had given him.@@5 Raphael was invited to Rome by his&nbsp;fellow-citizen (not relation, as Vasari says) Bramante, who was&nbsp;then occupied in the erection of the new church of St Peter,&nbsp;the foundation-stone of which had been laid by Julius II.&nbsp;on the 18th of April 1506. At this time the love of the popes&nbsp;for art had already attracted to Rome a number of the chief&nbsp;artists of Tuscany, Umbria and North Italy, among whom were&nbsp;Michelangelo, Signorelli, Perugino, Pinturicchio, Lorenzo Lotto,&nbsp;Peruzzi, Sodoma, and many others, and it was among this&nbsp;brilliant assembly that Raphael, almost at once, took a leading&nbsp;position.@@6 Thanks to Bramante’s friendly intervention, Julius&nbsp;II. (Della Rovere) soon became Raphael’s most zealous patron&nbsp;and friend, as did also the rich bankers Agostino Chigi (the&nbsp;Rothschild of his time) and Bindo Altoviti, whose portrait, at&nbsp;the age of twenty, now at Munich, is one of the most beautiful&nbsp;that Raphael ever produced.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@3</sup> These show that Raphael at first intended to paint a Deposition from the Cross, and aftenνards altered his scheme into the Entombment; an excess of study and elaboration partly account for the&nbsp;shortcomings of this picture.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@4</sup> To judge of the authorship of a portrait from internal evidence is especially difficult, as in so many cases the strong individuality of&nbsp;the person represented obscures that of the painter.</span></p>
