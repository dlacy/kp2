<p><span class="font2">The body is stout </span><span class="font0">and </span><span class="font2">thickly built; the legs are short and strong, and armed, especially the anterior pair, with long curved claws;&nbsp;the tail is short; and the ears are reduced to rudiments. The&nbsp;skull is conical, stout and heavy, and the teeth, although&nbsp;sharper and less rounded than those of badgers, are less suited&nbsp;to a carnivorous diet than those of stoats, weasels and martens.&nbsp;The two ratels may be distinguished by the fact that the African&nbsp;species has a distinct white line round the body at the junction&nbsp;of the grey of the upper side with the black of the lower, while&nbsp;in the Indian this line is absent; the teeth also of the former&nbsp;are larger, rounder and heavier than those of the latter. The&nbsp;two are, however, so nearly allied that they might almost&nbsp;be considered geographical races of a single species. Dr T. C.&nbsp;Jerdon states that the Indian ratel is found throughout the&nbsp;whole of India, from the extreme south to the foot of the&nbsp;Himalaya, chiefly in hilly districts, where it has greater facilities&nbsp;for constructing the holes and dens in which it lives; but also&nbsp;in the north of India in alluvial plains, where the banks of large&nbsp;rivers afford equally suitable localities wherein to make its lair.&nbsp;It is stated to live usually in pairs, and to eat rats, birds, frogs,&nbsp;white ants and various insects, and in the north of India it is&nbsp;accused of digging out dead bodies, and several of the native&nbsp;names mean “ grave-digger. ’’ Dr W. T. Blanford, in the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Fauna of British India,</span><span class="font2"> is of opinion that the reproach is without</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">foundation. Like its Cape congener it occasionally partakes of honey, and is often destructive to poultry. In confinement&nbsp;the Indian ratel becomes tame and even playful, displaying a&nbsp;habit of tumbling head over heels.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(R. L.*)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RATH, GERHARD VOM (1830-1888), German mineralogist, was born at Dinsburg in Prussia, on the 20th of August 1830.&nbsp;He was educated at Cologne, at Bonn University, and finally&nbsp;at Berlin, where he graduated Ph.D. in 1853. In 1856 he&nbsp;became assistant to Nöggerath in the mineralogical museum&nbsp;at Bonn, and succeeded to the directorship in 1872. Meanwhile in 1863 he was appointed extraordinary professor of&nbsp;geology, and in 1872 he became professor of geology and miner-alogy in the university at Bonn. He was distinguished for&nbsp;his accurate researches on mineralogy and crystallography;&nbsp;he described a great many new minerals, some of which were&nbsp;discovered by him, and he contributed largely to our knowledge of other minerals, notably in an essay on tridymite. He&nbsp;travelled much in southern Europe, Palestine and the United&nbsp;States, and wrote several essays on petrology, geology and&nbsp;physical geography, on earthquakes and on meteorites. He</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">died at Coblenz on the 23rd of April 1888.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">His separate publications included </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ein Ausflug nach Kalabrien </span><span class="font1">(1871); </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Der Mοnzοni im südöstlichen Tirol</span><span class="font1"> (1875); and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Durch</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">RATHENOW, </span><span class="font0">a </span><span class="font2">town of Germany, in the Prussian province of Brandenburg, on the Havel, 45 m. N.W. of Berlin on the main&nbsp;railway to Hanover. Pop. (1905) 23,095, including the garrison.&nbsp;The Protestant church of St Mary and St Andrew, originally&nbsp;a basilica, and transformed to the Gothic style in 1517-1589,&nbsp;and the Roman Catholic church of St George, are noteworthy.&nbsp;Rathenow is known for its “ Rathenow stones, ” bricks made&nbsp;of the clay of the Havel, and for its spectacles and optical&nbsp;instruments, which are exported.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Rathenow received its incorporation as a town in 1295. In 1394 it was taken and partly destroyed by the archbishop of&nbsp;Magdeburg. It suffered much from the ravages of the Thirty&nbsp;Years’ War, being occupied in turn by the Saxons and the&nbsp;Swedes, from whom in 1675 it was taken by the Brandenburgers,&nbsp;when most of the garrison were put to the sword.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">RATIBOR (Polish </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Raciborz),</span><span class="font2"> a town of Germany, in the Prussian province of Silesia, pleasantly situated on the left&nbsp;bank of the Oder at the point where the river becomes navigable, 13 m. from the Austrian frontier and 97 m. by rail S.E.&nbsp;of Breslau, on the main line to Oderberg. Pop. (1905) 32,690.&nbsp;The most prominent buildings are the handsome law-courts by&nbsp;Schinkel and the imposing chateau of the dukes of Ratibor,&nbsp;which occupies a commanding position on the right bank of the&nbsp;Oder. The town is the seat of various industries, the chief&nbsp;products of which are machinery, railway gear, iron wares,&nbsp;tobacco, cigars, paper, sugar, furniture and glass. Trade is&nbsp;carried on in these and in coal, wood and agricultural produce,&nbsp;while hemp and vegetables are largely grown in the environs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Ratibor, which received municipal privileges in 1217, was formerly the capital of an independent duchy, 380 sq. m. in&nbsp;extent, which existed from 1288 to 1532, and afterwards passed&nbsp;successively into the hands of Austria and Prussia. In 1821&nbsp;a small mediate principality was formed out of the old lordship&nbsp;of Ratibor and certain ecclesiastical domains, and was con-ferred upon Victor Amadeus, landgrave of Hesse-Rotenburg,&nbsp;as compensation for some Hessian territory absorbed by Prussia.&nbsp;The title of duke of Ratibor was revived in 1840 for his heir,&nbsp;Prince Victor of Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst (1818-1893).</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">RATIONALISM (from Lat. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">rationalis,</span><span class="font2"> pertaining to reason, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ratio),</span><span class="font2"> a term employed both in philosophy and in theology&nbsp;for any system which sets up human reason as the final criterion&nbsp;and chief source of knowledge. Such systems are opposed&nbsp;to all doctrines which rest solely or ultimately upon external&nbsp;authority; the individual must investigate everything for&nbsp;himself and abandon any position the validity of which cannot&nbsp;be rationally demonstrated. The rationalist spirit is, of course,&nbsp;coeval with human evolution; religion itself began with a&nbsp;rational attempt to maintain amicable relations with unknown&nbsp;powers, and each one of the dead religions succumbed before&nbsp;the development of rationalist inquiry into its premises. But&nbsp;the term has acquired more special connotations in modern&nbsp;thought. In its commonest use it is applied to all who decline&nbsp;to accept the authority of the Bible as the infallible record of&nbsp;a divine revelation, and is practically synonymous with free-thinking. This type of rationalism is based largely upon the&nbsp;results of modem historical and archaeological investigation.&nbsp;The story of the Creation in the book of Genesis is shown,&nbsp;from the point of view of chronology, to be a poetic or symbolic&nbsp;account by the discovery of civilizations of much greater antiquity. Again, the study of comparative religion (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span class="font2">. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">g.</span><span class="font2"> the study&nbsp;of the Deluge (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">q.v.),</span><span class="font2"> showing as it does that similar stories&nbsp;are to be found in primitive literature, both oriental and other)&nbsp;has placed the Bible in close relation with other ancient literature. The Bible, especially the Old Testament, is thus regarded&nbsp;even by orthodox Christians from a rationalist standpoint,</span></p><div style="border-right:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
