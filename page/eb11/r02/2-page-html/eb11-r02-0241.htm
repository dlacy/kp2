<p><span class="font2">music is exactly like the harmonic variety, and the limitations and waywardness of the one are no more archaic than those of&nbsp;the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">When the resources of later music and the treatment of instruments necessitated the publishing of music in score as&nbsp;well as in separate parts, it became necessary to guide the eye&nbsp;by drawing vertical lines (“ bars ”) at convenient distances.&nbsp;Hence the term “ score ” (Ger. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Partitur,</span><span class="font2"> Fr. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">partition).</span><span class="font2"> These&nbsp;divisions naturally coincided with the main rhythmic groups,&nbsp;and eventually became equidistant. This purely practical&nbsp;custom has co-operated with the great increase of rhythmic&nbsp;firmness necessary for the coherence of those large modern&nbsp;forms which decree the shape rather than the texture of the&nbsp;music, until our notions of rhythm may fairly be described&nbsp;as bar-ridden. And, since the vast majority of our musical&nbsp;rhythms absorb the utmost complexity of detail into the most&nbsp;square and symmetrical framework possible, we are taught to&nbsp;regard the “ 4-bar period ” as a normal (or even ultimate)&nbsp;rhythmic principle, instead of contenting ourselves with broader&nbsp;conceptions which treat symmetry and proportion in time as&nbsp;freely as they are treated in space. It cannot be too strongly&nbsp;emphasized that the bar indicates no universal musical principle.&nbsp;The havoc wrought by mechanical teaching on this point is&nbsp;incalculable, especially in the childish crudeness of current&nbsp;ideas as to the declamation of words in classical and modern&nbsp;music: ideas which mislead even some composers who might&nbsp;have been expected to know better.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As rhythm is contemplated in larger measures, it becomes increasingly difficult to say where the sense of rhythm ends&nbsp;and the sense of proportion begins. The same melody that&nbsp;may be felt as a square and symmetrical piece of proportion&nbsp;in four-bar rhythm if it is taken slowly, will be equally rational&nbsp;as a single bar of “ common time ” (see below) if it is taken&nbsp;very quickly; and between these two extremes there may be&nbsp;insensible gradations. All that can be laid down is that composers are apt to use short bars where they demand constant&nbsp;strong accent, while long bars will imply smoother rhythms. For&nbsp;example, if the scherzo of Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony were&nbsp;written in 7 instead of ’ bars, then the passages now marked&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ritmo di tre battute</span><span class="font2"> would have to appear in Î time, and so&nbsp;the changes of rhythm would be much more visible on paper.&nbsp;But the tendency to put a strong accent on the first beat of&nbsp;every bar would make this notation an undesirable substitute&nbsp;for Beethoven’s, since it would lead to a neglect of the subordinate accents (all of them bar-accents, as Beethoven writes&nbsp;them). The trio of this scherzo shows the opposite case in the&nbsp;fact that Beethoven first intended to write it in ’ time, but,&nbsp;in order to indicate a more tranquil flow at the same pace,&nbsp;doubled the quantity contained in a bar, substituting </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">alla&nbsp;breve</span><span class="font2"> bars, each equal to two of the preceding </span><span class="font5">Î </span><span class="font2">bars. The&nbsp;alteration produced a discrepancy in the metronome marks,&nbsp;which has always caused controversy among conductors, but&nbsp;the facts admit of only one interpretation. It is clear, then,&nbsp;that the only sound theory of musical rhythm will be that in&nbsp;which accent, beat, bar, and even form and proportion are&nbsp;relative terms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The kinds of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">time (i.e.</span><span class="font4"> rhythmic groups forming, as it were, invariable molecules in the structure of any continuous piece of&nbsp;music) that are used in all music from the 15th century onwards&nbsp;are nowadays classified as </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">duple</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">triple,</span><span class="font4"> and each of these may&nbsp;be </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">simple</span><span class="font4"> or </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">compound..</span><span class="font4"> Simple time is that in which the normal&nbsp;subdivision of its beats is by two, whether the number of the beats&nbsp;themselves is duple or triple. Compound time is that in which&nbsp;the beats are regularly divided by three, which three subdivisions&nbsp;are reckoned as subordinate beats. The beats are in all kinds of&nbsp;time reckoned as halves, quarters, 8ths, i6ths or even 32nds of the&nbsp;standard note in modem music, the semibreve: and the time-signature placed at the beginning of a piece of music is really a&nbsp;fraction, of which the numerator expresses the number of beats in&nbsp;a bar, while the denominator expresses the size of a beat. Thus&nbsp;J signifies three crotchets in a bar. Compound time is expressed,&nbsp;not by using normal fractions of a semibreve as main beats and&nbsp;dividing them into </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">triplets,@@</span><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> but by using </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">dotted</span><span class="font4"> beats. A dot after</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font4">@@@<sup>1</sup>Triplets are groups of three equal notes crowded, into the time normally taken by two. Binary and ternary subdivision answer</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font4"> note adds another half to its value, and so not only do we obtain the means of expressing a great variety </span><span class="font3">of </span><span class="font4">rhythmic effects (especially quantitative effects of iambic and trochaic character) in all&nbsp;kinds of time, but w’c are able to use normal fractions </span><span class="font3">of </span><span class="font4">a semibreve as the subordinate beats of compound time. Thus J is the&nbsp;compound time obtained by dotting the two crotchets of J time,&nbsp;and is thus totally different in accent and meaning from J time&nbsp;though that also contains six quavers in a bar. The most highly&nbsp;compound times in classical music are to be found in the last movement of Beethoven’s Sonata, Op. </span><span class="font3">III. </span><span class="font4">Hc begins by dividing bars&nbsp;of </span><span class="font1">5 </span><span class="font4">into their usual compound time /«. He then divides the&nbsp;six half-beats of </span><span class="font5">Î </span><span class="font4">time by three, producing » (which he incorrectly calls ,·), and lastly he divides the 12 quarter-beats by 3,&nbsp;producing ” (which he calls JJ). The special signatures C for&nbsp;ί time, and C for 1 time are the last survivals of the time system&nbsp;of the middle ages (see Musical Notation). That complicated&nbsp;system of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">mood, time</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">prolation</span><span class="font4"> was capable of expressing&nbsp;even more highly compound rhythms than our usual time-signatures,&nbsp;though the complexity was in most cases unreal, since the small&nbsp;rhythmic ictus of ecclesiastical polyphony renders little but the&nbsp;general distinction between duple and triple rhythm audible:&nbsp;especially as the more compound rhythms were not subdivisions&nbsp;but multiples, involving lengths better measurable by an eight-day&nbsp;clock than by human ears. The second Kyrie of Palestrinas&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Missa PHornrnc Armé</span><span class="font4"> is one of the rare cases which remain both&nbsp;rhythmic and complex when transcribed in modern score? For&nbsp;genuine, articulate complexity the ballroom scene in Mozart’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Don Giovanni</span><span class="font4"> has never been surpassed. So real are its three&nbsp;simultaneous rhythms of minuet, contredanse and waltz that the&nbsp;persons on the stage actually dance to whichever suits their character. Anomalous measures such as J and J time, whether&nbsp;divisible into alternations of J and J or not, are aesthetically best&nbsp;regarded not as rhythmic units, but as extreme cases of unsym-metrical phrase-rhythm erected into a system for special effect.&nbsp;They tend, however, to group themselves into musical sentences&nbsp;of reactionary squareness; and the J movement of Tschaikovsky’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Pathetic Symphony</span><span class="font4"> consists of twenty 8-bar periods (twenty-four,&nbsp;counting the repeats) before an unpaired a-bar phrase is heard in&nbsp;the short coda. Even the last bar is not odd, though it is the 179th,&nbsp;for the rhythm ends with an unwritten 180th bar of silence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There is, no doubt, a germ of truth in current doctrine as to the fundamental character of 4-bar phrase-rhythms, inasmuch&nbsp;as the human anatomy has a bilateral symmetry with either&nbsp;limb on one side slightly stronger than that on the other. This&nbsp;is probably the basis of our natural tendency to group rhythmic&nbsp;units in pairs, with a stress on the first of each pair; and hence,&nbsp;if our attention is drawn to larger groups, we put more stress&nbsp;on the first of the first pair than on the first of the second;&nbsp;and so with still greater groups, until our immediate and unanalysed sense of rhythm merges into a sense of proportion&nbsp;distributed through time with a clear consciousness of past,&nbsp;present and future. The point at which this merging takes</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">every ordinary purpose of musical rhythm,Being capable of expressing clear distinctions, far more minute than have ever been regulated in speech. It is impossible to pronounce a syllable in less than a tenth of a second; but it is easy to play 16 notes in a second on&nbsp;the pianoforte. (That is to say, musical rhythm, continues to be&nbsp;measurable up to the point at which atmospheric vibrations coalesce&nbsp;in the ear as low’ musical notes!) In à series of such rapid notes&nbsp;a single break twice in a second would have a very obvious rhythmic&nbsp;effect directly </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">measured</span><span class="font4"> by the ear. lf the broken series w’ere&nbsp;levelled into an even, series of fourteen notes a second, the rhythmic&nbsp;effect would be entirely different, though the actual difference of&nbsp;pace would be only 5^ of a second.. The special sign for triplets&nbsp;is readily adapted to other subdivisions where necessary; but such&nbsp;adaptation generally indicates rather, a freedom of declamatory&nbsp;rhythm than any. abstruse arithmetical accuracy. Among the&nbsp;worst barbarisms in musical editing is the persistent reduction of&nbsp;Chopin’s septoles, groups of 13 and other, indeterminables,, into&nbsp;mutton-cutlet frills. A natural freedom in performance is as&nbsp;necessary for the minutiae of musical rhythm as it is in speech ;&nbsp;but where all but the finest players fail is in basing this freedom on&nbsp;the superlative accuracy of the rhythmic notation of the great&nbsp;composers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> In the critical edition of Palestrina’s complete works, vol. xii. p. 177 (Breitkopf and Härtel), the editor has violently simplified it.&nbsp;He is justified in using the ordinary C bars to hold the piece together,&nbsp;and he is not called upon to reproduce the riddles of the original&nbsp;notation; but some secondary time signatures ought.to have been&nbsp;added to indicate the strong swing of the tunc in its conflicting&nbsp;shapes; and there is no justification, in a full score intended for&nbsp;scholars, in supplanting the true rhythm of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">quintus</span><span class="font4"> by a rough&nbsp;practical compromise.</span></p>
