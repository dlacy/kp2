<p><span class="font0">ger contain his indignation at being thus made the inſtrument of a tyrant’s cruelty. He therefore propoſed to the conſpirators to attack him as he went to offer ſacrifices in the Capitol, or while he was employed&nbsp;in the ſecret pleaſures of the palace. The reſt, however, were of opinion, that it was beſt to fall upon him&nbsp;when he ſhould be unattended ; by which means they&nbsp;would be more certain of ſucceſs. After ſeveral deliberations, it was at laſt reſolved to attack him during&nbsp;the continuance of the Palatine games, which laſted&nbsp;ſour days; and to ſtrike the blow when his guards&nbsp;ſhould have the leaſt opportunity to defend hi u. In&nbsp;conſequence of this, the three firſt days of the games&nbsp;paſted without affording that opportunity which was ſo&nbsp;ardently deſired. Cherea now, therefore, began to apprehend, that deferring the time of the conſpiracy&nbsp;might be a mean to divulge it : he even began to&nbsp;dread, that the honour of killing the tyrant might fall&nbsp;to the lot of ſome other perſon more bold than himſelf.&nbsp;Wherefore, he at laſt reſolved to defer the execution of&nbsp;his plot only to the day following, when Caligula ſhould&nbsp;paſs through a private gallery, to ſome baths not far&nbsp;diſtant from the palace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The laſt day of the games was more ſplendid than the reſt ; and Caligula ſeemed more ſprightly and con-deſcending than uſhal. He took great amuſement in&nbsp;ſeeing the people ſeramble for the fruits and other rarities thrown by his order among them ; and ſeemed&nbsp;no way apprehenſive of the plot for r,ed ſor his deſtruction. In the mean time, thé conſpiracy began to tran-ſpire; and had he poſſeſſed any friends, it could not have&nbsp;failed of being diſcovered. The conſpirators waited a&nbsp;great part of the day with the moſt extreme anxiety ;&nbsp;and at one time Caligula ſeemed reſolved to ſpend the&nbsp;whole day without any refreſhment. This unexpected&nbsp;delay entirely exaſperated Cherea; and had he not been&nbsp;reſtrained, he would have gone and perpetrated his&nbsp;deſign in the midſt of all the people. Juſt at that inſtant, while he was yet hefιtating what he ſhould do,&nbsp;Aſprenas, one of the conſpirators, perfuadcd Caligula&nbsp;to go to the bath and take ſome flight refreſhment, in&nbsp;order to enjoy the reſt of the entertainment with greater reliſh. The emperor therefore riling up, the conſpirators uſed every precaution to keep off the throng,&nbsp;and to ſurround him, under pretence of greater affι-duity. Upon entering into the little vaulted gallery&nbsp;that led to the bath, he was met by a band of Grecian&nbsp;children who had been inſtructed in ſinging, and were&nbsp;come to perform in his preſence. He was once more&nbsp;therefore going to return into the theatre with them,&nbsp;had not the leader of the band excuſed himſelf, as having a cold» This was the moment that Cherea ſeized&nbsp;to ſtrike him to the ground ; crying out, “ Tyrant,&nbsp;think upon this.” Immediately after, the other conſpirators ruſhed in; and while the- emperctr continued&nbsp;to refiſt, crying out, that he was not yet dead, they&nbsp;diſpatched hi u with 30 wounds, in the 29th year of&nbsp;his age, after a ſhort reign of three years ten months&nbsp;and eight, days. With him, his wiſe and infant daughter alſo periſhed , the one being ſtabbed by a centurion,&nbsp;the other having its brains daſhed out againſt the walk&nbsp;His coin was alſo melted down by a decree of the ſenate ; and ſuch precautions were taken, that all ſeemed&nbsp;willing, that neither his features nor his name might be&nbsp;tranſmitted to poſterity.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">As ſoon as the death Caligula was made public, it produced the greateſt confuſion in all parts of the city.&nbsp;The conſpirators, who only aimed at deſtroying a tyrant without attending to a ſucceffor, had all ſought&nbsp;ſafety by retiring to private places. Some thought&nbsp;the report of the emperor’s death was only an artifice&nbsp;of his own, to ſee how his enemies would behave.&nbsp;Others averred that he was ſtill alive, and actually in&nbsp;a fair way to recover. In this interval of ſuſpenſe, the&nbsp;German guards finding it a convenient time to pillage,&nbsp;gave a looſe to their licentiouſneſs, under a pretence of&nbsp;revenging the emperor’s death. All the conſpiratora&nbsp;and ſenators that ſell in their way received no mercy ;&nbsp;Aſprenas, Norbanus, and Anteius, were cut in pieces.&nbsp;However, they grew calm hy degrees, and the ſenate&nbsp;was permitted to aſſemble, in order to deliberate upon&nbsp;what w<sup>,</sup>as neceſſary to be done in the preſent emergency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In this deliberation, Saturninus, who was then con-ſtil, inſiſted much upon the benefits of liberty ; and talked in raptures of Cherea’s fortitude, alleging that it deſerved the higheſt reward. This was a language&nbsp;highly pleaſing to the ſenate. Liberty now became the&nbsp;favourite topic ; and they even ventured to talk of extinguiſhing the very name of Cæſar. Impreſſed with&nbsp;this reſolution, they brought over ſome cohorts of the&nbsp;city to their ſide, and boldly ſeized upon the Capitol.&nbsp;But it was now too late for Rome to regain her priſtine&nbsp;freedom ; the populace and the army oppoſing their&nbsp;endeavours. The former were ſtill mindful of their ancient hatred to the ſenate ; and remembered the donations and public ſpectacles of the emperors with regret. <sup>r</sup>Γhe latter were ſenſible they could have no&nbsp;power but in a monarchy ; and had ſome hopes that&nbsp;the election of the emperor would fall to their determination. In this oppoſition of intereſts, and variety&nbsp;of opinions, chance ſeemed at laſt to decide the fate of&nbsp;the empire. Some ſoldiers happening to run about the&nbsp;palace, diſcovered Claudius, Caligula’s uncle, lurking&nbsp;in a ſecret place, where he had hid himſelf through&nbsp;ſear. Of this perſonage, who had hitherto been deſpiſed for his imbecillity, they reſolved to make an emperor : and accordingly carried him upon their ſhoulders&nbsp;to the camp, where they proclaimed him at a time he&nbsp;expected nothing but death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The ſenate now, therefore, perceiving that force alone was likely to ſettle the ſucceiſion, were reſolved&nbsp;to fubmit, ſince they had no power to oppoſe. Claudius was the perſon moſt nearly allied to the late emperor, then living ; being the nephew of Tiberius, and&nbsp;the uncle of Caligula. The ſenate therefore paſſed a&nbsp;decree, confirming him in the empire ; and went ſoon&nbsp;after in a body, to render him their compullive homage. Cherea vyas the firſt who fell a ſacriſice to the&nbsp;jealoufy of this new monarch. He met death with all&nbsp;the fortitude of an ancient Roman ; deſiring to die by&nbsp;the ſame ſword with which* he had killed Caligula.&nbsp;Lupus, his friend, was put to death with him ; and Sa-binus, one. of the conſpirators, laid violent hands on&nbsp;himſelf.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Claudius was 50 years old when he began to reign. The complicated diſeaſes of his infancy had in ſome&nbsp;teeaſure affected all the faculties both of his body and&nbsp;mind. He was continued in a ſtate of pupillage much&nbsp;longer than w<sup>τ</sup>as uſual at that time; and ſeemed, in</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
