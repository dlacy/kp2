<p><span class="font0">out regard to the line of its course. The river generally adheres to the steepest hills, whether they advance into the&nbsp;plain or retire from it. This general feature may be ob-, served over the whole globe. It is divided into compartments by great ranges of mountains ; and it may be observed, that the great rivers hold their course not very far from&nbsp;them, and that their chief feeders come from the other side.&nbsp;In every compartment there is a swell of the low country&nbsp;at a distance from the bounding ridge of mountains ; and&nbsp;on the summit of this swell the principal feeders of the great&nbsp;river have their sources.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The name </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">valley</span><span class="font0"> is given with less propriety to these immense regions, and is more applicable to tracts of champaign land which the eye can take in at one view. Even here we may observe a resemblance. It is not always in&nbsp;the very lowest part of this valley that the river has its bed :&nbsp;although the waters of the river flow in a channel below’ its&nbsp;immediate banks, these banks are frequently higher than&nbsp;the grounds at the foot of the hills. This is very distinctly&nbsp;seen in Lower Egypt, by means of the canals which are&nbsp;carried backward from the Nile for accelerating its fertilizing inundations. When the calishes are opened to admit&nbsp;the waters, it is always observed that the districts most remote are the first covered, and it is several days before the&nbsp;immediately adjoining fields partake of the blessing. This&nbsp;is a consequence of that general opinion of nature by which&nbsp;the valleys are formed. The river in its floods is loadcd&nbsp;with mud, which it retains as long as it rolls rapidly along&nbsp;its limited bed, tumbling its waters over and over, and taking up in every spot as much as it deposits : but as soon as&nbsp;it overflows its banks, the very enlargement of its section&nbsp;diminishes the velocity of the water ; and it may be observed still running in the track of its bed with grcat velocity,&nbsp;while the waters on each side are stagnant at a very small&nbsp;distance: therefore the water, on getting over the banks, must&nbsp;deposit the heaviest, the firmest, and even the greatest part&nbsp;of its burden, and must become gradually clearer as it approaches the hills. Thus a gentle slope is given to the valley in a direction which is the reverse of what one would&nbsp;expect. It is, however, almost always the case in wide valleys, especially if the great river comes through a soft country. The banks of the brooks and ditches are observed to&nbsp;be deeper as they approach the river, and the merely superficial drains run backwards from it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We have already observed that the enlargement of the bed of a river, in its approach to the sea, is not in proportion to the increase of its waters. This would be the case&nbsp;even if the velocity continued the same ; and, therefore,&nbsp;since the velocity increases in consequence of the greater&nbsp;energy of a large body of water, which we now understand&nbsp;distinctly, a still smaller bed is sufficient for conveying all&nbsp;the water to the sea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This general law is broken, how<sup>r</sup>ever, in the immediate neighbourhood of the sea ; because in this situation the velocity of the water is checked by the passing flood-tides of&nbsp;the ocean. As the whole waters must still be discharged,&nbsp;they require a larger bed, and the enlargement will be&nbsp;chiefly in width. The sand and mud are deposited when&nbsp;the motion is retarded. The depth of the mouth of the&nbsp;channel is therefore diminished. It must therefore become&nbsp;wider. If this be done on a coast exposed to the force of&nbsp;a regular tide, which carries the waters of the ocean across&nbsp;the mouth of the river, this regular enlargement of the&nbsp;mouth w’ill be the only consequence, and it will generally&nbsp;widen till it washes the foot of the adjoining hills ; but if&nbsp;there be no tide in the sea, or a tide which does not set&nbsp;across the mouth of the river, the sands must be deposited&nbsp;at the sides of the opening, and become additions to the&nbsp;shore, lengthening the mouth of the channel. In this sheltered situation, every trivial circumstance will cause the&nbsp;river to work more on particular parts of the bottom, and&nbsp;deepen the channel there. This keeps the mud suspended&nbsp;in such parts of the channel, and it is not deposited till the&nbsp;stream has shot farther out into the sea. It is deposited&nbsp;on the sides of those deeper parts of the channel, and increases the velocity in them, and thus still farther protracts&nbsp;the deposition. Rivers so situated will not only lengthen&nbsp;their channels, but will divide them, and produce islands at&nbsp;their mouths. A bush, a tree torn up by the roots by a&nbsp;mountain torrent, and floated down the stream, will thus&nbsp;inevitably produce an island ; and rivers in w hich this is&nbsp;common will be continually shifting their mouths. The&nbsp;Mississippi is a most remarkable instance of this. It has a&nbsp;long course through a rich soil, and disembogues itself into&nbsp;the bay of Mexico, in a place w’here there is no </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">passing&nbsp;tide,</span><span class="font0"> as may be seen by comparing the hours of high water&nbsp;in difterent places. No river that we know’ carries down&nbsp;its stream such numbers of rooted-up trees ; they frequently&nbsp;interrupt the navigation, and render it always dangerous in&nbsp;the night-time. This river is so beset with flats and shifting sands at its mouth, that the most experienced pilots are&nbsp;puzzled ; and it has protruded its channel above fifty miles&nbsp;in the short period that we have known it. The discharge&nbsp;of the Danube is very similar : so is that of the Nile, for&nbsp;it is discharged into a still corner of the Mediterranean. It&nbsp;may now be said to have acquired considerable permanency ; but much of this is owing to human industry, which&nbsp;strips it as much as possible of its subsideable matter. The&nbsp;Ganges, too, is in a situation pretty similar, and exhibits&nbsp;similar phenomena. The Maragnon might be noticed as&nbsp;an exception ; but it is not an exception. It has flowed&nbsp;very far in a level bed, and its waters come pretty clear to&nbsp;Para ; but, besides, there is a strong transverse tide, or rather current, at its mouth, setting to the south-east both&nbsp;during flood and ebb. The mouth of the Po is perhaps the&nbsp;most remarkable of any on the surface of this globe, and&nbsp;exhibits appearances extremely singular. Its discharge is&nbsp;into a sequestered corner of the Adriatic. Though there&nbsp;be a more remarkable tide in this gulf than in any part of&nbsp;the Mediterranean, it is still but trifling, and it either sets&nbsp;directly in upon the mouth of the river or retires straight&nbsp;away from it. The river has many mouths, and they shift&nbsp;prodigiously. There has been a general increase of the&nbsp;land very remarkable. The marshes where Venice now&nbsp;stands were in the Augustan age everywhere penetrable&nbsp;by the fishing-boats, and in tile fifth century could only&nbsp;bear a few’ miserable huts ; now they are covered with crowds&nbsp;of stately buildings. Ravenna, situated on the southernmost mouth of the Po, was, in the Augustan age, at the&nbsp;extremity of a swamp, and the road to it was along the top&nbsp;of an artificial mound, made by Augustus at an immense&nbsp;expense. It was, however, a fine city, containing extensive&nbsp;docks, arsenals, and other massy buildings, being the great&nbsp;military port of the empire, where Augustus laid up his&nbsp;great ships of war. In the Gothic times it became almost&nbsp;the capital of the western empire, and was the seat of government and of luxury. It must therefore be supposed&nbsp;to have every accommodation of opulence, and we cannot&nbsp;doubt of its having paved streets, wharfs, &amp;c. ; so that its&nbsp;wealthy inhabitants were at least walking dryfooted from&nbsp;house to house. But now it is an Italian mile from the&nbsp;sea, and surrounded with vineyards and cultivated fields,&nbsp;and is accessible in every direction. All this must have&nbsp;been formed by depositions from the Po, flowing through&nbsp;Lombardy loaded witll the spoils of the Alps, which were&nbsp;here arrested by the reeds and bulrushes of the marsh.&nbsp;These things arc in common course ; but when wells are&nbsp;dug, we come to the pavements of the ancient city, and&nbsp;these pavements are all on one exact level, and they </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ore&nbsp;eight feet below the surface of the sea at low water.</span><span class="font0"> This&nbsp;cannot be ascribed to the subsiding of the ancient city.&nbsp;This would be irregular, and greatest among the heavy</span></p>
