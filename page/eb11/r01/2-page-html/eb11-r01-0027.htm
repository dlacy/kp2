<p><span class="font0">absolute physical constants of molecular theory, such as the constant of Avogadro, which arc in close accord with other&nbsp;recent determinations. But on the other hand these determinations are already involved in the earlier formula of Rayleigh,&nbsp;which expresses the distribution for long waves, based merely&nbsp;on the Maxwell-Boltzmann principle of the equable partition&nbsp;of the energy among the high free periods belonging to the&nbsp;enclosure which contains it. It is maintained by Jeans that the&nbsp;reason why this principle is of avail only for very long wave-lengths is that a steady state is never reached for the shorter ones,&nbsp;a doctrine which as he admits would entirely remove the foundations of the application of thermodynamic principles to this&nbsp;subject. By an argument based on the theory of dimensions,&nbsp;Lorentz has been led to the conclusion that consistency between&nbsp;temperatures, as measured molecularly, and as measured by the&nbsp;laws of radiation, requires that the ultimate indivisible electric&nbsp;charges or electrons must be the same in all kinds of matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The abstract statistical theory of entropy, which is here invoked, admits of generalization in a way which is a modification of that of Planck, itself essentially different from the earlier&nbsp;idea of Boltzmann. The molecules of matter, whose interactions&nbsp;control physical phenomena, including radiation, are too&nbsp;numerous to be attended to separately in our knowledge. They,&nbsp;and the phenomena in which they interact, must thus be sorted&nbsp;out into differential groups or classes. Elements of energy of&nbsp;specified types might at first sight constitute such classes: but&nbsp;the identity of a portion of energy cannot be traced during its&nbsp;transformations, while an element of physical disturbance can&nbsp;be definitely followed, though its energy changes by interaction&nbsp;with other elements as it proceeds. The whole disturbance&nbsp;may thus be divided into classes, or groups of similar elements,&nbsp;each with permanent existence: and these may be considered&nbsp;as distributed in series of cells, all equivalent in extent, which&nbsp;constitute and map out the material system or other domain of&nbsp;the phenomena. The test of this equivalence of extent is&nbsp;superposition, in the sense that the same element of disturbance&nbsp;always occupies during its wanderings the same number of cells.&nbsp;This framework being granted, the probability of any assigned&nbsp;statistical distribution of the elements of disturbance now&nbsp;admits of calculation; and it represents, as above, the logarithm&nbsp;of the entropy of that distribution, multiplied however by a&nbsp;coefficient which must depend on the minuteness of scale of the&nbsp;statistics. But in the calculation, all the physical laws which&nbsp;impose restrictions on the migrations of the elements of disturbance must be taken into account; it is only after this is&nbsp;done that the rest of the circumstances can be treated as&nbsp;fortuitous. All these physical laws are, however, required and&nbsp;used up in determining the complex of equivalent cells into&nbsp;which the system which forms the seat of the energy is mapped&nbsp;out. On this basis thermodynamics can be constructed in&nbsp;a priori abstract fashion, and with deeper and more complete&nbsp;implications than the formal Carnot principle of negation of&nbsp;perpetual motions can by itself attain to. But the ratio of the&nbsp;magnitude of the standard element of disturbance to the extent&nbsp;of the standard cell remains inherent in the results, appearing&nbsp;as an absolute physical constant whose value is determined&nbsp;somehow by the other fundamental physical constants of&nbsp;nature. A prescribed ratio of this kind is, however, a different&nbsp;thing from the hypothesis that energy is constituted atomically,&nbsp;which underlies, as Lorentz pointed out, Planck’s form of the&nbsp;theory. It has indeed already been remarked that the mere&nbsp;fact of the existence of a wave-length λ<sub>m</sub> of maximum radiation,&nbsp;whether obeying Wien’s law λ<sub>m</sub>T=constant or not, implies&nbsp;by itself some prescribed absolute physical quantity of this&nbsp;kind, whose existence thus cannot be evaded, though we may be&nbsp;at a loss to specify its nature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">13. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Modification by a Magnetic Field. —</span><span class="font0">The theory of exchanges of radiation, which makes the equilibrium of radiating&nbsp;bodies depend on temperature alone, requires that, when an&nbsp;element of surface of one body is radiating to an element of&nbsp;surface of another body at the same temperature, the amounts&nbsp;of energy interchanged (when reflexion is counted in along with&nbsp;radiation) should be equal. This proposition is a general&nbsp;dynamical consequence—on the basis of the laws of reciprocity&nbsp;developed in this connexion (after W. Rowan Hamilton) mainly&nbsp;by Helmholtz, Kirchhoff, and Rayleigh—of the form of the&nbsp;equations of propagation of vibrations in the medium. But in&nbsp;a material medium under the influence of a strong magnetic&nbsp;field these equations are altered by the addition of extraneous&nbsp;terms involving differential coefficients of the third order, and&nbsp;the dynamical consistency of the cardinal principle of the&nbsp;theory of exchanges is no longer thus directly verified. A&nbsp;system of this kind has, in fact, been imagined by Wien in which&nbsp;the principle is imperfectly fulfilled. A beam coining from a&nbsp;body A, and polarized by passage through a nicol, may have&nbsp;its plane of vibration rotated through half a right angle by&nbsp;crossing a magnetically active plate, and may then pass through&nbsp;another nicol, properly orientated for transmission, so as finally&nbsp;to fall on another body B. On the other hand, the radiation&nbsp;from B which gets through this adjacent nicol will have its&nbsp;plane of vibration rotated through another half right angle by&nbsp;the magnetically active plate, and so will not get through the&nbsp;first nicol to the body A. Such possibilities of unequal exchange of radiation between A and B are the result of the want&nbsp;of reversibility of the radiation in the extraneous magnetic&nbsp;field, which might have been expected to lead to proportionate&nbsp;inequalities of concentration; in this example, however, though&nbsp;the defect of reversibility is itself slight, its results appear at&nbsp;first sight to prevent any equilibrium at all. But a closer&nbsp;examination removes this discrepancy. In order to make the&nbsp;system self-contained, reflectors must be added to it, so as to&nbsp;send back into the sources the polarized constituents that are&nbsp;turned aside out of the direct line by the nicols. Then, as&nbsp;Brillouin has pointed out, and as in fact Rayleigh had explained&nbsp;some years before, the radiation from B does ultimately get&nbsp;across to A after passage backward and forward to the reflectors&nbsp;and between the nicols: this, it is true, increases the length of&nbsp;its path, and therefore diminishes the concentration of a single&nbsp;narrow beam, but any large change of path would make the&nbsp;beam too wide for the nicols, and thus require other corrections&nbsp;which may be supposed to compensate. The explanation of&nbsp;the slight difference that is to be anticipated on theoretical&nbsp;grounds might conceivably be that in such a case the magnetic&nbsp;influence, being operative on the phases, alters the statistical&nbsp;constitution of the radiation of given wave-length from the&nbsp;special type that is in equilibrium with a definite temperature,&nbsp;so that after passage through the magnetic medium it is not in&nbsp;a condition to be entirely absorbed at that temperature; there&nbsp;would then be some other element, in addition to temperature,&nbsp;involved in equilibrium in a magnetic field. If this is not so,&nbsp;there must be some thermodynamic compensation involving&nbsp;reaction, extremely small, however, on the magnetizing system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">14. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Origin of Spectra. —</span><span class="font0">In addition to the thermal radiations&nbsp;of material substances, those, namely, which establish temperature-equilibrium of the enclosure in which they are confined,&nbsp;there are the fluorescent and other radiations excited by extraneous causes, radiant or electric or chemical. Such radiations are an indication, by the presence of higher wave-lengths&nbsp;than belong in any sensible degree to the temperature, that the&nbsp;steady state has not arrived; they thus fade away, either&nbsp;immediately on the cessation of the exciting cause, or after an&nbsp;interval. The radiations, consisting of definite narrow bright&nbsp;bands in the spectrum, that are characteristic of the gaseous&nbsp;state in which each molecule can vibrate freely by itself, are&nbsp;usually excited by electric or chemical agency; thus there is&nbsp;no ground for assuming that they always constitute true temperature radiation. The absorption of these radiations by&nbsp;strata of the same gases at low temperatures seems to prove&nbsp;that the unaltered molecules themselves possess these free&nbsp;periods, which do not, therefore, belong specially to dissociated&nbsp;ions. Although very difficult to excite directly, these free&nbsp;vibrations are then excited and absorb the energy of the incident waves, under the influence of resonance, which naturally&nbsp;becomes extremely powerful when the tuning is exact: this</span></p>
