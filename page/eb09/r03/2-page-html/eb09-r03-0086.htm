        <p><span class="font1">governor, which was open to every provincial, and in the right of
                petition. Under the Antonines, not the least&nbsp;laborious of the duties which
                devolved upon the emperor&nbsp;and his ministers was the daily one of hearing and
                deciding&nbsp;the innumerable cases sent up from the provinces. On&nbsp;the other
                hand, the growing frequency of imperial mandates&nbsp;and rescripts (see above, p.
                705), dealing both with questions of general policy and with points of law,
                attests&nbsp;the close attention paid by all the better emperors to
                the&nbsp;government of the provinces and the increasing dependence&nbsp;of the
                governor on imperial guidance. Within the province&nbsp;Augustus curtailed the
                powers of legate and proconsul&nbsp;alike. In both cases there was a division of
                authority.&nbsp;By the side of the imperial legate was placed, as the&nbsp;highest
                financial authority, an imperial procurator, while&nbsp;the proconsul, in addition
                to the loss of all military control,&nbsp;was checked by the presence of the
                imperial officer, also&nbsp;styled procurator, to whom the care of the fiscal
                revenues&nbsp;was entrusted ; finally, both legate and proconsul were deprived of
                that right of requisitioning supplies which, in&nbsp;spite of a long series of
                restrictive laws, had been the most&nbsp;powerful instrument of oppression in the
                hands of republican governors. The financial reforms of Augustus@@<sup>1</sup>
                are&nbsp;marked by the same desire to establish an equitable, orderly,&nbsp;and
                economical system, and by the same centralization of&nbsp;authority in the emperor’s
                hands. The institution of an&nbsp;imperial census, or valuation of all land
                throughout&nbsp;the empire, and the assessment upon this basis of a&nbsp;uniform
                land tax, in place of. the heterogeneous and&nbsp;irregular payments made under the
                republic, were the&nbsp;work of Augustus, though the system was developed
                and&nbsp;perfected by the emperors of the 2d century and by&nbsp;Diocletian. The
                land tax itself was directly collected, either&nbsp;by imperial officials or by
                local authorities responsible to&nbsp;them, and the old wasteful plan of selling the
                privilege&nbsp;of collection to publicani was henceforward applied only&nbsp;to such
                indirect taxes as the customs duties. The rate of&nbsp;the land tax was fixed by the
                emperor, and with him rested&nbsp;the power of remission even in senatorial
                    provinces.@@<sup>2</sup> The&nbsp;effect of these reforms is clearly visible in
                the improved&nbsp;financial condition of the empire. Under the republic&nbsp;the
                treasury had been nearly always in difficulties, and&nbsp;the provinces exhausted
                and impoverished. Under the&nbsp;emperors, at least throughout the 1st century, in
                spite of&nbsp;a largely increased expenditure on the army, on public&nbsp;works, on
                shows and largesses, and on the machinery of&nbsp;government itself, the better
                emperors, such as Tiberius and&nbsp;Vespasian, were able to accumulate large sums,
                while the&nbsp;provinces show but few signs of distress. A
                reformed&nbsp;administration and an improved system of taxation were&nbsp;not the
                only boons for which the empire at large had to&nbsp;thank Augustus. While the
                republic had almost entirely&nbsp;neglected to develop the internal resources of the
                provinces, Augustus set the example of a liberal expenditure&nbsp;on public works,
                in the construction of harbours, roads,&nbsp;and bridges, the reclamation of waste
                lands, and the&nbsp;erection of public buildings.@@<sup>3</sup> The crippling
                restrictions&nbsp;which the republic had placed on freedom of intercourse&nbsp;and
                trade, even between the separate districts of a single&nbsp;province, disappeared
                under the empire, and the institution&nbsp;of the provincial councils, as centres of
                provincial unity,&nbsp;is one among many instances of the more liberal policy&nbsp;.
                pursued by the emperors.@@<sup>4</sup> In the eyes of the republican&nbsp;statesmen
                the provinces were merely the estates of the&nbsp;Roman people, but from the reign
                of Augustus dates&nbsp;the gradual disappearance of the old pre-eminence
                of&nbsp;Rome and Italy. It was from the provinces that the</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">legions were increasingly recruited; provincials rose to high rank as
                soldiers, statesmen, and men of letters ;@@<sup>5</sup> the&nbsp;growing Roman
                civilization of the Western provinces&nbsp;and the thriving commerce of the populous
                cities of the&nbsp;East contrasted significantly with the degenerate cosmopolitanism
                of Rome, and with the dwindling population&nbsp;and decaying industry of Italy ;
                while even into Rome&nbsp;and Italy the methods of administration formerly
                distinctive of the provinces found their way. From Augustus&nbsp;himself, jealous as
                he was of the traditions and privileges&nbsp;of the ruling Roman people, date the
                rule of an imperial&nbsp;prefect in the city of Rome, the division of Italy
                into&nbsp;regiones in the provincial fashion, and the permanent&nbsp;quartering
                there of armed troops.@@<sup>6</sup></span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">For a century and Ja half the policy initiated by Augustus secured
                the peace and prosperity of the empire ;&nbsp;of the emperors who ruled during that
                period the majority&nbsp;were able and vigorous administrators, and even the
                follies&nbsp;and excesses of Gaius, Claudius, and Nero did little harm&nbsp;beyond
                the limits of Rome and Italy. The firm rule of&nbsp;Vespasian repaired the damages
                inflicted by the wars of&nbsp;the rival emperors after Nero’s death, and the
                abilities of&nbsp;Trajan, Hadrian, and the Antonines, if they failed to&nbsp;revive
                the flagging energies of the empire, at least secured&nbsp;tranquillity and good
                government. But few additions of&nbsp;importance were made to the territories of
                Rome. Io&nbsp;Britain] the work begun by Cæsar was taken up by&nbsp;Claudius, under
                whom the southern part of the island was&nbsp;Constituteda province; the northern
                districts were subdued&nbsp;by Agricola (78-84 </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.),</span><span class="font1"> and the limits of
                the province&nbsp;northward were finally fixed by the AVall of Hadrian
                (see&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;"
                >Britannia).</span><span class="font1"> The conquest of Dacia by Trajan
                (107)&nbsp;was provoked by the threatening attitude of the barbarian&nbsp;tribes on
                the lower Danube, and, though it remained part&nbsp;of the empire down to 256, its
                exposed position as lying&nbsp;beyond the Danube frontier rendered it always a
                source of&nbsp;weakness rather than strength.@@<sup>7</sup> To Trajan’s reign
                also&nbsp;belongs the annexation of Arabia Petræa. Otherwise on&nbsp;the frontiers
                there was little change. In the north the&nbsp;revolt of Civilis (69-70 </span><span
                class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.)</span><span class="font1"> owed
                its temporary success&nbsp;mainly to the confusion created by the rivalries of
                Otho,&nbsp;Vitellius, and Vespasian.@@<sup>8</sup> The connexion of the
                Rhine&nbsp;with the Danube frontier bj a continuous wall, a work gradually carried
                out under the Flavian and Antonine emperors,&nbsp;was a strategical necessity, and
                involved no general advance&nbsp;of the Roman lines.@@<sup>9</sup> On the Rhine
                itself the peaceful&nbsp;state of affairs is sufficiently proved by the reduction of
                the&nbsp;force stationed there from eight legions to four; and it&nbsp;was only on
                the Danube that there was any pressure&nbsp;severe enough to strain the strength of
                the Roman defence.&nbsp;The presence of Trajau himself was required to quell
                the&nbsp;Dacians under their able king Decebalus, and, though&nbsp;his campaigns
                were followed by sixty years of peace,&nbsp;a force of ten legions was considered
                necessary to&nbsp;guard the Danubian frontier. Far more serious was
                the&nbsp;irruption of the Marcomanni and other tribes in the reign&nbsp;of Marcus
                Aurelius (l62-175.).@@<sup>lθ</sup> The tide of barbaric&nbsp;invasion which then
                swept across the upper Danube and&nbsp;over the provinces of Rhætia, Noricum, and
                Pannonia, till&nbsp;it touched the Alps aud the soil of Italy, was
                indeed&nbsp;driven back after fourteen years of war, but it first&nbsp;revealed to
                the Roman world the strength of the forces</span></p>
