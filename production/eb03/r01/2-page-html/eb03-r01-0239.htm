                conveniency of weeding the plants. In the&nbsp;autumn, when the decayed leaves are
                removed, if the&nbsp;ſhoveling of the alleys are thrown over the crowns of&nbsp;the
                plants, it will be found of ſervice.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">His mode of cultivating the fame plant by offsets is thus given :
                &quot; On taking up ſome plants the laff ſpiing,&nbsp;I flipped off ſeveral offsets
                from the heads of large&nbsp;plants : theſe I ſet with a dibble about a foot apart,
                in&nbsp;order, if I found them thrive, to remove them into other&nbsp;beds. On
                examining them in the autumn, I was ſurpriſed to ſee the progreſs they had made, and
                pleaſed&nbsp;to be able to furniſh my beds with 40 plants in the moſt&nbsp;thriving
                ſtate. Though this was my ſirſt experiment&nbsp;oſ its kind, I do not mean to
                arrogate the difcovery to&nbsp;myſelf, having known it recently tried by others,
                but&nbsp;without being informed of their ſucceſs. I have rea-ſon to think this
                valuable drug will, by this method,&nbsp;be brought much ſooner to perfection than
                from ſeed.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">His method of curing rhubarb is thus deſcribed : &quot; The plants
                may be taken up either early in the ſpring,&nbsp;or in autumn, when the leaves are
                decayed, in dry wea-ther if poſſible, when the roots are to be cleared
                from&nbsp;dirt (without waſhing) : let them be cut into pieces,&nbsp;and with a
                ſharp knife freed from the outer coat, and&nbsp;expoſed to the ſun and air for a few
                days, to render the&nbsp;outſide a little dry. In order to accelerate the
                curing&nbsp;of the largeſt pieces, a hole may be ſcooped out with a&nbsp;penknife :
                thefe and the ſmaller parts are then to be&nbsp;ſtrung on packthread, and hung up in
                a warm room ( I&nbsp;have always had the conveniency of ſuch a one over
                a&nbsp;baker’s oven), where it is to remain till perfectly dry.&nbsp;Each piece may
                be rendered more ſſghtly by a common&nbsp;file, fixing it in a ſmall vice during
                that operation : afterwards rub over it a very ſine powder, which the&nbsp;ſmall
                roots ſurniſh in beautiful perfection, for this and&nbsp;every other purpoſe where
                rhubarb is required.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">In the year 1794, too, the Society adjudged the gold medal to Mr Ball
                for his method of curing the true&nbsp;rhubarb, which is as follows ; &quot; I take
                the roots up&nbsp;when I ſind the ſtalks withering or dying away, clean&nbsp;them
                from the earth with a dry bruſh, cut them in ſmall&nbsp;pieces of about four or ſive
                inches in breadth, and about&nbsp;two in depth, taking away all the bark, and make a
                hole&nbsp;in the middle, and ſtring them on packthread, keeping&nbsp;every piece
                apart ; and every morning, if the weather is&nbsp;clear and fine, I place them in
                the open part of the&nbsp;garden, on ſtages, erected by fixing ſmall poſts
                about&nbsp;ſix feet high in the ground, and ſix feet aſunder, into&nbsp;which I ſix
                horizontal pegs, about a foot apart, beginning at the top ; and the rhubarb being
                ſtringed croſs-wiſe on ſmall poles, I place them on theſe pegs ; ſo that&nbsp;if it
                ſhould rain, I could eaſily remove each pole with&nbsp;the ſufpended pieces, into
                any covered place. I never&nbsp;ſuffer them to be out at night, as the damps at this
                ſea-ſon would be apt to mould them ; and if at any time I&nbsp;perceive the leaſt
                mark of mould, I rub it off with a dry&nbsp;cloth. In ſome of the pieces of rhubarb
                which I have&nbsp;cured this year, I have made holes about half an
                inch&nbsp;diameter in the middle, for the free paſſage of air, and&nbsp;have found
                </span><span class="font1">that every </span><span class="font2">one of theſe pleces

                to&nbsp;dry exceedingly well, and much better than thoſe in&nbsp;the open air. Some
                years ſince I dried a quantity of&nbsp;rhubarb on a malt-kiln, keeping up the
                thermometer to&nbsp;80 degrees, which anſwered well, but I think rather&nbsp;dried
                too quick </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ί</span><span
