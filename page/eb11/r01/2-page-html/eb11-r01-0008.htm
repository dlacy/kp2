<p><span class="font0">and Esmangart, have generally committed the error of tormenting themselves and their author to find individual explanations of&nbsp;personages and events. The extravagance of the last-named&nbsp;commentator takes the form of seeing elaborate allegories; that&nbsp;of some others devotes itself chiefly to identifying the characters&nbsp;of the romance with more or less famous historical persons. But&nbsp;the first blunder, that of forming a general hypothetical conception&nbsp;of Rabelais and then adjusting interpretation of the work to it,&nbsp;is the commoner. This conception, however, has singularly varied.&nbsp;According to some expositors, among whom one of the latest and&nbsp;not the least respectable is M. Fleury, Rabelais is a sober reformer,&nbsp;an apostle of earnest work, of sound education, of rational if not&nbsp;dogmatic religion, who wraps up his morals in a farcical envelope&nbsp;partly to make them go down with the vulgar and partly to shield&nbsp;himself from the consequences of his reforming zeal. According&nbsp;to others, of whom we have had in England a distinguished example&nbsp;in Sir Walter Besant, Rabelais is all this but with a difference. He&nbsp;is not religious at all; he is more or less anti-religious; and his book&nbsp;is more or less of a general protest against any attempt to explain&nbsp;supernaturally the riddle of the earth. According to a third class,&nbsp;the most distinguished recent representative of which was M. Paul&nbsp;Lacroix, the Rabelaisian legend does not so much err in principle&nbsp;as it invents in fact. Rabelais is the incarnation of the “ esprit&nbsp;Gaulois, ” a jovial, careless soul, not destitute of common sense or&nbsp;even acute intellectual power, but first of all a good fellow, rather&nbsp;preferring a broad jest to a fine-pointed one, and rollicking through&nbsp;life like a good-natured undergraduate. Of all these views it may&nbsp;be said that those who hold them are obliged to shut their eyes&nbsp;to many things in the book and to see in it many which are not&nbsp;there. The religious part of the matter will be dealt with presently;&nbsp;but it is impossible to think that any unbiased judge reading&nbsp;Rabelais can hold the grave-philosopher view or the reckless-good-fellow view without modifications and allowances which practically&nbsp;deprive either of any value. Those who, as it has been happily&nbsp;put, identify Rabelais with Pantagruel, strive in vain, on any view&nbsp;intellectually consistent or morally respectable, to account for the&nbsp;vast ocean of pure or impure laughter and foolery which surrounds&nbsp;the few solid islets of sense and reason and devotion. Those who&nbsp;in the same way identify Rabelais with Panurge can never explain&nbsp;the education scheme, the solemn apparition of Gargantua among&nbsp;the farcical and fantastic variations on Panurge's wedding, and many&nbsp;other passages; while, on the other hand, those who insist on a&nbsp;definite propaganda of any kind must justify themselves by their&nbsp;own power of seeing things invisible to plain men. But these&nbsp;vagaries are not only unjustifiable; they are entirely unnecessary.&nbsp;No one reading Rabelais without </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">parti pris,</span><span class="font0"> but with a good knowledge&nbsp; of the history and literature of his own times and the times&nbsp;which preceded him, can have much difficulty in appreciating&nbsp;his book. He had evidently during his long and studious sojourn&nbsp;in the cloister (a sojourn which was certainly not less than five-and-twenty years, while it may have been five-and-thirty, and of which&nbsp;the studiousness rests not on legend but on documentary evidence)&nbsp;acquired a vast stock of learning. He was, it is clear, thoroughly&nbsp;penetrated with the instincts, the hopes, and the ideas of the&nbsp;Renaissance in the form which it took in France, in England and&nbsp;in Germany—a form, that is to say, not merely humanist but full&nbsp;of aspirations for social and political improvement, and above all&nbsp;for a joyous, varied, and non-ascetic life. He had thoroughly&nbsp;convinced himself of the abuses to which monachism lent itself.&nbsp;Lastly, he had the spirit of lively satire and of willingness </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">desipere&nbsp;in loco</span><span class="font0"> which frequently goes with the love of books. It is in the&nbsp;highest degree improbable that in beginning his great work he had&nbsp;any definite purpose or intention. The habit of burlesquing the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">romans d'aventures</span><span class="font0"> was no new one, and the form lent itself easily&nbsp;to the two literary exercises to which he was most disposed—&nbsp;apt and quaint citation from and variation on the classics and&nbsp;satirical criticism of the life he saw around him. The immense&nbsp;popularity of the first two parts induced him to continue them, and&nbsp;by degrees (the genuineness of the fifth book, at any rate in substance,&nbsp;is here assumed) the possibility of giving the whole something&nbsp;like a consistent form and a regular conclusion presented itself to&nbsp;him. The voyage in particular allowed the  widest licence of&nbsp;satirical allusion, and he availed himself of that licence in the widest&nbsp;sense. Here and there persons are glanced at, while the whole&nbsp;scenery of his birthplace and its neighbourhood is curiously worked&nbsp;in; but for the most part the satire is typical rather than individual,&nbsp;and it is on the whole a rather negative satire. In only two points&nbsp;can Rabelais be said to be definitely polemic. He certainly hated&nbsp;the monkish system in the debased form in which it existed in his&nbsp;time; he as certainly hated the brutish ignorance into which the&nbsp;earlier systems of education had suffered too many of their teachers&nbsp;and scholars to drop. At these two things he was never tired of&nbsp;striking, but elsewhere, even in the grim satire of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chats fourres,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">he is the satirist proper rather than the reformer. It is in the&nbsp;very absence of any cramping or limiting purpose that the great&nbsp;merit and value of the book consist. It holds up an almost perfectly level and spotless mirror to the temper of the earlier&nbsp;Renaissance. The author has no universal medicine of his own&nbsp;(except Pantagruelism) to offer, nor has he anybody else's universal&nbsp;medicine to attack. He ranges freely about the world, touching&nbsp;the laughable sides of things with kindly laughter, and every now&nbsp;and then dropping the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">risibile</span><span class="font0"> and taking to the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rationale.</span><span class="font0"> It is&nbsp;not indeed possible to deny that in the Oracle of the Bottle, besides&nbsp;its merely jocular and fantastic sense, there is a certain “ echo, ”&nbsp;as it has been called, “ of the conclusion of the preacher, ” a certain&nbsp;acknowledgment of the vanity of things. But in such a book such&nbsp;a note could hardly be wanting unless the writer had been a fanatic,&nbsp;which he was not, or a mere voluptuary, which he was not, or a&nbsp;dullard, which he was least of all. It is, after all, little more than a&nbsp;suggestion, and is certainly not strengthened by anything in the&nbsp;body of the work. Rabelais is, in short, if he be read without&nbsp;prejudice, a humorist pure and simple, feeling often in earnest,&nbsp;thinking almost always in jest. He is distinguished from the two&nbsp;men who alone can be compared with him in character of work and&nbsp;force of genius combined—Lucian and Swift—by very marked&nbsp;characteristics. He is much less of a mere mocker than Lucian,&nbsp;and he is entirely destitute, even when he deals with monks or&nbsp;pedants, of the ferocity of Swift. He neither sneers nor rages;&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rire immense</span><span class="font0"> which distinguishes him is altogether good-natured;&nbsp;but he is nearer to Lucian than to Swift, and Lucian is perhaps&nbsp;the author whom it is most necessary to know in order to understand him rightly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If this general view is correct it will probably condition to some extent the answer to be given to the two minor questions stated&nbsp;above. The first is connected with the great blemish of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Gargantua&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pantagruel</span><span class="font0">—their extreme coarseness of language and imagery.&nbsp;It is somewhat curious that some of those who claim Rabelais as&nbsp;an enemy of the supernatural in general have been the loudest to&nbsp;condemn this blemish, and that some of them have made the&nbsp;exceedingly lame excuse for him that it was a means of wrapping&nbsp;up his propaganda and keeping it and himself safe from the notice&nbsp;of the powers that were. This is not complimentary to Rabelais,&nbsp;and, except in some very small degree, it is not likely to be true.&nbsp;For as a matter of fact obscenity no less than impiety was charged&nbsp;against him by his ultra-orthodox enemies, and the obscenity no&nbsp;less than the supposed impiety gave them a handle against him&nbsp;before such bodies as the Sorbonne and the parliaments. As for&nbsp;the extreme theory of the anti-Rabelaisians, that Rabelais was a&nbsp;“ dirty old blackguard ” who liked filth and wallowed in it from&nbsp;choice, that hardly needs comment. His errors in this way are of&nbsp;course, looked at from an absolute standard, unpardonable. But&nbsp;judged relatively there are several, we shall not say excuses, but&nbsp;explanations of them. In the first place, the comparative indecency of Rabelais has been much exaggerated by persons&nbsp;unfamiliar with early French literature. The form of his book was&nbsp;above all things popular, and the popular French literature of the&nbsp;middle ages as distinguished from the courtly and literary literature,&nbsp;which was singularly pure, can hardly be exceeded in point of coarseness. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">fabliaux,</span><span class="font0"> the early burlesque romances of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Audigier&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">class, the farces of the 15th century, equal (the grotesque iteration&nbsp;and amplification which is the note of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Gargantua</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pantagruel&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">being allowed for, and sometimes without that allowance) the&nbsp;coarsest passages of Rabelais. His coarseness, moreover, disgusting&nbsp;as it is, has nothing of the corruption of refined vοluρtuousness&nbsp;about it, and nothing of the sniggering indecency which disgraces&nbsp;men like Pope, like Voltaire, and like Sterne. It shows in its author&nbsp;a want of reverence, a want of decency in the proper sense, a too&nbsp;great readiness to condescend to the easiest kind of ludicrous ideas&nbsp;and the kind most acceptable at that time to the common run of&nbsp;mankind. The general taste haying been considerably refined&nbsp;since, Rabelais has in parts become nearly unreadable—the worst&nbsp;and most appropriate punishment for his faults. As for those&nbsp;who have tried to make his indecency an argument for his laxity&nbsp;in religious principle, that argument, like another mentioned&nbsp;previously, hardly needs discussion. It is notoriously false as a&nbsp;matter of experience. Rabelais could not have written as he has&nbsp;written in this respect and in others if he had been an earnestly&nbsp;pious person, taking heed to every act and word, and studious&nbsp;equally not to offend and not to cause offence. But no one in his&nbsp;senses would dream of claiming any such character for him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This brings us to the last point—what his religious opinions were. He has been claimed as a free-thinker of all shades, from&nbsp;undogmatic theism to atheism, and as a concealed Protestant. The&nbsp;last of these claims has now been very generally given up, and&nbsp;indeed Erasmus might quite as reasonably be claimed for the&nbsp;Reformation as Rabelais. Both disliked and attacked the more&nbsp;crying abuses of their church, and both at the time and since have&nbsp;been disliked and attacked by the more imprudent partisans of&nbsp;that church. But Rabelais, in his own way, held off from the&nbsp;Reformation even more distinctly than Erasmus did. The accusation&nbsp;of free-thinking, if not of directly anti-Christian thinking, has always&nbsp;been more common and has recently found much favour. It is,&nbsp;however, remarkable that those who hold this opinion never give&nbsp;chapter and verse for it, and it may be said confidently that chapter&nbsp;and verse cannot be given. The sayings attributed to Rabelais&nbsp;which colour the idea (such as the famous “ Je vais chercher un&nbsp;grand peut-être, ” said to have been uttered on his death-bed)&nbsp;are, as has been said, purely apocryphal. In the book itself nothing</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
