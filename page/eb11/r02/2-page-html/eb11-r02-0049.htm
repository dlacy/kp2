<p><span class="font1">practice of Italian poetry. |Their work is the first absolutely modern work,—modern in the sense of having absorbed the stores&nbsp;of classic learning and reproduced those treasures in forms of simple,&nbsp;natural, native beauty. Boiardo occupies a similar position by&nbsp;the fusion of classic mythology with chivalrous romance in his&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Orlando Innamorato.</span><span class="font1"> But the victor’s laurels were reserved for&nbsp;Ariosto, whose </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Orlando Furioso</span><span class="font1"> is the purest and most perfect&nbsp;extant example of Renaissance poetry. It was not merely in what&nbsp;they had acquired and assimilated from, the classics that these&nbsp;poets showed the transformation effected in the field of literature&nbsp;by humanism. The whole method and spirit of medieval art had&nbsp;been abandoned. That of the Cinque Cento is positive, defined,&nbsp;mundane. The deity, if deity there be, that rules in it, is beauty.&nbsp;Interest is confined to the actions, passions, sufferings and joys&nbsp;of human life, to its pathetic, tragic, humorous and sentimental&nbsp;incidents. Of the state of souls beyond the grave we hear and&nbsp;arc supposed to care nothing. In the drama the pedantry of the&nbsp;Revival, which had not injured romantic literature, made itself&nbsp;perniciously felt. Rules were collected from Horace and Aristotle.&nbsp;Seneca was chosen as the model of tragedy; Plautus and Terence&nbsp;supplied the groundwork of comedy. Thus in the plays of Rucellai,&nbsp;Trissino, Sperone and other tragic poets the nobler elements of&nbsp;humanism, considered as a revelation of the world and man, obtained no free development. Even thc comedies of the best&nbsp;authors are too observant · of Latin precedents, although some&nbsp;pieces of Machiavelli, Ariosto, Aretino, Cecchi and Gelli are admirable&nbsp;for vivid delineation of contemporary manners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The relation of the plastic arts to the revival of learning is.similar to that which has been sketched in the case of poetry. Cimabue&nbsp;started with work which owed nothing directly to antiquity. Atabout the same time Niccola Pisano (d. 1278)&nbsp;studied the style of sculpture in fragments of Graeco-Roman&nbsp;marbles. His manner influenced Giotto, who set painting on a&nbsp;forward path. Fortunately for the unimpeded expansion of Italian&nbsp;art, little was brought to light of antique workmanship during the&nbsp;14th and 15th centuries. The classical stimulus came to painters,&nbsp;sculptors and architects chiefly through literature. Therefore&nbsp;there was narrow scope for imitation, and the right spirit of humanism&nbsp;displayed itself in a passionate study of perspective, nature and&nbsp;the nude. Yet we find in the writings of Ghiberti and Alberti,&nbsp;we notice in the masterpieces of these men and their compeers&nbsp;Brunelleschi and Donatello, how even in the 15th century the minds&nbsp;of artists were fascinated by what survived of classic grace and&nbsp;science. Gradually, as the race became penetrated with antique&nbsp;thought, the earlier Christian motives of the arts yielded to pagan&nbsp;subjects. Gothic architecture, which had always flourished feebly&nbsp;on Italian soil, was supplanted by a hybrid Roman style. The&nbsp;study of Vitruvius gave strong support to that pseudo-classic&nbsp;manner which, when it had reached its final point in Palladio’s&nbsp;work, overspread the whole of Europe and dominated taste during&nbsp;two centuries. But the perfect plastic art of Italy, the pure art&nbsp;of the Cinque Cento, the painting of Raphael, Da Vinci, Titian&nbsp;and Correggio, the sculpture of Donatello, Michelangelo and&nbsp;Sansovino, the architecture of Bramante, Omodeo. and the Venetian&nbsp;Lombardi, however much imbued with the spirit of the classical&nbsp;revival, takes rank beside the poetry of Ariosto as a free intelligent&nbsp;product of the Renaissance. That is to say, it is not so much an&nbsp;outcome of studies in antiquity as an exhibition of emancipated&nbsp;modern genius fired and illuminated by the masterpieces .of the&nbsp;past. It indicates a separation from the middle ages, inasmuch as&nbsp;it is permanently natural. Its religion is joyous, sensuous, dramatic,&nbsp;terrible, but in each and all of its many-sided manifestations&nbsp;strictly human. Its touch on classical mythology is original,&nbsp;rarely imitative or pedantic. The art of the Renaissance was an&nbsp;apocalypse of the beauty of the world and man in unaffected&nbsp;spontaneity, without side thoughts for piety or erudition, inspired</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">by pure delight in loveliness and harmony for their own sakes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the fields of science and philosophy humanism wrought similar important changes. Petrarch began by waging relentless war&nbsp;against the logicians and materialists of his own day.&nbsp;With the advance made in Greek studies scholastic methods&nbsp;of thinking fell into contemptuous oblivion. The newly&nbsp;aroused curiosity for nature encouraged men like Alberti,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Da Vinci, Toscanelli and Da Porta to make practical experiments, penetrate the working of physical forces, and invent scientific&nbsp;instruments. Anatomy began to be studied, and the time was not&nbsp;far distant when Titian should lend his pencil to the epoch-making&nbsp;treatise of Vesalius. The middle ages had been satisfied with&nbsp;absurd and visionary notions about the world around them, while&nbsp;the body of man was regarded with too much suspicion to be&nbsp;studied. Now the right method of interrogating nature with&nbsp;patience and loving admiration was instituted. At the same time&nbsp;the texts of .ancient authors supplied hints which led to discoveries&nbsp;so far-reaching in their results as those of Copernicus, Columbus&nbsp;and Galileo. In philosophy, properly so called, the humanistic&nbsp;scorn for medieval dullness and obscurity swept away theological&nbsp;metaphysics as valueless. But at first little beyond empty rhetoric&nbsp;and clumsy compilation, was substituted. The ethical treatises&nbsp;of the scholars are deficient in substance, while Ficino’s attempt&nbsp;to.revive Platonism betrays an uncritical conception of his master’s&nbsp;drift. It was something, however, to have shaken off the shackles&nbsp;of ecclesiastical authority; and, even if a new authority, that of&nbsp;the ancients, was accepted in its stead, still progress was being&nbsp;made toward sounder methods of analysis. This is noticeable&nbsp;in Pomponazzo’s system of materialism, based on the interpretation of Aristotle, but revealing a virile spirit of disinterested and&nbsp;unprejudiced research. The thinkers of southern Italy, Telesio,&nbsp;Bruno and Camfxinella, at last opened the two chief lines on which&nbsp;modern speculation has since moved. Telesio and Campanella&nbsp;may be termed the predecessors of Bacon. Bruno was the precursor of the idealistic schools. All three alike strove to disengage&nbsp;their minds from classical as well as ecclesiastical authority, proving&nbsp;that the emancipation of the will had been accomplished. It must&nbsp;be added that their writings, like every other product of the Renaissance, except its purest poetry and art, exhibit a hybrid between&nbsp;medievhl and modern tendencies. Childish ineptitudes arc mingled&nbsp;with intuitions of maturest wisdom, and seeds of future thought&nbsp;germinate.in the decaying refuse of.past systems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Humanism, in its earliest stages was uncritical. It absorbed the relics of antiquity with omnivorous appetite, and with very imperfect sense, of the distinction between worse and better&nbsp;work. Yet it led in process of time to criticism. The&nbsp;critique of literature began in the lecture-room of Politian, in the&nbsp;printing-house of Aldus, and in the school of Vittorino. The critique&nbsp;of Roman law started, under Politian’s auspices, upon a more&nbsp;liberal course, than that which had been followed by the powerful&nbsp;but narrow-sighted glossators of Bologna. Finally, in the court of&nbsp;Naples arose that most formidable of all critical engines, the critique&nbsp;of established ecclesiastical traditions and spurious historical documents. Valla by one vigorous effort destroyed the False Decretals&nbsp;and exposed the Donation of Constantine to ridicule, paving the&nbsp;way for the polemic carried on against the dubious pretensions of&nbsp;the. papal throne by scholars of the Reformation. A similar&nbsp;criticism, conducted less on lines of erudition than of persiflage&nbsp;and irony, ransacked the moral abuses of the church and played&nbsp;around the very foundations of Christianity. This was tolerated&nbsp;with approval by men who repeated Leo X.’s witty epigram:&nbsp;“ What profit has not that.fable of Christ brought us !” The same&nbsp;critical and philosophic spirit working on the materials of history&nbsp;produced a new science, the honours of which belong to Machia-velli. He showed, on the one side, how the history of a people&nbsp;can be written with a recognition of fixed principles, and at the same&nbsp;time with an artistic feeling for personal and dramatic episodes.&nbsp;On the other side, he addressed himself to the analysis of man&nbsp;considered as a political being, to the anatomy of constitutions&nbsp;and the classification of governments, to the study of motives&nbsp;underlying public action, the secrets of success and the causes of&nbsp;failure in the.conduct of affairs. The unscrupulous rigour with&nbsp;which he applied his scientific method, and the sinister deductions&nbsp;he thought himself justified in drawing from the results it yielded,&nbsp;excited terror and repulsion. Nevertheless, a department had&nbsp;been added to the intellectual empire of mankind, in which fellow-workers, like Guicciardini at Florence, and subsequently&nbsp;Sarpi at Venice, were not slow to follow the path traced by&nbsp;Machiavelli.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The object.of the foregoing paragraphs has been, to show in what way the positive, inquisitive, secular, exploratory spirit of the Renaissance, when toned and controlled by humanism, penetrated&nbsp;the regions of literature, art, philosophy and science. It&nbsp;becomes at this point of much moment to consider how&nbsp;social manners in Italy were modified by the same causes, since the&nbsp;type developed there was in large measure communicated together&nbsp;with the new culture to the rest of Europe. The first subject to&nbsp;be noticed under this heading is education. What has come to be&nbsp;called a classical education was the immediate product of the Italian&nbsp;Renaissance. The universities of Bologna, Padua and Salerno had&nbsp;been famous through th$ middle ages for the study of law, physics&nbsp;and medicine; and during the 15th and 16th centuries the first&nbsp;two still enjoyed celebrity in these faculties. But at this period&nbsp;no lecture-rooms were so crowded as those in which professors of&nbsp;antique literature and language read passages from the poets and&nbsp;orators, taught Greek, and commented upon the systems of philosophers. The medieval curriculum offered no defined place, for&nbsp;the new learning of the Revival, which had indeed no recognized&nbsp;name. Chairs had therefore to be founded under the title of rhetoric, from which men like Chrysoloras and Guarino, Filelfo and Poli-tian expounded orally to hundreds of eager, students from every&nbsp;town of ltaly and every nation in Europe their accumulated know-Iedge of antiquity. One mass of Greek and. Roman erudition,&nbsp;including history and metaphysics, law and science, civic institutions and the art of war, mythology and magistracies, metrical&nbsp;systems and oratory, agriculture and astronomy, domestic manners&nbsp;and religious rites, grammar and philology, biography and numismatics, formed the miscellaneous subject-matter of this so-styled&nbsp;rhetoric. Notes taken at these lectures supplied young scholars&nbsp;with hints for further exploration ; and a certain tradition of treating antique authors for the display of general learning, as well as&nbsp;for the elucidation </span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font1">their texts, came into vogue, which has</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
