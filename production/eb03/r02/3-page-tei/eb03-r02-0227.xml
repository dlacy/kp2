Nothing can exceed the indignities, as well as the cruelties, which were practiſed upon this unhappy monarch, thus fallen into the hands of his enemies. Sapor, we are told, always uſed him as a footſtool ſor mounting his horſe ; he added the bitterneſs of ridicule to his inſults, and uſually obſerved, That an attitude like that to which Valerian was reduced, was the beſt ſtatue that could be erected in honour of his victory. This horrid liſe of inſult and ſufferance continued for ſeven years, and was at length terminated by the cruel Perſian’s commanding his priſoner’s eyes to be plucked out, and afterwards cauſing him to be ſtead alive.</p><p>The news of the defeat of the Roman army by the Perſians, and the captivity of Valerian, no ſooner reached the barbarous nations at war with Rome, than they poured on all ſides into the Roman territories in incredible multitudes, threatening the empire, and Rome itſelf, with utter deſtruction. The Goths and Scythians ravaged Pontus and Aſia, committing every where dreadful devaſtations ; the Alemanni and Franks having over-run Rhætia, advanced as far as Ravenna; putting all to fire and ſword ; the Quadi and Sarmatians ſeized on great part of Dacia and Pannonia ; while other barbarous nations, invading Spain, made themſelves maſters of Tarraco and other important places in that province. In the mean time Gallienus, the ſon of Valerian, having promiſed to revenge his father’s captivity, and repreſs the barbarians, was choſen emperor without any oppoſition. He was at that time in Gaul ; but haſtened into Italy, from whence he drove out the barbarians, either by the terror of his approach, or by overcoming them in battle.— In Dacia and Pannonia, alſo, the barbarians were driven back by Regillianus, who commanded there, and who is ſaid to have gained ſeveral victories in one day.</p><p>But in the mean time, one Ingenuus, a man of great reputation in war, and univerſally beloved both by the people and ſoldiery, cauſed himſelf to be proclaimed emperor in Pannonia, where he was generally acknowledged as well as in Mæſia. Gallienus no ſooner heard of his revolt, than he marched from the neighbourhood of Ravenna, where he then was, into Illyricum, engaged Ingenuus, and put him to flight. Some authors tell us, that Ingenuus was killed after the battle by his own ſoldiers ; while others affirm, that he put an end to his own life to avoid falling into the hands of Gallienus, who uſed his victory with a cruelty hardly to be parallelled. The following letter to Verianus Celer, one of his officers, will ſhow the diſpoſition of this emperor ; “ I ſhall not be ſatisfied (ſays he) with your putting to death only ſuch as have borne arms againſt me, and might have fallen in the field : you muſt in every city deſtroy all the males, old and young ; ſpare none who have wiſhed ill to me ; none who have ſpoken ill of me the ſon of Valerian, the father and brother of princes. Ingenuus emperor 1. Tear, kill, cut in pieces without mercy : you underſtand me ; do then as you know I would do, who have written to you with my own hand.” In conſequence of theſe cruel orders, a moſt dreadful havock was made among that unhappy people ; .and, in ſeveral cities, not one male child was left alive. The troops who had formerly ſerved under Ingenuus, and the inhabitants of Mæſia who had eſcaped the general</p><lb/><p>ſlaughter, provoked by theſe cruelties, proclaimed Re* gillianus emperor. He was a Dacian by birth, deſeended, as was ſaid, ſrom the celebrated king Decebalus whom Trajan had conquered ; and had, by ſeveral gallant actions, gained reputation in the Roman armies. After he was proclaimed emperor, he gained great advantages over the Sarmatians ; but was ſoon after, murdered by his own ſoldiers. Theſe revolts were quickly followed by many others. Indeed it is not ſurpriſing, at a time when the reins of government were held with ſo looſe an hand, that a crowd of uſurpers ſhould ſtart up in every province of the empire. The great number of uſurpers who pretended to the empire about this time have been diſtinguiſhed by the name of the <hi rend="italic">thirty tyrants.</hi>  However, there were only 19 ; viz. Cyriades, Macrianus, Baliſta, Udenatus, and Zenobia in the eaſt : in Gaul, and the weſtern provinces, Poſt-humus, Lollianns, Victorinus and his mother Victoria, Marius, and Tetricus ; in Illyricum, and on the confines of the Danube, Ingenuus, Regillianus, and Au-reolus ; in Pontus, Saturninus ; in Iſſuria, Trebellianus ; in Theſſaly, Piſo ; in Achaia, Valens ; in. Egypt, -Æmilianus ; and in Africa, Celſus. Several of theſe pretenders to the empire, however, though branded with the opprobrious appellation of tyrants, were eminent examples of virtue, and almoſt all of them were poſſeſſed of a conſiderable ſhare of vigour and ability. The principal reaſon aſſigned for their revolt was, the infamous character of Gallienus, whom neither officers nor ſoldiers could bear to ſerve. Many of them, how« ever, were forced by the ſoldiers to affirme the imperial dignity much againſt their will. “ You have loſt,” ſaid Saturninus to his ſoldiers when they inveſted him with the purple, “ a very uſeſui commander, and have made a very wretched emperor.” The apprehenſions of Saturninus were juſtified by the event. Of the 19 uſurpers already mentioned, not one died a natural death ; and in Italy and Rome Gallienus alone continued to be acknowledged emperor. That prince indeed honoured Odenatus prince of Palmyra with the title of <hi rend="italic">Augujlus<hi rend="sub">y </hi></hi>who continued to poſſeſs an independent ſovereignty in the eaſt all his liſetime, and on his death tranſmitted it to his wife Zenobia. See Palmyra/</p><p>The conſequences of theſe numerous uſurpations were the moſt fatal that can be conceived. The elections of theſe precarious emperors, their life and death, were equally deſtructive to their ſubjects and adherents. The price of their elevation was inſtantly paid to the troops by an immenſe donative drawn from the exhauſted people. However virtuous their character, and however pure their intentions might be, they found themſelves reduced to the neceſſity of ſupporting their uſurpation by frequent acts of rapine and cruelty. When they fell, they involved armies and provinces in their fall, as appears from the letter of Gallienus ah ready quoted. Whilſt-the forces of the ſtate were diſperſed in private quarrels, the defenceleſs provinces lay expoſed· to every invader. The braveſt uſurpers were compelled, by the perplexity of their ſituation, to conclude diſhonourable treaties with the barbarians, and even to ſubmit to ſhameful tributes, and - introduce ſuch numbers of barbarians into the Roman ſervice as ſeemed ſufficient at once to overthrow the empire.</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
