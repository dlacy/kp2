<p><span class="font2">would be shattered to pieces by a wedge; moreover, distinct tool-marks can be seen on all the blocks whose surface is well preserved and in the quarries themselves. Chisels from one-fourth to&nbsp;three-fourths of an inch in width were used, and also a sharp-pointed&nbsp;pick or hammer. The wall is about io ft. thick at the bottom, and&nbsp;increases in thickness above as the scarped cliff against which it is&nbsp;built recedes. It is built of blocks laid in alternate courses of headers&nbsp;and stretchers, varying in thickness from 22 to 24 in., in length&nbsp;from 3 to 5 ft. and in width from 19 to 22 in. These blocks are&nbsp;carefully worked on their beds, but the face is left rough, and the&nbsp;vertical joints are in some cases open, spaces of nearly 2 in. being&nbsp;left between block and block; in other cases the vertical joints&nbsp;are worked true and close like the beds. No mortar was used. At&nbsp;two points on the side of the Velabrum winding passages are&nbsp;excavated in the tufa cliff, the entrance to which was once closed&nbsp;by the ancient wall. One of these in early times (before water in&nbsp;abundance was brought to the Palatine on aqueducts) was used as&nbsp;a reservoir to collect surface w’ater, probably for use in case of siege;&nbsp;circular shafts for buckets are cut downwards through the rock from&nbsp;the top of the hill. A similar rock-cut cistern with vertical shafts,&nbsp;of very early date, exists at Alba Longa. Opposite the church of&nbsp;S. Teodoro a series of buttresses belonging to the early wall exists,&nbsp;partly concealed by a long line of buildings of the later years of the&nbsp;Republic and the early Empire, to make room for which the greater&nbsp;part, of the then useless wall was pulled down, and only fragments&nbsp;left here and there, where they could be worked into the walls of&nbsp;the later houses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The age of the walls here described cannot be determined with certainty, but their resemblance to the remains of the “ Servian ”&nbsp;wall, especially in the system of “ headers and stretchers ” and the&nbsp;dimensions of the blocks, makes it certain that they do not differ&nbsp;greatly in date from that w’urk. The chief technical difference lies&nbsp;in the open vertical joints found in some cases; but too much stress&nbsp;should not be laid on this feature. There arc, however at the&nbsp;western angle of the hill some remains of an earlier fortification,&nbsp;constructed with blocks of grey-green tufa, smaller in size than those&nbsp;of the main wall. A few courses have been preserved, owing to the&nbsp;fact that at the angle of the hill this wall was encased first of all by&nbsp;that described above and afterwards by concrete substructures of&nbsp;imperial date. The technique is primitive, as the blocks are of&nbsp;irregular size and are not laid in courses of “ headers and stretchers ”;&nbsp;the nearest parallel is supplied by the foundations of the temple of&nbsp;Jupiter Capitolinus. These remains are shown by Delbrück, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Der&nbsp;Apollotempel auf dem Marsfelde,</span><span class="font2"> pl. iii., cf. p. 13 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Pliny </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(II. N.</span><span class="font2"> iii. 66) tells us that the city of Romulus had three gates (cf. Serv.Xd. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Aen.</span><span class="font2"> i. 222); and three approaches to the&nbsp;Palatine city can be traced. One is the so-called Scalae&nbsp;Caci, a long sloping ascent cut through the rock (see&nbsp;fig. 17) from the side of the Circus Maximus; some&nbsp;remains of the early wall still exist along the sides of this&nbsp;steep ascent or staircase. The upper part of this has remains of a&nbsp;basalt pavement, added in later times, probably covering the more&nbsp;ancient rock-cut steps. The name of the gate which led at this&nbsp;point into the Palatine city is unknown. The only two gates whose&nbsp;name and position can be (with any degree of probability) identified&nbsp;are the Porta Romanula and the Porta Mugonia. The former of&nbsp;these is called Porta Romana by Festus (ed. Mülfer, p. 262), who&nbsp;states that it was at the foot of the Clivus Victoriae (see fig. 17)&nbsp;and was so called by the Sabines of the Capitol because it was their&nbsp;natural entrance to Roma Quadrata (see also Varro, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">L.L.</span><span class="font2"> v. 164&nbsp;(who only mentions the tw’o gates named above), vi. 24). It would&nbsp;thus have been at the foot of the hill in the Velabrum (see below,&nbsp;p. 600); but Varro says that it was approached by steps from the&nbsp;Nova Via,<sup>@@1 </sup>which would place it at the N. angle of the Palatine. The&nbsp;stairs connecting the Nova Via with the Clivus Victoriae still exist.&nbsp;Doubtful traces of the Porta Mugonia (see Sol. i. 24) have been&nbsp;discovered where a basalt paved road leads up into the Palatine from&nbsp;the Summa Sacra Via and the Summa Nova Via, which join near the&nbsp;arch of Titus; exposure to weather has now destroyed the soft tufa&nbsp;blocks of which this gate was built. This is probably the “ vet us&nbsp;porta Palatii ” of Livy (i. 12), through which the Romans fled when</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">defeated by the Sabines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Palatine settlement was the nucleus around which, by a series of expansions, the historical city of Rome grew up. The first step&nbsp;was the amalgamation of Roma Quadrat a with the villages&nbsp;on the neighbouring spurs of the Esquiline and Caelian.&nbsp;This gave birth to the community of the Seven Hills, whose&nbsp;existence is proved by the survival of the festival known as&nbsp;the Septimontium, celebrated on.the nth of December (Fest. 340;&nbsp;Macrob. i. 16, 6). The seven hills were not those familiar in later&nbsp;nomenclature, but the following:—(1) Palatium and (2) Cermalus,&nbsp;the two summits of the Palatine; (3) Velia, the saddle between&nbsp;the Palatine and Esquiline; (4). Oppius and (5) Cispius, the two&nbsp;westernmost spurs of the Esquiline, together with (6) Fagutal, the&nbsp;extreme crest of the Oppius; (7) Sucusa (confused by later writers&nbsp;with Subura), the eastern spur of the Caelian. Varro </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(L.L.</span><span class="font2"> v. 48)&nbsp;mentions the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">murus terreus Carinarum,</span><span class="font2"> which may have belonged</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2">to the defences of this community, since the N.W. slope of the Oppius bore the name Carinae; but there is no proof that the&nbsp;Septimontium was a walled city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The next stage in the development of Rome was marked by the division of the city into four regions, ascribed by tradition to&nbsp;Servius Tullius,<sup>@@2</sup> who was said to have formed the four city tribes,&nbsp;corresponding with the regions: (1) Suburana, including the&nbsp;Caelian and the valley between that hill and the Esquiline;&nbsp;(2) Esquilina, the Oppius and Cispius; (3) Collina, the Quirinal&nbsp;and Viminal; (4) Palatina, including the Palatine and Velia. The&nbsp;third region was an addition to the City of the Seven Hills; the new&nbsp;city was, in fact, formed by the union of the old Latin settlement with&nbsp;a Sabine community on the Quirinal. The Capitol was the citadel,&nbsp;but was not included in the city (hence the phrase </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">urbs et</span><span class="font2"> Capitolium).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Tradition likewise assigned to Servius Tullius<sup>@@3</sup> the construction of the great wall which embraced not merely the four regions but&nbsp;a considerably extended area, including the Aventine.&nbsp;Excavations have done much to determine the line of the&nbsp;Servian wall, especially the great works undertaken inlaying&nbsp;out a new quarter of the city on the Quirinal, Esquiline ana&nbsp;Viminal, wdiich have laid bare and then mostly destroyed long lines&nbsp;of wall, especially along the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">agger.</span><span class="font2"> Beginning frorfi the Tiber,&nbsp;which the Servian wall touched at a point near the present Ponte&nbsp;Rotto, and separating the Forum Holitorium (outside) from the&nbsp;Forum Boarium (inside), it ran in a straight line to the Capitoline&nbsp;hill, the two crests of which, the Capitolium and the Arx, with the&nbsp;intermediate valley the Asylum, were surrounded by an earlier&nbsp;fortification, set (Dionys, ix. 68) </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">M</span><span class="font2"> Xxtyoir . . . «I rlrpau&nbsp;In this space there were two gates, the Porta Flu men tana, next the&nbsp;river (see Cic. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ad Att.</span><span class="font2"> vii. Liv. xxxv. 19, 21); and the Porta&nbsp;Carmentalis close to the Capitolium.<sup>@@4</sup> From the Capitolinc hill the&nbsp;wall passed to the Quirinal along a spur of elevated ground, afterwards completely cut away by Trajan. Close to the Capitol was the&nbsp;Porta Fontinalis, whence issued the Via Lata. Remains of the w'all&nbsp;and foundations of the gate exist in Via di Marforio. After passing&nbsp;Trajan’s forum, we find remains of the walls ©n the slope of the&nbsp;Quirinal. A piece of the wall has been exposed in the new Via&nbsp;Nazionale, and also an archway under the Palazzo Antonelli, which&nbsp;may represent the Porta Sanqualis (see Festus, ed. Müller, p. 343).&nbsp;The Porta Salutaris (Festus, pp. 326-327) was also on the Quirinal,&nbsp;probably on the slope between the Trevi fountain and the royal&nbsp;palace. Its position is indicated by the existence of some tombs&nbsp;which give the line of the road. On the north-w’est of the Quirinal&nbsp;was the Porta Quirinalis (Festus, p. 254), probably near the&nbsp;“ Quattro Fontane.” In the Barberini palace gardens, and especially in those of the Villa Barberini (Horti Sallustiani), extensive&nbsp;remains of the wall have been recently exposed and destroyed,—&nbsp;which was also the fate of that fine piece of wall that passed under the&nbsp;new office of finance, with the Porta Collina, which was not on the&nbsp;line of the present road, but about 50 yds. to the south (see Dionys,&nbsp;ix. 68; Strabo iv. p. 234). Thus far in its course from the Capitol&nbsp;the wall skirted the slopes of hills, which were once much more&nbsp;abrupt than, they are now; but from the Porta Collina to the&nbsp;Porta Esquilina it crossed a large tract of level ground; and here&nbsp;its place was taken by the great </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">agger</span><span class="font2"> described below. About the&nbsp;middle of it the Porta Viminalis was found in 1872; it stood, as&nbsp;Strabo (iv. p. 234) says, </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">utt6</span><span class="font2"> pecrep r&lt;p xebpan, and from it led a road&nbsp;which passed through the Porta Chiusa (ancient name unknown)&nbsp;in Aurelian’s walk Foundations of the Porta Esquilina were found&nbsp;in 1875 close behind the arch of Gallienus. . The further course of&nbsp;the wall across the valley of the Colosseum is the least known part&nbsp;of the circuit. Hence the wall skirts the slopes of the Caelian&nbsp;(where, as is probable, it was pierced by the Porta Caelemontana and&nbsp;Porta Querquetulana) to the valley along which the Via Appia&nbsp;passed through the Porta Capena, near the church of S. Gregorio.&nbsp;Its line along the Aventine is fairly distinct, and near S. Balbina&nbsp;and in the Vigna Torlonia are two of the best-preserved pieces (see&nbsp;below). There were three, gates on the Aventine,—the Porta&nbsp;Naevia.on the southern height, P. Raudusculana in the central&nbsp;depression, and P. Lavernalis on the northern summit. Under the&nbsp;Aventine it appears to have touched the river near the existing&nbsp;foundations supposed to be those of the Pons Sublicius. The Porta&nbsp;Trigemina was close by the bank. He.nce to our starting-point the&nbsp;river formed, the defence of the city, with its massive quay wall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The wall is built of blocks of tufa, usually the softer kinds, but varying according to its position, as in most cases the </span><span class="font1">stone used&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">was that quarried on the spot. In restorations a. good&nbsp;deal of peperino is used. The blocks average from’23 to&nbsp;24 in. in thickness—roughly 2 Roman feet—and are&nbsp;laid in alternate courses of headers and stretchers. The method&nbsp;of construction varied according to the nature of the ground</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
