This was immediately put in execution. A general ſlaughter commenced, which laſted five days, and during which the greateſt: part of the obnoxious ſenators were cut off, their heads Ruck upon poles over-againſt the roſtra, and their bodies dragged with hooks into the forum, where they were left to be devoured by dogs. Sylla’s houſe was demoliſhed, his goods con ſeated, and he himſelf declared an enemy to his country ; however,, his wife and children had the good fortune to make their eſcape.— This maſſacre was not confined to the city of Rome. The ſoldiers, like as many blood-hounds, were diſperſed over the country in ſearch of thoſe who fled. The neighbouring towns, villages, and all the highways, ſwarmed with aſſaſſins ; and on this occaſion Plutarch obſerves with great concern, that the moſt ſacred ties of friendſhip and hoſpitality are not proof againſt treachery, in the day of adverſity, for there were but very few who did not diſcover their friends who had fled to them for ſhelter.</p><p>This ſlaughter being over, Cinna named himſelf and Marius conſuls for the enſuing year ; and theſe tyrants ſeemed reſolved to begin the new year as they had ended the old one : but, while they were preparing to renew their cruelties, Sylla, having proved victorious in the eaſt, ſent a long letter to the ſenate, giving an account of bis many victories, and his reſolution of returning to Rome, not to reſtore peace to his country, but to revenge himſelf of his enemies, <hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi>  to deſtroy thoſe whom Marius had ſpared. This letter occaſioned an univerſal terror. Marius, dreading to enter the lifts with ſuch a renowned warrior, gave himſelf up to exceſſive drinking, and died. His ſon was aſſociated with Cinna in the government, though not in the conſulinip, and proved a tyrant no leſs cruel than his father. Thc ſenate declared one Valerius Flaccus general of the forces in the eaſt, and appointed him a conſiderable army ; but the troops alt to a man deſerted him, and joined Sylla. Soon after, Cinna declared himſelf conſul a third time, and took for his colleague Papirius Carbo ; but the citizens, dreading the tyranny of theſe inhuman monſters, fled in crowds to Sylla, who was now in Greece. To him the ſenate ſent deputies, begging that he would have compaſſion on his country, and not carry his reſentment to ſuch a length as to begin a civil war : but he replied, that he was coming to Rome full of rage and revenge ; 'and that all his enemies, if the Roman people conſented to it, ſhould periſh either by the ſword or the axes of the executioners. Upon this ſeveral very numerous armies were formed againſt him ; but, through the miſconduct of the generals who commanded them, theſe armies were everywhere dé-feated, or went over to the enemy. Pompey, afterwards ſtyled <hi rend="italic">the Great,</hi>  ſignalized<hi rend="sup">,</hi>  himſelf in this war, and embraced the party of Sylla. The Italian nations took ſome one ſide and ſome another, as their different inclinations led them. Cinna, in the mean time, was killed in a tumult, and young Marius and Carbo ſucceeded him ; but the former having ventured an engagement with Sylla, was by him defeated, and forcedto fly to Præneite, where he was cloſely beſieged..</p><p>Thus was Rome reduced to the loweſt degree of miſery, when one Pontius Teleſinus, a Samnite of great experience in war, projected the total ruin of the 'city. He had joined, or pretended to join, the generals of the Marian faction with an army of 40,000 men ; and therefore marched towards Praeneſte, as if he deſigned to relieve Marius. By th13 means he drew Sylla and Pompey away from the capital ; and then, decamping in the night, over reached theſe two generals, and by break of day was within 10 furlongs of the Collatine gate. He then pulled off the maik ; and declaring himſelf as much an enemy to Marius as to Sylla, told his troops, that it was not bis deſign to aſſiſt one Roman againſt another, but to deſtroy the whole race, <hi rend="sup">u</hi> Let fire and ſword (ſaid he) deſtroy all ; let no quarter be given ; mankind can never be free as long as one Roman is left alive.”—Never had this proud metropolis been in greater danger ; nor ever had any city a more narrow eſcape. The Roman youth marched out to oppoſe him, but were driven back with great ſlaughter. Sylla himſelf was defeated, and forced to fly to his camp. Teleſinus advanced with more fury than ever ; but, in the mean time, the other wing of his army having been defeated by M. Craſſus, the victorious general attacked the body where Teleſinus commanded, and by putting· them to flight, ſaved his country from the moſt imminent danger.</p><p>Sylla, having now no enemy to fear, marched firſt to Atemnæ, and thence to Rome. From the former •city he carried 8000 priſoners to Rome, and cauſed them all to be maſſacred at once in the circus. His cruelty next fell upon the Prasneſtines, 12,oco of whom were maſſacred without mercy. Young Marius had killed himſelf, in order to avoid falling into the hands of ſuch a cruel enemy. Soon after, the inhabitants of Norba, a city of Campania, finding themſelves unable to reſiſt the forces of the tyrant, ſet fire to their houſes» and all periſhed in the flames. The taking of theſe cities put an end to the civil war, but not to the cruelties ol Sylla. Having aſſembled the people in the co-mitium, he told the·/, that he was reſolved not to ſpare a ſingle perſon who had borne arms againſt him. This cruel reſolution he put in execution with the moſt unrelenting vigour ; and having at laſt cut off all thoſe who n he thought capable of oppoſing him, Sylla cauſed hin ſelf to be declared perpetual dictator, or, in other words, king and abſolute ſovereign of Rome.</p><p>This revolution happened about 80 B. C. and from this time we may date the loſs of the Ro nan liberty. Sylla indeed reſigned his power in two years ; but the citizens of Rone having once ſubmitted, were ever after n ore inclined to ſubmit to a maſter. Though individuals retained the ſame enthuſiaſtic notions of liberty as before, yet the minds of the generality ſeem fro n this time to have inclined towards monarchy«, New maſters were indeed already prepared for the republic. Cæſar and Fompey had eminently diſtinguiſhed the Helves by their martial exploits, and were already rivals. They were, however, for ſo e ti ne prevented froτι raiſing any diſturbances by being kept at a diſtance ſrom each other. Sertorius, one of the generals of the Marian faction, and the only one of them poſſeſſed either of honour or probity, had retired</p><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
