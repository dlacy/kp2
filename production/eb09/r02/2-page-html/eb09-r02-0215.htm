<p><span class="font1">At the end of the 16th century a manuscript of this version was in the possession of the dukes of Aveiro at Lisbon, but since the middle of the 18th century all&nbsp;traces of it have been lost. There is, however, reason to&nbsp;believe that the earliest form of the story was in Castilian&nbsp;(c. 1250 ?), also entirely lost. In a moral poem, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">El Rimado&nbsp;de Pαlario,</span><span class="font1"> written about 1400, we find Pedro Lopez de&nbsp;Ayala speaking of having wasted his youth with</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ Libros de desvaneos e mentiras probadas Amadis e LαnzaroteC</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">which is sufficient to prove that </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Amadis</span><span class="font1"> existed about the period 1350-60. There is also a reference to Galaor,&nbsp;brother of Amadis, in the chronicle of Ramon Muntaner&nbsp;(1325-28), as well as to Tristan, Lancelot, and “other&nbsp;knights of the Round Table.” There are several allusions&nbsp;in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cancionero</span><span class="font1"> of Baena (1440-50) to an ancient version,&nbsp;one especially to its being “ en très lybros.” The earliest&nbsp;form is likely to have been in verse. The author was&nbsp;well acquainted with the Arthurian legends, and we find&nbsp;a marked imitation of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tristan</span><span class="font1"> and especially </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lancelot.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">Many of the names indicate a Celtic origin : Gaula certainly means Wales and not France, as they who insist&nbsp;upon a French original of the romance would lead us to&nbsp;believe. There still remains much that is entirely novel.&nbsp;In the words of M. Baret, to whom the literary history of&nbsp;this romance owes so much—</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“Si, par la tradition primitive, l'Amadis de Gaule dérive de la source commune des romans de la Table Ronde, si même il a existé&nbsp;une version Portugaise, c’est néanmoins à l’Espagne que doit demeurer l’honneur d’avoir créé, sur un thème ancien, une composition originale, en introduisant dans un cadre emprunté la nuance&nbsp;particulière de sentiments et l’art nouveau qui donnent à notre&nbsp;roman son importance et sa valeur spéciales ” (De l' Amadis, p. 21).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Of the primitive </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Amadis,</span><span class="font1"> probably in three books, which charmed the youth of Ayala nothing is known.&nbsp;The prose romance we now possess was written about&nbsp;1465 by Garci-Ordonez de Montalvo, governor of Medina&nbsp;del Campo, to whom we may assign all traces of a spirit&nbsp;later than the first years of the 14th century, and to whom&nbsp;the whole of the fourth book may be due. This book is&nbsp;more refined and more romantic than the others. One of&nbsp;the chief reasons of the popularity of this version is the&nbsp;happy manner in which the improvement in manners- is&nbsp;indicated. For the first time in chivalric romances we&nbsp;find distinct traces of the personality of the writer. The&nbsp;tastes, feelings, and prejudices of Spain towards the end&nbsp;of the 15th century are well expressed, without loss of the&nbsp;high chivalry of an earlier and simple time. It was first&nbsp;printed at Saragossa in 1508.</span><span class="font0">@@<sup>1</sup></span><span class="font1"> Within the next fifty&nbsp;years thirteen or fourteen more editions issued from the&nbsp;press, and Amadis became fully established as the popular&nbsp;hero of Spanish romance. When the Spaniards first saw&nbsp;Mexico in 1519 they were reminded of the enchantments&nbsp;of the story.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Francis I. made acquaintance with the Amadis during his Spanish captivity and directed Nicolas de Herberay, seigneur of Essarts,&nbsp;a gentleman of Picardy, to translate it. The first four books of&nbsp;the original work were first printed in French in 1540. De Herberay also translated most of the continuations down to the ninth&nbsp;book. He died about 1552, and Boileau, Gohorry, and others continued the work. Estienne Pasquier, in his Recherches de la France&nbsp;(1611), alludes to the popularity of the French Amadis, “dans&nbsp;lequel vous pouvez cueillir toutes les belles fleurs de nostre langue&nbsp;Françoyse. Jamais livre ne feut embrassé avec tant de faveur que&nbsp;cestuy. ” De Herberay gives as his reason for the translation, “pour&nbsp;ce qu’il est tout certain qu’il fust premier mis en nostre langue&nbsp;Françoyse, estant Amadis Gaulois et non Espagnol. Et qu’ainsi&nbsp;soit, j’en ai trouvé encores quelque reste d’un vieil livre escrit à la&nbsp;main en langage Picard.” This contention, which cannot seriously</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">be held, was insisted upon by M. de Tressan in his abridgment of the Amadis de Cattle (1779), wherein a French origin for the first&nbsp;three books is claimed upon the authority of certain MSS. in that&nbsp;language. The commencement of an Italian translation of the&nbsp;Amadis romances was printed at Venice in 1546, and the stories&nbsp;became equally popular in that language. Bernardo Tasso, while&nbsp;on a mission to Spain about 1535, read the Amadis with delight&nbsp;and afterwards based upon it his poem of Amadigi di Francia&nbsp;(1560). He preferred the Amadis to all the French romances, not&nbsp;even excepting Lancelot. Living at that time, his evidence is extremely valuable. He does not seem to have heard of Lobeira’s&nbsp;version nor yet of the French and Portuguese pretensions. In his&nbsp;opinion the story was taken from some ancient British history.&nbsp;The romance was translated into German in 1569 and into Dutch&nbsp;in 1619. Graesse (Trésor, vii. p. 30) describes a Hebrew translation&nbsp;of the first four books by Jacob ben Moses Algabbai, printed at&nbsp;Constantinople by Eliezer ben Gerson Soncini, without date. The&nbsp;Amadis was first read in English through a version from the French&nbsp;by Anthony Munday (1592). Robert Southey’s Amadis of Gaul&nbsp;(London, 1803, 4 vols. sm. 8vo) is an excellent translation, in&nbsp;which, however, there are constant signs of editorial pruning.&nbsp;W. S. Rose put the romance into verse from De Herberay’s French&nbsp;text (London, 1803, sm. 8vo). Besides the Amadigi of Tasso,&nbsp;the romance gave rise to Amadis, a drama by Gil Vicente (1521),&nbsp;the Portuguese Plautus, to an opera by Lulli, represented at the&nbsp;Académie Royale de Musique at Paris (1684), to a poem by Wieland&nbsp;(1771), the forerunner of his Oberon, and to another by Creuzé de&nbsp;Lesser (1813). The translation of De Herberay had an extraordinary success. It penetrated even to the convents. The Huguenot La Noue and the Catholic Possevino protested against it in&nbsp;vain. The allusions to the Amadis and its continuations are endless ; for instance,—“La gloire de Nicquée,” used for the bracket&nbsp;seat of a coach ; the proverbial saying <sup>,</sup> ‘ envoyer chez Guillot le&nbsp;songeur”; “Dariolette,” the name for a confidant; “Urgande la&nbsp;desconnue,” a phrase with Scarron and La Fontaine; and many&nbsp;more. The romance even furnished Christian names to some&nbsp;noble families, as to the lovely Corisande, countess of Guiche.&nbsp;The festal pageantries in vogue at the court of Charles V. were&nbsp;imitated from it. A poetical title of Queen Elizabeth was “the&nbsp;fair Oriana.” Burton refers to the reading of the romance in his&nbsp;Anatomy of Melancholy (1621).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The period of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Los Quatro Libros del Cavallero Amadis de Gaula</span><span class="font1"> is supposed to be earlier than that of Arthur or of&nbsp;Charlemagne. The hero is the illegitimate child of Perion,&nbsp;king of Gaul, and of Elisena, princess of Brittany, and is&nbsp;set adrift at sea in a cradle. He is picked up by a Scottish&nbsp;knight, who takes him to his own country ; he calls him&nbsp;the Child of the Sea and educates him at the king’s court.&nbsp;Having been knighted, Amadis goes to the assistance of&nbsp;his father Perion (the relationship being then unknown),&nbsp;who in the meantime had married Elisena, by whom he&nbsp;had a lawfully begotten son, Galaor. The second child is&nbsp;stolen by a giant. Amadis becomes revealed to his parents&nbsp;through a ring, and consoles them in their new loss. He&nbsp;overthrows the king of Ireland, who had invaded Gaul,&nbsp;and returns to England. The adventures of the two&nbsp;brothers Amadis and Galaor in England, France, Germany,&nbsp;and the East occupy the remainder of the work, which is&nbsp;full of combats between them and other knights, magicians,&nbsp;and giants. While a youth at the Scottish court Amadis&nbsp;met Oriana, daughter of Lisuarte, king of England, who&nbsp;had been sent away from home in consequence of political&nbsp;troubles. The vicissitudes of their love form a marked&nbsp;feature of the tale. At one time the hero, disguised and&nbsp;under the name of Beltenebros,</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup> retires to a hermitage&nbsp;upon receiving a cruel letter from Oriana. After defeating&nbsp;a hundred knights by whom Lisuarte had been attacked,&nbsp;and some further exploits, Amadis has to leave Oriana and&nbsp;the English court owing to the jealous suspicions of the&nbsp;king. He returns to rescue the princess from the Romans,&nbsp;and afterwards carries on a long war with Lisuarte, who is&nbsp;also attacked by a second enemy, Aravigo. In this perplexity Lisuarte is generously assisted by Amadis, who</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">@@@<sup>1</sup> Until recently bibliographers considered an edition printed at Salamanca in 1519 as the eiditio priηceps, although Clemencin and&nbsp;others cited one of 1510, which no one had seen. A most interesting&nbsp;discovery was, however, made at Ferrara in 1872 of an entirely unheard-of edition produced at Saragossa by G. Coci in 1508.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">@@@<sup>2</sup> From the French translation “ Le beau ténébreux ” comes the popular application of the phrase to taciturn and melancholy lovers.&nbsp;The episode, parodied by Cervantes, is derived from the romance of&nbsp;Tristan.
