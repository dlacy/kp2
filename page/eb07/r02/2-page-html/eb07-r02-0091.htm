<p><span class="font0">wished to blot, and his characters and his incidents are all calculated to call forth only the better feelings of our nature. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Virginibus puerisque</span><span class="font0"> might have been his appropriate&nbsp;and uncontested motto.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The great novelists to whom we have alluded, and particularly Fielding, Smollett, and Sterne, had of course&nbsp;many imitators. But the minuteness of Richardson was found&nbsp;to be intolerable in any hands but his own, and his manner&nbsp;in this country at least, though not in France and Germany,&nbsp;was soon abandoned. Amongst the numerous imitations&nbsp;of Fielding's manner, most of which are now forgotten,&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Henry</span><span class="font0"> of Cumberland (1752—1811), is probably the&nbsp;most respectable. Cumberland possessed that degree of&nbsp;talent which enabled him, both in dramatic composition,&nbsp;and in the novel, to produce performances which are read&nbsp;with pleasure, though they seldom rouse our interest, and&nbsp;never impress us with the idea of a creative genius. Accordingly, both his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Arundel</span><span class="font0"> and his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Henry</span><span class="font0"> have enjoyed a&nbsp;fair measure of popularity, particularly the latter, in which&nbsp;a story of tolerable interest is made the vehicle of displaying&nbsp;considerable acquaintance with English life in the lower&nbsp;ranks, derived from Cumberland's familiarity with such&nbsp;scenes in his early residence in Kent,—while the homeliness of these pictures is relieved by many rural landscapes&nbsp;perfectly English. The tale has the fault of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pamela,</span><span class="font0"> that&nbsp;aims at teaching virtue through scenes that border very&nbsp;closely on vice ; while, as Sir Walter Scott remarks, Cumberland reverses the usual process of courtship, and “ throws&nbsp;upon the softer sex the task of wooing, which is more&nbsp;gracefully as well as naturally the province of the man.”&nbsp;The characters’have little novelty; Cumberland was indebted for them to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Joseph Andrews,</span><span class="font0"> and he took the&nbsp;idea of his plan and style from </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Tam Jones.</span><span class="font0"> Henry is another version of Joseph himself, which Cumberland somehow seems not to have perceived to be a caricature created&nbsp;in the mere spirit of parody; but the portrait of an amiable,&nbsp;enthusiastic, and yet absurd Methodist parson in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ezekiel&nbsp;Daw,</span><span class="font0"> has an air of originality, even when placed beside that&nbsp;of Parson Adams, by which it was obviously, suggested.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The imitations of Smollett’s manner were not numerous, and, with one exception, totally without mcrit. We allude&nbsp;to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Adventures of a Guinea,</span><span class="font0"> by Charles Johnstone,&nbsp;which appeared in 1761, in which a series of scenes and&nbsp;personages in different walks of life are brought before us&nbsp;through the somewhat inartificial method of making a coin,&nbsp;which shifts through the hands of successive proprietors, the&nbsp;historian of their follies and their vices ; a contrivance very&nbsp;inferior indeed to the ingenious machinery by which Asmo-deus unveils to Don Cleofas the secrets of-Spanish life. In&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Adventures of α Guinea,</span><span class="font0"> the author seems to have had&nbsp;before him both Le Sage and Smollett as models ; but in&nbsp;the result he exhibits little of the gay good-humoured touch&nbsp;of the Frenchman, and nothing of the cordial merriment of&nbsp;the Scotchman. Where Le Sage painted follies, and Smollett frolics and absurdities, Johnstone, on whom some have&nbsp;conferred the high title of a prose Juvenal, delineated with a&nbsp;sarcastic and energetic brevity, the darkest vices and crimes&nbsp;of an age in which both political and domestic profligacy&nbsp;prevailed, and were paraded abroad with no ordinary degree of assurance. “ In Johnstone’s time,” says Sir Walter Scott, “ the reform which was introduced by the private virtues and patriotism of George III. had not commenced ; and he might well have said, with such an ardent temper as he seems to have possessed, ‘ Difficile est satyram non scribere.' He has accordingly indulged his wit&nbsp;to the utmost, and as most of his characters were living persons, then easily recognised, he held the mirror to nature&nbsp;even when it reflects such horrible features. His language&nbsp;is firm and energetic ; his power of personifying character&nbsp;striking and forcible, and the personages of his narrative&nbsp;move, breathe, and speak in all the freshness of life.” This&nbsp;is ldgh, and indeed we think, with deference, exaggerated&nbsp;praise. Who remembers or can name a single character&nbsp;which Johnstone has drawn, except perhaps his forcible but&nbsp;odious caricature of Whitefield ? What scene of real interest or passion has he painted in such a manner as to give&nbsp;it a home in our memories, like the better scenes of Fielding or Le Sage ? Not one : and indeed, bad as the age&nbsp;which he painted was, we believe he has greatly exaggerated its vices, or at least his one-sided views have led him&nbsp;to keep out of sight its redeeming points and countervailing virtues. Hence the impression the book leaves on&nbsp;the mind is one of oppression. It leads us along all the&nbsp;gloomy, and foul, and noisome passages of life, and we&nbsp;escape from it with the feeling of relief with which we&nbsp;would emerge from a vault in which the air was loaded with&nbsp;noxious vapour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Sterne is perhaps the only one of our great novelists who has found an imitator of genius, in Mackenzie (1745-1831) ;&nbsp;for although in his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Man of the World,</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Julia de Rou-bigne,</span><span class="font0"> Mackenzie has deviated from the manner of Sterne,&nbsp;and formed a composite manner, in which the characteristics&nbsp;of several writers are blended with his own, yet there can&nbsp;be little doubt that the spirit of Sterne, in his pathetic passages, in a great measure inspired </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Man of Feeling,</span><span class="font0"> and&nbsp;prompted that “ illustration of the richer and finer sensibilities of the human breast,” which Sir Walter Scott points&nbsp;out as the “ key-note” on which he formed his tales of fictitious woe. In some obvious respects, no doubt, Mackenzie improved upon his model ; as in rejecting the licem&nbsp;tiousness of Sterne’s wit, retrenching his episodical digressions, his numerous impertinencies, and intrusive buffoonery, and keeping the strain of feeling which he wishes&nbsp;to create more unbroken ; but as writers of genius, there&nbsp;surely can be no comparison between them. Mackenzie&nbsp;has none of those charming touches which hover with such&nbsp;a fine ambiguity between the pathetic and the humorous,—&nbsp;like Toby’s opening the window, and liberating the fly which&nbsp;had been buzzing about him all day,—and which operate, like&nbsp;spells, upon the heart. We fear, then, that the spirit of nationality, and the bias of private friendship, has led Sir Walter Scott&nbsp;somewhat to exaggerate the claims of Mackenzie, who, if he&nbsp;has less affectation in mere manner and style, seems to us to&nbsp;have more affectation of feeling than the author of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Tristram&nbsp;Shandy.</span><span class="font0"> In fact, Mackenzie betrays in some passages of&nbsp;his novels a tendency towards that unhealthy sentimentalism&nbsp;which was afterwards carried to such a sickly excess by inferior imitators of Sterne. Such is certainly the case in what&nbsp;is commonly considered the most powerful, though, we&nbsp;think, the least pleasing of his works, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Julia de Roubigne.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">No doubt, if the chief aim of fiction were “ to send the&nbsp;hearers weeping to their beds,” Mackenzie might claim&nbsp;the merit of having attained it. But though the distresses&nbsp;of the story may be in themselves naturally pourtrayed, the&nbsp;constant monotony of melancholy which it presents to us is&nbsp;not so ; it is morbid and out of nature, and the feeling with&nbsp;which it is perused, which is that of exhaustion and uneasiness, shews that the writer has missed the great aim of fiction, which is to make even suffering minister to a soothing&nbsp;feeling of sympathy, and to leave upon the mind at the&nbsp;close a sentiment of consolation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Thc Man of the World</span><span class="font0"> is exposed in some respects to the same objection. The suffering, the accumulation of&nbsp;misfortunes which are heaped upon the innocent Annes-leys, through the heartless villainy of Sindall, are too unmitigated. The story wants repose, relief, and sunshine.&nbsp;It is like an avenue of cypresses terminating in a tomb.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Man of Feeling,</span><span class="font0"> the first of Mackenzie’s productions,&nbsp;is, after all, the best. It is more unlaboured than the others,&nbsp;has more of the first freshness of the author’s mind about&nbsp;it ; and its brief manner, and quicker succession of situations,—for they can hardly be called incidents, relieve it from</span></p>
