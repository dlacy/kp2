                style="font-weight:bold;"> I.—</span><span class="font1"
                style="font-variant:small-caps;">General Survey of the Russian Empire.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">T</span><span class="font1">HE Russian empire is a very extensive
                territory in eastern Europe and northern Asia, with an area&nbsp;exceeding 8,500,000
                square miles, or one sixth of the land&nbsp;surface of the globe (one twenty-third
                of its whole superficies). It is, however, but thinly peopled on the
                average,&nbsp;including only one-fourteenth of the inhabitants of the&nbsp;earth. It
                is almost entirely confined to the cold and temperate zones. In Nova Zembla (Novaya
                Zemlya) and the&nbsp;Taimyr peninsula, it projects within the Arctic Circle
                as&nbsp;far as 77° 2' and 77° 40' N. lat.; while its southern extremities reach 38°
                50' in Armenia, about 35° on the Afghan&nbsp;frontier, and 42° 30' on the coasts of
                the Pacific. To the&nbsp;west it advances as far as 20° 40' E. long, in
                Lapland,&nbsp;18° 32' in Poland, and 29° 42' on the Black Sea ; and its&nbsp;eastern
                limit—East Cape in the Behring Strait—extends&nbsp;to 191° E. longitude.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The Arctic Ocean—comprising the White, Barents, and</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Kara Seas—and the northern Pacific, that is, the Seas of Behring,
                Okhotsk, and Japan, bound it in the north and&nbsp;east. The Baltic, with its two
                deep indentations, the Gulfs&nbsp;of Bothnia and Finland, limits it on the
                north-west ; and&nbsp;two sinuous lines of frontier separate it respectively
                from&nbsp;Sweden and Norway on the north-west and from Prussia,&nbsp;Austria, and
                Roumania on the west. The southern frontier&nbsp;is still unsettled, and has never
                remained unaltered for so&nbsp;many as twenty consecutive years. Quite recently it
                has&nbsp;been pushed southwards, on both the western and the&nbsp;eastern shores of
                the Black Sea, parts of Roumania and&nbsp;Asia Minor having been annexed in 1878. In
                Asia,&nbsp;beyond the Caspian, the southern boundary of the empire&nbsp;remains
                vague ; the advance into the Turcoman Steppes&nbsp;and Afghan Turkestan and on the
                Pamir plateau is still&nbsp;in progress. Bokhara and Khiva, though represented
                as&nbsp;vassal khanates, are in reality mere dependencies of Russia.&nbsp;An
                approximately settled frontier-line begins only farther&nbsp;east, where the Russian
                and the Chinese empires meet on&nbsp;the borders of Eastern Turkestan, Mongolia, and
                Manchuria.&nbsp;But even there, the province of Kuldja has recently
                been&nbsp;occupied by Russia, and again restored to China ; while in&nbsp;eastern
                Mongolia, the great overland route from Kiakhta&nbsp;to Peking, </span><span
                class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">via</span><span class="font1"> Urga, is in
                fact in the hands of Russia, and&nbsp;it is difficult to predict how far Russian
                influence may&nbsp;extend should circumstances lead it to seek a footing on&nbsp;the
                thinly-peopled plateaus of Central Asia.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Russia has no oceanic possessions, and has abandoned those she owned
                in last century ; her islands are mere&nbsp;appendages of the mainland to which they
                belong. Such&nbsp;are the Aland archipelago, Hochland, Tiitters, Dagö, and&nbsp;Osel
                in the Baltic Sea ; Nova Zembla, with Kolguefi and&nbsp;Vaigatch, in the Barents Sea
                ; the Solovetsky Islands in the&nbsp;White Sea ; the New Siberian archipelago, and
                the small&nbsp;group of the Medvyezhii Islands off the Siberian coast ;
                the&nbsp;Commandor Islands off Kamchatka ; the Shantar Islands&nbsp;and Saghalin in
                the Sea of Okhotsk. The Aleutian archipelago was sold to the United States in 1867,
                together with&nbsp;Alaska, and in 1874 the Kurile Islands were ceded to
                Japan.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">A vast variety of physical features is obviously to be expected in a
                territory like this, which comprises on the&nbsp;one side the cotton and silk
                regions of Turkestan and&nbsp;Transcaucasia, and on the other the moss and
                lichen-clothed&nbsp;Arctic </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
                >tundras</span><span class="font1"> and the Verkhoyansk Siberian pole of
                cold&nbsp;—the dry Transcaspian deserts and the regions watered by&nbsp;the monsoons
                on the coasts of the Sea of Japan. Still, if&nbsp;the border regions, that is, two
                narrow belts in the north&nbsp;and south, be left out of account, a striking
                uniformity of&nbsp;physical feature prevails. High plateaus, like those
                of&nbsp;Pamir (the “Roof of the World”) or of Armenia, and&nbsp;high mountain chains
                like the snow-clad summits of the&nbsp;Caucasus, the Alay, the Thian-Shan, the
                Sayan, are met&nbsp;with only on the outskirts of the empire.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Viewed broadly by the physical geographer, it appears as occupying
                the territories to the north-west of that great&nbsp;plateau-belt of the old
                continent—the backbone of Asia&nbsp;—which spreads with decreasing height and width
                from the&nbsp;high tableland of Tibet and Pamir to the lower plateaus
                of&nbsp;Mongolia, and thence north-eastwards through the Vitim&nbsp;region to the
                furthest extremity of Asia. It may be said to&nbsp;consist of the immense plains and
                flat lands which extend&nbsp;between the plateau-belt and the Arctic Ocean,
                including&nbsp;also the series of parallel chains and hilly spurs which
                skirt&nbsp;the plateau-belt on the north-west. It extends over the&nbsp;plateau
                itself, and crosses it, beyond Lake Baikal only.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">This belt—the oldest geological continent of Asia— being unfit for
                agriculture and for the most part unsuited&nbsp;for permanent settlement, while the
                oceanic slopes of it&nbsp;have from the dawn of history been occupied by a
                dense&nbsp;population, has long prevented Slavonian colonization from&nbsp;reaching
                the Pacific. Russians happened to cross it in the&nbsp;17th century, only in its
                narrowest and most northerly&nbsp;part, thus reaching the Pacific on the foggy and
                frozen&nbsp;coasts of the Sea of Okhotsk ; and two centuries elapsed&nbsp;ere, after
                colonizing the depressions of the plateau around&nbsp;Lake Baikal, the Russians
                crossed the plateau in a more&nbsp;genial zone and descended to the Pacific by the
                Amur,&nbsp;rapidly spreading farther south, up the nearly uninhabited&nbsp;Usuri, to
                what is now the Gulf of Peter the Great. In&nbsp;the south-western higher portions
                of the plateau-belt the&nbsp;empire has only recently planted its foot on the Pamir
                ; as&nbsp;we write, it is endeavouring to get command of the lower&nbsp;passages
                which give an easy access to the Afghan portion&nbsp;of the plateau ; while already,
                within the present century,&nbsp;it has established itself firmly on the plateaus of
                Armenia.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">A broad belt of hilly tracts—in every respect alpine in character,
                and displaying the same variety of climate and&nbsp;organic life as alpine tracts
                usually do—skirts the plateau-belt throughout its length on the north and
                north-west,&nbsp;forming an intermediate region between the plateaus and&nbsp;the
                plains. The Caucasus, the Elburz, the Kopet-dagh,&nbsp;and Paropamisus, the
                intricate and imperfectly known network of mountains west of the Pamir, the
                Thian-Shan and&nbsp;Ala-tau mountain regions, and farther north-east the
                Altai,&nbsp;the still unnamed complex of Minusinsk mountains, the&nbsp;intricate
                mountain-chains of Sayan, with those of the&nbsp;Olekma, Vitim, and Aldan, all of
                which are ranged </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
                >en&nbsp;échelon—</span><span class="font1">the former from north-west to
                south-east, and the&nbsp;others from south-west to north-east—all of these
                belong&nbsp;to one immense alpine belt bordering that of the plateaus.&nbsp;These
                have long been known to Russian colonists, who,&nbsp;seeking to escape religious
                prosecutions and exactions by&nbsp;the state, early penetrated into and rapidly
                pushed their&nbsp;small settlements up the better valleys of these tracts,
                and&nbsp;continued to spread everywhere as long as they found no&nbsp;obstacles in
                the shape of a former population or in unfavourable climatic conditions.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">As for the flat-lands which extend from the Alpine hill-foots to the
                shores of the Arctic Ocean, and assume the character either of dry deserts in the
                Aral-Caspian depression, or of low table-lands in central Russia and&nbsp;eastern
                Siberia, of lake-regions in north-west Russia and&nbsp;Finland, or of marshy
