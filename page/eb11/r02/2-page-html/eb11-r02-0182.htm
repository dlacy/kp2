<p><span class="font2">a fact which requires for its explanation the assumption that the book emanated from certain literary circles influenced by John.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Date.—</span><span class="font2">There are many indications of the date, which may be summarized as follows: (a) Condition of the Asian churches.&nbsp;(&amp;) Persecution of the church, (c) Attitude of the author to&nbsp;Rome, (d) The Antichrist legend, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(e)</span><span class="font2"> Primitive tradition and&nbsp;its confirmation through the discovery of references in the&nbsp;text to certain edicts of Domitian. As a result of these considerations we may arrive at the date of the work with almost&nbsp;greater certainty than that of any other New Testament book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font2">) </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Condition of the Churches.—</span><span class="font2">Christianity appears to have&nbsp;already had a long history behind it. The fact that St Paul&nbsp;founded the church of Ephesus seems to have been forgotten.&nbsp;The earliest zeal has passed away and heathen ways of thought&nbsp;and life are tolerated and practised at Pergamum and Ephesus,&nbsp;and faith is dying or dead at Laodicea and Sardis. These&nbsp;phenomena belong to a period considerably later than the time&nbsp;of Nero.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">b</span><span class="font2">) </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Persecution of the Church.—</span><span class="font2">Persecution is the order of the&nbsp;day. Each of the seven letters concludes with praise of those&nbsp;who have been victorious therein. There had been isolated&nbsp;instances of persecution at Ephesus, ii. 3, Philadelphia, iii. 8,10,&nbsp;and at Smyrna, ii. 9, and of an actual martyrdom at Pergamum,&nbsp;ii. 13. But now a storm of persecution was about to break upon&nbsp;the universal church, iii. 10, and in the immediate future.&nbsp;Already the seer beholds the destined number of the martyrs&nbsp;complete, vi. 9-11: the great multitude whom no man could&nbsp;number, clothed in white before the throne of God, vii. 9: he&nbsp;exhorts his readers to patient endurance unto death, xiv, 12,&nbsp;and already sees them as victors in heaven, xv. 2. Over the&nbsp;true witnesses and martyrs he pronounces the final beatitude&nbsp;of the faithful: “ Blessed are those who die in the Lord,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">xiv. 13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Such an expectation of persecution is inexplicable from Nero’s time. There is not a trace of any declaration of war&nbsp;on the universal church in his period such as the Apocalyptist&nbsp;aiïticipates and in part experiences. Christian persecution&nbsp;under Nero was an imperial caprice. The Christians were&nbsp;attacked on slanderous charges of superstition and secret&nbsp;abominations, but not as a church. Not till the last years of&nbsp;Domitian is it possible to discover conditions which would&nbsp;explain the apprehensions and experiences of our writer. So&nbsp;far as we can discover, no persecution was directed against&nbsp;Christians as Christians till Doraitian’s time. In the year&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font2"> 92 Flavius Clemens was put to death and his wife banished,&nbsp;on fhe ground that they were adherents of the new faith. Thus&nbsp;the temper of the book on this question demands some date&nbsp;after </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font2"> 90. It marks the transition, from the earlier tolerant&nbsp;attitude of Rome towards Christianity, to its later hostile&nbsp;attitude.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Attitude of the Author towards Rome.—</span><span class="font2">In earlier times the&nbsp;church had strongly impressed the duty of loyalty to Rome,&nbsp;as we see from the Epistle to the Romans and 1 Peter. This&nbsp;was before the pressure of the imperial cult was felt by the&nbsp;Christian church. But in the Apocalypse we have the experiences of a later date. The writer manifests the most burning&nbsp;hatred towards Rome and the worship of its head—the beast&nbsp;and the false prophet, who are actual embodiments of Satan.&nbsp;Such an attitude on the part of a Christian is not explicable&nbsp;before the closing years of Domitian; for, apart from Caligula,&nbsp;he was the first Roman emperor who consistently demanded&nbsp;divine honours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Antichrist Legend.—</span><span class="font2">We find at least two stages of the&nbsp;Neronic and Antichrist myth in the Apocalypse. The earliest&nbsp;form is not attested here, that Nero had not really been slain,&nbsp;but would speedily return and destroy his enemies. The first&nbsp;pretender appeared in </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font2"> 69, and was put to death in Cythnus.&nbsp;The second stage of this legend was that Nero had taken refuge&nbsp;in the Far East, and would return with the help of his Eastern&nbsp;subjects for the overthrow of Rome. Two pretenders arose in&nbsp;conformity with this expectation among the Parthians in&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font2"> 80 and 88. This widespread expectation has left its&nbsp;memorial in our book in xvi. 12 and in xvii. 16-17, which point&nbsp;to the belief that Rome would be destroyed by Nero and the&nbsp;Parthian kings. Finally, in xiii. and xvii. 8, 12-14, we have&nbsp;a later phase of the myth, in which there is a fusion of the&nbsp;Antichrist myth with that of Nero </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">redivivus.</span><span class="font2"> This fusion could&nbsp;hardly have taken place before the first half of Domitian’s reign,&nbsp;when the last Neronic pretender appeared. As soon as the&nbsp;hope of the living Nero could no longer be entertained, the way&nbsp;was prepared for this transformation of the myth. The living&nbsp;Nero was no longer expected to return from the East, but Nero&nbsp;was to be restored to life from the abyss by the dragon, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">Satan. This expectation is recounted in xiii., but it appears&nbsp;most clearly in the additions to xvii. Thus in xvii. 8 the&nbsp;reference to Nero </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">redivivus</span><span class="font2"> as the Antichrist is manifest: “ The&nbsp;beast that thou sawest was, and is not, and is about to come&nbsp;up out of the abyss and to go into perdition.”@@<sup>1</sup> Thus again we&nbsp;are obliged to postulate a date not earlier than </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font2"> 90 for the&nbsp;book in its present form.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(c) </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Primitive Church Tradition and its Confirmation through the Discovery of References in the Text to Certain Edicts of Domitian.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">—The earliest external evidence is practically unanimous in&nbsp;ascribing the Apocaljrpse to the last years of Domitian. The&nbsp;oldest testimony is that of Irenaeus v. 30. 3: </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">bd εκείνον άν ερρεθη&nbsp;του καί την Χποκάλνφιν ίωρακότος obbè yàp πρό</span><span class="font2"> πολλοί) </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">χρόνον&nbsp;ίωράθη,</span><span class="font2"> άλλα </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">σχεόόν επί Tijs ^μετεροχ y εν ε as, Trpbs</span><span class="font2"> τω </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">τελεί της&nbsp;Δομετίανοΰ άρχη$.</span><span class="font2"> The rest of the patristic evidence from&nbsp;Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Victorinus, Eusebius and&nbsp;Jerome will be found in Swete’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Apocalypse of St John<sup>t</sup>,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">xcix. seq. Though a few later authorities, such as Epiphanius&nbsp;and Theophylact, assign thc book to earlier or later periods,&nbsp;the main body of early Christian tradition attests the date&nbsp;of its composition in the closing years of Domitian. Notwithstanding, on various critical grounds, Baur, Hilgenfeld,&nbsp;Lightfoot, Westcott, Hort and Beyschlag assigned the book&nbsp;to the reign of Nero, or to the years immediately following&nbsp;his death, while Weiss, Dusterdieck and Mommsen assign it&nbsp;to the time of Vespasian. When, however, we combine the&nbsp;preceding arguments with that of the early church tradition,&nbsp;the evidence for the Domitian date outweighs that for any&nbsp;other. And this conclusion receives remarkable confirmation&nbsp;from a recent fact brought forward by S. Reinach in an article&nbsp;in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Revue archéologique,</span><span class="font2"> sér. III. t. xxxix. (1901), pp. 350-74,&nbsp;and reprinted in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Cultes, mythes et religions,</span><span class="font2"> ii. 356-80 (1906).&nbsp;This fact explains a passage which has hitherto been a total&nbsp;enigma to every expounder, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font2"> vi. 6: “A choenix of wheat for&nbsp;a denarius, and three choenikes of barley for a denarius, and&nbsp;the oil and the wine hurt thou not.” Swete writes here: &quot; The&nbsp;voice fixes a maximum price for the main food-stuffs. The&nbsp;denarius . . . was the daily wage . . . and a choenix of wheat</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">@@@<sup>1</sup>Verse ir postulates either a Vespasianic or Domitianic date: “ And the beast that was, and is not, is himself also an eighth,&nbsp;and is of the seven; and he goeth into perdition.” In verse 10&nbsp;it is stated that five of the seven had fallen, ” the one is and another&nbsp;is not yet come, and when he cometh he must continue a little&nbsp;while?’ If we reckon from Augustine and omit Galba, Otho and&nbsp;Vitellius, each of whom reigned only a few months, we arrive at&nbsp;Vespasian. The vision, therefore, belongs to his reign, a.d. 69-79.&nbsp;Verse n, with the exception of the words “ which was and is not,”&nbsp;leads to the identification of the eighth with Nero </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">redivivus.</span><span class="font1"> But&nbsp;what then is to be made of the above reckoning when it was taken&nbsp;over by the Apocalyptist who wrote in Domitian’s reign? Some&nbsp;scholars are of opinion that this writer identified Domitian with&nbsp;the eighth emperor, the Nero </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">redivivus,</span><span class="font1"> the beast from the abyss.&nbsp;But this is unlikely, notwithstanding the fact that even some&nbsp;pagan writers, such as Juvenal, Pliny and Martial (?), traced a&nbsp;resemblance between Domitian and Nero. On the other hand,&nbsp;if we refuse to accept this identification, and hold that the beast&nbsp;from the abyss is yet to come, any attempt at a strict exegesis of&nbsp;the text plunges us in hopeless difficulties. For Domitian in that&nbsp;case would be the sixth, and the preceding five would have to begin&nbsp;with Galba—a most improbable supposition. But futhermore,&nbsp;since this new reckoning would exclude Nero, how could the&nbsp;eighth be said to be one of the seven, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font1"> Nero ? Bousset thmks&nbsp;that the Apocalyptist, knowing not what to make of this reckoning,&nbsp;left it standing as it was and attempted a new interpretation of the&nbsp;seven heads by taking them to refer to the seven hills of </span><span class="font2">Rome </span><span class="font1">in&nbsp;the addition he made to verse 9.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
