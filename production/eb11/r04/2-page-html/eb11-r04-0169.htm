<p><span class="font0">Latin speeches in honour of ancient republican liberty. The, admiration of antiquity was then at its height, and Porcari&nbsp;found many enthusiastic hearers. Directly after the death of&nbsp;Eugenius IV. he made a first and unsuccessful attempt to pro-claim the republic. Nevertheless Nicholas V., with the same&nbsp;indulgence for scholars that had prompted him to pardon&nbsp;Valla for denying the temporal power of the papacy and laughing&nbsp;to scorn the pretended donation of Constantine, freely pardoned&nbsp;Porcari and named him podestà of Ariagni. He filled this&nbsp;office with credit, but on his return to Rome again began to&nbsp;play the agitator, and was banished to Bologna with a pension&nbsp;from the pope. Nicholas V. had conferred all the state offices&nbsp;upon priests and abbots, and had erected numerous fortresses.&nbsp;Hence there were many malcontents in Rome, in communication with Porcari at Bologna, and ready to join in his plot.&nbsp;Arms were collected, and on the day fixed he presented himself&nbsp;to his fellow-conspirators adorned with rich robes and a gold&nbsp;chain, and harangued them in Latin on the duty of freeing&nbsp;their country from the yoke of the priests. His design was to&nbsp;set fire to the Vatican on the 6th of January 1453, the feast of&nbsp;the Epiphany; he and his followers were to seize the pope,&nbsp;the cardinals and the castle of St Angelo. But Nicholas&nbsp;received timely warning; the conspirators’ house was surrounded; and Porcari himself was seized while trying to escape,&nbsp;confined in the castle of St Angelo, and put to death with nine&nbsp;of his companions on the 9th of January. Others shortly&nbsp;suffered the same fate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Under Calixtus III. and Pius II. affairs went on quietly enough, but Paul II. (1464-71) had a somewhat troubled&nbsp;reign. Yet he was a skilled politician. He re-ordered the&nbsp;finances and the courts of justice, punished crime with severity,&nbsp;was an energetic foe to the Malatesta of Rimini, put an&nbsp;end to the oppression exercised in Rome by the wealthy and&nbsp;arrogant house of Anguillara, and kept the people in good&nbsp;humour with continual festivities. But—and this was a grave&nbsp;defect at that period—he extended no favour to learning, and,&nbsp;by driving many scholars from the curia to make room for his&nbsp;own kinsmen, brought a storm about his ears. At that time&nbsp;the house of Pomponio Leto was the rendezvous of learned&nbsp;men and the seat of the Roman Academy. Leto was an&nbsp;enthusiast of antiquity; and, as the members of the Academy&nbsp;all assumed old Latin names, they were suspected of a design&nbsp;to re-establish paganism and the republican government. It is certain that they all inveighed against&nbsp;the pope; and, as the latter was no man of half&nbsp;measures, during the carnival of 1468 he suddenly&nbsp;imprisoned twenty Academicians, and even subjected&nbsp;a few of them to torture. Pomponio Leto, although&nbsp;absent in Venice, was also arrested and tried; but he&nbsp;exculpated himself, craved forgiveness, and was set&nbsp;at liberty. His friends were also released, for the charge of&nbsp;conspiracy proved to be unfounded. Certain members of&nbsp;the Academy, and notably Platina in his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lives of the&nbsp;Popes,</span><span class="font0"> afterwards revenged themselves by stigmatizing Paul II.&nbsp;as the persecutor of philosophy and letters. But he was no more&nbsp;a persecutor than a patron of learning; he was a politician,&nbsp;the author of some useful reforms, and solely intent on the&nbsp;• consolidation of his absolute power. Among his reforms may&nbsp;be classed the revision of the Roman statutes in 1469, for the&nbsp;purpose of destroying the substance while preserving the form&nbsp;of the old Roman legislation, and entirely stripping it of all&nbsp;political significance. In fact the pope’s will was now absolute, and even in criminal cases he could trample unhindered</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">on the common law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There was still a senator of Rome, whose nomination was entirely in the hands of the pope, still three conservators, the&nbsp;heads of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rioni,</span><span class="font0"> and an elected council of twenty-six citizens.&nbsp;Now and then also a shadowy semblance of a popular assembly&nbsp;was held to cast dust in the eyes of the public, but even this was&nbsp;not for long. All these officials, together with the judges of the&nbsp;Capitol, retained various attributes of different kinds. They&nbsp;administered justice and gave sentence. There were numerous&nbsp;tribunals all with undefined modes of procedure, so that it was&nbsp;very difficult for the citizens to ascertain in which court justice&nbsp;should be sought. But in last resort there was always the&nbsp;supreme decision of the pope. Thus matters remained to the&nbsp;time of the French Revolution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For the completion of this system a final blow had to be dealt to the aristocracy, whose power had been increased by nepotism;&nbsp;and it was dealt by bloodshed under the three following popes—&nbsp;Sixtus IV. (1471-84), Innocent VIII. (1484-92) and Alexander&nbsp;VI. (1492-1503)—each of whom was worse than his predecessor.&nbsp;The first, by means of his nephews, continued the slaughter of&nbsp;the Colonna, sending an army against them, devastating their&nbsp;estates at Marino, and beheading the protonotary Lorenzo&nbsp;Colonna. Innocent VIII. was confronted by the power of the&nbsp;Orsini, who so greatly endangered his life by their disturbances&nbsp;in the city that he was only saved by an alliance with Naples.&nbsp;Neither peace nor order could be lastingly established until&nbsp;these arrogant barons were overthrown. This task was accomplished by the worst of the three pontiffs, Alexander VI. All&nbsp;know how the massacre of the Orsini was compassed, almost&nbsp;simultaneously, by the pope in Rome and his equally iniquitous&nbsp;son, Caesar Borgia, at Sinigaglia (1502). This pair dealt the&nbsp;last blow to the Roman aristocracy and the tyrants of Romagna,&nbsp;and thus the temporal dominion of the papacy was finally&nbsp;assured. The republic was now at an end; it had shrivelled&nbsp;to a civil municipality. Its institutions, deprived of all practical&nbsp;value, lingered on like ghosts of the past, subject from century&nbsp;to century to unimportant changes. The history of Rome is&nbsp;henceforth absorbed in that of the papacy. *</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Nevertheless the republic twice attempted to rise from its grave, and on the second occasion gave proofs of heroism&nbsp;worthy of its most glorious past. It was first resuscitated in February 1798, by the influence of the&nbsp;French Revolution, and the French constitution of&nbsp;the year III. was rapidly imitated. Rome had again two&nbsp;councils—the tribunate and the senate, with five consuls constituting the executive power. But in the following year,&nbsp;owing to the military reverses of the French, the government&nbsp;of the popes was restored until 1809, when Napoleon I. annexed&nbsp;to his empire the States of the Church. Rome was then&nbsp;governed by a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">consulta straordinaria</span><span class="font0">—a special commission—&nbsp;with the municipal and provincial institutions of France. In&nbsp;1814 the papal government was again reinstated, and the old&nbsp;institutions, somewhat modified on the French system, were&nbsp;recalled to life. Tius IX. (1846-77) tried to introduce political&nbsp;reforms, and to improve and simplify the old machineiy of state;&nbsp;but the advancing tide of the Italian revolution of 1848 drove&nbsp;him from Rome; the republic was once more proclaimed, and&nbsp;had a brief but glorious existence. Its programme was dictated&nbsp;by Giuseppe Mazzini, who with Saffi and Armellini formed the&nbsp;triumvirate at the head of the government. United Italy was&nbsp;to be a republic with Rome for her capital. The rhetorical idea&nbsp;of Cola di Rienzi became heroic in 1849. The constituent&nbsp;assembly (9th February 1849) proclaimed the fall of the temporal power of the popes, and the establishment of a republic&nbsp;which was to be not only of Rome but of all Italy. France,&nbsp;although then herself a republic, assumed the unenviable task&nbsp;of re-establishing the temporal power by force of arms. But&nbsp;the gallant defence of Rome by Garibaldi covered the republic&nbsp;with glory. The enemy was repulsed, and the army of the&nbsp;Neapolitan king, sent to restore the pope, was also driven off.&nbsp;Then, however, France despatched a fresh and more powerful&nbsp;force; Rome was vigorously besieged, and at last compelled&nbsp;to surrender. On the 2nd of July 1849 the heroic general&nbsp;departed from the city with some thousands of his followers.&nbsp;Almost at the same time the constituent assembly proclaimed&nbsp;in the Capitol the constitution of the Roman Republic. Immediately afterwards the French restored the government of Pius IX.,&nbsp;whose reign down to 1870 was that of an absolute sovereign.&nbsp;Then the Italian government entered Rome (20th September&nbsp;1870), proclaimed the national constitution (9th October 1870),&nbsp;and the Eternal City became the capital of Italy.
