What is most to be lamented is, that in wishing to educate a young man as a Christian, he has filled a volume with objections against Christianity. It must be confessed that he has given a very sublime eulogium on the gospel, and an affecting portrait of its divine Author ; but the miracles and the prophecies, which serve to establish his mission, he attacks without reserve. Admitting only natural religion, he weighs every thing in the balance of reason ; and this reason being false, leads him into dilemmas which are very unfavourable to his own repose and happiness. The French parliament condemned this book in 1762, and entered into a criminal prosecution against the author, which forced him to make a precipitate retreat. He directed his steps towards his native country, but it shut its gates upon him. Proscribed in the place where he had first drawn breath, he sought an asylum in Switzerland, and found one in the principality of Neufchatel. But the protection of the king of Prussia, to whom the principality belonged, was not sufficient to rescue him from that obloquy which the minister of Moutiers-Travers, the village to which he had retired, had excited against him. He preached against Rousseau, and his sermons produced an uproar amongst the people. On the night between the 6th and the 7th of September 1765, some fanatics, inspired by wine and the declamations of their minister, threw stones at the windows of the Genevan philosopher, who, fearing new insults, in vain sought an asylum in the canton of Berne. As this canton was connected with the republic of Geneva, they did not think proper to allow him to remain in their city, who was proscribed by that republic. Neither his broken state of health, nor the approach of winter, could soften the hearts of these obdurate Switzers. To prevent them from the fear they had of the spreading of his opinions, he in vain beseeched them to shut him up in prison till the spring. But even this favour was denied him. Obliged to set out on a journey in the beginning of a most inclement season, he reached Strasbourg in a very destitute situation. He received from Marshal de Contades, who then commanded in that place, every accommodation which could be expected from generosity, humanity, and compassion. He waited there till the weather became milder, when he went to Paris, where Mr Hume then was. The English philosopher determined upon taking him with him to England. After having made some stay in Paris, Rousseau, in 1766, actually set out for London. Hume, much affected with his situation and his misfortunes, procured for him a very agreeable retreat in the country. The Genevan philosopher, however, did not long remain satisfied. He made less impression on the minds of the English than he had done on the French. His free disposition, and his obdurate melancholy temper, were deemed no singularity in England. He was there looked upon as an ordinary man, and the periodical prints were filled with satires against him. In particular, they published a forged letter from the king of Prussia, holding up to ridicule the principles and conduct of this new Diogenes. Rousseau, imagining there was a plot between Hume and some philosophers in France to destroy his glory and repose, sent a letter to him, filled with the most abusive expressions, and reproaching him for his conduct towards him. From this time he looked upon Hume as a wicked and perfidious person, who had brought him to England with no other view than to expose him to public ridicule ; a foolish and chimerical idea, which was nourished by self-love and a restless disposition. He imagined that the English philosopher, amidst all his kindnesses, had something disagreeable in the manner of expressing them. The bad health of Rousseau, a strong and melancholy imagination, a too nice sensibility, a jealous disposition, joined with philosophical vanity, cherished by the false informations of his governess, who possessed an uncommon power over him ; all these taken together might have tended to prepossess him with unfavourable sentiments of some innocent freedoms his benefactor might have taken with him, and might have rendered him ungrateful, which he thought himself incapable of becoming. Meanwhile these false conjectures and probabilities ought never to have had the weight with an honest mind to withdraw itself from its friend and benefactor. Proofs are always necessary in cases of this kind ; and that which Rousseau had was by no means a certain demonstration. The Genevan philosopher, however, returned to France, spited with the world, and particularly offended with the English philosopher. On the let of July 1770, he appeared for the first time at the regency coffee-house, dressed in his ordinary clothing, having for some time previous to this worn an Armenian habit He was loaded with praises by the surrounding multitude. “ It is somewhat singular,” says M. Sennebier, “ to see a man so haughty as he returning to the very place from whence he had been banished so often. Nor is it one of the smallest inconsistencies of this extraordinary character, that he preferred a retreat in that place of which he had spoken so much ill.” It is as singular that a person under sentence of imprisonment should wish to live in so public a manner in the very place where his sentence was in force against him. His friends, however, procured for him the liberty of staying, on condition that he should write neither on religion nor on politics; and he kept his word, for he wrote none at all. He was contented with living in a calm and philosophical manner, cultivating the society of a few tried friends, shunning the company of the great, appearing to give up all his whimsies, and affecting neither the character of a philosopher nor a wit. He died of an apoplexy, at Ermenonville, about ten leagues from Paris, on the 2d of July 1778, aged sixty-six years. Rousseau, during his stay in the environs of Lyons, married Mademoiselle le Vasseur, a woman who, without either beauty or talents, had gained over him a great ascendency, and waited on him both in health and in sickness. But, as if she had been jealous of possessing him alone, she drove from his mind, by the most perfidious insinuations, all those who came to entertain him ; and when he did not dismiss them, she prevented their return by invariably refusing them admittance. By these means she the more easily led her husband into inconsistencies of conduct, which the originality of his character, as well as of his opinions, so much contributed to assist. He did not incline to associate with any person ; and as this method of thinking and living was uncommon, it made him an object of curiosity, and procured him a name. Like Diogenes of old, he united simplicity of manners with pride of genius ; and a very large stock of indolence, with an extreme sensibility, served to render his character still more uncommon. “ An indolent mind,” says he, “ terrified at every application, a warm, bilious, and irritable temperament, sensible also in a high degree to every thing that can affect it, appear not possible to be united in the same person ; and yet these two contrarieties compose the chief of mine. An active life has no charms for me. I would an hundred times rather consent to be idle than to do any thing against my will ; and I have an hundred times thought that I would live not amiss in the Bastille, provided I had nothing to do but just continue there. In my younger days I made several attempts to get in there ; but as they were only with the view of procuring a refuge and rest in my old age, and, like the exertions of an indolent person, only by fits and starts, they were never attended with the smallest success. When misfortunes came, they afforded me a pretext for giving myself up to my ruling passion.”</p><p>His ideas about politics were almost as eccentric as his paradoxes about religion. Some reckon his Social Compact, which Voltaire calls the Unsocial Compact, the greatest effort of his genius ; whilst others find it full of contradictions, errors, and cynical passages, obscure, ill arranged,</p></body></text></TEI>
