<p><span class="font1">form a bundle opposed to the rest; thc fibulare and tibiale are fused into one bone; the fused fifth and fourth distal tarsals form&nbsp;a very large half-globular piece for the three outer toes, whilst&nbsp;the second toe is carried by the third distal tarsal, besides which&nbsp;there are three more small cartilages, one of which may be the&nbsp;displaced second tarsal or the still independent central. The&nbsp;tarsus of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sphenodon</span><span class="font1"> is like that of typical lizards, but none of its&nbsp;distal tarsals are fused on to metatarsals. The Crocodilian foot&nbsp;marks an advance. The astragalus is large, articulating well&nbsp;with tibia and fibula, and against the fibulare, which forms a&nbsp;typical, heel-shaped calcanéum. The fifth and fourth distal&nbsp;tarsals carry the fourth toe and the hook-shaped fifth metatarsal to which the fifth toe is reduced. The third, second and&nbsp;first distaI tarsalia scarcely contain osseous nodules; they form&nbsp;together a wedge-shaped cartilaginous pad between the astragalus and the first and second toes. This attachment of the&nbsp;distal tarsals to the metatarsals reminds us of the Lacertilian&nbsp;condition, the result in either case being a still more marked&nbsp;intertarsal joint in addition to the cruro-tarsal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Most well-footed reptiles retain all the five toes; only the crocodiles and a few tortoises have lost all the phalanges of the&nbsp;fifth toe. The phalangeal numbers are in the Lacertilia 2, 3, 4,&nbsp;5 and 3 in the fifth toe; in chameleons 2, 3, 4, 4, 3; in most&nbsp;tortoises 2, 3, 3, 3, 2; but in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Homopus, Pyxis QjadCinixys</span><span class="font1"> 2, 2,&nbsp;2, 2, 0; in the crocodiles 2, 3, 4, 4, 0. The embryos of crocodiles&nbsp;are said to be IiyperphaIangeaI ; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font1"> as many as 7 phalanges on&nbsp;the fourth; 5 or 6 on the fifth finger; 6 on the fourth toe, and&nbsp;there are traces of the fifth toe. In the adult the fourth toe&nbsp;remains without a claw. Burrowing and living in sand, or humus,&nbsp;is in many lizards correlated with reduction of the limbs and&nbsp;their girdles. The vestiges of the hind limbs come to lie as near&nbsp;the vent as possible. The&nbsp;reduction occurs in various&nbsp;families, independently.&nbsp;In most cases the fore&nbsp;limbs disappear first, but&nbsp;in the Amphisbaenidae,&nbsp;cf. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chirotes,</span><span class="font1"> and in the&nbsp;Tejidae, the reverse takes&nbsp;place. Whilst degeneracy&nbsp;of the shoulder-girdle is&nbsp;delayed long after the loss&nbsp;of the anterior limbs, that of the pelvic arch precedes the loss&nbsp;of the hind limbs. Cope has drawn up a tabular statistic of&nbsp;the loss of digits, limbs and&nbsp;their girdles on pp. 202-3 of&nbsp;his work, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Crocodiles, Lizards&nbsp;and Snakes of North America&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(Washington, 1900). The&nbsp;peculiar hind limbs of the&nbsp;Dibamidae are described in</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">the article Lizard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The majority of snakes</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">have lost all traces of the limbs and their girdles, except the so-called Peropoda&nbsp;(see Snakes: </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Classification).&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">The vestiges of a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Boa</span><span class="font1"> and&nbsp;of a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Glauconia</span><span class="font1"> are shown in&nbsp;fig· 35·</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tegumentary System,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The skin of reptiles is characterized by the strong development of its horny stratum; on the outside of it exists a thin cuticular&nbsp;or epitrichial layer. An important feature in most lizards and&nbsp;in the snakes is the existence of a “ Subepirdemoidal ” or transitional layer which is produced by the migration of ectodermal&nbsp;cells into the cutis. The immigration takes place during th*e&nbsp;embryonic development, observed first by Kerschner, who,&nbsp;however, misinterpreted the process. Pigment cells, black&nbsp;chromatophores also, make their first appearance in the epiderm&nbsp;and then migrate into the transitional stratum, as has been first&nbsp;correctly stated by F. Maurer. The horny stratum is shed&nbsp;periodically, several times during the year, and as one entire&nbsp;piece in snakes and a few lizards, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font1"> Anguidae; in most lizards,&nbsp;chameleons, geckos and in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sphenodon</span><span class="font1"> the thin, transparent&nbsp;colourless layer comes off in flakes. In crocodiles it is not shed&nbsp;except for the usual wear and tear, nor in tortoises, although in&nbsp;some </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.g. Chrysemys/</span><span class="font1"> a periodical peeling of the large shields-has been observed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In all reptiles the cutis is raised into papillae, or folds. When the papillae are small the skin appears granular; when they are&nbsp;large, flat, mostly imbricating, they form scales; when they are&nbsp;very broad-based and still larger, they are called scutes or&nbsp;shields. The overlying epidermal covering partakes of these&nbsp;elevations, often </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font1"> in many snakes, with a very fine system of&nbsp;ridges of its own. Such a scale, cutis and horny sheath, may&nbsp;form spikes, or crests. They all have only basal growth. Thus,&nbsp;for instance, a shield of a tortoise-shell is a much flattened scale,&nbsp;or cone, with the apex more or less in the centre, surrounded&nbsp;by marginal ridges which indicate the continuous additional&nbsp;growth at the base. The central “ areola ” represents in fact&nbsp;the size of the shield at the time of hatching.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Of very common occurrence is the development of bone in the cutaneous portion of the scales; such osteoderms occur in&nbsp;many lizards, very strongly developed in the scutes of the&nbsp;crocodiles, especially on the back; they also occur in the skin&nbsp;of tortoises especially on their legs and on the tail, and they&nbsp;probably constitute the peculiar shell of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sphargis,</span><span class="font1"> the leathery&nbsp;turtle (see Tortoise). </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sphenodon</span><span class="font1"> and chameleons are devoid&nbsp;of such osteoderms, in geckos they are likewise absent, but&nbsp;calcifications occur in their tubercular skin. A similar process&nbsp;seems to have produced the egg-tooth of crocodiles and tortoises&nbsp;(see under </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Teeth</span><span class="font1"> below). Calcareous deposits, or at least&nbsp;deposits of guanine and more commonly of carbonate of lime,&nbsp;play a considerable rôle in the skin of lizards and snakes. These&nbsp;waste products of the metabolism are always deposited within&nbsp;cells, and a favourite place is the subepidermal layer. In&nbsp;combination with superimposed yellow or red pigment, and with&nbsp;the black chromatophores as a foil, partial or complete screen&nbsp;to the light, as the case may be, these mineral deposists are to a&nbsp;great extent answerable for the colours and their often marvellous changes in the skin (see Chameleon).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Peculiar pits in the scales of snakes and crocodiles are described under </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sense-Organs</span><span class="font1"> below.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The skin of reptiles is very poor in glands, but the few which exist are well developed. Crocodiles possess a pair of glandular&nbsp;musk bags which open by rather large slits on the under jaw,&nbsp;against the inner side of the jaw. Another pair of musk glands&nbsp;are the anal glands. During great excitement all these glands&nbsp;can be everted by the crocodiles. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sphenodon</span><span class="font1"> and snakes have&nbsp;only the anal pair. Water tortoises have inguinal glands, which&nbsp;secrete a strongly scented fluid, opening near the posterior rim&nbsp;of the bridge. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Trionyx</span><span class="font1"> has additional glands opening near&nbsp;the anterior part of the plastron. Peculiar glandular structures&nbsp;are the femoral pores of many lizards. They lie in a line from&nbsp;the inner side of the knee to the anterior margin of the anaI&nbsp;region, to which they are restricted in the limbless Amphis-baenidae. Each pore leads into a subcutaneous pocket, sometimes&nbsp;with slightly acinous side chambers, the walls of which produce&nbsp;a smeary, yellowish matter consisting chiefly of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">debris</span><span class="font1"> of&nbsp;disintegrated cells which dries or hardens on the surface in the&nbsp;shape of a little projecting rod. They occur in both sexes, but&nbsp;are most active in males during the pairing season. Their use&nbsp;is unknown. It would be far-fetched to liken them to forerunners of the sebaceous portions of milk glands, although not&nbsp;so imaginary as to see in them and in the sensory pits of snake&nbsp;scales the forerunners of the mammalian hairs!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Claws, scarcely indicated in Batrachia, are fully developed in all limbed reptiles. The base is sunk into the skin like our&nbsp;own finger nails; the dorsal and ventral halves are differentiated into a harder, more curved dorsal sheath-like portion, and&nbsp;into the beginning of a sole, especially in crocodiles and </span><span class="font0">in&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">blunt-toed tortoises. The first claw to be reduced is that of</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
