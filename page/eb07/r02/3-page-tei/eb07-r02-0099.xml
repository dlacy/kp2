His influence on Italy, France, and Germany, we shall afterwards have occasion to notice. On the literature of Great Britain, we believe it to have exerted on the whole a most beneficial effect; not, indeed, that any professed imitation of his manner has yet appeared, which possesses great claims to genius, but that he has carried a higher spirit into novel writing; taught us how the simple feelings of</p><p>i&gt;easants, and the homely pathos of humble life, and the re-entings of feeling amongst the outcasts of society, might be made to blend with scenes of high imagination ; that his writings are calculated to strengthen the ties of our co mmon humanity ; that they never tend to foster a bad, or to throw ridicule upon a good or generous feeling ; while, speaking of them in a merely literary point of view, they taught lessons of simplicity, good taste, moderation, and skill in seizing the best points both of character and description, which have not been without their effect even on those by whom the mere manner of Scott, or his choice of subjects, have been studiously avoided.</p><p>The professed imitators of Scott have been numerous, but not successful. As usual, they have magnified his defects, urging his conventional personages, such as dwarfs, fools, gypsies, and bores, into caricature ; multiplying instead of retrenching those similes which, even in the original, were so obtrusively frequent, as to remind us of Bayes’ rule for writing dialogue, “ ever make a simile when you are surprised ;” and overlaying the plot with minute descriptions of dress and scenery, which the reader, after a little experience, is wise enough to avoid. In reading them we are constantly reminded of Boileau’s description of a tedious poetical landscape painter :</p><p>S'il rencontre un palais il m<hi rend="sup">,</hi>en décrit la face Il me promene apres de terrasse en terrasse,</p><p>Je saute vingt feuillets pour en trouver la fin,</p><p>Et je me sauve a peine au travers du jardin.</p><p>The best imitation of Sir Walter Scott’s manner with which we are acquainted is the anonymous romance of <hi rend="italic">Forman,</hi>  of which he speaks with respect in his criticism on Mrs. Radcliffe. The romances of Mr. James, too, though not indicating much depth, are pleasing, always written with good feeling, and with a plot which excites a sort of quiet interest, if it does not keep the mind in the chain of curiosity or suspense. The novels of Cooper, who is probably better known than any other of the imitators of Scott, seem to be considerably overrated. On shipboard, or on an Indian heath, he is striking and picturesque ; but among civilized society, and, above all, in his attempts to catch the ease of fashion, we must regard him as singularly unsuccessful.</p><p>A strange contrast to the spirit of Scott’s novels was exhibited in the sceptical and dreary tone of <hi rend="italic">Anastasius. </hi>Without force of character-painting, with much languor in parts, and too prolonged a detail of heartlessness and vil-lany, the work fascinates by its strength, and towards the close, when the character ofthe hero deepens, by its irresistible pathos. Commencing with the levity of a Greek Gil Blas, it modulates into a key of sadness and desolation of spirit, which reminds us ofthe close of <hi rend="italic">St. Leon.</hi>  Fiction has few pictures which will bear comparison with that of <hi rend="italic">Anastasias,</hi>  sitting on the steps of the lazaretto of Trieste, with his dying boy in his arms ; and the whole conclusion of the romance, the sudden meeting and silent partingwithSpiridion, the journey towards the north, the dream, the warning voice, which, in the dusky light of daybreak, tells him he has not far to go; the hopelessness, the resignation of his death, all leave</p><p>on the mind that profound impression of the mutability and nothingness of existence, which Wordsworth has described:</p><p>So fades, so languishes, grows dim and dies,</p><p>All that this world is proud of. From their spheres The stars of human glory are cast down,</p><p>Perish the roses and the flowers of kings.</p><p>It is not our intention to pursue this sketch through the works of our living ornaments of the literature of fiction, or of some who have recently been taken from amongst us. We shall merely notice, that among those who have struck out an independent path for themselves, are the author of <hi rend="italic">Valerius</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">Adam Blair,</hi>  works of conspicuous originality, particularly the first, in which the difficult task of imparting a deep interest to a classical subject is performed with complete success ; the author of the <hi rend="italic">Trials of Margaret Lindsay,</hi>  and the <hi rend="italic">Lights and Shadows of Scottish Life,</hi>  who, with the finest feeling of the dignity and poetry which lie within the humble rural life of Scotland, has performed for its more pathetic and elevated aspect, what Galt, in his <hi rend="italic">Annals of the Parish,</hi>  and his other tales, has done for its humours and its vulgarities ; the authoress of <hi rend="italic">Marriage, </hi>the <hi rend="italic">Inheritance,</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">Destiny,</hi>  and Sir E. L. Bulwer, who has given proof of very versatile ability, in a series of romances widely differing in character, from the levity of <hi rend="italic">Pelham</hi>  down to the earnestness of <hi rend="italic">Maltravers,</hi>  but the best of which we think his more matured taste and judgment may yet surpass.</p><p>No country has produced more novelists than Italy ; but the Italian novel bears little analogy to what we understand by the term. Their novels were, in fact, originally prose versions of the same short tales, sometimes heroic, but more frequently turning on themes of gallantry or comic adventure, which formed the favourite subjects of the Trouveres. They were Fabliaux translated into Italian ; and this character they retained for five centuries from Boccaccio to Gozzi. (1313—1786.) The incidents are generally briefly given; there is little development of character or sentiment; or, where these are found, they exhibit rather separate scenes from life than any thing having the interest of a compact whole. But if the incidents and characters have little development, the Italian novelists have indemnified themselves for this confinement, by indulging in the utmost license of a pompous, circuitous, and unmeaning style. The facile beauty of the Italian language, “ Che spande di <hi rend="italic">parlar</hi>  si <hi rend="italic">largo</hi>  frame,’’has been the bane of their novelists. Boccaccio, the first and by far the greatest of the Italian novelists, indeed manages to impart to it a sort of garrulous grace ; but in the hands of his imitators the contrast between the poverty of the idea and the rich garb of words with which it is invested, assumes a ludicrous effect.</p><p>Never, perhaps, among so many novelists, was there so little of novelty. Instead of imitating nature, their avowed principle was to imitate Boccaccio, who, imparting to every thing a soft and rose-coloured glow, was himself not remarkable for the closeness of his adherence to it. And hence regarding the novel merely as a theme upon which they were to display all the brilliant variations of which the music of Italian speech was susceptible, they were contented to repeat in a great measure the same themes, to borrow, with a sort of easy impudence, their incidents from Boccaccio or from each other ; and more anxious for the purity of their Tuscan than of their tales, of which by far the greater number turn on scenes of licentiousness or low humour, they seemed to think all other merits in the novel subordinate to that of being “ written in very choice Italian.”</p><p>Beyond the limits of Italy, Bandello (1554) and Cintio (whose <hi rend="italic">Hecatommithi</hi>  appeared in 1565,) are almost the only novelists whose names are known to foreigners, if we except the <hi rend="italic">Belphegαr</hi>  of the versatile Macchiavelli ; and</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
