a county of England, taking its name from Somerton, once the capital, between 50⁰ and 51⁰ 27' north latitude, and between 1⁰ 25' and 2⁰ 59' weſt longitude. It is bounded on the west by Devonſhire, on the ſouth by Dorſetſhire, on the north by Briſtol Channel or the Severn Sea, on the north-eaſt by a ſmall part of Glouceſterſhire, and on the eaſt by Wiltſhire. It is one of the largeſt counties in England, extending in length from eaſt to weſt about 68 miles ; in breadth, where breadeſt, from ſouth to north, about 47 ; and 240 in circumference. It is divided into 42 hundreds, in which are 3 cities, 32 market towns, 1700 villages, 385 pariſhes of which 132 are vicarages, containing more than 1,000,000 of acres, and about 300,000 ſouls. It sends 18 members to Parliament, viz. two for the county, two for Briſtol, two for Bath, two for Wells, two forTaunton, two for Bridgewater, two for Ilcheſter, two for Milbourn-port, and two for Minehead.</p><p>The air of this county is very mild and wholeſome, eſpecially that of the hilly part. The ſoil in general is exceeding rich, ſo that ſingle acres very commonly produce forty or fifty buſhels of wheat, and there have been inſtances of ſome producing sixty of barley. As there is very fine paſture both for ſheep and black cattle, it abounds in both, which are as large as thoſe of<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0610.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s04-0604"/>

In the hilly parts are found coal, lead, copper, and lapis calaminaris. Wood thrives in it as well as in any county oſ the kingdom. It abounds alſo in peaſe, beans, beer, cyder, fruit, wildfowl, and ſalmon ; and its mineral waters are celebrated all over the world.</p><p>The riches of this county, both natural and acquired, exceed thoſe of any other in the kingdom, Middlesex and Yorkſhire excepted. The woollen manufacture in all its branches is carried on to a very great extent ; and in ſome parts of the county great quantities of linen are made. If to theſe the produce of various Other commodities in which it abounds is added, the amount of the whole muſt undoubtedly be very great. Its foreign trade muſt alſo be allowed to be very extenſive, when it is conſidered that it has a large trade for ſea coal, and poſſeſſes, beſides other ports, that of Briſtol, a town of the greateſt trade in England, next to London.</p><p>Beſides ſmall ſtreams, it is well watered and ſupplied with fiſh by the rivers Severn, Avon, Parrel, Froome, Ax, Torre, and Tone.
