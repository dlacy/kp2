<p><span class="font1">Sassanid government tried to suppress the use of the Greek language. But the government of Theodosius II. officially&nbsp;supported the enterprise of translating the Bible into Armenian&nbsp;(Mesrob had just invented the Armenian alphabet), and this&nbsp;initiated the production of an abundant literature of translations from the Greek, which secured the perpetual connexion&nbsp;of Armenia with European culture, and not with Oriental. This&nbsp;reign is also distinguished by the building of the great landwalls&nbsp;of Constantinople, by the foundation of a university there and&nbsp;by the collection of the imperial laws in the Codex Thcodosianus,&nbsp;which is a mine of material for the social condition of the&nbsp;Empire. It reveals to us the decline of municipal liberty,&nbsp;the decay of the middle classes in the West, the evils of the&nbsp;oppressive fiscal system and an appalling paralysis of Roman&nbsp;administration which had once been so efficient; it shows how&nbsp;the best-intentioned emperors were unable to control the&nbsp;governors and check their corruption; and discloses a disorganization which facilitated the dismemberment of the Empire by&nbsp;the barbarians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the reign of Zcno it seemed probable that an Ostrogothic kingdom would be established in the Balkan peninsula, but the&nbsp;danger was diverted to Italy (see </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Goths).</span><span class="font1"> The kingdom which&nbsp;Theodoric founded there was, in its constitutional aspect, a&nbsp;continuation of Odoacer<sup>i</sup>S regime. He, like Odoacer and&nbsp;Alaric, held the double position of a German king and a Roman&nbsp;official. He was </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">magistcr militum</span><span class="font1"> as well as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rex.</span><span class="font1"> His powers&nbsp;were defined by capitulations which were arranged with the&nbsp;emperor Anastasius and loyally observed. The right of&nbsp;legislation was reserved to the emperor, and Theodoric never&nbsp;claimed it; but for all practical purposes he was independent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the 6th century the emperor Justinian, whose talents were equal to his ambitions, found himself, through the financial&nbsp;prudence of his predecessors, in a position to undertake the&nbsp;reconquest of some of the lost western provinces. The Vandal&nbsp;power had declined, and Africa was won back in one campaign&nbsp;by Belisarius in 533. The conquest of Italy was far more&nbsp;difficult. Begun by Belisarius in 535, it was not completed&nbsp;till 554, by Narses. A portion of southern Spain was also&nbsp;won from the Visigoths, so that the Romans again commanded&nbsp;the western straits. Justinian, possessed by large ideas and&nbsp;intoxicated with the majesty of Rome, aspired to be a great&nbsp;conqueror, a great lawgiver, a great pontiff, a great diplomatist,&nbsp;a great builder, and in each of these spheres his reign holds a&nbsp;conspicuous place in the annals of the Empire. His legal work&nbsp;alone, or the building of Santa Sophia was enough to ensure&nbsp;him immortal fame. But deep shadows balance the splendour.&nbsp;The reconquest of Africa was thoroughly justified and advantageous, but Italy was bought at a ruinous cost. In the fir&amp;t place,&nbsp;the Persian empire was at this time ruled by one of its greatest&nbsp;kings, Chosroes I. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.),</span><span class="font1"> who was Jar from peacefully inclined.&nbsp;Justinian was engaged in a long Persian and a long Gothic war&nbsp;at the same time, and the state was unequal to the strain. In&nbsp;the second place, it was all-important for his western policy&nbsp;to secure the goodwill of the Italian provincials and the Roman&nbsp;bishop, and for this purpose he involved himself in an ecclesiastical policy (see below) which caused the final alienation of the&nbsp;Syrian and Egyptian prövinces. The reconquest of the West&nbsp;was purchased by the disunion 'of the East. Thirdly, the&nbsp;enormous expenses of the Italian and Persian wars, augmented&nbsp;by architectural undertakings, caused a policy of financial&nbsp;oppression which hung as a cloud over all the brilliance of his&nbsp;reign, and led to the decline which ensued upon his death. Nor&nbsp;is it to be forgotten that he had at the same time to fulfil the&nbsp;task of protecting the Danube against the Germans, Slavs&nbsp;and Bulgarians who constantly threatened the Illyrian provinces. He spared no expense in building forts and walls.&nbsp;Justinian's name will always be associated with that pf the&nbsp;gifted Theodora, an actress of doubtful fame in her early life,&nbsp;who shared his throne. Their mosaic portraits are preserved&nbsp;in the contemporary church of San Vitale at Ravenna. She&nbsp;possessed great political influence, and the fact that she was a&nbsp;heretic (monophysitc), while Justinian was devoted to orthodoxy,&nbsp;did not mar their harmony, but only facilitated the policy of&nbsp;extending secret favour to the heretics who were publicly&nbsp;condemned, and enabled the left hand to act without the knowledge of the right. The events of the half-century after Justinian's death exhibited the weakness to which his grandiose&nbsp;policy had reduced the Empire. It was attacked on the west, on&nbsp;the north and on the east, and at all points was unequal to coping&nbsp;with its enemies. (1) Italy fell a victim to the Lombards </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.),&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">and in a few years more than half of the peninsula had passed&nbsp;under their sway. (2) The Avars, a Hunnic people who had&nbsp;advanced from the Caspian, took possession of Pannonia and&nbsp;Dacia, and formed an empire, consisting of Slavonic and&nbsp;Bulgarian subjects, which endured for about sixty years. Their&nbsp;chief occupation was to invade the Illyrian peninsula and extort&nbsp;tribute and ransoms from the emperors. So far as the Avars&nbsp;themselves were concerned, these incursions had no permanent&nbsp;significance, but the Slavs who overran the provinces did more&nbsp;• than devastate. These years saw the beginning of the Slavonic&nbsp;settlements which changed the ethnical character of the peninsula, and thus mark the commencement of a new period.&nbsp;Slavs occupied Mocsia and a large part of Macedonia, even close&nbsp;to Thessalonica, which they besieged; they penetrated southward into Greece and made large settlements in the Peloponnesus (see </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Greece, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">History,</span><span class="font1"> “ Roman period/’ </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ad fin.).</span><span class="font1"> They&nbsp;occupied the north-western provinces, which became Croatia&nbsp;and Servia, as well as Dalmatia (except some of the coast&nbsp;towns). In the northern part of the peninsula the Slavonic&nbsp;element remained dominant, but in Greece it. was assimilated&nbsp;to the.Greek (after the 9th century) and has left little record&nbsp;of itself except in place names. (3) The Empire was simultaneously engaged in the perennial strife with Persia. A short&nbsp;interval of peace was secured when the emperor Maurice assisted&nbsp;Chosrocs II. to dethrone </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font1">usurper, but after Maurice’s death&nbsp;(602) the final and mortal struggle began (see </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Persia, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">History,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">section viii. “ The Sassanian Empire ”). Throughout the incompetent reign of Phocas the eastern provinces were overrun&nbsp;by the Persians, as the Illyrian were overrun by the Slavs.&nbsp;The unpopular rule of this cruel usurper was terminated in 610&nbsp;by the intervention of the governor of Africa, whose son Heraclius&nbsp;sailed to Constantinople and, welcomed by an influential party,&nbsp;met with little resistance. Phocas, murderer of Maurice, was -murdered by the people, and the victor was crowned emperor&nbsp;to find himself in presence of a desperate situation. Antioch,&nbsp;Damascus and many other great cities were captured by the&nbsp;Persians; and in 614 Jerusalem was destroyed and the Holy&nbsp;Cross, along with the patriarch, carried off to Ctesiphon. This&nbsp;event produced a profound sensation in Christendom. In 616&nbsp;Egypt was conquered. The army had fallen into utter disorder&nbsp;under Phocas, and HeracHus so deeply despaired of saving&nbsp;Constantinople that he thought of transferring the imperial&nbsp;capital to Carthage. But the extreme gravity of the situation&nbsp;seems to have wrought a moral change among his subjects;&nbsp;the patriarch Sergius was the mouthpiece of a widespread&nbsp;patriotic feeling, and it was not least through his influence that&nbsp;Heraclius performed the task of creating a capable army. His&nbsp;efforts were rewarded in a series of brilhant campaigns (622-28),&nbsp;which, in the emphasis laid on the contrast between Christianity&nbsp;and fire-worship and on the object of recovering the Cross, had&nbsp;the character of crusades. Heraclius recovered his provinces and&nbsp;held Persia at his mercy (decisive battle at Nineveh, end of 627).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This war is remarkable for the attempt of the Persians to take Constantinople (626) in conjunction with the Avars and Slavs.&nbsp;Soon afterwards the Avar power began to decay, and the Slavs&nbsp;and Bulgarians shook off their yoke. It seemed as if the Roman&nbsp;government would now be able to regain the control in the&nbsp;Illyrian lands which it had almost entirely lost. It seems&nbsp;probable that Heraclius came to terms with the Slavs—Croatians&nbsp;and Servians—in the north-west; their position was regularized,&nbsp;as vassals of the Empire. But fate allowed no breathing-time&nbsp;to do more; the darkest hour had hardly passed when a new&nbsp;storm-cloud, from an unexpected quarter, overspread the&nbsp;heavens.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
