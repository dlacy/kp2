<p><span class="font0">not “ his show on,” and the hen at all seasons, oiler no very remarkable deviation from ordinary sandpipers; outwardly@@<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>there is nothing, except the unequal size of the two sexes, to&nbsp;rouse suspicion of any abnormal peculiarity. But when spring&nbsp;comes all is changed. In a surprisingly short time the feathers&nbsp;clothing the face of the male are shed, and their place is taken&nbsp;by </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">papillae</span><span class="font0"> or small caruncles of bright yellow or pale pink.&nbsp;From each side of his head sprouts a tuft of stiff curled feathers,&nbsp;while the feathers of the throat change colour, and beneath&nbsp;and around it sprouts the frill or ruff already mentioned as&nbsp;giving the bird his name. The feathers which form this&nbsp;remarkable adornment are, like those of the “ ear-tufts,” stiff&nbsp;and incurved at the end, but much longer—measuring more&nbsp;than 2 in. They are closely arrayed, capable of depression&nbsp;or elevation, and form a shield to the front of the breast&nbsp;impenetrable by the bill of a rival.@@<sup>2</sup> More extraordinary than&nbsp;this, from one point of view, is the great variety of coloration&nbsp;that obtains in these temporary outgrowths. Considering the&nbsp;really few colours that the birds exhibit, the variation is something marvellous, so that fifty examples may be compared&nbsp;without finding a very close resemblance between any two of</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">them, while the individual variation is increased by the <sup>u</sup> ear-tufts,” which generally differ in colour from the frill. The colours range from deep black to pure white, passing through&nbsp;chestnut or bay, and many tints of brown or ashy-grey, while&nbsp;often the feathers are more or less closely barred with some&nbsp;darker shade, and the black is very frequently glossed with&nbsp;violet, blue or green—or, in addition, spangled with white&nbsp;grey or gold-colour. The white, on the other hand, is not&nbsp;rarely freckled, streaked, or barred with grey, rufous-brown&nbsp;or black. In some examples the barring is most regularly&nbsp;concentric, in others more or less broken-up or undulating,&nbsp;and the latter may be said of the streaks. It was ascertained&nbsp;by Montagu, and has since been confirmed by A. D. Bartlett,&nbsp;that every ruff assumes tufts and frill exactly the same in&nbsp;colour and markings as those he wore in the preceding season;&nbsp;and thus, polymorphic as is the male as a species, as an individual&nbsp;he is unchangeable. The white frill is said to be the rarest,&nbsp;and birds exhibiting it have white necks even in winter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">That all this wonderful “ show ” is the consequence of the polygamous habit of the ruff can scarcely be doubted. No</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@1 </sup>Internally there Is a great difference in the form of the posterior margin of the sternum, as long ago remarked by Nitzsch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@2 </sup>This “ ruff ” has been compared Jo that of Elizabethan or Jacobean costume, but it is essentially different, since that was open&nbsp;in front and widest and most projecting behind, whereas the bird’s&nbsp;decorative apparel is most developed in front and at the sides and&nbsp;scarcely exists behind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">other species of Limicoline bird has, so far as is </span><span class="font1">known, </span><span class="font0">any tendency to it. Indeed, in many species of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Limicolae,</span><span class="font0"> as the&nbsp;dotterel, the godwits (g.v.), phalaropes and perhaps some&nbsp;others, the female is larger and more brightly coloured than&nbsp;the male, who in such cases seems to take upon himself some&nbsp;at least of the domestic duties. Both Montagu and Graves, to&nbsp;say nothing of other writers, state that the ruffs, in England,&nbsp;were far more numerous than the reeves; and their testimony&nbsp;can hardly be doubted; though in Germany J. F. Naumann&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Veg. Deutschland’s,</span><span class="font0"> vii. p. 544) considers that this is only the&nbsp;case in the earlier part of the season, and that later the females&nbsp;greatly outnumber the males. By no one have the ruff’s&nbsp;characteristics been more happily described than by J. Wolley,&nbsp;in a communication to W. C. Hewitson </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Eggs of Brit. Birds,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">3d ed., p. 346), as follows:—</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ The ruff, like other fine gentlemen, takes much more trouble with his courtship than with his duties as a husband. \\ hilst the&nbsp;reeves are sitting on their, eggs, scattered about the swamps, he&nbsp;is to.be seen far away flitting about in flocks, and on the ground&nbsp;dancing and sparring with his companions. Before they are confined to their nests, it is wonderful with what devotion tne females&nbsp;are attended by their gay followers, who seem to be each trying to&nbsp;be more attentive than the rest. Nothing can be more expressive&nbsp;of humility and ardent love than some of the actions of the ruff.&nbsp;He throws himself prostrate on the ground, with every feather on&nbsp;his body standing up and quivering; but he seems as if he were&nbsp;afraid of coming too near his mistress. If she flies off, he starts&nbsp;up in an instant to arrive before her at the next place of alighting,&nbsp;and all his actions are full of life and spirit. But none of his spirit&nbsp;is expended in care for his family. He never comes to see after an&nbsp;enemy. In the [Lapland] marshes, a reeve now and then flies&nbsp;near with a scarcely audible </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ka-ka-kuk\</span><span class="font0"> but she.seems a dull bird,&nbsp;and makes no noisy attack on an invader.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The breeding-grounds of the ruff extend from Great Britain across N. Europe and Asia; but the birds become less numerous&nbsp;towards the E. They winter in India, reaching even Ceylon,&nbsp;and Africa as far as the Cape of Good Hope. The ruff also&nbsp;occasionally visits Iceland, ahd there are several well-authenticated records of its occurrence on the E. coast of the United&nbsp;States, while an example is stated </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Ibis,</span><span class="font0"> 1875, p. 332) to have&nbsp;been received from the N. of S. America.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A. N.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RUFFIAN (Fr. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rufian,</span><span class="font0"> It. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ruffiand),</span><span class="font0"> a brutal, violent person, a swaggering, low bully. The etymology is obscure, but the&nbsp;word has been connected with “ ruffler,” a bully, swaggerer, one&nbsp;who “ruffles” (M. Du. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">roffieln,</span><span class="font0"> to pander). An early derivation,&nbsp;quoted in Du Cange, derives it from Lat. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rufus,</span><span class="font0"> red, as the hair&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">meretrices,</span><span class="font0"> with whom the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ruffiani</span><span class="font0"> were generally associated, was red or gold, as contrasted with the black hair of sober&nbsp;matrons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RUFFO, FABRIZIO (1744-1827), Neapolitan cardinal and politician, was born at San Lucido in Calabria on the 16th of&nbsp;September 1744. His father, Litterio Ruffo, was duke of Baran-ello, and his mother, Giustiniana, was of the family of Colonna.&nbsp;Fabrizio owed his education to his uncle, the cardinal Thomas&nbsp;Ruffo, then dean of the Sacred College. In early life he secured&nbsp;the favour of Giovanni Angelo Braschi di Cesera, who in 1775&nbsp;became Pope Pius VI. Ruffo was placed by the pope among the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">chierici di camera—</span><span class="font0">the clerks who formed the papal civil and&nbsp;financial service. He was later promoted to be treasurer-general,&nbsp;a post which carried with it the ministry of war. Ruffo’s conduct&nbsp;in office was diversely judged. Collett a, the historian of Naples,&nbsp;speaks of him as corrupt, and Jomini repeats the charge. Ruffo’s&nbsp;biographer, Sachinclli, says that he incurred hostility by restricting the feudal powers of some of the landowners in the papal&nbsp;states. In 1791 he was removed from the treasurership, but. was&nbsp;created cardinal on the 29th of September, though he was not&nbsp;in orders. He never became a priest. Ruffo went to Naples,&nbsp;where he was named administrator of the royal domain of&nbsp;Caserta, and received the abbey of S. Sophia in Benevento&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">in cammendam.</span><span class="font0"> When in December 1798 the French troops&nbsp;advanced on Naples, Ruffo fled to Palermo with the royal&nbsp;family. He was chosen to head a royalist movement in Calabria,</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
