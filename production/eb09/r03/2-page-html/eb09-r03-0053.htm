        <p><span class="font2">The strength of this system was now to be tried by a struggle with
                the one Italian people who were still ready&nbsp;and able to contest with Rome the
                supremacy of the&nbsp;peninsula. The passive attitude of the Samnites
                between&nbsp;342 and 327 was no doubt largely due to the dangers&nbsp;which had
                suddenly threatened them in South Italy.&nbsp;But the death of Alexander of Epirus,
                in 332,@@<sup>1</sup> removed </span><span class="font0">∣</span><span class="font2"
                >&nbsp;their only formidable opponent there, and left them free&nbsp;to turn their
                attention to the necessity of checking the&nbsp;steady advance of Rome. In 327, the
                year after the&nbsp;ominous foundation of a Roman colony at Fregellæ, a&nbsp;pretext
                for renewing the struggle was offered them. The&nbsp;Cumæan colony of
                    Palæpolis@@<sup>2</sup> had incurred the wrath&nbsp;of Rome by its raids into
                her territory in Campania. The&nbsp;Samnites sent a force to defend it, and Rome
                replied by a&nbsp;declaration of war. The two opponents were not at first
                <sub></sub>sight unequally matched, and had the Sabellian tribes held&nbsp;firmly
                together the issue of the struggle might have been&nbsp;different. As it was,
                however, the Lucanians to the south&nbsp;actually joined Rome from the first, while
                the northern&nbsp;clans Marsi, Vestini, Pæligni, Erentani, after a feeble
                and&nbsp;lukewarm resistance, subsided into a neutrality which&nbsp;was exchanged in
                304 for a formal alliance with Rome.&nbsp;An even greater advantage to Rome from the
                outset was the&nbsp;enmity existing between Samnites and the Apulians,
                the&nbsp;latter of whom from the first joined Rome and thus gave&nbsp;her a position
                in the rear of her enemy and in a country&nbsp;eminently well fitted for maintaining
                a large military&nbsp;force. These weaknesses on the Samnite side were
                amply&nbsp;illustrated by the events of the war.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">The first seven or eight years were marked by one serious disaster to
                the Roman arms, the defeat at the&nbsp;Caudine Forks (321), but, when in 318 the
                Samnites&nbsp;asked for and obtained a two years’ truce, Rome had&nbsp;succeeded not
                only in inflicting several severe blows upon&nbsp;her enemies but in isolating them
                from outside help. The&nbsp;Lucanians to the south were her allies. To the
                east,&nbsp;in the rear of Samnium, Apulia acknowledged the suzerainty of Rome, and
                Luceria, captured in 320, had been&nbsp;established as a base of Roman operations.
                Finally to&nbsp;the north the Romans had easily overcome the feeble&nbsp;resistance
                of the Vestini and Frentani, and secured&nbsp;through their territories a safe
                passage for their legions to&nbsp;Apulia. On the renewal of hostilities in 316, the
                Samnites,&nbsp;bent on escaping from the net which was being slowly&nbsp;drawn round
                them, made a series of desperate efforts to&nbsp;break through the lines of defence
                which protected Latium&nbsp;and Campania. Sora and Fregellæ on the upper Liris
                were&nbsp;captured by a sudden attack; the Ausones in the low&nbsp;country near the
                mouth of the same river were encouraged&nbsp;to revolt by the appearance of the
                Samnite army; and in&nbsp;Campania another army, attracted by rumours of
                disturbance, all but defeated the Roman consuls under the very&nbsp;walls of Capua.
                But these efforts were unavailing. Sora&nbsp;and Fregellæ were recovered as quickly
                as they had been&nbsp;lost, and the frontier there was strengthened by the
                establishment of a colony at Interamna. The Ausones were&nbsp;punished by the
                confiscation of their territory, and Roman&nbsp;supremacy further secured by the two
                colonies of Suessa&nbsp;and Pontia (312). The construction of the famous
                    Via&nbsp;Appia,@@<sup>3</sup> the work of the censor Appius Claudius
                Cæcus,&nbsp;opened a safe and direct route to Campania, while the&nbsp;capture of
                Nola deprived the Samnites of their last&nbsp;important stronghold in the Campanian
                lowlands. The&nbsp;failure of these attempts broke the courage even of
                the&nbsp;Samnites. Their hopes were indeed raised for a moment&nbsp;by the news that
                Etruria had risen against Rome (310),&nbsp;but their daring scheme of effecting a
                union with the&nbsp;Etruscans was frustrated by the energy of the Roman</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">generals. Five years later (305) the Romans revenged a Samnite raid
                into Campania by an invasion of Samuium&nbsp;itself. Arpinum on the frontier was
                taken, and at last,&nbsp;after a twenty-two years’ struggle, the Second Samnite
                War&nbsp;was closed by a renewal of the ancient treaty with
                    Rome&nbsp;(304).@@<sup>4</sup></span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">The six years of peace which followed (304-298) were
                characteristically employed by Rome in still further&nbsp;strengthening her
                position. Already, two years before&nbsp;the peace, a rash revolt of the
                    Hernici@@<sup>5</sup> had given Rome&nbsp;a pretext for finally annexing the
                territory of her ancient&nbsp;allies. The tribal confederacy was broken up, and
                all&nbsp;the Hernican communities, with the exception of three&nbsp;which had not
                joined the revolt, were incorporated with&nbsp;the Roman state as municipia, with
                the civil rights of&nbsp;the Roman franchise. Between the Hernican valley
                and&nbsp;the frontiers of the nearest Sabellian tribes lay what&nbsp;remained of the
                once formidable people of the Æqui. In&nbsp;their case, too, a revolt (304) was
                followed by the annexation of their territory, which was marked in this case
                by&nbsp;the formation there (301) of two Roman tribes (Aniensis&nbsp;and
                    Teretina).@@<sup>6</sup> Not content with thus carrying the&nbsp;borders of
                their own territory up to the very frontiers of&nbsp;the Sabellian country, Rome
                succeeded in finally detaching&nbsp;from the Sabellianconfederacyall the tribes
                    lying@@<sup>7</sup> between&nbsp;the north-east frontier of Latium and the
                Adriatic Sea.&nbsp;Henceforward the Marsi, Pæligni, Vestini, Marrucini,
                and&nbsp;Frentani were enrolled among the allies of Rome, and not&nbsp;only swelled
                her forces in the field but interposed a useful&nbsp;barrier between her enemies to
                the north in Etruria and&nbsp;Umbria and those to the south in Samnium, while
                they&nbsp;connected her directly with the friendly Apulians. Lastly,&nbsp;as a
                security for the fidelity at least of the nearest of these&nbsp;allies, colonies
                were planted in the Marsian territories at&nbsp;Carseoli and at Alba Fucentia. A
                significant indication&nbsp;of the widening range of Rome’s influence in Italy, and
                of&nbsp;the new responsibilities rapidly pressing upon her, is the&nbsp;fact that
                when in 302 the Spartan Cleonymus landed in&nbsp;the territory of the Sallentini,
                far away in the south-east,&nbsp;he was met and repulsed by a Roman
                    force.@@<sup>8</sup></span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">Six years after the conclusion of the treaty which ended the Second
                Samnite AVar, news arrived that the Samnites&nbsp;were harassing the Lucanians. Rome
                at once interfered&nbsp;to protect her allies. Samnium was invaded in force,
                the&nbsp;country ravaged, and one stronghold after another captured. Unable any
                longer to hold their own in a position&nbsp;where they were hedged round by enemies,
                the Samnite&nbsp;leaders turned as a last hope to the communities of
                northern&nbsp;Etruria, to the free tribes of Umbria, and to the once&nbsp;dreaded
                Celts. With a splendid daring they formed the&nbsp;scheme of uniting all these
                peoples with themselves in&nbsp;a last desperate effort to break the power of
                Rome.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">For some forty years after the final annexation of southern Etruria
                (351 </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.)</span><span
                class="font2"> matters had remained unchanged in that quarter. Sutrium and Nepete
                still&nbsp;guarded the Roman frontier; the natural boundary of the&nbsp;Ciminian
                forest was still intact; and up the valley of the&nbsp;Tiber Rome had not advanced
                beyond Falerii, a few miles&nbsp;short of the most southerly Umbrian town
                Ocriculum.&nbsp;But in 311, on the expiry, apparently, of the long truce&nbsp;with
                Rome, concluded in 351, the northern Etruscans,&nbsp;alarmed no doubt by the rapid
                advances which Rome was&nbsp;making further south, rose in arms and attacked
                Sutrium.&nbsp;The attack, however, recoiled disastrously upon the heads&nbsp;of the
                assailants. A Roman force promptly relieved&nbsp;Sutrium, and its leader, Q. Fabius
                Rullianus, without&nbsp;awaiting orders from home, boldly plunged into the
                wilds&nbsp;of the Ciminian forest, and crossing them safely swept</span></p>
