Sir George struck his flag with a feeling of disappointment at not obtaining the&nbsp;governorship of Jamaica, and was shortly after forced to&nbsp;settle in Paris. Election expenses and losses at play in&nbsp;fashionable circles had shattered his fortune and now&nbsp;broke up his family till the eve of war with France. In&nbsp;February 1778, having just been promoted admiral of the&nbsp;White, he used every possible exertion to obtain a command from the Admiralty, to free himself from his money&nbsp;difficulties. By May he had, through the splendid generosity of his Parisian friend Maréchal Biron, effected the&nbsp;latter task, and accordingly he returned to London with&nbsp;his children. Sir George was enabled to remit at once to&nbsp;his benefactor the full loan, and it is worthy of record that&nbsp;the English Government in later years awarded pensions&nbsp;to the maréchal’s daughters in recognition of their father’s&nbsp;chivalrous act.</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> That an attempt was made by the French&nbsp;ministry during the war crisis to seduce Rodney into&nbsp;accepting high rank in the French navy is undeniable&nbsp;from the evidence we possess, but the details of the common version must be accepted with reserve, excepting the&nbsp;undoubted instant rejection of the offer. To the English&nbsp;cabinet the honour of both Rodney and Biron remained&nbsp;untarnished, if we may judge of the former by his letters,&nbsp;public and private, and of the latter by the pension&nbsp;awarded to his relatives.</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Sir George was appointed once more commander-in-chief of the Leeward Islands, 1st October 1779, but did not sail&nbsp;till 29th December. He captured a Spanish convoy bound&nbsp;to Cadiz on 8th January 1780, and eight days later defeated&nbsp;the Spanish admiral Don Juan de Langara off Cape St&nbsp;Vincent, taking or destroying seven ships. On 17th April&nbsp;an action, which, owing to the carelessness of some of&nbsp;Rodney’s captains, was indecisive, was fought off Martinique&nbsp;with the French admiral Guichen. Rodney, acting under&nbsp;orders, captured the valuable entrepot of St Eustatius,&nbsp;and by his strong measures for stopping illegal and contraband trade evoked an attempt at censure on the part of&nbsp;his political opponents. After a few months in England,&nbsp;recruiting his health and defending himself in parliament,&nbsp;Sir George returned to his command in February 1782,&nbsp;and a running engagement with the French fleet on 9th&nbsp;April led up to his crowning victory off Dominica, when&nbsp;on 12th April with thirty-five sail of the line he defeated&nbsp;Comte de Grasse, who had thirty-three sail. The French&nbsp;inferiority in numbers was more than counterbalanced by&nbsp;the greater size and superior sailing qualities of their ships,&nbsp;yet five were taken and one sunk, after eleven hours’ fighting. This important battle saved Jamaica and ruined&nbsp;French naval prestige, while it enabled Rodney to write—&nbsp;“ Within two little years I have taken two Spanish, one&nbsp;French, and one Dutch admirals.” A long and wearisome&nbsp;controversy exists as to the originator of the manœuvre of&nbsp;“ breaking the line ” in this battle, but the merits of the&nbsp;victory have never seriously been affected by any difference of opinion on the question. A shift of wind broke&nbsp;the French line of battle, and advantage was taken of&nbsp;this by the English ships in two places.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rodney arrived home in August to receive unbounded honour from his country. He had already been created&nbsp;Baron Rodney of Rodney Stoke, Somerset, by patent of&nbsp;19th June 1782, and the House of Commons had voted&nbsp;him a pension of £2000 a year.

Next&nbsp;to Nelson we may fairly place Rodney, not only because&nbsp;of his well-merited successes, but for masterly decision and&nbsp;confident boldness in grappling with fleets of the three&nbsp;chief maritime states of Europe while in the plenitude of&nbsp;their power. He fought his equals in naval science, but&nbsp;conquered by superior practical skill.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RODOSTO, a town of European Turkey, in the sandjak of Tekfur Daghi or Rodosto in the vilayet of Adrianople&nbsp;(Edirne), is situated on the coast of the Sea of Marmora&nbsp;about midway between Gallipoli and Constantinople. Its&nbsp;picturesque bay is enclosed by the great promontory of&nbsp;Combos, a spur about 2000 feet in height from the hilly&nbsp;plateau to the north, and round about the town are stately&nbsp;cypress groves. The church of Panagia Rhevmatocratissa&nbsp;contains the graves, with long Latin inscriptions, of the&nbsp;Hungarian exiles of 1696. Rodosto has long been a great&nbsp;depot for the produce of the Adrianople district, but its&nbsp;trade has suffered considerably since Dedeagatch became&nbsp;the terminus of the railway up the Maritza. In 1880 the&nbsp;value of exports and imports was £230,824. The population, formerly about 30,000, was in 1840 about 10,000, and&nbsp;at present (1885) may be estimated at 17,000, about half&nbsp;Turks, a quarter Armenians, and the remainder Greeks,&nbsp;Jews, and Latins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rodosto is the ancient Rhædestus or Bisanthe, said to have been founded by Samians. In Xenophon’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Anabasis</span><span class="font0"> it is mentioned as&nbsp;in the kingdom of the Thracian prince Seuthes. Its restoration&nbsp;by Justinian is chronicled by Procopius. In 813 and again in&nbsp;1206 it was destroyed by the Bulgarians, but it continues to appear&nbsp;as a place of considerable note in later Byzantine history, being&nbsp;captured and recaptured in successive wars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RODRIGUEZ, an island in the Indian Ocean in 19° 41' S. lat. and 63° 23' E. long., which, after the Seychelles,&nbsp;forms since 1814 the most important dependency of the&nbsp;British colony of Mauritius, from which it is distant 344&nbsp;nautical miles. It is the easternmost of all the islands considered as belonging to Africa. &quot;With a length of 13 miles&nbsp;east and west and a breadth of 3 to 6 north and south it has&nbsp;an area estimated at 42∣ square miles. On all sides it is&nbsp;surrounded by a coral reef, which on the north and south&nbsp;forms a large flat area partly dry at low water. The island&nbsp;proper was long believed to consist of granite overlaid&nbsp;with limestone and other modern formations, and thus it&nbsp;was regarded as a striking exception to the rule that all&nbsp;mid-ocean islands are of volcanic origin, and served in the&nbsp;hands of Peschel and others as a proof of the former existence in the Indian Ocean of the hypothetical continent of&nbsp;Lemuria. The investigations of the Transit of Venus Expedition have shown that it is built up of “ doleritic lavas&nbsp;which have been poured out at a considerable number of&nbsp;orifices,” now difficult to identify, at successive periods of&nbsp;uncertain date. The lavas are rich in olivine. In some&nbsp;places, as in the Cascade Valley, the disintegration of the&nbsp;rocks has produced beds of earthy clays varying in colour&nbsp;from a dull brick red to a liver brown, and forming a&nbsp;prominent feature in the landscape. A central ridge of&nbsp;considerable elevation (Grande Montagne, 1140 feet) runs&nbsp;through the island from east to west, sending off a variety&nbsp;of spurs (Le Piton, 1160 feet). Deep-cut river valleys,&nbsp;often interrupted by cascades, run down in all directions&nbsp;to the sea. On the south-west there is a large plain of&nbsp;coralline limestone, remarkable for the caves of all sizes&nbsp;(some beautifully stalactitic) with which it is riddled.</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
