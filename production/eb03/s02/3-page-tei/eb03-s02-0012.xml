Maxwell and Lochinvar made ſuch diſpatch, that they were in poſſeſſion of the town when the Douglaſſes appeared before it, and repulſed them; while a moſt terrible ſtorm had ſcattered the troops under James before he could come to their aſſiſtance, ſo effectually, that, being left almoſt without attendants, his perſon might have been taken by the ſmalleſt party of the enemy. Upon the retreat of the Douglaſſes from Edinburgh, the parhament met; and none of them appearing in purſuance of their ſummons, the earl of Angus, his brother Sir George Douglas, his uncle Archibald Douglas, and Alexander Drummond of Carnock, with ſome of their chief dependents, were indicted and forfeited for the following offences: “The aſſembling of the king’s lieges, with intention to have aſſailed his perſon; the detaining of the king againſt his will and pleaſure, and contrary to the articles agreed upon, for the ſpace of two years and more; all which time the king was in fear and danger of his life.” We know of no advocate for the earl and his friends but one Banantyne, who had the courage to plead their cauſe againſt thoſe heinous charges; and ſo exaſperated were both the king and parliament againſt them, that the former ſwore he never would forgive them, and the latter that they never would intercede for their pardon. Thus it was not deemed ſufficient ſimply to declare their reſolutions; but the ſolemnity of oaths was added with an intention to diſcourage the king of England from continuing the vigorous applications he was every day making, by letters and otherwiſe, for the pardon of Angus; and to ſhut out all hopes of that kind, James created his mother’s third huſband (to whom ſhe had been married for ſome time) lord Methven, and gave him the direction of his artillery.</p><p>The diſgrace and forfeiture of the Douglaſſes having created many vacancies in the ſtate, Gavin Dunbar, archbiſhop of Glaſgow, and tutor to the king, was nominated lord chancellor, though but indifferently qualified for a poſt that ought to have been filled by an able, ſtateſman; and Robert Carncroſs, a perſon (ſays Buchanan) more eminent for wealth than virtue, was made treaſurer: but this laſt was ſoon after diſplaced, being ſuſpected of favouring the Douglaſſes; and Robert Barton, one of the king’s favourites, was appointed to ſucceed him. The Douglaſſes ſtill kept their arms; and being joined by a great number of outlaws and robbers in the ſouth, they ravaged all the lands of their enemies, carrying their devaſtations to the very gates of Edinburgh. A commiſſion of lieutenancy was offered to the earl of Bothwell to act againſt thoſe rebels: but he declining it, it was accepted by the earl of Argyle and lord Hume, who did great ſervice in protecting the country from the outlaws. Several villages, however, in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh, were burnt; and all the proviſions the Douglaſſes could find were carried off to their caſtle of Tantallon, which now ſerved as their head-quarters, and was threatened with a ſiege.</p><p>It is remarkable, that the caſtle of Dunbar remained ſtill in the hands of the duke of Albany’s garriſon, who recogniſed no maſter but him. The place was well ſtored with artillery of all kinds; and lying in the neighbourhood of Tantallon, it was eaſy to tranſport them to the ſiege: but James thought he had no right to make uſe of them without the conſent of one Maurice, governor of the caſtle. Having ſummoned, by proclamation, the inhabitants of Fife, Angus, Stratfiern, Stirlingſhire, Lothian, Merſe, and Teviotdale, to be ready to compear at Edinburgh on the 10th of December, with 40 days victuals, to aſſiſt in the ſiege, he ſent three noblemen to borrow artillery from Maurice, and to remain as pledges for the ſafe redelivery of the  ſame; and the ſeveral pieces required were accordingly ſent him. This delicacy is the more remarkable, as we are told that the duke of Albany had given orders that every thing in his caſtle ſhould be at the king’s ſervice. However unanimous the parliament might appear againſt the Douglaſſes, yet James was but ill-ſeconded in this attempt. The unfortunate, if ſeverely proceeded againſt, generally find friends; and the enemies of the Douglaſſes had impolitically rendered it treaſonable for any perſon to ſhelter or protect the earl of Angus, his kinsmen, or followers. This proceeding, in a country where the Douglaſſes had ſo many connections, carried with it an appearance of cruelty and a thirſt of revenge, eſpecially as James had choſen ſuch a ſeaſon of the year for carrying on the ſiege. In ſhort, after battering the place for ſome days, and loſing one Falconer, his chief engineer, the king was obliged to abandon his enterpriſe, or rather to turn the ſiege into a blockade, with no great credit to his firſt eſſiry in the field. Some hiſtorians intimate, that Angus found means to corrupt the other engineers; but we find, that before this time, a negociation was going forward between James and the king of England; the nature of which proves that the former was now rendered more placable towards the Douglaſſes, and was the true reaſon why the ſiege was ſuſpended.</p><p>The truce between Scotland and England was now- near expiring; and Henry, under that pretence, gave a commiſſion to the prior of Durham, Thomas Magnus, Sir Anthony Ughtred captain of the town and caſtle of Berwick, William Frankelyn chancellor of Durham, and Sir Thomas Tempeſt. James ſeems to have been in no haſte to enter upon this negociation, becauſe he underſtood that the Engliſh commiſſioners were privately inſtructed to inſiſt upon the Douglaſſes being reſtored to their eſtates and dignities. England was at that time the principal ally of Francis againſt the emperor; and this gave a handle for Francis to interpoſe ſo far in favour of the Douglaſſes, that he brought James to conſent to a preliminary negociation for their obtaining at leaſt a ſecure retreat in England. This was at laſt complied with.</p><p>James being now delivered from all dread of the Douglaſſes, and under no controul from any party, ſhowed excellent dſſpoſitions for government. Finding that the borderers were by no means pleaſed with the late treaty, and that they were renewing their depredations, he reſolved to ſtrike at the root of an evil which had ſo long proved diſgraceful and dangerous to his anceſtors, by giving no quarter to the chiefs of theſe robbers, whoſe principal reſidence was in Liddeſdale. This was the more neceſſary, as their daring attempts had exaſperated the Engliſh ſo much, that they had actually burnt a town in Teviotdale; and they had killed one Robert</p></body></text></TEI>
