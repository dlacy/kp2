<p><span class="font0">distance to march, Kuroki the smallest. The latter therefore had to stand fast in the face of the Russian Eastern Detachment,&nbsp;which was three days' march at most from Feng-hwang-cheng&nbsp;and could be supported in three more days by Kuropatkin's&nbsp;main body, whereas the pressure of Oku's advance would not&nbsp;begin to be felt by the Russian Southern Detachment until&nbsp;the twelfth day at earliest. It was necessary therefore for&nbsp;the first objective to make a slight concession to the second.&nbsp;Oku had to start at the earliest possible moment, even though&nbsp;operations against Port Arthur were thereby delayed for a&nbsp;week or two. In fact, Oku’s march began on June 13th, Kuroki's&nbsp;on June 24th; the moves of the intermediate forces at various&nbsp;dates within this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Meanwhile Kuropatkin, assembling the main army week by week, was in a difficult position. IIis policy of gaining time&nbsp;had received a severe blow in the failure of his executive officer&nbsp;to realize it, and that officer, though his unpursued troops&nbsp;quickly regained their </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">moral,</span><span class="font0"> had himself completely lost confidence, On the news of the battle (coupled with that of a fresh&nbsp;army appearing on the Korean coast),@@<sup>1</sup> Kuropatkin instantly&nbsp;sent off part of his embryo central mass to bar the mountain&nbsp;passes of Fenshuiling and Motienling against the imagined&nbsp;relentless pursuit of the victors, and prepared to shift his centre&nbsp;of concentration back to Mukden. The subsidiary protective&nbsp;forces on either flank of Zasulich had promptly abandoned&nbsp;their look-out positions and fallen back to join him. But the&nbsp;commander-in-chief, soon realizing that the Japanese were not&nbsp;pursuing, reasserted himself, sent the protective troops back&nbsp;to their posts, and cancelled all orders for the evacuation of Liao-Yang. From this time forward, Kuropatkin allowed his subordinates little or no initiative. A few days later, Zasulich's&nbsp;persistent requests to be allowed to retreat and the still uncertain&nbsp;movements of the 2nd Army induced him once more to prepare a concentration on Mukden. But on the 6th of May he&nbsp;learned that the Japanese 1st Army had again halted at Feng-hwang-cheng and that the 2nd Army was disembarking at&nbsp;Pitszewo, and he resumed (though less confidently) his original&nbsp;idea. The Eastern protective detachment, now strengthened&nbsp;and placed under the orders of Count Keller, was disposed with&nbsp;a view to countering any advance on Liao-Yang from the east&nbsp;by a combination of manœuvre and fighting.@@<sup>2</sup> It was at this&nbsp;moment of doubt that Alexeiev, leaving Port Arthur just in&nbsp;time and profoundly impressed with the precarious state of&nbsp;affairs in the fleet and the fortress, gave the order, as commandcr-in-chief by land and sea, for an “ active ” policy (19th&nbsp;May). Kuropatkin, thus required to abandon his own&nbsp;plan, had Oidy to choose between attacking the 1st&nbsp;Army and turning upon Oku. He did not yield at once ;&nbsp;a second letter from the viceroy, the news of Nanshan, and&nbsp;above all a signed order from the tsar himself, “ Inform General&nbsp;Kuropatkin that I impose upon him all the responsibility for the&nbsp;fate of Port Arthur,” were needed to bring him definitely to&nbsp;execute a scheme which in his heart he knew to be perilous. The&nbsp;path of duty for a general saddled with a plan which he disapproves is not easily discoverable. Napoleon in like case&nbsp;refused, at the risk of enforced resignation, but so did Moreau;&nbsp;the generality of lesser men have obeyed, but so did Suvarov.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Stakelberg’s I. Siberian Corps was therefore reinforced towards the end of May up to a strength of above 35,000. But</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@1</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was the 2nd Army, waiting in the port of Chinampo for the&nbsp;moment to sail for Pitszewo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@2</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One isolated incident which deserves mention took place at this&nbsp;time, the bold raid of Colonel Madritov and 500 Cossacks against&nbsp;the communications of the ist Army. The raid (involving a&nbsp;ride of 240 m. forward and back) was carried out in entire ignorance&nbsp;of the battle of the Yalu, and on arriving at Anju Madritov found&nbsp;nothing to attack, the ist Army having after its victory adopted&nbsp;a short line of communication frorn a sea base near the Yalu mouth.&nbsp;This incident suggests two reflections—first that raids or attacks&nbsp;in rear of the “ centre of operations ” are valueless, however daring,&nbsp;and second that had Zasulich, in his determination to be worthy of&nbsp;his knighthood, concentrated for battle, the presence of the Madntov&nbsp;detachment on the field would have prevented the lamentable and&nbsp;costly misunderstandings of the retreat on Hamatan.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">it remained a detachment only. The Liao-Yang central mass was still held in hand, for the landing of the 4th Army—really&nbsp;only a division at present—at Takushan and the wrong placing&nbsp;of another Japanese division supposed to be with Kuroki&nbsp;(really intended for Nogi) had aroused Kuropatkin's fears for&nbsp;the holding capacity of Keller’s detachment. Moreover, disliking the whole enterprise, he was most unwilling to use up his&nbsp;army in it. The Russians, then, at the beginning of June, were&nbsp;divided into three groups, the Southern, or offensive group&nbsp;(35,000), in the triangle Neuchwang-Haicheng-Kaiping; the&nbsp;Eastern or defensive group (30,000), the main body of it guarding the passes right and left of the Wiju-Liao-Yang road, the&nbsp;left (Cossacks) in the roadless hills of the upper Aiho and YaIu&nbsp;valleys, the right (Mishchênko’s Cossacks and infantry supports)&nbsp;guarding Fenshuiling pass and the road from Takushan; the&nbsp;reserve (42,000) with Kuropatkin at Liao-Yang ; the “ Ussuri&nbsp;Army” about Vladivostok; and StessePs two divisions in the&nbsp;Kwantung peninsula.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On the other side the 1st Army was at Feng-hwang-cheng with one brigade detached on the roads on either hand, the left being&nbsp;therefore in front of the Takushan division and facing the&nbsp;Fenshuiling. Oku’s 2nd Army (4 divisions or 60,000 combatants) was about Port Adams. This last was the objective&nbsp;of the attack of Stakelberg's 35,000. Kuropatkin’s&nbsp;orders to his subordinate were a compromise between&nbsp;his own plan and Alexeiev's. Stakelberg was to crush&nbsp;by a rapid and energetic advance the covering forces&nbsp;of the enemy met with, and his object was “ the capture of the&nbsp;Nanshan position and thereafter an advance on Port Arthur.”&nbsp;Yet another object was given him, to “ relieve the pressure on&nbsp;Port Arthur by drawing upon himself the bulk of the enemy's&nbsp;forces,” and he was not to allow himself to be drawn into a&nbsp;decisive action against superior numbers. Lastly, on June 7th,&nbsp;while Stakelberg was proceeding southward on his ill-defined&nbsp;errand, Kuropatkin, imposed upon by the advance of the&nbsp;Takushan column to Siu-yen, forbade him to concentrate to&nbsp;the front, only removing the veto when he learned that the&nbsp;4th Army had halted and entrenched at Siu-yen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On the 14th, all his arrangements for supply and transport being at last complete, Oku moved north. Although he was&nbsp;still short of part of the 6th division, he was in superior force.&nbsp;He had, moreover, the perfectly definite purpose of fighting his&nbsp;way north, and at Telissu or Wafangkou on the 14th of June,&nbsp;as he expected, he came upon Stakelberg's detachment in an entrenched position. On the 14th and 15th,&nbsp;attacking sharply on the Russian front and lapping round both&nbsp;its flanks, Oku won an important and handsome victory, at a&nbsp;cost of 1200 men out of 35,000 engaged, while the Russians,&nbsp;with a loss of at least 3600 out of about 25,000 engaged, retired&nbsp;in disorder. Thus swiftly and disastrously ended the southern&nbsp;expedition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Meantime, except for the movement on Siu-yen already mentioned,@@<sup>3</sup> and various reconnaissances in force by Keller’s&nbsp;main body and by Rennenkampf's Cossacks farther inland, all&nbsp;was quiet along the Motienling front. Kuroki entrenched himself carefully about Feng-hwang-cheng, intending, if attacked by&nbsp;the Russian main army, to defend to the last extremity the&nbsp;ground and the prestige gained on the ist of May.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">From this point to the culmination of the advance at Liao-Yang, the situation of the Japanese closely resembles that of the Prussians in 1866. Haicheng represents Münchengrätz,&nbsp;Liao-Yang Gitschin, and the passes east of Liao-Yang Nachod&nbsp;and Trautenau. The concentration of the various Japanese&nbsp;armies on one battlefield was to be made, not along the circumference of the long arc they occupied, but towards the centre.&nbsp;Similarly, Kuropatkin was in the position of Benedek. He&nbsp;possessed the interior lines and the central reserve which enables&nbsp;interior lines to be utilized, and a stroke of good fortune prolonged the period in which he could command the situation, for</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">@@@3 The occupation of Siu-yen was chiefly the work of the brigade pushed out to his left by Kuroki. Only a portion of the 10th&nbsp;division from Takushan helped to drive away Mishchenko's Cossacks.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
