<p><label>ROUTLEDGE, GEORGE</label>
(1812-1888), English publisher, was born at Brampton in Cumberland on the 23rd of September 1812. He gained his earliest experience of business with a bookseller at Carlisle. Proceeding to London in 1833, he started in business for himself as a bookseller in 1836, and as a publisher in 1843, making his first serious success by reprinting the Biblical commentaries of an American writer, Albert Barnes. His fame as a publisher, however, rests chiefly upon the enormous number of cheap books which he issued.

He also brought out a number of shilling books in “ Routledge’s Universal Library.” Routledge died in London on the 13th of December 1888. After being styled Routledge, Wame &amp; Routledge, his firm changed its name to that of George Rout-ledge &amp; Sons. A branch of the business was established in New York in 1854.</p>
