There are no aqueducts such as Europeans or Arabs might have built, but water furrows have been carried on&nbsp;admirably calculated gradients for miles along the hill-sides.&nbsp;The amount of labour which has been expended on the great&nbsp;villages between Inyanga and the Zambezi is astounding.&nbsp;On one site, the Niekerk Ruins, an area of fully 50 sq. m. is&nbsp;covered with uninterrupted lines of walls. It is an interesting&nbsp;question which may be solved by future explorations whether&nbsp;these settlements do not extend north of the Zambezi. In-trenchments like those of the Niekerk Ruins have been reported&nbsp;from the south-east of Victoria Nyanza, and Major Powell&nbsp;Cotton has published a photograph from the Nandi country&nbsp;which exhibits a structure precisely similar to the hill forts&nbsp;of Inyanga.

<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">History.</span><span class="font2">—There is evidence that from the 10th or nth centuries onward the lands now forming Rhodesia were inhabited by Bantu-negroes who had made some progress in&nbsp;civilization .and who traded with the Arab settlements at&nbsp;Sofala and elsewhere on the east coast (see </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Archaeology</span><span class="font2"> above).&nbsp;From the 15th century, if not earlier, until about the close of the&nbsp;18th century, a considerable part of this area was ruled by a&nbsp;hereditary monarch known as the Monomotapa, whose riw-</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">babwe</span><span class="font2"> (capital) was, in the earlier part of the period indicated,&nbsp;in what is now Mashonaland. Some of the Monomotapas&nbsp;during the 16th and 17th centuries entered into political and&nbsp;commercial relations with the Portuguese (see Monomotapa&nbsp;and Zimbabwe). The Monomotapa “ empire ” included many&nbsp;vassal states, and probably fell to pieces through intertribal&nbsp;fighting, which greatly reduced the number of inhabitants. In&nbsp;the early years of the 19th century the tribes appear to have lost&nbsp;all cohesion. The people were mainly agriculturists, but the&nbsp;working of the gold-mines, whence the Monomotapas had obtained much of their wealth, was not wholly abandoned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The modem history of the country begins with its invasion by the Matabele, an offshoot of the Zulus. Mosilikatze, their&nbsp;first chief, was a warrior and leader who served under the&nbsp;ZuIu despot Chaka. Being condemned to death by Chaka,&nbsp;Mosilikatze fled, with a large division of the Zulu army. About&nbsp;1817 he settled in territories north of the Vaal, not far from&nbsp;the site of Pretoria; and in 1836 a treaty of friendship was&nbsp;entered into with him by the governor of Cape Colony. In the&nbsp;same year, a number of the “ trek Boers ” had crossed the Vaal&nbsp;river, and came in contact with the MatabeIe, who attacked&nbsp;and defeated them, capturing a large number of Boer cattle&nbsp;and sheep; In November 1837 the Boers felt themselves strong&nbsp;enough to assail Mosilikatze, and they drove him and his&nbsp;tribe north of the Limpopo, where they settled and occupied&nbsp;the country subsequently known as Matabeleland. In 1868&nbsp;Mosilikatze died. Kuruman, son and recognized heir of the old&nbsp;chieftain, had disappeared years before, and though a Matabele&nbsp;who claimed to be the missing heir was brought from Natal he&nbsp;was not acknowledged by the leading indunas, who in January&nbsp;1870 invested Lobengula, the next heir, with the chieftainship.&nbsp;Those Matabele who favoured the supposed Kuruman were&nbsp;defeated in one decisive battle, and thereafter Lobengula, whose&nbsp;kraal was at Bulawayo, reigned unchallenged. At this time the&nbsp;Matabele power extended north to the Zambezi, and eastward&nbsp;over the land occupied by the Mashona and other Makalanga&nbsp;tribes. North of the Zambezi the western districts were ruled&nbsp;by the Barotse </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.),</span><span class="font2"> while the eastern portion had been overrun&nbsp;by other tribes of Zulu-Xosa origin, among whom the Agoni&nbsp;were the most powerful. The explorations of David Livingstone, Thomas Baines (1822-1875), Karl Mauch, and other&nbsp;travellers, had made known to Europe the general character of&nbsp;the country and the existence of great mineral wealth. Loben-gula was approached by several “ prospectors ” for the grant&nbsp;of concessions; among them two Englishmen, Baines in 1871&nbsp;and Sir John Swinburne in 1872, obtained cessions of mineral&nbsp;rights, but little effort was made to put them in force. In 1882&nbsp;President Kruger, who was then bent on extending the boundaries of the Transvaal in every direction, endeavoured to make&nbsp;a treaty with Lobengula, but without success. The Warren&nbsp;expedition of 1884 to Bechuanaland (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">q.v</span><span class="font2">.), while it checked for a&nbsp;time the encroachments of the Transvaal Boers, and preserved&nbsp;to Great Britain the highway to the north through Bechuana-land, also served to encourage colonists to speculate as to the&nbsp;future of the interior. At this time, too, the struggle between the&nbsp;nations of western Europe for the unappropriated portions of&nbsp;Africa had begun, and while the Boers, foiled in Matabeleland,&nbsp;endeavoured to get a footing in Mashonaland, both Portuguese&nbsp;and Germans were anxious to secure for their countries as much&nbsp;of this region as they could. In 1887 a map was laid before the&nbsp;Portuguese cortes showing the territories in Africa claimed by&nbsp;Portugal. They stretched across the continent from sea to sea,&nbsp;and included almost the whole of what is now Rhodesia, as well&nbsp;as the British settlements on Lake Nyasa. To the claim of a&nbsp;transcontinental domain Portugal had succeeded in gaining the&nbsp;assent of Germany and France, though Germany, which had&nbsp;secured a footing in south-west Africa, still dreamed of extending&nbsp;her sway over Matabeleland. By the instructions of Lord&nbsp;Salisbury, then foreign secretary, the British representative at&nbsp;Lisbon informed the Portuguese government that except on the&nbsp;seacoast and on portions of the Zambezi river there was not&nbsp;a sign of Portuguese authority or jurisdiction in the districts&nbsp;claimed by them, and that the British government could not&nbsp;recognize Portuguese sovereignty in territory not effectively&nbsp;occupied by her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This protest, so far as southern Rhodesia is concerned, might have been ineffective save for the foresight, energy and determination of Cecil Bhodes, who had been instrumental in saving&nbsp;Bechuanaland from the Boers, and who as early as 1878 had&nbsp;conceived the idea of extending British influence over central&nbsp;Africa.@@<sup>1</sup> At this time gold prospecting was being feverishly&nbsp;undertaken all over South Africa as a result of the discoveries&nbsp;at Barberton and on the Rand, and Lobengula was besieged for&nbsp;all sorts of concessions by both Portuguese and Boers, as well&nbsp;as by other adventurers from all parts of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If the country was to be secured for Britain immediate action was necessary. Sir Sidney Shippard, who had&nbsp;succeeded Rhodes as commissioner in Bechuanaland&nbsp;and who shared his views, kept up a friendly correspondence with Lobengula, while at Bulawayo Mr J. S.&nbsp;Moffat was British resident. At the end of 1887 Sir Sidney&nbsp;urged the high commissioner, Lord Rosmead (then Sir Hercules&nbsp;Robinson), to allow him to conclude a treaty with Lobengula,&nbsp;but unavailingly, until Rhodes, by taking upon himself all&nbsp;pecuniary responsibility, succeeded in obtaining the required&nbsp;sanction. On the nth of February 1888, Moffat and Lobengula&nbsp;signed an agreement, whereby the Matabele ruler agreed that he&nbsp;would refrain from entering into any correspondence or treaty&nbsp;with any foreign state or power without the previous knowledge&nbsp;and sanction of the British high commissioner for South Africa.&nbsp;Shortly after the conclusion of this treaty, representatives of&nbsp;influential syndicates directed by Rhodes, in which Alfred Beit&nbsp;and C. D. Rudd were large holders, were sent, with the knowledge of the British government and the high commissioner, to&nbsp;negotiate with Lobengula, and on the 30th of October of the same&nbsp;year he concluded an arrangement with Messrs Rudd, Rochfort&nbsp;Maguire and F.R. Thomson, by which, in return for the payment&nbsp;of £100 a month, together with 1000 Martini-Henry rifles and&nbsp;100,000 rounds of ammunition, he gave the syndicate complete&nbsp;control over all the metals and minerals in his kingdom, with&nbsp;power to exclude from his dominions “ all persons seeking land,&nbsp;metals, minerals or mining rights therein,” in which action, if&nbsp;necessary, he promised to render them assistance. The position&nbsp;of the envoys was one of considerable danger, as Lobengula&nbsp;had around him many white advisers strongly antagonistic to</span></p>
