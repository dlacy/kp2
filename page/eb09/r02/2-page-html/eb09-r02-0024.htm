<p><span class="font0">cloaca is somewhat oblique, and is situated in a somewhat funnel-shaped depression beside the opening of the ureter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the Lacertilia the testes are spheroidal and almost symmetrically placed. The vasa efferentia come forth from their inner side and pass into a canal lying in a fold of peritoneum. This canal,&nbsp;the vas deferens, begins cæcally much in front of the union of&nbsp;the vasa efferentia with it, and this anterior portion runs along the&nbsp;ventral side of the kidney in a fold of peritoneum and has the&nbsp;appearance of a knot of tubuli or of a body transversely convoluted.&nbsp;The vas deferens passes backwards in numerous close-set convolutions, and often dilates towards its hinder end. It ultimately&nbsp;narrows, and opens on the cloaca, beside the ureter, on a small&nbsp;papilla.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Chdonia have testes which lie somewhat external to the kidneys as well as behind them. The vas deferens terminates upon&nbsp;a small papilla in the cloaca, but its proximal end—anterior to the&nbsp;junction with it of the vasa efferentia—is wide, and consists of a&nbsp;very complicated mass of tubes, and it may have (as in Chelodina)&nbsp;five or six short cæcal diverticula.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The testes of the Crocodilia are of an elongated oval form, and lie partly in front of and partly on the inner side of the kidneys.&nbsp;The testis may be divided into two portions connected together&nbsp;dorsally. The vasa efferentia pass from the outer border of the&nbsp;testis to a vas deferens, which has rather thick walls with a marked&nbsp;dilatation towards its hinder end. It lies above the peritoneum,&nbsp;and opens at its distal end into a groove at the base of the penis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Ovaries and Oviducts.—The ovaries are, as in the class Mammals, the glands which correspond with the testes, but which,&nbsp;unlike the latter, are not composed of a mass of tubules, while each&nbsp;does not discharge its product into a tube directly continuous with&nbsp;it (as does the testis into the vas deferens) but into a tube, the&nbsp;oviduct, the distal end of which is open and discontinuous with the&nbsp;ovary save for a broad fold of peritoneum which connects them.&nbsp;The ovaries always lie in the dorsal part of the abdominal cavity&nbsp;enclosed in peritoneum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the Ophidia the ovaries are, like the testes, elongated and placed one in advance of the other. The right ovary is more&nbsp;voluminous, and the right oviduct is, of course, the longer one.&nbsp;The ova are so arranged within them as to form a longitudinal&nbsp;series. The proximal end of each oviduct shows a transversely&nbsp;expanded wide opening. The oviduct passes backwards in convolutions which are often spirally arranged, and it is very extensible,&nbsp;being lined with numerous close-set effaceable folds. The oviducts&nbsp;open into the cloaca by a crescentic fissure behind the opening of&nbsp;the rectum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the Lacertilia, except the Ampliisbænians and probably some other Serpentiform Lizards, the ovaries have not their contained&nbsp;ova serially arranged. They may or may not be symmetrically&nbsp;disposed. The oviducts are usually broad and spirally disposed.&nbsp;Unstriated muscular fibres often exist in the folds of membrane&nbsp;which support their convolutions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Chdonia have ovaries symmetrically placed, often of a broad and flattened shape. The oviduct varies much in capacity&nbsp;in different parts of its course. The ovaries of the Crocodilia are compact in structure and somewhat more advanced in position than in&nbsp;most Reptiles. The oviduct is more uniform in diameter than in&nbsp;the Chelonia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The External Generative Organs. —Λs has been already mentioned, all Reptiles have such external organs with the exception of&nbsp;Hatteria. In the rest of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">class we always find such organs</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">connected with the cloaca, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">capable of being everted for use</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">or retracted and hidden within</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">or behind that chamber. The</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">whole class is thus divisible</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">into two groups according to</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">the bifold or azygous condition</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">of these parts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the Lacertilia and Ophidia they are bifold, and consist in&nbsp;the males of two hollow, invertible, imperforate, cutaneous&nbsp;cones placed one on each side of&nbsp;the cloaca, containing erectile&nbsp;tissue and capable of being protruded or retracted by appropriate muscles. The lining of&nbsp;each cone is continuous both&nbsp;with the external skin of the&nbsp;adjacent parts and also with&nbsp;the mucous lining of the cloaca.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A.tortuous groove which begins within the cloaca, at the aperture of the vas deferens, is continued&nbsp;on to the apex of the cone. When erected for use the lining&nbsp;membrane of the cones, with its grooves, becomes the external coat&nbsp;of each copulatory organ. In the females there are rudimentary&nbsp;but quite similar organs, just as in Mammals the clitoris of the&nbsp;female is present as the rudimentary representative of the penis of&nbsp;the male. In the Ophidia these hollow penes may or may not&nbsp;bifurcate distally, and if they bifurcate then the groove bifurcates&nbsp;also. The lining membrane of the cone may be smooth, as in&nbsp;Python, or spiny, as in Trigoηocephαlus and Crotalus, or may have&nbsp;transverse rows of soft lamellæ, as in Boa marina. The Lacertilia,&nbsp;like the Ophidia, may have each penis single to its apex or bifurcating distally with various other minor modifications as to relative&nbsp;size, the form of the apex, and the appendages borne upon it. The&nbsp;cones are exceptionally short in the Chamæleons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The male Chelonia and Crocodilia have an azygous penis, and a corresponding rudimentary structure exists in the females. This&nbsp;organ lies at the ventral wall of the cloaca ; it is not hollow or&nbsp;evertible, but purely distensible and so erectile. It is therefore its&nbsp;external coat which is continuous with the lining of the cloaca.&nbsp;Muscles proceeding from beneath the hinder trunk vertebra are&nbsp;inserted into it. The penis is imperforate, but two ridges are&nbsp;continued on to it from the wall of the cloaca, and so form a groove,&nbsp;and during erection a temporary canal, which passes along it from&nbsp;root to apex. At its distal end there is a prominence which,&nbsp;though imperforate, may remind us of the “glans” of the Mammalian penis. The whole body of the organ, including this distal&nbsp;prominence, contains erectile tissue. In the Chelonia the penis&nbsp;may divide distally, and if so the groove it bears divides also.&nbsp;In Chelodina it has an undivided distal end and two lateral processes. In Trionyx it subdivides distally into four terminal parts.&nbsp;The penis of the Crocodile has a deep groove which reaches to&nbsp;the extreme end of the penis, a quasi-glans projecting freely&nbsp;beneath it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A few Reptiles have secondary sexual characters—notably the Chamæleons, the males of which alone have the horns and other&nbsp;cephalic appendages,'which characterize certain species. In most&nbsp;Reptiles, however, the two sexes have hardly any distinctive&nbsp;external characters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Embryology.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Most of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rep)tiliα</span><span class="font1"> are oviparous, but certain of the Lacertilians and many Ophidians, notably Vipers and&nbsp;Sea-Snakes, hatch their eggs before they are laid ; that&nbsp;is, they are ovoviviparous. The oviduct supplies the&nbsp;ovum during its exit with an albuminous investment, the&nbsp;white of the egg, and with a shell, or testa, which may be&nbsp;thin and flexible, as in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lacertilia</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ophidia,</span><span class="font1"> or&nbsp;hard and calcareous, as in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Crocodilia</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chelonia,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">the eggs of which animals much resemble those of Birds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">, The embryo Reptile closely resembles in its general features the embryo Bird, and, as the process of development of the chick (which can be so conveniently studied)&nbsp;is now comparatively thoroughly well known (see Reproduction), we cannot here make more than a cursory&nbsp;mention of the leading structural changes. Inasmuch as&nbsp;embryonic Reptiles thus resemble embryonic Birds, it of&nbsp;course follows that they present all those features which&nbsp;embryonic Birds share with Vertebrate animals generally,&nbsp;such as the segmentation of the yolk, the resulting formation on its surface of the blastoderm, and its division into&nbsp;the three germinal layers. As in Birds, the yolk segmentation is meroblastic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The blastoderm spreads rapidly over the yolk, but before it has half enclosed it a pyriform patch, the embryonic&nbsp;shield, or area pellucida, appears at its centre. The head&nbsp;of the embyro is formed at the broader encl of the pyriform&nbsp;patch. Towards its hinder end a streak of the epiblast&nbsp;is formed, the primitive groove,</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> and then in front of it&nbsp;another longitudinal indentation, the “ medullary groove,”&nbsp;the walls of which are the “ medullary plates ” ; and it is&nbsp;this groove and plates with the parts immediately subjacent which lay the foundation of the developing body.&nbsp;The lining of the medullary groove becomes the cerebrospinal axis, while a longitudinal cellular rod which is&nbsp;formed beneath it, and which is called the notochord, lays&nbsp;the foundation of the future axial skeleton as far forward&nbsp;as the hinder margin of the cranial support of the pituitary&nbsp;body of the brain. The anterior end of the medullary</span></p>
