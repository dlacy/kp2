nearly one third part of the whole shire having been sold within that period. There are about thirty seats of noblemen and gentlemen, besides villas belonging to merchants and tradesmen. There are also many remains of ancient structures, which formed the seats of powerful or respectable families. This shire was anciently covered with wood. Even now it is ornamented with many woods and plantations ; and it is in general well enclosed.
As an agricultural district, this does not rank so high as some others in Scotland. Farms are generally small, seldom exceeding 100 acres on the arable land, and 400 or 500 acres on the hills. In 1811 the average rent per English acre was about fifteen shillings, varying from two or three shillings to four or five pounds ; partly owing to situation, but still more to the different degrees of the natural fertility of the soil. The usual period of leases here, as in other parts of Scotland, is nineteen years ; but many are now shorter. The mode of farming is such as every year to leave more than a half of the arable land in grass, on which the stock chiefly kept is cows, the most part of whose milk is made into butter. There are few cheese-dairies. The corn chiefly raised here consists of oats and bear. Wheat, barley, beans, and pease, are sown, but not in great quantities. Clover and rye-grass are sown only for hay. Turnips are much grown as a field crop. Potatoes are skilfully and extensively cultivated, the vast population of the district creating an extraordinary demand for a root so cheap and wholesome. A flock of Merino sheep was brought to this county from Spain in the year 1810, but the experiment proved unsuccessful.
It is by its manufactures and commerce that this county is most distinguished. Goods of silk, and cotton, and muslin fabrics, are the principal articles manufactured. Cotton-mills, bleachfields, and printfields, furnish employment to a large portion of the inhabitants. Paisley and its environs form the chief seat of the manufactures. At Greenock and Port-Glasgow the foreign and coasting trade of the county, and, indeed, a great proportion of the foreign trade of Scotland, are carried on. To prevent repetition, we refer to the articles Paisley, Gbeenock, and Port-Glasgow, for information concerning the manufactures and commerce of Renfrewshire.
The other more considerable towns and villages, with their population in 1831, are as follow: Johnston, 5617 ; Pollockshaws, a burgh of barony, 4267 ; Lochwinnoch, 2645 ; Barrhead and Newton Ralston, 2640 ; Kilbarchan, 2333; Neilston, 1137 ; and Elderslie, 1099.
In 1755 tile population of the county was only 26,645; in 1831 itamounted to 133,443. The increase, therefore, in seventy-six years has been 106,995, being upwards of 400 per cent., which exceeds that of any other county in Scotland.

RENNES, an arrondissement of the department of Ille and Vilaine, in France, extending over 532 square miles, and containing ten cantons, seventy-eight communes, and, in 1836, 130,838 inhabitants. The capital is the city of the same name, situated at the junction of the two rivers which give name to the department. It is the seat of the departmental government, as it was of that of the province of Normandy in former times. It stands on a fine plain, and, excepting the suburbs, is well built ; the parade being one of the finest squares in France. It has a cathedral and eight other churches, a fine exchange, and in 1836 the population was 35,552. There are extensive linen manufactures, especially of sail-cloth for the royal navy. Cottons are made and printed, and many stockings are woven. Manyof the inhabitants are employed in building, equipping, and navigating vessels.

RENNIE, John, a distinguished mechanist, architect, and civil engineer, was born on the 7th of June 1761, at Phantassie, in the parish of Prestonkirk, in the county of East Lothian. His father, a highly respectable farmcr, died in 1766, leaving a widow and nine children, of whom John was the youngest. The first rudiments of his education were acquired at the village school; and as it frequently happens that some trifling circumstance in early life gives a bent to the pursuits and fixes the destinies of the future man, so it fared with young Rennie. The school was situated on the opposite side of a brook, over which it was necessary to pass by means of a rustic bridge of stepping stones ; but when the freshes were out, the only alternative of crossing the stream was by means of a boat, which was kept at the workshop of Mr Andrew Meikle1 an ingenious mechanic, well known in Scotland as the inventor of the thrashing-machine, and many improvements in agricultural implements. In passing through this workshop, which stood on his family property, young Rennie’s attention was forcibly drawn to the various operations that were in progress, and a great part of his leisure and holiday time was passed therein. The sons of Mr Meikle, and the workmen, seeing the delight which he appeared to take in examining their labours, were in the habit of indulging him with their tools, and showing him their various uses. His evenings were chiefly employed in imitating those models which had particularly attracted his attention in the workshop ; and it is known in the family, that, at little more than ten years of age, he had constructed the model of a windmill, a pile-engine, and a steam-engine. That of the pile-engine is still in existence, and is said to be remarkably well made.
Having continued at Preston school till twelve years of age, he had about that time a quarrel with his schoolmaster, whom he deemed incompetent to give him further instruction, and therefore entreated that he might be permitted to leave thc school. But his active mind soon became restless ; for the first time he felt the hours hang heavily on his hands ; and having expressed a wish to be placed under his friend Mr Meikle, he employed himself w ith this ingenious mechanic for about two years ; but his mind expanding with his growth, he bcgan to feel that the progress of his intellectual faculties was likely to be retarded by a constant application to manual labour. He therefore at length determined to place himself under the tuition
