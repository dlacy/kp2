<p><label>REVEREND</label>
(Lat. <hi rend="italic">reverendus,</hi> gerundive of <hi rend="italic">revereri,</hi> to revere, pay respect to), a term of respect or courtesy, now especially used as the ordinary prefix of address to the names of ministers of religion of all denominations. The uses of Med. Lat. <hi rend="italic">reverendus</hi> do not confine the term to those in orders; Du Cange <hi rend="italic">(Gloss, s.v.)</hi> defines it as <hi rend="italic">titulus honorarius, etiam mulieribus potioris dignitatie Concessiis,</hi> and in the 15th century in English it is found as a general term of respectful address. The usual prefix of address of a parson was “ sir,” representing Lat. <hi rend="italic">dominus</hi> (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir),</hi> or “ master.” It has been habitually used of the parochial clergy of the Church of England since the end of the 17th century. It is not, however, a title of honour or dignity, and no denomination has any exclusive right to use it. A faculty was ordered to be issued for the erection of a tombstone, the inscription on which contained the name of a Wesleyan minister prefixed by “ reverend ”; this the incumbent had refused <hi rend="italic">(Keat</hi> v. <hi rend="italic">Smith,</hi> 1876, 1 P.D. 73). In the Church of England deans are addressed as “ very reverend,” bishops as “ right reverend,” archbishops as “ most reverend.” The Moderator of the Church of Scotland is also styled “ right reverend.”</p>
