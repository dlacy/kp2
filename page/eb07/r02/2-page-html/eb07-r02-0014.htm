<p><span class="font2">sure by the expense of water in a given time. We judge the velocity to diminish when the quantity discharged diminishes ; yet it may be otherwise, and probably is otherwise. The absolute velocity of many, if not all, of the particles, may even be increased ; but many of the motions&nbsp;being transverse to the general direction, the quantity of&nbsp;motion in this direction may be less, while the sum of the&nbsp;absolute motions of all the particles may be greater. When&nbsp;we increase the general velocity, it is not unreasonable to&nbsp;suppose that the impulses on all the inequalities are increased in this proportion ; and the number of particles thus impelling and deflected at the same time will increase in the&nbsp;same proportion. The whole quantity, therefore, of these&nbsp;useless and lost motions will increase in the duplicate ratio&nbsp;of the velocities, and the force necessary for keeping up the&nbsp;motion will do so also ; that is, the resistances should increase as the squares of the velocities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Or if we consider the resistances as arising merely from the curvature of the imperceptible internal motions occasioned by the inequalities of the sides of the pipe, and as&nbsp;measured by the forces necessary for producing these cur-vilineal motions ; then, because the curves will be the same&nbsp;whatever are the velocities, the deflecting forces will be as&nbsp;the squares of the velocities ; but these deflecting forces&nbsp;are pressures, propagated from the parts urged or pressed&nbsp;by the external force, and are proportional to these external&nbsp;pressures by the principles of hydrostatics. Therefore the&nbsp;pressures or forces necessary for keeping up the velocities&nbsp;are as the squares of these velocities ; and they are our only&nbsp;measures of the resistances which must be considered as&nbsp;following the same ratio. Whatever view therefore we take&nbsp;of the nature of these resistances, we are led to consider&nbsp;them as proportional to the squares of the velocities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We may therefore express the resistances by the symbol V<sup>2</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">—, m</span><span class="font2"> being some number to be discovered by experiment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Thus, in a particular pipe, the diminution of the motion or the resistance may be the 1000th part of the square of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">V<sup>s</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2">velocity, and R = yθθθ∙</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Du Buat therefore examined this by experiment, but found, that even with respect to a pipe or channel which&nbsp;was uniform throughout, this was not true. We could give&nbsp;at once the final formula which he found to express the&nbsp;velocity in every case whatever ; but this would be too empirical. The chief steps of his very sagacious investigation&nbsp;are instructive. We shall therefore mention them briefly,&nbsp;at least as far as they tend to give us any collateral information ; and let it always be noted, that the instruction&nbsp;which they convey is not abstract speculation, but experimental truths, which must ever remain as an addition to&nbsp;our stock of knowledge, although Du Buat’s deductions from&nbsp;them should prove false.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">He found, in the first place, that in the same channel the product of V and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">∙fs</span><span class="font2"> increased as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">∖</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">fs</span><span class="font2"> increased ; that&nbsp;is, the velocities increased faster than the square roots of&nbsp;the slope, or the resistances did not increase as fast as the&nbsp;squares of the velocities. We beg leave to refer our readers&nbsp;to what we said on the resistance of pipes to the motion of&nbsp;fluids through them, in the article Pneumatics, when speaking of bellows. They will there see very valid reasons, we&nbsp;apprehend, for thinking that the resistances must increase&nbsp;more slowly than the squares of the velocities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It being found, then, that V </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">∖</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ps</span><span class="font2"> is not equal to a constant quantity </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vmg,</span><span class="font2"> it becomes necessary to investigate some&nbsp;quantity depending on √<sup>,</sup></span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">s,</span><span class="font2"> or, as it is called, some function of&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vs</span><span class="font2"> which shall render </span><span class="font3">v<sup>z</sup></span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">mg</span><span class="font2"> a constant quantity. Let X&nbsp;be this function of V<sup>z</sup>s, so that we shall alw<sup>τ</sup>ays have VX&nbsp;equal to the constant quantity </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vmg,</span><span class="font2"> or —,”<sup>1</sup>·— equal to the</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">actual velocity V of a pipe or channel which is in train.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Du Bunt, after many trials and reflections, the chief of which will be mentioned by and by, found a value of X&nbsp;which corresponded with a vast variety of slopes and velocities, from motions almost imperceptible, in a bed nearly&nbsp;horizontal, to the greatest velocities which could be produced by gravity alone in a vertical pipe ; and when he&nbsp;compared them together, he found a very discernible relation between the resistances and the magnitude of the section ; that is, that in two channels which had the same&nbsp;slope, and the same propelling force, the velocity was&nbsp;greatest in the channel which had the greatest section relative to its border. This may reasonably be expected.&nbsp;The resistances arise from the mutual action of the water&nbsp;and this border. The water immediately contiguous to it&nbsp;is retarded, and this retards the next, and so on. It is to be&nbsp;expected, therefore, that if the border, and the velocity, and&nbsp;the slope, be the same, the diminution of this velocity will&nbsp;be so much the less as it is to be shared among a greater&nbsp;number of particles ; that is, as the area of the section is&nbsp;greater in proportion to the extent of its border. The diminution of the general or medium velocity must be less in&nbsp;a cylindrical pipe than in a square one of the same area,&nbsp;because the border of the section is less.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It appears evident, that the resistance of each particle is in the direct proportion of the whole resistance, and the&nbsp;inverse proportion of the number of particles which receive&nbsp;equal shares of it. It is therefore directly as the border,&nbsp;and inversely as the section. Therefore, in the expression&nbsp;V<sup>!</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2">— which we have given for the resistance, the quantity </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">m</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">cannot be constant, except in the same channel ; and in different channels it must vary along with the relation of&nbsp;the section to its border, because the resistances diminish&nbsp;in proportion as this relation increases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Without attempting to discover this relation by theoretical examination of the particular motions of the various filaments, Du Buat endeavoured to discover it by a comparison of experiments. But this required some manner&nbsp;of stating this proportion between the augmentation of the&nbsp;section and the augmentation of its border.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">His statement is this : he reduces every section to a rectangular parallelogram of the same area, and having its base equal to the border unfolded into a straight line. The product of this base by the height of the rectangle will be equal&nbsp;to the area of the section. Therefore this height will be a&nbsp;representative of this valuable ratio of the section to its&nbsp;border (we do not mean that there is any ratio between a&nbsp;surface and a line : but the ratio of section to section is&nbsp;different from that of border to border ; and it is the ratio&nbsp;of these ratios which is thus expressed by the height of this</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
