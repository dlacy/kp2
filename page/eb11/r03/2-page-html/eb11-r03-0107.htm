<p><span class="font1">formerly called Botetourt Springs (there is a sulphur spring), is Hollins Institute (1842) for girls; and in the city are the&nbsp;National Business College, the City Hospital (1899), private&nbsp;hospitals, and St Vincent’s Orphan Asylum (1893) for boys,&nbsp;under the Sisters of Charity. Stock-raising, tobacco-growing,&nbsp;and coal and iron-mining are the industries of the district.&nbsp;Roanoke’s factory product in 1905 was valued at $5,544,907&nbsp;(2-7% more than in 1900). Its railway car repair and construction shops, belonging to the Norfolk &amp; Western railway,&nbsp;employed in that year 66.9% of the total number of factory&nbsp;wage-earners; pig-iron, structural iron, canned goods, bottles,&nbsp;tobacco, planing-mill products and cotton are among the&nbsp;manufactures. The municipal water supply comes from a&nbsp;reservoir at Crystal Springs at the foot of Mill Mountain near&nbsp;the city limits. Roanoke was the town of Big Lick (founded&nbsp;about 1852; incorporated in 1874; pop. in 1880, 669) until&nbsp;1882, when it received its present name; in 1884 it was chartered as a city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROARING FORTIES, the name given to the zone in the southern hemisphere, near the 40th parallel of latitude, in which&nbsp;the north-westerly “ anti-trade ” winds attain their greatest&nbsp;development. Since the belt lies in the Great Southern Ocean&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.),</span><span class="font1"> and is little interrupted by land, the “ planetary circulation ” undergoes little modification and barometric gradients&nbsp;are steep. The “ brave west winds ” are accordingly of great&nbsp;strength, and, as in the corresponding belt of the northern&nbsp;hemisphere, the movement is largely broken up into the low&nbsp;and high pressure vortices known as cyclones and anticyclones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROBBEN ISLAND, an island at the entrance of Table Bay, 7 m. N.N.W. of Cape Town. It is some </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">4 </span><span class="font1">m. long by 2 broad.&nbsp;At its southern end is a lighthouse with a fixed light visible for&nbsp;20 m. It got its name </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(robben,</span><span class="font1"> Dutch for seal) from the seals&nbsp;which formelly frequented it, now only occasional visitants.&nbsp;The island when discovered was uninhabited. It is first&nbsp;mentioned by an English seaman named Raymond, who states&nbsp;that in 1591 seals'and penguins were there in large numbers.&nbsp;In 16 r4 ten criminals from London were landed on the island to&nbsp;form a settlement and supply fresh provisions to passing ships.&nbsp;The attempt, which ended in failure, is interesting as the first&nbsp;recorded settlement of English in South Africa. In the 18th&nbsp;century the slate quarries of Robben Island were extensively&nbsp;worked by the Dutch of Cape Town. The island is now noted&nbsp;for its leper asylum and its convict establishment. For many&nbsp;years an asylum for lunatics was also maintained, but in 1904&nbsp;the lunatics were removed to the mainland. The common&nbsp;rabbit, brought from England, abounds, but its introduction&nbsp;to the mainland is prohibited. As early as 1657 criminals were&nbsp;banished to the island by the Dutch authorities at Cape Town;&nbsp;it has also served as the place of detention of several noted&nbsp;Kaffir chiefs.</span></p>

It is a specific offence under the Larceny Act&nbsp;1861, and is punishable by penal servitude for any term not&nbsp;exceeding fourteen years and not less than three years, or imprisonment for any term not exceeding two years, with or&nbsp;without hard labour.

Train robbery&nbsp;is specially dealt with in some states owing to the prevalence&nbsp;of that species of crime.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">ROBERT I., “THE BRUCE” (1274-1329), king of Scotland, was the son of the 7th Robert de Bruce, earl of Carrick by&nbsp;right of his wife Marjorie, daughter of Niel, or Nigel, carl of&nbsp;Carrick, and was the eighth in direct male descent from a&nbsp;Norman baron who came to England with William the Conqueror. After the death of Margaret, the “ maid of Norway,”&nbsp;in 1290, Bruce’s grandfather, the 6th Robert de Bruce, lord of&nbsp;Annandale, claimed the crown of Scotland as the son of Isabella,&nbsp;the second daughter of David, earl of Huntingdon, and great-granddaughter of King David I.; but John de Baliol, grandson&nbsp;of Margaret, the eldest daughter of Earl David, was preferred&nbsp;by the commissioners of Edward I.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The birthplace of Bruce is not certainly known, but was probably Turnberry, his mother’s castle on the coast of Ayr.&nbsp;The date is the nth of July 1274. His youth is said by an&nbsp;English chronicler to have been passed at the court of Edward I.&nbsp;At an age when the mind is quick to receive the impressions&nbsp;which give the bent to life he must have watched the progress&nbsp;of the great suit for the crown of Scotland. Its issue in 1292&nbsp;in favour of Baliol led his grandfather to resign .Vnnandale&nbsp;to his son, the 7th Robert de Bruce, who either then or after&nbsp;the death of his father in 1295 assumed the title of Iord of&nbsp;Annandale. Already on his wife’s death in 1292 he had&nbsp;resigned the earldom of Carrick to his son, the future king,&nbsp;who presented the deed of resignation to Baliol at Stirling in&nbsp;August 1293, and offered the homage which his father, like&nbsp;his grandfather, was unwilling to render. Feudal law required&nbsp;that the king should take seisin of the earldom before regranting&nbsp;it and receiving the homage, and the sheriff of Ayr was directed&nbsp;to take it on BalioFs behalf. As the disputes between Edward I.&nbsp;of England and Baliol, which ended in Baliol losing his kingdom,&nbsp;commenced in this year, it is doubtful whether Bruce ever&nbsp;rendered homage; but he is henceforth known as earl of&nbsp;Carrick, though in a few instances this title is still given to his&nbsp;father. Both father and son sided with Edward against Baliol.&nbsp;In April 1294 the younger Brucc had permission to visit Ireland&nbsp;for a year and a half, and as a further mark of Edward’s favour&nbsp;a respite of all debts owing by him to the exchequer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In August 1296 Brucc and his father swore fealty to Edward I. at Berwick, but in breach of this oath, which had been renewed</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
