        <p><span class="font0">relatively high degree of purity, so as to assimilate foreign
                elements and make them reinforce or improve the ethnical type, without&nbsp;giving
                rise to half-breed races. The maintenance of the very same&nbsp;North-Russian type
                from Novgorod to the Pacific, with but minor&nbsp;differentiations on the
                outskirts—and this notwithstanding the&nbsp;great variety of races with which the
                Russians came in contact—&nbsp;cannot but strike the observer. But a closer
                observation of what is&nbsp;going on even now on the recently colonized confines of
                the empire&nbsp;—where whole villages live, and will continue to live,
                without&nbsp;mixing with natives, but very slowly bringing them over to
                the&nbsp;Russian manner of life, and then very slowly taking in a few
                female&nbsp;elements from them—gives the key to this prominent feature
                of&nbsp;Russian life, which is a colonization on an immense scale,
                and&nbsp;assimilation of foreigners, without in turn losing the
                primary&nbsp;ethnical features.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">Not so with the national customs. There are features—the wooden
                house, the oven, the bath—which the Russian never&nbsp;abandons though lost amidst
                alien populations. But when settled&nbsp;among these the Russian—the
                North-Russian—readily adapts himself to many other differences. He speaks Finnish
                with Finns,&nbsp;Mongolian with Buriats, Ostiak with Ostiaks ; he shows
                remarkable&nbsp;facility in adapting his agricultural practices to new
                conditions,&nbsp;without, however, abandoning the village community ; he
                becomes&nbsp;hunter, cattle-breeder, or fisherman, and carries on these occupations
                according to local usage ; he modifies his dress and adapts his&nbsp;religious
                beliefs to the locality he inhabits. In consequence of all&nbsp;this, the Russian
                peasant (not, be it noted, the trader) must be&nbsp;recognized as the best colonizer
                among the Aryans ; he lives on the&nbsp;best terms with Ostiaks, Tartars, Buriats,
                and even with Red&nbsp;Indians when lost in the prairies of the American
                Far-West.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">Three different branches, which may become three separate
                nationalities, can be distinguished among the Russians since the&nbsp;dawn of their
                history :—the Great Russians, the Little Russians&nbsp;(Malorusses or Ukrainians),
                and the White Russians (the Biélorusses). These correspond to the two currents of
                immigration&nbsp;mentioned above, the northern and southern, with perhaps an
                intermediate one, the proper place of the White Russians not having&nbsp;as yet been
                exactly determined. The primary distinctions between&nbsp;these branches have been
                increased during the last nine centuries&nbsp;by their contact with different
                nationalities,—the Great Russians&nbsp;taking in Finnish elements, the Little
                Russians undergoing an&nbsp;admixture of Turkish blood, and the White Russians
                submitting to&nbsp;Lithuanian influence. Moreover, notwithstanding the unity of
                language, it is easy to detect among the Great Russians themselves two&nbsp;separate
                branches, differing from one another by slight divergences&nbsp;Of language and type
                and deep diversities of national character,—&nbsp;the Central Russians and the
                Novgorodians ; the latter extend&nbsp;throughout northern Russia into Siberia. They
                correspond, perhaps,&nbsp;to subdivisions mentioned by Nestor. It is worthy of
                notice, moreover, that many minor anthropological features can be
                distinguished&nbsp;both among the Great and Little Russians, depending probably
                on&nbsp;the assimilation of various minor subdivisions of the
            Ural-Altaians.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">The Great Russians number about 42,000,000, and occupy in one block
                the space enclosed by a line drawn from the White Sea to&nbsp;the sources of the
                western Düna, the Dneiper, and the Donetz,&nbsp;and thence, through the mouth of the
                Sura, by the Vettuga, to&nbsp;Mezen. To the east of this boundary they are mixed
                with Turco-Finns, but in the Ural Mountains they reappear in a compact
                body,&nbsp;and extend thence through southern Siberia and along the courses&nbsp;of
                the Lena and Amur. Great Russian nonconformists are disseminated among Little
                Russians in Tchernigoff and Moghileff, and&nbsp;they reappear in greater masses in
                Novorossia, as also in northern&nbsp;Caucasia.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">The Little Russians, who number about 17,000,000, occupy the Steppes
                of southern Russia, the south-western slopes of the central&nbsp;plateasu and those
                of the Carpathian and Lublin mountains, and the&nbsp;Carpathian plateau. The Sitch
                of the Zaporog Cossacks colonized&nbsp;the Steppes farther east, towards the Don,
                where they met with a&nbsp;large population of Great Russian runaways, constituting
                the&nbsp;present Don Cossacks. The Zaporog Cossacks, sent by Catherine&nbsp;II. to
                colonize the east coast of the Sea of Azoff, constituted there&nbsp;the Black Sea
                and later the Kuban Cossacks (part of whom, the&nbsp;Nekrasovtsy, migrated to
                Turkey). They have also peopled large&nbsp;parts of Stavropol and northern
                Caucasia.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">The White Russians, mixed to some extent with Great and Little
                Russians, Poles, and Lithuanians, now occupy the upper parts of the&nbsp;western
                slope of the central plateau. They number about 4,300,000.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">The Finnish stems, which in prehistoric times extended from the Obi
                all over northern Russia, even then were subdivided into&nbsp;Ugrians, Permians,
                Bulgarians, and Finns proper, who drove back&nbsp;the previous Lapp population from
                what is now Finland, and about&nbsp;the 7th century penetrated to the south of the
                Gulf of Finland, in&nbsp;the region of the Lives and Kurs, where they mixed to some
                extent&nbsp;with Lithuanians and Letts.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">At present the stems of Finnish origin are represented in Russia by
                the following:—(α) the Western Finns; the Tavasts in central&nbsp;Finland; the
                Kvanes, in north-western Finland; the Karelians,&nbsp;in the east, who also occupy
                the lake-regions of Olonetz and&nbsp;Archangel, and have settlements in separate
                villages in Novgorod&nbsp;and Tveι<sup>,</sup> ; the Izhora and Vod, which are local
                names for the&nbsp;Finns on the Neva and the south-eastern coast of the Gulf
                of&nbsp;Finland ; the Esthes in Esthonia and northern portion of Livonia;&nbsp;the
                Lives on the Gulf of Riga ; and the Kors, mixed with the Letts ;&nbsp;(δ) the
                Northern Finns, or Lapps, in northern Finland and on&nbsp;the Kola peninsula, and
                the Samoyedes in Archangel ; (c) the&nbsp;Volga Finns, or rather the old Bulgarian
                branch, to which belong&nbsp;the Mordvinians (g<sup>,</sup>.r.) and perhaps the
                Tcheremisses in Kazan,&nbsp;Kostroma, and Vyatka, who are also classified by some
                authors&nbsp;with the following ; (</span><span class="font0"
                style="font-style:italic;">d)</span><span class="font0"> the Permians, or
                Cis-Uralian Finns, including the Votiaks on the east of Vyatka, the Permians in
                Perm,&nbsp;the Zyrians in Vologda, Archangel, Vyatka, and Perm, and
                the&nbsp;Tcheremisses ; (c) the Ugrians, or Trans-Uralian Finns, including&nbsp;the
                Voguls on both slopes of the Urals, the Ostiaks in Tobolsk&nbsp;and partly in Tomsk,
                and the Madjares, or Ugrians.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">The Turco-Tartars in European Russia number about 3,600,000. The
                following are their chief subdivisions. (1) The Tartars, of whom&nbsp;three
                different stems must be distinguished :—(α) the Kazan Tartars&nbsp;on both banks of
                the Volga, below the mouth of the Oka, and on&nbsp;the lower Kama, penetrating also
                farther south in Ryazan, Tamboff,&nbsp;Samara, Simbirsk, and Penza ; (δ) the Tartars
                of Astrakhan at the&nbsp;mouth of the Volga; and (c) those of the Crimea, a great
                many of&nbsp;whom have recently emigrated to Turkey. There are, besides,
                a&nbsp;certain number of Tartars from the south-east in Minsk, Grodno,&nbsp;and
                Vilna. (2) The Bashkirs, who inhabit the slopes of the southern&nbsp;Urals, that is,
                the Steppes of Ufa and Orenburg, extending also into&nbsp;Perm and Samara. (3) The
                Tchuvashes, on the right bank of the&nbsp;Volga, in Kazan and Simbirsk. (4) The
                Mescheriaks, a tribe of&nbsp;Finnish origin which formerly inhabited the basin of
                the Oka, and,&nbsp;driven thence during the 15th century by the Russian
                colonizers,&nbsp;immigrated into Ufa and Perm, where they now live among Bashkirs,
                having adopted their religion and customs. (5) The Tepters,&nbsp;also of Finnish
                origin, settled among Tartars and Bashkirs, together&nbsp;with the Mescheriaks, also
                in Samara and Vyatka. They have&nbsp;adopted the religion and customs of the
                Bashkirs, from whom they&nbsp;can hardly be distinguished. The Bashkirs,
                Mescheriaks, and&nbsp;Tepters have rendered able service to the Russian
                Government&nbsp;against the Kirghizes, and until 1863 they constituted a
                separate&nbsp;Bashkir and Mescheriak Cossacks army, employed for service in&nbsp;the
                Kirghiz Steppe. (6) The Kirghizes, whose true abodes were in&nbsp;Asia, in the Ishim
                and Kirghiz Steppe ; but one section of them&nbsp;crossed the Urals and occupied the
                Steppes between the Urals and&nbsp;the Volga. Only the Horde of Bukeeff inhabits
                European Russia,&nbsp;north-east of Astrakhan, the remainder belonging to
                Turkestan&nbsp;and Siberia.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">The Mongolian race is represented in Russia by the Lamaite Kalmuks,
                who inhabit the Steppes of Astrakhan betw<sup>τ</sup>een the&nbsp;Volga, the Don,
                and the Kuma. They immigrated to the&nbsp;mouth of the Volga from Dzungaria, in the
                17th century,&nbsp;driving out the Tartars and Nogais, and after many wars
                with&nbsp;the Don Cossacks, followed by treaties of mutual assistance
                for&nbsp;military excursions, one part of them was taken in by the
                Don&nbsp;Cossacks, so that even now there are among these Cossacks&nbsp;several
                Kalmuk </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sotnias</span><span
                class="font0"> or squadrons. They live for the most&nbsp;part in tents, supporting
                themselves by cattle-breeding, and&nbsp;partly by agriculture.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">The Semitic race is represented in Russia by upwards of 3,000,000
                Jews and 3000 Karaites. The Jews first entered Poland from Germany during the
                crusades, and soon spread through Lithuania,&nbsp;Courland, the Ukraine, and, in the
                18th century, Bessarabia. The&nbsp;rapidity with which they peopled certain towns
                and whole provinces was really prodigious. Thus, from having been but a
                few&nbsp;dozens at Odessa some eighty years since, they make now one-third&nbsp;of
                its population (73,400, out of 207,000). The law of Russia&nbsp;prohibits them from
                entering Great Russia, only the wealthiest and&nbsp;most educated enjoying this
                privilege ; nevertheless they are met&nbsp;with everywhere, even on the Urals. Their
                chief abodes, however,&nbsp;continue to be Poland, the western provinces of
                Lithuania, White&nbsp;and Little Russia, and Bessarabia. In Russian Poland they are
                in&nbsp;the proportion of 1 to 7 inhabitants. In Kovno, Vilna,
                Moghileff,&nbsp;Grodno, Volhynia, Podolia, and probably also in Bessarabia
                and&nbsp;Kherson, they constitute, on the average, 10 to 16 per cent. of
                the&nbsp;population, while in separate districts the proportion reaches 30&nbsp;to
                36 per cent. (50 </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;"
                >'5</span><span class="font0"> in Tchaussy). Organized as they are into a&nbsp;kind
                of community for mutual protection and mutual help (the&nbsp;Kahal), they soon
                become masters of the trade wherever they&nbsp;penetrate. In the villages they are
                mostly innkeepers, intermediaries in trade, and pawnbrokers. In many
                tow<sup>,</sup>ns most of the&nbsp;skilled labourers and a great many of the
                unskilled (for instance,&nbsp;the grain-porters at Odessa and elsewhere) are Jews.
                In the 16&nbsp;western provinces of Russia they numbered 2,843,400 in 1883,
                and&nbsp;about 432,000 in five Polish provinces. Less than 600,000 of
                them&nbsp;inhabit villages, the remainder being concentrated in towns.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">The Karaites differ entirely from the Jews both in worship and in
                mode of life. They, too, are inclined to trade, but also
            success</span></p><div></div><br clear="all" /><div></div><br clear="all" />
