<p><span class="font0">in France ; and was equally formidable ſor his genius as his ſword. In defence of the civil and religious rights&nbsp;of hiε party, he maintained three warθ againſt Louis&nbsp;XIII. The firſt, which terminated to the advantage&nbsp;of the Proteſtants, broke out when that prince wiſhed&nbsp;to eſtabliſh the Romiſh religion in Le Bearn : the ſecond, becauſe of the ſiege which Cardinal De Richlieu&nbsp;cauſed to be laid to Rochelle : and the third, when that&nbsp;place was beſieged a ſecond time. The conſequences&nbsp;of this war are ſufficiently known : Rochelle ſurrendered : and the duke de Rohan perceiving, that after the&nbsp;taking of this place, the majority of his party were endeavouring to make up matters with the court, ſucceeded in procuring for them a general peace in 1629,&nbsp;upon very honourable and advantageous terms. The&nbsp;only ſacriſice of importance which the Huguenots were&nbsp;obliged to make, was their fortifications ; which put it&nbsp;out of their power to renew the war. Some factious&nbsp;perſons, diſſatisſied with ſeeing their fortreſſes fall into&nbsp;their enemies hands, were ready to accuſe their general&nbsp;of having ſold them. This great man, undeſerving of&nbsp;ſuch odious ingratitude, preſented his breaſt to theſe&nbsp;enraged malcontents, and ſaid, “ Strike, ſtrike ! I wiſh&nbsp;to die by your hands, after I have hazarded my life in&nbsp;your ſervice.” The peace of 1629 having extinguiſh-ed the flame of civil war, the duke de Rohan, no&nbsp;longer of uſe to his party, and become diſagreeable at&nbsp;court, retired to Venice. There is a very particular&nbsp;anecdote of him, extracted from the Memoirs of the&nbsp;ducheſs of Rohan, Margaret of Bethune, daughter of&nbsp;the famous Sully. Whilſt the duke de Rohan was at&nbsp;Venice, a propoſal was made to him ſrom the Porte,&nbsp;that ſor 2co,ooo crowns, and an annual tribute of&nbsp;20,000, the Grand Signior would give him the iſland&nbsp;of Cyprus, and fully inveſt him with the dignity and&nbsp;prerogatives of king. The duke was warmly inclined&nbsp;to comply with this propoſal, and to ſettle in the iſland&nbsp;the Proteſtant families of France and Germany. He&nbsp;negociated this buſineſs at the Porte by means of the&nbsp;intervention of the patriarch Cyril, with whom he had&nbsp;much correſpondence ; but different circumſtances, and&nbsp;in particular the death of the patriarch, occurred to&nbsp;break off the treaty. The republic of Venice choſe&nbsp;Rohan for their commander in chief againſt the Impe-rialiſls ; but Louis XΠL took him from the Venetians,&nbsp;and ſent him ambaſtador into Swiſſerland, and into the&nbsp;Griſons. He wiſhed to aſſiſt theſe people in bringing&nbsp;back La Valteline under their obedience, the revolt of&nbsp;which the Spaniards and Imperialiſts encouraged. Rohan, being declared general of the Griſons, after many&nbsp;victories, drove the German and Spaniſh troops entirely from La Valteline in 1633. He defeated the Spaniards again in 1636 at the banks of the lake of Come.&nbsp;France, not thinking it proper to withdraw her troops,&nbsp;the Griſons roſe up in arms, and the duke de Rohan,&nbsp;not ſatisfied with the conduct of the court, , entered into&nbsp;a ſpecial treaty with them the 28th March 1637.&nbsp;This hero, fearing the reſentment of cardinal de Richlieu, retired to Geneva, with a view to join his friend&nbsp;the duke of Saxe-Weimar, who wiſhed him to undertake the command of his army, then ready to engage&nbsp;the Imperialiſts near Rhinfield. Although he declined&nbsp;this honour, yet he took the command of the regiment&nbsp;of Naffau, with which he threw the enemy into confuſion ; but was himſelf wounded; February 28. l683<sub>j</sub>,</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">and died of his wounds the 13th of April following, at the age of 59. He was interred May 27th, in the&nbsp;church of St Pierre in Geneva, where there is a magnificent monument of marble erected to his memory,&nbsp;having on it the moſt illuſtrious actions of his life. The&nbsp;duke de Rohan was one of the greateſt generals of his&nbsp;time, equal to the princes of Orange, and capable,&nbsp;like them, of ſettling a commonwealth ; but more zealous than they for religion, or at leaſt appearing to be&nbsp;ſo. He was vigilant and indefatigable, not allowing&nbsp;himſelf any pleaſures which might take off his attention&nbsp;from his neceſſary employments, and well qualified for&nbsp;being the head of a party ; a poſt very difficult to retain, and in which he had to fear equally from his enemies and his friends. It is in this light that Voltaire&nbsp;has viewed this illuſtrious character, when he compoſed'&nbsp;the following verſe :</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Avec tous les talens le Ciel ſ avait ſait naître :</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Il agit en Heros ; en Sage il écrivit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Il fut mime grand homme en combattant ſon Maître, Et plus grand lorſqu’il le ſervit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">His military virtues were much heightened by the ſweetneſs of his diſpoſition, his affable and courteous&nbsp;manners, and by a generoſity which had few examples.&nbsp;Neither ambition, pride, nor a view of gain, could ever&nbsp;be traced in his character. He was wont to ſay, that&nbsp;“ true glory and a zeal for the public good never dwelt&nbsp;where ſelf-intereſt reigned.” Rohan had always a particular regard for Henry the Fourth : “ Truly (ſaid&nbsp;he, ſometimes after the death of that prince) when I&nbsp;think of him, my heart is ready to break. A wound&nbsp;received in his preſence w<sup>r</sup>ould have afforded me more&nbsp;ſatisſaction than now to gain a battle. I would have&nbsp;valued an encomium from him in this art, of which he&nbsp;was the greateſt maſter of his time, more than than the&nbsp;united praiſes of all the commanders now living.” He&nbsp;wrote ſeveral intereſting performances : 1. The Intereſts&nbsp;of Princes, printed at Cologne in 1666, in I2mo: in&nbsp;which work he fully examines- the public intereſts of&nbsp;all the princes of Europe. 2. The Perfect General,&nbsp;or an abridgement of the wars from Casſar’s Commentaries, in 12mo. In this he makes it appear, that a&nbsp;knowledgeof the tactics of the ancients might be of much&nbsp;uſe to the moderns. 3. A Treatiſe on the Corruption&nbsp;of the ancient Militia. 4. A Treatiſe on the Government of the Thirteen∙ Provinces. 5. Memoirs; the&nbsp;beſt edition of which is in 2 vols I2mo. . fiey contain the hiſtory of France from 1610. to 1C29.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. A</span></p>
