<p><span class="font1">the monument is called a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dolmen (daul,</span><span class="font1"> a table, and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rnaen, </span><span class="font1">a stone). This megalithic chamber is sometimes partially&nbsp;or wholly imbedded in a mound of earth or stones so as to&nbsp;form a tumulus or cairn. As, however, there are many&nbsp;tumuli and cairns which do not contain megalithic chambers, we have only partially to deal with them under the&nbsp;category of rude stone monuments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Menhirs.—</span><span class="font0">Rude monoliths fixed on end (see vol. ii. p. 383, fig. 1) have been used in all ages for a variety of purposes, commemorative and religious. Stone pillars were also used ceremonially&nbsp;on the accession of kings and chiefs. In Scotland, when stones&nbsp;were thus used, they were called Tanist Stones, the most celebrated&nbsp;of which was the Lia Fail, formerly at Scone (now at Westminster&nbsp;Abbey), on which the kings of Scotland used to be crowned. We&nbsp;read also of Hare or Hoer Stones, Cambus or Camus Stones, Cat&nbsp;(cαZΛ, battle) Stones, “ Witch Stanes, ” “Druid Staues,” &amp;c. The&nbsp;Hawk’s Stane, or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Saxum Falconis,</span><span class="font0"> at St Madoes, Perthshire, was&nbsp;erected in memory of the defeat of the Danes at Luncarty, and a&nbsp;monolith now standing on the field of Flodden is said to mark the&nbsp;place where King James fell. When menhirs were grouped together&nbsp;their number was often significant, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font0"> twelve (Josh. iv. 5) or&nbsp;seven (Herod., iii. 8). Some standing stones are found to have&nbsp;been artificially perforated, and these superstition has invested with&nbsp;some curious functions. As examples of this class may be&nbsp;mentioned the famous Stone of Odin, near the circle of Stennis,&nbsp;the Clach-Charra, or Stone of Vengeance, at Onich near Balachu-Iish in Argyllshire, and Men-en-tol in Cornwall. Two rude monoliths in Scotland bear inscriptions,—the famous Newton Stone in&nbsp;the district of Garioch, and the Cat Stane near Edinburgh. Many&nbsp;others have cup-marks and spirals or concentric circles. In Ireland,&nbsp;Wales, and the north of Scotland, they are occasionally found with&nbsp;ogam inscriptions, and in the north-east of Scotland (Pietland)&nbsp;with symbolical figures, which were subsequently continued on the&nbsp;beautifully sculptured stones of early Christian date which are&nbsp;peculiar to that locality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Menhirs are found in all megalithic countries. In the British Isles they are very abundant, more especially in the less cultivated&nbsp;districts. In France over 1600 isolated examples have been&nbsp;recorded, of which about the half, and by far the most remarkable,&nbsp;are within the five departments which constitute Brittany. In the&nbsp;rest of France they are generally small, and not to be compared in&nbsp;grandeur to those of Brittany. At Locmariaquer (Morbihaii) is&nbsp;the largest menhir in the world. It is in the form of a rude but&nbsp;smooth-sided obelisk, and lies on the ground broken into four&nbsp;portions, the aggregate length of which amounts to 20<sup>-</sup>δ0 metres&nbsp;(about 67 feet). It was made of granite, foreign to the neighbourhood, and its weight, according to the most recent calculations,&nbsp;amounted to 347,531 kilogrammes or 342 tons </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">{H Homme,</span><span class="font0"> 1885,&nbsp;p. 193). The next largest menhir is at Plésidy (Côtes-du-Nord),&nbsp;measuring about 37 feet in height. Then follows a list of sixty-seven gradually diminishing to 16 feet in height, of which the first&nbsp;ten (all above 26 feet) are in Brittany. As regards form, these&nbsp;menhirs vary greatly. Some are cylindrical, as the well-known&nbsp;“pierre du champ Dolent” at Dol (height 30 feet), and that of&nbsp;Cadiou in Finistère (28 feet) ; while that of Penmarch (26 feet)&nbsp;takes the shape of a partially expanded fan. On the introduction&nbsp;of Christianity into France its adherents appear to have made use&nbsp;of these menhirs at an early period ; many of them at present&nbsp;support a cross, and some a Madonna. The scattered positions&nbsp;of some monoliths and the no less singular grouping of others show&nbsp;that, although they were sometimes used as landmarks, this was&nbsp;only a secondary function. It is not uncommon to find a monolith&nbsp;overtopping a tumulus, thus simulating the Bauta (grave or battle)&nbsp;Stones OfScandinavia. In England, monoliths are often associated&nbsp;with the stone circles, as the King’s Stone at Stanton Drew, Long&nbsp;Meg at Little Salkeld, the Ring Stone at Avebury, &amp;c. One of&nbsp;the finest British monoliths stands in the churchyard of Rudston,&nbsp;Yorkshire. Examples of a large size are met with in Algeria,&nbsp;Morocco, India, Central Asia, &amp;c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Alignments.—</span><span class="font0">The most celebrated monuments of this class are in the vicinity of Carnac in Brittany. They are situated in groups&nbsp;at Ménec, Kermario, Kerlescant, Erdeven, and St Barbe—all&nbsp;within a few miles of each other, and in the centre of a district&nbsp;containing the most remarkable megalithic remains in the world.&nbsp;The first three groups are supposed by some archæologists to be&nbsp;merely portions of one original and continuous series of alignments,&nbsp;which extended nearly 2 miles in length in a uniform direction&nbsp;from south-west to north-east. Commencing at the village of&nbsp;Ménec, the menhirs are arranged in eleven rows. At first they&nbsp;stand from 10 to 13 feet above the ground, but, as we advance,&nbsp;they become gradually smaller till they attain only 3 or 4 feet,&nbsp;when they cease altogether. After a vacant space of about 350&nbsp;yards we come to the Kermario group, which contains only ten&nbsp;lines, but they are nearly of the same magnitude as at the beginning of the former group. After a still greater interval the menhirs</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">again appear, but this time in thirteen rows, at the village o Kerlescant. In 1881 M. Felix Gaillard, Plouharnel, made a plaι&nbsp;of the alignments at Erdeven, which shows that, out of a total o&nbsp;1120 menhirs which originally constituted the group, 290 are stil&nbsp;standing, 740 fallen, and 90 removed. The menhirs here may b&lt;&nbsp;traced for nearly a mile, but their linear arrangement is not s&lt;&nbsp;distinct, nor are the stones so large as those at Carnac. Aboui&nbsp;fifty alignments are known in France. At Penmarch there is on&lt;&nbsp;containing over two hundred menhirs arranged in four rows.&nbsp;Others, however, are formed of only a single row of stones, as al&nbsp;Kerdouadec, Leuré, and Camaret. The first is 480 m. in length,&nbsp;and terminates at its southern extremity in a kind of crois&nbsp;gammée. At Leuré three short lines meet at right angles. Tht&nbsp;third is situated on the rising ground between the town of Camarel&nbsp;and the point of Toulinguet. It consists of a base line, some 60C&nbsp;yards long, with forty-one stones (others have apparently been&nbsp;removed), and two perpendicular lines as short ofi'sets. Close tc&nbsp;it are a dolmen and a prostrate menhir. These monoliths are all&nbsp;of coarse quartz and of small size, only one, at Leuré, reaching a&nbsp;height of 9 feet. Alignments are also found in other countries.&nbsp;In the Pyrenees they are generally in single file,—mostly straight,&nbsp;but sometimes reptiliform. Oue at Peyrelade (Billiere) runs in a&nbsp;straight line from north to south for nearly 300 yards, and contains&nbsp;ninety-three stones, some of which are of great size. At St Columb&nbsp;in Cornwall, there is one called the Nine Maidens, which is formed&nbsp;of eight quartz stones, extending in a perfectly straight line for 262&nbsp;feet. In Britain they are more frequently arranged in double file,&nbsp;or in avenues, leading to or from other megalithic monuments,&nbsp;such as still exist, or formerly existed, at the circles of Avebury,&nbsp;Stonehenge, Shap, Callernish, &amp;c. The only example in England&nbsp;comparable to the great alignments of Carnac is in the Vale of the&nbsp;White Horse in Berkshire. Here the stones, numbering about&nbsp;eight hundred, are grouped in three divisions, and extend over an&nbsp;irregular Jiarallelograrn which measures from 500 to 600 yards in&nbsp;length and from 250 to 300 yards in breadth. Sir Henry Dryden&nbsp;describes groups of a similar character in Caithness, as at Garry-Whin, Canister, Yarhouse, and the “many stones” at Clyth.&nbsp;Alignments in single and multiple rows have also been observed in&nbsp;Shetland, India, Algeria, &amp;c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Cromlechs.—</span><span class="font0">Enclosures </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">{enceintes)</span><span class="font0"> formed of rude monoliths, placed at intervals of a few yards, have generally a circular or&nbsp;oval shape. Rectangular forms are, however, not unknown,&nbsp;examples of which may be seen at Curcunno (Morbihan), near&nbsp;the celebrated dolmen of that name, and at Saint Just (Ille-et-Vilaine). The former measures 37 by 27 yards, and is now composed of twenty-two menhirs, all of which are standing (some&nbsp;fallen ones having been recently restored by the Government).&nbsp;About a dozen menhirs would appear to be wanting. A donkey-shoe-shaped enclosure has been described by Sir Henry Dryden, in&nbsp;the parish of Latheron, Caithness. It is 226 feet long and 110 feet&nbsp;wide in the middle, and the two extremities are 85 feet apart.&nbsp;Stone circles are frequently arranged concentrically, as may be&nbsp;seen in the circle at Kenmore, near Aberfeldy, Perthshire, as well&nbsp;as in many other Scotch, Irish, and Scandinavian examples.&nbsp;More rarely one large circle surrounds secondary groups, without&nbsp;having a common centre, as was the case at Avebury, where the&nbsp;outer circle, 1200 feet in diameter, included two others, each of&nbsp;which contained an inner concentric circle. At Boscawen, in&nbsp;Cornwall, there is a group of circles confusedly attached, and, as&nbsp;it were, partially overlapping each other. Circles may also be&nbsp;connected by an alignment or avenue, as at Stanton Drew, Dartmoor, &amp;c. Cromlechs are often associated with other megalithic&nbsp;monuments ; thus at the head of the great Carnac alignments are&nbsp;the remains of a large circle which can be readily traced, notwithstanding that some houses are constructed within its area. In the&nbsp;British Isles and the north of Europe cromlechs frequently&nbsp;surround the dolmens, tumuli, or cairns. A few examples of a&nbsp;dolmen surrounded by one or more concentric circles have also&nbsp;been recorded by M. Cartailhac, in the department of Aveyron in&nbsp;France. Outside the cromlech there is also frequently to be&nbsp;found a circular ditch or vallum, as at Avebury, Stonehenge,&nbsp;Arbor Low, Brogar, &amp;c. The most remarkable megalithic monument of this class now extant is Stonehenge, which differs, however, from its congeners in having the stones of its second inner&nbsp;circle partially hewn and attached by large transverse lintels.&nbsp;The largest cromlech in France stands on the Ile-aux-Moines&nbsp;(Morbihan), in the village of Kergonan. About half of it is&nbsp;destroyed by the encroachment of the houses. The remaining&nbsp;semi-circumference (slightly elliptical) contains thirty-six menhirs&nbsp;from 6 to 10 feet high, and its diameter is about 100 metres (328&nbsp;feet). Only a few of the British cromlechs exceed these dimensions, among which may be mentioned Avebury (1260 by 1170&nbsp;feet), Stonehenge (outer circle 300 feet, inner 106 feet), Stanton&nbsp;Drew (360 feet), Brogar (345 feet), Long Meg and her Daughters&nbsp;(330 feet). One near Dumfries, called the Twelve Apostles, also&nbsp;closely approaches the 100-metre size ; but, generally speaking,&nbsp;the Scotch and Irish examples are of smaller proportions, rarely</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
