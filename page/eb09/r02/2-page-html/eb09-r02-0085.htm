<p><span class="font1">a higher percentage; of these 30,973 (over 41 per cent.) were natives of the United Kingdom or its colonies. About 100,000&nbsp;of the population are Roman Catholics ; ol the remainder, the&nbsp;Baptists (who have been in Rhode Island from its earliest settlement) are most numerous, while the communicants of the Protestant Episcopal church, with the Congrcgationalists and Methodists,&nbsp;have also a large representation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Industries.—No portion of the State can be described as exceptionally fertile ; and ouly 3 per cent, of the population are engaged in agriculture. The favourable situation of Newport and Providence, at the two extremities of Narragausett Bay, led to the&nbsp;development in the last century of a flourishing trade. This was&nbsp;long ago greatly reduced, and the tonnage of these ports is now&nbsp;chiefly that of a coasting trade. With the final check given to&nbsp;foreign commerce in the war of 1812-14, manufactures gained at&nbsp;once that prominence in the local industries of the State which they&nbsp;have ever since held. The census of 1880 returned the total number&nbsp;of persons in Rhode Island engaged in “ gainful and reputable ”&nbsp;occupations as 116,979, of whom 66,160, or more than 55 per&nbsp;cent., were classed under the heading “manufactures, mechanics,&nbsp;and mining.”@@<sup>1</sup> From Samuel Slater’s efforts at Providence and&nbsp;Pawtucket Falls, in 1790-93, may in fact be dated the real&nbsp;development of the cotton manufacturing industry in America,&nbsp;Slater, who had served an apprenticeship in England with a&nbsp;partner of Arkwright, having then been able from memory to set&nbsp;up in Rhode Island the whole set of recently improved spinning&nbsp;machinery. In 1791 only 5858 yards of cotton cloth were made in&nbsp;Providence and vicinity, but in 1810 in Rhode Island 735,319&nbsp;were made. Two years later, in 1812, there were fifty-three&nbsp;cotton mills within a radius of 30 miles of Providence, nearly&nbsp;three-fifths of them being in Rhode Island. The number of cotton&nbsp;mills in Rhode Island was 33 in 1812, 116 in 1S31, and 139 in&nbsp;1870. Owing to the widespread depression in business the number&nbsp;was greatly reduced throughout the country during the next&nbsp;decade, but even in 1880 the number in Rhode Island was surpassed by that of no other State except Massachusetts. According to the census of 1880, the amount of capital invested in the&nbsp;manufacture of cotton goods was $24,609,461 ; woollen goods&nbsp;$15,410,450 ; dyeing and finishing textiles, $6,874,254 ; foundry&nbsp;and machine-shop products, $6,281,707 ; worsted goods, $6,177,754 ;&nbsp;jewellery, $5,650,133 ; slaughtering and meat-packing, $3,876,740 ;&nbsp;mixed textiles, $2,718,822 ; rubber and elastic goods, $2,217,000.&nbsp;Thus Rhode Island is second to but one other State—Massachusetts—in its aggregate production of cotton goods ; and in&nbsp;the total amount of capital invested in all manufactures it ranks&nbsp;ninth. In each of the five following industries—cotton, woollen,&nbsp;worsted, mixed textiles, and dyeing and finishing—it stands at&nbsp;the head of all the States in amount of production per head of&nbsp;population. In jewellery the yearly product of a single city, Providence, exceeds that of every other city in the country ($5,444,092&nbsp;in 1880). The same city ranks ninth in the value of its foundry&nbsp;and machine-shop products, $4,522,179; Pawtucket, closely adjoining, adds about $1,600,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Wealth and Finances.—The assessed valuation of the State was—in 1850, $80,508,794 ; in 1860, $135,337,588 ; in 1870,&nbsp;$296,965,646 ; and in 1880, upwards of $420,000,000—a gain of&nbsp;500 per cent, in thirty years. In aggregate valuation it was surpassed in 1880 by twenty-four States (its population in the same&nbsp;year being exceeded by that of thirty-two States), but in valuation&nbsp;per head it ranked third ($1518’82 in 1880). Notwithstanding&nbsp;the large foreign-born population, the number of persons classed as&nbsp;paupers is very small,—only 553 in 1880, as compared with 15,217&nbsp;in New York. In 1884 thirty-eight savings banks contained deposits&nbsp;to the amount of $51,079,160'66, with 115,752 depositors (more&nbsp;than 40 per cent, of the entire population). The number of other&nbsp;banks in the State was, in 1883, seventy-three, with a capital of&nbsp;$22,330,579’00. The State tax in 1880 amounted to $383,439'23;&nbsp;and in the same year the rate of taxation per head for all purposes&nbsp;($974) was exceeded only by that of Massachusetts, New York, and&nbsp;California. The debt of the State, held in bonds issued during the&nbsp;war of 1861-65, ’has for the last few years been steadily diminishing.&nbsp;In 1880 it stood at $2,534,500, and in 1884 at $1,372,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Cities and Towns.—The five counties into which Rhode Island is divided contain in all thirty-six towns and cities, of which six lie&nbsp;on the narrow strip bordering the eastern shore of the bay, five on&nbsp;islands in the bay and ocean, and the remaining twenty-five on&nbsp;the mainland, to the west and north-west of the bay. By the&nbsp;State census of 1885 six cities and towns had a population exceeding 10,000 :—Providence, 117,607 ; Pawtucket, 22,873 ; Newport,&nbsp;20,339 ; Lincoln, 17,262 ; Woonsocket, 16,005 ; Warwick, 13,281.&nbsp;Only two of these places, Providence and Newport, have hitherto&nbsp;been organized as cities ; but a third, Pawtucket (the largest in&nbsp;the country under a town government), is also now (1885) about&nbsp;to be organized under a city charter. The quaint old city of&nbsp;Newport, situated at the southern end of the island (Rhode</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">Island) from which the State receives its name,@@<sup>2</sup> has for many years been nearly stationary as regards the development of its&nbsp;population and industries, but is well known on both sides of&nbsp;the Atlantic for its social attractions. In 1880 the “urban”&nbsp;population of Rhode Island constituted 77 per cent, of the&nbsp;total—a percentage surpassed only in the District of Columbia.&nbsp;Yet the growth of manufacturing industries in the State has&nbsp;resulted in building up compact settlements (in not a few&nbsp;instances almost continuous), with little regard to town lines&nbsp;and boundaries. On the Blackstone river are sixteen of these&nbsp;“ villages ” situated within five different towns ; on the Woonas-quatucket river twelve, in four cities and towns ; and on the&nbsp;Pawtuxet river and its branches thirty-two, in five towns. In&nbsp;1875 there were 186 “villages.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Education.—It was not until 1828 that the present public school system was established ; but, owing largely to the exceptional organizing ability of the first commissioner of public schools,&nbsp;Henry Barnard, a most efficient system was securely built up.&nbsp;From various causes (including the presence of a large foreign-born element), illiteracy is a serious problem in this State,&nbsp;—the percentage unable to write (11’2) being in 1880 higher&nbsp;than in any other Northern State. Imperfect attendance is also a&nbsp;serious difficulty in the mεnufacturing villages. While the number&nbsp;of children registered by the school census of 1880 as of “ school&nbsp;age” was 52,273, only 33,504 of these were actually enrolled as&nbsp;pupils in the public schools. Even after counting those who attend&nbsp;private and parochial schools, those &quot; not attending any school ”&nbsp;comprise so large a number as 12,279. Under the operation of a&nbsp;newly enacted compulsory law encouraging progress has been made.&nbsp;The public school funds in 1884 amounted to $659,585'50. Educational institutions, other than public, include Brown University,&nbsp;the Friends’ School, and various others at Providence. Brown&nbsp;University was founded in 1764, under the name of Rhode Island&nbsp;College, and was the seventh college established in America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Libraries.—The Redwood Library, at Newport, still in existence, incorporated in 1747, was the fourth public library founded in New&nbsp;England. The Providence Library was founded only a few years&nbsp;later, and is still perpetuated in the Providence Athenæum, an&nbsp;admirably conducted shareholders’ library (43,656 volumes in&nbsp;1884). The Brown University Library, founded 1772, had in June&nbsp;1885 more than 62,000 volumes, including several special collections of great rarity and value. There were, moreover, in the same&nbsp;year thirty-two “public libraries” in the State (free to all readers),&nbsp;with a total of about 100,000 volumes. The largest of these (31,650&nbsp;volumes in 1885) is the Providence Public Library.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">History and Constitution.—The planting of the three scattered and independent settlements (Providence, 1636 ; Portsmouth, 1638 ;&nbsp;Newport, 1639) by Roger Williams and others whose views of&nbsp;church polity and doctrine had been found unpalatable to the&nbsp;Massachusetts Puritans, was not in the outset a movement for the&nbsp;establishment of a colony. The need of mutual protection,&nbsp;however, led to their combination ; and the first general union of&nbsp;these three towns (together with a fourth, Warwick), was secured&nbsp;in 1647, under the charter of March 14, 1643-44. The union&nbsp;effected by this instrument was of the very loosest description, but&nbsp;ιιnder the pressure of causes which threatened the very existence of&nbsp;the colony a new and much more comprehensive charter was&nbsp;obtained in 1663. This extraordinarily liberal instrument constituted the fundamental law of Rhode Island for the next hundred&nbsp;and eighty years, through a succession of remarkable vicissitudes.&nbsp;The charters of Massachusetts and other American colonies were&nbsp;withdrawn in 1686, but the efforts of the royal agent were frustrated in Connecticut and Rhode Island ; and in this colony the&nbsp;government was simply committed temporarily to the separate&nbsp;towns which had constituted the colony, the charter government&nbsp;being peacefully resumed three years later, in 1689. Rhode&nbsp;Island was hardly free, during the next seventy years, from some&nbsp;form of conflict with the mother country over the question of&nbsp;charter rights ; and in the steps which served to precipitate the&nbsp;War of Independence (1775-83), as well as in the war itself, it was&nbsp;among the foremost. In the military operations of this war&nbsp;Nathanael Greene, a Rhode Island officer, ranks easily second to&nbsp;Washington in generalship. Reluctant as Rhode Island was to&nbsp;acknowledge other authority than that of its own colonial charter,&nbsp;even after the close of the war, it did not accede to the constitution&nbsp;of the United States until June 1790, more than a twelvemonth&nbsp;after the new government had gone into operation under&nbsp;Washington as president. Nor did it even then follow the example&nbsp;of the other States in framing a State constitution for the government of its local affairs, but retained its colonial charter of 1663&nbsp;until almost the middle of the present century. In 1841 and 1842&nbsp;the dissatisfaction with this mode of government culminated in a&nbsp;series of revolutionary movements ; and a convention called by&nbsp;citizens of the State adopted what was known as the “people’s</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
