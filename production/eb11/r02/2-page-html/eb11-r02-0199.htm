<p><span class="font2">RHEUMATISM (from Gr. peû/za, flux), a general term for various forms of disease, now subdivided more accurately under&nbsp;separate names.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Acute Rheumatism</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rheumatic Fever</span><span class="font2"> is the name given to a disease having for its chief characteristics inflammatory&nbsp;affections of the joints, attended by severe constitutional disturbances and frequently associated with inflammation of the&nbsp;pericardium and valves of the heart. The acute rheumatism&nbsp;of childhood differs materially from that of adults in that the&nbsp;articular manifestations and constitutional disturbance arc&nbsp;usually much less severe, whereas the heart and pericardium are&nbsp;especially liable to be attacked. It will be advisable, therefore,&nbsp;in discussing the symptoms, to deal separately with the&nbsp;rheumatism of adults and that of childhood. There are certain&nbsp;points of importance in connexion with its causation which are&nbsp;generally agreed upon. It is essentially a disease of childhood&nbsp;and early adult life, being most commonly met with between the&nbsp;ages of ten and twenty-five and comparatively rarely after&nbsp;forty. Heredity is unquestionably an important predisposing&nbsp;cause. Climate is also a factor of considerable importance,&nbsp;cold and damp with sudden and wide fluctuations of temperature&nbsp;being especially conducive to an attack. While perhaps more&nbsp;common in Great Britain than elsewhere, it is met with in most&nbsp;parts of the globe. Exposure to cold and wet, and especially a&nbsp;chill after free perspiration and fatigue, are among the most&nbsp;common exciting causes of an attack.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Of recent years much evidence has accumulated tending to show that rheumatism is a specific infective disease due to a&nbsp;micro-organism, and this is now generally recognized. There is&nbsp;still, however, some difference of opinion as to the nature of the&nbsp;micro-organism by which it is produced. In 1900 F. J. Poynton&nbsp;and Paine isolated from eight cases of acute rheumatism in&nbsp;children a minute diplococcus similar to that previously described by Triboulet and by A. Wasserman, which inoculated&nbsp;into rabbits produced lesions of the joints and of the heart&nbsp;indistinguishable from those met with in acute rheumatism.&nbsp;They have since obtained the same micro-organism from a&nbsp;further large number of cases of acute rheumatism, and their&nbsp;results have been confirmed by Walker, Beattie and others.&nbsp;They therefore claim that this micro-organism, to which they&nbsp;have given the name </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Diplococcus Hieuniaticus,</span><span class="font2"> is the specific&nbsp;cause of acute rheumatism. The objections which have been&nbsp;raised by other competent observers against this view are:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(1) That this diplococcus is not found in all cases of acute&nbsp;rheumatism. (2) That certain other micro-organisms when&nbsp;inoculated into animals will produce joint and heart affections&nbsp;similar to those produced by the aforesaid </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Diplococcus Hieumaticus.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">It would be out of place here to enter into the merits of this&nbsp;controversy; suffice it to say that the objections raised do not&nbsp;appear to be cogent enough to invalidate the conclusions arrived&nbsp;at by the authors of the germ theory. The matter is, however,&nbsp;still to a certain extent </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sub judice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">adults</span><span class="font2"> the affection of the joints is the most striking feature. The attack is usually ushered in by a feeling of chilliness or&nbsp;malaise, with pain or stiffness in one or more joints,&nbsp;generally those of large or medium size, such as the&nbsp;knees, ankles, wrists or shoulders. At first the pain is&nbsp;confined to one or two joints, but others soon become affected,&nbsp;and there is a tendency to symmetry in the order in which they&nbsp;are attacked, the inflammation in one joint being followed by&nbsp;that of the same joint on the opposite side. The affected joints&nbsp;are swollen, hot and excessively tender, and the skin over them&nbsp;is somewhat flushed. The temperature is raised, ranging from&nbsp;about ιοί<sup>0</sup> to 103° F., the pulse rapid, full and soft; the face is&nbsp;flushed, the tongue coated with a thick white fur, and there is&nbsp;thirst, loss of appetite, and constipation.^ The hody is bathed&nbsp;in a profuse perspiration, which has a characteristic sour,&nbsp;disagreeable odour. The urine is diminished, acid and loaded&nbsp;with urates. The attack is of variable duration, and may pass&nbsp;off in a few days or last for some weeks. Relapses are not&nbsp;uncommon when convalescence appears to have been established. Among the complications which may arise are hyperpyrexia, or rapid and extreme rise of temperature, which may&nbsp;run up as high as no° F., when death will speedily ensue unless&nbsp;prompt and energetic treatment by cold baths or icepacks is&nbsp;resorted to. Affections of the heart, pericarditis (inflammation&nbsp;of the fibro-serous sac investing the heart) and endocarditis&nbsp;(inflammation of the lining membrane and the valves of the&nbsp;heart), which arc so frequently associated with rheumatism,&nbsp;should he regarded as part of the disease, rather than as complications of rheumatism. They are far more common in&nbsp;children than in adults, and it is the damage to the valves of the&nbsp;heart in children by rheumatism which lays the foundation of&nbsp;much chronic heart disease in later life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">childhood</span><span class="font2"> the affection of the joints is usually slight, and may be confined to a little pain or stiffness in one or two joints,&nbsp;and is sometimes attributed by parents to “ growing pains.”&nbsp;The constitutional symptoms are also ill-marked and there are&nbsp;no acid sweats, the temperature is not as a rule very high, the&nbsp;tongue not heavily coated, and the child does not appear to&nbsp;be very ill. The heart and pericardium are, however, especially&nbsp;liable to attack, and this may be so insidious in its onset that&nbsp;attention is not called to it till considerable damage has been&nbsp;done to the heart. It is of importance, therefore, that in&nbsp;children the heart should be frequently examined by a physician,&nbsp;when there is the slightest suspicion of an attack of rheumatism.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chorea</span><span class="font2"> or St Vitus’s dance is a common manifestation of rheumatism in children. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Subcutaneous fibrous nodules,</span><span class="font2"> attached&nbsp;to tendons or fibrous structures beneath the skin, are a special&nbsp;feature of the rheumatism of childhood. They are painless,&nbsp;and vary in size from one-eighth to half an inch in diameter.&nbsp;They are not very common, but when present indicate that the&nbsp;rheumatism has a firm hold and that cardiac complications&nbsp;are to be apprehended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The patient should be placed in bed between blankets, and should wear a light flannel or woollen shirt. The affected joints&nbsp;should be kept at rest as far as possible, and enveloped&nbsp;in cotton-wool. Salicylate of soda or salicin, first&nbsp;suggested by Dr Maclagan in 1876, appear to exercise&nbsp;a specific influence in acute rheumatism. They have a powerful effect not only in reducing the temperature, but in relieving&nbsp;the pain and cutting short the attack. Frequent and fairly&nbsp;large doses of salicylate of soda should be administered for the&nbsp;first twenty-four hours: the dose and interval at which it is&nbsp;given should then be gradually reduced till the symptoms&nbsp;subside. In conjunction with this, alkalies such as bicarbonate&nbsp;or citrate of potash should also be administered. The effect&nbsp;of the salicylate should be carefully watched, and the dose&nbsp;reduced if toxic symptoms such as delirium, deafness, and&nbsp;noises in the ears occur. These drugs are of less service in the&nbsp;rheumatism of children than in that of adults, as they do not&nbsp;appear to exercise any specific influence in arresting the cardiac&nbsp;inflammation to which children are specially liable, though&nbsp;they have a marked effect on the joint affections.
