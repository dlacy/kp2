<p><span class="font0">except Cato. The aſſociation of the triumvirs was for a long time kept ſecret ; and nothing appeared to the&nbsp;people except the reconciliation of Pompey and Craſſiis,&nbsp;for which the ſtate reckoned itſelf indebted to Cæſar.&nbsp;The firſt conſequence of the triumvirate was the conſulſhip of Julius Cæſar. But though this was obtained&nbsp;by the favour of Pompey and Craſſus, he found himſelſ diſappointed in the colleague hc wanted to aſſociate&nbsp;with him in that office. He had pitched upon one&nbsp;whom he knew he could manage as he pleaſed, and diſtributed large ſums among the people in order to engage them to vote for him. The ſenate, however, and&nbsp;even Cato himſelf, reſolved to defeat the triumvir at&nbsp;his own weapons ; and having therefore ſet up another&nbsp;candidate, diſtributed ſuch immenſe ſums on the oppoſite ſide, that Cæſar, notwithſtanding the vaſt riches he&nbsp;had acquired, was forced to yield. This defeat proved of ſmall conſequence. Cæſar ſet himſelf to engage&nbsp;the affections of the people ; and this he did, by an&nbsp;agrarian law, ſo effectually, that he was in a manner&nbsp;idolized. The law was in itſelf very reaſonable and&nbsp;juſt ; nevertheleſs, the ſenate, perceiving the deſign&nbsp;with which it was propoſed, thought themſelves bound&nbsp;to oppoſe it. Their oppoſition, however, proved&nbsp;fruitleſs : the conſul Bibulus, who ſhewed himſelf moſt&nbsp;active in his endeavours againſt it, was driven out of&nbsp;the aſſembly with the greateſt indignity, and from that&nbsp;day became of no conſideration ; ſo that Cæſar was&nbsp;reckoned the ſole conſul.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The next ſtep taken by Cæſar was to ſecure the knights, as he had already done the people ; and for&nbsp;this purpoſe he abated a third of the rents which they&nbsp;«annually paid into the treaſury ; after which he governed Rome with an abſolute ſway during the time of&nbsp;his conſulate. The reign of this triumvir, however,&nbsp;was ended by his expedition into Gaul, where his military exploits acquired him the higheſt reputation.—&nbsp;Pompey and Craſſus in the mean time became conſuls,&nbsp;and governed as deſpotically as Cæſar himſelſ had done.&nbsp;On the expiration of their firſt conſulate, the republic&nbsp;fell into a kind of anarchy, entirely owing to the diſor-&lt;]eιs occaſioned by the two late conſuls. At laſt, however, this confuſion was ended by raiſing Craſſus and&nbsp;Pompey to the conſulate a ſecond time. This was no&nbsp;ſooner done, than a new partition of the empire was&nbsp;propoſed. Craſſus was to have Syria and all the eaſtern&nbsp;provinces, Pompey was to govern Africa and Spain,&nbsp;and Cæſar to be continued in Gaul, and all this for the&nbsp;ſpace of five years. This law was paſſed by a great majority ; upon which Craſſus undertook an expedition&nbsp;againſt the Parthians, whom he imagined he ſhould eaſily overcome, and then enrich himſelf with their ſpoils ;&nbsp;Cæſar applied with great aſſiduity to the completing of&nbsp;the conqueſt of Gaul ; and Pompey having nothing to&nbsp;do in his province, ſtaid at Rome to govern the republic&nbsp;alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The affairs of the Romans were now haſtening to a criſis. Craſſus, having oppreſſed all the provinces of&nbsp;the eaſt, was totally defeated and killed by the Parthians * ; after which the two great rivals Cæſar and&nbsp;Pompey were left alone, without any third perſon who&nbsp;could hold the balance between them, or prevent the&nbsp;deadly quarrels which were about to enſue. Matters,&nbsp;however, continued pretty quiet till Gaul was reduced&nbsp;to a Roman province ÿ. The queſtion then was, whether Cæſar or Pompey ſhould firſt reſign the eommanl&nbsp;of their armies, and return to the rank of private perſons. As both parties ſaw·, that whoever firſt laid down&nbsp;his arms muſt of courſe ſubmit to the other, both refuſed to diſarm themſelves. As Cæſar, however, had&nbsp;a naſſed immenſe riches in Gaul, he was now in a condition not only to maintain an army oapable of vying with&nbsp;Pompey, but even to buy over the leading men in Rome&nbsp;to lſis intereſt. One of the conſuls, named </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ÆmiHut&nbsp;Paulus,</span><span class="font0"> coſt. him no leſs than ί 500 talents, or 310,62 j 1.&nbsp;ſterling ; but the other, named </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Marcellus,</span><span class="font0"> could not be&nbsp;gained at any price. Pompey had put at the head of&nbsp;the tribunes one Scribonius Curio, a young patrician of&nbsp;great abilities, but ſo exceedingly debauched and extravagant, that he owed upwards of four millions and a&nbsp;half of our money. Cæſar, by enabling him to ſatisfy&nbsp;his creditors, and ſupplying him with money to purſue&nbsp;his debaucheries, ſecured him in his intereſt ; and Curio,&nbsp;without ſeeming to be in Cæſar’s intereſt, found means&nbsp;to do hi n the moſt eſſential ſervice. He propoſed that&nbsp;both generals ſhould be recalled ; being well aſſured that&nbsp;Pompey would never conſent to part with his army,&nbsp;or lay down the government of Spain with which he&nbsp;had been inveſted, io that Cæſar might draw ſrom Pom-pey’s refuſal a pretence for continuing himſelſ in his&nbsp;province at the head of his troops. This propoſal threw&nbsp;the oppoſite party into great embarraſſments ; and while&nbsp;both profeſſed their pacific intentions, both continued&nbsp;in readineſs for the moſt obſtinate and bloody war.—&nbsp;Cicero took upon himſelf the office of mediator ; but&nbsp;Pompey would hearken to no terms of accommodation.&nbsp;The orator, ſurpriſed to find him ſo obſtinate, at the&nbsp;ſame time that he neglected to ſtrengthen his army,&nbsp;alked him with what forces he deſigned to make head&nbsp;againſt Cæſar? To which the other anſwered, that he&nbsp;needed but ſtamp with his foot, and an army would liait&nbsp;up out of the ground. This confidence he aſſumed becauſe he perſuaded himſelf that Cæſar’s mpn would&nbsp;abandon him if matters came to extremities. Cæſar,&nbsp;however, though he affected great moderation, yet kept&nbsp;himſelf in readineſs for the worſt ; and therefore, when&nbsp;the ſenate palled the fatal decree for a civil war, he was&nbsp;not in the leaſt alarmed. This decree was iſſued in the&nbsp;year 49 B. C. and was expreſſed in the following words:&nbsp;“ Let the conſuls for the year, the proconſul Pompey,&nbsp;the prætors, and all thoſe in or near Rome who have&nbsp;been conſuls, provide lor the public ſafety by the moſt&nbsp;proper means.” This decree was no ſooner paſſed, than&nbsp;the conſul Marcellus went, with his colleague Lentulus,&nbsp;to an houſe at a ſmall diſtance from the town, where&nbsp;Pompey then was ; and preſenting him with a ſword,&nbsp;“ We require you (ſaid he) to take upon you with this&nbsp;the defence of the republic, and the command of her&nbsp;troops.” Pompey obeyed ; and Cæſar was by the fame&nbsp;decree diveſted of his office, and one Lucius Domitius&nbsp;appointed to ſucceed him, the new governor being empowered to raiſe 4000 men in order to take poſſeſſion&nbsp;of his province.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">War being thus reſolved on, the ſenate and Pompey began to make the neceſſary preparations for oppoſing&nbsp;Cæſar. The attempt of the latter to withſtand their&nbsp;authority they termed a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">tumult ;</span><span class="font0"> from which contemptible epithet it appeared that they either did not know,&nbsp;or did not dread, the enemy whom they wert· bringing&nbsp;upon themſelves.
