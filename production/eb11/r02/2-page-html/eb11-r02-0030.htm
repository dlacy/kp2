<p><span class="font3">tvar-car, the drum, quiver, bow and axe. The Earth-Mother and Sky-Father are to be found again and again in religions,&nbsp;at various stages of development, as co-ordinating conceptions&nbsp;which comprehend the universe.@@<sup>1</sup> Sometimes one is more&nbsp;prominent, sometimes the other. In many cases the Sky has&nbsp;been already resolved into the visible firmament and its lord&nbsp;and owner, like the Yoruban Olorun or the Finnic Ukko. The&nbsp;consort of Ukko is </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Maan-emö, “</span><span class="font3"> mother of the earth,” or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">maan&nbsp;ernanicl, “ </span><span class="font3">mistress of the earth.” But the rare expression&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">maan-emd,</span><span class="font3"> “ Mother-earth,” still used in the ancient lays,@@<sup>2&nbsp;</sup>points to the older type of belief in the animation of the productive soil. So the Peruvians designated the Earth as Pacha-mama, “ mother of (all) things.” In Egypt the relation was&nbsp;curiously reversed; the earth-god Keb was the husband of&nbsp;Nut, the sky, represented sometimes as a woman, overarching&nbsp;the earth and supported on hands and feet, sometimes as a&nbsp;gigantic cow, upheld on the outstretched hands of Shu, the&nbsp;atmosphere.@@<sup>3</sup> When earth and sky were still unseparated,&nbsp;Shu thrust himself between them and raised Nut to the heights.&nbsp;So in the New Zealand myth, Rangi and Papa, Sky and Earth,&nbsp;who once clave together in the darkness, were rent asunder&nbsp;by the forest-god Tane-mahuta, who forced up the sky far&nbsp;above him.@@<sup>4</sup> The most elaborate presentment of this mode&nbsp;of thought is to be seen in the organized animism of the ancient&nbsp;state religion of China, where the supreme power is lodged&nbsp;in the living sky (Tien).@@<sup>5</sup> Tien was originally the actual firmament; In the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Shi-King</span><span class="font3"> it is addressed in prayer as “ great&nbsp;and wide,” as “ vast and distant ”; it is even “ blue ” (Pt. II.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">V. </span><span class="font3">6, s). So it is the ancestor of all things; and Heaven and&nbsp;Earth are the father and mother of the world. From the&nbsp;imperial point of view the sky bore the name of Ti, “ ruler,”&nbsp;or Shang Ti, “ supreme ruler ” (emperor) ; and later commentators readily took advantage of this to discriminate between&nbsp;the visible expanse and the indwelling spirit, producing a&nbsp;kind of Theism. But the older conception still holds its own.&nbsp;“ Why ” (says Edkins, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Religion in China,</span><span class="font3"> 95), “ they have been&nbsp;often asked, should you speak of those things which are dead&nbsp;matter, fashioned from nothing by the hand of God, as living&nbsp;beings? And why not? they have replied. The Sky pours&nbsp;down rain and sunshine; the Earth produces corn and grass.&nbsp;We see them in perpetual movement, and we therefore say&nbsp;that they are living.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Tien Ti, Fu Mu,</span><span class="font3"> “ Heaven and Earth,&nbsp;Father and Mother,” are conjoined in common speech, and are&nbsp;the supreme objects of imperial worship. The great altar&nbsp;to Heaven, round in shape like the circuit of the sky, and&nbsp;white as the symbol of the light principle (Yang), stands in&nbsp;the southern suburb of Peking in the direction of light and&nbsp;heat. The altar to the Earth is dark and square, on the north&nbsp;side of the city, the region of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">yin,</span><span class="font3"> the principle of cold and&nbsp;gloom. Associated with the Sky are tablets to the sun and&nbsp;moon, the seven stars of the Great Bear, the five planets,&nbsp;the twenty-eight constellations, and all the stars of heaven;&nbsp;tablets to clouds, rain, wind and thunder being placed next&nbsp;to that of the moon. With the Earth are grouped the tablets&nbsp;to the five lofty Mountains, the three Hills of perpetual peace&nbsp;and the four Seas, the five celebrated Mountains and the four&nbsp;great Rivers.@@<sup>6</sup> The ancient ritual </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Chow Li)</span><span class="font3"> carefully graded&nbsp;the right of sacrifice from the viceroys of provinces down to&nbsp;the humblest district-superintendent who offered to the spirits&nbsp;of his district, the hills, lakes and grains. With these spirits&nbsp;ranged in feudal order in two vast groups beneath Heaven and&nbsp;Earth is associated a third class, those of human beings. They&nbsp;are designated by the same name, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">shin </span><span class="font3">; and they are in-</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font3">extricably mingled with the operations of nature. So in the Vedic hymns the departed “ Fathers ” inhabit the three zones-of earth, air and sky; they are invoked with the streams and&nbsp;mountains of this lower earth, as well as with the dawns and&nbsp;the sky itself; even cosmic functions are ascribed to them;&nbsp;and they adorn the heaven with stars. The Chinese conception of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Shin</span><span class="font3"> under the name of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Shin-to</span><span class="font3"> (Chinese </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">tao)</span><span class="font3"> or&nbsp;“ spirits’-way ” profoundly influenced Japanese thought from&nbsp;the 6th century </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font3"> onwards; and the great Shinto revival of&nbsp;the 18th century brought the doctrine again into prominence.&nbsp;The Japanese </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kami</span><span class="font3"> are the “ higher ” powers, the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">superi,&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">conceived as acting through nature on the one hand and government on the other. Just as the emperor is </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">kami,</span><span class="font3"> and provincial&nbsp;officers of rank, so also mountains, rivers, the sea, thunder,&nbsp;winds, and even animals like the tiger, wolf or fox, are all </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">kami.</span><span class="font3">@@<sup>7</sup></span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"> &nbsp;</span><span class="font3">The spirits of the dead also become </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">kami,</span><span class="font3"> of varying character&nbsp;and position; some reside in the temples built in their honour;&nbsp;some hover near their tombs; but they are constantly active,&nbsp;mingling in the vast multitude of agencies which makes every&nbsp;event in the universe, in the language of Motowori (1730-1801),&nbsp;the act of the Kami. They direct the changing seasons, the&nbsp;wind and the rain; and the good and bad fortunes of individuals,&nbsp;families and states are due to them.@@<sup>8</sup> Everywhere from birth&nbsp;to death the entire life of man is encompassed and guided&nbsp;by the Kami, which are sometimes reckoned at 8,000,000 in&nbsp;number.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">2. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Transition to Polytheism.—</span><span class="font3">In such ways does the Poly-daemonism of early faith survive in the modern practice of religion. The process of enrolling the spirits of the dead in the&nbsp;ranks of what may be more or less definitely called “ gods ”&nbsp;may be seen in the popular usages of India at the present day,&nbsp;or traced in the pages of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Peking Gazette</span><span class="font3"> under the direction&nbsp;of the Board of Rites, one of the most ancient branches of&nbsp;Chinese administration. Whether the higher polytheisms were&nbsp;produced in this fashion out of the cultus of the dead, may,&nbsp;however, be doubted. Many influences have doubtless contributed, and different races have followed different lines of&nbsp;development. No definite succession like the series of ages&nbsp;marked by the use of stone, bronze and iron can be clearly&nbsp;marked. But there must always have been some correspondence&nbsp;between the stages of social advance (or, in certain cases, of&nbsp;degeneration) and the religious interpretation of the world.&nbsp;The formation of clans and tribes, the transitions from the&nbsp;hunting to the pastoral life, and from the pastoral to the&nbsp;agricultural—the struggle with forest and swamp, the clearings&nbsp;for settlement, the protection of the dwelling-place, the safety&nbsp;of flocks and herds, the production of corn,—the migration of&nbsp;peoples, the founding of colonies, the processes of conquest,&nbsp;fusion, and political union—have all reacted on the elaboration&nbsp;of the higher polytheisms, before bards and poets, priesthoods&nbsp;and theological speculators, began to systematize and regulate&nbsp;the relations of the gods. Certain phases of thought may be&nbsp;more or less clearly indicated ; certain elements of race, of&nbsp;local condition, of foreign contact, may be distinguished with&nbsp;more or less historic probability; but no single key can explain&nbsp;all the wide diversity of phenomena. Broadly speaking it&nbsp;may be said that a distinction may be drawn between “ spirits ””&nbsp;and “ gods,” but it is a distinction of degree rather than of kind,&nbsp;obvious enough at the upper end, yet shading off into manifold&nbsp;varieties of resemblance in the lower forms. Some writers,&nbsp;only recognize friendly agencies as gods; but destructive&nbsp;powers like the volcano, or the lords of the underworld, cannot&nbsp;be regarded as the protectors of the life of man, yet they seem in&nbsp;many mythologies to attain the full personalised stature of&nbsp;gods with definite names. Early Greek religion recognized&nbsp;a class of gods of Aversion and Riddance, αποτρόπαιοι and&nbsp;άποπομπαιοι. Neither the spirit nor the god is conceived as</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
