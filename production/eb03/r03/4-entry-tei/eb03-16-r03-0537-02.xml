                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Rowley </hi>(William), who ſtands in the third claſs of
                        dramatic writers, lived in the reign of king Charles I. and received his
                        education at the univerfity of Cambridge ; but vhether he took any degree
                        there, is not evident ; there being but few particulars preſerved in regard
                        to him more than his cloſe intimacy and connection with all the principal
                        wits and poetical geniuſes of that age, by whom he was well beloved, and
                        with ſome of whom he joined in their writings. Wood ftyles him 
                    "the ornament, for wit and ingenuity, of Pembroke-hall
                    in Cambridge.” In a word, he was a very great benefactor to the Engliſh ſtage,
                    having, exclufive of his aid lent to Middleton, Day, Hey wood, Webſter,
                    &amp;c. left us five plays of his own compofing, and one in which even the
                    immortal Shakeſpeare afforded him ſome aſſiſtance.</p>
