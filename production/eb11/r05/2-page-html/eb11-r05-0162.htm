<p><span class="font0">with the outside world cut off; until at last the government was forced to yield, and on the i7/30th of October 1905 the tsar issued the famous manifesto&nbsp;promising to Russia a constitution based on the&nbsp;main principles of modern Liberalism: national representation, freedom of conscience and opinion,&nbsp;guarantees for individual liberty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The enormous programme of constitutional reform foreshadowed in the manifesto had to be elaborated in haste by Count Witte, the minister of the interior, under circumstances&nbsp;by no means promising. The organs of government seemed&nbsp;paralysed by the repudiation of the principle on which their&nbsp;authority was based, and the empire to be in danger of falling&nbsp;into complete anarchy. The revolutionary terrorists took&nbsp;advantage of the situation to multiply outrages; popular&nbsp;agitation was fomented by a multitude of new journals preaching&nbsp;every kind of extravagant doctrine, now that the censor no&nbsp;longer dared to act; in December the trouble&nbsp;culminated in a formidable rising in Moscow. The&nbsp;revolutionary terrorists were countered by the&nbsp;terrorists of the reaction who, under the name of&nbsp;“ the Union of the Russian People,’* began an&nbsp;organized extermination of the elements supposed to be&nbsp;hostile to the traditional regime. The “ black band ” </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(chernaya&nbsp;sotnia),</span><span class="font0"> or “ black hundreds,” as they were branded by public&nbsp;opinion, directed their attacks especially against the Jews,&nbsp;and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">pogroms,@@<sup>1 </sup>i.e.</span><span class="font0"> organized wholesale robbery and murder&nbsp;of Jews, occurred in many places, it was believed with the&nbsp;connivance of the police and veiled approval in exalted</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">quarters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Meanwhile the political parties which were to divide the new Duma had taken shape. Apart from the extremists on&nbsp;one side or the other, frank reactionaries on the&nbsp;Right and Socialists on the Left, two main divisions&nbsp;of opinion revealed themselves in the congresses of&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">zemstvos</span><span class="font0"> that met at Moscow in September and</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">November. In the former there had been a fusion between the Radicals, supporters of the autonomy of Poland and a federal&nbsp;constitution for the empire, and the Independence party&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Osvobozkdenya)</span><span class="font0"> formed by political exiles at Paris in 1903,&nbsp;the fusion taking the name of Constitutional Democrats, known&nbsp;(from a word-play on the initials K.D.) as “ Cadets.” The&nbsp;more moderate elements found a rallying cry in the manifesto&nbsp;of October, took the name of “ the Party of 17 October,” and&nbsp;became known as “ Octobrists.” In the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">zemstvo</span><span class="font0"> congress of&nbsp;November the “ Cadets ” protested against the “ grant ” of&nbsp;a constitution already elaborated, and demanded the convocation of a Constituent Assembly. The Octobrists, on the&nbsp;other hand, supported Count Witte’s moderate programme,&nbsp;the most important provisions of which were the extension&nbsp;(n December 1905) of the suffrage under the stillborn constitution of August, and (20 February 1906) the reorganization&nbsp;of the. Duma as the Lower House, and of the Imperial Council&nbsp;(half of which was to be elective) as the Upper House@@<sup>2</sup> in the&nbsp;new parliament.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The elections were held in March 1906, and on the 27th of April the emperor Nicholas II. solemnly opened the first Duma&nbsp;of the Empire. The “ Cadets ” commanded an overwhelming majority in the Lower House, and their&nbsp;intractable temper and ignorance of affairs became at&nbsp;once apparent. The address in reply to the speech from the&nbsp;throne, voted after a debate in which abstract theories had&nbsp;triumphed over common sense, demanded universal suffrage,&nbsp;the establishment of pure parliamentary government, the&nbsp;abolition of capital punishment, the expropriation of the landlords, a political amnesty, and the suppression of the Imperial&nbsp;Council. When the minister of the interior, M. Goremykin,&nbsp;who had succeeded Witte at the head of the government, met&nbsp;these preposterous demands with a flat refusal, the House Voted,&nbsp;on the motion of M. Kuzmin-Kara vie v, for an appeal to the</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">people (July </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">4).@@<sup>3</sup> </span><span class="font0">Four days later the government dissolved the Duma, M. Goremykin at the same time being replaced by M.&nbsp;Stolypin. The <sup>a</sup> Cadets ” refused to accept this action and, in&nbsp;imitation of the famous meeting in the tennis-court at Versailles,&nbsp;adjourned to Vyborg in Finland, where, under the ex-president of the Duma, M. Muromtsov, they drew up&nbsp;and issued a manifesto calling on the Russian people&nbsp;to refuse taxes and military service. Its sole result,&nbsp;apart from the punishment which afterwards fell on its authors,@@<sup>4&nbsp;</sup>was to show how little the majority of the dissolved Duma had&nbsp;represented the Russian people. Isolated mutinies in the army&nbsp;followed, and terrorist outrages here and there—notably, in&nbsp;August, the dastardly bomb outrage in the Isle of Apothecaries&nbsp;at St Petersburg, which seriously injured one of M. Stolypin’s&nbsp;little daughters; but the mass of the nation and of the army&nbsp;remained wholly unmoved, while the repetition of troubles was&nbsp;made more difficult by the establishment of field courts martial&nbsp;with summary powers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The second Duma met on the 6th of March 1907. M. Stolypin had not ventured to alter the electoral law without parliamentary&nbsp;consent, but with the aid ofacomplaisant Senate the provisions of the existing law were interpreted in a restrictive&nbsp;sense for the purpose of influencing the elections. The&nbsp;result was, however, hardly more satisfactory to the government.&nbsp;The “ Cadets,” it is true, lost many seats both to the Socialists&nbsp;and to the extreme Right, but they held the balance of the House,&nbsp;of which the Octobrists and the Right together only constituted&nbsp;one-fifth, and their leader, M. Golovin, was elected president of&nbsp;the House. The temper of the second Duma, was, indeed, even&nbsp;more democratic than that of the first; but M. Stolypin did his&nbsp;best to work in harmony with it, realizing that under the&nbsp;existing law another dissolution could but lead to a like result,&nbsp;and shrinking from the only alternative—an alteration of the law&nbsp;by a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">coup d’etat,</span><span class="font0"> a course which could only be justified on the plea&nbsp;of extreme necessity. On the 19th of March he laid before the&nbsp;House his programme of reforms, which included the emancipation of the peasants from the control of the communes and the&nbsp;handing over to them of the crown lands and imperial estates.&nbsp;The majority, however, refused to be reconciled. The abolition&nbsp;of the field courts martial was demanded; on the 13th of April&nbsp;a bill for the expropriation of landlords was carried by a two-thirds majority,@@<sup>5</sup> and the 30th the Army Bill would have been&nbsp;lost but for the Polish vote. The crisis came with the discovery&nbsp;of a treasonable plot for the subornation of the army, in which&nbsp;many Socialist members of the Duma were involved. On the&nbsp;14th of June Stolypin’s proposal for the arrest of 16 members and&nbsp;the indictment of 55 was shelved by being referred to a committee.&nbsp;The excuse for which the government had been waiting&nbsp;was thus provided, and two days later the Duma was&nbsp;dissolved. An imperial </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ukaz</span><span class="font0"> fixed the new elections&nbsp;for the 14th of September, and the meeting of the&nbsp;third Duma for the 14th of November; at the same&nbsp;time, in violation of the October manifesto, the electoral law&nbsp;was altered, so as to secure a representation at once more&nbsp;Russian and more conservative. The non-Russian frontier&nbsp;provinces </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(okrainas)</span><span class="font0"> had even before been under-represented&nbsp;(one member for every 350,000 inhabitants, as against one for&nbsp;every 250,000 in the central provinces); the members returned by&nbsp;Poland, the Caucasus and Siberia were now reduced from 89 to&nbsp;39, those from the Central Asian steppes (23) were swept away&nbsp;altogether; the total number of deputies was reduced from 524&nbsp;to 442. Even more drastic were the changes in the electoral&nbsp;machinery, by far the most complicated in Europe, established&nbsp;by the law of 1905.@@<sup>6</sup> This was based on the principle of indirect</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
