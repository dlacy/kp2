<hi rend="italic">of DURHAM,</hi> the cotemporary of William of Malmſhury, took great pains in collecting the monuments of our hiſtory, eſpecially in the north of England, after they had been ſcattered by the Danes. From theſe he compoſed a hiſtory of the kings of England, from A. D. 616 to 1130; with ſome ſmaller hiſtorical pieces. Simeon both ſtudied and taught the ſciences, and particularly the mathematics at Oxford ; and became precentor of the church at Durham, where he died, probably ſoon after the concluſion of his hiſtory, which was continued by John, prior of Hexham, to A. D. 1156.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
