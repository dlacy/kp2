                <p><label>ROLLINAT, MAURICE</label>, (1853-1903), French poet, was born at
                    Châteauroux in 1853. His father represented Indre in the National Assembly of
                    1848, and was a friend of George Sand, whose influence is very marked in young
                    Rollinat's first volume, <hi rend="italic">Dans les brandes</hi> (1877). The
                    volume, however, attracted little attention, and it was with his second
                    publication, very different in manner, that he made his reputation. In <hi
                        rend="italic">Les Névroses,</hi> with the sub-title <hi rend="italic">Les
                        Ames, Les Luxures, Les Refuges, Les Spectres, Les Ténèbres,</hi> he showed
                    himself as a disciple of Charles Baudelaire. He constantly returns in these
                    poems to the physical horrors of death, and is obsessed by unpleasant images.
                    Less <hi rend="italic">outré</hi> in sentiment are <hi rend="italic">L'Abime</hi> (1886), <hi rend="italic">La Nature,</hi> and a book of children’s verse,
                        <hi rend="italic">Le Livre de la Nature</hi> (1893). He was musician as well
                    as poet, and set many of his songs to music. He lost his reason in consequence
                    of his wife’s death from hydrophobia, and died on the 26th of October 1903.</p>
