        <p><span class="font1">suffered perhaps less change than any other of the old offices. It
                still kept its place as the first step on the ladder&nbsp;of promotion, and there
                was still a quæstôr attached to each&nbsp;governor of a senatorial province, to the
                consuls in Rome,&nbsp;and to the princeps himself as
            proconsul.@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The senate alone among republican institutions retained some
                importance and influence. The virtual abolition of&nbsp;the comitia, and the
                degradation of the magistracies left&nbsp;the senate to stand alone as the
                representative of republicanism, and it thus came to be regarded as sharing
                the&nbsp;government of the empire with the princeps himself. The&nbsp;magistrates
                elected by the senate are contrasted with the&nbsp;legates, prefects, and
                procurators appointed by the&nbsp;emperor. It is to the senate, in theory, that the
                supreme&nbsp;power reverts in the absence of a princeps. It is by&nbsp;decree of the
                senate that the new princeps immediately&nbsp;receives his powers and
                    privileges,@@<sup>2</sup> though he is still&nbsp;supposed to derive them
                ultimately from the people, and&nbsp;is as a rule actually the nominee of the
                soldiers. After&nbsp;the cessation of all legislation by the comitia, the
                only&nbsp;law-making authority, other than that of the princeps by&nbsp;his edicts,
                was that of the senate by its decrees.@@<sup>3</sup> Its&nbsp;judicial authority was
                parallel with that of the emperor,&nbsp;and at the close of the 1st century we find
                the senators&nbsp;claiming, as the emperor’s “ peers,” to be exempt from
                    his&nbsp;jurisdiction.@@<sup>4</sup> But in spite of the outward dignity
                and&nbsp;importance of this position, and of the politic deference&nbsp;with which
                it was frequently treated, the senate became&nbsp;gradually almost as powerless in
                reality as the comitia and&nbsp;the magistracies. The two great supports of its
                authority&nbsp;under the republic—its identification with the interests&nbsp;of a
                powerful aristocracy and the subserviency of the&nbsp;magistrates—both fell away
                under the empire.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The senators continued indeed to be taken as a rule from the ranks of
                the wealthy, and a high property qualification was established by Augustus as a
                condition of membership, but any effect which this may have had in giving
                independence to the position of a senator was counterbalanced&nbsp;by the facilities
                it afforded to the emperors for securing&nbsp;their own ascendency by subsidizing
                those whose property&nbsp;fell short of the required standard, and who thus
                became&nbsp;simply the paid creatures of their imperial
                patrons.@@<sup>5&nbsp;</sup>Admission to the senate was possible only by favour
                of&nbsp;the emperor, as at once controlling the elections to the&nbsp;magistracies,
                which still as of old gave entrance to the&nbsp;curia, and as invested with the
                power of directly creating&nbsp;senators by “adlectio,” a power which from the time
                of&nbsp;Vespasian onwards was freely used.@@<sup>6</sup> As the result,
                the&nbsp;composition of the senate rapidly altered. Under&nbsp;Augustus and Tiberius
                it still contained many representatives of the old republican families, whose
                prestige,&nbsp;influence, and ancestral traditions were some guarantee
                for&nbsp;their independence. But this element soon disappeared.&nbsp;The ranks of
                the old nobility were thinned by natural&nbsp;decay and by the jealous fears of the
                last three Claudian&nbsp;emperors. Vespasian @@<sup>7</sup> flooded the senate with
                new men&nbsp;from the municipal towns of Italy and the Latinized&nbsp;provinces of
                the West. Trajan and Hadrian, both pro-</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">vincials themselves, carried on the same policy, and by the close of
                the 2d century even the Greek provinces of&nbsp;the East had their representatives
                among the senators of&nbsp;Rome. Some, no doubt, of these provincials, who
                constituted the great majority of the senate in the 3d century,&nbsp;were men of
                wealth and mark, but many more were of low&nbsp;birth, on some rested the stain of a
                servile descent, and all&nbsp;owed alike their present position and their chances
                of&nbsp;further promotion to the emperor.@@<sup>8</sup> The procedure of
                the&nbsp;senate was as completely at the mercy of the princeps as&nbsp;its
                composition. He was himself a senator and the first&nbsp;of senators;@@<sup>9</sup>
                Iiepossessedthemagisterial prerogatives of&nbsp;convening the senate, of laying
                business before it, and of&nbsp;carrying senatus consulta ;@@<sup>10</sup> above
                all, his tribunician&nbsp;power enabled him to interfere at any stage, and to
                modify&nbsp;or reverse its decisions. The share of the senate in the&nbsp;government
                was in fact determined by the amount of&nbsp;administrative activity which each
                princeps saw fit to allow&nbsp;it to exercise, and by the extent to which he chose
                to use&nbsp;it as an instrument of government. And this share&nbsp;became steadily
                smaller. The jurisdiction assigned it by&nbsp;Augustus and Tiberius was in the 3d
                century limited to&nbsp;the hearing of such cases as the emperor thought fit
                to&nbsp;send for trial, and these became steadily fewer in number.&nbsp;Its control
                of the state treasury, as distinct from the&nbsp;imperial fiscus, and of the
                so-called senatorial provinces&nbsp;passed in fact to the emperor and his officials,
                and was&nbsp;only occasionally revived by the special favour of emperors&nbsp;who,
                like Marcus Aurelius,@@<sup>11</sup> were sincerely attached to old&nbsp;traditions,
                or, like Severus Alexander and Tacitus, hoped by&nbsp;close alliance with the senate
                to escape from the evils of a&nbsp;military despotism.@@<sup>12</sup> Even in Rome
                and Italy its control&nbsp;of the administration was gradually transferred to
                the&nbsp;prefect of the city, and after the reign of Hadrian to&nbsp;imperial
                officers (juridici) charged with the civil administration.@@<sup>13</sup> The part
                still played by its decrees in the&nbsp;modification of Roman law has been dealt
                with elsewhere&nbsp;(see p. 704 </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">supra),</span><span class="font1"> but it is clear that
                these decrees&nbsp;did little else than register the expressed wishes of
                the&nbsp;emperor and his personal advisers.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The growing impotence of all other authority than that of the
                princeps inevitably altered the character of the&nbsp;principate. Even under
                Augustus, Tiberius, and the&nbsp;Claudian emperors, there is a silent and steady
                concentration of all authority in the hands of the princeps ; not only&nbsp;the army
                and the provinces, but even Rome and Italy, are&nbsp;in reality governed by him,
                though still with a lingering&nbsp;respect for the traditional prerogatives of the
                senate and&nbsp;the senatorial magistrates ; in the reigus of
                Caligula,&nbsp;Claudius, and Nero the politic disguise under which&nbsp;Augustus and
                Tiberius had endeavoured to conceal the&nbsp;extent of their power was thrown
                contemptuously aside.&nbsp;In the administration of justice and in finance, as
                well&nbsp;as in military and foreign affairs, the authority of the&nbsp;princeps is
                paramount ; and his own personal subordinates—legates, prefects, procurators, and
                even his freed-men@@<sup>14</sup>—divide between them the real work of
                government.&nbsp;This increase of power was accompanied by a corresponding elevation
                of the princeps himself above the level&nbsp;of all other citizens. The
                comparatively modest household and simple life of Augustus were replaced by a
                more</span></p>
