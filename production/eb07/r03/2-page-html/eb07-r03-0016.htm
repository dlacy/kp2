<p><span class="font0">RUBIN, or ROBOAN, a small island in the Red Sea, at the Straits of Bahelmandel, separated from the continent&nbsp;by a channel not above a stone-cast in breadth, which may&nbsp;be forded at low water. Here pilots are taken in for the&nbsp;voyage up the Red Sea, and to its different ports.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RUBRIC, in the canon law, signifies a title or article in certain ancient law-books, and which was so called because&nbsp;written, as the titles of the chapters in our ancient bibles&nbsp;are, in red letters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RUBY, a species of precious stone, belonging to the siliceous genus. The ruby is of various colours, as, of a deep red colour inclining a little to purple, or the carbuncle of&nbsp;Pliny ; the spinell, of the colour of a bright corn poppy&nbsp;flower; and the balass or pale red inclining to violet. Tavernier and Dutens inform us that in the East Indies all&nbsp;coloured gems are named rubies, without regard to what&nbsp;their colours may be ; and that the particular colour is added to the name of each in order to distinguish them from&nbsp;one another. The spinell rubies are above half the value&nbsp;of diamonds of the same weight; and the balass is valued&nbsp;at thirty shillings per carat. Tavernier mentions one hundred and eight rubies in the throne of the Great Mogul,&nbsp;from one to two hundred carats, and a round one almost&nbsp;two and a half ounces. There is also mention made by&nbsp;other travellers, of rubies exceeding two hundred carats in&nbsp;weight. According to Dutens, a perfect ruby, if it weigh&nbsp;more than three and a half carats, is of greater value than&nbsp;a diamond of the same weight. If it weigh one carat, it is&nbsp;worth ten guineas ; if two carats, forty guineas; three carats,&nbsp;a hundred and fifty guineas; if six carats, upwards of a&nbsp;thousand guineas.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RUDBECK, Olaus, a learned Swedish physician, w<sup>r</sup>as born of an ancient and noble family in 1630. He became&nbsp;professor of medicine at Upsal, where he acquired great applause by his extensive knowledge, and died in 1702. His&nbsp;principal works are twofold, 1. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Exercitatio Anatomica, ex-hibens ductus novos hepaticos aquosos, et vasa glandularum&nbsp;serosa,</span><span class="font0"> in 4to; 2. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Atlantica, sive Manheim, vera Jopheti posterorum sedes ac patria,</span><span class="font0"> four vols. folio. He there endeavours to prove that Sweden was the country whence all the&nbsp;ancient Pagan divinities and our first parents were derived ;&nbsp;and that the Germans, English, French, Danes, Greeks, and&nbsp;Romans, with all other nations, originally came from thence.&nbsp;This work, in a complete state, is of the greatest rarity.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RUDGELEY, a market-town in the county of Stafford, of the hundred of Cuttlestone, 131 miles from London, and&nbsp;seven from Lichfield. It is a well-built place, and contains&nbsp;many manufacturers of hats and of other articles ; and being, by meansof canals, favoured with water communication&nbsp;with the whole of the interior of the kingdom, has considerable trade. There is a good market, which is held on Tuesday. The population amounted in 1801 to 2030, in 1811&nbsp;to 2213, in 1821 to 2677, and in 1831 to 3165.</span></p>

It is&nbsp;surrounded with walls, is well built and paved, and contains 1&nbsp;the palace of the prince, two churches, a theological semi-'&nbsp;nary, and two hospitals, with 550 houses, and 4160 inhabitants, who subsist by the expenditure of the government&nbsp;and the college, by making woollen goods, and by breweries&nbsp;and distilleries.

<p><span class="font0">RUDDIMAN, Thomas, one of the most eminent grammarians which Scotland has produced, was born in October 1674, at Raggel, in the parish of Boyndie and county of&nbsp;Banff’. His father, James Ruddiman, was a farmer, and&nbsp;strongly attached to the house of Stuart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Mr Ruddiman was instructed in the principles of Latin grammar at the parish school of Boyndie, where his application was so vigorous, and his progress so rapid, that he&nbsp;quickly surpassed all his class-fellows. His master, George&nbsp;Morrison, who was a skilful and attentive teacher, being unwilling to check his ardour for learning, permitted him to&nbsp;follow the impulse of his genius, and to advance without&nbsp;waiting the slow progress of the other boys.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The pleasure which the youthful mind receives from vivid description, though wild and romantic, approaches to ecstasy,&nbsp;and often makes an impression which remains indelible.&nbsp;Whilst at school, the first book which charmed the opening&nbsp;mind of Ruddiman was Ovid’s Metamorphoses; nor did he&nbsp;cease to relish the beauties of this author when his judgment&nbsp;was mature, for during the rest of his life Ovid was his favourite poet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">At the age of sixteen he became anxious to pursue his studies at the university ; but his father thinking him too&nbsp;young, opposed his inclination. Hearing of the competition trial which was annually held at King’s College, Aberdeen, for a certain number of bursaries on the foundation&nbsp;of that university, Ruddiman’s ambition was kindled. Without the knowledge of his father, and with only a single&nbsp;guinea in his pocket, which his sister had privately given&nbsp;him, he set out for that place. On the road he was met by&nbsp;a company of gipsies, who robbed him of his coat, his shoes,&nbsp;his stockings, and his guinea. But this misfortune did not&nbsp;damp his enterprising spirit. He continued his journey to&nbsp;Aberdeen, presented himself before the professors as a candidate ; and, though he had neither clothes to give him a&nbsp;decent appearance, nor friends to recommend him, he gained the first prize.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">After attending the university for four years, he obtained the degree of master of arts, an honour of which he was always proud. The thesis says, the disputation on this occasion lasted </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ab aurora usque ad vesperum,</span><span class="font0"> that is, “ from&nbsp;morning till night.” Though Ruddiman was only twenty&nbsp;years of age when he left the university, it appears from a&nbsp;book entitled </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rhetoricorum Libri tres,</span><span class="font0"> composed before this&nbsp;period, but never published, that he had then read the Roman classics with uncommon attention and advantage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">He was soon after engaged as a tutor to the son of Mr Robert Young of Auldbar, the great grandson of Sir Peter&nbsp;Young, who under the direction of Buchanan had been preceptor of James VI. His income here must have been&nbsp;very small, or his situation unpleasant; for within a year&nbsp;he accepted the office of schoolmaster in the parish of Laurencekirk. The profession of schoolmaster in a country&nbsp;parish at that period could not open any field for ambition,&nbsp;nor any prospect of great emolument; for by an act of parliament passed in 1633, the salary appropriated to this office&nbsp;could not be increased above 200 merks Scotch, or L.ll. 2s.&nbsp;2|d. sterling. In discharging the duties of this humble&nbsp;but important station, it is probable that he used Simson’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rudimenta Grammatica,</span><span class="font0"> which was then generally taught&nbsp;in the northern schools, and by which he himself had been&nbsp;instructed in the principles of Latin grammar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When Ruddiman had spent three years and a half in this employment, the celebrated Dr Pitcairne happening to pass&nbsp;through Laurencekirk, was detained in that village by a</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
