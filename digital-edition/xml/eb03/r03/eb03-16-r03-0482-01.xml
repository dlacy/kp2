<p><label>ROPE</label>
is a word too familiar to need a definition ; and w <hi rend="sup">r</hi> e need ſay no more than that it is only applied. to a conſiderable collection of twilled fibres. Smaller bands are called lines, ſtrings, cords ; and it is not applied with great propriety even to thoſe, unleſs they are compoſed of ſmaller things of the ſame kind twiſted together. Two hay bands twiſted together would be called a <hi rend="italic">rope.</hi> All the different kinds of this manufacture, from a ſiſhing-line or whip cord to the cable of a firſt rate ſhip of war, go by the general name of Cordage.</p><p>Ropes are made of every ſubſtance that is ſuſſiciently fibrous, flexible, and tenacious, but chiefly of the barks of plants. The Chineſe and other orientals even make them of the ligneous parts of ſeveral plants, ſuch as certain bamboos and reeds, <hi rend="sub">x</hi> the Items oſ the aloes, the fibrous covering of the cocoa nut, the filaments of the cotton pod, and the leaves of ſome graſſes, ſuch as the ſparte <hi rend="italic">(Lygeum,</hi> Linn.) The aide <hi rend="italic">(Agave,</hi> Linn.) and the ſparte exceed all others in ſtrength. But the barks of plants are the moſt productive oſ fibrous matter fit for this manufacture. Thoſe of the Linden tree. <hi rend="italic">(Teloa),dl</hi> the willow, the bramble, the nettle, are frequently uſed : but hemp and flax are of all others the beſt ; and of theſe the hemp is preferred, and employed in all cordage exceeding the lize of a line, and even in many of this denomination.</p><p>Hemp is very various in its uſeſul qualities. Theſe are great ſtrength, and the length and ſineneſs oſ the fibre. Being a plant oſ very greedy growth, it ſucks up much of the unaltered juices of the foil, and therefore difi⅛rs greatly according to its toil, cljmate, and culture. The beſt in Europe comes to us through Riga, to which port it is brought from very diſtant places to the fouthw∙ard. It is known by the name of <hi rend="italic">Riga rein</hi> (that is, clean) hemp. Its fibre is not the longeſt (at leaſt in the dreſſed ſtate in which we get it) of all others, but it is the ſineſt, moſt flexible, and ſtrongeſt. The next to this is ſuppoſed to be the Pe-terſhurgh braak hemp. Other hemps are eſteemed nearly in the following * der :—Riga outſhot, Peterſ-burgh outſhot, hemp from Koningſhurgh, Archangel, Sweden, Memel. <hi rend="italic">Chucking</hi> is a name given to a hemp that comes from various places, long in the fibre, but coarſe and harſh, and its ſtrength is inferior to hemps which one would think weaker. Its texture is ſuch, that it does not admit ſplitting with the hatchet ſo as to be more completely dreſſed. It is therefore kept in its coarſe form, and uſed for inferior cordage. It is however a good and ſtrong hemp, but wall not make fine work. There are doubtleſs many good hemps in the ſouthern parts of Europe, but little of them is brought to our market. Codilla, half clean, &amp;c. are portions of the above-mentioned hemps, ſeparated by the dreffiπg, and may be conſidered as broken fibres oſ thoſe hemps.</p><p>Only the firſt qualities are manufactured for the rigging of the royal navy and for the flιips of the Eaſt India company.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Rop5-.∙.!Λ~ing is an art of very great importance; and there are few that better deſerve the attention of the intelligent obſerver. Hardly any art can be carried on without the aſſiſtance oſ the rope-maker. Cordage makes the very ſinevvs and muſcles of a ſhip; and</hi> <hi rend="sup">,</hi> every improvement which can be made in its prépara-' tiυn, either in reſpect to ſtrength or pliablenefs, muſt be of immenſe ſervice to the mariner, and t√ the commerce and the defence of nations.</p><p>We ſhall give a very ſhort account of the manufacture, which will not indeed fully inſtruct the artificers, but will give ſuch a view of the proceſs as ſhall enable the reader to judge, from principle, of the propriety of the different parts of the manipulation, and perceive its defects, and the means ſor removing them.</p><p>The aim oſ the rope-maker is to unite the ſtrength of a great number oſ fibres. This would be done in the completed manner by <hi rend="sup">r</hi> laying the fibres parallel to J each other, and faltening the bundle at the two ends : <hi rend="sub">1</hi> but this would be of very limited uſe, becauſe the fibres are ſhort, not exceeding three feet and a half at an average. They muſt therefore be entangled together, in ſuch a manner that the ſtrength of a fibre ſhall not be able to draw <hi rend="sup">r</hi> it out from among the reſt of the bundle. This is done by twilling or twining them together, which cauſes them mutually to compreſs each other. When the fibres are ſo diſpoſed in a long , ſkain, that their ends ſucceed each - other along its length, without many of them meeting in one place, and this ſkain is twiſted round and round, we may cauſe them to compreſs each other to any degree we pleaſe, and the friction on a fibre which we attempt to pull out may be more than its coheſion can overcome. It will therefore break. Conſequently, if we pull at this twiſted ſkain, we will not ſeparate it by drawing one parcel out from among thereſt, but the whole fibres will break ; and if the diſtribution of the fibres has been very equable, the fi&lt;ain will be nearly of the ſame ſtrength in every part. If there is .any part where many ends of fibres meet, the ſkain will break</p><p>in that part.</p><p>We know very well that w-e can twiſt a ſkain of fibres ſo very hard, that it will break with any attempt to twiſt it harder. In this ſtate all the fibres are already ſtrained to the utmoſt of their ſtrength. Such a ſkain of fibre· can have no ſtrength. It cannot carry a weight, becauſe each fibre is already ſtrained in the ſame manner as if loaded with as much weight as it is able to bear. What we have ſaid of this extreme caſe is true in a certain extent of every degree of twiſt that we give the fibres. Whatever force is actually exerted by a twuſted fibre, in order that it may ſuſſiciently compreſs the reſt to hinder them from being drawn out, muſt be conſidered as a weight hanging on that fibre, and muſt be deduced from its abſolute ſtrength of coheſion, before we can eſtimate the ſtrength of the ſkain. The ſtrength of the ſkain is the remainder of the abſolute ſtrength of the fibres, after we have deduced the force employed in twuſting them together.</p><p>From this obſervation may be deduced a fundamental principle in rope-making, that all twiſting, beyond what is neceſſary ſor preventing the fibres from being drawm out without breaking, diminiſhes the ſtrength of the cordage, and ſhould be avoided when in our power. It is of importance to keep this in mind.</p>

<p>it is neceſſary then to twiſt the fibres of hemp together, in order to make a rope ; but we ſhould make a very bad rope if "we contented ourſelves with twilling together a bunch of hemp ſuſſicſently large to with-•ſtand the ſtrains to which the rope is to be expoſed» As ſoon as we let it go out of our hands, it would un-twiſt itſelf, and be again a looſe bundle of hemp ; for the fibres are ſtrained, and they are in a conſiderable degree elaſtic ; they contract again, and thus untwiſt the rope or ſkain. it is neceſſary to contrive the twiſt in ſuch a manner, that the tendency to untwiſt in one part may actragainſt the fame tendency in another and balance it. The proceſs, therefore, of rope-making is more complicated.</p><p>The firſt part of this proceſs is spinning of rope» yarns. This is done in various ways, and with different machinery, according to the nature of the intended cordage. We- ſhall confine our dcſcription to the manufacture of the larger kinds, ſuch as are uſed for the ſtanding and running rigging of ſhips.</p><p>1 An alley or walk is incloſed for the purpoſe, about <hi rend="sub">ι</hi> 200 fathoms long, and of a breadth ſuited to the extent of the manufacture. It is ſometimes covered above. At the upper end of this rope-walk is ſet up the ſpm-ning-whεel, of a fprm' reſembling that in ſig- i. The ’band of this wheel goes over ſeveral rollers called whirls, turning on pivots in braſs holes. The pivots at one end come through the frame, and terminate in little hooks. The wheel being turned by a winch, gives motion in one direction to all thoſe whirls. The ſpinner has a bundle of dreſſed hemp round his waiſt, with the two ends meeting before - him. The hemp is laid in this bundle in the ſame way that women ſpread the flax on the diſtaff. There is great variety in this ; but the general aim is to lay the fibres in ſuch a manner, that as long as .the bundle laſts there may be an equal number of the ends at the extremity, and that a fibre may never offer itſelf double or in a bight. The ſpinner draws out a proper number of fibres, twiſts them with his fingers, and having got a ſuſſicient length detached, he fixes it to the hook of a whirl. The wheel is now turned, and the ſkain is twilled, becoming what is called a rope-yarn, and the ſpinner walks backwards down the rope-walk. The part already twiſted draws along with it more fibres out of the bundle. The ſpinner aids this with his fingers, ſupplying hemp in due proportion as he walks away from the wheel, and taking care that the fibres come in equally from both ſides -of his bundle, and that they enter always with their ends, and not by the middle, which would double them. He ſhould alſo endeavour to enter every fibre at the heart of the yam. Ί his will cauſe all the fibres to mix equally in making it up, and will make the work ſmootli, becauſe one end of each fibre is by this means buried among the reft, and the other end only lies outward ; and this, in paſſing through the graſp of the ſpinner, who preſſes it tight with his thumb and palm, is alſo made to lie ſmootli. The greateſt fault that can be committed in ſpinning is to allow a ſmall thread to be twiſted off from one ſide of the hemp, and then to cover this with hemp ſupplied from the other ſide : for it is evident that the fibres of the central thread make very long ſpirals, and the ſkin of fibres which covers them muſt be much more oblique. This covering has but little connection with what is below it, and will eafily be detached. But even while it remains, the yarn cannot be ſtrong ; for on pulling it, the middle part, which lies the ſtraighteſt, muſt bear all the ſtrain, while the outer fibres, that are lying obliquely, are only drawn a little more parallel to the axis. This defect will always happen if the hemp be ſupplied hi.a conſiderable body to a yarn that is then ſpinning ſmall. Into whatever part of the yarn it is made to enter, it becomes a fortof looſely connected wrapper. Such a yarn, when untwiſted a little, will have the appearance of ſig. 2. while a good yarn looks like ſig. 3. A good ſpinner therefore endeavours always to ſupply the hemp in the form of a thin fiat ſkain with his left hand, while his right is employed in graſp-ing firmly the yarn that is twining off, and in holding it tight from the whirl, that it may not run into loops or kinks..</p><p>It is evident, that both the arrangement of the fibres and the degree of twiſting depend on the ſkill and dexterity of the ſpinner, and that he muſt be inſtructed, not by a book, but by a matter. The degree of twiſt depends on the rate of the wheel’s motion, combined with the retrograde walk of the ſpinner.</p><p>We may ſuppoſe lιim arrived at the <hi rend="italic">lower</hi> end of the walk, or as far as is neceſſary for the intended length of his yarn·. He calls out, and another ſpinner immediately detaches the yarn from the hook of the whirl, gives it to another, who carries it aſide to the reel, and this ſecond ſpinner attaches his own hemp to the whiιl hook. In the mean time, the firſt ſpinner keeps faſt hold of the end of his yarn ; for the hemp, being dry, is very elaſtic, and if he were to let it go out of his hand it would inſtantly untwiſt, and become little better than looſe hemp. He waits, therefore, till he fees the reeler begin to turn the reel, and he. goes flowly up the walk, keeping the yam of an equal tightneſs all the way, till he arrives at the wheel, where he waits with his yarn in hand till another ſpinner has ſiniſhed his yarn. 1 he firſt ſpinner takes it off the whirl hook, joins it to his own, that it may follow it on the reel, and begins a new yam.</p><p>Rope-yarns, for the greateſt part of the large rigging, are from a quarter of an inch to ſomewhat more than a third of an inch in circumference, or of ſuch a ſize that 160 fathoms weigh from 3 ' <hi rend="sub">τ</hi> to 4 pounds when white. The different ſizes of-yarns are named from the numbe&gt; of them contained in a ſtrand of a rope of three inches in circumference. Few are ſo coarſe that 16 will make a ſtrand of Britiſh ccrd3ge ; 18 is not unfrequent for cable yarns, or yams ſpun from harſh and coarſe hemp ; 25 is, we believe, the fineſt ſize which is worked up for the rigging of a ſhip, Much finer are indeed ſpun for founding lines, liſhing lines, and many other marine uſes. and for the other demands ot ſociety. Ten good ſpinners will work up above 600 weight of hemp in a day; but this depends on the weather. In very dry weather the hemp is very elaſtic, and requires great attention to make ſmootli work. In the warmer climates, the ſpinner is permitted to moillen the rag with which he graſps the yarn in his right hand-for each yarn. No work can be done in an open ſpinning walk in rainy weather, becauſe the yarns would not take on the tar, if immediately tarred, and would rot if kept on the reel for a long. time.</p><p>The ſecond part of the proceſs is. the converſion oſ</p>
<pb xml:id="eb03-16-r03-0484" facs="gri_33125011196389_0490.tif"/>
<p>the yarns into what may with propriety be called a rope, cord, or line. That we may have a clear conception of the principle which regulates this part of the proceſs, we ſhall begin with the ſimpleſt poſſible caſe, the union of two yarns into one line. This is not a very uſual fabric for rigging, but we ſelect it for its ſimplicity.</p><p>When hemp has been ſplit into very fine fibres by the hatchet, it becomes exceedingly ſoft and pliant, and after it has lain for ſome time in the form of fine yarn, it may be unreeled and thrown looſe, without loſing much of its twiſt. Two ſuch yarns may be put on the whirl of a ſpinning wheel, and thrown, like flaxen yarn, ſo as to make ſewing thread. It is in this way, indeed, that the ſailmaker’s ſewing thread is manufactured; and when it has been kept on the reel, or on balls or bobbins, for ſome time, it retains its twiſt as well as its uſes require. But this is by no means the caſe with yarns ſpun for great cordage. The hemp is ſo elaſtic, the number of fibres twiſted together is ſo great, and the diameter of the yarn (which is a fort of lever on which the elaſticity of the fibre exerts itſelf) is ſo conſiderable, that no keeping will make the fibres retain this con-ftrained poſition. The end of a rope-yarn being thrown looſe, it will immediately untwiſt, and this with conſiderable force and ſpeed. It would, therefore, be a fruſtleſs attempt to twiſt two ſuch yarns together ; yet the ingenuity of man has contrived to make uſe of this very tendency to untwiſt not only to counteract itſelf, but even to produce another and a permanent twiſt, which requires force to undo it, and which will receiver itſelf when this force is removed. Every perſon muſt recollect that, when he has twiſted a packthread very hard with his fingers between his two hands, if he ſlackens the thread by bringing his hands nearer together, the packthread will immediately curl up, running into loops or kinks, and will even twiſt itſelf into a neat and firm cord. FamiΓiar as this fact is, it would puzzle any perſon not accuſtomed to theſe ſubjects to explain it with diſtinctneſs. We ſhall conſider it with ſome care, not as a piece of mechanical curioſity, but as a fundamental principle in this manufacture, which will give us clear inſtructions to direct us in the moſt delicate part of the whole proceſs. And we beg the attention of the artiſts themſelves to a thing which they ſeem to have overlooked.</p><p>Let <hi rend="italic">mil, nd (</hi> fig. 4.) be two yarns fixed to one point <hi rend="italic">d <hi rend="sub">i</hi></hi> and let both of them be twiſted, each round its own axis, in the direction <hi rend="italic">ab c,</hi> which will cauſe the fibres to lie in a ſcrew form, as repreſented in the figure. If the end <hi rend="italic">d</hi> of the yarn <hi rend="italic">m d</hi> were at liberty to turn round the point <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> it would turn accordingly, as often as the end <hi rend="italic">m</hi> is turned round, and the yarn would acquire no twiſt ; but being attached to ſome ſolid body it cannot turn without turning this body. It has, however, this tendency, and the body muſt be forcibly prevented from turning. If it be held faſt for a time, and then let go, it will be turned round, and it will not ftop till it has turned as often as the end <hi rend="italic">m</hi> has been twiſted, and now all the twiſt will be undone. Thus it is the tendency of the yarn <hi rend="italic">rn d</hi> to untwiſt at the end <hi rend="italic">d</hi> (becauſe it is kept faſt at wι), which produces this motion of the body attached to it at <hi rend="italic">d.</hi> What we have ſaid of the yarn <hi rend="italic">m d</hi> is equally true of the yarn <hi rend="italic">nd.</hi> Both tend to turn, and will turn, the body attached at <hi rend="italic">d</hi> round the common ajps, in the ſame direc</p><p>tion in which they are twiſted. Let fig. 5. be ſuppoſed a croſs ſection of the two yarns touching each other at <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> and there glued to a board. The fibres of each pull obliquely, that is, they both pull away from the board, and pull laterally. The direction of this lateral pull of the ſibres in the circumference of each yarn is repreſented by the little darts drawn round the circumferences. Theſe actions directly oppoſe and balance each other at <hi rend="italic">d</hi> ; but in the ſemicircles <hi rend="italic">o e t, tſo,</hi> they evidently conſpire to turn the board round in the ſame direction. The ſame may be ſaid of the outer halves of any circles deſeribed within theſe. In the inner halves of theſe inner circles the actions of ſome fibres oppoſe each other ; but in every circle there are many more conſpiring actions than oppoſing ones, and the conſpi-ring actions exert themſelves by longer levers, ſo that their joint momentum greatly exceeds that of the op-poling forces. It may be demonſtrated, that if all the ſibres exert equal forces, the force which tends to turn the board round the common axis is J of the force employed to twiſt both tilg yarns.</p><p>Suppoſe then that the ſolid body to which the yarns are attached is at liberty to turn round the common axis ; it cannot do this without carrying the yarns round with it. They muſt, therefore, turn round each other, and thus compoſe a rope or cord <hi rend="italic">k l,</hi> having its . component yarns (now called <hi rend="italic">flrands)</hi> lying in a direction oppoſite to that of the ſibres in each ſtrand. The rope will take this twiſt, while each of the ſtrands is really untwiſting, and the motion will not ſtop till all is again in equilibrio. If the yarns had no diameter and no rigidity, their elaſtic contraction would not be balanced till the cord had made half the number of turns which had been given to that part of the yarn which is thus doubled up. But, as the yarns have a ſenſible diameter, the ſame ultimate contraction of the ſibres will be expended by the twiſting of the cord in fewer turns, even if the yarns had no rigidity. The turns neceſſary for this purpoſe will be ſo much fewer, in proportion to the twiſt of the yarns, as the ſibres of the yarn lie more obliquely, that is, as the yarns are more twiſted. But further, this contractile force has to overcome the rigidity or ſtiſſneſs of the yarns. This requires force merely to <hi rend="italic">bend</hi> it into the ſcrew form ; and therefore, when all is again at reſt, the ſibres are in a ſtate of ſtrain, and the rope is not ſo much cloſed by doubling as it would have been had the yarns been ſofter. If any thing can be done to it in this ſtate which will ſoften the yarns, it will twiſt itſelf more up. It has therefore a <hi rend="italic">tendency</hi> to twiſt more up ; and if this be aided by an external force which will bend the ſtrands, this will happen. Beating it with a ſpft mallet will have this efj ſectj or, if it be forcibly twiſted till the ſibres are allowed to contract as much as they would have done had the yarn been perfectly ſoft, the cord will keep this twiſt without any effort ; and this muſt be conſidered as its moſt perfect ſtate, in relation to the degree of twiſt originally given to the yarns. It will have no tendency to run into kinks, which is both troubleſome and dangerous, and the fibres will not be exerting any uſeleſs effort.</p><p>To attain this ſtate ſhould therefore be the aim of every part of this ſecond proceſs ; and this principle, ſhould be kept in view through the whole of it.</p><p>The component parts of a rope are called ſtrands, aa</p>
<pb xml:id="eb03-16-r03-0485" facs="gri_33125011196389_0491.tif"/>
<p>has been already obſerved ; and the operation of uniting them with a permanent twiſt is called <hi rend="italic">laying</hi> or <hi rend="italic">doling,</hi> ſthe latter term being chiefly appropriated to cables and other very large cordage.</p><p><hi rend="sup">n</hi> Lines and cordage leſs than 1J inches circumference are laid at the ſpinning-wheel. The workman fattens the ends of eachof two or three yarns to ſeparatewhirl-lrooks. The remote ends are united in a knot. This is put on one of the hooks of a ſwivel called the <hi rend="italic">loper,</hi> repreſent-ed in fig. 6. and care is taken that the yarns are of equal lengths and twiſt. A piece of ſoft cord is put on the other hook of the loper ; and, being put over a pulley ſeveral feet from the ground, a weight is hung on it, which ſtretches the yarn. When the workman ſees that they are equally ſtretched, he orders the wheel to be turned in the ſame direction as when twining the yarns. This would twine them harder ; but the ſwivel of the loper gives way to the ſtrain, and the yarns immediately twiſt around each other, and form a lſne or cord. In doing this the yarns lofe their twiſt. This is reſtored by the wheel. But this ſimple operation would make a very bad line, which wς&gt;uld be flack, and would not hold its twiſt ; for, by the turning of the loper, the ſtrands twiſt immediately together, to a great diſtance from the loper. By this turning of the loper the yarns are untwiſted. The wheel reſtores their twiſt only to that part of the yarns that remains feparate from the others, but cannot do it in that part where they are already twined round each other, be-ςaufe their mutual preſſure prevents the twiſt from advancing. It is, therefore, neceſſary to retard this tendency to twine, by keeping the yams apart. This is done by a little tool called the top, repreſented in fig. 7.</p><p>It is a truncated cone, having three or more, notches along its ſides, and a handle called the. ſtaſſi This is put between the ſtrands, the ſmall end next the loper, and it is preſſed gently into the angle formed by the yarns which lie in the notches. The wheel being now turned, the yarns are more twiſted, or <hi rend="italic">hardened up,</hi> and their preſſure on the top gives it a ſtrong tendency to come out oſ the angle, and alſo to turn round. The workman does not allow this till he thinks the yarns ſuſſiciently hardened. Then he yields to the preſſure, and the top comes away from the ſwivel, which immediately turns round, and the line begins ta lay.— Gradually yielding to this preſſure, the workman flowly comes up towards the wheel, and the laying goes on, till the top is at laſt cloſe to the wheel, and the work is done. In the mean time, the yarns are ſhortened, both by the twining of each and the laying of the cord. The weight, therefore, gradually riſes. The uſe of this weight is evidently to oblige the yarn to take a proper degree of twiſt, and not run into kinks.</p><p>A cord or line made in this way has always ſome tendency to twiſt.a little more. However little friction there may be in the loper, there is ſome, ſo that the turns which the cord has made in the laying are not enough to balance completely the elaſticity of the yams; and the weight being appended cauſes the ſtrands to be more nearly in the direction of the axis, in the ſame manner as it would ſtretch and untwiſt a little any rope to which it is hung. On the whole, however, the twiſt</p><p>of a laid line is permanent, and not like that upon thread doubled or thrown in a mill, which remains only</p><p>in conſequence of the great ſoſtneſs and flexibility oſ the yarn.</p><p>The proceſs for laying or cloſing large cordage is conſiderably different from this. The ſtrands of which the rope is compoſed conſiſt of many yarns, and re-quire a conſiderable degree of hardening. This cannot be done by a whirl driven by a wheel-band"; it requires the power of a crank turned by the hand. The ſtrands, when properly hardened, become very ſtiff, and when bent round the top are not able to tranſmit force enough for laying the heavy and unpliant rope which forms beyond it. The elaſtic twiſt of the hardened ſtrands muſt, therefore, be aſſiſted ,by an external force. All this requires a different machinery. and a different proceſs.</p><p>- At the upper end of the walk is fixed up the <hi rend="italic">tackle, board,</hi> fig. 8. This conflits of a ſtrong oaken plank called a <hi rend="italic">breaβ board,</hi> having tlpee or more holes in it, ſuch as A, B, C, fitted with braſs or iron plates. Into theſe are put iron cranks, called heavers, which have hooks, or forelocks, and keys, on the ends of their ſpindies. They are placed at ſuch a diſtance front each other, that the workmen do not interfere with each other while turning them round. This breaſt-board is fixed to the top of ſtrong poſts well ſecured by ſtruts or braces facing the lower end of the walk. At the lower end is another breaſt-board fixed to the upright poſts of a fledge, which may be loaded with ſtones or other weights. Similar cranks are placed in the holes of this breaſt-board. The whole goes by the name of <hi rend="italic">fledge ;</hi> (ſee fig. 9.) The top neceſſary for cloſing large cordage is too heavy to be held in the hand. It therefore has a long ſtaff, which has a truck on the end. This reſts on the ground ; but even this is not enough in laying great cables. The top muſt be ſupported on a carriage, as ſhown in fig. 10. where it muſt lie. very ſteady, and netd no attendance, becauſe the matter workman has ſuſſicient employment in attending to the manner in which the ſtrands cloſe behind the top, and in helping them by various methods. The top is, therefore, fixed to the carriage by laſhing its ſtaff to the two upright poſts. A piece of ſoft rope, or ſtrap, is attached to the handle of the top by the middle, and its two ends are brought back and wrapped ſeveral times tight round the rope, in the direction of its twiſt, and bound down. This is ſhown at W, and it greatly aſ-ſiſts the laying of the rope by its friction. This both keeps the top from flying too far from the point of union of the ſtrands, and brings the ſtrands more regularly into their places.</p><p>The firſt operation is <hi rend="italic">warping</hi> the yarns. At each end of the walk are frames called warping frames, which carry a great number of reels or winches filled with rope-yarn. The foreman of the walk takes off a yarn end from each, till he has made up the number neceſſary for his rope or ſtrand, and bringing the ends together, he paſſes the whole through an iron ring fixed to the top of a flake driven into the ground, and draws them through : then a knot is tied on the end of the bundle, and a workman pulls it through this ring till &gt; the intended length is drawn off the reels. The end is made faſt at the bottom of the walk, or at the fledge, and the foreman comes back along the ſkain of yarns, , to ſee that none are hanging flacker than the reſt. Ha</p>
<pb xml:id="eb03-16-r03-0486" facs="gri_33125011196389_0492.tif"/>
<p>takes up in his hand ſuch as are flack,- and draws them tight, keeping them ſo till he reaches the upper end, where he cuts the yarns to a length, again adjuſts their tightneſs, and joins them all .together in a knot, to which he fixes the hook of a tackle, the other block of which is fixed to a firm poft, called the <hi rend="italic">vυarping-ρofl.</hi> The ſkain is well ſtretched by this tackle, and then ſeparated into its different ſtrands. Each of theſe is knotted a-part at both ends. The knots at their upper ends are made faſt to the hooks of the cranks in the tackle-board, and thoſe at their lower ends are faſtened to the cranks in the fledge. The fledge itſelf is kept in its place by a tackle, by which the ſtrands are again ſtretched in their places, and every thing adjuſted, ſo that the fledge ſtands ſquare on the walk, and then a proper weight is laid on it. The tackle is now cut off, and the cranks are turned at both ends, in the contrary direction to the twiſt of the yarns. (In feme kinds of cordage the cranks are turned the ſame way with the ſpinning twiſt). By this the ſtrands are twiſted and hardened up ; and as they contract by this operation, the fledge is dragged up the walk. When the foreman thinks the ſtrands ſuſſiciently hardened, which he eſtimates by the motion of the fledge, he orders the heavers at the cranks to ſtop. The middle ſtrand at the ſledge is taken off from the crank. This crank is taken out, and a ſtronger one put in its place at D, fig. 9. The other ſtrands are taken off from their cranks, and all are joined on the hook which is now in the middle hole. The top is then placed between the ſtrands, and, being preſe-ed home to the point of their union, the car riage is placed under it, and it is firmly fixed down. Some weight is taken off the ſledge. The heavers now begin to turn at both ends. Thoſe at the tackle-board continue to turn as they did before ; but the heavers at the fledge turn in the oppoſite direction to their former motion, ſo that the cranks at both ends are now turning one way. By the motion of the ſledge crank the top is forced away from the knot, and the rope begins to cloſe. The heaving at the upper end reltores to the ſtrand the twiſt which they are conſtantly loling by the laying of the rope. '1 he workmen judge of this by making a chalk mark on intermediate points of the ſtrands, where they lie on the ſtakes which are let up along the walk for their ſupport. If the twfiſt of the ſtrands is diminiſhed by the motion of doling, they will ling then, and the chalk mark will move away from the tackle board : but if the twiſt increaſes by turning the crank-s at the tackle-board, the ſtrands will ſhorten, and the mark will come nearer to it.</p><p>As the doling of the rope advances, the whole ſhortens, and the ſledge is dragged up the walk. The top moves faſter, and at· laſt reaches the upper end of the walk, the rope being now laid. In the mean time, the fledge has moved ſeveral fathoms from the place where it was when the laying began.</p><p>Theſe motιor13 of the ſledge and top muſt be exactly adjuſted to each other. The rope muſt be of a certain length. Therefore the ſledge muſt ſtop at a certain place. At that moment the rope ſhould be laid ; that is, the top ſhould be at the tackle board. In this conſiſts the addrcſs of the foreman. He has his attention directed both ways. He looks at the ſtrands, and when he ſecs any oſ them hanging flacker betw <hi rend="sup">,</hi> een the flakes than the others, he calls to the heavers at the tackle· board to heave more upon that ſtrand. He finds it more difficult to regulate the motion of the top. It requires a conſiderable force to keep it in the angle oſ the ſtrands, and it is always diſpoſed to ſtart forward. Tc&gt; prevent or check this, ſome ſtraps of ſoſt rope are brought round the ſtaff of the top, and then wrapped ſeveral times round the rope behind the top, and kept firmly down by a lanyard or bandage, as is ſhown in the figure. This both holds back the top and greatly aſſiſts the laying of the rope, cauling the ſtrands to fall into their places, and keep cloſe to each other. This is ſometimes very difficult, eſpecially in ropes compoſed of more than three ſtrands. It will greatly improve the laying the rope, if the top have a ſharp, ſmooth, tapſering pin of hard wood, pointed at the end, projecting ſo far from the middle of its ſmaller end, that it gets in between the ſtrands which are cloſing. This ſupports them, and makes their cloſing more gradual and regular. The top, its notches, the pin, and the warp or ſtrap, which is lapped round the rope, are all ſmeared wſith greaſe or ſoap to aſſiſt the cloſing. The foreman judges of the progreſs of cloſing chiefly by his acquaintance with the w∙alk, knowing that when the fledge is abreaſt of a certain ſtake the top ſhould be a-breaſt of a certain other 'lake. When he finds the top too far down the walk, he flackens the motion at the tackle board, and makes the men turn briſkly at the fledge. By this the top is forced up the walk, and the laying of the rope accelerates, while the fledge remains in the lame place, becauſe the ſtrands are loſing their twill, and are lengthening, while the cloſed rope is ſhortening. When, on the other hand, he thinks the top too far advanced, and fears that it will be at the head oſ the walk before the fledge has got to its proper place, he makes the men heave briſkly on the ſtrands, and the heavers at the fledge crank to work ſoftly.—-This quickens the motion of the .ſledge by ſhortening the ſtrands ; and by thus compenſating what has been overdone, the ſledge and top come to their places at once, and the work appears to anſwer the intention.</p><p>But this is a bad manner of proceeding, lt is evident, that if the I! rands be kept to one degree of hard-neſs throughout, and the heaving at the fledge be uniformly continued, the rope will be uniform. It may be a little longer or ſhorter than was intended, and the laying may be too hard in proportion to the twiſt of the ſtrands, in which caſe it will not keep it ; or it may be too flack, and the rope will tend to twi more. Either oſ theſe faults are diſcoverable by flackening the rope before it come off the hooks, and it may then be corrected. But if the error in one place be compenſated by that in another, this will not be eaſily ſeen before taking off the hooks ; and if it is a large and Iliff rope, it will hardly ever come to an equable ſtate in its different parts, but wall be apt to run into loops during ſervice.</p><p>It is, therefore,-of importance to preſerve the uniformity throughout the w hole. Mr Du Hamel, in his great work on rope-making, propoſes a method which is very exact, but requires an apparatus which is cumbersome, and which would be much in the way of the workmen. We .think that the following method would be extremely eaſy, embarraſs no one, and is perfectly exact. Having determined the proportion between the velocity of the top and fledge, let the diameter of the</p>
<pb xml:id="eb03-16-r03-0487" facs="gri_33125011196389_0493.tif"/>
<p>truck of the top carriage be to tuat of another truck fixed to the ſledge, in the proportion of the velocity of the top to that of the ſledge. Let a mark be made on the rim of each ; let the man at the ſledge make a ſignal every time that the mark on the ſledge truck is up-permoft. The mark on the carriage truck ſhould be uppermoſt at the ſame inſtant ; and in this way the foreman knows the ſtate of the rope at all times without quitting his llation. Thus, in making a cable of 120 fathoms, it is ufiιal to warp the yarns l8o fathoms, and to harden them up to 140 before doling. Therefore, in the cloſing, the top muſt move 140 fathoms, and the ſledge only 20. The diameter of the carriage truck ſhould therefore be ſeven times the diameter or the ſledge truck.</p><p>We have hitherto proceeded on the ſuppofition, that the twiſt produced by the cranks is propagated freely along the ſtrands and along the cloſing rope. But this is not the cafe.. It is almoſt unavoidable that the twiſt is greater in the neighbourhood of the crank which produces it. The ſtrands are frequently of very conſiderable weight, and lie heavy on the flakes. Force is therefore neceſſary to overcome their friction, and it is only the overplus that is propagated beyond the ſtake. It is proper to lift them up from time to time, and let them fall down again, as the ſawer does with his marking line. This helps the twiſt to run along the ſtrand. But this is not enough for the cloſed rope, which is of much greater weight, and much ſtiſſer.— When the top approaches the tackle-board, the heaving at the Hedge could not can e the ſtrands immediately behind the top to dole well, without *having previouſly produced an extravagant degree of twiſt in the intermediate rope. The effort of the crank muſt therefore be aſſiſted by men ſtationed along the rope, each ſur-niihed -with a tool, called a <hi rend="italic">vaoolcter.</hi> This is a ſtout oak flick about three feet long, having a ſtrap of ſoft rope-yarn or cordage fattened on its middle or end. The 'ſtrap is wrapped round the laid rope, and the workman works with the ſtick as a lever, twilling the rope round in the direction of the crank’s motion. The woolders ſhould keep their eye on the men at the crank, and make their motion correſpond with his. Thus they ſend forward the twiſt produced by the crank, without either increaſing or diminiſhing. it, in that part cf the rope which lies between them and the Hedge.</p><p>It is uſual before taking the rope ſtom the hooks to heave a while at the ſledge end, in order to harden the <hi rend="sup">,</hi> rope a little. They do this ſo as to take it up about ∙ <hi rend="sub">δ</hi> <hi rend="sup">l</hi> <hi rend="sub">δ</hi> -. The propriety or Impropriety of this practice de-peπdsbentirely on the proportion which has been previouſly obſerved between tiιe hardening of the ſtrands and the twiſting of the cloſing rope. It is, in all cafes, better to adjuſt theſe preciſely, and then nothing remains to be done when the top has arrived at the upper end of the walk. The making of two ſtrand and three ſtrand line pointed out the principle which ſhould be attended to in this,caſe ; namely, that the twiſt given to the rope in laying ſhould be preciſely what a perfectly ſoſt rope would give to itſelf. We do not fee any reaſon for thinking that the proportion between the number of turns given to the ſtrands and the number of turns given to the laid line by its own elaſticity, will vary by any difference of diameter. We would therefore recommend to the artiſts to fettle this proportion by experiment. lhe line ſhould be made of tne ſineſt, ſmalleſt, and ſofteft threads or yarn. Theſe ſhould be made into ſtrands, and the ſtrands ſhould be hardened up in the direction ’contrary to the ſpinning twiſt. The rope ſhould then be laid, hanging perpendicularly, with a ſmall weight on the top to keep it down, and a very ſmall weight at the end of the rope. The number of turns given to the ſtrands ſhould be carefully noticed', and the number of turns which the rope takes of itſelf in cloſing. T <hi rend="sup">1</hi> ne weight ſhould then be taken off, and the rope will make a dew turns more. This whole number will never exceed what is neceſſary for the equilibrium ; and we imagine it will not fall much ſhort of it. We are clearly of opinion an exact ad-juſtment of this particular will tend greatly to improve the art of rope-making, and that experiments on good' principles for aſcertaimng this proportion would be highly valuable, becauſe there is no point about which the artiſts themſelves differ more in their opinions'and practice.</p><p>The cordage, of which we have been describing the manufacture, is ſaid to be hawser-laid. It is not uncommon to make ropes of four llra'nd6. Theſe are uſed for lhrouds, and this cordage is therefore called shroud-laid cordage. A rope of the lame fize and weight mnſt be ſmoother when it has four ſtrands, be-caute the ſtrands are ſmaller : hut it is more difficult to lay cloſe. When three cylindrical ſtrands are limply laid together, they leave a vaciiity at the axis amounting to √- <hi rend="sub">g</hi> - of the ſection of a ſtrand. This is to be filled up by compreſſing the ſtrands by twiſting them. Each muſt fill up ſ of it by changing its ſhape ; and 4 of this change is made on each fide of the ſtrand. The greateſt change of ſhape therefore made on any one part of a ſtrand amounts only to <hi rend="sub">τ</hi> ⅛- <hi rend="sub">5</hi> ∙ of the ſection of the ſtrand. The vacuity between four cylinders is √ <hi rend="sub">τ</hi> of one of them. This being divided into eight parts, is √ <hi rend="sub">5</hi> - of a ilrand, and is the greateſt compreſſion which any part of it has to undergo. This is nearly five times greater than the former, and muſt be more difficult to produce. Indeed it may be ſeen by looking at the figures 11. and 12. that it will be eafier to compreſs a ſtrand into the obtuſe angle of .120 degrees than into the right angle of 90 ; and without reaſoning more about the matter, it appears that the difficulty will increaſe w <hi rend="sup">τ</hi> ith the number of ſtrands. Sixdlrands muſt touch each other, and form an arch leaving a hollow in the middle, into which one of the ſtrands will flip, and then the reſt will not completely furround it. Such a rope would be uneven on the ſurface. It would be weak ; becauſe the central ſtrand would be ſlack in compariſon of the reſt, and would not be exerting its whole force when they are juſt ready to break. We fee then that a four ſtrand rope muſt be more difficult to lay well than a hawſer-laid rope. With care, however, they may be laid well and cloſe, and are much uſed in the royal navy.</p><p>Ropes, aie made of four ſtrands, with a heart or ſtrand in the middle. This gives no additional ſtrength,: for the reaſon juſt now given. Its only uſe is to make’ the work better and more eaſy, and to ſupport all the ſtrands at the ſame diſtance from the axis of the rope. This is of great conſequence ; becauſe when they are at unequal diſtances from the axis, ſome muſt be more doping than.others, and they will not reſiſt alike. This</p>
<pb xml:id="eb03-16-r03-0488" facs="gri_33125011196389_0494.tif"/>
<p>heart is made of inferior fluff, flack laid,· and of a ſize juſt equal to the ſpace it is to fill. When a rope of ' this fabric has been long uſed and become unſerviceable, and is opened out, the heart is always found cut and chaffed to pieces, like very ſhort oakum. This happens as follows ; When the rope is violently ſtrained, it ſtretches greatly .; becauſe the ſtrands ſui round the axis obliquely, and the ſtrain draws them into a poſition more parallel to the axis. But the heart has not the obliquity of parts, and cannot ſtretch ſo much ; at the ſame time, its yarns are firmly graſped by the hard ſtrands which ſurround them ; they muſt therefore be rtorn into ſhort pieces.</p><p>The proceſs for laying a rope with a heart is not veιy different from that already deſcribed. The top has a hole pierçed through it, in the direction of the axis. The ſkain or ſtrand intended for the heart paſſes through this hole, and is ſtretched along the walk. A boy attends it, holding it tight as it is taken into the cloſing rope. But a little attention to what has been ſaid will ſhow this method to be defective. The wick will have no more turns than the laid rope ; and as it lies in the very axis, its yarns will be much ſtraighter than the ſtrands. Therefore when the rope is ſtrained and ſtretched, the wick cannot ctretch as much as the laid ſtrands ; and being firmly graſped by them, it muſt break into ſhort pieces, and the ſtrands, having loſt their ſupport in thoſe places, will fink in, and the cordage grow looſe. We ſhould endeavour to enable all to ſtretch alike. The wick therefore ſhould fee twiſted in the ſame manner as the ſtrands, perhaps even a little more. It will thus communicate part of its ſtrength to the rope. Indeed it will not be ſo uniformly ſolid, and may chance to have three ſpiral vacuities. But that this does no harm, is quite evident from the ſuperior ſtrength of cable-laid cordage, to be deſcribed preſently, which have the ſame vacuities. In this way are the main and fore ſtays made for ſhips of the line. They are thought ſtronger than hawſer-laid ropes, but unfit for running rigging; becauſe their ſtrands are apt to get out of their places when the rope is drawn into loops. Tt is alſo thought that the heart retains water, rots, and communicates its putrefaction to the ſurrounding ſtrands.</p><p>■ Such is the general and eſſential proceſs of rope-making. The fibres of hemp are twiſted into yarns, that they may make a line of any length, and ſtick among each other with a force equal to their own coheſion. Thfe yarns are made into cords of permanent twiſt by laying them ; and, that we may have a rope of any degree of ſtrength, many yarns are united in one ſtrand, for the ſame reaſon that many fibres were united in one yarn ; and in the courſe of this proceſs it is in our power to give the rope a ſolidity and hardneſs which makes it leſs penetrable by water, which would rot it in a ſhor while.. Somç of theſe purpoſes are inconſiſtent with others : and the ſkill of a rope-maker lies in making the beſt compenſation ; ſo that the rope may on the whole be the beſt in point of ſtrength, pliancy, and duration, that the quantity of hemp in it can produce.</p><p>There is another ſpecies of cordage in very general uſe. A rope o <hi rend="sup">i</hi> two or more ſtrands may be uſed as a ſtr?nd, in order to compoſe a ſtill larger rope ; and in this manner are cables and other ground tackle com</p><p>monly made ; for this reaſon ſuch cordage is called cable-laid cordage.</p><p>The proceſs of cable-laying hardly differs from that oſ hawſer-laying. Three ropes, in their ſtate of permanent twiſt, may be twiſted together ; but they will not hold it, like fine thread, becauſe they are ſtiff and elaiſic. They muſt therefore be treated like ſtrands for a hawſer. We muſt give them an <hi rend="italic">additional</hi> twfiſt, which will diſpoſe them to lay or cloſe tllemſeives ; and this diſpoſition muſt be aided by the workmen at the ſledge. We ſay the twiſt ſhould be an addition to their twiſt as a rope. A twiſt in the oppoſite direction will indeed give them a diſpoſition to cloſe behind the top ; but this will be very ſmall, and the ropes (now ſtrands) will be exceedingly open, and will become more open in laying. The twiſt is therefore given in the direction of their twiſt as a rope, or oppoſite to that of the ριimary ſtrands, of which the ropes are compoſed. Theſe primary ſtrands are therefore partly untwiſted in cable-laying a rope, in the ſame manner as the yarns are untwiſted in the uſual proceſs of rope-making.</p><p>We need not infill farther on this part-of the manufacture. The reader muſt be ſenſible that the hawſers intended for ſtrands of a cable muſt not be ſo much twiſted as thoſe intended to remain hawſers ; for the twiſt given to a ſiniſhed hawſer is preſumed to be that which renders it moſt perfect, and it muſt be injured by any addition. The preciſe proportion, and the diftri-butionof the working up between the hardening of the ſtrands and cloſing the cable, is a ſubject about which the artiſts are no better agreed than in the caſe of haw-ſer-laid cordage. We did not enter on this ſubject while deſcribing the proceſs, -becauſe the introduction of reaſonings and principles would have hurt the ſim-plicity of the defcription.∙ The reader being now acquainted with the different parts of the manipulation, and knowing what can be done on any occaſion, will now be able to judge of the propriety oſ the whole, when he learns the principle on which the ſtrength of a rope depends.</p><p>We have already ſaid, that a rope-yarn ſhould be twiſted till a fibre will break rather than be pulled out from among the reſt, and that all twiſting beyond this is injurious to the ſtrength of the yarn : And we advanced this maxim upon this plain coniideration, that it is need-leſs to bind them cloſer together, for they will already break rather than come out ; and becauſe this cloſer binding is produced only by forcibly wrapping the outer fibres round the inner, and drawing the outer ones tight. Thus theſe fibres are on the ſtretch, and are ſtrained as if a weight were hung on each of them. The proceſs of laying lines, of a permanent twiſt, ſhows that we muſt do a little more. We muſt give the yarn a degree of elaſtic contractility, which will make it lay itſelf and form a line or cord which will retain its twiſt. This muſt leave the fibres of the yarns in a ſtate of greater compreſſion than iβ neceſſary for juſt keeping them together. But more than this ſeems to be need-leſs and hurtful. The ſame maxim muſt direct us in forming a rope conſiſting of ſtrands, containing more than one yarn. A needleſs exceſs of twiſt leaves them ſtrained, and leſs able to perform their office in the rope.</p><p>It not unſrequently happens, that the workman, in order to make his rope ſolid and. firm, hardens up</p>
<pb xml:id="eb03-16-r03-0489" facs="gri_33125011196389_0495.tif"/>
<p>the ſtrands till they really break : and we believe that, in the general practice of making large hawſers, many of the outer yarns in the ſtrands, eſpecially thoſe which chance to be outermoſt in the laid rope, and are therefore moſt ſtrained, are broken during the operation.</p><p>But there is another conſideration which ſhould alſo make us give no greater twiſt in any part of the operation than is abſolutely neceſſary for the firm coheſion of the parts, and this independent of the ſtrain to which the fibres or yarns are ſubjected. Twiſting cauſes all the fibres to lie obliquely with reſpect to the axis or general direction of the rope. It may juſt happen that one fibre or one yarn ſhall keep in the axis, and remain ſtraight ; all the reſt muſt be oblique, and the more oblique as they are farther from the axis, and as they are more twiſted. Now it is to be demonſtrated, that when any ſtrain is given to the rope in the direction of its length, a ſtrain greater than this is actually excited on the oblique fibres, and ſo much the greater as they are more oblique ; and thus the fibres which are already the weakeſt are expoſed to the greateſt ſtrains.</p><p>Let CF (fig. 13.) repreſent a fibre hanging from a hook, and loaded with a weight F, which it is juſt able to bear, but not more. This weight may repreſent the abſolute force of the fibre. Let ſuch another fibre be laid over the two pulleys A, B (ſig. 14.), which are in a horizontal line AB, and let weights F and <hi rend="italic">ſ,</hi> equal to the former, be hung on the ends of this fibre, while another weight R, leſs than the ſum of F and ∕, is hung on the middle point C by a hook or thread. This weight wfill draw dowm the fibre into ſuch a poſition ACB, that the three w <hi rend="sup">τ</hi> eights F, R, andj <hi rend="sup">f</hi> , are in equilibrio by the intervention of the fibre. We affirm that this weight R is the meaſure of the relative ſtrength of the fibre in relation to the form ACB ; for the fibre is equally ſtretched in all its parts, and therefore in every part it is ſtrained by the force F. If therefore the weights F and <hi rend="italic">f</hi> are held faſt, and any addition is made to the weight R, the fibre muſt break, being already ſtrained to its full ſtrength; therefore R meaſures its ſtrength in relation to its ſituation. Complete the parallelogram ACBD, and draw the diagonal CD ; becauſe AB is horizontal, and AC=BC, DC is vertical, and coincides with the direction CR, by which the weight R acts. The point C is drawn by three forces, wfiιich are in equilibrio. They are therefore proportional to the ſides of a triangle, which have the ſame directions ; or, the force acting in the direction CA is to that acting in the direction CR as CA to CD. The point R is ſupported by the two forces CA, CB, which are equivalent to CD ; and therefore the weight F is to the weight R as CA is to CD. Therefore the abſolute ſtrengths of the two fibres AC, BC, taken ſeparately, are greater than their united ſtrengths in relation to their poſition wfitlι reſpect to CR : and ſince this proportion remains the ſame, whatever equal weights are hung on at F and <hi rend="italic">ſ,</hi> it follows, that when any ſtrain DC is made to act on this ſibre in the direction DC, it excites a greater ſtrain on the fibre, becauſe CA and •CB taken together are greater than CD. Each fibre ffuſtains a ſtrain greater than the half of CD.</p><p>Now let the weight R be turned round the axis CR. This will cauſe the two parts of the fibre ACB to lap round each other, and compoſe aTwiſted line or cord</p><p>CR, as in fig. 15. and the parallelogram ACBD will remain of the ſame form, by the yielding of the weights F and <hi rend="italic">ſ,</hi> as is evident from the equilibrium of forces. The fibre wfill always aſſume that form which makes the ſides and diagonal in the proportion of the weights. While the fibres lap round each other, they are ſtrained to the ſame degree, that is, to the full extent of their ſtrength, and they remain in this degree of ſtrain in every part of the line or cord CR. If therefore each of the fibres lias the ſtrength AB, the cord has the ſtrength DC ; and if F and <hi rend="italic">ſ</hi> be held faſt, the ſmalleſt addition to R will break the cord. The ſum of the abſolute ſtrength of the two fibres of which this thread is compoſed is to the ſum of their relative ſtrengths, or to the ſtrength of the thread, as AC-{-CB is to CD, or as AC is to EC.</p><p>If the weights F and <hi rend="italic">ſ</hi> are not held faſt, but allowed to yield, a heavier weight <hi rend="italic">r</hi> may be hung on at C with-out breaking the fibre ; ſor it will draw it into another poſition A <hi rend="italic">c</hi> B, ſuch that <hi rend="italic">r</hi> ſhall be in equilibrio wfith F and <hi rend="italic">ſ.</hi> Since F and <hi rend="italic">ſ</hi> remain the ſame, the fibre is as much ſtrained as before. Therefore make <hi rend="italic">c a, cb</hi> equal to C A and' CB, and complete the parallelogram <hi rend="italic">a c b d. cd</hi> wfill now be the meaſure of the weight r, becauſe it is the equivalent of <hi rend="italic">c a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">cb.</hi> It is evident that <hi rend="italic">cd</hi> is greater than CD, and therefore the thread formed by the lapping of the ſibre in the poſition <hi rend="italic">a c b</hi> is ſtronger than the former, in the proportion of <hi rend="italic">c d</hi> to CD, or <hi rend="italic">c e</hi> to CE. The cord is therefore ſo much ſtronger as the fibres are more parallel to the axis, and it muſt be ſtrongeſt of all when they are quite parallel. Bring the pulleys A, B cloſe to each other. It is plain that if we hang on a weight R leſs than the ſum of F and <hi rend="italic">f,</hi> it cannot take down the bight of the fibre; but if equal to them, although it cannot pull it down, it will keep it dow <hi rend="sup">r</hi> n. In this caſe, wfiιen the fibres are parallel to each other, the ſtrength of the cord (improperly ſo called) is equal to the united abſolute ſtrengths of the fibres.</p><p>It is eaſy to ſee that the length of each of the fibres which compoſe any part CR of this cord is to the length of the part of the cord as AC to EC ; and this is the caſe even although they ſhould lap round a cylinder of any diameter. This will appear very clearly to anyperfon who conſiders the thing with attention. Let <hi rend="italic">a c</hi> (ſig. 16.) be an indefinitely ſmall portion of the fibre which is lapped obliquely round the cylinder, and let HKG be a ſection perpendicular to the axis. Draw <hi rend="italic">a e</hi> parallel to the axis, and draw <hi rend="italic">e c</hi> to the centre of the circle HKG, and <hi rend="italic">a e'</hi> parallel to <hi rend="italic">ec.</hi> It is plain that <hi rend="italic">e'e</hi> is the length of the axis correſponding to the ſmall portion <hi rend="italic">n c,</hi> and that <hi rend="italic">e'e</hi> is equal to <hi rend="italic">a ς.</hi></p><p>Hence we derive another manner of expreſſing the ratio of the abſolute and relative ſtrength; and we may ſay that the abſolute ſtrength of a fibre, wfiιich has the ſame obliquity throughout, is to its relative ſtrength as the length of the ſibre to the length of the cord of which it makes a part. And we may ſay, that the ſtrength of a rope is to the united abſolute ſtrength ρf its yarns as the length, <hi rend="italic">oi</hi> the cord to the length of the yarns ; for although the yarns are in various ſtates of obliquity, they contribute to the ſtrength of the cord in as much as they contribute immediately to the ſtrength oſ the ſtrands. The ſtrength of the yarns is to that of the ſtrands as the length of the yarns to that of the</p>
<pb xml:id="eb03-16-r03-0490" facs="gri_33125011196389_0496.tif"/>
<p>ſtrands, and the ſtrength of the ſtrands is to that of the rope as the length of the firſt to that of the laſt.</p><p>And thus we ſee that twiſting the fibres diminiſhes the ſtrength of the aſſemblage ; becauſe their obliquity, which is its neceſſary conſequence, enables any external force to excite a greater ſtrain on the fibres than it could have excited had they remained parallel ; and finee a greater degree of twiſting neceſſarily produces a greater obliquity, of the fibres, it muſt more remarkably diminiſh the ſtrength of the cord. Moreover, ſince the greater obliquity cannot be produced without a greater ſtrain in the operation of twiſting, it follows, that immoderate twiſting is doubly prejudicial to the ſtrength of cordage.</p><p>Theſe theoretical deductions are abundantly confirmed by experiment ; and as many perſons give their aſ-ſent more readily to a general propofιtion when preſent-ed as an induction from unexceptionable particulars, than when offered as the conſequence of uncontroverted principles, we ſhall mention ſome of the experiments which have been made on this ſubject. Mr Reaumur, one of the moſt zealous, and at the ſame time judicious, obſervers of nature made the following experiments. <hi rend="italic">(Mem. Acad. Pans,</hi> τ 7 I I. )</p><p>1. A thread, conſiſting of 832 fibres of filk, each of which carried at a medium 1 dram and 18 grains, would hardly ſupport y⅛ pounds, and ſometimes broke with 5 pounds. The film of the abſolute ſtrengths of the fibres is 1040 drams, or upwards of 8 pounds 2 ounces.</p><p>2. A ſkain of white thread was examined in many places. Every part of it bore q&lt; pounds, but none of it would bear 10. When twiſted ſlack into a cord of 2 yarns it broke with 16 pounds.</p><p>3. Three threads were twiſted together. Their mean ſtrength was very nearly 8 pounds. It broke with 17⅜, whereas it ſhould have carried 24.</p><p>4. Four threads were twiſted. Their mean ſtrength was 7I. Tt broke with 21 ſ inſtead of 30. Four threads, whoſe ſtrength was nearly 9 pounds, broke with 22 inſtead of 36.</p><p>5. A ſmall and very well made hempen cord broke in different places with’58, 63, 67, 72 pounds. Another part of it was untwiſted into its three ſtrands. One of them bore 29⅜, another 33⅜, and the third 35; therefore the ſum of their abſolute ſtrengths was 98. In another part which broke with 72, the ſtrands which had already borne this ſtrain were ſeparated. They bore 26, 28, and 30; the ſum of which is 84.</p><p>The late admiral Sir Charles Knowles made many experiments on cordage of fize. A piece of rope .3J inches in circumference was cut into many portions. Each of theſe had a fathom cut off, and it was carefully opened out. It was white, or untarred, and containd 72 yarns. They were each tried ſeparately, and their mean ſtrength was 90 pounds. Each correſponding piece of rope was tried apart, and the mean ſtrength of the nine pieces was 4552 pounds. But 90 times 72 is 6480.</p><p>Nothing is more familiarly known to a ſeaman than the ſuperior ſtrength of rope-yarns made up into a ſkain without twiſting. They call ſuch a piece of rope a Salvage. It is uſed on board the king’s ſhips for rolling tackles, flinging the great guns, butt-flings, nippers for holding the viol on the cable, and in every</p><p>ſervice where the utmoſt ſtrength and great pliancy are wanted.</p><p>It is therefore fufficiently eſtabliſhed, both by theory and obſervation, that the twiſting of cordage diminiſhes its ſtrength. Experiments cannot be made with ſuſſi-cient precifion for determining whether this diminution is in the very proportion, relative to the obliquity of the fibres, which theory points out. In a hawſer the yarns lie in a great variety of angles with the axis. The very outermoſt yarn of a ſtrand is not much inclined to the axis of the rope : for the inclination of this yarn to the axis of its own ſtrand nearly compenſates for the inclination of the ſtrand. But then the oppoſite yarn of the ſame ſtrand, the yarn that is next the axis of the rope lies with an obliquity, which is the ſum of the obliquities of the ſtrand and of the yarn. So that all the yarns which are really in the axis of the rope are exceedingly oblique, and, in general, the infide of the rope has its yarns more oblique than the outlide. But in a laid rope we ſhould not conſider the ſtrength as made up of the ſtrengths of the yarns ; it is made up of the ſtrengths of the ſtrands : For when the rope is violently ſtretched, it untwiſts as a rope, and the ſtrands are a little more twiſted ; fo that they are refiſting as ſtrands, and not as yarns. Indeed, when we conſider the proceſs of laying the rope, we ſee that it muſt be ſo. We know, from what has been already ſaid, that the three ſtrands would carry more when parallel than when twiſted into a rope, although the yarns would then be much more oblique to the axis. The chief attention therefore ſhould be turned to the making the moſt perfect ſtrands.</p><p>We are fully authoriſed to ſay that the twiſt given to cordage ſhould be as moderate as poſſible. We are certain that it diminiſhes the ſtrength, and that the appearance of ſtrength which its ſuperior ſmoothneſs and hardneſs gives is ſallaeious. But a certain degree of this is neceſſary for its duration. If the rope is laid too ſlack, its parts are apt to open when it happens to be catched in ſhort loops at its going into a pulley, &amp;c. in which caſe ſome of the ſtrands or yarns are apt to kink and break. It alſo becomes too pervious to water, which ſoaks and rots it. To prevent theſe and other ſuch inconveniences, a conſiderable degree of ſirmneſs or hardneſs is neceſſary ; and in order to give the cordage this appearance of ſuperior ſtrength, the manufacturer is diſpoſed to exceed.</p><p>Mr Du Hamel made many experiments in the royal dock-yards in France, with a view to aſcertain λvhat is the beſt degree of twiſt. It is uſual to work up the yams to -∣∙ of their length. Mr Du Hamel thought this too much, and procured ſome to be worked up only to ⅜ of the length of the yarns. The ſtrength of the firſt, by a mean of three experiments, was 4321, and that of the laſt was 5187.</p><p>He cauſed three ropes to be made from the ſame hemp, ſpun with all poſſible equability, and in ſuch proportion of yarn that a fathom of each was of the ſame weight. The rope which was worked up to γ bore 4098 pounds ; that which was worked up to J bore 4850; and the one worked up to <hi rend="italic">y</hi> bore 6205. In another trial the ſtrengths were 425 <hi rend="sup">t</hi> 0, 6753, and 7397. Theſe ropes were of different ſizes.</p><p>He had influence enough, in conſequence of theſe experiments, to get a conſiderable quantity of rigging</p>
<pb xml:id="eb03-16-r03-0492" facs="gri_33125011196389_0498.tif"/>
<p>the yarns muſt be exerting twice this force. Now let the ſame yarn, ſpun up to one-half, be made up in a ſtrand, and let the ſtrand be twiſted in the oppoſite direction to the ſpinning till it has acquired the ſatne elaſtſeſty fit for laying. The yarns are untwiſted. Sup-ρofe to three-fourths of the length oſ the fibres. They are now exerting only four-thirds of the force neceſlary for laying, that is, two-thirds of what they were obliged to exert in the other caſe; and thus we have ſtronger yarns when the ſtrands are equally ſtrained. But they require to be more ſtrained than the other ; which, being made of more twi 'ed yarn, ſoon,er acquire the elaſticity’' fit for laying. But ſince the elaſticſty which fits the ſtrand ſor laying does not increaſe ſo faſt as the ſtrain on the fibres of the yarn which produces it, it is plain, that when each has acquired that elaſticity which is proper for laying, the ſtrands made of the flack-twiſted yarn are the ſtrongeſt ; and the yarns are alſo the ſtrongeſt ; and being ſoſter, the rope will cloſe better.</p><p>Experience confirms all this ; and cordage, whoſe ſtrands are twiſted in the oppoſite direction to the twiſt of ſpinning, are found to be ſtronger than the others in a proportion not leſs than that of 7 to 6.</p><p>Such being the difficulty of making a large ſtrand, and its deſects when made, w <hi rend="sup">,</hi> e have fallen on a method of making great cordage by laying it tw’ſee. A haw-ſer-laid rope, flack ſpun, little hardened in the ſtrands, and flack laid, is made a ſtrand of a large rope called a <hi rend="italic">cable</hi> or <hi rend="italic">cablet.</hi> The advantages of this fabric are evident. The ſtrands are reduced to one-third or one-fourth of the diameter which they would have in a hawffer of the ſame ſize. Such ſtrands cannot have their yarns lying very obliquely, and the outer yarns cannot be much more ſtrained than the inner ones. There muſt therefore be a much greater equality in the whole ſubſtance of cable-laid cordage, and ſrom this we ſhould expect ſuperior ſtrength.</p><p>Accordingly, their ſuperiority is great, not leſs than in the proportion of 13 to 9, which is not far from the proportion of 4 to 3. A cable is more than a fourth part, but is not a third part, ſtronger than a hawſer of the ſame ſize or weight.</p><p>They are ſeldom made of more than three hawſers of three ſtrands each, though they are ſometimes made of three four-ſtranded hawſers, or of four three-ſtrand-ed. The ſirſt of theſe two is preferred, becauſe four ſmall ſtrands can be laid very cloſe ; whereas it is difficult to lay well four hawſers, already become very hard.</p><p>The ſuperiority of a cable-laid cordage being attributed entirely to the greater perfection of the ſtrands, and this ſeeming to ariſe entirely from their ſmallneſs, it was natural to expect ſtill better cordage by laying cables as the ſtrands of ſtill larger pieces. It has been tried, and wfith every requifite attention. But although they have always equalled, they have not decidedly excelled, common cables of the ſame weight ; and they require a great deal more work. We ſhall not therefore enter upon the manipulations of this fa- . bric.</p><p>There is only one point of the mechanical proceſs of rope-making which we have not conſidered minutely ; and it is an important one, viz. the diſtribution of the</p><p>total ſhortening of the yarns between the hardening of the ſtrands and the laying the rope. This is a point about which the artiſts are by no means agreed. There is certainly a poſition of the ſtrands of a laid rope which puts every part in equilibrio ; and this is what an elaſtic, but perfectly ſoſt rope (were ſuch a thing poſſible), would aſſume. But this cannot be diſcovered by any experiments made on large or even on firm cordage ; and it may not be thought ſuſſiciently clear that the pro-∣ portion which would be diſcovered by the careful fabri- <hi rend="sup">1</hi> cation of a very ſmall and ſoſt line is the ſame that’ wfill fuit a cordage of any diameter. We muſt proceed <hi rend="sub">j</hi> much on conjecture ; and w;e cannot ſay that the arguments uſed by the partiſans of different proportions are very convincing.</p><p>The general practice, we believe, is to divide the whole of the intended ſhortening of the yarns, or the w'orking up into three parts, and to employ two of theſe in hardening the ſtrands, and the remaining third in cloſing the haw-ſer.</p><p>Mr Du Hamel thinks, that this repartition is injudicious, and that the yarns are too much ſtrained, and the ſtrands rendered weak. He recommends to invert this proportion, and to ſhorten one-third in the hardening of the ſtrands, and two-thirds in laying the hawſer. But if the ſtrain of the yarns only is conſidered, one ſhould think that the outſide yarn of a ſtrand will be more ſtrained in laying, in proportion to the yarn of the ſame ſtrand, that is, in the very axis of the rope. We can only ſay, that if a very ſoft line is formed in this way, it will not keep its twiſt. This ſhows that the turns in laying were more than what the elaſticity or hardening of the ſtrands required. The experiments made on ſoft lines always ſhowed a tendency to take a greater twiſt when the lines were made in the firſt manner, and a tendency to loſe their twiſt when made in Mr Du Hamel’s manner. We imagine that the true proportion is between theſe two extremes, and that we ſhall not err greatly if w’e halve the total ſhortening between the two parts of the proceſs. If working up to two-thirds be inſiſted upon, and if it be really too much, Mr Du Hamel’s repartition may be better, becauſe part of this working will quickly go off when the cordage is uſed. But it is ſurely better to be right in the main point, the total working up, and then to adjuſt the diſtribution of it ſo that the finiſhed cordage ſhall preciſely keep the form we have given to it. '</p><p>There muſt be the ſame uncertainty in the quadruple diſtribution of the working up a cable. When a cable has its yarns ſhortened to two-thirds, w <hi rend="sup">,</hi> e believe the ordinary practice has been, iff, To warp 180 fathoms; 2d, To harden up the ſtrands 30 fathoms ; 3d, To lay or cloſe up 13 fathoms ; 4th, To work up the hawſers nine fathoms ; 5th, To cloſe up eight fathoms. This leaves a cable of 120. Since Mr Du Hamel’s cxperi* ments have had an influence at Rochefort, the practice has been to warp 190, to harden up 38, to lay up 12; to work up the hawſers 1 o, and then to cloſe up fix ; andwfiιen the cable is finiſhed, to ſhorten it tw <hi rend="sup">r</hi> o fathoms . more, which our workmen call <hi rend="italic">throwing the turn well up.</hi> This leaves a cable of 1 2 2 fathoms.</p><p>As there ſeems little doubt of the ſuperiority of cordage ſhortened one-fourth over cordage ſhortened one-third, the followfing diſtribution may be adopted : warp</p>
<pb xml:id="eb03-16-r03-0493" facs="gri_33125011196389_0499.tif"/>
<p>190 fathoms, harden up 12, lay up l∣, work up the hawſers ι 2, and cloſe up 12 more, which will leave a cable of 143.</p><p>There is another queſtion about which the artiſts are divided in their opinions, viz. the ſtrams made uſe of during the operation. This is produced by the weight laid on the fledge. If this be too ſmall, the ſtrands will not be ſuſſiciently tightened, and will run into kinks. The fledge will come up by ſtarts ; and a ſmall inequality of twiſt in the ſtrands will throw it aſkew. The top will not run vzell without a conſiderable preſ-ſure to throw it from the doling point, and therefore the cordage will neither cloſe fairly nor firmly ; on the other hand, it is evident, that the ſtrain on the ſtrands is a complete expenditure of ſo much of their force, and it may be ſo great as to break them. Theſe are the extreme politions. And we think tha* <hi rend="sup">-</hi> it may be fairly deduced from our principles, that as great a ſtrain ſhould be laid on the ſtrands as will make good work, that is, as will enable the rope to cloſe nearly and completely, but no more. But can any general rule be given for this purpoſe ?</p><p>The practice at Rochefort was to load the fledge till its weight and load were double the weight of the yarns when warped 180 fathoms. A lix-inch hawſer will require about a ton. If we ſuppoſe the friction one-third of the weight ; the ſtrain on each ſtrand will be about two hundred and a quarter weight. Mr Du Hamel thinks this too great a load, and propoſes to put only five-fourths or three-ſeconds of the weight of the cordage ; and ſtill leſs if a ſhorter piece be warped, becauſe it does not require ſo much force to throw the twiſt from the two cranks to the middle of the ſtrand. We ſhall only ſay, that ſtronger ropes are made by heavy loading the carriage, and working up moderately, than by greater ſhortening, and a lighter load ; but all this is very vague.</p><p>The reader will naturally aſk, after this account of the manufacture, what is the general rule for computing the ſtrength of cordage ? It cannot be expected to be very preciſe. But if ropes are made in a manner perfectly ſimilar, we ſhould expect the ſtrength to be in proportion to the area of their ſection ; that is, to the ſquare of their diameters or circumferences, or to the number of equal threads contained in them.</p><p>Nor does it deviate far from this rule ; yet Mr Du Hamel ſhows, from a range of experiments made, on all cordage of 3⅜ inch circumference and under, that the ſtrength increaſes a little falter than the number of equal threads. Thus he found that ropes of</p><p>9 threads bore 1014 pounds, inſtead of 946</p><p>12 1564 1262</p><p>18 2148 1893.</p><p>We cannot pretend to account for this. W e muſt. alſo obſerve, that the ſtrength of cordage is greatly improved by making them of yarn ſpun fine. This requires finely dreſſed hemp and being more ſupple, the fibres lie cloſe, and do not form ſuch oblique ſpirals. But all hemp will not ſpin equally fine. Every ſtalk ſeems to confiſt of a certain number of principal fibres, which ſplit more eafily into a ſecond ſet, and theſe more difficultly into a third ſet, and ſo on. The ultimate fineneſs, therefore, which a reaſonable degree of drei-, fing can give to hemp, bears ſome proportion, not indeed very preciſe, to the ſize of the ſtalk. The Bri-tilh and Dutch uſe the beſt hemp, ſpin their yarn the fineſt, and their cordage is conſiderably ſtronger than the French, much of which is made of their own hemp, and others of a coarſe and harlh quality.</p><p>The following rule forjudging of the weight which a rope will bear is not far from the truth. It ſuppoſes' them rather too ſtrong ; but it is ſo eafily remembered that it may be of uſe.</p><p>Multiply the circumference in inches by itſelf, and take the fifth part of the product, it will expreſs the tons which the rope will carry. Thus, if the rope have 6 inches circumference, 6 times 6 is 36, the fifth of which is 7γ- tons ; apply this to the rope of 3 J, on which Sir Charles Knowles made the experiments formerly mentioned, 3 J- × 3 J = ιo,2j, <hi rend="italic">j-</hi> of which is 2,05 tons, or 4592 pounds. It broke with 4550.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">This may ſuſſice for an account of the mechanical part of the manufacture. But we have taken no notice of the operation of tarring ; and our reaſon was, that the methods practiſed in different rope-works are ſo exceedingly different, that we could hardly enumerate them, or even give a general account of them. It is evidently proper to tar in the ſtate of twine or yarn, this being the only way that the hemp could be uniformly penetrated. The yarn is made to wind off one reel, and having paſſed through a veſſel containing hot tar, it is wound up on another reel ; and the ſuperfluous tar is taken oſſ by paſſing through a hole ſurrounded with ſpongy oakum ; or it is tarred in ſkains or hauls, which are drawn by a capltern through the tar-kettle, and through a hole formed of two plates of metal, held together by a lever loaded with a weight.</hi></p><p>It is eſtabliſhed beyond a doubt, that tarred cordage when new is weaker than white, and that the difference increaſes by keeping. The following experiments were made by Mr Du Hamel at Rochefort on cordage of three inches (French) in circumference, made of the belt.

<p>Mr Du Hamel ſays, that it is decided by experi- <hi rend="sub">t</hi> ence, I. That white cordage in continual ſervice is one-third more durable than tarred. 2. That it retains its force much longer while kept in ſtore. 3. That it refills</p><p>the ordinary injuries of the weather one-fourth longer.</p><p>We know this one remarkable fact. In 1758 the ſhrowds and Hays of the Sheer hulk at Portſmouth dockyard were overhawled, and when the worming and ſervice were taken off, they were found to be of white cordage. On examining the ftorekeeper’s books, they were found to have been formerly the ſhrowds and rigging of the Royal William, of no guns, built in 1715, and rigged in 1716. She was thought top-heavy and unfit for ſea, and unrigged and her flores laid up. Some few years afterwards, her ſhrowds and Hays were fitted on the Sheer hulk, where they remained in confiant and very hard ſervice for about 30 years, while every tarred rope about her had been repeatedly renewed. This information we received from Mr Brown, boat-ſwain of the Royal William during the war 1758, &amp;c.</p><p>Why then do we tar cordage ? We thus render it more unpliant, weaker, and leſs durable. It is chiefly ſerviceable for cables and ground tackle, which muff be continually wetted and even ſoaked. The reſult of careful obſervation is, I. That white cordage, expoſed to be alternately very wet and dry, is weaker than tarred cordage. 2. That cordage which is ſuperficially tarred is conſtantly ſtronger than what is tarred throughout, and it refills better the alternatives of wet and dry. <hi rend="italic">N. B.</hi> The ſhrouds of the Sheer hulk werc well tarred and blacked, ſo that it was not known that they were of white cordage.</p><p>Tar is a curious ſubſtance, miſcible completely with water. Attempts were made to anoint cordage with oils and fats which do not mix with water. This was expected to defend them from its pernicious effects. But it was diſtinctly found that theſe matters made the fibres of hemp glide ſo eaſily on each other, that it was hardly poſſible to twiſt them permanently. Before they graſped each other ſo hard that they could not be drawn, they were ſtrained almoſt to breaking.</p><p>Attempts have been made to increaſe the ſtrength of cordage by tanning. But although it remains a conſtant practice in the manufacture of nets, it does not appear that much addition, either of ſtrength or durability, can be given to cordage by this means. The trial has been made with great care, and by per-ſons fully able to conduct the proceſs with propriety. But it is found that the yarns take ſo long time in drying, and are ſo much hurt by drying flowly, that the room required for a conſiderable rope-work would be immenſe ; and the improvement of the cordage is but trifling, and even equivocal. Indeed tanning is a chemical proceſs, and its effect depends entirely on the nature of the materials to which the tan is applied. It unqueſtionably condenſes, and even ſtrengthens, the fibre of leather : but for any thing that we know <hi rend="italic">à priori,</hi> it may deſtroy the coheſion of hemp and flax ; and experiment alone could decide the queſtion. The reſult has been unfavourable ; but it does not follow from this that a tan cannot be found which ſhall produce on the texture of vegetables effects ſimilar to what oak-bark and other aſtringents produce on the animal fibre or membrane. It is well known that ſome dyes increaſe the</p><p>ſtrength of flax and cotton, notwithſtanding the corro-ſion which we know to be produced by ſome of the ingredients.
