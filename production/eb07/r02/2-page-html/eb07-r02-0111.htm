<p><span class="font1">ter Silvia a vestal virgin, by which she became bound to perpetual celibacy. According to the legend, this scheme&nbsp;proved abortive ; for Silvia became pregnant by the god&nbsp;Mars, and was delivered of twin sons. Amulius ordered&nbsp;the infants to be thrown into the river, and their mother to&nbsp;be buried alive ; the doom of a vestal virgin who should&nbsp;violate her vow of chastity. The river happened at that&nbsp;time to have overflowed its banks, so that the two infants&nbsp;were not carried into the middle of the stream, but drifted&nbsp;along the margin, till the basket which contained them became entangled in the roots of a wild vine, at the foot of the&nbsp;Palatine hill. At this time a she-wolf coming down to the&nbsp;river to drink, suckled the infants, and carried them to her&nbsp;den among the thickets hard by. Here they were found&nbsp;by Faustulus, the king’s herdsman, who took them home to&nbsp;his wife Laurentia, by whom they were carefully nursed,&nbsp;and named Romulus and Remus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The two youths grew up, employed in the labours, the sports, and the perils of the pastoral occupation of their foster-father. But, like the two sons of Cymbeline, their royal&nbsp;blood could not be quite concealed. Their superior mein,&nbsp;courage, and abilities, soon acquired for them a decided superiority over their young compeers,and they became leaders&nbsp;of the youthful herdsman in their contests with robbers, or&nbsp;with rivals. Having quarrelled with the herdsmen of Numitor, whose flocks were accustomed to graze on the neighbouring hill Aventinus, Remus fell into an ambush, and w<sup>τ</sup>as&nbsp;dragged before Numitor to be punished. While Numitor,&nbsp;struck with the noble bearing of the youth, and influenced by the secret stirrings of nature within him, was hesitating what punishment to inflict, Romulus, accompanied&nbsp;by Faustulus, hastened to the rescue of Remus. On their&nbsp;arrival at Alba, the secret of their origin w<sup>,</sup>as discovered,&nbsp;and a plan was speedily organized for the expulsion of Amulius, and the restoration of their grandfather Numitor to his&nbsp;throne. This was soon accomplished ; but the twin brothers felt little disposition to remain in a subordinate position in Alba, after the enjoyment of the rude liberty and&nbsp;power to which they had been accustomed among their&nbsp;native hills. They therefore requested from their grandfather permission to build a city on the banks of the Tiber,&nbsp;where their lives had been so miraculously preserved.&nbsp;Scarcely had this permission been granted when a contest&nbsp;.arose between the two brothers respecting the site, the&nbsp;name, and the sovereignty of the city which they were&nbsp;about to found. Romulus wished it to be built on the Palatine hill, and to be called by his name ; Remus preferred&nbsp;the Aventine, and his own name. To terminate their dispute amicably, they agreed to refer it to the decision of the&nbsp;gods by augury. Romulus took his station on the Palatine&nbsp;hill, Remus on the Aventine. At sun-rise Remus saw six vul∙&nbsp;tures, and immediately afterwards Romulus saw twelve. The&nbsp;superiority was adjudged to Romulus, because he had seen the&nbsp;greater number, against which decision Remus remonstrated&nbsp;indignantly,on the ground that he had first received an omen.@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Romulus then proceeded to mark out the boundaries for the wall of the intended city. This was done by a plough&nbsp;with a brazen plough-share, drawn by a bull and a heifer,&nbsp;and so directed that the furrow should fall inward. The&nbsp;plough was lifted and carried over the spaces intended to&nbsp;be left for the gates ; and in this manner a square space was&nbsp;marked oβt, including the Palatine hill, and a small portion&nbsp;of the land at its base, termed </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Roma quadrata.</span><span class="font1"> This took&nbsp;place on the 21st of April, on the day of the festival of&nbsp;Pales, the goddess of shepherds. While the wall was beginning to rise above the surface, Remus, whose mind was&nbsp;still rankling with his discomfiture, leaped over it scornfully, saying, “ Shall such a wall as that keep your city!” Immediately Romulus, or, as others say, Celer, who had charge&nbsp;of erecting that part of the wall, struck him dead to the&nbsp;ground with the implement in his hand, exclaiming, “ So&nbsp;perish whosoever shall hereafter overleap these walls.” By&nbsp;this event Romulus was left the sole sovereign of the city ; yet&nbsp;he felt deep remorse at his brother’s fate, buried him honourably, and when he sat to administer justice, placed an&nbsp;empty throne by his side, with a sceptre and crown, as if acknowledging the right of his brother to the possession of&nbsp;equal power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">To augment as speedily as possible the number of his subjects, Romulus set apart in his new city a place of refuge, to which any man might flee, and be protected from bis&nbsp;pursuers. By this device the population increased rapidly&nbsp;in males ; but there was a great deficiency of females ; for&nbsp;the adjoining states, regarding the followers of Romulus as&nbsp;little better than a horde of brigands, refused to sanction&nbsp;intermarriages. But the schemes of Romulus were not to&nbsp;be so frustrated. In honour of the god Consus, he proclaimed games, to which he invited the neighbouring states.&nbsp;Great numbers came, accompanied by their families; and at&nbsp;an appointed signal, the Roman youth, rushing suddenly&nbsp;into the midst of the spectators, snatched up the unmarried&nbsp;women in their arms, and bore them off hy force. This&nbsp;outrage was immediately resented, and Romulus found himself involved in a war with all the surrounding states. Fortunately for Rome, though these states had sustained a common injury, they did not unite their forces in the common&nbsp;cause. They fought singly, and were each in turn defeated ; Cænina, Antemnæ, and Crustumerium, fell successively before the Roman arms. Romulus slew with his own&nbsp;hand, Aeron, king of Cænina, and bore off his spoils, dedicating them as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">spoila opima,</span><span class="font1"> to Jupiter Feretrius. The&nbsp;third part of the lands of the conquered towns was seized&nbsp;by the conquerors ; and such of the people of these towns&nbsp;as were willing to remove to Rome, were received as free&nbsp;citizens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the mean time, the Sabines, to avenge the insult which they had sustained, had collected together their forces under&nbsp;tile command of Titus Tatius, king of the Quirites, or people&nbsp;of the Sabine town of Cures. The Romans were unable to&nbsp;meet so strong an army in the field, and withdrew within&nbsp;their walls. They had previously placed their flocks in&nbsp;what they thought a place of safety, on the Capitoline hill,&nbsp;which, strong as it was by nature, they had still further secured by additional fortifications. Tarpeia, the daughter&nbsp;of the commander of that fortress, having fallen into the&nbsp;hands of the Sabines, agreed to betray the access to the&nbsp;hill, for the ornaments they wore upon their arms. At their&nbsp;approach she opened the gate, and as they entered, they&nbsp;crushed her to death beneath their shields. From her the clift&nbsp;of the Capitoline hill was called the Tarpeian rock. The attempt of the Romans to regain this place of strength brought&nbsp;on a general engagement. The combat was long and doubtful. At one time the Romans were almost driven into the&nbsp;city, which the Sabines were on the point of entering along&nbsp;with them, when fresh courage was infused into the fugitives, in consequence of Romulus vowing a temple to Jupiter Stator, and by a stream of water which rushed out of&nbsp;the temple of Janus, and swept away the Sabines from the&nbsp;gate. The bloody struggle was renewed during several&nbsp;successive days, with various fortune and great mutual</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1">@@@<sup>1</sup> According to the interpretation of the Etruscan augurs, the twelve vultures seen by Romulus portended that the duration of the city would extend to twelve centuries ; and it may strike even an incredulous reader us remarkable, that the actual duration of Rome as a freι&nbsp;and imperial city coincided very nearly with the time assigned by this augury. It ended in the 1229th year of thecity, by the dethronemen<sup>,&nbsp;</sup>of the last emperor Romulus Augustulus.</span></p>
