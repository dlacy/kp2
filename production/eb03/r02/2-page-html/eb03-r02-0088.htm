<p><span class="font0">even from his firſt appearance in public life, his abilities had begun to attract the.notice of obſerving men ; and&nbsp;to his more intimate friends he diſcovered marks of ſuch&nbsp;high-minded ambition, as, ſeconded by thoſe abilities,&nbsp;could not have failed to carry him to the firſt honours&nbsp;of his profeſſion, in whatever ſphere he had been placed, and whatever oppoſition he might have had to&nbsp;combat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The firſt theatre that offered for the diſplay of his talents, was the General Aſſembly of the Church of&nbsp;Scotland. It iε the annual meetings of this court that&nbsp;produce to view men who would otherwiſe remain in&nbsp;τhe deepeſt obſcuritv. Ί here the humble paſtor, whole&nbsp;lot has been call in the remoteſt corner of the Highland wilds, feels himſelf, for a time, on a footing of&nbsp;equality with the firſt citizen in the kingdom : he can&nbsp;there diſpute with him the prize of eloquence, the moſt&nbsp;flattering diſtinction to a liberal mind ; a diſtinction&nbsp;which is naturally ſought after with the greater eager-neſs in that aſſembly, as the ſimple eſtabliſhment of the&nbsp;church of Scotland has rendered it the only pre-eminence to which the greateſt part of its members can&nbsp;ever hope to attain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">From the moment Dr Robertſon firſt appeared in this aſſembly, he became the object of univerſal attention and applauſe. His ſpeeches were marked with&nbsp;the ſame manly and perſuaſive eloquence that diſtin-guiſhcs his hiſtorical compoſitions ; and it was obſerved&nbsp;by all, that while his young rivals in oratory contented&nbsp;themſelves with opening a cauſe, or delivering a ſtudied&nbsp;harangue, he ſhowed equal ability to ſtart objections,&nbsp;to anſwer, or to reply ; and that even his moſt unpremeditated eſſuſions were not unadorned with thoſe harmonious and ſeemingly meaſured periods, which have&nbsp;been ſo much admired in his works of labour and reflection. He ſoon came to be conſidered as the ableſt&nbsp;ſupporter of the cauſe he choſe to eſpouſe, and was&nbsp;now the unrivalled leader of one of the great parties&nbsp;which have long divided the church of which he was a&nbsp;member.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When we reflect upon this circumſtance, and conſider how much mankind are the ſame in every ſociety, we&nbsp;ſhall be the leſs ſurpriſed to find, in the literary works&nbsp;of Dr Robertſon, an acquaintance with the human&nbsp;heart, and a knowledge of the world, which we look for&nbsp;in vain in other hiſtorians. The man who has ſpent&nbsp;his life in the difficult taſlc of conducting the deliberations of a popular aſſembly, in regulating the paſſions,&nbsp;the interdis, the prejudices, of a numerous faction, has&nbsp;advantages over the pedant, or mere man of letters,&nbsp;which no ability, no ſtudy, no ſecond-hand information,&nbsp;can ever compenſate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The firſt work which extended the Doctor’s reputation beyond the walls of the general aſſembly, was a ſermon preached at Edinburgh before the ſociety for&nbsp;propagating Chriſtian knowledge, and afterwards publiſhed ; the ſubject of which was, ‘ The ſtate of the&nbsp;world at the appearance of Jeſus Chriſt.’ The ingenuity with which a number of detached circumſtances&nbsp;are there collected, and ſhown to tend to one Angle&nbsp;point, may perhaps rival the art which is ſo much admired in the b’ſhop of Meaux’s celebrated Univerſal&nbsp;Hiſtory.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a><h4><span class="font1">This ſermon did great honour to the author ; and it is probably to the reputation he gained by it, that we</span></h4>
<p><span class="font0">ought to attribute the unanimity with which he was called to be one of the miniſters of Edinburgh—an&nbsp;event which happened not long after, viz. in the year&nbsp;1758. In 1759, he publiſhed, in two volumes quarto,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">‘ The Hiſtory of Scotland, during the reigns of Queen Mary and of King James VI. till his Acceſſion to the&nbsp;Crown of England, wiſh a Review of the Scots Hiſtory previous to that period.’ This work in its ſtructure&nbsp;is one of the moſt complete of all modern hiſtories. It&nbsp;is not a dry jejune narrative of events, deſtitute of ornament ; nor is it a mere frothy relation, all glow and&nbsp;colouring. <sup>r</sup>Ihe hiftoria∙.ι diſcovers a ſufficient ſtore of&nbsp;imagination to engage the reader’s attention, wiſh a&nbsp;due proportion of judgment to check the exuberance of&nbsp;fancy. The arrangtment of his work is admirable, and&nbsp;his deſcriptions are animated. His ſtyle is copious,&nbsp;nervous, and correct. He has diſplay ed conſummate&nbsp;ſkill in rendering ſuch paſſages of our hiſtory as are familiar to our recollection agreeable and entertaining.&nbsp;He has embelliſhed old materials with all the elegance&nbsp;of modern dreſs. He has very judſeiouſly avoided too&nbsp;circumſtantial a detail of trite facts. His narratives arc&nbsp;ſuccinct and ſpirited ; his reflections copious, frequent,&nbsp;and generally pertinent. His ſentiments reſpecting the&nbsp;guilt of Mary have indeed been warmly controverted by&nbsp;Meſſrs Tytler, Stuart, and Whitaker ; and the general&nbsp;opinion now ſeems to be, that their victory is complete.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">1 hat victory, however, on the part of Whitaker, is ſullied by the acrimony with which he writes. Dr Robertſon was no rancorous or malignant enemy of the&nbsp;unfortunate queen. While relating, what he doubtleſs&nbsp;believed, he makes every poſſible allowance for Mary&nbsp;from the circumſtances in which ſhe was placed ; and&nbsp;his hiſtory will be read with pleaſure by candid men of&nbsp;all parties as long as the language in which it is com·,&nbsp;poſed ſhall continue to be underſtood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1769, Dr Robertſon publiſhed, in three volumes quarto, The Hiſtory of the Reign of the Emperor&nbsp;Charles V. with a View of the Progreſs of Society in&nbsp;Europe, from the Subverſion of the Roman Empire&nbsp;to the beginning of the 16th century.—The vaſt and&nbsp;general importance of the period which this hiſtory&nbsp;compriſes, together with the reputation which our hi-ſtorian had deſervedly acquired, co-operated to raiſe&nbsp;ſuch high expectations in the public, that no work perhaps was ever more impatiently wiſhed for, or peruſed «&nbsp;with greater avidity. The firſt volume (which is a preliminary one, containing the progreſs of ſociety in Europe, as mentioned in the title) is a very valuable part&nbsp;of the work ; for it ſerves not only as a key to the&nbsp;pages that follow, but may be conſidered as a general&nbsp;introduction to the ſtudy of hiſtory in that period in&nbsp;which the ſeveral powers of Europe were formed into&nbsp;one great political ſyſtem, in which each took a ſtation,&nbsp;wherein it has ſince remained (till within a very few&nbsp;years at leaſt) with leſs alterations than could have been&nbsp;expected, after the ſhocks occaſioned by ſo many internal revolutions, and ſo many foreign wars. Of the hiſtory itſelf, it may be ſufficient to obſerve, that it is&nbsp;juſtly ranked among the capital pieces of hiſtorical excellence. There is an elegance of expreſſion, a depth&nbsp;of diſcernment, and a correctneſs of judgment, which&nbsp;do honour to the hiſtorian. The characters are inimitably penned. They are not contraſted by a ſtudied&nbsp;antitheſis, but by an oppoſition which reſults from a</span></p>
