<p><span class="font0">now ungovernable : having no enemy to wreck his reſentment upon, he turned it againſt his own commanders. He put many of his generals to death, as if the city had held out through their neglect or incapacity,&nbsp;while famine made great depredations upon the reſt of&nbsp;his army. Nothing now appeared on either ſide to&nbsp;terminate the conteſt, except the total deſtruction of&nbsp;either. But a mutiny in Maximinus’s own army a&nbsp;while reſcued the declining empire from deſtruction,&nbsp;and ſaved the lives of thouſands. The ſoldiers being&nbsp;long haraſſed by famine and fatigue, and hearing of&nbsp;revolts on every ſide, reſolved to terminate their calamities by the tyrant’s death. His great ſtrength, and&nbsp;his being always armed, w<sup>,</sup>ere, at firſt, the principal&nbsp;motives to deter any from aſſaſſinating him ; but at&nbsp;length having made his guards accomplices in their&nbsp;deſign, they ſet upon him, while he ſlept at noon in&nbsp;his tent, and (lew both him and his ſon, whom he had&nbsp;made his partner in the empire, without any oppoſition, after an uſurpation of about three years, and in&nbsp;the 65th year of his age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The tyrant being dead, and his body thrown to the dogs and birds of prey, Pupienus and Balbinus continued for ſome time emperors without oppoſition. But&nbsp;the prætorian ſoldiers, who had long been notorious&nbsp;for mutiny and treaſon, ſoon reſolved on further change.&nbsp;Nor did the diſſenſions between the new made emperors&nbsp;themſelves a little contribute to their downfall : for&nbsp;though both were remarkable for wiſdom and age, yet&nbsp;they could not reſtrain the mutual jealouſy of each&nbsp;other’s power. Pupienus claimed the ſuperiority from&nbsp;his great experience ; while Balbinus was equally aſpiring upon account of his family and fortune.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In this ill-judged conteſt, the prætorian ſoldiers, who were enemies to both, ſet upon them in their palace, at a time their guards were amuſed with ſeeing&nbsp;the Capitoline games. Pupienus perceiving their tumultuous approach, ſent with the utmoſt ſpeed for&nbsp;aſſiſtance from his colleague ; but he, out of a culpable&nbsp;ſuſpicion that ſomething was deſigned only againſt himſelf, refuſed to ſend ſuch of the German guards as were&nbsp;next his perſon. Thus the ſeditious ſoldiers found an&nbsp;eaſy acceſs to both the emperors apartments ; and dragging them from the palace towards the camp, flew them&nbsp;both, leaving their dead bodies in the ſtreets, as a dreadful inſtance of their ſedition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the midſt of this ſedition, as the mutineers were proceeding along, they by accident met Gordian, the&nbsp;grandſon of him who was ſlain in Africa, and declared him emperor on the ſpot. The ſenate and people&nbsp;had been loug reduced to the neceſſity of ſuffering&nbsp;their emperors to be nominated by the army ; ſo that&nbsp;all they could do in the preſent inſtance was to confirm their choice. This prince was but 16 years old&nbsp;when he began his reign, but his virtues ſeemed to&nbsp;compenſate for his want of experience. His principal&nbsp;aims were, to unite the oppoſing members of the government, and to reconcile the ſoldiers and citizens&nbsp;to each other. His learning is ſaid to have been equal&nbsp;to Lis virtues ; and we are aſſured that he had 62,000&nbsp;books in his library. His reſpect for Mifithæus, his&nbsp;governor and inſtructor, was ſuch, that he married his&nbsp;daughter, and profited by his co-unſels in all the critical circumſtances of his reign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The firſt four years of this emperor’s reign were attended with the utmoſt proſperity ; but in the fifth&nbsp;he was alarmed with accounts from the eaſt, that Sapor, king of Perſia, had furiouſly invaded the confines&nbsp;of the Roman empire, and having taken Antioch, had&nbsp;pillaged Syria and all the adjacent provinces. Beſides&nbsp;the Perſians, the Goths alſo invaded the empire ou&nbsp;their ſide, pouring down like an inundation from the&nbsp;north, and attempting to fix their reſidence in the&nbsp;kingdom of 1 hrace. To oppoſe both theſe invaſions,&nbsp;Gordian prepared an army ; and having gained ſome&nbsp;victories over the Goths, whom he obliged to retire, he&nbsp;turned his arms againſt the Perſians, whom he defeated&nbsp;upon ſeveral occaſions, and forced to return home with&nbsp;diſgrace. In gaining theſe advantages, Mifithæus,&nbsp;whom he had made prætorian prefect, had the principal ſhare ; but he dying ſoon after (as it is ſuppoſed&nbsp;being poiſoned by Philip an Arabian, who was appointed his ſucceſſor), the fortunes of Gordian ſeemed&nbsp;to die with him. The army began to be no longer&nbsp;ſupplied with proviſions as uſual ; murmurs were heard&nbsp;to prevail, and theſe were artfully fomented by Philip. Things thus proceeding from bad to worſe, Philip was at firſt made his equal in the command of the&nbsp;empire ; ſhortly after, inveſted with the ſole power ;&nbsp;and, at length, finding himſelf capable of perpetrating&nbsp;his long meditated cruelty, Gordian was, by his order,&nbsp;ſlain, in the 22d year of his age, after a ſucceſsful reign&nbsp;of near ſix years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Philip having thus murdered his benefactor, was fo fortunate as to be immediately acknowledged emperor&nbsp;by the army. The ſenate alſo, though they ſeemed at&nbsp;firſt to oppoſe his power, confirmed his election, and&nbsp;gave him, as uſual, the tide of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Auguſtus.</span><span class="font0"> Philip was&nbsp;about 40 years old when he came to the throne ; being&nbsp;the ſon of an obſcure Arabian, who had been captain&nbsp;of a band of robbers. Upon his exaltation, he aſſo-ciattd his ſon, a boy of fix years of age, as his partner&nbsp;in the empire ; and, in order to ſecure his power at&nbsp;home, made peace with the Perſians, and marched his&nbsp;army towards Rome. On his way, having conceived·&nbsp;a deſire to viſit his native country of Arabia, he built&nbsp;there a city called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Philippopolis ;</span><span class="font0"> and from thence returning to Rome, he was received as emperor, and&nbsp;treated with all the marks of ſubmiſſion, though not&nbsp;of joy. To put the people </span><span class="font1">in </span><span class="font0">good humour, he cauſed&nbsp;the ſecular games to be celebrated, with a magnificence&nbsp;ſuperior to any of his predeceſſors, it being, juſt 1000&nbsp;years after the building of the city. Upon occaſion of&nbsp;theſe games, we are told that both Philip and his ſorr&nbsp;were converted to Chriſtianity. However this be, a&nbsp;murderer and an ungrateful uſurper does no great honour to whatever opinion he may happen to embrace.&nbsp;We have little account of the latter part of his reign in&nbsp;the wretched and mutilated hiſtories of the times ; we&nbsp;only learn, that the Goths having invaded the empire,&nbsp;Marinus, Philip’s lieutenant, who was ſent againſt&nbsp;them, revolted, and cauſed himſelf to be declared emperor. This revolt, however, was but of ſhort duration ; for the army which had raiſed him repented of&nbsp;their raſhneſs, depoſed him with equal levity, and put&nbsp;him to death. Decius was the perſon whom Philip,&nbsp;appointed to command in the room of the revolting&nbsp;general» The chief merit of Decius with the emperor</span></p>
