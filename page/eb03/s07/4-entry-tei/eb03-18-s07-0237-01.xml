(Emanuel), was born at Stockholm on the 29th of January 1689. His father was biſhop of Weſt-Cothia ; member of a ſociety for the propagation of the goſpel, formed on the plan of that of England ; and preſident of the Swediſh church in Pennſylvania and London. To this laſt office he was appointed by Charles XII. who ſeems to have had a great regard for the biſhop, and to have continued that regard to his ſon.</p><p>Of the courſe of young Swedenborg’s education we have procured no account ; but from the character of the father, it may be ſuppoſed to have been pious ; and by his appearing with reputation as an author, when but 20 years of age, it is proved to have been succesful.∙ His firſt work was publiſhed in 1709 ; and the year following he sent into the world a collection of pieces on different ſubjects, in Latin verſe, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Ludus Heliconius, live Carolina Miscellanea quae variis in locis cecinit.</hi> The ſame year he began his travels, firſt into England, and afterwards into Holland, France, and Germany ; and returning to Stockholm in 1714, he was two years afterwards appointed to the office of assessor in the Metallic College by Charles XII. who honoured him with frequent conversations, and bestowed upon him a large ſhare of his favour. At this period of his life Swedenborg devoted his attention principally to phyſic and mathematical ſtudies ; and in 1718 he accompanied the king to the liege of Frederickſhall, where he gave an eminent proof that he had not ſtudied in vain. Charles could not send his heavy artillery to Frederickſhall from the badneſs of the roads, which were then rendered much worſe than uſual by being deeply covered with ſnow. In this extremity Swedenborg brought the ſciences to the aid of valour. By the help of proper inſtruments he cut through the mountains, and raised the valleys which ſeparated Sweden from Norway, and then ſent to his master two galleys, five large boats, and a ſloop, loaded with battering pieces, to be employed in the siege. The length of this canal was about two miles and a half. The execution of this great work, however, did not occupy all his time. In 1716 he had begun to publiſh essays and obſervations on the mathematical and phyſical ſciences, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Daedalus Hyperboreus;</hi> and he found leisure during the siege to complete his intended collection, and alſo in the same year to publiſh an introduction to algebra, under the whimſical title of <hi rend="italic">The Art of the Rules.</hi></p><p>At the siege of Frederickſhall he lost his patron Charles; but found another in Ulrica Eleonora, the sister and ſuccesſor of that hero, by whom in 1719 he was ennobled, and took of courſe his ſeat among the ſenators of the equeſtrian order in the triennial aſſemblies of the ſtates. His promotion did not leſſen his ardour for the ſciences ; for he publiſhed in the ſame year <hi rend="italic">A Method to fix the Value of Money, and to determine the Swedish Meaſures in ſuch a way as to ſuppreſs all the Fractions and facilitate the Calculations.</hi> About the ſame time he gave the public a treatiſe on <hi rend="italic">the Position</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">and Courſe of the Planets ;</hi> with another on <hi rend="italic">the Height of the Tides, and Flux and Reflux of the Sea ;</hi> which, from information gathered in different parts of Sweden, appeared to have been greater formerly than when he wrote.</p><p>As Swedenborg continued, under the new ſovereign, to hold the office of aſſeſſor to the Metallic College, he thought it neceſſary, for the diſcharge of his duty, to make a ſecond journey into foreign countries, that he might himſelf examine their mines, particularly thoſe of Saxony and Harts. During theſe travels, which were undertaken for the improvement of the manufactures of his native country, he printed at Amſterdam<note anchored="false" n="1" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>European Magazine, 1787, July.</p></note>, 1. <hi rend="italic">Prodromus principiorum Naturalium, five novorum tentaminum, Chemiam et Physicam experimentalem geometrice explicandi.</hi> 2. <hi rend="italic">Nova observata &amp; inventa circa Ferrum &amp; Ignem, praecipue naturam Ignis Elementarum, una cum nova Camini inventione.</hi> 3. <hi rend="italic">Methodus nova inveniendi Longitudines locorum terrae marique ope Lunae.</hi> 4. <hi rend="italic">Modus construendi receptacula navalia, vulgo en Suedois, Dockybynadder.</hi> 5. <hi rend="italic">Nova constructio aggeris aquotici.</hi> 6. <hi rend="italic">Modus explorandi virtutes Navigiorum.</hi> And at Leipſic and Hamburg, 7. <hi rend="italic">Miscellanea observata circa res naturales, praesertim Mineralia, Ignem, &amp; Montium stratae.</hi></p><p>This journey was made, and theſe tracts publiſhed, in the compaſs of a year and a half ; and perhaps there has not been another man, Linnæus excepted, who has done ſo much in ſo ſhort a time. After his return in 1722, Swedenborg divided his time ſo equally between the duties of his office and his private ſtudies, that in 1733 he finiſhed his grand work, entitled <hi rend="italic">Opera Philosophica &amp; Mineralia,</hi> and had it printed under his own direction in 1734, part at Dreſden and part at Leipſic ; in which year he alſo went to inspect the mines of Auſtria and Hungary. This work is divided into three volumes folio ; the title of the firſt is <hi rend="italic">Principia rerum Naturalium sive novorum tentaminum, Phaenomena Mundi elementares philosophice explicandi.</hi> The ſecond, <hi rend="italic">Regnum subterraneum sive Minerale de Ferro ;</hi> and the third, <hi rend="italic">Regnum subterrameum sive Minerale de Cupro, &amp; Orichalco ;</hi> all of them written with great ſtrength of judgment, and ornamented with plates, to facilitate the comprehenſion of the text.</p><p>In the year 1729 he was enrolled among the members of the Society of Sciences at Upſal, and was, probably about the ſame time, made a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Stockholm ; nor were ſtrangers leſs willing than his own countrymen to acknowledge the greatneſs of his merit. Wolfius, with many other learned foreigners, were eager to court his correspondence. The Academy of St Petersburg ſent him, on the 17th of December 1734, diploma of aſſociation as a correspondent member ; and ſoon afterwards the editors of the <hi rend="italic">Acta Eruditorum</hi> at Leipſic found in his works a valuabſe ſupplement to their own collection.</p><p>By many persons the approbation of learned academies would have been highly valued ; but by Baron Swedenborg it was conſidered as of very little importance. “ Whatever of wordly honour and advantage may appear to be it the things before mentioned, I hold them (ſays he<note anchored="true" n="2" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>Short Account of the Honourable E. Swedenborg.</p></note>) but as matters of low eſtimation, when compared to the honour of that holy office to which the Lord himſelf hath called me, who was graciouſly pleaſed to manifeſt himſelf to me, his unworthy servant, in a personal appearance, in the year 1743, to open in me a sight of the spiritual world, and to enable me to converſe with ſpirits and angels ; and this privilege has continued with me to this day. From that time I began to print and publiſh various unknown <hi rend="italic">Arcana,</hi> which have been either ſeen by me or revealed to me, concerning heaven and hell, the ſtate of men after death, the true wor-<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0244.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0238"/>
ſhip of God, the ſpiritual ſenſe of the Scriptures, and many other important truths tending to ſalvation and true wisdom.”</p><p>We ſhall not affront the underſtandings of our readers by making upon this account of the Baron’s <hi rend="italic">call</hi> ſuch reflections as every person of a sound mind will make for himſelf; but it is rather remarkable, that a man who had devoted the better part of his life to the ſtudy of ſuch ſciences as generally fortify the mind againſt the deluſions of fanaticiſm, and who had even excelled in theſe ſciences, ſhould have fallen into such a reverie as this. After this extraordinary call, the Baron dedicated himſelf wholly to the great work which, he ſuppoſed, was aſſigned him, ſtudying diligently the word of God and from time to time publishing to his fellow-creatures ſuch important information as was made known to him concerning another world. Among his various diſcoveries concerning the spiritual world, One is, that it exiſts not in ſpace<note anchored="false" n="3" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>Swedenborg's Universal Theology, vol. i. p. 87.</p></note>. “ Of this (says he) I was convinced, becauſe I could there see Africans and Indians very near me, although they are ſo many miles diſtant here on earth ; nay, that I could be made preſent with the inhabitants of other planets in our ſyſtem, and also with the inhabitants of planets that are in other worlds, and revolve about other suns. By virtue of ſuch preſence (i. <hi rend="italic">e.</hi> without teal ſpace), not of place, I have converſed with apostles, departed popes, emperors, and kings ; with the late reformers of the church, Luther, Calvin, and Melancthon, and with others ſrom diſtant countries.”</p><p>Notwithſtanding the want of ſpace in the ſpiritual world, he tells us, “ that after death a man is ſo little changed that he even does not know but he is living in the preſent world; that he eats and drinks, and even enjoys conjugal delight as in this world<note anchored="false" n="4" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>Ibid. N⁰ 734.</p></note>; that the reſemblance between the two worlds is ſo great, that in the ſpiritual world there are cities, with palaces and houſes, and alſo writings and books, employments and merchandizes ; that there is gold, filver, and precious ſtones there. In a word (he says), there is in the ſpiritual world all and every thing that there is in the natural world, but that in heaven ſuch things are in an infinitely more perfect ſtate.”</p><p>Such was his zeal in the propagation of theſe whimſical and ſometimes ſensual doctrines, that he frequently left his native country to visit diſtant cities, particularly London and Amſterdam, where all his theological works were printed at a great expence, and with little proſpect or probability of a reimburſement. “ Wherever he reſided when on his travels, he was (says one of his admirers<note anchored="false" n="5" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>Short Account, &amp;c. p. 11 and Harley's to the Treatise on Influx.</p></note>) a mere ſolitary, and almoſt inacceſſible, though in his own country of a free and open behaviour. He affected no honour, but declined it ; purſued no worldly intereſt, but ſpent his time in travelling and printing, in order to communicate inſtruction and benefit to mankind. He had nothing of the preciſe in his manner, nothing of melancholy in his temper, and nothing in the leaſt bordering on enthusiaſm in his conversation or writings.” This is too much. We believe he was an inoffenſive viſionary ; of his converſation we cannot judge ; but the specimens that we have given of his writings are frantic enthusiaſm. He died at London, March 29th, in the year 1772 ; and after lying in ſtate, his remains were depoſited in a vault at the Swediſh church, near Radcliff- Highway.</p><p>Though Baron Swedenborg’s followers appear not to have been numerous during his life, they have increaſed ſince his death ; and a ſect ſubſiſts at preſent in England which derives its origin from him, and is called <hi rend="italic">the New Jeruſalem Church.</hi> The discriminating tenets of this ſect ſeem to be the following : “ Holding the doctrine of one God, they maintain that this one God is no other than Jesus</p><p>Chriſt, and that he always exiſted in a human form ; that for the ſake of redeeming the world, he took upon himſelf a proper human or material body, but not a human soul ; that this redemption conſiſts in bringing the hells or evil ſpirits into ſubjection, and the heavens into order and regulation, and thereby preparing the way for a new ſpiritual church ; that without ſuch redemption no man could be ſaved, nor could the angels retain their ſtate of integrity ; that their redemption was effected by means of trials, temptations, or conflicts with evil ſpirits ; and that the laſt of them, by which Chriſt glorified his humanity, perfecting the union of his divine with his human nature, was the paſſion of the croſs.<note anchored="false" n="6" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>Priestly's Letters to the New Jerusalem Church, p. 4. &amp;c.</p></note> Though they maintain that there is but one God, and one divine person, they hold that in this perſon there is a real Trinity ; consiſting of the divinity, the humanity, and the operation of them both in the Lord Jeſus ; a Trinity which did not exiſt from all eternity, but commenced at the incarnation. They believe that the Scriptures are to be interpreted not only in a literal but in a spiritual ſenſe, not known to the world till it was revealed to 13. Swedenborg ; and that this ſpiritual ſenſe extends to every part of Scripture, except the Acts of the Apoſtles. They believe that there are angels attending upon men, reſiding, as B. Swedenborg says, in their affections ; that temptation conſiſts in a ſtruggle between good and bad angels within men ; and that by this means God aſſiſts men in theſe temptations, ſince of themſelves they could do nothing. Indeed B. Swedenborg maintains, that there is an universal influx from God into the souls of men, inſpiring them eſpecially with the belief of the divine unity. This efflux of divine light on the ſpiritual world he compares to the efflux of the light from the ſun in the natural world.</p><p>“ There are (says B. Swedenborg) two worlds, the natural and the ſpiritual, entirely diſtinct, though perfectly correſponding to each other ; that at death a man enters into the ſpiritual world, when his soul is clothed with a body, which he terms <hi rend="italic">ſubstantial,</hi> in oppoſition to the preſent <hi rend="italic">material</hi> body, which, he says, is never to rise out of the grave.”</p></div></body></text></TEI>
