a volatile matter arising from wood and other fuel along with the smoke ; or rather it is the smoke itself con densed, and gathered to the sides of the chimney. Though once volatile, however, soot cannot be again resolved into vapour, but, if distilled by a strong fire, yields a volatile al kali and empyreumatic oil, a considerable quantity of fixed matter remaining at the bottom of the distilling vessel. If burnt in an open fire, it flames with a thick smoke, whence other soot is produced. It is used as a material for making sal ammoniac, and as a manure.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
