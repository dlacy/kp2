                <p><label>SHAKESPEARE</label> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Shakspeare</hi> (William), the
                    prince of dramatic writers, was born at Stratford upon Avon in Warwickshire, on
                    the 23d of April 1564. From the regiſter of that town, it appears that a plague
                    broke out there on the 30th of June following, which raged with great violence ;
                    but fortunately it did not reach the houſe in which this infant prodigy lay. His
                    father, John Shakeſpeare, enjoyed a ſmall patrimonial eſtate, and was a
                    considerable dealer in wool ; his mother was the daughter and heir of Robert
                    Arden of Wellingcote. Our illuſtrious poet being designed for the busineſs of
                    his father, received no better education than the inductions which the
                    free-school of Stratford could afford. After applying ſome time to the ſtudy of
                    Latin, he was called home to aſſiſt his father, who ſeems by ſome accident to
                    have been reduced in his circumſtances. Before arriving at the age of 19, he
                    married the daughter of Mr Hathaway, a ſubſtantial yeoman in the neighbourhood
                    of Stratford. This lady was eight years older than her huſband, Having the
                    misfortune to fall into bad company, he was seduced into ſome profligate
                    actions, which drew on him a criminal proſecution, and at length forced him to
                    take refuge in the capital. In concert with his associates, he broke into a park
                    belonging to Sir Thomas Lucy of Charlecote, and carried off ſome of his deer,
                    Every admirer of Shakeſpeare will regret that ſuch a blemiſh ſhould have ſtained
                    his character ;<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0338.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0332"
                    /> but, perhaps, if any thing can extenuate his guilt, we might aſcribe it to
                    the opinions of the age, which, perhaps, as was formerly the caſe in Scotland,
                    might not diſtinguiſh the killing of deer by any mark of diſgrace, or any charge
                    of criminality. One thing at leaſt is certain, that Shakeſpeare himſelf thought
                    that the proſecution which Sir Thomas raiſed againſt him was carried on with too
                    great ſeverity ; an opinion which he could not have entertained had this action
                    been at that time viewed in the ſame criminal light as it is at preſent.
                    Shakespeare teſtified his reſentment againſt Sir Thomas, by writing a satirical
                    ballad, which exaſperated him ſo much, that the proceſs was carried on with
                    redoubled violence ; and the young poet, in order to avoid the punishment of the
                    law, was obliged to make his escaρe. This ballad would be conſidered as a
                    curious relict, on account of its being the firſt production of Shakeſpeare ; it
                    would also be intereſting to peruſe a poem which could irritate the baronet to
                    ſo high a degree. Tradition has preferred the firſt ſtanza:</p>
                <lg>
                    <l>A parliamente member, a juſtice of peace,</l>
                    <l>At home a poor ſcare-crow, at London an aſſe.</l>
                    <l>If lowſie is Lucy, as ſome volke miſcalle it,</l>
                    <l>Then Lucy is lowſie whatever befall it :</l>
                    <l> He thinks himſelf greate,</l>
                    <l> Yet an aſſe in his ſtate,</l>
                    <l>We allowe by his ears, but with aſſes to mate.</l>
                    <l>If Lucy is lowſie, as ſome volke miſcalle it,</l>
                    <l>Sing lowſie Lucy whatever befall it.</l>
                </lg>
                <p>If the reſt of the ballad was of a piece with this ſtanza, it might aſſiſt us to
                    form ſome opinion of the irritability of the baronet, but will enable us to form
                    no idea of the opening genius of Shakeſpeare.</p>
                <p>Thus expelled from his native village, he repaired to London, where be was glad
                    to accept a ſubordinate office in the theatre. It has been ſaid that he was
                    firſt engaged, while the play was acting, in holding the horſes of thoſe who
                    rode to the theatre ; but this ſtory reſts on a ſlender foundation. As his name
                    is found printed among thoſe of the other players before ſome old plays, it is
                    probable that he was ſome time employed as an actor ; but we are not informed
                    what characters he played ; we are only told, that the part which he acted best
                    was that of the Ghoſt in Hamlet ; and that he appeared in the character of Adam
                    in As <hi rend="italic">you like it.</hi> If the names of the actors prefixed to
                    Ben Jonſon’s play of <hi rend="italic">Every Man in his Humour</hi> were
                    arranged in the ſame order as the perſons repreſented, which is very probable,
                    Shakeſpeare played the part of Old Knowell. We have reaſon therefore to ſuppoſe,
                    as far as we can argue from theſe few facts, that he generally repreſented old
                    men. See Malone’s Chronology, in his edition of Shakeſpeare.</p>
                <p>But though he was not qualified to ſhine as an actor, he was now in the ſituation
                    which could most effectually rouſe thoſe latent ſparks of genius which
                    afterwards burſt forth with ſo reſplendent a flame. Being well acquainted with
                    the mechanical buſineſs of the theatre and the taſte of the times ; poſſeſſed of
                    a knowledge of the characters of men reſembling intuition, an imagination that
                    ranged at large through nature, ſelecting the grand, the ſublime, and the
                    beautiful ; a judicious caution, that diſpoſed him to prefer thoſe plots which
                    had already been found to please ; an uncommon fluency and force of expreſſion ;
                    he was qualified at once to eclipſe all who had gone before him.</p>
                <p>Notwithſtanding the unrivalled genius of Shakeſpeare, moſt of his plots were the
                    invention of others ; which, however, he certainly much improved, if he did not
                    entirely new-model. We are aſſured, that prior to the theatrical compoſitions of
                    Shakeſpeare, dramatic pieces were written on the following ſubjects, viz. King
                    John, King Richard II. and III. King Henry IV. and V. King Henry VIII. King
                    Lear, Antony and Cleopatra, Meaſure for Measure, the Merchant of Venice, the
                    Taming of a Shrew, and the Comedy of Errors.</p>
                <p>Among his patrons, the earl of Southampton is particularly honoured by him, in
                    the dedication of two poems, Venus and <hi rend="italic">A</hi> donis, and
                    Lucrece ; in the latter eſpecially, he expreſſed himſelf in ſuch terms aS gives
                    countenance to what is related of that patron’s diſtinguiſhed generoſity to him.
                    In the beginning of king James I.'s reign (if not ſooner) he was one of the
                    principal managers of the playhouſe, and continued in it ſeveral years
                    afterwards; till, having acquired ſuch a fortune as ſatisfied his moderate
                    wiſhes and views in life, he quitted the ſtage, and all other buſineſs, and
                    paſſed the remainder of his time in an honourable eaſe, at his native town of
                    Stratford, where he lived in a handſome houſe of his own purchaſing, to which he
                    gave the name of <hi rend="italic">New Place ;</hi> and he had the good fortune
                    to save it from the flames in the dreadful fire that conſumed the greateſt part
                    of the town in l614.</p>
                <p>In the beginning of the year 1616, he made his will, wherein he teſtified his
                    reſpect to his quondam partners in the theatre : he appointed his youngeſt
                    daughter, jointly with her huſband, his executors, and bequeathed to them the
                    best part of his eſtate, which they came into the posseſſion of not long after.
                    He died on the 23d of April following, being the 53 d year of his age ; and was
                    interred among his anceſtors on the north side of the chancel, in the great
                    church of Stratford, where there is a handſome monument erected for him,
                    inſcribed with the following elegiac diſtich in Latin :</p>
                <lg>
                    <l><hi rend="italic">Judicio Pylium, genio Socratem, arte Maronem,</hi></l>
                    <l><hi rend="italic">Terra tegit, Populus maeret, Olympus habet.</hi></l>
                </lg>
                <p>In the year 1740, another very noble one was raiſed to his memory, at the public
                    expence, in Weſtminſter-abbey ; an ample contribution for this purpoſe being
                    made upon exhibiting his tragedy of Julius Cæsar, at the theatre-royal in
                    Drury-Lane, April 28th 1738.</p>
                <p>Nor muſt we omit mentioning another teſtimony of the veneration paid to his manes
                    by the public in general, which is, that a mulberry-tree planted upon his eſtate
                    by the hands of this reverend bard, was cut down not many years ago ; and the
                    wood being converted to ſeveral domeſtic uſes, was all eagerly bought at a high
                    price, and each single piece treaſured up by its purchaser as a precious
                    memorial of the planter.</p>
                <p>The character of Shakeſpeare as a dramatic writer has been often drawn, but
                    perhaps never with more accuracy than by the pen of Dr Johnson : “ Shakeſpeare
                    (ſays he) is above all writers, at leaſt above all modern writers, the poet of
                    nature ; the poet that holds up to his readers a faithful mirror of manners and
                    of life.<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0339.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0333"/> His
                    characters are not modified by the cuſtoms of particular places, unpractiſed by
                    the reſt of the world ; by the peculiarities of ſtudies or profeſſions, which
                    can operate but upon ſmall numbers ; or by the accidents of tranſient faſhions
                    or temporary opinions : they are the genuine progeny of common humanity, ſuch as
                    the world will always ſupply, and obſervation will always find. His perſons act
                    and ſpeak by the influence of thoſe general paſſions and principles by which all
                    minds are agitated, and the whole ſyſtem of life is continued in motion. In the
                    writings of other poets, a character is too often an individual ; in thoſe of
                    Shakespeare, it is commonly a ſpecies.</p>
                <p>“ It is from this wide extenſion of deſign that ſo much inſtruction is derived.
                    It is this which fills the plays of Shakeſpeare with practical axioms and
                    domestic wiſdom. It was ſaid of Euripides, that every verſe was a precept ; and
                    it may be ſaid of Shakeſpeare, that from his works may be collected a ſyſtem of
                    civil and economical prudence. Yet his real power is not ſhown in the ſplendor
                    of particular paſſages, but by the progreſs o! his fable, and the tenor of his
                    dialogue ; and he that tries to recommend him by ſelect quotations, will ſucceed
                    like the pedant in Hierocles, who, when he offered his houſe to ſale, carried a
                    brick in his pocket as a ſpecimen.</p>
                <p>“ Upon every other ſtage the univerſal agent is love, by whoſe power all good and
                    evil is diſtributed, and every action quickened or retarded. But love is only
                    one of many paſſions ; and as it has no great influence upon the firm of life,
                    it has little operation in the dramas of a poet who caught his ideas from the
                    living world, and exhibited only what he ſaw before him. He knew that any other
                    paſſion, as it was regular or exorbitant, was a cauſe of happiness or
                    calamity.</p>
                <p>“ Characters thus ample and general were not eaſily diſcriminated and pieſerved ;
                    yet perhaps no poet ever kept his perſonagcs more diſtinct from each other.</p>
                <p>“ Other dramatiſts can only gain attention by hyperbolical or aggravated
                    characters, by fabulous and unexampled excellence or depravity, as the writers
                    of barbarous romances invigorated the reader by a giant and a dwarf; and he that
                    ſhould form his expectations of human affairs from the play, or from the tale,
                    would be equally deceived. Shakeſpeare has no heroes, his ſcenes are occupied
                    only by men, who act and ſpeak as the reader thinks that he ſhould himſelf have
                    ſpoken or acted on the ſame occasion : Even where the agency is ſupernatural,
                    the dialogue is level with life. Other writers diſguiſe the most natural
                    paſſions and most frequent incidents ; ſo that he who contemplates them in the
                    book will not know them in the world : Shakeſpeare approximates the remote, and
                    familiarizes the wonderful ; the event which he represents will not happen, but
                    if it were poſſible, its effects would probably be ſuch as he has aſſigned ; and
                    it may be ſaid, that he has net only ſhown human nature as it acts in real
                    exigencies, but as it would.be found in trials to which it cannot be
                    expoſed.</p>
                <p>“ This therefore is the praiſe of Shakeſpeare, that his drama is the mirror of
                    life ; that he who has mazed his imagination, in following the phantoms which
                    other writers raiſe up before him, may here be cured of his delirious ecstasies,
                    by reading human ſentiments in human language ; by scenes from which a hermit
                    may estimate the transactions of the world, and a confeſſor predict the progreſs
                    of the paſſions.”</p>
                <p>The learning of Shakeſpeare has frequently been a ſubject of inquiry. That he
                    posseſſed much claſſical knowledge does not appear, yet he was certainly
                    acquainted with the Latin poets, particularly with Terence, as Colman has juſtly
                    remarked, which appears from his uſing the word <hi rend="italic"
                        >thraſonical.</hi> Nor was he unacquainted with French and Italian. We are
                    indeed told, that the paſſages in which theſe languages occur might be
                    impertinent additions of the players ; but is it probable, that any of the
                    players ſo far ſurpaſſed Shakeſpeare ?</p>
                <p>That much knowledge is ſcattered over his works is very juſtly obſerved by Pope ;
                    but it is often ſuch knowledge as books did not supply. “ There is, however,
                    proof enough (ſays Dr Johnſon) that he was a very diligent reader ; nor was our
                    language then so indigent of books, but that he might very liberally indulge his
                    curioſity without excurſion into foreign literature. Many of the Roman authors
                    were tranſlated, and ſome of the Greek ; the Reformation had filled the kingdom
                    with theological learning ; most of the topics of human diſquiſition had found
                    Engliſh writers ; and poetry had been cultivated, not only with diligence, but
                    ſucceſs. This was a flock of knowledge sufficient for a mind ſo capable of
                    appropriating and improving it.”</p>
                <p>The works of Shakeſpeare conſiſt of 35 dramatic pieces. The following is the
                    chronological order which Mr Malone has endeavoured to eſtablish, alter a minute
                    inveſtigation, in which he has in general been ſucceſsful :</p>

                <p>The three firſt of theſe, Mr Malone thinks, there is very ſtrong reaſon to
                    believe are not the original productions of Shakeſpeare ; but that he probably
                    altered them, and added ſome new scenes.</p>
                <p>In the firſt folio edition in 1623, theſe plays were entitled “ Mr William
                    Shakeſpeare’s Comedies, Hiſtories, and Tragedies.” They have been publiſhed by
                    various editors. The firſt folio edition by Iſaac Jaggard and Edward Blount ;
                    the ſecond, folio, 1632, by Thomas Cotes for Robert Allot ; the third, 1664, for
                    P, C. ; the fourth, 1685, for H. Herringman, E, Brewſter, and R. Bentley. Rowe
                    publiſhed an 8vo edition in 1709, in 7 vols, and a 12mo edition in 1714, in O
                    vols ; for which he received L. 36, 10s. Pope publiſhed a 4to edition in 1725,
                    in 6 vols, and a 12mo in 1728, in 10 vols; for which he was paid L. 217, 128.
                    Theobald gave a new edition in 8vo in 1733, in 7 vols, another in 12mo in 1740,
                    in 8 vols; and received for his labour L. 652, 10s. Sir Thomas Hanmer publiſhed
                    an edition in 1744, in 6 vols 4to. Dr Warburton’s 8vo edition came out in 1747,
                    in 8 vole ; for which he was paid L. 560. The editions publiſhed ſince that
                    time, are Dr Johnſon’s in 1765, in 8 vols 8vo. Stevens’s in 1766, in 4 vols 8vo.
                    Capell’s in 1768, in 10 vols, crown 8vo ; for this the author was paid L. 300. A
                    ſecond edition of Hanmer’s in 1771, 6 vols. Johnſon’s and Stevens’s in 1773, in
                    10 vols 8vo ; a ſecond edition in 1778; a third by Reed in 1785 ; and Malone’s
                    crown 8vo edition in 1789, in 10 vols.</p>
                <p>The moſt authentic of the old editions is that of 1623. “ At laſt (says Dr
                    Johnſen) an edition was undertaken by Rowe ; not becauſe a poet was to be
                    publiſhed by a poet, for Rowe ſeems to have thought very little on correction or
                    explanation, but that our author’s works might appear like thoſe of his
                    fraternity, with the appendages of a life and recommendatory preface. Rowe has
                    been clamorouſly blamed for not performing what he did not undertake, and it is
                    time that juſtice be done him, by confeſſing, that though he ſeems to have had
                    no thought of corruption beyond the printer’s errors, yet he has made many
                    emendations, if they were not made before, which his ſucceſſors have received
                    without acknowledgment, and which, if they had produced them, would have filled
                    pages with cεm ſures of the ſtupidity by which the faults were committed, with
                    diſplays of the abſurdities which they involved, with oſtentatious expoſitions
                    of the new reading, and ſelf-congratulations on the happineſs of diſcovering
                    it.”</p>
                <p>The nation had been for many years content enough with Mr Rowe’s performance,
                    when Mr Pope made them acquainted with the true ſtate of Shakeſpeare’s text,
                    ſhowed that it was extremely corrupt, and gave reaſon to hope that there were
                    means of reforming it, Mr Rope’s edition, however, he obſerves, fell below his
                    own expectations ; and he was ſo much offended, when he was found to have left
                    any thing for others to do, that he paſſed the latter part of his life in a
                    ſtate of hoſtility with verbal criticiſm.</p>
                <p>The only talk, in the opinion of Mr Malone, for which Rope was eminently and
                    indiſputably qualified, was to mark the faults and beauties of his author. When
                    he undertook the office of a commentator, every anomaly of language, and every
                    expreſſion that was currently in uſe, were considered as errors or corruptions,
                    and the text was altered or amended, as it was called, at pleaſure. Pope is
                    openly charged with being one of the great corrupters of Shakeſpeare’s text.</p>
                <p>Pope was ſucceeded by Theobald, who collated the ancient copies, and rectified
                    many errors. He was however, a man of narrow comprehension and of little
                    learning, and what is worſe, in his reports of copies and editions, he is not to
                    be truſted without examination. From the liberties taken by Pope, the edition of
                    Theobald was juſtly preferred, becauſe he profeſſed to adhere to the ancient
                    copies more ſtrictly, and illuſtrated a few paſſages by extracts from the
                    writers of our poet’s age, Still, however, he was a conſiderable innovator ; and
                    while a few arbitrary changes made by Pope were detected, innumerable
                    sophiſtications were ſilently adopted.</p>
                <p>Sir Thomas Hanmer, who comes next, was a man of critical abilities, and of
                    extensive learning. His corrections are commonly just, but ſometimes capricious.
                    He is cenſurable, too, for receiving without examination almoſt all the
                    innovations of Pope.</p>
                <p>The original and predominant error of Warburton’s commentary, is acquieſcence in
                    his firſt thoughts ; that precipitation which is produced by conſciouſneſs of
                    quick diſcernment ; and that confidence which preſumes to do, by ſurveying the
                    ſurface, what labour only can perform, by penetrating to the bottom. His notes
                    exhibit ſometimes perverſe interpretations, and ſometimes improbable conjectures
                    ; he at one time gives the author more profundity of meaning than the ſentence
                    admits, and at another discovers abſurdities where the ſenſe is plain to every
                    other reader. Rut his emendations are likewiſe often happy and just; and his
                    interpretation of obſcure paſſages learned and ſagacious.</p>
                <p>It has indeed been ſaid by his defenders, that his great object was to diſplay
                    his own learning ; and certainly, in ſpite of the clamour raiſed againſt him for
                    ſubſtituting his own chimerical conceits inſtead of the genuine text of
                    Shakeſpeare, his work increaſed his reputation. But as it is of little value as
                    a commentary on Shakeſpeare, since Warburton is now gone, his work will probably
                    ſoon sink into oblivion,</p>
                <p>In 1765 Dr Johnſon’s edition, which had long been impatiently expected, was given
                    to the public. His vigorous and comprehensive underſtanding threw more light on
                    his author than all his predecessors had dope, The character which he gave of
                    each play is generally just. His refutation of the falſe gloſſes of Theobald and
                    Warburton, and his numerous explications of involved and difficult paſſages,
                    entitle him to the gratitude of every admirer of Shakeſpeare,</p>
                <p>The laſt editor is Mr Malone, who was eight years employed in preparing his
                    edition, By collating the moſt authentic copies, he has been careſul to purify
                    the text. He has been ſo induſtrious, in order to diſcover the meaning of the
                    author, that he has ranſacked many volumes, and truſts that, besides his
                    additional illuſtrations, not a single valuable explication of any obſcure
                    paſſage in theſe plays has ever appeared, which he has not inſerted in his
                    edition. He rejects Titus Andronicus, as well as the three plays formerly
                    mentioned, as<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0341.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0335"/>
                    not being the authentic productions of Shakeſpeare. To the whole he has added an
                    appendix, and a copious gloſſary.—Of this work a leſs expenſive edition has been
                    publiſhed in 7 vols 12mo, in which the general introductory obſervations
                    prefixed to the different plays are preſerved, and the numerous notes
                    abridged.</p>
                <p>This judicious commentator has certainly done more for the elucidation and
                    correction of Shakeſpeare than all who came before him, and has followed with
                    indefatigable patience the only road which a commentator of Shakeſpeare ought to
                    obſerve.</p>
                <p>Within 50 years alter our poet’s death, Dryden says that he was become “ a little
                    obſolete ;” and in the beginning of the preſent century Lord Shafteſbury
                    complains of his rude unpoliſhed ſtyle, and his antiquated phraſe and wit. These
                    complaints were owing to the great revolution which the Engliſh language has
                    undergone, and to the want of an enlightened commentator. Theſe complaints are
                    now removed, for an enlightened commentator has beep found in Mr Malone.</p>
                <p>We have only farther to add, that in the year 1790 a copious index to the
                    remarkable paſſages and words in the plays of Shakeſpeare was publiſhed by the
                    Reverend Mr Ayſcough ; a gentleman to whom the literary world is much indebted
                    for ſeveral very valuable keys of knowledge. In fine, the admirers of
                    Shakeſpeare are now, by the labours of ſeveral eminent men, furniſhed with every
                    help that can enable them to underſtand the ſenſe and to taſte the beauties of
                    this illuſtrious poet.</p>
