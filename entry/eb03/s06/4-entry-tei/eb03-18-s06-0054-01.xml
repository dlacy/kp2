(anc. geog.), a town of Africa, in the dominions of Carthage ; probably ſo called ſrom Suffetes, the title of the magiſtrates of that city. It is now called <hi rend="italic">Spaitla,</hi> in the kingdom of Tunis, and has many elegant remains of antiquity. There are three temples in a great meaſure entire ; one of them of the Compoſite order, the other two Corinthian. “ A beautiful and perfect capital of the Compoſite order (says Mr Bruce), the only perfect one that now exiſts, is deſigned in all its parts in a very large ſize ; and with the detail of the rest of the ruin, is a precious monument of what that order was, now in the collection of the king.” The town itſelf (he says) is situated in the moſt beautiful ſpot in Barbary, ſurrounded by great numbers of juniper-trees, and watered by a pleaſant ſtream, which ſinks under the earth at that place, without appearing any more.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
