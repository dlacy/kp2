In consequence of this discussion, several of bis Dissertations on the Resistance of Air were read, and the experiments exhibited before the Royal Society, for which he was presented by that honourable body with a gold medal.</p><p>In 1748 appeared Lord Anson’s Voyage round the World, which, though Mr Walter’s name is in the title, has been generally thought to be the work of Robins. Walter, chaplain on board the Centurion, had brought it down to his departure from Macao for England, when he proposed to print the work by subscription. It was however, it is said, thought proper that an able judge should review and correct it, and Robins was appointed ; when, upon examination, it was resolved that the whole should be written by Robins, and that Walter’s papers should only serve as materials. Hence the introduction entire, and many dissertations in the body of the work, it is said, were composed by him, without receiving the least assistance from Walter’s manuscript, which chiefly related to the wind and the weather, the currents, courses, bearings, distances, the qualities of the ground on which they anchored, and such particulars as generally fill up a sailor’s account. No production of this kind ever met with a more favourable reception : four large impressions were sold within a twelvemonth ; and it has been translated into most of the languages of Europe. The fifth edition, prilled at London in 1749, was revised and corrected by Robins himself. In the corrigenda and addenda to the first volume of the Biographia Britannica, printed in the beginning of the fourth volume of that work, it is however stated that Robins was only consulted with respect to the disposition of the drawings, and that he had left England before the book was printed. Whether this be the fact, as it is asserted to be by the widow of Mr Walter, it is not for us to determine.</p><p>Robins was soon afterwards desired to compose an apology for the unfortunate affair at Prestonpans. It was prefixed as a preface to “ The Report of the Proceedings of the Board of General Officers on their Examination into the conduct of Lieutenant-General Sir John Cope ;” and this preface was esteemed a masterpiece in its kind. He afterwards, through the interest of Lord Anson, contributed to the improvements made in the Royal Observatory at Greenwich. Having thus established his reputation, he was offered the choice of two considerable employments ; either to go to Paris as one of the commissaries for adjusting the limits of Acadia, or to be engineer-general to the East India Company. He chose the latter, and arrived in the East Indies in 1750 ; but the climate not agreeing with his constitution, he died there the year following.</p><p>ROBINSON, Sir Richard, Lord Rokeby and archbishop of Armagh, was immediately descended from the Robinsons of Rokeby in the north riding of the county of York, and was born in 1709. He was educated at Westminster school, from whence he was elected to Christ Church, Oxford, in 1726. In 1783 he took the degree of A. M., and in 1748 that of D. D. Dr Blackburne, archbishop of York, appointed him his chaplain, and collated him first to the rectory of Elton in the east riding of Yorkshire, and next to the prebend of Grindall in the cathedral of York. In 1751, he attended the duke of Dorset, lord-lieutenant of Ireland, to that kingdom, as his first chaplain, and the same year was promoted to the bishopric of Killala. A family connection with the earl of Holdernesse, secretary of state, with the earl of Sandwich and other noblemen related to him, opened the fairest prospects of attaining to the first dignity in the Irish church. Accordingly, in 1759 he was translated to the united sees of Leighlin and Ferns, and in 1761 to Kildare. The duke of Northumberland being appointed to the lieutenancy of Ireland in 1765, he was advanced to the primacy of Armagh, made lord-almoner, and vice-chancellor of the university of Dublin. When Lord Harcourt was lord-lieutenant of Ireland in 1777, the king was pleased, by privy seal at St James’s, February 6th, and by patent at Dublin,the 26th of the same month, to create him Baron Rokeby of Armagh, with remainder to Matthew Robinson of West Layton, Esq.; and in 1783 he was appointed prelate of the most illustrious order of St Patrick. On the death of the duke of Rutland, lord-lieutenant of Ireland, in 1787, he was nominated one of the lords-justices of that kingdom. Sir William Robinson, his brother, dying in 1785, the primate succeeded to the title of baronet. He was the survivor in the direct male line of the Robinsons of Rokeby, being the eighth in descent from William of Kendal. His grace died at Clifton near Bristol in the end of October 1794.</p><p>ROBISON, John, a distinguished professor of natural philosophy, born in 1739 at Boghall, in the parish of Bal-dernock and county of Stirling, was a younger son of John Robison, Esq. who had formerly been a merchant at Glasgow, and had retired to live in considerable affluence on bis estate at Boghall, not far from that city.</p><p>He was of a family sufficiently respectable to enable his son at a subsequent period to prove himself, to the satisfaction of the court of St Petersburg, a <hi rend="italic">gentleman</hi>  born. As a younger brother, that son was originally intended for the church, and went at an early age, according to the custom of Scotland, in 1750, to enter as a student in the university of Glasgow, so that he was initiated almost in the rudimente of Grecian literature under the able instruction of Dr Moor, the well-known professor of Greek ; and he acquired such a knowledge of the classical languages as served to constitute him a correct scholar through life. He pursued his studies with so much attention as to obtain the approbation of his teachers and the admiration of his contemporaries, who were delighted with the originality and ingenuity of his conversation, though he did not himself reflect with perfect satisfaction upon the degree of application which he had exerted in his academical education. He took the degree of Master of Arts in 1756, having studied mathematics under Dr Robert Simson, and moral philosophy under Dr Adam Smith. The example of so correct and rigid a follower of the ancient methods of demonstration as Dr Simson, must unquestionably have exercised considerable influence on his yet unformed taste in mathematics ; but he seems to have had a natural preference, either from the constitution of his mind, or from some previously acquired habits of thinking, for the geometrical method ; for we are informed that “ he first attracted the regard of Dr Simson by owning his dislike of algebra, and by returning a neat geometrical solution of a problem which had been given out to the class in an algebraical form : with this mode of solution the professor was delighted, though the pupil candidly acknowledged that it had been adopted only because he could not solve the problem in the manner required of the class.”</p><p>In the course of his studies, he had imbibed an insuperable aversion to the pursuit of his original objects in the church ; not certainly from any want of religious feeling, or from a dislike to the kind of life that was intended for him, but probably from some difficulties that had occurred to him respecting particular points of doctrine or of practice. He was therefore compelled to provide himself with some other occupation ; and he readily accepted the offer of some of his friends in 1758, to recommend him to Dr Blair, a prebendary of Westminster, who had formed a scheme for sending Prince Edward, the young duke of York, to complete his professional education at sea, in com</p><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
