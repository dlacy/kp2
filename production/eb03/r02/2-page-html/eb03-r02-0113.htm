<p><span class="font0">ſtate of inactivity as his predeceſſor, until he received certain intelligence that the Veientes and Fidenates had .reſolved to deſtroy both Romans and Albans when they ſhould be weakened by a battle. Fuffetius then reſolved to come to an accommodation with&nbsp;the Romans ; and, having obtained a conference with&nbsp;Tullus, both ſeemed equally deſirous of avoiding the&nbsp;calamities of war. But, in order to eſtabliſh the peace&nbsp;on the moſt perfect foundation, Tullus propoſed that&nbsp;all, or at leaſt the chief families in Alba, ſhould remove to Rome ; or, in caſe they were unwilling to&nbsp;leave their native city, that one common council ſhould&nbsp;be eſtabliſhed to govern both cities, under the direction of one of the two ſovereigns. Fuffetius took aſide&nbsp;thoſe who attended him, to conſult with them about&nbsp;this piopoſal; but they, though willing to come to&nbsp;an accommodation with Rome, abſolutely refuſed to&nbsp;leave Alba. The only difficulty remaining, then, was&nbsp;to ſettle which city ſhould have the ſuperiority ; and,&nbsp;as this could not be determined by argument, Tullus&nbsp;propoſed to determine it by ſingle combat betwixt&nbsp;himſelf and Fuffetius. This propoſal, however, the Alban general thought proper to decline ; and it was at&nbsp;laſt agreed, that three champions ſhould be choſen out&nbsp;of each camp to decide the difference. This produced&nbsp;the famous combat between the Horatii and Curiatii,&nbsp;by which the ſovereignty was decided in favour of Rome.&nbsp;See Horatii.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Tullus now reſolved to call the Fidenates to an account for their treacherous behaviour during the war with Alba, and therefore cited them to appear before&nbsp;the ſenate ; but they, conſcious of their guilt, refuſed&nbsp;to appear, and took up arms in conjunction with the&nbsp;Veientes. Fuffetius, in obedience to the orders of&nbsp;Tullus, joined him with the Alban troops ; but the&nbsp;day before the battle, he acquainted the principal&nbsp;officers with his deſign, which was to ſtand neuter till&nbsp;fortune had declared ſor one ſide, and then to join&nbsp;with the conqueror. 'Γhis deſign being approved,&nbsp;Fuffetius, during the engagement, retired with his forces&nbsp;to a neighbouring eminence. Tullus perceived his&nbsp;treachery ; but diſſembling his uneaſineſs, told his men&nbsp;that Fuffetius had poſſeſſed himſelf of that hill by his&nbsp;order, and that he was from thence to ruſh down upon&nbsp;the enemy. The Veientes, in the mean time, who&nbsp;had expected that Fuffetius was to join them, were&nbsp;diſmayed, and the Romans obtained the victory. After&nbsp;the battle, Tullus returned privately to Rome in the&nbsp;night ; and having conſulted with the ſenate about the&nbsp;treachery of Fuffetius, returned to the camp by break&nbsp;of day. He then detached Horatius, who had conquered the three Curiatii, with a choſen body of horſe&nbsp;and foot, to demoliſh Alba, as had been concerted at</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rome. In the mean time, he commanded both the Roman and Alban troops to attend him unarmed, but&nbsp;gave private orders to the Romans to bring their ſwords&nbsp;concealed under their garments. When they were aſſembled, he laid open the treachery. of Fuffetius» and&nbsp;ordered him to be torn in pieces by horſes. His accomplices were all put to the ſword.;. and the inhabitants of Alba carried to Rome, where they were admitted to the privileges of citizens, andTυme of them&nbsp;even admitted to the ſenate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Tullus now turned his arms againſt Fidenæ, which lie again reduced under the Roman yoke ; and took</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">Medulia, a ſtrong city of the Latins ; after which he waged a ſucceſsful war with the Sabines, whoſe union&nbsp;with the Romans ſeems to have ceaſed with the time of&nbsp;Numa. This was the laſt of his martial exploits ; after which we hear no more of him, but that he became extremely ſuperſtitious in his advanced years,&nbsp;giving ear to many fooliſh ſtories, as that it rained&nbsp;ſtones, that miraculous voices were heard from heaven,&nbsp;&amp;c. and for this he appointed nine days expiatory&nbsp;ſacrifices ; whenoe it became a cuſtom to appoint nine&nbsp;days to appeaſe the wrath of the gods as often as men&nbsp;were alarmed with prodigies. As to the manner of&nbsp;his death authors are not agreed. Some tell us that&nbsp;he was killed by lightning, together with his wife,&nbsp;children, and his whole family ; while others, are of&nbsp;opinion that he was murdered with his wife and children by Ancus Martius who ſucceeded him. He died&nbsp;after a reign of 33 years, leaving the city greatly increaſed, but the dominions much the ſame as they had&nbsp;been in the time of Romulus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">After a ſhort interregnum, Ancus Martius, the grandſon of Numa by his daughter Pompilia, and&nbsp;Marcus his relation, was unanimouſiy choſen by the&nbsp;people and ſenate. Though naturally inclined to war,&nbsp;he began his reign with attempting to reſtore the&nbsp;ceremonies of Numa, which had been neglected under&nbsp;Tullus Hoſtilius. He endeavoured alſo to draw the&nbsp;attention of his people to huſhandry and the peaceful&nbsp;arts ; adviſing them to lay aſide all ſorts of violence,&nbsp;and to return to their former employments. This&nbsp;gained him the affections of his ſubjects, but brought&nbsp;upon him the contempt of the neighbouring nations.&nbsp;The Latins, pretending that their treaty with Rome&nbsp;was expired, made inroads into the.Roman territories.&nbsp;Ancus, after uſing the ceremonies directed by Numa,&nbsp;took the field with an army conſiſting entirely of- new&nbsp;levied troops, and reduced the cities of Politorium, Tille-na, and Ficana, tranſplanting the inhabitants to Rome.&nbsp;A new colony of Latins repeopled Politorium ; but&nbsp;Ancus retook the place next year, and entirely demυ-liſhed it. Hc then laid ſiege to Medulia ; which,&nbsp;though it had been ruined by Tullus Hoſtilius, was&nbsp;now ſtronger than ever. It ſubmitted.after a ſiege ot&nbsp;four years, when Ancus found himſelf obliged to undertake a ſecond expedition againſt Ficana, which he&nbsp;had before reduced, as we have already related ; and&nbsp;it was not without the utmoſt difficulty that he reduced it a ſecond time. After this he defeated the&nbsp;Latins in a pitched battle ; vanquiſhed the Fidenates,&nbsp;Veientes, and Sabines ; and having taken in the hill&nbsp;Janiculum to he included within the walls, and built the&nbsp;port of Gſtia, he died in the 24th year of his reign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Ancus Martius left two ſons behind him, one an infant, and the other about 15 years of age. Both&nbsp;of theſe he put under the tuition of Tarquin, the ſon of&nbsp;a rich merchant in Corinth,, who had fled from that city&nbsp;to ſecure his wealth ſrom Cypſelus tyrant of the place.&nbsp;He ſettled in Tarquinii, one of the principal cities in&nbsp;Hetruria ; but finding that he could not there attain&nbsp;to any of the principal polls in the city on account of his&nbsp;foreign extraction, he removed to Rome, where be&nbsp;had been gradually raiſed to the rank of patrician and&nbsp;ſenator. The death of Ancus Martins gave him an&nbsp;opportunity of afliιming the regal dignity, and ſetting&nbsp;aſide h.s pupils and in the beginning of his reign he</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
