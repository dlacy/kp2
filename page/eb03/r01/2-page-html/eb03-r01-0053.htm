<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">alI </span><span class="font3">its </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">tones. But from what was faid above, of the </span><span class="font3">difference between reading and ſpeaking, it follows,&nbsp;that theſe ſigns of the emotions ihould be leſs ftrongly&nbsp;characteriſed in the former article than in the latter.&nbsp;Again, as ſeveral of tlieſe tones of expreſſion are in&nbsp;themſelves agreeable to the mind, and raiſe in us agree-able emotions (as thoſe of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">pity, benevolence,</span><span class="font3"> or whatever&nbsp;indicates </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">happineſs,</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">goodnefs</span><span class="font3"> of heart), and others&nbsp;diſagreeable (as thoſe of a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">boiflerous, malevolent,</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">depraved</span><span class="font3"> nature, &amp;c.) it farther appears, ſince reading is&nbsp;an art </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">improving</span><span class="font3"> and not </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">imitating</span><span class="font3"> nature, that, in what-ever degree we abate the expreſſions of the tones above&nbsp;alluded to in the ſirſt caſe, it would be eligible to make&nbsp;a greater abatement in the latter. But as to the&nbsp;quantities and proportional magnitudes of theſe abate-ments, they, like many other particulars of the ſame&nbsp;nature, muſt be left ſolely to the taſte and judgment of&nbsp;the reader.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To add one more remark, which may be of ſervice on more accounts than in ſuggeſting another reaſon for&nbsp;the doctrine above. Let it be remembered, that tho’&nbsp;in order to acquit himſelf agreeably in this article of&nbsp;expreſſion, it will be neceffary every reader ihould </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">feel&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">his ſubject as well as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">underjland</span><span class="font3"> it ; yet, that he may&nbsp;preſerve a proper eaſe and mafterlineſs of delivery, it is&nbsp;alſo neceffary he ſſiould guard againft diſcovering too&nbsp;much emotion and perturbation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">From this reaſoning we deduce the following rule, for the tones which indicate the paſſions and emotions*</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&quot; In reading, let all your tones of expreſſion be bor-rowed from thoſe of common ſpeech, but ſomething more faintly characteriſed. Let thoſe tones which ſignify any diſagreeable paſſion of the mind, be ſtill more&nbsp;faint than thoſe which indicate their contrary ; and pre-ſerve yourſelf ſo far from being affected with the fub-ject, as to be able to proceed through it with that peculiar kind of eaſe and maſterlinefs, which has its charms&nbsp;in this as well as every other art.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">we ſſiall conclude this ſection with the following ob-ſervation, which relates to ſpeaking as well as reading, when words fall in our way, whoſe &quot; founds ſeem an&nbsp;echo to the ſenſe,” as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ſquirr, buzz, hum, rattle, hfs,jar,&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">&amp;c. we ought not to pronounce them in ſuch a manner&nbsp;as to heighten the imitation, except in light and ludicrous ſubjects. For inftance, they ſſiould not in any&nbsp;other caſe be founded </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ſquir.r.r—buzz.z.z—hum.m.m—&nbsp;r.r.rattle,</span><span class="font3"> &amp;c. Οη the contrary, when the imitation&nbsp;lies in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">movement,</span><span class="font3"> or</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">flow andflrufiure of a whole paſſage</span><span class="font3"> (which frequently happens in poetry), the delivery&nbsp;may always be allowed to give a heightening to it with&nbsp;the greateſt propriety ; as in the following inſtances, out&nbsp;of a number more which every experienced reader will&nbsp;.quickly recollect.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">2. Beſides the particular tones and modifications of voice above deſcribed, which always accompany and&nbsp;expreſs our inward agitations, nature has in theſe caſes&nbsp;endowed us with another language, which, inſtead of&nbsp;the ear, addreffes itſelf to the eye, thereby giving the&nbsp;communications of the heart a double advantage over&nbsp;thofe of the underſtanding, and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">us</span><span class="font3"> a double chance to&nbsp;preſerve fo ineſtirnable a bleſſing. This language is&nbsp;what ariſes from the different, almoſt involuntary&nbsp;movements and configurations of the face and body&nbsp;in our emotions and paſſions, and which, like that' of&nbsp;tones, every one is formed to underſtand by a kind of&nbsp;intuition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">when men are in any violent agitation of mind, this co-operating </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">expreſfion</span><span class="font3"> (as it is called) of face and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">geſture</span><span class="font3"> is very ſtrongly marked, and totally free from the&nbsp;mixture of any thing which has a regard to gracefulnefs, or what appearance they may make in the eyes of&nbsp;others. But in ordinary converſation, and where the&nbsp;emotions are not fo warm, faſſiionable people are perpe-tually infinuatſhg, into their countenance and action,&nbsp;whatever they imagine will add to the eaſe and elegance&nbsp;of their deportment, or impreſs on the ſpectator an idea&nbsp;of their amiableneſs and breeding. Now, though the&nbsp;above-mentioned natural organical figns of the emotions&nbsp;ſhould accompany every thing fpoken, yet from what&nbsp;was obſerved in the introductory part of this article&nbsp;(like the tones we have juſt-treated upon), they ſhould&nbsp;in reading he much leſs ſtrongly expreffed, and thoſe&nbsp;fuffer the greateſt diminution that are in themfeives the&nbsp;moſt ungainly. And as it was in the laſt ſection re-commended tβ the reader to preſerve himſelf as far from&nbsp;being affected in all paſſionate ſubjects as to be able to&nbsp;keep a temperate command over the various affections&nbsp;oſ the voice, &amp;c. fo under the ſanction </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font3">this ſubor-dinate feeling he may accompany his delivery more frequently with any eaſy action or change of face, which&nbsp;will contribute to ſet off his manner, and make it agree-able on the principles of art.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As theſe calm decorations oſ action (as we may call them) are not altogether natural, but have their rife&nbsp;ſrom a kind of inttitution, they muſt be modelled by&nbsp;the practices of the polite. And though mankind differ from one another ſcarce more in any particular than&nbsp;in that of talents for adopting the graceful actions of&nbsp;the body, and hence nothing determinate can be ſaid&nbsp;of their nature and frequency, yet even thoſe, moſt&nbsp;happily calculated to acquit themfelves well in their&nbsp;uſe, might profit by confidering that it is better greatly&nbsp;to abridge the diſplay, than to over-do it ever fo little;&nbsp;For the peculiar modeſty of deportment with which&nbsp;the inhabitants of this kingdom are endowed, makes&nbsp;us in common endeavour to ſuppreſs many figns of an&nbsp;agitated mind ; and in ſuch caſes the bodily ones in par-tic ular are very ſparingly uſed. we have alfo a natural&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">and rooted </span><span class="font3">diſlike to any kind of affectation ; and to no</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
