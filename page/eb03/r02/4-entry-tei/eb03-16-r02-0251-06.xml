                <p><label>RIVER</label>
              </p>                <p>is a current of ſreſh water, flowing in a Bed or Channel from its ſource to the
                    ſea.</p>
                <p>The term is appropriated to a <hi rend="italic">conſiderable</hi> collection
                    of waters, formed by the conflux of two or more Baooκs, which deliver into its
                    channel the united ſtreams of ſeveral Rivulets, which have collected the
                    ſupplies of many Rills trickling down from number-leſs ſprings, and the torrents
                    which carry off from the ſloping grounds the ſurplus of every ſhower.</p>
                <p>Rivers form one of the chief features of the ſurface of this globe, ſerving as
                    voiders of all that is immediately redundant in our rains and ſprings, and alſo
                    as boundaries and barriers, and even as highways, and in many countries as
                    plentiful ſtorehouſes. They alſo fertiliſe our foil by laying upon our warm
                    fields the richeſt mould, brought from the high mountains, where it would have
                    remained uſeleſs for want of genial heat.</p>
                <p>Being ſuch intereſting objects of attention, every branch acquires a proper
                    name, and the whole acquires a ſort of perſonal identity, of which it is
                    frequently difficult to find the principle ; for the name of the great body of
                    waters which diſcharges itſelf into the ſea is traced backwards to one of the
                    ſources, while all the contributing ſtreams are loſt, although their waters form
                    the chief part of the collection. And ſometimes the feeder in which the name is
                    preſerved is ſmall-er than others which are united to the current, and which
                    like a rich but ignoble alliance loſe their name in that of the more illuſtrious
                    family. Some rivers indeed are reſpectable even at their birth, coming at once
                    in force from ſome great lake. Such is the Rio de la Plata, the river St
                    Laurence, and the mighty ſtreams which iſſue in all directions from the Baical
                    lake. But, like the ſons of Adam, they are all of equal deſcent, and ſhould take
                    their name from one of the feeders of theſe lakes. This is indeed the caſe with
                    a few, ſuch as the Rhone, the Rhine, the Nile. Theſe, after having mixed their
                    waters with thoſe of the lake, reſume their appearance and their name at its
                    outſet.</p>
                <p>But in general their origin and progreſs, and even the features of their
                    character, bear ſome reſemblance (as has been prettily obſerved by Pliny) to the
                    life of man. The river ſprings ſrom the earth ; but its origin is in heaven. Its
                    beginnings are inſigniſicant, and its infancy is frivolous ; it plays among the
                    flowers of a meadow ; it waters a garden, or turns a little mill. Gathering
                    ſtrength in its youth, it becomes wild and impetuous. Impatient of the
                    reſtraints which it ſtill meets with in the hollows among the mountains, it is
                    reſtleſs and fretful ; quick in its turnings, and unſteady in its courfe. Now it
                    is a roaring cataract, tearing up and overturning whatever oppoſes its progreſs,
                    and it ſhoots headlong down from a rock ; then it becomes a ſullen and gloomy
                    pool, buried in the bottom of a glin. Recovering breath by repoſe, ſt again
                    daſhes along, till tired of the uproar and miſchief, ſt quits all that it has
                    ſwept along, and leaves the opening of the valley ſtrewed with the rejected
                    waſte. Now, quitting its retirement, it comes abroad into the world, journeying
                    with more prudence and diforetion through cultivated fields, yielding to
                    circumſtances, and winding round what would trouble it to overwhelm or remove.
                    It paſſes through the populous cities and ail the buſy haunts of man, tendering
                    its ſervices on every ſide, and becomes the ſupport and ornament of the country.
                    Now increaſed by numerous alliances, and advanced</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0252" facs="gri_33125011196389_0258.tif"/>
                <p>in its courſe of exiſtence, it becomes grave and ſtately in its motions, loves
                    peace and quiet ; and in majeſtic ſilence rolls on its mighty waters, till it is
                    laid to reſt in the vaſt abyſs.</p>
                <p>The philoſopher, the real lover of wiſdom, ſees much to admire in the economy
                    and mechaniſm of running waters ; and there are few operations of nature which
                    give him more opportunities of remarking the nice ad-juſtment of the moſt Ample
                    means for attaining many purpoſes of moſt extenſive beneficence. All mankind
                    ſeem to have felt this. The heart of man is ever open (unleſs perverted by the
                    habits of ſelſiſh indulgence and arrogant ſelf∙conceit) to impreſſions of
                    gratitude and love. He who aſcribes the religious principle (debated, though it
                    be by the humbling abuſes of fu-perſtition) to the workings of fear alone, may
                    betray the ſlaviſh meanneſs of his own mind, but gives a very unfair and a falſe
                    picture of the hearts of his neighbours. Lucretius was but half a philoſopher
                    when he penned his often-quoted apophthegm. Indeed his own invocations ſhow how
                    much the animal was blended with the ſage.</p>
                <p>We apprehend, that whoever will read with an ho-neſt and candid mind, unbiaſſed
                    by licentious wiſhes, the accounts of the ancient ſuperſtitions, will
                    acknowledge that the amiable emotions of the human ſoul have had their ſhare in
                    creating the numerous divinities whoſe worſhip filled up their kalendars. The
                    ſun and the hoſt of heaven have in all ages and nations been the objects of a
                    ſincere worſhip. Next to them, the rivers ſeem to have attracted the grateful
                    acknowledgments of the inhabitants of the adjacent countries. They have
                    everywhere been conſidered as a ſort of tutelar divinities ; and each little
                    diſtrict, every retired valley, had its river god, who was prefer* red to all
                    others with a partial fondneſs. The expoſtu-lation of Naaman the Syrian, who was
                    offended with the prophet for enjoining him to waſh in the river Jordan, was the
                    natural effuſion of this attachment. “What ! (ſaid he), are not Abana and
                    Pharphat, rivers of Da-maſcus, more excellent than all the waters of Judæa ?
                    Might I not waſh in them and be clean ? So he went away wroth.”</p>
                <p>In thoſe countries particularly, where the rural labours, and the hopes of the
                    ſhepherd and the huſhand-man, were not ſo immediately connected with the
                    approach and receſs of the ſun, and depended rather on what happened in a far
                    diſtant country by the falls of periodical rains or the melting of collected
                    ſnows, the Nile, the Ganges, the Indus, the river of Pegu, were the ſenſible
                    agents of nature in procuring to the inhabitants of their fertile banks all
                    their abundance, and they became the objects of grateful veneration. Their
                    ſources were fought out with anxious care even by conquering princes; and when
                    found, were univerſally worſhipped with the moſt affectionate devotion. Theſe
                    remarkable rivers, ſo eminently and ſo palpably beneficent, preſerve to this
                    day, anſidſt every change of habit, and every increaſe of civilization and
                    improvement, the fond adoration of the inhabitants of thoſe fruitful countries
                    through which they hold their ſtately courſe, and their waters are ſtill held
                    ſacred. No progreſs of artificial refinement, not all the corruption of
                    luxurious ſenfoality, has been able to eradicate this plant of native growth
                    from the heart of man. The ſentiment is</p>
                <p>congenial to his nature, and therefore it is universal} and we could almoſt
                    appeal to the feelings of every reader, whether he does not perceive it in his
                    own breaſt. Perhaps we may be miſtaken in our opinion in the caſe of the
                    corrupted inhabitants of the populous and buſy cities, who are habituated to the
                    fond contemplation of their own individual exertions as the ſources of all their
                    hopes. Give the ſhoemaker but leather and a few tools, and he defies the powers
                    of nature to disappoint him ; but the ſimpler inhabitants of the country, the
                    moſt worthy and the moſt reſpectable part of every nation, after equal, perhaps
                    greater exertion both of ſkill and of induſtry, are more accuſtomed to reſign
                    themſelves to the great miniſters of Providence, and to look up to heaven for
                    the “ early and the latter rains,” without which all their labours are
                    fruitleſs.</p>

                <p>And among the huſhandmen and the ſhepherds of alt nations and ages, we find the

                <p>was the mournful ejaculation of poor Meliboeus. We hardly know a river of any
                    note in our own country whoſe ſource is not looked on with ſome reſpect.</p>
                <p>We repeat our affertion, that this worſhip was the offspring of affection and
                    gratitude, and that it is giving a very unfair and falſe picture of the human
                    mind to aſcribe theſe ſuperſtitions to the working of fear alone, Theſe would
                    have repreſented the river-gods as ſeated on ruins, brandiſhing rooted-up trees,
                    with angry looks, pouring out their ſweeping torrents. But no ſuch thing. The
                    lively imagination of the Greeks felt, and expreſſed with an energy unknown to
                    all other nations, every emotion of the human foul. They figured the Naiads as
                    beautiful nymphs, patterns of gentleneſs and of elegance. They are repreſented
                    as partially attached to the children of men; and their interference in human
                    affairs Js always in acts of kind aſſiſtance and protection. They reſemble, in
                    this reſpect, the rural deities of the northern nations, the fairies, but
                    without their caprices and reſentments. And, if we attend to the deſcriptions
                    and repreſentations of their River-Gods, beings armed with power, an attribute
                    which ſlaviſh fear never fails to couple with cruelty and vengeance, we find the
                    ſame expreſſion of affectionate truſt and confidence in their kind diſpoſitions.
                    They are generally called by the reſpectable but endearing name of <hi
                        rend="italic"> father. “ Da Tyberi pater f</hi> ſays Virgil. Mr Bruce ſays
                    that the Nile at its ſource is called the <hi rend="italic">abay</hi> or “
                    father.”—We obſerve this word, or its radix,blended with many names of rivers of
                    the eaſt ; and think it pro* bable that when our traveller got this name from
                    the inhabitants of the neighbourhood, they applied to the ſtream what is meant
                    to expreſs the tutelar or preſi-ding ſpirit. The river-gods are always
                    repreſented as venerable old men, to indicate their being coeval with the world.
                    But it is always a <hi rend="italic">cruda viridiſque feneftus,</hi> and they
                    are never repreſented as oppreſſed with age and decrepitude. Their beards are
                    long and flowing, their looks placid, their attitude eaſy, reclined on a bank,
                    covered, as they are crowned, with never-fading ſedges and bulruſhes, and
                    leaning on their urns, from which they pour out their plentiful and fertilizing
                    ſtreams.</p>

                <p>Mr Bruce's description ofthe ſources of the Nile, and of the reſpect paid to the
                    ſacred waters, has not a frowning feature ; and the hoſpitable old man, with his
                    fair daughter Irepone, and the gentle prieſthood which peopled the little
                    village of Geeſh, forms a contrait with the neighbouring Galla (among whom a
                    military leader was called the <hi rend="italic">lamb,</hi> becauſe he did not
                    murder pregnant women), which very diſtinctly paints the inſpiring principle of
                    this ſuperſtition. Pliny ſays (VIII. 8.) that at the ſource of the Clitumnus
                    there is an ancient temple highly reſpected. The pre-ſence and the power of the
                    divinity are expreſſed by the fates which ſtand in the veſtibule.—Around this
                    temple are ſeveral little chapels, each of which covers a ſacred fountain ; for
                    the Clitumnus is the father of ſeveral little rivers which unite their ſtreams
                    with him. At ſome diſtance below the temple is a bridge which divides the ſacred
                    waters from thoſe which ate open to common uſe. No one muſt preſume to ſet his
                    foot in the ſtreams above this bridge ; and to ſtep over any of them is an
                    indignity which renders a perſon infamous. They can only be viſited in a
                    conſecrated boat. Below the bridge we are permitted to bathe, and the place is
                    inceſſantly occupied by the neighbouring villagers. (See alſo <hi rend="italic">Vibius Sequeſtr. Orbelini,</hi> p. ιoι— 103. and 221—223. alſo <hi
                        rend="italic"> Sueton. Calcula,</hi> c. 43. <hi rend="italic">Vlrg. Georg.
                        IL</hi> 146.)</p>
                <p>What is the cauſe of all this ? The Clitumnus flows (near its ſource) through
                    the richeſt paſtures, through which it was carefully diſtributed by numberleſs
                    drains; and theſe nouriſhed cattle of ſuch ſpotleſs whiteneſs and extraordinary
                    beauty, that they were fought for with eagerneſs over all Italy, as the moſt
                    acceptable victims in their ſacriflces. Is not this ſuperſtition then an
                    ef-fuſion of gratitude ?</p>
                <p>Such are the dictates of kind-hearted nature in our breaſts, before it has been
                    vitiated by vanity and ſelf-conceit, and we ſhould not be aſhamed of feeling the
                    impreſſion. We hardly think of making any apology for dwelling a little on this
                    incidental circumſtance of the ſuperſtitious veneration paid to rivers. We
                    cannot think that our readers will be diſpleaſed at having agreeable ideas
                    excited in their minds, being always of opinion that the torch of true
                    philofophy will not only enlighten the underſtanding, but alſo warm and cheriſh
                    the affections of the heart.</p>
                <p>With reſpect to the origin of rivers, we have very little to offer in this
                    place. It is obvious to every perſon, that beſides the torrents which carry down
                    into the rivers what part of the rains and melted ſnows is not abforbed by the
                    foil or taken up by the plants which cover the earth, they are fed either
                    immediately or remotely by the ſprings. A few remarkable ſtreams ruſh at once
                    out of the earth in force, and muſt be conſidered as the continuation of
                    ſubterraneous rivers, whoſe origin we are therefore to ſeek out ; and we do not
                    know any circumſtance in which their firſt beginnings differ from thoſe of other
                    rivers, which are formed by the union of little ſtreams and rills, each of which
                    has its own ſource in a ſpring or fountain. This queſtion, therefore, What is
                    the proceſs of nature, and what are the ſupplies which fill our ſprings ? will
                    be treated of under the word SpRing.</p>
                <p>Whatever be the ſource of rivers, it is to be met with in almoſt every part of
                    the globe. The cruſt of.</p>
                <p>earth with which the rocky framing of thia globe is covered is generally
                    ſtratified. Some of theſe ſtrataare extremely pervious to water, having but
                    ſmall attrac∙ tion for its particles, and being very porous. Such is the quality
                    of gravelly ſtrata in an eminent degree. Other ſtrata are much more firm, or
                    attract water more ſtrongly, and refuſe it a paſſage. This is the caſe with firm
                    rock and with clay. When a ſtratum of the firſt kind has one of the other
                    immediately under it, the water remains in the upper ſtratum, and burſts out
                    wherever the ſloping ſides of the hills cut off the ſtrata, and this will be in
                    the form of a trickling ſpring, becauſe the water in the porous ſtratum is
                    greatly obſtructed in its paſſage towards the outlet. As this irregular
                    formation of the earth is very general, we muſt have ſprings, and of courſe
                    rivers or rivulets, in every corner where there are high grounds.</p>
                <p>Rivers flow from the higher to the low grounds. It is the arrangement of this
                    elevation which diſtributes them over the ſurface of the earth. And this appears
                    to <hi rend="sup">x</hi> be accompliſhed with conſiderable regularity; and,
                    except the great deſert of Kobi on the confines of Chineſe Tartary, we do not
                    remember any very extenſive track of ground that is deprived of thoſe channels
                    for voiding the ſuperfluous waters ; and even there they are far ſrom being
                    redundant.</p>
                <p>The courſe of rivers give us the beſt general method for judging of the
                    elevation of a country. Thus it appears that Savoy and Switzerland are the
                    higheſt grounds of Europe, from whence the ground ſlopes in every direction.
                    From the Alps proceed the Danube and the Rhine, whoſe courſes mark the two great
                    valleys, into which many lateral ſtreams deſcend. The Po alſo and the Rhone come
                    from the ſame head, and with a ſteeper and ſhorter courſe find their way to the
                    ſea through valleys of leſs breadth and length. On the weſt ſide of the valleys
                    of the Rhine and the Rhone the ground riſes pretty faſt, ſo that few tributary
                    ſtreams come into them from that ſide ; and from this gentle elevation France
                    ſlopes to the weſtward. If a line, nearly ſtraight, but bending a little to the
                    northward, be drawn from the head of Savoy and Switzerland all the way to
                    Solikamſkoy in Siberia, it will nearly paſs through the moſt elevated part of
                    Europe ; for in this track moſt of the rivers have their riſe. On· the left go
                    off the various feeders of the Elbe, the O-der, the Weſel, the Niemen, the Duna,
                    the Neva, the Dwina, the Petzora. On the right, after paſſing the feeders of the
                    Danube, we ſee the ſources of the Sereth and Pruth, the Dnieſter, the Bog, the
                    Dnie∙ per, the Don, and the mighty Volga. The elevation, however, is extremely
                    moderate ; and it appears from the levels taken with the barometer by the Abbé
                    Chappe d’Auteroche, that the head of the Volga is not more than 470 feet above
                    the ſurface of the ocean. And we may obſerve here by the bye, that its mouth,
                    where it diſcharges its waters into the Caſpian ſea, is undoubtedly lower, by
                    many feet, than the ſurface of the ocean. See Pneumatics, n <hi rend="sup">3</hi> 277. Spain and Fin land, with Lapland, Norway, and Sweden, form two
                    detached parts, which have little ſymmetry with the reſt of Europe.</p>
                <p>A chain of mountains begins in Nova Zembla, and ſtretches due ſouth to near the
                    Caſpian Sea, dividing Europe from Aſia. About three or four degrees north</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0254" facs="gri_33125011196389_0260.tif"/>
                <p>of the Caſpian ſea it bends to the ſouth-eaſt, traverſes weſtern Tartary, and
                    paſſing between theTengis andZai-zan lakes, ſt then branches to the eaſt and
                    ſouth. The eaſtern branch runs to the ſhores of Korea and Kamt-ſchatka. The
                    ſouthern branch traverſes Turkeſtan and Thibet, ſeparating them from India, and
                    at the head of the kingdom of Ava joins an arm ſtretching from the great eaſtern
                    branch, and here forms the centre of a very ſtngular radiation. Chains of
                    mountains iſſue from it in every direction. Three or four of them keep very
                    cloſe together, dividing the continent into narrow flips, which have each a
                    great river flowing in the middle, and reaching to the extreme points of
                    Malacca, Cambodia, and Cochin-china. From the ſame central point proceeds
                    another great ridge due eaſt, and paſſes a little north of Canton in China. We
                    called this a ſingular centre : for though it fends off ſo many branches, it is
                    by no means the moſt elevated part of the continent. In the triangle which is
                    included between the firſt ſouthern ridge (which comes from between the lakes
                    Tanges andZaizan), the great eaſtern ridge, and its branch which almoſt unites
                    with the ſouthern ridge, lies the Boutan, and part of Tibet, and the many little
                    rivers which occupy its ſurface, flow ſouthward and eaſtward, uniting a little
                    to the north of the centre often mentioned, and then paſs through a gorge
                    eaſtward into China. And it is farther to be obſerved, that theſe great ridges
                    do not appear to be ſeated on the higheſt parte of the country ; for the rivers
                    which correſpond to them are at no great diſtance from them, and receive their
                    chief ſupplies ſrom the other ſides. This is remarkably the caſe with the great
                    Oby, which runs almoſt parallel to the ridge from the lakes to Nova Zem-bla. It
                    receives its ſupplies from the eaſt, and indeed it has its ſource far eaſt. The
                    higheſt grounds (if we except the ridges of mountains which are boundaries) of
                    the continent ſeem to be in the country of the Cal-mucs, about 95 <hi rend="sup"
                        > δ</hi> eaſt from London, and latitude 43° or 4f <hi rend="sup">0</hi> north. It is repreſented as a fine though ſandy country, having many little
                    rivers which loſe themſelves in the fand, or end in little ſalt lakes. This
                    elevation ſtretches north-eaſt to a great diſtance ; and in this track we find
                    the heads of the Irtiſh, Selenga, and Tun-guikaia (the great feeders of the
                    Oby), the Olenitz, the Lena, the Yana, and ſome other rivers which all go off to
                    the north. On the other ſide we have the great river Amur, and many ſmaller
                    rivers, whoſe names are not familiar. The Hoangho, the great river of China,
                    riſes on the ſouth ſide of the great eaſtern ridge we have ſo often mentioned.
                    This elevation, which is a continuation of the former, is ſomewhat of the ſame
                    complexion, being very ſandy, and at preſent is a deſert of prodigious extent.
                    It is deſcribed, however, as inter-ſperſed with vaſt tracks of rich paſture ;
                    and we know that it was formerly the reſidence of a great nation, who came
                    ſouth, by the name of <hi rend="italic">Turks,</hi> and poſſeſſed themſelves
                    of moſt of the richeſt kingdoms of Aſia. In tire ſouth-weſtern extremity of this
                    country are found remains not only of barbaric magnificence, but even of
                    cultivation and elegance. It was a profitable privilege granted by Peter the
                    Great to ſome adventurers to ſearch theſe ſandy deſerts ſor remains of former
                    opulence, and many pieces of delicate workmanſhip (tho <hi rend="sup">,</hi> not in a ſtyle which we would admire) in go'14! and ſil</p>
                <p>ver were found. Vaults were found buried in the fand filled with written papers,
                    in a character wholly unknown ; and a wall was diſcovered extending ſeveral
                    miles, built with hewn ſtone, and ornamented with corniche and battlements. But
                    we are forgetting ourſelves, and return to the conſideration of the diſtribution
                    of the rivers on the ſurface of the earth. A great ridge of •mountains begins at
                    the ſouth-eaſt corner of the Euxine Sea, and proceeds eaſtward, ranging along
                    the ſouth ſide of the Caſpian, and ſtill advancing unites with the mountains
                    firſt mentioned in Thibet, ſending off ſome branches to the ſouth, which divide
                    Perſia, India, and Thibet. From the ſouth ſide of this ridge flow the Euphrates,
                    Tigris, Indus, Ganges, &amp;c. and from the north the ancient Oxus and many
                    unknown ſtreams.</p>
                <p>There is a remarkable circumſtance in this quarter of the globe. Although it
                    ſeems to be neareſt to the greateſt elevations, it ſeems alſo to have places of
                    the greateſt depreſſion. We have already ſaid that the Caſpian Sea is lower
                    titan the ocean. There is in its neighbourhood another great baſon of ſalt
                    water, the lake Aral, which receives the waters of the Oxus or Gihon, which were
                    ſaid to have formerly run into the Caſpian Sea. There cannot therefore be a
                    great difference in the level of theſe twobaſons; neither have they any outlet,
                    tho’ they receive great rivers. There is another great lake in the very middle
                    of Perſia, the Zare or Zara, which receives the river Hindemend, of near 250
                    miles length, beſides other ſtreams. There is an« other ſuch in Aſia Minor. The
                    ſea of Sodom and Gomorrah is another inſtance. And in the high countries we
                    mentioned, there are many ſmall ſalt lakes, which receive little rivers, and
                    have no outlet. The lake Zara in Perſia, however, is the only one which
                    indicates a conſiderable hollow of the country. It is now aſcer- ' tained by
                    actual furvey, that the fest of Sodom is conſiderably higher than the
                    Mediterranean. This feature is not, however, peculiar to Aſia. It obtains alſo
                    in Africa, whoſe rivers we now proceed to mention.</p>
                <p>Of them, however, we know very little. The Nile indeed is perhaps better known
                    than any river out of Europe ; and of its ſource and progreſs we have given a
                    full account in a ſeparate article. See Nile.</p>
                <p>By the regiſter of the weather kept by Mr Bruce at Gondar in 1770 and 177r, it
                    appears that the greateſt rains are about the beginning of July. He ſays that at
                    an average each month after June it doubles its rains. The caliſh or canal is
                    opened at Cairo about the 9th of Auguſt, when the river has riſen 14 peeks (each
                    21 inches), and the waters begin to decreaſe about the I oth of September. Hence
                    we may form a conjecture concerning the time which the water employs in coming
                    from Abyſſinia. Mr Bruce ſuppoſes it 9 days, which ſup* poſes a velocity not
                    leſs than 14 feet in a ſecond; a thing paſt belief, and inconſiſtent with all
                    our notions. The general ſlope of the river is greatly diminiſhed by ſeveral
                    great cataraéts ; and Mr Bruce expreſsly ſays, that he might have come down from
                    Sennaar to the cataraéts of Syene in a boat, and that it is navigable for boats
                    far above Sennaar. He came ſrom Syene to Cairo by water. We apprehend that no
                    boat would venture down a ſtream moving even fix feet in a ſecond, and none
                    could row up if the velocity was three feet. As the waters begin to decreaſe
                    about the 10th of</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0255" facs="gri_33125011196389_0261.tif"/>
                <p>September, we muſt conclude that the water then flowing paſt Cairo had left
                    Abyſſinia when the rains had greatly abated. Judging in this way, we muſt ſtill
                    allow the ſtream a velocity of more than fix feet. Had the firſt ſwell at Cairo
                    been noticed in 1770 or 1771, we might have gueſſed better. The year that
                    Thevenot was in Egypt, the firſt ſwell of 8 peeks was obſerved Jan. 28. The
                    caliſh was opened for 14 peeks on Auguſt 14th, and the waters began to decreaſe
                    on September 23d, having riſen to 21⅔ peeks. We may ſuppoſe a ſimilar progreſs
                    at Cairo correſponding to Mr Bruce’s obſervations at Gondar, and date every
                    thing five days earlier.</p>
                <p>We underſtand that ſome of our gentlemen ſtation-ed far up the Ganges have had
                    the curiolity to take notes of the ſwellings of that river, and compare them
                    with the overflowings at Calcutta, and that their obſervations are about to be
                    made public, Such accounts are valuable additions to our practical knowledge,
                    and we ſhall not neglect to inſert the information in ſome kindred article of
                    this work.</p>
                <p>The ſame mountains which attract the tropical vapours, and produce the
                    fertilizing inundations of the Nile, perform the ſame office to the famous
                    Niger, whoſe exiſtence has often been accounted fabulous, and with whoſe courſe
                    we have very little acquaintance. The reſearches of the gentlemen of the African
                    afl’ocia-tion render its exiſtence no longer doubtful, and have greatly excited
                    the public curioſity. For a farther account of its track, ſee Niger.</p>
                <p>From the great number, and the very moderate ſize, of the rivers which faſt into
                    the Atlantic Ocean all the way ſouth of the Gambia, we conclude that the weſtern
                    ſhore is the moſt elevated, and that the mountains are at no great diſtance
                    inland. On the other hand, the rivers at Melinda and Soſala are of a magnitude
                    which indicate a much longer courſe. But of all this we ſpeak with much
                    uncertainty.</p>
                <p>The frame-work (ſo to call it) of America is better known, and is ſingular.</p>
                <p>A chain of mountains begins, or at leaſt is found, in longitude x ιo° weſt of
                    London, and latitude 40 <hi rend="sup">0</hi> north, on the northern confines
                    of the kingdom of Mexico, and ſtretching ſouthward through that kingdom, forms
                    the ridge of the neck of land which ſeparates North from South America, and
                    keeping almoſt cloſe to the ſhore, ranges along the whole weſtern coaſt of South
                    America, terminating at Cape Horn. In its courſe it fends off branches, which
                    after ſeparating from it for a few leagues, rejoin it again, incloſing valleys
                    of great extent from north to ſouth, and of prodigious elevation. In one of
                    theſe, under the equatorial ſun, ſtands the city of Quito, in the midſt of
                    extenſive fields of barléy, oats, wheat, and gardens, containing apples, pears,
                    and gooſe-berries, and in ſhort all the grains and fruits of the cooler parts of
                    Europe ; and although the vine is alſo there in perfection, the olive is
                    wanting. Not a dozen miles from it in the low countries, the ſugar-cane, the
                    indigo, and all the fruits of the torrid zone, find their congenial heat, and
                    the inhabitants ſwelter under a burning ſun. At as ſmall a diſtance on the other
                    hand tower aloft the pinacles of Pichincha, Corambourou, and Chemboracaô,
                    crowned with never melting ſnows.</p>
                <p>The individual mountains of this ſtupendous range aot only exceed in height all
                    others in the world (if we except the Peak of Teneriffe, Mount Ætna, and Mount
                    Blanc); but they are ſet down on a baſe incomparably more elevated than any
                    other country. They cut off therefore all communication between the Pacific
                    Ocean and the inland continent ; and no rivers are to be found on the weſt coaſt
                    of South America which have any conſiderable length of courſe or body of waters.
                    The country is drained, like Africa, in the oppoſite direction. Not 100 miles
                    from the city of Lima, the capital of Peru, which lies almoſt on the ſea ſhore,
                    and juſt at the foot of the high Cordilleras, ariſes out of a ſmall lake the
                    Maragnon or Amazon’s river, which, after running northward for about 100 miles,
                    takes an eaſterly direction, and croſſes nearly the broadeſt part of South
                    America, and falls into the great weſtern ocean at Para, after a courſe of not
                    leſs than 3500 miles. In the firſt half of its deſcent it receives a few
                    middle-ſized rivers from the north, and from the ſouth it receives the great
                    river Combos, ſpringing from another little lake not 50 miles diſtant from the
                    head of the Maragnon, and incloſing between them a wide extent of country. Then
                    it receives the Yuta, the Yuerva, the Cuchivara, and Parana Mire, each of which
                    is equal to the Rhine ; and then the Madeira, which has flowed above 1300 miles.
                    At their junction the breadth is ſo great, that neither ſhore can be ſeen by a
                    perſon ftanding up in a canoe ; ſo that the united ſtream m iſt be about 6 miles
                    broad'. In this majeſtic form it rolls along at a prodigious rate through a flat
                    country, covered with impenetrable fo-reſts, and moſt of it as yet untrodden by
                    human feet. Mr Condamine, who came down the ſtream, ſays, that all is filent as
                    the deſert, and the wild beaſtsand numberleſs birds crowd round the boat, eyeing
                    it as ſome animal of which they did not ſeem afraid. The bed was cut deep
                    through an equal and yielding foil, which ſeemed rich in every part, if he could
                    judge by the ve-getation, which was rank in the extreme. What an· addition this
                    to the poſſible population of this globe Î A narrow flip along each bank of this
                    mighty river would equal in ſurface the whole of Europe, and would probably
                    exceed it in general fertility : and although the velocity in the main ſtream
                    was great, he obſerved that it was extremely moderate, nay almoſt ſtill, at the
                    ſides ſo that in thoſe parts where the country was-inhabited by men, the Indians
                    paddled up the river with perfect eaſe. Boats could go from Para to near the
                    mouth of the Madeira in 38 days, which is near 1200 miles-.</p>
                <p>Mr Condamine made an obſervation during his paſſage' down the Maragnon, which is
                    extremely curious and inſtructive, although it puzzled him very much. He
                    obſerved that the tide was ſenſible· at a vaſt diſtance from- the mouth : It was
                    very conſiderable at the junction of the Madeira ; and he ſuppoſes that it might
                    have been obſerved much farther up. This appeared to him very ſurpriſing,
                    becauſe there could be no doubt but that the ſurface of the water there was
                    higher by a great many feet than the ſurface of the flood of the At-» lantic
                    ocean at the mouth of the river. It was therefore very natural for him to
                    aſcribe the tide in the Maragnon to the immediate action of the moon on its
                    wa-ters ; and this explanation was the more reaſonable, becauſe the river
                    extends in the direction of terreſtria} longitude, which by the Newtonian theory
                    is moſt favourable to the production of a tide. Journeying as ln?</p>

                <p>did in an Indian canoe, we cannot ſuppoſe that he had much leiſure or
                    conveniency for calculations, and therefore are not ſurpriſed that he did not
                    ſee that even this circumſtance was of little avail in ſo ſmall or ſhallow a
                    body of water. He carefully noted, however, the times of high and low water as
                    he paſſed along. When arrived at Para, he found not only that the high water was
                    later and later as we are farther from the mouth, but he found that at one and
                    the ſame inſtant there were ſeveral points oſhigh water between Para and the
                    confluence of the Madeira, with points of low water intervening. This concluſion
                    was eaſily drawn from his own obſervations, although he could not fee at one
                    in-ſlant the high waters in different places. He had only to compute the time of
                    high water at a particular ſpot, on the day he obſerved it at another ;
                    allowing, as uſual, for the moon’s change of poſition. The reſult of his
                    obſervations therefore was, that the ſurface of the river was not an inclined
                    plane whoſe ſlope was leſ-ſened by the tide of flood at the mouth of the river,
                    but that it was a waving line, and that the propagation of the tide up the river
                    was nothing different from the propagation of any other wave. We may conceive it
                    clearly, though imperfectly, in this way. Let the place be noted where the tide
                    happens 12 hours later than at the mouth of the river. It is evident that there
                    is alſo a tide at the very mouth at ⅝he ſame inſtant; and, ſince the ocean tide
                    had withdrawn itſelf during the time that the former tide had proceeded ſo far
                    up the river, and the tide of ebb is ſucceſſively felt above as well as the tide
                    of flood, there muſt be a low water between theſe two high waters.</p>
                <p>Newton had pointed out this curious ſact, and obſerved that the tide at
                    London-Bridge, which is 43 feet above the ſea, is not the ſame with that at
                    Graveſ-end, but the preceding tide (See <hi rend="italic">Phil. Tranſ 6q.)</hi> This will be more particularly infilled on in another place.</p>
                <p>Not far from the head of the Maragnon, the Cordilleras fend off a branch to the
                    north-eaſt, which reaches and ranges along the ſhore of the Mexican Gulf, and
                    the Rio Grande de Sta Martha occupies the angle betweeen the ridges.</p>
                <p>Another ridge ranges with interruptions along the eaſt coaſt of Terra Firma, ſo
                    that the whole waters of this country are collected into the Oroonoko. In like
                    manner the north and eaſt of Braſil are hemmed in by mountainous ridges, through
                    which there is no conſiderable paſſage ; and the ground ſloping backwards, all
                    The waters of this immenſe track are collected from both ſides by many
                    conſiderable rivers into the great river Paraguay, or Rio de la Plata, which
                    runs down the middle of this country for more than 1400 miles, and falls into
                    the ſea through a vaſt mouth in latitude 35°'</p>
                <p>Thus the whole of South America ſeems as if it had been formerly ſurrounded by a
                    mound, and been a great baſon. The ground in the middle, where the Parama, the
                    Madeira, and the Plata, take their riſe, is an immenſe marſh, uninhabitable for
                    its exhalations, and quite impervious in its preſent ſtate.</p>
                <p>The manner in which the continent of North America is watered, or rather
                    drained, has alſo ſome peculiarities. By looking at the map, one will obſerve
                    firſt of all a general diviſion of the whole of the beſt known part into two, by
                    the valleys in which the beds of the river St Laurence and Miſſiſſippi are
                    ſituated. The head of this is occupied by a ſingular ſeries of freſh water ſeas
                    or lakes, viz. the lake Superior and Michigan, which empty themſelves into lake
                    Huron by two cataracts. This again runs into lake Erie by the river Detroiî, and
                    the Erie pours its waters into the Ontario by the famous fall of Niagara, and
                    from the On* tario proceeds the great river St Laurence.</p>
                <p>The ground to the ſouth-weſt of the lakes Superior and Erie is ſomewhat lower,
                    and the middle of the valley is occupied by the Miſſiſſippi and the Miſſoure,
                    which receive on both ſides a number of ſmaller ſtreams, and having joined,
                    proceed to the ſouth, under the name Miſſiſſippi. In latitude 37, this river
                    receives into its bed the Ohio, a river of equal magnitude, and the Cherokee
                    river, which drains all the country lying at the back of the United States,
                    ſeparated from them by the ranges of the Apalachian mountains. The Miſſiſſippi
                    is now one of the chief rivers on the globe, and proceeds due ſouth, till it
                    falls into the Mexican bay through ſeveral ſhifting mouths, which greatly
                    reſemble thoſe of the Danube and the Nile, having run above 1200 miles.</p>
                <p>The elevated country between this bed of the Miſſiſſippi and St Laurence and the
                    Atlantic ocean is drained on the eaſt ſide by a great number of rivers, ſome of
                    which are very conſiderable, and of long courſe ; becauſe inſtead of being
                    nearly at right angles to the coaſt, as in other countries, they are in a great
                    meaſure parallel to it. This is more remarkably the caſe with Hudſon’s river,
                    the Delaware, Patomacſk, Rapahanoc, &amp;c. Indeed the whole of North
                    America ſeems to conſiſt of ribs or beams laid nearly parallel to each other
                    from north to ſouth, and the rivers occupy the interſtices. All thoſe which
                    empty themſelves into the bay of Mexico are parallel and almoſt perfectly
                    ſtraight, unlike what are ſeen in other parts of the world. The weſtermoſt of
                    them all, the North River, as it is named by the Spaniards, is nearly as long as
                    the Miſſiſſippi.</p>
                <p>We are very little informed as yet of the diſtribution of rivers on the
                    north-weſt coaſt of America, or the courſe of thoſe which run into Hudſon’s and
                    Baffin’s bay.</p>
                <p>The Maragnon is undoubtedly the greateſt river in the world, both as to length
                    of run and the vaſt body of water which it rolls along. The other great rivers
                    ſucceed nearly in the following order.</p>

                <p>notice of our geographers. We cannot divine what has cauſed Mr Buffon to ſay
                    that the courſe of moſt riverg is from eaſt to weſt or from weſt to eaſt. No
                    phy∩cal point of his ſyſtem ſeems to require it, and it needs only that we look
                    at his own map to fee its falſity. We ſhould naturally expect: to find the <hi

                    oppoſi-tion to Mr Buffon’s aſſertion. The ſtructure of America is ſo particular,
                    that <hi rend="italic">very few</hi> of its rivers have their general courſe
                    in this direction. We proceed now to conſider the motion of rivers ; a ſubject

                    the centre of our dwellings ; we muſt ſecure ourſelves againſt their ravages ;
                    we muſt employ them to drive thoſe machines which, by compenſating for our
                    perſonal weakneſs, make a few able to perform the work of thouſands ; we employ
                    them to water and fertilize our fields, to decorate our manſions, to cleanſe and
                    embelliſh our cities, to preſerve or extend our demeſnes, to tranſport from
                    county to county every thing which neceſſity, convenience, or luxury, has
                    rendered precious to man : for theſe purpoſes we muſt confine and govern the

                    off from them what ſhall water our fields, drive our machines, or ſupply our

                    their places by canals ; we muſt drain our fens, and defend them when drained ;
                    we muſt underſtand their motions, and their mode of ſecret, flow, but un-ceaſing

                    through every corner of the country the materials of the moſt extenſive commerce
                    on the face of this globe.</p>
                <p>Such having been our inceſſant occupations with moving waters, we ſhould expect
                    that while the operative artiſts are continually furniſhing facts and
                    experiments, the man of ſpeculative and ſcientiſic curioſity, excited by the
                    importance of the ſubject, would ere now have made conſiderable progreſs in the
                    ſcience ; and that the profeſſional engineer would be daily acting from
                    eſtabliſhed principle, and be ſeldom diſappointed in his expectations.
                    Unfortunately the reverſe of this is nearly the true ſtate of the caſe ; each
                    engineer is obliged to collect the greateſt part of his knowledge from his own
                    experience, and by many dear-bought leſſons, to direct his future operations, in
                    which he ſtill proceeds with anxiety and heſitation : for we have not yet
                    acquired principles of theory, and experiments have not yet been collected and
                    publiſhed, by which an empirical practice might be ſafely formed. Many
                    experiments of ineſtimable value are daily made ; but they remain with their
                    authors, who ſeldom have either leiſure, ability, or generoſity, to add them to
                    the public ſtock.</p>
                <p>The motion of waters has been really ſo little inveſ-tigated as yet, that
                    hydraulics may ſtill be called a new ſtudy. We have merely ſhimmed over a few
                    common notions concerning the motions of water ; and the mathematicians of the
                    firſt order ſeem to have contented themſelves with ſuch views as allowed them to
                    entertain themſelves with elegant applications of calculus. This, however, has
                    not been their fault. They rarely had any opportunity of doing more, for want of
                    a knowledge of facts. They have made excellent uſe of the few which have been
                    given them j but it required much labour, great variety of opportunity, and
                    great expence, to learn the multiplicity of things which are combined even in
                    the ſimpleſt caſes of water in motion. Theſe are ſeldom the lot of the
                    mathematician ; and he is without blame when he enjoys the pleaſures within his
                    reach, and cultivates the ſcience of geometry in its moſt abſtracted form. Here
                    he makes a progreſs which is the boaſt of human reaſon, being almoſt inſured
                    from error by the intellectual ſimplicity of his ſubject. But when we turn our
                    attention to material objects, and without knowing either the ſize and ſhape of
                    the elementary particles, or the laws which nature has preſcribed for their
                    action, preſume to foreſee their effects, calculate their exertions, direct
                    their actions, what muſt be the conſequence ? Nature ſhows her independence with
                    reſpect to our notions, and, always faithful to the laws which are injoined, and
                    of which we are ignorant, ſhe never fails to thwart our views, to diſconcert our
                    projects, and render uſeleſs all our efforts.</p>
                <p>To wiſh to know the nature of the elements is vain, and our groſs organs are
                    infoſſicient for the ſtudy. To ſuppoſe what we do not know, and to fancy ſhapes
                    and ſizes at will ; this is to raiſe phantoms, and will produce a ſyſtem, but
                    will not prove a foundation, for any ſcience. But to interrogate Nature herſelf,
                    ſtudy the laws which ſhe ſo faithfully obſerves, catch her, as we ſay, in the
                    fact, and thus wreſt from her the ſecret; this is the only way to become her
                    maſter, and it is the only procedure conſiſtent with good ſenſe. And we ſee,
                    that ſoon after Kepler detected the laws of the planetary motions, when Galileo
                    diſcovered the uniform acceleration of gravity, when Paſchal diſcovered the
                    pref≈ fore of the atmoſphere, and Newton diſcovered the laws of attraction and
                    the track of a ray of light; aſtronomy, mechanics, hydroſtatics, chemiſtry,
                    optics, quickly be</p>

                <p>came bodies of ſound doctrine; and the deductions from their respective theories
                    were found fair repreſentations of the phenomena of nature. Whenever a man has
                    diſcovered a law of nature, he has laid the foundation of a ſcience, and he has
                    given us a new mean of ſubjecting to our ſervice ſome element hitherto
                    independent: and ſo long as groups of natural operations follow a route which
                    appears to us whimſical, and will not admit our calculations, we may be aſſured
                    that we are ignorant of the principle which connects them all, and regulates
                    their procedure.</p>
                <p>This is remarkably the caſe with ſeveral phenomena in the motions of fluids, and
                    particularly in the motion of water in a bed or conduit of any kind. Although
                    the firſt geniuſes of Europe have for this century paſt turned much of their
                    attention to this ſubject, we are almoſt ignorant of the <hi rend="italic">general laws</hi> which may be obſerved in their motions. We have been able
                    to ſclect very few points of reſemblance, and every caſe remains nearly an
                    individual. About 150 years ago we diſcovered, by experience only, the quantity
                    and velocity of water iſſuing from a ſmall orifice, and, after much labour, have
                    extended this to any orifice; and this is almoſt the whole of our confidential
                    knowledge. But as to the uniform courſe of the ſtreams which water the face of
                    the earth, and the maxims which will certainly negulate this agreeably to our
                    wiſhes, we are in a manner totally ignorant. Who can pretend to ſay what is the
                    velocity of a river of which you tell him the breadth, the depth, and the
                    declivity? Who can ſay what ſwell will be produced in different parts of its
                    courſe, if a dam or weir of given dimenſions be made in it, or a bridge be
                    thrown acroſs it? or how much its waters will be raiſed by turning another
                    ſtream into it, or ſunk by taking off a branch to drive a mill? Who can ſay with
                    confidence what muſt be the dimenſions or ſlope of this branch, in order to
                    furniſh the water that is wanted, or the dimenſions and ſlope of a canal which
                    ſhall effectually drain a fenny diſtrict? Who can ſay what form will cauſe or
                    will prevent the undermining of banks, he forming of elbows, the pooling of the
                    bed, or the de-poſition of lands? Yet theſe are the moſt important queſtions.</p>
                <p>The cauſes of this ignorance are the want or uncertainty of our principles; the
                    falſity of our only theory, which is belied by experience and the ſmall number
                    of proper obſervations or experiments, and difficulty of making ſuch as ſhall be
                    ſerviceable. We have, it is true, made a few experiments on the efflux of water
                    ſrom ſmall orifices, and from them we have deduced a ſort of theory, dependant
                    on the fall of heavy bodies and the laws of hydroſtatic preſſure. Hydroſtatics
                    is indeed founded on very ſimple principles, which give a very good account of
                    the laws of the quieſcent equilibrium of fluids, in conſequence of gravity and
                    perfect fluidity. But by what train of reaſoning can we connect theſe with the
                    phenomena of the uniform motion of the waters of a river or open ſtream, which
                    can derive its motion only from the ſlope of its ſurface, and the modifications
                    of this motion or its velocity only from the width and depth of the ſtream?
                    Theſe are the only circumſtances which can diſtinguiſh a portion of a river from
                    a veſſel of the ſame ſize and ſhape, in which, however, the water is at reſt. In
                    both, gιavity is the ſole cauſe of preſſure and motion; but there muſt be ſome</p>
                <p>circumſtance peculiar to running waters which modifies the exertions of this
                    active principle, and which, when diſcovered, muſt be the baſis of hydraulics,
                    and muſt oblige us to reject every theory founded on fancied hy-potheſes, and
                    which can only lead to abſurd conclu-ſions: and ſurely abſurd conſequences, when
                    legitimately drawn, are complete evidence of improper principles.</p>
                <p>When it was diſcovered experimentally, that the velocities of water iſſuing from
                    orifices at various depths under the ſurface were as the ſquare roots of thoſe
                    depths, and the fact was verified by repeated experiments, this principle was
                    immediately and without modification applied to every motion of water. Mariotte,
                    Varignon, Guglielmini, made it the baſis of complete ſyſtems of hydraulics,
                    which prevail to this day, after having received various amendments and
                    modifications. The ſame reaſoning obtains through them all, though frequently
                    obſcured by other circumſtances, which are more perſpicuouſly expreſſed by
                    Guglielmini in his. Fundamental Theorems.</p>
                <p>He conſiders every point P (fig. 1. ) in a maſs of fluid as an orifice in the
                    ſide of a veſſel, and conceives the particle as having a tendency to move with
                    the ſame velocity with which it would iſſue from the orifice. Therefore, if a
                    vertical line AFC be drawn thro* that point, and if this be made the axis of a
                    parabolic ADE, of which A at the ſurface of the fluid is the vertex, and AB
                    (four times the height through which a heavy body would fall in a ſecond) is the
                    parameter, the velocity of this particle will be repreſented by the ordinate PD
                    of this parabola; that is, PD is the ſpace which it would uniformly deſcribe in
                    a ſecond.</p>
                <p>From this principle is derived the following theory of running waters.</p>
                <p>Let DC (fig. 2. ) be the horizontal bottom of a reſervoir, to which is joined a
                    ſloping channel CK of uniform breadth, and let AB be the ſurface of the
                    ſtand-ing water in the reſervoir. Suppoſe the vertical plane BC pierced with an
                    infinity of holes, through each of which the water iſſues. The velocity of each
                    filament will be that which is acquired by falling from the ſur-face AB<note
                        anchored="true" place="margin" type="authorial">See <hi rend="italic"
                            >Guglielmini's Hydraulics,</hi> 21/</note>. The filament C, iſſuing with
                    this velocity, will then glide down the inclined plane like any other heavy
                    body; and (by the common doctrine of the motion down an inclined plane ) when it
                    has arrived at F, it will have the ſame velocity which it would have acquired by
                    falling through the height OF, the point O being in the horizontal plane AB
                    produced. The ſame may be ſaid of its velocity when it arrives at H or K. The
                    filament immediately above C will alſo iſſue with a velocity which is in the
                    ſubduplicate ratio of its depth, and will then glide down above the firſt
                    filament. The ſame may be affirmed of all the filaments; and of the ſuperficial
                    filament, which will occupy the ſurface of the deſcending ſtream.</p>
                <p>From this account of the geneſis of a running ſtream of water, we may fairly
                    draw the following conſequences.</p>
                <p>1. The velocity of any particle R, in any part of the ſtream, is that acquired
                    by falling from the horizontal plane AN.</p>
                <p>2. The velocity at the bottom of the ſtream is everywhere greater than anywhere
                    above it, and is leaſt of all at the ſurface.</p>
                <p>3. The velocity of the ſtream increaſes continually as the ſtream recedes from
                    its ſource.</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0259" facs="gri_33125011196389_0265.tif"/>
                <p>4∙ Tire depths RF, GH, &amp;c. in different parts of the ſtream, will be
                    nearly in the inverſe ſubduplicate ratio of the depths under the ſurface AN: for
                    ſince the ſame quantity of water is running through every ſection FF and GH, and
                    the channel is ſuppoſed of uniform breadth, the depth of each ſection muſt be
                    in-verſely as the velocity of the water paſſing through it. This velocity is
                    indeed different in different filaments of the ſection; but the mean velocity in
                    each ſection is in the ſubduplicate ratio of the depth of the filament under the
                    ſurface AB. Therefore the ſtream becomes more ſhallow as it recedes from the
                    ſource; and in conſequence of this the difference between LH and MG continually
                    diminiſhes, and the velocities at the bottom and ſurface of the ſtream
                    continually approach to equality, and at a great diſtance from the ſource they
                    differ inſenſibly.</p>
                <p>5. If the breadth of the ſtream be contracted in any part, the depth of the
                    running water will be increaſed in that part, becauſe the ſame quantity muſt
                    ſtill paſs through ; but the velocity at the bottom will remain the ſame, and
                    that at the ſurface will be leſs than it was before ; and the area of the
                    ſection will be increaſed on the whole.</p>
                <p>6. Should a ſluice be put acroſs the ſtream, dipping a little into the water,
                    the water muſt immediately riſe on the upper ſide of the ſluice till it riſes
                    above the level of the reſervoir, and the ſmalleſt immerſion of the ſluice will
                    produce this effect. For by lowering the ſluice, the area of the ſection is
                    diminiſhed, and the velocity cannot be increaſed till the water heap up to a
                    greater height than the ſurſace of the reſervoir, and this acquires a preſſure
                    which will produce a greater velocity of efflux through the orifice left below
                    the ſluice.</p>
                <p>7. An additional quantity of water coming into this channel will increaſe the
                    depth of the ſtream, and the quantity of water which it conveys; but it will not
                    increaſe the velocity of the bottom filaments, unleſs it comes from a higher
                    ſource.</p>
                <p>All theſe conſequences are contrary to experience, and ſhow the imperfection, at
                    leaſt, of the explanation.</p>
                <p>The third conſequence is of all the moſt contrary to experience. If any one will
                    but take the trouble of following a ſingle brook from its ſource to the ſea, he
                    wall find it moſt rapid in its beginnings among the mountains, gradually
                    ſlackening its pace as it winds among the hills and gentler declivities, and at
                    laſt creeping ſlowly along through the flat grounds, till it is checked and
                    brought to reſt by the tides of the ocean.</p>
                <p>Nor is the ſecond conſequence more agreeable to obſervation. It is univerſally
                    found, that the velocity of the ſurface in the middle of the ſtream is the
                    greateſt of all, and that it gradually diminiſhes from thence to the bottom and
                    ſides.</p>
                <p>And the firſt conſequence, if'true, would render the running waters on the
                    ſurface of this earth the inſtruments of immediate ruin and devaſtation. If the
                    waters of our rivers, in the cultivated parts of a country, which are two,
                    three, and four hundred feet lower than their ſources, run with the velocity due
                    to that height, they would in a few minutes lay the earth bare to the very
                    bones.</p>
                <p>The velocities of our rivers, brooks, and rills, being &lt;b .greatly
                    inferior to what this theory aſſigns to them</p>
                <p>the other conſequences are equally contrary to experience. When a ſtream has its
                    ſection diminiſhed by narrowing the channel, the current increaſes in depth, and
                    this is always accompanied by an increaſe of velocity through the whole of the
                    ſection, and moſt of all at the ſurface ; and the area of the ſection does not
                    increaſe, but diminiſhes, all the phenomena, thus contradicting in every
                    circumſtance the deduction from the theory ; and when the ſection has been
                    diminiſhed by a ſluice let down into the ſtream, the water gradually heaps up on
                    the upper ſide of the ſluice, and, by its preſſure, produces an acceleration of
                    the ſtream below the ſluice, in the ſame way as if it were the beginning of a
                    ſtream, as explained in the theory. The velocity now is compoſed of the velocity
                    preſerved from the ſource and the velocity produced by this ſubordinate
                    accumulation ; and this accumulation and velocity continually increaſe, till
                    they become ſuch that the whole ſupply is again diſcharged through this
                    contracted ſection : any additional water not only increaſes the quantity
                    carried along the ſtream, but alſo increaſes the velocity, and therefore the
                    ſection does not increaſe in the proportion of the quantity.</p>
                <p>It is ſurpriſing that a theory really founded on a conceit, and which in every
                    the moſt familiar and obvious circumſtance is contradicted by facts, ſhould
                    -have met with ſo much attention. That Varignon ſhould immediately catch at this
                    notion of Guglielmini, and make it the ſubject of many elaborate analytical
                    memoirs, is not to be wondered at. This author only wanted <hi rend="italic">donner ρr if e au calcul ;</hi> and it was a ufual joke among the
                    academicians of Paris, when any new theorem was invented, <hi rend="italic">donnons le à Varignon à generalifer.</hi> But his numeι <hi rend="sup">-</hi> ous theorems and corollaries were adopted by all, and ſtill make the
                    ſubſtance of the preſent ſyſtems of hydraulics. Graveſande, Muſhenbroek, and all
                    the elementary treatiſes of natural philoſophy, deliver no other doctrines ; and
                    Belidor, who has been conſidered as the firſt of all the ſcientiſic engineers,
                    details the ſame theory in his great work the <hi rend="italic">Λrclntefture
                        Hydraulique.</hi></p>
                <p>Guglielmini was, however, not altogether the dupe of his own ingenuity. He was
                    not only a pretty good mathematician, but an aſſiduous and ſagacious obſerver.
                    He had applied his theory to ſome important caſes which occurred in the courſe
                    of his profeſſion as in-ſpector of the rivers and canals in the Milaneſe, and to
                    the courſe of the Danube; and could not but perceive that great corrections were
                    neceſſary for making the theory quadrate in ſome tolerable manner with
                    obſervation ; and he immediately ſaw that the motion was greatly obſtructed by
                    inequalities of the canal, which gave to the contiguous filaments of the ſtream
                    tranſ-verſe motions, which thwarted and confuſed the regular progreſs of the
                    reſt of the ſtream, and thus checked its general progreſs. Theſe obſtructions,
                    he obſerved, were moſt effectual in the beginning of its courſe, while yet a
                    ſmall rill, running among ſtones, and in a veιγ unequal bed. The whole ſtream
                    being ſmall, the inequalities bore a great proportion to it, and thus the
                    general effect was great. He alſo ſaw that the ſame cauſes (theſe tranſverſe
                    motions produced by the unequal bottom) chiefly affected the contiguous
                    filaments, and were the reaſons why the velocity at the ſides and bottom was ſo
                    much diminiſhed as to be leſs than the ſu-perſicial velocity, and that even this
                    might come to be</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0260" facs="gri_33125011196389_0266.tif"/>
                <p>diminiſhed by the ſame cauſe. For he obſerved, that the general ſtream of a
                    river is frequently compoſed of a ſort of boiling or tumbling motion, by which
                    maſſes of water are brought up to the ſurface and again de-foend. Every perſon
                    muſt recollect ſuch appearances in the ſreſhes of a muddy river ; and in this
                    way Guglielmini was enabled to account in ſome meaſure for the diſagreement of
                    his theory with obſervation.</p>
                <p>Mariotte had obſerved the ſame obſtructions even in the ſmootheſt glaſs pipes.
                    Here it could not be aſcribed to the checks occaſioned by tranſverſe motions. He
                    therefore aſcribed it to friction, which he ſuppoſed to diminiſh the motion of
                    fluid bodies in the ſame manner as of ſolids: and he thence concludes, that the
                    filaments which immediately rub on the ſides of the tube have their velocity
                    gradually diminiſhed ; and that the filaments immediately adjoining to theſe,
                    being thus obliged to paſs over them or outſtrip them, rub upon them, and have
                    their own velocity diminiſhed in like manner, but in a ſmaller degree; and that
                    the ſucceeding filaments towards the axis of the tube ſuffer, ſimilar but
                    ſmaller diminutions. By this means the whole ſtream may come to have a ſmaller
                    velocity ; and at any rate the medium velocity by which the quantity diſcharged
                    is determined, is ſmaller than it would have beea independent of friction.</p>
                <p>Guglielmini adopted this opinion of Mariotte, and in his next work on the Motion
                    of Rivers, conſidered this as the <hi rend="italic">chief</hi> cauſe of the
                    retardation ; and he added a third circumſtance, which he conſidered as of no
                    leſs conſequence, the viſcidity or tenacity of water. He obſerves that ſyrup,
                    oil, and other fluids, where this viſcidity is more remarkable, have their
                    motions prodigi-ouſly retarded by it, and ſuppoſes that water differs from them
                    only in the degree in which it poſſeſſes this quality : and he ſays, that by
                    this means not only the particles which are moving more rapidly have their
                    motions diminiſhed by thoſe in their neighbourhood which move flower, but that
                    the filaments alſo which would have moved more ſlowly are accelerated by their
                    more active neighbours ; and that in this, manner the ſuperficial and inferior
                    velocities are brought nearer to an equality. But this will never account for
                    the univerſal fact, that the ſuperficial particles are the ſwifteſt of all. The
                    ſuperficial particles, ſays ſhe, acquire by this means a greater velocity than
                    the parabolic law allows them ; the medium velocity is often in the middle of
                    the depth ; the numerous obſtacles, continually multiplied and repeated, cauſe
                    the current to loſe the velocity acquired by the fall ; the ſlope of the bottom
                    then diminiſhes, and often becomes very ſmall, ſo that the force remaining is
                    hardly able to overcome the obſtacles which are ſtill repeated, and the river is
                    reduced almoſt to a ſtate of ſtagnation. He obſerves, that the Rheno, a river of
                    the Milaneſe, has near its mouth a ſlope of no more than yo", which he conſiders
                    as quite inadequate to the taſk ; and here he introduces another principle,
                    which he conſiders as an effential part of the theory of open currents. This is,
                    that there ariſes ſrom the very depth of the ſtream a propelling force which
                    reſtores a part of the loſt velocity. He offers nothing in proof of this
                    principle, but uſes it to account ſor and explain the motion of waters in
                    horizontal canals. The principle has been adopted by the numerous Italian
                    writers on hydraulics,</p>
                <p>and, by various contrivances, ipterwoven with the para«</p>
                <p>bolic theory, as it is called, of Guglielmini. Our reader may ſee it in various
                    modifications in the <hi rend="italic">Idraſtatica e Idraulica</hi> of P.
                    Lecchi, and in the <hi rend="italic">Sperien%e Idrauliche</hi> of Michelotti.
                    It is by no means diſtinct either in its origin or in the manner of its
                    application to the explanation of phenomena, and ſeems only to ſerve for giving
                    ſomething like conſiſtency to the vague and obſcure diſcuſſions which have been
                    publiſhed on this ſubject- in Italy. We have already remarked, that in that
                    country the ſubject is particularly intereſting, and has been much commented
                    upon. But the writers of England, France, and Germany, have not paid ſo much
                    attention to it, and have more generally occupied themſelves with the motion of
                    water in cloſe conduits, which ſeem to admit of a more preciſe application of
                    mathematical reaſoning.</p>
                <p>Some of thoſe have conſidered with more attention the effects of friction and
                    viſcidity. Sir Iſaac Newton, with his uſual penetration, had ſeen diſtinctly the
                    manner in which it behoved theſe circumſtances to operate. He had occaſion, in
                    his reſearches into the mechaniſm of the celeſtial motions, to examine the
                    famous hypo-theſis of Deſcartes, that the planets were carried round the ſun by
                    fluid vortices, and law that there would be no end to,uncertainty and diſpute
                    till the <hi rend="italic">modus operandi</hi> of theſe vortices was
                    mechanically conſidered. He therefore employed himſelf in the inveſtigation of
                    the manner in which the acknowledged powers of natural bodies, acting according
                    to the received laws of mechanics, could produce and preſerve theſe vortices,
                    and re-ſtore that motion which was expended in carrying the planets round the
                    ſun. He therefore, in the ſecond . book of the Principles of Natural Philofophy,
                    gives a ſeries of beautiful propoſitions, viz. y I, 52, &amp;c. with: their
                    corollaries, ſho wing how the rotation of acylinderor ſphere round its axis in
                    the midſt of a fluid will excite a vortical motion in this fluid ; and he
                    aſcertains with mathematical preciſion the motion of every filament of this
                    vortex.</p>
                <p>He ſets out from the ſuppofition that this motion is-excited in the ſurrounding
                    ſtratum of fluid in confo-quence of a want of perfect lubricity, and affirmes as
                    an hypotheſis, that the initial reſiſtance (or diminution of the motion of the
                    cylinder) which ariſes from this want of lubricity, is proportional to, the
                    velocity with which the ſurface of the cylinder is ſeparated from the contiguous
                    ſurface of the ſurrounding fluid, and that the whole reſiſtance is proportional
                    to the velocity with which the parts of the fluid are mutually ſeparated from
                    each other. From this, and the equality of action and re-action, it evidently
                    follows, that the velocity of any ſtratum of the vortex is the arithmetical
                    medium between the velocities of the ſtrata immediately within and without it.
                    For the intermediate ſtratum cannot be in equilibrio, unleſs it is as much
                    preſſed forward by the ſuperior motion of the ſtratum within it, as it is kept
                    back by the flower motion of the ſtratum without it.</p>
                <p>This beautiful inveſtigation applies in the moſt perfect manner to every change
                    produced in the motion of a fluid filament, in conſequence of the viſcidity and
                    friction of the adjoining filaments; and a filament proceeding along a tube at
                    ſome ſmall diſtance from the ſides has, in like manner, a velocity which is the
                    medium between thoſe of the filament} immediately ſurrounding</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0261" facs="gri_33125011196389_0267.tif"/>
                <p>it. It is therefore a problem of no very difficult ſolu-tion to aſſign the law
                    by which the velocity will gradually diminiſh as the filament recedes from the
                    axis of a cylindrical tube. It is ſomewhat ſurpriſmg that ſo neat a problem has
                    never occupied the attention of the mathematicians during the time that theſe
                    ſubjects were ſo aſſiduouſly ſtudied; but ſo it is, that nothing preciſe has
                    been publiſhed on the ſubject. The only approach to a diſcuſſion of this kind,
                    is a Memoire of Mr Pitot, read to the academy of Paris in 1726, where he
                    conſt-ders the velocity of efflux through a pipe. Here, by attending to the
                    comparative ſiaperiority of the <hi rend="italic">quantity of motion</hi> in
                    large pipes, he affirms, that the total diminutions ariſing from friction will
                    be (c <hi rend="italic">uteris paribus}</hi> in the inverſe ratio of the
                    diameters. This was thankfully received by other writers, and is now a part of
                    our hydraulic theories. It has not, however, been attended to by thoſe who.
                    write on the motion of rivers, though it is evident that it is applicable to
                    theſe With equal propriety ; and had it been introduced, it would at once have
                    ſolved all their difficulties, and particularly would have ſhown how an almoſt
                    imperceptible declivity would produce the gentle motion of a great river,
                    without having recourſe to the unintelligible principle of Guglielmini.</p>
                <p>Mr Couplet made ſome experiments on the motion of the water in the great main
                    pipes of Verſailles, in order to obtain ſome notions of the retardations
                    occaſioned by friction. They were found prodigious; but were ſo irregular, and
                    unſuſceptible of reduction to any general principle, (and the experiments were
                    indeed ſo few that they were unfit for this reduction), that he could eſta-bliſh
                    no theory.—What Mr Belidor eſtabliſhed on them, and makes a ſort of ſyſtem to
                    direct future engineers, is quite unworthy of attention.</p>
                <p>Upon the whole, this branch of hydraulics, although of much greater practical
                    importance than the conduct of water in pipes, has never yet obtained more than
                    a vague, and, we may call it, ſlovenly attention from the mathematicians ; and
                    we aſcribe it to their not having taken the pains to fettle its firſt principles
                    with the fame precifion as had been done in the other branch. They were, from
                    the beginning, ſatisſied with a ſort of applicability of mathematical
                    principles, without ever making the application. Were it not that ſome would
                    accuſe us of national partiality, we would aſcribe it to this, that Newton had
                    not pointed out the way in this as in the other branch. For any intelligent
                    reader of the performances on the motions of fluids in cloſe veſ-ſels, will fee
                    that there has not a principle, nay hardly a ſtep of inveſtigation, been added
                    to thoſe which were uſed or pointed out by Sir Iſaac Newton. He has nowhere
                    touched this queſtion, the motion of water in an open canal. In his theories of
                    the tides, and of the propagation of waves, he had an excellent opportunity for
                    giving at once the fundamental principles of motion in a free fluid whoſe
                    ſurface was not horizontal But, by means of ſome of thoſe happy and ſhrewd.
                    gueſſes, in which, as Daniel Bernoulli ſays, he excelled all men, he ſaw the
                    undoubted conſequences of ſome palpable phenomenon which would anſwer all his
                    preſent. pur-poſes, and therefore entered no far ther into the inveſtigation.</p>
                <p>The original theery of Guglielmini, or the principle adopted by him, that each
                    particle of the vertical lec</p>
                <p>tion of a running ſtream has ä tendency to move as if it were iſſuing from an
                    orifice at that depth under the ſurface, is falſe ; and that it really does ſo
                    in the face of a dam when the flood-gate is taken .away, is no leſs ſo ; and if
                    it did, the ſubſequent motions would hardly have any reſemblance to thoſe which
                    he aſſigns them. Were this the caſe, the exterior form of the caſcade would be
                    ſomething like what is ſltetched in fig. 3. with an abrupt angle at B, and a
                    concave ſurface BEG. This will be evident to every one who combines the greater
                    velocity of the lower filaments with the flower motion of thoſe which muſt Aide
                    down above them. But this greater advance of the lower filaments cannot take
                    place without an expenditure of the water under the ſurface AB. The ſurface
                    therefore finks, and B inſtantly ceaſes to retain its place in the horizontal
                    plane. The water does not ſucceſſively flow forward from A to B <hi rend="sub">s</hi> , and then tumble over the precipice ; but immediately upon opening
                    the flood-gate, the water waſtes from the ſpace immediately behind it, and the
                    whole puts on the form reprefented in fig. 4. conſiſtſhg of the curve AαPfEG,
                    convex from A to c, and concave from thence forward. The ſuperficial water
                    begins to accelerate all the way from A ; and the particles may be ſuppoſed (for
                    the preſent) to have acquired the velocity correſponding to their depth under
                    the horizontal fur» face. This muſt be underſtood as nothing more than a vague
                    ſketch of the motions. It requires a very critical and intricate inveſtigation
                    to determine either the form of the upper curve or the motions of the different
                    filaments. The place A, where the curvature begins, is of equally difficult
                    determination, and is various according to the differences of depth and of
                    inclination 1 of the ſucceeding canal.</p>
                <p>We have given this ſort of hiſtory of the progreſs which had been made in this
                    part of hydraulics, that our readers might form ſome opinion of the many
                    diſ-ſertations which have been written on the motion of rivers, and of the ſtate
                    of the arts depending on it. Much of the buſineſs of the civil engineer is
                    intimately connected with it : and we may therefore believe, that ſince there
                    was ſo little principle in the theories, there could be but very little
                    certainty in the practical operations. The fact has been, that no engineer could
                    pretend to ſay, with any precifion, what would be the effect of his operations.
                    One whoſe buſineſs had given him many opportunities, and who kept accurate and
                    judicious regiſters of his own works, could pronounce, with ſome probability,
                    how much water would be brought off by a drain of certain dimenſions and a given
                    Hope, when the circumſtances of the caſe happened to tally with ſome former work
                    in which he had ſuc-ceeded or failed ; but out of the pale of his own
                    experience·, he could only make a ſagacious gueſs. A remarkable inſtance of this
                    occurred not long ago. A ſmall aqueduct was lately carried into Paris. It had
                    been conducted on a plan preſented to the academy, who had corrected it, and
                    gave a report of what its performance would be. When executed in the molt
                    accurate manner, it was deficient in the proportion of five to nine. When the
                    celebrated Deſaguliers was employed by the city of Edinburgh to ſuperintend the
                    bringing in the water for the ſupply of the city, he gave a report , on the plan
                    which was to be followed. It was executed to his complete ſatisfaction ; and the
                    quantity of</p>

                <p>water delivered was about one-ſixth of the quantity which he promiſed, and about
                    one-eleventh of the quantity which the no leſs celebrated M'Laurin calculated
                    from the ſame plan.</p>
                <p>Such being the ſtate of our theoretical knowledge (if it can be called by this
                    name), naturaliſts began to be perſuaded that it was but loſing time to make any
                    uſe of a theory ſo incongruous with obſerva-tion, and that the only ſafe method
                    of proceeding was to multiply experiments in every variety of circum-ſtances,
                    and to make a ſeries of experiments in every important caſe, which ſhould
                    comprehend all the practicable modifications of that caſe. Perhaps
                    circum-ſtances of reſemblance might occur, which would enable us to connect many
                    of them together, and at laſt diſ-cover the principles which occaſioned this
                    connection; by which means a theory founded on ſcience might be obtained. And if
                    this point ſhould not be gained, we might perhaps find a few general facts,
                    which are modified in all theſe particular caſes, in ſuch a manner that we can
                    ſtill trace the general facts, and ſee the part of the particular caſe which
                    depends on it. This would be the acquiſition of what may be called an empirical
                    theory, by which every phenomenon would be explained, in ſo far as the
                    explanation of a phenomenon is nothing more than the pointing out the general
                    fact or law under which it is comprehended; and this theory would anſwer every
                    practical purpoſe, becauſe we ſhould confidently forefee what conſequences would
                    reſult from ſuch and ſuch premiſes; or if we ſhould fail even in this, we ſhould
                    ſtill have a ſeries of experiments ſo comprehenſive, that we could tell what
                    place in the ſeries would correſpond to any particular caſe which might be
                    propoſed.</p>
                <p>There are two gentlemen, whoſe labours in this re-ſpect deſerve very particular
                    notice, profeſſor Miche-lotti at Turin, and Abbe Boſſut at Paris. The firſt made
                    a prodigious number of experiments both on the motion of water through pipes and
                    in open canals. They were performed at the expence of the ſovereign, and no
                    expence was ſpared. A tower was built of the fineſt maſonry, to ſerve as a
                    veſſel from which the water was to iſſue through holes of various ſizes, under
                    preſſures from 5 to 22 feet. The water was received into baſons conſtructed of
                    maſonry and nicely lined with ſtucco, from whence it was conveyed in canals of
                    brickwork lined with ſtucco, and of various forms and declivities. The
                    experiments on the expence of water through pipes are of all that have yet been
                    made the moſt numerous and exact, and may be appealed to on every occaſion.
                    Thoſe made in open canals are ſtill more numerous, and are no doubt equally
                    accurate; but they have not been ſo contrived as to be ſo generally uſeful,
                    being in general very unlike the important caſes which will occur in practice,
                    and they ſeem to have been contrived chiefly with the view of eſtabliih-ing or
                    overturning certain points of hydraulic doctrine which were probably prevalent
                    at the time among the practical hydrauliſts.</p>
                <p>The experiments of Boſſut are alſo of both kinds; and though on a much ſmaller
                    ſcale than thoſe of Mi-chelotti, ſeem to deſerve equal confidence. As far as
                    they follow the ſame track, they perfectly coincide in their results, which
                    ſhould procure confidence in the other; and they are made in ſituations much
                    more analogous to the uſual practical eaſts. This makes</p>
                <p>them doubly valuable, They are to be found in his two volumes intitled <hi
                        rend="italic"> Hydrodynamique.</hi> He has opened this path of procedure in
                    a manner ſo new and ſo judicious, that he has in ſome meaſure the merit of ſuch
                    as ſhall follow him in the ſame path.</p>
                <p>This has been moſt candidly and liberally allowed him by the chevalier de Buat,
                    who has taken up this matter where the Abbé Boſſut left it, and has proſe-cuted
                    his experiments with great aſſiduity; and we muſt now add with ſingular ſucceſs.
                    By a very judicious conſideration of the ſubject, he hit on a particular view of
                    it, which ſaved him the trouble of a minute conſideration of the ſmall internal
                    motions, and enabled him to proceed from a very general and evident propoſition,
                    which may be received as the key to a complete ſyſtem of practical hydraulics.
                    We ſhall follow this ingenious author in what we have farther to ſay on the
                    ſubject; and we doubt not but that our readers will think we do a ſervice to the
                    public by making theſe diſcuſ-ſions of the chevalier de Buat more generally
                    known in this country. It muſt not however be expected that we ſhall give more
                    than a ſynoptical view of them, connected by ſuch familiar reaſoning as ſhall be
                    either comprehended or confided in by perſons not deeply verſed in mathematical
                    ſcience.</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">It is certain that the motion of open ſtreams muſt, in

                        not obſtructed: but they are obſtructed, and frequently move uniformly. This
                        can only ariſe ſrom an equilibrium between the forces which promote their
                        deſcent and thoſe which oppoſe it. Mr Buat, therefore, aſſumes the leading
                        propoſition, that</hi></p>

                        accelerating force which obliges it to move is equal to the ſum of all the
                        reſiſtances which it meets with, whether ari-ſing from its own viſcidity, or
                        from the friction of its bed.</hi></p>
                <p>This law is as old as the formation of rivers, and ſhould be the key of
                    hydraulic ſcience. Its evidence is clear; and it is, at any rate, the bails of
                    all uniform motion. And ſince it is ſo, there muſt be ſome con-ſiderable analogy
                    between the motion in pipes and in open channels. Both owe their origin to an
                    inequa∙ of preſſure; both would accelerate continually, if nothing hindered; and
                    both are reduced to uniformity by the viſcidity of the fluid and the friction of
                    the channel.</p>
                <p>It will therefore be convenient to examine the phenomena of water moving in
                    pipes by the action of its weight only along the ſloping channel. But previous
                    to this, we muſt take ſome notice of the obſtruction to the entry of water into
                    a channel of any kind, ariſing. from the deflection of the many different
                    filaments which preſs into the channel from the reſervoir from every ſide. Then
                    we ſhall be able to ſeparate this diminution of motion ſrom the ſum total that
                    is obſerved, and aſcertain what part remains as produced by the ſubſequent
                    obſtructions.</p>
                <p>We then ſhall conſider the principle of uniform motion, the equilibrium between
                    the power and the re-ſiſtance. The power is the relative height of the column of
                    fluid which tends to move along the in-dined plane of its bed; the reſiſtance is
                    the friction</p>

                <p>of the bed, the viſcidity of the fluid, and its adheſion to the ſides. Here are
                    neceſſarily combined a number of circumſtances which muſt be gradually detached
                    that we may ſee the effect of each, viz. the extent of the bed, its perimeter,
                    and its ſlope. By examining the effects produced by variations of each of theſe
                    ſe-parately, we diſcover what ſhare each has in the general effect; and having
                    thus analyſed the complicated phenomenon, we ſhall be able to combine thoſe its
                    elements, and frame a formula which ſhall comprehend every circumſtance, from
                    the greateſt velocity to the extinction of all motion, and from the extent of a
                    river to the narrow dimenſions of a quill. We ſhall compare this formula with a
                    ſeries of experiments in all this variety of circumſtances, partly made by Mr
                    Buat, and partly collected from other authors; and we ſhall leave the reader to
                    judge of the agreement.</p>
                <p>Confident that this agreement will be found moſt ſa-tisfactory, we ſhall then
                    proceed to conſider very curſorily the chief varieties which nature or art may
                    introduce into theſe beds, the different velocities of the ſame ſtream, the
                    intenſity of the reſiſtance produced by the inertia of the materials of the
                    channel, and the force of the current by which it continually acts on this
                    channel, tending to change either its dimenſions or its form. We ſhall endeavour
                    to trace the origin of theſe great rivers which ſpread like the branches of a
                    vigorous tree, and occupy the ſurſace even of a vaſt continent. We ſhall follow
                    them in their courſe, unfold all their windings, ſtudy their train, and regimen,
                    and point out the law of its ſtability; and we ſhall in-veſtigate the cauſes of
                    their deviations and wanderings.</p>
                <p>The ſtudy of theſe natural laws pleaſes the mind: but it anſwers a ſtill greater
                    purpoſe; it enables us to aſſiſt nature, and to haſten her operations, which our
                    wants and our impatience often find too ſlow. It enables us to command the
                    elements, and to force them to adminiſter to our wants and our pleaſures.</p>
                <p>We ſhall therefore, in the next place, apply the knowledge which we may acquire
                    to the ſolution of the moſt important hydraulic queſtions which occur in the
                    practice of the civil engineer.</p>
                <p>We ſhall conſider the effects produced by a permanent addition to any river or
                    ſtream by the union of another, and the oppoſite effect produced by any draught
                    or offset, ſhowing the elevation or depreſſion produced up the ſtream, and the
                    change made in the depth and velocity below the addition or offset.</p>
                <p>We ſhall pay a ſimilar attention to the temporary ſwells produced by freſhes.</p>
                <p>We ſhall aſcertain the effects of ſtraightening the courſe of a ſtream, which,
                    by inereaſing its ſlope, muſt increaſe its velocity, and therefore ſink the
                    waters above the place where the curvature was removed, and diminiſh the
                    tendency to overflow, while the ſame immediate conſequence muſt expoſe the
                    places farther down to the riſk of floods from which they would otherwiſe have
                    been free.</p>
                <p>The effects of dams or weirs, and of bars, muſt then be conſidered; the gorge or
                    ſwell which they produce up the ſtream muſt be determined for every diſtance
                    from the weir or bar. This will ſurniſh us with rules for rendering navigable or
                    floatable ſuch waters as have too little depth or too great ſlope. And it will
                    appear</p>
                <p>that immenſe advantages may be thus derived, with a moderate expence, even from
                    trifling brooks, if we will relinquiſh all prejudices, and not imagine that ſuch
                    conveyance is impoſſible, becauſe it cannot be carried on by ſuch boats and
                    ſmall craft as we have been accuſtom-ed to look at.</p>
                <p>The effects of canals of derivation, the rules or ma-xims of draining, and the
                    general maxims of embankment, come in the next place; and our diſcuſſions will
                    conclude with remarks on the moſt proper forms for the entry to canals, locks,
                    docks, harbours, and mouths of rivers, the beſt ſhape for the ſtarlings of
                    bridges and of boats for inland navigations, and ſuch like ſub-ordinate but
                    intereſting particulars, which will be ſug-geſted by the general thread of
                    diſcuſſion.</p>
                <p>It is conſidered, as phyſically demonſtrated (ſee Hydrostatics and Hydraulics),
                    that water iſſuing from a ſmall orifice in the bottom or ſide of a very large
                    veſſel, almoſt inſtantly acquires and maintains the velocity which a heavy body
                    would acquire by falling to the orifice from the horizontal ſurface of the
                    ſtagnant water. This we ſhall call its Natural Velocity. Therefore if we
                    multiply the area of the orifice by this velocity, the product will be the bulk
                    or quantity of the water which is diſcharged. This we may call the Natural
                    Expence of water, or the Natural. Discharge.</p>
                <p>Let O repreſent the area or ſection of the orifice ex-preſſed in ſome known
                    meaſure, and <hi rend="italic">h</hi> its depth under the ſurface. Let <hi
                        rend="italic"> g</hi> expreſs the velocity acquired by a heavy body during
                    a ſecond by falling. Let V be the medium velocity of the water's motion, Q the
                    quantity of water diſcharged during a ſecond, and N the natural expence.</p>
                <p>We know that V is equal to <hi rend="italic">.</hi> Therefore.</p>
                <p>If theſe dimenſions be all taken in Engliſh feet, have very nearly equal to 8;
                    and therefore V =, and N=O. 8√ <hi rend="italic">h</hi></p>
                <p>But in our preſent buſineſs it is much more convenient to meaſure every thing by
                    inches. Therefore ſince a body acquires the velocity of 32 feet 2 inches in a
                    ſecond, we have 2 <hi rend="italic">g</hi> = 64 feet 4 inches or 772 inches,
                    and =27, 78 inches nearly 27 inches.</p>
                <p>Therefore V=, = 27, 78√ <hi rend="italic">h</hi> , and N=0. = O. 27, 78√ <hi
                        rend="italic"> h</hi> .</p>
                <p>But it is alſo well known, that if we were to calculate the expence or diſchage
                    for every orifice by this ſimple rule, we ſhould in every inſtance find it much
                    greater than nature really gives us.</p>
                <p>When water iſſues through a hole in a thin plate, the lateral columns, preſſing
                    into the hole from all ſides, cauſe the iſſuing filaments to converge to the
                    axis off the jet, and contract its dimenſions at a little diſtance from the
                    hole. And it is in this place of greateſt contraction that the water acquires
                    that velocity which we obſerve in our experiments, and which we aſſume as equal
                    to that acquired by falling from the ſurface. Therefore, that our computed
                    diſcharge may beſt agree with obſervation, it muſt be calculated on the
                    ſuppo-lition that the orifice is diminiſhed to the ſize of this ſmalleſt
                    ſection. But the contraction is ſubject to variations, and the dimenſions of
                    this ſmalleſt ſection</p>

                <p>are at all times difficult to aſcertain with preciſion.</p>
                <p>It is therefore much more convenient to compute from the real dimenſions of the
                    orifice, and to correct this computed diſcharge, by means of an actual
                    compariſen of the computed and effective diſcharges in a ſeries of experiments
                    made in ſituations reſembling thoſe caſes which moſt frequently occur in
                    practice. This correction or its cauſe, in the mechaniſm of thoſe internal
                    motions, is generally called Contraction by the writers on hydraulics; and it is
                    not confined to a hole in a thin plate : it happens in ſome degree in all caſes
                    where fluids are made to paſs through narrow places. It happens in the entry
                    into all pipes, canals, and ſluices ; nay even in the paſſage of water over the
                    edge of a board, ſuch as is uſually ſet up on the head of a dam or weir, and
                    even when this is immerſed in water on both ſides, as in a bar or keep,
                    frequently employed ſor raiſing the waters of the level ſtreams in Flanders, in

                    face of the bar, and then rapidly fly over its top. We have attempted to
                    repreſent this motion of the filaments in theſe different fιtuation6. Fig. 5. A
                    ſhows the motion through a thin plate.</p>
                <p>B ſhows the motion when a tube of about two diameters long is added, and when
                    the water flows with a full .mouth. This does not always happen in ſo ſhort a
                    pipe (and never in one that is ſhorter), but the water frequently detaches
                    itſelf from the ſides of the pipe, and flows with a contracted jet.</p>
                <p>C ſhows the motion when the pipe projects into the inſide of the veſſel. In this
                    caſe it is difficult to make it flow full.</p>
                <p>D repreſents a mouth-piece fitted to the hole, and formed agreeably to that
                    ſhape which a jet would aſ-ſume of itſelf. In this caſe all contraction is
                    avoided, becauſe the mouth of this pipe may be conſidered as the real orifice,
                    and nothing now diminiſhes the diſcharge but a trifling friction of the ſides.</p>
                <p>E ſhows the motion of water over a dam or weir, where the fall is free or
                    unobſtructed ; the ſurface of the lower ſtream being lower than the edge or ſole
                    of the waſte-board.</p>
                <p>F is a ſimilar repreſentation of the motion of water over what we would call a <hi rend="italic">bar</hi> or <hi rend="italic">keep.</hi></p>
                <p>It was one great aim of the experiments of Michelotti and Boffut to determine
                    the effects of contraction in theſe caſes. Michelotti, after carefully obſerving
                    the ,form and :dimenſions of the natural jet, made various mouth-pieces
                    reſembling it, till he obtained one which produced the ſmalleſt diminution of
                    the computed diſcharge, or till the diſcharge computed for the area of its
                    ſmaller end approached the neareſt to the effective diſcharge. And he at laſt
                    obtained one which gave a diſcharge of 983, when the natural diſcharge would
                    have been 1000. This piece was formed by the revolution of a trochoid round the
                    axis of the jet, and the dimenſions were as follow :</p>
                <p>Diameter of the outer orifice = 36</p>
                <p>---inner orifice = 46</p>
                <p>Length of the axis ≈ 96</p>
                <p>The reſults of the experiments of the Abbé Boſſiit and of Michelotti ſcarcely

                <p>The numbers in the laſt column of this little table are the cubical inches of
                    water diſcharged in a ſecond when the height <hi rend="italic">h</hi> is one
                    inch.</p>
                <p>It muſt be obſerved that the diſcharges aſſigned here for the weir and bar
                    relate only to the contractions oc-cafioned by the paſſage over the edge of the
                    board. The weir may alſo ſuffer a diminution by the contractions at its two
                    ends, if it ſhould be narrower than the ſtream, which is generally the caſe,
                    becauſe the two ends are commonly of ſquare maſonry or woodwork. Tſhe
                    contraction there is nearly the ſame with that at the edge of a thin plate. But
                    this could not be introduced into this table, becauſe its effect on the expence
                    is the ſame in quantity whatever is the length of the waſte-board of the weir.</p>
                <p>In like manner, the diminution of diſcharge through a ſluice could not be
                    expreſſed here. When a ſluice is drawn up, but its lower edge ſtill remains
                    under water, the diſcharge is contracted both above and at the ſides, and the
                    diminution of diſcharge by each is in proportion to its extent. It is not eaſy
                    to reduce either of theſe contractions to computation, but they may be very
                    eaſily obſerved. We frequently can obſerve the water, at coming out of a ſluice
                    into a mill-courſe, quit the edge of the aperture, and ſhow a part of the bottom
                    quite dry. This is always the caſe when the velocity of efflux is conſiderable.
                    When it is very moderate, this place is occupied by an eddy water almoſt
                    ſtagnant. When the head of water is 8 or ϊθ inches, and runs off freely, the
                    ſpace left between it and the ſides is about 14- inches. If the ſides of the
                    entry have a ſlope, this void ſpace can never appear ; but there is always this
                    t endency to convergence, which diminiſhes the quantity of the diſcharge.</p>
                <p>It will frequently abridge computation very much to conſider the water
                    diſcharged in theſe different ſituations as moving with a common velocity, which
                    we con ceive as produced not by a fall from the ſurface of the fluid (which is
                    exact only when the expence is equal to the natural expence), but by a fall <hi
                        rend="italic"> h</hi> accommodated to the diſcharge r or it is convenient
                    to know the height which would produce that very velocity which the water iſſues
                    with in theſe ſituations.</p>
                <p>And alſo, when the water is obſerved to be actually moving with a velocity V,
                    and we know whether it is coming through a thin plate, through a tube, over a
                    dam, &amp;c. it is neceſſary to know the preſſure or head of water <hi
                        rend="italic"> h</hi> which has actually produced this velocity. It is
                    convenient therefore to have the following numbers in readineſs.</p>

                <p>It was neceſſary to premiſe theſe facts in hydraulics, that we may be able in
                    every caſe to diſtinguiſh between the force expended in the entry of the water
                    into the conduit or canal, and the force employed in overcoming the reſiſtances
                    along the canal, and in pre-ſerving or accelerating its motion in it.</p>
                <p>The motion of running water is produced by two cauſes ; I. The action of
                    gravity; and, 2. The mobility of the particles, which makes them aſſume a level
                    in confined veſſels, or determines them to move to that fide where there is a
                    defect of preſſure. When the ſur-face is level, every particle is at reſt, being
                    equally preſ-ſed in all directions ; but if the ſurface 13 not level, not only
                    does a particle on the very ſurface tend by its own weight towards the lower
                    ſide, as a body would Aide along an inclined plane, but there is a force,
                    external to itſelf, ariſing from a ſuperiority of preſſure on the upper -end of
                    the ſurface, which puſhes this ſuperficial particle towards the lower end ; and
                    this is not peculiar to the ſuperficial particles, but affects every particle
                    within the maſs of water. In the veſſel ACHE fſig. 6. ), containing water with
                    an inclined ſurface AE, if <hi rend="italic">we</hi> ſuppoſe all frozen but
                    the extreme columns AKHB, FGLE, and a connecting portion HKCDLG, it is evident,
                    from hydroſtatical laws, that the water on this connecting part will be puſhed
                    in the direction CD ; and if the frozen maſs BHGF were moveable, it would alſo
                    be puſhed along. Giving it fluidity will make no change in this reſpect ; and it
                    is indifferent what is the ſituation and ſhape of the connecting column or
                    columns. The propelling force (MNF being horizontal) is the weight of the column
                    AMNB. The ſame thing will obtain wherever we ſelect the vertical columns. There
                    will always be a force tending to puſh every particle of water in the direction
                    of the declivity. The conſequence will be, that the water will link at one end
                    and riſe at the other, and its ſurface will reſt in the horizontal poſition <hi
                        rend="italic"> a</hi> O <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> cutting the former in
                    its middle O. This cannot be unleſs there be not only a motion of perpendicular
                    deſcent and aſcent of the vertical columns, but alſo a real motion of
                    tranſlation from K towards L. It perhaps exceeds our mathematical ſlcill to tell
                    what will be the motion of each particle. Newton did not attempt it in his
                    inveſtigation of the motion of waves, nor is it at all neceſſary here. We may,
                    however, acquire a very diſtinct notion of its general effect. Let OPQJre a
                    vertical plane paſſing through the middle point O. It is evident that every
                    particle in PQ, ſuch f,s P, is preſſed in the direction QD, with a force equal
                    to the weight of a ſingle row of particles, whoſe length is the difference
                    between the columns BH and FG. The force acting on the particle Q_is, in like
                    manner, the weight of a row of particles =AC—ED. Now if OQ <hi rend="sub">j</hi> OA, OE, be divided in the ſame ratio, ſo that all the figures ACDE, BHGF,
                    &amp;c. may beſimilar, we ſee that the force ariſing ſolely from the
                    declivity, and acting on each particle on the plane is proportional to its depth
                    under the ſurface, and that the row of particles ACQDE, BHPGF, &amp;c. which
                    is to be moved by it, is in the ſame proportion. Hence it un-queſtionably
                    follows, that the accelerating force on each particle of the row is the ſame in
                    all. Therefore the whole plane OQ__ tends to advance forward together with the
                    ſame velocity ; and in the inſtant immediately ſucceeding, all theſe particles
                    would be found again in a vertical plane indefinitely near to OQ; and if we ſum
                    up the forces, we ſhallfind them the ſame as if OQ were the opening of a ſluice,
                    having the water on the ſide of D ſtanding level with O, and the water on the
                    other ſide ſtanding at the height AC. This reſult is extremely different from
                    that of the haſty theory of Gugiielmini. He conſiders each particle in OQ as
                    urged by an accelerating force proportional to its depth, ft is true ; but he
                    makes it <hi rend="italic">equal</hi> to the weight of the row OP, and never
                    recollects that the greateſt part of it is balanced by an oppoſite preſſure, nor
                    perceives that the force which is not balanced muſt be diſtributed among a row
                    of particles which varies in the ſame proportion with itſelf. When theſe two
                    circumſtances are neglected, the reſult muſt be incompatible with obſer-vation.
                    When the balanced forces are taken into the account of preſſure, it is evident
                    that the ſurface may be ſuppoſed horizontal, and that motion ſhould obtain in
                    this caſe as well as in the caſe of a ſloping ſurface : and indeed this is
                    Guglielmini’s profeſſed theory, and what he highly values himſelf on. He
                    announces this diſcovery of a new principle, which he calls the energy of deep
                    waters, as an important addition to hydraulics. It is owing to this, ſays he.
                    that the great rivers are not ſtagnant at their mouths, where they have no
                    perceptible declivity of ſurface, but, on the contrary, have greater energy and
                    velocity than farther up, where they are ſhallower. This principle is the baſis
                    of his improved theory of rivers, and is infiſted on at great length by all the
                    ſubfequent writers. Buffon, in his theory of the earth, makes much uſe of it. We
                    cannot but wonder that it has been allowed a place in the theory of rivers given
                    in the great <hi rend="italic">Encyclopédie</hi> of Paris, and in an article
                    having the ſignature (O-) of D’Alembert. We have been very anxious to ſhow the
                    falſity of this principle, becauſe we conſider it as a mere ſubterfuge of
                    Gugiielmini, by which he was able to patch up the mathematical theory which he
                    had ſo haſtily taken from Newton or Galileo ; and we think that we have ſecu-rεd
                    our readers from being miſled by it, when we ſhow that this energy muſt be
                    equally operative when the ſurface 16 on a dead level. The abſurdity of this is
                    evident. We ſhall ſee by and by, that deep waters, when in actual motion, have
                    an energy not to be found in ſhallow running waters, by which they are enabled
                    to continue that motion : but this is not a moving principle ; and it will be
                    fully explained, as an immediate reſult of principles, not vaguely conceived and
                    indi- . ſtinctly expreſſed, like this of Gugliélmini, but eaſily un-derſtood,
                    and appreciable with the greateſt preciſion. It is an energy common t-o all
                    great bodies. Although they lofe as much momentum in ſurmounting any ob-ſtacle
                    as ſmall ones, they loſe but a ſmall portion of their velocity. At preſent,
                    employed only in conſider-</p>

                <p>ing the progreſſive motion of an open ſtream, whoſe ſurface is not level, it is
                    quite enough that we ſee that ſuch a motion muſt obtain, and that we ſee that
                    there are propelling forces ; and that thoſe forces ariſe <hi rend="italic">ſolely</hi> from the want of a level ſurface, or from the ſlope of the
                    ſurſace ; and that, with reſpect to any one particle, the force acting on it is
                    proportional to the difference of level between each of the two columns (one on
                    each ſide of the particle) which produce it. Were the ſurface level, there would
                    be no motion ; if it is not level, there will be motion ; and this motion will
                    be proportional to the want of level or the declivity of the ſurface <hi

                    or not, or what is its ſhape.</p>
                <p>Hence we draw a fundamental principle, that <hi rend="italic">the motion of
                        rivers depends entirely on the ſlope of the ſur-</hi></p>

                <p>The slope or declivity of any inclined plane is not properly expreſſed by the
                    difference of height alone of its extremities ; we muſt alſo conſider its length
                    : and the meaſure of the ſlope muſt be ſuch that it may be the ſame while the
                    declivity is the ſame. It muſt therefore be the ſame over the whole of any one
                    inclined plane. We ſhall anſwer theſe conditions exactly, if we take for the
                    meaſure of a ſlope the fraction which ex-preſſes the elevation of one extremity
                    above the other</p>
                <p>divided by the length of the plane. Thus will AF</p>

                <p>If the water met with no reſiſtance from the bed in which it runs, if it had no
                    adheſion to its ſides and bottom, and if its fluidity were perfect, its gravity
                    would accelerate its courſe continually, and the earth and its inhabitants would
                    be deprived of all the advantages which they derive from its numberleſs ſtreams.
                    They would run off ſo quickly, that our fields, dried up as ſoon as watered,
                    would be barren and uſeleſs. No ſoil could reſiſt the impetuoſity of the
                    torrents ; and their accelerating force would render them a deſtroying ſcourge,
                    were it not that, by kind Providence, the reſiſtance of the bed, and the
                    viſcidity of the fluid, become a check which reins them in and ſets bounds to
                    their rapidity. In this manner the friction on the ſides, which, by the
                    viſcidity of the water, is communicated to the whole maſs, and the very adheſion
                    of the particles to each other, and to the ſides of the channel, are the cauſes
                    which make the reſiſtances bear a relation to the velocity ; ſo that the
                    reſiſtances augmenting with the velocities, come at laſt to balance the
                    accelerating force. Then the velocity now acquired is preſerved, and the motion
                    becomes uniform, without being able to acquire new increaſe, unleſs ſome change
                    ſucceeds either in the ſlope or in the capacity of the channel. Hence ariſes the
                    ſecond maxim in the motion of rivers, that <hi rend="italic">when a ſtream
                        moves uniformly, the reſiſtance is equal to the accelerating force.</hi></p>
                <p>As in the efflux of water through orifices, we pafs over the very beginnings of
                    the accelerated motion, which is a matter of ſpeculative curioſity, and conſider
                    the motion in a ſtate of permanency, depending on the head of water, the area of
                    the orifice, the velocity, and the expence ; ſo, in the theory of the uniform
                    motion of rivers, we conſider the ſlope, the tranſverſe fection or area of the
                    ſtream, the uniform velocity, and the ex</p>
                <p>pence. It will be convenient to affix preciſe meanings to the terms which we
                    ſhall employ.</p>
                <p>The section of a ſtream is the area of a plane per* pendicular to the direction
                    of the general motion.</p>
                <p>The reſiſtances ariſe ultimately from the action of the water on the internal
                    ſurſace of the channel, and muſt be proportional <hi rend="italic">( firteris
                        paribus )</hi> to the extent of the action. Therefore if we unfold the
                    whole edge of this ſection, which is rubbed as it were by the paſſing water, we
                    ſhall have a meaſure of the extent of this action. In a pipe, circular or
                    priſmatical, the whole circumference is acted on; but in a river or canal ACDQ
                    (fig. 6.) the horizontal line <hi rend="italic">a</hi> O <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> which makes the upper boundary of the ie&lt;5tiυn <hi rend="italic">a</hi> Cl) <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> is free from all action. The action is
                    confined to the three lines <hi rend="italic">a</hi> C, CD, D <hi
                        rend="italic"> e.</hi> We ſhall call this line <hi rend="italic">a</hi> CD <hi rend="italic">e</hi> the border of the ſection.</p>
                <p>The mean velocity is that with which the whole ſection, moving equally, would
                    generate a ſolid equal to the expence of the ſtream. This velocity is to be
                    found perhaps but in one filament of the ſtream, and we do not know in which
                    filament it is to be found.</p>
                <p>Since we are attempting to eſtabliſh an empirical theory of the motion of
                    rivers, founded entirely on experiment and palpable deductions from them ; and
                    ſince it is extremely difficult to make experiments on open ſtreams which ſhall
                    have a preciſion ſufficient for ſuch an important purpoſe—it would be a moil
                    deſirable thing to demonſtrate an exact analogy between the mutual balancing of
                    the acceleration and reſiſtance irι pipes and in rivers ; for in thoſe we can
                    not only make experiments with all the deſired accuracy, and admitting preciſe
                    meaſures, but we can make them in a number of caſes that are almoſt
                    impracticable in rivers. We can increaſe the ſlope of a pipe from nothing to the
                    vertical poſition, and we can employ every deſired degree of preſſure, ſo as to
                    aſcertain its effect on the velocity in degrees which open ſtreams will not
                    admit. The Chevalier de Buat has moſt happily ſucceeded in this
                    demonſtration;-and it is here that his good fortune and his penetration have
                    done ſo much ſervice to practical ſcience.</p>
                <p>Let AB (fig. 7.) be a horizontal tube, through which the water is impelled by
                    the preſſure or head DA. This head is the moving power ; and it may be conceived
                    as conliſting of two parts, performing two diſtinct offices. One of them is
                    employed in impreſ-ſing on the water that velocity with which it <hi
                        rend="italic"> actually moves</hi> in the tube. Were there no obſtructions
                    to this motion, no greater head would be wanted ; but there are obſtructions
                    ariſing from friction, adheſion, and viſcidity. This requires force. Let this be
                    the office of the reſt of the head of water in the reſervoir. There is but one
                    allotment, appropriation, or repartition, of the whole head which will anſwer.
                    Suppoſe E to be the point of partition, ſo that DE is the head neceſſary for
                    impreſſing the actual velocity on the water (a head or preſſure which has a
                    relation to the form or circumſtance of the entry, and the contraction which
                    takes place there). The reſt EA is wholly employed in overcoming the
                    ſimultaneous reſiſtances which take place along the whole tube AB, and is in
                    equilibrio with this reſiſtance. Therefore if we apply at E a tube EC of the
                    ſame length and diameter with AB,</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0267" facs="gri_33125011196389_0273.tif"/>
                <p>and having the ſame degree of poliſh or roughneſs; and if this tube be inclined
                    in ſuch a manner that the axis of its extremity may coincide with the axis of AB
                    in the point C—we affirm that the velocity will be the ſame in both pipes, and
                    that they will have the ſame expence; for the moving force in the ſloping pipe
                    EC is compoſed of the whole weight of the column DE and the relative weight of
                    the column EC; but this relative weight, by which alone it deſcends along the
                    inclined pipe EC, is preciſely equal to the weight of a vertical column EA of
                    the ſame diameter. Everything therefore is equal in the two pipes, <hi
                        rend="italic"> viz.</hi> the lengths, the diameters, the moving forces, and
                    the reſiſtances; therefore the velocities and diſcharges will alſo be equal.</p>
                <p>This is not only the caſe on the whole, but alſo in every part of it. The
                    relative weight of any part of it EK is preciſely in equilibrio with the
                    reſiſtances along that part of the pipe; for it has the ſame proportion to the
                    whole relative weight that the reſiſtance lias to the whole reſiſtance.
                    Therefore ( <hi rend="italic">and this is the moſt important circumſtance, and
                        the balls of the whole theory )</hi> the pipe EC may be cut ſhorter, or may
                    be lengthened to infinity, without making any change in the velocity or expence,
                    ſo long as the propelling head DE remains the ſame.</p>
                <p>Leaving the whole head DA as it is, if we lengthen the horizontal pipe AB to G,
                    it is evident that we increaſe the reſiſtance without any addition of force to
                    overcome it. The velocity muſt therefore be diminiſh-ed; and it will now be a
                    velocity which is produced by a ſmaller head than DE: therefore if we were to
                    put in a pipe of equal length at E, terminating in the horizontal line AG, the
                    water will not run equally in both pipes. In order that it may, we muſt diſcover
                    the diminiſhed velocity with which the water now actually runs along AG, and we
                    muſt make a head DI capable of impreſſing this velocity at the entry of the
                    pipe, and then inſert at I a pipe IH of the ſame length with AG. The expence and
                    velocity of both pipes will now be the ſame <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                        diſtribution or allotment of the different portions of the preſſure very
                        familiar to his mind. It is of the moſt extenſive influence in every
                        queſtion of hydraulics, and will on every occaſion give him diſtinct
                        conceptions of the internal procedure. Obvious as the thought ſeems to be,
                        it has eſcaped the attention of all the writers on the ſubject. Lecchi, in
                        his <hi rend="italic">Hydraulics</hi> publiſhed in 1766, aſcribes
                        ſomething like it to Daniel Bernoulli; but Bernoulli, in the paſſage quoted,
                        only ſpeaks of the partition of preſſure in the inſtant of opening an
                        orifice. Part of it, ſays he, is employed in accelerating the quieſcent
                        water, and producing the velocity of efflux, and the remainder produces the
                        preſſure (now diminiſhed) on the ſides of the veſſel. Bernoulli, Boſſut, and
                        all the good writers, make this diſtribution in expreſs terms in their
                        explanation of the motion of water through ſucceſſive orifices; and it is
                        ſurpriſing that no one before the Chevalier de Buat ſaw that the reſiſtance
                        ariſing from friction required a ſimilar partition of the preſſure; but
                        though we ſhould call this good fortune, we muſt aſcribe to his great
                        ſagacity and juſtneſs of conception the beautiful uſe that he has made of
                        it: " <hi rend="italic">ſuum cuique.</hi>"</note>.</p>
                <p>What, has now been ſaid of a horizontal pipe AB would have been equally true of
                    any inclined pipe AB, A'B (fig. 8. ) Drawing the horizontal line CB, we ſee that
                    DC is the whole head or propelling preſſure for either pipe AB or A'B; and if DE
                    is the head neceſſary for the actual velocity, EC is the head neceſſary for
                    balancing the reſiſtances; and the pipe EF of the ſame length with AB, and
                    terminating in the ſame horizontal line, will have the ſame velocity; and its
                    inclination being thus determined, it will have the ſame velocity and expence
                    whatever be its length.</p>
                <p>Thus we ſee that the motion in any pipe, horizontal or ſloping, may be referred
                    to or ſubſtituted for the motion in another inclined pipe, whoſe head of water,
                    above the place of entry, is that productive of the actual velocity of the water
                    in the pipe. Now, in this caſe, the accelerating force is equal to the
                    reſiſtance: we may therefore conſider this laſt pipe as a river, of which the
                    bed and the ſlope are uniform or conſtant, and the current in a ſtate of
                    permanency; and we now may clearly draw this important concluſion, that pipes
                    and open ſtreams, when in a ſtate of permanency, perfectly reſemble each other
                    in the circumſtances which are the immediate cauſes of this permanency. The
                    equilibrium between the accelerating force obtains not only in general, but
                    takes place through the whole length of the pipe or ſtream, and is predicable of
                    every individual tranſverſe ſection of either. To make this more palpably
                    evident if poſſible, let us conſider a ſloping cylindrical pipe, the current of
                    which is in a ſtate of permanency. We can conceive it as conſiſting of two half
                    cylinders, an upper and a lower. Theſe are running together at an equal pace;
                    and the filaments of each immediately contiguous to the ſeparating plane and to
                    each other, are not rubbing on each other, nor affecting each others motions in
                    the ſmalleſt degree. It is true that the upper half is preſſing on the lower,
                    but in a direction perpendicular to the motion, and therefore not affecting the
                    velocity; and we ſhall ſee preſently, that although the lower ſide of the pipe
                    bears ſomewhat more preſſure than the other, the reſiſtances are not changed. (
                    Indeed this odds of preſſure is accompanied with a difference of motion, which
                    need not be conſidered at preſent; and we may ſuppoſe the pipe ſo ſmall or ſo
                    far below the ſurface, that this ſhall be in-ſenſible). Now let us ſuppoſe, that
                    in an inſtant the upper half cylinder is annihilated: We then have an open
                    ſtream; and every circumſtance of accelerating force and of reſiſtance remains
                    preciſely as it was. The motion muſt therefore continue as it did; and in this
                    ſtate the only accelerating force is the ſlope of the ſurface. The demonſtration
                    therefore is complete.</p>
                <p>From theſe obſervations and reaſonings we draw a general and important
                    concluſion, “ That the ſame pipe will be ſuſceptible of different velocities,
                    which it will preſerve uniform to any diſtance, according as it has different
                    inclinations; and each inclination of a pipe of given diameter has a certain
                    velocity peculiar to itſelf, which will be maintained uniform to any diſtance</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0268" facs="gri_33125011196389_0274.tif"/>
                <p>whatever; and this velocity increaſes continually, according to ſome law, to be
                    diſcovered by theory or experiment, as the poſition of the pipe changes, from
                    being horizontal till it becomes vertical; in which poſition it has the greateſt
                    uniform velocity poſſible relative to its inclination, or depending on
                    inclination alone.</p>
                <p>Let this velocity be called the train, or the rate of each pipe.</p>
                <p>It is evident that this principle is of the utmoſt conſequence in the theory of
                    hydraulics ; for by experiment we can find the train of any pipe. It is in train
                    when an increaſe of length makes no change in the velocity. If lengthening the
                    pipe increaſes the velocity, the ſlope of the pipe is too great, and <hi
                        rend="italic"> vice verſa.</hi> And having diſcovered the train of a pipe,
                    and obſerved its velocity, and computed the head productive of this velocity
                    with the contraction at the entry, the remainder of the head, that is, the ſlope
                    (for this is equivalent to EA), is the meaſure of the reſiſtance. Thus we obtain
                    the meaſure of the reſiſtance to the motion with a given velocity in a pipe of
                    given diameter. If we change only the velocity, we get the meaſure of the new
                    reſiſtance relative to the velocity ; and thus diſcover the law of relation
                    between the reſiſtance and velocity. Then, changing only the diameter of the
                    pipe, we get the meaſure of the reſiſtance relative to the diameter. This is the
                    aim of a prodigious number of experiments made and collected by Buat, and which
                    we , ſhall not repeat, but only give the reſults of the' different parts of his
                    inveſtigation.</p>
                <p>We may expreſs the ſlope of a pipe by the ſymbol</p>
                <p>2, I being an inch for inſtance, and j being the ſlant <hi rend="italic">s</hi></p>
                <p>length of a pipe which is one inch more elevated at one end than at the other.
                    Thus a river which has a declivity of an inch and a half in 120 fathoms or 8640</p>
                <p>inches, has its ſlope = -ſ -, or ——. But in order 8640 5760</p>
                <p>to obtain the hydraulic ſlope of a conduit pipe, the h,eights of the reſervoir
                    and place of diſcharge being given, we muſt ſubtract from the difference of
                    elevation the height or head of water neceſſary for propelling the water into
                    any pipe with the velocity V, which it is V <hi rend="sup">1</hi></p>
                <p>ſuppoſed actually to have. This is ——. The remainder <hi rend="italic">d</hi> is to be conſidered as the height of the declivity, which is to be diſtributed
                    equally over the whole length ∕ of the pipe, and the ſlope is then -, = -.</p>
                <p>There is another important view to be taken of the ſlope, which the reader
                    ſhould make very familiar to his thoughts. It expreſſes the proportion between
                    the weight of the whole column which is in motion and the weight which is
                    employed in overcoming the reſiſtance ; and the reſiſtance to the motion of any
                    column of water is equal to the weight of that column multiplied by the</p>
                <p>fraction 2, which expreſſes its ſlope. f.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">We come now to conſider more particularly the reſiſtances
                        which in this manner bring the motions to a ſtate of uniformity. If we
                        conſider the reſiſtances which ariſe from a cauſe analogous to friction, we
                        ſee that they muſt depend entirely on the inertia of the</hi></p>
                <p>water. What we call the reſiſtance is the diminution of a motion which <hi
                        rend="italic"> would</hi> have obtained but for theſe reſiſtances ; and the
                    beſt way we have of meaſuring them is by the force which we muſt employ in order
                    to keep up or reſtore this motion. We eſtimate this motion by a progreſſive
                    velocity, which we meaſure by the expence of water in a given time. We judge the
                    velocity to diminiſh, when the quantity diſcharged di-miniſhes ; yet it may be
                    otherwiſe, and probably is otherwiſe. The abſolute velocity of many, if not all,
                    of the particles, may even be increaſed ; but many of the motions, being
                    tranſverſe to the general direction, the quantity of motion in this direction
                    may be leſs, while the ſum of the abſolute motions of all the particles may be
                    greater. When we increaſe the general velocity, it is not unreaſonable to
                    ſuppoſe that the im-pulſes on all the inequalities are increaſed in this
                    proportion ; and the number of particles thus impelling and deflected at the
                    ſame time will increaſe in the ſame proportion. The whole quantity therefore of
                    theſe uſeleſs and loſt motions will increaſe in the duplicate ratio of the
                    velocities, and the force neceſſary for keeping up the motion will do ſo alſo ;
                    that is, the reſiſtances ſhould increaſe as the ſquares of the velocities.</p>
                <p>Or if we conſider the reſiſtances as ariſing merely from the curvature of the
                    imperceptible internal motions occaſioned by the inequalities of the ſides of
                    the pipe, and as meaſured by the forces neceſſary for producing theſe
                    curvilineal motions ; then, becauſe the curves will be the ſame whatever are the
                    velocities, the deflecting forces will be as the ſquares of the velocities; but
                    theſe deflecting forces are preſſures, propagated from the parts urged or
                    preſſed by the external force, and are proportional to theſe external preſſures
                    by the principles of hydroſtatics. Therefore the preſſures or forces neceſſary
                    for keeping up the velocities are as the ſquares of theſe velocities ; and they
                    are our only meaſures of the reſiſtances which muſt be conſidered as following
                    the ſame ratio. Whatever view therefore we take of the nature of theſe
                    reſiſtances, we are led to conſider them as proportional to the ſquares of the
                    velocities.</p>
                <p>We may therefore expreſs the reſiſtances by the ſymbol ~, <hi rend="italic">m</hi> being ſome number to be diſcovered by experiment. Thus, in a particular
                    pipe, the diminution of the motion or the reſiſtance may be the 1000th part of
                    the ſquare of the velocity, and R = <hi rend="sub">i</hi> ' <hi rend="sub">qq</hi> "</p>
                <p>Now if <hi rend="italic">g</hi> be the accelerating power of gravity on any

                <p>it would urge it down the pipe whoſe ſlope is “. Therefore, by the principle of
                    uniform motion, the equality of the accelerating force, and the reſiſtance, we
                    ſhall have V* £ _</p>

                <p>Mr Buat therefore examined this by experiment, but found, that even with re
                    ſpect to a pipe or channel which was uniform throughout, this was not true. We
                    could give at once the final formula which he found to expreſs the velocity in
                    every caſe whatever ; but this would be too empirical. The chief ſteps of his
                    very ſa-gacious inveſtigation are inſtructive. We ſhall therefore mention them
                    briefly, at leaſt as far as they tend to give us any collateral information ;
                    and let it always be noted, that the inſtruction which they convey is not
                    abſtract ſpeculation, but experimental truths, which muſt ever remain as an
                    addition to our ltock of knowledge, although Mr Buat’s deductions from them
                    ſhould prove falſe.</p>
                <p>He found, in the firſt place, that in the fame channel the product of V and √7

                    increaſed faſter than the ſquare roots of the ſlope, or the reſiſtances did not
                    increaſe as fall as the ſquares of the velocities. We beg leave to refer our
                    readers to what we ſaid on the reſiſt-ance of pipes to the motion of fluids
                    through them, in the article Pneumatics, when ſpeaking of bellows. They will

                <p>tual velocity V of a pipe or channel which is in train.</p>
                <p>Mr Buat, after many trials and reflections, the chief of which will be mentioned
                    by and by, found a value of X which correſponded with a vaſt variety of Hopes
                    and velocities, from motions almoſt imperceptible, in a bed nearly horizontal,
                    to the greateſt velocities which could be produced by gravity alone in a
                    vertical pipe; and when he compared them together, he found a very diſcernible
                    relation between the reſiſtances and the magnitude of the ſection : that is,
                    that in two channel# which had the ſame ſlope, and the ſame propelling force,
                    the velocity was greateſt in the channel which had the greateſt ſection relative
                    to its border. This may reaſonably be expected. The reſiſtances' ariſe from the
                    mutual action of the water and this border. The water immediately contiguous to
                    it is retarded, and this retards the next, and ſo on. It is to be expected,
                    therefore, that if the border, and the velocity, and the ſlope, be the ſame, the
                    diminution of this velocity will be ſo much the leſs as it is to be ſhared among
                    a greater number of particles ; that is, as the area of the ſection is greater
                    in proportion to the extent of its border. The diminution of the general or
                    medium velocity muſt be leſs· in a cylindrical pipe than in a ſquar-e one of the
                    ſame area, becauſe the border of its ſection is leſs.</p>
                <p>It appears evident, that the reſiſtance of each particle is in the direct
                    proportion of the whole reſiſtance, and the inverſe proportion of the number of
                    particles which receive equal lhares of-it. It-is therefore directly as the</p>
                <p>border, and inverſely as the ſection. Therefore in the V* . '</p>
                <p>expreſſion — which we have given for the reſiſtance,</p>
                <p>the quantity <hi rend="italic">m</hi> cannot be conſtant, except in the ſame
                    channel ; and in different channels it muſt vary along with the relation of the
                    ſection to its border, becauſe the reſiſtances diminiſh in proportion as this
                    relation increaſes.</p>
                <p>Without attempting to diſcover this relation by theoretical examination of the
                    particular motions of the various filaments, Mr Buat endeavoured to diſcover it
                    by a compariſon of experiments. But this required ſome manner of ſtating this
                    proportion between the augmentation of the ſection and the augmentation of its
                    border.</p>
                <p>His ſtatement is this : He reduces every ſection to a rectangular parallelogram
                    of the ſame area, and having its baſe equal to the border unfolded into a
                    ſtraight line. The product of this baſe by the height of the rectangle will be
                    equal to the area of the lection. I herefore this height will be a
                    repreſentative of this variable ratio of the ſection to its border (We do not
                    mean that there is any ratio between a ſurface and a line : but the ratio of
                    fection to ſection is different from that of border to border ; and it is the
                    ratio of theſe ratios which is thus expreſſed by the height of this rectangle).
                    If S be the ſection, and B the border, is evidently a line equal to the height
                    of this rectangle. Every ſection being in this manner reduced to a rectangle,
                    the perpendicular height of it may be called the hydraulic mean depth of the
                    ſection, and may be expreſſed by the ſymbol <hi rend="italic">d.</hi> (Buat
                    calls it the mean radius), If the channel be a cylindrical pipe, or an open half
                    cylinder, it is evident that <hi rend="italic">d</hi> is half the radius. If
                    the ſection is a rectangle, wlioſe width is <hi rend="italic">ιυ,</hi> and
                    height <hi rend="italic">h,</hi> the mean depth is , &amp;c. In general,
                    if <hi rend="italic">q</hi> re-prefent the proportion of the breadth of a
                    rectangular canal to its depth, that is, if y be made = -v , we ſhall</p>

                <p>ſhould be a conſtant quantity in every caſe. -</p>
                <p>Our author was aware, however, of a very ſpecious objection to the cloſe
                    dependence of the reſiſtance on the extent of the border ;, and that it might be
                    ſaid that a double border did not occaſion a double refill-ance, unleſs the
                    preſſure on all the parts was the ſame. For it may be naturally (and it is
                    generally) ſuppoſed, that the reſiſtance will be greater when the preſſure is
                    greater. The friction or reſiſtance analogous to friction may therefore bè
                    greater on an inch of the bottom than on an inch of the ſides ; but Mr.
                    D’Alembert and many others have demonſtrated, that the paths of the filaments
                    will be. the ſame whatever be the preſſures:</p>

                <p>This might Γerve to juſtify our ingenious author ; but he was determined to reſt
                    every thing on experiment. He therefore made an experiment on the oſcillation of
                    water in ſyphons, which we have repeated in the following form, which is
                    affected by the ſame circumſtances, and is ſuſceptible of much greater
                    preciſion, and of more extenſive and important application.</p>
                <p>The two veſſels ABCD, <hi rend="italic">abed</hi> (fig. 9.) were connected by
                    the ſyphon E F G <hi rend="italic">gfe,</hi> which turned round .jn the ſhort
                    tubes E and r, without allowing any water to eſcape 5 the axes of theſe tubes
                    being in one ſtraight line. The veſſels were about 10 inches deep, and the
                    branches FG, <hi rend="italic">f</hi> <hi rend="italic">g</hi> of the ſyphon were about five feet long. The veſſels
                    were ſet on two tables of equal height, and (the hole <hi rend="italic">e</hi> being flopped) the veſſel ABCD, and the whole ſyphon, were filled with water,
                    and water was poμred into the veſſel <hi rend="italic">abed</hi> till it ſtood
                    at a certain height LM. The ſyphon was then turned into a horizontal poſition,
                    and the plug drawn out of <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> and the time -carefully
                    noted which the water employed in riſing to the level f!KI <hi rend="italic">h</hi> in both veſſels. The whole apparatus was now inclined, ſo that the water
                    run back into ABCD. The ſyphon was now put in a vertical poſition, and the
                    experiment was repeated. —No ſenſible or regular difference was obſerved in the
                    time. Yet in this experiment the preſſure on the part Gg of the ſyphon was more
                    than fix times greater than before. As it was thought that the friction on this
                    ſmall part (only fix inches) was too ſmall a portion of the whole obſtruction,
                    various additional obſtructions were put into this part of the ſyphon, and it
                    was even lengthened to nine feet ; but ſtill no remarkable difference was
                    obſerved. It was even thought that the times were leſs when the ſyphon was
                    vertical.</p>
                <p>Thus Mr De Buat’s opinion is completely juſtified ; and he may be allowed to
                    aſſert, that the reſiſtance depends chiefly on the relation between the ſection
                    and</p>
                <p>its border ; and that —-- <hi rend="sup">wz</hi> *⅞- ſhould be a conſtant
                    quan-√a</p>
                <p>tity.</p>
                <p>To aſcertain this point was the object of the next ſe-ries of experiments ; to
                    ſee whether this quantity was really conſtant, and, if not, to diſcover the law
                    of its variation, and the phyſical circumſtances which accompanied the
                    variations, and may therefore be conſidered as their cauſes. A careful
                    compariſon of a very great number of experiments, made with the ſame Hope, and
                    with very different channels and velocities, ſhowed that ∖ <hi rend="italic">f</hi> <hi rend="italic">m g</hi> did not follow the proportion of <hi rend="italic">V d,</hi> nor of any power of 5/ J. This quantity <hi rend="italic">ſmg</hi> increaſed by ſmaller degrees in proportion as <hi rend="italic">f d</hi> was greater. In very great beds was nearly proportional to <hi rend="italic">ſſ</hi> but in ſmaller channels, the velocities diminiſhed much more than <hi
                        rend="italic"> \ſ</hi> <hi rend="italic">d</hi> did. Caſting about for ſome way of accommodation, Mr
                    Buat conſidered, that ſome approximation at leaſt would be had by taking off
                    from <hi rend="italic">d</hi> ſome conſtant ſmall quantity. This is evident :
                    For ſuch a diminution will have but a trifling effect when ¼∕ <hi rend="italic">d</hi> is great, and its effect will increaſe rapidly when <hi
                        rend="italic"> \ſ d</hi> is very ſmall. He therefore tried various values
                    for this ſubtraction, and compared the reſults with the former experiments ; and
                    he found, that if in</p>
                <p>every caſe √ <hi rend="italic">d</hi> be diminiſhed by oneſtenth of an inch,
                    the calculated diſcharges would agree very exactly with the experiment.
                    Therefore, inſtead of √ <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> he makes uſe of <hi
                        rend="italic"> <hi rend="smallcaps">λ∕ d —</hi></hi> O,ι, and finds this quantity always proportional to or finds that <hi
                        rend="sup"> l</hi> "∕ <hi rend="sup">m</hi> Jl.--is a con-</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps"><hi rend="sup"> i</hi> √J-o,i</hi></p>
                <p>ftant quantity, or very nearly ſo. It varied from 297 to 287 in all fictions
                    from that of a very ſmall pipe to that of a little canal. In the large fictions
                    of canals and rivers it diminiſhed ſtill more, but never was leſs than 2y6.</p>
                <p>This reſult is very agreeable to the moſt diſtinct notions that we can form of
                    the mutual actions of the water and its bed. <hi rend="italic">We</hi> fie,
                    that when the motion of water is obſtructed by a ſolid body, which deflects the
                    paſſing filaments, the diſturbance does not extend to any conſiderable diſtance
                    on the two ſides of the body. In like manner, the ſmall diſturbances, and
                    imperceptible curvilineal motions, which are occaſioned by the infiniteſimal
                    inequalities of the channel, muſt extend to a very ſmall diſtance indeed from
                    the ſides and bottom of the channel. We know, too, that the mutual adheſion or
                    attraction of water for the ſolid bodies which are moiſtened by it, extends to a
                    very ſmall diſtance ; which is probably the ſame, or nearly ſo, in all cafis. Mr
                    Buat obſerved, that a ſurface of 23 ſquare inches, applied to the ſurface of
                    ſtagnant water, lifted 1601 grains ; another of <hi rend="italic">5</hi> 4
                    ſquare inches lifted 365 : this was at the rate of 65 grains per inch nearly,
                    making a column of about one-ſixth of an inch high. Now this effect is very much
                    analogous to a real contraction of the capacity of the channel. The water may be
                    conceived as nearly ſtagnant to this ſmall diſtance from the border of the
                    fiction. Or, to ſpeak more accurately, the diminution of the progreſſive
                    velocity occaſioned by the friction and adheſion of the ſides, decreaſes very
                    rapidly as we recede from the ſides, and ceaſes to be ſenſible at a very ſmall
                    diſtance.</p>
                <p>The writer of this article verified this by a very ſimple and inſtructive
                    experiment. He was. making experiments on the production of vortices, in the
                    manner ſuggeſted by SirlſaacNewton, by whirling a very accurate andſmooth-ly
                    poliſhed cylinder in water; and he found that the rapid motion of the
                    ſurrounding water was confined to an exceeding ſmall diſtance from the cylinder,
                    and it was not till after many revolutions that it was ſenſible even at the
                    diſtance of half an inch. We may, by the way, ſuggeſt this as the beſt form of
                    experiments for examining the reſiſtances of pipes. The motion excited by the
                    whirling cylinder in the ſtagnant water is equal and oppoſite to the motion loft
                    by water paſſing along a ſurface equal to that of the cylinder with the ſame
                    velocity. Be this as it may, we are juſtified in conſidering, with Mr Buat, the
                    ſection of the ſtream as thus diminiſhed by cutting off a narrow border all
                    round the touching parts, and ſuppoſing that the motion and diſcharge is the
                    ſame as if the root of the mean depth of the ſection were diminiſhed by a ſmall
                    quantity, nearly conſtant. We ſee, too, that the effect of this muſt be
                    infinſible in great canals and rivers ; ſo that, fortunately, its quantity is
                    beſt aſcertained by experiments made with ſmall pipes. This is attended with
                    another con« veniency, in the opinion of Mr Buat, namely, that the</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0271" facs="gri_33125011196389_0277.tif"/>
                <p>effect of viſcidity is moil ſenſible in great maſſes of water in flow motion,
                    and is almoſt inſenſible in ſmall pipes, ſo as not to diſturb theſe experiments.
                    We may therefore aſſume 297 as the general value of . _</p>
                <p>Since we have, we have alſo . This we may expreſs by . And thus, when we have
                    expreſſed the effect of friction by , the quantity <hi rend="italic">m</hi> is
                    variable, and its general value is , in which <hi rend="italic">n</hi> is an
                    invariable abſtract number equal to 243,7, given by the nature of the reliſtance
                    which water ſuſtains from its bed, and which indicates its intenſity.</p>
                <p>And, laſtly, ſince <hi rend="italic">m = n</hi> (√ <hi rend="italic">d</hi> —o,1) <hi rend="sup">2</hi> , we have , and the expreſſion of the velocity V,
                    which water acquires and maintains along any channel whatever, now becomes V = <hi rend="italic">,</hi> or ,i in which X is alſo a variable quantity,
                    depending on the ſlope of the ſurface or channel, and expreſſing the
                    accelerating force which, in the caſe of water in train, is in equilibrio with
                    the reſiſtances expreſſed by the numerator of the fraction.</p>
                <p>Having ſo happily ſucceeded in aſcertaining the variations of reſiſtance, let us
                    accompany Mr Buat in his inveſtigation of the law of acceleration, expreſſed by
                    the value of X.</p>
                <p>Experience, in perfect agreement with any diſtinct opinions that we can form on
                    this ſubject, had already ſhowed him, that the reſiſtances increaſed in a flower
                    ratio than that of the ſquares of the velocities, or that the velocities
                    increaſed flower than √ <hi rend="italic">s.</hi> Therefore, in the formula V
                    = , which, for one</p>
                <p>A</p>
                <p>channel, we may expreſs thus, V =, we muſt admit</p>
                <p>that X is ſenſibly equal to √ <hi rend="italic">s</hi> when the ſlope is very
                    ſmall or <hi rend="italic">s</hi> very great. But, that we may accurately
                    expreſs the velocity in proportion as the ſlope augments, we muſt have X greater
                    than √ <hi rend="italic">s</hi> ; and moreover, muſt increaſe as √ <hi
                        rend="italic"> s</hi> diminiſhes. Theſe condi-tions are neceſſary, that our
                    values of V, deduced from the formula V = , may agree with the experiment.</p>
                <p>In order to comprehend every degree of ſlope, we muſt particularly attend to the
                    motion through pipes, becauſe open canals will not furniſh us with inſtances of
                    exact trains with great ſlopes and velocities We can make pipes vertical. In
                    this caſe is , and the velocity is the greateſt poſſible for a train by the
                    action of gravity : But we can give greater velocities than this</p>
                <p>by increaſing the head of water beyond what produces the velocity of the train.</p>
                <p>Let AB (fig. 10.) be a vertical tube, and let CA be the head competent to the
                    velocity in the tube, which we ſuppoſe to be in train. The ſlope is 1, and the
                    full weight of the column in motion is the preciſe meaſute of the reſiſtance.
                    The value of , conſidered as a ſlope, is now a maximum ; but, conſidered as
                    expreſſing the proportion of the weight of the column in motion to the weight
                    which is in equilibrio with the reſiſtance, it may not be a maximum ; it may
                    ſurpaſs unity, and <hi rend="italic">s</hi> may be leſs than 1. For if the
                    veſſel be filled to E, the head of water is increaſed, and will produce a
                    greater velocity, and this will produce a greater reſiſtance. The velocity being
                    now greater,, the head EF which imparts it muff be greater than CA. But it will
                    not be equal to EA, becauſe the uniform velocities <hi rend="italic">are found</hi> to increaſe faſter than the ſquare roots of the preſſures. This is the
                    general fact. Therefore F is above A, and <hi rend="sup">,</hi> the weight of
                    the column FB, now employed to overcome the reſiſtance, is greater than the
                    weight of the column AB in motion. In ſuch caſes, therefore, —, greater than
                    unity, is a fort</p>
                <p>of fictitious ſlope, and only repreſents the proportion of the reſiſtance to the
                    weight of the moving column. This proportion may ſurpaſs unity.</p>
                <p>But it cannot be infinite: For ſuppoſing the head of water infinite ; if this
                    produce a finite velocity, and we deduct from the whole height the height
                    corre-ſponding to this finite velocity, there will remain an infinite head, the
                    meaſure of an infinite reſiſtance produced by a finite velocity. This does not
                    accord with the obſerved law of the velocities, where the reſiſtances actually
                    do not increaſe as fail as the ſquares of the velocities. Therefore an infinite
                    head would have produced an infinite velocity, in oppoſition to the reſiſtances
                    : taking off the head of the tube, competent to this velocity, at the entry of
                    the tube, which head would alſo be infinite, the remainder would in all
                    probability be finite, balancing a finite reſiſtance.</p>
                <p>Therefore the value of <hi rend="italic">s</hi> may remain finite, although
                    the velocity be infinite ; and this is agreeable to all our cleareſt notions of
                    the reſiſtances.</p>
                <p>Adopting this principle, we muſt find a value of X which will anſwer all theſe
                    conditions. 2. It muſt be ſenſibly proportional to √ <hi rend="italic">s,</hi> while <hi rend="italic">s</hi> is great. It mult always be leſs than √ <hi
                        rend="italic"> s</hi> . 3. It muſt deviate from the proportion of √ <hi
                        rend="italic"> s,</hi> ſo much the more as √ <hi rend="italic">s</hi> is
                    ſmaller. 4. It muſt not vaniſh when the velocity is infinite. 5. It muſt agree
                    with a range of experiments with every variety of channel and of ſlope.</p>
                <p>We ſhall underſtand the nature of this quantity X better by repreſenting by
                    lines the quantities concerned im forming it.</p>
                <p>If the velocities were exactly as the ſquare roots of the ſlopes, the
                    equilateral hyperbola NKS (fig. 10. n <hi rend="sup">0</hi> 2 ) between its
                    aſſymptotes MA, AB, would repreſent the equation V = ——. The values of √ <hi
                        rend="italic"> s</hi> would be repreſented by the abſeiſſæ, and the
                    velocities by the ordinates, and V √ <hi rend="italic">s</hi> = A would be the
                    power of the. hyperbola. But ſince theſe velocities are not ſenſibly.</p>

                <p>equal to — except when √ <hi rend="italic">s</hi> is very great, and deviate
                    the more from this quantity as √ <hi rend="italic">s</hi> is ſmaller ; we may
                    repreſent the velocities by the ordinates of another curve PGT, which approaches
                    very near to the hyperbola, at a great diſtance from A along AB : but ſeparates
                    from it when the abſciſſæ are ſmaller : ſo that if AQ repreſents that value of √ <hi rend="italic">s</hi> (which we have ſeen may become leſs than unity),
                    which Correſponds to art infinite velocity, the line QO maybe the aſſymptote of

                <p>thoſe of the hyperbola are equal to -. Therefore the ratio of theſe ordinates or
                    ſhould be ſuch that it ſhall be ſo much nearer to unity as √ <hi rend="italic">s</hi> greater, and ſhall ſurpaſs it ſo much the more as √ <hi
                        rend="italic"> s</hi> is ſmaller.</p>
                <p>To expreſs X therefore as ſome function of √ <hi rend="italic">s</hi> ſo as to
                    anſwer theſe conditions, we ſee in general that X muſt be leſs than √∙ <hi

                    Nor muſt it be any multiple of √j ſuch as y√ <hi rend="sup">,</hi> j∙, for the
                    ſame reaſem. If we make <hi rend="smallcaps">X = √ <hi rend="sub">j</hi></hi> —K, K being a conſtant quantity, we may anſwer the firſt condition pretty
                    well. But K muſt be very ſmall, that X may not become equal to nothing, except
                    in ſome exceedingly ſmall value of √ <hi rend="italic">s.</hi> Now the
                    experiments will not admit of this, becauſe the ratio - does not increaſe
                    ſufficiently to correſpond with the velocities which we obſerve in certain
                    ſlopes, unleſs we make K greater than unity, which again is in-conſiſtent with
                    other experiments. We learn from ſuch canvaſſing that it will not do to make K a
                    conſtant quantity. If we ſhould make it any fractionary power of √ <hi
                        rend="sup"> r</hi> x, it would make X = o, that is, nothing, when <hi

                    would ſeem, therefore, that nothing will anſwer for K but ſome power of √h which
                    has a variable index. The logarithm of V <hi rend="sup">z</hi> <hi rend="smallcaps">j has this property. We may therefore try to make X =
                        √r—log. √r. Accordingly if we try the equation V= , we ſhall find a</hi></p>
                <p>very great agreement with the experiments till the declivity becomes
                    conſiderable, or about √-, which is much greater than any river. But it will not
                    agree with the velocities obſerved in ſome mill courſes, and in pipes of a ſtill
                    greater declivity, and gives a velocity that is too ſmall ; and in vertical
                    pipes the velocity is not above one half of the true one. We ſhall get rid of
                    molt of theſe incongruities if we make K conſiſt of the hyperbolic logarithm of <hi rend="italic">V s</hi> augmented by a ſmall conſtant quantity, and by
                    trying various values for this conſtant quantity, and comparing the reſults with

                <p>Mr l)e Buat, after repeated trials, found that he would have a very great
                    conformity with experiment by making K= log. λΛγ-{- i, 6, and that the

                <p>There is a circumſtance which our author ſeems tö have overlooked on this
                    occaſion, and which is undoubtedly of great effect in theſe motions, viz. the
                    mutual adhelion of the particles of water. This cauſes the water which is
                    deſcending (in a vertical pipe for example) to drag more water after it, and
                    thus greatly in-Creaſes its velocity. We have ſeeh an experiment in which the
                    water iſſued from the bottom of a reſervoir through a long vertical pipe having
                    a very gentle taper. It Was 15 feet long, one inch diameter at the upper end,
                    and two inches at the lower. The depth of the water in the reſervoir was exactly
                    one foot ; in a minute there were diſcharged 2 <hi rend="sub">τ</hi> <hi rend="sup">9</hi> <hi rend="sub">5</hi> ∙ cubic feet of water. It muſt therefore have iſſued
                    through the hole in the bottom of the reſervoir with the velocity of 8,8y feet
                    per ſecond. And yet we know that this head of water could not make it paſs
                    through the hole with a velocity greater than 6,y6 feet per ſecond. This
                    increaſe muſt therefore have ariſen from the cauſe we have mentioned, and is a
                    proof of the great intenſity of this force. We doubt not but that the diſcharge
                    might have been much more increaſed by proper contrivances ; and we know many
                    inſtances in water pipes where this effect is produced in a very great degree.</p>
                <p>The following caſe is very diſtinct: Water is brought into the town of Dunbar in
                    the county of Eaſt Lothian from a ſpring at the diſtance of about 3200 yards. It
                    is conveyed along the firſt 1100 yards in a pipe of two inches diameter, and the
                    declivity is 12 feet nine inches ; from thence the water flows in a pipe of 1⅛
                    diameter, with a declivity of 44 feet 3 inches, making in all 57 feet. When the
                    work was carried as far as the two-inch pipe reached, the diſcharge was found to
                    be 27 Scotch pints, of 103⅛ cubic inches each in a minute. When it was brought
                    into the town, the diſcharge was 28. Here it is plain that the deſcent along the
                    ſecond ſtretch of the pipe could derive no impulſion from the firſt. This was
                    only able to ſupply 2 7 pints* and to <hi rend="italic">deliver</hi> it into a
                    pipe of equal bore. It was not equivalent to the forcing it into a ſmaller pipe,
                    and almoſt doubling its velocity. It muſt therefore have been <hi rend="italic">dragged</hi> into this ſmaller pipe by the weight of what was deſcending
                    along it, and this water was exerting a force· equivalent to a head of 16
                    inches, increaſing the velocity from 14 to about 28.</p>
                <p>It muſt be obſerved, that if this formula be juft, there can be no declivity ſo
                    ſmall that a current of water will not take place in it. And accordingly none
                    has been obſerved in the ſurface of a ſtream when this did not happen. But it
                    alſo ſhould happen with re-ſpect to any declivity of bottom. Yet we know that
                    water will hang on the ſloping ſurface of a board without proceeding further.
                    The cauſe of this ſeems to be the adheſiort of the water combined with its
                    viſcidity. The viſcidity of a fluid preſents a certain force which muſt be
                    overcome before any current can take place.</p>
                <p>A ſeries of important experiments were made by our author in order to aſcertain
                    the relation between the velocity at the ſurface of any ſtream and that at</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0273" facs="gri_33125011196389_0279.tif"/>
                <p>the bottom. Theſe are curious and valuable on many accounts. One circumſtance
                    deſerves our notice here, viz. that <hi rend="italic">the difference between
                        the ſuperſicial and bottom velocities of any ſtream are proportional to the
                        ſquare roots of the ſuperſicial velocities.</hi> From what has been already
                    ſaid on the gradual diminution of the velocities among the adjoining filaments,
                    we muſt conclude that the ſame rule holds good with reſpect to the velocity of
                    ſepara-tion of two filaments immediately adjoining. Hence we learn that this
                    velocity of ſeparation is in all caſes indefinitely ſmall, and that we may,
                    without danger of any ſenſible error, ſuppoſe it a confiant quantity in all
                    caſes.</p>
                <p>We think, with our ingenious author, that on a review of theſe circumſtances,
                    there is a conſtant or invariable portion of the accelerating force employed in
                    overcoming this viſcidity and producing this mutual ſeparation of the adjoining
                    filaments. We may expreſs this part of the accelerating force by a part ∙g of
                    that</p>
                <p>ſlope which conſtitutes the whole of it. If it were not employed in overcoming
                    this reſiſtance, it would produce a velocity which (on account of this
                    reſiſtance) is not produced, or is loft. This would be .This muſt therefore be
                    taken from the velocity exhibited by our general formula. When thus corrected,

                    This has been collected from a ſcrupulous attention to the experiments
                    (eſpe-cially in canals and great bodies of water moving with very ſmall
                    velocities ; in which ςafe the effects of viſcidity muſt become more
                    remarkable), and it appearsthat it may be valued at or 0,3 inches very nearly.</p>

                    ſuch reaſoning as our moſt diſtinct notions of the internal motions will admit,

                <p>This compariſon muſt be acknowledged to be moſt ſatisfactory, and ſhows the
                    great penetration and ad-dreſs of the author, in ſo ſucceſsfully ſifting and
                    appreciating the ſhare which each co-operating circumſtance has had in producing
                    the very intricate and complicated effect. It adds ſome weight to the principles
                    on which he has proceeded in this analyſis of the me-chaniſm of hydraulic
                    motion, and muſt give us great confidence in a theory ſo fairly eſtabliihed on a
                    very copious induction. The author offers it only as a rational and well-founded
                    probability, To this character it is certainly intitled ; for the ſuppoſitions
                    made in it are agreeable to the moſt diſtinct notions we can form of theſe
                    internal motions. And it muſt always be remembered that the inveſtigation of the
                    formula, although it be rendered ſomewhat more perſpicuous by thus having
                    recourſe to thoſe notions, has no dependence on the truth of the principles. For
                    it is, in fact, nothing but a claſſification of experiments, which are grouped
                    together by ſome one circumſtance of ſlope, velocity, form of ſection,
                    &amp;c. in order to diſcover the law of the changes which are induced by a
                    variation of the circumſtances which do not reſemble. The procedure was
                    preciſely ſimilar to that of the aſtronomer when he deduces the elements of an
                    orbit from a multitude of obſervations. This was the talk of Mr de Buat ; and he
                    candidly and modeſtly informs us, that the finding out analytical forms of
                    expreſſion which would exhibit theſe changes was the work of Mr Benezech de St
                    Honoré, a young officer of engineers, and his colleague in the experimental
                    courſe. It does honour to his ſldll and addreſs; and we think the whole both a
                    pretty and initructive ſpecimen of the method of diſeovering the laws of nature
                    in the midſt of complicated phenomena. Daniel Bernoulli firſt gave the rules of
                    this method, and they have been greatly improved by Lambert, Condorcet, and De
                    la Grange. Mr Coulomb has given ferne excellent examples of their application to
                    the d'&lt; <hi rend="sub">0</hi> very of the laws of friction, of
                    magnetical and electrical attraction, &amp;c. But this preſent work is the
                    moſt perſpicuous and familiar of them all. It is the empirical method of
                    generaliſing natural phenomena, and of deducing general rules, of which we can
                    give no other demonſtration but that they are faithful repreſentations of
                    matters of fact. We hope that others, encouraged by the ſucceſs of Mr de Buat,
                    will follow this example, where public utility is preferred to a diſ-</p>
                <p>play of mathematical knowledge.</p>
                <p>Although the author may not have hit upon the</p>
                <p>preciſe <hi rend="italic">modus operandi,</hi> we agree with him in thinking
                    that nature ſeems to act in a way not unlike what is here ſuppoſed. At any rate,
                    the range of experiments is ſo extenſive, and ſo multifarious, that few caſes
                    can occur which are not included among them. The experiments will always retain
                    their value (as we preſume that they are faithfully narrated), whatever may
                    become of the theory ; and we are coni dent that the formula will give an anſwer
                    to any queſtion to which it may be applicable infinitely preſerable to the vague
                    gueſs of the moſt ſagacious and experienced engineer.</p>
                <p>We muſt however obſerve, that as the experiments on pipes were all made with
                    ſcrupulous care in the contrivance and execution of the apparatus, excepting
                    only thoſe of Mr Couplet on the main pipes at Verſailles,</p>

                <p>we may preſume that t∩e formula gives the greateſt velocities which can be
                    expected. In ordinary works, where joints are rough or leaky, where drops of
                    ſolder hang in the inſide, where cocks intervene with deficient water-ways,
                    where pipes have âukward bendings, contractions, or enlargements, and where they
                    may contain fand or air, we ſhould reckon on a ſmaller velocity than what
                    reſults from our calculation ; and we preſume that an undertaker may with

                    his employer. We imagine that the actual performance of canals will be much
                    nearer to the formula.</p>
                <p>We have made inquiry after works of this kind executed in Britain, that we might
                    compare them with the formula. But all our canals are locked and without motion
                    ; and we have only learned by an accidental information from Mr Watt, that a
                    canal in his neighbourhood, which is 18 feet wide at the ſurface, and ſe-ven
                    feet at the bottom, and four feet deep, and has a ſlope of one inch in a quarter
                    of a mile, runs with the velocity of 17 inches per ſecond at the ſurface, 10 at
                    the bottom, and 1 4 in the middle. If we compute the motion of this canal by our
                    formula, we ſhall find the mean velocity to be 13-5.</p>
                <p>No river in the world has had its motions ſo much ſcrutiniſed as the Pυ about
                    the end of the laſt century. It had been a ſubject of 100 years continual
                    litigation between the inhabitants of the Bologneſe and the Fer-rareſe, whether
                    the waters of the Rheno ſhould be thrown into the Tronco de Venezia or Po
                    Grande. This occaſioned very numerous meaſures to be taken of its ſections and
                    declivity, and the quantities of water which it contained in its different
                    liâtes of fullneſs. But, unfortunately, the long eſtabliſhed methods of
                    meaſuring waters, which were in force in Lombardy, made no account of the
                    velocity, and not all the intreaties of Caſtelli, Grandi, and other moderns,
                    could prevail on the viſitors in this proceſs to deviate from the eſtabliſhed
                    methods. We have therefore no minute accounts of its velocity, though there are
                    many rough eſtimates to be met with in that valuable collection publiſhed at
                    Florence in 1723, of the writings on the motion of rivers. From them we have
                    extracted the <hi rend="italic">only preciſe obſervations</hi> which are to be
                    found in the whole work.</p>
                <p>The Po Grande receives no river from Stellata to the ſea, and its ſlope in that
                    interval is found moſt ſur-priſingly uniform, namely fix inches in the mile
                    (reduced to Engliſh meaſure). The breadth in its great freſhes is 759 ſeet at
                    Lago Scuro, with a very uniform depth of 31 ſeet. In its loweſt ſtate (in which
                    it is called <hi rend="italic">Po Magra),</hi> its breadth is not leſs than
                    70c, and its depth about 10⅛.</p>
                <p>The Rheno has a uniform declivity from the Ponte Emilio to Vigarano of 1 ς
                    inches per mile. Its breadth in its greateſt freſhes is 189 ſeet, and its depth
                    9.</p>
                <p>Signor Corrade in his report ſays, that in the ſtate of the great freſhes the
                    velocity of the Rheno is moſt exactly I of that of the Po.</p>
                <p>Grandi ſays that a great freſh in the Rheno employs 12 hours (by many
                    obſervations of his own) to come from Ponte Emilio to Vigarano, which is 30
                    miles. This is a velocity of 44 inches per ſecond. And, by Corrade’s proportion,
                    the velocity of the. Po Grande muſt be 55 inches per ſecond.</p>
                <p>Montanan’s obſervation gives the Po Magra a velocity of 31 inches per ſecond.</p>
                <p>Let us compare theſe velocities with the velocities calculated by Buat’s
                    formula.</p>
                <p>The hydraulic mean depths <hi rend="italic">d</hi> and D of the Rheno and Po
                    in the great freſhes deduced from the above meaſures, are 98,6 and 344 inches ;
                    and their ſlopes <hi rend="italic">s</hi> and S are <hi rend="sub">τr</hi> √ <hi rend="sub">τ7</hi> and τc⅛5∙ This will give = 52,176 inches 307 ( V <hi rend="sup">z</hi> <hi rend="italic">d</hi> —o,ι ) <hi rend="sub">z</hi> _</p>
                <p><hi rend="sup">and</hi> √r∑L√7+T6-°&gt;3 (V <hi rend="sup">j</hi> -°∙')
                    =46,727 inches.</p>
                <p>Theſe reſults differ very little from the velocities above mentioned. And if the
                    velocity correſponding to a depth of 31 feet be deduced from that obſerved by
                    Montanari in the Po Magra 10 ſeet deep, on the ſuppoſition that they are in the
                    proportion of V <hi rend="sup">z</hi> <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> it will be found to be about 53∙∣ inches per ſecoad.</p>
                <p>This compariſon is therefore highly to the credit oſ the theory, and would have
                    been very agreeable to M. de Buat, had he known it, as we,hope it is to our
                    readers.</p>
                <p>We have collected many accounts of water pipes, and made the compariſons, and we
                    flatter ourſelves that theſe have enabled us to improve the theory. They ſhall
                    appear in their proper place; and we may juſt obſerve here, that the two-inch
                    pipe, which we formerly ſpokc of as conveying the water to Dunbar, ſhould have
                    yielded only 25 * Scotch pints per minute by the formula, inſtead of-27; a ſmall
                    error.</p>
                <p>We have, therefore, no heſitation in ſaying that this ſingle formula of the
                    uniform motion of water is one of the moſt valuable preſents which natural
                    ſcience and the arts have received during the courſe of this century.</p>
                <p>We hoped to have made this fortunate inveſtigation of the chevalier de Buat
                    ſtill more acceptable to our readers by another table, which ſhould contain the
                    va-307</p>
                <p>lues of —τ-÷—-—7-ττ—-. ready calculated for every de-V j — Lv j-J- 1,6</p>
                <p>clivity that can occur in water pipes, canals, or rivers. Aided by this, which
                    ſuperſedes the only difficult part of the computation, a perſon could calculate
                    the velocity for any propoſed caſe in leſs than two minutes. But we have not
                    been able to get it ready for 1t3 appeal ance in this article, but we ſhall not
                    fail to give it when we relume the ſubject in' the article <hi rend="italic">WATER-Works ;</hi> and we hope even to give its reſults on a ſcale which
                    may be carried in the pocket, and will enable the unlearned practitioner to
                    lolve any queſtion with accuracy in half a minute.</p>
                <p>W <hi rend="sup">r</hi> <hi rend="smallcaps">e have now eſtabliſhed in ſome meaſure a Theory of
                        Hydraulics, by exhibiting a general theorem which expreſſes the relation of
                        the chief circumſtances of all ſuch motions as have attained a ſtate of
                        permanency, in ſo far as this depends on the magnitude,, form, and ſlope of
                        the channel. This permanency we have expreſſed by the term traih, ſaying
                        that the ſtream is</hi> <hi rend="italic">in train.</hi></p>
                <p>We proceed to conſider the ſubordinate circumſtances contained in this theorem ;

                <p>it decreaſes in the different filaments, from the axis or moſt rapid filament to
                    the border ; and the connection of this with the mean velocity, which is
                    expreſſed by our formula. 3√, Having acquired ſome diſtinct notions of this, we
                    ſhall be able to ſee the manner in which undiſturbed nature works in forming the
                    beds of our rivers, the ſorms which ſhe affects, and which we muſt imitate in
                    all their local modifications, if we would ſecure that permanency which is the
                    evident aim of all her operations. We ſhall here learn the mutual action of the
                    current and its bed, and the circumſtances which enſure the ſtability of both.
                    Theſe we may call the <hi rend="italic">regimen</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">confirmation</hi> of the ſtream, and may ſay that it is <hi rend="italic">in regimen,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">in confirmation.</hi> This has a
                    relation, not to the dimenſioris and the ſtope alone, or to the accelerating
                    force and the reſiſtance ariſing from mere inertia ; it reſpects immediately the
                    tenacity of the bed, and is different from <hi rend="italic">the train.</hi></p>

                <p>ÿ I. <hi rend="italic">Of the Forms of the Channel.</hi></p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The numerator of the fraction which expreſſes the velocity
                        of a river in train has √7 for one of its factors. 'Γhat form, thereſore, is
                        moſt favourable to the motion which gives the greateſt value to what we have
                        called the hydraulic mean depth</hi> <hi rend="italic">d.</hi> This is the prerogative of the ſemicircle, and here <hi rend="italic">d</hi> is equal to half the radius ; and all other
                    figures of the ſame area are the more favourable, as they approach nearer to a
                    ſemicircle.- This is the form, therefore, of all conduit pipes, and ſhould be
                    taken for aqueducts which are built of maſonry. Eaſe and accuracy of execution,
                    however, have made engineers prefer a rectangular form ; but neither of theſe
                    will do for a channel formed out of the ground. W e ſhall ſoon ſee that the
                    ſemicircle is incompatible with a regimen ; and, if we proceed through the
                    regular polygons, we ſhall find that the half hexagon is the only one which has
                    any pretentions to a regimen ; yet experience ſhows us, that even its banks are
                    too ſteep for almoſt any foil. A dry earthen bank, not bound together by graſs
                    roots, will hardly ſtand with a ſlope of 45 degrees; and a canal which conveys
                    running waters will not ſtand with this ſlope. Banks whoſe baſe is to their
                    height as 4 to 3 will ſtand very well in moiſt foils, and this is a ſlope very
                    uſually given. This form is even affected in the ſpontaneous operations of
                    nature, in the channels which ſhe digs for the rills and rivulets in the higher
                    and ſteeper grounds.</p>
                <p>This form has ſome mathematical and mechanical properties which intitle it to
                    ſome further notice. Let ABEC (fig. ιι.) be ſuch a trapezium, and AHGC the
                    rectangle of equal width and depth. Biſect HB and EG by the verticals FD and KI,
                    and draw the verticals <hi rend="italic">b</hi> B, <hi rend="italic">e</hi> E. Becauſe AH : HB= 3 :4, we have AB = 5, andBD=2, and FD 3, and BDſt-DF= BA.
                    From theſe premiſſes it follows, that the trapezium ABEC has the ſame area with
                    the rectangle; for HB being biſected in D, the triangles ACF, BCD are equal.
                    Alſo the border ABEC, which is touched by the paſſing ſtream, is equal to FDIK.
                    Therefore the mean depth, which is the quotient of the area divided by the
                    border, is the ſame in both j and this 14the</p>
                <p>caſe, whatever is the width BE at the bottom, or even though there be no
                    rectangle ſuch as <hi rend="italic">b</hi> BEe interpoſed between the ſlant
                    ſides.</p>
                <p>Of all rectangles, that whoſe breadth is twice the height, or which is half of a
                    ſquare, gives the greateſt mean depth. If, therefore, FK be double of&lt;FD,
                    the trapezium ABEC, which has the ſame area, will have the largeſt mean depth of
                    any ſuch trapezium, and will be the belt form of a channel for conveying running
                    waters. In this caſe, we have AC = 10, AH=</p>
                <p>3, and BE~2. Or we may ſay that the bell form is a trapezium, whoſe bottom width
                    is -∣- of the depth, and whoſe extreme width is ∙ <hi rend="sup">i</hi> <hi rend="sub">j</hi> -. This form approaches very near to that which the
                    torrents in the hills naturally dig for themſelves in uniform ground, where
                    their action is not checked by ſtones which they lay bare, or which they depoſit
                    in their courſe. This ſhows us, and it will be fully confirmed by and by, that
                    the channel of a river is not a fortuitous thing, but has a relation to the
                    conſiſtency of the foil and velocity of the ſtream.</p>
                <p>A rectangle, whoſe breadth is y of the depth of water, will therefore have the
                    ſame mean depth with a. triangle whoſe ſurſace width is ∣ of its vertical depth
                    ; for this is the dimenſions when the rectangle <hi rend="italic">b</hi> BEe
                    is taken away.</p>
                <p>Let A be the area of the ſection of any channel, <hi rend="italic">τυ</hi> its
                    width (when rectangular), and <hi rend="italic">h</hi> its depth of water»
                    Then what we have called its mean depth, or <hi rend="italic">d <hi rend="sub">i</hi></hi> will ſhe</p>
                <p>———~l <hi rend="sup">iυ</hi> A, Or if <hi rend="italic">q</hi> expreſſes the
                    ratio of the</p>

                <p>width to the depth of a rectangular bed ; that is, if</p>
                <p>w</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">q~~r,</hi> we have <hi rend="sup">a ver</hi> y ſimple and
                    ready expreſſion for</p>
                <p>the mean depth, either from the width or depth. For</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">d —-</hi> , or <hi rend="italic">d = ——∙</hi></p>
                <p>7+2 <hi rend="italic">q+2</hi></p>
                <p>Therefore, if the depth were infinite, and the width</p>
                <p>finite, we ſhould have <hi rend="italic">d-~∙,</hi> or if the width be infi-2</p>
                <p>nite, and the depth finite, we have <hi rend="italic">d ~h.</hi> And theſe are
                    the limits of the values of <hi rend="italic">d</hi> ; and therefore, in
                    rivers whoſe width is always great in compariſon of the depth, we may without
                    much error take their real depth for their hydraulic mean depth. Hence we derive
                    a rule of eaſy recollection, and which will at ail times give us a very near
                    eſtimate of the velocity and expence of a running ſtream, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> that <hi rend="italic">the velocities are nearly as the ſqaare
                        roots of the depths.</hi> We find this confirmed by many experiments of
                    Michelotti.</p>
                <p>Alſo, when we are allowed to ſuppoſe this ratio of the velocities and depths,
                    that is, in a rectangular canal of great breadth and ſmall depth, we ſhall have
                    the quantities diſcharged nearly in the proportion of the cubes of the
                    velocities. For the quantity diſcharged <hi rend="italic">d</hi> is as., the
                    velocity and area jointly, that is, as the height and velocity jointly, becauſe
                    when the width is the ſame the area is as the height. Therefore, we have <hi
                        rend="italic"> d == h v.-</hi> But, by the above remark, <hi rend="italic">h = v <hi rend="sup">i</hi> .</hi> Therefore, <hi rend="italic">d == v <hi rend="sup">i</hi></hi> ; and this is confirmed by the experiments of Boſſut, vol. ii. 236. Alſo,
                    becauſe <hi rend="italic">d</hi> is as <hi rend="italic">v h <hi rend="sub">i</hi></hi> when <hi rend="italic">w</hi> is conſtant, and by the above remark
                    -(allowable when <hi rend="italic">&lt;ιυ</hi> is very great in proportion

                <p>1. Knowing the mean depth and the proportion of the width and real depth, we can
                    determine the dimenſions of the bed, and we have <hi rend="italic">ιυ — q

                        regimen of a river ; for it is the velocity of the filaments in contact with
                        the bed which produces any change in it, and occaſions any preference of one
                        to another, in reſpect of regimen or ſtability. Did theſe circumſtances not
                        operate, the water, true to the laws of hydraulics, and confined within the
                        bounds which have been aſſigned them, would neither enlarge nor di-rniniſh
                        the area of the channel. But this is all that we can promiſe of waters
                        perfectly clear, running in pipes or hewn channels. But rivers, brooks, and
                        ſmaller ſtreams, carry along waters loaded with mud or fand, which they
                        depoſit wherever their velocity is checked ; and they tear up, on the other
                        hand, the materials of the channel wherever their velocity is ſufficiently
                        great. Nature, indeed, aims continually at an equilibrium, and works without

                        action and reaction, and proportioning the forms and direction of the
                        motions to her agents, and to local circumſtances. Her work is Row but

                <p>compliſh in a year ſhe will do in a century. The beds· of our rivers have
                    acquired ſome ſtability, becauſe they are the )abour of ages ; and it is to time
                    that we owe <hi rend="sup">,</hi> thoſe deep and wide valleys which receive-
                    and confine our rivers in channels, which are now conlolidated, and with ſlopes
                    which have been gradually moderated, ſo that they no longer either ravage our
                    habitations or confound our boundaries. Art may imitate nature, and by directing
                    her operations (which ſhe ſtill carries on according to lier own impreſcriptible
                    law’s) according to our views, we can halten her progreſs, and accompliſh our
                    purpoſe, during the ſhort period of human life. But we can do this only by
                    ſtudying the unalterable laws of mechaniſm. Theſe are preſented to us by
                    ſpontaneous nature. Frequently we remain ignorant of their foundation : but ſt
                    is not neceſſary for the proſpe-rity of the ſubject that he have the talents of
                    the ſena-tor ; he can profit by the ſtatute without underſtanding its grounds.
                    It is ſo in the preſent inſtance. We have not as yet been able to infer the law
                    of retardation obſerved in the filaments of a running ſtream from any found
                    mechanical principle. The problem, however, does not appear beyond our powers,
                    if we aſſume, with Sir Iſaac Newton, that the velocity of any particular
                    filament is the arithmetical mean between thoſe of the filaments immediately
                    adjoining. We may be aſſured, that the filament in the axis of an inclined
                    cylindrical tube, of which the current is in train, moves the faſteſt, and that
                    all thoſe in the ſame circumference round it are moving with one velocity, and
                    that the ſlow’eſt are thoſe which glide along the pipe. We may affirm the ſame
                    thing of the motions in a ſemi-cylindrical inclined channel conveying an open
                    ſtream. But even in theſe we have not yet demonſtrated the ratio between the
                    extreme velocities, nor in the different circles. This muſt be decided
                    experimentally.</p>
                <p>And here we are under great obligations to Mr de Buat. He has compared the
                    velocity in the axis of a prodigious number and variety of ſtreams, differing in
                    ſize, form, ſlope, and velocity, and has computed in them all the mean velocity,
                    by meaſuring the quantities of water diſcharged in a given time. His method of
                    meaſuring the bottom velocity was ſimple and juſt. He threw in a gooſeſherry, as
                    nearly as poſſible, of the ſame ſpecific gravity with the water. It was carried
                    along the bottom almoſt without touching it. See <hi rend="italic"><hi rend="smallcaps"> Résistance of Fluids,</hi></hi> n <hi rend="sup">o</hi> 67.</p>
                <p>He diſcovered the following laws : 1. In ſmall velocities the velocity in the
                    axis is to that at the bottom in a ratio of conſiderable inequality. 2. This
                    ratio diminiſhes as the velocity increaſes, and in very great velocities
                    approaches to the ratio of equality. 3. What was moſt remarkable was, that
                    neither the magnitude of the channel, nor its ſlope, had any influence in
                    changing this proportion, while the mean velocity remained the ſame. Nay, though
                    the ſtream ran on a channel covered with pebbles or coarſe fand, no difference
                    worth minding was to be obſerved from the velocity over a poliſhed channel. 4.
                    And if the velocity in the axis is conſtant, the velocity at the bottom is alſo
                    conſtant, and is not affected by the depth of water or magnitude of the ſtream.
                    In ſome experiments the depth was thrice thd width, and in others the width was
                    thrice the depth. This changed the proportion of the magnitude of the</p>

                <p>ſection to the magnitude of the rubbing part, but made no change on the ratio of
                    the velocities. This is a thing which no theory could point out.</p>
                <p>Another moſt important fact was alſo the reſult of his obſervation, viz. that <hi rend="italic">the mean velocity in any pipe or openflream is the
                        arithmetical mean between the velocity in the axis and the velocity at the
                        ltdes of a pipe or bottom of an open flream.</hi> We have already obſerved,
                    that the ratio of the velocity in the axis to the velocity at the bottom
                    diminiſhed as the mean velocity increaſed. This variation he was enabled to
                    expreſs in a very ſimple manner, ſo as to be eaſily remembered, and to enable us
                    to tell any one of them by obſerving another.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">If we take unity from the ſquare root of the ſuperficial
                        velocity, expreſſed in inches, the ſquare of the remainder is the velocity
                        at the bottom ; and the mean velocity is the half ſum of theſe two.</hi> Thus, if the velocity in the middle of the ſtream be 25 inches per ſecond, its
                    ſquare root is five ; from which if we take unity, there remains four. The
                    ſquare of this, or · 16, is the velocity at</p>

                <p>This is a very curious and moſt uſeful piece of information. The velocity in the
                    middle of the ſtream is the eaſieſt meaſured of all, by <hi rend="sup">4</hi> any light ſmall body floating down it ; and the mean velocity is the one which

                <p>We may expreſs this by a formula of moſt eaſy recollection. Let V be the mean

                <p>This may perhaps give the mathematicians ſome help in aſcertaining the law ol
                    degradation from the axis to the ſides. Thus, in a cylindrical pipe, we may
                    conceive the current as conſiſting of an infinite number of cylindrical ſhells
                    Aiding within each other like the draw tubes of a ſpy-glaſs. Each of theſe is in
                    equilibrio, or as much accelerated by the one within it as it is retarded by the
                    one without ; therefore as the <hi rend="italic">momentum</hi> of each
                    diminiſhes in the proportion of its diameter (the thickneſs being ſuppoſed the
                    ſame in all), the ve-locitv of ſeparation muſt increaſe by a certain law from
                    the ſides to the axis. The magnitude of the ſmall conſtant quantity here ſpoken
                    of ſeems to fix this law.</p>
                <p>The place of the mean velocity could not be diſcovered with any preciſion. In
                    moderate velocities it was not more than one-fourth or one-fifth of the depth
                    diſtant from the bottom. In very great velocities it was ſenſibly higher, but
                    never in the middle of the depth.</p>
                <p>The knowledge of theſe three velocities is of great importance. The ſuperſlcial
                    velocity is eaſily obſerved; hence the mean velocity is eaſily computed. This
                    multiplied by the ſection gives the expence ; and if we alſo . meaſure the
                    expanded border, and then obtain the mean depth (or ), we can, by the formula of
                    uniform motion, deduce the ſlope ; or, knowing the ſlope, we can. deduce any of
                    the other circumſtances.</p>
                <p>The following table of theſe three velocities will ſave the trouble of

                <p>The knowledge of the velocity at the bottom is of the greateſt uſe for enabling
                    us to judge of the action of the ſtream on its bed ; and we ſhall now make ſome
                    obſervations on this particular.</p>
                <p>Every kind of ſoil has a certain velocity conſiſtent with the ſtability of the
                    channel. A greater velocity would enable the waters to tear it up, and a ſmaller
                    velocity would permit the depoſition of more moveable materials from above. It
                    is not enough, then, ſor the ſtability of a river, that the accelerating forces
                    are ſo adjuſted to the ſize and figure of its channel that the current may be in
                    train : it muſt alſo be in equilibrio with the tenacity of the channel.</p>
                <p>We learn from obſervation, that a velocity of three inches per ſecond at the
                    bottom will juſt begin to work upon fine clay fit for pottery, and however firm
                    and compact it may be, it will tear it up. Yet no beds are more ſtable than clay
                    when the velocities do not exceed -this : for the water ſoon takes away the
                    impalpable particles of the ſuperſlcial clay, leaving the particles of fand
                    ſticking by their lower half in the reſt of the clay, which they now protect,
                    making a very permanent bottom, if the ſtream does not bring down gravel or
                    coarſe fand, which will rub off this very thin cruft, and allow another layer to
                    be worn off ; a velocity of ſix inches will lift fine fand ; eight inches will
                    lift fand as coarſe as linſeed ; 12 inches will ſweep along fine gravel ; 24
                    inches will roll along rounded pebbles an inch diameter; and it requires three
                    feet per ſecond at the bottom to ſweep along ſhivery angular ſtones of the ſize
                    of an <hi rend="sup">e</hi> gg∙</p>
                <p>The manner in which unwearied nature carries on ſome of theſe operations is
                    curious, and deſerves to be noticed a little. All muſt recollect the narrow
                    ridges or wrinkles which are left on the fand by a temporary freſh or ſtream.
                    They are obſerved to lie acroſs the ſtream, and each ridge conſiſts of a ſteep
                    face AD, BF (ſig. H.) which looks down the ſtream, and a gentler ſlope DB, FC,
                    which connects this with the next ridge. As the ſtream comes over the firſt
                    ſteep AD, it is directed almoſt perpendicularly againſt the point E immediately
                    below D, and thus it gets hold of a particle of coarſe fand, which it could not
                    have detached from the reſt had it been moving parallel to the ſurface of it. It
                    eaſily rolls it up the gentle ſlope EB ; arrived there, the particle tumbles
                    over the ridge, and lies cloſe at the bottom of it at F, where it is protected
                    by the little eddy, which is formed in the very angle ; other par-</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0281" facs="gri_33125011196389_0287.tif"/>
                <p>tides lying âbout E are treated in the ſame way, and, tumbling over the ridge B,
                    cover the firſt particle, and now protect it effectually from any further
                    diſturbance. The ſame operation is going on at the bottom of each ridge. The
                    brow or ſteep of the ridge gradually advances down the ſtream, and the whole ſet
                    change their places, as repreſented by the dotted line <hi rend="italic">adbſ;</hi> and after a certain time the particle which was depo-ſited at F is found
                    in an unprotected ſituation, as it was in E, and it now makes another ſtep down
                    the ſtream.</p>
                <p>The Abbé Boſſut found, that when the velocity of the ſtream was juſt ſufficient
                    for lifting the fand (and a ſmall exceſs hindered this operation altogether) a
                    ridge advanced about 20 feet in a day.</p>
                <p>Since the current carries off the moſt moveable matters of the channel, it
                    leaves the bottom covered with the remaining coarſer fand, gravel, pebbles, and
                    larger ſtones. To theſe are added many which come down the ſtream while it is
                    more rapid, and alſo many which roll in from the ſides as the banks wear away.
                    All theſe form a bottom much more ſolid and immoveable than a bottom of the
                    medium foil would have been. But this does not always maintain the channel in a
                    permanent form ; but frequently occaſions great changes, by obliging the
                    current, in the event of any ſudden freſh or ſwell, to enlarge its bed, and even
                    to change it altogether, by working to the right and to the leſt, ſince it
                    cannot work downwards. It is generally from ſuch accumulation of gravel and
                    pebbles in the bottom of the bed that rivers change their channels.</p>
                <p>It remains to aſcertain, in abſolute meaſures, the force which a current really
                    exerts in attempting to drag along with it the materials of its channel ; and
                    which <hi rend="italic">will</hi> produce this effect unleſs refilled by the
                    inertia of theſe materials. It is therefore of practical importance to know this
                    force.</p>
                <p>Nor is it abſtruſe or difficult. For when a current is in train, the
                    accelerating force is in equilibrio with the reſiſtance, and is therefore its
                    immediate meaſure. Now this accelerating force is preciſely equal to the weight
                    of the body of water in motion multiplied by the fraction which expreſſes the
                    ſlope. The mean depth being equal to the quotient of the ſection divided by the
                    border, the ſection is equal to the product of the mean depth multiplied by the
                    border. Therefore, calling the border <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> and the mean
                    depth <hi rend="italic">cl,</hi> we have the ſection <hi rend="italic">— db.</hi> The body of water in· motion is therefore <hi rend="italic">db</hi> <hi rend="smallcaps">j∙ (becauſe r was the ſlant length of a part whoſe
                        difference of elevation is 1), and the accelerating force is</hi> <hi rend="italic">db s × —,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">db.</hi> But if we
                    would only conſi-</p>
                <p>der this reſiſtance as correſponding to an unit of the length of the channel, we
                    muſt divide the quantity <hi rend="italic">d b</hi></p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">db</hi></p>
                <p>by j, and the reſiſtance is then —. And if we would <hi rend="italic">s</hi></p>
                <p>conſider the reſiſtance only for an unit of the border, we muſt divide this
                    expreſſion by <hi rend="italic">b</hi> ; and thus this reſiſtance (taking an
                    inch for the unit) will be expreſſed •for one ſquare inch of the bed by the
                    weight of a bulk of water which has a ſquare inch for its baie, and J . <hi
                        rend="sub"> 1</hi> .</p>
                <p>- for its height. And laſtly, if E be taken for any given ſuperſicial extent of
                    the channel or bed, and F the</p>

                <p>Thus, let it be required to determine in pounds the reſiſtance or friction on a
                    ſquare yard of a channel whoſe current is in train, which is 10 feet wide, four
                    feet deep, and has a ſlope of one foot in a mile. Here E is nine feet. Ten feet
                    width and four feet depth give a ſection of 40 feet. The border is 18 feet.

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">He who looks with a careleſs eye at a map of</hi> the
                    world, is apt to conſider the rivers which ramble over its ſurface as a
                    chance-medley diſpoſition of the drainers which carry off the waters. But it
                    will afford a moſt •agreeable object to a conſiderate and contemplative mind, to
                    take it up in this very ſimple light ; and having conſidered the many ways in
                    which the drenched ſurface might have been cleared of the ſuperfluous waters, to
                    attend particularly to the very way which nature has followed. In following the
                    troubled waters of a mountain torrent, or the pure ſtreams which trickle from
                    their baſes, till he fees them ſwallowed up in the ocean, and in attending to
                    the many varieties in their motions, he wilRbe delighted with obſerving how the
                    ſimple laws of mechaniſm are made ſo fruitful in good conſequences, both by
                    modifying the motions of the waters them-ſelves, and alſo by inducing new forms
                    onthe ſurface of the earth, fitted for re-acting on the waters, and producing
                    theſe very modifications of their motions which render them ſo beneficial. The
                    permanent beds of rivers are by no means fortuitous gutters haſtily ſcooped out
                    by daſhing torrents ; but both they and the vallevs through which they flow are
                    the patient but unceaſing labours of nature, prompted by goodneſs and directed
                    by wiſdom.</p>
                <p>Whether we trace a river from the torrents whichcollect the ſuperfluous waters
                    of heaven, or from the ſprings which diſcharge what would otherwiſe be condemned
                    to perpetual inactivity, each feeder is but a little rill which could not ramble
                    far from its ſcanty ſource among growing plants ami* abſorbent earth, without
                    being fucked up and evaporated, did it not meet with other rills in its courſe.
                    When united they form a body of water ſtill inconſiderable, but much more able,
                    by its bulk, to overcome the little obſtacles to its motion ; and the rivulet
                    then moves with greater ſpeed, as we have now learned. At the ſame time, the
                    ſurface expoſed to evaporation and abſorption is dimi-niſhed by the union of the
                    riils. Four equal rills have only the ſurface of two when united. Thus the
                    portion which eſcapes arreſtment, and travels downward, is continually
                    increaſing. This is a happy adjuſtment-to the other operations of nature. Were
                    it otherwiſe, the lower and more valuable countries would be loaded wu'th the
                    paſſing waters in addition to their own fur-' plus rains, and the immediate
                    neighbourhood of the ſea would be almoſt covered by the drains of the interior</p>

                <p>countries. But, fortunately, thoſe paſſing waters occupy leſs room as they
                    advance, and by this wiſe employment of the moſt ſimple means, not only are the
                    ſuperfluous waters drained off from our fertile fields, but the drains
                    themſelves become an uſeful part of the country by their magnitude. They become
                    the habitation of a prodigious number of fiſhes, which ſhare the Creator’s
                    bounty ; and they become the means of mutual communication of all the bleſſings
                    of cultivated ſociety. The vague ramblings of the rivers ſcatter them over the
                    face of the country, and bring them to every door. It is not even an indifferent
                    circumſtance, that they gather ſtrength to cut out deep beds for themſelves. By
                    this means they cut open many ſprings. Without this, the produce of a heavy
                    ſhower would make a ſwamp which would not dry up in many days. And it muſt be
                    ob-ſerved, that the ſame heat which is neceſſary for the vigorous growth of
                    uſeful plants will produce a very copious evaporation. This muſt return in
                    ſhowers much too copious for immediate vegetation, and the overplus would be
                    deſtructive. Is it not pleaſant to contemplate this adjuſtment of the great
                    operations of. nature, ſo different from each other, that if chance alone
                    directed the detail, it was almoſt an infinite odds that the earth would be
                    uninhabitable ?</p>
                <p>But let us follow the waters in their operations, and note the face of the
                    countries through which they flow: attending to the breadth, the depth, and the
                    ſlope of the valleys, we ſhall be convinced that their preſent ſituation is
                    extremely different from what it was in ancient days ; and that the valleys
                    themſelves are the works of the rivers, or at leaſt of waters which have
                    deſeended from the heights, loaded with all the lighter matters which they were
                    able to bring away with them. The rivers flow now in beds which have a
                    conſiderable permanency ; but this has been the work of ages. This has given
                    ſtability, both by filling up and ſmoothing the valleys, and thus leſſening the
                    changing cauſes, and alſo by hardening the beds themſelves, which are now
                    covered with aquatic plants, and lined with the ſtones, gravel, and coaiſer
                    fand, out of which all the lighter matters have been waſhed away.</p>
                <p>The ſurface of the high grounds is undergoing a continual change ; and the
                    ground on which we now walk is,by no means the ſarfie which was trodden by our
                    remote anceſtors. The ſhowers from heaven carry ' down into the valleys, or
                    ſweep along by the torrents, a part of the foil which covers the heights and
                    ſteeps. The torrents' carry this foil into the brooks, and theſe deliver part of
                    it into the great rivers, and theſe diſcharge into the ſea this fertilizing fat
                    of the earth, where it is ſwallowed up, and forever loſt for the pur-poſes of
                    vegetation. Thus the hillocks lofe of their height, the valleys are filled up,
                    and the mountains are laid bare, and ſhow their naked precipices, which formerly
                    were covered over with a fleſh and ſkin, but now look like the ſkeleton of this
                    globe. The low countries, raiſed and nouriſhed for ſome time by the ſub-ſtance
                    of the high lands, will go in their turn to be buried in the ocean ; and then
                    the earth, reduced to a dreary flat, will become an immenſe uninhabitable maſs.
                    This cataſtrophe is far diſtant, becauſe this globe is in its youth, but it is
                    not the leſs certain ; and the united labours of the human race could not long
                    protract the term.</p>
                <p>But, in the mean time, we can trace a beneficent</p>
                <p>pnrpoſe, and a nice adjuſtment oſſeemingly remote cir-cumſtances. The grounds
                    near the ſources of all our rivers are indeed gradually ſtripped of their moſt
                    fertile ingredients. But had they retained them for ages, the ſentient
                    inhabitants of the earth, or at leaſt the nobler animals, with man at their
                    head, would not have derived much advantage from it. The general laws of nature
                    produce changes in our atmoſphere which muſt ever render theſe great elevations
                    unfruitful. That genial warmth, which is equally neceſſary for 'the uſeful plant
                    as for the animaΓwhich lives on it, is confined to the lower grounds. The earth,
                    which on the top of mount Hæmus could only bring forth moſs and dittany, when
                    brought into the gardens of Spalatro, produced pot-herbs ſo luxuriant, that
                    Diocleſian told his colleague Maximian that he had more pleaſure in their
                    cultivation than the Roman empire could confer. Thus nature not only provides us
                    manure, but conveys it to our fields. She even keeps it ſafe in ſtore for us
                    till it ſhall be wanted. The tracts, of country which are but newly inhabited by
                    man, ſuch as great part of America, and the newly diſcovered regions of Terra
                    Auſtralis, are ſtill almoſt occupied by marſhes and lakes, or covered with
                    impenetrable ſoreſts ; and they'would remain long enough in this ſtate, if
                    population, continually increaſing, did not increaſe induſtry, and multiply the
                    hands of cultivators along with their neceſſities. The Author of Nature was
                    alone able to form the huge ridges of the mountains, to model the hillocks and
                    the valleys, to mark out the courſes of the great rivers, and give the firſt
                    trace to every rivulet ; but has left to man the taſlc of draining his own
                    habitation and the fields which are to ſupport him, becauſe this is a tafle not
                    beyond his powers. It was therefore of immenſe advantage to him that thoſe parts
                    of the globe into which he has not yet penetrated ſhould remain covered with
                    lakes, marſhes, and ſoreſts, which keep in ſtore the juice of the earth, which
                    the influence of the air and the vivifying warmth of the ſun would have expended
                    long ere now in uſeleſs vegetation, and which the .rains of heaven would have
                    ſwept into the ſea, had they not been thus protected by their ſituation or their
                    cover. It is therefore the buſineſs of man to open up theſe mines of hoarded
                    wealth, and to thank the Author of ail good, who has thus huſhanded them for his
                    uſe, and left them as a rightful heritage for thoſe of after days.</p>
                <p>The earth had not in the remote ages, as in our day, thoſe great canals, thoſe
                    capacious voiders, always ready to drain off the rain waters (of which only part
                    is ab-forbed by the thirſty ground), and the pure waters of the ſprings from the
                    foot of the hills. The rivers did not then exiſt, or were only torrents, whoſe
                    waters, confined by the gullies and glens, are ſearching for a place to eſcape.
                    Hence ariſe thoſe numerous lakes in the interior of great continents, of which
                    there are ſtill remarkable relicks in North America, which in pro-ceſs of time
                    will diſappear, and become champaign countries. The moſt remote from the ſea,
                    unable to contain its waters, finds an iſſue through ſome gorge of the hills,
                    and pours over its ſuperfluous waters into a lower hafon, which, in its turn,
                    diſcharges its contents into another, and the laſt of the chain delivers its
                    waters by a river into the ocean. The communication was originally begun by a
                    ſimple overflowing at the Iow’eſt part of the margin. This made a torrent, which</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0283" facs="gri_33125011196389_0289.tif"/>
                <p>quickly deepened its bed ; and this circqmſtance increaſing its velocity, as we
                    have ſeen, would extend this deepening backward to the lake, and draw off more
                    of its waters. The work would go on rapidly at firſt, while earth and ſmall
                    ſtones only reſiſted the labours of nature ; but theſe being waſhed away, and
                    the channel hollowed out to the firm rock on all ſides, the operation muſt go on
                    very ſlowly, till the immenſe caſcade ſhall undermine what it cannot break off,
                    and then a new diſcharge will commence, and a quantity of flat ground will
                    emerge all round the lake. The torrent, in the mean time, makes its way down the
                    country, and digs a canal, which may be called the firſt ſhetch of a river,
                    which will deepen and widen its bed continually. The waters of ſeveral baſons
                    united, and running together in a great body, will (according to the principles
                    we have eſtabliſhed) have a much greater velocity, with the fame ſlope, than
                    thoſe of the lakes in the interior parts of the continent ; and the ſum of them
                    all united in the baſon next the ſea, after having broken through its natural
                    mound, 'will make a prodigious torrent, which will dig for itſelf a bed ſo much
                    the deeper as it has more ſlope and a greater body of waters.</p>
                <p>The formation of the firſt valleys, by cutting open many ſprings which were
                    formerly concealed under ground, will add to the maſs of running waters, and
                    contribute to drain off the waters of theſe baſons. In courſe of time many of
                    them will diſappear, and flat valleys among the mountains and hills are the
                    traces of their former exiſtence.</p>
                <p>When nature thus traces out the courſes of future rivers, it is to be expected
                    that thoſe ſtreams will moſt deepen their channels which in their approach to
                    the ſea receive into their bed the greateſt quantities of rain and ſpring
                    waters, and that towards the middle of the continent they will deepen their
                    channels leſs. In theſe laſt ſituations the natural ſlope of the fields cauſes
                    the rain-water, rills, and the little rivulets from the ſprings, to ſeek their
                    way to the rivers. The ground can fink only by the flattening of the hills and
                    high grounds ; and this muſt proceed with extreme ſlowneſs, becauſe it is only
                    the gentle, though inceſſant, work of the rains and ſprings. But the rivers,
                    increaſing in bulk and ſtrength, and of neceſſity ſlowing over every thing, form
                    to themſelves capacious beds in a more yielding foil, and dig them even to the
                    level of the ocean.</p>
                <p>The beds of rivers by no means form themſelves in one inclined plane. If we
                    ſhould ſuppoſe a canal AB (fig. 12.) perfectly ſtraight and horizontal at B,
                    where it joins with the ſea, this canal would really be an inclined channel of
                    greater and greater ſlope as it is farther from B. This is evident ; becauſe
                    gravity is directed towards the centre of the earth, and the angle CAB contained
                    between the channel and the plumb-line at A is ſmaller than the ſimilar angle
                    CDB ; and conſequently the inclination to the horizon is greater in A. than in
                    D. Such a canal therefore would make the bed of a river ; and ſome have thought
                    that this was the real form of nature’s work ; but the ſuppoſition is a whim,
                    and it is falle. No river has a ſlope at all approaching to this. It would be 8
                    inches declivity in the mile next the ocean, 24 inches in the ſecond mile, 40
                    inches in the third, and ſo on in the duplicate ratio (for the whole elevation)
                    of the diſtances from the ſea. Such a river would quickly tear up its bed in the
                    moun</p>
                <p>tains (were there any grounds high enough to receive it), and, except its firſt
                    caſcade, would ſoon acquire a more gentle ſlope. But the fact is, and it is the
                    reſult of the impreſcriptible laws of nature, that the continued track of a
                    river is a ſucceſſion of inclined channels, whoſe ſlope diminiſhes by ſteps as
                    the river approaches to the ſea. It is not enough to ſay that this reſults from
                    the natural ſlope of the .countries through which it flows, which we obſerve to
                    increaſe in declivity as we go to the interior parts of the continent. Were it
                    otherwiſe, the equilibrium to which nature aims in all her operations w <hi
                        rend="sup"> r</hi> ould ſtill produce the gradual diminution of the ſlope
                    of rivers. Without it they could not be in a permanent train.</p>
                <p>That we may more eaſily form a notion of the manner in which the permanent
                    courſe of a river is eſtabliſhed, let us ſuppoſe a ſtream or rivulet <hi
                        rend="italic"> sa</hi> (fig. 13.) far up the country, make its way through
                    a ſoil perfectly uniform to the ſea, taking the courſe <hi rend="italic">sabedeſ,</hi> and receiving t)be <hi rend="italic">permanent additions</hi> of the ſtreams <hi rend="italic">g a, h b, i c, k d, le,</hi> and that
                    its velocity and ſlope in all its parts are ſo ſuited to the tenacity of the
                    ſoil and ► magnitude of its ſection, that neither do its w aters during the
                    annual frtſhes tear up its banks or deepen its bed, nor do they bring down from
                    the high lands materials which they depolit in the channel in times of ſmaller
                    velocity. Such a riveç may be ſaid to be in a <hi rend="italic">permanentſlate,</hi> to be in <hi rend="italic">conſervntion,</hi> or to have <hi
                        rend="italic"> Jlability.</hi> Let us call this ſtate of a river fits
                    regimen, denoting by the word the proper adjuſtment of the velocity of the
                    ſtream to the tenacity of the channel. Ί he velocity of its regimen muſt be the
                    ſame throughout, becauſe it is this which regulates its action on the bottom,
                    which is the ſame from its head to the ſea. That its bed may have ſtability, the
                    mean velocity of the current muſt be conſtant, notwithſtanding the inequality of
                    diſcharge through its different fictions by the brocks which it receives in its
                    courſe, and notwithſtanding the augmentation of its ſection as it approaches the
                    ſea.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, it behoved this exact regimen to commence at the mouth of the
                    river, by the working of the whole body of the river, in concert with the waters
                    of the ocean, which always keep within the fame limits, and make the ultimate
                    level invariable. This working will begin to dig the bed, giving it as little
                    breadth as poſſible : for this working conſiſts chiefly in the efforts of falls
                    and rapid llreâms, which ariſe of themſelves in every channel which has too much
                    ſlope. <hi rend="sup">r</hi> l he bottom deepens, and the ſides remain very
                    ſteep, till they, are undermined and crumble down ; and being-then diluted in
                    the water, they are carried down the ſtream, and depoſited where the ocean
                    checks its ſpeed. The banks crumble down anew, the valley or hollow forms ; but
                    the ſection, always confined to its bottom, cannot acquire a great breadth, and
                    it retains a good deal of the form of the trapezium formerly mentioned. In this
                    manner does the regimen begin to be eſtabliſhed from <hi rend="italic">f</hi> to <hi rend="italic">e.</hi></p>
                <p>With reſpect to the next part <hi rend="italic">de,</hi> the diſcharge or

                    muſt take a ſimilar form, but its area will be diminiſhed, in order that its
                    velocity may be the ſame; and its mean depth <hi rend="italic">d</hi> being
                    leſs than in the portion <hi rend="italic">eſ</hi> below, the ſlope muſt be
                    greater. Without theſe conditions we could not have the uniform velocity, which
                    the aſſumed</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0284" facs="gri_33125011196389_0290.tif"/>
                <p>permanency in an uniform ſoil neceſſarily ſuppoſes. Reaſoning after the ſame
                    manner for all the portions <hi rend="italic">c d <hi rend="sub">i</hi> b c,
                        a b, s a,</hi> we ſee that the regimen will be ſucceſſively eſtabliſhed in
                    them, and that the ſlope neceſſary for this purpoſe will be greater as we
                    approach the river head. The vertical ſection or profile of the courſe of the
                    river <hi rend="italic">sabedeſ</hi> will therefore reſemble the line SABCDEF
                    which is ſhetehed below, having its different parts variouſly inclined to the
                    horizontal line HF.</p>
                <p>Such is the proceſs of nature to be obſerved in every river on the ſurface of
                    the globe. It long appeared a kind of puzzle to the theoriſts ; and it was this
                    obſer-vation of the increaſing, or at leaſt this continued velocity with ſmaller
                    ſlope, as the rivers increaſed by the addition of their tributary ſtreams, which
                    cauſed Gu-glielmini to have recourſe to his new principle, the energy of deep
                    waters. We have now ſeen in what this energy conſiſts. It is only a greater
                    quantity of motion remaining in the middle of a great ſtream of water after a
                    quantity has been retarded by the ſides and bottom ; and we ſee clearly, that
                    ſince the addition of a new and perhaps an equal ſtream does not occupy a ∙ bed
                    of double ſurface, the proportion of the retardations to tire remaining motion
                    muſt continually diminiſh as a river increaſes by the addition of new ſtreams.
                    If therefore the ſlope were not diminiſhed, the regimen would be deſtroyed, and
                    the river would dig up its channel. We have a full confirmation of this in the
                    many works which have been executed on the Po, which runs with rapidity through
                    a rich and yielding ſoil. About the year' 16oo, the waters of the Panaro, a very
                    conſiderable river, were added to the Po Grande ; and although it brings along
                    with it in its freſhes a vaſt quantity of fand and mud, it has'greatly deepened
                    the whole Tronco di Venezia from the confluence to the ſea. This point was
                    clearly aſcertained by Manfredi about the 1720, when the inhabitants of the
                    valleys adjacent were alarmed by the project of bringing in the waters, of the
                    Rheno, which then ran through the Ferrareſe. Their fears were overcome, and the
                    Pυ Grande continues to deepen its channel every day with a prodigious advantage
                    to the navigations ; and there are ſeveral ex-tenlive marſhes which now drain
                    off by it, after having been for ages under water : and it is to be particularly
                    remarked, that the Rheno is the fouleſt river in its freſhes of any in that
                    country. We inſert this remark, becauſe it may be of great practical utility, as
                    pointing out a method of preſerving and even improving tire depth of rivers or
                    drains in flat countries, which is not obvious, and rather appears improper :
                    but it is ſtrictly conformable to a true theory, and to the operations of
                    nature, which never fails to adjuſt every thing ſo as to bring about an
                    equilibrium. Whatever the declivity of the country may have been originally, the
                    regimen begins to be ſettled at the mouths of the rivers, and the Hopes are
                    diminiſhed in ſucceſſion as we recede from the coaſt. The original ſlopcs inland
                    may have been much greater; but they will (when buſy nature has completed her
                    work) be left ſomewhat, and only ſo much greater, that the velocity may be the
                    ſame notwithſtaiid-ing the diminution of the ſection and mean depth.</p>
                <p>Freſhes will diſturb this methodical progreſs relative only to the ſucceſſive
                    permanent additions ; but their effects chiefly accelerate the deepening of the
                    bed, and</p>
                <p>the diminution of the ſlope, by augmenting the velocity during their
                    continuance. But when the regimen of the permanent additions is once
                    eſtabliſhed, the freſhes tend chiefly to widen the bed, without greatly
                    deepening it : for the aquatic plants, which have been growing and thriving
                    during the peaceable ſtate of the river, are now laid along, but not ſwept away,
                    by the freſhes and protect the bottom from their attacks ; and the ſtones and
                    gravel, which muſt hâve been left bare in a courſe of years, working on the
                    ſoil, will alſo collect in the bottom, and greatly augment its power of
                    reſiſtance ; and even if the floods ſhould have deepened the bottom ſome ſmall
                    matter, ſome mud will be depoſited as the velocity of the freſhes diminiſhes,
                    and this will remain till the next flood.</p>
                <p>We have ſuppoſedthe ſoil uniform through the wholc courſe : This ſeldom happens
                    ; therefore the circum-ſtances which inſure permanency, or the regimen of a
                    river, may be very different in its different parts and in different rivers. We
                    may ſay in general, that the farther that the regimen has advanced up the ſtream
                    in any river, the more ſlowly will it convey its waters to the ſea.</p>
                <p>There are ſome general circumſtances in the motion of rivers which it will be
                    proper to take notice of juſt now, that they may not interrupt our more minute
                    examination of their mechaniſm, and their explanations will then occur of
                    themſelves as corollaries of the proposions which we ſhall endeavour to
                    demonſtrate.</p>
                <p>In a valley of ſmall width the river always occupies the loweſt part of it ; and
                    it is obſerved, that this is ſeldom in the middle of the valley, and is neareſt
                    to that ſide on which the ſlope from the higher grounds is ſteepeſt/ and this
                    without regard to the line of its courſe. The river generally adheres to the
                    ſteepeſt hills, whether they advance into the plaiu or retire ſrom it. This
                    general feature may be obſerved over the whole globe. It is divided into
                    copartments by great ranges of moιiu-tains ; and it may be obſerved, that the
                    great rivers hold their courſe not very far from them, and that their chief
                    feeders come ſrom the other ſide. In every copàrtment there is a ſwell of the
                    low <hi rend="sup">r</hi> country at a diſtance from the bounding ridge of
                    mountains ; and on the ſummit of this ſwell the principal feeders of the great
                    river have their ſources.</p>
                <p>The name <hi rend="italic">valley</hi> is given with leſs propriety to theſe
                    immenſe regions, and is more applicable to tracks of champaign land which the
                    eye can take in at one view. Even here we may obſerve a reſemblance. It is not
                    always in the very loweſt part of this valley that the river has its bed ;
                    although the waters of the river flow in a channel below its immediate banks,
                    theſe banks are frequently higher than the grounds at the foot of the hills.
                    This is very diſtinctly ſeen in Lower Egypt, by means of the canals which are
                    carried backward from the Nile for accelerating its fertilizing inundations;
                    When the caliſhes are opened to admit the waters, it is always obſerved that the
                    diſtricts moſt remote are the firſt covered, and it is ſeveral days before the
                    immediately adjoining fields partake of the bleſſing. This is a conſequence of
                    that general operation of nature by which the valleys are formed. The river in
                    its floods is loaded with mud, which it retains as long as it rolls rapidly
                    along its limited bed, tumbling its w <hi rend="sup">τ</hi> aters over and
                    over, and taking up in every ſpot as much as</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0285" facs="gri_33125011196389_0291.tif"/>
                <p>it depoſits : but as ſoon as it overflows its banks, the ' very enlargement of
                    its ſection diminiſhes the velocity of the water ; and it may be obſerved ſtill
                    running in the track of its bed with great velocity, while the waters on each
                    ſide are ſtagnant at a very ſmall diſtance : Therefore the water, on getting
                    over the banks, muſt depoſit the heavieſt, the firmeſt, and even the greateſt
                    part of its burden, and muſt become gradually clearer to it approaches the
                    hills. Thus a gentle ſlope is given as the valley in a direction which is the
                    reverſe of what one would expect. It is, however, almoſt always the caſe in wide
                    valleys, eſpecially if the great river comes through a ſoft country. The banks
                    of the brooks and ditches are obſerved to be deeper as they approach the river,
                    and the merely ſuperſicial drains run backwards</p>
                <p>from it.</p>
                <p>We have already obſerved, that the enlargement of-the bed of a river, in its
                    approach to the ſea, is not in proportion to the increaſe of its waters. This
                    would be the caſe even if the velocity continued the ſame : and therefore, ſince
                    the velocity even increaſes, in con-ſequence of the greater energy of a large
                    body of ∖ya-ter, which we now underſtand diſtinctly, a ſtill ſmaller bed is
                    ſufficient for conveying all the water to the ſea.</p>
                <p>This general law is broken, however, in the immediate neighbourhood of the ſea ;
                    becauſe in this ſituation the velocity of the water is checked by the paſſing
                    flood-tides of the ocean. As the whole waters muſt ſtill be diſeharged, they
                    require a larger bed, and the enlargement will be chiefly in width. The fand and
                    mud are depoſited when the motion is retarded. The depth of the mouth of the
                    channel is therefore dimi-niihed. It muſt therefore become wider. If this be
                    done on a coaſt expoſed to the force of a regular tide, which carries the waters
                    of the ocean acroſs the mouth of the river, this regular enlargement of the
                    mouth will ' be the only conſequence, and it will generally widen till it waſhes
                    the foot of the adjoining hills ; but if</p>
                <p>- there be no tide in the ſea, or a tide which does not <hi rend="italic">ſet</hi> acroſs the mouth of the river, the ſands muſt be depoſited at the ſides of
                    the opening, and become additions to the ſliore, lengthening the mouth of the
                    chan-.nel. In this ſheltered ſituation, every trivial circumſtance will cauſe
                    the river' to work more on particular parts of the bottom, and deepen the
                    channel there. This keeps the mud ſuſpended in ſuch parts of the channel, and it
                    is not depoſited till the ſtream has ſhot farther out into the ſea. It is
                    depoſited on the ſides of thoſe deeper parts of the channel, and increaſes the
                    velocity in them, and thus ſtill farther protracts the de-poſition. Rivers ſo
                    ſituated will not only lengthen their channels, but will divide them, and
                    produce iſlands at their mouths. A buſh, a tree, torn up by the roots by a
                    mountain torrent, and floated down the ſtream, will thus inevitably produce an
                    iſland; and rivers in which this is common will be continually ſhifting their
                    mouths. The Miſſiflippi is a moſt remarkable inſtance of this. It has a long
                    courſe through a rich- ſoil, and diſembogucs itſelf into the bay of Mexico, in a
                    place where there is no <hi rend="italic">Paſſing tide,</hi> as may be ſeen by
                    comparing the hours of high water in different places. No river that we know
                    carries down its ſtream ſuch numbers of rooted-up trees : they frequently
                    interrupt the navigation, and render it always dangerous in the nighU-</p>
                <p>time. This river is ſo beſet with flats and ſhifting ſands at its mouth, that
                    the moſt experienced pilots are puzzled ; and it has protruded its channel above
                    50 miles in the ſhort period that we have known it. The diſcharge of the Danube
                    is very ſimilar : ſo is that of the Nile ; for it is diſeharged into a ſtill
                    corner of the Mediterranean. It may now be ſaid to have acquired conſiderable
                    permanency; but much of this is owing to human induſtry, which ſtrips it as much
                    as poſſible of its ſubſideable matter. The Ganges too is in a ſituation pretty
                    ſimilar, and exhibits ſimilar phenomena. The Maragnon might be noticed as an
                    exception ; but. it is not an exception. It has flowed very ſar in a level bed,
                    and its waters come pretty clear to Para ; but beſides, there is a ſtrong
                    tranſverle tide, or rather current, at its mouth, ſetting to the ſouth-eaſt both
                    during flood and ebb. The mouth of the Po is perhaps the moſt remarkable of any
                    on the ſurface of this globe, and exhibits appearances extremely Angular. Its
                    diſcharge is into a ſequeſtered corner of the Adriatic. Though there be a more
                    remarkable tide in this gulf than in any part of the Mediterranean, it is ſtill
                    but trifling, and it either ſets directly in upon the mouth of the river, or
                    retires ſtraight away from it. The river has many mouths, and they ſhift
                    prodigiouſly. There has been a general increaſe of the land very remarkable. The
                    marſhes where Venice now ſtands were, in the Auguſtan age, everywhere penetrable
                    by the ſiſhing boats, and in the yth century could only bear a few miſerable
                    huts ; now <hi rend="sup">r</hi> they are covered with crowds of ſtately
                    buildings. Ravenna, ſi-tuated on the ſouthernmoſt mouth of the Po, was, in the
                    Auguſtan age, at the extremity of a ſwamp, and the road to it was along the top
                    of an artificial mound, made by Auguſtus at immenſe expence. It was, however, a
                    fine city, containing extenſive docks, arſenals, and other maſſy buildings,
                    being the great military port of the empire, where Auguſtus laid up his great
                    ſhips ,of war. In the Gothic times it became almoſt the capital of the Weſtern
                    empire, and was the ſeat of government and of luxury. It muſt, therefore, be
                    ſuppo-ſed to have every accommodation of opulence, and we cannot doubt of its
                    having paved ſtreets, wharfs, &amp;c. ; ſo that its wealthy inhabitants were
                    at leaſt walking dryfooted from houſe to houſc. But now it is an Italian mile
                    from the ſea, and ſurrounded with vineyards and cultivated fields, and is
                    acceſſible in every direction. All this muſt have been formed by depoiitions
                    from the-Po, flowing through Lombardy loaded with the ſpoils of the Alp», which
                    were here arreſted by the reeds and bulruſhes of the marſh. Theſe things are in
                    common courſe ; but when wells are dug, we come to the pavements of the ancient
                    city, and theſe. pavements are all on one exact level, and they <hi
                        rend="italic"> are eigh t ſeet below the ſurface of the ſea at low water.</hi> This cannot be aſeribed to the fubſiding. of the ancient city. This would
                    be irregular, and greateſt among the heavy buildings. The tomb of Theodoric
                    remains, and the pavement round it is on a level with all the others. The lower
                    ſtory is always full of water ; ſo is the lower ſtory of the cathedral to the
                    depth of three feet. The ornaments of both theſe buildings leave no room to
                    doubt that they were formerly dry ; and ſuch a building as the cathedral could
                    not fink without crumbling into pieces.</p>
                <p>It is by no means eaſy to account for all this. The.</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0286" facs="gri_33125011196389_0292.tif"/>
                <p>depoſitions of the Po and other rivers muſt raiſe the ground; and yet the rivers
                    muſt ſtill flow overall. We muſt conclude that the ſurface of the Adriatic is by
                    no means level, and that it ſlopes like a river from the Lagoons of Venice to
                    the eaſtward. In all probability it even ſlopes conſiderably outwards from the
                    ſhore. This will not hinder the alternations of ebb and flow tide, as will be
                    ſhown in its proper place. The whole ſhores of this gulph exhibit moſt uncommon
                    appearances.</p>
                <p>The laſt general obſervations which we ſhall make in this place is, that the
                    ſurface of a river is not flat, conſidered athwart the ſtream, but convex : this
                    is owing to its motion. Suppoſe a canal of ſtagnant water ; its ſurface would be
                    a perfect level. But ſuppoſe it poſſible by any means to give the middle waters
                    a motion in the direction of its length, they muſt drag along with them the
                    waters immediately contiguous. Theſe will move leſs ſwiftly, and will in like
                    manner drag the waters without them ; and thus the water at the ſides being
                    abſtracted, the depth muſt be leſs, and the general ſurface muſt be convex
                    acroſs. The fact in a running ſtream is ſimilar to this ; the ſide waters are
                    withheld by the ſides, and every filament is moving more ſlowly than the one
                    next it towards the middle of the river, but falter than the adjoining filament
                    on the land ſide. This alone muſt produce a convexity of ſurface. But beſides
                    this, it is demonſtrable that the preſſure of a running ſtream is diminiſhed by
                    its motion, and the diminution is proportional to the height which would produce
                    the velocity with which it is gliding paſt the adjoining filament. This
                    convexity muſt in all caſes be very ſmall. Few rivers have the .velocity nearly
                    equal to eight feet <hi rend="italic">per</hi> ſecond, and this requires a
                    height of one foot only. An author quoted by Mr Buffon ſays, that he has
                    obſerved on the river Aveiron an elevation of three feet in the middle during
                    floods; but we ſuſpect ſome error in the obſervation.</p>
                <p>§ 4. <hi rend="italic">Of the Windings of Rivers.</hi></p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Rivers are ſeldom ſtraight in their courſe. Formed by the
                        hand of nature, they are accommodated to every change of circumſtance. They
                        wind around what they cannot get over., and work their way to either ſide
                        according as the reſiſtance of the oppoſite bank makes a ſtraight courſe
                        more difficult ; and this ſeemingly fortuitous rambling diſtributes them
                        more uniformly over the ſurface of a country, and makes them every where
                        more at hand, to receive the numberleſs rills and rivulets which collect the
                        waters of our ſprings and the ſuper-fluities of our ſhowers, and to comfort
                        our habitations with the many advantages which cultivation and ſociety can
                        derive ſrom their preſence. In their feeble beginnings the ſmalleſt
                        inequality of ſlope or conſiſtency is enough to turn them aſide and make
                        them ramble through every field, giving drink to our herds and fertility to
                        our ſoil. The more we follow nature into.the minutiæ of her operations, the
                        more muſt we admire the inexhauſtible fertility of her reſources, and the
                        ſim-ρlicity of the means by which ſhe produces the moſt important and
                        beneficial effects. By thus twiſting the courſe of our rivers into 10,coo
                        ſhapes, ſhe keeps them long amidſt our fields, and thus compenſates for the
                        declivity of the ſurface, which' otherwiſe would tumble them with great
                        rapidity into the ocean, loaded with the beſt and richeſt of our ſoil.
                        Without this, the</hi></p>
                <p>ſhowers of heaven would have little influence in ſupply-ing the waſte of
                    inceſſant evaporation. But as things are, the rains are kept ſlowly trickling
                    along the ſlo-ping ſides of our hills and ſteeps, winding round every clod, nay
                    every plant, which lengthens their courſe, diminiſhes their Hope, checks their
                    ſpeed, and thus prevents them from quickly bruſhing off from every part of the
                    ſurface the lighteſt and beſt of the ſoil. The flatteſt of our holm lands would
                    be too ſteep, and the rivers would ſhoot along through our ſineſt meadows,
                    hurrying every thing away with them, and would be unfit for the purpofes of
                    inland conveyance, if the inequalities of ſoil did not make them change this
                    headlong courſe for the more beautiful meanders which we obſerve in the courſe
                    of the ſmall rivers winding through our meadows. Thoſe rivers are in general the
                    ſtraight-eſt in their courſe which are the moſt rapid, and which roll along the
                    greateſt bodies of water ; ſuch are the Rhone, the Po, the Danube. The ſmaller
                    rivers continue more devious in their progreſs, till they approach the ſea, and
                    have gathered ſtrength from all their tributary ſtreams.</p>
                <p>Every thing aims at an equilibrium, and this directs even the ramblings of
                    rivers. It is of importance to underſtand the relation between the force of a
                    river and the reſiſtance which the ſoil oppoſes to thoſe deviations from a
                    rectilineal courſe ; for it may frequently happen that the general procedure of
                    nature may be inconſiſtent with our local purpoſes. Man was ſet down on thia
                    globe, and the taſlc of cultivating it was given him by nature, and his chief
                    enjoyment ſeems to be to ſtruggle with the elements. He muſt not find things to
                    his mind, but he muſt mould them to his own fancy. Yet even this ſeeming anomaly
                    is one of nature’s moſt beneficent laws; and his exertions muſt ſtill be made in
                    conformity with the general train of the operations of mechanical nature : and
                    when we have any work to undertake relative to the courſe of rivers, we muſt be
                    careful not to thw <hi rend="sup">τ</hi> art their general rules, otherwiſe we
                    ſhall be ſooner or later puniſhed for their infraction. Things will be brought
                    back to tſheir former ſtate, if our operations are inconſiſtent with that
                    equilibrium which is conſtantly aimed at, or ſome new ſtate of things which is
                    equivalent will be ſoon induced.-If a well regulated river has been improperly
                    deepen ed in ſome place, to anſwer ſome particular purpoſe of our own, or if its
                    breadth has been improperly augmented, we ſhall ſoon ſee a depoſition of mud or
                    fand choak up our ſancied improvements ; becauſe, as we have enlarged the
                    ſection without increaſing the ſlope or the ſupply, the velocity muſt diminiſh,
                    and floating matters muſt be depoſited.</p>
                <p>It is true, we frequently fee permanent channels where the forms are extremely
                    different from that which the waters would dig for themſelves in an uniform
                    ſoil, and which approaches a good deal to the trapezium deſcribed formerly. We
                    ſee a greater breadth frequently compenſate for a want of depth ; but all ſuch
                    deviations are a ſort of conſtraint, or rather are indications of inequality of
                    foil. Such irregular forms are the wOrks of nature ; and if they are permanent,
                    the equilibrium is obtained. Commonly the bottom is harder than the ſides,
                    conſiſting of the coarſeſt of the fand and of gravel; and therefore the
                    neceſſary ſection can be obtained only by increaſing the width. We</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0287" facs="gri_33125011196389_0293.tif"/>
                <p>are accuſtomed , to attend chiefly to the appearances which prognoſticate
                    miſchief, and we interpret the appearances of a permanent bed in the ſame way,
                    and frequently form very falſe judgments. When we ſee one bank low and flat, and
                    the other high and abrupt, we ſuppoſe that the waters are paſſing along the
                    firſt; in peace, and with a gentle ſtream, but that they are rapid on the other
                    ſide, and are tearing away the bank ; but it is juſt the contrary. The bed being
                    permanent, things are in equilibrio, and each bank is of a form juſt competent
                    to that equilibrium. If »he ſoil on both ſides be uniform, the ſtream is moſt
                    rapid on that ſide where the bank is low and flat, for in no other form would it
                    withſtand the action of the ſtream ; and it has been worn away till its flatneſs
                    compenſates for the greater force of the ſtream. The ſtream on the other ſide
                    muſt be more gentle, otherwiſe the bank could not remain abrupt. In ſhort, in a
                    ſtate of permanency, the velocity of the ſtream and form of the bank are juſt
                    ſuited to each other. It is quite otherwiſe before the river has acquired its
                    proper regimen.</p>
                <p>A careful conſideration therefore of the general features of rivers which have
                    ſettled their regimen, is of uſe for informing us concerning their internal
                    motions, and directing us to the moſt effectual methods of regulating their
                    courſe.</p>
                <p>We have already ſaid that perpendicular brims are inconſiſtent with ſtability. A
                    ſemicircular ſection is the form which would produce the quickeſt train of a
                    river whoſe expence and Hope are given ; but the banks at B and D (fig. 14.)
                    would crumble in, and lie at the bottom, where their horizontal ſurface would
                    ſecure them from farther change. The bed will acquire the form G <hi
                        rend="italic"> c</hi> F, of equal ſection, but greater width, and with
                    brims leſs ſhelving. The proportion of the velocities at A and <hi rend="italic"
                        > c</hi> may be the fame with that of the velocities at A and C ; but the
                    velocity at G and F will be leſs than it was formerly at B, C, or D; and the
                    velocity in any intermediate point E, being ſomewhat between thoſe at F and <hi
                        rend="italic"> c,</hi> muſt be leſs than it was in any intermediate point
                    of the ſemicircular bed. The velocities will therefore decreaſe along the border
                    ſrom <hi rend="italic">c</hi> towards G and F, and the ſteepneſs of the border
                    will augment at the ſame time, till, in every point of the new border GcF, theſe
                    two circumſtances will be ſo adjuſted that the neceſſary equilibrium is
                    eſtabliſhed.</p>
                <p>The ſame thing muſt happen in our trapezium. The ſlope of the brims may be
                    exact, and will be retained ; it will, however, be too great anywhere below,
                    where the velocity is greater, and the ſides will be worn away till the bankδ
                    are undermined and crumble down, and the river will maintain its ſection by
                    increaſing its width. In ſhort, no border made up of ſtraight lines is
                    conſiſtent with that gradation of velocity which will take place whenever we
                    depart from a ſemicircular form. And we accordingly ſee, that in all natural
                    channels the ſection has a curvilineal border, with the ſlope increaſing
                    gradually from the bottom to the brim.</p>
                <p>Theſe obſervations will enable us to underſtand how nature operates when the
                    inequality of ſurface or of tenacity obliges the current to change its
                    direction, and the river forms an elbow.</p>
                <p>Suppoſinjg always that the diſcharge continues the fame, and that the mean
                    velocity is either preſerved or</p>
                <p>reſtored, the following conditions are neceſſary for a permanent regimen.</p>
                <p>ί. The depth of water muſt be greater in the elbow than anywhere elſe.</p>
                <p>2. The main ſtream, after having ſtruck the concave bank, muſt be reflected in
                    an equal angle, and muſt then be in the direction of the next reach of the
                    river.</p>
                <p>3. The angle of-incidence muſt be proportioned to the tenacity of the ſoil.</p>
                <p>4. There muſt be in the elbow an increaſe of ſlope, or of head of water, capable
                    of overcoming the reſiſtance occaſioned by the elbow.</p>
                <p><hi rend="sub">s</hi> The reaſonableneſs, at leaſt, of theſe conditions will
                    appear from the following conſiderations.</p>
                <p>]. It is certain that force is expended in producing this change of direction in
                    a channel which by ſuppoſition diminiſhes the current. The diminution aτifing
                    from any cauſe which can be compared with friction muſt be greater when the
                    ſtream is directed againſt one of the banks. It may be very difficult to ſtate
                    the proportion, and it would occupy too mach of our time to attempt it ; but it
                    is ſufficient that we be convinced that the retardation is greater in this caſe.
                    We ſee no cauſe to increaſe the mean velocity in the elbow, and we muſt
                    therefore conclude that it is diminiſhed. But we are ſuppoſing that the
                    diſcharge continues the ſame; the ſection muſt therefore augment, or the channel
                    increaſe its tranſverſe dimenſions. The only queſtion is, In what manner it does
                    this, and what change of form does it affect, and what form is competent to the
                    final equilibrium and the conſequent permanency of the bed ? Here there is much
                    room for conjecture. Mr Buat reaſons as ſollows. If we ſuppoſe that the points B
                    and C (fig. 15.) continue on a level, and that the points H and I at the
                    beginning of the next reach are alſo on a level, it is an inevitable conſequence
                    that the ſlope along CMl muſt be greater than along BEH, becauſe the depreſſion
                    of H below B is equal to that of I below C, and BEH is longer than CMI.
                    Therefore the velocity along the convex bank CMI muſt be greater than along BEH.
                    There may even be a ſtagnation and an eddy in the contrary direction along the
                    concave bank. Therefore, if the form of the ſection were the ſame as up the
                    ſtream, the ſides could not ſtand on the convex bank. When therefore the ſection
                    has attained a permanent form, and the banks are again in equilibrio with the
                    action of the current, the convex bank muſt be much flatter than the concave. If
                    the water is really ſtill on the concave bank, that bank will be abfo-lutely
                    perpendicular ; nay, may overhang.—Accordingly, this ſtate of things is matter
                    of daily obſervation, and juſtiſies our reaſoning, and entitles us to ſay, that
                    this is the nature of the internal motion of the filaments which we cannot
                    diſtinctly obſerve. The water moves moſt rapidly along the convex bank, and the
                    thread of the ſtream is neareſt to this ſide. Reaſoning in this way, the
                    ſection, which we may ſuppoſe to have been originally of the form MiaE (fig.
                    16.) aſſumes the ſhape MBAE.</p>
                <p>2. Without preſuming to know the mechaniſm of the internal motions of fluids, we
                    know that ſuperſicial waves are reflected preciſely as if they were ehtſtſe
                    bodies, making the angles of incidence and reflection equal,. In as far
                    therefore as the ſuperficial wave is concerned in the operation, Mr Buat’s
                    ſecond poſition is juſt».</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0288" facs="gri_33125011196389_0294.tif"/>
                <p>The permanency of the next reach requires that its axis ſhall be in the
                    direction of the line EP which makes the angle GEP=FEN. If the next reach has
                    the direction EQ, MR, the wave reflected in the line ES will work on the bank at
                    S, and will be reflected in the line ST, and work again on the oppoſite bank at
                    T. We know that the effect of the ſuperſicial motion is great, and that it is
                    the principal agent in deſtroying the banks of canals. So ſar therefore Mr Buat
                    is right. We cannot ſay with any pre-ciſion or confidence how the actions of the
                    under filaments are modified ; but we know no reaſon for not extending to the
                    under filaments what appears ſo probable with reſpect to the ſurface water.</p>
                <p>3. The third poſition is no leſs evident. We do not know the mode of action of
                    the water on the bank ; but our general notions on this ſubject, confirmed by
                    common experience, tell us that the more obliquely a ſtream of water beats on
                    any bank, the leſs it tends to undermine it or waſh it away. A ſtiff and
                    coheſive foil therefore will ſuffer no more from being almoſt perpendicularly
                    buffetted by a ſtream than a friable fand would ſuffer from water gliding along
                    its face. Mr Buat thinks, from experience, that a clay bank is not ſenſibly
                    affected till the angle FEB is about 36 degrees.</p>
                <p>4. Since there are cauſes of retardation, and we ſtill ſuppoſe that the
                    diſcharge is kept up, and that the mean velocity, which had been diminiſhed by
                    the enlargement of the ſection, is again reſtored, we muſt grant that there is
                    provided, in the mechaniſm of theſe motions, an accelerating force adequate to
                    this effect. There can be no accelerating force in an open ſtream but the
                    ſuperſicial ſlope. In the preſent caſe it is undoubtedly ſo 5 becauſe by the
                    deepening of the bottom where there is an elbow in the ſtream, we have of
                    neceſſity a counter ſlope. Now, all this head of water, which muſt produce the
                    augmentation of velocity in that part of the ſtream which ranges round the
                    convex bank, will ariſe from the check which the water gets from the concave
                    bank. This occaſions a gorge or ſwell up the ſtream, enlarges a little the
                    ſection at BVC; and this, by the principle of uniform motion, will augment all
                    the velocities, deepen the channel, and put every thing again into its train as
                    ſoon as the water gets into the next reach. The water at the bottom of this
                    baſon has very little motion, but it defends the bottom by this very
                    circumſtance.</p>
                <p>Such are the notions which Mr de Buat entertains of this part of the mechaniſm
                    of running waters. We cannot ſay that they are very ſatisfactory, and they are
                    very oppoſite to the opinions commonly entertained on the ſubject. Moſt perſons
                    think that the motion is moſt rapid and turbulent on ' the ſide of the concave
                    bank, and that it is owing to this that the bank is worn away till it become
                    perpendicular, and that the oppoſite bank is flat, becauſe it has not been
                    gnawed away in this manner. With reſpect to this general view of the matter,
                    theſe perſons may be in the right ; and when a ſtream is turned into a crooked
                    and yielding channel for the firſt time, this is its manner of action. But Mr
                    Buat’s aim is to inveſtigate the circumſtauces which obtain in the caſe of a
                    regimen ; and in this view he is undoubtedly right as to the facts, though his
                    mode of accounting for theſe facts may be erroneous. And as</p>
                <p>this is the only uſeful view to be taken of the ſubject, it ought chiefly to be
                    attended to in all our attempts to procure ſtability to the bed of a river,
                    without the ex-penlive helps of mafonry, &amp;c. If we attempt to ſecure
                    permanency by deepening on the inſide of the elbow, our bank will undoubtedly
                    crumble down, diminiſh the paſſage, and occaſion a more violent action on the
                    hollow bank. The moſt effectual mean of fecurity is to enlarge the ſection : and
                    if we do this on the inſide bank, we muſt do it by widening the ſtream very
                    much, that we may give a very Hoping bank. Our attention is commonly drawn to it
                    when the hollow bank is giving way, and with a view to ſtop the ravages of the
                    ſtream. Things are not now in a ſtate of permanency, but nature is working in
                    her own way to bring it about. <hi rend="sup">r</hi> Γhis may not fuit <hi
                        rend="italic"> our</hi> purpoſe, and we muſt thwart her. The phenomena
                    which we then obſerve are frequently very unlike to thoſe deſcribed in the
                    preceding paragraphs. We ſee a violent tumbling motion in the ſtream towaιds the
                    hollow bank. We ſee an evident accumulation of water on that ſide, and the point
                    B is frequently higher than C. This regorging of the water extends to ſome
                    diſtance, and is of itſelf a cauſe of greater velocity, and contributes, like a
                    head of ſtagnant water, to force the ſtream through the bend, and to deepen the
                    bottom. This is clearly the caſe when the velocity is exceſſive, and the hollow
                    bank able to abide the ſhock. In this ſituation the water thus heaped up eſcapes
                    where it beſt can ; and as the water, obſtructed by an obſtaele put in its way,
                    eſcapes by the ſides, and there has its velocity increaſed, ſo here the water
                    gorged up againſt the hollow bank ſwells over towards the oppoſite ſide, and
                    paſſes round the convex bank with an increaſed velocity. It depends much on the
                    adjuſtment between the velocity and conſequent accumulation, and the breadth of
                    the ſtream and the angle of the elbow, whether this augmentation of velocity
                    ſhall reach the convex bank ; and we ſometimes ſee the motion very languid in
                    that place, and even depoſitions of mud and land are made there. The whole
                    phenomena are too complicated to be accurately deſcribed in general terms, even
                    in the caſe of perfect regimen : for this regimen is relative to the conſiſtence
                    of the channel; and when this is very great, the motions may be moſt violent in
                    every quarter. But the preceding obſervations are of importance, becauſe they
                    relate to ordinary caſes and to ordinary channels.</p>
                <p>It is evident, from Mr Buat’s ſecond poſition,'that the proper form of an elbow
                    depends on the breadth of the ſtream as well as on the radius of curvature, and
                    that every angle of elbow will require a certain proportion between the width of
                    the river and the radius of the ſweep. Mr Buat gives rules and formulæ for all
                    theſe purpoſes, and ſhows that in one ſweep there may be more than one
                    reflection or rebound. It is needleſs to enlarge on this matter of mere
                    geometrical diſcuſſion. It is with the view of enabling the engineer to trace
                    the windings of a river in ſuch a manner that there ſhall be no rebounds which
                    ſhall direct the ſtream againſt the ſides, but preſerve it always in the axis of
                    every reach. This is of conſequence, even when the bends of the river are to be
                    ſecured by maſonry or piling ; for we have ſeen the neceſſity of increaſing the
                    ſection, and the tendency which the waters have to deepen the channel on that
                    ſide where the rebound is made. This tends</p>

                <p>to determine our defences, and obliges us to give them deeper and more solid
                    foundations in such places. But any perfora accuftoιned to the uſe of the ſeale
                    and com-paſſes will form to himſelf rules of practice equally ſure and more
                    expeditious than Mr de Buat’s formulæ.</p>
                <p>We proceed, therefore, to what is more to out purpoſe, the conſideration of the
                    reſiſtance cauſed by an elbow, and the methods of providing a force capable of
                    overcoming it, We have already taken notice of the ſalutary conſequences ariſihg
                    from the rambling courſe of rivers, inaſmuc'h as it more effectually ſpreads
                    them over the face of a country. It is no leſs beneficial by diminiſhing their
                    velocity. This it does both by lengthening their courſe, which dimim’ſhes the
                    declivity, and by the very reſiſtance which they meet with at every bend. We
                    derive the chief advantages from •our rivers, when they no longer ſhoot their
                    way from precipice to precipice, loaded with mud and fand, but peaceably roll
                    along their clear waters, purified during their gentler courſe, and offer
                    themſelves for all the purpoſes of paſturage, agriculture, and navigation. The
                    more a river winds its way round the foot of the hills, the more is the
                    reſiſtance of its bed multiplied ; the more obſtacles it meets with in its way
                    ſrom its ſource 'to the ſea, the more moderate is its velocity ; and in-ftead of
                    tearing up the very bowels of the earth, and «digging for itſelf a deep trough,
                    along which it ſweeps rocks and rooted-np trees, it flows with majeſtic pace
                    ’even with the ſurface of our cultivated grounds, which it embelliſhes and
                    fertilizes.</p>
                <p>We may with ſafety proceed on the ſirppoſition, that the force neceſſary for
                    overcoming the reſiſtance ariſiwg ſrom a rebound is as the ſquare of "the
                    velocity ; and it is reaſonable to ſuppoſe it proportional to the ſquare of the
                    fine of the angle of incidence, and this for the rea-fons given for adopting
                    this meaſure of the general <hi rend="italic"><hi rend="smallcaps"> Resistance of Fluids.</hi></hi> It cannot, however, claim a greater confidence here than in that
                    application ; and it has been ſhown in that article with what uncertainty and
                    limitations it muſt be received. We leave it to our readers to adopt either this
                    or the ſimple ratio of the fines, and ſhall abide by the duplicate ratio with Mr
                    Buat,becauſe fit appears by his experiments that this law is very exactly
                    obſerved in tubes in inclinations not 'exceeding 4.0 ' ; whereas it is in theſe
                    ſmall angles that the application to the general reſiſtance of fluids is moſt in
                    4ault. But the correction is very ſimple, if this value ſhall be found erroneous
                    There can be little doubt that the force neceſſary for overcoming the reſiſtance
                    will increaſe •as the number of rebounds.-—Therefore we may expreſs the</p>

                    having equal angles of incidence), and m is a number to be determined by
                    experiment. Mr de Buat made many experiments on the reſiſtance occaſioned by the
                    bendings of pipes, none of which differed from the reſult of the above formula
                    •above one part in twelve ; and he concludes, that the</p>

                    compared with a ſtraight pipe having the ſame velocity, and the difference of
                    tire heads of water was of an inch. A computation from theſe two experiments
                    will give the</p>

                <p>very nearly. It is probable that this meaſure of the reſiſtance is too great ;
                    for the pipe was of uniform diameter even in the bends : whereas in a river
                    properly formed, where the regimen is exact, the capacity of the ſectiiui of the
                    bend is increaſed.</p>
                <p>The application of this theory to inclined tubes and to open ſtreams is very
                    obvious, and very legitimate and ſafe. Let AB (fig. 17.) be the whole height of
                    the reſervoir A B I K, and B C the horizontal length of a pipe, containing any
                    number of rebounds, equal or unequal, but all regular, that is, conſtructed
                    according to the conditions formerly mentioned. The whole head of water ſhould
                    be conceived as performing, or as divided into portions which perform, three
                    different offices.—</p>
                <p>V <hi rend="sup">5</hi></p>
                <p>One portion, AD — ——, impels the water into thé</p>
                <p>505</p>
                <p>entry of the pipe with the velocity with which it really moves in it ; another
                    portion EB is in equilibrio with the reſiſtances ariſing from the mere length of
                    the pipé expanded into a ſtraight line ; and the third portion DE ſerves to
                    overcome the reſiſtance of the bends. If, therefore, we draw the horizontal line
                    B C, and, taking the pipe B C out of its place, put it in the poſition DH, with
                    its mouth C in Η, ſo that DH is equal to BC, the water will have the ſame
                    velocity in it that it had before. <hi rend="italic">N. B.</hi> For greater
                    ſimplicity of argument, we may ſuppoſe that when the pipe was inſerted at B, its
                    bends lay all in a horizontal plane, and that when it is inſerted at D, the
                    plane in which all its bends lie ſlopes only in the direction DH, and is
                    perpendicular to the plane of the figure. We repeat it, the water will have the
                    ſame velocity in the pipes B C and D H, and the reſiſtances will be overcome. If
                    we now prolong the pipe D H towards L to any diſtance, repeating continually the
                    ſame bendings in a ſeries of lengths, each equal to D H, the motion will be
                    continued with the velocity correſponding to the preſſure of the column AD ;
                    becauſe the declivity of the pipe is augmented in each length equal to DH, by a
                    quantity preciſely "ſufficient for overcoming all the reſiſtances ift that
                    length ; and the true ſlope in theſe caſes is B E-f-E D, divided by the expanded
                    length of the pipe B C or DH.</p>
                <p><hi rend="sup">,</hi> Jhe analogy which we were enabled to eſtabliſh between
                    the uniform motion or the train of pipes and of open ſtreams, intitles us now to
                    ſay, that when a river has bendings, which are regularly repeated at equal
                    intervals, its ſlope is compounded of the ſlope which is neceſſary for
                    overcoming the reſiſtance of a ſtraight channel of its whole expanded length,

                    overcoming the reſiſtance ariſing from its bendings alone.</p>
                <p>Thus, let there be a river which, in the expanded courſe of 6ooo fathoms, has io
                    elbows, each of which has 30 <hi rend="sup">0</hi> of rebound ; and let its
                    mean velocity be 20 inches in a ſecond. If we would learn its whole ſlope in
                    this 6000 fathoms, we muſt firſt find (by the formula of uniform motion) the
                    ſlope <hi rend="italic">s</hi> which will produce the velocity of 20 inches in
                    a ſtraight river of this length, ſection, and mean depth. Suppoſe this to be</p>

                <p>for overcoming the reſiſtance of 10 rebounds of 30 <hi rend="sup">β</hi> each.
                    This we ſhall find to be 6y inches in the 6oco fathoms. Therefore the river muſt
                    have a ſlope of 26y inches in 6000 fathoms, or <hi rend="sub">τ5</hi> iθ- <hi

                    changing the value ofv <hi rend="sup">z</hi> <hi rend="italic">s</hi> from 9 to 12,2 has changed the anſwer from 6,64 to

                    ſay 2,935 10,575 = 3,2: 0,62.8. Then, taking 0,628 from I 2,2, we have (for our

                    another, which will commonly be ſufficiently exact. We ſhall illuſtrate this by
                    an example.</p>
                <p>Let there be a river whoſe channel is a rectangle 150 feet wide and fix feet
                    deep, and which diſcharges 1500 cubic feet of water per ſecond, having a
                    velocity of 2σ inches, and ſlope of ττ⅜773-, or about √⅛∙ of an inch in 100
                    fathoms. How much will it riſe if it receives an addition which triples its
                    diſcharge ? and what will be its velocity ?</p>
                <p>If the velocity remained the ſame, its depth would be tripled ; but we know by
                    the general formula that its velocity will be greatly increaſed, and therefore
                    its depth will not be tripled. Suppoſe it to be doubled, and to become 12 feet.
                    This will give <hi rend="italic">d</hi> ≈ 10,34483, or 124,r38 inches; then
                    the equation , or <hi rend="italic">h=,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"/> in which
                    we have √B= r07,8, D = 45oo ; <hi rend="italic">Vd —</hi> o,l = 11,0417, will
                    give /&gt;=13,276; whereas it ſhould have been 12. This ſhows that our
                    calculated value of <hi rend="italic">d</hi> was too ſmall. Let us therefore
                    increaſe the depth by 0,9, or make it_i2,9, and repeat the calculation. This
                    will give us √ <hi rend="italic">d</hi> —0,1 = 11,3927, and <hi rend="italic">h=</hi> 12,867, inſtead of 13,276. Therefore augmenting our data 0,9
                    changes our anſwer 0,409. If we ſuppoſe theſe ſmall changes to retain their
                    proportions, we may conclude that if 12 be augmented by the quantity x×0,9, the
                    quantity 13,276 will diminiſh by the quantity x×0,409. Therefore, that the
                    eſtimated value of <hi rend="italic">h</hi> may agree with the one which
                    reſults from the calculation, we muſt have 12+x×0,9= 13,276—xXo,409. <hi
                        rend="sub"> rτl</hi> .</p>
                <p>This will give <hi rend="italic">x=</hi> , and χ×o,9~0,8773Î</p>
                <p>and A= 12,8773. If <hi rend="sup">we</hi> repeat the calculation with this
                    value of <hi rend="italic">l&gt;,</hi> we ſhall find no change.</p>
                <p>This value of <hi rend="italic">h</hi> gives &lt;/=131,8836 inches. If wc
                    now compute the new velocity by dividing the new diſcharge 4500 by the new area
                    150× 12,87 73, <hi rend="sup">we</hi> ſhall find it to be 27,95 inches, in
                    place of 20» the former velocity.</p>
                <p>We might have made a pretty exact firſt aſſumption, by recollecting what Was
                    formerly obſerved, that when the breadth is very great in proportion to the
                    depth, the mean depth differs irtſenſibly from the real depth, or rather follows
                    nearly the ſame proportions, and that the velocities are proportional to the
                    ſquare roots of the depths. Call the firſt diſcharge <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> the height <hi rend="italic">h,</hi> and velocity <hi rend="italic">v,</hi> and let D, H, and V, expieſs theſe</p>

                <p>remark alſo formerly made on this caſe, that the ſquares of the diſcharges are

                <p>And in making theſe firſt gueſſes we ſhall do it more exactly, by recollecting
                    that a certain variation of the mean depth J requires a greater variation of the
                    height, and the increment will be to the height nearly as half the height to the
                    width, as may eaſily be ſeen. There-</p>

                <p>viz. 0,52, we have 13 for our firſt aſſumption, exceeding the truth only an inch
                    and a half. We mention theſe circumſtances, that thoſe who are diſpoſed to apply
                    theſe doctrines to the ſolution of practical caſes may be at no loſs when one
                    occurs of which the regular ſolution requires an intricate analyſis.</p>
                <p>It is evident that the inverſe of the foregoing problems will ſhow the effects
                    of enlarging the ſection of a river, that is, will ſhow how much its ſurface
                    will be ſunk by any propoſed enlargement of its bed. It is therefore needleſs to
                    propoſe ſuch problems in this place. Common ſenſe directs us to make theſe
                    enlargements in thoſe parts of the river where their effect will be greateſt,
                    that is, where it is ſhalloweſt when its breadth greatly exceeds its depth, or
                    where it is narrowcſt (if its depth exceed the breadth, which is a very rare
                    caſe), or in general, where the ſlope is the lmallcſt for a ſhort run.</p>
                <p>The ſame general principles direct us in the method of embankments, for the
                    prevention of floods, by enabling us to aſeertain the heights neceſſary to be
                    given to our banks, This will evidently depend, not only on the additional
                    quantity of water which experience tells us a river br ings down during its
                    freſhes, but alſo on thediſtance at which we place the banks from the natural
                    banks of the river. This is a point where miſtaken economy frequently defeats
                    its own purpoſe. If we raiſe our embankment at ſome diſtance ſrom the natural
                    banks of the river, not only will a ſmaller height ſuf-ſice, and conſequently a
                    ſmaller baſe, which will make 3 ſaving in the duplicate proportion of the height
                    ; but our works will be ſo much the more durable nearly, if not exactly, in- the
                    ſame proportion. For by thus enlarging the additional bed which we give to the
                    ſwol-len river, we diminiſh its velocity almoſt in the ſame proportion that we
                    enlarge its channel, and thus diminiſh its power of ruining our works. Except,
                    therefore, in the caſe of a river whoſe freſhes are loaded with fine fand to,
                    deſtroy the turf, it is always proper to place the embankment at a conſiderable
                    diſtance from the natural banks. Placing them at half the breadth of the ſtream
                    from its natural banks, will nearly double its channel ; and, except in the caſe
                    now mentioned, the ſpace thus detached from our fields will afford excellent
                    paſture.</p>
                <p>The limits of ſuch a work as ours will not permit us to enter into any detail on
                    the methpd of embankment. It would require a volume to give inſtructions as to
                    the manner of founding, raiſing, and ſecuring the dykes which muſt be raiſed,
                    and a thoufand circumſtances which muſt be attended to. But a few general
                    obſervations may be made, which naturally occur while we are conſidering the
                    manner in which a river works in fettling or altering its channel.</p>
                <p>It muſt be remarked, in the firſt place, &lt;hat the river will riſe higher
                    when embanked than it does while it was allowed to ſpread ; and it is by no
                    means eaſy to conclude to what height it will riſe from the greateſt height to
                    which it has been obſerved to riſe in its floods. When at liberty to expand over
                    a wide valley ; then it could only riſe till it overflowed with a thickneſs or
                    depth of water ſufficient to produce a motion backwards into the valley quick
                    enough to take off the water as. faſt as it was 4upplied ; and we imagine that a
                    foot or two would ſuffice in moſt caſes. The beſt way for a prudent engineer
                    will be to obſerve the utmoſt riſe remembered by the neighbours in ſome gorge,
                    where the river cannot ſpread out. Meaſure the increaſed ſection in this place,
                    and at the ſame time recollect, that the water increaſes in a much greater
                    proportion than the ſection ; becauſe an increaſe of the hydraulic mean depth
                    produces an. increaſe of velocity in the duplicate proportion of the depth
                    nearly. But as this augmentation of velocity will obtain alſo Between the
                    embankments, it will be ſufficiently exact to ſuppoſe that the ſection muſt be
                    increaſed here nearly in the ſame proportion as at the gorge already mentioned.
                    Neglecting this method of information, and regulating the height of our
                    embankment by the greateſt ſwell that has been obſerved in the plain, will
                    aſſuredly make them too low, and render them totally uſeleſs.</p>
                <p>A line of embankment ſhould always be carried ou by a ſtrict concert of the
                    proprietors of both banks through its whole extent. A greedy proprietor, by
                    advancing his own embankment beyond that of his neighbours, not only expoſes
                    himſelf to rifle by the working of the waters on the angles which this will
                    produce, but expoſes his neighbours alſo to danger, by narrowing the ſection,
                    and thereby raiſing the ſurface and increaſing the velocity, and by turning the
                    ſtream athwart, and cauſing it to ſhoot againſt the oppoſite bank. The whole
                    ſhould be as much as poſſible in a line; and the general effect ſhould be to
                    make the courſe of the ſtream ſtraighter than it was before. All bends ſhould be
                    made more gentle, by keeping the embankment further from the river in all convex
                    lines of the natural bank, and bringing it nearer where the bank is concave.
                    This will greatly diminiſh the action of the waters on the bankment, and inſure
                    their duration. The ſame maxim muſt be followed in fencing any brook which
                    diſcharges itſelf into the river. The bends given at its mouth to the two lines
                    of embankment ſhould be made leſs acute than thoſe of the natural brook,
                    although, by this means, two points of land are left out. And the opportunity
                    ſhould be embraced of making the direction of this tranſverſe brook more Hoping
                    thao before, that is, leſs athwart the direction of the river.</p>
                <p>It is of great conſequence to cover the outfide of the dyke with very compact
                    turf cloſely united. If it admit water, the interior part of the wall, which is
                    always more porous, becomes drenched in water, and this water acts with its
                    ſtatical preſſure, tending to burſt the bank on the land-ſide, and will quickly
                    ſhift it from its ſeat. The utmoſt care ſhould therefore be taken to make it and
                    keep it perfectly tight. It ſhould be a continued fine turf, and every bare ſpot
                    ſhould be carefully covered with freſh fod ; and rat holes muſt be carefully
                    cloſed up.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Of ſtraighting or changing the courſe of rivers.</hi></p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">We have ſeen, that every bending of a river requires an
                        additional ſlope in order to continue its train, or enable it to convey the
                        ſame quantity of water without ſwelling in its bed. Therefore the effect of
                        taking away any</hi> of theſe bends muſt be to link the waters of the
                    river. It is proper, therefore, to have it in our power to eſtimate theſe
                    effects. It may be deſirable to gain property, by taking away the ſweeps of a
                    very winding ſtream. But this may be prejudicial, by deſtroying the navigation
                    on ſuch a river. It may alſo hurt the proprietors below, by increaſing the
                    velocity of the ſtream, which will expoſe them to the riſlc of its overflowing,
                    or of its deſtroying its bed, and taking a new courſe. Or this increaſe of
                    velocity may be inconſiſtent with the regimen of the new channel, or at leaſt
                    require larger dimenſions than we ſhould have given it if ignorant of this
                    effect.</p>
                <p>Our principles of uniform motion enable us to answer every queſtion of this kind
                    which can occur ; and Mr de Buat propυfes ſeveral problems to this effect. The
                    regular ſolutions of them are complicated and difficult; and we do not think
                    them neceſſary in this place, becauſe they may all be ſolved in a manner not
                    indeed ſo elegant, becauſe indirect, but abundantly accurate, and eaſy to any
                    perſon familiar with thoſe which we have already conſidered.</p>
                <p>We can take the exact level acroſs all theſe ſweeps, and thus obtain the whole
                    ſlope. We can meaſure with accuracy the velocity in ſome part of the channel
                    which is moſt remote from any bend, and where the channel itſelf has the
                    greateſt regularity of form. This will give us the expence or diſcharge of the
                    river, and the mean depth connected with it. We can then examine whether this
                    velocity is preciſely ſuch as is compatible with ſtability in the ſtraight
                    courſe. If it is, it is evident that if we cut off the bends, the greater ſlope
                    which this will produce will communicate to the waters a velocity incompatible
                    with the regimen ſuited to this ſoil, unleſs we enlarge the width of the ſtream,
                    thai&gt; is? unleſs we make the new channel more capacious than the old one.
                    We muſt now calculate the dimenſions of the channel which, with this increaſed
                    ſlope, will conduct the waters with the velocity that is neceſſary.. All
                    this∙may be done by the foregoing problems ; and we may eaſieſt. accompliſh this
                    by ſteps, Firſt, ſuppoſe the bed the. ſame with the old one, and calculate the
                    velocity for the increaſed ſlope by the general formula.. Then-change one of the
                    dimenſions of the channel, ſo as to produce the velocity we want, which is a
                    very ſimple proceſs. And in doing this, the object: to be kept, chiefly in view
                    is not to make the new velocity ſuch as will be incompatible with the ſtability
                    of tire new, bed.</p>
                <p>Having accompliſhed this firſt purpoſe, we learn (in. the very ſolution) how
                    much ſhallower this channel with its greater ſlope will be than the former,
                    while it diſcharges all the waters. This diminution of depth muſt increaſe the
                    ſlope and the velocity, and.muſt diminiſh the depth of the river, above the
                    place where the alteration is to be made. How far it produces theſe effects may
                    be calculated by the general formula. We then fee whether the navigation will be
                    hurt, either in the aid river up the ſtream, or in the new channel. It is</p>
                <p>plain that all theſe points -cannot be reconciled. We may make the new channel
                    ſuch, that it lhall leave a velocity compatible with ſtability, and that it
                    ſhall not diminiſh the depth of the river up the ſtream. But, having a greater
                    ſlope, it muſt have a ſmaller mean depth, and alſo a ſmaller real depth, unleſs
                    we make it of a very inconvenient form.</p>
                <p>The ſame things viewed in a different light, will ſhow us what depreſſion of
                    waters may be produced by rectifying the courſe of a river in order to prevent
                    its overflowing. And the proceſs which we would recommend is the ſame with the
                    foregoing. We apprehend it to be quite needleſs to meaſure the angles of
                    rebound, in order to <hi rend="italic">compute</hi> the ſlope which is <hi
                        rend="italic"> employed</hi> for ſend-ing the river through the bend, with
                    a view to ſuper-ſede this by ſtraighting the river. It is infinitely eaſier and
                    more exact to meaſure the levels themſelves, and' then we know the effect of
                    removing them.</p>
                <p>Nor need we follow Mr de Buat in ſolving problems' for diminiſhing the ſlope and
                    velocity, and deepening the channel of a river by bending its courſe. The
                    expence of this would be in every caſe enormous; and the practices which we are
                    juſt going to enter upon afford* infinitely eaſier methods of accompliſhing all

                    made in the ſide of a mill-caurſe, for letting the ſuperfluous water run off.

                    orifice in the ſide of a veſſel. In which caſe, the diſcharge Would be the ſame
                    as if the whole water were flowing with the velocity acquired from the height -~

The area of this orifice is <hi rend="italic">I h*</hi> Therefore the diſcharge would be <hi rend="italic">lh VqfiDſh,</hi> all being meaſured in inches. This is the uſual theory ; but it is not an
                    exact repreſentation of the manner in which the efflux really happens. The water
                    cannot remain at the height BF ; but in drawing towards the waſteboard from all
                    ſides, it forms a convex ſurface AlH, ſo that the point I, where the vertical
                    drawn from the edge of the waſteboard meets the curve, is conſiderably lower
                    than B. But as all the mafε above F is ſuppoſed perfectly fluid, the preſſure of
                    the incumbent water is propagated, in the opinion of Mr de Buat, to the filament
                    paſſing over at F without any diminution. The ſame may be ſaid of any filament
                    between F and I* Each tends, therefore, to move ill the ſame manner as if it
                    were really impelled through an orifice in Its place. Therefore the motions
                    through every part of the line or plane IF are the ſame as if the water were
                    eſcaping through an orifice IF, made by a ſluice let down on the water, and
                    keeping up the water of the reſervoir to the level AB. It is beyond a doubt
                    (ſays he) that</p>
                <p>the height IF muſt depend on the whole height BF, and that there muſt be a
                    certain determined proportion between them, tie does not attempt to determine
                    this proportion theoretically, but ſays, that his experiments aſeertain it with
                    great preciſion to be the proportion of one to two, or that IF is always
                    orte-half of BF. He ſays, however, that this determination was not by an
                    immediate and direct meaſetrement ; he concluded it from the compariſon of the
                    quantities of water dif-charged under different heights of the water in the
                    reſervoir.</p>
                <p>We -Cannot help thinking that this reaſoning is very defective in ſeveral
                    particulars. It cannot be inferred, from the laws of hydroſtatical preſſure,
                    that the filament at I is preſſed forward with all the weight of the column BI.
                    The particle I is really at the ſurface; and conſidering it as making part of
                    the ſurface of a running ſtream, it is ſubjected to hardly any preſſure, any
                    mote than the particles on the ſurface of a cup of water held in the hand, while
                    it is carried round the axis of the earth and round the ſun·. Reaſoning
                    according to his own principles, and availing himſelf of his own diſeovery, he
                    ſhould ſay, that the particle at I has an accelerating force depending on its
                    ſlope only $ and then he ſhould have endeavoured to aſeertain this ſlope. The
                    motion of the particle at I has no immediate connection with the preſſure of the
                    column BI 3 and if it had, the motion would be extremely different from what it
                    is : for this preſſure alone would give it the velocity which Mr Buat aſſigns
                    it. Now it is already paſſing through the point I with the velocity which it has
                    acquired in deſcending along the curve AI ; and this is the real ſtate of the
                    caſe. The particles are paſſing through with a velocity already acquired by a
                    hoping current} and they are accelerated</p>
                <p>by the hydroſtatical preſſure of the water above them. The internal mechaniſm of
                    theſe motions is infinitely more complex than Mr Buat here ſuppoſes; and on this
                    ſuppoſition, he very nearly abandons the theory which he has ſo ſhgeniouſly
                    eſtabliſhed, and adopts the theory of Gnglſelmini which he had exploded. At the
                    ſame time, we think that he is not much miſtaken when he aſſerts, that the
                    motions are nearly the ſame as if a ſluice had been let down from the ſurface to
                    I. For the filament which paſſes at I has been gliding down a cur» ved ſurface,
                    and has not been expoſed to any friction. It is perhaps the very caſe of
                    hydraulics, where the obſtructions are the ſmalleſt ; and we ſhould therefore
                    expect that its motion will be the leaſt retarded.</p>
                <p>We have therefore no heſitation in ſaying,that the filament at I is in the very
                    ſtate of motion which the theory would aſſign to it if it were paſſing under a
                    ſluice, as Mr Buat ſuppoſes. And with reſpect to the inferior filaments, without
                    attempting the very difficult talk of inveſtigating their motions, we ſhall juſt
                    ſay, that we do not ſee any reaſon for ſuppoſing that they will move flower than
                    our author ſuppoſes. Therefore, though we reject his theory, we admit his
                    experimental propo-fition in general ; that is, we admit that the <hi
                        rend="italic"> whole</hi> water which paſſes through the plane IF moves
                    with the velocity (though notin the ſame direction) with which it would have run
                    through a ſluice of the ſame depth ; and we may proceed with his determination
                    of the quantity of water diſeharged.</p>
                <p>If we make BC the axis of a parabola BEGH, the velocities of the filaments
                    palling at I and F will be repreſented by the ordinates IE and FG, and the
                    diſcharge by the area IEGF. This allows a very neat ſolution of the problem. Let
                    the quantity diſeharged per ſecond be D, and let the whole height BF be A Let 2
                    G be the quantity by which we muſt divide the ſquare of the mean velocity, in
                    order to have the producing height. This will be leſs than 2y, the acceleration
                    of gravity, on account of the convergency at the fides and the tendency to
                    convergence at the lip F. We formerly gave for its meaſure 726 inches, inſtead
                    of 772, and ſaid that the inches diſeharged per ſecond from an orifice of one
                    inch were 26,49, inſtead of 27,78. Let <hi rend="italic">x</hi> be the
                    diſtance of any filament from the horizontal line AB. An element of the orifice,

                <p>If we now put 26,49 or 26½ for , or the velocity with which a head of water of
                    one inch will impel the water over a weir, and multiply this by 0,431, we get
                    the following quantity 11,4172, or, in numbers of eaſy recollection, ιι⅜, for
                    the cubic inches of water per ſecond, which runs over every inch of a waſteboard
                    when the edge of it is one inch below the ſurface of the reſervoir ; and this

                    Thus let the edge of the waſteboard be four inches below the ſurface of the
                    water. The cube of this is 64, of which the ſquare root is eight. Therefore a
                    waſteboard of this depth under the ſurface, and three feet long, will diſcharge

                <p>The laſt column is the cubic inches diſeharged in a ſecond by each inch of the
                    waſteboatd. The correſpon-dence is undoubtedly very great. The greateſt error is
                    in the firſt, which may be attributed to a much ſmaller lateral contraction
                    under ſo ſmall a head of water.</p>
                <p>But it muſt be remarked, that the calculation proceeds on two ſuppoſitions. The
                    height FI is ſuppoſed 4 of BI ; arid 2 G is ſuppoſed 726. It is evident, that by
                    increaſing the ope and diminiſhing the other, nearly the ſame anſwers may be
                    produced, unleſs much greater variations of <hi rend="italic">h</hi> be
                    examined. Both of theſe quantities are matters of conſiderable uncertainty,
                    particularly the firſt ; and it muſt be farther remarked, that this was· cot
                    meaſured, but deduced from the uniformity of the experiments. We preſume that Mr
                    Buat tried various values of G, till he found one which gave the <hi
                        rend="italic"> ratios</hi> oſ diſcharge which he obſerved. We beg leave to
                    obſerve, that in a ſet of numerous experiments which we had ac-ceſs to examine,
                    BI was uniformly much leſs than 4 ; it was very nearly <hi rend="italic">i <hi
                            rend="sub"> r</hi> :</hi> and the quantity diſeharged was greater than
                    what would reſult ſrom Mr Buat’s calculation. It w as farther obſerved, that IF
                    depended very much on the form of the waſteboard. When it was a very thin board
                    of conſiderable depth, IF was very conſiderably greater than if the board was
                    thick, or narrow, and ſet on the top of a broad dam-head, as in fig. χ8. a <hi

                <p>It may be proper to give the formula a form which will correſpond to any ratio

                <p>It is hoped that this and ſome other fundamental facts in practical hydraulics
                    will ſoon be determined by accurate experiments. The Honourable Board for Fiſh</p>
                <p>erics and Improvements in Scotland have allotted a ſum of money for making the
                    neceſſary experiments, and the reſults will be publiſhed by their authority.
                    Meantime, this theory of Mr de Buat is of great value to the practical engineer,
                    who at preſent muſt content himſelf with a very vague conjecture, or take the
                    calculation of the erronneous theory of Guglielmini. By that theory, the board
                    of three ſeet, at the depth of four inches, ſhould diſcharge nearly 3 -⅛ cubic
                    feet per ſecond, which is almoſt double of what it really delivers.</p>
                <p>We preſume, therefore, that the following table will be acceptable to practical
                    engineers, who are not familiar with ſuch computations. It contains, in the
                    firſt column, the depth in Engliſh inches from the ſurface of the ſtagnant water
                    of a reſervoir to the edge of the waſteboarel. The ſecond column is the cubic
                    feet off water diſeharged in a minute by every inch of the waſte» board.</p>

                <p>If they be odd quarters of an inch, look in the table for as many inches as the
                    depth contains quarters, and take the eighth part of the anſwer. Thus, for 3⅛
                    inches, take the eighth part of 23,419, which correſponds to 15 inches. This is
                    2,927.</p>
                <p>If the waſteboard is not on the face of a dam, bat in a running ſtream, we muſt.
                    augment the diſcharge by multiplying the ſection by the velocity of the

                <p>We only beg leave to add, that the experiments which we mention as having been

                        given, it is required to determine how much the waters will be raiſed by a
                        weir of the whole breadth of the river, diſeharging the water with a clear
                        fall, that is, the ſurface of the water in the lewer channel being below the
                        edge of the weir ?</hi></p>
                <p>In this caſe we have 2 G = 746 nearly, becauſe there will be no contraction at
                    the ſides when the weir is the whole breadth of the river. But further, the
                    water is not now ſtagnant, but moving with the velocity</p>

                <p>Therefore let <hi rend="italic">a</hi> be the height of the weir from the

                <p>would be very troubleſome to ſolve this equation regularly, becauſe the unknown
                    quantity <hi rend="italic">b</hi> is found in the ſecond term of the anſwer.
                    But we know that the height producing the velocity above the weir is very ſmall
                    in compariſon of <hi rend="italic">h</hi> and of o, and, if only eſtimated
                    roughly, will make a very inſenſible change in the value of 7‘ ; and, by

                        > h</hi> to any degree of exact-•neſs.</p>
                <p>To illuſtrate this by an example. Suppoſe a river, the ſection of whoſe ſtream
                    is 150 feet, and that it diſe •charges 174 cubic ſeet of water in a ſecond ; how
                    much will the waters of this river be raiſed by a weir of the ſame width, and 3
                    feet high ?</p>
                <p>Suppoſe the width to be 50 feet. This will give 3 feet for the depth ; and we
                    fee that the water will have a clear fall, becauſe the lower ſtream will be the
                    ſame as before.</p>
                <p>The ſection being ιyo feet, and the diſcharge 174, the mean velocity is = 1,16
                    feet, — 14 inches</p>
                <p>nearly, which requires the height of fi of an inch very nearly. This may be
                    taken for the ſecond tenu of the</p>

                <p>√2G is, in the preſent caſe, = 27,313 ; <hi rend="italic">1</hi> is 600, and D
                    is. x74×1728, = 3e0672. Therefore £=12,192 — 0,2Ç, ≈ 11,942. Now correct this
                    value of £, by •correcting the ſecond term, which is ⅛ of an inch, in-</p>
                <p>D</p>
                <p>fteadof <hi rend="italic">ſ ~~~~~,-</hi> 77 V, or 0,141. This will give</p>

                <p>ss <hi rend="italic">b</hi> = 12,192—c,141, = 12,051, differing from the £rſt
                    value about-√ <hi rend="sub">j</hi> of an inch. It is needleſe to carry</p>
                <p>the approximation farther, T*uw we ſee that a weir, which dams up the whole of
                    the former* current of three feet deep, will onlv raiſe the waters of this river
                    one foot.</p>
                <p>The ſame rule ſerves for ſhowing how high we ought to raiſe this weir in order
                    to produce <hi rend="italic">any given rife</hi> of the waters, whether for
                    the purpoſes of navigation, or for taking off a draft to drive mills, or for any
                    other ſerviee ; for if the breadth of the river remain the ſame, the water will
                    ſtill flow over the weir with nearly the ſame depth. A very ſmall and hardly
                    perceptible difference will indeed ariſe from the diminution of Hope occaſioned
                    by this riſe, and a conſequent diminution of the velocity with which the river
                    approaches the weir. But this difference muſt always be a ſmall fraction of the
                    ſecond term of our anſwer; which term is itſelf very ſmall ; and eγen this will
                    be compenſated, in ſome degree, by the freer fall which the water will have over
                    the weir.</p>
                <p>If the intended weir is not to have the whole breadth of the river (which is
                    ſeldom neceſſary even for the purpoſes of navigation), the waters will be raiſed
                    higher by the ſame height of the waſteboard. The calcula, tion is preciſely the
                    ſame for this caſe. Only in the ſecond term, which gives the head of w <hi
                        rend="sup"> τ</hi> ater correſponding to the velocity of the river, ∕ muſt
                    ſtill be taken for the whole breadth of the river, while in the firſt term <hi
                        rend="italic"> I</hi> is the length of the waſteboard. Alſo ∖ZΓg muſt be a
                    little leſs, on account of the contractions at the ends of the weir, unleſs
                    theſe be avoided by giving the mar ſonry at the ends of the w <hi rend="sup">τ</hi> afteboard a curved ſhape on the upper ſide of the waſteboard. This ſhould
                    not be done when the ſole object of the weir is to raiſe the ſurface of the
                    waters. Its effect is but trifling at any rate, when the length of the
                    waſteboard is conſiderable, in proportion to the thickneſs of the ſheet of water
                    flowing over it.</p>
                <p>The following compariſon* of this rule with experiment will give our readers
                    ſome notion of its utility.</p>

                <p>cheap and certain conveyance of goods is there obtained by means of ſtreams
                    which we would think no better than boundary ditches, and unfit for every
                    purpoſe of this kind. By means of a bar the water is kept up a very few inches,
                    and the ſtream has free courſe to the ſea. The ſhoot over the bar is prevented
                    by means of another bar placed a little way below it, lying flat in the bottom
                    of the ditch, but which may be raiſed up on hinges. The lighterman makes his
                    boat faſt to a flake immediately above the bar, raiſes the lower bar, brings
                    over his boat, again makes it ſaſt, and, having laid down the other bar again,
                    proceeds on his journey. This contrivance anſwers the end of a lock at a very
                    trifling expence ; and though it does not admit of what we are accuſtomed to
                    call navigation, it gives a very ſure conveyance, which would otherwiſe be
                    impoſſible. When the waters can be raiſed by bars, ſo that they may be drawn off
                    for machinery or other purpoſes, they are preferable to weirs, becauſe they do
                    not obſtruct floating with rafts, and are not deſtroyed by the ice.</p>

                <p>This is by no means ſo eaſily ſolved as the diſcharge over a weir, and we cannot

                    obſervations will not be very far from a true account of the matter.</p>
                <p>We may firſt ſuppoſe a reſervoir LFBM (fig. 19.) of ſtagnant water, and that it
                    has a waſteboard of the height CB. We may then determine, by the foregoing
                    problems, the diſcharge through the plane E C. With reſpect to the diſcharge
                    through the part C A, it ſhould be equal to this product of the part of the
                    ſection by the velocity correſponding to the fall EC, which is the difference of
                    the heights of water above and below the bar ; for, becauſe the difference of E <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and C <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is equal to E C,
                    every particle <hi rend="italic">a</hi> of water in the plane CA is preſſed in
                    the direction of this ſtream with the ſame force, &lt;z√z. the weight of the
                    column E C. The ſum of theſe diſcharges ſhould be the whole diſcharge over the
                    bar ; but ſince the bar is ſet up acroſs a running river, its diſcharge muſt be
                    the ſame with that of the river. The water of the river, when ſt comes to the
                    place of the bar, has acquired ſome velocity by its ſlope or other cauſes, and
                    this correſponds to ſome height F E. This velocity, multiplied by the ſection of
                    the river, having the height E B, ſhould give a diſcharge equal to the diſeharge
                    over the bar.</p>
                <p>To avoid this complication of conditions, we may firſt compute the diſcharge of
                    the bar in the manner now pointed out, without the conſideration of the previous
                    velocity of the ſtream. This diſcharge will be a little too ſmall. If we divide
                    it by the ſection F B, it will give a primary velocity too ſmall, but not far
                    from the truth. Therefore we ſhall get the height F E, by means of which we
                    ſhall be able to determine a velocity intermediate between D G and C H, which
                    would correſpond to a weir, as alſo the velocity C H, which correſponds to the
                    part of the ſection C A, which is wholly under water. Then we correct all theſe
                    quantities by repeating the operation with them inſtead of our firſt
                    aſſumptions.</p>
                <p>Mr Buat found this computation extremely near the</p>
                <p>truth, but in all caſes a little greater than obſervation exhibited.</p>
                <p>We may now ſolve the problem in the moſt general terms.</p>

                <p>The ſlope and dimenſions of the channel being given, our formula will give us
                    the velocity and the quantity of water diſeharged. Then, by the preceding

                    two heights deduct the ordinary depth of the river. The remainder is the riſe of
                    the waters. For example :</p>
                <p>Let there be a river whoſe ordinary depth is 3 feet, arid breadth 40, and whoſe
                    ſlope is ι∣ inches in 100 fathoms, or ∙j-g⅛o∙ Suppoſe a weir on this river 6
                    feet high and 1 8 feet wide.</p>
                <p>We muſt firſt find the velocity and diſcharge of the river in its natural ſtate,

                <p>V = 23,45, and D = 405216 cubic inches.</p>
                <p>The contraction obtains here on the three ſides of the orifice. We may therefore

                <p>Add this to the height of the weir, and the depth of the river above the ſluice
                    is 102,182, = 8 feet and 6,τ82 inches. From this take 3 ſeet, and there remai , <hi rend="sub">+</hi> 5 feet and 6,182 inches for the riſe of the waters.</p>
                <p>There is, however, an important circumſtance in this riſe of the waters, which
                    muſt be diſtinctly underſtood before we can ſay what are the intereſting effects
                    of this weir. This ſwell extends, as we all know, to a conſiderable diſtance up
                    the ſtream, but is leſs fenſible as we go away from the weir. What is the
                    diſtance to which the ſwell extends, and what increaſe does it produce in the
                    depth at different diſtances from the weir ?</p>
                <p>If we ſuppoſe that the ſlope and the breadth of the channel remain as before, it
                    is plain, that as we come down the ſtream from that point where the ſwell is
                    inſenſible, the depth of the channel increaſes all the way to the dam.
                    Therefore, as the ſame quantity of water paſſes through every ſection of the
                    river, the velocity muſt diminiſh in the ſame proportion (very nearly) that the
                    ſection increaſes. But this being an open ſtream, and therefore the velocity
                    being iuſeparably connected with the ſlope of the ſurface, it follows, that the
                    ſlope of the ſurface muſt diminiſh ail the way from that point where the ſwell
                    of the water is inſenſible to the dam. The ſurface, therefore, cannot be a
                    ſimple inclined plane, but muſt be concave upwards, as repreſented in ſig. 20.
                    where FKLB repreſents the channel of a river, and FB the ſurface of the water
                    running in it. If this be kept up to A by a weir AL, the ſurface will be a curve
                    FIA, touching the natural ſurface F at the beginning of the ſwell, and the line
                    AD which touches it in A will have the ſlope S correſponding to the velocity
                    which the waters have immediately before going over the weir. We know this
                    ſlope, becauſe we</p>

                <p>are ſuppoſed to know the diſcharge of the river and its ſlope and other
                    circumſtances before barring it with a dam ; and we know the height of the dam
                    Η, and therefore the new velocity at A, or immediately above A, and conſequently
                    the ſlope S. Therefore, drawing the horizontal lines DC, AG, it is plain that CB
                    and CA will be the primary ſlope of the river, and the ſlope S correſponding to
                    the velocity in the immediate neighbourhood of A, becauſe theſe verticals have
                    the ſame horizontal diſtance DC. We have therefore CB : CA <hi rend="italic">=
                        S : s very</hi> nearly, and S— <hi rend="italic">s : s—</hi> CB—CA : CA,</p>

                <p>=AB (nearly) : CA. Therefore CA = g—y &gt;== -Q——. But DA≈CA×S, by our
                    definition of</p>
                <p>O — <hi rend="italic">S</hi></p>
                <p><hi rend="sub">λ</hi> H.S.χ ſlope; therefore D A=~g—y~</p>
                <p>This is all that we can ſay with preciſion of this curve. Mr Buat examined what
                    would reſult from ſuppoſing it an arch of a circle. In this caſe we ſhould "have
                    DA=DF, and AF very nearly equal to 2 AD : and as we can thus find AD, we get the
                    whole length FIA of the ſwell, and alſo the diſtances of any part of the curve
                    from the primitive ſurface FB of the river ; for theſe will be very nearly in
                    the duplicate proportion of their diſtances from F. Thus ID will be 4 of AB,
                    &amp;c. Therefore we ſhould obtain the depth I <hi rend="italic">cl</hi> of the ſtream in that place. Getting the depth of the ſtream, and knowing the
                    diſcharge, we get the velocity, and can compare this with the Hope of the
                    ſurface at 1. This ſhould be the ſlope of that part of the arch of the circle.
                    Making this compariſon, he found theſe circumſtances to be incompatible. He
                    found that the fec-* ion and ſwell at I, correſponding to an arch of a circle,
                    gave a diſcharge nearly fith too great (they were as 405216 to 492142).
                    Therefore the curve is ſuch, that AD is greater than DF, and that it is more
                    incur-vated at F than at A. He found, that making DA to DF as 10 to 9, and the
                    curve FIA an arch oſ an ellipſe whoſe longer axis was vertical, would give a
                    very nice correſpondence of the ſections, velocities, and ſlopes. The whole
                    extent of the ſwell therefore can never be double of AD, and muſt always greatly
                    ſur-paſs AD ; and theſe limits will do very well for every practical queſtion.
                    Therefore making DF <hi rend="sub">τ</hi> ⅜ of AD, and drawing the chord AD,
                    and making DI fi- of D r, we ſhall be very near the truth. Then we get the ſwell
                    with ſufficient preciſion for any point H between F and D, by making FD <hi
                        rend="sup"> 2</hi> : FH <hi rend="sup">i</hi> — ID : H <hi rend="italic">h ;</hi> and if H is between D and A, we get its diſtance from the tangent
                    DA by a ſimilar proceſs.</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">We ſhall conclude this article with ſome obſervations on
                        the methods which may be taken for rendering ſmall</hi> <hi rend="sup">ς</hi> rivers and brooks fit for inland navigation, or at leaſt
                    for floatage. We get much inſtruction on this ſubject from what has been ſaid
                    concerning the ſwell produced in a river by weirs, bars, or any diminution of
                    its former ſection. Our knowledge of the form which the ſurface of this ſwell
                    affects, will furniſh rules for ſpacing theſe obſtructions in ſuch a manner, and
                    at ſuch diſtances from each other, that the ſwell produced by one ſhall extend
                    to the one above it.</p>
                <p>If we know the ſlope, the breadth, and the depth of a river, in the droughts of
                    ſummer, and have determined on the height of the flood-gates, or keeps, which
                    are to be ſet up in its bed, it is evident that their ſtations are not matters
                    of arbitrary choice, if we would derive the greateſt poſſible advantage from
                    them.</p>
                <p>Some rivers in Flanders and Italy are made navigable in ſome ſort by ſimple
                    ſluices, which, being ſhut, form magazines of water, which, being diſeharged by
                    opening the gates, raiſes the inferior reach enough to permit the paſſage of the
                    craft which are kept on it. After this momentary riſe the keeps are ſhut again,
                    the water finks in the lower reach, and the lighters which were floated through
                    the ſhallows are now obliged to draw into thoſe parts of the reach where they
                    can lie afloat till the next ſupply of water from above enables them to proceed.
                    This is a very rude and imperfect method, and unjuſtifiable at this day, when we
                    know the effect of locks, or at leaſt of double gates. We do not mean to enter
                    on the conſideration of theſe contrivances, and to give the methods of their
                    conſtruction, in this place, but refer our readers to what has been already ſaid
                    on this ſubject in the articles Canal, Lock, Navigation <hi rend="italic">(Inland),</hi> and to what will be ſaid in the article <hi rend="italic">lVH <hi rend="sup">c</hi> r ER-Works.</hi> At preſent we confine
                    ourſelves to the Angle point of huſhanding the different falls in the bed of the
                    river, in ſuch a manner that there may be everywhere a ſufficient depth of water
                    : and, in what we have to deliver on the ſubject, we ſhall take the form of an
                    example to illuſtrate the application of the foregoing rules.</p>
                <p>Suppoſe then a river 40 feet wide and 3 feet deep in the droughts of ſummer,
                    with a ſlope of 1 in 4800. T his, by the formula of uniform motion, will have a
                    velocity V — 23⅜ inches per ſecond, and its diſeharge will be 405216 cubic
                    inches, or 234⅛ feet. It is propoſed to give this river a depth not leſs than
                    five feet in any place, by means of flood-gates of fix feet high and x8 feet
                    wide.</p>
                <p>We firſt compute the height at which this body of 2344 cubic feet of water will
                    diſcharge itſelf over the flood-gates. This we ſhall find by Prob. II. to be 30i
                    inches, to which adding 72, the height of the gate, we have IO2⅛ for the whole
                    height of the water above the floor of the gate ; the primitive depth of the
                    river being 3 feet, the riſe or ſwell 5 feet 6)- inches. In the next place, we
                    find the range or ſenſible extent of this ſwell by Prob. I. and the obſervations
                    which accompany it. This will be found tobe nearly 9177 fathoms. Now ſince the
                    primitive depth of the river is three feet, there is only wanted two ſeet of
                    addition ; and the queſtion is reduced to the finding what point of the curved
                    ſurface of the ſwell is two feet above the tangent plane at the head of the
                    ſwell ? or how far this point is from the gate ? The whole extent being 9177
                    fathoms, and the deviations from the tangent plane being nearly in the duplicate
                    ratio of the diſtances from the point of contact, we may inſtitute this
                    proportion 66⅜ : 24 = 9177 <hi rend="sup">,</hi> : 5526 <hi rend="sup">2</hi> . The laſt term is the diſtance (from the head of the ſwell) of that part
                    of the ſurface which is two feet above the primitive ſurface of the river.
                    Therefore 9177—5526, or 3651 fathoms, is the diſtance of this part from the
                    flood-gate ; and this is the diſtance at which the gates ſhould be placed, from
                    each other. No inconvenience would ariſe from having them nearer, if the banks
                    be high enough to contain the waters ; but if they are farther diltant, the
                    required depth of water cannot be had without increaſing the height of the gates
                    ; but if reaſons of conve-niency ſhould induce us to place them nearer, the ſame
                    depth may be ſecured by lower gates, and no additional height will be required
                    for the banks. This is generally a matter of moment, becauſe the raifing the
                    water brings along with it the chance of flooding the adjoining fields. Knowing
                    the place where the ſwell ceaſes to be ſenſible, we can keep the top of the
                    intermediate flood-gate at the precife height of the curved ſurface of the ſwell
                    by means of the proportionality of the deviations from the tangent to the
                    diſtances from the point of contact.</p>
                <p>But this rule will not do for a gate which is at a greater diſtance from the one
                    above it than the 3651 fathoms already mentioned. We know that a higher gate is
                    required, producing a more extenſive ſwell ; and the one ſwell does not coincide
                    with the other, although they may both begin from the ſame point A (ſig. 21.(
                    Nor will the curves even be ſimilar, unleſs the thickneſs of the ſheet of water
                    flowing over the gate be increaſed in the ſame ratio. But this is not the caſe ;
                    becauſe the produce of the river, and therefore the thickneſs of the ſheet of
                    water, is conſtant.</p>
                <p>But we may ſuppoſe them ſimilar without erring more than two or three decimals
                    of an inch ; and then we ſhall have AF : AL =y^F : DL ; from which, if we take
                    the thickneſs of the ſheet of water already calculated for the other gates,
                    there will remain the height of the gate BL.</p>
                <p>By following theſe methods, inſtead of proceeding by random gueſſes, we ſhall
                    procure the greateſt depth of water at the ſmalleſt expence poſſible.</p>
                <p>But there is a circumſtance which muſt be attended to, and which, if neglected,
                    may in a ſhort time render all our works uſeleſs. Theſe gates muſt frequently be
                    open in the time of freſhes ; and as this channel then has its natural Hope
                    increaſed in every reach by the great contraction of the ſection in the gates,
                    and alſo rolls along a greater body of water, the action of the ſtream on its
                    bed muſt be increaſed by the augmentation of velocity which theſe circumſtances
                    will produce:</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0300" facs="gri_33125011196389_0306.tif"/>
                <p>and although we may ſay that the general ſlope is ne-ceiſarily ſecured by the
                    cills of the flood-gates, which are paved with ſtone or covered with planks, yet
                    this will not hinder this increaſed current from digging up the bottom in the
                    intervals, undermining the banks, and lodging the mud and earth thus carried off
                    in places where the current meets with any check. All theſe conſequences will
                    aſſuredly follow il the increaſed velocity is greater than what correſponds to
                    the regimen relative to the ſoil in which the river holds on its courſe.</p>
                <p>In order therefore to procure durability to works oſ this kind, which are
                    generally of enormous expence, the local circumſtances muſt be moſt ſcrupulouſly
                    ſtu-died. It is not the ordinary hurried ſurvey of an engineer that will free us
                    from the riſk of our navigation becoming very troubleſome by the riſe of the
                    waters being diminiſhed from their former quantity, and banks formed at a ſmall
                    diſtance below every ſluice. We muſt attentively ſtudy the nature of the ſoil,
                    and diſcover experimentally the velocity which is not inconſiſtent with the
                    permanency of the channel. If this be not a great deal leſs than that of the
                    river when accelerated by freſhes, the regimen may be preſerved after the
                    eſta-bliſhment of the gate, and no great changes in the channel will be
                    neceſſary : but if, on the other hand, the natural velocity of the river during
                    its freſhes greatly exceeds what is conſiſtent with ſtability, we muſt enlarge
                    the width of the channel, that we may diminiſh the hydraulic mean depth, and
                    along with this the velocity. Therefore, knowing the quantity diſeharged during
                    the freſhes, divide it by the velocity of regimen, or rather by a velocity
                    ſomewhat greater (for a reaſon which will appear by and by), the quotient will
                    be the area of a new ſection. Then taking the natural ſlope of the river for the
                    ſlope which it will preſerve in this enlarged channel, and after the cills of
                    the flood-gates have been fixed, we muſt calculate the hydraulic mean depth, and
                    then the other dimenſions of the channel. And, laſtly, from the known dimenſions
                    of the channel and the diſeharge (which we muſt now compute), we proceed to
                    calculate the height and the diſtances of the flood-gates, adjuſted to their
                    widths, which muſt be regulated by the room which may be thought proper for the
                    free paſſage of the lighters which are to ply on the river. An example will
                    illuſtrate the whole of this proceſs.</p>
                <p>Suppoſe then a ſmall river having a ſlope of 2 inches in 100 fathoms or <hi
                        rend="sub"> τ7</hi> <hi rend="sup">,</hi> <hi rend="sub">5</hi> - <hi rend="sub">δ</hi> jwhich is a very uſual
                    declivity of ſuch ſmall ſtreams, and whoſe depth in lummer is 2 feet, but
                    ſubject to floods which raiſe it to nine feet. Let its breadth at the bottom be
                    18 feet, and the baſe qf its ſlanting ſides 4 of their height. All of theſe
                    dimenſions are very conformable to the ordinary courſe of things. It is propoſed
                    to make this river navigable in all ſeaſons by means of keeps and gates placed
                    at proper diſtances ; and we want to know the dimenſions of a <hi rend="sub">j</hi> channel which will be permanent, in a ſoil which begins to yield to a
                    velocity of 80 inches per ſecond, but will be ſafe under a velocity of 24.</p>
                <p>The primitive channel having the properties of a rectangular channel, its
                    breadth during the freſhes muſt be B = 30 ſeet, or 360 inches, and its depth <hi

                <p>fore, during the freſhes, will be 38,9447 inches, and its diſcharge 15j4169
                    cubic inches, or 876⅛∙ cubic feet per ſecond. We ſee therefore that the natural
                    channel will not be permanent, and will be very quickly deſtroyed or changed by
                    this great velocity. We have two methods for procuring ſtability, viz.
                    diminiſhing the ſlope, or widening the bed. The firſt method will require the
                    courſe to be lengthened in the proportion of 24’ to 3988 <hi rend="sup">i</hi> , or nearly of 36 to 100. —The expence of this would be enormous. The ſecond
                    method will require the hydraulic mean depth to be increaſed nearly in the ſame
                    proportion (becauſe the velocities are</p>

                <p>We muſt now obſerve, that the great velocity, of which we are afraid, obtains
                    only during the winter floods. If therefore we reduce this to 24 inches, it muſt
                    happen that the autumnal freſhes, loaded with fand and mud, will certainly
                    depoſit a part of it, and choak up bur channel below the flood-gates. We muſt
                    therefore ſelect a mean velocity ſomewhat exceeding the regimen, that it may
                    carry off theſe depoſitions. We ſhall take 27 inches, which will produce this
                    effect on the looſe mud without endangering our channel in any remarkable
                    degree.</p>
                <p>Therefore we have, by the theorem for uniform mo.</p>

                    the hydraulic mean depth, we find the area 8 of the ſection by dividing the
                    diſcharge 1514169 by the velocity 27. This gives us 56080,368. Then we get the
                    breadth B by the formula formerly given,</p>

                <p>150,19 feet, and the depth <hi rend="italic">h</hi> = 31,115 inches.</p>
                <p>With theſe dimenſions of the ſection we are certain that the channel will be
                    permanent ; and the cills of the flood-gates being all fixed agreeable to the
                    primitive ſlope, we need not fear that it will be changed in the intervals by
                    the action of the current. The gates being all open during the freſhes, the
                    bottom will be cleared of all depoſited mud.</p>
                <p>We muſt now ſtation the flood-gates along the new channel, at ſuch diſtances
                    that we may have the depth of water which is proper for the lighters that are to
                    be employed in the navigation. Suppoſe this to be four feet. We muſt firſt of
                    all learn how high the water will be kept in this new channel during the ſummer
                    droughts. There remained in the primitive channel only 2 feet, and the ſection
                    in this caſe had 20 feet 8 inches mean width ; and the diſcharge correſponding

                <p>find the depth of water in the new channel correſponding to this diſcharge, and
                    the ſame ſlope, we muſt take the method of approximation formerly exemplified,
                    remembering that the diſcharge D is 130849, and the breadth B is 1760,8 at the
                    bottom (the fiant ſides being y). Theſe data will produce a depth of water — 64-
                    inches. To obtain four feet therefore behind any of the flood-gates, we muſt
                    have a ſwell of 41¾ inches produced by the gate below.</p>
                <p>We muſt now determine the width of paſſage which muſt be given at the gates.
                    This will regulate the thickneſs of the ſheet of water which flows over them
                    when ſhut ; and this, with the height of the gate, fixes the ſwell at the gate.
                    The extent of this ſwell, and the elevation of every point of its curved ſurface
                    above the new ſurface of the river, requires a combination oſ the height of
                    ſwell at the flood-gate, with the primitive Hope and the new velocity. Theſe
                    being computed, the ſtations of the gates may be aſſigned, which will ſecure
                    four feet of water behind each in ſummer. We need not give theſe computations,
                    having already exemplified them all with relation to another river.</p>
                <p>This example not only illuſtrates the method of proceeding, ſo as to be enſured
                    of ſucceſs, but alſo gives us a preciſe inſtance of what muſt be done in a caſe
                    which cannot but frequently occur. We ſee what a prodigious excavation is
                    neceſſary, in order to obtain permanency. We have been obliged to enlarge the
                    primitive bed to about thrice its former ſize, ſo that the excavation is at
                    leaſt two·thirds of what the other method required. The expence, however, will
                    ſtill be vaſtly inferior to the other, both from the nature of the work and the
                    quantity of ground occupied. At all events, the expence is enormous, and what
                    could never be repaid by the navigation, except in a very rich and populous
                    country.</p>
                <p>There is another circumſtance to be attended to.— The navigation of this river
                    by ſluices muſt be very de-ſultory, unleſs they are extremely numerous, and of
                    ſmall heights. The natural ſurface of the ſwell being Concave upwards, the
                    additions made by its different parts to the primitive height of the river
                    decreaſe rapidly as they approach to the place A (fig. 2θ), where the ſwell
                    terminates; and three gates, each oſ which raiſes the water one foot when placed
                    at the proper diſtance from each other, will raiſe the water much more than two
                    gates at twice this diſtance, each raifing the water two ſeet. Moreover, when
                    the elevation produced by a flood-gate is conſiderable, exceeding a very few
                    inches, the fall and current produced by the opening of the gate is ſuch, that
                    no boat can poſſibly paſs up the river, and it runs imminent riſlc of being
                    overſet and funk, in the attempt to go down the ſtream. This renders the
                    navigation deſultory. A number of lighters collect themſelves at the gates, and
                    wait their opening. They paſs through as ſoon as the current becomes moderate.
                    This would not, perhaps, be very hurtful in a regulated navigation, if they
                    could then proceed on their voyage. But the boats bound up the river muſt ſtay
                    on the upper ſide of the gate which they have juſt now paſſed, becauſe the
                    channel is now too ſhallow for them to proceed. Thoſe bound down the river can
                    only go to the next gate, unleſs it has been opened- at a time nicely adjuſted
                    to the opening of the one above it. The paſſage</p>
                <p>downwards <hi rend="italic">may <hi rend="sub">i</hi></hi> in many caſes, be continued, by very intelligent and attentive lockmen,
                    but the paſſage up <hi rend="italic">mu/l</hi> be exceedingly tedious. Nay, we
                    may ſay, that <hi rend="italic">nυlfιle</hi> the paſſage downwards is
                    continuous, it is but in a very few caſes that the paſſage upward is
                    practicable. If we add to theſe inconveniences the great danger of paſſage
                    during the freſhes, while all the gates are open, and the immenſe and
                    unavoidable accumulations of ice, on occaſion even of flight froſts, we may ſee
                    that this method of procuring an inland navigation is amazingly expenſive,
                    deſultory, tedious, and hazardous. It did not therefore merit, on its own
                    account, the attention we have beſtowed on it. But the diſcuſſion was
                    abfo-lutely neceſſary, in order to ſhow what muſt be done in order to obtain
                    effect and permanency, and thus to prevent us from engaging in a project which,
                    to a perſon not duly and confidently informed, is ſo feaſible and promiſing.
                    Many profeſſional engineers are ready, and with honeſt intentions, to undertake
                    ſuch taſks ; and by avoiding this immenſe ex pence, and contenting themſelves
                    with a much narrower channel, they ſucceed, (witneſs the old navigation of the
                    river Merſey). But the work has no duration ; and, not having been found very
                    ſerviceable, its ceſſation is not matter of much regret. The work is not much
                    ſpoken of during its continuance. It is ſoon forgotten, as well as its failure,
                    and engineers are found ready to engage for ſuch another.</p>
                <p>It was not a very refined thought to change this imperfect mode for another free
                    ſrom moſt of its inconveniences. A boat was brought up the river, through one of
                    theſe gates, only by raiſing the waters of the inferior reach, and depreſſing
                    thoſe of the upper : and it could not eſcape obſervation, that when the gates
                    were far aſunder, a vaſt body of water muſt be diſeharged before this could be
                    done, and that it would be a great improvement to double each gate, with a very
                    ſmall diſtance between. Thus a very ſmall quantity of water woιdd fill the
                    interval to the deſired height, and allow the boat to come through ; and this
                    thought was the more obvious, from a ſimilar practice having preceded it, ∙υ∕z.
                    that of navigating a ſmall river by means of double bars, the loweſt of which
                    lay flat' in the bottom of the river, but could be raiſed up on hinges. We have
                    mentioned this already ; and it appears to have been an old practice, being
                    mentioned by Stevinus in his valuable work on ſluices, publiſhed about the
                    beginning of the laſt century ; yet no trace of this method is to be found of
                    much older dates. It .occurred, however, accidentally, pretty often in the flat
                    countries of Holland and Flanders, which being the ſeat of frequent wars, almoſt
                    every town and village was- fortified with wet ditches, connected with the
                    adjoining rivers. Stevinus mention particularly the works of Condé,', as. having
                    been long employed, with great ingenuity, for rendering navigable a very long
                    ſtretch of the Scheldt. The boats were received into the lower part of the
                    foffee, which was ſeparated from the reſt by a ſtone batardeau, ſerving to keep
                    up the waters in thereſt of the foſſee about eight ſeet. In this was a ſluice
                    and another dam, by which the boats could be taken into the upper foſſee, which
                    communicated with a remote part of the Scheldt by a long canal. This appears to.
                    be one of the earlieſt locks.</p>
                <p>In the firſt attempt to introduce this improvement in</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0302" facs="gri_33125011196389_0308.tif"/>
                <p>the navigation of rivers already kept up by weirs, which gave a partial and
                    interrupted navigation, it was uſual to avoid the great expence of the ſecond
                    dam and gate, by making the lock altogether detached from the river, within
                    land, and having its baſon parallel to the river, and communicating by one end
                    with the river above the weir, and by the other end with the river below the
                    weir, and having a flood-gate at each end.— This was a moſt ingenious thought ;
                    and it was a prodigious improvement, free from all the inconveniences of
                    currents, ice, &amp;c. &amp;c. It was called a <hi rend="italic">Schluſſel,</hi> or lock, with conſiderable propriety ; and this was the
                    origin of the word <hi rend="italic">flume,</hi> and of our application of its
                    tranſlation <hi rend="italic">lock.</hi> This practice being once introduced,
                    it was not long before engineers found that a complete ſeparation of the
                    navigation ſrom the bed of the river was not only the moſt perfect method for
                    obtaining a ſure, eaſy, and uninterrupted navigation, but that it was in general
                    the moſt ceconomical in its firſt conſtruction, and ſubject to no rifle of
                    deterioration by the action of the current, which was here entirely removed.
                    Locked canals, therefore, have almoſt entirely ſupplant-ed all attempts to
                    improve the natural beds of rivers ; and this is hardly ever attempted except in
                    the flat countries, where they can hardly he ſaid to differ from horizontal
                    canals. We therefore cloſe with theſe obſervations this article, and reſerve

                    worthy of his notice, by making it practically uſeful. We have on every occaſion
                    appealed, from all theoretical deductions, however ſpecious and well ſupported,
                    to fact and obſervation of thoſe ſpontaneous phenomena of nature which are
                    continually paſſing in review before us in the motion of running waters. Reſting
                    in this manner our whole doctrines on experiment, on the obſervation of what
                    really happens, and what happens in a way which we cannot or do not fully
                    explain, theſe ſpontaneous operations of nature came inſenſibly to acquire a
                    particular value in our imagination. It has alſo happened in the courſe of our
                    reflections on theſe ſub-jects, that theſe phenomena have frequently preſented
                    themſelves to our view in groups, not leſs remarkable for the extent and the
                    importance of their conſequences than for the ſimplicity, and frequently the
                    ſeeming in-ſignificancy, nay frivolity, of the means employed. Our fancy has
                    therefore been ſometimes warmed with the view of a ſomething ; an</p>

                    long been the object of cool contemplation in the cloſet of the philoſopher, and

                    But ſhe has now become the ob</p>
                <p>ject of a fincere 3nd fond idolatry, being held forth by her zealous
                    high-prieſts to the reſined vanity of man as a ſort of mirror, in which he may
                    behold his own che-riſhed features, and admire a beauty of his own com-poſition,
                    painted with the moſt delicate glow of humanity, and decked out with every
                    ornament with which the courtly fancies of a Voltaire, a Diderot, a Mirabeau,
                    could contrive, to ſmooth over or to hide all traçes of created imperfection. We
                    leave this idol to the worſhip of her intoxicated and unfortunate votaries. The
                    ſolemn farce in the church of Notre Dame at Paris was an adoration every way

                    character of the meaneſt pedlar. No one will think that we expreſs ourſelves too
                    ſtrongly who reflects on the many inſamous tricks played by Voltaire to his
                    bookſellers. No one will think the charge too harſh, when he learns that
                    Diderot, after having pretended to the poſſeſſion of an immenſe library, and
                    ſold it to the empreſs of Ruſſia for an enormous ſum, had to ranſack the
                    warehouſes of the bookſellers of Paris and throughout all Germany, in order to
                    fill his ſhelves. As for Mirabeau, he ſurpaſſes eulogy.</p>
                <p>Moſt aſſiduous were thoſe apoſtles in ſpreading this fanaticiſm, of which they
                    enjoyed the courtly profits : and we imagine that the employment was as
                    agreeable as it was lucrative ; for we cannot ſuppoſe that Le Kain had more
                    enjoyment, when faſci-nating his Pariſian audience in the character of
                    Voltaire’s Mahomet, than its author felt in the ſide-box, when grinning to
                    himſelf, and conſcious what a fordid and envious wretch he was, he found himſelf
                    crowned by the firſt actreſs, and worſhipped by the audience as the apoſtle of
                    philanthropy and univerſal benevolence.</p>
                <p>Such was the worſhip, ſſuch were the prieſts, of this Gallic idol; and, like
                    their predeceſſors the Druids, they have made human ſacrifices a cuſtomary
                    oblation at the ſhrine. We wonder at theſe things, and are ſurpriſed that any
                    thing which can even be nicknamed <hi rend="italic">ρhilofi-phy</hi> can
                    produce ſuch effects. But the taſlc of this apoſtleſhip was as eaſy as it was
                    agreeable. It was not the work of a day ; it was the completion of a ſtudied
                    corruption of principles, which is now above a century old. We may ſay that it
                    began under the clever but infamous Dubois; who from being the valet de chambre
                    of an infirm biſhop, became cardinal, and ſovereign of the Gallic church, and
                    almoſt of the ſtate. When objected to by the bigotted Louis XIV. (on a
                    preſenta-tion for preferment) as a Janſeniſt, “ <hi rend="italic">Oh qui ηon, <hi rend="sup">,</hi> *</hi> ſaid the duke of Orleans, “ <hi

                <p><hi rend="italic">qu'athee. ”</hi> He was at the utmoſt pains to bring into
                    the court every man of eminent talents in gay literature, and of licentious
                    principles in religion and morals, whom he employed in corrupting the minds of
                    the young courtiers, and giving them favourable impreſſions of the indulgence
                    which they might expect from him when he ſhould have the ſole direction of
                    affairs. This ſyſtem was moſt aſſiduouſly purſued during that moſt licentious</p>
                <p>and diſſolute adminiſtration of the regent Orleans, who was himſelf a ſpecimen
                    of elegant ſenſuality not to be matched in the annals of the world. Long before
                    the preſent day, all thinking men in France ſaw the mummery of the church, and
                    groaned under its oppreſſion; and having no other notions of religion but what
                    they were accuſtomed to from their cradle, no wonder that they diſcarded the
                    principle along with thoſe deteſtable acceſſories. The nation, therefore, being
                    greedy of flattery, buoyed up by a ſelf-conceit, in which even the ancient
                    Greeks have not ſurpaſſed them, and having been thus ſtudiouſly corrupted, and
                    long immerſed in a luxurious and refined ſenſuality, of which we in this nation
                    have not yet acquired an adequate idea, was fully prepared for feeling all the
                    effects of this fanaticiſm of NATURALISM.</p>
                <p>But this idolatry we abhor. It ſhocks our reaſon; and, although it may at firſt
                    ſeem to flatter our thought-leſs vanity, it really debaſes our nature, by taking
                    ſrom us our intellectual kindred to the mind of perfect wiſ-dom. Who would not
                    feel pleaſure in being the relation of a Bacon, of a Newton, or would thank the
                    man who detected the falſe pedigree? It puts an end to our fond hopes, that the
                    day will come when we ſhall ſurpaſs in underſtanding, in worth, and in felicity,
                    the wiſeſt, the belt, and the moſt fortunate of our ſpecies.</p>
                <p>We cannot but lament the appearances, however faint, of this ſanaticiſm among
                    ourſelves. We cannot but obſerve, that ſome of the hired directors of public
                    opinion in matters of taſte and ſcience have of late ſhow-ed a wonderful
                    tenderneſs for the bold and licentious opinions in religion, morals, and
                    politics, which are daily pouring in upon us from the preſſes of Paris. Perhaps
                    they may be incited to this conduct by the ſucceſs of their brother journaliſts
                    in that profligate metropolis; and may hope to be one day, like them, the
                    directors of the public councils and the ſovereigns of the nation. We truſt,
                    however, that the better part of the reflecting natives of Britain will not
                    allow themſelves to be ſneered out of their higheſt boaſt and their ſweeteſt
                    comforts; namely, that they are not the chance fragments of a fatal chaos, but
                    the beautiful productions</p>
                <p>of a wonderful Artiſt, and the darling objects of his care: and we aſſure
                    ourſelves that ten thouſands of our countrymen are ready to rally under the
                    banners of true religion and found philoſophy, and to follow the ſteps of a
                    Clarke, a Butler, a Newton, and a Boyle, who ſo eminently diſtinguiſhed
                    themſelves in the cauſe of Nature’s God.</p>
                <p>By nature, then, we mean that admirable ſyſtem of general laws, by which the
                    adored Author and Governor of the univerſe has thought fit to connect the
                    various parts of this wonderful and goodly frame of things, and to regulate all
                    their operations.</p>
                <p>We are not afraid of continually appealing to the laws of nature: and as we have
                    already obſerved in the article Philosophy, we conſider theſe general laws as
                    the moſt magnificent diſplays of Infinite Wiſdom, and the contemplation of them
                    as the moſt cheering employment of our underſtandings.</p>

                <p>At the fame time we deſpiſe the cold-hearted philoſo-pher who Hops ſhort here,
                    and is ſatisfied (perhaps inwardly pleaſed) that he has completely accounted for
                    every thing by the laws of unchanging nature; and weſuſpect that this
                    philoſopher would analyſe with the ſame frigid ingenuity, and explain by
                    irreſiſtible,the tender attachment of her whoſe breaſt he ſucked, and who by
                    many anxious and ſleepleſs nights preſerved alive the puling infant. But let us
                    rather liſten to the words of him who was the moſt ſagacious obſerver and the
                    moſt faithful interpreter of nature’s laws, our iſtuſtri-ous countryman Sir
                    Iſaac Newton. He ſays,</p>

                    accommodated to economical purpoſes than ſpring-water. For though rivers proceed
                    originally from ſprings, yet, by their rapid motion, and by being expoſed during
                    a long courſe to the influence of the ſun and air, the earthy and metallic ſalts
                    which they contain are decompoſed, the acid flies off, and the terreſtrial parts

                    of rain-water, which, paſſing along the ſurface of the earth, is conveyed into
                    their channels. But all rivers carry with them a great deal of mud and other
                    impurities; and, when they flow near large and populous towns, they become
