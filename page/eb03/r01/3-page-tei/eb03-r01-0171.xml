It is but a ſmall place, containing ſcarce 6000 inhabitants ; but it is a bi-ſhop’s ſee, and the harbour is defended by a citadel, where a baſhaw reſides. It was taken by the Turks in 1647, and has been in their hands ever ſince. It is about 45 miles from Candia. E. Long. 24. 45. N.Lat. 35.22.</p><p>The citadel, which ſtands on a rock jutting out into the ſea, would be ſufficient for the defence of the city, were it not ſituated at the foot of an high hill, from which it might be cannonaded with great advantage. The harbour is now almoſt ſilled with ſand, and is no longer acceſſible to ſhipping ; nor do the Turks in any meaſure oppυfe the ravages of time, but behold with a careleſs eye the moſt valuable works in a ſtate of ruin. The trench had formerly a vice-conſul at Retimo, to which ſhips uied to repair ſor cargoes of oil ; but they haye been long unable to get into the harbour : to repair which, however, and to revive the commerce of Retimo, would be a moſt uſeful attempt. The plains around the city abound in a variety of productions. Great quantities of oil, cotton, ſaffron, and wax, are produced here ; and they would be produced in ſtill greater quantities if the inhabitants could export their commodities. The gardens oſ Retimo bear the beſt fruits in the iſland ; excellent pomegranates, almonds, piſtacho nuts, and oranges. The apricot-tree, bearing the michmich, the juice of which is ſo delicious, and its flavour ſo exquiiite, is found here. It is a kind of early peach, but ſmaller and more juicy than thofe oſ France,</p><p>RETINA, in anatomy, the expanſion of the optic nerves over the bottom of the· eye, where the fenſe of viſion is firſt received.

Peculiar powers and elegance of mind are neceffary to enable us to draw all our reſources from our-felves. In a remote and folitary village the mind muſt be internally active in a great degree, or it will be mi-ferable for want of employment. But in great and populous cities, even while it is paſſive, it will be con-ſtantly amufed. It is impoffible to walk the ſtreets without finding the attention powerfully folicited on every fide. . No exertion is neceffary. objects pour themfelves into the fenfes, and it would be difficult to prevent their admittance. But, in, retirement, there wuſt be a ſpirit of philoſophy and a ſtore of learning, or elfe the fancied feenes of bliſs will vaniſli like the colours of the rainbow. Poor Cowley might be laid to be melancholy mad. He languiſhed ſor ſohtude, and wiſhed to hide himfelf in the wilds of America. But, alas ! he was not able to ſupport the ſolitude of a coun-try village within a few miles of the metropolis !</p><p>“ with a virtuous and cheerful family, with a few' faithful and good-humoured friends, with a well-felect-ed collection of elegant books, and with a competency, one may enjoy comforts even in the deferted village,' which the city, with all its diverfions, cannot fupply.”</p><p>RETORT, in chemiſtry, an oblong or globular vef-∙ fel with its neck bent, proper for diſtillation. See Chemistry, n<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 576.</p><p>In the fifth volume of the Tranfactions of the London Society for the Encouragement of Arts, p. 96. we find a paper containing a method for preventing ſtone retorts from breaking ; or flopping them when cracked, during any chemical operation, without lofing any oſ the contained ſubject. " I have always found it neceffary (fays the writer) to uſe a previous coating for filling up the interftices of the earth or ſtone, which is made by diffolving two ounces of borax in a pint of boiling water, and adding to the folution as much flaked lime as will make it into a thin paſte ; this, with a common painter’s bruſh, may be ſpread over feveral retorts, which when dry are then ready for the proper preſerving coating. The intention of this firſt coating is, that the ſubſtances thus ſpread over, readily vitrifv-ing in the fire, prevent any of the diſtilling matters from pervading the retort, but does in nowiſe prevent it from cracking.</p><p>" whenever I want to afe any of the above coated retorts ; after I have charged them with the ſubſtance to be diſtilled, I prepare a thin paſte, made with common linfeed oil and flaked lime well mixed, and perfect-ly plaſtic, that it may be eaſily ſpread : with this let the retorts be covered all over except that part of the neck which is to be inferted into the receiver ; this is readily done with a painter’s bruſh : the coating will be ſuſſiciently dry in a day or two, and they will then be ſit for ufe. with this coating I have for feveral years worked my ſtone retorts, without any danger of their breaking, and have frequently uſed the fame retort four or live times ; obſervſhg particularly to coat ■ it over with the laſt mentioned compoſition every time ’ it is charged with freſh materials: Before I made uſe oſ this expedient, it was au even chance, in conducting operations in ſtone and earthen retorts,, whether they ' did not crack every time ; by which means great loſs has been ſuſtained. Iſ at any time during the opera-tion the retorts ſhould crack, ſpread fame oſ the oil compoſition thick on the part, and fprinkle feme pow-der of ſiacked lime on it, and it immediately ſtops the ſiffure, and prevents any of the diſtilling matter from pervading ; even that fubtile penetrating ſubſtance the felid phoſphorus will not penetrate through it. It may be applied without any danger, even when the retort is red hot ; and when it is made a little ſtiffer, is more proper for luting veffels than any other I ever have tried ; becaufe if properly mixed it will never crack, nor will it indurate ſo as to endanger the breaking the necks oſ the veffels when taken off.”</p><p>RETRACTS, among horfemen, pricks in a hone's feet, arlſing ſrom the fault of the farrier in driving nails</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
