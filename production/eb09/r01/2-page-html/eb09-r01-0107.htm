Its bill and feet are black, and the&nbsp;same may be said of its whole plumage, but the feathers of&nbsp;the upper parts as well as of the breast are very glossy, reflecting a bright purple or steel-blue.@@<sup>1</sup> The species inhabits&nbsp;the whole of Europe, and the northern if not the central&nbsp;parts of Asia; but in the latter continent its southern&nbsp;range is not well determined. In America @@<sup>2</sup> it is, or used&nbsp;to be, found from the shores of the Polar Sea to Guatemala&nbsp;if not to Honduras, but is said hardly to be found of late&nbsp;years in the eastern part of the United States. In Africa&nbsp;its place is taken by three allied but well-differentiated&nbsp;species, two of which (</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Corvus umbrvnus,</span><span class="font3"> readily distinguished by its brown neck, and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">C. affinis,@@<sup>3</sup></span><span class="font3"> having its&nbsp;superior nasal bristles upturned vertically) also occur in&nbsp;South-Western Asia, while the third (</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">C. leptoηyx</span><span class="font3"> or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">C.&nbsp;tingitanus,</span><span class="font3"> a smaller species characterized by several slight&nbsp;differences) inhabits Barbary and the Atlantic Islands.&nbsp;Further to the southward in the Ethiopian Region three&nbsp;more species appear, whose plumage is varied with white&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—C. seapulatus, C. albicollis,</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">C. crαssirostris—</span><span class="font3">the first&nbsp;two of small size, but the last rivalling the real Raven in&nbsp;that respect.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">(a. n.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">RAVENNA, chief city of an Italian province of the same name, contained 18,571 inhabitants according to the&nbsp;census of 1881. It is situated in the north-east of Italy,&nbsp;in 44º 25' N. 1at. and 12º 12' E. long., about 4 miles from&nbsp;the Adriatic, with which it is now connected by the Cor-sini Canal, the two small rivers Ronco and Montone no&nbsp;longer serving as means of communication between the&nbsp;city and the sea. A railway, 26 miles long, unites&nbsp;Ravenna with Castel Bolognese on the line from Bologna&nbsp;to Rimini.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Ravenna owes both its great historic importance in the past and its comparative dulness and obscurity in the&nbsp;present to the same cause,—its position in an alluvial&nbsp;plain, formed and continually extended by the deposits&nbsp;brought down by a number of small and rapid streams&nbsp;from the neighbouring Apennines. Any one who glances&nbsp;at a map of the north-western corner of the Adriatic will&nbsp;see at once the general character of the coast,—broad&nbsp;lagunes sometimes stretching far inland ; flat alluvial&nbsp;plains intersected by endless dykes ; numerous rivers (of&nbsp;which the Po is by far the largest and makes the most&nbsp;conspicuous delta) descending from the Apennines or the&nbsp;Alps ; and, outside of all, a barrier of islands which have&nbsp;a continual tendency to become adherent to the shore&nbsp;through the new deposits which are brought down, and&nbsp;thus to be turned from islands into low hills. This description suits Venice nearly as well as it suits Ravenna,&nbsp;and the chief difference between these two great historic&nbsp;cities is that the lagunes of Ravenna are about twenty&nbsp;centuries older than those of Venice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The one transcendent interest of Ravenna to a modern traveller consists in its churches. No other city in the&nbsp;world offers so many and such striking examples of the&nbsp;ecclesiastical architecture of the centuries from the 4th to&nbsp;the 8th. The stylo is commonly called Byzantine, and no&nbsp;doubt from the close connexion of Ravenna with Constantinople considerable influence was exerted by the latter city&nbsp;on the former ; but some of the most striking features of&nbsp;the churches of Ravenna—the colonnades, the mosaics,&nbsp;perhaps the cupolas—are not so much Byzantine as representative of early Christian art generally. It is truly said&nbsp;by Mr Freeman :</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>@@@1</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pied examples are not at all uncommon in some localities and&nbsp;wholly white varieties are said to have been seen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>@@@2</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;American birds have been described as forming a distinct species&nbsp;under the name of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Corvus carnivarus</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">C. cacolotl.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>@@@3</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sharpe </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Cat. B. Brit. Museum,</span><span class="font2"> iii. p. 45) separates </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">C. affinis&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">as forming a distinct genus </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rhinocorax</span><span class="font2"> ; but it is a hard task on any&nbsp;reasonable ground to break up the genus </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Corvus</span><span class="font2"> as long accepted by&nbsp;systematists.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font2">“The outside of a Ravennese basilica is an unadorned and unattractive pile of brick. If it has any architectural grouping or outline about it, it owes it to the campanile which a later age has&nbsp;added. But if the churches of Ravenna are thus unattractive&nbsp;without, they are emphatically all glorious within. The eye dwells&nbsp;with genuine artistic delight on the long unbroken rows of pillars&nbsp;and arches, their marble shafts, their floriated capitals, sometimes&nbsp;the work of the Christian craftsman, sometimes the spoils of heathendom pressed into the service of the sanctuary. . . . The whole&nbsp;plan of these buildings allows a great field for void spaces ; but the&nbsp;void spaces thus left are filled up by these wonderful mosaic paintings which look down upon us as fresh as they were thirteen hundred&nbsp;years back.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Every traveller to Ravenna is impressed by the vividness of these decorations, which were older when Giotto painted his first fresco than Giotto’s frescos are now ; but&nbsp;we can here only allude to the subject, referring the reader&nbsp;to the article </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Mosaic</span><span class="font3"> (vol. xvi. p. 852 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">sq.).</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">The cathedral (No. 1) has been so much modernized as to have lost its interest ; but the baptistery adjoining it, decorated by&nbsp;Bishops Neon and Maximian in the δth and 6th centuries, an&nbsp;octagonal building with mosaics of the apostles on the roof, is still&nbsp;unspoiled. SS. Nazario e Celso (No. 6) is a little building in the&nbsp;form of a Latin cross, and is better known as the mausoleum of&nbsp;Galla Placidia, whose tomb and those of three emperors, her husband, brother, and son, are deposited here. It is surmounted with&nbsp;a cupola surrounded with four semi-domes, on which are depicted&nbsp;figures of the Good Shepherd with His sheep, of evangelists,&nbsp;prophets, &amp;c., and two stags drinking at a fountain. S. Apollinare&nbsp;Nuovo (No. 10) has above the arches of the nave what is perhaps&nbsp;the greatest triumph of mosaic art, two processions of virgins and&nbsp;of martyrs marching, the former from the city of Classis, the latter&nbsp;from the palace of Theodoric, to the Saviour. In the former group&nbsp;Christ sits upon the lap of His mother, and the Magi are interposed&nbsp;between Him and the procession of virgins. In the latter He is enthroned in glory and guarded by four ministrant angels. S. Vitale&nbsp;(No. 11) is doubly interesting as having furnished the model after&nbsp;which Charles the Great built his imperial minster at Aix-la-Chapelle&nbsp;and as containing full-length contemporary portraits in mosaic of&nbsp;Justinian and Theodora, surrounded by ecclesiastics, courtiers, and&nbsp;soldiers of the guard. It is surmounted by a dome, is circular in form,&nbsp;and has eight apsidal chapels all round it, one of which, corresponding to the choir in an ordinary church, is prolonged to about four&nbsp;times the length of the other apses. Unfortunately, only in this&nbsp;choir have the mosaics been preserved, but they are of the highest&nbsp;possible interest. S. Apollinare in Classe (No. 13), once the centre&nbsp;of a busy population of sailors, shopkeepers, and dock-labourers,&nbsp;now stands absolutely alone in a wide and desolate expanse 2 miles&nbsp;from the sea. The decorations of the church have suffered from damp&nbsp;—there are frequently some inches of water on the pavement—but&nbsp;the twenty-four stately marble columns with Corinthian capitals&nbsp;form a magnificent prelude to an apse covered with mosaics, among&nbsp;which is conspicuous a great jewelled cross, symbolizing the Saviour&nbsp;on the Mount of Transfiguration ; Moses and Elias lean forth from&nbsp;the clouds on either side, and in the valley below the apostles wait,&nbsp;represented symbolically as sheep. Many mosaic portraits of&nbsp;bishops of Ravenna are on the walls of the church, and a mosaic&nbsp;picture, representing Constantine Pogonatus and his brothers be-stowing a privilegium on Bishop Reparatus about the year 670.</span></p>
