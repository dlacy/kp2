 in botany: A genus oſ the decandria order, belonging to the diadelphia</p><p>claſs of plants; and in the natural method ranking under the 32d order, <hi rend="italic">Papilionaceoe.</hi> The legumen is contracted by inciſions on the inſide betwixt every two feeds, revoluted round.</p><p>There are four ſpecies; the moſt remarkable of which is the vermiculata, a native of Italy and Spain. It is an annual plant, with trailing herbaceous ſtalks, which at each joint have a ſpatular-ſhaped leaf with a long foot-ſtalk. From the wings of the leaves come out the foot-ſtalks oſ the flowers, which ſuſtain at the top one yellow butterfly flower, ſucceeded by a thick twiſted pod having the ſize and appearance of a larger caterpillar, from whence it had this title. This has long been preſerved in the gardens of this country, more on account of its odd ſhape than for any great beauty. It is propagated by lowing the ſeeds on a bed of light earth; and when the plants come up, they muſt be kept free from weeds and thinned, ſo that there may be a foot diſtance between them.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
