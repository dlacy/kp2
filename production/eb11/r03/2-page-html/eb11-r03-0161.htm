<p><span class="font1">in the breeding-season, it is separated by the prominent testicular mass. The testes in the pairing-season form projections in the&nbsp;groins, but (except in the DupIicidentata) do not completely leave&nbsp;the cavity of the abdomen. Prostate glands and, except in the&nbsp;Duplicidentata<sub>t</sub> vesiculac séminales are present in all. The uterus&nbsp;may be double, each division opening by a separate </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">os uteri</span><span class="font1"> into&nbsp;a common vagina, as in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lepondoe<sub>1</sub> Sciundae<sub>1</sub></span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hydrochoerus<sub>1</sub></span><span class="font1"> or&nbsp;two-horned, as in most species. The teats vary in number from a&nbsp;single abdominal pair in the guinea-pig to six thoracico-abdominal&nbsp;pairs in the rats; while in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Octodontidae</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Capromyidae</span><span class="font1"> they&nbsp;are placed high up on the sides of the body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There are generally nineteen dorso-lumbar vertebrae (thirteen thoracic and six lumbar), the form of which varies in different genera ;&nbsp;in the cursorial and leaping species the lumbar transverse processes&nbsp;are generally very long, and in the hares there are large compressed&nbsp;inferior spines, or hypapophyses. The caudal vertebrae. vary&nbsp;from a rudimentary condition in the guinea-pig to a great size in&nbsp;the jumping-hare.and prehensile-tailed porcupines. The scapula is&nbsp;usually narrow, with a long acromion ; the clavicles may be altogether&nbsp;absent or imperfect, as in porcupines, cavies and hares, but in most&nbsp;species are well developed. The humerus has no supra-condylar&nbsp;foramen, and the forearm bones are distinct; and in most species&nbsp;the fore foot has five digits with the phalanges normally developed,&nbsp;the first toe being but rarely rudimentary or absent. The pelvis&nbsp;has large ischia and pubes, with a long and usually bony symphysis.&nbsp;The femur varies considerably* in form, but generally has a well-defined third trochanter. In the squirrels and porcupines the&nbsp;tibia and fibula are distinct, but in rats and hares they are united,&nbsp;often high up. The hind foot is more variable than the front&nbsp;one, the digits varying in number from five, as in squirrels and rats,&nbsp;to four, as in hares, or even three, as in the capybara, viscacha and&nbsp;agouti. In the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Jaculidae</span><span class="font1"> the metatarsals are greatly elongated,&nbsp;and in some of the species, as jerboas, they are welded together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The mouth is divided into two cavities communicating by a narrow orifice, the anterior one containing the incisors and the&nbsp;posterior the molars,, the hairy skin of the face being continued&nbsp;inwards behind the incisors. This evidently prevents substances&nbsp;not intended for food getting into the mouth, as when the animal&nbsp;is engaged in gnawing through an obstacle. In hares and pacas&nbsp;the inside of the cheeks is hairy; and in some species, pouched&nbsp;rats and hamsters, there are large internal cheek-pouches lined&nbsp;with hair, which open near the angles of the mouth and extend&nbsp;backwards behind the ears. Tn the New World pouched rats&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Geomyidae)</span><span class="font1"> the pouches open externally on the cheeks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The peculiar odour evolved by many rodents is due to the secretions of special glands, which may open into the prepuce, as&nbsp;in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mus<sub>1</sub> Microtus</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cricetus<sub>1</sub></span><span class="font1"> or into the rectum, as in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Aretomys&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Thryonomys<sub>1</sub></span><span class="font1"> or into the passage common to. both, as in the&nbsp;beaver, or into pouches opening near the vent, as in hares, agoutis&nbsp;and jerboas..</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The skin is generally thin, and the panniculus carnosus muscle rarely much developed. The fur varies exceedingly in character,—&nbsp;in some, like the chinchillas and hares, being fine and soft, while in&nbsp;others it is more or less replaced by spines on the upper surface,&nbsp;as in spiny rats and porcupines; these spines in several genera,&nbsp;as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Xerus<sub>1</sub> Acornys, Platacanthomys<sub>1</sub> Echinothrix<sub>1</sub> Loncheres</span><span class="font1"> and&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Echinomys<sub>1</sub></span><span class="font1"> being flattened. In muscular structure the chief&nbsp;peculiarities are noticeable in the comparatively small size of the&nbsp;temporal muscles, and in the great double masseters (fig. 2), which&nbsp;are the principal agents in gnawing. The digastric muscles also&nbsp;are remarkable for their well-defined central tendon, and in many&nbsp;species their anterior bellies are united between the.two halves of&nbsp;the lower jaw. The cleido-mast.oid generally arises from the&nbsp;basi-occipital, and the pectoralis major is connected with&nbsp;the latissimus dorsi. In porcupines and hares the tendons of&nbsp;the flexor digitorum Iongus and flexor hallucis longus are connected&nbsp;in the foot, while in the rats and squirrels they are separate, and&nbsp;the flexor digitorum longus is generally inserted into the metatarsal&nbsp;of the first toe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Classification.—</span><span class="font1">Some diversity of view obtains among naturalists with regard to the classification of the order; the&nbsp;scheme here followed being the one adopted (with some modifications of nomenclature) by Professor Max Weber in his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sauge-thiere.</span><span class="font1"> The number of genera is so great that only the more&nbsp;important can be noticed. All authorities are agreed in dividing&nbsp;rodents into two great sections or sub-orders, the one, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dupli-Cidentata,</span><span class="font1"> comprising only the hares, rabbits and picas, and&nbsp;the other, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Simplicidentata,</span><span class="font1"> all the rest. In the latter there&nbsp;is only one pair of incisor teeth in the upper jaw, in which the&nbsp;enamel is confined to the front surface. The incisive foramina&nbsp;of the palate are moderate and distinct; the fibula does not&nbsp;articulate with the calcanéum; and the testes are abdominal,&nbsp;and descend periodically only into the inguinal canal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sewellels.</span><span class="font1">—The first family is represented by certain peculiar North American rodents known as sewellels, constituting the genus</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Haplodon</span><span class="font1"> (or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Aplodon)</span><span class="font1"> and the family Haplodontidae and section Haplodontoidea. In common with the next three sections these&nbsp;rodents have the angular process of the lower jaw (fig. 4) arising&nbsp;from the inferior surface of the socket of the incisor. The masseter</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">muscle does not pass through the narrow infra-orbital canal. An alisphenoid canal may be present on the palatal aspect of the&nbsp;skull; but there is always a transverse canal. The malleus and&nbsp;incus of the inner ear are separate. The humerus often has a&nbsp;foramen (entepicondylar) on the inner side of its lower end; the&nbsp;tibia and fibula may be separate or united; but the scaphoid and&nbsp;lunar of the carpus are also united, while the centrale is free. The&nbsp;stomach is simple.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Sewellcls are medium-sized terrestrial rodents, with no postorbital process to the skull, which is depressed in form, and rootless cheek-teeth, among which the premolars number </span><span class="font0">f, </span><span class="font1">the first in the upper jaw being very small. The build is stout and heavy,&nbsp;the limbs and tail are short, the ears moderate, the eyes minute and&nbsp;the feet five-toed and plantigrade. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Haplodon</span><span class="font1"> is represented by a&nbsp;small number of species in America west of the Rocky Mountains,&nbsp;of which </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">H. rufus</span><span class="font1"> is the longest known. They are burrowing, and,&nbsp;in some cases at any rate, partially aquatic rodents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Squirrel Group.</span><span class="font1">—The Sciuroidea, which include the great group of squirrels, sousliks, marmots, &amp;c., all comprised in the&nbsp;single family Sciuridae, differ from the sewellels in having large&nbsp;post-orbital processes to the skull (figs. 4, 5, 6); and, with one&nbsp;exception, have rooted cheek-teeth, the premolar-formula being&nbsp;5-γΙ. The infra-orbital foramen is also narrower, and the tympanic&nbsp;bulla is cellular. In both groups the tibia and fibula are separate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The family is divided into three Sub-families, the first of which is the Sciurinae. In this the crowns of the molars are more or less&nbsp;shortened, with their cusps either arranged in longitudinal lines, or&nbsp;forming four upper and three lower more or less distinct oblique&nbsp;ridges. The post-orbital processes of the frontal and jugal are&nbsp;widely sundered, and the former may even be small </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Xerus).</span><span class="font1"> The&nbsp;expanded anterior root of the zygomatic process has its front&nbsp;border oblique. According to modern views the sub-family is&nbsp;broken up into a large number of genera.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The first of these is </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rhithrosciurus<sub>1</sub></span><span class="font1"> represented by one large species (R. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">notatus)</span><span class="font1"> from Borneo, characterized by its finely grooved in&nbsp;cisors (see Groove-Toothed Squirrel). The second genus,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Heliosciurus<sub>1</sub></span><span class="font1"> includes arboreal African squirrels, typified by </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">H.&nbsp;stangeri,</span><span class="font1"> allied in the characters of their skulls to the undermentioned </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Xerus<sub>1</sub></span><span class="font1"> and with a very large pre-orbital foramen in the&nbsp;more typical forms. The third, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Funisciurus<sub>1</sub></span><span class="font1"> of which </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">F. pyrrhopus&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">is a well-known example, is also African and allied to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Xerus<sub>1&nbsp;</sub></span><span class="font1">but has a still longer skull and soft fur. In </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Xerus</span><span class="font1"> itself, which&nbsp;is represented by the terrestrial African spiny squirrels, the ears&nbsp;are short, there are only two teats, and flat spines are mingled&nbsp;with the fur; while the skull, and more especially the frontals, is&nbsp;elongated, with a very short post-orbital process, and the crowns&nbsp;of the molars are taller than usual (see Spiny Squirrel). The&nbsp;well-known Indian palm-squirrel, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Funambulus palmorum,</span><span class="font1"> typifies&nbsp;an Indo-Malay genus allied to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Xerus</span><span class="font1"> in skull-characters but with&nbsp;molars more like those of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sciurus.</span><span class="font1"> In contrast to these small&nbsp;striped species are the giant squirrels of the same region, such as&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ratufa indica</span><span class="font1"> and R. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bicolor,</span><span class="font1"> which are very brightly coloured&nbsp;rodents, with Scxiinii-Iike skulls (fig. 5) but extremely short-crowned molars, and only one pair of upper premolars. Next&nbsp;comes the typical </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sciurus<sub>1</sub></span><span class="font1"> including the great bulk of the entire&nbsp;group, and ranging over Europe, Asia, North Africa and America.&nbsp;The skull is short and broad, especially as regards the frontals,&nbsp;with large post-orbital processes (fig. 5), and very generally two&nbsp;upper premolars, making a total of five pairs of upper cheek-teeth,&nbsp;which have crowns of medium height. The teats are either four&nbsp;or six. Squirrels of this and the other arboreal groups have the&nbsp;bodily form slender and agile, the tail long and bushy, the ears&nbsp;well developed, pointed and often tufted; the feet adapted for</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
