<p><span class="font0">ſtrument thus fitted on the dividing-wheel may be moved to any angle by the ſcrew and divided circle on&nbsp;its arbor, and that this angle may be marked on the&nbsp;limb of the inſtrument with the greateſt exactneſs by&nbsp;the dividing-point or tracer, which can only move in&nbsp;■a direct line tending to the centre, and is altogether&nbsp;freed from thofe inconveniences that attend cutting.by&nbsp;means cf a ſtraight edge. This method of drawing&nbsp;lines will alfo prevent any error that might ariſe irom&nbsp;an expanſion or contraction of the metal during the&nbsp;time of dividing,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">. &quot; The ſcrew-frame is fixed on the top of a conical pillar, wlιich turns freely round its axis, and alſo moves&nbsp;freely towards or from the centre of the wheel, ſo&nbsp;that the ſcrew-frame may be entirely guided^ by the&nbsp;frame which connects it with the centre : by this means ∙&nbsp;any exceπtricity of the wheel and the arbor would not&nbsp;produce any error in the dividing ; and, by a particular&nbsp;contrivance (which will be deſcribed hereafter), the&nbsp;fcrew when preſſed againſt the teeth of the wheel always&nbsp;moves parallel to itfelf ; ſo that a line joining the centre&nbsp;of the arbor and the tracer continued, will always make&nbsp;equal angles with the ſcrew.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">&quot; Figure I. repreſents a perſpective view of the en-gine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ Fig. 2. is a plan, of which ſig. 3. repreſents a ſec-tion on the line <sup>ΠΛ</sup>»</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">&quot; The large wheel A is 45 inches in diameter, and has ten radii, each being ſupported by edge-bars, as&nbsp;repreſented in fig. 3· Fheſe bars and radii are con-nected by the circular ring B, 24 inches in diameter&nbsp;and 3 deep ; and, for greater ſtrength, the whole is caſt&nbsp;in one piecc in bell-metal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ As the whole weight of the wheel A reſts on its ring B, the edge-bars are deepeſt where they join it ;&nbsp;and from thence their depth diminiſhes, both towards&nbsp;the centre and the circumference, as repreſented in&nbsp;fig. 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ The ſurface of the wheel A was worked very even and flat, and its circumference turned true. The ring&nbsp;C, of fine braſs, was fitted very exactly on the circumference of the wheel ; and vvas faſtened thereon with&nbsp;ſcrews, which, after being ſcrewed as tight as poffible,&nbsp;were well rivetted. The face of a large chuck being&nbsp;turned very true and fiat in the lath, the flattened ſurface A of the wheel was faſtened agaſhſt it with hold-faſts ; and the two ſurfaces and circumference of the&nbsp;ring C, a hole through the centre and the plane part&nbsp;round (b) it, and the lower edge of the ring B, were&nbsp;turned at the ſame time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ D is a piece of hard bell-metal, having the hole, which receives the ſteel-arbor (d), made very ſtraight&nbsp;and true. This bell-metal was turned very true on&nbsp;an arbor ; and the face, which reſts on the wheel at (b),&nbsp;was turned very flat, ſo that the ſteel arbor (d} might&nbsp;ſtand perpendicular to the plane of the wheel : this&nbsp;bell-metal was faſtened to the wheel by ſix ſteel&nbsp;ſcrews (1).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">&quot; A braſs ſocket Z is faſtened on the centre of the mahogany ſtand, and receives the lower part of the&nbsp;bell-metal piece D, being made to touch the bell-metal in a narrow part near the mouth, to prevent any&nbsp;obliquity of the wheel from bending the arbor : good&nbsp;fitting is by no means neceſſary. here ; ſince any ſtiake&nbsp;in this ſocket will produce no bad effect, as will appear&nbsp;hereafter when we deſcribe the cutting frame.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ The wheel was then put on its ſtand, the lower edge of the ring B reſting on the circumference of&nbsp;three conical friction-pulleys W, to facilitate its motion round its centre. The axis of one of theſe pulleys&nbsp;is in a line joining the centre of the wheel and the&nbsp;middle of the endlefs ſcrew, and the other two placed&nbsp;ſo as to be at equal diſtances from each other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">&quot; F is a block of wood ſtrongly faſtened to one of the legs of the ſtand; the piece (g) is ſcrewed to the upper&nbsp;ſide of the block, and has half holes, in which the&nbsp;tranſverſe axis (h) turns : the half holes are kept toge-ther by the ſcrews (i).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">&quot; The lower extremity of the conical pillar P termi-nates in a cylindrical ſteel·pin (k), which paſſes through and turns in the tranſverſe axis (h), and is confined by&nbsp;a cheek and ſcrew.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">&quot; To the upper end of the conical pillar is faſtened the frame G, in which the endlefs ſcrew turns : the&nbsp;pivots of the ſcrew are formed in the manner of two&nbsp;fruſtums of cones joined by a cylinder, as repreſented at X. Thefe pivots are confined between half&nbsp;poles, which preſs only on the conical parts, and do&nbsp;not touch the cylindric parts ί the half holes are kept&nbsp;together by ſcrews (a), which may be tightened at any&nbsp;time, to prevent the ſcrew from ſhaking in the frame.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ Οη the fcrew-arbor is a ſmall wheel of braſs K, having its outſide edge divided into 60 parts, and numbered at every 6th diviſion with 1, 2, &amp;c. to 10. I he&nbsp;motion of this wheel is ſhown by the index (y) on the&nbsp;ſcrew-frame G.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">&quot; H repreſents a part of the ſtand, having a parallel flit in the direction towards the centre of the wheel,&nbsp;large enough to receive the upper part of the conical&nbsp;braſs pillar P, which carries the ſcrew and its frame :&nbsp;and as the reſiſtance, when the wheel is moved by the&nbsp;endleſs ſcrew, is againſt that ſide of the flit H which&nbsp;is towards the left hand, that ſide of the flit is faced&nbsp;with braſs, and the pillar is preſſed againſt it by a&nbsp;ſteel fpring on the oppoſite ſide </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i</span><span class="font0"> by this means the&nbsp;pillar is ſtrongly ſupported laterally, and yet the ſcrew&nbsp;may be eaſily preffed from or againſt the circumference&nbsp;of the wheel, and the pillar will turn freely on its axis&nbsp;to take any direction given it by the frame L.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ At each corner of the piece I are ſcrews (n) of tempered ſteel, having poliſhed conical points : two of&nbsp;them turn in conical holes in the ſcrew-frame near (o),&nbsp;and the points of the oth¢r two fcrews turn in holes&nbsp;in the piece Qj the ſcrews (p) are of ſteel, which being&nbsp;tightened, prevent the conical pointed ſcrews from unturning when the frame is moved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ L is a braſs frame, which ſerves to connect the end-leſs ſcrew, its frame, &amp;c. with the centre of the wheel : each arm of this frame is terminated by a ſteel ſcrew,&nbsp;that may be paſſed through any of the holes (q) in the&nbsp;piece Q, as the thicknefs of work to be divided on&nbsp;the wheel may require, and are faſtened by the finger-nuts (r).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">&quot; At the other end of this frame is a flat piece of tempered ſteel (b), wherein is an angular notch : when&nbsp;the endleſs ſcrew is preſſed againſt the teeth on the circumference of the wheel, which may be done by turning the ſinger-ſcrew S, to preſs againſt the ſpring (t),</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
