They were ſo ſubordinate to the ſuperior rulers of the church, that, by a canon of the council of Laodicea, they were forbidden to sit in the preſence of a deacon without his leave. According to the canons, a perſon muſt be twenty two years of age to be promoted to the order of ſubdeacon. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Deacon.</hi></p></div></body></text></TEI>
