<p><span class="font2">accorded to the earlier Sophists, such as Protagoras, and the influence which the school of Isocrates exerted through&nbsp;the men whom it had trained. Rhetoric had won its place&nbsp;in education. It kept that place, through varying fortunes, to the fall of the Roman empire, and resumed it,&nbsp;for a while, at the revival of learning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Aristotle’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rhetoric</span><span class="font2"> belongs to the generation after Isocrates, having been composed between 330 and 322&nbsp;B.c. As controversial allusions sometimes hint, it holds&nbsp;Isocrates for one of the foremost exponents of the subject.&nbsp;From a merely literary point of view, Aristotle’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rhetoric&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">(with the partial exception of book iii.) is one of the&nbsp;driest works in the world. From the historical or scientific&nbsp;point of view, it is one of the most curious and the most&nbsp;interesting. If we would seize the true significance of the&nbsp;treatise, it is better to compare rhetoric with grammar&nbsp;than with its obvious analogue, logic. A method of&nbsp;grammar was the conception of the Alexandrian age,&nbsp;which had lying before it the standard masterpieces of&nbsp;Greek literature, and deduced the “ rules ” of grammar&nbsp;from the actual practice of the best writers. Aristotle,&nbsp;in the latter years of the 4th century b.c., held the same&nbsp;position relatively to the monuments of Greek oratory&nbsp;which the Alexandrian methodizers of grammar held relatively to Greek literature at large. Abundant materials&nbsp;lay before him, illustrating, in the greatest variety of&nbsp;forms, how speakers </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">had</span><span class="font2"> been able to persuade the reason&nbsp;or to move the feelings. From this mass of material, said&nbsp;Aristotle, let us try to generalize. Let us deduce rules,&nbsp;by applying which a speaker shall always be able to persuade the reason or to move the feelings. And, when we&nbsp;have got our rules, let us digest them into an intelligent&nbsp;method, and so construct a true art. Aristotle’s practical&nbsp;purpose was undoubtedly real. If we are to make persuasive speakers, he believed, this is the only sound way to&nbsp;set about it. But, for us moderns, the enduring interest&nbsp;of his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rhetoric</span><span class="font2"> is mainly retrospective. It attracts us as a&nbsp;feat in analysis by an acute mind—a feat highly characteristic of that mind itself, and at the same time strikingly&nbsp;illustrative of the field over which the materials have been&nbsp;gathered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rhetoric is properly an art. This is the proposition from which Aristotle sets out. It is so because, when a speaker&nbsp;persuades, it is possible to find out why he succeeds in doing so.&nbsp;Rhetoric is, in fact, the popular branch of logic. Now hitherto,&nbsp;Aristotle says, the essence of rhetoric has been neglected for the&nbsp;accidents. Writers on rhetoric have hitherto concerned themselves&nbsp;mainly with “the exciting of prejudice, of pity, of anger, and suchlike emotions of the soul.” All this is very well, but “it has&nbsp;nothing to do with the matter in hand ; it has regard to the&nbsp;judge.” The true aim should be to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">prove</span><span class="font1"> your point, or seem to&nbsp;prove it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Here we may venture to interpolate a comment which has a general bearing on Aristotle’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rhetoric.</span><span class="font1"> It is quite true that, if&nbsp;we start from the conception of rhetoric as a branch of logic, the&nbsp;phantom of logic in rhetoric claims precedence over appeals to&nbsp;passion. But Aristotle does not sufficiently regard the question—&nbsp;What, as a matter of experience, is most persuasive ? The phantom&nbsp;of logic may be more persuasive with the more select hearers of&nbsp;rhetoric ; but rhetoric is not for the more select ; it is for the&nbsp;many, and with the many appeals to passion will sometimes,&nbsp;perhaps usually, be more effective than the semblance of the&nbsp;syllogism. And here we seem to touch the basis of the whole&nbsp;practical vice—it was not strictly a theoretical vice—in the old&nbsp;world’s view of rhetoric, which, after Aristotle’s day, was&nbsp;ultimately Aristotelian. No formulation of rhetoric can correspond with fact which does not leave it absolutely to the genius of&nbsp;the speaker whether reasoning (or its phantom) is to be what&nbsp;Aristotle calls it, the “body of proof” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(σώμα πiστtωs),</span><span class="font1"> or whether&nbsp;the stress of persuading elfort should not be rather addressed to the&nbsp;emotions of the hearers. This is a matter of tact, of instinct, of&nbsp;oratorical genius.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But we can entirely agree with Aristotle in his next remark, which is historical in its nature. The deliberative branch of rhetoric had hitherto been postponed, he observes, to the forensic.&nbsp;We have already seen the primary cause of this, namely, that&nbsp;the very origin of rhetoric in Hellas was forensic. The most&nbsp;urgent need which the citizen felt for this art was not when&nbsp;lie had to discuss the interests of the city, but when lie had to&nbsp;defend (perhaps) his own property or his own life. The relative&nbsp;subordination of deliberative rhetoric, however unscientific, had&nbsp;thus been human. Aristotle’s next statement, that the master of&nbsp;logic will be the master of rhetoric, is a truism if we concede the&nbsp;essential primacy of the logical element in rhetoric. Otherwise it&nbsp;is a paradox ; and it is not in accord with experience, which teaches&nbsp;that speakers incapable of showing even the ghost of an argument&nbsp;have sometimes been the most completely successful in carrying&nbsp;great audiences along with them. Aristotle never assumes that&nbsp;the hearers of his rhetorician are as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ol χaριerτes,</span><span class="font1"> the cultivated&nbsp;few ; on the other hand, he is apt to assume tacitly—and here his&nbsp;individual bent comes out—that these hearers are not the great&nbsp;surging crowd, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">t&gt;χλos,</span><span class="font1"> but a body of persons with a decided,&nbsp;though imperfectly developed, preference for sound logic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">What is the use of an art of rhetoric ? It is fourfold, Aristotle replies. Rhetoric is useful, first of all, because truth and justice&nbsp;are naturally stronger than their opposites. When awards are&nbsp;not duly given, truth and justice must have been worsted by their&nbsp;own fault. This is worth correcting. Rhetoric is then (1)&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">corrective.</span><span class="font1"> Next, it is (2) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">instructive,</span><span class="font1"> as a popular vehicle of&nbsp;persuasion for persons who could not be reached by the severer&nbsp;methods of strict logic. Then it is (3) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">suggestive.</span><span class="font1"> Logic and&nbsp;rhetoric are the two impartial arts ; that is to say, it is a matter&nbsp;of indifference to them, as arts, whether the conclusion which they&nbsp;draw in any given case is affirmative or negative. Suppose that I&nbsp;am going to plead a cause, and have a sincere conviction that I am&nbsp;on the right side. The art of rhetoric will suggest to me what&nbsp;might be urged on the other side ; and this will give me a stronger&nbsp;grasp of the whole situation. Lastly, rhetoric is (4) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">defensive.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">Mental effort is more distinctive of man than bodily effort ; and “it&nbsp;would be absurd that, while incapacity for physical self-defence is&nbsp;a reproach, incapacity for mental defence should be no reproach.”&nbsp;Rhetoric, then, is corrective, instructive, suggestive, defensive. But&nbsp;what if it be urged that this art may be abused ? The objection,&nbsp;Aristotle answers, applies to all good things, except virtue, and&nbsp;especially to the most useful things. Men may abuse strength,&nbsp;health, wealth, generalship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The function of the medical art is not necessarily to cure, but to make such progress towards a cure as each case may admit.&nbsp;Similarly it would be inaccurate to say that the function of&nbsp;rhetoric was to persuade. Rather must rhetoric be defined as&nbsp;“the faculty of discerning in every case the available means of&nbsp;persuasion.” Suppose that among these means of persuasion is&nbsp;some process of reasoning which the rhetorician himself knows to&nbsp;be unsound. That belongs to the province of rhetoric all the&nbsp;same. In relation to logic, a man is called a “sophist” with&nbsp;regard to his moral purpose </span><span class="font0">(7rp0αipeσts), </span><span class="font1">i.e., if he knowingly&nbsp;uses a fallacious syllogism. But rhetoric takes no account of the&nbsp;moral purpose. It takes account simply of the faculty </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Zυvaμιs)&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">—the faculty of discovering any means of persuasion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The “available means of persuasion,” universally considered, may be brought under two classes. (1) First, there are the proofs&nbsp;external to the art,—not furnished by rhetoric,—the “inartificial&nbsp;proofs ” (⅛τeχvoι </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">n'ισrtιs).</span><span class="font1"> Such are the depositions made by&nbsp;witnesses, documents, and the like. (2) Secondly, there are the&nbsp;proofs, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font1"> the agents of persuasion, which the art of rhetoric&nbsp;itself provides, the “artificial proofs” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(tvτsχvoι τrιστιis).</span><span class="font1"> These&nbsp;are of three kinds :—(a) logical </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(∖oyικτ] πiστιs)—</span><span class="font1">demonstration,&nbsp;or seeming demonstration, by argument ; (δ) ethical </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(hθικ^∣ πlστιs),&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">when the speaker succeeds in conveying such an impression of his&nbsp;own character as may lead the hearers to put trust in him ; (c)&nbsp;emotional </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(παθητική</span><span class="font1"> πiστιs), when the speaker works persuasively&nbsp;on the feelings of the hearers. It follows that, besides logical&nbsp;skill, the rhetorician should possess the power of analysing&nbsp;character, in order to present himself in the ethical light which&nbsp;will be most effective with his audience. He must also understand the sources of the emotions, and the means of producing&nbsp;them. Hence rhetoric has a double relationship. While in one&nbsp;aspect—the most important to it as an art—it may be regarded as&nbsp;popular logic, in another aspect it is related to ethics. And hence,&nbsp;says Aristotle, political science (πολιτική) being a branch of&nbsp;ethical, as the citizen is one aspect of the man, “rhetoric and its&nbsp;professors slip into the garb of political science (6πoδueται τδ&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">σχr∣μa</span><span class="font1"> τδ τi)s πoλιτικi)s), either through want of education, or&nbsp;from pretentiousness, or from other human causes.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Aristotle now proceeds to analyse the first of the “artificial proofs,” the logical (λογική </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">πiσ∏s).</span><span class="font1"> Answering to the strict&nbsp;syllogism of logic, rhetoric has its popular syllogism, to which&nbsp;Aristotle gives the name of “enthymeme” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Gvθi&gt;∣pημa).</span><span class="font1"> This&nbsp;term (from the verb </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">fvθυμeiσθaι,</span><span class="font1"> “ to revolve in the mind ”), means&nbsp;properly “ a consideration ” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">or</span><span class="font1"> “reflection.” It occurs first in&nbsp;Isocrates, who uses it simply of the “thoughts” or “sentiments”&nbsp;with which a rhetorician embellishes his work (τoΓs </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">tvθυμhμaσi&nbsp;πpeτr0vτωs 'όλον rbv K6yov κaτaτroικiλaι, Or.,</span><span class="font1"> xiii. § 16). Whether&nbsp;the technical sense was or was not known before Aristotle, it is to</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
