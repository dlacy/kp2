<p><span class="font2">senate was his main object. With this purpose he had already, when consul in 88, made the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">senatus auctoritas</span><span class="font2"> legally&nbsp;necessary for proposals to the assembly. He now as&nbsp;dictator@@<sup>1</sup> followed this up by crippling the power of the magistracy, which had been the most effective weapon in the hands of&nbsp;the senate’s opponents. The legislative freedom of the tribunes&nbsp;was already hampered by the necessity of obtaining the senate’s&nbsp;sanction; in addition, Sulla restricted their wide powers of&nbsp;interference </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(intercessio)</span><span class="font2"> to their original purpose of protecting&nbsp;individual plebeians,@@<sup>2</sup> and discredited the office by prohibiting&nbsp;a tribune from holding any subsequent office in the state.@@<sup>3</sup> The&nbsp;control of the courts </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(quaesliones perpetuae)</span><span class="font2"> was taken from the&nbsp;equestrian order and restored to the senate.@@<sup>4</sup> To prevent the&nbsp;people from suddenly installing and keeping in high office a&nbsp;second Marius, he re-enacted the old law against re-election,@@<sup>5&nbsp;</sup>and made legally binding the custom which required a man&nbsp;to mount up gradually to the consulship through the lower&nbsp;offices@@.<sup>6</sup> His increase of the number of praetors from six to&nbsp;eight,@@<sup>7</sup> and of quaestors to twenty,@@<sup>8</sup> though required by administrative necessities, tended, by enlarging the numbers and&nbsp;further dividing the authority of the magistrates, to render&nbsp;them still more dependent upon the central direction of the&nbsp;senate. Lastly, he replaced the pontifical and augural colleges&nbsp;in the hands of the senatorial nobles, by enacting that vacancies&nbsp;in them should, as before the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">lex Domitia</span><span class="font2"> (104), be&nbsp;filled up by co-optation.@@<sup>9</sup> It cannot be said that</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Sulla was successful in fortifying the republican system against the dangers which menaced it from without. He&nbsp;accepted as an accomplished fact the enfranchisement of the&nbsp;Italians,@@<sup>10</sup> but he made no provision to guard against the consequent reduction of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">comilia</span><span class="font2"> to an absurdity,@@<sup>11</sup> and with them&nbsp;of the civic government which rested upon them, or to organize&nbsp;an effective administrative system for the Italian communities.@@<sup>12&nbsp;</sup>Of all men, too, Sulla had the best reason to appreciate the&nbsp;dangers to be feared from the growing independence of governors&nbsp;and generals in the provinces, and from the transformation of&nbsp;the old civic militia into a group of professional armies, devoted</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2">only to a successful leader, and with the weakest possible sense of allegiance to the state. He had himself, as proconsul of&nbsp;Asia, contemptuously and successfully defied the home government, and he, more than any other Roman general, had taught&nbsp;his soldiers to look only to their leader, and to think only of&nbsp;booty.@@<sup>13</sup> Yet, beyond a few inadequate regulations, there is no&nbsp;evidence that Sulla dealt with these burning questions, the&nbsp;settlement of which was among the greatest of the achievements&nbsp;of Augustus.@@<sup>14</sup> One administrative reform of real importance&nbsp;must, lastly, be set down to his credit. The judicial procedure&nbsp;first established in 149 for the trial of cases of magisterial&nbsp;extortion in the provinces, and applied between 149&nbsp;and 8r to cases of treason and bribery, Sulla extended&nbsp;so as to bring under it the chief criminal offences, and thus laid&nbsp;the foundations of the Roman criminal law.@@<sup>15</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Sullan system stood for nine years, and was then overthrown—as it had been established—by a successful soldier. It was the fortune of Cn. Pompeius, a favourite officer&nbsp;of Sulla, first of all to violate in his own person&nbsp;the fundamental principles of the constitution reestablished by his old chief, and then to overturn it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In Spain the Marian governor Q. Sertorius (see Sertorius) had defeated one after another of the pro-consuls sent out by the senate, and was already in 77&nbsp;master of all Hither Spain. To meet the crisis,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Pompey, who was not yet thirty, and had never held even the quaestorship, was sent out to Spain with proconsular&nbsp;authority.@@<sup>16</sup> Still Sertorius held out, until in 73 he was&nbsp;foully murdered by his own officers. The native Iribes&nbsp;who had loyally stood by him submitted, and Pompey&nbsp;early in 71 returned with his troops to Italy, where,&nbsp;during his absence in Spain, an event had occurred which had&nbsp;shown Roman society with startling plainness how near it stood&nbsp;to revolution. In 73 Spartacus,@@<sup>17</sup> a Thracian slave,&nbsp;escaped with seventy others from a gladiators’ training&nbsp;school at Capua. In an incredibly short time he found himself&nbsp;at the head of 70,000 runaway slaves, outlaws, brigands and&nbsp;impoverished peasants, and for two years terrorized Italy,&nbsp;routed the legions sent against him, and even threatened&nbsp;Rome. He was at length defeated and slain by the praetor,&nbsp;M. Licinius Crassus, in Apulia. In Rome itself the various&nbsp;classes and parties hostile to the Sullan system had,&nbsp;ever since Sulla’s death in 78, been incessantly agitating for the repeal of his most obnoxious laws, and needed only</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>

Sulla also added&nbsp;one to the long list of laws dealing with extortion in the provinces.&nbsp;But the danger lay, not in the want of laws, but in the want of&nbsp;security for their observance by an absolutely autocratic proconsul.&nbsp;The present writer cannot agree with those who would include&nbsp;among Sulla’s laws one retaining consuls and praetors in Rome for&nbsp;their year of office and then sending them out to a province.. This&nbsp;was becoming the common practice before 81. After 81 it is invariable for praetors, as needed for the judicial work, and invariable&nbsp;but for two exceptions in the case of consuls; but nowhere&nbsp;is there a hint that there had been any legislation on the subject,&nbsp;and there are indications that it was convenience and not law&nbsp;which maintained the arrangement.
