The ruin of the kingdom in this reſpect, however, was completed by Philip III. who, at the inſtigation of the inquiſition, and by the advice of his prime miniſter the duke of Lerma, expelled from the kingdom all the Morescoes or Moors, deſcendants of the ancient conquerors of Spain. Thirty days only were allowed them to prepare for their departure, and it was death to remain beyond that time. The reaſon for this barbarous decree was, that theſe people were ſtill Mahometans in their hearts, though they conformed externally to the rites of Chriſtianity, and thus might corrupt the true faith. The Moreſcoes, however, choſe themſelves a king, and attempted to oppoſe the royal mandate ; but, being almoſt entirely unprovided with arms, they were ſoon obliged to submit, and all baniſhed the kingdom. By this violent and impolitic meaſure, Spain loſt almoſt a million of induſtrious inhabitants; and as the kingdom was already depopulated by bloody wars, by repeated emigrations to America, and enervated by luxury, it now ſank into a ſtate of languor from whence it has never recovered.</p><p>In conſequence of this languor, and the maladministration of the Spaniſh governors, Portugal, which had been reduced by Philip II. revolted, and has ever ſince been an independent kingdom @@*. However, the memory of what Spain once was, remained for a conſiderable time, and the power of that kingdom long continued to be feared after it had ceaſed to be powerful. In the time of queen Anne, a Britiſh army was ſeen for the firſt time in Spain, in order to ſupport Charles of Auſtria againſt Philip the grandſon of Louis XIV. The ill ſucceſs of that attempt is related under the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Britain,</hi> n⁰ 342—359 ; and thus the crown of Spain fell to a branch of the houſe of Bourbon, in conſequence of which the courts of France and Spain generally acted in the cloſeſt concert till the revolution, which at preſent aſtoniſhes Europe, put an end to monarchical government in the former country. The wars of theſe two courts with <hi rend="smallcaps">Britain</hi> are related under that article and <hi rend="smallcaps">America</hi> ; and theſe, with an unſuccessful attempt on Algiers, and the threatened war reſpecting NOOTKA <hi rend="italic">Sound</hi> (ſee that article), conſtitute the moſt important part of the Spaniſh hiſtory till the deposition and murder of Louis XVI. of France. On that event Spain joined her forces to thoſe of the Empire, Britain, and Pruſſia, to chaſtiſe the Convention, and prevent thoſe democratical principles which had ruined France from being ſpread through the other nations of Europe. We cannot ſay that her exertions added much to the ſtrength of the alliance; and being unable to defend herſelf againſt the furious inroads of the republican troops, ſhe was glad to make a ſeparate peace with the Convention. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Revolution.</hi></p><p>The air of Spain, during the months of June, July, and Auguſt, is exceſſively hot in the day-time ; but the reſt of the year it is pleaſant and temperate. Even during the above months it is very cool in the ſhade ; and so cold in the night, that it makes a traveller ſhiver ; and in the day-time the violent heat continues only for about four or five hours. In the north, on</p><p>the mountains, and near the ſea-coaſt, the air is much leſs ſultry in ſummer than in the ſouth, eſpecially in the lower parts of the country, and at a diſtance from the ſea. It ſeldom rains here, except about the equinoxes : the froſts are very gentle towards the ſouth ; but on the mountains in the north and north-eaſt the air is very ſharp in winter.</p><p>Though there are ſome ſandy barren deſerts in the ſouth, and many barren mountains in the north, yet in the greater part of the country, particularly in the valleys and plains, the ſoil is good, producing a great variety of rich wines, oil, and fruits ; ſuch as oranges, lemons, prunes, citrons, almonds, raiſins, dates, figs, cheſnuts, pomegranates, capers, pears, and peaches ; but not a ſufficiency of grain, which is chiefly owing to the neglect of tillage. Wheat and barley are the moſt common grain ; the former of which is ſaid by ſome to be the beſt in Europe. There is not much flax, hemp, oats, or hay, in Spain : but there is plenty of honey, ſalt, fine wool, ſilk, and cotton ; and, in ſome places, of rice and ſugar-canes. Here alſo are abundance of mules, and, in ſome provinces, of horſes, together with, deer, wild fowl, and other game, chamois and other goats, but few horned cattle. Wolves are almoſt the only wild beaſts in the country. The herb kali, which is uſed in making ſalt, ſoap, and glaſs, grows in great plenty on the ſea-ſhore. The wild bulls, uſed in their bull-fights, are bred in Andaluſia. The ſeas about Spain: are well ſtored with fiſh; among which is the anchovy, in the Mediterranean. We may gueſs at the number of ſheep here by that of the ſhepherds, which is ſaid to be about forty thouſand. The ſheep that bear the fine wool move regularly, every ſummer, from ſouth to north, along the mountains, which yield a great variety of ſweet herbs and plants, and return again towards winter. During this progreſs, large quantities of ſalt are diſtributed among them, and all poſſible care is taken both of their health and fleeces.</p><p>The chief mountains are the Pyrenees, which ſtretch from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic Ocean, but not in a direct line, for near 200 miles : their breadth is, in ſome places, not leſs than 80. That called the <hi rend="italic">Pic de Midi</hi> is of a prodigious height. Over theſe mountains there are only about five paſſages out of Spain into France, and theſe alſo narrow ; even the valleys between the mountains are covered with thick and lofty woods. The other chains in Spain are the Sierra d’Occa, Sierra Molino, Sierra Moreno, and Sierra Nevada or the ſnowy mountains. Near Gibraltar, opposite to Mount Abyla in Africa, ſtands the celebrated Mount Calpe : theſe were anciently called <hi rend="italic">Hercules's pillars.</hi> The mountains yield great quantities of timber for ſhipping, which are conveyed by the Ebro and other rivers to the Mediterranean. According to the ancient and modern writers, they abound alſo with gold, ſilver, iron, lead, tin, cinnabar, quickſilver, alum, vitriol, copperas, lapis calaminaris, &amp;c. beſides gems, and mineral waters both hot and cold. The gold and ſilver mines are not worked at preſent, but those of iron are. The neglect of the former is owing partly to the indolence of the Spaniards, and partly to the gold and ſilver imported from America. Beſides the rivers Minho, Douro, Tagus, Monda, Lima, and Guadiana, mentioned in Portugal, but which have their ſources in Spain,</p><p>@@@*</p></body></text></TEI>
