            <p>REGICIDE CONTD with six others being imprisoned for life. The ten who were executed at Charing Cross
                or Tyburn, London, in October 1660, were Thomas Harrison, John Jones, Adrian Scrope,
                John Carew, Thomas Scot, and Gregory Clement, who had signed the death-warrant; the
                preacher Hugh Peters; Francis Hacker and Daniel Axtel, who commanded the soldiers at
                the trial and the execution of the king; and John Cook, the solicitor who directed
                the prosecution. In January 1661 the bodies of Cromwell, lreton, ana Bradshaw
                were exhumed and hanged at Tyburn, but Pride’s does not appear to have been treated
                in this way. Of the nineteen or twenty regicides who had escaped and were living
                abroad, three, Sir John Barkstead, John Okey and Miles Corbet, were arrested in
                Holland and executed in London in April 1662; and one, John Lisle, was murdered
                at Lausanne. The last survivor of the regicides was probably Edmund Ludlow, who died
                at Vevey in 1692.</p>
            <p>Ludlow’s <hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi>, edited by C. H. Firth (Oxford, 1894), give
                interesting details about the regicides in exile. See also D. Masson, <hi

            <p>REGILLUS, an ancient lake of Latium, Italy, famous in the legendary histo<hi
                    rend="italic">r</hi>y of Rome as the lake in the neighbourhood of which occu<hi
                    rend="italic">rr</hi>ed (496 b.c.) the battle which finally decided the hegemony
                of Rome in Latium. During the battle, so runs the story, the dictator Postumius
                vowed a temple to Castor and Pollux, who were specially venerated in Tusculum, the
                chief city of the Latins (it being a Roman usage to invoke the aid of the gods of
                the enemy), who appeared during the battle, and b<hi rend="italic">r</hi>ought the
                news of the victo<hi rend="italic">r</hi>y to Rome, watering thei<hi rend="italic"
                    >r</hi> ho<hi rend="italic">r</hi>ses at the sp<hi rend="italic">r</hi>ing of
                Juturna, close to which their temple in the Forum was erected. There can be little
                doubt that the lake actually existed. Of the various identifications proposed,
                the best is that of Nibby, who finds it in a now d<hi rend="italic">r</hi>y c<hi
                    rend="italic">r</hi>ater lake (Pantano Secco), drained by an <hi rend="italic"

                m. N. of Frascati. Along the south bank of the lake, at some 30 or 40 ft. above the
                present bottom, ran the aqueducts of the Aqua Claudia and Anio Novus. Most of the
                other sites p<hi rend="italic">r</hi>oposed are not, as Regillus should be,
                within the limits of the te<hi rend="italic">rr</hi>itory of Tusculum.</p>

            <p>REGIMENT (from Late Latin <hi rend="italic">regimenlum,</hi> rule, <hi rend="italic"
                    >regere,</hi> to rule, govern, direct), originally government, command or
                authority exercised over others, or the office of a ruler or sovereign; in
                this sense the word was common in the 16th century. The most familiar instance is
                the title of the tract of John Knox, the <hi rend="italic">First Blast of the
                    Trumpet against the Monstrous Regiment of Women. </hi>The term as applied to a
                large body of troops dates from the French army of the 16th century. In the first
                instance it implied “ command,” as nowadays we speak of “ General A’s command,”
                meaning the whole number of troops under his command. The early regiments had no
                similarity in strength or organization, except that each was under one
                commander. With the regularization of armies the commands of all such superior
                officers were gradually reduced to uniformity, and a regiment came to be definitely
                a colonel’s command. In the British infantry the term has no tactical significance,
                as the number of battalions in a regiment is variable, and one at least is
                theoretically abroad at all times, while the reserve or territorial battalions serve
                under a different code to that governing the regular battalions. The whole corps of
                Royal Artillery is called “ the Royal Regiment of Artillery.” In the cavalry a
                regiment is tactically as well as administratively a unit of four squadrons. On the
                continent of Europe the regiment of infantry is always together under the command of
                its colonel, and consists of three or four battalions under majors or
                lieutenant-colonels.</p>
            <p>REGINA, the capital city of the province of Saskatchewan, Canada, situated at 104°
                36' W. and 50° 27' N., and 357 m. W. of Winnipeg. Pop. (1907) 9804. After the
                Canadian Pacific railway was completed in 1885, the necessity for a place
                of government on the railway line pressed itself upon the Dominion government. The
                North-West Territories were but little settled then, but a central position on the
                prairies was necessary, where the mounted police might be stationed and where
                the numerous Indian bands might be easily reached. The minister of the interior at
                Ottawa, afterwards Governor Dewdney, chose this spot, and for a number of years
                Regina was the seat of the Territorial government. The governor took up his abode on
                the adjoining plain, and the North-West Council met each year, with a show of
                constitutional government about it. On the formation of the province of Saskatchewan
                in 1905 the choice of capital was left to the first legislature of the province.
                Prince Albert, Moose Jaw and Saskatoon all advanced claims, but Regina was decided
                on as the capital. It probably doubled in population between 1905 and 1907. Its
                public buildings, churches and residences are worthy of a place of greater
                pretensions. It is the centre for a rich agricultural district, and for legislation,
                education, law and other public benefits. It remains the headquarters of the mounted
                police for the western provinces, and near it is an Indian industrial school of
                some note.</p>
            <p>REGINON, or Regino of Prüm, medieval chronicler, was born at Altripp near Spires, and
                was educated in the monastery of Prüm. Here he became a monk, and in 892, just after
                the monastery had been sacked by the Danes, he was chosen abbot. In 899, however, he
                was deprived of this position and he went to Trier, where he was appointed abbot of
                St Martin’s, a house which he reformed. He died in 915, and was buried in the
                abbey of St Maximin at Trier, his tomb being discovered there in 1581.</p>
            <p>Reginon wrote a <hi rend="italic">Chronicon,</hi> dedicated to Adalberon, bishop of
                Augsburg (d. 909), which deals with the history of the world from the commencement
                of the Christian era to 906, especially the history of affairs in Lorraine and the
                neighbourhood. The first book (to 741) consists mainly of extracts from Bede, Paulps
                Diaconus and other writers; of the second book (741-906) the latter part is original
                and valuable, although the chronology is at fault and the author relied chiefly upon
                tradition and hearsay for his information. The work was continued to 967 by a monk
                of Trier, possibly Adalbert, archbishop of Magdeburg (d. 981). The chronicle
                was first published at Mainz in 1521; another edition is in Band I. of the <hi

                    Scriptores</hi> (1826); the best is the one edited by F. Kurze (Hanover, 1890).
                It has been translated into German by W. Wattehbach (Leipzig, 1890). Reginon also
                drew up at the request of his friend and patron Radbod, archbishop of Trier (d.
                915), a collection of canons, <hi rend="italic">Libri duo de Synodalibus causis et
                    disciplinis ecclesiasticis,</hi> dedicated to Hatto I., archbishop of Mainz;
                this is published in Tome 132 of J. P. Migne’s <hi rend="italic">Patrologia
                    Latina.</hi> To Radbod he wrote a letter on music, <hi rend="italic">Epistola de

                of this being to improve the singing in the churches of the diocese. The letter is

            <p>REGIOMONTANUS (1436-1476), German astronomer, was born at Königsberg in Franconia on
                the 6th of June 1436. The son of a miller, his name originally was Johann Müller,
                but he called himself, from his birthplace, Joh. de Monteregio, an appellation Which
                became graduallymodified Into Regiomontanus. At Vienna, from 1452, he was the pupil
                and associate of George Purbach (1423-1461), and they jointly undertook a reform
                of astronomy rendered necessary by the errors they detected in the Alphonsine
                Tables. In this they were much hindered by the lack of correct translations of
                Ptolemy’s works; and in 1462 Regiomontanus accompanied Cardinal Bessarion to
                Italy in search of authentic manuscripts. He rapidly mastered Greek at Rome and
                Ferrara, lectured on Alfraganus at Padua, and completed at Venice in 1463 Purbach’s

                Vemce in 1496), and his own <hi rend="italic">De Triangulis</hi> (Nuremberg, 1533),
                the earliest work treating of trigonometry as a Suhstantive science. A quarrel

                    >Almagest</hi> he had pointed out, obliged him to quit Rome precipitately in
                1468. He repaired to Vienna, and was thence summoned to Buda by Matthias Corvinus,
                king of Hungary, for the purpose of collating Greek manuscripts at a
                handsome salary. He also finished his <hi rend="italic">Tabulae Direclionum</hi>
                (Nuremberg, 1475), essentially an astrological work, but containing a valuable table
