<p><span class="font0">memory with every reproach. H's ſtatues were commanded to be taken down ; and a decree was made, that all his inſeriptions ſhould be eraſed, his name&nbsp;ſtruck out of the regiſters of fame, and his funeral&nbsp;omitted. The people, who now took little part in the&nbsp;affairs of government, looked on his death with indifference ; the ſoldiers alone, whom he had loaded with&nbsp;favours, and enriched by largeſſes, ſincerely regretted&nbsp;their benefactor. The ſenate, therefore, reſolved to&nbsp;provide a ſucceſſor before the army could have an opportunity of taking the appointment upon themſelves ;&nbsp;and Cocceius Nerva was choſen to the empire the very&nbsp;day on which the tyrant was ſlain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Nerva was of an illuſtrious family, as moſt ſay, by birth a Spaniard, and above 65 years old when he was&nbsp;called to the throne. He was, at that time, the&nbsp;moſt remarkable man in Rome, for his virtues, moderation, and reſpect to the laws ; and he owed his exaltation to the blameleſs conduct of his former life.&nbsp;When the ſenate went to pay him their ſubmiſſions, he&nbsp;received them with his accuſtomed humility ; while&nbsp;Arius Antonius, his moſt intimate friend, having embraced him with great familiarity, congratulated him&nbsp;on his acceſſion to the empire : and indeed no emperor&nbsp;had ever ſhewn himſelf more worthy of the throne than&nbsp;Nerva ; his only fault being that he was too indulgent,&nbsp;and often made a prey by his inſidious courtiers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">However, an exceſs of indulgence and humanity were faults that Rome could eaſily pardon, after the&nbsp;cruelties of ſuch an emperor as Domitian. Being long&nbsp;accuſtomed to tyranny, they regarded Nerva’s gentle&nbsp;reign with rapture, and even gave his imbecility the&nbsp;name of benevolence. Upon coming to the throne, he&nbsp;ſolemnly ſwore that no ſenator of Rome ſhould be&nbsp;put to death by his command, during his reign, though&nbsp;they gave ever ſo juſt a cauſe. He conferred great favours, and beſtowed large gifts, upon his particular&nbsp;friends. His liberality was ſo extenſive, that, upon his&nbsp;firſt promotion to the empire, he was conſtrained to ſell&nbsp;his gold and ſilver plate, with his other rich moveables,&nbsp;to enable him to continue his liberalities. He releaſed&nbsp;the cities of the empire from many ſevere impoſitions,&nbsp;which had been laid upon them by Veſpaſian ; took off&nbsp;a rigorous tribute, which had been laid upon carriages;&nbsp;and reſtored thoſe to their property who had been unjuſtly diſpoſſeſſed by Domitian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">During his ſhort reign he made ſeveral good laws. He particularly prohibited the caſtration of male children ; which had been likewiſe condemned by his predeceſſor, but not wholly removed. He put all thoſe&nbsp;ſlaves to death who had, during the laſt reign, informed againſt their maſters. He permitted no ſtatues to&nbsp;be erected to honour him, and converted into money&nbsp;ſuch of Domitian’s as had been ſpared by the ſenate.&nbsp;He ſold many rich robes, and much of the ſplendid&nbsp;furniture of the palace, and retrenched ſeveral unrea-fonable expences at court. At the ſame time, he had&nbsp;ſo little regard for money, that when Herodes Atticus,&nbsp;one of his ſubjects, had found a large treaſure, and&nbsp;wrote to the emperor how to diſpoſe of it, he received&nbsp;for anſwer, that he might </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">uſe it ;</span><span class="font0"> but tire finder ſtill informing the emperor that it was a fortune too large for&nbsp;a private perſon, Nerva, admiring his honeſty, wrote&nbsp;him word, that then he might </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">abuſe it.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a><h4><span class="font1">A hſe of ſuch generoſity and mildneſs was not,</span></h4><div>
<p><span class="font0">however, without its enemies. Calpurnius Craſſiis, with ſome others, formed a dangerous conſpiracy to deſtroy him ; but Nerva would uſe no ſeverity : he reſted&nbsp;ſatisfied with baniſhing thoſe who were culpable, though&nbsp;the ſenate were for inflicting more rigorous puniſhments.&nbsp;But the moſt dangerous inſurrection againſt his intereſts&nbsp;was from the prætorian bands ; who, headed by Caſpa-rius Olianus, inſiſted upon revenging the late emperor’s&nbsp;death, whoſe memory was ſtill dear to them from his&nbsp;frequent liberalities. Nerva, whoſe kindneſs to good&nbsp;men rendered him ſtill more obnoxious to the vicious,&nbsp;did all in his power to ſtop the progreſs of this inſurrection ; he preſented himſelf to the mutinous ſoldiers,&nbsp;and, opening his boſom, deſired them to ſtrike there,&nbsp;rather than be guilty of ſo much injuſtice. The ſoldiers,&nbsp;however, paid no regard to his remonſtrances ; but,&nbsp;ſeizing upon Petronius and Parthenius, flew the n in&nbsp;the moſt ignominious manner. Not content with this,&nbsp;they even compelled the emperor to approve of their&nbsp;ſedition, and to make a ſpeech to-the people, in which&nbsp;he thanked the cohorts ſor their fidelity. So diſagreeable a conſtraint upon the emperor’s inclinations was,&nbsp;in the end, attended with the moſt happy effects, as it&nbsp;cauſed the adoption of Trajan to ſucceed him in the&nbsp;empire. Nerva perceived that in the preſent turbulent&nbsp;diſpoſition of the times, he ſtood in need of an aſſiſtant&nbsp;in the empire, who might ſhare the fatigues of government, and contribute to keep the licentious in awe. For&nbsp;this purpoſe, ſetting aſide all his own relations, he fixed upon Ulpius Trajan, an utter ſtranger to his family,&nbsp;who was then governor in Upper Germany, to ſucceed&nbsp;him. Having put his determination in execution, and&nbsp;performed the accuſtomed ſolemnities, he inſtantly ſent&nbsp;off ambaſſadors to Cologne, where Trajan then reſided,&nbsp;intreating his aſſiſtance in puniſhing thoſe from whom&nbsp;he had received ſuch an inſult The adoption of this&nbsp;admirable man, proved ſo great a curb to the licentiouſneſs of the ſoldiery, that they continued in perfect&nbsp;obedience during the reſt of this reign ; and Caſparius&nbsp;being ſent to him, was, by his command, either baniſhed or put to death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The adopting Trajan was the laſt public act of Nerva. In about three months after, having put him·&nbsp;ſelf in a violent paſſion with one Regulus a ſenator, he&nbsp;was ſeized with a fever, of which he ſhortly after died,&nbsp;after a ſhort reign of one year four months and nine days.&nbsp;He was the firſt foreign emperor who reigned in Rome,&nbsp;and juſtly reputed a prince of great generoſity and moderation. He is alſo celebrated for his wiſdom, though&nbsp;with leſs reaſon, the greateſt inſtance he gave of it, during his reign, being in the choice of his ſucceſſor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Trajan’s family was originally ſrom Italy, but he himſelf was born in Seville in Spain. He very early accompanied his father, who was a general of the Romans, in his expeditions along the Euphrates and the Rhine ; and while yet very young, acquired a conſiderable reputation for military accompliſhments. He&nbsp;enured his body to fatigue ; he made long marches on&nbsp;foot ; and laboured to acquire all that ſkill in war which&nbsp;was neceſſary for a commander. When he was made general of the army in Lower Germany, which was one of&nbsp;the moſt conſiderable employments in the empire, it&nbsp;made no alteration in his manners or way of living ;&nbsp;and the commander was ſeen noway differing from the&nbsp;private tribune, except in his ſuperior wiſdom and vir-</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
