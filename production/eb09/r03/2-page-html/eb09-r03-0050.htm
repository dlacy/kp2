        <p><span class="font1">(6) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Conquest of
                Italy.—</span><span class="font1">Twelve years after the passing of the lex
                Hortensia, King Pyrrhus, beaten at Beneventum,&nbsp;withdrew from Italy, and Rome
                was left mistress of the&nbsp;peninsula. The steps by which this supremacy had
                been&nbsp;won have now to be traced. Under the rule of her Etruscan&nbsp;princes
                Rome spread her sway over the lowlands of Latium,&nbsp;and her arms were a terror to
                the warlike highlanders of the&nbsp;Sabine and Volscian hills. But with their fall
                this miniature empire fell also, and at first it seemed as if the
                infant&nbsp;republic, torn by internal dissensions, must succumb to the&nbsp;foes
                who threatened it from so many sides at once. It&nbsp;was only after one hundred and
                fifty years of almost constant war that Rome succeeded in rolling back the tide
                of&nbsp;invasion and in establishing her supremacy over the neighbouring lowlands
                and over the hill country which bordered&nbsp;them to the east and south. The close
                of this first stage&nbsp;in her external growth is conveniently marked by the
                first&nbsp;collision with the Sabellian peoples beyond the Liris
                    in&nbsp;343.@@<sup>1</sup> In marked contrast with the slowness of her
                advance&nbsp;up to this point is the fact that only seventy-five years&nbsp;more
                were needed for the virtual subjugation of all the&nbsp;rest of the peninsula
                (343-269).</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The expulsion of the Tarquins from Rome, followed as it seems to have
                been by the emancipation from Etruscan&nbsp;supremacy of all the country between the
                Tiber and the&nbsp;Liris, entirely altered the aspect of affairs. North of
                the&nbsp;Tiber the powerful Etruscan city of Veii, after a vain&nbsp;attempt to
                restore the Tarquins, relapsed into an attitude&nbsp;of sullen hostility towards
                Rome, which, down to the&nbsp;outbreak of the final struggle in 407, found vent in
                constant and harassing border forays. The Sabines recommenced their raids across the
                Anio; from their hills to&nbsp;the south-east the Æqui pressed forward as far as
                the&nbsp;eastern spurs of the Alban range, and ravaged the plain&nbsp;country
                between that range and the Sabine mountains;&nbsp;the Volsci overran the coast-lands
                as far as Antium,&nbsp;established themselves at Velitrae, and even ravaged
                the&nbsp;fields within a few miles of Rome. But the good fortune&nbsp;of Rome did
                not leave her to face these foes single-handed, and it is a significant fact that
                the history of the&nbsp;Roman advance begins, not with a brilliant victory,
                but&nbsp;with a useful and timely alliance. According to Livy,&nbsp;it was in 493,
                only a few years after the defeat of the&nbsp;prince of Tusculum at Lake Regillus,
                that a treaty was&nbsp;concluded between Rome and the Latin communities of&nbsp;the
                    Campagna.@@<sup>2</sup> The alliance was in every respect natural.&nbsp;The
                Latins were the near neighbours and kinsmen of the&nbsp;Romans, and both Romans and
                Latins were just freed&nbsp;from Etruscan rule to find themselves as lowlanders
                and&nbsp;dwellers in towns face to face with a common foe in the&nbsp;ruder hill
                tribes on their borders. The exact terms of the&nbsp;treaty cannot, any more than
                the precise circumstances&nbsp;under which it was concluded, be stated with
                certainty&nbsp;(see </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;"
                >Latium),</span><span class="font1"> but two points seem clear. There was
                at&nbsp;first a genuine equality in the relations between the allies.;&nbsp;Romans
                and Latins, though combining for defence and&nbsp;offence, did so without
                sacrificing their separate freedom&nbsp;of action, even in the matter of waging wars
                independently&nbsp;of each other.@@<sup>3</sup> But, secondly, Rome enjoyed from
                the&nbsp;first one inestimable advantage. The Latins lay between&nbsp;her and the
                most active of her foes, the Æqui and Volsci,&nbsp;and served to protect her
                territories at the expense of&nbsp;their own. Behind this barrier Rome grew strong,
                and&nbsp;the close of the -zEciuian and Volscian wars left the Latins</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">her dependents rather than her allies. Beyond the limits of the
                Campagna Rome found a second ally, hardly less&nbsp;useful than the Latins, in the
                tribe of the Hernici (“the&nbsp;men of the rocks ”), in the valley of the Trerus,
                who had&nbsp;equal reason with the Romans and Latins to dread the&nbsp;Volsci and
                Æqui, while their position midway between the&nbsp;two latter peoples made them
                valuable auxiliaries to the&nbsp;lowlanders of the Campagna.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The treaty with the Hernici is said to have been concluded in
                    486,@@<sup>4 </sup>and the confederacy of the three peoples —Romans, Latins, and
                Hernicans—lasted down to the&nbsp;great Latin war in 340. Confused and untrustworthy
                as&nbsp;are the chronicles of the early wars of Rome, it is clear&nbsp;that
                notwithstanding the acquisition of these allies Rome&nbsp;made but little way
                against her foes during the first fifty&nbsp;years of the existence of the republic.
                In 474, it is true,&nbsp;an end was put for a time to the harassing border
                feud&nbsp;with Veii by a forty years’ peace, an advantage due not&nbsp;so much to
                Roman valour as to the increasing dangers&nbsp;from other quarters which were
                threatening the Etruscan&nbsp;states.@@<sup>5</sup> But this partial success stands
            alone, and down&nbsp;to 449 the raids of Sabines, Æqui, and Volsci
                continue&nbsp;without intermission, and are occasionally carried up to&nbsp;the very
                walls of Rome. Very different is the impression&nbsp;left by the annals of the next
                sixty years (449-390).&nbsp;During this period there is an unmistakable
                development&nbsp;of Roman power on all sides.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">In southern Etruria the capture of Veii (396) virtually gave Rome the
                mastery as far as the Ciminian forest.&nbsp;Sutrium and Nepete, “the gates of
                Etruria,” became&nbsp;her allies and guarded her interests against any
                attack&nbsp;from the Etruscan communities to the north, while along&nbsp;the Tiber
                valley her suzerainty was acknowledged as&nbsp;far as Capena and Falerii. On the
                Anio frontier we&nbsp;hear of no disturbances from 449 until some ten
                years&nbsp;after the sack of Rome by the Gauls. In 446 the Æqui&nbsp;appear for the
                last time before the gates of Rome.&nbsp;After 418 they disappear from Mount
                Algidus, and in&nbsp;the same year the communications of Rome and Latium&nbsp;with
                the Hernici in the Trerus valley were secured by&nbsp;the capture and colonization
                of Labicum. Successive&nbsp;invasions, too, broke the strength of the Volsci, and in
                393&nbsp;a Latin colony was founded as far south as Circeii. In&nbsp;part, no doubt,
                these Roman successes were due to the&nbsp;improved condition of affairs in Rome
                itself, consequent&nbsp;upon the great reforms carried between 450 and 442 ;
                but&nbsp;it is equally certain that now as often afterwards fortune&nbsp;befriended
                Rome by weakening, or by diverting the attention of, her opponents. In particular,
                her rapid advance&nbsp;in southern Etruria was facilitated by the heavy
                blows&nbsp;inflicted upon the Etruscans during the 5th century </span><span
                class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1"
                >by Celts, Greeks, and Samnites. By the close of this&nbsp;century the Celts had
                expelled them from the rich&nbsp;plains of what was afterwards known as Cisalpine
                Gaul,&nbsp;and were even threatening to advance across the Apennines into Etruria
                proper. The Sicilian Greeks, headed by&nbsp;the tyrants of Syracuse, wrested from
                them their mastery&nbsp;of the seas, and finally, .on the capture of Capua by
                the&nbsp;Samnites in 423, they lost their possessions in the fertile&nbsp;Campanian
                plain. These conquests of the Samnites were&nbsp;part of a great southward movement
                of the highland&nbsp;Sabellian peoples, the immediate effects of which upon
                the&nbsp;fortunes of Rome were not confined to the weakening of&nbsp;the Etruscan
                power. It is probable that the cessation of&nbsp;the Sabine raids across the Anio
                was partly due to the&nbsp;new outlets which were opened southwards for the
                restless&nbsp;and populous hill tribes which had so long disturbed the&nbsp;peace of
                the Latin lowlands. We may conjecture, also,</span></p>
