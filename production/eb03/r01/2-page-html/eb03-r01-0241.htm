You need only compare them with ſome of theſe, to be convinced that the drinker of wine excels the drinker of beer and water,&nbsp;both in body and mind, and that the inhabitant of the&nbsp;ſouth is much ſſouter than he who lives in the north ;&nbsp;for though the wine drinker may not have quite as&nbsp;much fleſh as he who drinks only beer, he has better&nbsp;blood, and can bear much more work. Tacitus had&nbsp;already obſerved this, in his treatiſe </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">De moribus Germanorum.</span><span class="font1"> “ The large and corpulent bodies of the Germans (ſays he) have a great appearance, but are not&nbsp;made to laſt.” At that time almoſt all the Germans&nbsp;drank only water ; but the mere drinking of wine has&nbsp;effected a revolution in ſeveral parts of Germany, which&nbsp;makes the preſent inhabitants of theſe countries very&nbsp;different from thoſe deſcribed by Tacitus. Black and&nbsp;brown hair is much commoner here than the white,&nbsp;which made the Germans ſo famous in old Rome. “ It&nbsp;wili be eaſily imagined (ſays Baron Reiſheck), that the&nbsp;monks fare particularly well in fo rich a country, we&nbsp;made a viſit to the prelate of Erbach. Theſe lordly&nbsp;monks, for ſo in every reſpect they are, have an excellent hunt, rooms magnificently furniſhed, billiard tables, half a dozen beautiful ſinging women, and a ſtu-pendous wine cellar, the well ranged batteries of&nbsp;which made me ſhudder. A monk, who ſaw my aſto-niſhment at the number of the caſks, affured me, that,&nbsp;without the benign influence which flowed from them,&nbsp;it would be totally impoffible for the cloiſter to ſubſiſt&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font1">fo damp a ſituation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RHINFELS, a caſtle of Germany, in the circle oſ the Lower Rhine, in a county of the ſame name.&nbsp;It is looked upon as one of the moſt important places&nbsp;ſeated on the Rhine, as well in regard to its ſtrength&nbsp;as ſituation. It is near St Goar, and built on a craggy&nbsp;rock. This fortrefs commands the whole breadth of&nbsp;the Rhine, and thoſe who paſs are always obliged to&nbsp;pay a conſiderable toll. In the time of war it is of&nbsp;great importance to be maſters of this place. E. Long.&nbsp;7. 43. N. Lat. 50. 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RHINLAND, a name given to a part of South Holland, which lies on both ſides the Rhine, and of&nbsp;which Leyden is the capital town.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RHINOCEROS, in zoology, a genus of quadrupeds belonging to the order of belluæ. The name is entirely Greek ; but theſe animals were totally unknown&nbsp;to the ancient Greeks. Ariſtotle takes no notice of&nbsp;them, nor any other Greek writer till Strabo, nor&nbsp;Roman till Pliny. It is probable they did not frequent&nbsp;that part of India into which Alexander had penetrated,&nbsp;ſince it was near 300 years after that Pompey brought&nbsp;them to Europe. From this time till the days of&nbsp;Heliogabalus, the rhinoceros was frequently exhibited&nbsp;in the Roman ſpectacles ; and he has often been transported into Europe in more modern times ; but they&nbsp;were long very ill repreſented, and very imperfectly de-ſcribed, till ſome that arrived in London in 1739 and&nbsp;1741 were inſpected, by which the errors and caprices&nbsp;of former writers were detected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Ί here are two ſpecies of rhinoceros, the ſirſt of which is the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">unicornis,</span><span class="font1"> the length of which, Buffon&nbsp;tells us, from the extremity of the muzzle to the origin of the tail, is at leaſt 12 ſeet, and the circumference of the body is nearly the ſame. &quot; The rhinoceros which came to London in the year 1739 was ſent&nbsp;from Bengal. Though not above two years of age,&nbsp;the expence of his food and journey amounted to near&nbsp;L. 1000 Sterling. He was fed with rice, ſugar, and&nbsp;hay. He had daily ſeven pounds of rice, mixed with&nbsp;three pounds of ſugar, and divided into three portions.&nbsp;He had likewife hay and green herbs, which laſt he&nbsp;preferred to hay. His drink was water, of which he&nbsp;took large quantities at a time @@(A). He was of a&nbsp;peaceable diſpoſition, and allowed all parts of his body&nbsp;to be touched, when hungry, or ſtruck by any per-ſon, he became miſehievous, and in both caſes nothing&nbsp;appeaſed him but food, when enraged, he ſprung forward, and nimbly raiſed himſelf to a great height,&nbsp;puſhing at the ſame time his head ſuriouily againſt the&nbsp;walls, which he performed with amazing quickneſs, notwithſtanding his heavy aſpect and unwieldy maſs. I often obſerved, ſays Dr Parſons, theſe movements produced by rage or impatience, eſpecially in the mornings&nbsp;before his rice and ſugar were brought to him. The&nbsp;vivacity and promptitude of his movements, Dr Parſons adds, led me to think, that he is altogether unconquerable, and that he could eaſily overtake any man&nbsp;who ſhould offend him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&quot; This rhinoceros, at the age of two years, was not taller than a young cow that has never produced. But&nbsp;his body was very long and very thick. His head was&nbsp;diſproportionally large. From the ears to the horn there&nbsp;is a concavity, the two extremities of which, namely&nbsp;the upper end of the muzzle, and the part near the&nbsp;ears, are conſiderably raiſed. The horn, which was&nbsp;not yet above an'inch high, was black, ſmooth at thc&nbsp;top, but full of wrinkles directed backward at the baſe.&nbsp;The noſtrils are ſituated very low, being not above an&nbsp;inch diſtant from the opening of the mouth. The under lip is pretty ſimilar to that of the ox ; but the&nbsp;upper lip has a greater reſemblance to that of the&nbsp;hoiſe, with this advantageous difference, that the rhinoceros can lengthen this lip, move it from ſide to fide,&nbsp;roll it about a ſtaſſ, and ſeize with it any object he&nbsp;wiſhes to carry to liis mouth. Tlie tongue of tliis&nbsp;young rhinoceros was ſoft, like that of a calf. His eyes&nbsp;had no vivacity : In figure they reſembled thoſe of tlie&nbsp;hog, and were ſituated lower, or nearer the noſtrils,&nbsp;than in any other quadruped. His ears are large, thin&nbsp;at the extremities, and contracted at their origin by a&nbsp;kind of annular rugoſity. I'he neck is very ſhort, and&nbsp;ſurronnded with two large folds of ſkin. The ſhoulders&nbsp;aie very thick, and at their juncture there is another&nbsp;fold oſ ſkin, whieh deſeends upon the fore legs. The&nbsp;body of this young rhinoceros was very thick, and&nbsp;pretty much reſembled that oſ a cow about to bring&nbsp;ſorth. Between the body and crupper there is another&nbsp;fold, which deſeends upon the hind legs, Laſtly, another fold tranfverfely ſurrounds the inferior part&nbsp;of the crupper, at ſome diſtance from the tail. The&nbsp;belly was large, and hung near the ground, particularly&nbsp;its middle part. The legs are round, thick, ſtrong, and</span></p><div>
