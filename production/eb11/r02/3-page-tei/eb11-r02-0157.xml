Thc M. triangularis sterni, which arises from the back or thoracic aspect of the sternum and lower costal cartilages and is inserted into the costal cartilages higher up, can obviously depress thc ribs. So also can the M. serratus posticus inferior, which arises from the thick fascia of the loins and is inserted into the last four ribs. So also can the M. quadrat us lumborum, which springs from the pelvis and is attached to the last rib. Indeed there is hardly a muscle of the body but may bc called into play during extremely laboured respiration, either because it acts on the chest, or because it serves to steady some part and give a better purchase for the action of direct respiratory muscles.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Certain Abnormal Forms of Respiration.</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">Coughing.—</hi>There is first a deep inspiration followed by closure of the glottis.

G.*).</p><p>(4) Pathology of the Respiratory System</p><p>In the following article we have to give an account of the more important pathological processes which affect the lungs, pleurae and bronchial tubes. In the aetiology of pulmonary affections, the relations between the lungs and the external air, and also between them and the circulatory system, are important. The lungs are, so to speak, placed between the right and left cavities of the heart, and the only way for the blood to pass from the right ventricle to the left side of the heart, except in cases of a patent foramen ovale or other congenital defect forming a communication between the two sides of the organ, is by passing through them. The result is that not only may they become diseased by foreign material carried into them by the blood, but any obstruction to the flow of blood through the left side of the heart tends sooner or later to engorge or congest them, and lead to further changes. Through the nose and mouth they are in direct connexion with the external atmosphere. Hence the variable condition of the air as regards temperature, degree of moisture, and density, is liable to produce directly various changes in thc lungs, or to predispose them to disease; and the contamination of thc air with various pathogenic germs and irritating particles in thc shape <hi rend="bold">of </hi>dust, is a direct source of many lung affections.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Bronchitis,</hi>  or inflammation of thc mucous membrane of the bronchial tubes, has been generally attributed to exposure to atmospheric changes. It occurs with great frequence in the extremes of life, and it is in early childhood and in old age that it is more liable to be fatal. Bronchitis may often follow exposure to cold, but that low temperature in itself is not sufficient to cause it is shown by the fact that the crews of arctic expeditions have been singularly free from diseases usually attributed to cold, but on their return to moist germ-laden atmospheres have at once been affected. Children reared in heated rooms with lack of ventilation are peculiarly susceptible to attacks on the slightest change of temperature. Bronchitis is also frequently caused by cardiac and renal diseases, and by the extension of inflammatory diseases of the upper air passages (as rhinitis, laryngitis or pharyngitis), while blockage of the nasal passages by adenoid or other growths may, by causing persistent mouth-breathing, lead to bronchial infection. Before the bacterial origin of disease was understood, bronchitis was attributed solely to what is termed “ catching cold, ” and thc exact relation of thc chill to the bacterial infection is still unknown. It is probable that thc chilling of the surface of the body by exposure causes congestion of the muçous membrane, the presence of a virulent micro-organism being then all that is required to produce bronchitis. It is generally accepted that in persons living in the pure air of the country the small bronchi and air-cells are sterile (Barthel in the <hi rend="italic">Zcntralblatt fur Bakteriologie,</hi>  vol. xxiv.). Bacteria are arrested on their way by the leucocytes of the nasal mucous membrane and by the vibration of the ciliated epithelium of the upper air passages. The mucous membrane of the upper bronchi is, however, tenanted by various micro-organisms such as the diplo-bacillus of Friedländer, bacillus coli communis, micrococcus tetragenus, &amp;c., and it is considered by William Ewart that these organisms may in certain conditions of their host become virulent. “ Specific ” bronchitis occurs in the course of a specific infective disease <hi rend="italic">(e.g.</hi>  influenza, measles or whooping cough) and is due to the specific micro-organism gaining access by the mucous membrane of the respiratory tract. Cases have been known in which the diphtheria bacillus has been so localized. In glanders, small-pox, syphilis and pemphigus, the infective micro-organism is carried to the bronchi by the blood stream. In common or “ nonspecific” bronchitis, streptococci, pneumococci and staphylococci are found in the sputum together with Friedländer’s bacillus and the bacillus coli communis. Microscopically the bronchi show hyperaemia of the mucous and submucous coats, and the whole wall becomes infiltrated with polymorphonuclear leucocytes and round cells. Many cells undergo mucoid degeneration, and there is abundant epithelial proliferation. A large quantity of mucus is secreted by the glands, and the lumen of the bronchi contains an exudate consisting of mucus, degenerated leucocytes and cast-off epithelial cells.</p><p>In the rare form of bronchitis known as fibrinous or plastic bronchitis a membranous exudate is formed which forms casts of the bronchi, which may be coughed up. The casts vary from an inch to six or seven inches in length, with branches corresponding to the divisions of the bronchi from which they come. The cast consists of mucus and fibrin in varying proportions. The exact pathology of this variety is still undetermined.</p><p>Bronchitis may affect the whole bronchial tract, or more especially the larger or the smaller tubes. It may occur as an acute or as a chronic affection. In the acute form the inflammation may remain limited to thc bronchial tubes and gradually subside, or it may lead to inflammation of thc surrounding lung tissue, giving rise to disseminated foci of inflammation of greater or less extent throughout the lungs (catarrhal or bronchopneumonia). This is a common complication <hi rend="bold">of </hi>bronchitis, especially where the smaller tubes are affected, and is more</p><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
