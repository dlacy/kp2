<p><span class="font0">for the purpose of facilitating the removal of the bar and for sheltering vessels entering the river, and were originally designed&nbsp;to terminate in a depth of 13 feet at low water ; but eventually a&nbsp;larger scheme was adopted for forming a refuge harbour in combination with the improvement of the river, and the piers, which&nbsp;are still in progress, are to extend into a depth of 30 feet. In&nbsp;1861 extensive dredging operations were commenced for improving&nbsp;the depth of the river, and a maximum of 3,515,000 cubic yards&nbsp;was removed in 1866 ; the work has been regularly continued, and&nbsp;the total amount dredged since the commencement, in 1838, reached&nbsp;49,668,000 cubic yards in 1884, being an average of nearly 2,000,000&nbsp;cubic yards annually since 1861, when systematic dredging operations&nbsp;were begun. The improvement in depth that was effected between&nbsp;1860 and 1884 is shown on the longitudinal section of the river&nbsp;(fig. 9) ; and the deepening of the river between Newcastle and&nbsp;Hedwin Streams, a distance of 8⅛ miles, is in progress, being carried&nbsp;on by six dredgers. The river has also been regulated by making&nbsp;a straight cut across Lemington Point, and widening the channel&nbsp;from 150 feet to 400 feet opposite Blaydon ; the obstruction offered&nbsp;to the Tyne by the old Newcastle Bridge has been removed by&nbsp;rebuilding the bridge with larger openings ; and a sharp bend in&nbsp;the river has been eased by removing the high projecting rock&nbsp;at Bill Point (fig. 8). The tidal capacity of the. river lias been increased by 14,000,000 cubic yards; the bar has been lowered 14&nbsp;feet since 1860 ; and the least depth at low water up to Newcastle&nbsp;is 20 feet, and 18 feet for 3 miles above. The deepening of the&nbsp;channel has produced a very beneficial lowering of the flood line in&nbsp;the river, thereby preserving the adjacent lands from inundation.@@<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>The improvement of the river has led to a great increase in the&nbsp;tonnage of the vessels frequenting it, and a large development of&nbsp;its trade. The average tonnage of the vessels, which was 163 tons&nbsp;in 1863, had risen to 396 tons in 1883 ; and the total tonnage of&nbsp;the vessels entering and clearing the Tyne ports rose from&nbsp;4,382,000 tons in 1863 to 13,043,000 tons in 1883.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">River Clyde Improvement Works.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Clyde is a small river, with a drainage area of only 945 square miles, and a tidal flow of about 20 miles ; it opens, however,&nbsp;into a deep well-sheltered estuary, or arm of the sea, called the Firth&nbsp;of Clyde, and is free from a bar. The rise of spring tides at its&nbsp;mouth is about 10 feet. The Clyde was by nature an insignificant&nbsp;stream, with numerous hard gravel shoals, and a ford 12 miles&nbsp;below Glasgow which could be crossed on foot. The regulation of&nbsp;the river by cross jetties, and the removal of hard shoals, was&nbsp;commenced in 1773. Early in the present century the jetties were&nbsp;made more uniform, others were added, and their ends were&nbsp;eventually connected by low training walls which were gradually&nbsp;raised as deposits formed behind. The river had to be subsequently&nbsp;widened to accommodate the increasing trade and a larger size of&nbsp;vessels. As scour alone could only produce a very moderate depth,&nbsp;systematic dredging operations were commenced in 1844, and&nbsp;reached a total of 28,648,000 cubic yards by the middle of 1884,&nbsp;the maximum accomplished in a single year (1878-79) reaching&nbsp;1,502,000 cubic yards. Dredging is - still being continued with six&nbsp;dredgers in order to maintain as well as deepen the river ; for the&nbsp;channel up to Glasgow has been deepened so far beyond its natural&nbsp;limit that any matter in suspension which enters the river is&nbsp;readily deposited. Of the 1,041,000 cubic yards dredged in 1883-84,&nbsp;as much as 703,000 cubic yards consisted of deposit, or more than&nbsp;two-thirds of the whole quantity removed. The river has a depth&nbsp;of 24 feet at high water from Glasgow to Port Glasgow, and from 13&nbsp;to 15 feet at low water. The tide falls 8 feet lower at Glasgow&nbsp;than it did before any works were begun, which not merely adds&nbsp;to the tidal capacity of the river, but also prevents the fresh-water&nbsp;floods which formerly inundated the low-lying portions of Glasgow.&nbsp;The improved depth has caused the average tonnage of the vessels&nbsp;frequenting the port of Glasgow to rise from 199 tons in 1863 to&nbsp;315 tons in 1883 ; whilst the total tonnage entered and cleared has&nbsp;increased from 1,757,000 tons in 1863 to 5,544,000 tons in 1883.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">River Tees Improvement Works.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Tees was formerly a very irregular winding river between Stockton and Middlesborough, and after passing that town it opens&nbsp;out into a wide sandy, estuary about 6 miles long and 3 miles across&nbsp;at its widest part. It is tidal for about 17 miles, and the rise of&nbsp;spring tides at its mouth is 15 feet. The improvement of the river&nbsp;between Stockton and the estuary was commenced in 1810 by&nbsp;making a straight cut near Stockton ; another cut was made in&nbsp;1830, and the river was also regulated by cross jetties. These&nbsp;works provided a more direct channel, and increased the depth by&nbsp;about from 2 to 5 feet. The channel, however, between the jetties&nbsp;was irregular in depth ; and the navigable channel through the&nbsp;estuary was shallow and variable, with a rocky shoal across it, and&nbsp;a bar at the mouth of the river. Accordingly, in 1853 training&nbsp;walls were commenced, both for connecting the ends of the cross&nbsp;jetties, and also for guiding the channel through the estuary.&nbsp;Dredging was commenced in 1854 for removing shoals and deepening the channel ; and the ridge of rock across the estuary channel&nbsp;has been removed by blasting. The total amount dredged up to&nbsp;Oct. 31, 1884, reached 13,145,000 cubic yards, and a maximum of&nbsp;1,220,000 cubic yards was dredged in 1883-84. Vessels of 3000 tons,&nbsp;drawing 21 feet of water, can leave Middlesborough fully laden ;&nbsp;the average tonnage of vessels frequenting the Tees has risen&nbsp;from 169 tons in 1873 to 303 tons in 1883; and the total tonnage entered and cleared has increased from 1,212,000 tons in 1873&nbsp;to 2,528,000 tons in 1883. It is proposed at present to deepen the&nbsp;channel by dredging, so as to obtain a depth at low water of 12&nbsp;feet up to Middlesborough, and 10 feet from thence up to Stock-ton ; and it is hoped that eventually 2 feet additional depth&nbsp;may be attained by the same means. Two breakwaters have been&nbsp;designed, starting from opposite sides of the estuary and converging over the bar, in order to protect the entrance, to facilitate&nbsp;dredging, and to keep out drifting sand. The southern breakwater has been completed, and the northern breakwater is in progress. The breakwaters and the training walls are constructed of&nbsp;slag obtained free of charge from the neighbouring iron-works.</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;">

<p><span class="font0">Training Walls on the Tidal Seine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Seine has a very winding course between Rouen and the sea, as well as in its upper portion, but it possesses a good natural&nbsp;depth between Rouen and La Mailleraye, a distance of about 37&nbsp;miles. Below this point, however, the natural condition of the&nbsp;river was very unsatisfactory, for the channel through the estuary&nbsp;was constantly shifting, and high shoals existed at Aizier and&nbsp;Villequier with a depth over them of only 10 feet at spring tides,&nbsp;so that vessels of from 100 to 200 tons found the passage difficult,&nbsp;and even dangerous at times. Training walls, formed of mounds&nbsp;of chalk obtained from the neighbouring cliffs, were commenced&nbsp;in 1848, and were gradually extended along both sides of the&nbsp;channel, as shown in fig. 10<sub>i</sub> and were terminated at Berville&nbsp;in 1869, a further extension of the northern wall for lj miles&nbsp;having been refused in 1870 for fear of endangering Havre. These&nbsp;works have effected a remarkable increase in depth in the channel&nbsp;between the λvalls, as shown by a comparison of the longitudinal sections of the river in 1824 and 1875 (fig. 11); for&nbsp;dredging has only been used for deepening the worst shoals.&nbsp;The improvement, however, ceases beyond the termination of the&nbsp;works ; and the channel between Berville and the sea is still&nbsp;changeable and shallow. High walls were for the most part&nbsp;adopted down to Tancarville on the right bank and to La Roque&nbsp;on the left bank. These walls, however, produced such rapid&nbsp;accretion behind them that low walls, raised only from 3 to 5 feet&nbsp;above low water of spring tides, w<sup>,</sup>ere adopted below these points.&nbsp;This precaution, however, has not arrested the accretion in the&nbsp;estuary, which is still proceeding, though sixteen years have elapsed&nbsp;since the works were stopped. The accretion resulting from the&nbsp;training works had reduced the tidal capacity of the estuary by&nbsp;274,000,000 cubic yards in 1875 ; and a survey in 1880 showed&nbsp;that a still further loss of over 40,000,000 cubic yards had occurred&nbsp;between 1875 and 1880. More than 28,000 acres of land have&nbsp;been reclaimed in the upper part of the estuary, as shown by&nbsp;cross lines on the plan; whilst large tracts have been raised to&nbsp;high-water level, as indicated by dotted lines, extending as much&nbsp;as 8⅜ miles below the ends of the training walls. The walls were&nbsp;originally merely rubble chalk mounds ; but the bore and the&nbsp;currents injured the mounds, so that the walls are being strengthened by pitching or concrete on the river slope, with an apron&nbsp;of concrete, and piling at the toe (fig. 12). The regulation of the&nbsp;river, by bringing deep water about 25 miles nearer the sea,&nbsp;enables vessels of about 2000 tons, and drawing about 20 feet, to&nbsp;pass the shallow estuary between the sea and Berville at high tide&nbsp;and thus reach Rouen. The prolongation of the training walls has&nbsp;been frequently urged ; but the fear of injuring Havre, and the&nbsp;difficulty of devising a suitable channel which would effectually&nbsp;serve both Honfleur and Havre on opposite sides of the estuary,&nbsp;have hitherto prevented the continuation of the work. The&nbsp;Tancarville Canal is in progress for connecting Havre with the&nbsp;Seine at Tancarville (fig. 10), so as to enable river craft to avoid&nbsp;the dangers of the lower estuary ; and the canal is being made&nbsp;so as to be capable of being readily converted into a ship-canal&nbsp;if the growing accretions should impede access between Berville&nbsp;and the sea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Works at the Mouth of the Maas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Scheur branch of the Maas, which forms the most direct channel to Rotterdam, gradually silted up at its outlet, so that&nbsp;vessels had to seek more southern and circuitous channels. The&nbsp;length of the deepest channel was shortened in 1829 by the&nbsp;construction of the Voorne Canal, but even this course became&nbsp;inadequate for the increasing draught of vessels. Accordingly, in&nbsp;1862 works were commenced for providing a new direct outlet for&nbsp;the Scheur branch of the river by a straight cut across the Hook of&nbsp;Holland, with fascine-work jetties for training and maintaining</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
