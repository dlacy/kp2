                <p><label>R</label> was written in Greek originally as P, following the Phoenician form ;
                    sometimes, however, a triangle takes the place of the semicircle ; not
                    unfrequently also a short stroke appears where we have the lower limb on the
                    right hand ; the reason of this addition is not plain : it can hardly have been
                    a diacritical mark to distinguish R from P (as G from C at Rome) because the
                    latter symbol in Greece always kept its two vertical lines (Γ), the curved
                    line (P) appearing first in the Roman alphabet.</p>
                <p>The sounds denoted by the same symbol <hi rend="italic">r</hi> differ
                    considerably. First, there is the true consonantal <hi rend="italic">r—</hi>our
                    English <hi rend="italic">r</hi> in <hi rend="italic">reed,</hi>
                    &amp;c.—produced by raising the tip only of the tongue towards the front palate
                    ; the voice escapes by this aperture, the side passages between the tongue
                    and the palate being closed ; the mechanism, therefore, is just the opposite to
                    that which produces <hi rend="italic">l</hi> (see letter L). Secondly, there is
                    the vowel <hi rend="italic">r</hi> ; this is due to the space between the tip of
                    the tongue and the palate being sufficiently great to allow the voice to escape
                    without any friction ; the difference betλveen this and consonantal <hi
                        rend="italic">r</hi> is parallel to that between <hi rend="italic">u</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">w,</hi> or between <hi rend="italic">i</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">y.</hi> This vowel-sound, though not heard regularly in any
                    modern language, is not unfrequent in several in certain combinations; for
                    example, it is quite possible to articulate “father” as “fath-r,” where the <hi
                        rend="italic">r</hi> alone forms a syllable and is therefore vocalic. This
                    vowel-sound was a regular sound in Sanskrit, and was probably also heard in the
                    parent language ; but in the derived languages (except Sanskrit) it
                    became consonantal <hi rend="italic">r</hi> with an independent vowel preceding
                    or following; thus a presumed original “krd” ( = heart), where r denotes the
                    vocalic r, gave in Sanskrit “hrd,” in Greek <hi rend="italic">κpaδdη,</hi> in
                    Latin “ cor(d).” Thirdly, <hi rend="italic">r</hi> may denote a trill,—that is
                    to say, a sound produced by the vibration of the tongue when laid loosely
                    against the palate and set in motion by a strong current of breath or voice.
                    When the point of the tongue is laid loosely in this way against the palate just
                    behind the gums and made to trill as voice passes over it, we hear the Scotch
                    and the French <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> each of which is a trill, not a
                    consonantal <hi rend="italic">r.</hi> The same sound, but unvoiced, is heard in
                    the French “ théâtre,” &amp;c., and is also the Welsh rA. A similar trill at the
                    back part of the palate gives the Northumbrian “burr.”</p>
