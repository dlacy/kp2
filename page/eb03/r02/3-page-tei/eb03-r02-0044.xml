This correction or its cauſe, in the mechaniſm of thoſe internal motions, is generally called Contraction by the writers on hydraulics; and it is not confined to a hole in a thin plate : it happens in ſome degree in all caſes where fluids are made to paſs through narrow places.</p><p>It happens in the entry into all pipes, canals, and ſluices ; nay even in the paſſage of water over the edge of a board, ſuch as is uſually ſet up on the head of a dam or weir, and even when this is immer-ſed in water on both ſides, as in a bar or keep, frequently employed ſor raiſing the waters of the level ſtreams in Flanders, in order to render them navigable. We mentioned an obſervation $ of Mr Buat to this effect, when he ſaw a gooſherry rife up from the bottom of the canal along the face of the bar, and then rapidly fly over its top. We have attempted to repreſent this motion of the filaments in theſe different fιtuation6. Fig. 5. A ſhows the motion through a thin plate.</p><p>B ſhows the motion when a tube of about two diameters long is added, and when the water flows with a full .mouth. This does not always happen in ſo ſhort a pipe (and never in one that is ſhorter), but the water frequently detaches itſelf from the ſides of the pipe, and flows with a contracted jet.</p><p>C ſhows the motion when the pipe projects into the inſide of the veſſel. In this caſe it is difficult to make it flow full.</p><p>D repreſents a mouth-piece fitted to the hole, and formed agreeably to that ſhape which a jet would aſ-ſume of itſelf. In this caſe all contraction is avoided, becauſe the mouth of this pipe may be conſidered as the real orifice, and nothing now diminiſhes the diſcharge but a trifling friction of the ſides.</p><p>E ſhows the motion of water over a dam or weir, where the fall is free or unobſtructed ; the ſurface of the lower ſtream being lower than the edge or ſole of the waſte-board.</p><p>F is a ſimilar repreſentation of the motion of water over what we would call a <hi rend="italic">bar</hi>  or <hi rend="italic">keep.</hi></p><p>It was one great aim of the experiments of Michelotti and Boffut to determine the effects of contraction in theſe caſes. Michelotti, after carefully obſerving the ,form and :dimenſions of the natural jet, made various mouth-pieces reſembling it, till he obtained one which produced the ſmalleſt diminution of the computed diſcharge, or till the diſcharge computed for the area of its ſmaller end approached the neareſt to the effective diſcharge. And he at laſt obtained one which gave a diſcharge of 983, when the natural diſcharge would have been 1000. This piece was formed by the revolution of a trochoid round the axis of the jet, and the dimenſions were as follow :</p><p>Diameter of the outer orifice    = 36</p><p>---inner orifice    = 46</p><p>Length of the axis    ≈ 96</p><p>The reſults of the experiments of the Abbé Boſſiit and of Michelotti ſcarcely differ, and they are expreſ-<hi rend="sub">;</hi>ſed in the following table 4</p><lb/><table><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>N or the natural expence</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>30000=</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>0.27,78√A</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>Q_for the thin plate fig.

Tſhe contraction there is nearly the ſame with that at the edge of a thin plate. But this could not be introduced into this table, becauſe its effect on the expence is the ſame in quantity whatever is the length of the waſte-board of the weir.</p><p>In like manner, the diminution of diſcharge through a ſluice could not be expreſſed here. When a ſluice is drawn up, but its lower edge ſtill remains under water, the diſcharge is contracted both above and at the ſides, and the diminution of diſcharge by each is in proportion to its extent. It is not eaſy to reduce either of theſe contractions to computation, but they may be very eaſily obſerved. We frequently can obſerve the water, at coming out of a ſluice into a mill-courſe, quit the edge of the aperture, and ſhow a part of the bottom quite dry. This is always the caſe when the velocity of efflux is conſiderable. When it is very moderate, this place is occupied by an eddy water almoſt ſtagnant. When the head of water is 8 or ϊθ inches, and runs off freely, the ſpace left between it and the ſides is about 14- inches. If the ſides of the entry have a ſlope, this void ſpace can never appear ; but there is always this t endency to convergence, which diminiſhes the quantity of the diſcharge.</p><p>It will frequently abridge computation very much to conſider the water diſcharged in theſe different ſituations as moving with a common velocity, which we con ceive as produced not by a fall from the ſurface of the fluid (which is exact only when the expence is equal to the natural expence), but by a fall <hi rend="italic">h</hi>  accommodated to the diſcharge r or it is convenient to know the height which would produce that very velocity which the water iſſues with in theſe ſituations.</p><p>And alſo, when the water is obſerved to be actually moving with a velocity V, and we know whether it is coming through a thin plate, through a tube, over a dam, &amp;c. it is neceſſary to know the preſſure or head of water <hi rend="italic">h</hi>  which has actually produced this velocity. It is convenient therefore to have the following numbers in readineſs.</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
