This ſeaſoning, unleſs they live very temperately, or are in a proper habit of body (tho' ſome people are unmoleſted for many months), ſeldom ſuffers them to remain long before it makes its appearance in ſome mode or other; particularly if at firſt they expoſe themſelves in a ſhower of rain, or too long in the ſun, or in the night-air; or when the body is much heated, if they drink large draughts of cold liquors, br bathe in cold water; or uſe much exerciſe; or commit exceſs in drinking wine or ſpirits; or by heating the body and inflaming the blood; or by ſubjecting themſelves to any cauſe that may ſuddenly check perſpiration, which at firſt is generally exceſſive.</p><p>Some people, from a favourable ſtate of body, have no ſeaſoning. Thin people, and very young people, are moſt likely to eſcape it. Women generally do from their temperance, and perhaps their menſtruation contributes to their ſecurity; indeed hot climates are favourable to the delicacy of their habits, and ſuitable to their modes of life. Some eſcape by great regularity of living; ſome, by the breaking out of the raſh, called the <hi rend="italic">prickly heat;</hi> ſome by a great degree of perſpiration; and ſome by obſervſing a cooling regimen. The disorders are various that conſtitute this ſeaſoning of <hi rend="italic">new-comers</hi> as they are called; depending on age, conſtitution, and habit of body. But all ſeaſoning diieaſes are of the inflammatory kind; and yield to antiphlogiſtic treatment proportioned to their violence. When all precaution to guard againſt ſickneſs has failed, and prudence proved abortive to new-comers, they will have this comfort at leaſt for their pains, that their diſorders will ſeldom be ſevere or expenſive, and will generally have a ſpeedy termination; and that their ſeaſoning, as it is emphatically called, will be removed by bleeding, a doſe of ſalts, reſt, and a cooling regimen.</p><p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Seasoning</hi> <hi rend="italic">of Timber.</hi> See <hi rend="smallcaps">Timber.</hi></p></div></body></text></TEI>
