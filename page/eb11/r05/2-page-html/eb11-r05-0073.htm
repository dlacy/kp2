<p><span class="font2">72-5°; autumn, 65°; winter, 27*5°. For about 155 days in each year, Rumania suffers from the bitter north-cast wind </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(¿rivets)&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">which sweeps over south Russia; while a scorching west or southwest wind </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(austru)</span><span class="font2"> blows for about 126 days. Little snow falls in&nbsp;the plains, but among the mountains it may lie for five months.&nbsp;The frosts are severe, the Danube being often icebound for three&nbsp;months. The rainfall, which is heaviest in summer, averages&nbsp;about 15-20 in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Fauna.—</span><span class="font2">In its fauna, Walachia has far more affinity to the lands lying south of the Danube than to Transylvania, although several&nbsp;species of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Claudilia,</span><span class="font2"> once regarded as exclusively Transylvanian,&nbsp;are found south of the Carpathians. Moldavia and the Baragan&nbsp;Steppe resemble the Russian prairies in their variety of molluscs&nbsp;ana the lower kinds df mammals. Over 40 species of freshwater&nbsp;mussels (Unionidae) have been observed in the Rumanian rivers.&nbsp;The lakes of the Dobrudja likewise abound in molluscs; parent&nbsp;forms, in many cases, of species which reappear, greatly modified,&nbsp;in the Black Sea. Insect life is somewhat less remarkable; but&nbsp;besides a distinctive genus of Orthoptera </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Jaquctia Hospodar),&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">there are several kinds of weevils (Curculionidae) said to be peculiar&nbsp;to Rumania. Birds are veiy numerous, including no fewer than&nbsp;4 varieties of crows, 5 of warblers, 7 of woodpeckers, 8 of buntings,&nbsp;4 </span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font2">falcons, and 5 of eagles; while among the hosts of waterfowl&nbsp;which people the marshes of the Danube are 9 varieties of ducks,&nbsp;and 4 of rails. Roe-deer, foxes and wolves find shelter in the&nbsp;forests, where bears, are not uncommon; and chamois frequent&nbsp;the loftiest and most inaccessible peaks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Minerals.—</span><span class="font2">The mineral wealth of Rumania lies chiefly in the mountains. Petroleum, salt, lignite and brown coal are largely&nbsp;worked. Deposits of rock-salt, a valuable government monopoly,&nbsp;stretch from the department of Suceava in northern Moldavia to&nbsp;that of Gorjiu in Walachia, and are mined in the departments of&nbsp;Bacau, Prahova and R&amp;mnicu S&amp;rat. The presence of petroleum,&nbsp;indicated by many ancient workings in the shape of shallow hand-dug wells, can be traced continuously at the foot of the Transylvanian. Alps, from Turnu Sevcrin into Bukovina. Rumans claim&nbsp;for their product a higher percentage of pure oil than is found in&nbsp;the American, Galician and Caucasian wells; and, although American competition nearly destroyed this industry between 1873 and&nbsp;1895» improved methods and legislation favouring the introduction&nbsp;of foreign capital enabled it to recover. At the beginning of the&nbsp;20th century the Rumanian petroleum deposits were among the&nbsp;most important in the world. The industry is carried on by&nbsp;private producers as well as by the state, the American Standard&nbsp;Oil Company being largely interested. The total output, coming&nbsp;chiefly from the departments of Bacau, Buzeu, Dimbovitza ana&nbsp;Prahova, was 250,000 metric tons in 1900, 615,000 in 1905, and&nbsp;1,300,000 in 1909. Associated with petroleum is ozokerite, converted by the peasantry into candles. Lignite is used as fuel on&nbsp;the railways. The chief anthracite beds, those in the Gorjiu&nbsp;department, are leased until 1975 to an English capitalist,&nbsp;who has the right to construct railways. Extensive coalfields&nbsp;exist in the Dobrudja, and the Dimbovitza. Mehedintzi, Muscel,&nbsp;Prahova and V&amp;lcca departments. Iron, copper, lead, mercury,&nbsp;cinnabar, cobalt, nickel, sulphur, arsenic and china clay also occur.&nbsp;Among the mountains, gold was perhaps worked under Trajan,&nbsp;who first appointed a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Procurator Metallorum,</span><span class="font2"> or overseer of mines,&nbsp;for Dacia; certainly in the lath century, when immigrant Saxon&nbsp;miners established a considerable trade with Ragusa, in Dalmatia.&nbsp;Under the Turks, gold-washing was carried on by gipsy slaves,&nbsp;but it has long been abandoned as unprofitable. Until 1896&nbsp;building materials were chiefly imported; but, after that year,&nbsp;many quarries were opened to develop the native resources of&nbsp;limestone, sandstone, serpentine, red, yellow and green granite,&nbsp;and marbles of all colours, including the white marble from Dorna&nbsp;in Suceava, said by Rumans to rival that of Carrara in Italy Clear&nbsp;amber is found beside the Buzeu and its affluents, with brown and&nbsp;grey clouded amber, and a blue fluorescent variety, of considerable&nbsp;value.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Rumania has long been noted for its mineral springs. Ruins of a Roman bath exist near Curtea .de Argesh. In the Vfllcea department, besides many other iodine, sulphur and. mud baths,&nbsp;there are the state-supported spas of Calimanescii, Caciulata&nbsp;and Govora, situated among, some of the finest Carpathian scenery.&nbsp;Most famous of all is Sinaia (5.V.), the summer residence of the&nbsp;Court; while important springs exist at Lake Sarat, near Braila;&nbsp;at Slanic, in the Prahova department, where flooded and abandoned&nbsp;salt-mines are fitted up as baths; at the Tekir Ghiol mere, near&nbsp;Constantza; and at Baltzatesti </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Baltate$tifL</span><span class="font2"> in the Neamtzu&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Neam{u)</span><span class="font2"> department, a favourite resort of invalids from many&nbsp;parts of eastern Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Agriculture.—</span><span class="font2">That, in 1900, Rumania ranked third,@@<sup>1</sup> after the United States and Russia, among the grain-growing countries of the&nbsp;world, is due partly to the fertile soli, whose chemical constituents&nbsp;are the same as </span><span class="font3">in </span><span class="font2">the “black earth*’ region of Russia, though even</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>@@@1 </sup>The relative importance of Rumania was afterwards lessened by the development of wheat-culture in Canada, Argentina and&nbsp;elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">richer in nitrates; partly also to the improved methods and ap-</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">f</span><span class="font2">ilianccs introduced in the last quarter of the 10th century. Tnc rail wooden ploughs with a lance-headed share that only scratched&nbsp;the surface soil, were then superseded by iron ploughs; steam&nbsp;threshers replaced the oxen which trod out the corn, and modern&nbsp;implements were widely adopted. Vast harvests of wheat and&nbsp;maize ripen on the plains and lower hills. Apart from cereals,&nbsp;the principal crops arc beans., potatoes, beetroot and tobacco. Among&nbsp;the wine-producing countries of Europe, Rumania stood fifth in&nbsp;I900, despite the ravages of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">phylloxera,</span><span class="font2"> old-fashioned culture, lack&nbsp;of storage and other drawbacks. The red wines of Moldavia,&nbsp;especially the brand known as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Piscul Cerbulul,</span><span class="font2"> resemble Bordeaux.&nbsp;The best white wines came from Cotnar in the Jassy department,&nbsp;but here </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">phylloxera</span><span class="font2"> ruined the vineyards. Golden Cotnar was akin&nbsp;to Tokay. To combat the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">phylloxera,</span><span class="font2"> the government ordered the&nbsp;destruction of all infected vines, distributed immune American stocks&nbsp;and established schools of viticulture. On the upland fruit farms,&nbsp;although apples, pears, medlars, cherries, plums, peaches, apricots&nbsp;and melons thrive, the chief attention is given to damsons, from which&nbsp;is extracted a mild spirit </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(tsuica),</span><span class="font2"> highly esteemed throughout&nbsp;Rumania. This industry began to decline after i860, but revived&nbsp;with the establishment of government schools of fruit-culture in&nbsp;many villages. Further instruction was given at various horticultural institutes in the towns, notably the Botanic Gardens and&nbsp;Institute of Bucharest, where the experiments in planting figs,&nbsp;almonds, hops and cotton yielded favourable results. Tobacco&nbsp;is largely cultivated, under state supervision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There are three breeds of Rumanian oxen, besides the. peculiar black buffaloes, with horns lying almost flat along their necks.&nbsp;Cheap transit enables the Rumanian farmers to compete successfully in the meat-markets of Austria, Germany and Holland. The&nbsp;southern Dobrudja and the Baragan Steppe, with the mountain&nbsp;pastures of Argen, Buzeu, Dimbovitza, Musccl and Prahova, are&nbsp;occupied by large sheep-runs; 1200 farms were created in.the&nbsp;Baragan by the Land Act of 1889. In winter the flocks are driven&nbsp;from the highlands to the plains. Cheeses of ewe’s milk, packed&nbsp;in sheepskins or bark, are. in great demand. Swine and pork are&nbsp;largely exported to Russia and Austria-Hungary. Besides the&nbsp;Moldavian and Servian breeds, thousands of so-called “ swamp&nbsp;hogs ’’ run wild among the marshes and on the islands of the Danube.&nbsp;Silkworm-rearing, once an important household industry, had been&nbsp;almost abandoned, when, in 1891, the government established&nbsp;mulberry nurseries, and distributed silkworms free of charge.&nbsp;Silkworm-rearing is taught in the monasteries and agricultural&nbsp;schools, especially in the College of Agriculture and Sylviculture,&nbsp;at Ferestnu, near Bucharest. Similar measures were adopted to&nbsp;check the decline of bee-keeping, and a model apiary was founded in&nbsp;1890, under government control.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Forests.—</span><span class="font2">The forests of Rumania were long either neglected or exploited in the most reckless fashion. Large tracts of woodland&nbsp;were cleared near the railways, and the communal rights of grazing&nbsp;and gathering firewood destroyed the aftergrowths. Nevertheless,&nbsp;in 1910 there were 2,760,000 acres under forests, chiefly in the&nbsp;mountains of north-western Moldavia. More than 1,000,000 acres&nbsp;are state property. Under King Charles, an ardent forester, the&nbsp;wholesale destruction of timber was arrested, and new plantations&nbsp;met with success. Lumber is floated down the rivers of the Carpathian watershed to the Danube, and so exported to Turkey and&nbsp;Bulgaria: casks, shaped planks and petroleum drums go chiefly&nbsp;to Austria and Russia. Wood-carving is taught in many schools,&nbsp;and a special school of forestry exists at Branesci in the llfov department. Estates in private hands are liable to state control, under&nbsp;the Forests Act of 1886.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Land Tenure.</span><span class="font2">—The Rumanian system of land tenure dates from 1864, when most of the land was held in large estates, owned&nbsp;privately, or by the state or by monasteries. There was also a small&nbsp;class of peasant proprietors, called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">mocheneni</span><span class="font2"> in Walachia, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">rtstchi&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">in Moldavia, living and working in family communities; but the&nbsp;great mass, of the peasantry cultivated the lands of the large proprietors, giving a certain number of days’ work to their manorial&nbsp;lord, in addition to a tithe of the raw produce. They received in&nbsp;return a plot of ground proportionate to the number of animals&nbsp;they owned, and had also rights of grazing and of collecting fuel in&nbsp;the forests. In 1864, under the government of Prince Cuza, a new&nbsp;law was promulgated,, conferring on each peasant family freehold&nbsp;property in lots varying from 7J to 15 acres, according to the&nbsp;number of oxen that they owned. The man with no cattle received&nbsp;the minimum; the owner of 2 oxen got 10 acres, and the possessor&nbsp;of 4 received 12J to 15 acres. The price of the land, wnich was&nbsp;calculated on the basis of the value of the forced labour to which the&nbsp;landlord had been entitled, was about £1, 16s. per acre, paid to the&nbsp;landlord by the state as compensation, and subsequently recovered&nbsp;from the peasants in fifteen annual.instalments. In the first distribution, which took place almost immediately after the law was&nbsp;passed. 280,000 families in Walachia and about 127,000 in Moldavia&nbsp;became freeholders, holding nearly 4 million acres or one-third&nbsp;of the cultivated area of the country. These peasant plots were&nbsp;all declared inalienable for thirty years. The law of emancipation,&nbsp;although passed with the best of motives, did not to any great</span></p>
