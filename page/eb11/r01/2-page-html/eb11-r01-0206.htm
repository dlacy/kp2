<p><span class="font2">out the greater part of its course; it drains a region that is famous for the production of wheat; and much water power has&nbsp;been developed on its tributaries. The United States government has improved its channel from the international boundary&nbsp;to Breckenridge, Minnesota, a distance of 395∙5 m., and occasionally the water reaches a height which permits small steamboats&nbsp;to ascend its S.W. branch to Lake Traverse and from there to&nbsp;descend the Minnesota river to the Mississippi.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RED RIVER SETTLEMENT, a Scottish colony founded in 1811 near the present city of Winnipeg by a philanthropic&nbsp;Scottish nobleman, Lord Selkirk, who at that time controlled&nbsp;the Hudson’s Bay Company. Quarrels soon arose with the&nbsp;French and half-breed </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">employes</span><span class="font2"> of the North-West Fur Company,&nbsp;and were fostered by its officials. On June 19, 1816, in a&nbsp;fight between the rivals, Governor Semple of the Hudson’s&nbsp;Bay Company and twenty of his twenty-seven attendants were&nbsp;killed, an affair known as the Battle of Seven Oaks. New&nbsp;settlers were sent by Selkirk, and founded the village of Kildonan,&nbsp;now part of Winnipeg. In 1821 the rival companies united,&nbsp;and in 1836 repurchased from Selkirk’s heirs all rights to the&nbsp;territory. In 1821 and in 1835 two forts, known as Lower and&nbsp;Upper Fort Garry, were built to command the junction of the&nbsp;Red and Assiniboine rivers, and around them grew up a mixed&nbsp;population of Scots, French and Indians. The purchase in&nbsp;1869 of the territorial rights of the Company by the Dominion&nbsp;of Canada led to a rebellion, and the setting up of a provisional&nbsp;government under Louis Riel, which was dispersed by a force of&nbsp;British regulars under Colonel (later Lord) Wolseley.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">REDRUTH, a market town in the Camborne parliamentary division of Cornwall, England, 17 m. E.N.E. of Penzance, on&nbsp;the Great Western railway. Pop. of urban district (1901)&nbsp;10,451. It lies high, on the northward slope of the central&nbsp;elevation of the county, with bare rocky moors to the south.&nbsp;It is the chief mining town in Cornwall, and the bulk of the&nbsp;population is engaged in the tin mines or at the numerous tin-streaming works. The parish church of St Uny, of which only&nbsp;the tower is ancient (Perpendicular), stands outside the town to&nbsp;the west, at the foot of a rugged hill named Cam Brea. On the&nbsp;summit of this hill, besides a' monument (1836) to Lord de&nbsp;Dunstanville and a small ancient castle, various prehistoric&nbsp;remains are traceable. A museum attached to the science and&nbsp;art schools and a miners’ hospital are notable institutions in&nbsp;Redruth. A large quantity of the tin is sold by public auction&nbsp;at the mining exchange, the sales being known as tin-ticketíngs.&nbsp;There are manufactures of safety fuses, breweries, iron foundries&nbsp;and railway works. Tramways serve the neighbouring mines&nbsp;and the small port of Portreath on the north coast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RED SEA, a narrow strip of water extending S.S.E. from Suez to the Strait of Bab el-Mandeb in a nearly straight line,&nbsp;and separating the coasts of Arabia from those of Egypt, Nubia&nbsp;and Abyssinia. Its total length is about 1∙200 m., and its&nbsp;breadth varies from about 250 m. in the southern half to&nbsp;130 m. in 27° 45' N., where it divides into two parts, the&nbsp;Gulf of Suez and the Gulf of Akaba, separated from each other&nbsp;by the peninsula of Sinai.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Gulf of Suez is shallow, and slopes regularly down to the northern extremity of the Red Sea basin, which has a&nbsp;maximum depth of 640 fathoms, and then over a&nbsp;shoal of 60 fathoms goes down to 1200 fathoms in</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">22° 7' N. The Gulf of Akaba is separated from the Red Sea by </span><span class="font0">a </span><span class="font2">submarine bank only 70 fathoms from the surface, and in&nbsp;28° 39' N. and 34° 43' E. it attains the depth of 700 fathoms.&nbsp;South of the 1200-fathom depression a ridge rises to 500 fathoms&nbsp;in the latitude of Jidda, and south of this again a similar depres-sion goes down to 1190 fathoms. Throughout this northern part,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font2"> to the banks of Suakin and Farsan in 20° N., the 100-fathom&nbsp;line keeps to a belt of coral reef close inshore, but in lower&nbsp;latitudes the shallow coral region, 300 m. long and 70 to 80 m.&nbsp;across, extends farther and farther seaward, until in the latitude&nbsp;of Hodeda the deep channel (marked by the 100-fathom line) is&nbsp;only 20 m. broad, all the rest of the area being dangerous to navigation, even for small vessels. In the middle of the gradu-.&nbsp;ally narrowing channel three depressions are known to exist;&nbsp;soundings in two of these are: 1110 fathoms in 20° N. and 890 fathoms in 16° N., a little to the north of Massawa. To the&nbsp;north-west of the volcanic island of Zebayir the depth is less&nbsp;than 500 fathoms; the bottom of the channel rises to the 100-fathom line at Hanish Island (also volcanic), then shoals to 45&nbsp;fathoms, and sinks again in about the latitude of Mokha in a&nbsp;narrow channel which curves westward round the island of&nbsp;Perim (depth 170 fathoms), to lose itself in the Indian Ocean.&nbsp;This western channel is 16 m. wide in the Strait of Bab el-Mandeb;&nbsp;the eastern channel of the strait is 2 m. broad and 16 fathoms&nbsp;deep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Murray estimates the total area at 158,750 sq. m., and its volume at 67,700 cub. m., giving a mean depth of 375 fathoms.&nbsp;Karstens gives the area at 448,810 sq. kilometres ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(130,424 sq. geographical m.) and the volume at 206,901 cub. kilometres (32,413 cub. geographical&nbsp;m.), which gives a mean depth of 2.52 fathoms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Both these computations, however, were made before the date of the Austrian exploring expeditions (1896-98). Bludau's&nbsp;measurements give the total area draining to the Red Sea&nbsp;at about 255,000 sq. geographical m. Krümmel's more&nbsp;recent calculations (see Ocean) give values somewhat higher&nbsp;than those of Karstens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Red Sea is formed by </span><span class="font2">a </span><span class="font1">line of fracture, probably dating from Pliocene times, crossing the centre of a dome of Archean&nbsp;rocks, on both flanks of which, in Egypt and Arabia,&nbsp;rest Secondary and Tertiary deposits. The granite rocks&nbsp;forming the core of the dome appear at the surface on the&nbsp;Red Sea coast, at the western end of the transverse line of heights&nbsp;crossing Nejd. Along the line of fracture traces of volcanic activity&nbsp;are frequent; a group of volcanic islands occurs in 14° N., and on&nbsp;Jebel Teir, farther north, a volcano has only recently become&nbsp;extinct. The margin of the Red Sea itself consists, on the Arabian&nbsp;side, of a strip of low plain backed by ranges of barren hills of coral&nbsp;and sand formation, and here and there by mountains of considerable height. The greater elevations are for the most part formed&nbsp;of limestones, except in the south, where they arc largely volcanic.&nbsp;The coasts of the Gulf of Akaba are steep, with numerous coral&nbsp;reefs on both sides. On the African side there are in the north&nbsp;wide stretches of desert plain, which towards the south rise to&nbsp;elevated tablelands, and ultimately to the mountains of Abyssinia.&nbsp;The shores of the Red Sea are little indented; good harbours are&nbsp;almost wanting in the desert regions of the north, while in the&nbsp;south the chief inlets are at Massawa, and at Kamaran, almost&nbsp;directly opposite. Coral formations are abundant; immense&nbsp;reefs, both barrier and fringing, skirt both coasts, often enclosing&nbsp;wide channels between the reef and the land. The reefs on the&nbsp;eastern side are the more extensive; they occur in places as much&nbsp;as 25 m. from the land. It has long been known that the whole&nbsp;Red Sea area is undergoing gradual elevation, and much has been&nbsp;done in recent years in investigating the levels of raised beaches&nbsp;found in different localities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the northern part, down to almost 19° N., the prevailing winds are north and north-west. The middle region, to 14°-16° N.,&nbsp;has variable winds in an area of low barometric pressure, while in the southern Red Sea south-east and&nbsp;cast winds prevail. From June to August the north-west wind blows over the entire area; in September it retreats&nbsp;again as far as 16° N., south of which the winds are for a time&nbsp;variable. In the Gulf of Suez the westerly, or “ Egyptian,” wind&nbsp;occurs frequently during winter, sometimes blowing with violence,&nbsp;and generally accompanied by fog and clouds of dust. Strong&nbsp;north-north-east winds prevail in the Gulf of Akaba during the&nbsp;greater part of the year; they are weakest in April and May,&nbsp;sometimes giving place at that season to southerly breezes. The&nbsp;high temperature and great relative humidity make the summer&nbsp;climate of the Red Sea one of the most disagreeable in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The mean annual temperature of the surface waters near the head is </span><span class="font2">77° </span><span class="font1">F.; it rises to 80° in about 22° N., to 84° in 16° N.,&nbsp;and drops again to 82° at the Strait of Bab el-Mandeb.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Daily variations of temperature are observable to a depth of over 50 fathoms. Temperature is, on the&nbsp;whole, higher near the Arabian than the Egyptian side, but it&nbsp;everywhere diminishes with increase of depth and latitude, down&nbsp;to 380 fathoms from the surface; below this depth a uniform&nbsp;constant temperature of 70∙7° F. is observed throughout. In the&nbsp;Gulf of Suez temperature is relatively low, falling rapidly from&nbsp;south to north. The waters of the Gulf of Akaba are warmer&nbsp;towards the Arabian than the Sinai coasts; a uniform temperature&nbsp;of 70·2° is observed at all depths below 270 fathoms.</span></p>
