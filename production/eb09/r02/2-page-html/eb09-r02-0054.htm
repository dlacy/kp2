<p><span class="font1">The complete absence of natural harbours has all along been a great hindrance to the commercial development of Réunion.&nbsp;Whenever a storm is observed to be brewing an alarm gun is fired,&nbsp;and the vessels in the roadsteads make off from the dangerous&nbsp;coast. Since 1848 an artificial harbour capable of containing forty&nbsp;vessels has been constructed at Pointe des Galets at the northwest corner of the island. The port is connected by rail with La&nbsp;Possession on the one hand and with the Rivière des Galets on the&nbsp;other, and thus communicates with the railway which was completed in 1881 round the coast from St Pierre, by St Paul, St Denis,&nbsp;&amp;c., to St Benoit, a distance of 83⅛ miles. This line is carried&nbsp;through a tunnel nearly 6⅛ miles long between La Possession and&nbsp;St Denis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The windward arrondissement or division of Réunion comprises the eight communes of St Denis, Ste Marie, Ste Suzanne, St André,&nbsp;St Benoit, Salazie, Ste Rose, and Plaine des Palmistes ; and the&nbsp;leeward division the six communes of St Paul, St Leu, St Louis,&nbsp;St Pierre, St Joseph, and St Philippe. St Denis, the capital of&nbsp;the island, lies on the north coast. It is built in the form of an&nbsp;amphitheatre and presents a most attractive appearance from the&nbsp;sea. Covering as a commune an area of 37,065 acres, it has a&nbsp;population of 30,835 according to the census of 1881, an increase&nbsp;of 18,000 since 1837. It has an abundant supply of pure water.&nbsp;Though the harbour is only an open roadstead, it has hitherto&nbsp;been the most frequented in the island. St Pierre, the chief town&nbsp;of the leeward arrondissement, has a communal area of 98,190 acres&nbsp;and a population of 27,748. Its artificial harbour, commenced in&nbsp;1854 but afterwards interrupted, and resumed in 1881, has room&nbsp;for five or six vessels besides coasting craft.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The population was 185,179 in 1872, 183,529 in 1878, and 170,734 in 1882. The males are largely in excess of the females&nbsp;(97,961 to 72,773 in 1882), owing to the number of agricultural&nbsp;labourers introduced from abroad for a term of years. Among the&nbsp;whites born on the island an infusion of alien blood is so common that in Mauritius the phrase Bourbon white is applied to&nbsp;linen of doubtful cleanness ; the original settlers frequently married&nbsp;Malagasy wives. The name Petits Blancs is in Réunion given to&nbsp;a class of small farmers who lead an independent kind of life in the&nbsp;upper districts, supporting themselves by their garden-plots and&nbsp;hunting. By the beginning of the 18th century the number of&nbsp;Negro slaves in the island was 64,000, four times that of their&nbsp;masters ; they were all (to the number of 20,000) emancipated in&nbsp;1848, and have gradually acquired a large measure of social equality&nbsp;with the creoles. Various elements have been added to the population since the middle of the century—coolies from India in large&nbsp;numbers, Africans from the east coast, Chinese and Anamites,&nbsp;Malays, &amp;c. The immigration of the Indian coolies is controlled&nbsp;by a convention between the British and French Governments of&nbsp;date July 1, 1881.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Réunion is usually said to have been first discovered in April 1513 by Mascarenhas, whose name is still applied to the archipelago&nbsp;of which it forms a part ; but it seems probable that it must be&nbsp;identified with the island of Santa Apollonia discovered by Diego&nbsp;Fernandes Pereira on February 9, 1507. When in 1638 the island&nbsp;was taken possession of by Captain Gaubert or Gobert of Dieppe, it&nbsp;was still uninhabited ; a more formal annexation in the name of&nbsp;Louis XIII. was effected in 1643 by Pronis, agent of the “Compagnie&nbsp;des Indes” in Madagascar ; and in 1649 Flacourt, Pronis’s more eminent successor, repeated the ceremony at La Possession, and changed&nbsp;the name from Mascarenhas to Bourbon. By decree of the Convention in 1793, Bourbon in turn gave place to Réunion, and,&nbsp;though during the empire this was discarded in favour of île&nbsp;Bonaparte, and at the Restoration people naturally went back to&nbsp;Bourbon, it has remained the official designation since 1848.&nbsp;Between July 8, 1810, and April 6, 1815, the island was in the&nbsp;possession of England. It is now practically almost a department&nbsp;of France, sends a representative to the chamber of deputies, is&nbsp;governed by means of laws and not of decrees, and possesses a&nbsp;council-general and municipal councils elected by universal suffrage. In the general budget for 1881 the expenditure amounted&nbsp;to 6,866,272 francs, including 1,916,143 contributed by the home&nbsp;Government; in 1883 the total was 7,468,426, upwards of 3,420,000&nbsp;being for communal expenses.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">REUS, a town of Spain, in the province of Tarragona, is situated at the foot of a chain of hills in a fertile plain&nbsp;about four miles from the sea. It is connected by rail&nbsp;with Tarragona, 9∣ miles to the east, and with Lerida,&nbsp;54J miles to the north-west. It consists of two parts, the&nbsp;old and the new, separated by the boulevard-like Calle</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Arrabal, which occupies the site of the old wall, some vestiges of which still remain : the old town centres in the&nbsp;Plaza del Mercado, from which narrow and tortuous lanes&nbsp;radiate in various directions ; the new dates from about&nbsp;the middle of the 18th century, and its streets are wide&nbsp;and straight. The public buildings have no special architectural or historical interest, but the view from the tower&nbsp;of the church of San Pedro is exceptionally fine. Réus,&nbsp;next to Barcelona itself, is the most flourishing manufacturing centre in Catalonia, the staples being silk and&nbsp;cotton ; imitations of French wines are also extensively&nbsp;made, and the miscellaneous industries include tanning,&nbsp;distilling, and the like. The cotton factories exceed&nbsp;eighty in number, and one of them employs upwards of&nbsp;six hundred hands. Most of the traffic of Réus passes&nbsp;through the comparatively sheltered port of Salou, four&nbsp;miles distant. The population of Réus in 1877 was&nbsp;27,595.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The earliest records of Réus date from about the middle of the 13th century. Its modern prosperity is traced to about the year&nbsp;1750, when a colony of English settled there and established a trade&nbsp;in woollens, leather, wine, and spirits. The principal incidents in&nbsp;its political history arose out of the occurrences of 1843, in connexion with which the “ villa ” became a “ ciudad ” and Generals&nbsp;Zurbano and Prim each received the title of count of Réus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">REUSS is the name of two small sovereign principalities of the German empire, with a joint area of 440 square miles, forming part of the complex of Thuringian states,&nbsp;and consisting, roughly speaking, of two principal masses&nbsp;of territory, separated by the Neustadt district of the&nbsp;duchy of Saxe-Weimar. The more southerly and much&nbsp;the larger of the two portions belongs to the bleak mountainous region of the Frankenwald and the Voigtland,&nbsp;while the northern portion is hilly but fertile. The chief&nbsp;rivers are the Elster and Saale. About 37 per cent, of&nbsp;the total surface is occupied by forests, while 40 per cent,&nbsp;is under tillage and 19 per cent, in meadow and pasture.&nbsp;Since 1616 the lauds of Reuss have been divided between&nbsp;an elder and a younger line </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">{Reuss älterer Linie</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Reuss&nbsp;jüngerer Linie)</span><span class="font2"> of the ancient princely house. The male&nbsp;members of both branches of the family all bear the name&nbsp;of Henry (Heinrich), the individuals being distinguished&nbsp;by numerals. In the older line the enumeration begins&nbsp;again when the number one hundred is reached, while in&nbsp;the younger house it opens and closes with the century.&nbsp;Thus the reigning prince of Reuss jüngerer Linie, born in&nbsp;1832, is styled Henry XIV., and he succeeded his father&nbsp;Henry LXVII., born in 1789. The princes of Reuss are&nbsp;very wealthy, and their private domains comprise great&nbsp;part of the territory over which they rule. In the event&nbsp;of the extinction of either line, its possessions fall to the&nbsp;other. The troops of Reuss furnish a few companies to&nbsp;the seventh regiment of Thuringian infantry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Reuss-Greiz, or Reuss älterer Linie, with an area of 122 square miles, belongs to the larger of the two main&nbsp;divisions above mentioned, within which it consists of&nbsp;three large and several smaller parcels of land, bordering&nbsp;on Saxony, Reuss jüngerer Linie, Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt,&nbsp;and the Prussian exclave of Ranis. The soil is on the&nbsp;whole little favourable for agriculture, but cattle-rearing&nbsp;is carried on with some success. No less than 63 per&nbsp;cent, of the inhabitants are supported by industrial&nbsp;pursuits, the chief products of which are the woollen&nbsp;fabrics of Greiz, the capital, and the stockings of Zeulenroda, both largely exported. The population of the principality in 1880 was 50,782, of whom only 450 were&nbsp;Roman Catholics and 60 Jews. The constitution of&nbsp;Reuss-Greiz dates from 1867, and provides for a representative chamber of twelve members, of whom three are&nbsp;appointed by the prince, while two are elected by the&nbsp;nobles, three by the towns, and four by the rural districts.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
