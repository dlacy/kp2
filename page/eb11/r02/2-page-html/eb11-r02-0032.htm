<p><span class="font1">female; the distinction between its permanent objects, and its occasional or recurring operations; the recognition that behind&nbsp;sudden manifestations of power, like the thunder-storm, there&nbsp;are steady forces and continuous cosmic agencies at work—lead&nbsp;to the graduaI rise of the higher deities. And from the social&nbsp;side the development of law, the influence of city life, the&nbsp;formation of priesthoods, the connexion of particular deities&nbsp;with the fortunes of dynasties or the vicissitudes of nations,&nbsp;the processes of migration, of conquest and political fusion, the&nbsp;deportations of vanquished peoples, even the sale of slaves to&nbsp;distant lands and the growth of trade and travel, all contribute&nbsp;to the processes which expand and modify different pantheons,&nbsp;and determine the importance of particular deities. In the&nbsp;midst of the bewildering variety, where aIl types co-exist&nbsp;together and act and react on each other, it is impossible to do&nbsp;more than point out some obvious groups receiving their special&nbsp;forms chiefly from the side (1) of nature, (2) of human life,&nbsp;and (3) from moral or theological speculation. Divine persons,&nbsp;objects or powers, connected with ritual, are not here considered,&nbsp;such as the Brahman priests who claimed to be </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">manushyadeväh&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(human-gods), or the sacred soma-juice which grew by strange&nbsp;analogies into a mysterious element, linking together heaven&nbsp;and earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">I. On the side of Nature the lowest rank (1) seems to belong to what Usener has designated “ momentary ” or “ occasional ”&nbsp;gods.@@<sup>1</sup> They embody for the time being a vague consciousness&nbsp;of the divine, which is concentrated for some single act into an&nbsp;outward object, like a warrior’s spear or the thunderbolt,@@<sup>2</sup> or&nbsp;the last sheaf of com into „ which the Corn-Mother has been&nbsp;driven.@@<sup>3</sup> (2) Above these, to use again Useneris nomenclature,@@<sup>4&nbsp;</sup>are the “ special ” or functional ” gods, “ departmental&nbsp;gods,” as Mr Lang has called them. Such were some of the&nbsp;deities of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Indigitarnenta</span><span class="font1"> already compared with the Japanese&nbsp;Kami. Among them, for example, were twelve deities of&nbsp;ploughing and harvest operations, who were invoked with&nbsp;Tellus and Ceres. (3) Another class may be seen in the species-deities previously named; the Samoan gods which could become&nbsp;incarnate as a heron or an owl, did not die with particular birds.&nbsp;A dead owl was not a dead god; he yet lived in all other owls.@@<sup>5</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The worship of trees, plants and animals is a particular&nbsp;phase of the wider series of nature-cults, only named here because&nbsp;of its frequency and its obvious survivals in some of the higher&nbsp;polytheisms, where, as in Egypt, the Apis bulls were.worshipped;&nbsp;or where, as in Mesopotamia, the great gods are partly symbolized&nbsp;by animal forms; or where, as in Israel, Yahweh might be&nbsp;represented as a bull; or where, as in Greece, such epithets as&nbsp;Dendrites and Endendros preserved traces of the association&nbsp;of Dionysus and Zeus with vegetation; while sacred animals&nbsp;like the serpents of Aesculapius were preserved in the temples.@@<sup>6</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The higher elemental gods sometimes, like the sun, as the&nbsp;Indian Surya, the Egyptian Rê, the Babylonian Shamash&nbsp;(Samas), the Greek Helios, retain their distinct connexion with&nbsp;the visible object. It was naturally more easy for a relatively&nbsp;spiritual worship to gather round a god whose name did not&nbsp;immediately suggest a familiar body. No one ever thought of&nbsp;confessing sin, for instance, to a river. But the da*ily survey&nbsp;of the sun (occasionally also the function of the moon as measurer&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font1">time), together with his importance for life, secured him a&nbsp;high moral rank; and Rê, united with the Theban Ammon,&nbsp;became (under the New Empire) the leading god of Egypt for&nbsp;a thousand years, “ He who hath made all, the sole One with&nbsp;many hands.” Other deities, like Zeus, rise to the head of a&nbsp;monarchical polytheism, in which their physical base is almost,</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">if not quite, forgotten in cosmic and moral grandeur. The gods are often arranged in groups, three, seven and twelve being&nbsp;frequent numbers. Egyptian summaries recognized gods in&nbsp;the sky, on earth and in the water; gods of the north and&nbsp;south, the east and west, gods of the field and the cities. Indian&nbsp;theologians classified them in three zones, earth, air and sky.&nbsp;Babylonian speculation embraced the world in a triad of divine&nbsp;powers, Anu the god of heaven, Bel of earth and Ea of the deep;&nbsp;and these became the symbols of the order of nature, the divine&nbsp;embodiments of physical law.@@<sup>7</sup> Sometimes the number three is&nbsp;reached by the distribution of the universe into sky, earth and&nbsp;UnderworId, and the gods of death claim their place as the&nbsp;rulers of the world to come. Among these deities all kinds of&nbsp;relationships are displayed; consorts must be provided for the&nbsp;unwedded, and the family conception, as distinct from the regal,&nbsp;presents a divine father, mother and child. The Ibani in&nbsp;Southern Nigeria recognized Adum the father-god, Okoba the&nbsp;mother-god and Eberebo the son-god.@@<sup>8</sup> In Egypt, Osiris,&nbsp;Isis and Horus proved an influential type. Perhaps at a&nbsp;relatively earIier stage maternity alone is emphatically asserted,&nbsp;as in the figure of the Cretan Mother, productive without&nbsp;distinctly sexual character.@@<sup>9</sup> Or, again, maternity disappears,&nbsp;while parenthood survives, and causation is embodied in a&nbsp;universal “ Father of all that are and are to be,” like the Indian&nbsp;Brahma in the days of Gotama the Buddha.”@@<sup>10</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">II. On the human side polytheism receives fresh groups in connexion with the development of social institutions and&nbsp;national feeling. (1) In the family the hearth-fire is the scene&nbsp;of the protecting care of deity; the gods of the household watch&nbsp;over its welfare. Each Roman householder had his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Genius,</span><span class="font1"> the&nbsp;women their </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Junones.</span><span class="font1"> These stood at a higher level than the&nbsp;“ occasional gods,” having permanent functions of supervision.&nbsp;(2) From the household a scries of steps embodied the divine&nbsp;power in higher forms for social and political ends. Hestia&nbsp;presided over cities; there was even a common Hestia for all&nbsp;Greece. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">fravashi</span><span class="font1"> or ideal type, the genius of both men and&nbsp;gods in the Zend Avesta (possibly connected originally with the&nbsp;cultus of the dead @@<sup>11</sup>), rises in successive ranks from the worshipper’s&nbsp;own person through the household, the village, the district and&nbsp;the province, up to the throne of Ahura himself.@@<sup>12</sup> The Chinese&nbsp;Shin were similarly organized; so (less elaborately) were the&nbsp;Japanese </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Kami</span><span class="font1">;@@<sup>13</sup> and the Roman </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lares,</span><span class="font1"> the old local land-gods,&nbsp;found their highest co-ordinating term in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lares Augusti,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">just as the Genius was extended to the legion and the colony,&nbsp;and finally to Rome itself. (3) In the case of national deities&nbsp;the tie between god and people is peculiarly close, as when&nbsp;Yahweh of Israel is pitted against Chemosh of Ammon (Judges&nbsp;xi. 24). The great gods of Greece, in their functions as “ saviours ”&nbsp;and city-guardians, acquire new moral characters, and become&nbsp;really different gods, though they retain the old names. Ashur&nbsp;rises into majestic sovereignty as the “ Ruler of all the gods,”&nbsp;the supreme religious form of Assyrian sway: when the empire&nbsp;falls beneath the revived power of Babylon, he fades away and&nbsp;disappears. (4) The earthly counterpart of the heavenly&nbsp;monarch is the divine king, who may be traced back in Egypt, for example, to the remotest antiquity,@@<sup>14</sup> and who survives to-day&nbsp;among the civilized powers in the emperor of Japan (anciently&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Arahito-gami,</span><span class="font1"> “ incarnate Kami ”). “To the end of time,”</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
