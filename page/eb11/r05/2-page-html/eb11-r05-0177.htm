<p><span class="font0">opponents. The 29th was an uneventful day<sub>r</sub> on which both sides prepared for the next phase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Russians’ semicircle, now contracted, rested on the Taitszeho above and below the town, and their forces were&nbsp;massed most closely on either side of the “ Mandarin ” road that&nbsp;the 1st Army had followed. Opposite this portion of the line&nbsp;was the Guard and the 4th Army. Oku was astride the railway,&nbsp;Kuroki extending towards his proposed crossing-points just&nbsp;beyond Kuropatkin’s extreme left (the latter was behind the&nbsp;river). On the 30th the attack was renewed. The Guard, the 4th&nbsp;^rmy and the 2nd Army were completely repulsed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On the night of the 30th the first Japanese troops crossed the Taitszeho near Lien-Tao-Wun, and during the 31st three&nbsp;brigades were deployed north of Kwan-tun, facing west. The&nbsp;Russian left wing observed the movement all day, and within&nbsp;its limited local resources made dispositions to meet it. Kuropatkin’s opportunity was now come. The remainder of the&nbsp;2nd division was following the 12th, leaving a nine-mile gap&nbsp;between Kuroki and Nozu, as well as the river. It was not into&nbsp;this gap, which had no military significance, but upon the&nbsp;isolated divisions of the 1st Army that the Russian general proposed to launch his counterstroke. Reorganizing his southern&nbsp;defences on a shorter front, so as to regain possession of the reserves that he had so liberally given away to his subordinates,&nbsp;he began to collect large bodies of troops opposite Kuroki, while&nbsp;Stakelberg and Zarubayev, before withdrawing silently into the&nbsp;lines or rather the fortress of Liao-Yang, again repulsed Oku’s&nbsp;determined attacks on the south side. But it was not in confidence of victory that Kuropatkin began the execution of the&nbsp;new plan—rather as a desperate expedient to avoid being cut&nbsp;off by the 1st Army, whose strength he greatly overestimated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On the morning of the 1st of September—the anniversary of Sedan, as the Japanese officers told their men—Oyama, whose&nbsp;intentions the active Kuroki had somewhat outrun, delivered a&nbsp;last attack with the 2nd and 4th Armies, and the Guard on the&nbsp;south front, in the hope of keeping the main body of the Russians&nbsp;occupied and so assisting Kuroki, but the assailants encountered&nbsp;no resistance, Zarubayev having already retired into the&nbsp;fortress. North of the Taitszeho the crisis was approaching.&nbsp;Kuroki’s left, near the river, vigorously attacked a hill called&nbsp;Manjuyama which formed part of the line of defence of the&nbsp;XVII. Corps from Europe. But the right of the 1st Army (12th&nbsp;division) was threatened by the gathering storm of the counterstroke from the side of Yentai Mines, and had it not been that&nbsp;the resolute Okasaki continued the attack on Manjuyama&nbsp;alone, the Japanese offensive would have come to a standstill.&nbsp;Manjuyama, thanks to the courage of the army commander&nbsp;and of a single brigadier, was at last carried after nightfall,&nbsp;and the dislodged Russians made two counter-attacks in the&nbsp;dark before they would acknowledge themselves beaten. Next&nbsp;morning, when Kuroki, who had conceived the mistaken idea&nbsp;of a general retreat of the Russians on Mukden, was preparing</span></p>
