            <p><span class="font3">After the death of Brutus, Valerius for a time retained the
                    consular power alone ; not from ambition, but probably that&nbsp;he might,
                    unobstructed, pass those laws which he deemed&nbsp;necessary for the public
                    welfare. He enacted a law, by&nbsp;which every person who should seek kingly
                    power was pronounced accursed, so that any man might kill him without&nbsp;fear
                    of punishment. In the presence of the assembly of the&nbsp;people, (the populus,
                    ί. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e.</span><span
                    class="font3"> the comitia curiata,) he caused&nbsp;the ensigns of consular
                    power to be lowered ; thus acknowledging the supreme authority of that assembly.
                    But his&nbsp;best act was the passing of that law, </span><span class="font3"
                    style="font-style:italic;">flex de provocatione,)&nbsp;</span><span
                    class="font3">which gave to all Roman citizens the right of appeal to
                    the&nbsp;assembly of the people from the sentence of any magistrate.&nbsp;This
                    was the first law enacted by the comitia centuriata ;&nbsp;and as soon as it was
                    passed Valerius took away the axes&nbsp;from the bundles of rods which were
                    borne before the consuls.&nbsp;This right of appeal existed only in the city
                    itself, and within&nbsp;a mile of it. Beyond that distance the military power of
                    the&nbsp;consuls remained unlimited, and the axes were borne and&nbsp;used as
                    formerly. The enactment of these laws obtained&nbsp;for Valerius the surname of
                    Poplicola.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font3">As soon as they were passed, he held the comitia for the election
                    of a consul in the room of Brutus. Spurius Lucretius was chosen ; and he dying
                    within a few days, Marcus Horatius Pulvillus was elected to complete his
                    year.&nbsp;About this time occurred that famous treaty between Rome&nbsp;and
                    Carthage, mentioned by Polybius, and which is perhaps&nbsp;the best proof of the
                    power of Rome under her latter kings.&nbsp;Ardea, Antium, Aricia, Circeii, and
                    Terracina, are mentioned in such terms as to cause them to be regarded
                    as&nbsp;subject cities, and Rome stipulates for them as well as
                    for&nbsp;herself. The treaty was signed by Brutus and Horatius ;&nbsp;whence a
                    difficulty has arisen, as these two were not at any&nbsp;time colleagues in the
                    consular office. But Gibbon@@<sup>1</sup> has&nbsp;shewn that such treaties were
                    signed by the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"
                    >feciales</span><span class="font3"> more&nbsp;properly than by the consuls ;
                    and there is no reason for&nbsp;doubting that Brutus and Horatius may have been
                    conjoined&nbsp;in that office.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font3">In the mean while Tarquinius, finding the inability of the
                    Veientians and Tarquinians to replace him on the throne,&nbsp;applied to Lars
                    Porsenna, king of Clusium, at that time the&nbsp;most powerful of all the
                    Etruscan monarchs. Porsenna&nbsp;raised a great army, and marched towards Rome.
                    He was&nbsp;met by the Romans near the fortress on the Janiculum ;&nbsp;but
                    almost at the first encounter they took to flight, and&nbsp;the Etrurians
                    pursued them impetuously as they sought&nbsp;safety by crossing the bridge.
                    Horatius Cocles, seeing the&nbsp;danger that the city might be taken at once if
                    the enemy&nbsp;should enter it along with the flying Romans, posted himself on
                    the bridge, made head against the pursuers, and&nbsp;called on his countrymen to
                    cut down the bridge between&nbsp;him and the city. Spurius Larcius, and Titus
                    Herminius&nbsp;lent their aid in the heroic deed. When the bridge
                    was&nbsp;nearly cut through, Codes sent back his two companions,&nbsp;and singly
                    maintained his post. At length the crash of the&nbsp;falling beams, and the
                    shouts of his countrymen gave him&nbsp;to know that the deed was done ; when
                    calling on the god&nbsp;of the Tiber to receive him, he plunged into the
                    stream,&nbsp;and, accoutered as he was, swam in safety to the
                    shore,&nbsp;through the missile weapons of the enemy, which showered&nbsp;fast
                    and thick around him.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font3">Thus was the city saved from that sudden danger ; but all its
                    peril was not over. Porsenna not only retained possession of the Janiculum, but
                    sending his army across the&nbsp;river in boats, pillaged the country, cut off
                    all supplies, and&nbsp;reduced Rome to the utmost distress by famine. In
                    this&nbsp;emergency, a noble youth, Caius Mucius, undertook to rid&nbsp;his
                    country of this dangerous enemy. He made his way&nbsp;into the camp of Porsenna,
                    and entered into the very prae</span></p></div><br clear="all" /><div>
            <p><span class="font3">torium, where he saw a person royally attired, and seated on a
                    chair of state. Supposing this to be the king, Mucius&nbsp;sprung upon him, and
                    stabbed him to the heart. He was&nbsp;immediately siezed, and led before
                    Porsenna, whose secretary he had thus killed. There he acknowledged his
                    deed,&nbsp;and told the king that his danger was by no means over.&nbsp;Porsenna
                    threatened him with death by torture, unless&nbsp;he would divulge the plots by
                    which his life was threatened.&nbsp;Mucius immediately stretched forth his right
                    hand and&nbsp;thrust it into the fire of an altar which was burning
                    before&nbsp;the king, saying, “ Behold how much I regard your threats&nbsp;of
                    torture.” He held it in the flames till it was consumed,&nbsp;without a feature
                    of his stern countenance indicating that&nbsp;he felt the pain. Porsenna, struck
                    with his noble daring and&nbsp;contempt of suffering, commanded him to be set at
                    liberty.&nbsp;Mucius then told him, in requital of his generosity, that
                    he&nbsp;was only one of three hundred patrician youths who had&nbsp;vowed to
                    kill Porsenna ; and that he must prepare for their&nbsp;attempts, which would be
                    not less daring than his own.&nbsp;From that time Mucius was called Scaevola, or
                    the left-handed, because he had thus lost the use of his right hand.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font3">Alarmed by the dangers which threatened him from foes so
                    determined, Porsenna offered terms of peace to the Romans. A treaty was at
                    length concluded, according to&nbsp;which Porsenna ceased to maintain the cause
                    of the Tar-quinian family ; but demanded the restitution of all the&nbsp;lands
                    which the Romans had at any time taken from the&nbsp;states of Etruria, and that
                    twenty hostages, ten youths and&nbsp;ten maidens of the first houses, should be
                    given up to him&nbsp;for security that the treaty would be faithfully
                    observed.&nbsp;The legend relates that Cl</span><span class="font1"
                    >œ</span><span class="font3">lia, one of the hostages, escaping from the
                    Etrurian camp, swam across the Tiber on&nbsp;horseback, amidst showers of darts
                    from her baffled pursuers ; but that the Romans, jealous of their reputation
                    for&nbsp;good faith, sent her back to the camp of Porsenna. Not&nbsp;to be
                    outdone in generosity, he gave to her and her female&nbsp;companions their
                    freedom, and permitted her to take with&nbsp;her half of the youths ; while she,
                    with the delicacy of&nbsp;a Roman maiden, selected those only who were of
                    tender&nbsp;years. The Romans then, at the final settlement of the&nbsp;treaty,
                    sent as a present to Porsenna, an ivory throne and&nbsp;sceptre, a golden crown,
                    and a triumphal robe, the offerings&nbsp;by which the Etruscan cities had once
                    acknowledged the&nbsp;sovereignty of Tarquinius.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font3">When Porsenna quitted Rome, he entered the Latian territories,
                    and attacked Aricia, the chief town of Latium.&nbsp;The Aricians being aided by
                    the other Latian cities, and&nbsp;also by the Cumans, under the command of
                    Aristodemus,&nbsp;defeated the Etruscans in a great battle, and put a stop
                    to&nbsp;their aggressions. Thc Romans received the fugitives
                    from&nbsp;Porsenna’s army, and treated them with great kindness ;&nbsp;in
                    requital for which Porsenna restored to them the</span><span class="font0"
                    > </span><span class="font3">lands&nbsp;which he had conquered beyond the
                    Tiber.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font3">Such is an outline of the poetical legends respecting the great
                    war against Porsenna. It is, however, clear from&nbsp;other accounts and
                        indications,@@<sup>2</sup> that Porsenna took the&nbsp;city, deprived it of
                    one-third of its land, as was customary,&nbsp;imposed a tribute upon it,
                    received the usual recognitions of&nbsp;sovereign authority, and even deprived
                    the Romans of the&nbsp;use of metal in any other form than those employed in
                    the&nbsp;purposes of agriculture, that they might not have it in
                    their&nbsp;power to revolt. In this latter statement, we have again&nbsp;an
                    incidental hint of the eastern origin and customs of the&nbsp;Etruscans ; in
                    proof of which, reference may be made to the&nbsp;way in which the Philistines
                    tyrannized over the Israelites&nbsp;during one of their periods of conquest.
