To this man she entirely attached herself, and accompanied him wherever he went ; nay even attended him in his last illness at Altena in Holstein. Her works, consisting of De Vitæ Humanæ termino, Dissertatio de Ingenii Muliebris ad doctrinam et meliores litteras aptitudine, and her Letters to her learned correspondents, were printed at Leyden in 1648, but enlarged in the edition of Utrecht, 1662, in 12mo, when they appeared under the following title: A. M. Schurman Opuscula Hebræa, Græca, Latina, Gallica, Prosaica, et Metrica. She likewise published at Altena, in Latin, a defence of her attachment to Labadie, whilst she was with him in 1673. She died in Friesland in 1678.</p><p>SCHWABACH, a city of the kingdom of Bavaria, in the circle of the Rezat, situated on a river of the same name. It is the seat of the provincial courts of law, and of the boards of administration. It contains one reformed and two Lutheran churches, two Catholic chapels, and a Jews’ synagogue, with 650 houses, and 6960 inhabitants, who are employed in various manufactures, principally in spinning cotton and making hosiery, but also in producing cutlery, paper, and toys of wood and of ivory.</p><p>SCHWARTSBURG-SONDERHAUSEN, a small sovereign principality in Germany, taking its first name from an ancient castle, and the second from its capital. It is 263 geographical square miles in extent, is divided into seven bailiwicks, which comprise twelve cities and towns, and 83 villages, with, in 1838, 54,080 inhabitants, all adhering to the Lutheran confession except 200, who are Catholics. The revenue of the prince, chiefly derived from domains, amounts to L.40,000, and the expenditure is nearly equal to it, including interest on the public debt, which does not exceed one year’s income. The contingent fixed to the German confederation is a force of 451 men. By a decree issued in 1830, an assembly of the states is provided, which, with the prince, is in future to make or alter the laws, and to regulate the finances. It is generally a hilly and woody district. It produces, by the help of extensive cultivation of potatoes, a little more corn than it consumes, and the surplus of it, with the produce of the forests, form the chief articles of trade. Much flax is grown, and there are some inconsiderable mines of iron, and these two articles afford some employment. The capital is Sonderhausen, with 3600 inhabitants, and the city of Arastad has 4800; the others are small places.</p><p>SCHWARZBURG-RUDOLSTADT,asovereign principality in Germany. It is 305 geographical square miles in extent, and is divided into eleven bailiwicks, which comprise eight cities and towns, and 155 villages, with, in 1838, 65,694 inhabitants, all Lutherans, except ,150 Catholics and about the same number of Jews. The income of the state is L.32,500, arising partly from domains, besides which the prince has estates in Holstein, which are his private property. The debt amounts to about two years’ income, but by a sinking fund is gradually diminishing. The contingent of force to the German confederation is fixed at 539 men. The greater part of the territory is on the Thuringian Hills, but between them are valleys of considerable fertility, especially that through which the Saale passes, and in which the capital, Rudolstadt, stands ; but much of the land is poor, and scantily rewards the labour of the husbandman. It does, however, with the aid of potatoes, which are extensively cultivated, yield sufficient bread-corn, chiefly rye, for the subsistence of the inhabitants. Flax is extensively grown ; but the mines afford more employment, yielding iron and lead, and some earths well adapted for making pottery-ware, all of which, with the addition of glass manufactories, give subsistence to the labouring classes. There are two cities, viz. Rudolstadt with 4000, und Frankenhausen with 3900 inhabitants.</p><p>SCHWATZ, a town of the Austrian province of Tyrol, in the circle of Innspruck. It stands on the river Inn, and having been destroyed in the course of hostilities during the year 1809, has been since rebuilt. It has again become a seat of the cotton manufacture, and of the fabrication of iron and cutlery goods and copper ware, mines of the latter being near to it. The population in 1837 amounted to 7500, and has now grown to upwards of 10,000. Long. 12. 34. E. Lat. 47. 32. N.</p><p>SCHWEIDNITZ, a city of Prussian Silesia, in the government of Reichenbach, the capital of a circle of the same name, which extends over 203 square miles, and contains three other towns and seventy-one villages, with 41,300 inhabitants. It stands on the river Weistrig, at the foot of a lofty hill. It was the strongest fortification on the frontier, but having been taken by the French in 1807, has not since been restored. It contains two Catholic and two Lutheran churches, one of the former of which has the highest tower in Germany. It has a gymnasium, military storehouse, and barracks now unoccupied, and 700 houses, with 11,600 inhabitants, who carry on extensive manufactures of woollen, silk, and linen goods. Long. 16. 31. 25. E. Lat 50. 47. 8. N.</p><p>SCHWEINFURT, a city of the kingdom of Bavaria, in the circle of the Upper Maine, the capital of an extensive bailiwick of the same name. It stands on the river Maine, which protects it on one side, and is defended by fortifications on the other parts. It is not well built, the streets being narrow and crooked. It contains a fine palace, eight churches, 780 houses, and 7100 inhabitants, who are occupied in various small branches of manufactures. Long. 9. 44. E. Lat. 50. 10. N.</p><p>SCHWERIN, a city, the capital of the grand duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, in Germany. It is finely situated, part being on the side of the lake of Schwerin, and part on an island on that lake, the two parts being connected by bridges. It contains the palace of the grand duke, with gardens, which exhibit more taste than the residence. It is fortified, but very imperfectly. It contains one Catholic and three Lutheran churches, the various appendages of a capital for a small state, 1100 houses, and 12,880 inhabitants, who have various manufactures adequate to the domestic consumption. Long. 11. 26. E. Lat. 54. 43. N.</p><p>SCH WETZ, a town of West Prussia, in the government of Marienwerder, the capital of the circle of the same name, which extends over 537 square miles. It stands on the Vistula, at the spot where the Schwartzwasser falls into that stream, and contains an old castle, and 260 houses, with 2260 inhabitants. Long. 18. 22. 15. E. Lat. 53. 24. 10. N.</p><p>SCHWYZ, a canton of Switzerland, which gives its name to the whole confederation. It is bounded on the north by Zurich, on the north-east by St Gall, on the east by Gla- rus, on the south by Uri, and on the west by Lucerne and Zug. It extends over 344 square miles, and comprises six towns, twenty-seven communes, and 36,390 inhabitants, who all adhere to the Roman Catholic church. It furnishes a contingent of 602 men to the force of the confederation, and a contribution of 3010 francs yearly. The government is a pure democracy. The surface is intersected by a chain of mountains in the form of an arch, on both sides of which are some beautiful and moderately fertile valleys ; and the mountains in summer afford excellent pasturage for cattle, which is the chief object of trade. It neither produces nor consumes much corn, and of what it does use, a part is obtained by the sale of cattle and of cheese. The most remarkable of the mountains is the Rigid, 5680 feet, on whose summit is a tavern, where visiters are accommodated. The chief river is the Sihl, which conveys to the Limmat all the waters of the several brooks that are formed from the mountains. The capital of the canton has the same name. It stands between the Righi</p></body></text></TEI>
