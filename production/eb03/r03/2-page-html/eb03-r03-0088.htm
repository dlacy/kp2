<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font0">the diſpute, and determined it in </span><span class="font1">favour </span><span class="font0">of Baſilius ; upon which Gregory had recourſe to arms, drove his&nbsp;nephew ſrom Moſcow to the principality of Uglitz,&nbsp;and forcibly uſurped and kept poſſeſſion of his throne.&nbsp;Upon the death of Gregory, Baſilius returned to Moſcow ; but Andrew and Demetrius, ſons of the late&nbsp;uſurper, laid liege to that city, and obliged him to retire to the menaſtery oſ Troitz, where they took him&nbsp;priſoner, with his wife and ſon, and put out his eyes :&nbsp;hence the appellation of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">βmnoi,</span><span class="font0"> “ blind,” by which&nbsp;this Baſilius is diſtinguiſhed. The ſubjects of this unfortunate prince, incenſed at the cruel treatment he had&nbsp;received, forced the perpetrators of it to fly to Novo-gorod, and reinſtated their lawful ſovereign at Moſcow,&nbsp;where he died.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the midſt of this general conſuſion, John Baſilo-vitz I. by his invincible ſpirit and refined policy, became both the conqueror and deliverer of his country, and laid the firſt foundation of its future grandeur.&nbsp;Obſerving with indignation the narrow limits of his&nbsp;power at his acceſſion to the throne, after the death of&nbsp;his father Baſilius the Blind, he began immediately to&nbsp;revolve within himſelf the means of enlarging his dominions. Marriage, though he had in reality no regard or inclination for women, ſeemed to him one of&nbsp;the beſt expedients he could begin with ; and accordingly he demanded and obtained Maria, filter of Michael duke of Twer ; whom he ſoon after depoied, under pretence of revenging the injuries done to his father, and added this duchy to his own territories of&nbsp;Moſcow. Maria, by whom he had a ſon named </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">John,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">who died before him, did not live long ; and upon her&nbsp;' death he married Sophia, daughter oſ Thomas Paleo-logus, who had been driven ſrom Ccnſtantinople, and&nbsp;forced to take ſhelter at Rome, where the pope portioned this princeſs, in hopes of procuring thereby&nbsp;great advantage to the Romiſh religion; but his expectations were fruſtrated, Sophia being obliged to conform to the Greek church after her arrival in Ruſſia.&nbsp;What could induce Baſilovitz to ſeek a confort at ſuch&nbsp;a diſtance, is nowhere accounted for; unleſs it be, that&nbsp;he hoped by this means to eſtabliſh a pretenſion to the&nbsp;empire of the eaſt, to which her father was the'next&nbsp;heir : but however that may be, the Ruſſians certainly&nbsp;owed to this alliance their deliverance from the Tartar&nbsp;yoke. Shocked at the fervile homage exacted by thoſe&nbsp;proud victors, her huſhand going to meet their ambai-ſadors at ſome diſtance from the city, and ſtanding to&nbsp;hear what they had to ſay ; whilſt they were at dinner,&nbsp;Sophia told him, that ſhe was ſurpriſed to find that ſhe&nbsp;had married a ſervant to the Tartars. Nettled at this&nbsp;reproach, Baſilovitz feigned himſelf ill when the next&nbsp;deputation from the Tartars arrived, and under that&nbsp;pretence avoided a repetition of the ſtipulated humiliating ceremonial. Another circumſtance equally diſ-pleaſing to this princeſs was, that the Tartars had, by&nbsp;agreement, within the walls of the palace at Moſcow,&nbsp;houſes in which their miniſters reſided ; to ſhow their&nbsp;power, and at the ſame time watch the actions of the&nbsp;great duke. To get rid of theſe, a formal embaſſy&nbsp;was ſent to the Tartarian khan, to tell him, that Sophia having been favoured with a viſion ſrom above,&nbsp;ordering her to build a temple in the place where thoſe&nbsp;houſes ſtood, her mind could not be at eaſe till ſhe had&nbsp;fulfilled the divine command; and therefore his leave&nbsp;was deſired fo pull them down, and give his people&nbsp;others. The khan conſented: the houſes within the '&nbsp;Kremlin were demoliſhed; and no new ones being provided, the Tartar reſidents were obliged to leave Moſcow’ ; their prince not being able to revenge this breach&nbsp;of promiſe, by reaſon of a war he was then engaged&nbsp;in wfith the Poles. Baſilovitz taking advantage of&nbsp;this circumſtance, and having in the mean time conſi-1&nbsp;derably increaſed his forces, openly diſclaimed all ſub-jection to the Tartars, attacked their dominions, and&nbsp;made himſelf maſter of Caſan, where he was ſolemnly&nbsp;crowned with the diadem of that kingdom, which is&nbsp;ſaid to be the ſame that is now uſed for the coronation&nbsp;of the Ruffian ſovereigns. The province of Permia,&nbsp;with great part of Lapland and Aliatic Bulgaria, ſoon&nbsp;ſubmitted to him ; and Great Novogorod, a city then&nbsp;ſo famous that the Ruffians uſed to expreſs its vaſt importance by the proverbial expreſſion of, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Who can re-ββ God and the Great Novogorod ?</span><span class="font0"> was reduced by his&nbsp;generals after a ſeven years ſiege, and yielded him an&nbsp;immenſe treaſure ; no leſs, ſay ſome writers, than 300&nbsp;cart loads of gold and ſilver, and other valuable effects.&nbsp;Alexander Witold, waiwode of Lithuania, was in poſe&nbsp;ſeſſion of this rich place, from which he had exacted&nbsp;for ſome years an annual tribute of 100,coo rubles, a&nbsp;prodigious ſum for thoſe days and ſor that country.&nbsp;When it was taken by John Baſilovitz, he, the better to ſecure his conqueſt, put it under the protection&nbsp;ol the Poles, voluntarily rendered himſelf their tributary for it, and accepted a governor from the hand of&nbsp;their king Caſimir, a weak and indolent prince, from&nbsp;whom he well knew he had nothing to fear. The No-</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">vogorodians continued to enjoy all their privileges till about two years after ; when John, ambitious of reigning without controul, entered their city with a numerous retinue, under pretence of keeping to the Greek&nbsp;faith, he being accuſed of an intention to embrace the&nbsp;Romiſh religion ; and with the aſſiſtance of the archbiſhop&nbsp;Theophilus, ſtripped them all of their remaining riches.&nbsp;He then depoſed the treacherous prelate, and eſtabliſh-ed over Novogorod new magiſtrates, creatures of his own ;&nbsp;deſtroying at once, by this means, a noble city, which,&nbsp;had its liberties been protected, and its trade encouraged, might have proved to him -an inexhauſtible fund&nbsp;of wealth. All the north beheld with terror and alto-niſhment the rapid increaſe of the victor’s power : foreign nations courted his alliance; and the ſeveral petty&nbsp;princes of Ruſſia ſubmitted to him without reſiſtance,&nbsp;acknowledging themſelves his vaſſals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Poles, however, complained loudly of his late breach of ſaith in regard to Novogorod, and threatened&nbsp;revenge : upon which Baſilovitz, elated with his ſuc-ceſſes, with the riches he had amaſſed, and with the&nbsp;weak condition of moſt of his neighbours, ſent a body&nbsp;of troops into Lithuania, and ſoon became maſter oſ&nbsp;ſeveral oſ its towns. Caſimir applied lor aſſiſtance to&nbsp;Matthias king of Hungary : but was anſwered by this&nbsp;laſt, that his own ſoldiers were quite uadiſciplined ;&nbsp;that his auxiliaries had lately mutinied for want of pay;&nbsp;and that it was impoſſible for him to raiſe a new army&nbsp;out of the neighbouring countries. The Poliſh monarch in this diſtreſs was obliged to purchaſe of John&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">a </span><span class="font0">ceſſation oſ arms for two years, during which the&nbsp;Muſcovite made new acceſſions to his dominions.</span></p><h2><a name="caption1"></a><span class="font1">The dukes of Servia<sub>j</sub> whoſe territories were about</span></h2><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
