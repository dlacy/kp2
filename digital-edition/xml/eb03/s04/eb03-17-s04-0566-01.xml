a compoſition of cauſtic, fixed alkaline ſalt, and oil, ſometimes hard and dry, ſometimes ſoft and liquid ; much uſed in waſhing, whitening linens, and by dyers and fullers.—Soap may be made by ſeveral methods, which, however, all depend upon the ſame principle. The ſoap which is uſed in medicine is made without heat. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Chemistry,</hi> n⁰ 1026.</p><p>In manufactures where large quantities of it are prepared, ſoap is made with heat. A lixivium of quicklime and ſoda is made, but is leſs concentrated than that above referred to, and only ſo much that it can ſuſtain a freſh egg. A part of this lixivium is to be even diluted and mixed with an equal weight of oil of olives. The mixture is to be put on a gentle fire, and agitated, that the union may be accelerated. When the mixture begins to unite well, the reſt of the lixivium is to be added to it ; and the whole is to be digeſted with a very gentle heat, till the ſoap be completely made. A trial is to be made of it, to examine whether the juſt proportion of oil and alkali has been obſerved. Good ſoap of this kind ought to be firm, and very white when cold ; not ſubject to become moiſt by expoſure to air, and entirely miſcible with pure water, to which it communicates a milky appearance, but without any drops of oil floating on the ſurface. When the ſoap has not theſe qualities, the combination has not been well made, or the quantity of ſalt or of oil is too great, which faults muſt be corrected.</p><p>In ſoft or liquid ſoaps, green or black ſoaps, cheaper oils are employed, as oil of nuts, of hemp, of fiſh, &amp; c. Theſe ſoaps, excepting in conſiſtence, are not eſſentially different from white ſoap.</p><p>Fixed alkalis are much diſpoſed to unite with oils that are not volatile, both vegetable and animal, ſince this union can be made even without heat. The compound reſulting from this union partakes at the ſame time of the properties of oil and of alkali ; but theſe properties are modified and tempered by each other, according to the general rule of combinations. Alkali formed into ſoap has not nearly the ſame acrimony as when it is pure ; it is even deprived of almoſt all its cauſticity, and its other ſaline alkaline properties are almoſt entirely aboliſhed. The ſame oil contained in ſoap is leſs combuſtible than when pure, from its union with the alkali, which is an uninflammable body. It is miſcible, or even ſoluble, in water, to a certain degree, by means of the alkali. Soap is entirely ſoluble in ſpirit of wine ; and ſtill better in aquavitae ſharpened by a little alkaline ſalt, according to an obſervation of Mr Geoffroy.</p><p>The manufacture of ſoap in London ſirſt began in the year 1524 ; before which time this city was ſerved with white ſoap from foreign countries, and with grey ſoap ſpeckled with white from Briſtol, which was fold for a penny a pound ; and alſo with black ſoap, which ſold for a halfpenny the pound.</p><p>The principal ſoaps of our own manufacture are the soft, the hard, and the ball ſoap. The ſoft ſoap is either white or green. The proceſs of making each of theſe ſhall now be deſcribed.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Green ſoſt ſoap.</hi> The chief ingredients uſed in making this are lees drawn ſrom pot-aſh and lime, boiled up with tallow and oil. Firſt, the ley of a proper degree of ſtrength (which muſt be eſtimated by the weight of the liquor), and tallow, are put into the copper together, and as ſoon as they boil up the oil is added ; the fire is then damped or flopped up, while the ingredients remain in the copper to unite ; when they are united, the copper is again made to boil, being fed or filled with lees as it boils, till there be a sufficient quantity put into it; then it is boiled off and put into caſks. When this ſoap is firſt made it appears uniform ; but in about a week’s time the tallow ſeparates from the oil into thoſe white grains which we ſee in common ſoap. Soap thus made would appear yellow, but by a mixture of indigo added at the end of the boiling, it is rendered green, that being the colour which reſults from the mixture of yellow and blue.</p><p><hi rend="italic">White ſoap. Of</hi> this one fort is made after the ſame manner as green ſoft ſoap, oil alone excepted, which is not uſed in white. The other sort of white ſoft ſoap is made from the lees of aſhes of lime boiled up two different times with tallow. Firſt, a quantity of lees and tallow are put into the copper together, and kept boiling, being fed with lees as they boil, until the whole is boiled sufficiently ; then the lees are ſeparated or diſcharged from the tallowiſh part, which part is removed into a tub, and the lees are thrown away ; this is called the first <hi rend="italic">half-boil :</hi> then the copper is filled again with freſh tallow and lees, and the firſt half-boil is put out of the tub into the copper a ſecond time, where it is kept boiling with freſh lees and tallow till the ſoap is produced. It is then put out of the copper into the ſame fort of calks as are uſed for green ſoft ſoap. The common ſoft ſoap uſed about London, generally of a greeniſh hue, with ſome white lumps, is prepared chiefly with tallow : a blackiſh fort, more common in ſome other places, is ſaid to be made with whale oil.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Hard ſoap</hi> is made with lees from aſhes and tallow, and is moſt commonly boiled twice : the firſt, called the <hi rend="italic">halſ-boil,</hi> hath the ſame operation as the firſt half-boil of ſoft white ſoap. Then the copper is charged with freſh lees again, and the firſt half boil put into it, where it is kept boiling, and fed with lees as it boils, till it grains or is boiled enough ; then the ley is diſcharged from it, and the ſoap put into a frame to cool and harden. Common ſalt is made uſe oſ for the purpoſe of graining the ſoap ; for when the oil or tallow has been united with the ley, after a little boiling, a quantity of ſalt is thrown into the maſs, which diſſolving readily in water, but not in the oil or tallow, draws out the water in a conſiderable degree, ſo that the oil or tallow united with the ſalt of the ley ſwims on the top. When the ley is of a proper ſtrength, leſs ſalt is neceſſary to raiſe the curd than when it is too weak. It muſt be obſerved, that there is no certain time lor bringing off a boiling of any of theſe forts of ſoap : it frequently takes up part of two days,</p><p><hi rend="italic">Ball ſoap,</hi> commonly uſed in the north, is made with lees from allies and tallow. The lees are put into the copper, and boiled till the watery part is quite gone, and there remains nothing in the copper but a fort of ſaline matter (the very ſtrength or eſſence of the ley) ; to this the tajlow is put, and the copper is kept boiling and ſtirring for above half an hour, in which time<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0573.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s04-0567"/>
the ſoap is made ; and then it is put out of the coper into tubs or baſkets with ſheets in them, and immediately (whilſt ſoft) made into balls. It requires near 24 hours in this proceſs to boil away the watery part of the ley.</p><p>When oil unites with alkali in the formation of ſoap, it is little altered in the connection of its principles ; for it may be ſeparated irons the alkali by decompoſing ſoap with any acid, and may be obtained nearly in its original ſtate.</p><p>Concerning the decompoſition of ſoap by means of acids, we muſt obſerve, firſt, that all acids, even the weakeſt vegetable acids, may occaſion this decompoſition, becauſe every one of them has a greater affinity than oil with fixed alkali. Secondly, theſe acids, even when united with any baſis, excepting fixed alkali, are capable of occaſioning the ſame decompoſition ; whence all ammoniacal ſalts, all ſalts with baſis of earth, and all thoſe with metallic baſes, are capable of decompoſing ſoap, in the ſame manner as disengaged acids are ; with this difference, that the oil ſeparated ſrom the fixed alkali, by the acid of theſe ſalts, may unite more or leſs intimately with the ſubſtance which was the baſis oſ the neutral ſalt employed for the decompoſition.</p><p>Soap may alſo be decompoſed by diſtillation, as Lemery has done. When firſt exposed to fire, it yields a phlegm called by him a <hi rend="italic">ſpirit ;</hi> which nevertheleſs is neither acid nor alkaline, but ſome water which enters into the compoſition of ſoap. It becomes more and more coloured and empyreumatic as the fire is increaſed, which ſhows that it contains the moſt ſubtle part of the oil. It ſeems even to raiſe along with it, by help of the oil and action of the fire, a ſmall part of the alkali of the ſoap : for, as the ſame chemiſt obſerves, it occaſions a precipitate in a ſolution of corroſive ſublimate. After this phlegm the oil riſes altered, preciſely as if it had been distilled from quicklime, that is, empyreumatic, ſoluble in ſpirit of wine, at firſt ſufficiently ſubtle and afterwards thicker. An alkaline reſiduous coal remains in the retort, conſiſting chiefly of the mineral alkali contained in the ſoap, and which may be diſengaged from the coal by calcination in an open fire, and obtained in its pure ſtate.</p><p>Alkaline ſoaps are very uſeful in many arts and trades, and alſo in chemiſtry and medicine. Their principal utility conſiſts in a detersive quality that they receive from their alkali, which, although it is in ſome meaſure ſaturated with oil, is yet capable of acting upon oily matters, and oſ rendering them ſaponaceous and miſcible with water. Hence ſoap is very uſeful to cleanſe any ſubstances from all fat matters with which they happen to be soiled. Soap is therefore daily uſed for the waſhing and whitening of linen, for the cleanſing of woollen- cloths from oil, and for whitening silk and freeing it from the reſinous varniſh with which it is naturally covered. Pure alkaline lixiviums being capable of diſſolving oils more effectually than ſoap, might be employed for the ſame purpoſes ; but when this activity is not mitigated by oil, as it is in ſoap, they are capable of altering, and even of deſtroying entirely by their cauſticity, moſt ſubſtances, eſpecially animal matters, as ſilk, wool, and others : whereas ſoap cleanſes from oil almoſt as effectually as pure alkali, without danger of altering or deſtroying ; which renders it very uſeful.</p><p>Soap was imperfectly known to the ancients. It is mentioned by Pliny as made of fat and aſhes, and as an invention of the Gauls.<note anchored="false" n="1" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>Woodville's Medical Botany, p. 309.</p></note> Aretæus and others inform us, that the Greeks obtained tfieir knowledge of its medical uſe from the Romans. Its virtues, according to Bergius, are detergent, resolvent, and aperient, and its uſe recommended in jaundice, gout, calculous complaints, and in obſtructions of the viſcera. The efficacy of ſoap in the firſt of theſe diſeaſes was experienced by Sylvius, and ſince recommended very generally by various authors who have written on this complaint ; and it has alſo been thought of uſe in ſupplying the place of bile in the primæ vise. The utility of this medicine in icterical cafes was inferred chiefly from its ſuppoſed power of diſſolving biliary concretions ; but this medicine has loſt much of its reputation in jaundice, ſince it is now known that gall-ſtones have been found in many after death who had been daily taking ſoap for ſeveral months and even years. Of its good effects in urinary calculous affections, we have the teſtimony of ſeveral, eſpecially when diſſolved in lime-water, by which its efficacy is conſiderably increaſed ; for it thus becomes a powerful solvent of mucus, which an ingenious modern author ſuppoſes to be the chief agent in the formation of caſe culi : it is, however, only in the incipient ſtate of the diſeaſe that theſe remedies promiſe effectual benefit ; though they generally abate the more violent ſymptoms where they cannot remove the cauſe. With Boerhaave ſoap was a general medicine : for as he attributed moſt complaints to viſcidity of the fluids, he, and moſt of the Boerhaavian ſchool, preſcribed it in conjunction with different reſinous and other ſubſtances, in gout, rheumatiſm, and various viſceral complaints. Soap is alſo externally employed as a resolvent, and gives name to ſeveral officinal preparations.</p><p>From the properties of ſoap we may know that it muſt be a very effectual and convenient anti-acid. It absorbs acids as powerfully as pure alkalis and abſorbent earths, without having the cauſticity of the former, and without oppreſſing the ſtomach by its weight like the latter.</p><p>Laſtly, we may perceive that ſoap muſt be one of the beſt of all antidotes to ſtop quickly, and with the leaſt inconvenience, the bad effects of acid corroſive poisons, as aquafortis, corroſive ſublimate, &amp; c.</p><p>Soap imported is ſubject by 10 Ann. cap. 19. to a duty of 2d. a pound (over and above former duties); and by 12 Ann. ſtat. 2. cap. 9. to the farther ſum of 1 d. a pound. And by the ſame acts, the duty on ſoap made in the kingdom is 1 ½d. a pound. By 17 G. III. cap. 52. no person within the limits of the head office of exciſe in London ſhall be permitted to make any ſoap unleſs he occupy a tenement of 10 l. a year, be aſſeſſed, and pay the pariſh rates; or elſewhere, unless he be aſſeſſed, and pay to church and poor. Places of making are to be entered on pain of 50 l. and covers and locks to be provided under a forfeiture of 100 l. ; the furnace-door of every utenſil uſed in the manufacture of ſoap ſhall be locked by the exciſe officer, as ſoon as the fire is damped or drawn out, and faſtenings provided, under the penalty of 501. ; and opening or damaging ſuch faſtening incurs a penalty of 100 l. Officers are required to enter and ſurvey at all times, by day or night, and the penalty of obſtructing is 20 l. and they may unlock and examine every copper, &amp; c. between the hours of five in the morning and ele<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0574.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s04-0568"/>

Every maker of ſoap before he begins any making, if within the bills of mortality, ſhall give 12 hours, if elſewhere 24 hours, notice in writing to the officer, of the time when he intends to begin, on pain of 50 l. No maker ſhall remove any ſoap unſiirveyed on pain of 20 l. without giving proper notice of his intention. And if any maker ſhall conceal any ſoap or materials, he ſhall forfeit the ſame, and alſo 500l. Every barrel of ſoap ſhall contain 256 lb. avoirdupois, half barrel 128 lb. firkin 64lb. half-firkin 32lb. beſides the weight or tare of each caſk : and all ſoap, excepting hard cake ſoap and ball ſoap, ſhall be put into ſuch caſks and no other, on pain of forfeiture, and 5 l. The maker ſhall weekly enter in writing at the next office the ſoap made by him in each week, with the weight and quantity at each boiling, on pain of 50 l ; and within one week after entry clear off the duties, on pain of double duty.
