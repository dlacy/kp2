In the Kit-cat club he has poured full bottoms chiefly over night-gowns. If thoſe ſtreams of hair were <hi rend="italic">incommode</hi> in a battle, I know nothing (he adds) they were adapted to that can be done in a night-gown. Smith compoſed two large volumes, with proofs of his own plates, for which he asked L. 50. His fineſt works are duke Schomberg on horſeback ; that duke’s ſon and ſuccessor Maynhard ; the earls of Pembroke, Dorſet, and Albemarle ; three plates with two figures in each, of young perſons or children, in which he ſhone ; William Cowper ; Gibbons and his wife; Queen Anne; the duke of Glouceſter, a whole length, with a flowerpot ;a very curious one of Queen Mary, in a high head, fan, and gloves ; the earl of Godolphin ; the ducheſs of Ormond, a whole length, with a black ; Sir George Rooke, &amp;c There is a print by him of James II. with an anchor, but no inſcription ; which not being  finiſhed when the king went away, is ſo ſcarce that it is ſometimes ſold for above a guinea. Smith alſo performed many hiſtoric pieces ; as the loves of the gods, from Titian, at Blenheim, in ten plates; Venus ſtanding in a ſhell, from a picture by Correggio, and many more, of which perhaps the moſt delicate is the holy family with angels, after Carlo Maratti.”</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Smith</hi> (Dr Adam), the celebrated author of the Inquiry into the Nature and Cauſes of the Wealth of Nations, was the only ſon of Adam Smith controller oſ the cuſtoms at Kirkaldy, and of Margaret Douglas daughter of Mr Douglas of Strathenry. He was born at Kirkaldy on the 5th June 1723, a few months after the death of his father. His conſtitution during his infancy was infirm and ſickly, and required all the care oſ his ſurviving parent. When only three years old he was carried by his mother to Strathenry on a viſit to his uncle Mr Douglas ; and happening one day to be amuſing himſelf alone at the door of the houſe, he was ſtolen by a party of thoſe vagrants who in Scotland are called <hi rend="italic">tinkers.</hi> Luckily he was miſſed immediately, and the vagrants purſued and overtaken in Leſlie wood ; and thus Dr Smith was preſerved to extend the bounds of ſcience, and reform the commercial policy of Europe.</p><p>He received the rudiments of his education in the ſchool of Kirkaldy under David Miller, a teacher of conſiderable eminence, and whoſe name deserves to be recorded on account of the great number of eminent men which that ſeminary produced while under his direction. Dr Smith, even while at ſchool, attracted notice by his paſſionate attachment to books, and by the extraordinary powers of his memory ; while his friendly and generous diſpoſition gained and ſecured the affection of his ſchool fellows. Even then he was remarkable for thoſe habits which remained with him through life, of ſpeaking to himſelf when alone and of abſence in company. He was ſent in 1737 to the univerſity of Glaſgow, where he remained till 1740, when he went to Baliol college Oxford, as an exhibitioner on Snell’s foundation. His favourite purſuits while at the univerſity were mathematics and natural philoſophy. After his removal to England he frequently employed himſelf in tranſlating, particularly from the French, with a view to the improvement of his own ſtyle : a practice which he often recommended to all who wiſhed to cul</p><p>tivate the art of compoſition. It was probably then alſo that he applied himſelf with the greateſt care to the ſtudy of languages, of which, both ancient and modern, his knowledge was uncommonly extenſive and accurate.</p><p>After ſeven years reſidence at Oxford he returned to Kirkaldy, and lived two years with his mother without any fixed plan for his future life. He had been deſigned for the church of England ; but disliking the eccleſiaſtical profeſſion, he reſolved to abandon it altogether, and to limit his ambition to the proſpect of obtaining ſome of thoſe preferments to which literary attainments lead in Scotland. In 1748 he fixed his reſidence in Edinburgh, and for three years read a courſe of lectures on rhetoric and belles lettres under the patronage of Lord Karnes. In 1751 he was elected profeſſor of logic in the univerſity of Glaſgow, and the year following was removed to the professorship of moral philosophy, vacant by the death of Mr Thomas Craigie the immediate ſucceſſor of Dr Hutcheſon. In this ſituation he remained 13 years, a period he uſed frequently to look back to as the moſt uſeful part of his life. His lectures on moral philoſophy were divided into four parts: The firſt contained natural theology ; in which he conſidered the proofs of the being and attributes of God, and thoſe truths on which religion is founded : the ſecond comprehended ethics, ſtrictly ſo called, and conſiſted chiefly of thoſe doctrines which he afterwards publiſhed in his theory of moral ſentirnertts : in the third part he treated more at length of that part of morality called <hi rend="italic">justice ;</hi> and which, being ſuſceptible of preciſe and accurate rules, is for that reaſon capable of a full and accurate explanation : in the laſt part of his lectures he examined thoſe political regulations which are founded, not upon the principle of juſtice, but of expediency ; and which are calculated to increaſe the riches, the power, and the prosperity of a ſtate. Under this view he conſidered the political inſtitutions relating to commerce, to finances, to eccleſiaſtical and military governments : this contained the subſtance of his W<hi rend="italic">ealth of Nations.</hi> In delivering his lectures he truſted almoſt entirely to extemporary elocution : his manner was plain and unaffected, and he never failed to intereſt his hearers. His reputation ſoon roſe very high, and many ſtudents reſorted to the univerſity merely upon his account.</p><p>When his acquaintance with Mr Hume firſt commenced is uncertain, but it had ripened into friendſhip before the year 1752.</p><p>In 1759 he publiſhed his Theory of Moral Sentiments ; a work which deſervedly extended his reputation : for, though ſeveral of its conclusions be ill- founded, it muſt be allowed by all to be a lingular effort of invention, ingenuity, and ſubtilty. Beſides, it contains a great mixture of important truth ; and, tho' the author hits ſometimes been misled, he has had the merit of directing the attention of philoſophers to a view of human nature, which had formerly in a great meaſure eſcaped their notice. It abounds everywhere with the pureſt and moſt elevated maxims concerning the practical conduct of life; and when the ſubject of his work leads him to addreſs the imagination and the heart, the variety and felicity of his illuſtrations, the richneſs and fluency of his eloquence, and the skill with</p></body></text></TEI>
