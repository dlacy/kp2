<p><span class="font0">would not permit him at firſt to combat, except with ſlaves, againſt whom his ſtrength appeared aſtoniſhing.&nbsp;He overcame 16 in running, one after the other : he&nbsp;then kept up with the emperor on horſeback ; and having fatigued him in the courſe, he was oppoſed to ſeven of the moſt active ſoldiers, and overcame them with&nbsp;the greateſt eaſe. From that time he was particularly&nbsp;noticed, and taken into the emperor’s body-guards, in&nbsp;which his aſſiduity and prompt obedience were particularly remarkable. In the reign of Caracalla, he was&nbsp;made a centurion, and diſtinguiſhed himſelf in this ſtation by his ſtrict attention to the morals and diſcipline&nbsp;of thoſe he commanded. When made a tribune, he&nbsp;ſtill retained the hard ſimplicity of his life ; eat as the&nbsp;meaneſt centinel ; ſpent whole days in exerciſing his&nbsp;troops ; and would now and then himſelf wreſtle with&nbsp;eight or ten of the ſtrongeſt men in the army, whom&nbsp;he threw with ſcarce any effort. Being thus become&nbsp;one of the moſt remarkable men in the empire, both for&nbsp;courage, diſcipline, and perſonal activity, he gave, ſhoit-ly after, a very high inſtance of his unſhaken fidelity :&nbsp;for when Macrinus was made emperor, he refuſed to&nbsp;ſerve under a prince that had betrayed his ſovereign ;&nbsp;and retired to Thrace, his native country, where he followed commerce, and purchaſed ſome lands, content&nbsp;with privacy rather; than a guilty dependence. Upon&nbsp;the acceſſion of Heliogabalus to the throne, this bold&nbsp;veteran once more returned to the army ; but was, in&nbsp;the very beginning, diſguſted at the baſe effeminacy of&nbsp;the emperor; who, hearing amazing inſtances of his&nbsp;ſtrength, aſhed him, if he were equally capable in combats of another nature ? This lewd demand was ſo little&nbsp;ſuitable to the temper of Maximimrs, that he inſtantly&nbsp;left the court. Upon the death of Heliogabalus, he&nbsp;again returned to Rome, and was received with great&nbsp;kindneſs by Alexander, who particularly recommended him to the ſenate, and made him commander of the&nbsp;fourth legion, which conſiſted of new-raiſed ſoldiers.&nbsp;Maximinus gladly accepted of this charge, and performed his duty with great exactneſs and ſucceſs, ſetting an&nbsp;example of virtue and diſcipline to all the commanders&nbsp;of the army. Nor was his valour leſs apparent againſt&nbsp;the Germans, whither he was ſent with his legion ; ſo&nbsp;that he was unanimouſly conſidered as the boldeſt, braveſt, moſt valiant, and moſt virtuous ſoldier in the&nbsp;whole empire. He ſoon, however, forfeited all theſe&nbsp;juſtly merited titles, when he was raiſed to the throne ;&nbsp;and, from being the moſt loved commander in the army, he became the moſt cruel tyrant upon earth. Yet&nbsp;in fact, his former virtues were all of the ſevere and rigid kind, which, without any education, might very&nbsp;eaſily degenerate into tyranny ; ſo that he might have&nbsp;miſtaken his ſucceeding cruelty for diſcipline, and his&nbsp;ſeverity for juſtice. However this he, Maximinus is&nbsp;conſidered as one of the greateſt monſters of cruelty&nbsp;that ever diſgraced power ; and, fearful of nothing himſelf, he ſeemed to ſport with the terrors of all mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">He began his reign, by endeavouring to force obedience from every rank of people, and by vindicating his authority by violence. The ſenate and people of&nbsp;Rome were the firſt that incurred his reſentment.&nbsp;They utterly refuſing to confirm the election of the&nbsp;army, he was the firſt emperor who reigned without&nbsp;their concurrence or approbation. However, he ſeem</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">ed regardleſs of their oppoſition, proceeding to ſecure his election by putting all ſuch to death as had been&nbsp;raiſed by his predeceſſor. The Chriſtians alſo, having&nbsp;found favour in the former reign, felt the weight of&nbsp;his reſentment ; and were perſecuted in ſeveral parts of&nbsp;the empire, particularly in thoſe where he himſelf reſided. His cruelty likewiſe extended to the rich, whoſe&nbsp;lives and eſtates became a frequent ſacriſice to avarice&nbsp;and ſuſpicion. But what appears ſtill a more extraordinary inſtance of his cruelty, being aſhamed of the&nbsp;meanneſs of his extraction, he commanded all ſuch as&nbsp;were beſt acquainted with him and his parentage to be&nbsp;ſlain, although there were ſome among the number that&nbsp;had relieved him in his low condition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">However, his cruelties did not retard his military operations, which were carried on with a ſpirit becoming a better monarch. He overthrew the Germans&nbsp;in ſeveral battles, waſted all their country with fire&nbsp;and ſword for 400 miſeo together, and ſet a reſolution&nbsp;of ſubduing all the northern nations as far as the&nbsp;ocean. In theſe expeditions, in order to attach the&nbsp;ſoldiers more firmly to him, he increaſed their pay ;&nbsp;and in every duty of the camp, he himſelſ took as&nbsp;much pains as the meaneſt centinel in his army, ſhowing incredible courage and aſſiduity. In every engagement, where the conflict was hotteſt, Maximinus was&nbsp;always ſeen fighting there in perſon, and deſtroying&nbsp;all before him : ſor, being bred a barbarian, he conſidered it as his duty to combat as a common ſoldier,&nbsp;while he commanded as a general.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the mean time, his cruelties had ſo alienated the minds of his ſubjects, that ſeveral conſpiracies were&nbsp;ſecretly aimed againſt him. Magnus, a conſular perſon, and ſome others, had plotted to break down a&nbsp;wooden bridge, as ſoon as the emperor had paſſed it,&nbsp;and thus to abandon him to the enemy. But this being diſcovered, gave Maximinus an opportunity of indulging his natural ſeverity, upon this pretext alone&nbsp;cauſing above 4000 to be ſlain. Shortly after, ſome of&nbsp;Alexander’s old ſoldiers withdrawing themſelves from&nbsp;the camp, proclaimed one Quarcianus as emperor, who&nbsp;had been lately diſguſted at Maximinus for being diſmiſſed from employment. The ſoldiers, in fact, conſtrained him to accept of the dangerous ſuperiority to&nbsp;which he was expoſed : and ſhortly after, in the ſpirit&nbsp;of the times, the perſon who had been the promoter&nbsp;of his advancement, murdered him in his bed, and carried his head to Maximinus ; who received him kindly&nbsp;at firſt, but ſoon put him to a cruel death, for his complicated guilt of treaſon and treachery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Theſe partial inſurrections were ſoon after followed by a ſpirit of general diſcontent throughout all the&nbsp;empire. The provinces of Africa were the firſt that&nbsp;ſhowed their deteſtation of the tyrant, whoſe extortions&nbsp;and cruelties among them were become inſupportable.&nbsp;They firſt flew his procurator ; and afterwards conſidering how dangerous a crime they had committed, they&nbsp;reſolved to throw off all expectations of pardon, and&nbsp;create a new emperor. Gordien was then , proconſul&nbsp;of Africa, a perſon of great ſame for his virtues, and&nbsp;highly reverenced for a blameleſs life of near 80.&nbsp;Him, therefore, they determined to elect ; and accordingly the ſoldiers and natives aſſembling together,&nbsp;tumultuouſly entered his houſe, reſolved to put. their&nbsp;deſign in execution. Gordian, who. at firſt ſuppoſed</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
