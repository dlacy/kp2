Mārūthā died in 649. His life was written by his successor Denhā.@@<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> Mārūthā compiled a liturgy and wrote a commentary on the Gospels, both of which are sometimes wrongly assigned to the elder Mārūthā of Maiperkat.@@<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> He was also the author of short discourses ou New (or Low) Sunday, and on the consecration of the water on the eve of the Epiphany, as well as of some hymns and sedrās.@@<hi rend="superscript">4</hi></p><p>Contemporary with Mārūthā, under the patriarch Athanasius Gammālā (died in 631@@<hi rend="superscript">5</hi>) and his successor John, flourished Severus Sēbōklit@@® of Nisībis,@@<hi rend="superscript">7</hi> bishop of the convent of Ken-neshrē, at this time one of the chief seats of Greek learning in western Syria.@@<hi rend="superscript">8</hi> He devoted himself, as might be expected, to philosophical and mathematical as well as theological studies.@@<hi rend="superscript">9</hi> Of the first we have specimens in his treatise on the syllogisms in the <hi rend="italic">Analytica Priora</hi> of Aristotle, his commentary on the ∏epi <hi rend="italic">epμηveias,</hi> and his letters to the priest Aitīlāhā of Mosul on certain terms in the ∏epl <hi rend="italic">epμηveιas, </hi>and to the periodeutes Yaunān or Jonas on some points in the logic of Aristotle.@@<hi rend="superscript">10</hi> Of his astronomical and geographical studies there are a few examples in Brit. Mus. Add. 14538, ff. 153-155,@@<hi rend="superscript">11</hi> such as whether the heaven surrounds the earth in the form of a wheel or sphere, on the habitable and uninhabitable portions of the earth, on the measurement of the heaven and the earth and the space between them, and on the motions of the sun and moon.@@<hi rend="superscript">12</hi> In the Royal Library at Berlin there is a short treatise of his on the astrolabe.@@<hi rend="superscript">13 </hi>More or less theological in their nature are his letter to the priest and periodeutes Basil of Cyprus, on the 14th of Nisan, A.

He is better known as the author of numerous sedrās and other prayers, whence he is commonly called Yōhan- nān dé-sedhrau(hī), or “John of the Sedrās.” He also drew up a liturgy.@@<hi rend="superscript">19</hi></p><p>During the second quarter of this century, from 633 to 636, the Muhammadan conquest of Syria took place. The petty Arab kingdoms of the Lakhmites (al-Ḥīrah), the ThaTabites and Kindites, and the Ghassānites, as well as the wandering tribes of Mesopotamia, were absorbed ; and the Persians were beaten back into their own country, quickly to be overrun in its turn. The year 638 witnessed the last effort of the Greek empire to wrest Syria from the invaders ; the Muslim yoke was no longer to be shaken off. The effects of this conquest soon begin to make themselves manifest in the literature of the country. The more the Arabic language comes into use, the more the Syriac wanes and wastes away; the more Muhammadan literature flourishes, the more purely Christian literature pines and dwindles ; so that from this time on it becomes necessary to compile grammars and dictionaries of the old Syriac tongue, and to note and record the correct reading and pronunciation of words in the Scriptures and other books, in order that the understanding of them may not be lost.</p><p>Among the small band of Monophysite scholars who made themselves conspicuous during the latter half of the 7th century the most famous name is that of Jacob of Edessa.@@<hi rend="superscript">20</hi> He was a native of 'En-dēbhā (the Wolf’s well), a village in the district of Gumyah (al-Jūmah), in the province of Antioch. The date of his birth is not mentioned, but it may have been about 640 or a little earlier.@@<hi rend="superscript">21 </hi>He studied under Severas Sēbōklit at the famous convent of Ken- neslirē, where he learned Greek and the accurate reading of the</p><p>Scriptures. Thence he went to Alexandria, but we are not told how long he remained there. After his return to Syria he was appointed bishop of Edessa in 679-680@@<hi rend="superscript">22</hi> ; but Bar-Hebræus says that he was ordained by the patriarch Athanasius II., 684-687, which seems more probable, as they were intimate friends. If he was appointed in 684, the three or four years for which he held this office would terminate in 687-688, in which latter year Julian llōmāyā (or “ the Soldier ”)@@<hi rend="superscript">23</hi> was elected patriarch. Apparently Jacob was very strict in the enforcement of canonical rales, and thereby offended a portion of his clergy. He would seem to have appealed to the patriarch and his fellow-bishops, who were in favour of temporizing ; whereupon Jacob burnt a copy of the rales before the gate of Julian’s convent, at the same time crying aloud, “ I burn with fire as superfluous and useless the canons which ye trample under foot and heed not.” He then betook himself to the convent at Kaisūm, a town near Samosāta, and Habbibh was appointed to Edessa in his stead. After a while the’ monks of Eusēbhōnā invited Jacob to their convent, and there he taught for eleven years the Psalms and the reading of the Scriptures in Greek, the study of which language had fallen into desuetude. Owing to disputes with some of the brethren “who hated the Greeks,” he left this house and went to the great convent at Tell- 'Addā, where he worked for nine years more at his revised version of the Old Testament.@@<hi rend="superscript">24</hi> On the death of Habbibh Jacob was recalled to Edessa, where he resided for four months, at the end of which time he returned to Tell-'Addā to fetch his library and pupils, but died there on 5th June 708.@@<hi rend="superscript">25</hi> In the literature of his country Jacob holds much the same place as Jerome among the Latin fathers. He was, for his time, a man of great culture and wide reading, being familiar with Greek and with older Syriac writers. Of Hebrew he probably understood veιy little, but he was always ready, like Aphraates, to avail himself of the aid of Jewish scholars, whose opinion he often cites. He appears before us as at once theologian, historian, philosopher, and grammarian, as a translator of various Greek works, and as the indefatigable correspondent of many students who sought his advice and assistance from far and near. As a theologian, Jacob wrote commentaries on the Old and New Testaments, which are cited by later authors, such as Dionysius bar Salibi@@<hi rend="superscript">26</hi> and Bar-Hebræus, as well as in the large <hi rend="italic">Catena</hi> of the monk Severus@@<hi rend="superscript">27</hi>, further, scholia on the whole Scriptures, of which specimens may be found in <hi rend="italic">S. Ephraemi Opera Syr.</hi>@@<hi rend="italic superscript">a</hi> and in Phillips’s <hi rend="italic">Scholia on some Passages of the Old Testament </hi>(18 64).@@<hi rend="superscript">29</hi> His discourses on the six days of creation are extant at Leyden and Lyons.@@<hi rend="superscript">30</hi> This was his latest work, being unfinished at the time of his death ; it was completed by his friend George, bishop of the Arab tribes. Like many other doctors of the Syrian Church, Jacob drew up an anaphora or liturgy,@@<hi rend="superscript">31</hi> and revised the liturgy of St James, the brother of our Lord.@@<hi rend="superscript">32</hi> He also composed orders of baptism,@@<hi rend="superscript">33</hi> of the consecration of the water on the eve of the Epiphany,@@<hi rend="superscript">34 </hi>and of the solemnization of matrimony,@@<hi rend="superscript">35</hi> with which we may connect his translation of the order of baptism of Severas@@<hi rend="superscript">36</hi> and the tract upon the forbidden degrees of affinity.@@<hi rend="superscript">37</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Book of Treasures</hi>@@<hi rend="italic">^ </hi>contained expositions of the Eucharistic service, of the consecration of the water, and of the rite of baptism, probably identical with or similar to those which are found separately in MSS.@@<hi rend="superscript">39</hi> He likewise arranged the horologium or canonical hours of the ferial days,@@<hi rend="superscript">40</hi> and drew up a calendar of feasts and saints’ days for the whole year.@@<hi rend="superscript">41 </hi>Of his numerous canons,@@<hi rend="superscript">42</hi> those addressed to the priest Addai have been edited by Lamy, <hi rend="italic">Dissert, de Syrorum Fide,</hi> &amp;c., p. 98 <hi rend="italic">sq., </hi>and De Lagarde, <hi rend="italic">Reliquiæ Diris Eccles.
