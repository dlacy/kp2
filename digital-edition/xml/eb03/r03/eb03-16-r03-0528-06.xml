<p><label>ROUEN</label>
a city of France, and capital of Normandy, had an archbiſhop’s ſee, a parliament, a mint, a handſome college, an academy, two abbeys, and an old caſtle. It is ſeven miles in circumference, and ſurround-cd with fix ſuburbs ; and contained before the revolution 3$ pariſhes, and 24 convents for men and women. The metropolitan church has a very handſome,front, on which are two loſty ſteeples, whence there is a fine view of the town and Country. The great bell is 13 feet high and 11 in diameter. The church of the Be-nedictne abbey is much admired by travellers. The parliament-houſe is adorned with beautiful tapeſtry and fine pictures. There ure a great number of foun</p><p>tains, though the houſes are ordinary ; but the walk upon the quay is very pleaſant, and there are 13 gates from thence into the city. The number of the inhabitants are about 60,000, and they have ſeveral woollen manufactures. It is ſeated on the river Seine ; and the tide riſes ſo high, that veſſels of 2oo tons may come up to the quay : but one of the greateſt curiofι-ties is the bridge, of 270 paces in length, ſupported by boats, and conſequently is higher or lower according to the tide. It is paved, and there are ways for foot-paſſengers on each ſide, with benches to fit upon ; and coaches may paſs over it at any hour of the day or night. It is often called <hi rend="italic">Roan</hi> by Engliſh hiſtorians ; and is 50 miles ſouth-weft of Amiens, and 70 north-weft of Paris.</p><p>Though large, and enriched by commerce, Rouen 19 not an elegant place. The ſtreets are alinoſt all narrow, crooked, and dirty ; the buildings old and irregular. It was fortified by St Louis in 1253, but the walls are now demoliſhed. The environs, more peculiarly the hills which overlook the Seine, are wonderfully agreeable, and covered with magnificent villas. E» Long. ί. 10. N. Lat. 49. 26.</p>
