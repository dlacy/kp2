<p><span class="font3">RECOVERY, or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Common </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">Recovery,</span><span class="font3"> in Engliſh law, a ſpecies of aſſurance by matter of record ; concerning&nbsp;the original of which it muſt be remarked, that com-mon recoveries were invented by the eccleſiaſtics to&nbsp;elude the ſtatutes of mortmain (ſee Tail) ; and after-wards encouraged by the ſineſſe of the courts of law in&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">1</span><span class="font3">2 Edward IV. in order to put an end to all fettered iα-heritances, and bar not only eſtates-tail, but alfo all re-mainders and reverſions expectant thereon, we have&nbsp;here, therefore, only to conſider, ſirſt, the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">nature</span><span class="font3"> of a&nbsp;common recovery ; apd, ſecondly, its </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">force</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">effect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I. A common recovery is a fuit or action, either ac-tual or fictitious : and in it the lands are recovered againſt the tenant of the freehold; which recovery,&nbsp;being a ſuppoſed abjudication of the right, binds all&nbsp;perſons, and veſts a free and abſolute fee-ſimple in the&nbsp;recoverer. To explain this as clearly and conciſely as&nbsp;poſſible, let us, in the ſirſt place, ſuppoſe David Edwards&nbsp;to be tenant of the freehold, and deſirous to fuſſer a&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">common recovery, in order to bar, 'alj entails, remain-</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font3">ders, and reverſions, and to convey the fame in feeſſimple, to Francis Golding. To effect this, Golding is to bring&nbsp;an action againſt him for the lands ; and he accordingly&nbsp;ſues out a writ called a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">prœâpe quod reddat,</span><span class="font3"> becauſe theſe&nbsp;were its initial or moſt operative words when the law-proceedings were in Latin. In this writ the demand-ant Golding alleges, that the defendant Edwards (here&nbsp;called the tenant) has no legal title to the land ; but&nbsp;that he came into poſſeſſion of it after one Hugh Hunt&nbsp;had turned the demandant out of it. The ſubſequent&nbsp;proceedings are made up into a record or recovery roll,&nbsp;in which the writ and complaint of the demandant are&nbsp;</span><span class="font4">ſiiſt </span><span class="font3">recited : whereupon the tenant appears, and calls&nbsp;upon one Jacob Morland, who is ſuppoſed, at the ori-ginal purchaſe, to have warranted the title to the te-riant ; and thereupon he prays, that the ſaid Jacob&nbsp;Morland may be called in to defend the title which he&nbsp;ſo warranted. This is called the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">voucher,</span><span class="font3"> <sup>&lt;¢</sup> vocatio,”&nbsp;or calling of Jacob Morland to warranty ; and Morland&nbsp;is called the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">vouchee.</span><span class="font3"> Upon this Jacob Morland, the&nbsp;vouchee, appears, is impleaded, and. defends the title,&nbsp;whereupon Golding the demandant deſires leave of the&nbsp;court to imparl, or confer with the vouchee in private ;&nbsp;which is (as uſual) allowed him. And ſoon afterwards&nbsp;the demandant Goldirtg returns to court ; but Morland&nbsp;the vouchee difappears, or makes default, whereupon&nbsp;judgment is given for the demandant Golding, now call··&nbsp;ed the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">recοvεrlr,</span><span class="font3"> to recover the lands in queſtion againſt&nbsp;the tenant Edwards, who is now the recoveree : and.&nbsp;Edwards has judgment to recover of Jacob Morland&nbsp;lands of· equal value, in recompenſe for the lands ſo&nbsp;warranted by him, and now loſt by his default ; which&nbsp;is agreeable to the doctrine of warranty mentioned in&nbsp;the preceding chapter. This is called the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">recompenfe,&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">recovery-in value.</span><span class="font3"> But Jacob Morland having no&nbsp;lands of his own,'being uſually the crier of the cour£,&nbsp;who, from being frequently thus vouched, is called the&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">common vouchee,</span><span class="font3"> it is plain that Edwards has only </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">nominal 'recompenſe for the lands ſo recovered againſt&nbsp;him by Golding ; which lands are now abſolutely veſt-ed in the ſaid recoverer by judgment of law, and feiiin&nbsp;thereof is delivered by the ſheriſſ of the county. So&nbsp;that this colluſive recovery operates merely in the nature&nbsp;of a conveyance in fee-ſimple, from Edwards the tenant&nbsp;in tail to Golding the purchafer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The recovery here deſcribed, is with a ſingle vouch-er only;-'but ſometimes it is with a double, treble, or farther voucher, as the exigency of the cale may require.&nbsp;And indeed it is now uſual always to have a recovery&nbsp;with double voucher at the leaſt : by ſirſt conveying an&nbsp;eſtate of freehold to any indifferent perſon, againſt whom&nbsp;the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">pradpe</span><span class="font3"> is brought ; and then he vouches the tenant&nbsp;in tail, who vouches over the common vouchee. For,&nbsp;if a recovery be had immediately againſt tenant in tail,&nbsp;it bars only ſuch eſtate in the premiſes of which he 13&nbsp;then actually ſeifed ; whereas if the recovery be had&nbsp;againſt another perſon, and the tenant in tail be vouched, it bars every latent right and intereſt which he may&nbsp;have in the&quot; lands recovered. If Edwards therefore be&nbsp;tenant of the freehold in poſſeſſion, and John Barker&nbsp;be tenant in tail in remainder, here Edwards doth ſirſt&nbsp;vouch Barker, and then Barker vouches Jacob Morland&nbsp;the common vouchee ; who is always the laſt perſon&nbsp;vouched, and always makes default ; whereby the de-</span><span class="font1">maπdant Golding recovers the </span><span class="font3">land againſt the tenant</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
