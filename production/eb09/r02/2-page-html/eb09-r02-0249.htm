<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Law of the Family Relations.—</span><span class="font1">So far as appears no serious inroad was made by the XII. Tables on the law&nbsp;affecting husband and wife, unless in the recognition of the&nbsp;legality of marriage entered into without any solemnity,&nbsp;and not involving that subjection of the wife to the husband </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(gnanus)</span><span class="font1"> which was a necessary consequence of the&nbsp;patrician confarreation and plebeian coemption. These&nbsp;were left untouched. But it seems to have become a&nbsp;practice with some of the plebeians to tie the marriage&nbsp;bond rather loosely in the first instance,—possibly (as&nbsp;became quite general at a later period) in consequence of&nbsp;objection by the women to renounce their independence&nbsp;and right to retain their own property and earnings,&nbsp;more probably because taking a woman to be merely the&nbsp;mother of their children </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(gnatrimoηium)</span><span class="font1"> had been forced&nbsp;upon them before coemption had been introduced as a&nbsp;means of making her a lawful wife, and so they had become&nbsp;in a manner habituated to it. But there seems also to have&nbsp;been an idea that, as a man might acquire the ownership&nbsp;of a thing to which his legal title was defective by prolonged possession of it, so he might acquire </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">manus,</span><span class="font1"> with&nbsp;all its consequences, over the woman with whom he had&nbsp;thus informally united himself by prolonged cohabitation&nbsp;with her as his wife. This had become customary law.&nbsp;The Tables accepted it ; all that was needed was to define&nbsp;the conditions under which </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">manus</span><span class="font1"> should be held to have&nbsp;been superinduced, and the wife converted from a doubtful&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">uxor</span><span class="font1"> into a lawful </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rnaterfamilias.</span><span class="font1"> Hence the provision&nbsp;that, if a woman, married neither by confarreation nor&nbsp;coemption, desired to retain her independence, she must&nbsp;periodically absent herself for three nights from her husband’s house </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{trinoctialis usutpatio),—</span><span class="font1">twelve months’ uninterrupted cohabitation being required to give him that&nbsp;power over her which would have been created instantly&nbsp;had the marriage been accompanied by either of the&nbsp;recognized solemnities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Amongst the fragments of the Tables so industriously collected there is none that refers to a wife’s marriage portion bdos) ; but it&nbsp;is hardly conceivable that it was as yet unknown. Justinian says&nbsp;that in ancient times it was regarded as a donation to the husband&nbsp;with his wife, rather than as a separate estate that was to be used&nbsp;by him while the marriage lasted but to revert to her or her representatives on its dissolution. And it is easy to see that, where&nbsp;there was mαηus, the wife becoming a member of her husband’s&nbsp;family and everything of hers becoming his, such must originally&nbsp;have been its character. Rut even then, when a man gave his&nbsp;daughter {filiafamilias)—who could have nothing of her own—in&nbsp;marriage, and promised her husband a portion with her, there&nbsp;must have been some process of law for compelling him to pay it ;&nbsp;and Voigt’s conjecture that an actio dixtae dotis was employed for&nbsp;the purpose has much in its favour. As regards divorce, Cicero&nbsp;alludes vaguely to a provision in the Tables about a man depriving&nbsp;his wife of the house-keys and turning her out of doors, with some&nbsp;such words as “ take what is thine and get thee gone.” This cannot have applied to confarreate marriages, which could be dissolved&nbsp;only by the religious ceremony of diffarreation. And even as regards&nbsp;other marriages the statement of the historians is that divorces&nbsp;were few and far between until the 6th century of the city, and&nbsp;that, until the same date, any man who turned his wife away,&nbsp;however serious the ground, without the cognition of the family&nbsp;council was liable to penalties at the hands of the censors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Of the two or three provisions of the Tables that affected details of the ρatria potestas, which itself was assumed to be so well established by customary law as to need no statutory sanction or definition, one was in the words “si paterfamilias ter filium venum&nbsp;duit, a patre filius liber esto. ” This came to be construed by the&nbsp;jurists as meaning that so powerful λvas the bond of the ρotestas&nbsp;that it could not definitively be loosed until the father had three&nbsp;times gone through the process of fictitious sale by which emancipation was effected. But the conception of the law seems to indicate&nbsp;that its original purpose must have been rather to confer a benefit&nbsp;on a son in potestate, by declaring him ipso jure free from it on a&nbsp;certain event, than to place difficulties in the way of his emancipation. “If a house-father have thrice sold his son, the latter shall be&nbsp;free from his father.” It reads as if the intention were to rescue the&nbsp;son from what, by its frequent repetition, was suggestive of a total&nbsp;absence of parental affection rather than reluctant obedience to overwhelming necessity. May not its object have been to restrain the&nbsp;practice, which prevailed to a late period in the empire, of men giving&nbsp;their children to their creditors in security for their loans,—a process&nbsp;that, at the time of the Tables, could be effected only by an actual&nbsp;transfer of the child per aes et libram as a free bondman (mancipii&nbsp;causa), under condition of reconveyance when the loan was repaid ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The nature of the relation between master and slave, like that of manus and patria potestas, seems also to have been too notorious to&nbsp;require exposition in the Tables. We find recorded only two references to it, one dealing with the case of a slave who had a conditional testamentary gift of freedom (ptalu liber), the other with&nbsp;noxal surrender jιoxαx deditw). The provision about noxal surrender in all probability was not limited to a slave ; it was to the&nbsp;effect that, if a member of a man’s family (familiaris, i.e., a son or&nbsp;a daughter in potestate or a slave) committed a theft from or did&nbsp;mischief to property belonging to a third party, or a domestic&nbsp;animal belonging to one man did harm to another, the father of&nbsp;the delinquent child, or the owner of the slave or animal, should&nbsp;either surrender him or it to the person injured or make reparation&nbsp;in damages. In course of time the surrender came to be regarded&nbsp;as a means of avoiding the primary obligation of making reparation.&nbsp;But comparative jurisprudence recognizes in the enactment of the&nbsp;Tables a modified survival of the ancient right of an injured party&nbsp;to have the delinquent corpus,—man, beast, or thing,—given up to&nbsp;him to wreak his revenge upon it privately, the modification consisting in the alternative of reparation offered to the owner. This&nbsp;noxal surrender, failing reparation, had gone out of use in the case&nbsp;of daughters in potestate before the time of Gaius, and in the case&nbsp;of sons before that of Justinian ; but the law remained unchanged&nbsp;so far as slaves and domestic animals were concerned even in that&nbsp;emperor’s legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Guardianship and the Introduction of the Order of Agnates. </span><span class="font1">—So long as Rome was patrician the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gens</span><span class="font1"> charged itself&nbsp;with the guardianship of a clansman’s orphaned pupil&nbsp;children and his widow and unmarried daughters above&nbsp;pupilarity after his decease </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{tutela),</span><span class="font1"> as well as with that of&nbsp;male members of his family who were </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sui juris,</span><span class="font1"> but above&nbsp;the age of pupilarity, when they chanced to be lunatic, imbecile, prodigal, or helplessly infirm </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{cura, curatio, curatela).&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">That was on the supposition, as regarded children, widow,&nbsp;and unmarried daughters above pupilarity, that no testamentary appointment of tutors by their deceased parent&nbsp;had displaced the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gens,</span><span class="font1"> though whether testamentary nominations were then held competent it is impossible to say.&nbsp;The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gens</span><span class="font1"> in council, in all probability, appointed one of&nbsp;its members to act as tutor or curator as the case might&nbsp;be, itself prescribed his duties, and itself called him to account for any failure in his administration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But, as this gentile tutory could not be extended to the plebeians, among whom some law of guardianship was as&nbsp;much required as among their fellow-citizens of the higher&nbsp;order, the decemvirs found it expedient to devise a new&nbsp;one of universal application. The Tables contained no&nbsp;express authority for testamentary nomination of tutors&nbsp;to the widow of the testator, or to his pupil children and&nbsp;grown-up unmarried daughters ; but such appointment, if&nbsp;unknown previously, was soon held to be justified by a&nbsp;liberal interpretation of the very inclusive provision, “ uti&nbsp;legassit suae rei, ita jus esto.” In the absence of testamentary appointment the nearest male agnates of lawful&nbsp;age were to be tutors. This tutory of agnates was an invention of the decemvirs, just as was the agnates’ right of&nbsp;succession on intestacy. The plebeians had no </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gentes,</span><span class="font1"> at&nbsp;least until a much later period ; so, to make the law equal&nbsp;for all, it was necessary to introduce a new order of heirs&nbsp;and tutors. “Tutores . . . ex lege XII. Tabularum in-troducuntur . . . agnati” is the very notable language&nbsp;of Ulpian. And his words are very similar in speaking&nbsp;of their right of succession ; for, while he says of testamentary inheritances no more than that they were </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">confirmed</span><span class="font1"> by&nbsp;the XII. Tables, he explains that the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">legitimae hereditates&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">of agnates and patrons were </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">derived</span><span class="font1"> from them.</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> The</span></p>
