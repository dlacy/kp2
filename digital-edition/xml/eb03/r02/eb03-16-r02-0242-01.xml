<p><label>RIDLEY</label>
(Nicholas), biſhop of London, and a martyr to the Reformation, was deſcended of an ancient family, and born in the beginning of the l6th century, at Wilmontſwick in Northumberland. From the grammar-ſchool at Newcaſtle upon Tyne, he was lent to Pembroke-hall in Cambridge, in the year 1518, where he was ſupported by his uncle Dr Robert Ridley, fellow of Queen’s college. In 1522 he took his firſt degree in arts ; two years after, was elected fellow ; and, in 1725, he commenced matter of arts. In 1527, having taken orders, he was lent by his uncle, for further improvement, to the Sorbonne at Paris ; from thence he went to Louvain, and continued abroad till the year 1529. On his return to Cambridge, he was choſen under-treaſurer of the univerſity ; and, in 1533. was elected ſenior proctor. He afterwards proceeded bachelor of divinity, and was choſen chaplain of the univerſity, orator, and <hi rend="italic">magijler glomeriœ.</hi> At this time he was much admired as a preacher and diſputant. He loſt his kind uncle in 1536 ; but was ſoon after patroniſed by Dr Cranmer, archbiſhop of Canterbury, who made him his domeſtic chaplain, and preſented him to the vicarage of Herne in Eaſt Kent ; where, we are told, he preached the doctrine of the Reformation. In 154'∙&gt;, having commenced doctor of divinity, he was made king’s chaplain ; and, in the iame year, was elected maſter of his college in Cambridge. Soon after, Ridley was collaced to a prebend in the church of Canterbury ; and it was not long before he was accuſed in the biſhop’s court, at the inſti-gation of biſhop Gardiner, of preaching againſt the doctrine of the Six Articles. The matter being referred to Cranmer, Ridley was acquitted. In 1545, he was made a prebendary of Weſtminſter abbey; in 1547 was preſented, by the fellows of Pembroke-hall, to the living of Soham, in the dioceſe of Norwich ; and the ſame year was conſecrated biſhop of Rocheſter. In 1550 he was tranſlated to the ſee of London; in which year he was one of the commiſſioners for examining biſhop Gardiner, and concurred in his depri-- vation. In the year 1552, our prelate returning from Cambridge, unfortunately for himſelf, paid a viſit to the Princeſs, afterwards Queen Mary ; to whom, prompted by his zeal for reformation, he expreſſed himſelf with too much freedom ; for ſhe was ſcarce-ly ſeated on the throne when Ridley was doomed a victim to her revenge. With Cranmer and Latimer he was burnt alive at Oxford, on the 16th of October <hi rend="italic">355</hi> j. He wrote, 1. A treatiſe concerning images in churches. 3» Brief declaration of the Lord’s Supper,</p><p>3. Certain godly and comfortable conferences between biſhop Ridley and Mr Hugh Latimer, during their impriſonment, 4. A compariſon between the comfortable doctrine of the Goſpel and the traditions of the Popiſh religion ; and other works.</p>
