The hill on which Sessa is situated is a mass of volcanic tufa, in which have been discovered painted chambers erroneously supposed to have belonged to a city covered by a volcanic eruption. The town contains many ancient remains, particularly the ruins of Ponte Aurunca and of an amphitheatre. It is the see of a bishop, has an interesting basilica with three naves, a gymnasium, a technical school, and a seminary. The cathedral contains inscriptions, a mosaic pavement, and a good ambo decorated with mosaics resting on columns. In the principal street are memorial stones with inscriptions in honour of Charles V., surmounted by an old crucifix with a mosaic cross. Exclusive of the environs, the town has a population of 6130. The hills of Sessa are celebrated for their vines, the “Ager Falernus ” of the Romans.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
