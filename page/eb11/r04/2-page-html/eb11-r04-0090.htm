<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bibliography of Ancient Roman Topography.—</span><span class="font1">Amongst ancient writers special mention is due to Varro </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(De Lingua Latina),</span><span class="font1">Dionysius&nbsp;of Halicarnassus </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Antiquitates Romanae),</span><span class="font1"> Ovid </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Fasti),</span><span class="font1"> Vitruvius </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(De&nbsp;Architectura),</span><span class="font1"> Pliny the Elder </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Naturalis Historia),</span><span class="font1"> Frontinus </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(De&nbsp;Aquis)</span><span class="font1"> and the remains of ancient commentaries on Virgil, Horace,&nbsp;&amp;c. The inscriptions found in the city of Rome are contained in&nbsp;vol. VI. of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum.</span><span class="font1"> Many of them&nbsp;arc of the. highest importance for Roman topography, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font1"> the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Basis Capitolina,</span><span class="font1"> preserved in the Palazzo dei.

Vol. XV. of. the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">C.I.L.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">contains the inscriptions stamped on tiles and water-pipes, which&nbsp;are likewise of great importance. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Monumentum Ancyranum&nbsp;(Res gestae divi Augusti,</span><span class="font1"> ed.<sup>3</sup> Mommsen, 1883) reproduces the bronze&nbsp;tablets set up by. Augustus on his mausoleum at Rome, and contains&nbsp;a list of the buildings which he erected or restored. The marble&nbsp;plan of Rome </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Forma urbis Romae,</span><span class="font1"> ed. Jordan, 1874; the more&nbsp;recently discovered fragments have only been published in periodicals)&nbsp;dates from the reign of Septimius Scverus, who restored the building&nbsp;to which it belonged after the fire of 191 </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">B.C. </span><span class="font1">The plan which it&nbsp;replaced was executed by order of Vespasian. The scale was generally 1: 250; it was oriented with S.E. at the top, N.W# at the&nbsp;bottom. Buildings are of course frequently represented on coins&nbsp;and works of art, and these may often be identified with existing&nbsp;remains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the reign of Constantine the Great there was compiled a catalogue of the principal buildings of Rome, arranged according to the fourteen regions of Augustus. This has been preserved in two&nbsp;recensions, one made in </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font1"> 334 and known as the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Notitia,</span><span class="font1"> the second&nbsp;in or about </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font1"> 357, and known as the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Curiosum urbis Romae.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">These are. called the Regionary Catalogues, and contain, besides&nbsp;lists of buildings, statistics as to the number of vici, domus, insulae,&nbsp;&amp;c., in each region, which are of great value. (See Preller, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Regionen&nbsp;der Stadt Rom,</span><span class="font1"> Jena, 1846.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the middle ages, guide-books were written for the use of pilgrims visiting Rome. Besides giving the routes for the principal&nbsp;churches and cemeteries, they mention ancient buildings and give&nbsp;current legends regarding them. The earliest is the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Itinerary of&nbsp;Einsiedeln,</span><span class="font1"> a. MS., of the 8th century preserved in the monastery&nbsp;of Einsiedeln in Switzerland (see C. Huelsen, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">L' Itinerario di Einsiedeln,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">1908). In the 12th century was compiled the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mirabilia urbis&nbsp;Romae,</span><span class="font1"> which became the foundation of later guide-books. The&nbsp;last recension is contained in a MS. of the early 15th century.&nbsp;These and other medieval documents afe printed in Urlichs’ </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Codex&nbsp;Topographicus urbis Romae</span><span class="font1"> (1871). The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ordo Benedicti Canonici&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(see Jordan, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Topographic,</span><span class="font1"> II. I, 646, and Lanciani, AfowMwcw/z&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Anticki,</span><span class="font1"> I. 437)» which gives the route of papal processions, belongs&nbsp;also to the 12th century, and was perhaps written by the author&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mirabilia.</span><span class="font1"> The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Liber Pontificalis</span><span class="font1"> (ed. Duchesne, Paris, 1886;&nbsp;ed. Mommsen, in. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Monumenta Germaniae historica,</span><span class="font1"> vol. i.), which&nbsp;gives the biographies of the early popes and was continued throughout&nbsp;the middle ages, is of value as illustrating the transition from pagan&nbsp;to Christian Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Several early views and plans of Rome exist, beginning with the painting by Cimabue in the upper church of S. Francesco at Assisi&nbsp;(1275). A collection of these was published by De Rossi, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Piante&nbsp;icnografiche e prospettiche di Roma anteriori al secolo XVI.</span><span class="font1"> (1879).&nbsp;Many others have since come to light. (See Huelsen in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Butt. Comm.&nbsp;Arch.,</span><span class="font1"> 1892, p. 38).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In Italian and other libraries are preserved large numbers of plans and drawings from ancient remains by the architects of&nbsp;the 15th and later centuries, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font1"> Bramantino, Fra Giocondo, the&nbsp;members of the families of Sangallo and Peruzzi, Pirro, Ligorio,&nbsp;Palladio, &amp;c. These are of immense value, since the monuments&nbsp;which they drew have to a large extent been destroyed. Unfortunately they are not always trustworthy, especially those of&nbsp;Ligorio. The drawings at Florence have been indexed by Fcrri;&nbsp;amongst recent publications may be noted those of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Codex&nbsp;Escortalensis</span><span class="font1"> by Egger (Vienna, 1905), and of a sketch-book, probably by A. Coner, in the Soane Museum by Dr Ashby, in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Papers&nbsp;of the British School at Rome,</span><span class="font1"> vol. ii. (1903). Amongst the printed&nbsp;works of the early Italian architects may be. named Palladio,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Architettura</span><span class="font1"> (Venice, 1542), and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Terme dei Romani</span><span class="font1"> (London, 1732),&nbsp;Serlio, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Architettura</span><span class="font1"> (Venice, 1545), and Labacco, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">'Architettura ed&nbsp;Antichitä,</span><span class="font1"> (Rome 1557). Engravings of ancient remains in Rome&nbsp;have been published in great numbers since the 16th century; the&nbsp;most important of the earlier collections are the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Speculum Romanae&nbsp;Magnificentiae,a</span><span class="font1"> series extending over many years in the 16th century,&nbsp;and Du Perac’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vestigj di Roma</span><span class="font1"> (1575). To the 18th century belong&nbsp;the etchings of Piranesi, published in several volumes, and still&nbsp;reproduced from the copper-plates by the Calcografia.</span></p><div>

<p><span class="font1">The literature of Roman topography would in itself form a large library; the best bibliographical guide is Mau’.s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Katalog der Bibliothek des k. deutschen archäologischen Instituts in Rom</span><span class="font1"> (1900). The&nbsp;earliest modern work which can be called scientific is Flavio Biondo’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Roma instaurata,</span><span class="font1"> written under Eugenius IV. (1431-1447), first&nbsp;dated edition, 1479. Biondo’s work was based on the study of&nbsp;ancient literary authorities; he was followed in his method and&nbsp;results by the scholars of the 15th and early 16th centuries, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">Pozzo, Leo Battista Alberti and Andrea Fulvio. In the 16th century&nbsp;the study of ancient remains took its place beside that of ancient&nbsp;literature. Marliani, who had followed Biondo in the first edition&nbsp;of his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Antiquae urbis Romae topographia</span><span class="font1"> (1538), issued a second&nbsp;edition in 1544, which contained plans and illustrations. For more&nbsp;than a century his book formed the foundation upon which such&nbsp;writers as Fauno, G. F&amp;bricius, Mauro, Panvinius, &amp;c., raised their&nbsp;works. Unfortunately the Regionary Catalogues were largely&nbsp;interpolated during this period, and published in this form by&nbsp;Panvinius. In 1666 Famiano Nardini's </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Roma antica</span><span class="font1"> appeared,&nbsp;based upon the interpolated version of the Regionary Catalogues;&nbsp;this was productive of disastrous errors, many of which remained&nbsp;uncorrected until our own time. Nardini was followed in the 18th&nbsp;century by such writers as Ficoroni and Vertuti; the most important works of this period were those produced by excavators&nbsp;such as Bianchini </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Il palazzo dei Cesari,</span><span class="font1"> 1738), or independent&nbsp;students of the monuments such as Raphael Fabretti </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(De Columna&nbsp;Trajana,</span><span class="font1"> 1683; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">De Aquis et Aquaeductibus,</span><span class="font1"> 1680). In the 18th&nbsp;century Winckelmann revived interest in ancient, including Roman,&nbsp;art (especially by his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Geschichte der Kunst des Alterthums,</span><span class="font1"> 1764),&nbsp;and his follower, Carlo Fea, inaugurated the era of systematic&nbsp;and scientific excavation, especially in the Forum. In 1829 there&nbsp;was founded the international </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Institute di Corrispondenza Archeologica&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(which in. 1874 became the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Kaiserlich deutsches archäologisches&nbsp;Institut);</span><span class="font1"> in 1830-42 was issued the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Beschreibung der Stadt Rom,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">by Bunsen and others, in which the grosser errors which had passed&nbsp;current since Nardini’s time were corrected. To the same period&nbsp;belong the magnificently illustrated works of Luigi Canina </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Indica-zione di Roma antica,</span><span class="font1"> 1830; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Esposizione topografica,</span><span class="font1"> 1842; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">A rchi-tettura antica,</span><span class="font1"> 1834-44; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Toro Romano,</span><span class="font1"> 1.845; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Edifizj di Roma&nbsp;antica,</span><span class="font1"> 1848-56), the value of which is impaired by their inaccuracy&nbsp;and the imaginative character of the restorations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The books on Roman topography written in the early 19th century, such as those of Antonio Nibby, still pursued the uncritical&nbsp;methods of Nardini; from 1830 onwards, however, we find a series&nbsp;of writers whose work shows the influence of the new criticism.&nbsp;Such were Becker </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Topographie der Stadt Rom,</span><span class="font1"> 1843), Sir Wm. Gell&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Rome and its Vicinity,</span><span class="font1"> 1834; rev. ed. E. H. Bunbury, 1846),&nbsp;Braun </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Rumen und Museen Roms,</span><span class="font1"> 1854), Reber </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Die Ruinen Roms,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">1862) and T. H. Dyer </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(The City of Rome,</span><span class="font1"> 1864).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Since 1861, when excavations were begun on the Palatine at the instance of Napoleon III., under the direction of P. Rosa, the&nbsp;discovery of ancient remains has made constant progress, and the&nbsp;results have been incorporated in a number of works, of which only&nbsp;the most important can be named here. These are: Jordan,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Topographie der Stadt Rom itn Alterthum,</span><span class="font1"> of. which three vols.&nbsp;(11, I2, and II.) appeared in 1871-85, and a third (I3) was written&nbsp;after Jordan’s death by C. Huelsen and published in 1907;&nbsp;Gilbert, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Geschichte und Topographie der Stadt Rom im Alterthum&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(3 vols., 1883-90); the works of Lanciani, especially </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ruins and&nbsp;Excavations of Ancient Rome</span><span class="font1"> (1897) and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Storia degli Scavi</span><span class="font1"> (in progress); O. Richter, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Topographie der Stadt Rom</span><span class="font1"> (ed. 2, 1901);&nbsp;Middleton, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Remains of Ancient Rome (2</span><span class="font1"> vols., 1892). A short&nbsp;handbook may be found in S. B. Platner’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Topography and Monuments of Ancient Rome</span><span class="font1"> (Boston, 1904). For the study of recent&nbsp;discoveries (besides the. special works referred to in the course of&nbsp;this article) the following periodicals are the most important:—&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Notizie degli Scavi,</span><span class="font1"> published by the Accademia dei Lincei since&nbsp;1876; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bullettino della Commissione Archeologica comunale di Roma&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(from 1872); </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mittheilungen des k. deutschen archäologischen Instituts</span></p>
