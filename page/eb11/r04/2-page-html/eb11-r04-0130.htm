                its numbers to 900, and by the admission of old soldiers,&nbsp;sons of freedmen and
                even “ semi-barbarous Gauls.”@@<sup>1</sup> But,&nbsp;though Caesar's high-handed
                conduct in this respect was not&nbsp;imitated by his immediate successors, yet the
                main lines of&nbsp;their policy were laid down by him. These were—(1) the
                municipalization of the old republican constitution, and (2) its&nbsp;subordination
                to the paramount authority of the master of&nbsp;the legions and the provinces. In
                the first case he only carried&nbsp;further a change already in progress. Of late
                years the senate&nbsp;had been rapidly losing its hold over the Empire at large.
                Even&nbsp;the ordinary proconsuls were virtually independent potentates,&nbsp;ruling
                their provinces as they chose, and disposing absolutely&nbsp;of legions which
                recognized no authority but theirs. The&nbsp;consuls and praetors of each year had
                since 81 been&nbsp;stationed in Rome, and immersed in purely
                municipal&nbsp;business; and, lastly, since the enfranchisement of Italy,&nbsp;the

                class="font2"> though still recognized as the ultimate source of&nbsp;all authority,
                had become little more than assemblies of the&nbsp;city populace, and their claim to

        <p><span class="font2">Cicero. The concentration in Caesar’s hands of all authority outside
                Rome completely and finally severed all real connexion&nbsp;between the old
                institutions of the Republic of Rome and the&nbsp;government of the Roman Empire.
                But the institutions of the&nbsp;Republic not merely became, what they had
                originally been,&nbsp;the local institutions of the city of Rome; they were
                also&nbsp;subordinated even within these narrow limits to the paramount authority of
                the man who held in his hands the army&nbsp;and the provinces. Autocratic abroad, at
                home he was the&nbsp;chief magistrate of the commonwealth; and this position
                was&nbsp;marked, in his case as in that of those who followed him, by
                a&nbsp;combination in his person of various powers, and by a general&nbsp;right of
                precedence which left no limits to his authority but&nbsp;such as he chose to impose
                upon himself. During the greater&nbsp;part of his reign he was consul as well as
                dictator. In&nbsp;48, after his victory at Pharsalia, he was given
                the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tribunicia

                chief magistrate of Rome was also the autocratic&nbsp;ruler of the Empire, he wore
                even in Rome the laurel wreath&nbsp;and triumphal dress, and carried the sceptre of

        <p><span class="font2">Nor are we without some clue as to the policy which Caesar had
                sketched out for himself in the administration of the&nbsp;Empire, the government of
                which he had centralized in his&nbsp;own hands. The much-needed work of rectifying
                the frontiers@@<sup>6&nbsp;</sup>he was forced, by his premature death, to leave to
                other hands,&nbsp;but within the frontiers he anticipated Augustus in
                lightening&nbsp;the financial burdens of the provincials,@@<sup>7</sup> and in
                establishing a&nbsp;stricter control over the provincial governors,@@<sup>8</sup>
                while he went&nbsp;beyond him in his desire to consolidate the Empire by
                extending&nbsp;the Roman franchise@@<sup>9</sup> and admitting provincials to a
                share&nbsp;in the government.@@<sup>10</sup> He completed the Romanization of
                Italy&nbsp;by his enfranchisement of the Transpadane Gauls,@@<sup>11</sup> and
                by&nbsp;establishing throughout the peninsula a uniform system of&nbsp;municipal
                government, which under his successors was gradually extended to the
                    provinces.@@<sup>12</sup></span></p><div>
            <p><span class="font2">On the eve of his departure for the East, to avenge the death of
                    Crassus and humble the power of Parthia,</span></p>
            <p><span class="font2">Caesar fell a victim to the wounded pride of the republican
                    nobles; and between the day of his death (March 15, 44) and that on which
                    Octavian defeated&nbsp;Antony at Actium (September 2, 31) lies a
                    dreary&nbsp;period of anarchy and bloodshed.@@<sup>13</sup></span></p>
            <p><span class="font2">For a moment, in spite of the menacing attitude of Caesar’s
                    self-constituted representative Marcus Antonius (Mark&nbsp;Antony), it seemed to
                    one man at least as if the restoration&nbsp;of republican government was
                    possible. With indefatigable&nbsp;energy Cicero strove to enlist the senate, the
                    people, and above&nbsp;all the provincial governors in support of the old
                    constitution.&nbsp;But, though his eloquence now and again carried all before
                    it&nbsp;in senate-house and forum, it was powerless to alter the course&nbsp;of
                    events. By the beginning of 43 civil war had recommenced; in the autumn Antony
                    was already&nbsp;threatening an invasion of Italy at the head of
                    seventeen&nbsp;legions. Towards the end of October Antony and his ally
                    M.&nbsp;Aemilius Lepidus coalesced with the young Octavian, who had&nbsp;been
                    recently elected consul at the age of twenty, in spite of&nbsp;senatorial
                    opposition; and the coalition was legalized&nbsp;by the creation of the
                    extraordinary commission for the&nbsp;“ reorganization of the commonwealth”
                    known as the&nbsp;“Second Triumvirate.”@@<sup>14</sup> It was appointed
                    fora&nbsp;period of five years, and was continued in 37 for five&nbsp;years
                        more.@@<sup>15</sup> The rule of the triumvirs was inaugurated in the Sullan
                    fashion by a proscription, foremost&nbsp;among the victims of which was Cicero
                        himself.@@<sup>16</sup> In the next&nbsp;year the defeat of M. Junius Brutus
                    and C. Cassius Longinus&nbsp;at Philippi, by the combined forces of Octavian and
                    Antony,&nbsp;destroyed the last hopes of the republican party.@@<sup>17</sup>
                    In&nbsp;40 a threatened rupture between the two victors&nbsp;was avoided by the
                    treaty concluded at Brundusium. Antony&nbsp;married Octavian’s sister Octavia,
                    and took command of the&nbsp;eastern half of the empire; Octavian appropriated
                    Italy and&nbsp;the West; while Lepidus was forced to content himself
                        with&nbsp;Africa.@@<sup>18</sup> For the next twelve years, while Antony was
                    indulging&nbsp;in dreams of founding for himself and Cleopatra an empire
                    in&nbsp;the East, and shocking Roman feeling by his wild excesses and&nbsp;his
                    affectation of oriental magnificence,@@<sup>19</sup> Octavian was
                    patiently&nbsp;consolidating his power. Lepidus his fellow-triumvir was
                    in&nbsp;36 ejected from Africa and banished to Circeii, while&nbsp;Sextus
                    Pompeius, who had since his defeat at Munda&nbsp;maintained a semi-piratical
                    ascendancy in the western Mediterranean, was decisively defeated in the same
                    year, and his death&nbsp;in 35 left Octavian sole master of the West.
                    The&nbsp;inevitable trial of strength between himself and Antony&nbsp;was not
                    long delayed. In 32 Antony openly challenged&nbsp;the hostility of Octavian by
                    divorcing Octavia in favour of&nbsp;the beautiful and daring Egyptian princess,
                    with whom, as the&nbsp;heiress of the Ptolemies, he aspired to share the empire
                    of the&nbsp;Eastern world. By a decree of the senate Antony was
                    declared&nbsp;deposed from his command, and war was declared against&nbsp;Queen
                        Cleopatra.@@<sup>20</sup> On the 2nd of September 31&nbsp;was fought the
                    battle of Actium.@@<sup>21</sup> Octavian’s victory&nbsp;was complete. Antony
                    and Cleopatra committed&nbsp;suicide (30), and the Eastern provinces submitted
                    in&nbsp;29. Octavian returned to Rome to celebrate his&nbsp;triumph and mark the
                    end of the long-continued anarchv</span></p>
