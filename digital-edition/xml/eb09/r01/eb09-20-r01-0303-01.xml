a market-town and ancient borough of Berkshire, is pleasantly situated on slightly elevated ground on the banks of the Kennet, a short distance above its junction with the Thames, and on branches of the Great Western, South-Eastern, and South-Western Railways, 28 miles south-south-east of Oxford and 354 west of London by rail. Besides the facilities on the Thames there is water communication by the Kennet to Newbury, and by the Kennet and Avon Canal to the Severn. The Thames is crossed by one bridge and the Kennet by three. The</p>

<p>town is well built, with wide and regular streets and many good villas in the suburbs. Of the magnificent Benedictine abbey founded in 1121 by King Henry I., originally one of the three wealthiest in England, all that now remains is a mass of ruins (with the exception of the gateway, which was restored in 1861 and is now carefully preserved), a portion of the great hall (in which several parliaments have been held), and the foundation of the Norman apsidal chapel. Henry I., who died at Rouen, was buried within its precincts; but his monument was destroyed in the time of Edward VI.; and John of Gaunt was married there to Blanche of Lancaster in 1359. By Henry VIII. it was converted into a palace, which formed the occasional residence of subsequent sovereigns until its destruction during the Cromwellian wars. Of other old ecclesiastical buildings of special interest the principal are Greyfriars’ church, completed about 1311, formerly the church of Greyfriars’ monastery, but after the dissolution used successively as a town-hall, a workhouse, and a jail, until it was restored to its original use in 1864 ; St Mary’s church, rebuilt, according to Camden, in 1551 from the ruins of a nunnery founded by Elfrida to expiate the murder of her stepson (Edward the Martyr); the church of St Lawrence, originally Norman, but rebuilt in the 15th century in the Early English style, containing some interesting brasses; and the church of St Giles, of mixed architecture, which was severely damaged during the Cromwellian wars. At the free grammar-school, founded in 1445, Archbishop Laud received his education, and he afterwards became a generous benefactor to it. The school was removed in 1871 to new buildings surrounded by 12 acres of ground. Other educational foundations are the Kendrick schools (1624), the blue-coat school (1656), and the green-coat school for girls (1779). The various almshouses were consolidated into one building in 1865. Among the modern structures are the municipal buildings (in the Renaissance style, erected in 1875 and enlarged in 1882, containing a large concert-room, a free library, schools for science and art, and a museum), the corn exchange, the assize courts, the athenaeum, the royal Albert hall, the masonic hall, the workhouse, and the royal Berkshire hospital. The town has a large trade in corn and agricultural produce ; and, in addition to an extensive biscuit manufactory which employs over 3000 hands, it possesses iron-works, iron-foundries, engine works, and breweries. Adjoining the town are extensive seed nurseries covering about 10,000 acres. The population of the borough (area, 2186 acres) in 1871 was 32,324, and in 1881 it was 42,054.</p><p>The origin of the town is doubtful ; but Reading must have been a place of some importance when the Danes in 871 brought their war-ships up the Thames as far as the Kennet and made the town for some time their headquarters. It was burned by Sweyn in 1006. In <hi rend="italic">Domesday</hi> the name occurs as Radynges. A new and strong castle was erected here by Stephen, which was destroyed by Henry II. In 1209 the professors and students of Oxford made a temporary retreat to Reading, owing to a quarrel with King John. From the 13th to the 16th century parliaments were frequent!} <hi rend="sup">7</hi> held in the town, and in the Michaelmas term of 1625 the law courts were transferred to it on account of the prevalence of the plague in London. In 1643 it surrendered to the Parliamentary forces under the earl of Essex, and subsequently was more than once occupied by the rival armies. It is a borough by prescription and received charters and grants from Henry III. and subsequent sovereigns. It has returned members to parliament from the 23d of Edward I. ; the number was reduced from two to one in 1885. By the Municipal Act of 1836 it was divided into three wards governed by a mayor, six aldermen, and eighteen councillors.</p>
