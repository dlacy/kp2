That of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">actio&nbsp;de dolo,</span><span class="font0"> for example, ran thus: “ Titius be judge. Should it appear&nbsp;that, through the fraud of N. N., A. A. was induced to convey&nbsp;and cede possession to him of his farm (describing, it), then, unless&nbsp;on your order N.

The&nbsp;system was fully developed before Julian’s consolidation of. the&nbsp;Edict; and the statutory recognition which the latter then obtained,&nbsp;though it stopped the praetor’s power of amending the law, did&nbsp;nothing to impair the efficiency of the existing procedure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Procedure extra Ordinem <sup>@@1</sup> The</span><span class="font0"> two-staged procedure, first </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">in jure</span><span class="font0"> and then </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">in judicio</span><span class="font0">,. constituted the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ordo judiciorum priva-torum.</span><span class="font0"> Early in the Empire, however, it became the&nbsp;practice in certain cases to abstain from adjusting a&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">formula</span><span class="font0"> and making a remit to a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">judex,</span><span class="font0"> and to. feave the&nbsp;cause in the hands of the magistrate from beginning to end.&nbsp;In these cases, speaking generally, the magistrate acted&nbsp;as an administrative official. Such cases did not necessarily come&nbsp;before the ordinary judicial praetors; on the contrary, they were&nbsp;committed as a rule to special officials </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(e.g.</span><span class="font0"> consuls) who were&nbsp;appointed to decide them by the emperors. This kind of procedure&nbsp;was adopted sometimes because the claim that was being made&nbsp;rested rather on moral than on legal right, and sometimes in order&nbsp;to avoid unnecessary disclosure of family misunderstandings.&nbsp;Thus, the earliest questions that were raised about testamcntaiy&nbsp;trusts were sent for consideration and disposal to the consuls,&nbsp;apparently because, in the existing state of jurisprudence, it was&nbsp;thought incompetent for a beneficiary to maintain in reference to&nbsp;the heir (who had only been </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">requested</span><span class="font0"> to comply with the testator’s&nbsp;wishes) that he was bound in law to pay him (¿are </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">oportere)</span><span class="font0"> his&nbsp;bequest. Had the difficulty arisen at an earlier period, and in the&nbsp;heyday of the constructive energy of the praetors, they would&nbsp;probably have solved it with an </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">actio in factum.</span><span class="font0"> As it was, it fell&nbsp;to the emperors to deal with it, and they adopted the method of&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">extraordinaria cognitio,</span><span class="font0"> the jurisdiction which they in the first&nbsp;instance conferred on the consuls being before long confided to a&nbsp;magistrate specially designated for it.,—the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">praetor fidei commissarius.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">Questions between tutors and their pupil wards in like manner&nbsp;began to be dealt with </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">extra ordinem,</span><span class="font0"> the cognition being entrusted&nbsp;by Marcus Aurelius to a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">praetor tutelaris;</span><span class="font0"> while fiscal questions&nbsp;in which a private party was interested went to a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">praetor fisci,</span><span class="font0"> whose&nbsp;creation was due to Nerva. Claims for aliment between parent and&nbsp;child or patron and freedman rested on natural duty rather than on&nbsp;legal right; they could not therefore well be made the subject-matter of a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">judicium,</span><span class="font0"> and consequently went for disposal to the&nbsp;consuls or the city prefect, and in the provinces to tne governor.&nbsp;Questions of status, especially of freedom or slavery, at least from&nbsp;the time of Marcus Aurelius, were also disposed of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">extra ordinem;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and so. were claims by physicians, advocates and public teachers&nbsp;for their </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">honoraria,</span><span class="font0"> and by officials for their salaries, the Romans&nbsp;refusing to admit that these could be recovered by an ordinary&nbsp;action of location. In all those extraordinary cognitions the procedure began with a complaint addressed to the magistrate, instead&nbsp;of an </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">in jus vocatiooi</span><span class="font0"> the party complained against; it was for the&nbsp;magistrate to require the attendance of the latter </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(evocatio)</span><span class="font0"> if he&nbsp;thought the complaint relevant. The decision was a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">judicatum</span><span class="font0"> or</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">decretum</span><span class="font0"> according to circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Jural Remedies flawing directly from the Magistrate's Imperium<sup>@@2</sup> — </span><span class="font0">Great, as were the results for the law of the multiplication&nbsp;and simplification of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">judicia</span><span class="font0"> through the formular system,*&nbsp;it may be questioned whether, it did not benefit quite as&nbsp;much from the direct intervention of the praetors and other&nbsp;magistrates in certain cases in virtue of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">imperium&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">with which they were invested. This manifested itself&nbsp;principally in the form of (i) interdicts; (2) praetorian stipulations;</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">(3) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">missio in possessionem;</span><span class="font0"> and (4) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">in integrum restitutio.</span><span class="font0"> All these had been in common use during the Republic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">1. The interdicts<sup>@@3</sup> have already been referred to as in use under the régime of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">jus civile;</span><span class="font0"> but tneir number and scope were vastly&nbsp;increased under that of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">jus praetorium.</span><span class="font0"> The characteristic of the developed procedure by interdict was&nbsp;this—that in it the praetor reversed the ordinary course&nbsp;of things, and, instead of waiting for an inquiry into the facts&nbsp;alleged by a complainer, provisionally assumed them to be true&nbsp;and pronounced an order upon the respondent, which he was bound&nbsp;either to obey or show to be unjustified. The order pronounced&nbsp;might be either rcstitutory, exhibitory (in both cases usually spoken&nbsp;of in the texts as a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">decretum),</span><span class="font0"> or prohibitory:—rcstitutory, when,&nbsp;for example, the respondent was. ordained to restore something he&nbsp;was alleged to have taken possession of by violent means, to remove&nbsp;impediments he had placed in the channel of a river, and the like;&nbsp;exhibitory, when he was ordained to produce something he was&nbsp;unwarrantably detaining, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font0"> the body of a freeman he was holding&nbsp;as his slave, or a will in which the complainer alleged that he had an&nbsp;interest; prohibitory, as, for example, that he should not disturb&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">status quo</span><span class="font0"> of possession as between the complainer and himself,&nbsp;that he should not interfere with a highway, a watercourse, the&nbsp;access to a sepulchre, and so forth. If the respondent obeyed the&nbsp;order pronounced in a restitutory or exhibitory decree, there was&nbsp;an end of the matter. But frequently, and perhaps more often than&nbsp;not, the interdict was only the commencement, of a litigation,&nbsp;facilitated by sponsions and restipula.tions,.in which the questions&nbsp;had to be tried (1) whether<sup>-</sup>the interdict or injunction was justified,&nbsp;(2) whether there had been breach of it, and, (3) if so, what damages&nbsp;were due in consequence. The procedure therefore was often anything but summary..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the possessory interdicts </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">uti possidetis</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">utrubi</span><span class="font0"> in particular it was extremely involved, due to some extent to the fact that&nbsp;they were double interdicts </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(interdicta duplicia), i.e.</span><span class="font0"> addressed&nbsp;indifferently to both parties. Gaius says, but, as most modern&nbsp;writers think, erroneously, that they had been devised as ancillary&nbsp;to a litigation about ownership, and for the purpose of deciding&nbsp;which of the parties, as possessor, was to have ttie advantage of&nbsp;standing on the defensive in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rei vindicatio.<sup>@@4</sup> T</span><span class="font0">hat they were so&nbsp;used in his time, as in that of Justinian, cannot be doubted. But&nbsp;it is amazing that they, should have been, for they were much more&nbsp;cumbrous than the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">vindicatio</span><span class="font0"> to which they led up. Take the&nbsp;interdict </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">uti possidetis,</span><span class="font0"> which applied to immovables, as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">utrubi</span><span class="font0"> did&nbsp;to movables. Both parties being present, the praetor addressed&nbsp;them to this effect: &quot; I forbid that one of you two who does not&nbsp;possess the house in question to use force in order to prevent the&nbsp;other who is in possession, provided he is so neither by clandestine&nbsp;or violent exclusion of the.first, nor in virtue of a grant from him&nbsp;during pleasure, from continuing, to possess as at present.&quot; It is&nbsp;manifest that this decided nothing; it was no more than a prohibition of disturbance of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">status quo</span><span class="font0">; it left the question entirely&nbsp;open which of the parties it was that was in possession, and which&nbsp;that was forbidden to interfere. The manner of its explication was&nbsp;somewhat singular. Each of the parties was bound at once to&nbsp;commit what in the case of one of them must have been a breach of&nbsp;the interdict, by a pretence of violence offered to the other </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(vis ex&nbsp;conventu);<sup>@@5</sup> </span><span class="font0">each of them was thus in a position to say to the other:&nbsp;&quot; We have both used force; but it was you alone that did it in&nbsp;defiance of. the interdict, for it is I that am in possession.&quot; The&nbsp;interim enjoyment, of the house was then awarded to the highest&nbsp;bidder, who gave his stipulatory promise to pay rent to his adversary&nbsp;in the event of the. latter being successful in the long-run; penal&nbsp;sponsions and restipulations were exchanged upon the question&nbsp;which of them had committed a breach of the interdict; and on&nbsp;these,, four in number, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">formulae</span><span class="font0"> were adjusted and sent to a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">judex&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">for trial. If the procedure could not thus be explicated, because&nbsp;either of the parties declined to take part in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">vis ex conventu,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">or the bidding, or the sponsions and restipulations, he was assumed&nbsp;to be in the wrong, and, by what was called a secondary interdict,&nbsp;required to yield up his possession or detention and to abstain&nbsp;from disturbing the other &quot; in all time coming.&quot; Whatever we&nbsp;may think of the action system of the Romans in the period&nbsp;of the classical jurisprudence, one cannot help wondering at a</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
