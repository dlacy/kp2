<p><label>RIPENING</label> <hi rend="italic">of Grain,</hi> means its arriving to maturity. The following paper, which appeared in the firſt volume of the Transactions of the Royal Society of E-dinburgh, may be worthy the attention of farmers in this country ; where it frequently happens, from continued rains, that the corn is quite green when the ſroſt ſets in ; in conſequence of which, the farmers cut it down, without thinking it can poſſibly arrive at further maturity.</p><p>“ Summer 1782 having been remarkably cold and unfavourable, the harveſt was very late, and much of the grain, eſpecially oats, was green even in October, In the beginning of October the cold was ſo great, that, in one night, there was produced on ponds near Kinneil, in the neighbourhood of Borrowſtounneſs, ice three quarters of an inch thick. It was apprehended by many farmers, that ſuch a degree of cold would effectually prevent the further filling and ripening of their corn. In order to aſcertain this point, Dr Roebuck ſelected ſeveral ſtalks of oats, of nearly equal fulneſs, and immediately cut thoſe which, on the moſt attentive compariſon, appeared the beſt, and marked the others, but allowed them to remain in the field 14 days longer ; at the end of which time they, too, were cut, and kept in a dry room for 10 days. The grains of each parcel were then weighed ; when 11 of the grains which had been left ftanding in the field were found to be equal in weight to 30 of the grains which had been cut a fortnight ſooner, though even the beſt of the grains were far from being ripe. During that, fortnight (viz. from October 7th to October 2iſt) the average heat, according to Fahrenheit’s thermometer, which was obſerved every day at eight o’clock in the morning and fix in the evening, was a little above 43 „ Dr Roebuck obſerves, that this ripening and filling of corn in ſo low a temperature ſhould be the leſs ſurpri-fing to us, when we reflect, that ſeed-corn will vegetate in the ſame degree of heat ; and he draws an important inference from his obſervations, viz. That farmers ſhotild be cautious of cutting down their unripe corn, on the ſuppofition that in a cold autumn it could fill no more.”</p><p>A writer in the Scots Magazine ſor June 1792, under the ſignature of <hi rend="italic">Agricola,</hi> when ſpeaking on this ſubject, adds the following piece of information, viz. “ That grain cut down before it is quite ripe will grow or ſpring equally well as ripe and plump grain, provided it is properly preferred. I relate this from a fact, and alſo oa the authority of one of the moſt judicious and experienced farmers in this iſland, William Craik of ArbigLnd, Eſq; near Dumfries, who was taught by ſuch a ſeaſon as this threatens to prove. This being the caſe, every wife economical farmer will preſerve his ripe and plump grain for bread, and ſow the green and ſeemingly ſhri-velled grain, with a perfect conviction that the plants proceeding from ſuch feed will yield as ſtrong and thriving corn as what grows from plump feed. By this means the farmer will enjoy the double advantage of having the corn moſt productive in flour for bread, and</p>

<p>his light ſhrivelled grain will go much farther in ſeed than the plump grain would do. I ſaw the experiment made on wheat which was ſo ſhrivelled that it was thought ſcarcely worth giving to fowls, and yet produced heavy large ears.”</p>
