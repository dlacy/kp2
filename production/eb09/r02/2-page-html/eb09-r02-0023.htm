<p><span class="font0">of the eye. A muscle arises from the surface of the sclerotic on its inner side and ends in a tendon which passes backwards and downwards over the optic nerve to attach itself to the margin of the&nbsp;nictitating membrane. There is a rudimentary pecten.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the Chelonia the sclerotic is furnished with bony plates. The Harderian gland is small, but the lacrymal is considerable.&nbsp;There are three eyelids, and the nictitating one has the muscle&nbsp;which moves it combined with the elevator muscle of the eyelids.&nbsp;Both arise from the inner side of the sclerotic. One arches over the&nbsp;optic nerve and goes to the third eyelid, and the other goes from&nbsp;the outer angle of the eye to the lower eyelid. The fibres of these&nbsp;two muscles are closely interrelated at their origin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Olfactory Organ.—</span><span class="font1">There are two olfactory organs in every Reptile, consisting of tracts or foldings of&nbsp;mucous membrane richly supplied with nerves and&nbsp;supported and protected by cartilaginous or bony&nbsp;structures. In existing Reptiles they always lie at,&nbsp;and extend near to, the anterior end of the muzzle,&nbsp;though in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ichthyosauri</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Plesiosauri</span><span class="font1"> they opened&nbsp;anteriorly far back and near the orbits. The olfactory&nbsp;membranes are always enclosed or supported by cartilages which proceed out from an azygous septum which&nbsp;divides them one from the other. Each nasal organ has&nbsp;an anterior and posterior opening, though the anterior&nbsp;openings may so meet as to form but one superficial&nbsp;aperture, as in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Crocodilia,</span><span class="font1"> and the two posterior&nbsp;apertures may open, not directly into the mouth, but into&nbsp;an azygous forwardly-extending diverticulum from it, the&nbsp;posterior opening of which diverticulum forms practically a common posterior termination for both the organs&nbsp;of smell. The nasal passages are short in all existing&nbsp;Reptiles save the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Crocodilia,</span><span class="font1"> and open posteriorly far&nbsp;forwards—as has been already noticed in describing the&nbsp;skull, when the prolongation backwards of the posterior&nbsp;nares in the Crocodiles was also described. In the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chelonia&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">the anterior external apertures of the nostrils are distinct&nbsp;though near together. Sometimes, as in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chelys</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Trionyx,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">they are tubular, and open externally at the end of a short&nbsp;proboscis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A structure called the nasal gland exists and is well-developed in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ophidia.</span><span class="font1"> It is a peculiar rather soft body, often shaped like a mushroom with a very short&nbsp;stalk. It lies immediately beneath the floor of the nasal&nbsp;capsule, and the membranous wall of the cavity on which&nbsp;it lies is covered and protected by a bone, commonly called&nbsp;the “turbinal,” which extends out from the median nasal&nbsp;septum to the maxilla. These cavities open on the palate&nbsp;by narrow apertures placed in front of the posterior nares.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the Chelonians we find a soft, egg-shaped, whitish, azygous body (without any internal cavity), also placed in&nbsp;front of the posterior nares in the skin of the palate,&nbsp;behind the palatine part of the premaxillæ. It is supplied&nbsp;with palatine nerves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Urogenital System.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In Reptiles the urinary and generative systems are distinct, save as regards the approximation of their posterior terminations, thus agreeing with higher Vertebrates&nbsp;and differing from Amphibians, in which the renal and&nbsp;secreting organs generally continue throughout life more&nbsp;or less connected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Urinary System.—</span><span class="font1">The urinary system of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rep-tilia</span><span class="font1"> always consists of a pair of renal glands or kidneys, with excretory ducts which pass down to the cloaca. There&nbsp;may or may not be a urinary bladder, also opening into the&nbsp;cloaca. Besides these parts there are also a pair of Wolffian&nbsp;bodies, which are more or less aborted remnants of large&nbsp;organs which are always developed during embryonic life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Kidneys.—The kidneys are more or less symmetrically placed on the dorsal side of the peritoneum, in the hinder half of&nbsp;the trunk. Each consists of a mass of cæcal tubules into the distal&nbsp;end of which a tuft of minute vessels projects, thus forming what&nbsp;is called a glomerulus or Malpighian body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the Οphidia the kidneys are least symmetrical, the right one extending the farthest forwards. They are elongated and lobed, and&nbsp;sometimes in such a way as to appear spirally twisted. Each terminates behind considerably in front of the cloaca. The duct of&nbsp;each ureter begins at the anterior end of the kidney and thence&nbsp;proceeds along its inner border, and accessory ducts open into it&nbsp;from the interspaces of the lobes of the kidneys. The two ureters&nbsp;open into the sides of the cloaca. In the males each opens upon&nbsp;a papilla in close proximity to the opening of the male sexual duct&nbsp;or vas deferens. In the females the ureter opens beside the mouth&nbsp;of the female sexual duct or oviduct. There is never any urinary&nbsp;bladder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In Lacertilians the kidneys are more posteriorly placed than in Serpents. They lie at the hindmost part of the body cavity above&nbsp;the cloaca, and they generally much approximate together. They&nbsp;are also more symmetrically placed; only in the Amphisbænians&nbsp;the right kidney extends the more forward, thus resembling&nbsp;Ophidians. There is always a urinary bladder, which is a ventral&nbsp;diverticulum of the cloaca. The kidneys are usually transversely&nbsp;furrowed. The ureters run along the inner side of the kidneys, and&nbsp;open into the sides of the cloaca, not into the bladder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In Chelonians the kidneys lie near the cloaca in the cavity of the pelvis. They are rather short and thick, and more or less trihedral.&nbsp;Their surface is marked with many shallow meandering grooves and&nbsp;fewer deeper furrows. The ureters proceed as usual along the inner&nbsp;sides of the kidneys, and several large canals successively open from&nbsp;them into the ureters, which extend backwards, but to a trifling&nbsp;extent, beyond the kidneys. They open rather anteriorly into the&nbsp;cloaca close to the neck of the urinary bladder, which vessel is&nbsp;always present and voluminous, and is often two-horned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Crocodilia also have posteriorly situated pelvic kidneys, but they have no urinary bladder. The kidney is concave dorsally&nbsp;and flatter ventrally. Its surface has meandering convolutions&nbsp;separated by furrows. The ureters for the greater part of their&nbsp;length run deeply sunk in the substance of the kidneys. The&nbsp;ureters leave the hinder ends of the kidneys and run freely for a&nbsp;short distance to the cloaca, which they enter close behind the&nbsp;rectum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Wolffian Bodies.—These bodies lie one on each side on the dorsum of the body cavity, and each consists of a series of cæcal&nbsp;tubes with vascular balls or glomeruli like those of the kidney, the&nbsp;various tubes always opening at first into a common excretory duct&nbsp;which leads towards the cloaca. In adults they are but small&nbsp;organs. In a Python 10 feet long they measure but about an inch.&nbsp;In Serpents generally they are slender and lobed bodies which lie&nbsp;close to the veins in front of the kidneys.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Generative Organs.—</span><span class="font1">Reptiles, like all the higher Vertebrates, have the sexes divided, with two sets of organs&nbsp;which respectively characterize male and female individuals. In both sexes, as in Birds, there is a pair of sexual&nbsp;glands, each furnished with a passage for the exit of its&nbsp;product, together with, almost always, external organs&nbsp;destined to effect and facilitate impregnation. Unlike&nbsp;Mammals, however, all Reptiles have the sexual glands&nbsp;placed within the abdominal cavity, and, also unlike Mammals, the male external organ or agent for copulation may&nbsp;be either azygous or bifold according to the group to which&nbsp;any Reptile may belong. Unlike the more inferior Vertebrates, however, Reptiles, with the solitary exception of&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hatteria,</span><span class="font1"> always possess such a copulating organ, and impregnation is invariably effected internally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The male organs consist of a pair of glands, the testes, with their ducts, the vasa deferentia, and the external&nbsp;organs, penis or penes. The female organs consist of a pair&nbsp;of glands, the ovaries, with their ducts, the oviducts, together with rudimentary representatives of the external&nbsp;sexual organs of the males.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Testes and Vasa Deferentia.—These are two compact and rather small glands, consisting of a mass of cæcal convoluted tubes,&nbsp;lying in the dorsal region of the abdominal cavity and completely&nbsp;invested by peritoneum, and with a dense albugineal coat of their&nbsp;own. From the mass of tubules a certain variable number of&nbsp;efferent tubes, vasa efferentia, come forth and soon unite in the&nbsp;single excretory duct of the gland, the vas deferens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the Ophidia the testes are not symmetrically placed, the right one being somewhat more voluminous and also in front of&nbsp;the other. Consequently the right vas deferens is larger than the&nbsp;left one. Each testis lies in front of the kidney of its own side,&nbsp;and is more or less elongated in form. The vas deferens proceeds&nbsp;along the inner margin of the testicle, and is a convoluted tube&nbsp;which narrows as it proceeds backwards. The opening into the</span></p>
