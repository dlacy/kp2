a small territory in Northern Hindustan, situated between Nepaul and Bootan, about the 28th degree of north latitude, and extending along the banks of the river Teesta, which bounds it to the west. In 1792, when the Chinese invaded Nepaul, the rajah of Segwin submitted to become a subject of China ; and here accordingly the Chinese established a military post immediately adjoining the dominions of the East India Company in Bengal.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
