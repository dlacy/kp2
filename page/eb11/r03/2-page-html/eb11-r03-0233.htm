<p><span class="font0">(that is to say before the later part of the 15th century) which could be called obscene by any fair judge. And the term&nbsp;would have to be somewhat strained in reference even to&nbsp;these. The contrast with the companion divisions of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">fabliaux&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and farces is quite extraordinary; and nearly as Sharp<sub>f</sub> as&nbsp;that between Greek tragedy on the one hand and Greek comedy&nbsp;or satiric play on the other. It is brought out for the merely&nbsp;English reader in Chaucer of course, but in him it might have&nbsp;been studied. In the immense </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">corpus</span><span class="font0"> of known or unknown&nbsp;French and English writers (the Germans are not quite so&nbsp;particular) it comes out with no possibility of deliberation&nbsp;and with unmistakable force.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The history of the forms in which romance presents itself follows a sufficiently normal and probable course. The oldest&nbsp;are always—save in the single case of part of the&nbsp;Arthurian division, in which we probably possess none&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">actually</span><span class="font0"> oldest, and in some of the division of</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Antiquity which had a long line of predecessors in the learned languages—the shortest. They become lengthened in a way&nbsp;continued and exemplified to the present moment by the tendency of writers to add sequels and episodes to their own stories,&nbsp;and made still more natural by the fact that these poems were&nbsp;in all or almost all cases </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">recited. </span><span class="font0">“ Go on ” is the most natural&nbsp;and not the least common as well as the most complimentary&nbsp;form of “ Bravo !” and the reciter never seems to have said&nbsp;“ no ” to the compliment. In not a few cases—</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Huon of&nbsp;Bordeaux, Oglcr the Dane, Guy of Warwick,</span><span class="font0"> are conspicuous&nbsp;examples—we possess the same story in various stages; and can&nbsp;see how poems, perhaps originally like </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">King Horn</span><span class="font0"> of not more&nbsp;than a couple of thousand lines or even shorter in the 13th&nbsp;century, grew to thirty, forty, fifty thousand in the 15th. The&nbsp;transference of the story itself from verse to prose is also—save&nbsp;in some particular and still controverted instances—regularly&nbsp;traceable and part of a larger and natural literary movement.&nbsp;While, also naturally enough, the pieces become in time fuller&nbsp;of conversation (though not as yet often of conversation that&nbsp;advances the story or heightens its interest), of descriptive&nbsp;detail, &amp;c. And in some groups (notably that of the remarkable </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">AmkwZu</span><span class="font0"> division) a very great enlargement of the proportion and degradation of the character of the marvellous&nbsp;element appears—the wonders being no longer mystical, and&nbsp;magical only in the lower sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">And so we come to the particular characteristics of the kind or kinds in individual examples. Of these the English reader&nbsp;has a matchless though late instance in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Morte&nbsp;d*Arthur</span><span class="font0"> of Malory, a book which is at once a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">corpus&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and a pattern of romance. in gross and in detail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The -fact that it is not, as has been too often hastily or ignorantly asserted, a mere compilation, but the last of a singular&nbsp;series of rehandlings and redactions—conducted with extraordinary though for the most part indistinctly traceable instinct&nbsp;of genius—makes it to some extent transcend any single example&nbsp;of older date and more isolated composition. But it displays&nbsp;all the best as well as some of the less good characteristics of&nbsp;most if not all. Of the commonest kind—the almost pure&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">roman d<sup>1</sup> aventures</span><span class="font0"> itself—the Gareth-Beaumains episode (for&nbsp;which we have no direct original, French or English, though&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lybius Discomus</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ipomedan</span><span class="font0"> come near to it in different&nbsp;ways) will give a fair example; while its presentation of the&nbsp;later chapters of the Grail story, and the intertwisted plot&nbsp;and continuing catastrophe of the love of Lancelot and Guinevere, altogether transcend the usual scope of romance pure and&nbsp;simple, and introduce almost the highest possibilities of the&nbsp;romantic novel. The way in which Malory or his immediate&nbsp;authorities have extruded the tedious wars round the “ Rock&nbsp;of the Saxons,” have dropped the awkward episode of the false&nbsp;Guinevere, and have restrained the uninteresting exuberance&nbsp;of the continental wars and the preliminary struggles with the&nbsp;minor kings, keeps the reader from contact with the duller sides&nbsp;of romance only. Of the real variety which rewards a persistent&nbsp;reader of the class at large it would be impossible to present&nbsp;even a miniature hand-index here; but something may be done&nbsp;by sample, which will not be </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">mere</span><span class="font0"> sample, hut an integral part of&nbsp;the exposition. No arbitrary separation need be made between&nbsp;French and English; because of the intimate connexion between&nbsp;the two. As specially and symptomatically noteworthy the&nbsp;famous pair—perhaps the most famous of all—</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Guy of Warwick&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bevis of Hampton,</span><span class="font0"> should </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font0"> be taken. For, with the exception of the separation of Guy and Felise in the first, and some&nbsp;things in the character ol Josiane in the second, both are somewhat spiritless concoctions of stock matter. Far more striking&nbsp;than anything in either, though not consummately supported by&nbsp;their context, are the bold opening of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Blancandin et V orgueilleuse&nbsp;d'amour,</span><span class="font0"> where the hero begins by kissing a specially proud and&nbsp;prudish lady; and the fine scenes of fight with a supernatural&nbsp;: foe at a grave to be found in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Amadas et Idoine.</span><span class="font0"> Reputation&nbsp;and value coincide more nearly in the charming fairy story of&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Parthenopex de Blois</span><span class="font0"> and the Christian-Saracen love romance&nbsp;of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Plore</span><span class="font0"> (Florice and other forms) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">et Blanchcfleur.</span><span class="font0"> Few* romances&nbsp;in either language, or in German, exhibit the pure adventure&nbsp;story better than Chrestien de Troyes’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chevalier au Lyon,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">especially in its English form of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ywain and Gawain<sup>t</sup>,</span><span class="font0"> while the&nbsp;above-mentioned </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lybius Disconus {Le Beau Déconnu)</span><span class="font0"> makes a&nbsp;good pair with this. For originality of form and phrase as well&nbsp;as of spirit, if not exactly of incident, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Gawain and the Green&nbsp;Knight</span><span class="font0"> stands alone; but another Gawain story (in French&nbsp;this time), </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Le Chevalieur aux deux epêes,</span><span class="font0"> though of much less&nbsp;force and fire, exceeds it in length without sameness of adventure. Only the poorest romances—those ridiculed by Chaucer&nbsp;in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sir Thopas—</span><span class="font0">which form a small minority, lack striking&nbsp;individual touches, such as the picture of the tree covered with&nbsp;torches and carrying on its summit a heavenly child, which&nbsp;illuminates the huge expanse of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Durmart le Gallois.</span><span class="font0"> The&nbsp;various forms of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Seven Wise Masters</span><span class="font0"> in different European&nbsp;languages show the attitude of the Western to the Eastern&nbsp;fiction interestingly. The beautiful romance of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ernarè</span><span class="font0"> is about&nbsp;the best of several treatments of one of the exceptional subjects&nbsp;classed above—the unnatural love of father for daughter,&nbsp;while if we turn to German stories we find not merely in the&nbsp;German variants of Arthurian themes, but in others a double&nbsp;portion of the mystical element. French themes are constantly&nbsp;worked up afresh—as indeed they are all over Europe—but the&nbsp;Germans have the advantage of drawing upon not merely&nbsp;Scandinavian traditions like those which they wrought into&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Nibelungen Lied</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Gudrun,</span><span class="font0"> but others of their own.&nbsp;And both in these and in their dealings with French they sometimes show an amount of story-telling power which is rare in&nbsp;French and English. No handling of the Tristan and Iscult&nbsp;story can compare with Gottfried’s; while the famous </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Der arme&nbsp;Heinrich</span><span class="font0"> of Hartmann von Aue (the original of Longfellow’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Legend)</span><span class="font0"> is one of the greatest triumphs and most charming examples of romance, displaying in almost the highest&nbsp;degree possible for a story of little complexity all the best&nbsp;characteristics of the thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">What, then, are these characteristics? The account has now been bçought to a point where a reasoned résumé of it will give&nbsp;as definite an answer as can be given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Even yet we may with advantage interpose a consideration of the answer that </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">was</span><span class="font0"> given to this question universally (with&nbsp;a few’ dissidents) from the Renaissance to nearly the&nbsp;end of the 18th century and not infrequently since;&nbsp;while it is not impossible that, in the well-attested revolutions of critical thought and taste, it may be given again.&nbsp;This is that romance on the whole, and with some flashes of&nbsp;better things at times, is a jumble of incoherent and mostly&nbsp;ill-told stories, combining sameness with extravagance, outraging probability and the laws of imitative form, childish as&nbsp;a rule in its appeal to adventure and to the supernatural, immoral&nbsp;in its ethics, barbarous in its aesthetics, destitute of any philosophy, representing at its very best (though the ages of its&nbsp;lowest appreciation were hardly able even to consider this)&nbsp;a necessary stage in the education of half-civilized peoples,&nbsp;and embodying some interesting legends, much curious folklore and a certain amount of distorted historical evidence.
