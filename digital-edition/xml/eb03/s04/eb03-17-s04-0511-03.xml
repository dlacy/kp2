 in natural hiſtory, the name of a red earth of the ochre kind, called alio <hi rend="italic">rubrius a sinopica,</hi> and by ſome authors si <hi rend="italic">nοpis.</hi> It is a very cloſe, compact, and weighty earth, of a fine glowing purple colour. It is of a pure texture, but not very hard, and of an even but duſty ſurface. It adheres firmly to the tongue, is perfectly fine and ſmooth to the touch, does not crumble eaſily between the fingers, and ſtains the hands. It melts very ſlowly in the mouth, is perfectly pure and fine, of an auſtere aſtringent taſte, and ferments violently with aquafortis. It was dug in Cappadocia, and carried for ſale to a city in the neighbourhood called <hi rend="italic">Sinope,</hi> whence it had its name. It is now found in plenty in the New Jerſeys in America, and is called by the people there <hi rend="italic">bloodstone.</hi> Its fine texture and body, with its high florid colour, muſt make it very valuable to painters ; and from its aſtringency it will probably be a powerful medſicine.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
