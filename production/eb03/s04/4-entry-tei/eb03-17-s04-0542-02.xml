(John), an eminent civil engineer, was born the 28th of May 1724, O. S. at Auſthorpe, near Leeds, in a houſe built by his grandfather, and where his family have reſided ever ſince.</p><p>The ſtrength of his underſtanding and the originality of his genius appeared at an early age ; his playthings were not the playthings of children, but the tools which men employ; and he appeared to have greater entertainment in ſeeing the men in the neighbourhood work, and aſking them queſtions, than in any thing elſe. One tlay he was ſeen (to the diſtreſs of his family) on the top of his father’s barn, fixing up ſomething like a windmill ; another time, he attended ſome men fixing a pump at a neighbouring village, and obſerving them cut off a piece of bored pipe, he was ſo lucky as to procure it, and he actually made with it a working pump that raiſed water. Theſe anecdotes refer to circumſtances that happened while he was in petticoats, and moſt likely before he attained his sixth year.</p><p>About his 14th and 15th year, he had made for himſelf an engine for turning, and made ſeveral preſents to his friends of boxes in ivory or wood very neatly turned. He forged his iron and ſteel, and melted his metal; he had tools of every sort for working in wood, ivory, and metals. He had made a lathe, by which he had cut a perpetual ſcrew in braſs, a thing little known at that day, which was the invention of Mr Henry Hindley of York ; with whom Mr Smeaton ſoon became acquainted, and they ſpent many a night at Mr Hindley’s houſe till day-light, converſing on thoſe ſubjects.</p><p>Thus had Mr Smeaton, by the ſtrength of his genius and indefatigable induſtry, acquired, at the age of 18, an extenſive ſet of tools, and the art of working in moſt of the mechanical trades, without the aſſiſtance of any master. A part of every day was generally occupied in forming ſome ingenious piece of mechaniſm.</p><p>Mr Smeaton’s father was an attorney, and deſirous of bringing him up to the ſame profeſſion, Mr Smeaton therefore came up to London in 1742, and attended the courts in Weifminſter hall; but finding (as his common expreſſion was) that the law did not suit the bent of his genius, he wrote a ſtrong memorial to his father on that ſubject ; whoſe good ſenſe from that moment left Mr Smeaton to purſue the bent oſ his genius in his own way.</p><p>In 1751 he began a courſe of experiments to try a machine of his invention to meaſure a ſhip’s way at ſea, and alſo made two voyages in company with Dr Knight to try it, and a compaſs of his own invention and making, which was made magnetical by Dr Knight’s artificial magnets : the ſecond voyage was made in the Fortune ſloop of war, commanded at that time by Captain Alexander Campbell.</p><p>Jn 1753 he was elected member of the Royal So</p><p>ciety ; the number of papers publiſhed in their Tranſactions will ſhow the universality of his genius and knowledge. In 1759 he was honoured by an unanimous vote with their gold medal for his paper intitled " An Experimental Inquiry concerning the Natural Powers of Water and Wind to turn Mills, and other Machines depending on a Circular Motion.”</p><p>This paper, he ſays, was the reſult of experiments made on working models in the years 1752 and 1753, but not communicated to the Society till 1759; before which time he had an opportunity of putting the effect of theſe experiments into real practice, in a variety of cases, and for various purpoſes, ſo as to assure the Society he had found them to anſwer.</p><p>In December 1755, the Eddyſtone lighthouſe was burnt down : Mr Weston, the chief proprietor, and the others, being deſirous of rebuilding it in the moſt ſubſtantial manner, inquired of the earl of Macclesſield (then president of the Royal Society) whom he thought the moſt proper to rebuild it; his Lordship recommended Mr Smeaton.</p><p>Mr Smeaton undertook the work, and completed it in the ſummer of 1759. Of this Mr Smeaton gives an ample deſcription in the volume he publiſhed in 1791 : that edition has been sold ſome time ago, and a ſecond is now in the preſs, under the reviſal of his much eſteemed friend Mr Aubert, F. R. S. and governor of the London assurance corporation.</p><p>Though Mr Smeaton completed the building of the Eddyſtone lighthouſe in 1759 (a work that does him so much credit), yet it appears he did not ſoon get into full busineſs as a civil engineer ; for in 1764, while in Yorkſhire, he offered himſelf a candidate for one of the receivers of the Derwentwater eſtate ; and on the 31st of December in that year, he was appointed at a full board of Greenwich hoſpital, in a manner highly flattering to himſelf ; when two other perſons ſtrongly recommended and powerfully ſupported were candidates for the employment. In this appointment he was very happy, by the aſſiſtance and abilities of his partner Mr Walton one of the receivers, who taking upon himſelf the management and accounts, left Mr Smeaton leiſure and opportunity to exert his abilities on public works, as well as to make many improvements in the mills and in the estates of Greenwich hoſpital. By the year 1775 he had ſo much busineſs as a civil engineer, that he wiſhed to resign this appointment ; and would have done it then, had not his friends the late Mr Stuart the hoſpital ſurveyor, and Mr Ibbetson their ſecretary, prevailed upon him to continue in the office about two years longer.</p><p>Mr Smeaton having now got into full busineſs as a civil engineer, performed many works of general utility. He made the river Calder navigable ; a work that required great ſkill and judgment, owing to the very impetuous floods in that river: He planned and attended the execution of the great canal in Scotland for conveying the trade of the country either to the Atlantic or German ocean ; and having brought it to the place originally intended, he declined a handsome yearly ſalary, in order that he might attend to the multiplicity of his other bufineſs.</p><p>On the opening of the great arch at London bridge, the excavation around and under the ſterlihgs was so conſiderable, that the bridge was thought to be in<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0549.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s04-0543"/>
great danger of falling. He was then in Yorkſhire, and was ſent for by expreſs, and arrived with the utmoſt diſpatch : “ I think (ſays Mr Holmes, the author of his life) it was on a Saturday morning, when the apprehenſion of the bridge was ſo general that few would paſs over or under it. He applied himſelf immediately to examine it, and to found about the ſterlings as minutely as he could ; and the committee being called together, adopted his advice, which was to repurchaſe the ſtones that had been taken ſrom the middle pier, then lying in Moorfields, and to throw them into the river to guard the ſterlings.” Nothing ſhows the apprehenſions concerning the falling oſ the bridge more than the alacrity with which this advice was purſued ; the ſtones were repurchaſed that day, horſes, carts, and barges, were got ready, and they began the work on Sunday morning. Thus Mr Smeaton, in all human probability, ſaved London-bridge from falling, and ſecured it till more effectual methods could be taken.</p><p>The vaſt variety of mills which Mr Smeaton conſtructed, so greatly to the ſatisfaction and advantage of the owners, will ſhow the great uſe which he made of his experiments in 1752 and 1753; for he never truſted to theory in any caſe where he could have an opportunity to inveſtigate it by experiment. He built a ſteam engine at Auſthorpe, and made experiments thereon, purpoſely to aſcertain the power of Newcomen's ſteam engine, which he improved and brought to a far greater degree of perfection, both in its conſtruction and powers, than it was before.</p><p>Mr Smeaton during many years of his life was a frequent attendant on parliament, his opinion being continually called for ; and here his ſtrength of judgment and perſpicuity of expreſſion had its full diſplay : it was his conſtant cuſtom, when applied to, to plan or ſupport any meaſure, to make himſelf fully acquainted with it, to ſee its merits before he would engage in it : by this caution, added to the clearneſs of his deſcription and the integrity of his heart, he ſeldom failed to obtain for the bill which he ſupported an act of parliament. No one was heard with more attention, nor had any one ever more confidence placed in his teſtimony. In the courts of law he had ſeveral compliments paid him from the bench by Lord Mansfield and others, for the new light which he threw on difficult ſubjects.</p><p>About the year 1785 Mr Smeaton’s health began to decline; and he then took the resolution to endeavour to avoid all the buſineſs he could, ſo that he might have leiſure to publiſh an account of his inventions and works, which was certainly the firſt wiſh of his heart ; for he has often been heard to ſay, that “ he thought he could not render ſo much ſervice to his country as by doing that.” He got only his account of the Eddyſtone lighthouſe completed, and ſome preparations to his intended Treatiſe on Mills ; for he could not reſiſt the solicitations of his friends in various works: and Mr Aubert, whom he greatly loved and reſpected, being choſen chairman of Ramſgate harbour, prevailed upon him to accept the place of engineer to that harbour; and to their joint efforts the public is chiefly indebted for the improvements that have been made there within theſe few years, which fully appears in a report that Mr Smeaton gave in to the board of truſtees in 1791, which they immediately publiſhed.</p><p>Mr Smeaton being at Auſthorpe, walking in his</p><p>garden on the 16th of September 1792, was ſtruck with the palſy, and died the 28th of October. “ In his illneſs (ſays Mr Holmes) I had ſeveral letters from him, ſigned with his name, but written and ſigned by another’s pen ; the diction of them showed the ſtrength of his mind had not left him. In one written the 26th of September, after minutely deſcribing his health and feelings, he ſays, ‘ in consequence of the foregoing, I conclude myſelf nine-tenths dead ; and the greateſt favour the Almighty can do me (as I think), will be to complete the other part ; but as it is likely to be a lingering illness, it is only in His power to ſay when that is likely to happen.”</p><p>Mr Smeaton had a warmth of expreſſion that might appear to thoſe who did not know him well to border on harſhneſs ; but thoſe more intimately acquainted with him, knew it aroſe from the intenſe application of his mind, which was always in the purſuit of truth, or engaged in inveſtigating difficult ſubjects. He would ſometimes break out haſtily, when any thing was ſaid that did not tally with his ideas ; and he would not give up any thing he argued for, till his mind was convinced by sound reaſoning.</p><p>In all the social duties of life he was exemplary ; he was a moſt affectionate huſband, a good father, a warm, zealous, and ſincere friend, always ready to aſſiſt thoſe he reſpected, and often before it was pointed out to him in what way he could ſerve them. He was a lover and encourager of merit wherever he found it ; and many men are in a great meaſure indebted to his aſſiſtance and advice for their preſent ſituation. As a companion, he was always entertaining and inſtructive; and none could ſpend any time in his company without improvement.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
