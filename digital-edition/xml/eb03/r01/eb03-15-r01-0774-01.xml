the riding heats for a plate, or other premium. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate.</hi> The amuſement of horſe-racing, which is now ſo common, was not unknown among the great nations of antiquity, nor wholly un-practiſed by our anceſtors in Britain, as we have al-ready mentioned in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Race.</hi> In 1599, pri= vate matches between gentlemen, who were their own jockies and riders, were very common ; and, in the reign of James I. public races wcre eſtabliſhed at various pla-ces, when the diſcipline, and mode of preparing the horſes for running, &amp;c. were much the ſame as they are now. The moſt celebrated races of that time were called be’l-courſes, the prize of the conqueror being a bell: hence, perhaps, the phraſe of <hi rend="italic">bearing the bell,</hi> when applied to excellence, is derived In the latter end of Charles I.’s reign, races were performed in Hyde-Park. Newmarket was alfo a place for the ſame purpoſe, though it was ſirſt uſed for hunting. Racing was re-vived ſoon after the Reſtoration, and much encouraged by Charles II. who appointed races for his own amuſe-mcnt at Datchet Mead, when he reſided at windſor. Newmarket, however, now became the principal place. The king attended in perſon, eſtabliſhed a houfe for his own acconſmodation, and kept and entered horſes in his own name. Inſtead of bells, he gave a filver bowl or cup value 100 guineas ; on which prize the exploits and pedigree of the fucceſsful horſe were generally en-graved. Inſtead of the cup or bowl, the royal gift is now a hundred guineas, william III. not only added to the plates, but even founded an academy for riding ; and Queen Anne continued the bounty of her anceſ-tors, adding ſeveral plates herfelf. George I. towards the end of his reign, diſcontinued the plates, and gave in their room a hundred guineas. An act was paſſed in the 13th year of the reign of George II. for ſup-</p><p>iireffing races by poneys and other ſmall and weak ιorfes, &amp;c. by which all matches for any prize under the value of 50 1. are prohibited, under a penalty of 2.00 1. to be paid by the owner of each horſe running, and 100 1. by ſuch as advertiſe the plate ; and by which each horſe entered to run, if five years old, is obliged to carry ten ſtones ; if ſix, eleven ; and if ſeven, twelve. It is alſo ordained, that no perſon ſhall run any horſe at a courſe, unleſs it be his own, nor enter more than one horſe ſor the ſame plate, upon pain of forfeiting the horſes ; and alfo every horſe-race muſt be begun and ended in the ſame day. Horſes may run for the value of 50 1. with any weight, and at anyplace. 13 Geo. II. cap. 19. 18 George II. cap. 34. Pennant’s Britiſh Zoology, vol. i. p. 6, &amp;c. Berenger’s Hiſtory and Art of Horſemanſhip, vol. i. p. 185, &amp;c. At New-market there are two courſes, the long and the round : the firſt is exactly four miles and about 380 yards, <hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi> 7420 yards. The ſecond is 6640 yards. Childers, the ſwifteſt horſe ever known, has run the firſt courſe in ſeven minutes and a half, and the ſecond in ſix mi-nutes forty ſeconds ; which is at the rate of more than forty-nine feet in a fecond. But all other horſes take up at leaſt ſeven minutes and fifty ſeconds in completing the firſt and longeſt courſe, and ſeven minutes only in the ſhorteſt, which is at the rate of more than forty, <hi rend="italic">feven,</hi> feet in a fécond. And it is commonly ſuppoſed that thefe <hi rend="smallcaps">&lt;khh⅛&gt;jj</hi> cover, at every bound, a fpaee of ground in length about twenty-four Engliſh feet. Race-hprſea have becn for ſome time an object of taxation.</p>
