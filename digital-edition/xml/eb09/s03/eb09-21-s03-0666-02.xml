The word <hi rend="italic">sipáh,</hi> “army,” from which <hi rend="italic">sipáhi,</hi> “soldier,” is derived, corresponds to the Zend <hi rend="italic">çpádha,</hi> Old Persian <hi rend="italic">çpáda,</hi> and has also found a home in the Turkish, Kurdish, and Pashto (Pushtu) languages (see Justi, <hi rend="italic">Handbuch der Zendsprache,</hi> p. 303, 6), while its derivative is used in all Indian vernaculars, including Tamil and Burmese, to denote a native soldier, in contradistinction to <hi rend="italic">gorá,</hi> “ a fair-complexioned (European) soldier.” Towards the middle of the 18th century efforts were made by the East India Company to train natives of good caste, both Hindus and Mohammedans, for military service under the company. Though they were made to use the musket, they remained for some time chiefly armed in the fashion of the country, with sword and target ; they wore the Indian dress—the turban, vest, and long drawers—and were provided with native officers under English superior command. Under their European leaders they were found to do good service and to face danger with constancy and firmness. In the progress of time a considerable change took place, and natives of every description were enrolled in the service. Though some corps that were almost entirely formed of the lowest classes achieved considerable reputation for valour in the field, it was not considered safe to encourage the system ; and the company reverted to their practice of recruiting from none but the most respectable classes of native society. It is on record that a corps of 100 sepoys from Bombay and 400 from Tellicherry joined the army at Madras in 1747, that the regular sepoys at Madras were employed in the defence of Arcot (1751), and that a company of Bombay sepoys were present at the victory of Plassey.</p><p>For instances of the early occurrence of the word see Burnell and Yule’s <hi rend="italic">Glossary of Anglo-Indian Terms,</hi> s.v. On the history of the sepoys compare Captain Williams’s <hi rend="italic">Historical Account of the Rise and Progress of the Bengal Infantry</hi> (London, 1817) ; Captain Broome’s <hi rend="italic">History of the Rise and Progress of the Bengal Army</hi> (Calcutta, 1850) ; Colonel Wilson’s <hi rend="italic">History of the Madras Army</hi> (London, 1882-85, in 3 volumes) ; No. xxxvi. of the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Review</hi>; and the military histories of India generally.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
