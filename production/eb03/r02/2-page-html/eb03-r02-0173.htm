<p><span class="font0">to put himſelf in a condition for carrying on the war, and ſhortly after declared it againſt hi n in form. All&nbsp;Antony’s followers were invited over to join him, with&nbsp;great promiſes of rewards : but they were not declared&nbsp;enemies, partly to prevent their growing deſperate, and&nbsp;partly to give a ſhow of moderation to his own party.&nbsp;At length both found themſelves in readineſs to begin&nbsp;the war, and their armies were anſwerable to the empire they contended for. The one was followed by all&nbsp;the forces of the eaſt ; the other drew all the ſtrength&nbsp;of the weſt to ſupport his pretenſions. Antony’s force&nbsp;compoſed a body of ιoo,coo foot and 12,000 horſe ;&nbsp;while his fleet amounted to 500 ſhips of war. The army of Octavianus muſtered but 80,000 foot, but equalled his adverſary’s in his number of cavalry : his fleet&nbsp;was but half as numerous as Antony’s ; however, his&nbsp;ſhips were better built, and manned with better ſoldiers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The great deciſive engagement, which was a naval one, was fought near Actium, a city of Epirus, at the&nbsp;entrance of the gulph of Ambracia. Antony ranged&nbsp;his ſhips before the mouth of the gulph ; and Octavianus drew up his fleet in oppoſition. Neither general&nbsp;aſſumed any fixed ſtation to command in ; but went&nbsp;about from ſhip to ſhip wherever his preſence was neceſſary. In the mean time, the two land armies, on&nbsp;oppoſite ſides of the gulph, were drawn up, only as&nbsp;ſpectators of the engagement ; and encouraged the&nbsp;fleets by their ſhouts to engage. The battle began on&nbsp;both ſides with great ardour, and after a manner not&nbsp;practiſed upon former occaſions. The prows of their&nbsp;veſſels were armed with brazen points ; and with theſe&nbsp;they drove furiouſly againſt each other. In this conflict the ſhips of Antony came with greater force, but&nbsp;thoſe of Octavianus avoided the ſhock with greater dexterity. On Antony’s ſide, the Items of the ſhips were&nbsp;raiſed in form of a tower; ſrom whence they threw arrows from machines for that purpoſe. Thoſe of Octavianus made uſe of long poles hooked with iron, and&nbsp;fire-pots. They fought in this manner for ſome time&nbsp;with equal animoſity ; nor was there any advantage on&nbsp;either ſide, except a ſmall appearance of diſorder in the&nbsp;centre of Antony’s fleet. But all of a ſudden Cleopatra determined the fortune of the day. She was ſeen&nbsp;flying from the engagement attended by 60 ſail; ſtruck,&nbsp;perhaps, with the terrors natural to her ſex : but what&nbsp;increaſed the general amazement was, to behold Antony himſelf following ſoon after, and leaving his fleet at&nbsp;the mercy of the conquerers. The engagement, notwithſtanding, continued with great obſtinacy till five in&nbsp;the evening ; when Antony 's forces, partly conſtrained&nbsp;by the conduct of Agrippa, and partly perſuaded 'by&nbsp;the promiſes of Octavianus, ſubmitted to the-conqueror. The land-forces ſoon after followed the example&nbsp;of the navy ; and all yielded to the conqueι or without&nbsp;ſtriking a blow the fourth day after the battle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">λVhen Cleopatra fled, Antony purſued her in a five-oared galley ; and coming alongside of her ſhip entered, without ſeeing ör being ſeen by -her. She was in the ſtern, and he went to the prow, where he remained for ſome time ſilent, holding his head between his&nbsp;hands. In this manner he continued three whole days ;&nbsp;during which, either through indignation or ſhame, he&nbsp;neither ſaw nor ſpoke to Cleopatra. At laſt, when&nbsp;they were arrived at the promqntory of Tenants, the&nbsp;queen’s female attendants reconciled them, and everything went on as before. Still, however, he had the&nbsp;conſolation to ſuppoſe his army continued faithful to&nbsp;him ; and accordingly diſpatched orders to his lieutenant Canidius to conduct </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">it</span><span class="font0"> into Aſia. However, he&nbsp;was ſoon undeceived when he arrived in Africa, where&nbsp;he was informed of their ſubmiſſion to his rival. This&nbsp;account ſo tranſported him with rage, that he was hardly prevented from killing himſelf; but at length, at the&nbsp;entreaty of his friends, he returned to Alexandria, in a&nbsp;very different ſituation from that in which Ke had left&nbsp;it ſome time before. Cleopatra, however, ſeemed to&nbsp;retain that fortitude in her misfortunes which had utterly abandoned her admirer. Having amaſſed conſiderable&nbsp;riches by means of confiſcation and other acts of violence, ſhe formed a very Angular and unheard of project ; this was to convey her whole fleet over the iſthmus&nbsp;of Suez into the Red Sea, and thereby ſave herſelf in&nbsp;another region beyond the reach of Rome, with all her&nbsp;treaſures. Some of her veſſels were actually tranſported thither, purſuant to her orders ; but the Arabians&nbsp;having burnt them, and Antony diſſuading her from&nbsp;the deſign, ſhe abandoned it for the more improbable&nbsp;ſeheme of defending Egypt againſt the conqueror.—&nbsp;She omitted nothing in her power to put his advice in&nbsp;practice, and made all kinds of preparations for war ;&nbsp;at leaſt hoping thereby to obtain better terms from Octavianus. In fact, ſhe had always loved Antony’s fortunes rather than his perſon ; and if ſhe could have fallen&nbsp;upon any method of ſaving herſelf, though even at his&nbsp;expence, there is no doubt but ſhe would have embraced&nbsp;it with gladneſs. She even ſtill had ſome hopes from&nbsp;the power of her charms, though ſhe was arrived almoſt&nbsp;at the age of 40 ; and was deſirous of trying upon Octavianus thoſe arts which had been ſo ſucceſsful with the&nbsp;greateſt men of Rome. Thus, in three embaſſies which&nbsp;were ſent one after another from Antony to his rival in&nbsp;Aſia, the queen had always her ſecret agents, charged&nbsp;with particular propoſals in her name. Antony deſired&nbsp;no more than that his liſe might be ſpared, and to have&nbsp;the liberty of paſſing the remainder of his days in ob-ſcurity. To theſe propoſals Octavianus made no reply. Cleopatra ſent him alſo public propoſals in favour of her children ; but at the ſame time privately&nbsp;reſigned him her crown, with all the enſigns of royalty.&nbsp;To the queen’s public propoſal no anſwer was given j&nbsp;to her private offer he replied, by giving her aſſurances&nbsp;of his ſavour in caſe, ſhe ſent away Antony or put him&nbsp;to death. Theſe negociations were not ſo private but&nbsp;they came to the knowledge of Antony, whoſe jealouſy and rage was now heightened by every concurrence. He built a ſmall folitary houſe upon a mole in&nbsp;the ſea ; and there he paſſed his time, ſhunning all commerce with mankind, and profeſſing to imitate Timon&nbsp;the rran-hater. However, his furious jealouſy drove&nbsp;him even from this retreat into ſociety; for hearing&nbsp;that Cleopatra had many ſecret conferences with one&nbsp;Thyrſus, an emiſſary from Octavianus, he ſeized upon&nbsp;him, and having ordered him to be cruelly ſcourged,&nbsp;he ſent him back to his patron. At the ſame time he&nbsp;ſent letters by him, importing, that he had chaſtiſed&nbsp;Thyrſus for inſulting a man in his misfortunes ; but&nbsp;withal he gave his rival permiſſion to avenge himſelf,&nbsp;by ſcourging Hiparchus, Antony’s freedman, in the&nbsp;fame manner. The revenge, in this caſe, would have</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
