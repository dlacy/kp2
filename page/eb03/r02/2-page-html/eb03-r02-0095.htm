<p><span class="font0">the mercy of Louis XIII.. At the beginning of the firſt ſiege, the number of inhabitants in the city&nbsp;amounted to 72,000 ; in the ſecond they diminiſhed to&nbsp;28,000 ; and they were, when Mr Wraxal was there,&nbsp;between 17 and 18,000, of which ſcarce 2000 were&nbsp;Huguenots. The houſes of this city are fine, and ſupported with piazzas, under which perſons may walk in&nbsp;all weathers ; and the ſtreets in general are as ſtraight as&nbsp;a line. There ate ſeveral handſome churches, and other&nbsp;ſtructures, beſides a remarkable pump in the ſquare of&nbsp;Dauphiny, which throws out the water through ſeveral&nbsp;pipes. There are no remains of the old fortifications,&nbsp;except on the ſide of the harbour, where there are bulwarks and ſtrong towers to defend the entrance. The&nbsp;new fortifications are in the manner of Vauban. Before&nbsp;Canada was ceded to England·, and New Orleans to&nbsp;Spain, the trade of Rochelle was very lucrative. It&nbsp;revived about the year 1773, and, beſide that to the&nbsp;coaſt of Guinea and the Eaſt Indies, the inhabitants&nbsp;carried on a conſiderable trade in wines, brandy, fait,&nbsp;paper, linen cloth, and ſerge. It is ſeated on the&nbsp;ocean, in W. Long. 1. it. N. Lat. 46. 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROCHESTER, a city of Kent, in England, is ſituated on the Medway, ſeven miles and a half north&nbsp;of Maidſtone, and 30 from London. It appears to&nbsp;have been one of the Roman ſtations, from the bricks&nbsp;in the walls, as well as the Roman coins that have been&nbsp;found about it. It has three pariſh churches built with&nbsp;ſtone and flints, beſides the cathedral, which is but a&nbsp;mean ſtructure. This little city, which was made a biſhop’s ſee by king Ethelbert, anno 604, has met with&nbsp;many misfortunes. In 676, it was ſacked by Eldred&nbsp;king of Mercia; in 839 and 885, beſieged by the&nbsp;L)anes, but reſcued by king Alfred. About 1 co years&nbsp;after, it was beſieged by king Ethelred, and forced to&nbsp;pay L. 100. Anno 999 it was taken and plundered by&nbsp;the Danes. Anno 1088 it was beſieged and taken by&nbsp;William Rufus. In king John’s time it was taken&nbsp;from the Barons, after three month’s ſiege ; and the&nbsp;very next year, viz. 1 256, its caſtle, founded by William the Conqueror, was ſtormed and taken by ſeveral&nbsp;.of the Barons, under the French king’s ſon. In the&nbsp;ιct&quot;gn of Henry III. it was beſieged by Simon Mont-ford, who burnt its then wooden bridge and tower, and&nbsp;ſpoiled the church and priory, and then marched off.&nbsp;This city has alſo been ſeveral times deſtroyed by fire,&nbsp;viz. in 1130, on June 3. in 1137, and in 1177; after&nbsp;which it is ſaid to have continued deſolate till 1225,&nbsp;when it was repaired, ditched, and walled round. In&nbsp;the Saxon heptarchy there were three mints in Rocheſ-ter, two ſor the king and one for the biſhop. In 1281,&nbsp;its old wooden bridge was carried off by the ice, in a&nbsp;ſudden thaw after a froſt which had made the Medway&nbsp;paſſable on foot. Another was built in the reign of&nbsp;Richard II. but pulled down again, on the rumour oſ&nbsp;an invaſion from France. It was afterwards reſtored,&nbsp;but ſo often ſubject to expenſive repairs, by reaſon of&nbsp;the rapid courſe of the river under it, as well as the&nbsp;great breadth and depth of it, that in the reign of Edward III. it was reſolved to build a new bridge of ſtone ;&nbsp;and the ſame was begun, and in a manner completed,&nbsp;at the expence of Sir John Cobham and Sir Robert&nbsp;Knolles, Edward III.’s generals, out of the ſpoils they&nbsp;bad taken in <sub>ι</sub>France. It has 21 arches. The town&nbsp;is ‘governed by a mayor, recorder, 12 aldeιmen, 12</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">common ∙councirmen, a town-clerk, three ſerjeants at mace, and a water-bailiff. To its cathedral belong a&nbsp;dean and fix prebendaries. Gundulph’s tower ſtands&nbsp;on the north ſide of the cathedral, and is ſuppoſed&nbsp;to have been built by the biſhop, as a place of fecurity for the treaſures and archives of that church and&nbsp;ſee. Some ſuppoſe it to have been intended for a&nbsp;bell tower, and others for an eccleſiaſtical priſon ; but&nbsp;whatever might be its deſtination, its machicolations, its&nbsp;loop-hole windows, and the thickneſs of its walls,&nbsp;ſhows ſtrength and defence were conſidered as neceſſary.&nbsp;This tower was 60 ſeet high, but ſome part has lately&nbsp;fallen down ; the walls are fix feet thick, and contain&nbsp;within them an area of 20 feet ſquare : it was divided&nbsp;into five floors or ſtories of unequal height, and had a&nbsp;communication with the upper part of the church, by&nbsp;means of an arch or bridge, the ſteps of which are ſtill&nbsp;viſible. It is ſuppoſed to have been erected after the&nbsp;cathedral was built. For the maintenance of its bridge,&nbsp;certain lands are tied down by parliament, to which it&nbsp;has ſent members from the firſt. The town-houſe,&nbsp;built in the year 1687, ſor the courts, aſſizes, and ſeſ-ſions, and the charity-ſchool, are two of the beſt public buildings here.—A mathematical ſchool was founded&nbsp;here, and an alms-houſe for lodging fix poor travellers&nbsp;every night, and allowing them 4 d. in the morning&nbsp;when they depart, except perſons contagiouſiy diſeaſed,&nbsp;rogues, and proctors. In the ſummer here are always&nbsp;fix or eight lodgers, who are admitted by tickets from&nbsp;the mayor. The Roman Watling-ſtreet runs through&nbsp;this town from Shooters-Hill to Dover. The mayor&nbsp;and citizens hold what is called an admiralty-court 01ice&nbsp;a-year for regulating the oyſter-ſiſhery in the creeks and&nbsp;branches of the Medway that are within their juriſdic-tion, and for proſecuting the cable-hangers, as they are&nbsp;called, who dredge and fiſh ſor oyſters without being&nbsp;free, by having fen<sup>τ</sup>ed ſeven years apprenticeſhip to a&nbsp;fiſherman who is free of the ſiſhery. Every licenſed&nbsp;dredger pays 6s. 8d. a-year to the ſupport of the courts,&nbsp;and the ſiſhery is now in a flouriſhing way. Part of the&nbsp;caſtle is kept in repair, and is uſed as a magazine, where&nbsp;a party of ſoldiers do conſtant duty. The bridge was repaired in 1744, and palliſadoed with new iron rails. Ro∙&nbsp;cheſter contains about 700 houſes, and 2000 inhabitants.&nbsp;It conſiſts of only one principal ſtreet, which is wide,&nbsp;and paved with flints. The houſes are generally well&nbsp;built with brick, and inhabited by tradeſmen and innkeepers. It has alſo four narrow ſtreets ; but no fort&nbsp;of manufactory is carried on here. Stroud is at the&nbsp;weft end of this place, and Chatham at the eaſt. It is&nbsp;27 miles north-weſt by well of Canterbury, and 30&nbsp;ſouth-eaſt by eaſt of London. Long. o. 36.
