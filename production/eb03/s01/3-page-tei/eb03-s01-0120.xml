When he was very young, he received the uſual inſtructions of a private ſchool; and was afterwards advanced to an academy. At a very early age he ſhewed a ſtrong deſire to follow the profeſſion of an apothecary, and his father ſuffered him to gratify his inclinations. With Mr Bauch, an apothecary at Gottenburg, he paſſed his apprenticeſhip, which was completed in ſix years. He remained, however, ſome time longer at that place, and it was there that he ſo excellently laid the firſt foundations of his knowledge. Among the various books which he read, that treated of chemical ſubjects, Kunckel's Laboratory ſeems to have been his favourite. He uſed to repeat many of the experiments contained in that work privately in the night, when the reſt of the family had retired to reſt. A friend of Scheele’s had remarked the progreſs which he had made in chemiſtry, and had aſked him by what inducements he had been at firſt led to ſtudy a ſcience in which he had gained ſuch knowledge? Scheele returned the following anſwer: “The firſt cauſe, my friend, aroſe from yourſelf. Nearly at the beginning of my apprenticeſhip you adviſed me to read Neuman’s Chemiſtry; from the peruſal of which I became eager to make experiments myſelf; and I remember very well how I mixed together, in a conſerve-glaſs, oil of cloves and fuming acid of nitre, which immediately took fire. I ſee alſo ſtill before my eyes an unlucky experiment which I made with pyrophorus. Circum- ſtances of this kind did but the more inflame my deſire to repeat experiments. ” After Scheele’s departure from Gottenburg, in the year 1765, he obtained a place with Kalſtrom, an apothecary at Malmo. Two years afterwards he went from thence to Stockholm, and managed there the ſhop of Mr Scharenberg. In 1773, he changed this appointment for another at Upſal, under Mr Loock. Here he was fortunately ſituated; as, from his acquaintance with learned men, and from having free acceſs to the Univerſity Laboratory, he had opportunities of increaſing his knowledge. At this place alſo he happily commenced the friendſhip which ſubfiſted between him and Bergman. During his reſidence at this place, his Royal Highneſs Prince Henry of Pruſſia, accompanied by the Duke of Sun</p><p>derland, viſited Upſal, and choſe this opportunity to ſee the Academical Laboratory. Scheele was accordingly appointed by the Univerſity to exhibit ſome chemical experiments to them. This office he undertook, and ſhewed ſome of the moſt curious proceſſes in chemiſtry. The two Princes aſked him many queſtions, and expreſſed their approbation of the anſwers which he returned to them. The Duke aſked him what countryman he was, and ſeemed to be much pleaſed when Scheele informed him that he was born at Stralſund, At their departure they told the profeſſor, who was preſent, that they ſhould eſteem it a favour if he would permit the young man to have free acceſs to the Laboratory, as often as he choſe, to make experiments.</p><p>In the year 1777 Scheele was appointed by the Medical College to be apothecary at Koping. It was at that place that he ſoon ſhewed the world how great a man he was, and that no place or ſituation could confine his abilities. When he was at Stockholm he ſhewed his acuteneſs as a chemiſt, as he diſcovered there the new and wonderful acid contained in the ſparry fluor. It has been confidently aſſerted, that Scheele was the firſt who diſcovered the nature of the aerial acid; and that whilſt he was at Upſal he made many experiments to prove its properties. This circumſtance might probably have furniſhed Bergman with the means of handling this ſubject more fully. At the ſame place he began the ſeries of excellent experiments on that remarkable mineral ſubſtance, manganeſe; from which inveſtigation he was led to make the very valuable and intereſting diſcovery of the dephlogiſticated marine acid. At the ſame time he firſt obſerved the ponderous earth.</p><p>At Koping he finiſhed his diſſertation on Air and Fire; a work which the celebrated Bergman moſt warmly recommended in the friendly preface which he wrote for it. The theory which Scheele endeavours to prove in this treatiſe is, that fire confiſts of pure air and phlogiſton. According to more recent opinions (if inflammable air be phlogiſton), water is compoſed of theſe two principles. Of theſe opinions we may ſay, in the words of Cicero, "<hi rend="italic">Opiniones tam variae ſunt, tamque inter ſe diſſidentes, ut alterum profecto fieri potest, ut earum nulla, alterum certe non potest ut plus una, vera fit. ”</hi> The author’s merit in this work, excluſive of the encomiums of Bergman, was ſufficient to obtain the approbation of the public; as the ingenuity diſplayed in handling ſo delicate a ſubject, and the many new and valuable obſervations @@<hi rend="smallcaps">(a)</hi> which are diſperſed through the treatiſe, juſtly entitled the author to that fame which his book procured him. It was ſpread abroad through every country, became ſoon out of print, was reprinted, and tranſlated into many languages. The Engliſh tranſiation is enriched with the notes of that accurate and truly philoſophic genius Richard Kirwan, Eſq.</p><p>Scheele now diligently employed himſelf in contributing to the Tranſactions of the Academy at Stockholm.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">@@@ (a)</hi> Scheele mentions in this work, in a curſory way, the decompoſition of common ſalt by the calx of lead. Mr Turner, a gentleman who happily unites the ſkill of the manufacturer with the knowledge of the philoſophic chemiſt, has alſo all the merit of this diſcovery, as he obſerved the ſame fact, without having been indebted to Scheele’s hint on this ſubject. Mr Turner has done more; he has converted this diſcovery to ſome uſe in the arts; he produces mineral alkali for ſale, ariſing from this decompoſition; and from the lead, which is united to the marine acid he forms the beautiful pigment called the <hi rend="italic">patent yellow.</hi></p></body></text></TEI>
