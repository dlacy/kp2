The name is properly “ scavager ” or “ scaveger ” (the <hi rend="italic">n</hi> being intrusive as in “ passenger ” and “ messenger ”), an official who was concerned with the receipt of custom duties and the inspection <hi rend="italic">(scavage)</hi> of im-ported goods. The “ scavagers ” are found with such officials of the City of London as aleconners, beadles, &amp;amp;c., in the <hi rend="italic">Liber Albus (Munimenta Gildhallae Londoniensis,</hi> ed. Riley). These officials seem to have been charged also with the cleaning of the streets, and the name superseded the older <hi rend="italic">rakyer</hi> for those who performed this duty. Skeat takes “ scavage ” to be a Low French corruption of “ showage,” spelled variously as <hi rend="italic">schewage, sceυage,</hi> &amp;amp;c., and, therefore, to be derived from “ show,” to exhibit for inspection.</p><pb xml:id="eb11-24-s03-0306" facs="encyclopaediabri24chisrich_0329.jp2"/>
