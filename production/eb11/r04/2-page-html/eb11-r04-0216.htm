<p><span class="font0">ROSAMOND, known as “The Fair” (d. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">c.</span><span class="font0"> 1176), mistress of Henry II., king of England, is believed to have been the&nbsp;daughter of Walter de Clifford of the family of Fitz-Ponce.&nbsp;The evidence for the paternity is, however, only an entry of&nbsp;a statement made by the jurors of the manor of Corfham in a&nbsp;Hundred Roll of the second year of the reign of Edward I.&nbsp;(1274), great grandson of Henry II. Rosamond is said to have&nbsp;been Henry’s mistress secretly for several years, but was openly&nbsp;acknowledged by him only when he imprisoned his wife Eleanor&nbsp;of Acquitaine as a punishment for her encouragement of her&nbsp;sons in the rebellion of 1173-74. She died in or about 1176,&nbsp;and was buried in the nunnery church of Godstow before the&nbsp;high altar. The body was removed by order of St Hugh,&nbsp;bishop of Lincoln, in 1191, and was, seemingly, reinterred in&nbsp;the chapter house. The story that she was poisoned by Queen&nbsp;Eleanor first appears in the French Chronicle of London in the&nbsp;14th century. The romantic details of the labyrinth at Wood-stock, and the clue which guided King Henry II. to her bower,&nbsp;were the inventions of story-writers of later times. There is&nbsp;no evidence for the belief that she was the mother of Henry’s&nbsp;natural son William Longsword, earl of Salisbury.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROSARIO, a city and river port of Argentina, in the province of Santa Fé, on the W. bank of the Paraná, 186 m. by rail N.W.&nbsp;of Buenos Aires. Pop. (1904, estimate) 120,000. It is accessible to ocean-going steamers of medium draught. The city&nbsp;stands on the eastern margin of the great pampean plain,&nbsp;65 to 75 ft. above the wide river-bed washed out by the Parana.&nbsp;It extends back a considerable distance from the river, and&nbsp;there are country residences and gardens of the better class&nbsp;along the line of the Central Argentine railway and northward&nbsp;toward San Lorenzo. The city is laid out with chessboard&nbsp;regularity, and the streets are paved (in great part with cobblestones), lighted with gas and electricity, traversed by tramway&nbsp;lines, and provided with sewers and water mains. The Boulevard El Santafecino is an attractive residence street with&nbsp;double driveways separated by a strip of garden and bordered&nbsp;by fine shade trees. The chief edifices of an official character&nbsp;are the custom house, post office, municipal hall and law courts.&nbsp;There is a large charity hospital, and the English and German&nbsp;colonies maintain a well-equipped infirmary. The largest&nbsp;sugar refinery in Argentina is here, and there are flour-mills,&nbsp;breweries and some smaller manufactures. The city is chiefly&nbsp;commercial, being the shipping port for a large part of northern&nbsp;Argentina, among its exports being wheat, flour, baled hay,&nbsp;linseed, Indian corn, sugar, rum, cattle, hides, meats, wool,&nbsp;quebracho extract, &amp;c. The railway connexions are good,&nbsp;including the Buenos Aires and Rosario and the Central Argentine lines to the national capital, the Buenos Aires and Rosario&nbsp;line northward to Tucuman, where it connects with the government Jine to Salta, Jujuy and the Bolivian frontier, the Central&nbsp;Argentine line westward to Cordoba, with connexions at Villa&nbsp;Maria for Mendoza and the Chilean frontier, and two narrow-gauge lines, one running to Santa Fé and the other to Cordoba.&nbsp;The port of Rosario has hitherto consisted of a deep river&nbsp;anchorage and wooden wharves on the lower bank for the&nbsp;accommodation of steamers. Since 1902 work has been in&nbsp;progress under a contract with a French company for the&nbsp;construction of 12,697 ft* of quays, 23 m. of railway tracks&nbsp;along the quays to connect with the several railways entering&nbsp;the city, drawbridges, roadways, sheds, depots, elevator, offices,&nbsp;electric plant, fixed and movable cranes, and other appliances,&nbsp;&amp;c., for the handling of produce and merchandise. The&nbsp;trade of the port was officially valued at 21,276,672 Arg.&nbsp;gold dollars imports, and 68,503,231 gold dollars exports in&nbsp;1905.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rosario was founded in 1730 by Francisco Godoy, but it grew so slowly that it was still a small village up to the middle&nbsp;of the 19th century. In 1854 General Justo José de Urquiza,&nbsp;then at the head of the Argentine Confederation, made it the&nbsp;port of the ten inland provinces then at war with Buenos Aires,&nbsp;and in 1857 imposed differential duties on the cargoes of vessels&nbsp;first breaking bulk at the southern port. This gave Rosario&nbsp;a start, and its trade and population have grown since then with&nbsp;great rapidity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROSARY (Lat. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rosarium), </span><span class="font0">a popular devotion of the Roman Catholic Church, consisting of 15 Paternosters and Glorias and&nbsp;150 Aves, recited on beads. It is divided into three parts, each&nbsp;containing five decades, a decade comprising 1 Pater, 10 Aves&nbsp;and a Gloria, in addition to a subject for meditation selected&nbsp;from the “ mysteries ” of the life of Christ and of the Blessed&nbsp;Virgin. The Christian practice of repeating prayers is traceable&nbsp;to early times: Sozomen mentions </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(H.E.</span><span class="font0"> v. 29) the hermit Paul&nbsp;of the 4th century who threw away a pebble as he recited each&nbsp;of his 300 daily prayers; and a canon of the English synod of&nbsp;Cealcythe in 816 (Mansi xiv. 360) directed </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">septem bellidwn&nbsp;Paternoster</span><span class="font0"> to be said for a deceased bishop. In many orders&nbsp;the lay brothers daily said a large number of Paternosters&nbsp;instead of reading the breviary; it was natural that the Paternoster should be the prayer most often repeated. The Ave&nbsp;Maria is first mentioned as a form of prayer in the second half&nbsp;of the nth century, but it was not until the 16th century that&nbsp;it became general in its present form. It is not known precisely&nbsp;when the mechanical device of the rosary was first used. William&nbsp;of Malmesbury </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(De gest. pont. Angl.</span><span class="font0"> iv. 4) says that Godiva, who&nbsp;founded a religious house at Coventry in 1040, left a string of&nbsp;jewels, on which she had told her prayers, that it might be hung&nbsp;on the statue of the Blessed Virgin. Thomas of Chantimpr6,&nbsp;who wrote about the middle of the 13th century, first mentions the word “ rosary ” </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(De apibus,</span><span class="font0"> ii. 13), using it apparently&nbsp;in a mystical sense as Mary’s rose-garden. There is no contemporary confirmation of the story that the rosary was given&nbsp;to St Dominic through revelation of the Blessed Virgin and&nbsp;was employed during the crusade against the Albigenses,&nbsp;although the story was later accepted by Leo X., Pius V.,&nbsp;Gregory XIII., Sixtus V., Alexander VII., Innocent XI. and&nbsp;Clement XI. According to Benedict XIV. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(De Fest.</span><span class="font0"> 160), the&nbsp;belief rests on the tradition of the Dominican order. Whatever&nbsp;may have been the origin of the rosary, the Dominicans did&nbsp;much to propagate the devotion. The practice of meditating&nbsp;on the mysteries doubtless began with a Dominican, Alanus&nbsp;de Rupe (born 1428), and another Dominican, Jacob Sprenger&nbsp;(d. 1495), grand-inquisitor in Germany, founded the first confraternity of the rosary at Cologne in 1475. This society spread&nbsp;rapidly, and was specially privileged by Sixtus IV., Innocent&nbsp;VIII. and Leo. X. After the battle of Lepanto (1st Sunday in&nbsp;October 1571), which was won while the members of the&nbsp;confraternity at Rome were making supplication for Christian&nbsp;success, Pius V. ordered an annual commemoration of “St&nbsp;Mary of Victory,” and Gregory XIII., by bull of the 1st of April&nbsp;1583, set aside the 1st Sunday in October as the feast of the&nbsp;Rosary of the Blessed Virgin Mary, to be observed in such&nbsp;churches as maintained an altar in honour of the rosary. Clement&nbsp;XI., by bull of the 3rd of October 1716, directed the observance&nbsp;of the feast by all Christendom. The devotion has been&nbsp;particularly fostered by the Jesuits, St Ignatius Loyola having&nbsp;expressly ordered its use. It has been repeatedly indulgenced&nbsp;by various popes. Leo XIII. issued eight encyclicals on the&nbsp;devotion; he urged its recitation throughout October, and&nbsp;directed (1883) the insertion of the title </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">regina sacratissimi&nbsp;rosarii</span><span class="font0"> in the Litany. There are several varieties of the rosary&nbsp;more or less in use by Roman Catholics: the Passionists, or&nbsp;rosary of the five wounds, approved by Leo XII. in 1823;&nbsp;the Crown of Our Lord, attributed to Michael of Florence, a&nbsp;Camaldolese monk (c. 1516), and consisting of 33 Paters,&nbsp;5 Aves and a Credo; St Bridget’s, 7 Paters and 63 Aves, in&nbsp;honour of the joys and sorrows of the Blessed Virgin and the&nbsp;63 years of her life. The Living Rosary, in which 15 persons&nbsp;unite to say the rosary every month, was approved by Gregory&nbsp;XVI. (1832) and placed in charge of the Dominican order by&nbsp;Pius IX. (1877).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Similar expedients to assist the memory in repetitions of prayers occur among Buddhists and Mahommedans: in the&nbsp;former case the prayers are said on a string of some hundred&nbsp;beads, called the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">tibet-pren-ba</span><span class="font0"> or the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ten-wa\</span><span class="font0"> in the latter case,</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
