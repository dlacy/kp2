            <p>the arches deſcribed, the bend mould muſt be ſo placed on the riſing line of the
                floor, that the back of it may touch the back of the under breadth ſweep. But the
                general practice is, to deſcribe all the floor ſweeps with compaſſes, as well as the
                under breadth ſweeps, and to reconcile theſe two by a mould wſhich is an arch of a
                circle, its radius being the same with that of the reconciling ſweep by which the
                midſhip frame was formed. It is uſual for all the floor ſweeps to be of the same
                radius ; and in order to find their centres a line is formed on the floor plan for
                the half breadth of the floor. As this line cannot be deſcribed on the ſurface of a
                ſhip, it is therefore only an imaginary line. Instead of it ſome make uſe of a
                diagonal in the body plane to limit the half breadth of the floor upon every rising
                line, and to erect perpendiculars at the ſeveral interſections, in the lame manner
                as for the midſhip frame.</p>
            <p>After the ſweeps are all deſcribed, recpurſe is had to moulds, or some such
                contrivance, to form the hollow of the timbers, much in the same manner as in whole
                moulding ; and when all the timbers are formed, they muſt be proved by ribband and
                water lines, and altered, it necessary, to make fair curves.</p>
            <p>The preceding methods of deſcribing the ſeveral planes or ſections of a ſhip being
                well underſtood, it will be a very eaſy matter to conſtruct draughts for any
                propoſed ſhip : and as the above planes were deſcribed ſeparately and independent of
                each other, it is therefore of little conſequence which is firſt deſcribed. In the
                following application, however, the plane oſ elevation will be first drawn, then
                part of the floor plan, and lastly the body plan : and in connecting theſe plans the
                most rational and simple methods will be employed.</p>

                breadth plan, and mark on it the ſtations of the ſquare timbers and the side of the
                ſtem ; apply the batton to the ſheer plan, and place it to the ſheer of the ſhip,
                keeping the ſtations of the timbers on the batton well with thoſe on the ſheer plan
                for ſeveral timbers before dead-flat, where they will not alter ; then mark the
                other timbers and the ſtem on the ſheer line produced ; through theſe points draw
                lines parallel, to the keel, to interſect their correſponding timbers and the ſtem.
                in the ſheer plan ; then a curve deſcribed theſe last points will be the ſheer of
                the ſhip round the bow, lifted as required : and the heights of the timbers thus
                lengthened are to be transferred to the body- plan as before.</p>
            <p>Draw the line AB (fig. 32.) equal to 22 feet, the whole breadth ; from the middle of
                which draw the perpendicular CD : make CE equal to half the thickneſs.</p>
