<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">aſſembly was </span><span class="font0">thereafter opened by a ſhort ſpeech ſrom the throne, in which the king congratulated hitnſelf up-on thus meeting his people aſſembled ; alluded to the&nbsp;national debt, and the taxes, which were ſeverely felt&nbsp;becaufe unequally levied ; he took notice of the general difcontent and ſpirit of innovation which prevailed,&nbsp;but declared his confidence in the wifdom of the aſſembly for remedying every evil. “ May an happy union&nbsp;(added he) reign in this aſſembly; and may this epocha&nbsp;become ever memorable for the happineſs and proſperi-tv of the country. It is the wiſh of my heart ; it is&nbsp;the moſt ardent deſire of my prayers ; it is, in ſhort,&nbsp;the price which I expect from the ſincerity of my intentions and my love for my people.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">M. Barretin, the keeper of the feals, next addreſſcd the aſſembly<sup>,</sup>in a congratulatory and unintereſting ſpeech.&nbsp;He was followed by the popular miniſter M. Neckar,&nbsp;who ſpoke for three hours. Though much applauded&nbsp;on account of the clear financial details which his ſpeech&nbsp;contained, he encountered a certain degree of cenſure&nbsp;from all parties, on account of the cautious ambiguity&nbsp;which he obferved with regard to the future proceedings&nbsp;of the ſtates-generah</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Next day the three orders aſſembled ſcparately. The deputies of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">tiers etat</span><span class="font0"> amounted to 600 in number, and thoſe of the nobles and clergy to 300 each.&nbsp;During their firſt fittings much time was ſpent in&nbsp;unimportant debates about trifling points of form ;&nbsp;but the firſt important queſtion, that neceſſarily became the fubject of their diſcuſſion, was the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">verification&nbsp;•ſ thctr powers,</span><span class="font0"> or production of the commiſſions of the&nbsp;members, and inveſtigation of their authenticity. The&nbsp;commons </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(tiers etat)</span><span class="font0"> laid hold of this as a pretext for&nbsp;opening the grand controverſy, whether the ſtates-general ſhould fit in one or in three feparate chambers ? They&nbsp;ſent a deputation inviting the nobles and the clergy to&nbsp;meet along with them in the common hall for the purpoſe of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">verifying their powers</span><span class="font0"> in one common aſſembly.&nbsp;In the chamber of the clergy 114 members voted for the&nbsp;performance of this ceremony in the general aſſembly ;&nbsp;and 133 againſt it. But in the more haughty order&nbsp;of the nobles, the refolution for the verification in their&nbsp;own aſſembly was carried by a majority of 188 againſt&nbsp;47. The commons paid no regard to this. They&nbsp;were conducted by bold and ſkilful leaders, who diſ-cerned the importance of the point in conteſt, and re-folved not to abandon it. Aware of the exigencies of&nbsp;the ſtate, they knew that the crown was nearly verging&nbsp;upon bankruptcy ; and that ſuch were the deficiencies&nbsp;of the revenue that only a ſhort delay was neceſſary to&nbsp;accompliſh the abſolute diſſolution of the government.&nbsp;They ſuſſered five weeks to pals away therefore in total inactivity. During this period propoſals were made&nbsp;on the part of the miniſtry for a pacification between&nbsp;the three orders, and conferences were opened by com-miſſioners from each. But no art could ſeduce the&nbsp;commons from their original purpoſe, or prevail with&nbsp;them to enter upon the bull nefs of the ſtate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The nation had expected much from the aſſembling of the ſtates-general, and learnt the news of their inaction with no fmall degree of concern. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">tiers etat</span><span class="font0"> was&nbsp;naturally popular, and the public cenſure could not&nbsp;readily devolve upon that favourite order. Moreover,&nbsp;ſrom the firſt period of their aſſembling the commons&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">made every effort to augment their own natural popu</span><span class="font0">larity. They admitted all perſons promiſcuoufly into&nbsp;the galleries, and even into the body of their hail. No&nbsp;reſtraint was attempted to be laid upon the moſt vehement marks oſ popular applauſe or cenſure. Lifts of&nbsp;the voters names were publicly taken and ſent to Paris&nbsp;upon every remarkable occaſion ; and the members ſud-denly found themſelves become, according to their political ſentiments, the objects of general execration or&nbsp;applauſe. The new and bold notions of liberty that&nbsp;were daily advanced by the leaders of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">tiers etat</span><span class="font0"> were&nbsp;received with acclamation by their hearers. The capi-tal became intereſted in the iſſue of every debate ; and&nbsp;the political fervor was eagerly imbibed by the nation&nbsp;with that vivacity which is ſo peculiar to the French.&nbsp;The commons accuſed the nobles of obſtinately impeding the buſineſs of the ſtate, by refuſing to verify their&nbsp;powers in one common aſſembly. The accuſation was&nbsp;ſwallowed by the multitude, who ſaw not, or were unwilling to ſee, that the attack was made by their own&nbsp;favourite order. In the mean time the nobles became&nbsp;rapidly more and more unpopular. Their perfons were&nbsp;inſulted, new publications daily came forth, and were&nbsp;greedily bought up, which reviled their whole order,&nbsp;and repreſented them as an uſeleſs or pernicious body&nbsp;of men, whoſe exiſtence ought not to be tolerated in a&nbsp;free ſtate. whoever adhered to them was branded with&nbsp;the odious appellation of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Briβocrate.</span><span class="font0"> The clergy, from&nbsp;the influence of the pariſh </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">curés</span><span class="font0"> or parfons, feemed ready</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">to defert their cauſe. They were even oppoſed by a minority of their own body, which derived luſtre from ha-ving at its head the duke of orleans, the firſt prince of the blood. Still, however, the majority of the&nbsp;nobles remained firm ; well aware, that if they once con-fented to lit in the ſame aſſembly, and to vote promif-cuouſly, with the ambitious and more numerous body of&nbsp;the commons, their wdιole order, and all its ſplendid&nbsp;privileges, muſt ſpeedily be overthrown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The leaders of the commons ſaw the change that was taking place in the minds of men ; and they at&nbsp;length regarded the period as arrived when they ought&nbsp;to emerge from their inactivity, and execute the daring&nbsp;project of ſeizing the legiſlative authority in their country. They declared that the reprefentatives of the&nbsp;nobles and the clergy were only the deputies of particular incorporations whom they would allow to fit&nbsp;and vote along with themſelves ; but who had no&nbsp;title in a collective capacity to act as the legiſlators of&nbsp;Franc,e. For conducting buſineſs with more facility,&nbsp;they appointed 20 committees. In conſequence of&nbsp;a propoſal by the Abbé Sieyes, a final meſſage was&nbsp;fent to the privileged orders requiring their attendance&nbsp;as individuals, and intimating that the commons, as thc&nbsp;deputies of 96 out of every hundred of their country-men, were about to affume the exclufive power of le-giſlation. None of the nobles obeyed this ſummons ;&nbsp;but three cures, Meſſrs Ceſve, Ballard, and Jalot, preſented their commiſſions, and were received with loud&nbsp;acclamations. They were next day followed by five&nbsp;more, among whom were Meſſrs Gregoire, Dillon, and&nbsp;Bodineau. After ſome debate concerning the appella-tion which they ought to affirme, the commons, with&nbsp;ſuch of the clergy as had joined them, ſolemnly voted&nbsp;themſelves the fovereign legiſlators of their country un-derthe name of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">National Λffembly,</span><span class="font0"> The reſultof the&nbsp;vote was no ſooner declared, than the hall reſounded</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
