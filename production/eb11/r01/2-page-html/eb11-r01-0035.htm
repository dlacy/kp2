<p><span class="font0">removal from the emanation for 20 minutes, radium A has practically disappeared and the α rays arise entirely from radium&nbsp;C. Radium C has proved very valuable in radioactive measurements as providing an intense source of homogeneous α rays.&nbsp;Twenty-four hours after removal, the activity due to radium&nbsp;B and C has become exceedingly small. The wire, however,&nbsp;still shows a very small residual activity, first noted by Mme&nbsp;Curie. This residual activity measured by the α rays rapidly&nbsp;increases with the time and reaches a maximum in about three&nbsp;years. The active deposit of slow change has been examined&nbsp;in detail by Rutherford (23) and by Meyer and Schweidler (24).&nbsp;It has been shown to consist of three successive products called&nbsp;radium D, E and F. Radium D is a rayless substance of slow&nbsp;period of transformation. Its period has been calculated by&nbsp;Rutherford to be about 40 years, and by Meyer and Schweidler&nbsp;about 12 years. Antonoff (25) fixes the period of about 17&nbsp;years. Radium D changes into E, a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ß</span><span class="font0"> ray product of period&nbsp;about 5 days, and E into F, an α ray product of period&nbsp;140 days. It was at first thought that radium E was complex,&nbsp;but no evidence of this has been observed by Antonoff. The&nbsp;product radium F is of special interest, for it is identical with&nbsp;polonium—the first active body separated by Mme Curie. In&nbsp;a similar way it has been shown that radium D is the primary&nbsp;source of the activity observed in lead or “ radiolead ” separated&nbsp;by Hofmann. It is interesting to note what valuable results&nbsp;have been obtained from an examination of the minute residual&nbsp;activity observed on bodies exposed in the presence of the radium&nbsp;emanation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Radium Emanation. —</span><span class="font0">The radium emanation is to be regarded as a typical radioactive product or transition element which&nbsp;exists in a gaseous form. It is produced from radium at a&nbsp;constant rate, and is transformed into radium A and helium.&nbsp;Its half-period of transformation is 3·86 days. The emanation&nbsp;from radium has been purified by condensing it in liquid air,&nbsp;and pumping out the residual gases. The volume (26) of the&nbsp;emanation at normal pressure and temperature to be derived&nbsp;from one gram of radium in equilibrium is about o∙6 cubic milli-mctrcs. This small quantity of gas contains initially more&nbsp;than three-quarters of the total activity of the radium before&nbsp;its separation. In a pure state, the emanation is 100, 000 times&nbsp;as active weight for weight as pure radium. Pure emanation&nbsp;in a spectrum tube gives a characteristic spectrum of bright&nbsp;lines (27). The discharge in the gas is bluish in colour. With&nbsp;continued sparking, the emanation is driven into the walls of&nbsp;the tube and the electrodes. Notwithstanding the minute&nbsp;volume of emanation available, the boiling-point of the emana-tion has been determined at various pressures. At atmo-spheric pressure Rutherford (28) found the boiling-point to be&nbsp;— 67° C., and Gray and Ramsay (29) 71° C. Liquid emanation&nbsp;appears colourless when first condensed; when the temperature&nbsp;is lowered, the liquid emanation freezes, and at the temperature&nbsp;of liquid air glows with a bright rose colour. The density of&nbsp;liquid emanation has been estimated at 5 or 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Approximate estimates of the molecular weight of the radium emanation were early made by diffusion methods. The molecular weight in most cases came out about 100. In a comparison by Perkins of the rate of diffusion of the emanation&nbsp;with that of a monatomic vapour of high molecular weight, viz.&nbsp;mercury, the value deduced was 234. Since the radium atom&nbsp;in breaking up gives rise to one atom of the emanation and one&nbsp;atom of helium, its atomic weight should be 226—4=222.&nbsp;The emanation appears to have no definite chemical properties,&nbsp;and in this respect belongs to the group of inert monatomic&nbsp;gases of which helium and argon are the best known examples.&nbsp;It is partially soluble in water, and readily absorbed by charcoal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Thorium. </span><span class="font0">—The first product observed in thorium was the emanation. This gives rise to the active deposit which has been&nbsp;analysed by Rutherford, Miss Brooks and by Hahn, and shown&nbsp;to consist of probably four products—thorium A, B, C and D.&nbsp;Thorium A is a rayless product of period 10‧5 hours; thorium&nbsp;B an α ray product of period about one hour. The presence&nbsp;of thorium C has been inferred from the two types of α rays&nbsp;present in the active deposit, but no chemical separation of&nbsp;B and C has yet been found possible. Hahn has shown that&nbsp;thorium D—a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ß</span><span class="font0"> ray product of period 3 minutes—can easily be&nbsp;separated by the recoil method. A special interest attaches&nbsp;to the product thorium X (30), which was first separated by&nbsp;Rutherford and Soddy, since experiments with this substance&nbsp;laid the foundation of the general theory of radioactive trans-formations. A close analysis of thorium has led to the separation of a number of new products. Hahn (31) found that a&nbsp;very active substance emitting α rays, which gave rise to thorium&nbsp;X, could be separated from thorium minerals. This active&nbsp;substance, called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">radiothorium,</span><span class="font0"> has been closely examined by&nbsp;Hahn and Blanc. Its period of decay was found by Hahn to&nbsp;be about 2 years, and by Blanc to be 737 days. From an&nbsp;examination of the activity of commercial thorium nitrate of&nbsp;different ages, Hahn showed that another product must be&nbsp;present, which he called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">mesothorium.</span><span class="font0"> This is separated from&nbsp;thorium with Th X by precipitation with ammonia. Thorium&nbsp;is first transformed into the rayless product mesothorium, of&nbsp;period about 5 years. This gives rise to a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ß</span><span class="font0"> ray product of&nbsp;quick transformation, which in turn changes into </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">radiothorium.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">This changes into thorium X, and so on through a long series&nbsp;of changes. When isolated in the pure state, radiothorium&nbsp;would have an activity about a thousand times greater than&nbsp;radium, but would lose its activity with time with a period of&nbsp;about 2 years. Mesothorium, when first separated, would be&nbsp;inactive, but in consequence of the production of radiothorium,&nbsp;its activity would rapidly increase for several years. After&nbsp;reaching a maximum, it would finally decay with a period&nbsp;of five years. Since a large amount of thorium is separated&nbsp;annually from thorium minerals, it would be of great importance&nbsp;at the same time to separate the radiothorium and mesothorium&nbsp;present. For many purposes active preparations of these&nbsp;substances would be as valuable as radium itself, and the&nbsp;amount of active matter from this source would be greater&nbsp;than that at present available from the separation of radium from&nbsp;uranium minerals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Actinium. —</span><span class="font0">The transformations observed in actinium are very analogous to those in thorium. Actinium itself is a rayless&nbsp;product which changes into radioactinium, an α ray product&nbsp;of period 19‧5 days, first separated by Hahn (32). This changes&nbsp;into actinium X, of period 10∙2 days, first separated by Godlewski&nbsp;(33). Actinium X is transformed into the emanation which in&nbsp;turn gives rise to three further products, called actinium A, B&nbsp;and C. Although very active preparations of actinium have&nbsp;been prepared, it has so far not been found possible to separate&nbsp;the actinium from the rare earths with which it is mixed. We&nbsp;do not in consequence know its atomic weight or spectrum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Origin of Radium. </span><span class="font0">—According to the transformation theory, radium, like all other radioactive products, must be regarded&nbsp;as a changing element. Preliminary calculations showed that&nbsp;radium must have a period of transformation of several thousand&nbsp;years. Consequently in order that any radium could exist in&nbsp;old minerals, the supply must be kept up by the transformation&nbsp;of some other substance. Since radium is always found asso-ciated with uranium minerals, it seemed probable from the&nbsp;beginning that uranium must be the primary element from&nbsp;which radium is derived. If this were the case, in old minerals&nbsp;which have not been altered by the action of percolating waters,&nbsp;the ratio of the amount of radium to uranium in a mineral&nbsp;must be a constant. This must evidently be the case, for in a&nbsp;state of equilibrium the rate of breaking up of radium must&nbsp;equal the rate of supply of radium from uranium. If P, Q be&nbsp;the number of atoms of uranium and radium respectively in&nbsp;equilibrium, and λ<sub>l</sub>, λ<sub>2</sub> their constants of change, then</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">λ2Q=λ<sub>l</sub>P or Q/P =λ<sub>1</sub>∕λ<sub>2</sub>=T<sub>2</sub>∕T<sub>1</sub>.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">where T<sub>2</sub> and T<sub>1</sub> are the half-periods of transformation of uranium and radium respectively. The work of Boltwood (34), Strutt (35)&nbsp;and McCoy (36) has conclusively shown that the ratio of radium&nbsp;to uranium in old minerals is a constant. Boltwood and Strutt&nbsp;determined the quantity of radium present in a mineral by the&nbsp;emanation method, and the amount of uranium by analysis.</span></p>
