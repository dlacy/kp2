The names <hi rend="italic">Glyphotes</hi>  and</p><p><hi rend="italic">Sciurotamias</hi>  have been proposed respectively for one Bornean and some four Chinese squirrels. With <hi rend="italic">Tamias</hi>  (sometimes split into <hi rend="italic">Tamias</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">Eutamias)</hi>  we reach the North American striped ground-squirrels, or chipmunks, well characterized by the large internal cheek-pouches, with one outlying species in Northern Asia and Europe (see Ground-Squirrel). These lead on to the sousliks, <hi rend="italic">Spermophilus</hi>  (or <hi rend="italic">Citellus),</hi>  in which the incisors (as in the following genera) differ from.those of all the squirrels in not being compressed. The genus which is common to the northern parts of both hemispheres is distinguished by the large cheek-pouches and by the absence or rudimentary condition of the claw of the first hind-toe, resembles <hi rend="italic">Tamias</hi>  in the slender form of the body, but displays great variation in the length of the tail, which may be a mere stump, or comparatively long. As in the following genera, there are two pairs of premolars, of which the first in this case is small and rounded, while the two series of cheek-teeth are nearly parallel (see Souslik). The prairie-dogs, or prairie-marmots, <hi rend="italic">Cynomys<hi rend="sub">1 </hi></hi>are a North American group, in which the five-toed forefeet have the claw of the first as large as that of the fifth toe. The skull is heavily built, with the post-orbital processes directed outwards. Dentition (fig. 6) remarkably heavy, the molar teeth differing from those of <hi rend="italic">Sperrnophilus</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">Arctomys</hi>  by having three instead of two transverse grooves on their crowns. First premolar nearly as large as the second. Molar series strongly convergent behind (see Prairie-Marmot). Finally, we have the marmots <hi rend="italic">(Arctomys)<hi rend="sub">1 </hi></hi>which are larger and more heavily built rodents, with short ears, more or less short tails and rudimentary or no cheek-pouches. Fore-feet with the first toe rudimentary and bearing a fiat nail. Skull (fig. 4) large and heavy, with the post-orbital process stouter and at right angles to the axis. Incisors broad and powerful. First upper premolar nearly as large as the second. Molar series nearly parallel, scarcely converging behind at all.</p><p>The genus is common to the northern half of both hemispheres, and its members, like those of the two preceding groups, burrow and hibernate (see Marmot).</p><p>The Nannosciurinae, or second sub-family of Sciuridae, are represented only by the pigmy squirrels <hi rend="italic">(Nannosciurus)<hi rend="sub">1</hi></hi>  characterized by their very short-crowned molars (which approximate to those of dormice in structure) and small premolars, of which the first upper pair is often deciduous, while the upper molars have only three oblique ridges. The front root of the zygomatic arch is nearly vertical, and placed so far back that it is above the second molar, while the orbit—a unique feature among rodents—is almost completely surrounded by bone. The few representatives of this group are all very small rodents, confined to tropical Africa, the Philippines and the Malay islands.</p><p>The third and last sub-family, the Pteromyinae, is distinguished from the other two by the presence of a parachute-like fold of skin along the sides of the body, the supporting cartilage of which arises from the carpus or wrist. It includes <hi rend="italic">ScUiropterus<hi rend="sub">1</hi></hi>  represented by small species from the northern parts of both hemispheres; <hi rend="italic">Pteromys<hi rend="sub">1</hi></hi>  comprising large flying-squirrels, ranging from India and the Malay countries to Japan, characterized by the long cylindrical tail and large inter-femoral membrane; and <hi rend="italic">Eupetaurus<hi rend="sub">1 </hi></hi>represented, by one very large dark grey, long-tailed and longhaired species from Astor and Gilgit, which differs from all other members of the family by its tall-crowned cheek-teeth (see Flying-Squirrel).</p><p><hi rend="italic">Beavers.—</hi>The second section, Castoroidea, of the present group includes only the family Castoridac, represented by the beavers, which are large aquatic rodents characterized by their massive skulls, devoid of post-orbital processes, with the angle of the lower jaw rounded, the molars rootless or semi-rooted, with re-entering enamel-folds, and one pair of premolars above and below. The tibia and fibula are united inferiorly, the tympanic bulla is hollow and the infra-orbital foramen narrow. The single existing genus comprises the European beaver, <hi rend="italic">Castor fiber,</hi>  of Europe and Northern Asia, and the North American C. <hi rend="italic">canadensis.</hi>  The upper molars are subequal, each with one internal and two external enamel-folds; the stomach has a large glandular mass situated to the right of the oesophageal orifice; the anal and urino-genital orifices open within a common cloaca; the tail is broad, horizontally flattened and naked; and the hind-feet are webbed (see Beaver).</p><p><hi rend="italic">Pouched Rats.</hi>—The American pouched rats, or pocket-gophers, constitute the third section, Geomyoidea, with the single family Geomyidae. The dentition includes one pair of premolars above and below, and rooted or rootless molars with but few enamel-folds. ln the skull the infra-orbital foramen is narrow’, and postorbital processes and an alisphenoid canal are absent. The tibia are fibula are united. The cheeks are provided with large pouches opening externally. Two sub-families are recognized. The first of these, or Geomyinae, is characterized as follows: Incisors broad; mastoid not appearing on the top of the skull; eyes small; ears rudimentary; limbs short, subequal. Habits fossorial. <hi rend="italic">Geomys bursarius,</hi>  the “ red pocket-gopher.” of North America, with deeply grooved incisors, inhabits the plains of the Mississippi, living in burrows like the mole. Several other species from the Southern States, Mexico and Central America are recognized. <hi rend="italic">Thomomys talpoides,</hi>  with plain incisors, extending from Canada to the United States west of the Rocky Mountains, typifies the second genus, which has also many species. The following are the characters of the second sub-family, Heteromyinae: Incisors narrow; mastoid appearing largely on the top of the skull; eyes and ears moderate or large; hind-limbs and tail elongated. Habits terrestrial. <hi rend="italic">Dipodomys<hi rend="sub">1</hi></hi>  which has the molars rootless, is typified by <hi rend="italic">D. Phillipi<hi rend="sub">1 </hi></hi>the kangaroo-rat of the desert regions east of the Rocky Mountains, <hi rend="italic">Perodipus</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">Microdipodops</hi>  being allied genera. <hi rend="italic">Perognathus </hi>and <hi rend="italic">Heteromys</hi>  have rooted molars; the latter genus is distinguished by the presence of flattened spines among the fur, and has species extending into South America. (See Pocket-Gopher, Pocket-Mouse and Kangaroo-Rat.)</p><p><hi rend="italic">Scalydailed Squirrels.—</hi>The next section, according to Prof. Max Weberis arrangement, is that of the Anomaluroidea, typified by the rodents commonly called African flying-squirrels (Anoma-Iuridae), but better designated scale-tailed squirrels, or simply “ scaly-tails,” since one member of the family has no parachute. To this group Prof. H. Winge affiliates the African jumping-hares. (Pedetidae), a view which is adopted by Prof. Weber, although Mr O. Thomas places these rodents in the neighbourhood of the porcupines. In the more extended sense, the Anomaluroidea are diagnosed as follows: In the skull the infra-orbital foramen (or canal) is large, the lachrymal foramen placed high up, and no transverse canal; while the malleus and incus of the internal ear are fused. In the carpus the scaphoid and lunar bones are united. There is a single pair of premolars in each jaw.</p><p>The Anomaluridae are characterized by having rooted cheek-teeth with shallow transverse enamel-folds, the two halves of the lower jaw movably articulated in front, very small post-orbital processes to the skull, and the presence of two rows of scales on the under surface of the base of the tail (figs. 7 and 8), which is cylindrical and thickly haired. The family is confined to the equatorial forest-tract of Africa, where it is most numerously represented on the west side. The majority of the species belong to the typical genus <hi rend="italic">Anomalurus</hi>  (fig. .7), which is provided with a parachute supported by a cartilaginous process arising from the olecranon of the ulna, and has well-developed ears and a moderately long tail. Several of the species are considerably larger than an ordinary squirrel. <hi rend="italic">Idiurus<hi rend="sub">1</hi></hi>  as represented by the West African <hi rend="italic">I. zenkeri </hi>(figured in the article Flying-Squirrel), is a mouse-like form, with very small ears and an extremely long tail. The third genus, <hi rend="italic">Zenkerella (Aethurus)<hi rend="sub">1</hi></hi>  which is also West African, has no parachute (fig. 8).</p><p><hi rend="italic">Jumping-Hares.</hi>—The grounds for referring the African jumping-hares (Pcdetidae) to the Anomaluroidca rest largely on the evidence of certain Tertiary rodents from Europe, such as <hi rend="italic">Issiodoromys. </hi>The family is represented by the South African <hi rend="italic">Pedetes cajfer, </hi>which is as large as a hare, and the smaller East African <hi rend="italic">P. surdaster. </hi>ln general habits and appearance these animals recall large jerboas, from which group they are, however, distinguished by the four pairs of rooted cheek-teeth, the premolars being as large as the molars, and the latter having one outer and one inner enamel-fold. The hind-limbs are elongated, with four toes, of which the metatarsals are separate; the tibia and fibula are welded in old age; the calcanéum and astragalus, of the tarsus are elongated; and there is a perforation on the inner side of the lower end of the humerus (see Jumping-Hare).</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
