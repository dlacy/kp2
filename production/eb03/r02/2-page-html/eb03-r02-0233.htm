<p><span class="font1">Conſtantine and Licinius thus remaining undiſputed poſſeſſors and partners in the empire, all things promiſed a peaceable continuance of friendſhip and power.&nbsp;However, it was ſoon found, that the fame ambition&nbsp;that aimed after a part, would be content with nothing&nbsp;leſs than the whole. Ragan writers aſeribe the ruptuιe&nbsp;between theſe two potentates to Conſtantine ; while&nbsp;the Chriſtians, on the other hand, impute it wholly to&nbsp;Licinius. Both, perhaps, might have concurred : lor&nbsp;Licinius is convicted of having perſecuted Chriſtianity,&nbsp;which was ſo highly favoured by his rival ; and Conſtantine is known to have been the firſt to begin the&nbsp;preparations far an open rupture. Both ſides exerted&nbsp;all their power to make oppoſition ; and at the head&nbsp;of very formidable armies, came to an engagement&nbsp;near Cybalis, in Pannonia. Conſtantine, previous to&nbsp;the battle, in the midſt of his Chriſtian biſhops, begged the aſſiſtance of Heaven ; while Licinius, with&nbsp;equal zeal, called upon the pagan prieſts, to intercede&nbsp;with the gods in his favour. Conſtantine, after an obſtinate reſiſtance from the enemy, became victorious ;&nbsp;took their camp ; and, after ſome time, compelled Licinius to ſue ſor a truce, which was agreed upon. But&nbsp;this was of no long continuance; ſor loon after, the war&nbsp;breaking out afreſh, and the rivals coming once more&nbsp;to a general engagement, it proved deciſive. Licinius&nbsp;was entirely defeated, and purſued by Conſtantine into&nbsp;Nicomedia, where he ſurrendered himſelf up to the victor ; having firſt obtained an oath that his life ſhould&nbsp;be ſpared, and that he ſhould be permitted to paſs the&nbsp;remainder of his days in retirement. This, however,&nbsp;Conſtantine ſhortly after broke ; ſor either fearing his&nbsp;deſigns, or finding him actually engaged in freſh conſpiracies, he commanded him to be put to death, together with Martian his general, who ſome time before had been created Cæ</span><span class="font0">ſ</span><span class="font1">ar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Conſtantine being now ſole monarch of the empire, without a rival to divide his power, or any perſon ſrom&nbsp;whoſe claims he could have the leaſt apprehenſions, reſolved to eſtabliſh Chriſtianity on ſo ſure a baſis, that&nbsp;no new regulations ſhould ſhake it. He commanded&nbsp;that in all the provinces of the empire the orders of the&nbsp;biſhops ſhould be exactly obeyed ; a privilege of which,&nbsp;in ſucceeding times, theſe fathers made but a very indifferent uſe. He called alſo a general council of theſe,&nbsp;to meet at Nicea, in order to repre</span><span class="font0">ſs</span><span class="font1"> the hereſies that had&nbsp;already crept into the church, particularly that of Arius.&nbsp;To this place repaired about 3 (8 biſhops, beſides a multitude of preſhyters and deacons, together with the emperor himſelf ; who all, to about 17, concurred in condemning the tenets of Arius ; who, with his a</span><span class="font0">ſſ</span><span class="font1">ociates,&nbsp;was baniſhed into a remote part of the empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Having thus reſtored univerſal tranquillity to. the empire, he was not able to ward off the calamities of a more domeſtic nature. As the hiſtories of that period&nbsp;are entirely at variance with each other, it is not ea</span><span class="font0">ſ</span><span class="font1">y&nbsp;to. tell the motives which induced him to put his wife&nbsp;Fauſta and his ſon Cri</span><span class="font0">ſ</span><span class="font1">pus to death. The moſt plauſible account is this : Fauſta the empreſs, who was a&nbsp;woman of great beauty, but of extravagant deſires, had&nbsp;long, though ſecretly, loved Cri</span><span class="font0">ſ</span><span class="font1">pus, Conſtantine’s ſon&nbsp;by a former wiſe. She had tried every art to inſpire&nbsp;this youth with a mutual paſſion; but, finding her more&nbsp;diſtant efforts ineffectual, had even the conſidence to&nbsp;make him an open conſeſſion of her deſires. This pro</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">duced an explanation, which was fatal to both. </span><span class="font2">Crif-</span><span class="font1">pus received her addreſſes with deteſtation ; and ſhe, to be revenged, accuſed him to the emperor. Conſtantine,&nbsp;fired at once with jealoufy and rage, ordered him to die&nbsp;without a hearing ; nor did his innocence appear till it&nbsp;was too late for redreſs. The only reparation therefore that remained, was the putting Fauſta, the wicked&nbsp;inſtrument of his former cruelty, to death ; which was&nbsp;accordingly executed upon her, together with ſome&nbsp;others who had been accomplices in her falſehood and&nbsp;treachery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But the private misfortunes of a few were not to be weighed againſt evils of a more general nature, which&nbsp;the Roman empire ſhortly after experienced. Theſe&nbsp;aroſe from a meaſure which this emperor conceived and&nbsp;executed, of transferring the ſeat of the empire from&nbsp;Rome to Byzantium, or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Con</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ſt</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">antinople,</span><span class="font1"> as it was afterwards called. Whatever might have been the reaſons which induced him to this undertaking ; whether&nbsp;it was becauſe he was offended at ſome affronts he received at Rome, or that he ſuppoſed Conſtantinople&nbsp;more in the centre of the empire, or that he thought&nbsp;the eaſtern parts more required his preſence, experience has ſhown that they were weak and groundleſs.&nbsp;The empire had long before been in the moſt declining&nbsp;ſtate ; but this in a great meaſure gave precipitation to&nbsp;its downfall. After this it never reſumed its former&nbsp;ſplendor, but languiſhed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">His firſt deſign was to build a city which he might make the capital of the world ; and for this purpoſes&nbsp;he made choice of a ſituation at Chalcedon in Aſia Minor ; but we are told, that in laying out the ground-plan, an eagle caught up the line and flew with it over&nbsp;to Byzantium, a city which lay upon the oppoſite ſide&nbsp;of the Boſphorus. Here, therefore, it was thought expedient to ſix the ſeat of the empire and indeed nature ſeems to have formed it with all the conveniences&nbsp;and all the beauties rvhich might induce power to&nbsp;make&lt;it the ſeat of reſidence. It was ſituated on a plain&nbsp;that roſe gently from the water ; it commanded that&nbsp;ſtrait which unites the Mediterranean with the Euxine&nbsp;ſea, and was furniſhed with all the advantages which&nbsp;the moſt indulgent climate could beſtow. This city,,&nbsp;therefore, he beautified with the moſt magniſicent edifices ;. he divided it into 14 regions ; built a capitol,&nbsp;an amphitheatre, many churches, and other public&nbsp;works ; and having thus rendered it equal to the magnificence of his idea, he dedicated it in a very ſolemn&nbsp;manner to the God of martyrs ; in about two years after, repairing thither with his.whole court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This removal produced no immediate alteration in the government of the empire ; the inhabitants of&nbsp;Rome, tho’ with reluctance, ſubmitted to the change ;&nbsp;nor was there for two or three years any diſturbance&nbsp;in the ſtate, until at length the Goths, finding that&nbsp;the Romans had withdrawn all their garriſons along the&nbsp;Danube, renewed their inroads, and. ravaged the country with unheard-of cruelty. Conſtantine, however,,&nbsp;ſoon repreſſed their incurſions,- and ſo ſtraitened them,&nbsp;that near 100,000 of their number periſhed by cold&nbsp;and hunger. Theſe and ſome other inſurrections being happily ſuppreſſed, the government of the empire&nbsp;was divided as follows. Conſtantine, the emperor’s,&nbsp;eldeſt ſon, commanded in Gaul and the weſtern provinces ; Conſtantius governed Africa and Illyricum ; and</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
