<p><label>RIGHTEOUSNESS</label>
means juſtice, honeſty, virtue, goodneſs, and amongſt Chriſtiahs is of exactly the ſame import w-ith holineſs, without which, we are told, no man ſhall ſee the Lord. The doctrine of the fall, and of redemption through Jeſus Chriſt, has occaſioned much deputation, and given riſe to many ſingular notions in the world. The haughty philoſopher, diſſatis-fied with myſteries, and with the humiliating doctrine of atonement by a crucified Saviour, has made a religion for himſelf, which ſhe calls <hi rend="italic">rational Chriſtiaηity ;</hi> and the enthuſiaſt, by extracting doctrines ſrom Scripture which are not contained in it, and which are repugnant to its ſpirit, has given too much counténance to this preſumption. The doctrine of imputed righte-ouſneſs, by which the merit of Chriſt is ſaid to be imputed to us, appears to be of this number ; and though it has been held by many good, and by ſome learned men, it is certainly in general unfriendly to virtue, as will be readily allowed by all who have converſed with the more ignorant ſort of Methodiſts in England Or Se-</p><p>ceders in Scotland. That ſt does not follow ſrom the doctrine of the atonement, and conſequently that it has no foundation in Scripture, will appear elſewhere. See Theology.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Bill cſ Rights,</hi> in law’, is a declaration delivered by the lords and commons to the prince and princeſs of Orange, 13 th February 1688 ; and afterwards enacted in parliament, when they became king and queen. It ſets forth, that king James did, by the aſſiſtance of divers evil counſellors, endeavour to ſubvert the laws and liberties of this kingdom, by exerciſing a power of dif∙ penſing with and ſuſpending of laws ; by levying money ſor the uſe of the crown by pretence of prerogative without conſent of parliament ; by proſecuting thoſe who petitioned the king, and diſcouraging petitions by railing and keeping a ftanding army in time of peace ; by violatingſtlie freedom of election of members» to ſerve in parliament ; by violent proſecutions in the court of king’s bench ; and cauſing partial and corrupt jurors to be returned on trials, exceſſive bail to be taken, exceſſive fines to be impoſed, and cruel puniſh-rnents inflicted ; all which were declared to be illegal. And the declaration concludes in theſe remarkable words : “ And they do claim, demand,' and in-ſiſt upon, all and ſingular the premiſes, as their undoubted rights and liberties.” And the act of parliament itſelf (1 W. &amp; M. ſtat. 2. cap. 2.) recognizes “ all and ſingular the rights and liberties, afferted and claimed in the ſaid declaration, to be the true, ancient, indubitable rights of the people of this kingdom.” See LIBERTY.</p>
