<p><span class="font3">Wedderburn’s sister Janet by her marriage with Sir Henry Erskine (d. 1765), a Scottish baronet and soldier. Entering the&nbsp;army in 1776, James Erskine served in Portugal, in Denmark and&nbsp;in the Netherlands, and became a general in 1814. From 1782&nbsp;until 1805, when he became a peer, he was a member of parliament; a Tory politician and an associate of the duke of Wellington, he was lord privy seal in 1829-30 and lord president of&nbsp;the council in 1834-35. He inherited the estates of the family&nbsp;of St Clair and took this name in 1789, and he died on the&nbsp;18th of January 1837. His son, James Alexander (1802-1866),&nbsp;became 3rd earl, and in 1890 the latter’s grandson, James&nbsp;Francis Harry (b. 1869), became 5th earl,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ROSSLYN, ALEXANDER WEDDERBURN, </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ist Earl of </span><span class="font3">C<sup>1</sup>733~i805), Lord Chancellor of Great Britain, was the eldest son&nbsp;of Peter Wedderburn (a lord of session as Lord Chesterhall), and&nbsp;was born in East Lothian on the 13th of February 1733. He&nbsp;acquired the rudiments of his education at Dalkeith, and in&nbsp;his fourteenth year matriculated at the university of Edinburgh.&nbsp;It was from the first his desire to practise at the English bar,&nbsp;though in deference to his father’s wishes he qualified as an&nbsp;advocate at Edinburgh, in 1754, but entered himself at the&nbsp;Inner Temple on the 8th of May 1753, so that he might keep&nbsp;the Easter and Trinity terms in that year. His father was&nbsp;called to the bench in 1755, and for the next three years Wedderburn stuck to his practice in Edinburgh, during which period&nbsp;he employed his oratorical powers in the General Assembly of&nbsp;the Church of Scotland, and passed his evenings in the social&nbsp;and argumentative clubs which abound in Edinburgh. In 1755&nbsp;the precursor of the later </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Edinburgh Review</span><span class="font3"> was started, now&nbsp;chiefly remembered because in its pages Adam Smith criticized&nbsp;the dictionary of Dr Johnson, and because the contents of its&nbsp;two numbers were edited by Wedderburn. The dean of facility&nbsp;at this time, Lockhart, afterwards Lord Covington, a lawyer&nbsp;notorious for his harsh demeanour, in the autumn of 1757&nbsp;assailed Wedderburn with more than ordinary insolence. His&nbsp;victim retorted with extraordinary powers of invective, and&nbsp;on being rebuked by the bench declined to retract or apologize,&nbsp;but placed his gown upon the table, and with a low bow left&nbsp;the court for ever. He was called to the English bar at the&nbsp;Inner Temple in 1757. To shake off his native accent and to&nbsp;acquire the graces of oratorical action, he engaged the services&nbsp;of Thomas Sheridan and Charles Macklin. To secure business&nbsp;and to conduct his cases with adequate knowledge, he studied&nbsp;the forms of English law, he solicited William Strahan, the&nbsp;printer, “ to get him employed in city causes,” and he entered&nbsp;into social intercourse (as is noted in Alexander Carlyle’s&nbsp;autobiography) with busy London solicitors. His local connexions and the incidents of his previous career introduced him to&nbsp;the notice of his countrymen Lords Bute and Mansfield. When&nbsp;Lord Bute was prime minister this legal satellite used, says Dr&nbsp;Johnson, to go on errands for him, and it is to Wedderburn’s&nbsp;credit that he first suggested to the premier the propriety of&nbsp;granting Johnson a pension. Through the favour of Lord Bute,&nbsp;he was returned to parliament for the Ayr burghs in 1761. In&nbsp;1763 he became king’s counsel and bencher of Lincoln’s Inn,&nbsp;and for a short time went the northern circuits, but was more&nbsp;successful in obtaining business in the Court of Chancery. He&nbsp;obtained a considerable addition to his resources (Carlyle puts&nbsp;the amount at £10,000) on his marriage in 1767 to Betty Anne,&nbsp;sole child and heiress of John Dawson of Marly in Yorkshire.&nbsp;When George Grenville, whose principles leaned to Toryism,&nbsp;quarrelled with the court, Wedderburn affected to regard him&nbsp;as his leader in politics. At the dissolution in the spring of&nbsp;1768 he was returned by Sir Lawrence Dundas for Richmond as&nbsp;a Tory, but in the questions that arose over John Wilkes </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">{q.v.}&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">he took the popular side of “ Wilkes and liberty,” and resigned&nbsp;his seat in May 1769. In the opinion of the people he was now&nbsp;regarded as the embodiment of all legal virtue; his health&nbsp;was toasted at the dinners of the Whigs amid rounds of applause,&nbsp;and, in recompense for the loss of his seat in parliament, he was&nbsp;returned by Lord Clive for his pocket-borough of Bishop’s&nbsp;Castle, in Shropshire, in January 1770. During the next session&nbsp;he acted vigorously in opposition, but his conduct was always&nbsp;viewed with distrust by his new associates, and his attacks&nbsp;on the ministry of Lord North grew less and less animated&nbsp;in proportion to its apparent fixity of tenure. In January 1771&nbsp;he was offered and accepted the post of solicitor-general. The&nbsp;high road to the woolsack was now open, but his defection from&nbsp;his former path has stamped his character with general infamy.&nbsp;Junius wrote of him, “ As for Mr Wedderburn, there is something about him which even treachery cannot trust,” and Colonel&nbsp;Barré attacked him in the House of Commons. The new law&nbsp;officer defended his conduct with the assertion that his alliance&nbsp;in politics had been with Mr George Grenville, and that the&nbsp;connexion had been severed on his death. All through the&nbsp;American War he consistently declaimed against the colonies,&nbsp;and he was bitter in his attack on Benjamin Franklin </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.)&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">before the Privy Council. In June 1778 Wedderburn was&nbsp;promoted to the post of attorney-general, and in the same year&nbsp;he refused the dignity of chief baron of the exchequer because&nbsp;the offer was not accompanied by the promise of a peerage.&nbsp;At the dissolution in 1774 he had been returned for Okehampton&nbsp;in Devonshire, and for Castle Rising in Norfolk, and selected&nbsp;the former constituency; on his promotion as leading law officer&nbsp;of the crown he returned to Bishop’s Castle. The coveted&nbsp;peerage was not long delayed. In June 1780 he was created&nbsp;chief justice of the Court of Common Pleas, with the title of&nbsp;Baron Loughborough.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the existence of the coalition ministry of North and Fox, the great seal was in commission (April to December 1783),&nbsp;and Lord Loughborough held the leading, place among the&nbsp;commissioners. For some time after that ministry’s fall he&nbsp;was considered the leader of the Whig party in the House of&nbsp;Lords, and, had the illness of the king brought about the return&nbsp;of the Whigs to power, the great seal would have been placed&nbsp;in his hands. The king’s restoration to health secured Pitt’s&nbsp;continuance in office, and disappointed the expectations of&nbsp;the Whigs. In 1792, during the period of the French Revolution, Lord Loughborough seceded from Fox, and on the 28th&nbsp;of January 1793 he received the great seal in the Tory cabinet&nbsp;of Pitt. The resignation of Pitt on the question of Catholic&nbsp;emancipation (1801) put an end to Wedderbum’s tenure of the&nbsp;Lord Chancellorship, for, much to his surprise, no place was&nbsp;found for him in Addington’s cabinet. His first wife died in&nbsp;1781 without leaving issue, and he married in the following&nbsp;year Charlotte, youngest daughter of William, Viscount&nbsp;Courtenay; but her only son died in childhood. Lord Loughborough accordingly obtained in 1795 <sup>a</sup> re-grant of his barony&nbsp;with remainder to his nephew, Sir James St Clair Erskine.&nbsp;His fall in 1801 was softened by the grant of an earldom (he&nbsp;was created earl of Rosslyn 21st April 1801, with remainder&nbsp;to his nephew), and by a pension of £4000 per annum. After&nbsp;this date he rarely appeared in public, but he was a constant&nbsp;figure at all the royal festivities. He attended one of those&nbsp;gatherings at Frogmore, on the 31st of December 1804. On the&nbsp;following day he was seized with an attack of gout in the stomach,&nbsp;and on the 2nd of January 1805 he died at his seat, Baylis,&nbsp;near Salt Hill, Windsor. His remains were buried in St Paul’s&nbsp;Cathedral on the nth of January.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At the bar Wedderburn was the most elegant speaker of his time, and, although his knowledge of the principles and precedents </span><span class="font2">of&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">law was deficient, his skill in marshalling facts and his clearness of&nbsp;diction were marvellous; on the bench his judgments were remarkable for their perspicuity, particularly Jn the appeal cases to the&nbsp;House of Loras. For cool and sustained declamation he stood&nbsp;unrivalled in parliament, and his readiness in debate was universally&nbsp;acknowledged. In social life, in the company of the wits and writers&nbsp;of his day, his faculties seemed to desert him. He was not only&nbsp;dull, but the cause of dulness m others, and even Alexander Carlyle&nbsp;confesses that in conversation his illustrious countryman was ” stiff&nbsp;and pompous.” In Wedderburn’s character ambition banished all&nbsp;rectitude of principle, but the love of money for money’s sake was not&nbsp;among his faults.</span></p>
