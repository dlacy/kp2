<p><span class="font1">Among the more noteworthy incidents in the story of the Hôtel are the sonnet war between the Uranistes and the Jobistes—&nbsp;partisans of two famous sonnets by Voiture and Benserage—and&nbsp;the composition by all the famous poets of the day of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Guirlande de Julie,</span><span class="font1"> a collection of poems on different flowers,&nbsp;addressed in 1641 to Julie d’Angennes, afterwards duchesse de&nbsp;Montausier. Julie herself was responsible for a good deal of&nbsp;the preciosity for which the Hôtel was later ridiculed. Charles&nbsp;de Sainte Maure, who become in 1664 duc de Montausier, had&nbsp;been wooing her for seven years when he conceived the idea&nbsp;of the famous garland, and she kept him waiting for four years&nbsp;more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Précieuses,</span><span class="font1"> who are usually associated with Molière’s avowed caricatures and with the extravagances of Mlle. de&nbsp;Scudéry, but whose name, it must be remembered, Madame de&nbsp;Sévigné herself was proud to bear—insisted on a ceremonious&nbsp;gallantry from their suitors and friends, though it seems from&nbsp;the account given by Tallemant des Réaux that practical jokes&nbsp;of a mild kind were by no means excluded from the Hôtel de&nbsp;Rambouillet. They especially favoured an elaborate and&nbsp;quintessenced kind of colloquial and literary expression, imitated&nbsp;from Marini and Gongora, and then fashionable throughout&nbsp;Europe. The immortal </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Précieuses ridicules</span><span class="font1"> of Molière was no&nbsp;doubt directly levelled not at the Hôtel de Rambouillet itself,&nbsp;but at the numerous coteries which in the course of years had&nbsp;sprung up in imitation of it. But the satire did in truth touch&nbsp;the originators as well as the imitators,—the former more closely&nbsp;perhaps than they perceived. The Hôtel de Rambouillet&nbsp;continued open till the death of its mistress, on the 2nd of&nbsp;December 1665, but the troubles of the Fronde diminished its&nbsp;influence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The chief original authorities respecting Madame de Rambouillet and her set are Tallemant des Réaux in his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Historiettes,</span><span class="font0"> and Antoine&nbsp;Baudeau de Somaize in his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Grand Dictionnaire des Précieuses</span><span class="font0"> (1660).&nbsp;Many modern writers have treated the subject, notably Victor&nbsp;Cousin, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">La Société française au xvii<sup>e</sup> siècle</span><span class="font0"> (2 vols., 1856), and C. L.&nbsp;Livet, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Précieux et Précieuses . . .</span><span class="font0"> (1859). There is an admirable&nbsp;edition (1875) of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Guirlande de Julie</span><span class="font0"> by O. Uzanne.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RAMBOUILLET, a town </span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font1">northern France, capital of an arrondissement in the department of Seine-et-Oise, 30 m. S.W.&nbsp;of Paris on the railway to Chartres. Pop. (1906) town, 3965;&nbsp;commune, 6165. Rambouillet derives its whole interest from&nbsp;the associations connected with the ancient château, dating&nbsp;originally from the 14th century, but often rebuilt. A great&nbsp;machicolated tower is all that remains of the medieval building;&nbsp;some apartments with good woodwork are also of interest. The&nbsp;château is surrounded by a beautiful park of 3000 acres and by&nbsp;an extensive forest. The gardens, partly in French, partly in&nbsp;English style, are picturesque, and have an avenue of Louisiana&nbsp;cypress unique in Europe. The park contains the national&nbsp;sheep-farm, where in the 18th century the first flock of merino&nbsp;sheep in France was raised, a school of sheep-farming, and, close&nbsp;to the latter, a small dairy built by Louis XVI. The shooting&nbsp;of the famous coverts of Rambouillet is reserved for the presidents of the Republic. The town is the seat of a sub-prefect&nbsp;and has a tribunal of first instance and a preparatory infantry&nbsp;school· Trade is in grain, wool, flour and wood. Watch-springs are manufactured.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Originally a royal domain, the lands of Rambouillet passed in the 14th century to the D’Ángennes family, who held them for&nbsp;three hundred years and built the chateau. Francis I. died&nbsp;there in 1547; and Charles IX. and Catherine de Medicis found&nbsp;a refuge there in the Wars of Religion, as Henry III. did after&nbsp;them. The title became a marquisate in 1612, at which time&nbsp;it was held by Charles d’Angennes, husband of Catherine de&nbsp;Vivonne (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">q.υ.</span><span class="font1">)</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span class="font1"> the famous marchioness of Rambouillet. Created&nbsp;a duchy and peerage in favour of the duke of Toulouse, son&nbsp;of Louis XIV., Rambouillet was subsequently bought and&nbsp;embellished by Louis XVI., who erected a model farm and other&nbsp;buildings. The place was a hunting-seat of Napoleon I. and&nbsp;Charles X., and it was here that in 1830 the latter signed his&nbsp;abdication.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RAMEAU, JEAN PHILIPPE (1683-1764), French musical theorist and composer, was born at Dijon on the 23rd of&nbsp;October 1683. His musical education, partly in consequence of&nbsp;his father’s desire that he should study law, still more through&nbsp;his own wayward disposition, was of a desultory character. In&nbsp;1701 his father sent him to Milan to break off a foolish love-match. But he learned little in Italy, and soon returned, in&nbsp;company with a wandering theatrical manager, for whom he&nbsp;played the second violin. He next settled in Paris, where he&nbsp;published his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Premier livre de pièces de clavecin,</span><span class="font1"> in 1706. In&nbsp;1717 he made an attempt to obtain the appointment of organist&nbsp;at the church of St Paul. Deeply annoyed at his unexpected&nbsp;failure, he retired for a time to Lille, whence, however, he soon&nbsp;removed to Clermont-Ferrand. Here he succeeded his brother&nbsp;Claude as organist at the cathedral.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Burning with desire to remedy the imperfections of his early education, Rameau diligently studied the writings of Zarlino,&nbsp;Descartes, Mersenne, F. Kircher and other theorists. He not&nbsp;only mastered their views but succeeded in demonstrating their&nbsp;weak points and substituting for them a system of his own.&nbsp;His keen insight into the constitution of certain chords, which&nbsp;in early life he had studied only by ear, enabled him to propound&nbsp;a series of hypotheses, many of which are now accepted as&nbsp;established facts. While the older contrapuntists were per-fectly satisfied with the laws which regulated the melodious&nbsp;involutions of their vocal and instrumental parts, Rameau&nbsp;demonstrated the possibility of building up a natural harmony&nbsp;upon a fundamental bass, and of using that harmony as an&nbsp;authority for the enactment of whatever laws might be con-sidered necessary for the guidance either of the contrapuntist&nbsp;or the less ambitious general composer. And in this he first&nbsp;explained the distinction between two styles, which have been&nbsp;called the “ horizontal and vertical systems,” the “ horizontal&nbsp;system ” being that by which the older contrapuntists regulated&nbsp;the onward motion of their several parts, and the “ vertical&nbsp;system ” that which constructs an entire passage out of a single&nbsp;harmony. From fundamental harmonies he passed to inverted&nbsp;chords, to which he was the first to call attention; and the value&nbsp;of this discovery fully compensates for his erroneous theory&nbsp;concerning the chords of the eleventh and the great (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Angl.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">&quot; added ”) sixth (see Harmony).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rameau first set forth his new theory in his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Traite de l'harmonie </span><span class="font1">(Paris, 1722), and followed it up in his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Nouveau système</span><span class="font1"> (1726),&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Génération harmonique</span><span class="font1"> (1737), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Démonstration</span><span class="font1"> (1750) and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Nouvelles réflexions</span><span class="font1"> (1752). But it was not only as a theorist that&nbsp;he became famous. Returning to Paris in 1722 he first attracted&nbsp;attention by composing some fight dramatic pieces, and then&nbsp;showed his real powers in his opera, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hippolyte el Aricie,</span><span class="font1"> founded&nbsp;on Racine’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Phèdre</span><span class="font1"> and produced at the Académie in 1733.&nbsp;Though this work was violently opposed by the admirers of&nbsp;Lulli, whose party spirit eventually stirred up the famous&nbsp;“ guerre des bouffons,’’ Rameau’s genius was too brilliant to be&nbsp;trampled under foot by an ephemeral faction and his ultimate&nbsp;triumph was assured. He afterwards produced more than&nbsp;twenty operas, the most successful of which were </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dardanus,&nbsp;Castor el Pollux, Les Indes galantes</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">La princesse de Navarre. </span><span class="font1">Honours were showered upon him. He was appointed con-ductor at the Opéra Comique, and the directors of the opera&nbsp;granted him a pension. King Louis XV. appointed him composer to the court in 1745, and in 1764 honoured him with a&nbsp;patent of nobility and the order of St Michael. But these last&nbsp;privileges were granted only on the eve of his death at Paris on&nbsp;the 12th of September 1764.</span></p>
