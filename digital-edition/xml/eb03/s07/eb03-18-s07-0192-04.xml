in common law, a deed or inſtrument, teſtifying that the particular tenant of lands and tenements, for life or years, doth ſufficiently conſent and agree, that he who has the next or immediate remainder or reverſion thereof, ſhall have the preſent eſtate of the ſame in poſſeſſion ; and that he hereby yields and gives up the ſame to him, ſo that the eſtate for life or years may merge or drown by mutual agreement of the parties. Of ſurrenders there are three kinds ; a ſurrender properly taken at common law ; a ſurrender of copyhold or cuſtomary eſtates ; and a ſurrender improperly taken, as of a deed, a patent, &amp;c. The first is the uſual ſurrender, and it is uſually divided into that in deed, and that in law.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Surrender,</hi> in deed, is that which is really made by expreſs words in writing, where the words of the leſſee to the leſſor prove a ſufficient aſſent to ſurrender his eſtate back again.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Surrender,</hi> in law, is that wrought by operation of the law, and which is not actual.—As if a man have a lease of a farm for life or years, and during the term he accepts a new leaſe ; this act is, in law, a ſurrender of the former.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Surrender</hi> of a bankrupt. See <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Commission</hi> <hi rend="italic">of Bankruptcy.</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Surrender</hi> <hi rend="italic">of Copyholds</hi> is the yielding up of the eſtate by the tenant into the hands of the lord, for ſuch purpoſes as are expressed in the ſurrender : as to the uſe and behoof of A and his heirs, to the uſe of his own will, and the like. This method of conveyance is ſo eſſential to the nature of a copyhold eſtate, that it cannot poſſibly be transferred by any other aſſurance. No feoffment, fine, or recovery (in the king’s courts) hath any operation upon it. If 1 would exchange a copyhold with another, I cannot do it by an ordinary deed of exchange at the common law, but we muſt ſurrender to each other’s uſe, and the lord will admit us accordingly. If I would deviſe a copyhold, I muſt ſurrender it to the uſe of my laſt will and teſtament ; and in my will I muſt declare my intentions, and name a deviſee, who will then be entitled to admiſſion.</p><p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> surrender</hi> <hi rend="italic">of Letters Patent and Offices.</hi> A ſurrender may be made of letters patent to the king, ſo that he may grant the eſtate to whom he pleaſes, &amp;c. and a ſecond patent for years to the ſame perſon for the ſame thing is a ſurrender in law of the first patent. 10 Rep. 66. If an officer for life accepts of another grant of the ſame office, it is in law a ſurrender of the first grant ; but if ſuch an officer takes another grant of the ſame office to himſelf and another, it may be otherwiſe.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
