The Latins purſued them,&nbsp;and in the purſuit Lauſus was killed : whoſe death ſo&nbsp;diſcouraged Mezentius, that he immediately ſued for&nbsp;peace ; which was granted him, upon condition, that&nbsp;for the future the Tiber ſhould be the boundary between the Latin and Hetrurian territories.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the mean time Lavinia, who had been-leſt with child by Æneas, entertaining a ſtrong jealouſy of the&nbsp;&gt;ambition of her ſon-in-law, retired to the woods, and&nbsp;was there peaceably delivered of a fon, who, from his&nbsp;father, was named </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Æneas·,</span><span class="font1"> and, from the place of his&nbsp;•birth, had the ſurname of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sylvius :</span><span class="font1"> hut as the queen’s&nbsp;•flight, who had diſappeared on a ſudden, raiſed ſuſpi-cions at Lavinium prejudicial to the reputation of Aſe&nbsp;canius, he uſed all poſſible means to remove them, cauſed diligent ſearch to be made after Lavinia, calmed&nbsp;her fears, and prevailed upon her to return to trie town&nbsp;with her ſon, whom he ever after treated as a brother.&nbsp;Lavinium grew every day more populous ; but as it&nbsp;•was in reality the patrimony of Lavinia, and the inheritance of her ſon Sylvius, Aſcanius reſolved to refιgn&nbsp;it to them, and build elſewhere another city for himſelf. This he ∙made.the place of his reſidence, and the&nbsp;capital of his new kingdom, calling it </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Alba Longa ;&nbsp;Alba,</span><span class="font1"> from a white ſow, which we are told Æneas&nbsp;.had found in the place where it was built ; and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Longa, </span><span class="font1">to diſtinguiſh it from another town of the ſame name&nbsp;in the country of the Marſi ; or rather, becauſe it ex-<sub>l</sub> tended, without having much breadth, the whole length&nbsp;. of a lake near which it was built. It was 30 years after the building of Lavinium that Aſcauius fixed his&nbsp;: abode at Alba ; and there he died, after a reign of&nbsp;-.about 38 years, 12 of which he had reſided at his new&nbsp;ſettlement. He left a ſon called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lulus ;</span><span class="font1"> ſo that between&nbsp;him and Sylvius lay the right of ſucceſſion to the Latin throne; the latter being the ſon, and the former the&nbsp;grandſon, of Æneas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Ί he Latins not thinking it their intereſt to continue divided, as it were, into two ſtates, reſolved to unite&nbsp;Alba and Lavinium into one ſovereignty ; and as Sylvius was born of Lavinia the daughter of Latinus, and&nbsp;•had thereby an undoubted title to the kingdom of his&nbsp;grandfather, whereas the other was but the ſon of a&nbsp;ſtranger, the Latins beſtowed the crown on Sylvius ;&nbsp;and, to make lulus ſome amends, decreed to him the&nbsp;ſovereign power in affairs of religion j a power which&nbsp;thenceforth continued in his family. Sylvius was ſucceeded by 13 kings of the ſame race, who for near 400&nbsp;years reigned at Alba ; but we ſcarce know any thing&nbsp;of them beſides their names, and the years of their re-ſpective reigns. Æneas Sylvius died, after a reign of&nbsp;29 yeaιs. His ſon, called alſo </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Æneas Sylvius,</span><span class="font1"> governed Latium 31 years. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Latinus Sylvius,</span><span class="font1"> who ſucceeded&nbsp;him, ſwayed the ſceptre for the ſpace of 5 </span><span class="font0">t </span><span class="font1">years —&nbsp;Alba reigned 39 ; Capetus, by Livy named </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Atys, 26;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">Gapis, 28 ; and Capetus, 13. Tſherinus, who ſucceeded him, engaged in a war which proved fatal to&nbsp;him ; for in a battle which was ſought on the banks of&nbsp;the Albula, he was forced into that river and drowned.&nbsp;From him the river took the name of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tiber,</span><span class="font1"> which it&nbsp;has borne ever ſince. Agrippa ſucceeded Tiberimιs&nbsp;after a reign of eight years ; and left the throne, which</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">he had held 4 r years, to Alladius ; who retgned 19, and was ſucceeded by Aventinus, who leſt his name to the&nbsp;bill Aventinus, where he was interred. Procas, who&nbsp;ſucceeded him, and reigned 23 years, wa9 the father of&nbsp;Numitor and Amulius ; and at his death bequeathed&nbsp;the throne to his elder ſon Numitor. But Amulius,&nbsp;who ſurpaſſed his brother in courage and underſtanding,&nbsp;drove him from the throne ; and to ſecure it to himſelf,&nbsp;murdered Ægeftus, Numitor’s only ſon, and conſecrated his daughter Rhea Sylvia to the worſhip of&nbsp;Veſta, by which ſhe was obliged to perpetual virginity.&nbsp;But this precaution proved ineffectual ; for as the Veſ-tal was going to a neighbouring ſpring to fetch water&nbsp;for the performance of a ſacriſice to Mars, ſhe was met&nbsp;and raviſhed by a man in a military habit, like that iu&nbsp;which the god Mars is repreſented. Some authors&nbsp;think that this counterfeit Mars was a lover come thither by her appointment ; others charge Amulius him-ſelſ with uſing this violence to his niece, not ſo much to&nbsp;gratify his luit, as to have a pretence to deſtroy her.—&nbsp;For ever after he cauſed her to be carefully watched,&nbsp;till ſhe was delivered of two ſons ; and then exaggerating her crime in an aſſembly of the people, he prevailed&nbsp;upon them to fentenςe her to death, and to condemn&nbsp;the fruit of her criminal amour to be thrown into the&nbsp;Tiber. The ſentence againſt Rhea was, according to&nbsp;ſome authors, changed by Amulius, at the requeſt of&nbsp;his daughter Antho, into perpetual confinement, but&nbsp;executed againſt the twins ; who being laid in a wooden&nbsp;trough, and carried to the foot of mount Palatine, were&nbsp;there turned adrift on the Tiber, which at that time&nbsp;overflowed its banks. But the wind and ſtream proved&nbsp;both ſo favourable, that at the fall of the water the two&nbsp;infants were left ſafe on the ſtrand, and were there happily found by Fauſtulus, the chief of the king’s ſhepherds, and ſuckled by his wife Acca Laurentia, who&nbsp;for her diſorderly life was called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lupa ;</span><span class="font1"> and this probably gave rife to the fabulous miracle of their being&nbsp;nurſed by a wolf.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As Fauſtulus was probably well acquainted with the birth of the twins, he took more than ordinary care of&nbsp;their education, and ſent them to Gabii to be inſtructed&nbsp;there in Greek literature. As they grew up, they&nbsp;appeared to have ſomething great in their mien and air&nbsp;which commanded reſpect ; and the aſcendant which&nbsp;they aſſumed over the other ſhepherds made them dreaded in the ſoreſts, where they exerciſed a ſort of empire.&nbsp;A quarrel happening between the herdſmen of Amulius&nbsp;and thoſe of Numitor, the two brothers took the part&nbsp;of the former againſt the latter ; and ſome blood being&nbsp;ſhed in the fray, the adverſe party, to be revenged on&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Romulus</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Remus</span><span class="font1"> (for ſo the twins were called), on&nbsp;the feſtival of Lupercalia, ſurpriſed Remus, and carried&nbsp;him before Numitor, to be puniſhed according to his&nbsp;deſerts. But Numitor feeling himſelf touched in the&nbsp;priſoner’s favour, aſked him where he was born, and&nbsp;who were his parents. His anſwer immediately ſtruck&nbsp;Numitor with a lively remembrance of his two grand-ſons ; their age, which was about 1 8 years, agreed with&nbsp;the time when the two infants were expoſed upon the&nbsp;Tiber ; and there needed no more to change his anger&nbsp;into tenderneſs.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a><h4><span class="font2">In the mean time Romulus, eager to reſcue his brother, and purſue thoſe who had carried him off, was preparing to be revenged on them ; but Fauſtulus diſ-</span></h4></div><br clear="all"/>
