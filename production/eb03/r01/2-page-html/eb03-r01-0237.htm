<p><span class="font0">together, gradually expanding themſelves, having thick foot-ſtalks ; and grow from one to two feet high, or&nbsp;more, in length and breadth, ſpreading all round : 'amidſt&nbsp;them rife the flower-ſtems, which are garniſhed at each&nbsp;joint by one leaf, and are of ſtrong and expeditious&nbsp;.growth, attaining their full height in June, when they&nbsp;flower ; and are ſucceeded by large triangular ſeeds, ripening in Auguſt. Some plants of each fort merit cub&nbsp;ture in gardens for variety ; they will effect a ſingula-rity with their luxuriant foliage, ſpikes, and flowers :&nbsp;and as medical plants, they demand culture both for&nbsp;private and public uſe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">They are generally propagated by ſeeds ſowed ſu au-tumn ſoon after they are ripe, or early in the ſpring, in any open bed of light deep earth ; remarking, thoſe intended for medical ufe ſhould generally be ſowed where&nbsp;they are to remain, that the roots, being not diſturbed&nbsp;by removal, may grow large. Scatter the ſeeds thinly,&nbsp;either by broad-caſt all over the· ſurface, and raked&nbsp;well in ; or in ſhallow drills a foot and half diſtance,&nbsp;covering them near an inch deep. The plants will rife&nbsp;in the fpring, but not flower till the ſecond or third&nbsp;year : when they, however, are come up two or three&nbsp;inches high, thin them to eight or ten inches, and clear&nbsp;out all weeds ; though thoſe deſſgned always to ſtand&nbsp;ſhould afterwards be hoed out to a foot and a half or&nbsp;two ſeet diſtance : obſerving, if any arc required ſor the&nbsp;pleaſure ground, &amp;c. for variety, they ſhould be transplanted where they are to remain in autumn, when&nbsp;their leaves decay, or early in ſpring, before they ſhoot:&nbsp;the others remaining where ſowed, muſt have the ground&nbsp;kept clean between them ; and in autumn, when the&nbsp;leaves and ſtalks decay, cut them down, and ſſightly dig&nbsp;the ground between the rows of plants^ repeating the&nbsp;ſame work every year.. The roots remaining, they increaſe in ſize annually : and in the fécond or third veal-many of them will ſhoot up ſtalks, flower, and perfect&nbsp;ſeeds ; and in three or four years tile roots will be arrived to a large ſize ; though older roots are generally preferable for medical uſe. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In Mr Bell’s Travels we have an account of ſome curious particulars relating to the culture of rhubarb.&nbsp;He tells us, that the beſt rhubarb grows in that part&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font0">Eaſtern Tartary called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Mongalia,</span><span class="font0"> which now ſerves&nbsp;as a boundary between Ruffia and China. The marmots contribute greatly to the culture of the rhubarb,&nbsp;wherever you ſee io or 20 plants growing, you are&nbsp;ſure of finding ſeveral burrows under the ſhades of their&nbsp;broad-ſp reading leaves. Perhaps they may fometimes&nbsp;eat the leaves and roots of this plant ; however, it is&nbsp;probable the manure they leave about the roots contributes not a little to its increaſe ; and their caſting up&nbsp;the earth, makes it ſhoot out young buds and multiply. This plant does not run, and ſpread itſelf,&nbsp;like clocks and others of the ſame ſpecies ; but grows&nbsp;in tufts, at uncertain diſtances, as if the feeds had&nbsp;been dropped with defign. It appears that thc Mon-gals never accounted it worth cultivating ; but that&nbsp;the world is obliged to tlie marmots for the quantities ſcattered, at random, in many parts of this coun-try : for whatever part of tile ripe ſeed happens to be&nbsp;blown among the thick graſs, can very ſeldom reach&nbsp;the ground, but muſt there wither and die ; whereas,&nbsp;Should it ſall among the looſe earth thrown up by&nbsp;the marmots, it immediately takes root, and </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">produces&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">a new plant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">After digging and gathering the rhubarb, the Mon-gals cut the large roots into ſmall pieces, in order to make them dry more readily. In the middle of every&nbsp;piece they ſcoop a hole, through which a cord is drawn,&nbsp;in order to ſufpend them in any convenient place. They&nbsp;hang them for the moſt part about their tents, and&nbsp;fometimes on the horns of their ſheep. This is a moſt&nbsp;pernicious cuſtom, as it deſtroys ſome of the beſt part&nbsp;or the root : ſor all about the hole is rotten and uſeleſs;&nbsp;whereas, were people rightly informed how to dig and&nbsp;dry this plant, there would not be one pound of refuſe&nbsp;in an hundred ; which would ſave a great deal of trouble&nbsp;and expence, that much diminiſh the profits on this&nbsp;commodity.. At preſent, the dealers in this article&nbsp;think theſe improvements not worthy of their attention,&nbsp;as their gains are more conſiderable on this than on any&nbsp;other branch of trade. Perhaps the government may&nbsp;hereafter think it proper to make ſome regulations with&nbsp;regard to this matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Two forts of rhubarb are met with in the ſhops. ſſ he ſirſt is imported from Turkey and Ruffia, in&nbsp;roundiſh pieces freed from the bark,-with a hole through&nbsp;the middle of each ; they are externally of a yellowiſh&nbsp;colour, and on cutting appear variegated with lively&nbsp;reddiſh ſtreaks. 1 he other, which is leſs eſteemed,&nbsp;comes immediately from the Eaſt Indies, in longiſh&nbsp;pieces, harder, heavier, and more compact than the&nbsp;foregoing. The firſt ſort, unleſs kept very dry, is apt&nbsp;to grow mouldy and worm-eaten ; the ſecond is lefs&nbsp;ſubject· to theſe inconveniences. Some of the more&nbsp;mduſtrious artiſts are ſaid to fill up the worm-holes with&nbsp;certain mixtures, and to colour the outfide of the damaged pieces with powder of the finer ſorts of rhubarb, and ſometimes wlth cheaper materials : this is&nbsp;often ſo nicely done, as effectually to impoſe upon the&nbsp;buyer, unleſs he very carefully examines each piece.&nbsp;The marks of good rhubarb are, that it be firm and&nbsp;ſolid, but not flinty ; that it be eaſtly pulverable, and&nbsp;appear, when powdered, of a fine bright yellow colour j&nbsp;that, upon being chewed, it impart to the fpittle a&nbsp;ſaffron tinge, without proving ſiimy or mucilaginous&nbsp;m the mouth. Its taſte is ſubacrid, bitteriih, and fomewhat aſtringent ; the ſmell lightly aromatic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rhubarb is a mild cathartic, which operates without violence or irritation, and may be given with ſafety even to pregnant women and children. - .Beſides its purgative quality, it is celebrated for an aſtringent one,&nbsp;by which it ſtrengthens the tone of the ſtomach and&nbsp;mteſtines, and proves ufeful in diarrhoeas and diſorders&nbsp;proceeding from a laxity of the ſibres. Rhubarb in&nbsp;ſubſtance operates more powerfully as a cathartic than&nbsp;any of the preparations of it. watery tinctures purge&nbsp;more than the ſpirituous ones; whilſt the latter contain&nbsp;in greater perfection the aromatic, aſtringent, and corro-borating virtues of the rhubarb. The doſe, when intended as a purgative, is from a ſcruple to a dram or more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Turkey rhubarb is, among ns,, univerſally preferred to the Eaſt India fort, though this laſt is for lome purpoſes at leaſt equal to the others lt ls mani-ſeſtly more aſtringent, but has fomewhat Ieſs of an&nbsp;aromatic flavour. Tinctures drawn from both with.·&nbsp;rectified ſpirit have nearly the fame taſte ; on diſtilling</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
