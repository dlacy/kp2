<p><span class="font0">studying at Liverpool High School and University College, London, he went to Heidelberg to work under R. W. Bunsen, of&nbsp;whom he became a lifelong friend. In 1857 he was appointed&nbsp;to the chair of chemistry at Owens College, Manchester, where&nbsp;he remained for thirty years, and from 1885 to 1895 he was M.P.&nbsp;for the south division of Manchester. He served on several&nbsp;royal commissions appointed to consider educational questions,&nbsp;in which he was keenly interested, and from 1896 to 1902 was&nbsp;vice-chancellor of London University. He was knighted in&nbsp;1884. His scientific work includes a memorable scries of researches carried out with Bunsen between 1855 and 1862, in&nbsp;which they laid the foundations of comparative photochemistry.&nbsp;In 1867 he began an elaborate investigation of vanadium and&nbsp;its compounds, and devised a process for preparing it pure in&nbsp;the metallic state, at the same time showing that the substance&nbsp;which had previously passed for the metal was contaminated&nbsp;with oxygen and nitrogen. He was also the author of researches&nbsp;on niobium, tungsten, uranium, perchloric acid, the solubility&nbsp;of ammonia, &amp;c. His publications include, besides several&nbsp;elementary books on chemistry which have had a wide circulation and been translated into many foreign languages, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lectures&nbsp;on Spectrum Analysis</span><span class="font0"> (1869); a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Treatise on Chemistry</span><span class="font0"> (the first&nbsp;edition of which appeared in 1877-1892); </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">A New View of Dalton’s&nbsp;Atomic Theory,</span><span class="font0"> with Dr A. Harden (1896); and an </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Autobiography</span><span class="font0"> (1906). The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Treatise on Chemistry,</span><span class="font0"> written in collaboration with Carl Schorlemmer (1834-1892), who was appointed&nbsp;his private assistant at Manchester in 1859, official assistant in&nbsp;the laboratory in 1861, and professor of organic chemistry in&nbsp;1874, is a standard work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROSCOE, WILLIAM (1753-1831), English historian and miscellaneous writer, was born on the 8th of March 1753 at&nbsp;Liverpool, where his father, who was a market gardener, kept&nbsp;a publichouse known as the Bowling Green at Mount Pleasant.&nbsp;Roscoe was eager in the acquisition of knowledge, and at twelve&nbsp;he left school, having learned all that his schoolmaster could&nbsp;teach. He now assisted his father in the work of the garden,&nbsp;and gave his leisure hours to reading and study. “ This mode&nbsp;of life,” he says, “ gave health and vigour to my body, and&nbsp;amusement and instruction to my mind; and to this day&nbsp;I well remember the delicious sleep which succeeded my labours,&nbsp;from which I was again called at an early hour. If I were&nbsp;now asked whom I consider to be the happiest of the human&nbsp;race, I should answer, those who cultivate the earth by their&nbsp;own hands.” At fifteen it was necessary to decide upon a&nbsp;path in life. A month’s trial of bookselling sufficed to disgust&nbsp;him, and in 1769 he was articled to a solicitor. Although a&nbsp;diligent student of law, he did not bid farewell to the Muses,&nbsp;but continued to read the classics, and made that acquaintance&nbsp;with the language and literature of Italy which became the&nbsp;instrument of his distinction in after life.' He wrote many&nbsp;verses: his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Mount Pleasant</span><span class="font0"> was composed when he was sixteen,&nbsp;and this and other verses, though now forgotten, won the&nbsp;esteem of good critics. In 1774 he commenced business as an&nbsp;attorney, and as soon as his professional gains warranted he&nbsp;married (1781) Jane, second daughter of William Griffies, a&nbsp;Liverpool tradesman, and had seven sons and three daughters.&nbsp;He had the courage to denounce the African slave trade in his&nbsp;native town, where not a little of the wealth came from this&nbsp;source. He wrote the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Wrongs of Africa</span><span class="font0"> (1787-1788), and entered&nbsp;into a controversy with an ex-Roman Catholic priest, who&nbsp;undertook to prove the “ licitness of the slave trade ” from&nbsp;the Bible. Roscoe was also a political pamphleteer, and like&nbsp;many other Liberals of the day hailed the promise of liberty&nbsp;in the French Revolution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Meanwhile he had steadily pursued his Italian studies, and had made extensive collections relating to the great ruler of&nbsp;Florence. The result was his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Life of Lorenzo de’ Medici,</span><span class="font0"> which&nbsp;appeared in 1796, and at once placed him in the front rank&nbsp;of contemporary historians. The work has often been reprinted,&nbsp;and translations in French, German and other languages show&nbsp;that its popularity was not confined to its author’s native land.&nbsp;Perhaps the most gratifying testimony was that of Fabroni,&nbsp;who had intended to translate his own Latin life of Lorenzo,&nbsp;but abandoned the design and induced Gaetano Mecherini&nbsp;to undertake an Italian version of Roscoe. In 1796 Roscoe&nbsp;gave up practice as an attorney, and had some thought of&nbsp;going to the bar, but relinquished the idea after keeping a&nbsp;single term. Between 1793 and 1800 he paid much attention&nbsp;to agriculture, and helped to reclaim Chat Moss, near Manchester. He also succeeded in restoring to good order the&nbsp;affairs of a banking house in which his friend William Clark,&nbsp;then resident in Italy, was a partner. This task led to his&nbsp;introduction to the business, which eventually proved disastrous. His translation of Tansillo’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Nurse</span><span class="font0"> appeared in 1798,&nbsp;and went through several editions. It is dedicated in a sonnet&nbsp;to his wife, who had practised the precepts of the Italian poet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Life and Pontificate of Leo the Tenth</span><span class="font0"> appeared in 1805, and was a natural sequel to that by which he had made his&nbsp;reputation. The work, whilst it maintained its author’s fame,&nbsp;did not, on the whole, meet with so favourable a reception as&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Life of Lorenzo,</span><span class="font0"> It has been frequently reprinted, and&nbsp;the insertion of the Italian translation in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Index</span><span class="font0"> did not&nbsp;prevent its circulation even in the papal states. Roscoe was&nbsp;elected member of parliament for Liverpool in 1806, but the&nbsp;House of Commons was not a congenial place, and at the dissolution in the following year he declined to be again a candidate. The commercial troubles of 1816 brought into difficulties&nbsp;the banking house with which he was connected, and forced&nbsp;the sale of his collection of books and pictures. It was on this&nbsp;occasion that he wrote the fine “ Sonnet on Parting with his Books.”&nbsp;Dr S. H. Spiker, the king of Prussia’s librarian, gives an interesting account of a visit to Roscoe at this period of trouble.&nbsp;Roscoe said he still desired to write a biography of Erasmus but&nbsp;“ wanted both leisure and youth.” This project was not&nbsp;executed (Spiker’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Travels through England,</span><span class="font0"> &amp;c., 1816). After&nbsp;a five years’ struggle to discharge the liabilities of the bank,&nbsp;the action of a small number of creditors forced the partners&nbsp;into bankruptcy in 1820. For a time Roscoe was in danger&nbsp;of arrest, but ultimately he received honourable discharge.&nbsp;On the dispersal of his library, the volumes most useful to him&nbsp;were secured by friends and placed in the Liverpool Athenaeum.&nbsp;The sum of £2500 was also invested for his benefit. The independent and sensitive nature of Roscoe made both these operations difficult. Having now resigned commercial pursuits&nbsp;entirely, he found a pleasant task in the arrangement of the&nbsp;great library at Holkham, the property of his friend Coke.&nbsp;In 1822 he issued an appendix of illustrations to his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lorenzo&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and also a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Memoir of Richard Robert Jones of Aberdaron,</span><span class="font0"> a&nbsp;remarkable self-taught linguist. The year 1824 was memorable&nbsp;for the death of his wife and the publication of his edition of&nbsp;the works of Pope, which involved him in a controversy with&nbsp;Bowles. His versatility was shown by the appearance of a&nbsp;folio monograph on the If</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">onandrian Plants,</span><span class="font0"> which was published&nbsp;in 1828. It appeared first in numbers, and the last part came&nbsp;out after his recovery from a paralytic attack. He died on&nbsp;the 30th of June 1831.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Roscoe’s character was a fine one. Under circumstances uncongenial and discouraging he steadfastly maintained the&nbsp;ideal of the intellectual life. Sensitive and conscientious,&nbsp;he sacrificed his possessions to a punctilious sense of duty.&nbsp;He had the courage of unpopular opinions, and, whilst promoting every good object in his native town, did not hesitate&nbsp;to speak out where plain dealing, as in the matter of slavery,&nbsp;was required. He was a sincere friend and exemplary in his&nbsp;domestic relations. Posterity is not likely to endorse the&nbsp;verdict of Horace Walpole, who thought Roscoe “ by far the&nbsp;best of our historians,” but in spite of newer lights and of some&nbsp;changes of fashion in the world of letters, his books on Lorenzo&nbsp;de’ Medici and Leo X. remain important contributions to&nbsp;historical literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In addition to the writings already named, Roscoe wrote tracts on penal jurisprudence, and contributed to the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Transactions</span><span class="font0"> of the&nbsp;Royal Society of Literature and of the Linnean Society. The first&nbsp;collected edition of his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Poetical Works</span><span class="font0"> was published in 1857, and</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
