<p><span class="font1">arising at intermediate places, and as these will not usually lie exactly on the direct line, deviations from straightness will&nbsp;be rendered necessary. In the second place, except in the&nbsp;unlikely event of all the places on the selected route lying&nbsp;at the same elevation, a line that is perfectly level is a&nbsp;physical impossibility; and from engineering considerations,&nbsp;even one with uniform gradients will be impracticable on the&nbsp;score of cost, unless the surface of the country is extraordinarily&nbsp;even. In these circumstances the constructor has two broad&nbsp;alternatives between which to choose. On the one hand he may&nbsp;make the line follow the natural inequalities of the ground as&nbsp;nearly as may be, avoiding the elevations and depressions by&nbsp;curves; or on the other he may aim at making it as nearly straight&nbsp;and level as possible by taking it through the elevations in&nbsp;cuttings or tunnels and across the depressions on embankments&nbsp;or bridges. He will incline to the first of these alternatives when&nbsp;cheapness of first cost is a desideratum, but, except in unusually&nbsp;favourable circumstances, the resulting line, being full of sharp&nbsp;curves and severe gradients, will be unsuited for fast running&nbsp;and will be unable to accommodate heavy traffic economically.&nbsp;If, however, cost within reasonable limits is a secondary con-sidcration and the intention is to build a line adapted for&nbsp;express trains and for the carriage of the largest volume of&nbsp;traffic with speed and economy, he will lean towards the second.&nbsp;In practice every line is a compromise between these two extremes&nbsp;, arrived at by carefully balancing a large number of&nbsp;varying factors. Other things being equal, that route is best&nbsp;which will serve the district most conveniently and secure&nbsp;the highest revenue; and the most favourable combination of&nbsp;curves and gradients is that by which the annual cost of conveying the traffic which the line will be called on to carry, added&nbsp;to the annual interest on the capital expended in construction,&nbsp;will be made a minimum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cuttings and Embankments. —</span><span class="font1">A cutting, or cut, is simply a trench dug in a hill or piece of rising ground, wide enough at&nbsp;the bottom to accommodate one or more pairs of rails, and&nbsp;deep enough to enable the line to continue its course on the&nbsp;level or on a moderate gradient. The slopes of the sides vary&nbsp;according to the nature of the ground, the amount of moisture&nbsp;present, &amp;c. In solid rock they may be vertical; in gravel,&nbsp;sand or common earth they must, to prevent slipping, rise&nbsp;1 ft. for 1 to 1½ or 2 ft. of base, or even more in treacherous&nbsp;clay. In soft material the excavation may be performed by&nbsp;mechanical excavators or “ steam navvies, ’’ while in hard it&nbsp;may be necessary to resort to blasting. Except in hard rock,&nbsp;the top width of a cutting, and therefore the amount of material&nbsp;to be excavated, increases rapidly with the depth; hence if&nbsp;a cutting exceeds a certain depth, which varies with the particular circumstances, it may be more economical, instead of&nbsp;forming the sides at the slope at which the material of which&nbsp;they are composed will stand, to make them nearly vertical&nbsp;and support the soil with a retaining wall, or to bore a tunnel.&nbsp;An embankment-bank, or fill, is the reverse of a cutting, being&nbsp;an artificial mound of earth on which the railway is taken&nbsp;across depressions in the surface of the ground. An endeavour&nbsp;is made so to plan the works of a railway that the quantity of&nbsp;earth excavated in cuttings shall be equal to the quantity&nbsp;required for the embankments; but this is not always practicable, and it is sometimes advantageous to obtain the earth&nbsp;from some source close to the embankment rather than incur&nbsp;the expense of hauling it from a distant cutting. As embankments have to support the weight of heavy trains, they must&nbsp;be uniformly firm and well drained, and before the line is fully&nbsp;opened for traffic they must be allowed time to consolidate, a&nbsp;process which is helped by running construction or mineral&nbsp;trains over them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">An interesting case of embankment and cutting in combination was involved in crossing Chat Moss on the Liverpool &amp; Manchester&nbsp;railway. The moss was 4½ m. across, and it varied in depth from&nbsp;10 to 30 ft. Its general character was such that cattle could not&nbsp;stand on it, and a piece of iron would sink in it. The subsoil was&nbsp;composed principally of clay and sand, and the railway had to be&nbsp;earned over the moss on the level, requiring cutting, and embanking&nbsp;for upwards of. 4 m. In forming </span><span class="font2">277, 000 </span><span class="font1">cub. yds. of embankment&nbsp;670, 000 yds. 01 raw peat were consumed, the difference being&nbsp;occasioned by the squeezing out of the water. Large quantities&nbsp;of embanking were sunk in the moss, and, when the engineer,&nbsp;George Stephenson, after a month’s vigorous operations, had made&nbsp;up his estimates, the apparent work done was sometimes less than&nbsp;at the beginning of the month. The railway ultimately was made&nbsp;to float on the bog. Where embankment was required drains&nbsp;about 5 yds. apart were cut, and when the moss between them&nbsp;was dry it was used to form the embankment. Where the way&nbsp;was formed on the level, drains were cut on each side of the intended&nbsp;line, and were intersected here and there by cross drains, by which&nbsp;the upper part of the moss was rendered dry and firm. On this&nbsp;surface hurdles were placed, 4 ft. broad and 9 long, covered with&nbsp;heath, upon which the ballast was laid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bridges. —</span><span class="font1">For conveying small streams through embankments, channels or culverts are constructed in brickwork or masonry. Larger rivers, canals, roads, other railways and&nbsp;sometimes deep narrow valleys are crossed by bridges (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">q. v.</span><span class="font1"> )&nbsp;of timber, brick, stone, wrought iron or steel, and many of&nbsp;these structures rank among the largest engineering works&nbsp;in the world. Sometimes also a viaduct consisting of a series&nbsp;of arches is preferred to an embankment when the line has to&nbsp;be taken over a piece of flat alluvial plain, or when it is desired&nbsp;to economize space and to carry the line at a sufficient height&nbsp;to clear the streets, as in the case of various railways entering&nbsp;London and other large towns. In connexion with a railway&nbsp;many bridges have also to be constructed to carry public&nbsp;roads and other railways over the line, and for the use of owners&nbsp;or tenants whose land it has cut through (“ accommodation&nbsp;bridges ”). In the early days of railways, roads were often&nbsp;taken across the line on the level, but such “ level ” or “ grade ”&nbsp;crossings are now usually avoided in the case of new lines in&nbsp;populous countries, except when the traffic on both the road&nbsp;and the railway is very light. In many instances old level&nbsp;crossings have been replaced by over-bridges with long sloping&nbsp;approaches; in this way considerable expenditure has been&nbsp;involved, justified, however, by the removal of a danger to&nbsp;the public and of interruptions to the traffic on both the roads&nbsp;and the railways. In cases where the route of a line runs across&nbsp;a river or other piece of water so wide that the construction of&nbsp;a bridge is either impossible or would be more costly than&nbsp;is warranted by the volume of traffic, the expedient is some-times adopted of carrying the wagons and carriages across&nbsp;bodily with their loads on train ferries, so as to avoid the&nbsp;inconvenience and delay of transshipment. Such train ferries&nbsp;arc common in America, especially on the Great Lakes, and&nbsp;exist at several places in Europe, as in the Baltic between&nbsp;Denmark and Sweden and Denmark and Germany, and across&nbsp;the Straits of Messina.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Gradients. —</span><span class="font1">The gradient or grade of a line is the rate at which it rises or falls, above or below the horizontal, and is&nbsp;expressed by stating either the horizontal distance in which&nbsp;the change of level amounts to 1 ft., or the amount of&nbsp;change that would occur in some selected distance, such as&nbsp;100 ft., 1000 ft. or 1 m. In America a gradient of 1 in 100&nbsp;is often known as a 1% grade, one of 2 in 100 as a 2% grade,&nbsp;and so on; thus a 0∙25% grade corresponds to what in England would be known as a gradient of 1 in 400. The ruling&nbsp;gradient of a section of railway is the steepest incline in that&nbsp;section, and is so called because it governs or rules the maximum&nbsp;load that can be placed behind an engine working over that&nbsp;portion of line. Sometimes, however, a sharp incline occurring&nbsp;on an otherwise easy line is not reckoned as the ruling gradient,&nbsp;trains heavier than could be drawn up it by a single engine&nbsp;being helped by an assistant or “ bank ” engine; sometimes&nbsp;also “ momentum ” or “ velocity ” grades, steeper than the&nbsp;ruling gradient, are permitted for short distances in cases where&nbsp;a train can approach at full speed and thus surmount them by&nbsp;the aid of its momentum. An incline of 1 in 400 is reckoned&nbsp;easy, of 1 in 200 moderate and of 1 in 100 heavy. The ruling&nbsp;gradient of the Liverpool &amp; Manchester railway was fixed at&nbsp;1 in 900, excepting the inclines at Liverpool and at Rainhill&nbsp;summit, for working which special provision was made; and&nbsp;I. </span><span class="font0">K.
