<p><span class="font1">to live with him, for we find her claiming a chest as her property at his sale in 1658. DoubtIess she is the peasant girl of Rasdorf&nbsp;to whom Houbraken says Rembrandt was married. Sad as the&nbsp;story is, Hendrickje has an interest for us. Bode asserts that in&nbsp;his art there was always a woman in close reIationship to Rembrandt and appearing in his work—his mother, his sister and&nbsp;then Saskia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">He also suggests that the beautiful portrait of the “ Lady ” in the Salon Carré of the Louvre and the “ Venus and Cupid ” of&nbsp;the same gallery may represent Hendrickje and her child. Both&nbsp;pictures belong to this date, and by their treatment are removed&nbsp;from the category of Rembrandt’s usual portraits. But if this&nbsp;is conjecture, we get nearer to fact when we look at the picture&nbsp;exhibited at Burlington House in 1883 to which tradition has&nbsp;attached the name of “ Rembrandt’s Mistress,” now in the&nbsp;Edinburgh National Gallery. At a glance one can see that it is&nbsp;not the mere head of a model, as she lies in bed raising herself&nbsp;to put aside a curtain as if she heard a well-known footstep. It&nbsp;is clearly a woman in whom Rembrandt had a personal interest.&nbsp;The date is clearly 165— the fourth figure being illegible; but&nbsp;the brilliant carnations and masterly touch connect it with&nbsp;the “ Potiphar’s Wife ” of 1654 and the Jaghers period. In 1656&nbsp;Rembrandt’s financial affairs became more involved, and the&nbsp;Orphans’ Chamber transferred the house and ground to Titus,&nbsp;though Rembrandt was still allowed to take charge of Saskia’s&nbsp;estate. Nothing, however, could avert the ruin of the painter,&nbsp;who was declared bankrupt in July 1656, an inventory of all his&nbsp;property being ordered by the Insolvency Chamber. The first&nbsp;sale took place in 1657 in the Keizerskroon hotel; and the second&nbsp;in 1658, when the larger part of the etchings and drawings were&nbsp;disposed of—“ collected by Rembrandt himsclf with much Iove&nbsp;and care,” says the catalogue. The sum realized, under 5000&nbsp;guilders, was but a fraction of their value. The time was&nbsp;unfavourable over the whole of Europe for such sales, the&nbsp;renowned collection of Charles I. of England having brought but&nbsp;a comparatively small sum in 1653. Driven thus from his house,&nbsp;stripped of everything he possessed, even to his table linen,&nbsp;Rembrandt took a modest lodging in the same Keizerskroon&nbsp;hosteIry (the amounts of his bills are on record), apparently&nbsp;without friends and thrown entirely on himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But this dark year of 1656 stands'out prominently as one in which some of his greatest works were produced, as, for example, “John&nbsp;the Baptist preaching in the Wilderness,” of the Berlin Gallery, and&nbsp;“ Jacob blessing the Sons of Joseph,” of the Cassel Gallery, lt&nbsp;is impossible not to respect the man who, amid the utter ruin of his&nbsp;affairs, could calmly conceive and carry out such noble work. Yet&nbsp;even in his art one can see that the tone of his mind was sombre.&nbsp;Instead of the brilliancy of 1654 we have for two or three years a&nbsp;preference for dull yellows, reds and greys, with a certain uniformity of tone. The handling is broad and rapid, as if to give&nbsp;utterance to the ideas which crowded on his mind. There is less&nbsp;caressing of colour for its own sake, even less straining after&nbsp;vigorous effect of light and shade. Still the two pictures just named&nbsp;are among the greatest works of the master. To the same year&nbsp;belongs the “ Lesson in Anatomy of Johann Deyman.” The subject is similar to the great Tulp of 1632, but his manner and power&nbsp;of colour had advanced so much that Sir Joshua Reynolds, in his&nbsp;visit to Holland in 1781, was reminded by it of Michelangelo and&nbsp;Titian.@@<sup>1</sup> Vosmaer ascribes to the same year, though Bode places&nbsp;it later, the famous “ Portrait of Jan Six,” the future burgomaster, consummate in its ease and character, as Six descends the&nbsp;steps of his house drawing on his glove. The connexion between&nbsp;Rembrandt and the great family of Six was long and close. In&nbsp;1641, the mother of Six, Anna Wymer, had been painted with consummate skill by Rembrandt, who also executed in 1647 the beautiful etching of Six standing by a window reading his tragedy of&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Medea,</span><span class="font2"> afterwards illustrated by his friend. Now he paints his&nbsp;portrait in the prime of manhood, and in the same year of gloom&nbsp;paints for him the masterly “ John the Baptist.” Six, if he could&nbsp;not avert the disaster of Rembrandt’s life, at least stood by him in&nbsp;the darkest hour, when certainly the creative energy of Rembrandt&nbsp;was in full play. The same period gives us the “ Master of the&nbsp;Vineyard,” and the “ Adoration of the Magi ” of Buckingham&nbsp;Palace.</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font2">@@@<sup>1</sup> This picture has had a strange history. It had suffered by fire and was sold to a Mr Chaplin of London in 1841, was exhibited in&nbsp;Leeds in 1868, and again disappeared, ultimately to be found in the&nbsp;storeroom of the South Kensington Museum as a doubtful Rembrandt. The patriotism of some Dutch lovers of art restored it to&nbsp;its native country; and it now hangs, a magnificent fragment, in&nbsp;the museum of Amsterdam.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font2">After the sale of the house in the Breedstraat, Rembrandt retired to the Rosengracht, an obscure quarter at the west end of the city.&nbsp;We are now drawing to the splendid close of his career in his third&nbsp;manner, in which his touch became broader, his impasto more solid&nbsp;and his knowledge more complete. We may mention the “ Old&nbsp;Man with the Grey Beard ” of the National Gallery (1657) and the&nbsp;“ Bruyningh, the Secretary of the Insolvents' Chamber,” of CasseI&nbsp;(1658), both leading up to the great portraits of the “ Syndics of&nbsp;the Cloth Hall ” of 1661. Nearly thirty years separate us from the&nbsp;“ Lesson in Anatomy,” years of long-continued observation and&nbsp;labour. The knowledge thus gathered, the problems solved, the&nbsp;mastery attained, are shown here in abundance. Rembrandt&nbsp;returns to the simplest gamut of colour, but shows his skill in the&nbsp;use of it, leaving on the spectator an impression of absolute enjoyment of the result, unconscious of the means. The plain burghers,&nbsp;dealing with the simple concerns of their gild arrest our attention&nbsp;as if they were the makers of history. They live for ever; and we&nbsp;close our eyes to the strange perspective of the table.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In his old age Rembrandt continued to paint his own portrait as assiduously as in his youthful and happy days. About&nbsp;twenty of these portraits are known; a typicaI one is to be found&nbsp;in the National Gallery. All show the same self-reliant expression, though broken down indeed by age and the cares of a hard&nbsp;life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">About the year 1663 Rembrandt painted the (so-called) “ Jewish Bride ” of the Ryks Museum in Amsterdam, and the&nbsp;“ Family Group ” of Brunswick, the last and perhaps the most&nbsp;brilliant works of his life, bold and rapid in execution and&nbsp;marvellous in the subtle mixture and play of colours in which&nbsp;he seems to revel. The woman and children are painted with&nbsp;such love that the impression is conveyed that they represent a&nbsp;fancy family group of the painter in his old age. This idea&nbsp;received some confirmation from the supposed discovery that&nbsp;he left a widow’ Catherine Van Wyck and two children, but this&nbsp;theory falls to the ground, for de Roever has shown </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Oud&nbsp;Holland,</span><span class="font1"> 1883) that Catherine was the widow of a marine painter&nbsp;Theunisz Blanckerhoff, who died about the same time as Rembrandt. The mistake arose from a miscopying of the register.&nbsp;The subject of these pictures is thus more mysterious than ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In 1668 Titus, the only son of Rembrandt, died, leaving one child, and on the 8th of October 1669 the great painter himself&nbsp;passed away, leaving two children, and was buried in the Wester&nbsp;Kerk. He had outlived his popularity, for his manner of painting, as we know from contemporaries, was no longer in favour&nbsp;with a people who preferred the smooth trivialities of Van der&nbsp;Werff and the younger Mieris, the leaders of an expiring school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We must give but a short notice of Rembrandt’s achievements in etching. Here he stands out by universal confession as first, excelling by his unrivalled technical skill, his mastery of expression and&nbsp;the lofty conceptions of many of his great pieces, as in the “ Death&nbsp;of the Virgin, the “ Christ Preaching,” the “ Christ Healing the&nbsp;Sick ” (the “ Hundred Guilder Print ”), the “ Presentation to the&nbsp;People,” the “ Crucifixion ” and others. So great is his skill simply&nbsp;as an etcher that one is apt to overlook the nobleness of the etchers&nbsp;ideas and the depth of his nature, and this tendency has been doubtless confirmed by the enormous difference in money value between&nbsp;“ states ” of the same plate, rarity giving in many cases a factitious&nbsp;worth in the eyes of collectors. A single impression of one of his&nbsp;etchings—“ Rembrandt with a Sabre ”—realized £2000 at the&nbsp;Holford sale in 1893, when “ Ephraim Bonus, with black ring ”&nbsp;fetched £1950, and the “ Hundred Guilder Print,” £1750. The&nbsp;points of difference between these states arise from the additions&nbsp;and changes made by Rembrandt on the plate; and the prints&nbsp;taken off by him have been subjected to the closest inspection by&nbsp;Bartsch, Gersaint, Wilson, Daulby, De Claussin, C. Blanc, Willshire,&nbsp;Seymour Haden, Middleton and others, who have described them&nbsp;at great length, and to whom the reader is referred. The classification of Rembrandt’s etchings adopted till lately was according to&nbsp;the subject, as Biblical, portrait, landscape, and so on; until&nbsp;Vosmaer attempted the more scientific and interesting line of&nbsp;chronology. This method has been developed by Sir F. Seymour&nbsp;Haden and Middletom<sup>x</sup> But even in 1873 C. Blanc, in his fine work&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">L'Œuvre complet de Rembrandt,</span><span class="font2"> still adheres to the older and less&nbsp;intelligent arrangement, resting his · preference on the frequent&nbsp;absence of dates on the etchings and more strangely still on the&nbsp;equality of the work. Sir Seymour Haden’s reply is “ that the more&nbsp;important etchings which may be taken as types are dated, and&nbsp;that, the style of the etchings at different periods of Rembrandt's&nbsp;career being fully as marked as that of his paintings, no more</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
