<p><span class="font0">RUBY MINES, a district in tbe Mandalay division of Upper Burma, lying along the Irrawaddy river between the Bhamo&nbsp;district on the N., the Shan States on the E., Mandalay district&nbsp;on the S. and Katha on the W. Including the Shan state of&nbsp;Mongmit, which is temporarily administered as part of the&nbsp;district, the total area is 5476 sq. m.; pop. (1901) 87,694. The&nbsp;district geographically forms part of the Shan plateau, and is&nbsp;to a great extent a mass of hills with a general N. and S. direction. It contains considerable numbers of Kachins (13,300)&nbsp;and Palaungs (16,400). The annual rainfall at Mogok averages&nbsp;98 in. The administrative headquarters are at Mogok, which&nbsp;is also the centre of the ruby-mining industry. It stands in&nbsp;the centre of a valley 4000 ft. above sea-level, and is reached&nbsp;by a cart-road from Thabeikkyin, 61 m. distant, on the Irrawaddy. The Ruby Mines Company employs about 44 Europeans and Eurasians in its works, which are situated at the&nbsp;north end of the town. The company has constructed a dam&nbsp;across the Yeni stream and set up an electric installation of&nbsp;about 450 horse-power, which works pumps and the washing&nbsp;machinery. The mines were worked under Burmese rule, but&nbsp;were discontinued on account of the small profit. Now they&nbsp;seem to be established on a sound financial basis. The system&nbsp;adopted is to excavate large open pits, from which the ruby-earth or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">byon</span><span class="font0"> is removed </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">en masse</span><span class="font0"> and washed and crushed&nbsp;by machinery. Spinels and sapphires are found with the&nbsp;rubies. In 1904, the produce of rubies alone was 200,000&nbsp;carats, valued at £80,000, most of which were sent to London&nbsp;for sale. In addition, some mining is carried on by natives,&nbsp;working under a licence which doeâ not permit the use of&nbsp;machinery. The district contains 994 sq. m. of reserved forests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RÜCKERT, JOHANN MICHAEL FRIEDRICH (1788-1866), German poet, was born at Schweinfurt on the 16th of May&nbsp;1788, the eldest son of a lawyer. He was educated at the&nbsp;gymnasium of his native place and at the universities of Würzburg and Heidelberg. For some time (1816-17) he worked&nbsp;on the editorial staff of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Morgenblatt</span><span class="font0"> at Stuttgart. Nearly&nbsp;the whole of the year 1818 he spent in Rome, and afterwards&nbsp;he lived for several years at Coburg. He was appointed a&nbsp;professor of Oriental languages at the university of Erlangen in&nbsp;1826, and in 1841 he was called to a similar position in Berlin,&nbsp;where he was also made a privy councillor. In 1849 he resigned&nbsp;his professorship at Berlin, and went to live on his estate Neuses&nbsp;near Coburg. He died on the 31st of January 1866. When&nbsp;Rückert began his literary career, Germany was engaged in&nbsp;her life-and-death struggle with Napoleon; and in his first&nbsp;volume, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Deutsche Gedichte,</span><span class="font0"> published in 1814 under the&nbsp;pseudonym “ Freimund Raimar,” he gave, particularly in&nbsp;the powerful “Geharnischte Sonette/’ vigorous expression to the&nbsp;prevailing sentiment of his countrymen. In 1815-18 appeared&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Napoleon, eine politische Komödie in drei Stücken</span><span class="font0"> (only two&nbsp;parts were published), and in 1817 </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Der Kranz der Zeit.</span><span class="font0"> He&nbsp;issued a collection of poems, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Östliche Rosen,</span><span class="font0"> in 1822; and in&nbsp;1834-38 his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Gesammelte Gedichte</span><span class="font0"> were published in six volumes,&nbsp;a selection from which has passed through many editions.&nbsp;Rückert, who was master of thirty languages, made his mark&nbsp;chiefly as a translator of Oriental poetry and as a writer of&nbsp;poems conceived in the spirit of Oriental masters. Much&nbsp;attention was attracted by a translation of Hariri’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Makamen&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(1826), </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Nal und Damajanti,</span><span class="font0"> an Indian tale (1828), </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Röstern und&nbsp;Suhrab, eine Heldengeschichte</span><span class="font0"> (1838), and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hamasa, oder die&nbsp;ältesten arabischen Volkslieder</span><span class="font0"> (1846). Among his original&nbsp;writings dealing with Oriental subjects are </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Morgenländische&nbsp;Sagen und Geschichten</span><span class="font0"> (1837), </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Erbauliches und Beschauliches&nbsp;aus dem Morgenland</span><span class="font0"> (1836-38), and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Brahmanische Erzählungen&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(1839). The most elaborate of his works is </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Die Weisheit des&nbsp;Brahmanen,</span><span class="font0"> published in six volumes in 1836-39. This last&nbsp;and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Liebesfrühling</span><span class="font0"> (1844), a cycle of love-songs, are the&nbsp;best known of all Ruckert’s productions. In 1843-45 he issued&nbsp;the dramas </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Saul und David</span><span class="font0"> (1843)4 </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Herodes der Grosse</span><span class="font0"> (1844),</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Kaiser Heinrich IV.</span><span class="font0"> (1845) and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Christof ero Colombo</span><span class="font0"> (1845), all of which are greatly inferior to the work to which he owes bis&nbsp;place in German literature. At the time of the Danish war&nbsp;in 1864 he wrote </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ein Dutzend Kampflieder für Schleswig-Holstein,</span><span class="font0"> which, although published anonymously, produced&nbsp;a considerable impression. After his death many poetical&nbsp;translations and original poems were found among his papers,&nbsp;and several collections of them were published. Rückert&nbsp;had a splendour of imagination which made Oriental poetry&nbsp;congenial to him, and he has seldom been surpassed in rhythmic&nbsp;skill and metrical ingenuity. There are hardly any lyrical&nbsp;forms which are not represented among his works, and in all&nbsp;of them he wrote with equal ease and grace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A complete edition of Rückert’s poetical works appeared in 12 vols. in 1868-69. Subsequent editions have been edited by&nbsp;L. Laistner (1896), C. Beyer (1896), G. Ellinger (1897). See&nbsp;B. Fortlage, F. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rückert und seine Werke</span><span class="font0"> (1867); C.

<p><span class="font0">RÜDAGI (d. 954). Farid-eddln Mahommed 'Abdallah, the first great literary genius of modern Persia, was born in Rüdag,&nbsp;a village in Transoxiana, about 870-900. Most of his biographers&nbsp;assert that he was totally blind, but the accurate knowledge&nbsp;of colours shown in his poems makes this very doubtful. The&nbsp;fame of his accomplishments reached the ear of the Sämänid&nbsp;Nasr II. bin Ahmad, the ruler of Khoräsän and Transoxiana&nbsp;(913-42), who invited the poet to his court.. Rüdagi became&nbsp;his daily companion, rose to the highest honours and amassed&nbsp;great wealth. In spite of various predecessors, he well deserves&nbsp;the title of “ father of Persian literature,” “ the Adam or ’&nbsp;Sultan of poets,” since he was the first who impressed upon&nbsp;every form of epic, lyric and didactic poetry its peculiar stamp&nbsp;and its individual character. He is also said to have been&nbsp;the founder of the “ di wan ”—that is, the typical form of the&nbsp;complete collection of a poet’s lyrical compositions in a more&nbsp;or less alphabetical order which prevails to the present day&nbsp;among all Mahommedan writers. Of the 1,300,000 verses&nbsp;attributed to him, there remain only 52 kasidas, ghazals&nbsp;and rubais; of his epic masterpieces we have nothing beyond&nbsp;a few stray lines in native dictionaries. But the most serious&nbsp;loss is that of his translation of Ibn Mokaffa’s Arabic version&nbsp;of the old Indian fable book </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Kalilah and Dimnah,</span><span class="font0"> which he put&nbsp;into Persian verse at the request of his royal patron. Numerous&nbsp;fragments, however, are preserved in the Persian lexicon of&nbsp;Asadl of Tus (ed. P. Hom, Göttingen, 1897). In his kasidas,&nbsp;all devoted to the praise of his sovereign and friend,&nbsp;Rüdagi has left us unequalled models of a refined and delicate&nbsp;taste, very different from the often bombastic compositions&nbsp;of later Persian encomiasts. His didactic odes and epigrams&nbsp;express in well-measured lines a sort of Epicurean philosophy&nbsp;of human life and human happiness; more charming still are&nbsp;the purely lyrical pieces in glorification of love and wine.&nbsp;Rüdagi survived his royal friend, and died poor and forgotten&nbsp;by the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There is a complete edition of all the extant poems of Rüdagi, in Persian text and metrical German translation, together with a&nbsp;biographical account, based on forty-six Persian MSS., in Dr H.&nbsp;Eth6’s “ Rüdagi der Samänidendichter ” </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">{Göttinger Nachrichten,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">1873, PP* 663-742); see also his “Neupersische Literatur” in&nbsp;Geigers </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Grundriss der iranischen Philologie</span><span class="font0"> (ii.); P. Horn, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Gesch.&nbsp;der persischen Literatur</span><span class="font0"> (1901), p. 73; E. G.

<p><span class="font0">RUDD, or Red-Eye </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">{Leuciseus erythrophthalmus},</span><span class="font0"> a fish of the Cyprinid family, spread over Europe, N. and S. of the Alps,&nbsp;also found in Asia Minor, and common in localities where there&nbsp;are still waters with muddy bottom. The rudd and the roach&nbsp;are very similar and frequently confused by anglers; the&nbsp;former differs principally in the more posterior dorsal fin,&nbsp;which is situated exactly opposite the space between the ventral&nbsp;and anal fins. It is a fine fish, but little esteemed for food,</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
