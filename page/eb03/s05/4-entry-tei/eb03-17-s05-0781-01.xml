(Sir Richard), was born about the year 1676 in Dublin ; in which kingdom one branch of the family was posseſſed of a conſiderable eſtate in the<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0788.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s05-0782"/>
county of Wexford. His father, a counſellor at law in Dublin, was private ſecretary to James duke of Ormond ; but be was of Engliſh extraction : and his ſon, while very young, being carried to London, he put him to ſchool at the Charter-houſe, whence he was removed to Merton College in Oxford. Our author left the univerſity, which he did without taking any degree, in the full reſolution to enter into the army. This step was highly diſpleaſing to his friends ; but the ardour of his paſſion for a military life rendered him deaf to any other propoſal. Not being able to procure a better ſtation, he entered as a private gentleman in the horſe guards, notwithſtanding he thereby loſt the ſucceſſion to his Iriſh eſtate. However, as he had a flow of good-nature, a generous openneſs and frankneſs of ſpirit, and a ſparkling vivacity of wit, theſe qualities rendered him the delight of the ſoldiery, and procured him an ensign’s commiſſion in the guards. In the mean time, as he had made choice of a profeſſion which ſet him free from all the ordinary reſtraints in youth, he ſpared not to indulge his inclinations in the wildeſt exceſſes. Yet his gaieties and revels did not paſs without ſome cool hours of reflection ; it was in theſe that he drew up his little treatiſe intitled <hi rend="italic">The Christian Hero,</hi> with a deſign, if we may believe himſeſſ, to be a check upon his paſſions. For this purpoſe it had lain ſome time by him, when he printed it in 1701, with a dedication to Lord Cutts, who had not only appointed him his private ſecretary, but procured for him a company in Lord Lucas’s regiment of Fuſileers.</p><p>The ſame year he brought out his comedy called <hi rend="italic">The Funeral,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Grief a la mode.</hi> This play procured him the regard of King William, who reſolved to give him ſome eſſential marks of his favour ; and though, upon that prince’s death, his hopes were diſappointed, yet, in the beginning of Queen Anne’s reign, he was appointed to the profitable place of gazetteer. He owed this poſt to the friendſhip of lord Halifax and the earl of Sunderland, to whom he had been recommended by his ſchool-fellow Mr Addiſon. That gentleman alſo lent him an helping hand in promoting the comedy called <hi rend="italic">The Tender Huſband,</hi> which was acted in 1704 with great ſucceſs. But his next play, The Lying Lover, had a very different fate. Upon this rebuff from the stage, he turned the ſame humorous current into another channel ; and early in the year 1709, he began to publiſh the Tatler : which admirable paper was undertaken in concert with Dr Swift. His reputation was perfectly eſtabliſhed by this work ; and, during the courſe of it, he was made a commiſſioner of the ſtamp- duties in 1710. Upon the change of the miniſtry the same year, he joined the duke of Marlborough, who had ſeveral years entertained a friendſhip for him ; and upon his Grace’s diſmiſſion from all employments in 1711, Mr Steele addreſſed a letter of thanks to him for the ſervices which he had done to his country. However, as our author still continued to hold his place in the ſtamp-oſſice under the new adminiſtration, he forbore entering with his pen upon political subjects ; but, adhering more cloſely to Mr Addiſon, he dropt the Tatler, and afterwards, by the aſſiſtance chiefly of that ſteady friend, he carried on the ſame plan much improved under the title of <hi rend="italic">The Spectator.</hi> The ſucceſs of this paper was equal to that of the former ; which encouraged him, before the cloſe of it, to proceed upon the ſame deſign in the character of the <hi rend="italic">Guardian.</hi> This was opened in the beginning of the year 1713, and was laid down in October the same year. But in the courſe of it his thoughts took a ſtronger turn to politics: he engaged with great warmth againſt the miniſtry ; and being determined to proſecute his views that way by procuring a ſeat in the houſe of commons, he immediately removed all obſtacles thereto. For that purpoſe he took care to prevent a forcible diſmiſſion from his poſt in the ſtamp office, by a timely reſignation of it to the Earl of Oxford; and at the ſame time gave up a penſion, which had been till this time paid him by the queen as a ſervant to the late prince George of Denmark. This done, he wrote the famous Guardian upon the demolition of Dunkirk, which was publiſhed Aug. 7. 1713; and the parliament being diſſolved next day, the Guardian was ſoon followed by ſeveral other warm political tracts againſt the admimſtration. Upon the meeting of the new parliament, Mr Steele having been returned a member for the borough of Stockbridge in Dorſetſhire, took his ſeat accordingly in the houſe of commons ; but was expelled thence in a few days after, for writing the cloſe oſ the paper called the <hi rend="italic">Engliſhman,</hi> and one of his political pieces intitled the <hi rend="italic">Crisis.</hi> Preſently after his expulsion, he publiſhed propoſals for writing the hiſtory of the duke of Marlborough ; at the ſame time he alſo wrote the <hi rend="italic">Spinſter ;</hi> and, in oppoſition to the <hi rend="italic">Examiner,</hi> he ſet up a paper called the <hi rend="italic">Reader,</hi> and continued publiſhing ſeveral other things in the same ſpirit till the death of the queen. Immediately after which, as a reward for theſe ſervices, he was taken into favour by her ſucceſſor to the throne, king George I. He was appointed ſurveyor of the royal fiables at Hampton- Court, governor of the royal company of comedians, put into the commiſſion of the peace for the county of Middleſex, and in 1715 received the honour oſ knighthood. In the firſt parliament oſ that king, he was choſen member for Boroughbridge in Yorkſhire ; and, after the ſuppreſſion of the rebellion in the north, was appointed one of the commiſſioners of the forfeited eſtates in Scotland. In 1718, he buried his second wife, who had brought him a handſome fortune and a good eſtate in Wales ; but neither that, nor the ample additions lately made to his income, were ſufficient to anſwer his demands. The thoughtleſs vivacity of his ſpirit often reduced him to little ſhifts of wit for its ſupport ; and the project of the Fiſh-pool this year owed its birth chiefly to the projector’s neceſſities. This veſſel was intended to carry fiſh alive, and without waiting, to any part of the kingdom : but notwithſtanding all his towering hopes, the ſcheme proved very ruinous to him ; for after he had been at an immenſe expence in contriving and building his veſſel, beſides the charge of the patent, which he had procured, it turned out upon trial to be a mere project. His plan was to bring ſalmon alive from the coaſt of Ireland ; but theſe fiſh, though supplied by this contrivance with a continual ſtream of water while at ſea, yet uneaſy at their confinement, ſhattered themſelves to pieces againſt the ſides of the pool ; ſo that when they were brought to market they were worth very little.</p><p>The following year he oppoſed the remarkable peerage bill in the houſe of commons ; and, during the<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0789.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s05-0783"/>
courſe of this , oppoſition to the court, his licence for acting plays was revoked, and his patent rendered ineffectual, at the inſtance of the lord chamberlain. He did his utmoſt to prevent ſo great a loſs ; and finding every direct avenue of approach to his royal maſter effectually barred againſt him by his powerful adverſary, he had recourſe to the method of applying to the public, in hopes that his complaints would reach the ear of his ſovereign, though in an indirect courſe, by that canal. In this ſpirit he formed the plan of a periodical paper, to be publiſhed twice a-week, under the title of the <hi rend="italic">Theatre ;</hi> the firſt number of which came out on the 2d of January 1719-20. In the mean time, the misfortune of being out of favour at court, like other misfortunes, drew after it a train oſ more. During the courſe of this paper, in which he had aſſumed the feigned name of <hi rend="italic">Sir John Edgar,</hi> he was outrageouſly attacked by Mr Dennis, the noted critic, in a very abuſive pamphlet, intitled <hi rend="italic">The Character and Conduct of Sir John Edgar.</hi> To this inſult our author made a proper reply in the Theatre.</p><p>While he was ſtruggling with all his might to ſave himſelf from ruin, he found time to turn his pen againſt the miſcſhievous South-Sea ſcheme, which had nearly brought the nation to ruin in 1720 ; and the next year he was reſtored to his office and authority in the play- houſe in Drury-Lane. Of this it was not long before he made an additional advantage, by bringing his celebrated comedy called the <hi rend="italic">Conscious Lovers</hi> upon that ſtage, where it was acted with prodigious ſucceſs ; ſo that the receipt there muſt have been very conſiderable, beſides the profits accruing by the ſale of the copy, and a purſe of 500 l. given to him by the king, to whom he dedicated it. Yet notwithſtanding theſe ample ſupplies, about the year following, being reduced to the utmoſt extremity, he ſold his ſhare in the play-houſe ; and ſoon after commenced a law-ſuit with the managers, which in 1726 was determined to his diſadvantage. Having now again, for the laſt time, brought his fortune, by the moſt heedleſs profuſion, into a deſperate condition, he was rendered altogether incapable of retrieving the loſs, by being ſeized with a paralytic diſorder, which greatly impaired bis underſtanding. In theſe unhappy circumſtances, he retired to his teat at Languanor near Caermarthen in Wales, where he paid the laſt debt to nature on the 21 ſt of September 1729, and was privately interred, according to his own desire, in the church of Caermarthen. Among his papers were found the manuscripts of two plays, one called <hi rend="italic">The Gentlemen,</hi> founded upon the eunuch of Terence, and the other intitled <hi rend="italic">The School oſ Action,</hi> both nearly finiſhed.</p><p>Sir Richard was a man of undiſſembled and extenſive benevolence, a friend to the friendleſs, and, as far as his circumſtances would permit, the father of every orphan. His works are chaſte and manly. He was a ſtranger to the moſt diſtant appearance of envy or malevolence ; never jealous of any man’s growing reputation ; and ſo far from arrogating any praiſe to himſelf from his conjunction with Mr Addiſon, that he was the firſt who deſired him to diſtinguiſh his papers. His greateſt error was want of economy : however, he was certainly the moſt agreeable, and (it we may be allowed the expreſſion) the moſt innocent rake that ever trod the rounds of diſſipation.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
