 in botany: A genus of plants belonging to the claſs of <hi rend="italic">tetradynamia,</hi> and to the order of <hi rend="italic">ſiliquoſa ;</hi> and in the natural ſyſtem ranged under the 39th order, <hi rend="italic">Siliquoſae.</hi> The calyx conſiſts of four expanding ſtrap-ſhaped deciduous leaves ; the ungues or baſes of the petals are ſtraight ; two glandules between the ſhorter ſtamina and piſtillum, alſo between the longer and the calyx. There are 17 ſpecies ; the arvenſis, orientalis, brassicata, alba, nigra, pyrenaica, pubeſcens, chinenſis, juncea, erucoides, allioni, hiſpanica, millefolia, incana, laevigata, cernua, and japonica. Three of theſe are natives of Britain ; the alba, nigra, and arvenſis.</p><p>1. The alba, or white muſtard, which is generally cultivated as a ſalad herb for winter and ſpring uſe. This riſes with a branched hairy ſtalk two feet high ; the leaves are deeply jagged on their edges and rough. The flowers are diſpoſed in looſe ſpikes at the end of the branches, ſtanding upon horizontal footſtalks; they have four yellow petals in form of a croſs, which are ſucceeded by hairy pods, that end with long, compreſſed, oblique beaks ; the pods generally contain four white ſeeds.</p><p>2. The nigra, or common muſtard, which is frequently found growing naturally in many parts of Britain, but is alſo cultivated in fields for the seed, of which the sauce called <hi rend="italic">mustard</hi> is made. This riſes with a branching ſtalk four or five feet high ; the lower leaves are large, rough, and very like thoſe of turnip ; the upper leaves are ſmaller and leſs jagged. The flowers are ſmall, yellow, and grow in ſpiked cluſters at the end of the branches ; they have four petals placed in form oſ a croſs, and are ſucceeded by smooth four-cornered pods.</p><p>3. The arvenſis, grows naturally on arable land in many parts of Britain. The feed of this is commonly fold under the title of <hi rend="italic">Durham mustard-seed.</hi> Of this there are two varieties, if not diſtinct ſpecies; the one with cut, the other with entire leaves. The ſtalks riſe two ſeet high ; the leaves are rough; in the one they are jagged like turnip-leaves ; in the other they are long and entire. The flowers arc yellow ; the pods are turgid; angular, and have long beaks.</p><p>Muſtard, by its acrimony and pungency, ſtimulates the ſolids, and attenuates viſcid juices; and hence ſtands deſervedly recommended for exciting appetite, aſſiſting digeſtion, promoting the fluid ſecretions, and for the other purpoſes of the acrid plants called <hi rend="italic">antiſcorbutic</hi> It imparts its taſte and smell in perfection to aqueous liquors, and by distillation with water yields an essential oil of great acrimony. To rectified ſpirit its ſeeds give out very little either oſ their ſmell or taſte. Subjected to the preſs, they yield a conſiderable quantity of mild inſipid oil, which is as free from acrimony as that<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0516.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s04-0510"/>
of almonds. They are applied as an external ſtimulant to benumbed or paralytic limbs; to parts affected with fixed rheumatic pains ; and to the ſoles of the feet, in the low ſtage of acute diſeaſes, for raiſing the pulſe : in this intention, a mixture of equal parts of the powdered ſeeds and crumb of bread, with the addition ſometimes of a little bruiſed garlic, are made into a cataplaſm with a ſufficient quantity of vinegar.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
