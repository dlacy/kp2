The splenial is absent in chameleons; near the vanishing point in some of the Agamidae. The coronoid is always present, for the insertion of masseter muscles. In the pleurodont lizards the outer wall of the dentary forms a ledge, against the inner side of which are fixed thc teeth with</p><p>cementum.</p><p>The snakes’</p><p>skull shows many peculiarities, and most of the bones of the cranial capsule fuse together without sutures. The occipital condyle is triple, the lateral occipitals and the basioccipital taking equal share in its composition; the basioccipital is excluded from the foramen magnum ; frequently one common epiphysial pad covers this tripartite condyle. The supra-occipital is likewise excluded from the margin of the foramen magnum by the lateral occipitals. The basisphenoid is prolonged forwards into a long presphenoidal rostrum, on the upper surface of which the trabeculae cranii, which persist as cartilages, extend forwards to blend with the median ethmoidal cartilage. There are no ali- and no orbitosphenoids, their places being taken by downward extensions of the frontal bones, which descend to this sphenoidal rostrum and then turn inwards to meet together on the floor of the cranial cavity. There is consequently no interorbital septum. The parietals also descend laterally, but unite with the basisphenoid by suture. On the base of the skull we note various processes for the insertion of ventral cervicooccipital muscles, much used during the act of vigorous striking. Boidae have a long sphenoidal ridge and thick basipterygoid processes; others have one or more median knobs or crests, and the Viperidae have a very prominent and large ridge. The parietals fuse together into an unpaired mass whence arises mostly a strong median crest which projects a little beyond the occiput; there is no parietal or pineal foramen. There are paired frontaIs, postfrontals, prefrontaIs and</p><p>nasals; the latter</p><p>are said to coössify</p><p>in <hi rend="italic">Charina</hi>  only.</p><p>The position of the</p><p>prefrontals is vari-</p><p>abIe. In the boas,</p><p>for instance, they</p><p>meet, separating the</p><p>nasals from the</p><p>frontals; they are</p><p>in contact with the</p><p>nasals in the boas,</p><p>burrowing snakes</p><p>and· in <hi rend="italic">Xenopeltis,</hi></p><p>but more or Iess</p><p>widcIy separated</p><p>from them, and</p><p>often from each other, in the Colubridae and Viperidae. The premaxillary is single·, and only in Glauconiidae connected with the maxillaries; in the others it is but loosely connected with the ethmoidal end of the skull, for instance, with the turbinals, which are osseous and well developed in pythons.</p><p>The whole appendicular apparatus is most loosely attached to the skull, at least in the typical snakes, and since they do not chew their prey but only hook it in, so to speak, during the act of swallowing, the whole apparatus is as movable as possible.</p><p>The whole palatal apparatus shows many modifications, but the maxillaries, palatines and pterygoids always remain widely asunder, and from the mid-line. Some of the modifications, so far as they are used for taxonomic purposes, are mentioned in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Snakes: </hi><hi rend="italic">Classification.</hi>  In the majority of snakes the maxillaries form the borders of the mouth, and they are but loosely attached to the other bones, to their palatine processes, to the palatines, and with their posterior ends, by the ectopterygoids to the pterygoids. In the Viperidae the maxillaries are much shortened and articulate extensively with the prefrontals; they can be erected, or rather pushed forwards, by the ectopterygoids (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Snakes)</hi>  ; they are not connected with the palatines. The pterygoids diverge posteriorly and articulate loosely with the quadrates; in the original condition the articulation is near the distal end of the quadrate, <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi>  in Boidae, and the pterygoids may form an additional attachment with the mandibles; in the Viperidae the pterygoids are somewhat shortened and are attached to about the middle of the quadrate shafts; in the Amblycepha-lidae they are still shorter and do not reach these bones. The ectopterygoids are lost by the burrowing Typhlopidae and Glau-coniidae. The quadrate is always extremely movable; besides being in a most curious way connected with the outer end of the columellar rod (see below, <hi rend="italic">Ear),</hi>  it is suspended from the skull by the squamosal. The squamoso-quadrate connexion is very loose; that of the squamosal with the skull varies much. In the majority of snakes it slides quite freely upon the parietal; it is much longer than the quadrate in the boas, much shorter than the elongated and slender quadrate in most of the poisonous snakes. Lastly, in most of the ancient burrowing snakes, <hi rend="italic">e.g. Typhlops, Glaucoma, Ilysia</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">Uropeltis,</hi>  the squamosal has worked its way into the cranial wall so that the quadrate, itseIf also much shortened, rests directly upon the cranium.</p><p><hi rend="italic">The Vertebral Column.</hi></p><p>The vertebrae of all reptiles are gastrocentrous, that is to say, the centra or bodies of the vertebrae are formed by the originally paired, interventral cartilages, while the basiventrals are reduced, persisting either as so-called intercentra or wedge-bones, or as intervertebral pads, or disappearing altogether; the basidorsal elements form the neural arch. At the earlier stages of development the gastrocentrous vertebrae behave in the same way as in the Urodela, except that the interdorsal pair of elements is suppressed from the beginning (the very elements which in</p></body></text></TEI>
