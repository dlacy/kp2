<p><span class="font0">lieutenant-general in 1702. In 1694 he succeeded his father as 4th Earl Rivers. He served abroad in 1702 under Marlborough, who formed a high opinion of his military capacity&nbsp;and who recommended him for the command of a force for an&nbsp;invasion of France in 1706. The expedition was eventually&nbsp;diverted to Portugal, and Rivers, finding himself superseded&nbsp;before anything was accomplished, returned to England,&nbsp;where Marlborough procured for him a command in the cavalry.&nbsp;The favour shown him by Marlborough did not deter Rivers&nbsp;from paying court to the Tories when it became evident that the&nbsp;Whig ascendancy was waning, and his appointment as constable&nbsp;of the Tower in 1710 on the recommendation of Harley and&nbsp;without Marlborough’s knowledge was the first unmistakable&nbsp;intimation to the Whigs of their impending fall. Rivers now&nbsp;met with marked favour at court, being entrusted with a&nbsp;delicate mission to the elector of Hanover in 1710, which was&nbsp;followed by his appointment in 1711 as master-general of the&nbsp;ordnance, a post hitherto held by Marlborough himself. Swift,&nbsp;who was intimate with him, speaks of him as “ an arrant&nbsp;knave but the dean may have been disappointed at being&nbsp;unmentioned in Rivers’s will, for he made a fierce comment on&nbsp;the earfs bequests to his mistresses and his neglect of his&nbsp;friends. In June 1712 Rivers was promoted to the rank of&nbsp;general, and became commander-in-chief in England; he&nbsp;died a few weeks later, on the iSth of August 1712. He&nbsp;married in 1679 Penelope, daughter of Roger Downes, by whom&nbsp;he had a daughter Elizabeth, who married the 4th earl of&nbsp;Barrymore. He also left several illegitimate children, two of&nbsp;whom were by Anne, countess of Macclesfield. Rivers’s intrigue&nbsp;with Lady Macclesfield was the cause of that lady’s divorce&nbsp;from her husband in 1701. Richard Savage, the poet, claimed&nbsp;identity with Lady Macclesfield’s son by Lord Rivers, but&nbsp;though his story was accepted by Dr Johnson and was very&nbsp;generally believed, the evidence in its support is faulty in&nbsp;several respects. As Rivers left no legitimate son the earldom&nbsp;passed on his death to his cousin, John Savage, grandson of&nbsp;the 2nd earl, and a priest in the Roman Catholic Church, on&nbsp;whose death, about 1735, all the family titles became extinct.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RIVERS, RICHARD WOODVILLE, or </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Wydeville, Earl </span><span class="font0">(d. 1469), was a member of a family of small importance long&nbsp;settled at Grafton in Northamptonshire. His father, Richard&nbsp;Woodville, was a squire to Henry V., and afterwards the&nbsp;trusted servant of John of Bedford, in Whoseinteresthewas&nbsp;constable of the Tower during the troubles with Humphrey&nbsp;of Gloucester in 1425. The younger Richard Woodville was&nbsp;knighted by Henry VI. at Leicester in 1426. He served under&nbsp;Bedford in France, and after his master’s death married his&nbsp;widow Jacquetta of Luxemburg. The mesalliance caused&nbsp;some scandal, but Woodville enjoyed the king’s favour and&nbsp;continued to serve with honour in subordinate positions in&nbsp;France. He also distinguished himself at jousts in London&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Chronicles of London,</span><span class="font0"> 146, 148). On the 9th of May 1448&nbsp;Henry VI. created him Baron Rivers. His associations made&nbsp;him a strong Lancastrian. For some years he was lieutenant&nbsp;of Calais in Henry’s interests. In 1459, when stationed at&nbsp;Sandwich to prevent a Yorkist landing, he was surprised by&nbsp;Sir John Dinham, and taken prisoner with his son Anthony&nbsp;to the earl of Warwick at Calais. He was, however, released&nbsp;in time to fight for Henry VI. at Towton. Early in the reign&nbsp;of Edward IV. Rivers recognized that the Lancastrian cause&nbsp;was lost and made his peace with the new king. The marriage&nbsp;of his eldest daughter, Elizabeth, widow of Sir John Grey of&nbsp;Groby, to Edward on the ist of May 1464, secured the fortunes&nbsp;of his family. Rivers was appointed treasurer on the 4th of&nbsp;March 1466, and a little later created earl. Elizabeth found&nbsp;great alliances for her younger brothers and sisters, and the Wood -ville influence became all-powerful at court. The power of&nbsp;this new family was very distasteful to the old baronial party,&nbsp;and especially so to Warwick. Early in 1468 Rivers’s estates&nbsp;were plundered by Warwick’s partisans, and the open war of&nbsp;the following year was aimed to destroy the Woodvilles. After&nbsp;the king’s defeat at Edgecot, Rivers and his second son, John,&nbsp;were taken prisoners at Chepstow and executed at Kenilw<sup>r</sup>Orth&nbsp;on the 12th of August 1469. Rivers had a large family. His&nbsp;third son, Lionel (d. 1484), was bishop of Salisbury. All his&nbsp;daughters made great marriages: Catherine, the sixth, w<sup>r</sup>as&nbsp;wife of Henry Stafford, 2nd duke of Buckingham </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.}.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RIVERSIDE, a city of southern California, U.S.A., and the county-seat of Riverside county, situated on the Santa Ana&nbsp;river, in the San Bemardino valley. Pop. (1890) 4683; (1900)&nbsp;7973 (<sup>1</sup>S<sup>2</sup>S foreign-bom); (1910) 15,212. It is served by the&nbsp;Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe, the Southern Pacific and the San&nbsp;Pedro, Los Angeles &amp; Salt Lake railways. The city occupies a&nbsp;slope (about 800-1000 ft. above sea-level), rising toward the east&nbsp;is beautifully built and is a winter and health resort. In the&nbsp;Albert S. White Park there is a notable collection of cacti; and&nbsp;Huntington Park is high and rocky, is v/ell planted with trees&nbsp;and has a finely shaded automobile drive. Magnolia Avenue,&nbsp;bordered with pepper-trees, is 10 m. long and 130 ft. wide; and&nbsp;Victoria Avenue is similarly parked and lined with semi-tropical&nbsp;trees. Riverside is the seat of an important (non-reservation)&nbsp;boarding-school for Indians, Sherman Institute (1903), which in&nbsp;1908 had 699 students. Riverside is devoted to the cultivation&nbsp;of oranges, lemons and other subtropical fruits, and has a large&nbsp;trade in these products. It is in the centre of the finest orange&nbsp;district of the state; near Huntington Park is the state citrus&nbsp;experiment station (1906), with an experimental orchard of&nbsp;20 acres. The cultivation of navel oranges was first introduced&nbsp;from Brazil into the United States at Riverside in 1873; the two&nbsp;original trecs, protected by an iron railing, were still standing&nbsp;in 1909. The domestic water supply is obtained from artesian&nbsp;wells. In 1870 the site of the present city, then called Jumpa&nbsp;Rancho, the name of the old Spanish grant, was purchased by&nbsp;the Southern California Colony Association. The settlement&nbsp;was chartered in 1883 as a city, with limits including about&nbsp;56 sq. m. Riverside county was not organized until ten years&nbsp;later. From 1895 there were no saloons in the city.</span></p>
