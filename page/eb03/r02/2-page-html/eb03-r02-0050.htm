<p><span class="font0">This might Γerve to juſtify our ingenious author ; but he was determined to reſt every thing on experiment.&nbsp;He therefore made an experiment on the oſcillation of&nbsp;water in ſyphons, which we have repeated in the following form, which is affected by the ſame circumſtances, and is ſuſceptible of much greater preciſion,&nbsp;and of more extenſive and important application.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The two veſſels ABCD, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">abed</span><span class="font0"> (fig. 9.) were connected by the ſyphon E F G </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">gfe,</span><span class="font0"> which turned round .jn the ſhort tubes E and r, without allowing any water to eſcape 5 the axes of theſe tubes being in one&nbsp;ſtraight line. The veſſels were about 10 inches deep,&nbsp;and the branches FG, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">f</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">g</span><span class="font0"> of the ſyphon were about&nbsp;five feet long. The veſſels were ſet on two tables of&nbsp;equal height, and (the hole </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span class="font0"> being flopped) the veſſel&nbsp;ABCD, and the whole ſyphon, were filled with water,&nbsp;and water was poμred into the veſſel </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">abed</span><span class="font0"> till it ſtood&nbsp;at a certain height LM. The ſyphon was then turned&nbsp;into a horizontal poſition, and the plug drawn out of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and the time -carefully noted which the water employed in riſing to the level f!KI </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">h</span><span class="font0"> in both veſſels. The&nbsp;whole apparatus was now inclined, ſo that the water&nbsp;run back into ABCD. The ſyphon was now put in&nbsp;a vertical poſition, and the experiment was repeated.&nbsp;—No ſenſible or regular difference was obſerved in the&nbsp;time. Yet in this experiment the preſſure on the part&nbsp;Gg of the ſyphon was more than fix times greater than&nbsp;before. As it was thought that the friction on this&nbsp;ſmall part (only fix inches) was too ſmall a portion of&nbsp;the whole obſtruction, various additional obſtructions&nbsp;were put into this part of the ſyphon, and it was even&nbsp;lengthened to nine feet ; but ſtill no remarkable difference was obſerved. It was even thought that the&nbsp;times were leſs when the ſyphon was vertical.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Thus Mr De Buat’s opinion is completely juſtified ; and he may be allowed to aſſert, that the reſiſtance depends chiefly on the relation between the ſection and</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">its border ; and that —--<sup>wz</sup>*⅞- ſhould be a conſtant quan-√a</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">tity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To aſcertain this point was the object of the next ſe-ries of experiments ; to ſee whether this quantity was really conſtant, and, if not, to diſcover the law of its&nbsp;variation, and the phyſical circumſtances which accompanied the variations, and may therefore be conſidered as their cauſes. A careful compariſon of a very&nbsp;great number of experiments, made with the ſame Hope,&nbsp;and with very different channels and velocities, ſhowed&nbsp;that </span><span class="font1">∖</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">f </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">m g</span><span class="font0"> did not follow the proportion of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">V d,</span><span class="font0"> nor&nbsp;of any power of 5/ J. This quantity </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ſmg</span><span class="font0"> increaſed&nbsp;by ſmaller degrees in proportion as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">f d</span><span class="font0"> was greater.&nbsp;In very great beds  was nearly proportional to&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ſſ</span><span class="font0"> but in ſmaller channels, the velocities diminiſhed&nbsp;much more than </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">\ſ </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">d</span><span class="font0"> did. Caſting about for ſome way&nbsp;of accommodation, Mr Buat conſidered, that ſome approximation at leaſt would be had by taking off from&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">d</span><span class="font0"> ſome conſtant ſmall quantity. This is evident :&nbsp;For ſuch a diminution will have but a trifling effect&nbsp;when ¼∕ </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">d</span><span class="font0"> is great, and its effect will increaſe rapidly&nbsp;when </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">\ſ d</span><span class="font0"> is very ſmall. He therefore tried various&nbsp;values for this ſubtraction, and compared the reſults&nbsp;with the former experiments ; and he found, that if in</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">every caſe √ </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">d</span><span class="font0"> be diminiſhed by oneſtenth of an inch, the calculated diſcharges would agree very exactly with&nbsp;the experiment. Therefore, inſtead of √ </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">d,</span><span class="font0"> he makes&nbsp;uſe of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">λ∕ d —</span><span class="font0"> O,ι, and finds this quantity always proportional to  or finds that <sup>l</sup></span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:line-through;">&quot;∕<sup>m</sup>Jl.</span><span class="font0">--is a con-</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sup>i</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;√J-o,i</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ftant quantity, or very nearly ſo. It varied from 297 to 287 in all fictions from that of a very ſmall pipe to&nbsp;that of a little canal. In the large fictions of canals&nbsp;and rivers it diminiſhed ſtill more, but never was leſs&nbsp;than 2y6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This reſult is very agreeable to the moſt diſtinct notions that we can form of the mutual actions of the water and its bed. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">We</span><span class="font0"> fie, that when the motion of&nbsp;water is obſtructed by a ſolid body, which deflects the&nbsp;paſſing filaments, the diſturbance does not extend to&nbsp;any conſiderable diſtance on the two ſides of the body.&nbsp;In like manner, the ſmall diſturbances, and imperceptible curvilineal motions, which are occaſioned by the&nbsp;infiniteſimal inequalities of the channel, muſt extend to&nbsp;a very ſmall diſtance indeed from the ſides and bottom&nbsp;of the channel. We know, too, that the mutual adheſion or attraction of water for the ſolid bodies which&nbsp;are moiſtened by it, extends to a very ſmall diſtance ;&nbsp;which is probably the ſame, or nearly ſo, in all cafis.&nbsp;Mr Buat obſerved, that a ſurface of 23 ſquare inches,&nbsp;applied to the ſurface of ſtagnant water, lifted 1601&nbsp;grains ; another of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">5</span><span class="font0">4 ſquare inches lifted 365 : this was&nbsp;at the rate of 65 grains per inch nearly, making a column of about one-ſixth of an inch high. Now this effect is very much analogous to a real contraction of the&nbsp;capacity of the channel. The water may be conceived&nbsp;as nearly ſtagnant to this ſmall diſtance from the border&nbsp;of the fiction. Or, to ſpeak more accurately, the diminution of the progreſſive velocity occaſioned by the&nbsp;friction and adheſion of the ſides, decreaſes very rapidly&nbsp;as we recede from the ſides, and ceaſes to be ſenſible at&nbsp;a very ſmall diſtance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The writer of this article verified this by a very ſimple and inſtructive experiment. He was. making experiments&nbsp;on the production of vortices, in the manner ſuggeſted by&nbsp;SirlſaacNewton, by whirling a very accurate andſmooth-ly poliſhed cylinder in water; and he found that the rapid&nbsp;motion of the ſurrounding water was confined to an exceeding ſmall diſtance from the cylinder, and it was not&nbsp;till after many revolutions that it was ſenſible even at&nbsp;the diſtance of half an inch. We may, by the way,&nbsp;ſuggeſt this as the beſt form of experiments for examining the reſiſtances of pipes. The motion excited by&nbsp;the whirling cylinder in the ſtagnant water is equal and&nbsp;oppoſite to the motion loft by water paſſing along a&nbsp;ſurface equal to that of the cylinder with the ſame velocity. Be this as it may, we are juſtified in conſidering,&nbsp;with Mr Buat, the ſection of the ſtream as thus diminiſhed by cutting off a narrow border all round the&nbsp;touching parts, and ſuppoſing that the motion and diſcharge is the ſame as if the root of the mean depth of&nbsp;the ſection were diminiſhed by a ſmall quantity, nearly&nbsp;conſtant. We ſee, too, that the effect of this muſt be&nbsp;infinſible in great canals and rivers ; ſo that, fortunately, its quantity is beſt aſcertained by experiments made&nbsp;with ſmall pipes. This is attended with another con«&nbsp;veniency, in the opinion of Mr Buat, namely, that the</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
