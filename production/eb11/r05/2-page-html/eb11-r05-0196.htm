<p><span class="font0">the peasantry and the labouring classes. At the same time its members looked for a regeneration of the Church, and the&nbsp;rescue of both the Church and Ireland from the trammels&nbsp;inherited from the Whig predominance of the 18th century.&nbsp;Manners made an extensive tour of inspection in the industrial&nbsp;parts of N. England, in the course of which he and his&nbsp;friend Smythe expounded their views with a brilliancy which&nbsp;frequently extorted compliments from the leaders of the&nbsp;Manchester school. In 1843 be supported Lord Grey’s motion&nbsp;for an inquiry into the condition of England, the serious disaffection of the working classes of the north being a subject to&nbsp;which he was constantly drawing the attention of parliament.&nbsp;Among other measures that he urged were the disestablishment of the Irish Church, the modification of the Mortmain&nbsp;Acts, and the resumption of regular diplomatic relations with&nbsp;the Vatican. In the same year he issued in pamphlet form&nbsp;a strong </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Plea for National Holydays.</span><span class="font0"> In 1844 Lord John&nbsp;vigorously supported the Ten-hours Bill, which, though&nbsp;strongly opposed by Bright, Cobden, and other members of&nbsp;the Manchester school, was ultimately passed in May 1847.&nbsp;In October during that year he took part in, and spoke at,&nbsp;the brilliant </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">soirée</span><span class="font0"> held at the Manchester Athenaeum under&nbsp;the presidency of Disraeli. A few days later he and his friends&nbsp;attended a festival at Bingley, in Yorkshire, to celebrate the&nbsp;allotment of land for gardens to working men, a step which,&nbsp;through the agency of his father, he had done a great deal to&nbsp;further. About the same time Smythe dedicated to him his&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Historic Fancies</span><span class="font0"> as to “ the Sir Philip Sidney of our generation.”&nbsp;Manners figured as Lord Henry Sidney in Disraeli’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Coningsby,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and not a few of his ideas are represented as those of Egremont&nbsp;in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sybil</span><span class="font0"> and Waldershare in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Endymion.</span><span class="font0"> But the disruption of&nbsp;the Young England party was already impending. Lord&nbsp;John’s support to Peel’s decision to increase the Maynooth&nbsp;grant in 1845 led to a difference with Disraeli. Divergences&nbsp;of opinion with regard to Newman’s secession from the English&nbsp;Church produced further defections in the ranks, and the&nbsp;rupture was completed by Smythe acquiescing in Peel’s conversion to Free Trade. Lord John produced another vòlume&nbsp;of verse, known as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">English Ballads,</span><span class="font0"> chiefly patriotic and&nbsp;historical, in 1850. In the same year he wrote the letterpress&nbsp;for an atlas of coloured views by J. C. Schetky; and he published&nbsp;several pamphlets, one on the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Church of England in the Colonies,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">in 1851. During the three short administrations of Lord&nbsp;Derby (1851, 1858, and 1866) he sat in the cabinet as first&nbsp;commissioner of the office of works. On the return of the&nbsp;Conservatives to power in 1874 he became postmaster-general&nbsp;in Disraeli’s administration, and was made G.C.B. on his&nbsp;retirement in 1880. He was again postmaster-general in&nbsp;Lord Salisbury’s administration, 1885-86, and was head of&nbsp;the department when sixpenny telegrams were introduced.&nbsp;Finally, in the Conservative government of 1886-92 he was&nbsp;chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster. He had succeeded to&nbsp;the dukedom of Rutland in March 1888, upon the death of his&nbsp;elder brother. He died on the 4th of August 1906 at Belvoir&nbsp;Castle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">He was succeeded as 8th duke by his eldest son (b. 1852), who had been Conservative M.P. for the Melton division&nbsp;of Leicestershire from 1888 to 1895; and whose wife, as&nbsp;marchioness of Granby, became well known as a clever artist,&nbsp;a volume of her </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Portraits</span><span class="font0"> of various distinguished men and&nbsp;women being published in 1899.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RUTLAND, a midland county of England, bounded N. and</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">E. by Lincolnshire, N. and W. by Leicestershire, and S.E. by&nbsp;Northamptonshire. It is the smallest county in England,&nbsp;having an area of 152 sq. m. The surface is pleasantly undulating, ridges of high ground running E. and W., separated&nbsp;by rich valleys. The principal of these valleys is the vale of&nbsp;Catmose, in the Oakham district, to the N. of which rises a&nbsp;tableland commanding wide views into Leicestershire. The&nbsp;vale maintains its reputation for richness of soil assigned to&nbsp;it by Drayton in his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Poly-Olbion.</span><span class="font0"> This, the N.W. part of the&nbsp;county, is also the district of the well-known Cottesmore hunt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The royal forest of Lyfield, or Leafield, which included the greater part of the hundreds of Oakham and Martinsley, once&nbsp;extended over the county between Oakham and Uppingham,&nbsp;and patches of it still exist. To the S. of Uppingham it was&nbsp;known as Beaumont Chase. The river Welland, flowing N E.,&nbsp;forms the S.E. boundary of Rutland with Northamptonshire.&nbsp;The Gwash, or Wash, which rises in Leicestershire, flows eastward through the centre of the county/ and just beyond its&nbsp;borders in Lincolnshire joins the Welland The Chater, also&nbsp;rising in Leicestershire and flowing E., enters the Welland&nbsp;about 2 m. from Stamford. The Eye, forming part of the&nbsp;S.W. boundary, is also tributary to the Welland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Geology.</span><span class="font0">—The county consists entirely of Jurassic formations, viz. of Liassic and Oolitic strata—the harder beds, chiefly limestone&nbsp;containing iron, forming the hills and escarpments, and the clay-beds the slopes of the valleys. The oldest rocks are those belonging&nbsp;to the Lower Lias in the N.W. The bottom of the vale of Catmose&nbsp;is formed of marlstone rock belonging to the Middle Lias, and its&nbsp;sides are composed of long slopes of Upper Lias clay. The Upper&nbsp;Lias also covers a large area in the W. of the county, and is worked&nbsp;for bricks at Luffenham and Seaton. The lowest of the Oolitic&nbsp;formations is the Northampton sand, which has yielded iron ore&nbsp;at Manton and Cottesmore. The Lincolnshire Oolitic limestone&nbsp;prevails in the E. of the county N. of Stamford. It is largely&nbsp;quarried for building purposes, the quarries at Ketton, Clipsham, and&nbsp;Casterton being famous beyond the boundaries of the county.&nbsp;The Great Oolite and Estuarine beds prevail towards the S.E.&nbsp;Glacial deposits of boulder, clay, sand and gravel, mask the older&nbsp;strata in many places.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Industries.—</span><span class="font0">In the E. and S.E. districts the soil is light and shallow. In the other districts it consists chiefly of a tenacious but&nbsp;fertile loam, and in the vale of Catmose the soil is either clay or&nbsp;loam, or a mixture of the two. The prevailing redness, which&nbsp;colours even the streams, is owing to the ferruginous limestone&nbsp;carried down from.the slopes of the hills. The name of the county&nbsp;is by some authorities derived from this characteristic of the soil,&nbsp;but the explanation is doubtful. The E. of the county is chiefly&nbsp;under tillage and the W. in grass. Nearly nine-tenths of the total&nbsp;area (a high proportion) is under cultivation, wheat being by far the&nbsp;most important grain crop. Turnips and swedes occupy the greater&nbsp;part of the area under green crops. The rearing of sheep (Leicesters&nbsp;and South Downs) and cattle (Shorthorns) occupies the chief attention of the farmer. Large quantities of cheese are manufactured&nbsp;and sold as Stilton. Agriculture is practically the only industry&nbsp;of importance, but there is some quarrying and boot-making.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The main line of the Great Northern railway intersects the N.E. corner, and branches of that system, of the London &amp; North-Western, and of the Midland railways, serve the remainder of the&nbsp;county. •</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Population and Administration.—</span><span class="font0">The. area of the ancient and administrative county is 97,273 acres, with a population in 1891 of&nbsp;<sup>2O</sup>&gt;659, and in 1901 of 19,709. The county contains five hundreds.&nbsp;There are no municipal boroughs or urban districts. The county town&nbsp;is Oakham (pop. 3294), and other towns are Uppingham (2588) and&nbsp;Ketton (1041). The county is in the midland circuit, and assizes&nbsp;are held at Oakham. It has one court of quarter sessions, but is&nbsp;not divided for petty-sessional purposes. There are 58 civil parishes.&nbsp;The county is in the diocese of Peterborough, and contains 42&nbsp;ecclesiastical parishes or districts, wholly or in part. It returns one&nbsp;member to parliament.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History.—</span><span class="font0">The district which is now Rutland was probably occupied by a tribe of Middle Angles in the 6th or 7th century,&nbsp;and was subsequently absorbed in the kingdom of Mercia.&nbsp;Although mentioned by name in the will of Edward the Confessor, who bequeathed it to his queen Edith for life with&nbsp;remainder to Westminster Abbey, Rutland did not rank as a&nbsp;county at the time of the Domesday Survey, in which the term&nbsp;Rutland is only applied to that portion assessed under Nottinghamshire, while the S.E. portion of the modern county is surveyed&nbsp;under Northamptonshire, where it appears as the wapentake of&nbsp;Wiceslea. Rutland is first mentioned as a distinct county under&nbsp;the administration of a separate sheriff in the pipe roll of 1159,&nbsp;but as late as the 14th century it is designated <sup>u</sup> Rutland&nbsp;Soke ” in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Vision of Piers Plowman,</span><span class="font0"> and the curious&nbsp;connexion with Nottinghamshire, a county which does not&nbsp;adjoin it at any point, was maintained up to the reign of Henry&nbsp;III., when the sheriff of Nottingham was by statute appointed&nbsp;also escheator in Rutland. Of the five modern hundreds of&nbsp;Rutland, Alstoe and Martinsley appear in the Domesday Survey&nbsp;of Nottinghamshire as wapentakes, Martinsley at that date&nbsp;including the modern hundred of Oakham Soke; East hundred</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
