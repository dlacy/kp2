<p><span class="font0">but for this no good evidence has been adduced. In 407 he returned to Rome ; and the year after, that city being&nbsp;threatened by Alaric, he retired to Sicily, where he died in&nbsp;410.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RUGBY, a market-town of the county of Warwick, in the hundred of Knightlow, eighty-four miles from London.&nbsp;It is situated on the Grand Junction Canal, and has a good&nbsp;market on Saturday. The free-school here is celebrated,&nbsp;and has educated many youths of the first families of the&nbsp;kingdom.

<p><span class="font0">RUGENWALD, a city of Prussia, in the government of Stralsund, and the capital of the circle of Schlawe-Pollnow. It is situated on the river Wipper, about a mile distant&nbsp;from the Baltic Sea. It is a fortified place, containing 460&nbsp;houses, with 4100 inhabitants, who have some foreign trade,&nbsp;some ship-building, and manufactures of sailcloth and cordage, with many distilleries and breweries.

<p><span class="font0">RUHNKENIUS, David, a classical critic of great eminence, was born at Stolpen, in Prussian Pomerania, in the year 1723. Of the early part of his studies little is known,&nbsp;but it appears that he was some time at Schlaff, from which&nbsp;he removed to Königsberg, where he met with the celebrated Kant, whose system has so much engaged the attention of Europe. He afterwards repaired to Göttingen&nbsp;to attend the lectures of Gesner, and to enlarge his knowledge of the Greek language. Some time after this period&nbsp;he formed an acquaintance with Ritter and Berger, whilst&nbsp;he resided at Wittemberg, where he continued about two&nbsp;years. His earliest production was a disputation </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">De Galla&nbsp;Placidia Augusta,</span><span class="font0"> daughter of Theodosius, and the sister of&nbsp;Arcadius and Honorius. Under Berger he studied Roman&nbsp;antiquities and eloquence ; under Ritter, jurisprudence and&nbsp;history. He relinquished the study of divinity, for which&nbsp;he was at first designed, and prevailed with his parents to&nbsp;allow him to transfer his residence to Leyden, where he&nbsp;arrived with recommendations to many of the learned. He&nbsp;pursued his studies with avidity and zeal, and accompanied&nbsp;Alberti in his visit to the Spa in the year 1750. Hemsterhuis wished to attach him to Holland, urging him to persevere in the study of the law, as affording an additional chance&nbsp;of employment. This advice he thought proper to follow,&nbsp;and published a translation of some works of Theodorus,&nbsp;Stephanus, and other Greek civilians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the year 1755 he went to Paris, where Capperonnier, who was at that time keeper of the king’s library, received&nbsp;him kindly. He now formed an acquaintance with Dr&nbsp;Musgrave and Mr Tyrwhitt, who were there for the purpose of examining the manuscripts of Euripides. He had&nbsp;also formed the resolution of going to Spain; but Hemsterhuis recalled him, as he needed his assistance as lecturer in&nbsp;the Greek tongue. In 1755, Ruhnkenius took possession&nbsp;of his office, and read an excellent discourse </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">De Gracia&nbsp;Artium et Doctrinarum Inventrice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">About this time he was useful to Ernesti, in his edition of Callimachus; and, in 1761, he succeeded Oudendorp as&nbsp;professor of history and of eloquence, delivering an inaugural oration </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">De Doctore Umbratico.</span><span class="font0"> About a year after this&nbsp;event, Ruhnkenius was offered the chair of Gesner in the&nbsp;university of Göttingen. This offer he however declined;&nbsp;but, on his recommendation, the office was very worthily&nbsp;bestowed upon Heyne.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1764 he married an Italian lady, who, about six years afterwards lost both her speech and sight by a stroke of&nbsp;apoplexy. She had two daughters, one of whom was afterwards blind. The desire of Ruhnkenius to do Ernesti a&nbsp;favour, made him turn his attention to the Memorabilia of&nbsp;Xenophon ; and he was led to examine with particular attention the treatise of Longinus on the Sublime. Having</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">risen superior to his domestic misfortunes about the year 1772, he pursued his new edition of Velleius Paterculus, and he prepared a second edition of his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Epistola Critica,</span><span class="font0"> and a collection of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Scholia</span><span class="font0"> on Plato. In the year&nbsp;1766, he published a valuable tract </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">De Vita et Scriptis&nbsp;Longini,</span><span class="font0"> in the form of an academical dissertation, to which&nbsp;he prefixed the name of one of his pupils. His Velleius&nbsp;Paterculus appeared in 1779, and in 1780 Homer’s reputed&nbsp;hymn to Ceres. In 1786, he published the first part of&nbsp;Apuleius, which had been prepared by Oudendorp, and a&nbsp;new edition of his own Timæus in 1789; and at the same&nbsp;time he collected and published the works of Muretus, in&nbsp;five volumes 8vo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Both the body and mind of Ruhnkenius were much weakened in consequence of the loss of friends, an attack of the gout, and the misfortunes of the Batavian republic ; but he&nbsp;was in some measure relieved by the satisfaction he felt at&nbsp;the dedication of Homer by Wolf, although he was not of&nbsp;that writer’s opinion that the works of Homer were written&nbsp;by different authors. He sunk into a kind of stupor on&nbsp;the 14th of May 1798, which in two days put a period to&nbsp;his existence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">His knowledge and learning were unquestionably immense ; and he was allowed to be lively, cheerful, and gay, even to an extreme. Many posthumous honours were conferred upon him, and a pension settled on his unfortunate&nbsp;widow. When Whyttenbach took possession of Ruhnkenius’s chair, he delivered a discourse on the early age of&nbsp;Ruhnkenius, which he proposed as an example to the Batavian youth who made the belles lettres their study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RUIB ISLE, a small island in the Eastern Seas, about six leagues from Waygoo, and surrounded by a multitude of&nbsp;smaller islands, with very deep waters between them. Long.&nbsp;129. 55. E. Lat. 0. N.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RUM, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a species of brandy or vinous spirits, which is distilled from sugar-canes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rum, according to Dr Shaw, differs from simple sugar-spirit, in that it contains more of the natural flavour or essential oil of the sugar-cane; a great deal of raw juice and parts of the cane itself being usually fermented in the liquor or solution of which the rum is prepared.</span></p>
