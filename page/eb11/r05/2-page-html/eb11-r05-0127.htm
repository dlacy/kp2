<p><span class="font0">college of the government, in which, like the others, they form a separate </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">curia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the college itself the voting—secret and by ballot throughout—is by majority; and since this majority consists, under the actual system, of very conservative elements (the landottaiers&nbsp;and urban delegates having jths of the votes), the progressive elements—however much they might preponderate in the&nbsp;country—would have no chance of representation at all save&nbsp;for the curious provision that one member at least in each&nbsp;government must be chosen from each of the five classes&nbsp;represented in the college. For example, were there no reactionary peasant among the delegates, a reactionary majority&nbsp;might be forced to return a Social Democrat to the Duma. As&nbsp;it is, though a fixed </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">minimum of</span><span class="font0"> peasant delegates </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">must</span><span class="font0"> be&nbsp;returned, they by no means probably represent the opinion of&nbsp;the peasantry. That in the Duma any Radical elements&nbsp;survive at all is mainly due to the peculiar franchise enjoyed by&nbsp;the seven largest towns—St Petersburg, Moscow, Kiev, Odessa,&nbsp;Riga and the Polish cities of Warsaw and Lodz. These elect&nbsp;their delegates to the Duma direct, and though their votes are&nbsp;divided into two </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">curias</span><span class="font0"> (on the basis of taxable property) in&nbsp;such a'way as to give the advantage to wealth, each returning the&nbsp;same number of delegates, the democratic colleges can at least&nbsp;return members of their own complexion.@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The competence of the Russian parliament@@<sup>2</sup> thus constituted is strictly limited. It shares with the emperor the legislative&nbsp;power, including the discussion and sanctioning of&nbsp;the budget. But, so far as the parliament is concerned,&nbsp;this power is subject to numerous and important&nbsp;exceptions. All measures, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font0"> dealing with the organization&nbsp;of the army .and navy are outside its competence; these are&nbsp;no longer called <sup>a</sup> laws ” but “ ordinary administrative rules.”&nbsp;Moreover, the procedure of the Houses practically places the&nbsp;control of legislation in the hands of ministers. Any member&nbsp;may bring in a <sup>a</sup> project of law,” but it has to be submitted to&nbsp;the minister of the department concerned, who is allowed a&nbsp;month to consider it, and himself prepares the final draft laid&nbsp;on the table of the House. Amendments, however, may be&nbsp;and have been carried against the government. Ministers are&nbsp;responsible, moreover, not to parliament but to the emperor.&nbsp;They may be interpellated, but only on the legality, not the&nbsp;policy, of their acts. In the words of M. Stolypin, there is no&nbsp;intention of converting the ministerial bench into a prisoners'&nbsp;dock. If by a two-thirds majority the action of a minister&nbsp;be arraigned, the president of the Imperial Council lays&nbsp;the case before the emperor, who decides. The powers of the&nbsp;parliament over the budget are even more limited, though not&nbsp;altogether illusory. No legislation by means of the budget&nbsp;is allowed, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font0"> no alteration may be made in credits necessary&nbsp;for carrying out a law. This deprives parliament of control&nbsp;over the administrative departments, all the ministries being&nbsp;• thus “ armour-plated ”—to use the cant phrase current in&nbsp;Russia—except that of ways and communications (railways).&nbsp;The sum of 700,000,000 roubles per annum is thus excepted&nbsp;from the control of the chambers. Other exceptions are the&nbsp;“ Institutions of the Empress Marie,” which absorb, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">inter alia,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">the duties on playing-cards and the taxes on places of public&nbsp;entertainment; the imperial civil list, so far as this does not&nbsp;exceed the sum fixed in 1906 (16,359,595 roubles!); the expenses of the two imperial chanceries, 10,000,000 roubles per&nbsp;annum, which constitute in effect a secret service fund. Altogether, half the annual expenditure of the country is outside&nbsp;the control of parliament. Nor is this all. If the budget be not&nbsp;sanctioned by the emperor, that of the previous year remains in&nbsp;force, and the government has power, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">motu proprio,to</span><span class="font0"> impose the&nbsp;extra taxes necessary to carry out new laws. In certain circumstances, too, the emperor reserves the right to raise fresh loans.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@1 </sup>Thus M. Guchkov, leader of the Octobrists, and M. Miliukov, leader of the cadets, were both returned by the second </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">curia</span><span class="font0"> of&nbsp;St Petersburg to the third Duma.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@2 </sup>Strictly speaking, the title is inapplicable, there being no collective official name for the two chambers. The word parliament may, however, be used as a convenient term, failing a better.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font0">Further, the emperor has the power to issue ordinances having the force of law, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font0"> under extraordinary circumstances&nbsp;when the Duma is not sitting. These ordinances must, however, be of a temporary nature, must not infringe the fundamental laws or statutes passed by the two chambers, or change&nbsp;the electoral system, and must be laid upon the table of the&nbsp;Duma at the first opportunity. Since, however, the emperor&nbsp;has the-power of proroguing or dissolving the Duma as often&nbsp;as he pleases, it is clear that these temporary ordinances might&nbsp;in effect be made permanent. Finally, the emperor has the&nbsp;right to proclaim anywhere and at any time a state of siege.&nbsp;In this way the fundamental laws were suspended not only in&nbsp;Poland but in St Petersburg and other parts of the empire&nbsp;during the greater part of the four years succeeding the grant&nbsp;of the constitution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It should be noted, none the less, that the third Duma succeeded in establishing its position, and that in view of its useful activities even the extreme Right came to realize that there&nbsp;could be no return to the old undisguised absolutist régime&nbsp;(see </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History,</span><span class="font0"> below, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ad fin.)..</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">By the law of the 18th of October (November 1) 1905, to assist the emperor in the supreme administration a Council&nbsp;of Ministers </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Sovyet Ministrw)</span><span class="font0"> created, under a&nbsp;minister president, the first appearance of a prime&nbsp;minister in Russia. This council consists of all the&nbsp;ministers and of the heads of the principal administrations.&nbsp;The ministries are as follows: (1) of the Imperial Court,&nbsp;to which the administration of the apanages, the chapter of&nbsp;the imperial orders, the imperial palaces and theatres, and&nbsp;the Academy of Fine Arts are subordinated; (2) Foreign&nbsp;Affairs; (3) War and Marine; (4) Finance; (5) Commerce and&nbsp;Industry (created in 1905); (6) Interior (including police,&nbsp;health, censorship and press, posts and telegraphs, foreign&nbsp;religions, statistics); (7) Agriculture; (8) Ways and Communications; (9) Justice; (10) Public Instruction. Dependent&nbsp;on the Council of Ministers are two other councils: the Holy&nbsp;Synod and the Senate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Holy Synod (established in 1721) is the supreme organ of government of the Orthodox Church in Russia. It is&nbsp;presided over by a lay procurator, representing the&nbsp;emperor, and consists, for the rest, of the three&nbsp;metropolitans of Moscow, St Petersburg and Kiev,&nbsp;the archbishop of Georgia, and a number of bishops sitting&nbsp;in rotation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Senate </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Pravitelstvuyushchî Sénat, i.e.</span><span class="font0"> directing or governing senate), originally established by Peter the Great,&nbsp;consists of members nominated by the emperor. Its&nbsp;functions, which are exceedingly various, are carried&nbsp;out by the different departments into which it is&nbsp;divided. It is the supreme court of cassation (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Judicial&nbsp;System,</span><span class="font0"> below); an audit office, a high court of justice for all&nbsp;political offences; one of its departments fulfils the functions&nbsp;of a heralds' college. It also has supreme jurisdiction in all&nbsp;disputes arising out of the administration of the empire, notably&nbsp;differences between the representatives oflhe central power and&nbsp;the elected organs of local self-government. Lastly, it examines&nbsp;into registers and promulgates new laws, a function which, in&nbsp;theory, gives it a power, akin to that of the Supreme Court of&nbsp;the United States, of rejecting measures not in accordance&nbsp;with the fundamental laws.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For purposes of provincial administration Russia is divided into 78 governments </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(guberniya),</span><span class="font0"> 18 provinces </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(oblast)</span><span class="font0"> and&nbsp;1 district </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(okrug).</span><span class="font0"> Of these 11 governments, 17&nbsp;provinces and 1 district (Sakhalin) belong to Asiatic&nbsp;Russia. Of the rest 8 governments are in Finland,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">10 in Poland. European Russia thus embraces 59 governments and 1 province (that of the Don). The&nbsp;Don province is under the direct jurisdiction of the ministry&nbsp;of war; the rest have each a governor and deputy-governor,&nbsp;the latter presiding over the administrative council^ In&nbsp;addition there are governors-general, generally placed over&nbsp;several governments and armed with more extensive powers,</span></p>
