<p><label>ROLLAND, JOHN</label>
(fl. 1560), Scottish poet, appears to have been a priest of the diocese of Glasgow, and to have been known in Dalkeith in 1555. He is the author of two poems, the <hi rend="italic">Court of Venus</hi> and a translation of the <hi rend="italic">Seven Sages.</hi> The former, which was printed by John Ros in 1575, may have been written before 1560. The latter was translated from a Scots prose version at the suggestion of an aunt (“ ane proper wenche ”), who had found his treatment of the courtly allegory involved and uninteresting.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">Court of Venus</hi> was edited by Walter Gregor for the S.T.S. in 1884. See W. A. Craigie’s long list of corrections of that edition in the <hi rend="italic">Modern Language Quarterly</hi> (March 1898). The <hi rend="italic">Seven Sages</hi> was printed in 1578, and frequently during the earlier decades of the 17th century. It was reprinted by David Laing for the Banna-tyne Club (1837). Sibbald, in his <hi rend="italic">Chronicle OfScottish Poetry</hi> (iii. 287), hinted that Rqlland may be the author of the <hi rend="italic">Thrie Priestis of Peblis.</hi> There is not a scrap of evidence in support of this; and there are many strong reasons against the ascription.</p>
