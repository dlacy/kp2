<p><span class="font2">All the succeeding herpetologists adopted either OppeFs or Cuvier’s view as to the number of orders of reptiles, or as to&nbsp;the position Batraehians ought to take in their relation&nbsp;to reptiles proper, with the single exception of D. </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">de&nbsp;Blainville.</span><span class="font2"> He divided the “ oviparous subtype ”&nbsp;of Vertebrates into four classes, Birds, Reptiles, Amphibians&nbsp;and Fishes,@@<sup>1</sup> a modification of the system which is all the&nbsp;more significant as he designates the reptiles “ </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Squammiftres&nbsp;Ornithoides, écailleux,”</span><span class="font2"> and the amphibians “ </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Nudipelliftres,&nbsp;Ichthyoides nusP</span><span class="font2"> In these terms we perceive clear indications of&nbsp;the relations which exist to the class of birds on the one hand, and&nbsp;to that of fishes on the other; but, unfortunately, Blainville&nbsp;himself did not follow up the ideas thus expressed, and abandoned</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">even the terms in a later edition of his systematic tables.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The direct or indirect influence of the work of French anatomists manifested itself in the systems of the other herpetologists of this period. The Crocodiles, especially, which hitherto&nbsp;(strange to say, even in Cuvier’s classification) had been placed&nbsp;as one of the families of Saurians, now commence to be separated&nbsp;from them. </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Merrem </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Versuch eines Systems der&nbsp;Amphibien,</span><span class="font2"> Marburg, 1820, 8vo) distinguishes two</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">classes of “ Amphibians,” Pholidota and Batrachia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Pholidota (or Reptiles) are divided into three orders, distinguished chiefly by osteological and Splanchnological characters:—</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Testudinata.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Loricata</span><span class="font1"> ( = Crocodiles).</span></p>

The&nbsp;greater part of his work is occupied with a synopsis of all the&nbsp;species of Reptiles known, each being shortly characterized by a&nbsp;diagnosis; but, as only a small proportion (about one hundred and&nbsp;seventy) were known to him from autopsy, this synopsis has all the&nbsp;faults of a compilation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Latreille,</span><span class="font2"> who commenced the study of reptiles as early as 1801, had kept pace with the progress of science when he&nbsp;published, in 1825, his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Familles naturelles du règne&nbsp;animal</span><span class="font2"> (Paris, 1825, Svo). He separated the Batra-ehians as a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">class</span><span class="font2"> from the Reptiles, and the latter he divides into&nbsp;two sections only, Cataphracta and Squamosa—in the former&nbsp;Crocodiles being associated with the Chelonians. He bases this&nbsp;view on the development of a carapace in both, on the structure&nbsp;of the feet, on the fixed quadrate bone, on the single organ of&nbsp;copulation. None of the succeeding herpetologists adopted a&nbsp;combination founded on such important characters&nbsp;except J. E. </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Gray,</span><span class="font2"> who, however, destroyed Latreille’s&nbsp;idea of Cataphracta by adding the Amphisbaenians@@<sup>2</sup> as a third</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A mass of new materials now began to accumulate from all parts of the world in European museums. Among others, Spix&nbsp;had brought from Brazil a rich spoil to the Munich Museum,&nbsp;and the. Bavarian Academy charged </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Joh. Wagler&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">to prepare a general system of reptiles and batra-chians. His work,@@<sup>3</sup> the result of ten years’ labour, is a simple but&nbsp;lasting monument to a young naturalist,@@<sup>4</sup> who, endowed with&nbsp;an ardent imagination, only too frequently misinterpreted the&nbsp;evidence of facts, or forced it into the service of preconceived&nbsp;ideas. Cuvier had drawn attention to certain resemblances in</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2">some parts of the osseous structure of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ichthyosaurus</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ptero-dactylus</span><span class="font2"> to dolphins, birds, crocodiles, &amp;c. Wagler, seizing upon such analogical resemblances, separated those extinct&nbsp;Saurians from the class of Reptiles, and formed of them and the&nbsp;Monotremes a distinct class of Vertebrates, intermediate between&nbsp;mammals and birds, which he called Gryphi. We must admit&nbsp;that he made free use of his imagination by defining his class of&nbsp;Gryphi as “ vertebrates with lungs lying free in the pectoral&nbsp;cavity; oviparous development of the embryo (within or)&nbsp;without thc parent; the young fed (or suckled?) by the parents.”&nbsp;By the last character this Waglcrian class is distinguished from&nbsp;the reptiles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Reptiles (in which Wagler includes Batrachians) arc divided into eight orders: Testudines, Crocodili, Laeertae, Serpentes,&nbsp;Afigues, Caeciliae, Ranae and Iehthyodi. He has great merit in&nbsp;having employed, for the subdivision of the families of lizards,&nbsp;the structure of the tongue and thc mode of insertion of the teeth&nbsp;in the jaws. On the other hand, WagIer entirely failed in arranging snakes in natural families, venomous and non-venomous&nbsp;types being mixed in the majority of his groups.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">L. </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Fitzinger</span><span class="font2"> was Wagler’s contemporary; his first work@@<sup>5</sup> preceded Wagler’s system by four years. As he says in the&nbsp;preface, his object was to arrange the reptiles in&nbsp;“ a natural system.” Unfortunately, in order to&nbsp;attain this object, Fitzinger paid regard to the most superficial&nbsp;points of resemblance; and in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tabula affinitatum generum&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">which he constructed to demonstrate “ the progress of nature ”&nbsp;he has been much more successful in placing closely allied&nbsp;generic forms in contiguity than in tracing the relationships&nbsp;of the higher groups. That table is prepared in the form of&nbsp;a genealogical tree, but Fitzinger wished to express thereby&nbsp;merely the amount of morphological resemblance, and there is&nbsp;no evidence whatever in the text that he had a clear idea of&nbsp;genetic affinity. The Batraehians are placed at the bottom&nbsp;of the scheme, leading through Hyla to the Geckos (clearly&nbsp;on account of the digital dilatations) and through Caecilia to&nbsp;Amphisbaena. At the top Draco leads through Pterodactylus&nbsp;to the Bats (Pteropus), Ichthyosaurus to the Cetaceans (Del-phinus), Emys to the Monotremes, Testudo to Manis, and the&nbsp;Marine Turtles to the Divers and Penguins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In Fitzinger’s system the higher groups are, in fact, identical with those proposed by Merrem, while greater originality is shown in&nbsp;the subdivision of the orders. He differed also widely from Wagler&nbsp;in his views as to the relations of the extinct forms. The order&nbsp;of Loricata consists of two families, the Ichthyosauroidea and Croco-diloidea, the former comprising Iguanodon, Plesiosaurus, Sauro-cephalus and Ichthyosaurus. In the order Squamata Lacertilians&nbsp;and Ophidians are combined and divided into twenty-two families,&nbsp;almost all based on the most conspicuous external characters:&nbsp;the first two, viz. the Geckos and Chameleons, arc natural enough,&nbsp;but in the three following Iguanoids and Agamoids are sadly&nbsp;mixed, Pterodactyles and Draco forming one family; Megalo-saurus, Mosasaurus, Varanus, Tejus, &amp;c., are associated in another&nbsp;named Ameivoidea; the Amphisbaenidae are correctly defined;&nbsp;the Colubroidea are a heterogeneous assemblage of thirty genera;&nbsp;but with his family of Bungaroidea Fitzinger makes an attempt to&nbsp;separate at least a part of the venomous Colubrine Snakes from the&nbsp;Viperines, which again are differentiated from the last family, that&nbsp;of Crotaloidea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If this little work had been his only performance in the field of herpetology his name would have been honourably&nbsp;mentioned among his fellow-workers. But the promise of his&nbsp;early labours was not justified by his* later work, and if&nbsp;we take notice of the latter here it is only because his&nbsp;name has become attached to many a reptile through the&nbsp;pedantic rules of zoological nomenclature. The labours of&nbsp;Wiegmann, Müller, Duméril and Bibron exercised no influence&nbsp;on him, and when he commenced to publish a new system of&nbsp;reptiles in 1843,@@<sup>6</sup> of which fortunately one fasciculus only&nbsp;appeared, he exhibited a classification in which morphological&nbsp;facts are entirely superseded by fanciful ideas of the vaguest&nbsp;kind of physiosophy, each class of vertebrates being divided</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
