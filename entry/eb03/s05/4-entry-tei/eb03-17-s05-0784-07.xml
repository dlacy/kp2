in botany, that part of a plant arising out of the root, and which ſuſtains the leaves, flowers, fruits, &amp;c. By waſhing and rubbing the ſtems of trees, their annual, increaſe is promoted; for the method of doing which, ſee the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Tree.</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Stem</hi> <hi rend="italic">of a Ship, a</hi> circular piece of timber into which the two ſides oſ a ſhip are united at the fore end : the lower end of it is ſcarfed to the keel, and the bowſprit reſts upon its upper end. The ſtem is formed of one or two pieces, according to the size of the vessel ; and as it terminates the ſhip forward, the ends of the wales and planks of the ſides and bottom are let into a groove or channel, in the midſt of its ſurface, from the top to the bottom ; which operation is called <hi rend="italic">rabiting.</hi> The outside of the ſtem is uſually marked with a ſcale, or diviſion of feet, according to its perpendicular height from the keel. The intention of this is to aſcertain the draught of water at the forepart, when the ſhip is in preparation for a ſea-voyage, &amp;c. The ſtem at its lower end is of equal breadth and thickneſs with the keel, but it grows proportionally broader and thicker towards its upper extremity.
