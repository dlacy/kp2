The district is bounded on the north by the Bootan Hills, on the south by Mymunsing, on the east by the Brahmapootra, and on the west by Dinagepore. The river Durlah separates it from Couch Bahar. It is an open country, level, and well watered and productive. It yields in abundance silk, rice, indigo, hemp, and tobacco. Some parts of it are equal in fertility to any part of Bengal; but, on the whole, it is not so well cultivated or so populous as the other parts of this province. Besides the Brahmapootra, the principal rivers are the Teestah and the Durlah; and the chief towns Rungpoor, Mungulhaut, and Guzgotta. The tobacco grown here is mostly consumed in the southern and eastern districts of Bengal. The glandular swellings of the throat are very prevalent amongst the inhabitants, although parts of the district are a hundred miles distant from the Alpine region. This district was taken possession of by the Mahommedans early in the thirteenth century, and was always governed by a military collector. It was at first partially wrested from the rajah of Couch Bahar, when it was formed into a circar, and was finally conquered by the generals of Aurungzebe. It is now under a British establishment of a judge, collector, &amp;c. The result of some queries by the Marquis of Wellesley in 1801 gave a population of 400,000. Rungpoor, the capital, is situated on the eastern bank of the Goggot river. It is a regularly-built town, and carries on a considerable trade with Bootan, Assam, and Calcutta. Long. 89. 5. E. Lat.</p><p>25. 47. N.</p><p>RUNGPORE, an extensive fortress of Hindustan, which is sometimes, but erroneously, called the capital of Assam. Gergong is the real capital, of which Rungpore is only the fort. It is situated on an island, and can only be approached by a bridge, which was built centuries ago, and remains a monument of the abilities of the Bengal artificers who were employed to construct it. Long. 94. 40. E. Lat. 20.35. N.</p><p>RUNIC, a term applied to the language and letters of the ancient Goths, Danes, and other northern nations. See Scotland.</p><p>RUNNER, in nautical language, a rope belonging to the garnet and the two bolt-tackles. It is received in a single block joined to the end of a pendant; it has at one end a hook to hitch into any thing, and at the other a double block, into which is reeved the fall of the tackle, or the garnet, by which means it purchases more than the tackle would without it.</p><p>RUNNET, or Rennet, is the concreted milk found in the stomachs of sucking quadrupeds, which have as yet received no other nourishment than their mother’s milk. In ruminating animals, which have several stomachs, it is generally found in the last, though sometimes in the next to it. If the runnet is dried in the sun, and then kept close, it may be preserved in perfection for years. Not only the runnet itself, but also the stomach in which it is found, curdles milk without any previous preparation. But the common method is, to take the inner membrane of a calf’s stomach, to clean it well, to salt and hang it up in brown paper. When this is used the salt is washed off, then it is macerated in a little watbr during the night, and in the morning the infusion is poured into the milk to curdle it.</p><p>RUPEE, a silver coin current in the East Indies, equal to about two shillings and sixpence sterling.</p><p>RUPERT, Prince palatine of the Rhine, son of Frederick prince elector palatine of the Rhine, and Elizabeth daughter of James I. of England, was born in 1619. He gave proofs of his bravery at the age of thirteen; and in 1642 came over into England, and offered Iris service to</p><p>Charles I. his uncle, who gave him a command in his army. At Edgehill he charged with incredible bravery, and made a very great slaughter of the parliamentarians. In 1643 he seized the town of Cirencester, obliged the governor of Lichfield to surrender, and having joined his brother Prince Maurice, reduced Bristol in three days, and passed to the relief of Newark. In 1644 he marched to relieve York, where he gave the parliamentarians battle, and entirely defeated their right wing; but Cromwell charged the Marquis of Newcastle with such an irresistible force, that Prince Rupert was entirely defeated. After this the prince put himself into Bristol, which surrendered to Fairfax after a gallant resistance. The king was so enraged at the loss of this city, so contrary to his expectation, that he recalled all Prince Rupert’s commissions, and sent him a pass to go out of the kingdom. In 1648 he went to France, where he was highly complimented bv that court, and kindly received by Charles</p><p>II. who for the time sojourned there. Afterwards he was constituted admiral of the king’s navy; attacked the Dutch ships, many of which he took ; and having engaged with De Ruyter, obliged him to fly. He died in 1682, and was interred with great magnificence in Henry VII.’s chapel, Westminster. Mr Grainger observes, that he possessed in a high degree that kind of courage which is better in an attack than a defence, and is less adapted to the land-service than that of the sea, where precipitate valour is in its element. He seldom engaged but he gained the advantage, which, however, he generally lost by pursuing it too far. He was better qualified to storm a citadel, or even to mount a breach, than patiently to sustain a siege, and would have furnished an excellent hand to a general of a cooler head.</p><p>This prince is celebrated for the invention of prints in mezzotinto, of which he is said to have taken the hint from a soldier’s scraping his rusty fusil. The first print of this kind ever published was done by his highness, and may be seen in the first edition of Evelyn’s <hi rend="italic">Sculptra.</hi>  The secret is said to have been soon afterwards discovered by Sherwin, an engraver, who made use of a loaded file for laying the ground. The prince, upon seeing one of his prints, suspected that his servant had lent him his tool, which was a channelled roller; but upon receiving full satisfaction to the contrary, he made him a present of it. The roller was afterwards laid aside; and an instrument with a crenelled edge, shaped like a shoemaker’s cutting knife, was used instead of it. He also invented a metal called by his name, in which guns were cast; and contrived an excellent method of boring them, for which purpose a water-mill was erected at Hackney-marsh, to the great detriment of the undertaker, the secret dying with the inventor.</p><p><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="smallcaps">Rupert's Drops,</hi></hi>  a sort of glass drops with long and slender tails, which burst to pieces on the breaking off those tails in any part. They are said to have been invented by Prince Rupert, and are therefore called by his name.</p><p>RUPNAGUR, a town of Hindustan, in the province of Ajmeer, belonging to Dowlet Row Scindia. It is thirteen miles north-east from the city of Ajmeer. Long 74. 58. E. Lat. 26. 43. N.</p><p>RUPPIN, a city of Prussia, the capital of a circle of the same name, in the government of Potsdam, which extends over 725 square miles, and comprehends five cities, 97 villages, 84 hamlets, and 54,600 inhabitants. The city is situated on the lake Rhin, whence, by sluices, a stream is carried through it. Although ancient, it is well built, and was formerly fortified. It contains two churches, a gymnasium with six professors, and in 1834 had 800 houses and 7415 inhabitants. By a lake and a canal which joins the river Havel, the trade is extended to the Elbe. The occupations of the citizens chiefly consist in making woollen goods of various kinds, tanning leather, brewing beer, and distilling corn-spirits. Near to it there is much tobacco cultivated. Long. 22. 48. 47. E. Lat. 52. 55. 59. N.</p><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
