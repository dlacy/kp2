<p><span class="font1">RAFF, JOSEPH JOACHIM (1822-1882), German composer and orchestral conductor, was born near Zürich, Switzerland,&nbsp;on the 27th of May 1822, and educated chiefly at Schwyz. Here,&nbsp;under the care of the Jesuit fathers, he soon became an excellent&nbsp;classical and mathematical scholar, but received scarcely&nbsp;any instruction in his favourite art of music, in which, nevertheless, he made extraordinary progress through sheer force of&nbsp;natural genius, developed by persevering study which no ex-ternal obstacles could induce him to discontinue. So successful&nbsp;were his unaided efforts that, when in 1843 he sent some MSS.&nbsp;to Mendelssohn, that warm encourager of youthful talent felt&nbsp;justified in at once recommending him to Breitkopf &amp; Härtel,&nbsp;the Leipzig publishers, who brought out a large selection of&nbsp;his early works. Soon after this he became acquainted with&nbsp;Liszt, who gave him much generous encouragement. He first&nbsp;became personally acquainted with Mendelssohn at Cologne&nbsp;in 1846, and gave up all his other engagements for the purpose&nbsp;of following him to Leipzig, but his intention was frustrated by&nbsp;the great composer’s death in 1847. After this disappointment he remained for some time at Cologne, where his attention&nbsp;was alternately devoted to composition and to the preparation&nbsp;of critiques for the periodical </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cäcilia.</span><span class="font1"> Thus far he was a self-taught artist; but he felt the need of systematic instruction&nbsp;so deeply that, retiring for a time from public life, he entered at&nbsp;Stuttgart upon a long course of severe and uninterrupted&nbsp;study, and with so much success that in 1850 he appeared&nbsp;before the world in the character of an accomplished and&nbsp;highly cultivated musician. Raff now settled for a time in&nbsp;Weimar in order to be near Liszt. Hans von Bülow had already&nbsp;brought him into notice by playing his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Concertstiick</span><span class="font1"> for piano-forte and orchestra in public, and the favour with which this&nbsp;fine work was everywhere received encouraged him to attempt&nbsp;a greater one. During his stay in Stuttgart he had begun&nbsp;the composition of an opera entitled </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">König Alfred,</span><span class="font1"> and had&nbsp;good hope of securing its performance at Dresden; but the&nbsp;political troubles with which Germany was then overwhelmed&nbsp;rendered its production in the Saxon capital impossible. At&nbsp;Weimar he was more fortunate. In due time </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">König Alfred&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">was produced there under Liszt’s able direction at the court&nbsp;theatre with complete success; and later, in 1870, he wrote his&nbsp;second opera, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dame Kobold,</span><span class="font1"> for performance at the same theatre.&nbsp;A third opera, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Samson,</span><span class="font1"> remained unstaged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Raff lived at Weimar until 1856, when he obtained a large </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">clientèle</span><span class="font1"> at Wiesbaden as a teacher of the pianoforte. In 1859&nbsp;he married Doris Genast, an actress of high repute, and thenceforward devoted himself with renewed energy to the work of&nbsp;composition, displaying an inexhaustible fertility of invention&nbsp;tempered by great technical skill. He resided chiefly at Wies-baden till 1877, when he was appointed director of the Hoch-Conservatorium at Frankfort, an office which he retained until&nbsp;his death on the 25th of June 1882.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">More than 200 of Raff’s compositions have been published, including ten symphonies—undoubtedly his finest works—quartets, concertos, sonatas, songs, and examples of nearly every known&nbsp;variety of style; yet he never repeats himself. Notwithstanding&nbsp;his strong love for the romantic school, he is never guilty of extra-vagancc, and, if in his minor works he is sometimes a little commonplace, he never descends to vulgarity. His symphonies </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lenore</span><span class="font0"> and&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Im Walde</span><span class="font0"> are wonderful examples </span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font0">musical painting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RAFFAELLINO DEL GARBO (1466, or perhaps 1476-1524), Florentine painter. His real name was Raffaello Capponi;&nbsp;Del Garbo was a nickname, bestowed upon him seemingly&nbsp;from the graceful nicety </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(garbo)</span><span class="font1"> of his earlier works. He has&nbsp;also been called Raffaello de Florentia, and Raffaello de Carolis.&nbsp;He was a pupil of Filippino Lippi, with whom he remained till&nbsp;1490, if not later. He showed great facility in design, and&nbsp;excited hopes which the completed body of his works fell short&nbsp;of. He married and had a large family; embarrassments and&nbsp;a haphazard manner of work ensued; and finally he lapsed&nbsp;into a very dejected and penurious condition. Three of his&nbsp;best tempera pictures are in the Berlin Gallery; one of the&nbsp;Madonna standing with her Infant between two musician-angels, is particularly attractive. We may also name the oil-painting of the “ Resurrection ” done for the church of Monte&nbsp;Oliveto, Florence, now in the academy of the same city, ordinarily reputed to be Raffaellino’s masterpiece; the ceiling of&nbsp;the Caraffa Chapel in the church of the Minerva, Rome; and a&nbsp;“ Coronation of the Virgin ’’ in the Louvre, which is a production of much merit, though with somewhat over-studied&nbsp;grace. Angelo Allori was his pupil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RAFFET, DENIS AUGUSTE MARIE (1804-1860), French illustrator and lithographer, was born in Paris in 1804. At an&nbsp;early age he was apprenticed to a wood turner, but took up the&nbsp;study of art at evening classes. He became acquainted with&nbsp;Cabanel, who made him apply his skill to the decoration of&nbsp;china, and with Rudor, from whom he received instruction in&nbsp;lithography, in the practice of which he was to rise to fame.&nbsp;He then entered the École des Beaux-Arts, but returned&nbsp;definitely to lithography in 1830, when he produced on stone&nbsp;his famous designs of “ Lutzen, ” “ Waterloo, ” “ Le bal, ” “ La&nbsp;revue ’’ and “ Les adieux de la garnison, ” by which his reputation became immediately established. Raffet’s chief works were&nbsp;his lithographs of the Napoleonic campaigns, from Egypt to&nbsp;Waterloo, vigorous designs that are inspired by ardent patriotic&nbsp;enthusiasm. As an illustrator his activity was prodigious,&nbsp;the list of works illustrated by his crayon amounting to about&nbsp;forty-five, among which are Béranger’s poems, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">History of&nbsp;the Revolution</span><span class="font1"> by Thiers, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">History of Napoleon</span><span class="font1"> by de Norvins,&nbsp;the great </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Walter Scott</span><span class="font1"> by Defauconpret, the French Plutarch&nbsp;and Frédéric Bérat’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Songs.</span><span class="font1"> He went to Rome in 1849, was&nbsp;present at the siege of Rome, which he made the subject of&nbsp;some lithographs, and followed the Italian campaign of 1859,&nbsp;of which he left a record in his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Episodes de la campagne d’Italie&nbsp;de 1859.</span><span class="font1"> His portraits in pencil and water-colour are full of&nbsp;character. He died at Genoa in 1860. In 1893 a monument&nbsp;by Frémiet was unveiled in the Jardin de l’Infante at the&nbsp;Louvre, Paris.</span></p>
