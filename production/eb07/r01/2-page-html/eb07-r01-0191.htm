<p><span class="font3">the two rows must be accurately placed one upon the other, by folding the net over on itself ; then proceed as before.&nbsp;Sea-nets, such as those for herrings and mackerel, which&nbsp;are made in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">rands</span><span class="font3"> or breadths, are joined rand to rand&nbsp;lengthways, or along the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">selvages.</span><span class="font3"> The former are composed of three breadths, each thirty-two yards long by fifty&nbsp;loops deep, on a spool three inches in circumference. At&nbsp;the close of each year the lowest rand, which goes deepest&nbsp;into the sea, is removed, and a new one joined on at the&nbsp;top of the net ; so that the rand which was uppermost now&nbsp;becomes second, and that which was second is now the&nbsp;lowest. This latter is removed at the end of the next season, when the same rule is observed in replacing it, and&nbsp;so on every year ; thus the whole of the original net is renewed every three years. This operation is called by net-makers, giving the net a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">new jacket.</span><span class="font3"> Another mode of&nbsp;joining, and when performed carefully it is the neatest, is&nbsp;by uniting the two nets, or the two margins of one net, in&nbsp;the same way as the last row of the new piece is joined to&nbsp;the meshes of the old net in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">mending.</span><span class="font3"> The first-made side&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">inserted</span><span class="font3"> or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">joining work</span><span class="font3"> must be twice as long as&nbsp;the rest, as also the last side of the suture ; for they, in&nbsp;fact, are equivalent to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">two</span><span class="font3"> sides of a mesh. The following&nbsp;description of specific nets will serve to furnish examples of&nbsp;the foregoing rules, and of the mode of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">mounting</span><span class="font3"> nets,&nbsp;which yet remains to be noticed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The casting-net</span><span class="font3"> (fig. 7) is netted round and round (see No. 7 in this article) ; the number of the loops for the&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">lever</span><span class="font3"> vary, as well as their size, according as it is intended for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">gudgeons,</span><span class="font3"> &amp;c. or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">minnows ;</span><span class="font3"> in either case, it&nbsp;would be a great loss of labour if the whole net were made&nbsp;on one spool so small as it is necessary the lower part of&nbsp;this engine should be. Spools therefore of different circumferences are used, diminishing gradually from the largest&nbsp;for the top, to the smallest for the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">tuck.</span><span class="font3"> The following&nbsp;will form a good-sized net for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">gudgeons</span><span class="font3"> and larger fish. Fill&nbsp;the needle with double twine, net four rounds with a spool&nbsp;two inches and a half circumference, on a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">lever</span><span class="font3"> of thirty-six&nbsp;loops ; then use single twine, and in the fifth row set in&nbsp;twelve </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">false meshes ;</span><span class="font3"> net two rounds dead netting, and then&nbsp;set i</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">n false meshes</span><span class="font3"> in the same line with the others, having&nbsp;taken care to set in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">quarterings</span><span class="font3"> of the fifth row so as to&nbsp;divide the circle into equal parts. Net two feet down on&nbsp;the first spool, then one foot down on each of seven other&nbsp;spools, each spool being an eighth of an inch less than the&nbsp;preceding one. Continue to set in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">quarterings</span><span class="font3"> in their proper places, and at the commencement of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">eighth foot</span><span class="font3"> set&nbsp;m four additional </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">false meshes</span><span class="font3"> equidistantly between the&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">original quarterings,</span><span class="font3"> and continue putting in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">accrues&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">until you have netted a foot and a half more, having taken&nbsp;to your </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">eighth spool</span><span class="font3"> at the beginning of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ninth foot;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">then net four rows </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">dead</span><span class="font3"> netting in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">double</span><span class="font3"> twine ; take your&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ninth spool,</span><span class="font3"> and net two feet six inches of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">dead</span><span class="font3"> netting for&nbsp;the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">tuck,</span><span class="font3"> the last two rounds in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">double</span><span class="font3"> twine. Have a&nbsp;stout line with leaden bullets threaded on it, and sew this&nbsp;line, with running stitches, through each mesh, along the&nbsp;lowest row of the net, the interval between each </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">lead</span><span class="font3"> being&nbsp;two inches. This weighted margin is then turned upwards&nbsp;and inwards, and made fast to the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">double twine-work above&nbsp;the tuck,</span><span class="font3"> at about every foot of the circumference, by means&nbsp;of ratlines three inches long. The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">lead-line</span><span class="font3"> should be&nbsp;about a foot less in length than the row of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">tuck</span><span class="font3"> to which&nbsp;it is sewn. The leads are made fast to the line by being&nbsp;tied at each end to prevent slipping, and the holes should&nbsp;be bored as near the size of the line as possible. In fig. 7,&nbsp;the lines </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">a, a, a,</span><span class="font3"> show the seams formed by the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">accrues</span><span class="font3"> running down tile net ; </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">d, d, d, d,</span><span class="font3"> are the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ratlines</span><span class="font3"> by which&nbsp;the tuck is suspended from the rows of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">double</span><span class="font3"> meshes,&nbsp;marked by dots ; </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">be, be,</span><span class="font3"> indicate the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">tuck</span><span class="font3"> which forms a&nbsp;series of pockets, or rather one continuous pocket, inside&nbsp;the net, into which the fish fall. Fig. 7* shows a portion</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font3">of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">lead-line l, l,</span><span class="font3"> sewn on to the last row of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">tuck ;</span><span class="font3"> L is the bullet ; </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">s, s, s, s, s, s, s,</span><span class="font3"> the course of the twine, simply run through the meshes and round the lead-line ; </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">t, t,&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">tie</span><span class="font3"> which holds the mesh on each side the bullet L first;&nbsp;v, v<sup>,</sup>, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">V,</span><span class="font3"> the twine which sews the line to the meshes, passing over the bullet, being threaded through the loops which&nbsp;extend along the length of the bullet. The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">trammel</span><span class="font3"> consists of three separate layers of nettings, and derives its&nbsp;name from its conformation (</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">trois mailles,</span><span class="font3"> French), because&nbsp;it ensnares by </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">threefold meshes.</span><span class="font3"> The three parts consist Of&nbsp;two </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">out-wallings</span><span class="font3"> and the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">lint;</span><span class="font3"> this latter is suspended&nbsp;loosely between the two former, it being made twice their&nbsp;length and twice their depth. The two </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">out-wallings</span><span class="font3"> are&nbsp;to be of the same size.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The length and depth of this engine varies according to the service it is intended to perform, either in fishing or&nbsp;fowling ; the same may be said of the size of the meshes ;&nbsp;those of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">out-wallings,</span><span class="font3"> however, are generally five times&nbsp;larger from knot to knot than those of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">lint.</span><span class="font3"> All the&nbsp;parts should be netted </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">four square</span><span class="font3"> (as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">oblong</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">square&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">netting is sometimes called, see No. 6 in this article),&nbsp;the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">lint</span><span class="font3"> in twine as fine as may be consistent with the required strength, and the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">out-wallings</span><span class="font3"> with much stouter material in proportion. These, when finished, are to be </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">mounted.&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">Fix each of the four corners of one </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">out-walling</span><span class="font3"> to four&nbsp;pegs driven into the ground, which should be cleared of&nbsp;rubbish, &amp;c. The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">out-walling</span><span class="font3"> is to be stretched tight.&nbsp;Pass all round the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">lint,</span><span class="font3"> through each mesh, a stout line of&nbsp;twine, as thick as that of which the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">out-wallings are</span><span class="font3"> made.&nbsp;This line, and likewise the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">lint</span><span class="font3"> at its four corners, is made&nbsp;fast to the four pegs ; the former is drawn tight from peg&nbsp;to peg, but the latter, being longer and wider, hangs loosely. The meshes of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">lint</span><span class="font3"> should be as equally distributed&nbsp;along the line as is possible. Over the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">lint</span><span class="font3"> is applied the&nbsp;other </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">out-walling,</span><span class="font3"> the four corners of which are to be fastened to the four pegs. If the engine is intended for fishing, a stout cord must be threaded with round flat corks&nbsp;two inches diameter, and half an inch thick, more or less.&nbsp;This cord is to be fixed along the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">head</span><span class="font3"> of the net by means&nbsp;of pieces of twine whipped two or three times round, and&nbsp;embracing the line of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">lint</span><span class="font3">, the margins of each out</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">-</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">walling,</span><span class="font3"> and tile </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">cord</span><span class="font3"> itself. The twine is tied into a firm&nbsp;knot at those points where the cord meets the angles of&nbsp;the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">out-walling's</span><span class="font3"> meshes. The floats are placed about six&nbsp;inches apart, and are pierced, so as to embrace the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">heud-rope</span><span class="font3"> firmly. This last is made fast down </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">each side of</span><span class="font3"> the net,&nbsp;at the angles of the meshes of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">out-wallings ;</span><span class="font3"> but it has&nbsp;here no floats ; it is extended along the bottom of the net,&nbsp;where it is called the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">foot-rope,</span><span class="font3"> and is weighted with small&nbsp;plates of lead rolled and beaten round it with a hammer, as&nbsp;a tag is fixed round a boot-lace, at about every three inches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The cord that thus surrounds the net must be bent into a loop at each end of the top of the net, for to these is to&nbsp;be made fast a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">draw-rope</span><span class="font3"> when the net is </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">shot.</span><span class="font3"> Some net-makers also tie the three layers of net together at each&nbsp;angle </span><span class="font4">of </span><span class="font3">the meshes of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">out-wallings</span><span class="font3"> throughout the area&nbsp;of the net, to give additional strength, and to prevent the&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">lint</span><span class="font3"> getting </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">huddled</span><span class="font3"> together at the bottom when suspended in the water or drawn along the ground. This engine&nbsp;acts thus : The fish or fowl passes through the large mesh&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font3"> the out-walling, strikes against the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">lint,</span><span class="font3"> which, hanging&nbsp;loosely, yields, and protrudes through the corresponding&nbsp;mesh of the other </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">out-walling,</span><span class="font3"> and thus forms a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">cœcum,&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">into which the animal falls, and is entangled. The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">hoop-net</span><span class="font3"> consists of two parts ; the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">body,</span><span class="font3"> and the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">valve, funnel,&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">gullet,</span><span class="font3"> which are united in the manner hereafter to be&nbsp;described. Begin with the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">body</span><span class="font3"> at its lower or pointed end&nbsp;(see fig. 8), and work up to its entrance, thus : Net thirty-seven loops round on a spool four inches circumference,&nbsp;one row. Take a spool two inches circumference and net&nbsp;twenty rows of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">dead</span><span class="font3"> netting. In the next row set in five</span></p>
