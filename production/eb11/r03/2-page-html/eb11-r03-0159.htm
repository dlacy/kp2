<p><span class="font0">RODBERTUS, KARL JOHANN (1805-1875), German socialist, was born at Greifswald on the 12th of August 1805, his father&nbsp;being a professor at the university there. He studied law&nbsp;at Gottingen and Berlin, thereafter engaging in various legal&nbsp;occupations; and, after travelling for some time, he bought&nbsp;the estate of Jagetzow in Pomerania, whence his name of&nbsp;Rodbertus-Jagetzow. In 1836 he settled on this estate, and&nbsp;henceforward devoted his life chiefly to economic and other&nbsp;studies, taking also some interest in local and provincial affairs.&nbsp;After the revolution of March 1848 Rodbertus was elected&nbsp;member of the Prussian national assembly, in which body he&nbsp;belonged to the left centre; and for fourteen days he filled&nbsp;the post of minister of public worship and education. He&nbsp;sat for Berlin in the second chamber of 1849, and moved the&nbsp;adoption of the Frankfort imperial constitution, which was&nbsp;carried. When the system of dividing the Prussian electorate&nbsp;into three classes was adopted, Rodbertus recommended&nbsp;abstention from voting. His only subsequent appearance in&nbsp;public life was his candidature for the first North German diet,&nbsp;in which he was defeated. His correspondence with Lassalle&nbsp;was an interesting feature of his life. At one time Rodbertus&nbsp;had some intention of forming a “ social party ” with the help&nbsp;of the conservative socialist Rudolf Meyer and of W. Hasen-clever, a prominent follower of Lassalle; but no progress was&nbsp;made in this. Rodbertus was neither disposed nor qualified&nbsp;to be an agitator, being a man of a quiet and critical temperament, who believed that society could not be improved by&nbsp;violent changes, but by a long and gradual course of development. He Varned the working men of Germany against connecting themselves with any political party, enjoining them&nbsp;to be a “ social party ” pure and simple. He died on the 8th&nbsp;of December 1875.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The general position of Rodbertus was “ social, monarchical and national.” He held the purely economic part of the creed of the&nbsp;German social-democratic party, but he did not agree with their&nbsp;methods, and had no liking for the productive associations with&nbsp;state help of Lassalle. He regarded a socialistic republic as a&nbsp;possible thing, but he cordially accepted the monarchic institution&nbsp;in his own country and hoped that a German emperor might undertake the rôle of a social emperor. The basis of the economic teaching of Rodbertus is the principle laid down by Adam Smith and&nbsp;Ricardo, and insisted on by all the later socialists, that labour is the&nbsp;source and measure of value. In connexion with this he developed&nbsp;the position that rent, profit and wages are all parts of a national&nbsp;income produced by the united organic labour of the workers of&nbsp;the community. Consequently there can be no talk of the wages&nbsp;of labour being paid out of capital; wages is only that part of the&nbsp;national income which is received by the workmen, of a national&nbsp;income which they have themselves entirely produced. The wages&nbsp;fund theory is thus summarily disposed of. But the most important&nbsp;result of the theory is his position that the possession of land and&nbsp;capital enables the landholders and capitalists to comjxïl the workmen&nbsp;to divide the product of their labour with those non-working classes,&nbsp;and in such a proportion that the workers only obtain as much as&nbsp;can support them in life. Thus the iron Iatvof wages is established.&nbsp;Hence also Rodbertus deduces his theory of commercial crises and&nbsp;of pauperism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A fundamental part of the teaching of Rodbertus is his theory of social development. He recognized three stages in the economic&nbsp;progress of mankind: (l) the ancient heathen period in which&nbsp;property in human beings was the rule; (2) the period of private&nbsp;property in land and capital; (3) the period, still remote, of property&nbsp;as dependent on service or desert. The goal of the human race is&nbsp;to be one society organized on a communistic basis; only in that&nbsp;way can the principle that every man be rewarded according to&nbsp;his work be realized. In this communistic or socialistic state of&nbsp;thefuture land and capital will be national property, and the entire&nbsp;national production will be under national control ; and means will&nbsp;be taken so to estimate the labour of each ,citizen that he shall&nbsp;be rewarded according tojts precise amount. An immense staff of&nbsp;state officials will be required for this function. Rodbertus believed&nbsp;that this stage of social development is yet far distant ; he thought&nbsp;that five centuries will need to pass away before the ethical force&nbsp;of the people can be equal to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">From temperament, culture and social position Rodbertus was averse to agitation as a means of hastening the new era; and, in&nbsp;the measures which he recommends for making the transition&nbsp;towards it, he showed a scrupulous regard for the existing interests&nbsp;of the capitalists and landholders. He proposed that those two&nbsp;classes should be left in full possession of their present share of&nbsp;the national income, but that the workers should reap the benefit&nbsp;of the increasing production. To secure them this increment of&nbsp;production, he proposed that the state should fix a ” normal working&nbsp;day ” for the various trades, a normal day’s work,, and a legal wage,&nbsp;the amount of which should be revised periodically, and raised&nbsp;according to the increase of production, the better workman receiving a better wage. By measures such as these, carried out by the&nbsp;state in order to correct the evils of competition, would Rodbertus&nbsp;seek to make the transition into the socialistic era.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The economic work of Rodbertus is an attempt made in a temperate and scientific spirit to elucidate the evil tendencies&nbsp;inherent in the competitive system, especially as exemplified in&nbsp;the operation of the iron law of wages. The remedy he proposes&nbsp;is a state management of production and distribution, which shall&nbsp;extend more and more, till we arrive at a complete and universal&nbsp;socialism,—and all based on the principle that as labour is the&nbsp;source of value so to the labourer should all wealth belong. It is&nbsp;therefore an attempt to place socialism on a scientific basis; and&nbsp;he is certainly entitled to be regarded as one of the founders of&nbsp;“ scientific socialism.”</span></p>
