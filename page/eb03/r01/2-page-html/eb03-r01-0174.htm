<p><span class="font1">dent. There can be no evidence that any traditional revelation is of divine original, in the words we receive&nbsp;it, and the fenſe we underſtand it, ſo clear and ſo certain as that of the principles of reaſon: and, there-fore, nothing that is contrary to the clear and fclf-evident dictates of reafon, has a right to be urged or&nbsp;affented to as a matter of faith, wherein reafon has&nbsp;'nothing to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Revelation </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">oſ St John.</span><span class="font1"> See Atocalvpsε. REVELS, entertainments of dancing, maſking, act-</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">■ ing comedies, farces, &amp;c. anciently very frequent in the inns of court and in noblemens houfes, but now&nbsp;-much diſufed. Thc officer who has the direction of&nbsp;the revels at court is called the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">Master of the Revels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">REVENGE, means the return of injury for injury,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">■and differs materially from that ſudden reſentmertt which ,rifes in the mind immediately on being injured ; which,&nbsp;fo far ſrom being culpable when reſtrained within due&nbsp;bounds, is abfolutely neceſſary for felf-preſervation. Revenge, on the contrary, is a cool and deliberate wicked-neſs, and is often executed years after the offence was&nbsp;given ; and the defire of it is generally the effect of&nbsp;•littleneſs, weakneſs, and vice ; while, to do right, and&nbsp;to fnffer wrong, is an argument of a great ſoul, that&nbsp;ſcorns to ſtoop to ſuggeſted revenges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Revenge is but a frailty incident</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">To craz’d and fickly minds ; the poor content</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font1">little fouls, unable to ſurmount</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">An injury, too weak to bear affront. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dryden.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Revenge is generally the concomitant of ſavage minds, of minds implacable, and capable of the moſt&nbsp;horrid barbarities ; unable to fet any limits to their dif-pleafure, they can confine their anger within no bounds&nbsp;of reaſon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Cruel revenge, which ſtill we find</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The wcakeſt frailty of a feeble mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Degenerous paſſion, and for man too bafe,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It ſeats its empire in the favage race.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">The inſtitution of law prevents the execution of private revenge, and the growth of civilization ſhows its impropriety. Though in modern times a ſpecies of revenge is ſanctioned by what is called the law of honour,&nbsp;which evades the law of the land indeed, but which is&nbsp;equally mean and diſgraceful as the other kinds, and is&nbsp;of conſequences equally baneful. See Anger, Duelling, and Resentment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">REVENUE, the annual income a perfon receives from the rent of his lands, houſes, intereſt of money&nbsp;in the ſtocks, &amp;c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Royal Revenue,</span><span class="font1"> that which the Britiſh conſtitution hath veſted in the royal perſon, in order to ſupport his&nbsp;dignity and maintain his power ; being a portion&nbsp;which each ſubject contributes of his property, in order to ſecure the remainder. This revenue is either </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ordinary</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">extraordinary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">I. The king’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ordinary</span><span class="font1"> revenue is ſuch as has either ſubliſted time out of mind in the crown.; or elfe has been granted by parliament, by way of purchaſe&nbsp;or exchange for ſuch of the king’s inherent hereditary&nbsp;revenues as were found inconvenient to the ſubject.—&nbsp;In faying that it has ſubfiſted time out of mind in&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">the χrown, </span><span class="font1">we do not mean that the king is at pre</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font1">ſent in the actual poſſeſſion of the whole of his revenue. Much (nay the greateſt part) of it is at this day in the hands of ſubjects ; to whom it has been grant-ed out from time to time by the kings of England :&nbsp;which has rendered the crown in ſome meafure dependent on the people for its ordinary ſupport and ſub-fiſtenee. So that we muſt be obliged to recount, as&nbsp;part of the royal revenue, what lords of manors and&nbsp;other ſubjects frequently look upon to be their own&nbsp;abſolute rights ; becaufe they and their anceſtors are and&nbsp;have been veſted in them for ages, though in reality&nbsp;originally derived from the grants of our ancient&nbsp;princes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">The firſt of the king’s ordinary revenues, which&nbsp;may be taken notice of, is of an ecclefiaſtical kind (as&nbsp;are alfo the three ſucceeding ones), viz. the cuſtody of&nbsp;the temporalities of biſhops. See Temporalities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king is entitled to a corody, as the law calls&nbsp;it, out of every biſhopric ; that is, to fend one of his&nbsp;chaplains to be maintained by the biſhop, or to have </span><span class="font2">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">penfion allowed him till the biſhop promotes him to a&nbsp;benefice. This is alfo in the nature of an acknowledgement to the king, as founder of the ſee, fince he had&nbsp;formerly the ſame corody or penfion from every abbey&nbsp;or priory of royal foundation. It is ſuppofed to be now&nbsp;fallen into total diſuſe } though Sir Matthew Hale fays,&nbsp;that it is due of common right, and that no preſcrip-tion will diſcharge it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king alfo is entitled to all the tithes ari-fing in extraparochial places : though perhaps it may&nbsp;be doubted how far this article, as well as the laſt, can&nbsp;be properly reckoned a part of the king’s own royal&nbsp;revenue ; fince a corody ſupports only his chaplains,&nbsp;and thefe extraparochial tithes are held under an im-plied truſt that the king will diſtribute them for the&nbsp;good of the clergy in general.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next branch confiſts in the firft-fru⅛s and&nbsp;tenths of all ſpiritual preferments in the kingdom. See&nbsp;Tenths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next bιanch of the king’s ordinary revenue&nbsp;(which, as well as the ſubſequent branches, is of a lay&nbsp;or temporal nature) conſiſts in the rents and profits of&nbsp;the demeſne lands of the crown. Theſe demefne lands,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">terra dominicales refits,</span><span class="font1"> being either the ſhare reſerved&nbsp;to the crown at the original diſtribution of landed property, or ſuch as came to it afterwards by forfeitures&nbsp;or other means, were anciently very large and exten-five ; comprifing divers manors, honours, and lord-ſhips ; the tenants of which had very peculiar privi-leges, when we ſpeak of the tenure in ancient demeſne.&nbsp;At prefent they are contracted within a very narrow&nbsp;compaſs, having bcen almoſt entirely granted away to&nbsp;private ſubjects. This has occafioned the parliament&nbsp;frequently to interpole ; and particularly after King&nbsp;william III. had greatly impoveriſhed the crown, an&nbsp;act paſſed, whereby all future grants or leaſes from the&nbsp;crown for any longer term than 31 years or three lives,&nbsp;are declared to be void ;■ except with regard to houſes,&nbsp;which may be granted for 50 years. And no rever-fionary leaſe can be made, ſo as to exceed, together&nbsp;with the eſtate in being, the ſame term of three lives&nbsp;or 31 years ; that is, when there is a ſubfiſting leafe,&nbsp;of which there are 20 years ſtill to come, the king can-not grant a future intereſt, to commence after the ex-piration of the former, for any longer term than 11</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
