<p><label>ROBSON, STUART</label>
(1836-1903), American actor, whose real name was Robson Stuart, was born in Annapolis, Maryland, on the 4th of March 1836. An unintentionally humorous appearance in a serious part in 1852 showed him that his forte was comedy; and in partnership with W. H. Crane from 1877 to 1889 he was very successful as a comedian, <hi rend="italic">The Henrietta</hi> being one of their best productions. He died on the 29th of April 1903. His wife, May Robson, also became well known as an actress.</p>
