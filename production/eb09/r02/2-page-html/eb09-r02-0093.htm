<p><span class="font1">jointly with Joseph Stell, a patent for improvements in the ribbon loom ; and since that period it has benefited&nbsp;by the inventions applied to weaving machinery generally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Ribbon weaving is known to have been established near St Étienne (dep. Loire) so early as the 11th century, and that town&nbsp;to the present day continues to be the headquarters of the&nbsp;industry. In the time of Louis XIV. the ribbon trade there gave&nbsp;employment to about 6000 persons; now about 17,000 looms are&nbsp;in operation in the district, 1500 of which are power-looms in&nbsp;factories. Statistics compiled in 1881 give the annual value of&nbsp;the trade at 63,400,000 francs, of which 45,000,000 francs was the&nbsp;value of ribbons proper, the remainder being represented by scarfs,&nbsp;trimmings, elastic web, chenille, &amp;c. During the Huguenot&nbsp;troubles, ribbon weavers from St Étienne settled at Basel and&nbsp;there established an industry which now rivals that of the original&nbsp;seat of the trade. In the Basel district the looms number 8000 ;&nbsp;but one-half of these are power-looms in factories, which have&nbsp;a much greater productive capacity than the domestic looms.&nbsp;Crefeld is the centre of the German ribbon industry, the manufacture of black velvet ribbon being there a specialty. In Vienna&nbsp;about 2000 looms are employed. Next to St Étienne and Basel,&nbsp;Coventry is the most important seat of ribbon making, and to some&nbsp;extent the industry is also prosecuted at Norwich and Leicester.&nbsp;The average annual value of the ribbon trade of western Europe&nbsp;and America is £16,000,000. A large proportion of the ribbons&nbsp;now made are mixed fabrics of silk and cotton.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RIBERA, Jusepe, or, in Italian, Giuseppe (1588— 1656), commonly called Lo Spagnoletto, or the Little&nbsp;Spaniard, a leading painter of the Neapolitan or partly of&nbsp;the Spanish school, was born near Valencia in Spain, at&nbsp;Xativa, now named S. Felipe, on 12th January 1588.&nbsp;His parents intended him for a literary or learned career ;&nbsp;but, having an innate tendency to design, he neglected the&nbsp;regular studies, and entered the school of the Spanish&nbsp;painter Francisco Ribalta. Fired with a longing to study&nbsp;art in its Italian headquarters, he somehow, while still&nbsp;quite a youth, made his way to Rome, worked vehemently,&nbsp;and struggled with hunger and destitution. Early in the&nbsp;17th century a cardinal noticed him in the streets of&nbsp;Rome drawing from the frescos on a palace façade ; he&nbsp;took up the ragged stripling and housed him in his&nbsp;mansion. Artists had then already bestowed upon the&nbsp;alien student, who was perpetually copying all sorts of&nbsp;objects in art and in nature, the nickname of Lo Spagnoletto. In the cardinal’s household Ribera was comfortable&nbsp;but dissatisfied; he found his studies in abeyance, and&nbsp;one day he decamped. He then betook himself to the&nbsp;famous painter Michelangelo da Caravaggio, the head of&nbsp;the naturalist school, called also the school of the Tene-brosi, or shadow-painters, owing to the excessive contrasts&nbsp;of light and shade which marked their style. In this&nbsp;method of art Ribera, though not claiming the first place&nbsp;as initiator, was destined to rank as hardly second to&nbsp;Caravaggio himself. The Italian master gave every&nbsp;encouragement to the Spaniard, but not for long, as he&nbsp;died in 1609. Ribera, who had in the first instance&nbsp;studied chiefly from Raphael and the Caracci, had by&nbsp;this time acquired so much mastery over the tenebroso&nbsp;style that his performances were barely distinguishable&nbsp;from Caravaggio’s own. He now went to Parma, and&nbsp;worked after the frescos of Correggio with great zeal and&nbsp;efficiency ; in the museum of Madrid is his Jacob’s Ladder,&nbsp;which is regarded as his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">cdιef-dœuvre</span><span class="font1"> in the Correggesque&nbsp;manner. From Parma Spagnoletto returned to Rome,&nbsp;where he resumed the style of Caravaggio, which was&nbsp;doubtless more conformable to his natural bent, and shortly&nbsp;afterwards he migrated to Naples, which became his permanent home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Ribera was as yet still poor and inconspicuous, but a rich picture-dealer in Naples soon discerned in him all the&nbsp;stuff of a successful painter, and gave him his daughter in&nbsp;marriage. This w<sup>τ</sup>as the turning point in the Spaniard’s&nbsp;fortunes. He painted a Martyrdom of St Bartholomew,&nbsp;which the father-in-law exhibited from his balcony to a&nbsp;rapidly increasing and admiring crowd. The popular&nbsp;excitement grew to so noisy a height as to attract the&nbsp;attention of the Spanish viceroy the Count de Monterey.&nbsp;From this nobleman and from the king of Spain, Philip&nbsp;IV., commissions now flowed in upon Ribera. Various&nbsp;professional honours followed; he painted with incessant&nbsp;vigour; his house became a centre of fashionable concourse;&nbsp;and he made vast sums of money. In the streets he only&nbsp;appeared in his carriage—then a sure criterion of affluence.&nbsp;After a while he found it necessary to curb his own and&nbsp;his patrons’ appetite for work, and he limited himself to&nbsp;six hours in the day, ending towards noon. With prosperity came grasping and jealous selfishness. Spagnoletto, chief in a triumvirate of greed, his abettors being a&nbsp;Greek painter, Belisario Corenzio, and a Neapolitan,&nbsp;Giambattista Caracciolo, determined that Naples should&nbsp;be an artistic monopoly; by intrigue, terrorizing, and&nbsp;personal violence on occasion they kept aloof all competitors. Annibale Caracci, the Cavalier d’Arpino, Guido,&nbsp;Domenichino, all of them successively invited to work in&nbsp;Naples, found the place too hot to hold them. Domenichino was so persecuted and victimized that his life was&nbsp;probably abridged by these truly “tenebrous” machinations. The cabal ended at the time of Caracciolo’s death&nbsp;in 1641.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The close of Ribera’s triumphant career has been variously related. If we are to believe Dominici, the&nbsp;historian of Neapolitan art, he totally disappeared from&nbsp;Naples in 1648 and was no more heard of,—this being the&nbsp;sequel of the abduction, by Don John of Austria, son of&nbsp;Philip IV., of the painter’s beautiful only daughter Maria&nbsp;Rosa. Dominici indeed will not even allow that Ribera&nbsp;was a Spaniard by birth ; he alleges that the painter,&nbsp;though of Spanish descent, was born at Gallipoli, in the&nbsp;province of Lecce, kingdom of Naples. But these assertions have not availed to displace the earlier and well-authenticated statement that Ribera, a genuine Spaniard&nbsp;in the fullest sense, died peaceably and wealthy in Naples&nbsp;in 1656. His own signature on his pictures is constantly&nbsp;“ Jusepe de Ribera, Espanol.” His daughter, so far from&nbsp;being disgraced by an abduction, married a Spanish nobleman who became a minister of the viceroy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The pictorial style of Spagnoletto is extremely powerful ; or one might better define its special quality as immensely forcible,&nbsp;equally sustaining the test of a distant and general or of a close and&nbsp;scrutinizing view. In his earlier style, founded (as we have seen)&nbsp;sometimes on Caravaggio and sometimes on the wholly diverse&nbsp;method of Correggio, the study of Spanish and Venetian masters&nbsp;can likewise be traced. Along with his massive and predominating shadows, he retained from first to last great strength of local&nbsp;colouring. His forms, though ordinary and partly gross, are correct ; the impression of his works gloomy and startling. He&nbsp;delighted in subjects of horror : an agonizing martyrdom—the gridiron of Lawrence, the flaying knife of Bartholomew, or the vulture of&nbsp;Prometheus—had for him no repulsion but a grim fascination. Ho&nbsp;had many imitators, his influence extending from Naples to other&nbsp;parts of Italy, and also to his native Spain. Salvator Rosa and&nbsp;Luca Giordano were his most distinguished pupils ; also Giovanni&nbsp;Do, Enrico Fiammingo, Michelangelo Fracanzani, and Aniello&nbsp;Falcone, who was the first considerable painter of battle-pieces.&nbsp;Among Ribera’s principal works should bo named St Januarius&nbsp;Emerging from the Furnace, in the cathedral of Naples ; the Descent&nbsp;from the Cross, in the Neapolitan Certosa, generally regarded as&nbsp;his masterpiece ; the Adoration of the Shepherds (a late work, 1650),&nbsp;now in the Louvre ; the Martyrdom of St Bartholomew, in the&nbsp;museum of Madrid ; the Pietà in the sacristy of S. Martino, Naples.&nbsp;His mythologie subjects are generally unpleasant—such as the&nbsp;Silenus, in the Studi Gallery of Naples, and Venus Lamenting over&nbsp;Adonis, in the Corsini Gallery of Rome. The Louvre contains altogether twenty-five of his paintings ; the London National Gallery&nbsp;two—one of them, a Pietà, being an excellent though not exactly a&nbsp;leading specimen. He executed several fine male portraits ; among&nbsp;others his own likeness, now in the collection at Alton Towers. He&nbsp;also produced twenty-six etchings, ably treated. For the use of his&nbsp;pupils, he drew a number of elementary designs, which in 1650&nbsp;were etched by Francisco Fernandez, and which continued much in</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
