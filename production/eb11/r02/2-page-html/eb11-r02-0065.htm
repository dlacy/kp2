<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rent Charge.</span><span class="font0">—A rent charge is a grant of an annual sum payable out of lands in which the grantor has an estate. It&nbsp;may be in fee, in tail, for life—the most common form—or for&nbsp;years. It must be crcated by deed or will, and may be either&nbsp;at common law or under the Statute of Uses (1536). Thc&nbsp;grantor has no reversion, and the grantce has at common law no&nbsp;power of distress, though such power may be given him by the&nbsp;instrument creating the rent charge. The Statute of Uses (1536)&nbsp;gave a power of distress for a rent charge created under the&nbsp;statute. The Conveyancing Act 1881, § 44, has given a power&nbsp;of distress for a sum due on any rent charge which is twenty-one&nbsp;days in arrear. By § 45 a power of redemption of certain perpetual rents in the nature of rcnt charges is given to the owner&nbsp;of the land out of which the rent issues. Rent charges grantcd&nbsp;since April 26th, 1855, otherwise than by marriage Settlemcnt&nbsp;or will for a life or lives or for any estate determinable on a life&nbsp;or lives must, in order to bind lands against purchasers, mortgagees or creditors, be registered in the Land Registry in&nbsp;Lincoln’s Inn Fields (Judgments Act 1855 and Land Charges&nbsp;Act 1900). In certain other cases it is also necessary to register&nbsp;rent charges, for instance, under the Improvement of Land&nbsp;Act 1864 and the Land Transfer Acts 1875 and 1897. Rent&nbsp;charges are barred by non-payment or non-acknowledgment&nbsp;for twelve years. The period of limitation for the arrears of&nbsp;such rent is six years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Various Forms of Rent Charge.—</span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">-Fomis of rent charge of special interest are </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tithe rent charge</span><span class="font0"> (see Tithes), and the rent charges&nbsp;formerly used for the purpose of creating “ faggot votes.” The&nbsp;device was adopted of creating parliamentary voters by splitting&nbsp;up freehold interests into a number of rent-charges of the annual&nbsp;value of 40s., so as to satisfy the freeholders’ franchise. But&nbsp;such rent charges are now rendered ineffective by the Representation of the People Act 1884, § 4, which enacts (subject to a&nbsp;saving for existing rights and an exception in favour of owners&nbsp;of tithe rent charge) that a man shall not be entitled to be&nbsp;rcgistered as a voter in respect of the ownership of any rent&nbsp;charge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A rent charge reserved without power of distress is termed a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">rent-seck (reditus siccus) QT</span><span class="font0"> “ dry rent,” from the absence of the&nbsp;power of distress. But, as power of distress for rents-seck was&nbsp;given by the Landlord and Tenant Act 1736, thc legal effect&nbsp;of such rents has been since the act the same as that of a rent&nbsp;charge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Other Varieties of Rent.—Rents of assize or Quit rents</span><span class="font1"> are a relic of the old customary rents. They are presumed to have been&nbsp;established by usage, and cannot be increased or diminished. A&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Quit rent (quietus reditus)</span><span class="font1"> is a yearly payment made from time&nbsp;immemorial by freeholders or copyholders of a manor to the lord.&nbsp;The term implies that the tenant thereby becomes free and quit&nbsp;from all other services. Owing to the change in the value of money,&nbsp;these rents are now of little value. Under the Conveyancing Act&nbsp;1881 (s. 45) they may be compulsorily redeemed by the freehold&nbsp;tenant; and the Copyhold Act 1894 provides similarly for their&nbsp;extinction in the case of manors. Quit rents, like ordinary rent&nbsp;charges, are barred by non-payment, or non-acknowledgment, for&nbsp;twelve years. Those paid Dy freeholders are called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chief rents.&nbsp;Fee farm rents</span><span class="font1"> are rents reserved on grants in fee. According to&nbsp;some authorities, they must be at least one-fourth of the value of&nbsp;the lands. They, like quit rents, now occur only in manors,&nbsp;unless existing before the Statute of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Quia Emptores</span><span class="font1"> or created by&nbsp;the crown (see Real Property). A rent which is equivalent&nbsp;or nearly equivalent in amount to the full annual value of the land&nbsp;is a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rack rent.</span><span class="font1"> A rent which falls appreciably short of a rack rent&nbsp;is usually styled a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ground rent (q.v.).</span><span class="font1"> It is generally reserved on&nbsp;land which the lessee agrees to cover with buildings, and is calculated&nbsp;on the value of the land, though the buildings to be erected increase&nbsp;the security for the rent and revert to the lessor at the end of the&nbsp;term. A </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">dead rent</span><span class="font1"> is a fixed annual sum paid by a person working&nbsp;a mine or quarry, in addition to royalties varying according to the&nbsp;amount of minerals taken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The object of a dead rent is twofold—first, to provide a specified income on which the lessor can rely; secondly (and this is the&nbsp;more important reason), as a security that the mine will be worked,&nbsp;and worked with reasonable rapidity. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rents in kind</span><span class="font1"> still exist&nbsp;to a limited extent; thus the corporation of London is tenant of&nbsp;some land§ in Shropshire by payment to the crown of an annual&nbsp;rent of a fagot. All </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">peppercorn, or</span><span class="font1"> nominal, rents seem to fall under&nbsp;this head.@@<sup>1</sup> The object of the peppercorn rent is to secure the&nbsp;acknowledgment by the tenant of the landlord’s right. In modern&nbsp;building leases a peppercorn rent is sometimes reserved as the&nbsp;rent for the first few years. Services rendered in lieu of payment&nbsp;by tenants in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">grand</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">petit</span><span class="font1"> serjeanty may also be regarded as&nbsp;examples of rents in kind. Grand serjeanty is a form of tenure in&nbsp;chivalry under which the king’s tenants </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(servientes)</span><span class="font1"> in chief owed&nbsp;special military or personal services to the king; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font1"> carrying his&nbsp;banner. Petit serjeanty—a form of tenure in socage—was usually&nbsp;applied to tenure of the king or a mesne lord by some fixed service&nbsp;of trivial value, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font1"> feeding his hounds. These forms of tenure&nbsp;were abolished in 1660. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Labour rents</span><span class="font1"> are represented by those&nbsp;cases, not unfrequent in agricultural leases, where the tenant is&nbsp;bound to render the landlord a certain amount of team work or&nbsp;other labour as a part of his rent, lt was held in the court of&nbsp;queen’s bench in 1845 that tenants who occupied houses on the&nbsp;terms of sweeping the parish church and of ringing the church bell&nbsp;paid rent within the meaning of the Limitation Act of 1833 (see&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Doe</span><span class="font1"> v. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Benham</span><span class="font1"> (1845), 7 Q.B. 976).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As to the apportionment of rents, see Apportionment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Payment of Rent.—</span><span class="font0">Rent is due in the morning of thc day appointed for payment, but a tenant is not in arrears until after&nbsp;midnight on that day. Rent made payable in advance&nbsp;by agreement between a landlord and his tenant is&nbsp;called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">forehand rent.</span><span class="font0"> It is not uncommon in letting&nbsp;a furnished house, or as to the last quarter of the&nbsp;term of a lease of unfurnished premises, to stipulate that the&nbsp;rent shall be paid in advance. As soon as such rent is payable&nbsp;under the agreement thc landlord has the same rights in regard&nbsp;to it as he has m the case of ordinary rent. If a tenant pays&nbsp;his rent before the day on which it is due, he runs the risk of&nbsp;being called upon in certain circumstances to pay it over again.&nbsp;Such a payment is an advance to the landlord, subject to an&nbsp;agreement that, when the rent becomes due, the advance shall be&nbsp;treated as a fulfilment of the tenant’s obligation to pay rent. The&nbsp;payment is, therefore, generally speaking, a defence to an action&nbsp;by the landlord or his heirs. But if the landlord mortgages his&nbsp;reversion, either before or after the advance, the assignee will,&nbsp;by giving notice to the tenant, before the proper rent-day, to pay&nbsp;rent to him, become entitled to the rent then falling due. Payment by cheque is conditional payment only, and if the cheque is&nbsp;dishonoured the original obligation revives. Where a cheque&nbsp;in payment of rent is lost in the course of transmission through&nbsp;the post, the loss falls on the tenant, unless the landlord has&nbsp;expressly or impliedly authorized it to be forwarded in that&nbsp;way: and the landlord’s consent to take the risk of such transmission will not be inferred from the fact that payments were&nbsp;ordinarily made in this manner in the dealings between the&nbsp;parties. A tenant may deduct from his rent (i) the “ landlord’s property tax ” (on the annual value of the premises for&nbsp;income tax purposes), which is paid by the tenant, if the statute&nbsp;imposing the tax authorizes thc deduction (which should be&nbsp;made from the rent next due after the payment); (ii) taxes or&nbsp;rates which the landlord had undertaken to pay but had not&nbsp;paid, payment having thereupon been made by the tenant; (iii)&nbsp;payments made by the tenant which ought to have been made&nbsp;by the landlord, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font0"> rent due to a superior landlord; (iv) compensation under the Agricultural Holdings Acts 1883-1900.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Remediesfor Non-payment of Rent.—</span><span class="font0">A landlord’s main reihedy for non-payment of rent is </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">distress</span><span class="font0"> (Lat. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">distringere,</span><span class="font0"> to draw&nbsp;asunder, detain, occupy), </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font0"> the right to seize all goods found&nbsp;upon the demised premises, whether those of the tenant or of&nbsp;a stranger, except goods specially privileged, and to detain and,&nbsp;if need be, to sell them, in satisfaction of his claim. The&nbsp;requisites of a valid distress are these: </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(a)</span><span class="font0"> There must be “ a&nbsp;certain and proper rent,” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font0"> rent due in respect of an actual&nbsp;tenancy of corporeal hereditaments: </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(b)</span><span class="font0"> the rent must be in&nbsp;arrear; (c) there must be a reversion in the person distraining; and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(d)</span><span class="font0"> there must bc goods on the premises liable to be&nbsp;distrained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">@@@<sup>1</sup>When peppercorn rents were instituted, in the middle ages, they were not, however, nominal, the cost of spices being then very&nbsp;great. A peppercorn rent, generally an obligation to pay 1 lb of&nbsp;pepper at the usual rent days, constituted a substantial impost&nbsp;even as late as the 18th century.</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
