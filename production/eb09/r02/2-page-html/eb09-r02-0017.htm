<p><span class="font1">continuous horizontal sheets of fibres in the ventral region, while for a greater or less extent longitudinal bundles of&nbsp;fibres underlie the vertebral bodies in different parts of the&nbsp;neck and trunk, and prolongations backwards of the dorsal&nbsp;and ventral muscles clothe the skeleton of the caudal&nbsp;region. Muscles like the temporal, masseter, pterygoid,&nbsp;and digastric of Mammals help to open and shut the jaws&nbsp;of Reptiles. Others descend from the dorsal region of the&nbsp;spine to the pectoral and pelvic girdles and to the limb&nbsp;bones, which latter are furnished with flexors and extensors, abductors and adductors, in essentially the same way&nbsp;as are the limbs of birds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There are two special deviations from this more normal type of structure. We find one of these in the Serpents,&nbsp;which, being limbless and without a neck, and requiring&nbsp;an extraordinary mobility in the parts of the axial skeleton, have the muscles which clothe the trunk raised to&nbsp;their highest degree of multiplication and differentiation.&nbsp;The other exceptional type is furnished us by the&nbsp;Chelonians, which, having a perfectly rigid body and long&nbsp;neck and limbs singularly situated, have the muscles of the&nbsp;trunk atrophied to an extreme degree, the neck richly&nbsp;supplied with muscles, and also the limbs, while the limb&nbsp;muscles are so strangely different, in either origin or insertion, from those of other animals that their true nature&nbsp;and correct designations do not seem as yet to admit of&nbsp;precise and accurate determination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Muscles of the Trunk and Tail.—In Saurians the caudal muscles often take the form of a series of hollow cones successively&nbsp;enclosed one within the other, while their continuations forward&nbsp;in the trunk become the longissimus dorsi, sacro-lumbalis, spinalis,&nbsp;levatores costarum, and the other muscles familiar to anatomists.&nbsp;Subvertebral continuations form muscles which proceed from the&nbsp;vertebral bodies to the inner surfaces of the ribs, which they tend&nbsp;to pull back—retrahentes costarum—and further forwards, such&nbsp;muscles as answer to the longus colli, rectus capitis, &amp;e., of&nbsp;Mammals. Ventral muscles take the form of the two obliques&nbsp;and transversalis, but the differentiation may be greater than in&nbsp;Mammals, as e.g., in Iguana, where the obliquus externus consists&nbsp;of three distinct layers. Tendinous or harder structures may&nbsp;produce a segmentation in the abdominal muscles, which, under&nbsp;special names, are prolonged to the hyoidian cornua and mandible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In Serpents the dorsal muscles are essentially the same as in Lizards, but are more developed, while small superficial muscles&nbsp;run from the ribs to the inside of the abdominal shields which are&nbsp;agents of locomotion. The limbless Serpent is practically somewhat like a Centipede, and moves by the successive protrusion and&nbsp;retraction of each pair of ribs, which serve as two feet. For each&nbsp;pair is attached to a ventral shield the edge of which is applied to&nbsp;and removed from the ground by the ribs attached to it, according&nbsp;as these are protruded or retracted—the shields thus serving as a&nbsp;number of small levers to propel the body along. The subvertebral&nbsp;muscle may also be very largely developed, as in Naja and Crotalus,&nbsp;the long hypapophyses of which have been already noted, and which&nbsp;serve for the attachment of such muscles. By their contraction&nbsp;the force of the downward flow of the poison fangs is greatly&nbsp;increased. That subvertebral series already mentioned as the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">retrahentes costarum is very extensively developed in the Ophidia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the Crocodilia arrangement is substantially as in Saurians, but the so-called abdominal ribs induce certain differences. Some&nbsp;muscles lie above, some below, and some between these “ribs.”&nbsp;Subvertebral muscles extend beneath the cervical and anterior&nbsp;dorsal vertebræ, and farther back there are retrahentes costarum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Hatteria has special muscles inserted into the distal expansions of its ribs, which may sometimes aid its motions in a very subordinate degree, as those of Serpents are so helped in the highest&nbsp;degree.@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the Chelonians the dorsal muscles are well developed in the neck and tail. Bifold muscles pass from within the hindmost&nbsp;lateral plates of the carapace to the dorsum of the caudal vertebræ.&nbsp;Other muscles extend between the articular and transverse processes of the caudal vertebræ. Dorsal muscles are entirely wanting&nbsp;in the thorax of Testudo, butin Emys and Chelydra a longitudinal&nbsp;muscle lies upon the transverse processes of the trunk vertebræ.&nbsp;In the neck there are a number of muscles extending with various&nbsp;degrees of complexity between the transverse and articular processes. The neck is retracted partly by a muscle passing from it&nbsp;to the procoracoid and partly by a long muscle passing to the&nbsp;head and neck from a greater or less number of the spines and&nbsp;neural arches of the more posterior trunk vertebræ. Pyramidal&nbsp;muscles pass from the pelvis to the plastron, and oblique muscles&nbsp;arise from inside the costal marginal plates of the carapace and&nbsp;pass to the pelvis and plastron, and a transversalis extends from&nbsp;within the costal plates and also passes to the plastron. Λ diaphragm springs from the bodies of certain dorsal vertebræ and&nbsp;one or more ribs, and invests the surface of the lungs.</span></p><div>

<p><span class="font0">The Muscles of the Head.—In ordinary Saurians, the temporal muscle is embraced by the upper (in them the only) zygomatic&nbsp;arch, and descends from the side of the head to the coronoid process&nbsp;of the mandible. The masseter takes origin from the quadrate and&nbsp;columella. Of the two pterygoid muscles one arises from the upper&nbsp;surface of the pterygoid bone and the other from the os transversum.&nbsp;The digastric descends from the hinder part of the cranium to the&nbsp;posterior end of the mandible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the Ophidia the muscular apparatus is much more complex, as might be predicted from the great mobility of their jaws. There&nbsp;are on each side three elevators and several depressors of the lower&nbsp;jaw, and sometimes, as, e.g., in Trigonoeephahis, a muscular belly&nbsp;connected with one of the elevators is so arranged as to be able to&nbsp;compress the poison gland. In poisonous Serpents also a tendon&nbsp;goes from the external pterygoid to the short maxilla, so that the&nbsp;latter can be erected by its intervention. The Suspensorium is&nbsp;drawn upwards and backwards by a muscle arising from the neural&nbsp;spines of the anterior trunk vertebræ, and downwards and forwards&nbsp;by another arising from the basisphenoid. Four other muscles on&nbsp;either side of the head are devoted to moving the palatine apparatus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Crocodilia have a temporalis, an internal and external pterygoid, and a digastric. There are also a pair of sternomandi-bular muscles, and of hyomandibulars (from the cornua of the&nbsp;hyoid), a pair of genioglossi, and a superficial mylohyoid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Chelonia have only an internal pterygoid, besides the temporal and digastric. But they have also a geniohyoid and genioglossus&nbsp;as well as a mylohyoid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Muscles of the Pectoral Girdle and Limb.—In ordinary Saurians and in Crocodiles the scapula is drawn forwards and&nbsp;upwards by a trapezius and levator, and there are also a serratus&nbsp;magnus and a sternoscapular muscle, a cleidomastoid or sterno-mastoid, and generally an omohyoid. In the Chelonia the&nbsp;shoulder-girdle muscles are very reduced and peculiar, and no&nbsp;muscle draws it towards the skull, but a muscle arises from the&nbsp;sides of the cervical vertebræ and is inserted into the scapula.&nbsp;Another (smaller) passes from the second dorsal transverse process and the part of the carapace therewith connected to the&nbsp;scapula, which it draws backwards. Another muscle goes from the&nbsp;coracoid to the hyoid, and yet another—a sort of sternomastoid—&nbsp;from the plastron to the skull.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Lacertilians have an ordinary pectoralis and generally a subjacent small muscle passing from the coracoid to the great tuberosity ol&nbsp;the humerus. There is a latissimus dorsi going to the lesser&nbsp;tuberosity and a large subscapularis. A triceps ends by a tendon&nbsp;inserted into the olecranon, often containing an ossicle analogous&nbsp;to a patella. There is also a biceps, coracobrachial is and brachialis,&nbsp;anticus, with other Mammalian muscles, flexors, and extensors of&nbsp;the digits, with even lumbrieal muscles, but not with that perfect&nbsp;arrangement of perforating and perforated tendons which characterizes the highest class.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The muscles of the pectoral limb of Crocodiles, though showing many minor differences from those of Saurians, yet present a&nbsp;fundamental general resemblance to the latter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is otherwise with Chelonians. In them the pectoralis major is represented by two muscles, one a muscle extending from the&nbsp;median plastron plate and external border of the carapace to the&nbsp;inner of the two tuberosities of the humerus, and another muscle&nbsp;inserted beside the former and taking rise from the most anterior&nbsp;plate of the plastron. There is also a superior pectoralis, which&nbsp;arises from the coracoid and coracoacromial ligaments, and which&nbsp;is partly inserted into the same tuberosity and partly extends&nbsp;beyond it. There are also a coracobrachialis and a deltoid, but no&nbsp;suprascapular. All the muscles which arise from the scapula are&nbsp;inserted into the external tuberosity of the humerus. There is a&nbsp;muscle which represents the latissimus dorsi. It arises beneath&nbsp;the most anterior plate of the carapace, and is inserted into the&nbsp;external tuberosity. The muscles of the forearm and extremity&nbsp;are less exceptional.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Muscles of the Pelvic Girdle and Limb.—In Lacertilians there are several hind-limb muscles which have a subcaudal origin; some of&nbsp;these end at the thigh, while others extend to the feet. There are&nbsp;numerous flexors of the leg. A powerful muscle arises beneath the&nbsp;tail, and is inserted hy a broad tendon into the femur. From the&nbsp;inferior margin of that tendon another slender tendon arises,&nbsp;sometimes ending (as, e.g., in Iguana) in the interarticular cartilage&nbsp;of the knee-joint. The muscles of the thigh, leg, and foot have a&nbsp;general similarity to those of Mammals generally, as have those of&nbsp;the arm and hand, but those which represent the ham-string muscles&nbsp;have generally much complexity and intricacy of arrangement of</span></p>
