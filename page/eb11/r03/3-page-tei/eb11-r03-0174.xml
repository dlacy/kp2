His father was a lawyer and councillor of the high court of justice. In 1845 he became professor of mineralogy and geology at Clausthal, and in 1862 director of the School of Mines. He first described the Cretaceous and Jurassic strata of Germany in elaborate works entitled <hi rend="italic">Die Versteinerungen des Norddeutschen Oolithen-gebirges</hi>  (1836-39), <hi rend="italic">Die Versteinerungen des Norddeutschen KreiAegebirgcs</hi>  (1S40-1841) and <hi rend="italic">Die Versteinerungen des Harzgebirges</hi>  (1843). He died at Clausthal on the 25th of November 1869.</p><p>His brother, <hi rend="smallcaps">Carl Ferdinand von Roemer</hi>  (1818-1891), who had been educated for the legal profession at Göttingen, also became interested in geology, and abandoning law in 1840, studied science at the university of Berlin, where he graduated Ph.D. in 1842. Two years later he published his first work, <hi rend="italic">Das Rheinische Übergangsgebirge</hi>  (1844), in which he dealt with the older rocks and fossils. In 1845 he paid a visit to America, and devoted a year and a half to a careful study of the geology of Texas and other Southern states. He published at Bonn in 1849 a general work entitled <hi rend="italic">Texas, </hi>while the results of his investigations of the Cretaceous rocks and fossils were published three years later in a treatise, <hi rend="italic">Die KreiAebilAungen von Texas und ihre organischen Einschlüsse </hi>(1852), which included also a general account of the geology, and gained for him the title “ Father of the geology of Texas.” Subsequently he published at Breslau <hi rend="italic">Die Silurische Fauna des westlichen Tennessee</hi>  (i860). During the preparation of these works he was from 1847 to 1855 “ privat-docent ” at Bonn, and was then appointed professor of geology, palaeontology and mineralogy in the university of Breslau, a post which he held with signal success as a teacher until his death. As a palaeontologist he made important contributions to our knowledge especially of the invertebrata of the Devonian and older rocks. He assisted H. G. Bronn with the third edition of the <hi rend="italic">Lethaea geognostica</hi>  (1851-56), and subsequently he laboured on an enlarged and revised edition, of which he published one section, <hi rend="italic">Lethaea palaeozoica</hi>  (1876-1883). In 1862 he was called on to superintend the preparation of a geological map of Upper Silesia, and the results of his researches were embodied in his <hi rend="italic">Geologie von Oberschlesien </hi>(3 vols., 1870). As a mineralogist he was likewise well known, more particularly by his practical teachings and by the collection he formed in the Museum at Breslau. He died at Breslau on the 14th of December 1891.</p><p>ROEMER, OLE (Latinized <hi rend="smallcaps">Olaus)</hi>  (1644-1710), Danish astronomer, was born <hi rend="bold">at </hi>Aarhuus in Jutland on the 25th of September 1644. He became in 1662 the pupil and amanuensis of Erasmus Bartholinus at Copenhagen, and assisted J. Picard in 1671 to determine the geographical position of Tycho Brahe’s observatory (Uraniborg on the island of Hveen). In 1672 he accompanied Picard to Paris, where he remained nine years, occupied with observations at the new royal observatory and hydraulic works at Versailles and Marly. On the 22nd of November 1675 he read a paper before the Academy on the successive propagation of light as revealed by a certain inequality in the motion of the first of Jupiter’s satellites. A scientific mission to England in 1679 made him acquainted with Newton, Halley and Flamsteed. In 1681, on the summons of Christian V., king of Denmark, he returned to Copenhagen as royal mathematician and professor of astronomy in the university ; and from 1688 he discharged, besides, many important administrative functions, including those of mayor (1705), chief of police and privy councillor. He died at Copenhagen on the 23rd of September 1710.</p><p>Roemer will always be remembered as the discoverer of the finite velocity of light. He showed besides wonderful ingenuity in the improvement of astronomical apparatus. The first transit instrument worthy the name was in 1690 erected in his house. In the same year he set up in the university observatory an instrument with altitude and azimuth circles (for observing equal altitudes on both sides of the meridian) and an equatorial telescope. In 1704 he built, at his own cost, the so-called “ Tusculan ” observatory at Vridlosemagle, a few miles west of Copenhagen, and equipped it with a meridian circle (the transit instrument and vertical circle combined) and a transit moving in the prime vertical. Roemer thus effectively realized nearly all our modern instruments of precision, and accumulated with them a large mass of observations, all of which unfortunately perished in the great conflagration of the 21st of October 1728, except the three nights’ work discussed by J. G. Galle (O. <hi rend="italic">Roemeri triduum observationum astronomic carum a. 1706 institutarum,</hi>  Berlin, 1845).</p><p>See E.

(1900) 12,348. The old fortifications have been dismantled and partlyconverted into fine promenades. At this point the Maas is crossed by a bridge erected in 1866-67, <hi rend="sup">an</hi>^ the Roer by one dating from 1771, replacing an older structure, and connecting Roermond with the suburb of St Jacob. Roermond is the seat of a Roman Catholic episcopal see. The finest building in the town is the Romanesque minster church of the first quarter of the 13th century. In the middle of the nave is the tomb of Gerhard III., count of Gelderland, and his wife Margaret of Brabant. It was formerly the church of a Cistercian nunnery, and in modern times has been elaborately restored. The cathedral of St Christopher is also of note; on the top of the tower (246 ft.) is a copper statue of the saint, and the interior is adorned with paintings by Rubens, Jacob de Wit (1695-1754) and others. The Reformed church was once the chapel of the monastery of the AIinorites. There is also a Redemptorist chapel. The old bishop’s palace is now the courthouse, and the old Jesuits* monastery with its fine gardens a higher-burgher school. Woollen, cotton, silk and mixed stuffs, paper, flour and beer are manufactured at Roermond.</p><p>Close to Roermond on the west is the village of Hom, once the seat of a lordship of the same name, which is first mentioned in a document of 1166. The lordship of Hom was a fief of the counts of Loon, and after 1361·of the bishop of Liège; but in 1450 it was raised to a countship by the Emperor Frederick II. On the extinction of the house of Hom in 1540, the countship passed to the famous Philip of AIontmorency, who, with the count of Egmont, was executed in Bmssels in 1568 by order of the duke of Alva. In the beginning of the next century the countship was forcihly retained by the see of Liège, and was incorporated in the French department of the Lower Maas at the end of the 18th century. The ancient castle is in an excellent state of preservation and is sometimes used for the assembly of the states.</p><p>ROGATION DAYS (Lat. <hi rend="italic">rogatio,</hi>  from <hi rend="italic">rogare,</hi>  to beseech; the equivalent of Gr.
