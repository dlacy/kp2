<p><span class="font1">Lermontov. During the last generation of the 19th century most of the Titans of her literature departed, and cannot be said to have&nbsp;left successors of equal merit. Dostoievskiy, Pisemskiy, Turgeniev,&nbsp;Goncharov, Ostrovskiy and Saltikov followed each other to the grave&nbsp;in rapid succession. Leo Tolstoy alone remained, a veritable&nbsp;patriarch, whose views on life gave him a world-interest beyond&nbsp;even the contributions of his great prose fiction. In 1895 Apukhtin,&nbsp;author of many graceful lyrics, died; in 1897 Apollon Maikov, and&nbsp;soon afterwards Polonskiy. These men were well known throughout&nbsp;Russia. A new school of poets has sprung up, consisting for the&nbsp;most part of the so-called decadents and symbolists. Among them&nbsp;may be mentioned A. Korinfskiy; Ivan Bunin, who has published&nbsp;an excellent translation of Longfellow’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hiawatha</span><span class="font1">; and Constantine&nbsp;Balmont. The last of these has given to the public several volumes&nbsp;of lyrics, many of which exhibit a graceful imagination. He has&nbsp;been a successful translator of Shelley, and of Edgar Allan Poe,&nbsp;Ibsen and Calderon. We. must also mention V. Briusov and</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">K. Sluchevskiy, Mme. Gippius-Merezhkovskaya and Mme. Myrrha&nbsp;Lokhvitskaya. Excellent historical novels have been written by&nbsp;Merezhkovskiy (Merejkovsky (?.v.)). The drama is not in <sub>t</sub>a&nbsp;flourishing condition. Very little of merit has been produced&nbsp;since the great trilogy (1866-69) of Alexis Tolstoy dealing with&nbsp;the reign of Ivan the Terrible—full of picturesque horrors For the&nbsp;dramatist—and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bourgeois</span><span class="font1"> comedies of Ostrovskiy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If we turn to history, in which the Russians have always shown considerable talent, we can cite some really good work. We cannot&nbsp;here find room to discuss the memoirs and other documents which&nbsp;appear in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Russian Antiquary (Russkaya Starina),</span><span class="font1"> the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Historical&nbsp;Messenger (Istoricheskiy Viestnik)</span><span class="font1"> and other journals, the name of&nbsp;which is legion. In 1897 Professor Bestuzhev-Riumin, of the&nbsp;university of St Petersburg, died. He had held his chair of history&nbsp;since 1865. His valuable </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">History of Russia</span><span class="font1"> must now remain a&nbsp;torso only, the first volume and the first half of the second having&nbsp;alone appeared. Soloviev and Kostomarov are dead. The famous&nbsp;school 01 Russian historians is thus almost extinct. But some&nbsp;excellent writers in this department have come to the front. Professor Miliukov has started his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sketches of the History of Russian&nbsp;Culture (Ocherki po istorii russkoi kulturi),</span><span class="font1"> which has been much read.&nbsp;Professor Bilbasov wrote a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">History of Catherine II.</span><span class="font1"> and N. Shilder a&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Life of Alexander I.</span><span class="font1"> D. Evarnitskiy has added a third volume to his&nbsp;interesting work on theZaporozhian Cossacks. The Russians have&nbsp;always enjoyed a considerable reputation as memoir-writers, and&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Recollections of Mme. Smirnov,</span><span class="font1"> which first appeared in the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Northern Messenger (Sieverny Viestnik),</span><span class="font1"> proved very interesting.&nbsp;Pushkin appears here before us in the most minute details of his&nbsp;everydayjife. The centenary of his birth (1899) was signalized by&nbsp;the publication of many interesting monographs on his strange&nbsp;career. The details furnished by his nephew, L. Pavlistchev, were&nbsp;especially noteworthy. The second volume appeared of the classical&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">History of the Russian Church,</span><span class="font1"> by E. Golubinskiy. A valuable contribution to early Russian history was furnished by the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Legal Antiquities fYuridicheskia Drevnosti)*oi</span><span class="font1"> V. Serguievich, by which quite&nbsp;a new light has been thrown upon the Russian </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sobor.</span><span class="font1"> The well-known savant, Maxi me Kovalevs kiy, published the second volume&nbsp;of his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Economic Development of Europe to the Rise of Capitalism.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">N. Rozhkov wrote an important work entitled </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Village Economy in&nbsp;Muscovy in the Sixteenth Century.</span><span class="font1"> This book analyses the conditions&nbsp;under which economic production was developed in Old Russia.&nbsp;S.. Platonov published a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">History of the Insurrections in Russia in the&nbsp;Sixteenth ana Seventeenth Centuries.</span><span class="font1"> He holds entirely new views&nbsp;on the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">oprichina,</span><span class="font1"> the famous bodyguard of Ivan the Terrible.&nbsp;Professor B. Kliuchevskiy, of the university of Moscow, published in&nbsp;1883 a valuable book on the Russian Duma, as the privy council&nbsp;of the emperors was called, and in 1899 he issued his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Aids to Lectures&nbsp;on Russian History.</span><span class="font1"> Russian writers have not often devoted themselves to the political and social conditions of other countries, but&nbsp;an exception must be made in the case of the books by Professor&nbsp;Vinogradov, formerly of Moscow, notably his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Investigations into the&nbsp;Social History of England in the Middle Ages</span><span class="font1"> (1887). The learned&nbsp;author, who was called to Oxford as Corpus professor of jurisprudence, also prepared an edition of this work for the English&nbsp;public. In fiction no new writers appeared of equal calibre to Gogol,&nbsp;Turgeniev, Dostoievskiy and Tolstoy. But A. Chekhov showed&nbsp;considerable power in his short stories. Some of the tales of Gorki&nbsp;(j.v.), Ertel and Yasinskiy are also of great merit. The brilliant&nbsp;Garshin died insane in 1888.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A few words must be said on the literature of the Russian dialects, the Little and White Russian. The Little Russian is rich in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">skazki&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(tales) and songs. Peculiar to them is the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">duma,</span><span class="font1"> a narrative poem which corresponds in many particulars with the&nbsp;Russian </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bylina.*</span><span class="font1"> Since the commencement of the 19th&nbsp;century, the Little. Russian </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">dumy</span><span class="font1"> have been repeatedly&nbsp;edited, as by Maksimovich Metlinskiy and others, and an&nbsp;elaborate edition was undertaken by Dragomanov and</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Antonovich. Just as the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">byliny</span><span class="font1"> of the Great Russians, so also these </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">dumy</span><span class="font1"> of the Little Russians admit of classification, and they have&nbsp;been divided by their latest editors as follows: (1) the songs of&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">druzhina,</span><span class="font1"> treating of the early princes and their followers;&nbsp;(2) the Cossack period </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Kozachestvo),</span><span class="font1"> in which the Cossacks are&nbsp;found in continual warfare with the Polish </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pans</span><span class="font1"> and the attempts&nbsp;of the Jesuits to introduce the Roman Catholic religion; (3) the&nbsp;period of the Haidamaks, who formed the nucleus of the national&nbsp;party, and prolonged the struggle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The foundation of the Little Russian literature (written, as opposed to the oral) was laid by Ivan Kotliarevskiy (1769-1838),&nbsp;■whose travesty of part of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Aeneid</span><span class="font1"> enjoys great popularity among&nbsp;some of his countrymen. Others, however, object to it as tending&nbsp;to bring the language or dialect into ridicule. A truly national&nbsp;poet appeared in Taras Shevchenko, born at the village of Kirilovka,&nbsp;in the government of Kiev, in the condition of a serf. The strange&nbsp;adventures of his early life he has told us in his autobiography.&nbsp;He did not get his freedom till some time after he had reached&nbsp;manhood, when he was purchased from his master by the generous&nbsp;efforts of the poet Zhukovskiy and others. Besides poetry, he&nbsp;occupied himself with painting, with considerable success. He&nbsp;unfortunately became obnoxious to the government, and was&nbsp;punished with exile to Siberia from 1847 to 1857. He did not&nbsp;long survive, his return, dying in 1861, aged forty-six. No one has&nbsp;described with greater vigour than Shevchenko the old days of&nbsp;the Ukraine. In his youth he listened to the village traditions&nbsp;handed down by the priests, and he has faithfully reproduced them.&nbsp;In the powerful poem entitled </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Haidamak</span><span class="font1"> we have a graphic picture&nbsp;of the horrors enacted by Gonta and his followers at Uman. The&nbsp;funeral of the poet was a vast public procession; a great cairn,&nbsp;surmounted with a cross, was raised over his remains, where he lies&nbsp;buried near Kan io v on the banks of the Dnieper. His grave has&nbsp;been styled the “ Mecca of the South Russian Revolutionists.”&nbsp;A complete edition of his works, with interesting biographical&nbsp;notices—one contributed by the novelist Turgeniev—appeared at&nbsp;Prague in 1876. Besides the national songs, excellent collections&nbsp;of the South Russian folk-tales have appeared, edited by Dragomanov, Rudchenko, and others. Many of these are still recited&nbsp;by the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">tchumaki,</span><span class="font1"> or wandering pedlars. A valuable work is the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Zapiski 0 Yuzhnoy Rossii</span><span class="font1"> (“ Papers on Southern Russia ”), published&nbsp;at St Petersburg in 1857 by Panteleimon Kulish. After he got into&nbsp;trouble (with Kostomarov and Shevchenko) for his political views,&nbsp;the late works of this author show him to have undergone a complete&nbsp;change. Other writers using the Little Russian language are&nbsp;Marko-Vovchok (that is, Madame Eugenia Markovich) and Yuri&nbsp;Fedkovich, who employs a dialect of Bukovina. Fedkovich, like&nbsp;Shevchenko, sprang from a peasant family, and served as a soldier&nbsp;in the Austrian army against the French during the Italian campaign.&nbsp;Naturally we find his poems filled with descriptions of life in the&nbsp;camp. Like the Croat Preradovii, he began writing poetry in the&nbsp;German language, till he was turned into more natural paths by&nbsp;some patriotic friends. A collection of songs of Bukovina was&nbsp;published at Kiev in 1875 by Lonachevskiy. Eugene Zelechovskiy&nbsp;compiled a valuable </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dictionary of Little Russian.</span><span class="font1"> There is a good&nbsp;grammar by Osadtsa, a pupil of Miklosich.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the White Russian dialect are to be found only a few songs, with the exception of portions of the Scriptures and some legal&nbsp;documents. A valuable dictionary has been published&nbsp;by Nosovich, but this is one of the most neglected of the&nbsp;Russian dialects. Collections of White Russian songs have&nbsp;been published by Shein and others.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">RUSSO-JAPANESE WAR, 1904-5. The seizure by Russia of the Chinese fortress of Port Arthur, which she had a few&nbsp;years previously, in concert with other powers, compelled Japan&nbsp;to relinquish, was from the Russian point of view the logical&nbsp;outcome of her eastward expansion and her need for an ice-free&nbsp;harbour on the Pacific. The extension of the Trans-Siberian&nbsp;railway through Manchuria to Port Arthur and a large measure&nbsp;of influence in Manchuria followed equally naturally. But the&nbsp;whole course of this expansion had been watched with suspicion by Japan, from the time of the Saghalien incident of 1875,&nbsp;when the island power, then barely emerging from the feudal&nbsp;age, had to cede her half of the island to Russia, to the Shimono-seki treaty of 1895, when the powers compelled her to forego&nbsp;the profits of her victory over China. The subsequent occupation&nbsp;of Port Arthur and other Chinese harbours by European powers,&nbsp;and the evident intention of consolidating Russian influence in&nbsp;Manchuria, were again and again the subject of Japanese representations </span><span class="font0">at </span><span class="font2">St Petersburg, and these representations became&nbsp;more vigorous when, in 1903, Russia seemed to be about to extend&nbsp;her Manchurian policy into Korea.
