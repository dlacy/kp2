RABIRIUS
(C.) a Roman knight, who lent an im-menfe sum of money to Ptolemy Auletes king of Egypt. The monarch afterwards not only refused to repay him, but even confined him, and endangered his life. Rabi-rius escaped from Egypt with difficulty ; but at his re-turn to Rome he was accused by the senate of having lent money to an African prince for unlawful purposes. He was ably defended by Cicero, and acquitted with difficulty.—There was a Latin poet of the same name in the age of Augustus. He wrote a poem on the victory which the emperor had gained over Antony at Actium. Seneca has compared him to virgil for ele-gance and majesty ; but Quintilian is not fo favourable to his poetry. —And there was an architect in the reign of Domitian, called
Rabirius.
He built a celebrated palace for the emperor, of which the ruins are still feen at Rome.
