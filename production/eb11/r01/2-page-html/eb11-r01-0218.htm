<p><span class="font1">conceived them is found in his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dictatus.</span><span class="font1"> The bishop of Rome, who enjoys a unique title, that of “ pope,” may annul the&nbsp;decrees of all other powers, since he judges all but is judged by&nbsp;none. He may depose emperors and absolve the subjects of&nbsp;the unjust from their allegiance. Gregory’s position was almost&nbsp;inexpugnable at a time when it was conceded by practically all&nbsp;that spiritual concerns were incalculably more momentous than secular, that the Church was rightly one and indivisible, with&nbsp;one divinely revealed faith and a system of sacraments absolutely&nbsp; essential to salvation.. No one called in question the&nbsp;claim of the clergy to control completely all “ spiritual ” matters.&nbsp;Moreover, the mightiest secular ruler was but a poor sinner&nbsp;dependent for his eternal welfare on the Church and its head,&nbsp;the pope, who in this way necessarily exercised an indirect&nbsp;control over the civil government, which even the emperor&nbsp;Henry IV. and William the Conqueror would not have been&nbsp;disposed to deny. They would also have conceded the pope&nbsp;the right to play the rôle of a secular ruler in his own lands, as&nbsp;did the German bishops, and to dispose of such fiefs as reverted&nbsp;to him. This dass of prerogatives, as well as the right which&nbsp;the pope claimed to ratify the election of the emperor, need not&nbsp;detain us, although they doubtless served in the long run to&nbsp;weaken the papal power. But the pope laid claim to a direct&nbsp;power over the civil governments. Nicholas II. (1058-1061)&nbsp;declared that Jesus had conferred on Peter the control </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(jura)&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">of an earthly as well as of a heavenly empire; and this phrase&nbsp;was embodied in the canon law. Innocent III., a century and&nbsp;a half later, taught that James the brother of the Lord left to&nbsp;Peter not only the government of the whole Church, but that&nbsp;of the whole world (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">totum seculum gubernandum</span><span class="font1">).</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">@@<sup>1</sup> </span><span class="font1">So the&nbsp;power of the pope no longer rested upon his headship of the&nbsp;Church or his authority as a secular prince, but on a far more&nbsp;comprehensive claim to universal dominion. There was no&nbsp;reason why the bishop of Rome should justify such acts as&nbsp;Innocent himself performed in deposing King John of England&nbsp;and later in annulling Magna Carta; or Gregory IV. when he&nbsp;struck out fourteen articles from the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sachsenspiegel·,</span><span class="font1"> or&nbsp;Nicholas V. when he invested Portugal with the right to subjugate&nbsp; all peoples on the Atlantic coast; or Julius II. when&nbsp;he threatened to transfer the kingdom of France to England;&nbsp;or the conduct of those later pontiffs who condemned the&nbsp;treaties of Westphalia, the Austrian constitution of 1867 and&nbsp;the establishment of the kingdom of Italy. The theory and&nbsp;practice of papal absolutism was successfully promulgated&nbsp;by Gratian in his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Decretum,</span><span class="font1"> completed at Bologna about 1142.&nbsp;This was supplemented by later collections composed mainly&nbsp;of papal decretals. (See Canon Law and Decretals, False.)&nbsp;As every fully equipped university had its faculty of canon&nbsp;law in which the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Corpus juris canonici</span><span class="font1"> was studied, Rashdall&nbsp;is hardly guilty of exaggeration when he says: “ By means&nbsp;of the happy thought of the Bolognese monk the popes were&nbsp;enabled to convert the new-born universities—the offspring&nbsp;of that intellectual new birth of Europe which might have&nbsp;been so formidable an enemy to the papal pretensions—into&nbsp;so many engines for the propagation of Ultramontane ideas.”&nbsp;Thomas Aquinas was the first theologian to describe the Church&nbsp;as a divinely organized absolute monarchy, whose head concentrated&nbsp; in his person the entire authority of the Church, and&nbsp;was the source </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font1">all the ecclesiastical law (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">conditor juris),&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">issuing the decrees of general councils in his own name, and&nbsp;claiming the right to revoke or modify the decrees of former&nbsp;councils—indeed, to make exceptions or to set aside altogether&nbsp;anything which did not rest upon the dictates of divine or&nbsp;natural law. In practice the whose of western Europe was&nbsp;subject to the jurisdiction of one tribunal of last resort, the&nbsp;Roman Curia. The pope claimed the right to tax church&nbsp;property throughout Christendom. He was able to exact an&nbsp;oath of fidelity from the archbishops, named many of the&nbsp;bishops, and asserted the right to transfer and dispose them.&nbsp;The organs of this vast monarchy were the papal Curia, which&nbsp;first appears distinctly in the 11th century (see Curia Romana),</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">and the legates, who visited the courts of Europe as haughty representatives of the central government of Christendom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It should always be remembered that the law of the Church was regarded by all lawyers in the later middle ages as the law&nbsp;common to alI Europe (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus commune).</span><span class="font1"> The laws of&nbsp;the Carolingian empire provided that one excommunicated by the Church who did not make his peace&nbsp;within a year and a day should be outlawed, and this&nbsp;general principle was not lost sight of. It was a capital&nbsp;offence in the eyes of the State to disagree with the teachings&nbsp;of the Church, and these, it must be remembered, included&nbsp;a recognition of the papal supremacy. The civil authorities&nbsp;burnt an obstinate heretic, condemned by the Church, without a&nbsp;thought of a new trial. The emperor Frederick II.’s edicts and&nbsp;the so-called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">établissements</span><span class="font1"> of St Louis provide that the civil&nbsp;officers should search out suspected heretics and deliver them&nbsp;to the ecclesiastical judges. The civil government recognized&nbsp;monastic vows by regarding a professed monk as civilly dead and&nbsp;by pursuing him and returning him to his monastery if he&nbsp;violated his pledges of obedience and ran away. The State&nbsp;recognized the ecclesiastical tribunals and accorded them a&nbsp;wide jurisdiction that we should now deem essentially secular&nbsp;in its nature. The State also admitted that large classes of&nbsp;its citizens—the clergy, students, crusaders, widows and the&nbsp;miserable and helpless in general—were justiceable only by&nbsp;Church tribunals. By the middle of the 13th century many&nbsp;lawyers took the degree of doctor of both laws (J.U.D.), civil&nbsp;and canon, and practised both. As is well known, temporal&nbsp;rulers constantly selected clergymen as their most trusted&nbsp;advisers. The existence of this theocratic international state&nbsp;was of course conditioned by the weakness of the civil government&nbsp;. So long as feudal monarchy continued, the Church&nbsp;supplied to some extent the deficiencies of the turbulent and&nbsp;ignorant princes by endeavouring to maintain order, administer&nbsp;justice, protect the weak and encourage learning. So soon as&nbsp;the modern national state began to gain strength, the issue&nbsp;between secular rulers and the bishops of Rome took a new form.&nbsp;The clergy naturally stoutly defended the powers which they&nbsp;had long enjoyed and believed to be rightly theirs. On the&nbsp;other hand, the State, which could count upon the support of an&nbsp;ever-increasing number of prosperous and loyal subjects, sought&nbsp;to protect its own interests and showed itself less and less&nbsp;inclined to tolerate the extreme claims of the pope. Moreover,&nbsp;owing to the spread of education, the king was no longer obliged&nbsp;to rely mainly upon the assistance of the clergy in conducting&nbsp;his government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The chief sources of friction between Church and State were four in number. First, the growth of the practice of “reservation ” and “ provision,” by which the popes assumed the right&nbsp;to appoint their own nominees to vacant sees and other benefices,&nbsp;in defiance of the claims of the crown, the chapters and private&nbsp;patrons. In the case of wealthy bishoprics or abbacies this&nbsp;involved a serious menace to the secular authority. Both pope&nbsp;and king were naturally anxious to place their own friends and&nbsp;supporters in these influential positions. The pope, moreover,&nbsp;had come to depend to a considerable extent for his revenue&nbsp;upon the payments made by his nominees, which represented&nbsp;a corresponding drain on the resources of the secular states.&nbsp;Secondly, there was the great question, how far the lands and&nbsp;other property of the clergy should be subject to taxation. Was&nbsp;this vast amount of property to increase indefinitely without&nbsp;contribution to the maintenance of the secular government?&nbsp;A decretal of Innocent III. permitted the clergy to make&nbsp;voluntary contributions to the king when there was urgent&nbsp;necessity, and the resources of the laity had proved inadequate.&nbsp;But the pope maintained that, except in the most critical cases,&nbsp;his consent must be obtained for such grants. Thirdly, there&nbsp;was the inevitable jealousy between the secular and ecclesiastical&nbsp;courts and the serious problem of the exact extent of the original&nbsp;and appellate jurisdiction of the Roman Curia. Fourthly, and&nbsp;lastly, there was the most fundamental difficulty of all, the&nbsp;extent to which the pope, as the universally acknowledged head</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
