<p><span class="font0">The name of Rudolstadt occurs in an inventory of the possessions of the abbey of Hcrsfeld in the year 800. After passing&nbsp;through the possession of the German emperor and of the rulers of&nbsp;Orlamiinde and AVeimar, it came into the hands of the dukes of&nbsp;Schwarzburg in 1355. Its town rights were confirmed in 1404 ; and&nbsp;since 1599 it has been the residence of the ruling house.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RUFF, a bird so called from the very beautiful and remarkable frill of elongated feathers that, just before the&nbsp;breeding-season, grow thickly round the neck of the male,&nbsp;who is considerably larger than the female, known as the&nbsp;Reeve. In many respects this species, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tmnga&nbsp;pugnαx</span><span class="font1"> of Linnæus and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Machetes pugnax</span><span class="font1"> of the&nbsp;majority of modern ornithologists, is one of the most&nbsp;singular in existence, and yet its singularities have been&nbsp;very ill appreciated by zoological writers in general.@@<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>These singularities would require almost a volume to</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">describe properly. The best account of them is unquestionably that given in 1813 by Montagu </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Suppl. On. Dictionary),</span><span class="font1"> who seems to have been particularly struck by&nbsp;the extraordinary peculiarities of the species, and, to&nbsp;investigate them, expressly visited the fens of Lincolnshire,&nbsp;possibly excited thereto by the example of Pennant, whose&nbsp;information, personally collected there in 1769, was of a&nbsp;kind to provoke further inquiry, while Daniel </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Rural&nbsp;Sports,</span><span class="font1"> iii. p. 234) had added some other particulars, and&nbsp;subsequently Graves in 1816 repeated in the same district&nbsp;the experience of his predecessors. Since that time the&nbsp;great changes produced by the drainage of the fen-country&nbsp;have banished this species from nearly the whole of it, so&nbsp;that Lubbock </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Obs. Fauna of Norfolk,</span><span class="font1"> pp. 68-73) and Mr&nbsp;Stevenson </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Birds of Norfolk,</span><span class="font1"> ii. pp. 261—271) can alone&nbsp;be cited as modern witnesses of its habits in England,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@1</sup> Mr Darwin, though frequently citing ( </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Descent of Man and Sexual&nbsp;Selection,</span><span class="font0"> i. pp. 270, 306 ; ii. pp. 41, 42, 48, 81, 84, 100, 111) the&nbsp;Ruff as a witness in various capacities, most unfortunately seems&nbsp;never to have had its peculiarities presented to him in such a form&nbsp;that he could fully perceive their bearings. However, the significance&nbsp;of the lesson that the Ruff may teach was hardly conceivable before&nbsp;he began to write ; but the fact is not the less to be regretted that&nbsp;he never elucidated its importance, not only in regard to “ Sexual&nbsp;Selection,” but more especially with respect to “Polymorphism.”&nbsp;He appears not to have consulted Montagu’s original account of this&nbsp;bird, and seems to have known it only by the excerpt given by&nbsp;Macgillivray, in which were not included the important passages on&nbsp;the extreme diversity of plumage exhibited by the males—that author&nbsp;passing over this wonderful peculiarity in a paragraph of less than a&nbsp;score of lines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">while the trade of netting or snaring Ruffs, and fattening them for the table has for many years practically ceased.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The cock-bird, when out of his nuptial attire, or, to use the fenman’s expression, when he has not “ his show on,”&nbsp;and the hen at all seasons, offer no very remarkable&nbsp;deviation from ordinary Sandpipers, and outwardly<sup>2</sup> there&nbsp;is nothing, except the unequal size of the two sexes, to&nbsp;rouse suspicion of any abnormal peculiarity. But when&nbsp;spring comes all is changed. In a surprisingly short time&nbsp;the feathers clothing the face of the male are shed, and&nbsp;their place is taken by </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">papillæ</span><span class="font1"> or small caruncles of bright&nbsp;yellow or pale pink. From each side of his head sprouts&nbsp;a tuft of stiff curled feathers, giving the appearance of&nbsp;long ears, while the feathers of the throat change colour,&nbsp;and beneath and around it sprouts the frill or ruff already&nbsp;mentioned as giving the bird his name. The feathers&nbsp;which form this remarkable adornment, quite unique&nbsp;among birds, are, like those of the “ ear-tufts,” stiff and&nbsp;incurved at the end, but much longer—measuring more&nbsp;than two inches. They are closely arrayed, capable of&nbsp;depression or elevation, and form a shield to the front of&nbsp;the breast impenetrable by the bill of a rival.<sup>3</sup> More&nbsp;extraordinary than this, from one point of view, is the&nbsp;great variety of coloration that obtains in these temporary&nbsp;outgrowths. It has often been said that no one ever saw&nbsp;two Ruffs alike. That is perhaps an over-statement ; but,&nbsp;considering the really few colours that the birds exhibit,&nbsp;the variation is something marvellous, so that fifty&nbsp;examples or more may be compared without finding a&nbsp;very close resemblance between any two of them, while&nbsp;the individual variation is increased by the “ear-tufts,”&nbsp;which generally differ in colour from the frill, and thus&nbsp;produce a combination of diversity. The colours range&nbsp;from deep black to pure white, passing through chestnut&nbsp;or bay, and many tints of brown or ashy-grey, while&nbsp;often the feathers are more or less closely barred with some&nbsp;darker shade, and the black is very frequently glossed with&nbsp;violet, blue, or green—or, in addition, spangled with white,&nbsp;grey, or gold-colour. The white, on the other hand, is not&nbsp;rarely freckled, streaked, or barred with grey, rufous-brown, or black. In some examples the barring is most&nbsp;regularly concentric, in others more or less broken-up or&nbsp;undulating, and the latter may be said of the streaks. It&nbsp;was ascertained by Montagu, and has since been confirmed&nbsp;by the still wider experience and if possible more carefully&nbsp;conducted observation of Mr Bartlett, that every Ruff in&nbsp;each successive year assumes tufts and frill exactly the same&nbsp;in colour and markings as those he wore in the preceding&nbsp;season ; and thus, polymorphic as is the male as a species,&nbsp;as an individual he is unchangeable in his wedding-garment&nbsp;—a lesson that might possibly be applied to many other&nbsp;birds. The white frill is said to be the rarest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">That all this wonderful “ show ” is the consequence of the polygamous habit of the Ruff can scarcely be doubted.&nbsp;No other species of Limicoline bird has, so far as is known,&nbsp;any tendency to it. Indeed, in many species of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Limicolss,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">as the Dotterel, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Godwits</span><span class="font1"> (vol. </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">x.</span><span class="font1"> p. 720), Phalaropes,&nbsp;and perhaps some others, the female is larger and more&nbsp;brightly coloured than the male, who in such cases seems&nbsp;to take upon himself some at least of the domestic duties.&nbsp;Both Montagu and Graves, to say nothing of other writers,&nbsp;state that the Ruffs, in England, were far more numerous&nbsp;than the Reeves ; and their testi mony can hardly be doubted ;&nbsp;though in Germany Naumann ( </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">V'og. Deutschlands,</span><span class="font1"> vii. p.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>2</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Internally there is a great difference in the form of the posterior&nbsp;margin of the sternum, as long ago remarked by Nitzsch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>3</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This “ruff” has been compared to that of Elizabethan or&nbsp;Jacobean costume, but it is essentially different, since that was open&nbsp;in front and widest and most projecting behind, whereas the bird’s&nbsp;decorative apparel is most developed in front and at the sides and&nbsp;scarcely exists behind.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
