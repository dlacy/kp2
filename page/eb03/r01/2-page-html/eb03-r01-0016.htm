<p><span class="font2">&quot; From the moſt accurate obſervations of the ſmoke from the three calcinations, I could not diſcover either&nbsp;colour or ſmell that indicated any arſenical or ſulphure-ous mixture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“ Having therefore calcined this matter in three por-tions, with three different degrees of fire, I preſented a good magnet to each : it did not act either on the&nbsp;firſt or fecond ; a flight attraction was viſible in many&nbsp;places on the third : this perſuaded me, that this earth&nbsp;contains a martial principle in </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font2">metallic form, and not&nbsp;in a vitriolic ſubſtance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot; The nature of theſe ſubſtances then being difcover-ed, their volcanic origin appears ; for iron, the more it is expofed to violent calcination, the more it is divided&nbsp;by the loſs of its phlogiſtic principle ; which cannot&nbsp;naturally happen but in the great chimney of a volcano.&nbsp;Calcareous ſalt, being a marine falt combined with a&nbsp;calcareous ſubſtance by means of violent heat, cannot be&nbsp;otherwiſe compoſed than in a volcano.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot; As to their dreaded effects on animals and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">vegetables,</span><span class="font2"> every one knows the advantageous ufe, in medi-cine, both of the one and the other, and this in the ſame form </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font2">they are thus prepared in the great labo-ratory of nature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot; vegetables, even in flower, do not appear in the leaſt macerated, which has formerly happened from on-ly ſhowers of ſand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot; How this volcanic production came to be mixed with water may be conceived in various ways.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot; Ætna, about its middle regions, is generally fur-rounded with clouds that do not always riſe above its ſnmmit, which is 2900 paces above the level of the ſea.&nbsp;This matter being thrown out, and deſcending upon&nbsp;the clouds below it, may happen to mix and fall in rain&nbsp;with them in the uſual way. It may alſo be conjectured, that the thick ſmoke which the volcanic matter&nbsp;contained might, by its rarefaction, be carried in the&nbsp;atmoſphere by the winds over that tract of country ;&nbsp;and then cooling ſo as to condenſe and become ſpeciſi-cally heavier than the air, might deſcend in that colour-ed rain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot; I muſt, however, leave to philofophers (to whom the knowledge of natural agents belongs) the examination and explanation of ſuch phenomena, confining myſelf to obſervation and chemical experiments.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">RAINBOW. See optics, Part ∏. Sect. i. § 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the Philofophical Tranſactions for 1793, we have the following account of two rainbows ſeen by the Rev.&nbsp;Mr St urges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot; Οη the evening of the 9th of July 1792, between ſeven and eight o’clock, at Alverſtoke, near Goſport,&nbsp;on the ſea-coaſt of Hampſhire, there came up, in the&nbsp;ſonth-eaſt, a cloud with a thunder-ſhower ; while the&nbsp;fun ſhone bright, low in the horizon to the north-</span><span class="font1">weſt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“ In this ſhower two primary rainbows appeared, AB and AC, not concentric, but touching each other</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">at A, in the ſouth part of the horizon ; with </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font2">ſecon-dary bow to each, DE andDF (the laſt very faint, but diſcernible), which touched likewiſe at D. Both the&nbsp;primary were very' vivid for a conſiderable time, and at&nbsp;different times nearly equally ſo ; but the bow AB was &quot;*&nbsp;moſt permanent, was a larger ſegment of a circle, and at&nbsp;laſt, after the other had vaniſhed, became almoſt a ſemi-circle ; the ſun being near ſetting. It was a perfect&nbsp;calm, and the ſea was as ſmooth as glaſs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot; If I fnight venture to offer a ſolution of this ap-pearance, it would be as follows. I conſider the bow AB as the true one, produced by the ſun itſelf ; and&nbsp;the other, AC, as produced by the reflection of the ſun&nbsp;from the ſea, which, in its perfectly fmooth ſtate, acted&nbsp;as a ſpeculum. The direction of the ſea, between the&nbsp;Iſle of wight and the land, was to the north-weſt in </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">line with the ſun, as it was then ſituated. The image&nbsp;reflected from the water, having its rays iffuing from&nbsp;a point lower than the real ſun, and in a line coming&nbsp;from beneath the horizon, would conſequently form </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">bow higher than the true one AB. And the ſhores,&nbsp;by which that narrow part of the ſea is bounded, would&nbsp;before the ſun’s actual ſetting intercept its rays from&nbsp;the ſurſhce of the water, and cauſe the bow AC, which&nbsp;I ſuppoſe to be produced by the reflection, to diſappear&nbsp;before the other.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The marine or ſea bow is a phenomenon which maybe frequently obſerved in a much ag⅛ated ſea, and </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font2">occaſioned by the wind ſweeping part of the waves, and&nbsp;carrying them aloft ; which when they fall down are&nbsp;refracted by the ſun’s rays, which paint the colours of&nbsp;the bow juſt as in a common ſhower. Thefe bows are&nbsp;often ſeen when a veffel is ſailing with conſiderable&nbsp;force, and daſhing the waves around her, which are&nbsp;raiſed partly by tlre action βf the ſhip and partly by&nbsp;the force of the wind, and, falling down, they form a&nbsp;rainbow ; and they are alſo often occaſioned by the&nbsp;daſhing βf the waves againſt the rocks on ſhore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the Philofophical Tranſactions, it is obſerved by F. Bourzes, that the colours of the marine rain-bow are leſs lively, leſs diſtinct, and of ſhorter con-tinuance, than thoſe of the common bow ; that therc&nbsp;are ſcarce above two colours diſtinguiſhable, a dark yel-low on the ſide next the ſun, and a pale green on the&nbsp;oppoſite ſide. But they are more numerous, there be-ing ſometimes 20 or 30 ſeen together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To this claſs of bows may be referred a kind of white or colourlefs rainbows, which Mcntzelius and others affirm&nbsp;to have ſeen at noon-day. M. Marlotte, in his fourth&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Efifαi de Phyſique,</span><span class="font2"> ſays, theſe bows are formed in miſts,&nbsp;as the others are in ſhowers ; and adds,· that he has ſeen&nbsp;ſeveral both after ſun-riſing and in the night. The&nbsp;want of colours he attributes to the fmallneſs of the va∙&nbsp;pours which compofe the miſt ; but perhaps it is rather&nbsp;ſhom the exceeding .tenuity of the little veficulæ of the&nbsp;vapour, which being only little watery pellicles bloated with air, the rays of light undergo but little refraction in paſſing out of air into them ; too little to ſeparate the differently coloured rays, &amp;c. Hence the l ays&nbsp;are reflected from them, compounded as they came, that&nbsp;is, white. Rohault mentions * coloured rainbows on&nbsp;the graſs ; formed by the reſractions of the ſun’s rays&nbsp;in the morning dew. Rainbows have been alfo produced by the reflection of the ſun from a river ; and </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">in&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">the Philofophical Tranſactions, V0I.
