(Samuel), was born at Alfretton in Derbyſhire, and going into the army ſerved under the duke of Marlborough in Queen Anne’s wars with great credit. He afterwards came to London, commenced brewer, and kept a coffee-houſe in Alderſgate-ſtreet, which was well frequented by the learned men of that time, by whom Mr Sutton was much reſpected, as a man of ſtrong natural parts and uncultivated genius. About the year 1740 he schemed a very ſimple and natural method for extracting the foul air from the wells of ſhips, by pipes communicating with the fire-places of the coppers ; which operated as long as any fire was kept burning for the ſhip’s uſe. He took out a patent in <hi rend="italic">1</hi> 744, to ſecure the profits of his invention ; and died about the year 1752.</p><p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Sutton’s</hi> <hi rend="italic">Air-pipes.</hi> See <hi rend="italic">Air-Pipes.</hi></p></div></body></text></TEI>
