<p><span class="font0">influenced the painter of Vincenzo Gonzaga. Vigorous to the extreme in design, he reminds us of Michelangelo as&nbsp;much as any of the degenerate masters of the Roman&nbsp;school, while in decorative skill he seems to be descended&nbsp;from Titian and in colouring from Giulio Romano.&nbsp;Equally with this picture the Transfiguration, now in&nbsp;the museum at Nancy, and the portraits of Vincenzo and&nbsp;his consort, kneeling before the Trinity, in the library at&nbsp;Mantua, claim a large share of attention, apart from the&nbsp;interest awakened by the name of their author.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Two years later we meet a very large altarpiece of the Circumcision at St Ambrogio at Genoa, the Virgin in a&nbsp;glory of Angels, and two groups of Saints, painted on the&nbsp;wall, at both sides of the high altar in the church of&nbsp;Santa Maria in Valicella, in Rome. Undoubtedly these&nbsp;works give an impression of grandeur and effectiveness,&nbsp;but, in the immediate vicinity of the finest productions of&nbsp;the Italian school, they rank higher as documentary evidence than in intrinsic value, and remind us of a saying&nbsp;of Baglione, who was acquainted with Rubens in Italy,&nbsp;“ Apprese egli buon gusto, e diede in una maniera buona&nbsp;ItaIiana. ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">While employed at Rome in 1608, Rubens received most alarming news as to the state of his mother’s health.&nbsp;The duke of Gonzaga was then absent from Italy, but the&nbsp;dutiful son, without awaiting his return, at once set out&nbsp;for the Netherlands, though with the full intention of&nbsp;shortly resuming his post at court, as we gather from a&nbsp;letter to Annibale Chieppio, the Mantuan minister.&nbsp;When he arrived in Antwerp, Maria Pypelincx was no&nbsp;more. However strong his wish might now be to return&nbsp;to Italy, his purpose was overruled by the express desire&nbsp;of his sovereigns, Albert and Isabella, to see him take up&nbsp;a permanent residence in the Belgian provinces. Scarcely&nbsp;a year before, the archduke had unsuccessfully attempted&nbsp;to free the painter from his engagement at Mantua, and&nbsp;he could not fail to take advantage of the opportunity now&nbsp;presented for the fulfilment of his wishes. On August 3,&nbsp;1609, Rubens was named painter in ordinary to their Highnesses, with a salary of 500 livres, and “ the rights, honours,&nbsp;privileges, exemptions,” &amp;c., belonging to persons of the&nbsp;royal household, not to speak of the gift of a gold chain.&nbsp;Not least in importance for the painter was his complete&nbsp;exemption from all the regulations of the guild of St&nbsp;Luke, entitling him to engage any scholars or fellow-workers, without being obliged to have them enrolled,—a&nbsp;favour, it must be added, which has been the source of&nbsp;considerable trouble to the historians of Flemish art.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Although so recently returned to his native land, Rubens seems to have been, with one accord, accepted by&nbsp;his countrymen as the head of their school, and the&nbsp;municipality was foremost in giving him the means of&nbsp;proving his acquirements. The first in date among the&nbsp;numerous repetitions of the Adoration of the Magi is a&nbsp;picture in the Madrid Gallery, measuring 12 feet by 17,&nbsp;and containing no fewer than eight-and-twenty life size&nbsp;figures, many in gorgeous attire, warriors in steel armour,&nbsp;horsemen, slaves, camels, &lt;fcc. This picture, painted in&nbsp;Antwerp, at the town’s expense in 1609, had scarcely remained three years in the town-hall when it went to Spain&nbsp;as a present to Don Rodrigo Calderon, count of Oliva.&nbsp;The painter has represented himself among the horsemen,&nbsp;bareheaded, and wearing his gold chain. Cumberland&nbsp;speaks of this picture as the standard work of its author,&nbsp;and certainly it was well calculated to bring Rubens to&nbsp;the front rank in his profession. From a Ietterwritten in&nbsp;May 1611 we know that more than a hundred young men&nbsp;were desirous to become his pupils, and that many had,&nbsp;“ for several years,” been waiting with other masters, until&nbsp;he could admit them to his studio. It was thus from the&nbsp;beginning regarded as a great favour to be admitted a&nbsp;pupil of Rubens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Apart from the success of his works, another powerful motive had helped to detain the master in Antwerp,—his&nbsp;marriage with Isabella Brant (October 1609). Many&nbsp;pictures have made us familiar with the graceful young&nbsp;woman who was for seventeen years to share the master’s&nbsp;destinies. We meet her at The Hague, St Petersburg,&nbsp;Florence, at Grosvenor House, but more especially at&nbsp;Munich, where Rubens and his wife are depicted at full&nbsp;length on the same canvass. “ His wife is very handsome,” observes Sir Joshua Reynolds, “and has an agreeable countenance ; ” but the picture, he adds, “ is rather&nbsp;hard in manner.” This, it must be noted, is the case&nbsp;with all those pictures known to have immediately&nbsp;followed Rubens’s return, when he was still dependent&nbsp;on the assistance of painters trained by others than himself. Even in the Raising of the Cross, now in the&nbsp;Antwerp cathedral, and painted for the church of St&nbsp;Walburg in 1610, the dryness in outline is very striking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">According to the taste still at that time prevailing, the picture is tripartite, but the wings only serve to develop&nbsp;the central composition, and add to the general effect.&nbsp;In Witdoeck’s beautiful engraving the partitions even&nbsp;disappear. Thus, from the first, we see Rubens quite&nbsp;determined upon having his own way, and it is recorded&nbsp;that, when he painted the Descent from the Cross, St&nbsp;Christopher, the subject chosen by the Arquebusiers, was&nbsp;altered so as to bring the artistic expressions into better&nbsp;accordance with his views. Although the subject was&nbsp;frequently repeated by the great painter, this first Descent&nbsp;from the Cross has not ceased to be looked upon as his&nbsp;masterpiece. Begun in 1611, the celebrated work was&nbsp;placed in 1614, and certainly no more striking evidence&nbsp;could be given of the rapid growth of the author’s abilities. Rubens received 2400 florins for this picture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Although it is chance that has brought the Raising of the Cross and the Descent from the Cross into their&nbsp;present close juxtaposition, it is not improbable that their&nbsp;uniformity in size may have been designed. In many&nbsp;respects, Italian influence remains conspicuous in the&nbsp;Descent. Rubens had seen Ricciarelli’s fresco at the&nbsp;Trinita de’ Monti, and was also acquainted with the&nbsp;grandiose picture of Baroccio in the cathedral of Perugia,&nbsp;and no one conversant with these works can mistake their&nbsp;influence. But in Rubens strength of personality could&nbsp;not be overpowered by reminiscence ; and in type, as well&nbsp;as in colouring, the Descent from the Cross may be termed&nbsp;thoroughly Flemish and Rubenesque. As Waagen justly&nbsp;observes : “ the boldness of the composition, the energy in&nbsp;the characters, the striking attitudes, and the effects of the&nbsp;grouping, together with the glowing vigorous colouring,&nbsp;belong to his later style, whereas a few of the heads, particularly that of the Virgin, display the careful execution&nbsp;of his earlier period. The interior of the wings, on which&nbsp;are painted the Visitation and the Presentation in the&nbsp;Temple, exhibit, on the other hand, a greater resemblance&nbsp;to the conjugal picture already alluded to, owing to a&nbsp;certain repose in action, a more elevated expression of&nbsp;delicacy and feeling in the characters, and a less glowing&nbsp;though still admirable colouring.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Legend, in some way, connects Van Dyck with the Descent from the Cross, and ascribes to the great portrait&nbsp;painter an arm and shoulder of Mary Magdalene, which&nbsp;had been damaged by a pupil’s carelessness. Plain truth&nbsp;here, once more, seems to contradict romance. Van Dyck&nbsp;was a pupil of Van Balen’s in 1609, and most probably&nbsp;remained with him several years before coming to Rubens.</span></p>
