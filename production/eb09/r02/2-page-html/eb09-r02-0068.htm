<p><span class="font0">culties have been encountered in its working, some of which are not yet overcome. The fibre itself is very difficult of extraction owing&nbsp;to the large amount of adhesive matter in which it is embedded,&nbsp;and it is proportionately so expensive that it practically comes into&nbsp;competition only with silk and wool. Further, rhea is hard and inelastic, and on the machinery adapted for spinning other textiles it&nbsp;can only be spun into a rough, harsh, and hairy yarn, while fabrics&nbsp;into which it is woven are rigid, and show permanent creases at&nbsp;every fold. In the form of cordage, moreover, it cuts and gives&nbsp;way at sharp knots and twists. Notwithstanding all disappointments and drawbacks, the Indian Government considered the fibre&nbsp;of such importance that in 1869 two prizes of £5000 and £2000&nbsp;and again in 1877 prizes of £5000 and £1000 were offered for&nbsp;machinery or processes by which the fibre could be prepared at such&nbsp;a cost per ton as would render its introduction into the market practicable. Competitive trials were made at Saharanpur in 1872 and&nbsp;1879, but no machine was found to satisfy the conditions of success,&nbsp;although in 1872 a reward of £1500 wasgranted to Mr John Greig,&nbsp;jun., of Edinburgh, and in 1879 £500 and £100 respectively were&nbsp;paid to two of the competitors. The extraction of rhea continues&nbsp;to attract attention, and quite recently (1885) it has been announced&nbsp;that Prof. Frémy of Paris, assisted by M. Urbain, has successfully overcome all difficulties. The raw material used by Prof.&nbsp;Frémy is obtained by a process devised by M. Fevier, which consists in submitting the newly cut stems to low-pressure steam for&nbsp;twenty minutes, after which the whole rind is separated in ribands&nbsp;from its woody core with the utmost ease. These ribands are then&nbsp;dried, and on them Prof. Frémy operates with alkaline solutions&nbsp;which are varied in strength according to the appearance of the&nbsp;material dealt with, and a pure fibre in fine working condition is&nbsp;thus obtained. Rhea has yet to establish its position among European textiles, but in the East its value is well recognized. It is&nbsp;extensively used for cordage, fishing nets, &amp;c. ; and it is very little&nbsp;affected by water. The Chinese prepare an exceedingly fine “grass&nbsp;cloth” from single filaments of rhea, knotted or gummed end to&nbsp;end in the way they employ the finest filaments of Manila hemp&nbsp;for making ‘ ‘ Pina ” gauze.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RHEGIUM. See Reggio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RHEIMS, a city of France, chief town of an arrondissement of the department of Marne, lies 81 miles east-north-east of Paris (99 miles by rail) on the right bank of the Vesle, a tributary of the Aisne, and on the canal which&nbsp;connects the Aisne with the Marne. To the south and&nbsp;west rise the “ montagne de Rheims ” and the vine-clad&nbsp;hills where the wine is grown which constitutes the chief&nbsp;object of the industry and commerce of the town. Rheims&nbsp;has been, since the last Franco-Prussian War, surrounded&nbsp;with detached forts that render it a great entrenched&nbsp;camp, and it still preserves eleven of the gates of its old&nbsp;enceinte, that of Paris, constructed on occasion of the&nbsp;coronation of Louis XVI., being specially noticeable.&nbsp;Beyond the boulevards the town spreads out in several&nbsp;suburbs—the faubourgs of St Anne on the south, Vesle on&nbsp;the west, Laon on the north-west, and Cérès on the northeast. The town is well planned and built, and its streets&nbsp;are traversed by tramways.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The spinning and weaving of wool is carried on in seventy factories, employs 10,000 hands, and annually&nbsp;turns ⅛3,500,000 worth of the raw material into flannels,&nbsp;merinoes, cloth, blankets, &amp;c. Dyeing and “ dressing ”&nbsp;are carried on in the outskirts of the town. Fifty firms&nbsp;with 2000 workmen are employed in the champagne&nbsp;manufacture ; the cellars are vast excavations in the chalk&nbsp;rock. Rheims is also famous for its biscuits, gingerbread, and dried pears. Machinery, chemical products,&nbsp;candles, soap, stained glass, common glass, and paper are&nbsp;also manufactured. In respect of population (93,683 in&nbsp;1881) Rheims ranks as the eleventh city of France.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The oldest monument in Rheims is the Mars Gate (so called from a temple to Mars in the neighbourhood), a triumphal arch&nbsp;108 feet in length by 43 in height erected by the Remi in honour&nbsp;of Cæsar and Augustus when Agrippa made the great roads terminating at the town. In its vicinity a curious mosaic measuring&nbsp;35 feet by 26, with thirty-five medallions representing animals&nbsp;and gladiators, was discovered in 1861. But by far the most&nbsp;interesting architectural feature of the town is the cathedral of&nbsp;Notre Dame, where the kings of France used to be crowned. It&nbsp;replaced an older church burned in 1211, which had been built on&nbsp;the site of the basilica where Clovis was baptized by St Remigius.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">The whole cathedral, with the exception of the façade, was completed by 1231 ; but it has undergone numerous alterations. The present façade was erected in the 14th century after 13th-century&nbsp;designs,—the nave having in the meantime been lengthened so as&nbsp;to afford room for the vast crowds that attended the coronations.&nbsp;In 1481 a terrible fire destroyed the roof and also the spires, which&nbsp;have never been restored to their original state. In 1875 the&nbsp;National Assembly voted £80,000 for repairs of the façade and&nbsp;balustrades. This façade is the finest portion of the building, and&nbsp;one of the most perfect masterpieces of the Middle Ages. The&nbsp;portals and the rose window are laden with statues and statuettes ;&nbsp;the ‘ ‘ gallery of the kings ” above has the baptism of Clovis in the&nbsp;centre, and also has statues of Charlemagne and his father Pippin&nbsp;the Short. The towers, 267 feet high, were originally designed to&nbsp;rise 394 feet ; that on the south contains two great bells, one of&nbsp;which, named by Cardinal de Lorraine in 1570, weighs more than&nbsp;11 tons. The transepts are also decorated with sculptures,—that&nbsp;on the north with statues of the principal bishops of Rheims, a&nbsp;representation of the last judgment, and a figure of Christ, while&nbsp;that on the south side has a beautiful rose window with the</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">prophets and apostles. Of the four towers which formerly flanked the transepts nothing remains above the height of the roof since&nbsp;the fire of 1481. Above the choir rises an elegant bell-tower in&nbsp;timber and lead, 59 feet high, reconstructed in the 15th century.&nbsp;The interior of the cathedral is 455 feet long, 98⅜ feet wide in the&nbsp;nave, and 125 feet high in the centre. It has a profusion of&nbsp;statues similar to those of the outside, and is further adorned with&nbsp;stained glass of the 13th century and with tapestries. The rose&nbsp;window over the main portal and the gallery beneath are of rare&nbsp;magnificence. Forty pieces of tapestry bestowed in 1530 by Robert&nbsp;de Lenoncourt, and devoted to the history of the Virgin, are&nbsp;remarkable for the richness of colour and the variety of costume&nbsp;they display. Of six pieces presented by Cardinal de Lorraine in&nbsp;1570, only three have been preserved ; one of them representing&nbsp;the coronation of Clovis and the battle of Soissons affords valuable&nbsp;evidence relating to the military costumes of the 16th century.&nbsp;Archbishop Henry of Lorraine also presented seventeen large pieces&nbsp;of tapestry representing the life of Christ, in 1633 ; they are called&nbsp;Pepersack’s tapestries after the maker, a celebrated tapestry</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
