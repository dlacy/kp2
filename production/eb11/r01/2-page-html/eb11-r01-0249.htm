<p><span class="font0">so as to give rise to structures which in normal development they would not have formed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is clear that there are at least three kinds of factors involved in regeneration. There are: (1) Regenerations due to the presence of undifferentiated, or little differentiated, cells,&nbsp;which have retained the normal capacity of multiplication when&nbsp;conditions are favourable. (2) Regenerations due to the&nbsp;presence of special complicated rudiments, the stimulus to the&nbsp;development of which is the removal of the fully formed&nbsp;structure. (3) Regeneration involving the general capacity&nbsp;of protoplasm to respond to changes in the surroundings by&nbsp;changes of growth. The most general view is to regard regenerations as special adaptations; and A. Weismann, following&nbsp;in this matter Arnold Lang, has developed the idea at considerate length, and has found a place for regenerations in his&nbsp;system of the germ-plasm (see Heredity) by the conception&nbsp;of the existence of “ accessory determinants.” Hertwig, on&nbsp;the other hand, attaches great importance to the facts of&nbsp;regeneration as evidence for his view that every cell of a body&nbsp;contains a similar essential plasm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In E. Schwalbe’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Morphologie der Minbildungen</span><span class="font0"> (1904), part i. chap. V., an attempt is made to associate the facts of regeneration&nbsp;with those of embryology and pathology. Our knowledge of the&nbsp;facts, however, is not yet systematic enough to allow of important&nbsp;general conclusions. The power of regeneration appears to be in&nbsp;some cases a special adaptation, but more often simply an expression&nbsp;of the general power of protoplasm to grow and to reproduce its&nbsp;kind. It has been suggested that regenerated parts always represent&nbsp; ancestral stages, but there is no conclusive evidence for this&nbsp;view.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(P. C. M.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">REGENSBURG </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">(Ratisbon), a city and episcopal see of Germany, in the kingdom of Bavaria, and the capital of the&nbsp;government district of the Upper Palatinate. Pop. (1905) 48,412.&nbsp;It is situated on the right bank of the Danube, opposite the&nbsp;influx of the Regen, 86 m. by rail N.E. from Munich, and 60 m.&nbsp;S.E. of Nuremberg. On the other side of the river is the suburb&nbsp;Stadt-am-Hof, connected with Regensburg by a long stone&nbsp;bridge of the 12th century, above and below which are the&nbsp;islands of Oberer and Unterer Wörth. In appearance the&nbsp;town is quaint and romantic, presenting almost as faithful a&nbsp;picture of a town of the early middle ages as Nuremberg does&nbsp;of the later. One of the most characteristic features in its&nbsp;architecture is the number of strong loopholed towers attached&nbsp;to the more ancient dwellings. The interesting “ street of the&nbsp;envoys ” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Gesandtenstrasse)</span><span class="font1"> is so called because it contained the&nbsp;residences of most of the envoys to the German diet, whose&nbsp;coats-of-arms may still be seen on many of the houses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The cathedral, though small, is a very interesting example of pure German Gothic. It was founded in 1275, and completed&nbsp;in 1634, with the exception of the towers, which were finished&nbsp;in 1869. The interior contains numerous interesting monuments,&nbsp;including one of Peter Vischer’s masterpieces. Adjoining the&nbsp;cloisters are two chapels of earlier date than the cathedral itself,&nbsp;one of which, known as the “ old cathedral,” goes back&nbsp;perhaps to the 8th century. The church of St James—also&nbsp;called Schottenkirche—a plain Romanesque basilica of the&nbsp;12th century, derives its name from the monastery of Irish&nbsp;Benedictines (“ Scoti ”) to which it was attached; the principal&nbsp;doorway is covered with very singular grotesque carvings.&nbsp;The old parish church of St Ulrich is a good example of the&nbsp;Transition style of the 13th century, and contains a valuable antiquarian collection. Examples of the Romanesque&nbsp;basilica style are the church of Obermünster, dating from&nbsp;1010, and the abbey church of St Emmeran, built in the 13th&nbsp;century, and remarkable as one of the few German churches with&nbsp;a detached belfry. The beautiful cloisters of the ancient abbey,&nbsp;one of the oldest in Germany, are still in fair preservation. In&nbsp;1809 the conventual buildings were converted into a palace for&nbsp;the prince of Thurn and Taxis, hereditary postmaster-general&nbsp;of the Holy Roman Empire. The town hall, dating in part&nbsp;from the 14th century, contains the rooms occupied by the&nbsp;imperial diet from 1663 to 1806. An historical interest also&nbsp;attaches to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Gasthof zum Goldenen Kreuz</span><span class="font1"> (Golden Cross Inn),&nbsp;where Charles V. made the acquaintance of Barbara Blomberg,&nbsp;the mother of Don John of Austria (b. 1547). The house is also&nbsp;shown where Kepler died in 1630. Perhaps the most pleasing&nbsp;modern building in the city is the Gothic villa of the king of&nbsp;Bavaria on the bank of the Danube. At Kumpfmühl, in the&nbsp;immediate neighbourhood of the city, was discovered, in 1885, the&nbsp;remains of a Roman camp with an arched gateway; the latter,&nbsp;known as the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Porta Praetoria,</span><span class="font1"> was cleared in 1887. Among the&nbsp; public institutions of the city should be mentioned the public&nbsp;library, picture gallery, botanical garden, and the institute for&nbsp;the making of stained glass. The educational establishments&nbsp;include two </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gymnasia,</span><span class="font1"> an episcopal clerical seminary, a&nbsp;seminary for boys and a school of church music. Among the&nbsp;chief manufactures are iron and steel wares, pottery, parquet&nbsp;flooring, tobacco, and lead pencils. Boat-building is also&nbsp;prosecuted, and a brisk transit trade is carried on in salt,&nbsp;grain and timber.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Near Regensburg are two very handsome classical buildings, erected by Louis I. of Bavaria as national monuments of German&nbsp;patriotism and greatness. The more imposing of the two is the&nbsp;Walhalla, a costly reproduction of the Parthenon, erected as a&nbsp;Teutonic temple of fame on a hill rising from the Danube at Donaustauf, 6 m. to the east. The interior, which is as rich as coloured&nbsp;marbles, gilding, and sculptures can make it, contains the busts&nbsp;of more than a hundred German worthies. The second of King&nbsp;Louis’s buildings is the Befreiungshalle at Kelheim, 14 m. above&nbsp;Regensburg, a large circular building which has for its aim the&nbsp;glorification of the heroes of the war of liberation in 1813.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The early Celtic settlement of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Radespona</span><span class="font0"> (L. Lat. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ratisbona) </span><span class="font0">was chosen by the Romans, who named it </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Castra Regina,</span><span class="font0"> as the&nbsp;centre of their power on the upper Danube. It is mentioned as a&nbsp;trade centre as early as the 2nd century. It afterwards became&nbsp;the seat of the dukes of Bavaria, and one of the main bulwarks of&nbsp;the East Frankish monarchy; and it was also the focus from which&nbsp;Christianity spread over southern Germany. St Emmeran founded&nbsp;an abbey here in the middle of the 7th century, and St Boniface&nbsp;established the bishopric about a hundred years later. Regensburg&nbsp;acquired the freedom of the empire in the 13th century, and was for&nbsp;a time the most flourishing city in southern Germany. It became&nbsp;the chief seat of the trade with India and the Levant, and the boatmen&nbsp; of Regensburg are frequently heard of as expediting the journeys&nbsp;of the Crusaders. The city was loyally Ghibelline in its sympathies,&nbsp;and was a favourite residence of the emperors. Numerous diets&nbsp;were held here from time to time, and after 1663 it became the&nbsp;regular place of meeting of the German diet. The Reformation&nbsp;found only temporary acceptance at Regensburg, and was met&nbsp;by a counter-reformation inspired by the Jesuits. Before this&nbsp;period the city had almost wholly lost its commercial importance&nbsp;owing to the changes in the great highways of trade. Regensburg&nbsp;had its due share in the Thirty Years’ and other wars, and is said&nbsp;to have suffered in all no fewer than seventeen sieges. In 1807&nbsp;the town and bishopric were assigned to the prince primate Dalberg,&nbsp;and in 1810 they were ceded to Bavaria. After the battle of&nbsp;Eggmuhl in 1809 the Austrians retired upon Regensburg, and the&nbsp;pursuing French defeated them again beneath its walls and reduced&nbsp;a great part </span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font0">the city to ashes.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">REGENT (from Lat. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">regere,</span><span class="font1"> to rule), one who rules or governs, especially one who acts temporarily as an administrator of the&nbsp;realm during the minority or incapacity of the king. This&nbsp;latter function, however, is one unknown to the English common&nbsp;law. “ In judgment of law the king, as king, cannot be said&nbsp;to be a minor, for when the royal body politic of the king doth&nbsp;meet with the natural capacity in one person the whole body&nbsp;shall have the quality of the royal politic, which is the greater&nbsp;and more worthy and wherein is no minority. For </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">omne majus&nbsp;continet in se minus</span><span class="font1"> ” (Coke upon Littleton, 43a). But for reasons&nbsp;of necessity a regency, however anomalous it may be in strict&nbsp;law, has frequently been constituted both in England and&nbsp; Scotland. The earliest instance in English history is the&nbsp;appointment of the earl of Pembroke with the assent of the&nbsp;loyal barons on the accession of Henry III.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Whether or not the sanction of parliament is necessary for the appointment is a question which has been much discussed. Lord&nbsp;Coke recommends that the office should depend on the will of</span></p>
