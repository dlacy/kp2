Its destruction was, in a great measure, the work of the Romans themselves, who carried off the materials to build their own dwellings.</p><p>-From its mass</p><p>Walls, palaces, half cities have been rear'd ;</p><p>till at length Benedict XIV. secured it from further dilapidation, by erecting a cross in the middle of the arena, and proclaiming it to be consecrated ground, hallowed by the blood of the martyrs. The form of the Coliseum is elliptical ; the length measures 591¼ feet, and the breadth 508¾ ; it is 1683¾ feet in circumference, and 147 in height. The exterior elevation presents four divisions or storeys, of which the three lower are supported by half columns, and the uppermost by pilasters. The interior elevation, beginning from the arena, presented first the podium, a kind of covered gallery, destined for the use of the emperor and persons of the first description ; then three successive orders of seats for the spectators, called collectively the cavea; and at the top the attic, with the velarium or awning. It has been calculated that the cavea, with the podium, could contain 80,000 persons seated ; but taking into account the upper gallery, and the number of persons necessarily engaged about the arena, that not less than 100,000 souls have sometimes been contained within these walls. At the dedication, which lasted one hundred days, 5000 wild beasts were exhibited and slain.@@<hi rend="sup">1</hi> The arena also was overflowed with water, and made the scene of a mock naval fight. The northern side is pretty entire ; but on the south, the stupendous arches have been stripped of their external decorations. In the interior the destruction is more complete ; the marble steps are all torn away, the steps and vomitories overthrown, and the sloping walls and broken arches are covered with weeds and shrubs. Around the arena the pictured representations of the fourteen stages of our Lord’s passion are placed at regular intervals. In the centre of it stands a huge black cross, which offers the liberal recompense of one hundred days’ indulgence to every person who devoutly kisses it. A broad pathway runs through the middle ; the rest is covered with a smooth green sod. “ Here,” says Mr. Forsyth, “ sat the conquerors of the world, coolly to enjoy the tortures and death of men who had never offended them. Two aqueducts were scarcely sufficient to wash off the human blood which a few hours’ sport shed in this imperial shambles. Twice in one day came the senators and matrons of Rome to the butchery. A virgin always gave thc signal for slaughter; and when glutted with bloodshed, those ladies sat down in the wet and steaming arena to a luxurious supper. Such reflections check our regret for its ruin. As it now stands, the Coliseum is a striking image of Rome itself, decayed, vacant, serious, yet grand, half grey and half green, erect on one side and fallen on the other, with consecrated ground in its bosom ; inhabited by a beadsman, visited by every cast; for moralists, antiquaries, painters, architects, devotees, all meet here to meditate, to examine, to draw, to measure, and to pray.”@@<hi rend="sup">2</hi></p><p>Between the Aventine and Palatine hills stood the Circus Maximus, which occupied the whole valley; and though all traces of the building have disappeared, its form is still very apparent. This circus was first laid out by Tarquinius Priscus ;@@<hi rend="sup">3</hi> but it does not appear to have attained any great degree of splendour till the time of Julius Cæsar, who enlarged the whole space, and rendered it capable of containing 150,000 spectators. Pliny states that in the time of Trajan it held 250,000.@@<hi rend="sup">4</hi> It was the last place where games were celebrated in Rome. So late as the close of the fifth century, it was filled for the last time with spectators of the gladiatorial combats, when Telemachus, an Asiatic monk, having ineffectually tried remonstrance, descended into the arena to separate the combatants, and was stoned to death by the enraged people. But the sacrifice was not made in vain, for from that day Honorius abolished the combats of gladiators. The last remains of tlle Circus Maximus were removed by Paul III., “ that universal destroyer of antiquities.” Attached to this circus were the shops or<hi rend="italic">tabernœ, </hi>in which, during the reign of Nero, began the conflagration that consumed ten out of fourteen quarters of the city. Of all tlle circuses of ancient Rome, one only is sufficiently entire to shew what a circus was. It stands on the Via Appia, beside the tomb of Cecilia Metella, and is called the circus of Caracalla, though there is no reason for believing it to have been built by tllat emperor. It is still in excellent preservation.</p><p>On the outside of the Coliseum are the mouldering ruins of a building, supposed to have been that famous fountain the Meta Sudans, which existed even in the time of the republic.@@<hi rend="sup">5</hi></p><p>One of the most attractive of the ancient edifices of Rome, is the Pantheon or Rotondo, “ the pride of Rome.” That glorious combination of beauty and magnificence, which was erected by Agrippa, is 132 feet in height, the same in diameter, and 396 feet in circumference. It is generally believed that the body of the building is of earlier erection than the portico ; that it was built for a thermal hall, or something belonging to the baths of Agrippa, and that the portico was afterwards added in order to convert it into a temple. It has long been a matter of dispute to whom the Pantheon was dedicated. The popular belief is, that it was dedicated to Jupiter and all the gods of antiquity ; but Pliny expressly says that it was dedicated to Jupiter the Avenger.@@<hi rend="sup">6</hi> In the year 608, Pope Boniface IV. obtained permission of the emperor Phocas to consecrate it for a Christian church. It then received the title of St. Maria Rotondo, which it still preserves. About fifty years after its consecration, Constans II. stripped off the bronze covering of the roof, the bronze bassi relievi of the pediment, and tlle silver which adorned the interior of the dome, and carried away the spoil to send it to Constantinople ; but being murdered at Syracuse on his return, these ornaments were afterwards conveyed by tlle Saracens to Alexandria. In 1632, Pope Urban VIII., one of the Bar-berini family, carried off all the bronze that was left, and moulded it into ornaments for St. Peter’s tomb in the Vatican, and cannon for the castle of St. Angelo. It has been calculated that upwards of forty· five millions of pounds weight of metal was taken away on that occasion. This gave rise to the pasquinade, “ Quod non fecerunt Barbari Romæ, fecerunt Barberini.” The same pope disfigured the building by placing before the dome two hideous belfries, as a perpetual monument of his wretched taste. As a sort of compensation, however, he replaced one of the three deficient columns of the portico. The other two were restored by Pope Alexander VII. The portal has been pronounced to be “ positively the most sublime result that was ever produced by so little architecture.” The original folding doors are said to have been carried off by Genseric ; but the present gates are obviously ancient also, and are supposed to have been taken from some other Roman building.
