        <p><span class="font1">the future the interest of Roman history centres in her attempts to
                perform the two Herculean tasks which this&nbsp;unique position laid upon her,—the
                efficient government&nbsp;of the subject peoples, and their defence against the
                barbarian races which swarmed around them on all sides.&nbsp;They were tasks under
                which the old republican constitution broke down, and which finally overtaxed the
                strength&nbsp;even of the marvellous organization framed and elaborated&nbsp;by
                Augustus and his successors.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">At the outset the difficulties of Rome were increased by the rapidity
                with which her new duties came upon her.&nbsp;From a century, first of deadly
                struggle, and then of&nbsp;dazzlingly easy success, she emerged to find herself
                called&nbsp;upon to govern a world with the primitive machinery of a&nbsp;small city
                state, and to deal with new and complicated administrative problems which she had as
                yet had no leisure&nbsp;to study. Nor was it until her own political system
                had&nbsp;been remodelled that she was able to deal effectively with&nbsp;the
                government of the empire at large. During the period&nbsp;which has now to be
                considered, the period of the so-called&nbsp;Revolution, but little advance was made
                towards a better&nbsp;imperial organization, and that little was made by
                men&nbsp;who, like Cæsar and Pompey, belonged, both in the&nbsp;methods and aims of
                their policy and in the position they&nbsp;held, to the empire rather than to the
                republic.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Although in its outward form the old constitution had undergone
                little change during the age of war and conquest from 265 to 146,@@<sup>1</sup> the
                causes, both internal and&nbsp;» external,&quot; which brought about its fall had
                been silently&nbsp;at work throughout. Its form was in strictness that&nbsp;of a
                moderate democracy. The patriciate had ceased to&nbsp;exist as a privileged
                    caste,@@<sup>2</sup> and there was no longer any&nbsp;order of nobility
                recognized by the constitution. The&nbsp;senate and the offices of state were in law
                open to all,@@<sup>3&nbsp;</sup>and the will of the people in their comitia had been
                in&nbsp;the most explicit and unqualified manner declared to be&nbsp;supreme alike
                in the election of magistrates, in the passing&nbsp;of laws, and in all matters
                touching the “ caput ” of a&nbsp;Roman citizen. But in practice the constitution
                had&nbsp;become an oligarchy. The senate, not the assembly, ruled&nbsp;Rome, and
                both the senate and the magistracies were in&nbsp;the hands of a class which, in
                defiance of the law, arrogated&nbsp;to itself the title and the privileges of a
                    nobility.@@<sup>4</sup> The&nbsp;ascendency of the senate is too obvious and
                familiar a fact&nbsp;to need much illustration here. It is but rarely that
                the&nbsp;assembly was called upon to decide questions of policy,&nbsp;and then the
                proposal was usually made by the magistrate&nbsp;in obedience to the express
                directions of the senate.@@<sup>5</sup> In&nbsp;the enormous majority of cases the
                matter was settled by&nbsp;a senatus consultum, without any reference to the
                people&nbsp;at all. The assembly decides for war or peace@@<sup>6</sup>, but
                the&nbsp;conduct of the war and the conditions of peace are matters&nbsp;left to the
                senate. Now and then the assembly confers a</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">command upon the man of its choice, or prolongs the imperium of a
                    magistrate,@@<sup>7</sup> but, as a rule, these and all&nbsp;questions connected
                with foreign affairs are settled within&nbsp;the walls of the senate house. It is
                the senate which&nbsp;year after year assigns the commands and fixes the
                number&nbsp;and disposition of the military forces,@@<sup>8</sup> directs the
                organization of a new province,@@<sup>9</sup> conducts negotiations, and&nbsp;forms
                alliances. Within Italy, though its control of&nbsp;affairs was less exclusive, we
                find that, besides supervising the ordinary current business of administration,
                the&nbsp;senate decides questions connected with the Italian allies,&nbsp;sends out
                colonies, allots lands, and directs the suppression of disorders. Lastly, both in
                Italy and abroad it&nbsp;managed the finances.@@<sup>10</sup> Inseparably connected
                with this&nbsp;monopoly of affairs to the exclusion of the assembly was&nbsp;the
                control which in practice, if not in theory, the senate&nbsp;exercised over the
                magistrates. The latter had become&nbsp;what Cicero wrongly declares they were
                always meant to&nbsp;be, merely the subordinate ministers of the
                    supreme&nbsp;council,@@<sup>11</sup> which assigned them their departments,
                provided&nbsp;them with the necessary equipment, claimed to direct&nbsp;their
                conduct, prolonged their commands, and rewarded&nbsp;them with triumphs. It was now
                at once the duty and&nbsp;the interest of a magistrate to be “in auctoritate
                senatus,”&nbsp;“ subject to the authority of the senate,” and even the
                once&nbsp;formidable “tribuni plebis” are found during this period&nbsp;actively and
                loyally supporting the senate, and acting as&nbsp;its spokesmen in the
                    assembly.@@<sup>12</sup></span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The causes of this ascendency of the senate are not to be found in
                any additions made by law to its constitutional prerogatives, but first of all in
                the fact that the&nbsp;senate was the only body capable of conducting affairs
                in&nbsp;an age of incessant war. The voters in the assembly, a&nbsp;numerous, widely
                scattered body, many of whom were&nbsp;always away with the legions abroad, could
                not readily be&nbsp;called together, and when assembled were very imperfectly
                qualified to decide momentous questions of military&nbsp;strategy and foreign
                policy. The senate, on the contrary,&nbsp;could be summoned in a
                    moment,@@<sup>13</sup> and included in its&nbsp;ranks all the skilled statesmen
                and soldiers of the commonwealth, while its forms of procedure were at least
                better&nbsp;fitted than those of the comitia for securing the
                careful&nbsp;discussion and prompt decision of the question before it.&nbsp;The
                subordination of the magistrates was equally the&nbsp;result of circumstances,
                though it suited the senatorial&nbsp;advocates of a later day to represent it as an
                original principle of the constitution, and though it was encouraged
                and&nbsp;confirmed by the policy of the senate itself.@@<sup>14</sup> For, as
                the&nbsp;numbers of the magistrates, and also the area of government, increased,
                some central controlling power became&nbsp;absolutely necessary to prevent
                collisions between rival&nbsp;authorities, and to secure a proper division of
                labour, as&nbsp;well as to enforce the necessary concert and
                    co-operation,@@<sup>15&nbsp;</sup>nor could such a power be found anywhere in
                the republican system but in the senate, standing as it necessarily&nbsp;did in the
                closest relations with the magistrate, and composed as it was increasingly of men
                who were or had been&nbsp;in office.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Once more, behind both senate and magistrates lay the</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@1</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important change was the
                assimilation of the division&nbsp;by classes and centuries with that by tribes, a
                change effected apparently by the censors in their revision of the register, and
                probably&nbsp;effected, gradually. For a full discussion of the point, see
