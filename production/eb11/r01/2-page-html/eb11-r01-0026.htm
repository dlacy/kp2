<p><span class="font1">Processes may be theoretically assigned for the direct continuous transformation of radiant into mechanical energy. Thus we can&nbsp;imagine a radiating body at the centre of a wheel, carrying oblique&nbsp;vanes along its circumference, which reflect the radiation on to a&nbsp;ring of parallel fixed vanes, which finally reverse its path and return&nbsp;it to the centre. The pressure of the radiation will drive the wheel,&nbsp;and in case its motion is not resisted, a very great velocity may be&nbsp;theoretically obtained. The thermodynamic compensation in such&nbsp;cases lies in the reduction of the effective temperature of the portion&nbsp;of the radiation not thus used up. We might even do away with&nbsp;the radiating body at the centre of the wheel, and consider a beam&nbsp;of definite radiation reflected backwards and forwards across a&nbsp;diameter. It is easy to see that its path will remain diametral;&nbsp;the work done by it in driving the wheel will be concomitant with&nbsp;increase of the wave-length, and therefore with expansion of the&nbsp;length occupied by the beam. The thermodynamic features are&nbsp;thus analogous to those of the more familiar case of an envelope&nbsp;filled with gas, which can change its thermal energy into mechanical&nbsp;energy by expansion of the envelope against mechanical resistances.&nbsp;In the case of the expanding gas </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pv</span><span class="font1"> = ⅔E</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"><sub>o</sub></span><span class="font1">, where E<sub>o</sub> is the total translatory energy of the molecules, while in adiabatic expansion </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">p = kυ-y.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">Thus the work gained in unlimited expansion, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">fpdυ,</span><span class="font1"> is ⅔E<sub>0</sub>∕(γ-1).&nbsp;The final temperature being absolute zero, this should by Carnot’s&nbsp;principle be equal to the total initial energy of the gas that is in&nbsp;connexion with temperature, constitutive energy of the molecules&nbsp;being excluded; when 7 — 1 is less than ⅔  there is thus internal&nbsp;thermal energy in the molecules in addition to the translatory&nbsp;energy.

<p><span class="font2">12. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Experimental Knowledge. —</span><span class="font2">Under the stimulus of Wien’s&nbsp;investigation and of improvements in the construction of linear&nbsp;thermopiles and bolometers for the refined measurement of the&nbsp;distribution of energy along a spectrum, the general character&nbsp;of the curve connecting energy and wave-length in the complete&nbsp;radiation at a given temperature has been experimentally&nbsp;ascertained over a wide range. At each temperature there is a&nbsp;wave-length λ<sub>m</sub> of maximum radiation, which is displaced&nbsp;towards the ultra-violet as the temperature rises, and Wien’s&nbsp;law of homology (§ 6) shows that λ<sub>m</sub>T should be constant. This&nbsp;deduction, and the law of homology itself, as also the law of&nbsp;Stefan and Boltzmann that the total radiation varies as T<sup>4</sup>,&nbsp;have been closely verified by the experiments of Rubens and&nbsp;Kurlbaum, Lummer and Pringsheim, Paschen and others.&nbsp;They established a steady field of radiation inside a material&nbsp;enclosure by raising the walls to a definite temperature, and&nbsp;measured the radiant intensity emitted from it through an&nbsp;opening or slit in the walls, by means of a bolometer or thermopile, this being the radiation of the so-called perfectly black body.&nbsp;The principle here involved formed one of the foundations of&nbsp;Balfour Stewart’s early treatment of the theory, and had already&nbsp;been employed by him and Stokes (i860) in experiments on the&nbsp;polarized emission from tourmaline: cf. Stokes, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Math. and&nbsp;Phys. Papers,</span><span class="font2"> iv. 136. It has been remarked by Planck and&nbsp;by Thiesen that the coefficient of T<sup>4</sup> in Stefan’s law, and the&nbsp;value of λ<sub>m</sub>T, are two absolute physical constants independent&nbsp;of any particular kind of  matter, which in conjunction with the&nbsp;constant of gravitation would determine an entirely absolute&nbsp;system of physical units. The form of the function ϕ(Tλ)&nbsp;adopted by Wien and in Planck’s earlier discussions, namely,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">c</span><span class="font2"><sub>1</sub></span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">e<sup>-c/T</sup></span><span class="font2">λ</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span class="font2"> was found to agree fairly with experiment over the&nbsp;range from 100<sup>0</sup> C. to 1300<sup>0</sup> C., when c<sub>1</sub>= 1‧24X10<sup>-5</sup>, and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">c</span><span class="font2"> =&nbsp;1∙4435 in c. g. s. measure, but not so well when the range is farther&nbsp;extended: it appeared that a larger value of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">c</span><span class="font2"> was needed to&nbsp;represent the· radiation for high values of Tλ, that is, for high&nbsp;temperature or for very long wave-lengths. Thiesen proposed&nbsp;the somewhat more general form </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">c</span><span class="font2"><sub>1</sub>(Tλ)<sup>fc</sup>e<sup>-czτλ</sup>, and suggested&nbsp;that the value </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">k=</span><span class="font2"> ⅓ agrees better with the experimental numbers&nbsp;than Wien’s value </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">k = ο.</span><span class="font2"> Lord Rayleigh was led (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Phil. Mag.,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">June 1900) towards this form with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">k</span><span class="font2"> equal to unity from entirely&nbsp;different theoretical considerations, on the assumption of the&nbsp;Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of the energy of a system,&nbsp;consisting of an isolated block of aether, among its free periods&nbsp;of vibration, infinite in number; in some cases this form appeared&nbsp;to give as good results as Wien’s own.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Acting on a suggestion advanced by Lord Rayleigh, Rubens and Kurlbaum soon afterwards widely extended the test of the&nbsp;formulae by means of the so-called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Reststrahlen.</span><span class="font2"> A substance&nbsp;such as an aniline dye, which exhibits selective absorption of&nbsp;any group of rays, also powerfully reflects those rays; and&nbsp;Rubens has been able thus to isolate in considerable purity the&nbsp;rays belonging to absorption bands very far down in the invisible&nbsp;ultra-red, having wave-length of order 10<sup>-3</sup> cm., which are&nbsp;intensely absorbed by substances such as sylvine, by means of&nbsp;five or six successive reflexions of the beam of radiation. By&nbsp;experiments ranging between temperatures -200° C. and&nbsp;+ 1500° C. of the source of radiation, it has been found that the&nbsp;intensity of this definite radiation tends to vary simply as T,&nbsp;with close approximation, thus increasing indefinitely with&nbsp;the temperature, whereas Wien’s formula would make it tend&nbsp;to a definite limit. The only existing formula (except the&nbsp;one suggested by Lord Rayleigh) that proved to be in accord&nbsp;with this result was a new one advanced shortly before and&nbsp;supported on theoretical grounds by Planck, namely, Eλδλ=&nbsp;Cλ<sup>-5</sup>δλ∕(</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span class="font2"><sup>c</sup>∕<sup>λτ</sup>-1), which for small values of λT agrees with Wien’s&nbsp;original form, known to be there satisfactory, while for larger&nbsp;values it tends towards C∕</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">c</span><span class="font2">. λ^<sup>4</sup>T; the new formula is, in fact, the&nbsp;simplest and most likely form that satisfies these two conditions.&nbsp;The point of Lord Rayleigh’s argument was that, at any rate at&nbsp;low frequencies, the law of distribution would suggest an equable&nbsp;partition of the energy between temperature heat and radiant&nbsp;vibrations, and that therefore the energy of the latter should&nbsp;ultimately vary as T; and this prediction, which has thus been&nbsp;verified, may be grafted on to any formula that is in other&nbsp;respects appropriate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Recognizing that his previous hypothesis, restricting the nature of the entropy in addition to its property of continually in-creasing, had thus to be abandoned, Planck had in fact made&nbsp;a fresh start on the basis of a train of ideas which was introduced&nbsp;by Boltzmann in 1877, in order to obtain a precise physical&nbsp;conception of entropy. According to the latter, for an indefinitely&nbsp;numerous system of molecules, with known properties and in&nbsp;given circumstances, there is a definite probability of the&nbsp;occurrence of each statistical distribution of velocities, or say&nbsp;each “ complexion ” of the system, that is formally possible&nbsp;when all velocities consistent with given total energy are con-sidered to be equally likely as regards each molecule; the distribution of greatest possible probability is the state of thermal&nbsp;equilibrium of the system, and the probability of any other&nbsp;state is a function of the entropy of that state. This conception&nbsp;can be developed only in very simple cases; the application to&nbsp;an ideal monatomic gas-system led Boltzmann to take the&nbsp;entropy proportional to the logarithm of the probability. This&nbsp;logarithmic law is in fact demanded in advance by the principle&nbsp;that the entropy of a system should be the sum of the entropies&nbsp;of its parts. By means of a priori considerations of this nature,&nbsp;referring to the distribution of internal vibratory energy among&nbsp;a system of linear electric vibrators of given period, and its&nbsp;equilibrium of exchanges with the surrounding radiant energy,&nbsp;Planck has been guided to an expression for the law of depend-ence of the entropy of that system on the temperature, which&nbsp;corresponds to the form of the law of radiation above stated.&nbsp;The result gains support from the fact that the expressions for&nbsp;the coefficients to which he is led give determinations of the</span></p>
