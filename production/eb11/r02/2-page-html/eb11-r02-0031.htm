<p><span class="font1">immaterial. They can take food, though the crudest form of this belief soon passes into the more refined notion that they&nbsp;consume the impalpable essence of the meals provided for them.&nbsp;The ancient Indian ritual for the sacrifice to the Fathers required&nbsp;the officiating priest to turn away with bated breath that he&nbsp;might not see the spirits engaged upon the rice-balls laid out&nbsp;for them. The elastic impalpable stuff of the spirit-body is&nbsp;apparently capable of compression or expansion, just as Athena&nbsp;can transform herself into a bird. The spirits can pass swiftly&nbsp;through the air or the water; they can enter the stone or the&nbsp;tree, the animal or the man. The spirit-land of the Ibo on the&nbsp;Lower Niger had its rivers, forests or hills, its towns and roads,&nbsp;as upon earth:@@<sup>1</sup> the spirits of the Mordvinian mythology,&nbsp;created by Chkai, not only resembled men, they even possessed&nbsp;the faculty of reproduction by multiplication.@@<sup>2</sup> The Finns&nbsp;ascribed a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">haltia</span><span class="font1"> or genius to each object, which could, however, guard other individuals of the same species. This is the&nbsp;beginning of the species-god, and implies a step of thought&nbsp;comparable to the production in language of general terms.&nbsp;These protecting spirits were free beings, having form and&nbsp;shape, hut not individualized; while above them rose the higher&nbsp;deities like the forest-god Tapio and his maiden Hillervo,&nbsp;protectress of herds, or Ahto the water-god who gradually took&nbsp;the place of Vesi, the actual element originally conceived as&nbsp;itself divine, and ruled over the spirits of lakes and rivers, wells&nbsp;and springs.@@<sup>3</sup> The Finns came to apply to the. upper gods the&nbsp;term Yumala which originally denoted the living sky; the&nbsp;Samoyedes made the same use of Num, and the AIongols of&nbsp;Tengri.@@<sup>4</sup> Above the innumerable&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the Gold Coast rose</span></p>

The Yoruba-Speaking peoples generalized the spirits of mountain&nbsp;and hill into Oke, god of heights; and the multitude of local&nbsp;sea-gods on the western half of the slave coast was fused into&nbsp;one god of the Ocean, Olokun.@@<sup>5</sup> The Babylonian theology&nbsp;recognized a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Zi</span><span class="font1"> or “ spirit ” in both men and gods, somewhat&nbsp;resembling the Egyptian “ double ” or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ka</span><span class="font1"> ; spirits are classed as&nbsp;spirits of heaven and spirits of earth; but the original identity&nbsp;of gods and spirits may be inferred from the fact that the same&nbsp;sign stands before the names of both.@@<sup>6</sup> Out of the vast mass of&nbsp;undifferentiated powers certain functional deities appear; and&nbsp;the Kami of Japan to-day who preside over the gilds and crafts&nbsp;of industry and agriculture, over the trees and grasses of the&nbsp;field, the operations of the household, and even the kitchen-range, the saucepan, the rice-pot, the well, the garden, the&nbsp;scarecrow and the privy, have their counterparts in thé lists of&nbsp;ancient Rome, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Migitamenla</span><span class="font1"> over whose contents Tertullian&nbsp;and Augustine made merry.

But such powers were hardly persons.&nbsp;The settler who went into the woods might know neither the&nbsp;name nor the sex .of the indwelling </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">numen</span><span class="font1">; “si deus si dea,”&nbsp;“ sive mas sive femina,” ran the old formulae.@@<sup>8</sup> So the Baals&nbsp;of the Semitic peoples constituted a group of powers fertilizing&nbsp;the land with water-springs, the givers of com and wine and oil,&nbsp;out of which under Xonditions of superior political development&nbsp;a high-god like the Tyrian Baal, the majestic City-King, might&nbsp;he evolved. The Celts who saw the world peopled with the&nbsp;spirits of trees and animals, rocks, mountains, springs and rivers,&nbsp;grouped them in classes like the Dervonnae (oak-spirits), the&nbsp;Niskai (water-spirits), the Proximae, the Matronae (earth-goddesses)@@<sup>9</sup> and the like. Below the small band of Teutonic&nbsp;divinities were the elves of forest and field, the water-elves or&nbsp;nixes and spirits of house and home. The Vedic deities of the&nbsp;nobler sort, the shining </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">devas,</span><span class="font1"> the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">asuras</span><span class="font1"> (the “ breathers ” or&nbsp;living, perhaps to be identified with the Scandinavian </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">oesir)&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">rose above a vast multitude of demonic powers, many of them&nbsp;doubtless derived from the local customs and beliefs of the native&nbsp;races whom the immigrant Aryans subdued. In the earliest&nbsp;literary record of Greek religion Homer distinguishes between&nbsp;the and the δαίμων, the personalized god and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">numen&nbsp;or</span><span class="font1"> divine power. In Homer the element of time is definitely&nbsp;recognized. The gods are the “ Immortals.” They arc bom, and&nbsp;their parentage is known, but they do not die. Zeus is not&nbsp;self-existent in the sense in which the Indian Brahmä is&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">svayambhu,</span><span class="font1"> but certain questions have been by implication&nbsp;asked and answered, which the demonology of the savage has&nbsp;not yet raised. But behind Homcr stretches the dim scene of&nbsp;pre-Hellenic religion, and the conflict of elements “ Pelasgic,”&nbsp;oriental and Hellenic, out of which the Homeric religion emerged;&nbsp;and beneath the Homeric religion how many features of the&nbsp;religion of ghosts and nature-spirits survived in popular usage&nbsp;and the lower cults!@@<sup>10</sup> When Herodotus (ii. 53) tried to trace&nbsp;the origin of the beliefs around him, he found his way back to&nbsp;an age before Hesiod or Homer, when the gods were nameless.&nbsp;To that age the traditions preserved at Dodona bore witness;&nbsp;and the designations of special groups like the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bcol&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">μέγ</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ιστοί, Beol μαλίχιοι, Bcol</span><span class="font1"> πραξιδικαι, or, possibly, thé&nbsp;Venerable Goddesses </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Bcai σ€μναΙ)</span><span class="font1"> of Athens, point to a mode&nbsp;of thought when the divine Powers were not definitely individualized. They are just at the point of transition from the&nbsp;ranks of spirits to the higher classes of the gods. As they had&nbsp;no names, they had no relations. Nor had any images yet been&nbsp;made of them. They were associated with hallowed trees,&nbsp;with sacred stones and pillars, out of which came the square&nbsp;rough-hewn Hermae which were anointed with oil Hke the sacred&nbsp;stone attributed by legend to Jacob at Bethel.@@<sup>11</sup> By what&nbsp;processes the Hellenic immigration introduced new deities and&nbsp;the Greek pantheon was slowly formed, can only be conjecturally&nbsp;traced with the help of archaeology. But Herodotus and&nbsp;Aeschylus were well aware that the religion of Greece had not&nbsp;been uniformly the same; and the gods whom they knew had&nbsp;been developed out of intercourse with other peoples and the&nbsp;succession of races in the obscure and distant past.</span></p><div>
