(Famianus), a very ingenious and learned Jeſuit, was born at Rome the latter end of the 16th century, and taught rhetoric there, in a public manner, for fifteen years. He wrote ſeveral pieces upon the art of oratory, and publiſhed ſome orations with a view of illuſtrating by example what he had inculcated by precept. But his <hi rend="italic">Proluſiones Academicae</hi> and his Histor <hi rend="italic">ia de Bello Belgico</hi> are the works which raised his reputation, and have preſerved his memory. His hiſtory of the war of Flanders was publiſhed at Rome; the firſt decad in 1640, the ſecond in '647; the whole extending from the death of Charles V. which happened in 1558, to the year 1590. It is written in good Latin, as all allow; but its merit in other respects has been variouſly determined. His <hi rend="italic">Proluſiones Academicae</hi> ſhow great ingenuity, and a maſterly ſkill in claſſical literature ; that prolusion especially in which he introduces Lucan, Lucretius, Claudian, Ovid, Statius, and Virgil, each of them versifying according to his own ſtrain. They have been often printed. We know not the year of Strada’s birth or of his death.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
