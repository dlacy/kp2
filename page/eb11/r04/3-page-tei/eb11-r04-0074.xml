This may be the stele to which Dionysius of Halicarnassus refers as marking the tomb of Hostus HostiHus (father of Tullus Hostilius) whose site (according to those who believed in the translation of Romulus to heaven) was marked by the <hi rend="italic">lapis niger.</hi></p><p>The Senaculum appears to have been a place of preliminary meeting for the senate before entering the Curia (Liv. xli. 27;</p><p>Val. Max. ii.2, 6); it adjoined the temple of Concord, and when this was rebuilt on an enlarged scale in the reign of Augustus it appears probable that its large</p><p>projecting portico became the Senaculum.</p><p>A great part of the north-east side of the Fcrum was occupied by two basilicae, which were more than once rebuilt under different names. The first of these appears to have been adjacent to the Curia, on its west side; it was called the Basilica Porcia, and was founded by the elder Cato in 185 <hi rend="bold">B.c.</hi></p><p>(see Liv. xxxix. 44, and Plut. <hi rend="italic">Cato Major</hi>, 19); it was burnt with the Curia at Clodius’s funeral. On the.north side of the Forum another basilica, called Aemilía et Fulvia (Varro vi. 4), was built in 179 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>  by the censors M. Fulvius and M. Aemilius Lepidus;@@it stood, according to Livy (xl. 51), “post argentarias novas,” the line of silversmiths* shops along the north-east side of the Forum. In 50<hi rend="bold">B.c. </hi>it was rebuilt by L. Aemilius Paulus with Caesar’s money (Plut. <hi rend="italic">Coes.</hi>  29; Appian, <hi rend="italic">Bell. Civ.</hi>  ii. 26), and was more than once restored within the few subsequent years by members of the same family. Its later name was the Basilica Pauli, and it was remarkable for its magnificent columns of Phrygian marble (Plin. <hi rend="italic">H.N. </hi>xxxvi. 102) or pavonazzetto. Part of the western end was still standing in the 16th century, and was drawn by Giuliano da Sangallo (Iluelsen, <hi rend="italic">The Roman Forum,</hi>  fig. 61). Recent excavations have shown that it was approached from the Forum by a flight of steps leading to a two-storeyed colonnade. Behind this was a row of tabernae in the middle of which was the entrance to the main hall, consisting in a nave and three aisles (two on the north side).</p><p>Near the middle of the north-east side of the Forum stood also the small bronze temple of Janus,@@the doors of which were shut on those rare occasions when Rome was at peace.@@ A first brass of Nero shows it as a small celia, with richly ornamented frieze and cornice. Another aedicula near that of Janus was the shrine of Venus Cloacina (or the Purifier), on the line of the cloaca which runs under the Basilica Aemilia;</p><p>@@@The Forum Piscatorium or fish-market appears to have been at the back of this basilica (see Liv. xl. 51).</p><p>@@@The original temple was one of the prehistoric buildings attributed to Romulus and Tati us (Serv.<hi rend="italic">Ad Aen.</hi>  i. 291), or by Livy (i. 19) to Numa.</p><p>@@@ See<hi rend="italic">Mon.
