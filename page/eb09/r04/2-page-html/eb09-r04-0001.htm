                to Dr Hickes’s sermons, in which the lawfulness of resistance in extreme cases was
                defended. In the wild schemes of Shaftesbury after the election of
                Tory&nbsp;sheriffs for London in 1682 he had no share ; upon the violation of the
                charters, however, in 1683, he began seriously to&nbsp;consider as to the best means
                of resisting the Government,&nbsp;and on one occasion attended a meeting at which
                treason,&nbsp;or what might be construed as treason, was talked. Monmouth, Essex,
                Hampden, Sidney, and Howard of Escrick&nbsp;were the principal of those who met to
                consult. On the&nbsp;breaking out of the Rye Plot, of which neither he,
                Essex,&nbsp;nor Sidney had the slightest knowledge, he was accused by&nbsp;informers
                of promising his assistance to raise an insurrection&nbsp;and compass the death of
                the king. Refusing to attempt&nbsp;to escape, ho was brought before the council,
                when his&nbsp;attendance at the meeting referred to was charged against&nbsp;him. He
                was sent on June 26, 1683, to the Tower, and,&nbsp;looking upon himself as a dying
                man, betook himself&nbsp;wholly to preparation for death. Monmouth offered to appear
                to take his trial, if thereby he could help Russell, and Essex refused to abscond
                for fear of injuring his friend’s chance of escape. Before a committee of
                the&nbsp;council Russell, on June 28, acknowledged his presence at&nbsp;the meeting,
                but denied all knowledge of the proposed&nbsp;insurrection. He reserved his defence,
                however, until his&nbsp;trial. He would probably have saved his life but for
                the&nbsp;perjury of Lord Howard. The suicide of Essex, the news of&nbsp;which was
                brought into court during the trial, was quoted&nbsp;as additional evidence against
                him, as pointing to the certainty of Essex’s guilt. On July 19 he was tried at
                the&nbsp;Old Bailey, his wife assisting him in his defence. Evidence&nbsp;was given
                by an informer that, while at Shaftesbury’s&nbsp;hiding-place in Wapping, Russell
                had joined in the proposal to seize the king’s guard, a charge indignantly
                denied&nbsp;by him in his farewell paper, and that he was one of a&nbsp;committee of
                six appointed to prepare the scheme for an&nbsp;insurrection. Howard, too, expressly
                declared that Russell&nbsp;had urged the entering into communications with
                Argyll&nbsp;in Scotland. Howard’s perjury is clear from other witnesses, but the
                evidence was accepted. Russell spoke with&nbsp;spirit and dignity in his own
                defence, and, in especial,&nbsp;vehemently denied that he had ever been party to a
                design&nbsp;so wicked and so foolish as those of the murder of the king&nbsp;and of
                rebellion. It will be observed that the legality of&nbsp;the trial, in so far as the
                jurors were not properly qualified and the law of treason was shamefully strained,
                was&nbsp;denied in the Act of 1 William and Mary which annulled&nbsp;the attainder.
                Hallam maintains that the only overt act&nbsp;of treason proved against Russell was
                his concurrence in&nbsp;the project of a rising at Taunton, which he denied,
                and&nbsp;which, Ramsay being the only witness, was not sufficient&nbsp;to warrant a
                conviction.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Russell was sentenced to die. Many attempts were made to save his
                life. The old earl of Bedford offered&nbsp;£50,000 or £100,000, and Monmouth, Legge,
                Lady&nbsp;Ranelagh, and Rochester added their intercessions. Russell&nbsp;himself,
                in petitions to Charles and James, offered to live&nbsp;abroad if his life were
                spared, and never again to meddle&nbsp;in the affairs of England. He refused,
                however, to yield&nbsp;to the influence of Burnet and Tillotson, who
                endeavoured&nbsp;to make him grant the unlawfulness of resistance, although&nbsp;it
                is more than probable that compliance in this would&nbsp;have saved his life. He
                drew up, with Burnet’s assistance, a paper containing his apology, and he wrote to
                the&nbsp;king a letter, to be delivered after his death, in which he&nbsp;asked
                Charles’s pardon for any wrong he had done him. A&nbsp;suggestion of escape from
                Lord Cavendish he refused. He&nbsp;behaved with his usual quiet cheerfulness during
                his stay in&nbsp;the Tower, spending his last day on earth as he had
                intended&nbsp;to spend the following Sunday if he had reached it. He</span></p><div>
            <p><span class="font1">received the sacrament from Tillotson, and Burnet twice preached
                    to him. Having supped with his wife, the parting&nbsp;from whom was his only
                    great trial, he slept peacefully,&nbsp;and spent the last morning in devotion
                    with Burnet. He&nbsp;went to the place of execution in Lincoln’s Inn Fields
                    with&nbsp;perfect calmness, which was preserved to the last. He&nbsp;died on
                    July 21, 1683, in the forty-fourth year of his age.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font0">A true and moderate summing up of his character will be found in
                    his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Life,</span><span
                    class="font0"> by Lord John Russell.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(O. A.)</span></p>
            <p><span class="font1">RUSSELL, John Scott (1808-1882), was born in 1808 near Glasgow, a
                    “son of the manse,” and was at first&nbsp;destined for the ministry. But this
                    intention on his father’s&nbsp;part was changed in consequence of the boy’s
                    early leanings towards practical science. He attended in succession&nbsp;the
                    universities of St Andrews, Edinburgh, and Glasgow,—&nbsp;taking his degree in
                    the last-named at the age of sixteen.&nbsp;After spending a couple of years in
                    workshops, he settled&nbsp;in Edinburgh as a lecturer on science, and soon
                    collected&nbsp;large classes. In 1832-33 he was engaged to give the&nbsp;natural
                    philosophy course at the university, the chair&nbsp;having] become vacant by the
                    death of Leslie. In the&nbsp;following year he began that remarkable series of
                    observations on waves whose results, besides being of very&nbsp;great scientific
                    importance, were the chief determining&nbsp;factor of his subsequent practical
                    career. Having been&nbsp;consulted as to the possibility of applying
                    steam-navigation to the Edinburgh and Glasgow Canal, he replied&nbsp;that the
                    question could not be answered without experiments, and that ho was willing to
                    undertake such if a&nbsp;portion of the canal were placed at his disposal.
                    The&nbsp;results of this inquiry are to be found in the </span><span
                    class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Transactions&nbsp;of the Royal Society
                    of Edinburgh</span><span class="font1"> (vol. xiv.), and in

                    need&nbsp;not say more than that the existence of the </span><span class="font1"
                    style="font-style:italic;">long wave,</span><span class="font1">
                    or&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">wave of
                    translation,</span><span class="font1"> as well as many of its most
                    important&nbsp;features, were here first recognized, and (to give one
                    very&nbsp;simple idea of the value of the investigation) that it
                    was&nbsp;clearly pointed out </span><span class="font1"
                    style="font-style:italic;">why</span><span class="font1"> there is a special
                    rate, depending&nbsp;on the depth of the water, at which a canal-boat can
                    be&nbsp;towed at the least expenditure of effort by the horse.
                    The&nbsp;elementary mathematical theory of the long wave is very&nbsp;simple,
                    and was soon supplied by commentators on Scott&nbsp;Russell’s work ; a more
                    complete investigation has been&nbsp;since given by Stokes ; and the subject may
                    be considered&nbsp;äs certainly devoid of any special mystery. Russell
                    held&nbsp;an opposite opinion, and it led him to many extraordinary&nbsp;and
                    groundless speculations, some of which have been published in a posthumous
                    volume, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Wave of
                    Translation&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(1885). His observations led him to
                    propose and experiment on a new system of shaping vessels, which is
                    known&nbsp;as the w</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ave
                    system.</span><span class="font1"> This culminated in the building of
                    the&nbsp;enormous and unique “Great Eastern,” of which it has&nbsp;been recently
                    remarked by a competent authority that “ it&nbsp;is probable that, if a new ‘
                    Great Eastern ’ were now to&nbsp;be built, the system of construction employed
                    by Mr Scott&nbsp;Russell would be followed exactly.”</span></p>
            <p><span class="font1">Though his fame will rest chiefly on the two great steps we have
                    just mentioned, Scott Russell’s activity&nbsp;and ingenuity displayed themselves
                    in many other fields,—&nbsp;steam-coaches for roads, improvements in boilers and
                    in&nbsp;marine engines, the immense iron dome of the Vienna exhibition, cellular
                    double bottoms for iron ships, Ac. Along&nbsp;with Mr Stafford Northcote (now
                    Lord Iddesleigh), he was&nbsp;joint secretary of the Great Exhibition of 1851 ;
                    and he&nbsp;was one of the chief founders of the Institution of
