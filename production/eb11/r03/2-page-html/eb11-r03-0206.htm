        <p><span class="font1">a better example of the art of this period is to be seen in the
                relief (Plate IV. fig. 20) now in the Palazzo Sacchetti, recently&nbsp;published by
                Mr A. J. B. Wace,@@<sup>1</sup> which probably represents the&nbsp;presentation of
                Caracalla to the senate as the destined successor&nbsp;of his father. The squat
                figures of the senators, their grouping,&nbsp;which, though not lacking in
                naturalism and </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span
                class="font1">certain effectiveness, is not in its main lines aesthetic, and the
                lavish use of&nbsp;deeply drilled ornament, are features which leave no doubt
                as&nbsp;to the period to which this work should be assigned. Rome,&nbsp;however,
                could still boast a school of portrait-sculptors, whose&nbsp;work was of no ordinary
                merit. The bronze statue of Sep-timius Severus, which passed into the Somzee
                collection, has&nbsp;been pronounced by Furtwängler to be of much earlier
                date,&nbsp;except for the head of the emperor, and we cannot therefore&nbsp;feel
                confidence in using it as a measure of the artistic achievements of Severus’s reign;
                but the busts of Caracalla, which&nbsp;represent the tyrant in his later years, are
                masterly both in&nbsp;conception and in execution.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">In the second quarter of the 3rd century </span><span class="font2"
                style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.,</span><span class="font1"> when the Empire
                was torn by internal strife, threatened in its very&nbsp;existence by the inroads of
                barbarism, and hastening towards&nbsp;economic ruin, art could no longer flourish,
                and monuments&nbsp;of sculpture become scarce, if we except portraits and
                sarcophagi. The busts of this period are easily distinguished by&nbsp;the treatment
                of the hair and beard, which seem to have been&nbsp;closely clipped, and arc
                indicated by a multitude of fine chisel&nbsp;strokes on a roughened surface. But,
                rough as these technical&nbsp;methods may seem, the artists of the time used them
                with&nbsp;wonderful effect, and the portraits of the emperor Philip </span><span
                class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">(a. d.&nbsp;</span><span
                class="font1">244-49) <sup>in</sup> the Braccio Nuovo, and an unknown Roman
                in&nbsp;the Capitoline Museum (Plate I. fig. 7), are hardly to be&nbsp;surpassed in
                their delineation of craft and cruelty. Amongst&nbsp;the sarcophagi of the 3rd
                century we select, in preference to&nbsp;those adorned with scenes of Greek
                mythology, the fine example&nbsp;in the Museo delle Terme (formerly in the Ludovisi
                collection)&nbsp;decorated with a mêlée of Romans and Orientals (Plate IV.&nbsp;fig.
                23); the principal figure—whose portrait is also to be&nbsp;seen in the Capitoline
                Museum—has been identified by Mr&nbsp;A. H. S. Yeames as C. Furius Sabinius Aquila
                Timesitheus,&nbsp;the minister and father-in-law of Gordian III. (d. </span><span
                class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font1">
                244).&nbsp;Even after the middle of the century, when the Empire was for&nbsp;a time
                dismembered, portrait-sculpture put forth fresh evidences&nbsp;of life and vigour.
                Gallienus, who was himself a dilettante&nbsp;and doubtless largely endowed with
                personal vanity, seems to&nbsp;have called into being a naturalistic school of
                sculptors, who&nbsp;harked back to the models of the later Antonine period,
                so&nbsp;that it is not always easy to distinguish the busts of his time&nbsp;from
                those of a much earlier date. The Louvre bust of the&nbsp;emperor (Plate I. fig. 8)
                will serve as a type of these works.&nbsp;But this singular renaissance was as
                short-lived as the eclectic&nbsp;revival of classicism under Hadrian. It is
                remarkable that&nbsp;the portrait of Gallienus is the last which can be identified
                by&nbsp;truly individual traits. The period of storm and stress which&nbsp;followed
                his death has left little or no monumental material&nbsp;for the historian of
                sculpture; and when the curtain again&nbsp;rises on the art of the new monarchy
                founded by Diocletian&nbsp;and perfected by Constantine, we seem to move in a new
                world.&nbsp;The East has triumphed over the West. Just as in Egyptian&nbsp;and,
                speaking generally, in all oriental art, before the revelation of true plastic
                principles, which we owe to the Greek genius,&nbsp;the law of “ fron tali ty ” was
                universally operative, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
                >i.e.</span><span class="font1"> the&nbsp;pose of sculptured figures was rigidly
                symmetrical and without&nbsp;Iateral curvature, so the portraits of Constantine and
                his&nbsp;successors </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">are
                </span><span class="font1">discerned at a glance by their stiff pose and&nbsp;fixed
                and stony stare. The fact is that the secret of organic&nbsp;structure has been
                lost; the bust (or statue) is no longer a&nbsp;true portrait, a block of marble made
                to pulsate with the life&nbsp;of the subject represented, but a monument. It was
                thus&nbsp;that the absolute monarchs of the Empire, before whom their&nbsp;subjects
                prostrated themselves in mute adoration, preferred to&nbsp;be portrayed; and we
                cannot help recalling Ammianuss&nbsp;description @@<sup>2</sup> of the entry of
                Constantius II. into Rome </span><span class="font2"
                style="font-variant:small-caps;">(a.d.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">356). The
                emperor rode in a golden chariot, turning his head&nbsp;neither to the right nor to
                the left, but gazing impassively&nbsp;before him “ tanquam figmentum hominis.” The
                description&nbsp;fits such a portrait as that of an unknown personage of
                the&nbsp;4th century in the Capitoline Museum (Plate I. fig. 9), which&nbsp;has
                found a panegyrist in Riegl. It remains to note that the&nbsp;narrow bands of relief
                on the Arch of Constantine, some of&nbsp;which probably date from the reign of
                Diocletian,@@3 partake of&nbsp;the same monumental character as the single statues
                of the&nbsp;time. Where the nature of the subject permits, as in the case&nbsp;of
                the reliefs here represented (Plate III. fig. 19), the frontality&nbsp;of the
                central figure, and the strict symmetry of the grouping,&nbsp;which imparts an
                almost geometrical regularity to the main&nbsp;lines of the composition, are
                calculated for architectonic rather&nbsp;than for plastic effect. The breath of
                organic life has ceased&nbsp;to inspire the marble.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">We have confined ourselves in the above section to tracing the course
                of development in what we may call official Roman&nbsp;sculpture, represented in the
                main, as is natural, by the&nbsp;monuments of the capital. The products of local
                schools&nbsp;cannot here be treated in detail. The difficult problems
                which&nbsp;they raise are best illustrated by the case of “ Trajan’s trophy
                ”&nbsp;at Adam-Klissi in the Dobruja. Although the very name of&nbsp;the monument
                might seem to furnish sufficient evidence of&nbsp;its date, the late Professor
                Furtwängler stoutly maintained&nbsp;that Trajan did but restore a monument dating
                from 29 </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;"
                    >b.c.@@<sup>4&nbsp;</sup></span><span class="font1">He called attention to the
                uniformity in style of the grave-monuments of soldiers from north Italy, serving in
                the legions&nbsp;of the Rhine and Danube; these date from the early
                imperial&nbsp;period, and represent (according to Furtwängler) a traditional&nbsp;“
                legionary style.” It may be admitted that they are&nbsp;eminently Italian in their
                hard realistic character; but the&nbsp;tradition was not extinct in the Trajanic
                period, so that the&nbsp;analogy between these monuments and its rudely
                carved&nbsp;figures is inconclusive, and the </span><span class="font1"

                which&nbsp;is far from being homogeneous, contains, as Studniczka@@<sup>5</sup>
                has&nbsp;observed, oriental elements which could not possibly be found&nbsp;in
                sculpture of the ist century B.C. Local tradition may&nbsp;also be traced,

                sculptures of&nbsp;the tomb of the Julii at St Remy and the triumphal arches
                of&nbsp;Orange and Carpentras suffice to prove. Gallo-Roman art,&nbsp;on the other
                hand, has a physiognomy of its own, whose outlines&nbsp;have been traced by M.
