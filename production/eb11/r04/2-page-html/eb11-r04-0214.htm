<p><span class="font2">Gallery, London, “Mercury and the Dishonest Woodman,” </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font2">three others; in Raynham Hall, “ Belisarius ”; in the Grosvenor&nbsp;Gallery, “ Diogenes <sup>6</sup>; in the Pitti Gallery, a grand portrait of a man&nbsp;in armour, and the “ Temptation of St Anthony, which contains&nbsp;his own portrait. This last subject appears also in St Petersburg,&nbsp;and in the Berlin Gallery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The satires of Salvator Rosa deserve more attention than they have generally received. There are, however, two recent books&nbsp;taking account of them—by Cesáreo, 1892, and Cartelli, 1899. The&nbsp;satires, though considerably spread abroad during his lifetime, were&nbsp;not published until 1719. They are all in terza rima, written&nbsp;without much literary correctness, but remarkably spirited, pointed&nbsp;and even brilliant. They are slashingly denunciatory, and from this&nbsp;point of view too monotonous in treatment. Rosa here appears as&nbsp;a very severe castigator of all ranks and conditions of men, not&nbsp;sparing the highest, and as a champion of the poor and down-trodden,&nbsp;and of moral virtue and Catholic faith. It seems odd that a man&nbsp;who took so free a part in the pleasures and diversions of life should&nbsp;be so ruthless to the ministers of these. The satire on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Music</span><span class="font2"> exposes&nbsp;the insolence and profligacy of musicians, and the shame of courts&nbsp;and churches in encouraging them. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Poetry</span><span class="font2"> dwells</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">on the pedantry, imitativencss, adulation, affectation</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">and indecency of poets—also their poverty, and the</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">neglect with which they, were treated; and there is a</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">very vigorous sortie against oppressive governors and</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">aristocrats. Tasso’s glory is upheld; Dante is spoken</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">of as obsolete, and Ariosto , as corrupting. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Painting</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">inveighs against the pictorial treatment of squalid</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">subjects, such as beggars (though .Rosa must surely</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">himself have been partly responsible for this mis</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">direction of the art), against the ignorance and lewd</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ness of painters, and their tricks of trade, and the</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">gross indecorum of painting sprawling half-naked</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">saints of both sexes. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">War</span><span class="font2"> (which contains the</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">eulogy of Masaniello) derides the folly of hireling</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">soldiers, who fight and perish while kings stay at</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">home; the vile morals of kings and lords, heresy and</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">unbelief also come in for a flagellation. In </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Babylon</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Rosa represents himself as a fisherman, Tirreno, con</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">stantly unlucky in his net-hauls on the Euphrates;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">he converses with a native of the country, Ergasto. Babylon (Rome) is very severely treated, and Naples much the same.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Envy</span><span class="font2"> (the last of the satires, and generally accounted the best,&nbsp;although without strong apparent reason) represents Rosa dreaming&nbsp;that, as he is about to inscribe in all modesty his name upon&nbsp;the threshold of the temple of glory, the goddess or fiend of&nbsp;Envy obstructs him, and a long interchange of reciprocal, objurgations ensues. Here occurs the highly charged portrait of the&nbsp;chief Roman detractor of Salvator (we are not aware that he has&nbsp;ever been identified by name); and the painter protests that he&nbsp;would never condescend to do any of the lascivious work in painting&nbsp;so shamefully in vogue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As authorities for the life of Salvator Rosa, Passeri, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vite de' Pittori,</span><span class="font2"> may be consulted, and Salvini, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Satire e Vita di Salvator&nbsp;Rosa;</span><span class="font2"> also Baldinucci and Dominici. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font2"> by Lady Morgan is&nbsp;a romantic treatment, mingling tradition or mere fiction with fact.&nbsp;The novel, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">A Company of Death,</span><span class="font2"> by Albert Cotton, 1904, gives an&nbsp;interesting picture of Salvator Rosa at Naples.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(W. M. R.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ROSACEAE, </span><span class="font2">in botany, a large cosmopolitan family of seedbearing plants belonging to the subclass Polypetalae of Dicotyledons and containing about 90 genera with 2000 species. The plants vary widely in manner of growth. Many are herbaceous,&nbsp;growing erect, as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Geum,</span><span class="font2"> or with slender creeping stem, as in&nbsp;species of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Potentilla,</span><span class="font2"> sometimes sending out long runners, as&nbsp;in strawberry; others are shrubby, as raspberry, often associated with a scrambling habit, as in the brambles and roses,&nbsp;while apple, cherry, pear, plum and other British fruit trees&nbsp;represent the arborescent habit. Vegetative propagation takes&nbsp;place by means of runners, which root at the apex and form&nbsp;a new plant, as in strawberry; by suckers springing from the&nbsp;base of the shoot and rising to form new leafy shoots after&nbsp;running for some distance beneath the soil, as in raspberry;&nbsp;or by shoots produced from the roots, as in cherry or plum.&nbsp;The scrambling of the brambles and roses is effected by means&nbsp;of prickles on the branches and leaf-stalks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The leaves, which are arranged alternately, are simple, as in apple, cherry, &amp;c., but more often compound, with leaflets&nbsp;palmately arranged, as in strawberry and species of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Potentilla,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">or pinnately arranged, as in the brambles, roses, mountain ash,&nbsp;&amp;c. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font2">difference in this respect often occurs in one and the&nbsp;same genus, as in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pyrus,</span><span class="font2"> where apple (P. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Malus),</span><span class="font2"> and pear&nbsp;(P. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">communis)</span><span class="font2"> have simple leaves, whereas mountain ash or&nbsp;rowan (P. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">aucuparia)</span><span class="font2"> has pinnately compound leaves. In&nbsp;warm climates the leaves are often leathery and evergreen.&nbsp;The leayes are stipulate, the stipules being sometimes small and ’&nbsp;shortlived, as in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pyms</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Prunus</span><span class="font2"> (cherry, plum, &amp;c.), or&nbsp;more important structures adnate to the base of the leaf-stalk,&nbsp;as in roses, brambles, &amp;c. The flowers, which are regular,&nbsp;generally bisexual, and often showy, are sometimes borne&nbsp;singly, as in some species of rose, or of the cloudberry </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Rubus&nbsp;chamaemorus),</span><span class="font2"> or few or more together in a corymbose manner,&nbsp;as in some roses, hawthorn and others. The inflorescence in&nbsp;agrimony is a raceme, in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Poterium</span><span class="font2"> a dense-flowered spike, in&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Spiraea</span><span class="font2"> a number of cymes arranged in a corymb. The parts&nbsp;of the flowers are arranged on a 5-merous plan, with generally&nbsp;considerable increase in the number of stamens and carpels.&nbsp;The shape of the thalamus or floral receptacle, and the relative&nbsp;position and number of the stamens and carpels and the&nbsp;character </span><span class="font3">of </span><span class="font2">the fruit, vary widely and form distinguishing</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">features of the different suborders, six of which may be recognized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Suborder</span><span class="font2"> J. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Spiraeoideae</span><span class="font2"> is characterized by a fiat or slightly concave receptacle on which the carpels, frequently five in number,&nbsp;form a central whorl; each ovary contains several ovules, and&nbsp;the fruit is a follicle. There are five sepals, five petals and the&nbsp;stamens vary from ten to indefinite. The plants are generally&nbsp;shrubs with simple or compound leaves and racemes or panicles of&nbsp;numerous small white, rose or purple flowers. This suborder, which&nbsp;is nearly allied to the order Saxifragaceae, contains 17 genera,&nbsp;chiefly north temperate in distribution. The largest is </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Spiraea,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">numerous species of which are cultivated in gardens; 5. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">salicifolia&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">occurs in Britain.apparently wild in plantations, but is not indigenous.&nbsp;The native British meadow-sweet (5. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Utmaria)</span><span class="font2"> and dropwort&nbsp;(5. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Filipendula)</span><span class="font2"> have been placed in a separate genus, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vlmaria,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">and included in the Rosoideae on account of their one-seeded fruit.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Quillaja saponaria</span><span class="font2"> is the Chilean soap tree; the bark contains&nbsp;saponin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Suborder II. Pomoideae</span><span class="font2"> is characterized by a deep cup-shaped receptacle with the inner wall of which the five or fewer carpels are&nbsp;united (fig. 1, 3); the carpels are also united with each other, and&nbsp;each contains generally two ovules. The fruit is made up of the large&nbsp;fleshy receptacle surrounding the ripe ovaries, the endocarp of which&nbsp;is leathery, or stony and contains one seed. The plants are shrubs&nbsp;or trees with simple or pinnately compound leaves and white or&nbsp;rose-coloured often showy flowers, with five sepals and petals and&nbsp;indefinite stamens. The 14 genera are distributed through the&nbsp;north temperate zone, extending southwards in the New World to&nbsp;the Andes of Peru and Chile. The largest genus, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pyrus,</span><span class="font2"> with about&nbsp;50 species, includes apple (P. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Malus),</span><span class="font2"> pear (P. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">communis)</span><span class="font2"> (fig. 2),&nbsp;wild service (P. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">torminalis),</span><span class="font2"> rowan or mountain-ash (P. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">aucuparia),&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">and white beam (P. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Aria). Mespilus</span><span class="font2"> (medlar) and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Cotoneaster</span><span class="font2"> are&nbsp;also included. (See separate articles for most of the above.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Suborder III. Rosoideae</span><span class="font2"> is characterized by </span><span class="font1">the </span><span class="font2">receptacle being convex and swollen (fig. 1, 1), as in strawberry, or cup-shaped, as&nbsp;in.rose (fig. 4), and bearing numerous carpels, each of which contains one or two ovules, while the fruit is one-seeded and inde-hiscent. The 39 genera are grouped in tribes according to the&nbsp;form of the receptacle and of the fruit. The Potentilleae bear the&nbsp;carpels on a large, rounded or convex outgrowth of the receptacle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the large genus </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rubus</span><span class="font2"> (fig. 3) the ripe ovaries form drupels upon the ary receptacle; the genus is almost cosmopolitan, but&nbsp;the majority of species occur in the forest region of the north&nbsp;temperate zone and in the mountains of tropical America. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">R.&nbsp;fruticosus</span><span class="font2"> is blackberry, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">R. Idaeus,</span><span class="font2"> raspberry, and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">R. Chamac-morus,</span><span class="font2"> cloudberry. In the flower of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Potentilla, Fragaria</span><span class="font2"> (strawberry) and a few allied genera an </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">epicalyx</span><span class="font2"> is formed by stipular&nbsp;structures arising at the base of the sepals. The fruits consist of&nbsp;numerous dry achenes borne in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Fragaria</span><span class="font2"> on the much-enlarged</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
